## 'Little Willie' is big in Georgia 
### PETER FINCH 
Sports question No. 1: What
Southeastern Conference
football player is a distant
cousin of NFL Hall of Famer Jim
Brown?
The answer is Willie
McClendon of the University
of Georgia. He is the captain of
the tough Bulldog team that
will meet Stanford in the
Bluebonnet Bowl New Year's
Eve.
"Little Willie," as his team
mates call him, has had a very
big year. This 6-foot-2, 205-
pound senior running back
carried the ball 287 times this
season for 1312 yards, break
ing a 37-ygar-old Georgia re
cord held by Heisman Trophy
winner Frank Sinkwich.
McClendon's career total of
2228 yards puts him third on
Georgia's all-time rushing list.
He gained more than 100
yards in eight consecutive
games this year, setting a SEC
record. He scored 13 touch
downs rushing, including
his longest, an 81-yard
jaunt against South Carolina.
McClendon's statistics speak
for themselves, to say the least.
However, statistics are not
the only thing that will attest to
the talent of Willie McClen
don. His coaches, and just
about everyone else down in
the SEC, are talking about him.
"Little Willie" was selected by
UPI as the SEC player of the
year, and he was the only
player unanimously voted to
the all-conference team.
"Willie," said Bulldog coach
Vince Dooley, "is certainly one
of the most wonderful players I
have ever coached. He has ex
ceptional size and speed, and
he is a superb blocker.''
Bill Pace, Georgia's offensive
coordinator added that
McClendon's attitude is his
greatest asset. "He works ex
tremely hard at practice. And
most importantly, he's more
concerned about winning for

Georgia than about his own
stats," Pace said.
According to McClendon,
his success this year comes
from something that just takes
experience to learn. "The one
thing I do best in a game is read
my linemen's blocks," he said.
"I just started doing it this year,
and I think it is really the key to
the success I've had."
Even against Florida, when
he was playing with a fractured
hand and stretched knee liga
ments, he managed to grind
out 78 yards. Assistant coach
Perry Mclntyre said that
McClendon is a real inspiration
for the rest of the team. "He
was elected unanimously by
his teammates to be their cap
tain, and he has been a great
leader. He's amazing at prac
tice — he'll do anythng we
ask," Mclntyre said.
Speaking for his team,
McClendon expressed the
Bulldogs' feelings about play
ing in the Bluebonnet Bowl in
stead of the more prestigious
Sugar Bowl. "We weren't at all
disappointed to play Stanford
in the Bluebonnet Bowl, and I
mean that," he said. "It would
be ridiculous to be disap
pointed because we're glad to
play in any bowl we can. Be
sides, we're expecting a great
game in Houston."
And what has the Georgia
team heard about the Cards?
"Well," said McClendon,
"we know they have a running
back with over a thousand
yards, and a big-shot quarter
back. They're supposed to be
pretty good, and I'm sure
they're going to be real tough
to beat."
And does McClendon ex
pect to play professional foot
ball next year?
"Yes," he said, "I'd love to
play if I get a chance. I'd rather
play on a team in a warm cli
mate, but you know, I'd be
more than glad to play for any
team, really."

Raised in Georgia, McClen
don is not too far from home.
In fact, his family had very
much to do with his decision to
attend the University of Geor
gia. "My mom and dad decided
that it would be the best place
for me to go," he said. "I had
offers from Georgia Tech,
North Carolina, Auburn, Kan
sas and Kansas State, but we
decided on Georgia. Coming
here was the second biggest
thing in my life, next to my fam
ily," he said.
One of the most amazing
things about this year's Geor
gia team is its ability to exceed
its apparent potential. Before
this season started sports
scribes predicted that the
Bulldogs would get four vic
tories at the maximum. With

their regular season complete,
they stand with a record of
9-1-1. Last year their record was
5-6, and with a loss of 20 let
termen, things did not look
like they were going to get any
better. The team has surprised
everyone but themselves with
how well they have done this
year.
"Talent-wise," McClendon
said, "there have been better
Georgia teams while I've been
here. But this team is different.
We have a much better attitude
about winning."
Sports question No. 2: To
what extent does football ta
lent run in the family?
The Cardinals will have to
wait until New Year's Eve for
the answer to that question.

"we know they have a running
back with over a thousand
yards, and a big-shot quarter
back. They're supposed to be
pretty good, and I'm sure
they're going to be real tough
to beat."
And does McClendon ex
pect to play professional foot
ball next year?
"Yes," he said, "I'd love to
play if I get a chance. I'd rather
play on a team in a warm cli
mate, but you know, I'd be
more than glad to play for any
team, really."

Raised in Georgia, McClen
don is not too far from home.
In fact, his family had very
much to do with his decision to
attend the University of Geor
gia. "My mom and dad decided
that it would be the best place
for me to go," he said. "I had
offers from Georgia Tech,
North Carolina, Auburn, Kan
sas and Kansas State, but we
decided on Georgia. Coming
here was the second biggest
thing in my life, next to my fam
ily," he said.
One of the most amazing
things about this year's Geor
gia team is its ability to exceed
its apparent potential. Before
this season started sports
scribes predicted that the
Bulldogs would get four vic
tories at the maximum. With

their regular season complete,
they stand with a record of
9-1-1. Last year their record was
5-6, and with a loss of 20 let
termen, things did not look
like they were going to get any
better. The team has surprised
everyone but themselves with
how well they have done this
year.
"Talent-wise," McClendon
said, "there have been better
Georgia teams while I've been
here. But this team is different.
We have a much better attitude
about winning."

All-SEC tailback Willie McClendon poses for his preseason action
shot. McClendon saw lots of live action during the regular season,
however, rushing for 1312 yards and 12 touchdowns, and the
Bulldogs hope he will see even more against the Cardinals at the
Bluebonnet Bowl on New Year's Eve.
Sports question No. 1: What
Southeastern Conference
football player is a distant
cousin of NFL Hall of Famer Jim
Brown?
The answer is Willie
McClendon of the University
of Georgia. He is the captain of
the tough Bulldog team that
will meet Stanford in the
Bluebonnet Bowl New Year's
Eve.
"Little Willie," as his team
mates call him, has had a very
big year. This 6-foot-2, 205-
pound senior running back
carried the ball 287 times this
season for 1312 yards, break
ing a 37-ygar-old Georgia re
cord held by Heisman Trophy
winner Frank Sinkwich.
McClendon's career total of
2228 yards puts him third on
Georgia's all-time rushing list.
He gained more than 100
yards in eight consecutive
games this year, setting a SEC
record. He scored 13 touch
downs rushing, including
his longest, an 81-yard
jaunt against South Carolina.
McClendon's statistics speak
for themselves, to say the least.
However, statistics are not
the only thing that will attest to
the talent of Willie McClen
don. His coaches, and just
about everyone else down in
the SEC, are talking about him.
"Little Willie" was selected by
UPI as the SEC player of the
year, and he was the only
player unanimously voted to
the all-conference team.
"Willie," said Bulldog coach
Vince Dooley, "is certainly one
of the most wonderful players I
have ever coached. He has ex
ceptional size and speed, and
he is a superb blocker.''
Bill Pace, Georgia's offensive
coordinator added that
McClendon's attitude is his
greatest asset. "He works ex
tremely hard at practice. And
most importantly, he's more
concerned about winning for

Georgia than about his own
stats," Pace said.
According to McClendon,
his success this year comes
from something that just takes
experience to learn. "The one
thing I do best in a game is read
my linemen's blocks," he said.
"I just started doing it this year,
and I think it is really the key to
the success I've had."
Even against Florida, when
he was playing with a fractured
hand and stretched knee liga
ments, he managed to grind
out 78 yards. Assistant coach
Perry Mclntyre said that
McClendon is a real inspiration
for the rest of the team. "He
was elected unanimously by
his teammates to be their cap
tain, and he has been a great
leader. He's amazing at prac
tice — he'll do anythng we
ask," Mclntyre said.
Speaking for his team,
McClendon expressed the
Bulldogs' feelings about play
ing in the Bluebonnet Bowl in
stead of the more prestigious
Sugar Bowl. "We weren't at all
disappointed to play Stanford
in the Bluebonnet Bowl, and I
mean that," he said. "It would
be ridiculous to be disap
pointed because we're glad to
play in any bowl we can. Be
sides, we're expecting a great
game in Houston."
And what has the Georgia
team heard about the Cards?
"Well," said McClendon,
"we know they have a running
back with over a thousand
yards, and a big-shot quarter
back. They're supposed to be
pretty good, and I'm sure
they're going to be real tough
to beat."
And does McClendon ex

downs rushing, including
his longest, an 81-yard
jaunt against South Carolina.
McClendon's statistics speak
for themselves, to say the least.
However, statistics are not
the only thing that will attest to
the talent of Willie McClen
don. His coaches, and just
about everyone else down in
the SEC, are talking about him.
"Little Willie" was selected by
UPI as the SEC player of the
year, and he was the only
player unanimously voted to
the all-conference team.
"Willie," said Bulldog coach
Vince Dooley, "is certainly one
of the most wonderful players I
have ever coached. He has ex
ceptional size and speed, and
he is a superb blocker.''
Bill Pace, Georgia's offensive
coordinator added that
McClendon's attitude is his
greatest asset. "He works ex
tremely hard at practice. And
most importantly, he's more
concerned about winning for

Georgia than about his own
stats," Pace said.
According to McClendon,
his success this year comes
from something that just takes
experience to learn. "The one
thing I do best in a game is read
my linemen's blocks," he said.
"I just started doing it this year,
and I think it is really the key to
the success I've had."
Even against Florida, when
he was playing with a fractured
hand and stretched knee liga
ments, he managed to grind
out 78 yards. Assistant coach
Perry Mclntyre said that
McClendon is a real inspiration
for the rest of the team. "He
was elected unanimously by
his teammates to be their cap
tain, and he has been a great
leader. He's amazing at prac
tice — he'll do anythng we
ask," Mclntyre said.
Speaking for his team,
McClendon expressed the
Bulldogs' feelings about play
ing in the Bluebonnet Bowl in
stead of the more prestigious
Sugar Bowl. "We weren't at all
disappointed to play Stanford
in the Bluebonnet Bowl, and I
mean that," he said. "It would
be ridiculous to be disap
pointed because we're glad to
play in any bowl we can. Be
sides, we're expecting a great
game in Houston."
And what has the Georgia
team heard about the Cards?
"Well," said McClendon,
"we know they have a running
back with over a thousand
yards, and a big-shot quarter
back. They're supposed to be
pretty good, and I'm sure
they're going to be real tough
to beat."
And does McClendon ex
pect to play professional foot
ball next year?
"Yes," he said, "I'd love to
play if I get a chance. I'd rather
play on a team in a warm cli
mate, but you know, I'd be
more than glad to play for any
team, really."

Raised in Georgia, McClen
don is not too far from home.
In fact, his family had very
much to do with his decision to
attend the University of Geor
gia. "My mom and dad decided
that it would be the best place
for me to go," he said. "I had
offers from Georgia Tech,
North Carolina, Auburn, Kan
sas and Kansas State, but we
decided on Georgia. Coming
here was the second biggest
thing in my life, next to my fam
ily," he said.
One of the most amazing
things about this year's Geor
gia team is its ability to exceed
its apparent potential. Before
this season started sports
scribes predicted that the
Bulldogs would get four vic
tories at the maximum. With

their regular season complete,
they stand with a record of
9-1-1. Last year their record was
5-6, and with a loss of 20 let
termen, things did not look
like they were going to get any
better. The team has surprised
everyone but themselves with
how well they have done this
year.
"Talent-wise," McClendon
said, "there have been better
Georgia teams while I've been
here. But this team is different.
We have a much better attitude
about winning."
Sports question No. 2: To
what extent does football ta
lent run in the family?
The Cardinals will have to
wait until New Year's Eve for
the answer to that question.

All-SEC tailback Willie McClendon poses for his preseason action
shot. McClendon saw lots of live action during the regular season,
however, rushing for 1312 yards and 12 touchdowns, and the
Bulldogs hope he will see even more against the Cardinals at the
Bluebonnet Bowl on New Year's Eve.
Sports question No. 1: What
Southeastern Conference
football player is a distant
cousin of NFL Hall of Famer Jim
Brown?
The answer is Willie
McClendon of the University
of Georgia. He is the captain of
the tough Bulldog team that
will meet Stanford in the
Bluebonnet Bowl New Year's
Eve.
"Little Willie," as his team
mates call him, has had a very
big year. This 6-foot-2, 205-
pound senior running back
carried the ball 287 times this
season for 1312 yards, break
ing a 37-ygar-old Georgia re
cord held by Heisman Trophy
winner Frank Sinkwich.
McClendon's career total of
2228 yards puts him third on
Georgia's all-time rushing list.
He gained more than 100
yards in eight consecutive
games this year, setting a SEC
record. He scored 13 touch
downs rushing, including
his longest, an 81-yard
jaunt against South Carolina.
