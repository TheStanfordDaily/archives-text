# Sacramento, Nevada-Reno fall to Cards
## Cagers explode with opening victories 
### SALLY JENKINS 
The women's basketball team
opened the season with a bang last
week, defeating Sacramento State,
85-49, and Nevada-Reno, 78-59. The star
of both games was none other than
6-foot-0 freshman Jeanne Ruark.
Ruark's combined statistics were 20
rebounds, 26 for 34 field goal attempts
(76.5 percent) and a 28.5 point average.
Freshman Angie Paccione didn't do
badly either. She averaged 13 points a
game, 5.5 rebounds and 5.0 assists a
game, showing her stuff as an all
around player.
Both games were run-aways, the only
time the team experienced any trouble
being at halftime of the Nevada game
when they trailed 30-28. But the final

score indicates that it didn't last for
long.
The Cardinals committed 22 turnov
ers in the first half, going into the locker
room down by two points. What hap
pened?
"I think they went into the game
overly confident, because we really did
blow Sacramento away," Stanford
coach Dottie McCrea said. "We played
an awful first half, and I think that's
evidence of our inexperience.
"I told them that we were going to be
facing a lot tougher teams, and they
were going to have to get used to it.
"But they know what they've done
before you tell them. We got a lot of
experience out of that game. The first
nine played well. We got good support

from the bench," McCrea added.
The first-half turnovers were offset by
excellent rebounding. In the second
half they atoned for their first-half mis
takes by scoring 50 points to Nevada's
29.
Angie Paccione played a particularly
awesome game scoring 20 points,
grabbing nine rebounds and contribut
ing eight steals and six assists.
Kathy Murphy, filling in for the in
jured Louise Smith, was particularly ef
fective on the boards, pulling down 14
boards, and scoring 11 points as well.
The Cards out rebounded Nevada 56 to
28. Not bad for a bunch of freshmen.
Ruark was undoubtedly one of the
deciding factors in both victories. Ac
cording to coach McCrea, though, the

team won't have to rely on her as much
in the future.
"I don't think she will have to carry
the scoring burden so much. She's
going to score, but we aren't looking to
her to score so much every game."
McCrea is satisfied with her team's
performance.
"Angie played phenomenally,"
McCrea said. "If she plays up to her
potential she's going to be a great asset
to the team. She just needs to build up
her confidence and get used to playing
college ball. I think we'regoing to bring
a lot of excitement to women's basket
ball at Stanford that it hasn't had be
fore. We should definitely win our
league. It's just a matter of time and
experience."

"I told them that we were going to be
facing a lot tougher teams, and they
were going to have to get used to it.
"But they know what they've done
before you tell them. We got a lot of
experience out of that game. The first
nine played well. We got good support

from the bench," McCrea added.
The first-half turnovers were offset by
excellent rebounding. In the second
half they atoned for their first-half mis
takes by scoring 50 points to Nevada's
29.
Angie Paccione played a particularly
awesome game scoring 20 points,
grabbing nine rebounds and contribut
ing eight steals and six assists.
Kathy Murphy, filling in for the in
jured Louise Smith, was particularly ef
fective on the boards, pulling down 14
boards, and scoring 11 points as well.
The Cards out rebounded Nevada 56 to
28. Not bad for a bunch of freshmen.
Ruark was undoubtedly one of the
deciding factors in both victories. Ac
cording to coach McCrea, though, the

team won't have to rely on her as much
in the future.
"I don't think she will have to carry
the scoring burden so much. She's
going to score, but we aren't looking to
her to score so much every game."
McCrea is satisfied with her team's
performance.
"Angie played phenomenally,"
McCrea said. "If she plays up to her
potential she's going to be a great asset
to the team. She just needs to build up
her confidence and get used to playing
college ball. I think we'regoing to bring
a lot of excitement to women's basket
ball at Stanford that it hasn't had be
fore. We should definitely win our
league. It's just a matter of time and
experience."

Stanford's Stephanie Galef drives for a lay-up in a game last year
against Biola College. Stanford's women cagers opened the season
with convincing victories over Sacramento State, 85-49, and
Nevada-Reno, 78-59.
The women's basketball team
opened the season with a bang last
week, defeating Sacramento State,
85-49, and Nevada-Reno, 78-59. The star
of both games was none other than
6-foot-0 freshman Jeanne Ruark.
Ruark's combined statistics were 20
rebounds, 26 for 34 field goal attempts
(76.5 percent) and a 28.5 point average.
Freshman Angie Paccione didn't do
badly either. She averaged 13 points a
game, 5.5 rebounds and 5.0 assists a
game, showing her stuff as an all
around player.
Both games were run-aways, the only
time the team experienced any trouble
being at halftime of the Nevada game
when they trailed 30-28. But the final

score indicates that it didn't last for
long.
The Cardinals committed 22 turnov
ers in the first half, going into the locker
room down by two points. What hap
pened?
"I think they went into the game
overly confident, because we really did
blow Sacramento away," Stanford
coach Dottie McCrea said. "We played
an awful first half, and I think that's
evidence of our inexperience.
"I told them that we were going to be
facing a lot tougher teams, and they
were going to have to get used to it.
