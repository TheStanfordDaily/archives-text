# Win 'A' title, 24-zip
## Zetes roll Thumpty Dumps 
### RICK OSTILLER 
If there were any doubts
about the best IM football
team, the top-seeded Zetes
answered all questions when
they routed the Theta Delts,
24-0, to take the "A" league
title Sunday.
Top seeds also triumphed in
the other three divisions. Off
the Wall Gang took the "B"
championship for the second
straightyearwitha6-0 win over
the Ghetto, while Taste of
Honey gathered in both the
coed and women's league
crowns.
Taste of Honey upended High
Energy, 20-0, for the women's
title and the champs combined
with some of the Off the Wall
Gang to edge Recycling Works,
13-12, for the coed champion
ship.
But the Zetes stole the show.
They opened their bag of tricks
during the pre-game with a
piped-in version of the na
tional anthem. The shenani
gans continued throughout
the contest as they had a fake
camera and crew covering the
game and holding sideline in
terviews a/a ABC.
The game itself had few
pranks and was simply an
example of one team dominat
ing another. Zete quarterback
John McColl fired touchdown
passes to Steve Kuptz and Gary
McKitterick to give the Zetes a
12-0 lead at half, and scored
two times himself to close out
the Zete scoring in the second
half.

Meanwhile, the Theta Delts
were completely bottled up by
the Zete defense after their
opening drive of the first half.
Defensively, they limited their
effectiveness to extra points.
Some players had ques
tioned whether the Zetes
could beat "B" top seed Off
the Wall Gang, but after the fi
nals, a better question asked
how the Theta Delts escaped
with only a 6-0 defeat to the
Zetes during the regular sea
son.
The "B" championship was a
surprisingly low scoring affair.
Both teams had rolled up more
than 30 points a game during
the regular season, and neither
had appeared as strong on de
fense as they had on offense.
However, there were no
points scored in the first half,
as the Ghetto defense continu
ally thwarted Off the Wall Gang
with interceptions and quar
terback sacks. The Ghetto's of
fense started several drives but
they all stalled short of the end
zone.
The second half nearly mir
rored the first. The Ghetto con
trolled the game but the inabil
ity of either team to score made
overtime appear likely with
two minutes left to play.
At that point, however,
OTWG took off on the only
sustained drive of the contest.
Behind the passing and run
ning of quarterback Phil Wil
son, OTWG moved into
Ghetto territory and with a lit
tle more than a minute remain

ing, Wilson connected with
Scott Laurence for the winning
touchdown.
The Ghetto tried to rally,
driving to a first down near
midfield, but a last-second in
terception ended its threat and
preserved Off the Wall Gang's
second straight "B" title.
The women's championship
was a rematch of the regular
season game in which Taste of
Honey beat High Energy, 15-0.
The final was not much diffe
rent as Taste of Honey, led by
quarterback Diane Sheng,
again proved too much for
High Energy.
Sheng threw touchdown
passes to Elaine Levin and
Shawn Hoover as Taste of
Honey rolled to a 13-0 halftime
bulge. In the second half, she
came back with her third scor
ing pass; this time to Dana
Padden.
Taste of Honey finished the
year undefeated against Stan
ford competition, although the
women did suffer a tough 13-2
defeat to the top team from
California.
An inability to convert extra
points proved Recycling
Work's undoing as the Taste of
Honey women and the Off the
Wall Gang men teamed up to
take the coed title, 13-12.
The Works opened the game
quickly, scoring on a bomb from
quarterback Jerry Ford to
Danny Villanueva on the
game's second play. The extra
point attempt failed.
Taste of Honey retaliated as
quarterback Michael
Zboralske found Joe LoPresti
for the tying touchdown mid
way through the first half. The
conversion was good, and this
proved to be the difference.
Late in the first half, Recycl
ing Works grabbed the lead
back as Ford again found Vil
lanueva for the score. The
Works botched the PAT again,
however, and they had to settle
for a 12-7 halftime edge.
Both teams were sluggish at
the outset of the second half,
but Taste of Honey was able to
mount the go-ahead drive
midway through the period.
Zboralske again hit LoPresti
for the score, and the missed
conversion left Taste of Honey
with a slim 13-12 lead.
There was plenty of time for
the Works to rally, but Taste of
Honey's defense stiffened,
forcing Recycling Works to
give up the ball.
After the change of posses
sion, Zboralske deftly ran out
the clock and all Taste of
Honey players could savor
their second championship of
the day.

Honey players could savor
their second championship of
the day.
If there were any doubts
about the best IM football
team, the top-seeded Zetes
answered all questions when
they routed the Theta Delts,
24-0, to take the "A" league
title Sunday.
Top seeds also triumphed in
the other three divisions. Off
the Wall Gang took the "B"
championship for the second
straightyearwitha6-0 win over
the Ghetto, while Taste of
Honey gathered in both the
coed and women's league
crowns.
Taste of Honey upended High
Energy, 20-0, for the women's
title and the champs combined
with some of the Off the Wall
Gang to edge Recycling Works,
13-12, for the coed champion
ship.
But the Zetes stole the show.
They opened their bag of tricks
during the pre-game with a
piped-in version of the na
tional anthem. The shenani
gans continued throughout
the contest as they had a fake
camera and crew covering the
game and holding sideline in
terviews a/a ABC.
The game itself had few
pranks and was simply an
example of one team dominat
ing another. Zete quarterback
John McColl fired touchdown
passes to Steve Kuptz and Gary
McKitterick to give the Zetes a
12-0 lead at half, and scored
two times himself to close out
the Zete scoring in the second
half.

Meanwhile, the Theta Delts
were completely bottled up by
the Zete defense after their
opening drive of the first half.
Defensively, they limited their
effectiveness to extra points.
Some players had ques
tioned whether the Zetes
could beat "B" top seed Off
the Wall Gang, but after the fi
nals, a better question asked
how the Theta Delts escaped
with only a 6-0 defeat to the
Zetes during the regular sea
son.
The "B" championship was a
surprisingly low scoring affair.
Both teams had rolled up more
than 30 points a game during
the regular season, and neither
had appeared as strong on de
fense as they had on offense.
However, there were no
points scored in the first half,
as the Ghetto defense continu
ally thwarted Off the Wall Gang
with interceptions and quar
terback sacks. The Ghetto's of
fense started several drives but
they all stalled short of the end
zone.
The second half nearly mir
rored the first. The Ghetto con
trolled the game but the inabil
ity of either team to score made
overtime appear likely with
two minutes left to play.
At that point, however,
OTWG took off on the only
sustained drive of the contest.
Behind the passing and run
ning of quarterback Phil Wil
son, OTWG moved into
Ghetto territory and with a lit
tle more than a minute remain

ing, Wilson connected with
Scott Laurence for the winning
touchdown.
The Ghetto tried to rally,
driving to a first down near
midfield, but a last-second in
terception ended its threat and
preserved Off the Wall Gang's
second straight "B" title.
The women's championship
was a rematch of the regular
season game in which Taste of
Honey beat High Energy, 15-0.
The final was not much diffe
rent as Taste of Honey, led by
quarterback Diane Sheng,
again proved too much for
High Energy.
Sheng threw touchdown
passes to Elaine Levin and
Shawn Hoover as Taste of
Honey rolled to a 13-0 halftime
bulge. In the second half, she
came back with her third scor
ing pass; this time to Dana
Padden.
Taste of Honey finished the
year undefeated against Stan
ford competition, although the
women did suffer a tough 13-2
defeat to the top team from
California.
An inability to convert extra
points proved Recycling
Work's undoing as the Taste of
Honey women and the Off the
Wall Gang men teamed up to
take the coed title, 13-12.
The Works opened the game
quickly, scoring on a bomb from
quarterback Jerry Ford to
Danny Villanueva on the
game's second play. The extra
point attempt failed.
Taste of Honey retaliated as
quarterback Michael
Zboralske found Joe LoPresti
for the tying touchdown mid
way through the first half. The
conversion was good, and this
proved to be the difference.
Late in the first half, Recycl
ing Works grabbed the lead
back as Ford again found Vil
lanueva for the score. The
Works botched the PAT again,
however, and they had to settle
for a 12-7 halftime edge.
Both teams were sluggish at
the outset of the second half,
but Taste of Honey was able to
mount the go-ahead drive
midway through the period.
Zboralske again hit LoPresti
for the score, and the missed
conversion left Taste of Honey
with a slim 13-12 lead.
There was plenty of time for
the Works to rally, but Taste of
Honey's defense stiffened,
forcing Recycling Works to
give up the ball.
After the change of posses
sion, Zboralske deftly ran out
the clock and all Taste of

the clock and all Taste of
Honey players could savor
their second championship of
the day.
If there were any doubts
about the best IM football
team, the top-seeded Zetes
answered all questions when
they routed the Theta Delts,
24-0, to take the "A" league
title Sunday.
Top seeds also triumphed in
the other three divisions. Off
the Wall Gang took the "B"
championship for the second
straightyearwitha6-0 win over
the Ghetto, while Taste of
Honey gathered in both the
coed and women's league
crowns.
Taste of Honey upended High
Energy, 20-0, for the women's
title and the champs combined
with some of the Off the Wall
Gang to edge Recycling Works,
13-12, for the coed champion
ship.
But the Zetes stole the show.
They opened their bag of tricks
during the pre-game with a
piped-in version of the na
tional anthem. The shenani
gans continued throughout
the contest as they had a fake
camera and crew covering the
game and holding sideline in
terviews a/a ABC.
The game itself had few
pranks and was simply an
example of one team dominat
ing another. Zete quarterback
John McColl fired touchdown
passes to Steve Kuptz and Gary
McKitterick to give the Zetes a
12-0 lead at half, and scored
two times himself to close out
the Zete scoring in the second
half.

Meanwhile, the Theta Delts
were completely bottled up by
the Zete defense after their
opening drive of the first half.
Defensively, they limited their
effectiveness to extra points.
Some players had ques
tioned whether the Zetes
could beat "B" top seed Off
the Wall Gang, but after the fi
nals, a better question asked
how the Theta Delts escaped
with only a 6-0 defeat to the
Zetes during the regular sea
son.
The "B" championship was a
surprisingly low scoring affair.
Both teams had rolled up more
than 30 points a game during
the regular season, and neither
had appeared as strong on de
fense as they had on offense.
However, there were no
points scored in the first half,
as the Ghetto defense continu
ally thwarted Off the Wall Gang
with interceptions and quar
terback sacks. The Ghetto's of
fense started several drives but
they all stalled short of the end
zone.
The second half nearly mir
rored the first. The Ghetto con
trolled the game but the inabil
ity of either team to score made
overtime appear likely with
two minutes left to play.
At that point, however,
OTWG took off on the only
sustained drive of the contest.
Behind the passing and run
ning of quarterback Phil Wil
son, OTWG moved into
Ghetto territory and with a lit
tle more than a minute remain

ing, Wilson connected with
Scott Laurence for the winning
touchdown.
The Ghetto tried to rally,
driving to a first down near
midfield, but a last-second in
terception ended its threat and
preserved Off the Wall Gang's
second straight "B" title.
The women's championship
was a rematch of the regular
season game in which Taste of
Honey beat High Energy, 15-0.
The final was not much diffe
rent as Taste of Honey, led by
quarterback Diane Sheng,
again proved too much for
High Energy.
Sheng threw touchdown
passes to Elaine Levin and
Shawn Hoover as Taste of
Honey rolled to a 13-0 halftime
bulge. In the second half, she
came back with her third scor
ing pass; this time to Dana
Padden.
Taste of Honey finished the
year undefeated against Stan
ford competition, although the
women did suffer a tough 13-2
defeat to the top team from
California.
An inability to convert extra
points proved Recycling
Work's undoing as the Taste of
Honey women and the Off the
Wall Gang men teamed up to
take the coed title, 13-12.
The Works opened the game
quickly, scoring on a bomb from
quarterback Jerry Ford to
Danny Villanueva on the
game's second play. The extra
point attempt failed.
Taste of Honey retaliated as
quarterback Michael
Zboralske found Joe LoPresti
for the tying touchdown mid
way through the first half. The
conversion was good, and this
proved to be the difference.
Late in the first half, Recycl
ing Works grabbed the lead
back as Ford again found Vil
lanueva for the score. The
Works botched the PAT again,
however, and they had to settle
for a 12-7 halftime edge.
Both teams were sluggish at
the outset of the second half,
but Taste of Honey was able to
mount the go-ahead drive
midway through the period.
Zboralske again hit LoPresti
for the score, and the missed
conversion left Taste of Honey
with a slim 13-12 lead.
There was plenty of time for
the Works to rally, but Taste of
Honey's defense stiffened,
forcing Recycling Works to
give up the ball.
After the change of posses
sion, Zboralske deftly ran out
the clock and all Taste of
Honey players could savor
their second championship of
the day.
