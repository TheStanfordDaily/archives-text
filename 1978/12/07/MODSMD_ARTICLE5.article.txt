# Repairs to wet books may take through fall
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
While some of the books and
periodicals which were damaged by
the Nov. 4 flood in the Meyer Under
graduate Library Basement may be
returned to circulation winter quar
ter, the majority are not expected to
be ready for use until spring or even
summer quarter, according to a re
port released by Director of Univer
sity Libraries David Weber.
Until the University is able to re
store or replace some 40,000 dam
aged items librarians here "...will go
to great lengths to assist faculty and
students who need to find substitute
access foi materials presently out of
circulation," the report said.
"The cooperative program with

(UC-) Berkeley will be of immense
value during this year," it stated.
Weber said, in explaining the re
port, that the Universiy does recip
rocal borrowing with libraries all
over North America, but added, "We
prefer to obtain materials within
California and the West." The report
warned that some loans may require
one to three months to obtain if lib
rarians are forced to look outside the
Bay Area. "There will be a very li
mited purchase of additional copies
where those are vitally needed...,"
the report said.
Weber said hecannot besurewhat
the cost of replacing and restoring
damaged materials will be, but
thought that it is certain to cost in the
tens of thousands of dollars. Weber
explained that the books cannot be
inspected until they are dried, after
which time the University will be able
to determine which materials can be
immediately reshelved, which will
need to be rebound and which will
require more expensive methods of
restoration or even replacement.
All the damaged materials are cur
rently resting in freezers at the Mod
ern Ice and Cold Storage Co. in San
Jose. They were shipped therewithin
48 hours of the mishap to suspend all
biological and chemical action and
thus avoid damaging mold and mil
dew growth.
The report said that "vacuum
chambers have been found on the
Peninsula for drying." Which one
will be used has yet to be deter
mined, Weber said.
After the books have been dried,
they cannot be opened for a month
while they sit in 50 percent humidity,
so that they can reacquire their nor
mal moisture content of five to seven
percent, the report explained.

"(l)ronically" the report continued,
"the best current treatment dries
them out too much, and they must
be humidified a bit after drying to
return them to an adeuqately flexible
state of use."
The drying process is expected to
begin in January according to Weber.
Robert Beth, director of risk man
agement and insurance said Univer
sity lawyers are looking into the mis
hap to see where the responsibility
lies. The broken water main which
caused the damage was installed 12
years ago, but the current contractor
working on the building had rut
holes in the Meyer Basement wall in
order to link the new section of
Green Library with utilities. The con
tractor failed to put temporary plugs
in the holes through which the water
from the broken main was then able
to flow, Beth has said.
Beth said he is still waiting for a
metallurgist's report to determine
the cause of the break. He said
lawyers are examining the contracts
of both the current contractor and
the one who installed the pipe.
"Obviously, if there'sacase, we're
going to pursue it,"he stated.
The collections hardest hit were
those in philosophy, but there was
also considerable damage to collec
tions in religious studies and in Latin
American, German and Slavic and
East European studies.
Most of the books should be avail
able for use by next fall, according to
the report.

biological and chemical action and
thus avoid damaging mold and mil
dew growth.
The report said that "vacuum
chambers have been found on the
Peninsula for drying." Which one
will be used has yet to be deter
mined, Weber said.
After the books have been dried,
they cannot be opened for a month
while they sit in 50 percent humidity,
so that they can reacquire their nor
mal moisture content of five to seven
percent, the report explained.

"(l)ronically" the report continued,
"the best current treatment dries
them out too much, and they must
be humidified a bit after drying to
return them to an adeuqately flexible
state of use."
The drying process is expected to
begin in January according to Weber.
Robert Beth, director of risk man
agement and insurance said Univer
sity lawyers are looking into the mis
hap to see where the responsibility
lies. The broken water main which
caused the damage was installed 12
years ago, but the current contractor
working on the building had rut
holes in the Meyer Basement wall in
order to link the new section of
Green Library with utilities. The con
tractor failed to put temporary plugs
in the holes through which the water
from the broken main was then able
to flow, Beth has said.
Beth said he is still waiting for a
metallurgist's report to determine
the cause of the break. He said
lawyers are examining the contracts
of both the current contractor and
the one who installed the pipe.
"Obviously, if there'sacase, we're
going to pursue it,"he stated.
The collections hardest hit were
those in philosophy, but there was
also considerable damage to collec
tions in religious studies and in Latin
American, German and Slavic and
East European studies.
Most of the books should be avail
able for use by next fall, according to
the report.

Two inspectors examine a water main which broke flooding the basement of
Meyer Library last month.
While some of the books and
periodicals which were damaged by
the Nov. 4 flood in the Meyer Under
graduate Library Basement may be
returned to circulation winter quar
ter, the majority are not expected to
be ready for use until spring or even
summer quarter, according to a re
port released by Director of Univer
sity Libraries David Weber.
Until the University is able to re
store or replace some 40,000 dam
aged items librarians here "...will go
to great lengths to assist faculty and
students who need to find substitute
access foi materials presently out of
circulation," the report said.
"The cooperative program with

(UC-) Berkeley will be of immense
value during this year," it stated.
Weber said, in explaining the re
port, that the Universiy does recip
rocal borrowing with libraries all
over North America, but added, "We
prefer to obtain materials within
California and the West." The report
warned that some loans may require
one to three months to obtain if lib
rarians are forced to look outside the
Bay Area. "There will be a very li
mited purchase of additional copies
where those are vitally needed...,"
the report said.
Weber said hecannot besurewhat
the cost of replacing and restoring
damaged materials will be, but
thought that it is certain to cost in the
tens of thousands of dollars. Weber
explained that the books cannot be
inspected until they are dried, after
which time the University will be able
to determine which materials can be
immediately reshelved, which will
need to be rebound and which will
require more expensive methods of
restoration or even replacement.
All the damaged materials are cur
rently resting in freezers at the Mod
ern Ice and Cold Storage Co. in San
Jose. They were shipped therewithin
48 hours of the mishap to suspend all
biological and chemical action and
thus avoid damaging mold and mil
dew growth.
