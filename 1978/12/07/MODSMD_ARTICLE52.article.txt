## Card men dominate Invite swim 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
Stanford swim coach Jim
Caughran had stars in his eyes
following last weekend's Stan
ford Invitational Champion
ships at deGuerre pool.
The chances of Stanford's
women winning the AIAW na
tional title "look good," he
said. He also said that a top 10
NCAA finish remains a distinct
possibility for the men's team.
The invitational featured
more than 20 outstanding AAU
and university teams and pro
duced some of the fastest
times of the early short-course
season.
Gaughran underscored that,
although the women were not
rested, their results were
"quite exceptional" against a
well-prepared team of Mission
Viejo Nadadores.
Before getting knocked out
by illness Sunday, freshman
standout Linda Jezek racked up
five individual victories and
shattered both Stanford and

pool records with each win.
Her 400 individual medley time
of 4:22.82 smashed the de-
Guerre and team marks by 10
and six seconds, respectively.
She also stroked to firsts in the
200 backstroke (2:02.43), the
200 individual medley (2:06.24)
the 100 butterfly (56.80) and the
100 backstroke (57.55) as well
as competing on the winning
200 medley, 800 freestyle and
400 medley relays.
junior Kim Peyton overcame
Mission Viejo's Jennifer
Hooker to culminate a "good
meet" with a first-place finish
in the 100 freestyle (51.95).
Frustrated by three narrow
losses to Sweden's Ingela
Havaas, freshman
breaststroker Noel Moran
nevertheless set Stanford re
cords in the 50 breast (30.89),
100 breast (1:07.18) and 200
breast (2:22.49).
Caughran lauded tri-captain
and distance-freestyler Jo

Clark for inspired swims and
praised freshman Libby
Beaudet. This meet "con
firmed what we already knew
— that the women are very
strong," he said.
In contrast to the women,
some of the men had tapered
and shaved to try for NCAA
qualifying standards.
Junior Bob Hagberg raced to
the nation's top 100 butterfly
time (49.6) of the season while
attaining an NCAA qualifica
tion. Joe Jimenez glided to a
100 breaststroke triumph and
NCAA-qualifying time of 58.01.
Junior Ken Shilling also
churned to qualifying times
with a second in the 200 indi
vidual medley (1:53.16) and a
first in the 200 breaststroke
(2:05.88).
Overall, the Cardinals domi
nated the men's portion of the
meet as evidenced by their
1-2-3- sweep in the 100 but
terfly, the 100 breast and the

200 fly plus their 1-2 finish in all
three relays.
Caughran said team leader
Mike Bruner achieved his best
times, rested and unshaved, in
a first-place 500 freestyle
(4:27.73) and a runner-up spot
in the 200 butterfly (1:49.87).
Monte Brown swam his best
unshaved 1650 free (15:30.54),
and freshman Jeff Stiling just
missed NCAA cut-offs in three
events.
Senior Jim Belardi swim ex
tremely quick times in the pre
liminary heatsand in hisvictory
in the 200 butterfly (1:49.82).
The 400 freestyle relay success
fully qualified for NCAA com
petition in 3:04.0 with splits
from members John Kingery
(46.1), Mike Anderson (46.0),
Sam Franklin (45.9) and Hag
berg (45.9).
Gaughran said the team will
train through finals and return
from a Christmas journey to
Hawaii, before beginning the
regular season.
