## 
### ROBERT REED 
Veteran guard Wolfe Perry
scored a career-high 28 points
to lead Stanford to a 74-63 past
ing of the UC-Santa Barbara
Gauchos in basketball action at
Maples Pavilion Saturday
night.
After a sluggish offensive
start against a Gaucho zone,
Stanford began to open things
up with about five minutes
gone in the first half as Perry's

bombs from the outside de
stroyed Santa Barbara's zone.
Surprisingly, however, the
Cards' offensive surge seemed
directly related to the arrival in
the game of freshman guard
Doug Marty, who came in with
17:05 to go in the first half to
replace Daryle Morgan, a star
ter in place of an injured Pal
Giovacchini. Under the influ
ence of Marty's inspired play,
the Cards were able to build a

lead of up to 14 in the first half,
Marty started the second half
and remained in charge of the
offense throughout the rest of
the game.
The 6-foot-2 freshman got
his chance because of the
Gaucho zone.
"Doug Marty plays well
against the zone," said Stan
ford coach Dick Dißiaso, "And
we were up. So it was good to
have him get playing time."

The Cards, who played both
well and poorlyduringthe con
test, were also supported by
the strong defensive and re
bounding efforts of Kimberly
Belton and newcomer Orlando
Ward, whose energetic play
kept him in the lineup most of
the game.
"Orlando Ward did some
things out there that we hadn't
seen before," Dißiaso said,
explaining that Ward crashed
the boards hard from the out
side and snagged rebounds
nobody expected him to get.
Ward finished with a game
high 11 rebounds.
"I was very happy with Ward
and Marty," said Dißiaso, who
wasn't quite as happy with the
performance of his team as a
whole.
"I was pleased with the out
come {of the game), but not
with how we performed," Di-
Biaso said. The coach said he
felt his team was much better
than the Gaucho squad and
that he had hoped it would do a
better job of showing that.
Indeed, the Gauchos in the
first half looked disorganized
and uninspired, falling to a
36-24 halftime deficit. Stanford
center Tom Schmalzried's
jumper off the second-half tip
raised the Card lead to 14. But
the Gauchos, led by guard Matt
Maderos and his five straiht
buckets, cut a 14-point Cardi
nal lead to an eight-point de
ficit, 42-34, as Santa Barbara fi
nally came to life.
The Gauchos threatened
throughout the final stanza,
cutting the Card lead to four
points at 65-61 with 1:46 to go.
But at that stage, Wolfe Perry
took command of the game.
Perry continually brought
the ball upcourt safely against
the Gauchos' full-court press
and, once upcourt, the veteran
forced the Gauchos to foul
him, giving him and the Cards
the easy free throws.
Perry's steal of an errant
Bronco pass and ensuing
break-away layup boosted the
Cards to a 69-61 lead with 1:22
remaining to shatter what little
hope Santa Barbara re
tained.

17:05 to go in the first half to
replace Daryle Morgan, a star
ter in place of an injured Pal
Giovacchini. Under the influ
ence of Marty's inspired play,
the Cards were able to build a

lead of up to 14 in the first half,
Marty started the second half
and remained in charge of the
offense throughout the rest of
the game.
The 6-foot-2 freshman got
his chance because of the
Gaucho zone.
"Doug Marty plays well
against the zone," said Stan
ford coach Dick Dißiaso, "And
we were up. So it was good to
have him get playing time."

The Cards, who played both
well and poorlyduringthe con
test, were also supported by
the strong defensive and re
bounding efforts of Kimberly
Belton and newcomer Orlando
Ward, whose energetic play
kept him in the lineup most of
the game.
"Orlando Ward did some
things out there that we hadn't
seen before," Dißiaso said,
explaining that Ward crashed
the boards hard from the out
side and snagged rebounds
nobody expected him to get.
Ward finished with a game
high 11 rebounds.
"I was very happy with Ward
and Marty," said Dißiaso, who
wasn't quite as happy with the
performance of his team as a
whole.
"I was pleased with the out
come {of the game), but not
with how we performed," Di-
Biaso said. The coach said he
felt his team was much better
than the Gaucho squad and
that he had hoped it would do a
better job of showing that.
Indeed, the Gauchos in the
first half looked disorganized
and uninspired, falling to a
36-24 halftime deficit. Stanford
center Tom Schmalzried's
jumper off the second-half tip
raised the Card lead to 14. But
the Gauchos, led by guard Matt
Maderos and his five straiht
buckets, cut a 14-point Cardi
nal lead to an eight-point de
ficit, 42-34, as Santa Barbara fi
nally came to life.
The Gauchos threatened
throughout the final stanza,
cutting the Card lead to four
points at 65-61 with 1:46 to go.
But at that stage, Wolfe Perry
took command of the game.
Perry continually brought
the ball upcourt safely against
the Gauchos' full-court press
and, once upcourt, the veteran
forced the Gauchos to foul
him, giving him and the Cards
the easy free throws.
Perry's steal of an errant
Bronco pass and ensuing
break-away layup boosted the
Cards to a 69-61 lead with 1:22
remaining to shatter what little
hope Santa Barbara re
tained.
Veteran guard Wolfe Perry
scored a career-high 28 points
to lead Stanford to a 74-63 past
ing of the UC-Santa Barbara
Gauchos in basketball action at
Maples Pavilion Saturday
night.
After a sluggish offensive
start against a Gaucho zone,
Stanford began to open things
up with about five minutes
gone in the first half as Perry's

bombs from the outside de
stroyed Santa Barbara's zone.
Surprisingly, however, the
Cards' offensive surge seemed
directly related to the arrival in
the game of freshman guard
Doug Marty, who came in with
17:05 to go in the first half to
replace Daryle Morgan, a star
ter in place of an injured Pal
Giovacchini. Under the influ
