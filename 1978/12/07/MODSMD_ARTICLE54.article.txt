# Shriners host season finale
## All-stars come to the Farm 
### ROBERT REED 
With the only game remaining for this sea
son's edition of the Stanford Cardinal football
team being its New Year's Eve match-up with
Georgia in the Bluebonnet BcHvl in Houston, the
Cards have played their last game of the season
in Stanford Stadium. But the Stadium isn't quite
ready to be closed down until track season.
The East-West Shrine Game, featuring 60 of the
finest senior college football players from each
side of the Mississippi, will be held at Stanford
Stadium on January 6 beginning at noon.
The Shrine game, considered by many to be
one of the top all-star games around, is the old
est all-star game in America, and the second
oldest post-season football contest in the na
tion. No. 1 is, of course, the Rose Bowl.
Sponsored by the Sh riners, the game is played
annually for the benefit of the Shriners' Hospi
tals For Crippled Children, where no child has
ever paid a cent for the care he's received.
Last year, the Shrine game raised over
$190,000 for the hospitals, and in the last 53
years, this all-star contest has contributed over
$7Vi million to the Shriners' Hospitals through
out Northern California.
Because of the benevolent nature of the con
test, and unlike some other senior all-star
games, players participating in the Shrine game
receive no money for playing in what has been
called "Football's Finest Hour."
Over the years, 84 players from Stanford have
participated in the classic, and this year there
will be two more, quarterback Steve Dils and
inside linebacker Gordy Ceresino.
Being selected to play in the Shrine Game is
just one of the many honors that have or will be
bestowed upon many of the participating
athletes, but there is something extra special
about this one, particularly for the Cards that
will play.
"I'm happy to be playing in it," said Ceresino,
referring to the Shrine game, "It's gonna be
kinda nice to end up playing in an all-star game

at Stanford Stadium...before the hometown
fans."
Joining Ceresino and Dils in the game will be
some players not quite so accustomed to
Stanford Stadium.
Among them will be defensive end Ralph De-
Loach from California, tight end Kellen Winslow
of Liberty Bowl-bound Missouri, running back
Willie McClendon from the same Georgia team
that will play the Cards in the Bluebonnet Bowl,
as well as three players from the No. 1-ranked
Penn St. Nittany Lions, among them All-America
offensive tackle Keith Donery.
The West players are selected by a committee
that begins its search in early summer by send
ing out nomination letters to every head coach
west of the Mississippi, asking them to nomi
nate their four top seniors. The East team selec
tion follows a similar procedure.
Cross-checking with opposing coaches and
pro scouts yields a stable priority list ranking the
players by position, two-thirds of the way
through the season. At the end of the season, 30
invitations are issued from each selection com
mittee through the coaches.
Since the Shrine game has traditionally
utilized a passing game, players are selected on
their ability to fit into the offensive and defen
sive plans of the coaches as well as on the basis
of their talent.
Neither East nor West squad is complete yet,
as players still are deciding between this game,
the Hula Bowl — which is played on the same
day — and blissful rest and relaxation which
many may need after a long, hard season.
Coaching for the West will be Claude Gilbert
of San Diego State. The coach of the East has not
yet been selected.
The game will be blacked out locally unless
the game is sold out well in advance. A crowd of
65,000 showed up for last year's classic.
Tickets are available in the Athletic Depart
ment.
