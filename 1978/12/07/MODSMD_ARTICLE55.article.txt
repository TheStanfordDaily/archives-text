# From the pigskin to the scalpel
## An ex-pro still in operation 
### ROBERT RUDY 
Most quarterbacks would be downright
euphoric after throwing nine touchdowns
and leading their team to an 86-65 victory.
But not Don Bunce.
As he sips a fruit punch and orange juice
concoction, Bunce is wondering exactly
how sore his muscles will be the next
morning. After all, this was his first pick-up
game in six weeks; just playing around
with some friends on a brisk Sunday after
noon. *
Seven years ago Bunce was playing for
keepsas starting quarterback for Stanford.
Bunce led his team to a 9-3 record, capped
by a 13-12 Rose Bowl victory over Michi
gan.
Personal glory did not elude Bunce in
1971 either as he topped the Pacific-8 Con
ference in.passing and total offense and
received the Voit Memorial Trophy as the
outstanding player on the West Coast.
Moments of fame, however, are mixed
with membries of frustration for Bunce.
For two years Bunce played back-up quar
terback to Jim Plunkett, Stanford's sole re
cipient of the coveted Heisman Trophy.
"Yeah, I was frustrated," said Bunce,
almost matter-of-factly, "I really thought I
was just as good as he was. If you're going
to play college or pro football, you have to
believe that you're the best."
Plunkett agreed. "If you're going to
play," said the Oakland Raider quarter
back, "you got to believe you're good.
And I know Don did. He's a competitive
person just like everyone else."
Was Bunce jealous? "Sure," said Plun
kett, "who wouldn't be in that kindof situ
ation?"
Bunce still has vivid memories of two
such situations. Substituting foran injured
Plunkett one Saturday afternoon in 1969,
Bunce spearheaded a Stanford victory
with two 80-yard touchdown passes to re
ceiver Gene Washington.
"I was named Pac-8 Player-of-the-
Week," recalled Bunce, "but the next
week I was back on the bench.''

Bunce smiled as he thought back on the
1971 Rose Bowl. He shared a locker with
Plunkett, the hero of Stanford's upset vic
tory over Ohio State. Returning to his
locker "stark-ass naked" after a post-game
shower, he found Plunkett and his locker
engulfed by reporters and photographers.
By the time he had patiently waited forthe
crowd to clear, Bunce had missed the team
bus back to the hotel, and he and his wife
were forced to walk home.
The following year Stanford again
played in the New Year's Day Classic, but it
was a much different story for Bunce.

''If you're going to play col
lege or pro football, you
have to believe you're the
best." -Don Bunce

Completing 24 of 44 passes for 294 yards,
Bunce engineered a game-winning drive
in the final three minutes of the game to
give Stanford its triumph over previously
unbeaten Michigan.
The soft-spoken Bunce said he liked
football for "the excitement of being on
the spot." He characterized himself as
being "terribly shy, so football served as a
healthy expression for all my pent-up feel
ings.
"But the nicest thing about the whole
experience," he added, "is the
camaraderie between players that still
exists."
Bunce said that he was quite pleased
and touched when a former teammate,
Jack Schultz, requested that Bunce be pre
sent for a knee operation.
"It was important for me that Don be
there," said Schultz, who has known
Bunce since their days as freshman foot
ball players, "partially because he is mv

friend and I respect him a great deal, and
partially because he is a surgeon."
As an orthopedic surgeon, Bunce is now
in his first year of a four-year residency
program at Stanford Hospital. The
bearded 29-year-old said he finds great
satisfaction in his work, particularly when
working with athletes because "they are
motivated to get well and I can empathize
with what they are feeling."
Except for one year as a quarterback in
the Canadian Football League in 1972 and a
half year abroad in Italy as a junior, Bunce
has spent his life living in the South Penin
sula area. He went to high school in
Woodside where he lettered in football,
basketball and baseball.
After being heavily recruited by a
number of schools, including USC and
UCLA, Bunce picked Stanford. "As a kid,"
he said, "I parked cars at Stantord games
forss and a free ticket. I always dreamed of
playing on their field.
"And besides," Bunce added, "I was
tired of watching Stanford lose."
Recently Bunce and his wife, Diane,
bought a home in Palo Alto. There he en
gages in two of his other favorite
pasttimes, carpentry and playing with his
14-month-old daughter.
"Football was exciting," he said bounc
ing his baby girl on his knee, "but not
nearly as exciting as the day Michel was
born."
Bunce said he has no regrets about the
lifestyle he has chosen, but after a long
pause, admitted that he is tempted at
times to get back into football. "The way
the 49ers are playing," he said with a slight
smirk, "I wonder if I shouldn't give it a
try."
But as he pondered that possibility, his
wife strolled through the kitchen smiling
and his daughter laughed while playing
with some toys. One gets the impression
that Don Bunce isn't seriously thinking
about a career in professional football. An
occasional 86-65 victory will be more than
enough.
