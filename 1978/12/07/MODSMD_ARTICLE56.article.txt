## Rumor mill: a vicious grind 
### Bruce Anderson 
There is no truth to the rumor started by my
zealous Canadian roommate that Bill Walsh is
leaving Stanford to coach the Montreal
Canadians.
Other rumors about Walsh departures are
not as easy to dispell.
In Henry IV, Part 2, another Bill said,
Rumor is a pipe
Brown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures
and of so easy and so plain a stop
That the blunt monster with uncounted
heads, the still-discordant wavering
multitide,
Can play upon it.
The blunt monster with uncounted head
lines has certainly been playing upon it.
As long as Walsh remains at Stanford,
rumors of NFL owners tempting Walsh in sec
ret meetings with astronomical salaries and
grandiose fringe benefit packages will
abound.
As a brilliant, pro-oriented coach at the
collegiate level,speculation will mountat the
winter solstice each year that Walsh will
abandon the Farm for the NFL.
Only a return to the pros or a blanket
statement by Walsh that he plans to stay at
Stanford in perpetuum will stop the rumors.
Walsh will not, however, make such a state
ment.
He does not want to come across as the
hypocrite that many coaches become when
they gush about their love for a school and
weeks later are packing their bags to venture
to a more lucrative position.
Washington State lost three coaches in
three years. Each told of the long tenure they
looked forward to in Pullman. Each left. Each
looked foolish.
Walsh is aware of his desireability as an NFL
coach. He realizes that someday the right
offer from the right team may be made to him
and he will accept it. Walsh is an excellent
coach, but he's not a prophet, and he does
not know whether that day will come in four
days or four vears.

Walsh likes Stanford. In the past he has
expressed a desire to stay in California, i.e.
the Bay Area or Los Angeles.
* * *
All of San Francisco seems ready to lynch 49er
general manager Joe Thomas but owner
Eddie Deßartolo does not appear ready to
give Thomas the boot.
The Los Angeles Times reported last week
that the Rams' front office is ready for a major
shake-up. Walsh did the rounds with Ram
owner Carrol Rosenbloom last season but
withdrew his name from consideration for
the job when Rosenbloom procrastinated.
An East Coast betting sheet has Walsh
going to the New York Giants. ..ah, the blunt
monster.
Speculation that Walsh may lose some of
his coaching staff has more substance. There
is a possibility that one of his assistants may
be hired to fill the head coaching vacancy at
San Jose State or University of Pacific.
Jon Crosby, an associate athletic director at
San Jose, said that the Spartans hope to have
a new coach by Dec. 13. Stanford assistant
Denny Green is one of the people most fre
quently mentioned as a probable replace
ment for the canned Lynn Stiles.
Crosby said that in addition to being public
relations minded, the new San Jose coach
needs to come from a successful program
and havethe ability to install a strong offense,
one which knows the value of the pass.
Amid all the premature speculation about
football coaching staff members going in
every direction, one assistant found a diffe
rent way to get in the news. He left an offen
sive playbook in the visiting coaches' booth
after the Big Game.
Walsh, an intense stickler for details, must
have been overjoyed.
Cal returned the playbook. But whether
the Golden Bears, who have expressed an
interest in developing an offense similar to
Stanford's, photocopied the playbook re
mains, like so much else, mere speculation.

Other rumors about Walsh departures are
not as easy to dispell.
In Henry IV, Part 2, another Bill said,
Rumor is a pipe
Brown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures
and of so easy and so plain a stop
That the blunt monster with uncounted
heads, the still-discordant wavering
multitide,
Can play upon it.
The blunt monster with uncounted head
lines has certainly been playing upon it.
As long as Walsh remains at Stanford,
rumors of NFL owners tempting Walsh in sec
ret meetings with astronomical salaries and
grandiose fringe benefit packages will
abound.
As a brilliant, pro-oriented coach at the
collegiate level,speculation will mountat the
winter solstice each year that Walsh will
abandon the Farm for the NFL.
Only a return to the pros or a blanket
statement by Walsh that he plans to stay at
Stanford in perpetuum will stop the rumors.
Walsh will not, however, make such a state
ment.
He does not want to come across as the
hypocrite that many coaches become when
they gush about their love for a school and
weeks later are packing their bags to venture
to a more lucrative position.
Washington State lost three coaches in
three years. Each told of the long tenure they
looked forward to in Pullman. Each left. Each
looked foolish.
Walsh is aware of his desireability as an NFL
coach. He realizes that someday the right
offer from the right team may be made to him
and he will accept it. Walsh is an excellent
coach, but he's not a prophet, and he does
not know whether that day will come in four
days or four vears.

Walsh likes Stanford. In the past he has
expressed a desire to stay in California, i.e.
the Bay Area or Los Angeles.

All of San Francisco seems ready to lynch 49er
general manager Joe Thomas but owner
Eddie Deßartolo does not appear ready to
give Thomas the boot.
The Los Angeles Times reported last week
that the Rams' front office is ready for a major
shake-up. Walsh did the rounds with Ram
owner Carrol Rosenbloom last season but
withdrew his name from consideration for
the job when Rosenbloom procrastinated.
An East Coast betting sheet has Walsh
going to the New York Giants. ..ah, the blunt
monster.
Speculation that Walsh may lose some of
his coaching staff has more substance. There
is a possibility that one of his assistants may
be hired to fill the head coaching vacancy at
San Jose State or University of Pacific.
Jon Crosby, an associate athletic director at
San Jose, said that the Spartans hope to have
a new coach by Dec. 13. Stanford assistant
Denny Green is one of the people most fre
quently mentioned as a probable replace
ment for the canned Lynn Stiles.
Crosby said that in addition to being public
relations minded, the new San Jose coach
needs to come from a successful program
and havethe ability to install a strong offense,
one which knows the value of the pass.
Amid all the premature speculation about
football coaching staff members going in
every direction, one assistant found a diffe
rent way to get in the news. He left an offen
sive playbook in the visiting coaches' booth
after the Big Game.
Walsh, an intense stickler for details, must
have been overjoyed.
Cal returned the playbook. But whether
the Golden Bears, who have expressed an
interest in developing an offense similar to
Stanford's, photocopied the playbook re
mains, like so much else, mere speculation.
There is no truth to the rumor started by my
zealous Canadian roommate that Bill Walsh is
leaving Stanford to coach the Montreal
