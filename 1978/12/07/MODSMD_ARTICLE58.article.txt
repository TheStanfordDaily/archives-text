### 
Dear Campers:
How is everybody?
Doing well, I hope, all
things considered.
I began this piece (basi
cally a "write anything" as
signment) as a scholarly
monograph on the impor
tance of the arts in society,
their relationship to man's
sense of play, and their
stabilitizing influence on
his life. Then I realized that
the last thing anyone needs
to hear during Dead Week,
when he has five minutes
to read the paper between
Faust and physics, is some
pompous sounding shit
heel spurting all over
the page about "the ahts,
dahling" (near and dear to
my heart as they are). In
stead, I'll mention a few
things that have been on
my mind.
Dead Week is a pretty
scary time, in one sense. All
the work has piled up, and
it seems there's NO ES
CAPE. I mean, all campus
entertainment disappears.
Your friends sit at break
fast, textbooks between
their face and their Fruit
Loops. People scurry,
worry, and become just
that edge more frantic in
the face of "impending
doom."
Understandable. But fal
lacious. Being "scared"
implies a willingless to be
led by the "should" and
"have to's" (I "should" be
studying; I "have to" make
my bed) which populate
our day-to-day existences.
Belief in these nebulous
"outer voices (be they of
parents, profs, the media)
indicates a sense on our
parts of a loss of control
over our lives.
The Puritan Ethic would
have us believe we
"should" work, then play;

produce, then relax; do,
then be. That attitude,
however, is an intrinsic de
nial of our innate sense of
play and our ability to con
trol our lives on a moment
to-moment level. It
suggests we cannot play
(read: enjoyment) until we
have worked (read: pain).
It's a pretty offensive idea
to anyone who seriously
believes in the art of living.
This all is not to deny that
obligations exist: but clas
ses, appointments, plan
ned meals, and finals are
the realities we have sup
posedly already accepted
as part and parcel of the
"college experience."
Within the framework of
these perceived obliga
tions, we must remember
that we are all artists; our
art is life itself, living is the
creative process. We create
every moment, we create
time, we create existence.
The future and past need
not hold us, for the present
is all that is.
Say we have a class in 10
minutes. That's a future
fact — fine. But getting to
the class, choosing a seat,
and selecting our
notebook are all potentially
creative experiences — the
walk is a celebration of na
ture (have you noticed the
fall colors?), finding a seat
can establish an hour's
worth of great social con
tact. The trick to the whole
thing is being able to focus
on — and allow yourself to
exist in — the moment, re
gardless of past or future
events.
Goals imply a future, and
are valuable to some for
their directing influence.
But we forget the
mechanics of their fulfill
ment: with so much em
phasis on product, we ig
nore theprocess. Denial of

process is denial of exis
tence, because the pro
cess, like our lives, is
CONTINUALLY HAPPEN
ING. The present is the
only reality, because the
present IS WHAT IS.
The person whose "goal
in life" is "to be happy," for
example, is a complete
contradiction in terms. If
he is happy at any moment,
then he's achieved his
"goal," and is therefore a
"success." What next?
"Happiness" (or lack
thereof) is a moment-to
moment reality, and can
not be gauged in terms of a
future-oriented goal.
What society could pos
sibly create a Dan White (al
leged murderer of Mayor
George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk)?
How long before the same
thing happens here at Stan
ford, when a student finally
snaps because he didn't get
the "A" he so badly wanted
("needed")? A society
founded on progress
(equals future), product,
goals and achievement is
one in which it's possible to
lose touch with the inner
voices, the needs and
urges which intuitively
guide us, and with our all
important sense of humor
and play.
Life, then, is a series of
balances, not an if/then
proposition. We can work
and play; produce and re
lax, do and be — at the
same moment. Maintain
ing a sense of humor and
the ability to live in and for
the moment are two keys to
combating the sometimes
overwhelming white noise
of those "outer voices."
Good luck with finals.
You'll do fine.
Love, Dave

the work has piled up, and
it seems there's NO ES
CAPE. I mean, all campus
entertainment disappears.
Your friends sit at break
fast, textbooks between
their face and their Fruit
Loops. People scurry,
worry, and become just
that edge more frantic in
the face of "impending
doom."
Understandable. But fal
lacious. Being "scared"
implies a willingless to be
led by the "should" and
"have to's" (I "should" be
studying; I "have to" make
my bed) which populate
our day-to-day existences.
Belief in these nebulous
"outer voices (be they of
parents, profs, the media)
indicates a sense on our
parts of a loss of control
over our lives.
The Puritan Ethic would
have us believe we
"should" work, then play;

produce, then relax; do,
then be. That attitude,
however, is an intrinsic de
nial of our innate sense of
play and our ability to con
trol our lives on a moment
to-moment level. It
suggests we cannot play
(read: enjoyment) until we
have worked (read: pain).
It's a pretty offensive idea
to anyone who seriously
believes in the art of living.
This all is not to deny that
obligations exist: but clas
ses, appointments, plan
ned meals, and finals are
the realities we have sup
posedly already accepted
as part and parcel of the
"college experience."
Within the framework of
these perceived obliga
tions, we must remember
that we are all artists; our
art is life itself, living is the
creative process. We create
every moment, we create
time, we create existence.
The future and past need
not hold us, for the present
is all that is.
Say we have a class in 10
minutes. That's a future
fact — fine. But getting to
the class, choosing a seat,
and selecting our
notebook are all potentially
creative experiences — the
walk is a celebration of na
ture (have you noticed the
fall colors?), finding a seat
can establish an hour's
worth of great social con
tact. The trick to the whole
thing is being able to focus
on — and allow yourself to
exist in — the moment, re
gardless of past or future
events.
Goals imply a future, and
are valuable to some for
their directing influence.
But we forget the
mechanics of their fulfill
ment: with so much em
phasis on product, we ig
nore theprocess. Denial of

process is denial of exis
tence, because the pro
cess, like our lives, is
CONTINUALLY HAPPEN
ING. The present is the
only reality, because the
present IS WHAT IS.
The person whose "goal
in life" is "to be happy," for
example, is a complete
contradiction in terms. If
he is happy at any moment,
then he's achieved his
"goal," and is therefore a
"success." What next?
"Happiness" (or lack
thereof) is a moment-to
moment reality, and can
not be gauged in terms of a
future-oriented goal.
What society could pos
sibly create a Dan White (al
leged murderer of Mayor
George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk)?
How long before the same
thing happens here at Stan
ford, when a student finally
snaps because he didn't get
the "A" he so badly wanted
("needed")? A society
founded on progress
(equals future), product,
goals and achievement is
one in which it's possible to
lose touch with the inner
voices, the needs and
urges which intuitively
guide us, and with our all
important sense of humor
and play.
Life, then, is a series of
balances, not an if/then
proposition. We can work
and play; produce and re
lax, do and be — at the
same moment. Maintain
ing a sense of humor and
the ability to live in and for
the moment are two keys to
combating the sometimes
overwhelming white noise
of those "outer voices."
Good luck with finals.
You'll do fine.

Dear Campers:
How is everybody?
Doing well, I hope, all
things considered.
I began this piece (basi
cally a "write anything" as
signment) as a scholarly
monograph on the impor
tance of the arts in society,
their relationship to man's
sense of play, and their
stabilitizing influence on
his life. Then I realized that
the last thing anyone needs
to hear during Dead Week,
when he has five minutes
to read the paper between
Faust and physics, is some
pompous sounding shit
heel spurting all over
the page about "the ahts,
dahling" (near and dear to
my heart as they are). In
stead, I'll mention a few
things that have been on
my mind.

"should" work, then play;

produce, then relax; do,
then be. That attitude,
however, is an intrinsic de
nial of our innate sense of
play and our ability to con
trol our lives on a moment
to-moment level. It
suggests we cannot play
(read: enjoyment) until we
have worked (read: pain).
It's a pretty offensive idea
to anyone who seriously
believes in the art of living.
This all is not to deny that
obligations exist: but clas
ses, appointments, plan
ned meals, and finals are
the realities we have sup
posedly already accepted
as part and parcel of the
"college experience."
Within the framework of
these perceived obliga
tions, we must remember
that we are all artists; our
art is life itself, living is the
creative process. We create
every moment, we create
time, we create existence.
The future and past need
not hold us, for the present
is all that is.
Say we have a class in 10
minutes. That's a future
fact — fine. But getting to
the class, choosing a seat,
and selecting our
notebook are all potentially
creative experiences — the
walk is a celebration of na
ture (have you noticed the
fall colors?), finding a seat
can establish an hour's
worth of great social con
tact. The trick to the whole
thing is being able to focus
on — and allow yourself to
exist in — the moment, re
gardless of past or future
events.
Goals imply a future, and
are valuable to some for
their directing influence.
But we forget the
mechanics of their fulfill
ment: with so much em
phasis on product, we ig
nore theprocess. Denial of

process is denial of exis
tence, because the pro
cess, like our lives, is
CONTINUALLY HAPPEN
ING. The present is the
only reality, because the
present IS WHAT IS.
The person whose "goal
in life" is "to be happy," for
example, is a complete
contradiction in terms. If
he is happy at any moment,
then he's achieved his
"goal," and is therefore a
"success." What next?
"Happiness" (or lack
thereof) is a moment-to
moment reality, and can
not be gauged in terms of a
future-oriented goal.
What society could pos
sibly create a Dan White (al
leged murderer of Mayor
George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk)?
How long before the same
thing happens here at Stan
ford, when a student finally
snaps because he didn't get
the "A" he so badly wanted
("needed")? A society
founded on progress
(equals future), product,
goals and achievement is
one in which it's possible to
lose touch with the inner
voices, the needs and
urges which intuitively
guide us, and with our all
important sense of humor
and play.
Life, then, is a series of
balances, not an if/then
proposition. We can work
and play; produce and re
lax, do and be — at the
same moment. Maintain
ing a sense of humor and
the ability to live in and for
the moment are two keys to
combating the sometimes
overwhelming white noise
of those "outer voices."
Good luck with finals.
You'll do fine.
Love, Dave
(Dave Ford is.)
