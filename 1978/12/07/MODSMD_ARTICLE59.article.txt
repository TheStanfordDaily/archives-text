## Holiday movie highlights 
### 
Theaters are girding their concession stands
against the coming of the holiday movie and,
they hope, the holiday audience. The next few
weeks will see a spate of new releases, each
attempting to claim the attention and the wallets
of the nation's movie goers.
The year's biggest film, in terms of stars,
money spent, and hype, is the mammoth pro
duction of Superman. It boasts a budget of $35
million, 3.7 million of which went to Marlort
Brando for his supporting role as Superman's
father. Soap-opera veteran Christopher Reeves
portrays the man of steel, and Margot Kidder
takes the Lois Lane part. With four sequels plan
ned, it seems that you just can't keep a good
man down.

The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a re-make
of the 1956 low-budget classic, makes an at
tempt to capture the lucrative science-fiction
market. The time around the players include
Donald Sutherland, Trekkie idol Leonard Nimoy
and Brook Adams. It will be interesting to see
whether audiences like this yarn about a town's
population being replaced by "duplicates" from
outer space as well as thdy did 20 years ago.
Oliver's Story seems designed to bring joy to
the hearts of the handkerchief lobbyists. A
sequel to the immensely popular Love Story of
eight years ago, this exploration of the depths of
sentimentality has Ryan O'Neil and Candice
Bergen in the leads.
Broadway
Turning hit Broadway plays into movies has
been a favorite Hollywood pastime since its
beginning. This year's additions to the list are
The Wiz and now Same Time Next Year. Alan
Alda and Ellen Burstyn star as two lovers, mar
ried but not to each other, who carry on their
relationship just one day out of the year. Robert
Mulligan, best known for To Kill a Mockingbird

and Summer of '42, is the director.
James Michener's epics endear themselves to
both readers and filmmakers. To his works
which have been filmed, which include South
Pacific and Hawaii, must be added this year's
Caravans. Anthony Quinn, Jennifer O'Neill and
Michael Sarragin go for a romp in the dunes in
this desert opus.
John Avildsen, whodirected Rocky, returns in
ihe same vein with the perversely titled Slow
Dancing in the Big City. This one's about a bal
lerina whose career is revitalized by a new man
in her life. "Slow Dancing is falling in love,"
proclaims the movie's publicity; the lovers are
played by Anne Ditchburn and Paul Sorvino.
William (The Exorcist) Friedkin's seasonal of-

fering is a caper movie called The Brinks Job.
Peter Falk and Peter Boyle star, and Italian movie
magnate Dino De Laurentiis produced.
Music
Stanley Donen directed some of the best mus
icals Hollywood ever produced; he was respon
sible for Singing in the Rain and Seven Brides for
Seven Brothers, along with many others. Now,
with Movie Movie, he tries to satirize musical
conventions. George C. Scott, scarcely a Gene
Kelly, is featured.
Moment by Moment, one of the year's most
promising films, is an off-beat romance about an
older woman and a younger man. Lily Tomlin
and john Travolta, both fresh from personal
successes, take the leading roles.
It should be an interesting month, spiced by
the possibility that one of the smaller, less
advertised films will turn out to be a hit. A big
budget may be lovely to look at, but it's some
how comforting that it doesn't take $35 million
to turn out a small masterpiece. At any, rate, it
appears that this year's audiences will have
much to choose from.
