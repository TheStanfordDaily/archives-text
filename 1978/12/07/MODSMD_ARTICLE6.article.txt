# Protesters march, call on Americans to oppose shah
## 
### SARA LESSLEY 
Nearly 75 protesters carrying
signs and chanting "Down with
the shah" marched through
White Plaza yesterday protesting
U.S. involvement in Iran and Shah
Reza Pahlavi's regime.
The noon rally, sponsored by
the campus Iranian Student Cul
tural Association, involved mainly
Stanford students, according to
one of the protest organizers,
who asked not to be identified.
The student said the protesters
were demonstrating support of
what he called the Iranian
people's "just struggle for an in
dependent and democratic soci
ety" and attempting to "expose
recent massacres by the shah."
A rally speaker said the Iranian
people's resistance to the shah's
regime has turned into a direct
confrontation in which thousands
of people have been killed. But
strict censorship in Iran and what
he believes is a biased American
media campaign, have prevented
and distorted accurate news re
ports from Iran, added another
unidentified student.
The protesters believe the shah
and what they called his Un
supported military government
will remain in power, and that
there may be direct U.S. military
intervention in Iran unless the
American people protest any such
action. The shah's troops already

are U.S. equipped and trained,
the student added.
SLAC Prof. Prof. Pierre Noyes, a
member of the policy committee
of the national U.S. Committee on
Iran, said he and others believe
that the U.S. government has an
interest in maintaining the shah's
regime. Hecited examples includ
ing American participation in mul
tinational corporations in Iran,
the sale of some $18 billion worth
of arms to Iran since 1972, and
American interest in Iran's oil as
reasons for the U.S. government
desire to see the current Iranian
regime continue.
A protester added that he be
lieves the shah's regime can exist
only if the multinational corpora
tions remain in Iran. The com
panies help provide the shah's
power base, he said.
The first step toward preventing
direct American intervention is to
educate, then mobilize the
American people to put pressure
on the U.S. government, added
one protester. Noyes said past
events have shown that it is "not
writing Congress, or elections —
but demonstrations that have put
sufficient pressure" on govern
ment policies. People can't
change the government, but they
can limit its options, he added, by
letting government officials know
"there's no way we will stomach"
military intervention.

power base, he said.
The first step toward preventing
direct American intervention is to
educate, then mobilize the
American people to put pressure
on the U.S. government, added
one protester. Noyes said past
events have shown that it is "not
writing Congress, or elections —
but demonstrations that have put
sufficient pressure" on govern
ment policies. People can't
change the government, but they
can limit its options, he added, by
letting government officials know
"there's no way we will stomach"
military intervention.

Protesters march through Lomita Mall chanting and displaying signs denouncing the Shah of Iran. The protesters
called on Americans to end their support to the leader whose country has been hit with massive protests in recent
months.
Nearly 75 protesters carrying
signs and chanting "Down with
the shah" marched through
White Plaza yesterday protesting
U.S. involvement in Iran and Shah
Reza Pahlavi's regime.
The noon rally, sponsored by
the campus Iranian Student Cul
tural Association, involved mainly
Stanford students, according to
one of the protest organizers,
who asked not to be identified.
The student said the protesters
were demonstrating support of
what he called the Iranian
people's "just struggle for an in
dependent and democratic soci
ety" and attempting to "expose
recent massacres by the shah."
A rally speaker said the Iranian
people's resistance to the shah's
regime has turned into a direct
confrontation in which thousands
of people have been killed. But
strict censorship in Iran and what
he believes is a biased American
media campaign, have prevented
and distorted accurate news re
ports from Iran, added another
unidentified student.
The protesters believe the shah
and what they called his Un
supported military government
will remain in power, and that
there may be direct U.S. military
intervention in Iran unless the
American people protest any such
action. The shah's troops already

are U.S. equipped and trained,
the student added.
SLAC Prof. Prof. Pierre Noyes, a
member of the policy committee
of the national U.S. Committee on
Iran, said he and others believe
that the U.S. government has an
interest in maintaining the shah's
regime. Hecited examples includ
ing American participation in mul
tinational corporations in Iran,
the sale of some $18 billion worth
of arms to Iran since 1972, and
American interest in Iran's oil as
reasons for the U.S. government
desire to see the current Iranian
regime continue.
A protester added that he be
lieves the shah's regime can exist
only if the multinational corpora
tions remain in Iran. The com
panies help provide the shah's
power base, he said.
The first step toward preventing
direct American intervention is to
educate, then mobilize the
American people to put pressure
on the U.S. government, added
one protester. Noyes said past
