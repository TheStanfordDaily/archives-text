## The
						upper reaches of the fabled guano 
### 
Since I have a personal aver
sion to "top ten" lists, I've de
cided to exploit this period of
retrospection to look at a far
less "important" topic; the
guano. Guano can apply to a
great many things, for exam
ple: bat defecation, certain
styles of writing and very bad
movies. With the ghost of
gonzo king )ohn Nielsen still
ever-present in the entertain
ment office, it seems more
than appropriate to use this
Dead Week space to set up the
John Nielsen Guano Hall of
Fame ()NGHF).
An ordinary guano movie
won't make it to the |NGHF. A
prerequisite for entry is either
enormous success or huge,
very ugly hype, or both. These
requirements eliminate Sec
rets, The Greek Tycoon, Big
Wednesday and (though not by
much) The Cheap Detective
from contention. All are
bonafide guano however.
Secrets' director, whose
name will probably always es
cape me, must have thought
that he was really going to
make the "Big One," and in
stead, he ends up biting it. The
movie is full of things like
"meaningful talk about love re
lationships," and its color is so
awful that it even manages to
make Jacqueline Bisset look
bad. But despite being pure
guano, Secrets didn't make
enough money or dominate
the press enough (even though
its stupid ads had ridiculous
quotes from "critics" in Miami
concerning the "famous Bisset
nude scene" here) to make it to
the Hall.
Jackie Bisset was also in The
Greek Tycoon, an instantly
forgettable soap opera movie
which celebrates the vapidness

of the wealthy and of
moviemakers. Though the
movie had a glossy ad cam
paign, its publicity was gener
ally too low-key and its profits
too low to achieve guano glory.
Big Wednesday was gone so
fast that it didn't have much
chance to piss anybody off.
Too bad; it had something for
everybody. This "intellectual"
surfing movie was blowhard
director John Milius' attempt
to do Hemingway on the Big

Wave. One really gets tired of
Milius' glorified macho mas
turbation; if he really wants to
live his macho fantasies, why
doesn't he get the hell out of
movies and do something
worthwhile, like play Russian
roulette? Oh well; this $9
million inanity failed be
fore its certain-to-be-tasteless
ad campaign could gear up, so
it also blew its shot at the
JNGHF.
The Cheap Detective was an
unbelievably witless parody of
'40s detective and Bogart
movies written by the agoniz
ingly prolific Neil Simon. The
only point of reference here
was old Neil Simon movies

(speaking of which, I can
hardly wait for California
Goodbye Death Suite to come
out). But the movie didn't
make much of a stir, in either
its pre-publicity or its profits,
so it gets left out of the Hall as
well.
But two guanos did exhibit
their ugly forms in the suffi
cient manner this year. The
first, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band, had a $5
million promo budget

and a tie-in with Dr. Pepper, so
it met one of the qualfictions
very well. Thankfully, the
movie failed at the box office;
maybe that will prove to some
body that matters that we just
aren't as dumb as we're sup
posed to be. Sgt. Pepper did
achieve at least one "distinc
tion," however — it had to be
the biggest Muzak-making job
in history.
The other entrant into the
JNGHF is the perfect guano
movie; it's offensively bad, it
had megahype, and it is also
making a lot of money. Cur
rently "gracing" the nation's
screens, Midnight Express is
one of the most ugly pieces of

audience manipulation ever
filmed. Director Alan Parker
and his screenwriter, Peter
Stone, get audiences to cheer a
man biting another man's ton
gue off and spitting.it out. The
movie is an implicitly sexual
glorification of the most primal
violence — it's a pornography
of violence.
Parker and Stone pervert
movie technique to the point
where they've reduced most
people's emotional responses

to the lowest, most brutal
level. In this most limited way,
they're "effective," but then I
guess rapists are too. Midnight
Express' ads are basic — of
course, it's a "true story," of
course, "everyone is talking
about it." The movie is also
very successful; it's been the
biggest moneymaker this fall.
Manipulation works again.
So it goes. As long as we have
movies, we'll probably have
ones like Midnight Express and
Sgt. Pepper. And we'll also
have some word to describe
such movies and some gonzo
journalist to supply it. May the
next week not be guano and
may bats not fly in your face.
