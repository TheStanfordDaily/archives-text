## Hot jazz: the year's best releases 
### 
I originally planned to fea
ture the year's 10 best jazz al
bums; but after careful con
sideration I could only come
up with eight that I really, really
wanted to recommend. It will
be noted that my choices do
not include many of the real
big "jazz" hits of the year. For
this I feel I need to offer an
apology — the more one lis
tens to music the more it be
comes clear that record sales
and record quality have little
correlation. The records, in
descending order are:
8. John Scofeld Live — This al
bum, recorded at the Domicile
in Munich, is an extremely im
pressive outing for guitarist
Scofield. His choice of side
men is superb: Richie Beirach,
George Mraz, and Joe Laßarb
era; each of whom is talented
enough to headline the album.
7. Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Band
Live in Munich — Ironically this
album is also recorded at the
Domicile in Munich (some
thing of the Village Vanguard
of Europe) hinting that Ameri
can artists have to go abroad to
be recognized. What can one

say about the Jones-Lewis big
band that hasn't been said al
ready? Their charts are fantastic
and their soloists first-rate, in
particular co-leader Mel Lewis
with his drumming (which
should serve as a model for as
piring drummers), and reed
player jerry Dodgion.
6. Bill Evans New Conversations
— Generally the very idea of
over-dubbing bothers me, but
I have to make an exception for
this effort by pianist Bill Evans.
The music is all played by Evans
on one, two, or three pianos.
The music is never too thick
(like many duo piano record
ings), but extremely tasteful.
Let me recommend Evans re
ndition of Duke Ellington's
"Reflections in D." This one
cut is perhaps the best thing
Evans has ever done — which is
saying quite a lot.
Steve Kuhn Non-Fiction — I re
ally don't have much to add to
my review of several weeks
ago. This album is really good,
and Kuhn is definitely a person
to watch. How such talent can
go on being unrecognized is
beyond me.

4. Adam Makowicz Adam
Makowicz — This is the first
American solo release for the
master Polish pianist
Makowicz. He has been
heralded as the new Tatum and
the new Oscar Peterson and I
can see why. He combines a
commanding technique and an
unmatched harmonic sense. I
will have to wait and hear a
group recording to fully make
up my mind; but on the basis
of this one solo album I will say
that Makowicz is definitely a
person to watch.
3. Oregon Out of the Woods —
Suffice it to say that the group
Oregon has celebrated its new
recording contract with Elektra
by releasing their best album to
date. Oregon, for those who
don't know is a fantastic group
consisting of Ralph Towner,
Collin Walcott, Paul McCand
less and Glen Moore. Bet
ween the four of them they
play several dozen instru
ments, most of them rather
well. This album is well worth
hearing.
2. Keith jarret My Song — This is
undoubtedly Jarrett's most lis
tenable group album. I find

nearly everything Keith does to
be excellent, but he really out
did himself with this master
piece. One can marvel not only
at the group's fine playing, but
also at Jarrett's excellent com
posing. The songs themselves
deserve careful analysis —
How wonderful it would be to
have Keith set some lyrics to
music. Perhaps, knowing his
eclecticism, he will someday.
1. Scott Hamilton Scott Hamil
ton II — I have been listening to
this album ever since I first got
it — with increasing apprecia
tion and pleasure each time.
Hamilton is a saxophonist who
is deeply rooted in the tradi
tion and plays his sax like Ben
Webster or Coleman Hawkins
would if they were still around.
This will be a difficult album to
find, but the effort is definitely
worth making.
Honorable Mention goes to
Chet Baker for You Can't Go
Home Again; Dexter Cordon
for Sophisticated Giant;
Richard Sussman Free Fall;
Herbie Hancock for The Quin
tent; and Ella Fitzgerald for
Dreamdancing.

tens to music the more it be
comes clear that record sales
and record quality have little
correlation. The records, in
descending order are:
8. John Scofeld Live — This al
bum, recorded at the Domicile
in Munich, is an extremely im
pressive outing for guitarist
Scofield. His choice of side
men is superb: Richie Beirach,
George Mraz, and Joe Laßarb
era; each of whom is talented
enough to headline the album.
7. Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Band
Live in Munich — Ironically this
album is also recorded at the
Domicile in Munich (some
thing of the Village Vanguard
of Europe) hinting that Ameri
can artists have to go abroad to
be recognized. What can one

say about the Jones-Lewis big
band that hasn't been said al
ready? Their charts are fantastic
and their soloists first-rate, in
particular co-leader Mel Lewis
with his drumming (which
should serve as a model for as
piring drummers), and reed
player jerry Dodgion.
6. Bill Evans New Conversations
— Generally the very idea of
over-dubbing bothers me, but
I have to make an exception for
this effort by pianist Bill Evans.
The music is all played by Evans
on one, two, or three pianos.
The music is never too thick
(like many duo piano record
ings), but extremely tasteful.
Let me recommend Evans re
ndition of Duke Ellington's
"Reflections in D." This one
cut is perhaps the best thing
Evans has ever done — which is
saying quite a lot.
Steve Kuhn Non-Fiction — I re
ally don't have much to add to
my review of several weeks
ago. This album is really good,
and Kuhn is definitely a person
to watch. How such talent can
go on being unrecognized is
beyond me.

4. Adam Makowicz Adam
Makowicz — This is the first
American solo release for the
master Polish pianist
Makowicz. He has been
heralded as the new Tatum and
the new Oscar Peterson and I
can see why. He combines a
commanding technique and an
unmatched harmonic sense. I
will have to wait and hear a
group recording to fully make
up my mind; but on the basis
of this one solo album I will say
that Makowicz is definitely a
person to watch.
3. Oregon Out of the Woods —
Suffice it to say that the group
Oregon has celebrated its new
recording contract with Elektra
by releasing their best album to
date. Oregon, for those who
don't know is a fantastic group
consisting of Ralph Towner,
Collin Walcott, Paul McCand
less and Glen Moore. Bet
ween the four of them they
play several dozen instru
ments, most of them rather
well. This album is well worth
hearing.
2. Keith jarret My Song — This is
undoubtedly Jarrett's most lis
tenable group album. I find

nearly everything Keith does to
be excellent, but he really out
did himself with this master
piece. One can marvel not only
at the group's fine playing, but
also at Jarrett's excellent com
posing. The songs themselves
deserve careful analysis —
How wonderful it would be to
have Keith set some lyrics to
music. Perhaps, knowing his
eclecticism, he will someday.
1. Scott Hamilton Scott Hamil
ton II — I have been listening to
this album ever since I first got
it — with increasing apprecia
tion and pleasure each time.
Hamilton is a saxophonist who
is deeply rooted in the tradi
tion and plays his sax like Ben
Webster or Coleman Hawkins
would if they were still around.
This will be a difficult album to
find, but the effort is definitely
worth making.
Honorable Mention goes to
Chet Baker for You Can't Go
Home Again; Dexter Cordon
for Sophisticated Giant;
Richard Sussman Free Fall;
Herbie Hancock for The Quin
tent; and Ella Fitzgerald for
Dreamdancing.






From left to right, members of Oregon: Ralph Towner, Collin Walcott, Paul McCandless and Glen Moore.
I originally planned to fea
ture the year's 10 best jazz al
bums; but after careful con
sideration I could only come
up with eight that I really, really
wanted to recommend. It will
be noted that my choices do
not include many of the real
big "jazz" hits of the year. For
this I feel I need to offer an
apology — the more one lis
