## Byrd sells out, Grimes swings

Thank You...For F.U.M.L.
Donald Byrd
Elektra
A critic who disagreed with
my recent review of Patrice
Rushen's album Patrice de
fended Rushen's disc on the
grounds that there is no such
thing as good or bad in music,
just personal tastes.
This viewpoint has many in
teresting implications. Now, 1
have been playing the piano
regularly for the past 16 years
— and if there is no such thing
as good or bad in music it
would appear that I can play
the piano no better today, than
I could when I was seven sim
ply because there is no such
thing as better music. I cer
tainly have wasted a lot of time
practicing, haven't I?
Trumpeter Donald Byrd has
an easy solution tho this prob
lem. Last year in an interview
with the LA Times, Byrd
claimed that "the music which
sells best, is best." Certainly
Donald has tried to live up to
these standards; his new al
bum, Thank You...ForF.U.M.L.
is really climbing upthe charts.
The title cut is an abbrevia
tion for "Thank You For Funk
ing Up My Life." The song's
lyrics are based on the similar
ity between the word "funk"
and another word (which I
can't print) which sounds al
most the same. When the lead
singer sings "You funk me up,
yes, you funk me up," the lis

tener is struck by Donald
Byrd's witty sense of humor.
Pretty clever, eh?
Byrd takes few solos on the
album, and the reason is clear:
he has real difficulty in hitting a
clean note, and is completely
lost when he tries to do a fast
passage.
Let me make it clear, I am not
against funk. Stevie Wonder
has proven that funk can be
good and powerful music. Yes

there is good funk, but I am
afraid that Byrd's new album is
not an example of it. He is ac
companied by the famed
guitarist Wah-Wah Watson
who must have set a record by
now for being on more bad re
cords than anyone else in jazz
history. But after all, "the
music that sells best, is best."
Some Croovy Fours
Tiny Grimes
Inner City
In contrast, Tiny Grimes is an
excellent guitarist who has re
corded relatively little during
the past decade. Grimes, sur

prisingly, is remembered by
jazz fans for almost everything
except his playing ability. He is
remembered for having
helped to give Charlie Parker
his start in the '40s (these in
teresting recordings are avail
able on the Savoy label), and
also for being the most neg
lected member of the legen
dary Art Tatum Trio.
For most of the past decade
Crimes has been playing his
bluesy swinging music for fans
in New York at the West End
club near Columbia University,
a fantastic little bar which
serves as the modern
meeting-ground for half of the
remaining swing world.
Grimes' playing has really im
proved since his heyday in the
'40s. His technique is crisper
and the playing more driving.
The album consists of stan
dards and originals, the latter
of which are mostly blues. He
is joined by pianist Lloyd
Glenn, who sounds like Oscar
Peterson with less technique,
and drummer Panama Francis
who is an excellent musician in
the style of that master drum
mer Jo Jones. The bassist is a
new-comer (I suspect) named
Roland Lobligeois.
Grimes is one of the last
players of the four-string
guitar, and it is amazing to see
the variety of things he can do
with two less strings than
Wah-Wah Watson uses. The
album is highly recommended.

Glenn, who sounds like Oscar
Peterson with less technique,
and drummer Panama Francis
who is an excellent musician in
the style of that master drum
mer Jo Jones. The bassist is a
new-comer (I suspect) named
Roland Lobligeois.
Grimes is one of the last
players of the four-string
guitar, and it is amazing to see
the variety of things he can do
with two less strings than
Wah-Wah Watson uses. The
album is highly recommended.

Elektra
A critic who disagreed with
my recent review of Patrice
Rushen's album Patrice de
fended Rushen's disc on the
grounds that there is no such
thing as good or bad in music,
just personal tastes.
This viewpoint has many in
teresting implications. Now, 1
have been playing the piano
regularly for the past 16 years
— and if there is no such thing
as good or bad in music it
would appear that I can play
the piano no better today, than
I could when I was seven sim
ply because there is no such
thing as better music. I cer
tainly have wasted a lot of time
practicing, haven't I?
Trumpeter Donald Byrd has
an easy solution tho this prob
lem. Last year in an interview
with the LA Times, Byrd
claimed that "the music which
sells best, is best." Certainly
Donald has tried to live up to
these standards; his new al
bum, Thank You...ForF.U.M.L.
is really climbing upthe charts.
The title cut is an abbrevia
tion for "Thank You For Funk
ing Up My Life." The song's
lyrics are based on the similar
ity between the word "funk"
and another word (which I
can't print) which sounds al
most the same. When the lead
singer sings "You funk me up,
yes, you funk me up," the lis

tener is struck by Donald
Byrd's witty sense of humor.
Pretty clever, eh?
Byrd takes few solos on the
album, and the reason is clear:
he has real difficulty in hitting a
clean note, and is completely
lost when he tries to do a fast
passage.
Let me make it clear, I am not
against funk. Stevie Wonder
has proven that funk can be
good and powerful music. Yes

there is good funk, but I am
afraid that Byrd's new album is
not an example of it. He is ac
companied by the famed
guitarist Wah-Wah Watson
who must have set a record by
now for being on more bad re
cords than anyone else in jazz
history. But after all, "the
music that sells best, is best."

Tiny Grimes
Inner City
In contrast, Tiny Grimes is an
excellent guitarist who has re
corded relatively little during
the past decade. Grimes, sur

prisingly, is remembered by
jazz fans for almost everything
except his playing ability. He is
remembered for having
helped to give Charlie Parker
his start in the '40s (these in
teresting recordings are avail
able on the Savoy label), and
also for being the most neg
lected member of the legen
dary Art Tatum Trio.
For most of the past decade
Crimes has been playing his
bluesy swinging music for fans
in New York at the West End
club near Columbia University,
a fantastic little bar which
serves as the modern
meeting-ground for half of the
remaining swing world.
Grimes' playing has really im
proved since his heyday in the
'40s. His technique is crisper
and the playing more driving.
The album consists of stan
dards and originals, the latter
of which are mostly blues. He
is joined by pianist Lloyd
Glenn, who sounds like Oscar
Peterson with less technique,
and drummer Panama Francis
who is an excellent musician in
the style of that master drum
mer Jo Jones. The bassist is a
