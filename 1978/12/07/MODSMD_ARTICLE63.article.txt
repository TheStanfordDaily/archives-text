## Saved by the Christmas spirit 
### 
Reviewing/4 Christmas Carol is like arrang
ing deck chairs on the Titanic. Pointless.
No matter what you say, people will go,
because all they want is a good time —
which is how it should be. What's Christ
mas, anyway?
You'll have a good time, too, if you
aren't concerned with Dickens or annoyed
by superficiality.
ACT's adaptation is faithful to the novel
in substance, but not in style. Though the
story remains intact, shortening and dres
sing up reduce its emotional power to
"mere" entertainment.
That isn't bad in itself.
But, much of A Christmas Carol's
strength grows out of the ordeals of de
scription and duration in which Dickens
captures Victorian England. Reading his
books, you can taste, touch and smell ev
erything from Yorkshire pudding to gut
tersnipes.
ACT's version, not quite two hours long,
is brighterand lighterthan Dickens should
be. It substitutes decoration for detail, im
pression for meaning. We never get to
know any of the characters, except the
dominating Scrooge. Things happen so
quickly and neatly, they seem manufac
tured rather than created.
When Tiny Tim dies, for instance, you
may cry, not because you feel like it, but
because you know the story and THIS is
the sad part.
Even with this streamlining, A Christmas
Carol offers clever staging and designing
and a pair of Scrooges who beat the pants

off Mr. McGoo.
Sydney Walker (alternating with William
Paterson) is a creaky, nasty fellow, who
stumps along in ratty black, with a scowl
and whining "Bah!" thrown at every pas
serby.
Walker is in command from his first
vulture-eyed glare at the audience to the
final scene, in which he discovers laughter
isn't hazardous to his health. He stops the
show with lines like this: "Ha, ha...ha, ha?
Ha, ha! Ha, Ha, HA!"
If Scrooge's conversion from grouch to
Good Samaritan is unconvincing, blame it
on the shortened script. Walker never gets
the chance to establish the rotten core be
neath his rotten exterior. His change of
heart is unsettling rather than surprising.
The play's surface treatment keeps the
rest of the cast from being more than
pieces in a bigger picture. Everyone is ob
ligated to be as much as possible like the
popular images of his character. There's
no time for anything else.
The show suffers too because everyone
hasn't agreed whether this should be
played straight or storybook. The opening
and closing scenes are pure holiday fan
tasy, but in between, people sometimes
take themselves too seriously. Randall
Smith as Scrooge the young man, and
Bonnie Tarwater, as his fiancee, seem un
cormfortably "real" amid all the merri
ment. From them, we zip to the Frezziwigs
(Bruce Williams and Candace Barrett) who
are a 19th Century Ma and Pa Kettle.
Mark Murphey's Bob Cratchit, and Peter

Davies' Fred, Scrooge's nephew, emerge
from this confusion with the strongest
characterizations,
Director Laird Williamson has choreog
raphed the show so it runs like a music
box. Each actor plays two or three parts,
including walls, doors and gravestones.
This interchangeability is played up by de
lightful mechanical-minded staging, in
which children, toys and other novelties
pop in and out of nooks like pieces of a
pinball machine gone berserk.
Just as imaginative is F. Mitchell Dana's
lighting, which turns the one-set stage into
a Victorian village, snowy estate, chur
chyard and ghostworld. Dana uses every
stage space — wall to floor — in his de
signs.
Robert Blackman's set is a packrat's
paradise of odds and ends from Scrooge's
past. Moneyboxes and childhood toys are
twisted into a gloomy monument to the
tight-fisted miser who has packed away his
memories and dreams.
As Scrooge learns his lesson, this jumble
of junk is torn away until it's nothing but
scaffolding against the bare stage wall.
At play's end, Scrooge, his soul similarly
exposed, cuts a fine jig as he wishes the
audience a "very merry Christmas." The
cast bursts into song.
It's, well — what's Christmas anyway?
