evening's program, "Bonsoir
mesdames et messieurs" —
pause — there seems to be
some head phone interference
— he resumes — more static —
angrily he rips at the cord inad
vertently disconnecting his
head set — in midstream, his
speech slowly winds to a halt
much like a tired phonograph
whose batteries have finally
conked out. A pair of hands
behind the curtain reach out,
bodily removing him off stage.
So the Cafe Theatre ushered in
its audience last weekend at
the Maison Francaise, setting
the tone for the ensuing pre
sentation of three one act plays
by Jean Tardies — style: not
surprisingly, "theater of the
absurd."
In good cafe-theater tradi
tion, the evening's entertain
ment was a melange ranging all
the way from high "drawing
room" comedy to serious
drama interspersed with inter
ludes of classical violin duets.
Entangling
The first play, "Eux Seuls le
Savent" (They Alone Know) is a
fascinating and funny play built
on a series of mysteries which
become progressivly more en
tangled. The suspense rises to
near unbearable heights as the
audience witnesses the an
guished sighs, tortured looks,
and pregnant pauses which
greet the mysterious phone
call, secret letter and un
explained arrivals and depar
tures characterizing the play.
Finally the play climaxes and
the audience waits expectantly
for the mysteries to be re
vealed. Instead, they are in
formed via one of the charac
ters that "It is not necessary to
tell "them," They will under

stand maybe someday."
The three plays were per
formed by Kamal Zein's French
Theatre class under his direc
tion.
According to actress Amy
Van Rensselaer, "Eux Seuls"
was difficult to enact since the
actors understood the play's
mysteries no better than the
audience. She explained that
the text often provided no
clues as to how lines should be
delivered and consequently
the actors had to rely heavily
on their own imaginations to
create character motivation.
Parody
"Oswald et Zenaide," the
second play performed, is a
humorous parody of the ar
tifices of 19th century romantic
drama. It is the story of an en
gaged couple awkwardly and
vainly trying to summon the
courage to tell each other that
their respective parents have
forbidden the marriage. The
comic tension is created in the
immense gap between what
the couple really want to say
and the banalities they in fact
utter.
The well timed repartee be
tween Jacques Landy and Pat
ricia Ward is not only funny but
communicates effectively the
frustration of the two lovers.
Wanting desperately to ex
press themselves, they can do
no more than fall back on the
worn-out role patterns charac
teristic of the romantic period.
The confinement of Oswald
and Zenaide to their respective
chairs creates visually the
sense of their imprisonment
by society's conventions.
The problem of man's inabil
ity to communicate with his fel
low men also figures in the last
play, "Qui est la?" (Who is
there?). While the preceding
play criticizes society through

comic devices, "Qui est la?"
does so in dead earnest.
The program's unexpected
departure from comedy posed
some problems for audience
members who, primed for
laughter, were prpne to laugh
anyway in spite of the piece's
sober nature.
Deafening silence charac
terizes the play, reminding one
of an Antonioni film. The
sparse plot depicts a family of
three eating dinner. Each
stares into his plate and with
motions excruciatingly slow
and rhythmic, lifts fork to
mouth. The father attempts
conversation with banalities
about the weather, but his
words fall on deaf ears.
A dark shadow behind the
family, suggestive perhaps of
man's conscience, turns
dramatically warning the father
that he will soon receive a por
tentous visit. A knock on the
door reveals a visitor in black
who advances towards the
father, strangling him. Later,
father returns tp tell his family
the meaning of the darkness
into which he has gone with
countless others. He says that
man's essence has been killed.
He is no longer a man.
Mood
The mood of the play reflects
the post-WWII atmosphere in
which it was written, com
mented director Kamal Zein.
Like many of the playwrights of
the absurd, Tardieu communi
cates a distrubing sense of
emptiness in his play, the
meaning of man's existence
shattered in war's brutality.
Although the actors of Kam
al's "troupe" are students of
French not theater, their per
formance was graced by an
energy and obvious under
standing of the plays that is no
small feat even in professional
theater.
If the enthusiasm with which
the plays were received by the
audience of francophones and
francophiles that overflowed
the living room "theater" of La
Maison Francaise, is any mea
sure, "la soiree etait un suc
cess." The troupe is now discus
sing presenting the play once
again next quarter. With luck the
master of ceremonies will have
been recharged, allowing him
once again to usher the audi
ence into the theater of the ab
surd.

behind the curtain reach out,

So the Cafe Theatre ushered in
its audience last weekend at
the Maison Francaise, setting
the tone for the ensuing pre
sentation of three one act plays
by Jean Tardies — style: not
surprisingly, "theater of the
absurd."
In good cafe-theater tradi
tion, the evening's entertain
ment was a melange ranging all
the way from high "drawing
room" comedy to serious
drama interspersed with inter
ludes of classical violin duets.
Entangling
The first play, "Eux Seuls le
Savent" (They Alone Know) is a
fascinating and funny play built
on a series of mysteries which
become progressivly more en
tangled. The suspense rises to
near unbearable heights as the
audience witnesses the an
guished sighs, tortured looks,
and pregnant pauses which
greet the mysterious phone
call, secret letter and un
explained arrivals and depar
tures characterizing the play.
Finally the play climaxes and
the audience waits expectantly
for the mysteries to be re
vealed. Instead, they are in
formed via one of the charac
ters that "It is not necessary to
tell "them," They will under

stand maybe someday."
The three plays were per
formed by Kamal Zein's French
Theatre class under his direc
tion.
According to actress Amy
Van Rensselaer, "Eux Seuls"
was difficult to enact since the
actors understood the play's
mysteries no better than the
audience. She explained that
the text often provided no
clues as to how lines should be
delivered and consequently
the actors had to rely heavily
on their own imaginations to
create character motivation.
Parody
"Oswald et Zenaide," the
second play performed, is a
humorous parody of the ar
tifices of 19th century romantic
drama. It is the story of an en
gaged couple awkwardly and
vainly trying to summon the
courage to tell each other that
their respective parents have
forbidden the marriage. The
comic tension is created in the
immense gap between what
the couple really want to say
and the banalities they in fact
utter.
The well timed repartee be
tween Jacques Landy and Pat
ricia Ward is not only funny but
communicates effectively the
frustration of the two lovers.
Wanting desperately to ex
press themselves, they can do
no more than fall back on the
worn-out role patterns charac
teristic of the romantic period.
The confinement of Oswald
and Zenaide to their respective
chairs creates visually the
sense of their imprisonment
by society's conventions.
The problem of man's inabil
ity to communicate with his fel
low men also figures in the last
play, "Qui est la?" (Who is
there?). While the preceding
play criticizes society through

comic devices, "Qui est la?"
does so in dead earnest.
The program's unexpected
departure from comedy posed
some problems for audience
members who, primed for
laughter, were prpne to laugh
anyway in spite of the piece's
sober nature.
Deafening silence charac
terizes the play, reminding one
of an Antonioni film. The
sparse plot depicts a family of
three eating dinner. Each
stares into his plate and with
motions excruciatingly slow
and rhythmic, lifts fork to
mouth. The father attempts
conversation with banalities
about the weather, but his
words fall on deaf ears.
A dark shadow behind the
family, suggestive perhaps of
man's conscience, turns
dramatically warning the father
that he will soon receive a por
tentous visit. A knock on the
door reveals a visitor in black
who advances towards the
father, strangling him. Later,
father returns tp tell his family
the meaning of the darkness
into which he has gone with
countless others. He says that
man's essence has been killed.
He is no longer a man.

sparse plot depicts a family of
three eating dinner. Each
stares into his plate and with
motions excruciatingly slow
and rhythmic, lifts fork to
mouth. The father attempts
conversation with banalities
about the weather, but his
words fall on deaf ears.
A dark shadow behind the
family, suggestive perhaps of
man's conscience, turns
dramatically warning the father
that he will soon receive a por
tentous visit. A knock on the
door reveals a visitor in black
who advances towards the
father, strangling him. Later,
father returns tp tell his family
the meaning of the darkness
into which he has gone with
countless others. He says that
man's essence has been killed.
He is no longer a man.
Mood
The mood of the play reflects
the post-WWII atmosphere in
which it was written, com
mented director Kamal Zein.
Like many of the playwrights of
the absurd, Tardieu communi
cates a distrubing sense of
emptiness in his play, the
meaning of man's existence
shattered in war's brutality.
Although the actors of Kam
al's "troupe" are students of
French not theater, their per
formance was graced by an
energy and obvious under
standing of the plays that is no
small feat even in professional
theater.
If the enthusiasm with which
the plays were received by the
audience of francophones and
francophiles that overflowed
the living room "theater" of La
Maison Francaise, is any mea
sure, "la soiree etait un suc
cess." The troupe is now discus
sing presenting the play once
again next quarter. With luck the
master of ceremonies will have
been recharged, allowing him
once again to usher the audi
ence into the theater of the ab
surd.

The master of ceremony ap
pears, headphones clipped to
his ears. Fie commences the
evening's program, "Bonsoir
mesdames et messieurs" —
pause — there seems to be
some head phone interference
— he resumes — more static —
angrily he rips at the cord inad
vertently disconnecting his
head set — in midstream, his
speech slowly winds to a halt
much like a tired phonograph
whose batteries have finally
conked out. A pair of hands
behind the curtain reach out,
bodily removing him off stage.
So the Cafe Theatre ushered in
its audience last weekend at
the Maison Francaise, setting
the tone for the ensuing pre
sentation of three one act plays
by Jean Tardies — style: not
surprisingly, "theater of the
absurd."
In good cafe-theater tradi
tion, the evening's entertain
ment was a melange ranging all
the way from high "drawing
room" comedy to serious
drama interspersed with inter
ludes of classical violin duets.
Entangling
The first play, "Eux Seuls le
Savent" (They Alone Know) is a
fascinating and funny play built
on a series of mysteries which
become progressivly more en
tangled. The suspense rises to
near unbearable heights as the
audience witnesses the an
guished sighs, tortured looks,
and pregnant pauses which
greet the mysterious phone
call, secret letter and un
explained arrivals and depar
tures characterizing the play.
Finally the play climaxes and
the audience waits expectantly
for the mysteries to be re
vealed. Instead, they are in
formed via one of the charac
ters that "It is not necessary to
tell "them," They will under

stand maybe someday."
The three plays were per
formed by Kamal Zein's French
Theatre class under his direc
tion.
According to actress Amy
Van Rensselaer, "Eux Seuls"
was difficult to enact since the
actors understood the play's
mysteries no better than the
audience. She explained that
the text often provided no
clues as to how lines should be
delivered and consequently
the actors had to rely heavily
on their own imaginations to
create character motivation.
Parody
"Oswald et Zenaide," the
second play performed, is a
humorous parody of the ar
tifices of 19th century romantic
drama. It is the story of an en
gaged couple awkwardly and
vainly trying to summon the
courage to tell each other that
their respective parents have
forbidden the marriage. The
comic tension is created in the
immense gap between what
the couple really want to say
and the banalities they in fact
utter.
The well timed repartee be
tween Jacques Landy and Pat
ricia Ward is not only funny but
communicates effectively the
frustration of the two lovers.
Wanting desperately to ex
press themselves, they can do
no more than fall back on the
worn-out role patterns charac
teristic of the romantic period.
The confinement of Oswald
and Zenaide to their respective
chairs creates visually the
sense of their imprisonment
by society's conventions.
The problem of man's inabil
ity to communicate with his fel
low men also figures in the last
play, "Qui est la?" (Who is
there?). While the preceding
play criticizes society through

comic devices, "Qui est la?"
does so in dead earnest.
The program's unexpected
departure from comedy posed
some problems for audience
members who, primed for
laughter, were prpne to laugh
anyway in spite of the piece's
sober nature.
Deafening silence charac
terizes the play, reminding one
of an Antonioni film. The
sparse plot depicts a family of
three eating dinner. Each
stares into his plate and with
motions excruciatingly slow
and rhythmic, lifts fork to
mouth. The father attempts
conversation with banalities
about the weather, but his
