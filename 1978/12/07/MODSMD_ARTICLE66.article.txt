The name of Alexis de
Tocqueville should be famil
iar to many students. His
work, Democracy in
America, is on class reading
lists for American history,
political science and public
policy. Now, a century and a
half after the time of Toc
queville, Eugene McCarthy
offers a new perspective on
democracy in America with
his book, America Revi
sited: 150 Years After Toc
queville.
In 1831, the Frenchman,
with his fellow countryman,
Gustave de Beaumont, voy
aged to America in order to
observe the new republic
first hand. Their official mis
sion was a study of Ameri
can methods of prison re
form. "But while working
on the penitentiary sys
tem," as Beaumont wrote
his father, "we shall be visit
ing its inhabitants, its cities,
its institutions, its customs;
we shall come to know the
mechanism of its republican
government. . . . Would
not that be a fine book
which would give an exact
conception of the American
people, would paint its
character in bold strokes,
would analyze its social
conditions and would re
ctify so many opinions
which are erroneous on this

point?"
Such a book wak Democ
racy in America, the end re
sult of Tocqueville's nine
months in America: an
analysis of democracy's ef
fects on the people and so
cial institution! of the new
world. Eugene McCarthy,
the former U.S. senator
from Minnesota, has taken
Tocqueville's observations
as a jumping-off point for
his own book, America Re
visited, which becomes a
continuation of the earlier
study.
McCarthy has chosen 11
major categories of Ameri
can life, including native
Americans, blacks, the law,
economy, religion, the
presidents (and the prison
system). He describes each
situation as seen by Toc
queville in 1831, and then
traces the historical de
velopment of the people or
institutions from those
pre-Civil War years to the
Carter administration.
Measurement of progress
The "before and after"
images which result point
out the underlying purpose
of the book: to see whether
the observations and pre
dictions of Tocqueville have
held true. America Revisited
implies a measurement of
our progress — for better or
for worse.
The book is faulted only
by some instances of trifling
historical detail. In an effort
to create a vivid and corn

plete picture of conditions
in the early 19th century,
McCarthy over-indulges
himself in a few cases, as
when, in the introduction,
Tocqueville s itinerary and
modes of travel are de
scribed to us down to the
construction of the car
riages and names of the
ships. The unfortunate ef
fect of this is to slow the
reading unnecessarily at
times, and to detract from
the impact of the text.
Viable
But aside from the detail
trap, America Revisited is a
very viable work. Tocquevil
le's writing, history and cur
rent analysis are incorpo
rated into the whole by
McCarthy's clear, simple
style, and the reader comes
away from the book with a
unique double image of this
nation.
The questions posed by
McCarthy and the investiga
tion of our progress are in
triguing. America Revisited
demonstrates the author's
intelligent perceptions of
America and the changes
we have necessarily gone
through. The perspective of
McCarthy as both politician
and American citizen is re
spected by the reader as he
urges us to be both critical
of our past and hopeful for
the future — if we have
learned to keep goals and
ideals in line with our
choices for change.
