The perfect mixture: two ex
cellent Stanford professors,
one controversial issue, a lot of
scientific data and references,
plus one rather sensationalistic
title capitalizing on one of the
author's past best-sellers. The
product: The Race Bomb,
which does succeed — though
not quite predictably — not
only in presenting a great deal
of information, but also in exp
laining it in such a way as to be
understandable to almost any
one'.
This book, by Paul Ehrlich
and S. Shirley Feldman, de
bunksthe myth of a correlation
between skin color and IQ,
focusing in particular on the
hypothesis proposed by
psychologist Arthur Jensen
among others. Interpreting
data from "standardized"
tests, he proposes that people
with lighter skins are geneti
cally superior to those with
darker ones. When inter
viewed, Ehrlich compared the
scientific nature of this
hypothesis to a study compari
son eye colorand performance
on the California State driver's
exam.
Ehrlich and Feldman are well
qualified for their task. Ehrlich
is a population biologist
known in the scientific world
for his work on ecology, as well
as in the more general culture
for his concern with overpopu
lation and conservation of re
sources as voiced in The Popu
lation Bomb and The End of Af
fluence. During the book's
discussion of sub-species and
races, Ehrlich was able to draw
from his own work not only for
experience and information,
but also for examples of earlier
trends towards overspeciation.
Ehrlich's expertise lies in
population genetics and the
ecology and evolution of
species. Feldman's lies in
psychology, particularly in
child psychology. Her current
research investigates family re

lationships, with special em
phasis on the different ways
men and women relate to chil
dren. She is thus admirably
suited to a discussion of IQ
tests, their meanings, limita
tions and interpretations.
Currently Feldman holds as
sistant professorships in the
departments ol Psychology
and Human Biology here.
Ehrlich is a professor in the
Biology Department, and Bing
professor m I'opulation
Studies. Also closely involved
in the book were the authors'
spouses, Anne Ehrlich and
Marcus W. Feldman, also
biologists here. Historically
significant in terms of the race
intelligence debate is the au
thors' location at Stanford,
which still has a somewhat ra
cist reputation primarily due to
the past presences of Lewis
Terman and William Shockley.
While The Race Bomb is well
founded in science and is ex
tensively annotated and refer
enced for further study, the
book is basically directed to
wards a lay-public. Explaining
the general tone of the book
and its generally sensationalis
ts packaging, Ehrlich re
marked that the data against
the Jensen hypothesis has
beenaround foryearsavailable
to those already convinced of
its invalidity. The Race Bomb is
directed towards those who
have more opinions and feel
ings about the issue than facts,
permitting them to inform
themselves and speak intelli
gently about the issue to
others.
Serious readers should not
be put off by the publishers
hype, especially in the paper
back edition published this
year. Ehrlich explained that the
publishers had chosen the ti
tle, instead of theauthors' title,
Skin Deep.
As the authors point out
numerous times, especially in
the first part of the book, the
race/intelligence controversy
has been around for centuries.
Claiming a group of people
genetically or racially inferior
has been a favorite technique
for justifying their oppression,
exemplified by white settlers'
approach to native Americans,
as well as by Hitler against the
Jews, and the United States
military against the Viet
namese. J
The authors' purpose in writ
ing the book, Ehrlich
explained, was to help society
to avoid direct — usually vio
lent — confrontations, for
example race riots, between
peoples of different skin col
ors. A second purpose grew
out of Ehrlich's concern with
the overpopulation problem
and its concurrent strain on the
earth's resources. Now to
solve these problems many
minds cooperating wiII be
necessary to survive. Popula
tion control must be ac

complished without the threat
of genocide.
As well as dispelling the
myth, the authors ask the
deeper questions of why the
research concerning the rela
tionship between race and in
telligence should be done at
all:

"Scientific investigations
must either help us understand
how the universe or some part
of it works, or they must help
us solve some specific practical
problem. Investigating the
genetics of 'racial' differences
in IQ would do neither."
