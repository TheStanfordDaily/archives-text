Some Do
Jane DeLynn
Macmillan
350 pp. 19.95
Macmillan's advance public
ity for Jane DeLynn's Some Do
praises it as "a wickedly intelli
gent comedy," "the anger of
the '60s made real" and "an in
credible, moving comic
drama." My opinion differs.
The front-cover compares
DeLynn to "a Jane Austen who
has dropped acid," yet De-
Lynn's jium.or never ap
proaches% Austen's fine sense
of satire. Some Do is a spoof of
Berkeley life in the '60s and
seven women discovering
themselves and 'each other.
DeLynn's story is as shallow
and simplistic as the characters
she mocks — a frigid but beaut
iful blonde, a wealthy, re
volutionary hemophiliac, a
black lesbian, a dumpy,
lower-middle class house
wife. . . .
Perhaps, though, DeLynn's
prose damns itself more aptly
than any reviewer could: "Her

dendrites arid axoms were tir
ing like crazy, reaching toward
each other with littje flashes of
electricity that burned her
synapses like cognac." DeLynn
creates complexity in her
characters by writing such stuff
as "The only thing he really
cared about . . . was a good
cup of coffee. He'd trade his
postdoctoral research on sub
atomic particles for one now.
He was addicted to the stuff!"
DeLynn leans on exclama
tion marks as a crutch for h£r
inability to create excitement
within her sentences. Her
prose irritates and bores. Her
story exploits the popularity of
other '60s novels without cap
turing Berkeley's rich personal
ity.
Due to its string of repellent
incidents, Some Do cannot
even excuse itself as light but
pleasurable reading. The only
resemblances between the
heavy-handed DeLynn and the
talented Austen are by virtue of
their first names and sex, for
some do write well and Some
Do not.
