# Politicians question future of the City's gay community
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — This ci
ty's large and active homosex
ual community, guided to
political clout by the slain Har
vey Milk, now struggles for
leadership less than a month
after its greatest triumph.
Milk, elected to the powerful
Board of Supervisors last year,

was shot dead last week.
Mayor George Moscone, a
strong supporter of gay rights,
also was killed.
Dan White, a former super
visor who was one of the most
vocal opponents of the
homosexual community, was
charged with the murders but

police said the City Hall slay
ings were not connected to gay
rights.
Nevertheless, the death of
Milk left his supporters bewil
dered and left an air of despair
on Castro Street in the heart of
San Francisco's homosexual
community, where Milk once

owned a camera store and was
a familiar figure for years.
An estimated one-sixth of
San Francisco's 660,000 resi
dents are homosexual and they
have grown increasingly active
in politics, staging massive
voter registration drives and
drawing the support of most

major politicians.
White, however, was not
among them. He was the only
supervisor to vote against a
homosexual rights ordinance
introduced by Milk this year
and the only supervisor to vote
against closing Market Street
for the Cay Freedom Day
parade in )une, which drew
240,000 people. •
Milk was the undisputed
leader of the gay community.
He was the first open
homosexual elected to office
in California and the most visi
ble proponent of gay rights.
Wf state Sen. John Briggs
of Fullerton successfully got a
measure on the California bal
lot against homosexual school
teachers, Milk led the chal
lenge. Milk and Briggs debated
each other many times

throughout the state.
The measure was defeated
Nov. 7, the first statewide vic
tory for gay rights in the na
tion's history, and Castro
Street was exuberant that night
with hundreds of joyous
people. Milk and Moscone
were among them.
Now, the street is literally
draped in mourning. Above
the door of one gay bar is a
huge American flag with a
broad black cloth down the
middle.
There is talk that Diane
Feinstein, the new mayor who
will serve for one more year in
Moscone s spot, should ap
point a homosexual to serve
the remainder of Milk's term,
which expires in January 1980.
But who?
"There is nobody who has

the political leadership Harvey
did," said Jim Thies of the Pride
Foundation, one of the city's
oldest gay rights organizations.
Milk, fearing he would be a
target of violence, left a taped
recording made shortly after
his election listing the names
of several people he would like
to succeed him in the event of
his death.
That portion of the tape has
not been made public but pub
lished reports speculated that
Anne Kronenberg, his City Hall
aide, and Harry Britt, president
of the San Francisco Gay
Democratic Club, were
named.
Milk considered himself
only one of many leaders of the
homosexual rights movement
but often rued the divisiveness
in the community.
"You name me the black
leader who controls the black
community in this city," he
said. "There isn't one. There
are 40 or 50 black leaders. The
same is true of the Chicano
community. There's not one
group that's ever had it all to
gether, and gays are even more
divided because we cover all
economic strata and racial and
ethnic groups."

his election listing the names
of several people he would like
to succeed him in the event of
his death.
That portion of the tape has
not been made public but pub
lished reports speculated that
Anne Kronenberg, his City Hall
aide, and Harry Britt, president
of the San Francisco Gay
Democratic Club, were
named.
Milk considered himself
only one of many leaders of the
homosexual rights movement
but often rued the divisiveness
in the community.
"You name me the black
leader who controls the black
community in this city," he
said. "There isn't one. There
are 40 or 50 black leaders. The
same is true of the Chicano
community. There's not one
group that's ever had it all to
gether, and gays are even more
divided because we cover all
economic strata and racial and
ethnic groups."
San Francisco (AP) — This ci
ty's large and active homosex
ual community, guided to
political clout by the slain Har
vey Milk, now struggles for
leadership less than a month
after its greatest triumph.
Milk, elected to the powerful
Board of Supervisors last year,

was shot dead last week.
Mayor George Moscone, a
strong supporter of gay rights,
also was killed.
Dan White, a former super
visor who was one of the most
vocal opponents of the
homosexual community, was
charged with the murders but

police said the City Hall slay
ings were not connected to gay
rights.
Nevertheless, the death of
Milk left his supporters bewil
dered and left an air of despair
on Castro Street in the heart of
San Francisco's homosexual
community, where Milk once

owned a camera store and was
a familiar figure for years.
An estimated one-sixth of
San Francisco's 660,000 resi
dents are homosexual and they
have grown increasingly active
in politics, staging massive
voter registration drives and
drawing the support of most

major politicians.
White, however, was not
among them. He was the only
supervisor to vote against a
homosexual rights ordinance
introduced by Milk this year
and the only supervisor to vote
against closing Market Street
for the Cay Freedom Day
parade in )une, which drew
240,000 people. •
Milk was the undisputed
leader of the gay community.
He was the first open
homosexual elected to office
in California and the most visi
ble proponent of gay rights.
Wf state Sen. John Briggs
of Fullerton successfully got a
measure on the California bal
lot against homosexual school
teachers, Milk led the chal
lenge. Milk and Briggs debated
each other many times

throughout the state.
The measure was defeated
Nov. 7, the first statewide vic
tory for gay rights in the na
tion's history, and Castro
Street was exuberant that night
with hundreds of joyous
people. Milk and Moscone
were among them.
Now, the street is literally
draped in mourning. Above
the door of one gay bar is a
huge American flag with a
broad black cloth down the
middle.
There is talk that Diane
Feinstein, the new mayor who
will serve for one more year in
Moscone s spot, should ap
point a homosexual to serve
the remainder of Milk's term,
which expires in January 1980.
But who?
"There is nobody who has

the political leadership Harvey
did," said Jim Thies of the Pride
Foundation, one of the city's
oldest gay rights organizations.
Milk, fearing he would be a
target of violence, left a taped
recording made shortly after
his election listing the names
of several people he would like
to succeed him in the event of
his death.
