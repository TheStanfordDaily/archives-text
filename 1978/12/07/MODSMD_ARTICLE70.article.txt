The Human Factor
Graham Greene
Simon and Schuster
339 pp. $9.95
"Isn't it the story-teller's task" asks
Graham Greene in a letter to V.S. Pritchett,
"to act as the devil's advocate, to elicit
sympathy and a measure of understanding
for those who lie outside the boundaries
of State sympathy?"
The difference and the link between pri
vate and political worlds is a major theme
of Greene's new novel The Human Factor.
Maurice Castle, the hero of The Human
Factor has our sympathy. He is 62 and
works in a small department of the British
Intelligence Service (Ml 6) dealing with Af
rican affairs. He lives in a London suburb,
happily married, with his African wife
Sarah and her son by a previous lover,
Sam.
Because the Communists help his South
African wife and her son get out of South
Africa, Castle passes on classified informa
tion to the Russians.
Peanut mold
When the leak is discovered Castle es
capes suspicion because of his low profile

and correct social background.
His young colleague, Davis, is not so
lucky. He is a bachelor, careless with his
money who enjoys expensive port to ex
cess, drives fast cars and has rather doubt
ful political views.
Daintry, the head of security, does not
want a public trial that would cause embar
rassment. Davis is disposed of by Dr. Per
cival, an obsessive fly-fisherman, with a
toxin made of peanut mold.
Castle has to stop reporting after Davis'
death in order to avoid suspicion. He
chooses a line from Tolstoy's War and
Peace as key for his last message, "You
say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand
and let it fall." It is a message of defiance to
both services.
Peace of mind
Castle is not after ideologies, "not the
city of God or Marx but the city called
Peace of Mind." His ideal is a world where
Sarah would not have to wake up in terror,
pursued by nightmares of her life in
Johannesburg, and where Sam would not
feel different from the rest of the boys at
school.
Castle is completely alone, he cannot
unburden his conscience to anyone, not

even to Sarah. He is saved from a mental
b/eakdown only by his Russian contact
Boris to whom he admits that "Hate's li
able to make mistakes, it's as dangerous as
love. I am doubly dangerous Boris, be
cause I love too. Love's fault in both of our
services."
Final irony
The final irony is that the information
Castle has risked his life for was used only
to uncover an agent in Moscow and Castle
is to be used for propaganda by the Rus
sians who want to discredit the British Sec
ret Service.
While Greene may be saying that if you
don't play the game by the rules you are
liable to be used, in the final analysis, what
counts is that we have to live with our
individual consciences.
As an examination of the life in the Sec
ret Service the book does not approach
the mastery of John le Carre and the
characters are not as well developed as in
Greene's other works. But the style is sim
ple and powerful, with superb craftsman
ship, reminding us that Greene is one of
the best novelists that British literature has
to offer.

Castle is completely alone, he cannot
unburden his conscience to anyone, not

even to Sarah. He is saved from a mental
b/eakdown only by his Russian contact
Boris to whom he admits that "Hate's li
able to make mistakes, it's as dangerous as
love. I am doubly dangerous Boris, be
cause I love too. Love's fault in both of our
services."
Final irony
The final irony is that the information
Castle has risked his life for was used only
to uncover an agent in Moscow and Castle
is to be used for propaganda by the Rus
sians who want to discredit the British Sec
ret Service.
While Greene may be saying that if you
don't play the game by the rules you are
liable to be used, in the final analysis, what
counts is that we have to live with our
individual consciences.
As an examination of the life in the Sec
ret Service the book does not approach
the mastery of John le Carre and the
characters are not as well developed as in
Greene's other works. But the style is sim
ple and powerful, with superb craftsman
ship, reminding us that Greene is one of
the best novelists that British literature has
to offer.

The Human Factor
Graham Greene
Simon and Schuster
339 pp. $9.95
"Isn't it the story-teller's task" asks
Graham Greene in a letter to V.S. Pritchett,
"to act as the devil's advocate, to elicit
sympathy and a measure of understanding
for those who lie outside the boundaries
of State sympathy?"
The difference and the link between pri
vate and political worlds is a major theme
of Greene's new novel The Human Factor.
Maurice Castle, the hero of The Human
Factor has our sympathy. He is 62 and
works in a small department of the British
Intelligence Service (Ml 6) dealing with Af
rican affairs. He lives in a London suburb,
happily married, with his African wife
Sarah and her son by a previous lover,
Sam.
Because the Communists help his South
African wife and her son get out of South
Africa, Castle passes on classified informa
tion to the Russians.
Peanut mold
When the leak is discovered Castle es
capes suspicion because of his low profile

and correct social background.
His young colleague, Davis, is not so
lucky. He is a bachelor, careless with his
money who enjoys expensive port to ex
cess, drives fast cars and has rather doubt
ful political views.
Daintry, the head of security, does not
want a public trial that would cause embar
rassment. Davis is disposed of by Dr. Per
cival, an obsessive fly-fisherman, with a
toxin made of peanut mold.
Castle has to stop reporting after Davis'
death in order to avoid suspicion. He
chooses a line from Tolstoy's War and
Peace as key for his last message, "You
say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand
and let it fall." It is a message of defiance to
both services.
Peace of mind
Castle is not after ideologies, "not the
city of God or Marx but the city called
Peace of Mind." His ideal is a world where
Sarah would not have to wake up in terror,
pursued by nightmares of her life in
Johannesburg, and where Sam would not
feel different from the rest of the boys at
school.
