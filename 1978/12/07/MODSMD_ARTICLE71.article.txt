Notable Books on Chinese
Studies
C.H. Lowe
China Printing, Ltd.
228 pp. $10
At first, Notable Books on
Chinese Studies appears to
be an extensive reference
guide meant for Chinese
scholars. It lists sources
(over 1500) for many diffe
rent fields of study in
Chinese culture, and gives
an annotated bibliography
for each.
But before each subject
division, the author/
researcher C.H. Lowe has
written introductory essays
which summarize and give
some of his thoughts on the
subject area. These essays
are directed to people who
haven't studied the Chinese
(which includes a great
number of us, I'm afraid).
The essays invite and even
provoke the reader to look

further.
And the wonderful thing
about this is that the work of
finding the most pertinent
sources has already been
done. The essays lead
smoothly into the bibliog
raphy. Subject areas in
clude: agriculture, architec
ture, history, poetry,
philosophy and Chinese
women.
That C.H. Lowe, since re
tiring from the Stanford Lib
rary system in 1970, spent
the time and energy to
complete the quantities of
research a book like this en
tails, gives an indication of
his enthusiasm for the sub
ject. Actually, he completed
this book in only two years.
He has written several other
books on the Chinese (The
Chinese in Hawaii, Japan's
Economic Offensive in
China, Facing Labor Issues
in China). Lowe says that he
has been keeping himself

intellectually alert (and
physically fit) "through
reading, research and a bit
of writing."
Just paging through
Lowe's book is worthwhile,
but it is hard to stop there.
Notable Books on Chinese
Studies is itself a notable
book on Chinese Studies,
especially in that it makes us
want to know more about
the Chinese, and encour
ages our study by making
the research painless.
