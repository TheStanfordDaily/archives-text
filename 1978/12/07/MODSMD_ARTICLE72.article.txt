The World s Greatest Lover it
Sunday, Mem Aud
In this schizoid comedy, Gene
Wilder tries to be Keaton, Chap
lin and Fellini; he should relax
and try being himself. Wilder has
enormous talent, but everything
he does here — his writing, act
ing and direction — is just an af
fectation, and it's a rather sad
(and unnecessary) exhibition.
With Dom DeLuise and Carol
Kane.
—Ron Lillejord
The Seduction of Mimi ★★★★
Thursday-Friday, New Varsity
Giancarlo Giannini plays Mimi,
a victim of bruised male ego who
reacts to his wife's commission of
adultery by vowing to have sex
with her lover's wife. This is one
of director Lina Wertmuller's
best efforts. Here she juggles
comedy and pathos with an ex
pert touch, with little of the stri
dency that sometimes mars her
other satires. A very funny, ulti
mately moving film.
—Jim Mattson

Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
$14 million to a different use. Or,
better yet, maybe they should
keep making these safe, inoffen
sive and generally well made en
tertainments and use the profits
to take some chances with un
usual projects and new filmmak
ers. Probably won't happen
though; the board of directors
would never allow it.
—R.L.

You Only Live Twice ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
The Chaparral ends its very
good film series with this Sean
Connery James Bond movie. A
perfect Dead Week movie: lots
of '60s sex and violence, double
agents, triple agents and special
effects. Oh yes. lames almost
gets married in this one.
— R.L.
Bread and Chocolate ★★★
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alto
This story of an Italian immig
rant who is battered by the sys
tem when he tries to make a go of
it in Switzerland's promised land
doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this movie
has a wit and warmth which make
it eminently watchable. Nino
Manfredi, as the immigrant, has
one of those faces which can
make nearly anything seem
either funny or tragic. Anna
Karina is fine as an immigrant
from Greece; Franco Brusati di
rected.
—J.M.

Autumn Sonata ★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.

Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San lose
One of the year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
— J.M.
Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—J.M.
Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the
ater feeling as if you've slept all
night with your mouth open.
—J.M.

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Francisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.
—|.M.
The Wii ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every
thing — but make sure that we
don't offend anybody. In his de
sire to energize this sprawling
mess, Sidney Lumet, the direc
tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en
larged the sets. Subtlety and in
dividuality are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? Vou can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so huge, so loud in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.

Paradise Alley ★ ★
Old Mill
Sylvester Stallone can't seem
to deal with his success; maybe
he needs to be poor again.
Paradise Alley is a meticulously
crafted, smooth and curiously
lifeless movie, and if Stallone
didn't needlessly shout so much
in it, you'd probably forget about
the film 10 minutes after you'd
seen it.
—R.L.
Maffic ★★
Alexandria, San Francisco
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's a dummy in the )udy Car
land part and the star-on-the
way-down role is taken by An
thony Hopkins as a ventriloquist.
Director Richard Attenborough
pulls off one or two scary mo
ments, but this pseudo
psychological story of a ven
triloquist who becomes obses
sed with his own mannequin has
been done too many times be
fore — and better.
—).M.
A Wedding ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
perfbrmance of great emotional
range.
—R.L.

Animdl House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

Comes d Horseman ★★★★
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
movie is so enjoyable because it
revives the pleasure of the west
ern or merely exploits the vie
wer's nostalgia for the genre.
Whatever the reasons, this is a
very seductive piece of filmmak
ing, helped immeasurably by its
performers: lane Fonda, James
Caan and lason Robards, who
plays the heavy with malicious
joy.
—J.M.

Dream of Passion ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
)ules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have tlesh on them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious; she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The movie has more murky reg
ions than it should, and tries a
little too hard to be profound on
the subjects of art and life. Vet,
Dassin probes regions of desire
and rage that are usually hidden,
and scores most of his emotional
points triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein

The Man Who loved Women
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alio ***
inis, director nancois Truf
taut's most recent work, may be >
too light for general consump
tion, but if you allow Truffaut his
conceit — that the not-too- J
attractive male lead, who is ob
sessed with women, is irresistible ,
to them —you will probably have »
a very good time. Truffaut's
charm is here, and his touch is
sure — but he's like a practiced
dealer with familiarcards; it's just
a diversion. With Brigitte Fossey j
and Leslie Caron.

The World's Greatest Lover


A Dream of Passion


Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?
The World s Greatest Lover it
Sunday, Mem Aud
In this schizoid comedy, Gene
Wilder tries to be Keaton, Chap
lin and Fellini; he should relax
and try being himself. Wilder has
enormous talent, but everything
he does here — his writing, act
ing and direction — is just an af
fectation, and it's a rather sad
(and unnecessary) exhibition.
With Dom DeLuise and Carol
Kane.
—Ron Lillejord
The Seduction of Mimi ★★★★
Thursday-Friday, New Varsity
Giancarlo Giannini plays Mimi,
a victim of bruised male ego who
reacts to his wife's commission of
adultery by vowing to have sex
with her lover's wife. This is one
of director Lina Wertmuller's
best efforts. Here she juggles
comedy and pathos with an ex
pert touch, with little of the stri
dency that sometimes mars her
other satires. A very funny, ulti
mately moving film.
—Jim Mattson

Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
$14 million to a different use. Or,
better yet, maybe they should
keep making these safe, inoffen
sive and generally well made en
tertainments and use the profits
to take some chances with un
usual projects and new filmmak
ers. Probably won't happen
though; the board of directors
would never allow it.
—R.L.

You Only Live Twice ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
The Chaparral ends its very
good film series with this Sean
Connery James Bond movie. A
perfect Dead Week movie: lots
of '60s sex and violence, double
agents, triple agents and special
effects. Oh yes. lames almost
gets married in this one.
— R.L.
Bread and Chocolate ★★★
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alto
This story of an Italian immig
rant who is battered by the sys
tem when he tries to make a go of
it in Switzerland's promised land
doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this movie
has a wit and warmth which make
it eminently watchable. Nino
Manfredi, as the immigrant, has
one of those faces which can
make nearly anything seem
either funny or tragic. Anna
Karina is fine as an immigrant
from Greece; Franco Brusati di
rected.

Autumn Sonata ★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.

Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San lose
One of the year's most promis

its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so

Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex

This textbook case of rabid

Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the

—J.M.

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Francisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.

A corporate executive's idea of

tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en
larged the sets. Subtlety and in

technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos

Who do we fear for? Vou can't

Paradise Alley ★ ★
Old Mill
Sylvester Stallone can't seem
to deal with his success; maybe
he needs to be poor again.
Paradise Alley is a meticulously

lifeless movie, and if Stallone
didn't needlessly shout so much
in it, you'd probably forget about
the film 10 minutes after you'd
seen it.

Maffic ★★

Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's a dummy in the )udy Car

thony Hopkins as a ventriloquist.
Director Richard Attenborough
pulls off one or two scary mo

psychological story of a ven
triloquist who becomes obses

been done too many times be

A Wedding ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
perfbrmance of great emotional
range.
—R.L.

Animdl House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Comes d Horseman ★★★★
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this

tasies. And because of this, this

As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one

The World's Greatest Lover


A Dream of Passion


Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?
The World s Greatest Lover it
Sunday, Mem Aud
In this schizoid comedy, Gene
Wilder tries to be Keaton, Chap
lin and Fellini; he should relax
and try being himself. Wilder has
enormous talent, but everything
he does here — his writing, act
ing and direction — is just an af
fectation, and it's a rather sad
(and unnecessary) exhibition.
With Dom DeLuise and Carol
Kane.
—Ron Lillejord
The Seduction of Mimi ★★★★
Thursday-Friday, New Varsity
Giancarlo Giannini plays Mimi,
a victim of bruised male ego who
reacts to his wife's commission of
adultery by vowing to have sex
with her lover's wife. This is one
of director Lina Wertmuller's
best efforts. Here she juggles
comedy and pathos with an ex
pert touch, with little of the stri
dency that sometimes mars her
other satires. A very funny, ulti
mately moving film.
—Jim Mattson

Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
$14 million to a different use. Or,
better yet, maybe they should
keep making these safe, inoffen
sive and generally well made en
tertainments and use the profits
to take some chances with un
usual projects and new filmmak
ers. Probably won't happen
though; the board of directors
would never allow it.

You Only Live Twice ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
The Chaparral ends its very

Aquarius Twin, Palo Alto
This story of an Italian immig

of great comedy, yet this movie
has a wit and warmth which make
it eminently watchable. Nino

Autumn Sonata ★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman

frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea

One of the year's most promis

Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the

nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low

after more than two hours we are

Richard Adams' bunny epic has

Director Martin Rosen has brag

nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every

This is one of those attempts at

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Francisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the

the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.

to deal with his success; maybe
he needs to be poor again.
Paradise Alley is a meticulously
crafted, smooth and curiously
lifeless movie, and if Stallone
didn't needlessly shout so much
in it, you'd probably forget about
the film 10 minutes after you'd
seen it.
—R.L.
Maffic ★★
Alexandria, San Francisco
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's a dummy in the )udy Car
land part and the star-on-the
way-down role is taken by An
thony Hopkins as a ventriloquist.
Director Richard Attenborough
pulls off one or two scary mo
ments, but this pseudo
psychological story of a ven
triloquist who becomes obses
sed with his own mannequin has
been done too many times be
fore — and better.
—).M.
A Wedding ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
perfbrmance of great emotional
range.
—R.L.

Animdl House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

Comes d Horseman ★★★★
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
movie is so enjoyable because it
revives the pleasure of the west
ern or merely exploits the vie
wer's nostalgia for the genre.
Whatever the reasons, this is a
very seductive piece of filmmak

plays the heavy with malicious
joy.

Dream of Passion ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
)ules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have tlesh on them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious; she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The movie has more murky reg
ions than it should, and tries a
little too hard to be profound on
the subjects of art and life. Vet,
Dassin probes regions of desire
and rage that are usually hidden,
and scores most of his emotional
points triumphantly.

The World's Greatest Lover


A Dream of Passion


Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?
The World s Greatest Lover it
Sunday, Mem Aud
In this schizoid comedy, Gene
Wilder tries to be Keaton, Chap
lin and Fellini; he should relax
and try being himself. Wilder has
enormous talent, but everything
he does here — his writing, act
ing and direction — is just an af
fectation, and it's a rather sad
(and unnecessary) exhibition.
With Dom DeLuise and Carol
Kane.
—Ron Lillejord
The Seduction of Mimi ★★★★
Thursday-Friday, New Varsity
Giancarlo Giannini plays Mimi,
a victim of bruised male ego who
reacts to his wife's commission of
adultery by vowing to have sex
with her lover's wife. This is one
of director Lina Wertmuller's
best efforts. Here she juggles
comedy and pathos with an ex
pert touch, with little of the stri
dency that sometimes mars her
other satires. A very funny, ulti
mately moving film.
—Jim Mattson

Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
$14 million to a different use. Or,
better yet, maybe they should
keep making these safe, inoffen
sive and generally well made en
tertainments and use the profits
to take some chances with un
usual projects and new filmmak
ers. Probably won't happen
though; the board of directors
would never allow it.
—R.L.

You Only Live Twice ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
The Chaparral ends its very
good film series with this Sean
Connery James Bond movie. A
perfect Dead Week movie: lots
of '60s sex and violence, double
agents, triple agents and special
effects. Oh yes. lames almost
gets married in this one.

Bread and Chocolate ★★★
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alto
This story of an Italian immig
rant who is battered by the sys
tem when he tries to make a go of
it in Switzerland's promised land
doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this movie
has a wit and warmth which make
it eminently watchable. Nino
Manfredi, as the immigrant, has
one of those faces which can
make nearly anything seem
either funny or tragic. Anna
Karina is fine as an immigrant
from Greece; Franco Brusati di

Autumn Sonata ★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.

Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San lose
One of the year's most promis

its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so

Midnight Express

This textbook case of rabid

Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the

—J.M.

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Francisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.
—|.M.
The Wii ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every

sire to energize this sprawling
mess, Sidney Lumet, the direc
tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en
larged the sets. Subtlety and in
dividuality are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? Vou can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no

erything is so huge, so loud in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Francisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.

The Wii ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every
thing — but make sure that we
don't offend anybody. In his de
sire to energize this sprawling
mess, Sidney Lumet, the direc
tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en
larged the sets. Subtlety and in
dividuality are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? Vou can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so huge, so loud in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.

Paradise Alley ★ ★
Old Mill
Sylvester Stallone can't seem
to deal with his success; maybe
he needs to be poor again.
Paradise Alley is a meticulously
crafted, smooth and curiously
lifeless movie, and if Stallone
didn't needlessly shout so much
in it, you'd probably forget about
the film 10 minutes after you'd
seen it.
—R.L.
Maffic ★★
Alexandria, San Francisco
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's a dummy in the )udy Car
land part and the star-on-the
way-down role is taken by An
thony Hopkins as a ventriloquist.
Director Richard Attenborough
pulls off one or two scary mo
ments, but this pseudo
psychological story of a ven
triloquist who becomes obses
sed with his own mannequin has
been done too many times be
fore — and better.
—).M.
A Wedding ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
perfbrmance of great emotional
range.
—R.L.

Animdl House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

Comes d Horseman ★★★★
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
movie is so enjoyable because it
revives the pleasure of the west
ern or merely exploits the vie
wer's nostalgia for the genre.
Whatever the reasons, this is a
very seductive piece of filmmak
ing, helped immeasurably by its
performers: lane Fonda, James
Caan and lason Robards, who
plays the heavy with malicious
joy.
—J.M.

Dream of Passion ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
)ules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have tlesh on them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious; she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The movie has more murky reg
ions than it should, and tries a
little too hard to be profound on
the subjects of art and life. Vet,
Dassin probes regions of desire
and rage that are usually hidden,
and scores most of his emotional
points triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein

The Man Who loved Women
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alio ***
inis, director nancois Truf
taut's most recent work, may be >
too light for general consump
tion, but if you allow Truffaut his
conceit — that the not-too- J
attractive male lead, who is ob
sessed with women, is irresistible ,
to them —you will probably have »
a very good time. Truffaut's
charm is here, and his touch is
sure — but he's like a practiced
dealer with familiarcards; it's just
a diversion. With Brigitte Fossey j
and Leslie Caron.

The World's Greatest Lover


A Dream of Passion


Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?
The World s Greatest Lover it
Sunday, Mem Aud
In this schizoid comedy, Gene
Wilder tries to be Keaton, Chap
lin and Fellini; he should relax
and try being himself. Wilder has
enormous talent, but everything
he does here — his writing, act
ing and direction — is just an af
fectation, and it's a rather sad
(and unnecessary) exhibition.
With Dom DeLuise and Carol
Kane.
—Ron Lillejord
The Seduction of Mimi ★★★★
Thursday-Friday, New Varsity
Giancarlo Giannini plays Mimi,
a victim of bruised male ego who
reacts to his wife's commission of
adultery by vowing to have sex
with her lover's wife. This is one
of director Lina Wertmuller's
best efforts. Here she juggles
comedy and pathos with an ex
pert touch, with little of the stri
dency that sometimes mars her
other satires. A very funny, ulti
mately moving film.
—Jim Mattson

Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
$14 million to a different use. Or,
better yet, maybe they should
keep making these safe, inoffen
sive and generally well made en
tertainments and use the profits
to take some chances with un
usual projects and new filmmak
ers. Probably won't happen
though; the board of directors
would never allow it.
—R.L.

You Only Live Twice ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
The Chaparral ends its very
good film series with this Sean
Connery James Bond movie. A
perfect Dead Week movie: lots
of '60s sex and violence, double
agents, triple agents and special
effects. Oh yes. lames almost
gets married in this one.
— R.L.
Bread and Chocolate ★★★
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alto
This story of an Italian immig
rant who is battered by the sys
tem when he tries to make a go of
it in Switzerland's promised land
doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this movie
has a wit and warmth which make
it eminently watchable. Nino
Manfredi, as the immigrant, has
one of those faces which can
make nearly anything seem
either funny or tragic. Anna
Karina is fine as an immigrant
from Greece; Franco Brusati di
rected.
—J.M.

Autumn Sonata ★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.

Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San lose
One of the year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
— J.M.
Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—J.M.
Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the
ater feeling as if you've slept all
night with your mouth open.
