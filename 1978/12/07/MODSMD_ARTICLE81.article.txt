Foreign dependents flee Iran riots
Tehran, Iran — Hundreds of U.S. dependents left Iran
yesterday joining the growing exodus of foreign workers
fleeing the anti-government violence that has en
veloped the country. Oil production continued to tum
ble because of the crippling three-day strike by Iranian
workers.
Two of Iran's political opposotion leaders, Karim San
jaby and Dariush Forohar, both of the coalition National
Front, were released from detention last night.
This gave rise to speculation that the 71-year-old San
jaby, who was arrested Nov. 8, had been freed to help
form a coalition government to stem the violence.
Scores of American families stationed in Isfahan,
south of Tehran, flew to the United States yesterday.
Most of the women declined to be identified because
they feared for their husbands remaining in Iran.
Western diplomats reported that the Iranian army has
beefed up its guards protecting Americans and other
foreigners working in the strike-bound oilfields in the
southwest.
Brezhnev decries trade pressures
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev met with
two U.S. Cabinet members yesterday and criticized "at
tempts to use trade for political pressuring," the Soviet
news agency Tass reported.
Brezhnev received Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal and Commerce Secretary Juanita Kreps, who
are here for talks on trade and economic relations.
Tass said Blumenthal and Kreps gave Brezhnev a mes
sage about trade matters from President Jimmy Carter.
The specific contents were not disclosed.
In his session with the Cabinet ministers, Brezhnev
restated the Kremlin's opposition to restrictions on
U.S.-Soviet trade adopted by Congress in 1974.

The restrictions, the )ackson-Vanik and Stevenson
amendments, linked the non-discriminatory tariffs
status and trade credits to Moscow with the issue of free
emigration. The Soviets say this is interference in inter
nal affairs.
Japanese oil stockpiled in tankers
Tokyo — Twenty )apanese tankers carrying a total of
1.5 billion gallons of Arab oil are sitting motionless in the
Pacific near Iwo lima. They'rea floating stockpile to help
assure that the flow of oil, vital to japan's industry,
doesn't dry up.
"The tanker reserve, as we call it, uses idle tankers and
is part of the official program to increase Japan's
emergency oil reserve to 20 million tons (6 billion gal
lons) by year 1985," said Kazuo Takayama, chief planner
of the Japan National Oil Corp. Japan uses about 220
million gallons of oil a day.
There is not enough storage space on land to hold the
reserves the country thinks it needs. Japan has no oil of
its own.
Price controls cause gas shortage
Washington — Alfred kahn, the Carter administra
tion's chief inflation fighter, said yesterday that if price
regulation is causing a shortage of unleaded gasoline,
motorists face a choice of gas lines, rationing or higher
prices.
But, Kahn added that he already has decided for him
self that the reason for the spot shortages of unleaded
gasoline — which most late-model cars require — is
continuation of government controls over the price of
gasoline and other fuels.
Meanwhile, Kahn said he expects to have ready next
month a recommendation on whether the $2.65 hourly
minimum wage should be allowed to increase to $2.90 as
scheduled on Jan. 1 or whether it should be delayed or

scaled back. There is a widespread agreement among
economists that the increase could deal a sharp blow to
the fight against inflation.
Convention to avoid rift with Carter
Memphis, Tenn. — The Democratic Party will try to pay
tribute to President limmy Carter at its midterm conven
tion this weekend without quarreling over his foreign
and domestic policies.
The White House averted one potentially heated con
frontation with Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), the
leading congressional supporter of national health in
surance, by agreeing to reaffirm its support of the 1976
Democratic platform plank calling for enactment of
comprehensive health insurance. The agreement was
reached in telephone negotiations between White
House staffers and Kennedy.
First Venus pictures received
Mountain View — The first photograph of Venus taken
from an orbiting American spacecraft, released yester
day, shows the planet's surface entirely blocked from
view by a thick veil of bright haze.
Looking like a bright quarter moon, Venus basks in
ultraviolet radiation at sunrise, with no discernible fea
tures.
Scientists hope the mission will yield information
about Venus' simple weathersystem which could lead to
a better understanding of Earth's climate and environ
ment.
Football exempt from sex standards
Washington — The Carter administration said yester
day that major college football teams are unique and
don't have.to meet the same standards as other sports in

eliminating sex discrimination.
Intercollegiate football was specifically cited as an ex
ception as HEW Secretary Joseph Califano proposed
new federal guidelines to eliminate sex discrimination
from college athletics.
But under most other circumstances, the secretary
said, a college or university would have to begin im
mediately to spend substantially the same amount on
each woman participanting in athletics as it spends on
each man.
Califano said the guidelines would permit differences
in expenditures based on what he called "non
discriminatory factors, such as the cost of a particular
sport, for example, the equipment required, or the
scope of competition."
Market reaches five-week peak
New York — Stock prices struggled to a new
five-week high yesterday, despite increased resistance

1.39 to 821.90. Since mid-November the average has
risen 36.64 points.
Big Board volume came to 29.68 million shares, up
from 25.67 million Tuesday and the heaviest total since a
30.61 million-share day on Nov. 14.

Japanese oil stockpiled in tankers
Tokyo — Twenty )apanese tankers carrying a total of
1.5 billion gallons of Arab oil are sitting motionless in the
Pacific near Iwo lima. They'rea floating stockpile to help
assure that the flow of oil, vital to japan's industry,
doesn't dry up.
"The tanker reserve, as we call it, uses idle tankers and
is part of the official program to increase Japan's
emergency oil reserve to 20 million tons (6 billion gal
lons) by year 1985," said Kazuo Takayama, chief planner
of the Japan National Oil Corp. Japan uses about 220
million gallons of oil a day.
There is not enough storage space on land to hold the
reserves the country thinks it needs. Japan has no oil of
its own.
Price controls cause gas shortage
Washington — Alfred kahn, the Carter administra
tion's chief inflation fighter, said yesterday that if price
regulation is causing a shortage of unleaded gasoline,
motorists face a choice of gas lines, rationing or higher
prices.
But, Kahn added that he already has decided for him
self that the reason for the spot shortages of unleaded
gasoline — which most late-model cars require — is
continuation of government controls over the price of
gasoline and other fuels.
Meanwhile, Kahn said he expects to have ready next
month a recommendation on whether the $2.65 hourly
minimum wage should be allowed to increase to $2.90 as
scheduled on Jan. 1 or whether it should be delayed or

scaled back. There is a widespread agreement among
economists that the increase could deal a sharp blow to
the fight against inflation.
Convention to avoid rift with Carter
Memphis, Tenn. — The Democratic Party will try to pay
tribute to President limmy Carter at its midterm conven

leading congressional supporter of national health in
surance, by agreeing to reaffirm its support of the 1976
Democratic platform plank calling for enactment of
comprehensive health insurance. The agreement was
reached in telephone negotiations between White
House staffers and Kennedy.
First Venus pictures received
Mountain View — The first photograph of Venus taken

Scientists hope the mission will yield information
about Venus' simple weathersystem which could lead to
a better understanding of Earth's climate and environ

Football exempt from sex standards
Washington — The Carter administration said yester
day that major college football teams are unique and
don't have.to meet the same standards as other sports in

eliminating sex discrimination.
Intercollegiate football was specifically cited as an ex

new federal guidelines to eliminate sex discrimination
from college athletics.
But under most other circumstances, the secretary
said, a college or university would have to begin im
mediately to spend substantially the same amount on
each woman participanting in athletics as it spends on
each man.
Califano said the guidelines would permit differences
in expenditures based on what he called "non
discriminatory factors, such as the cost of a particular
sport, for example, the equipment required, or the
scope of competition."

Foreign dependents flee Iran riots
Tehran, Iran — Hundreds of U.S. dependents left Iran
yesterday joining the growing exodus of foreign workers
fleeing the anti-government violence that has en

form a coalition government to stem the violence.
Scores of American families stationed in Isfahan,
south of Tehran, flew to the United States yesterday.

its own.
Price controls cause gas shortage
Washington — Alfred kahn, the Carter administra
tion's chief inflation fighter, said yesterday that if price
regulation is causing a shortage of unleaded gasoline,
motorists face a choice of gas lines, rationing or higher
prices.
But, Kahn added that he already has decided for him
self that the reason for the spot shortages of unleaded
gasoline — which most late-model cars require — is
continuation of government controls over the price of
gasoline and other fuels.
Meanwhile, Kahn said he expects to have ready next
month a recommendation on whether the $2.65 hourly
minimum wage should be allowed to increase to $2.90 as
scheduled on Jan. 1 or whether it should be delayed or

scaled back. There is a widespread agreement among
economists that the increase could deal a sharp blow to
the fight against inflation.

tribute to President limmy Carter at its midterm conven
tion this weekend without quarreling over his foreign

First Venus pictures received
Mountain View — The first photograph of Venus taken
from an orbiting American spacecraft, released yester
day, shows the planet's surface entirely blocked from
view by a thick veil of bright haze.
Looking like a bright quarter moon, Venus basks in
ultraviolet radiation at sunrise, with no discernible fea
tures.
Scientists hope the mission will yield information
about Venus' simple weathersystem which could lead to
a better understanding of Earth's climate and environ
ment.
Football exempt from sex standards
Washington — The Carter administration said yester
day that major college football teams are unique and
don't have.to meet the same standards as other sports in

eliminating sex discrimination.
Intercollegiate football was specifically cited as an ex
ception as HEW Secretary Joseph Califano proposed
new federal guidelines to eliminate sex discrimination
from college athletics.
But under most other circumstances, the secretary
said, a college or university would have to begin im
mediately to spend substantially the same amount on
each woman participanting in athletics as it spends on
each man.
Califano said the guidelines would permit differences
in expenditures based on what he called "non
discriminatory factors, such as the cost of a particular
sport, for example, the equipment required, or the
scope of competition."

yesterday joining the growing exodus of foreign workers
fleeing the anti-government violence that has en
veloped the country. Oil production continued to tum
ble because of the crippling three-day strike by Iranian
workers.

jaby and Dariush Forohar, both of the coalition National
Front, were released from detention last night.

jaby, who was arrested Nov. 8, had been freed to help
form a coalition government to stem the violence.
Scores of American families stationed in Isfahan,
south of Tehran, flew to the United States yesterday.

two U.S. Cabinet members yesterday and criticized "at
tempts to use trade for political pressuring," the Soviet
news agency Tass reported.

amendments, linked the non-discriminatory tariffs
status and trade credits to Moscow with the issue of free
emigration. The Soviets say this is interference in inter
nal affairs.
