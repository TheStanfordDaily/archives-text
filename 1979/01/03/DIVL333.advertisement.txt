Interested in learning about
The Stanford Daily?
For many people the Daily is a mysterious place. A big brown
office building from whence the paper appears every morn
ing. But really, there is no mystery to the Daily's appearance
each morning. It is students like you getting together, hav
ing some fun putting out one of the nation's best college
journalism products. For the aspiring Bob Woodward, we
offer experience you can't find anywhere else on campus.
We have the information to help you get that rare job. For
the rest of the world, we offer leadership training, writing
and decision making instruction on a "real life" scale. No,
the Daily doesn't appear each morhing by magic. It gets on
the streets with work â€” from people like you. Why don't
you join us? Come in Friday at 2 p.m. or next Monday at 1
p.m., and we'll tell you what it's all about. The meetings are
in the Daily offices accross the Lomita Mall from Terman
Engineering Center.
