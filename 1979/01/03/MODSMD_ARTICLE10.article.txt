## Help naturalize Yosemite 
### 
Every summer thousands of
tourists descend into the
Yosemite Valley and create
what might be the worst air pol
lution in California east of In
terstate 5. In this current set
ting, can you imagine bicycles
and pedestrians outnumbering
cars? Can you picture Yosemite
Falls without a parking lot,
swimming pool, or the barber
shop obstructing the view? No,
this is not an exercise in imagi
nation. The United States Na
tional Park Service (NPS) may
soon make these and other
"fantasies" into realities.
In August 1978, the NPS re
leased a draft Yosemite man
agement plan that will direct
the park's development for the
next 15 years. The plan should
please anyone who ap
preciates the natural beauty of
Yosemite. If implemented, it
would reduce automobile
congestion and decrease the
number of commercial
facilities in the park.
Briefly, the plan significantly
reduces traffic in the Valley and
sets total elimination of traffic
as a long-term goal. It proposes
removal of 1200 parking
spaces, including those at the
foot of Yosemite Falls. Day vis
itors would leave their cars at
parking lots west of El Capitan,
while those staying overnight
may drive into the Valley — but
only as far as their accommoda
tions. All visitors will walk or
ride shuttle buses or bicycles

between points of interest in
the Valley.
The plan also removes all
unnecessary buildings and
services form the Valley. These
include the tennis courts,
swimming pools, golf course,
ice skating rink, most of the
park offices, and the nones
sential support structures of
the Yosemite Park and Curry
Company (YPPC), the park
concessionaire.
Other proposals include:
eliminating buildings and
campgrounds from areas
where they are unsafe or
ecologically unsound; leaving
the high country essentially as
it is except for Tuolumne
Meadows, where some build
ings will be removed and
facilities will be relocated;
transfering the concession
stands from Glacier Point to
Badger Pass which will remain
open all year for food, clo
thing, and sourvenir sales; and
increasing by 24,305 acres the
land classified as wilderness.
In 1974, public outcry forced
the NPS to reject the Yosemite
management plan because the
YPPC — owned by the Music
Corporation of America — was
pressuring the NPS to allow
more commercial develop
ment. The NPS then opened
planning to the public. Over
56,000 individuals and group
members attended work
shops, completed the planning
workbook, or offered opin

ions. All these contributions
and ideas for the future of
Yosemite shaped the draft
plan. The plan represents the
beginning of a "new era" at
Yosemite; an era no longer
marked by an "overzealous at
tempt to civilize the park."
This is only a draft, however,
and the plan faces review and
possible alterations. Under the
proposal, YPPC will not main
tain its current level of profits,
and consequently they are ex
pected to strongly fight ap
proval of the plan. Developers
can significantly weaken the
guidelines if they use their
large financial resources to
generate the public opposition
to the management plan.
Once more public participa
tion is necessary. The NPS
needs support from those
favoring the draft management
plan. Write to the Superinten
dent, P.O. Box 577-GMP,
Yosemite National Park, CA
95389 and tell him how you
feel Deadline for comments is
January 15, 1979. If you need
more information, write Sum
mary, Superintendent, Yose
mite National Park, CA 95389.
Your actions today may not re
store Yosemite to the condi
tion it was in when )ohn Muir
first saw it, but you may enable
future visitors to experience
the park in a more natural
state.

Every summer thousands of
tourists descend into the
Yosemite Valley and create
what might be the worst air pol
lution in California east of In
terstate 5. In this current set
ting, can you imagine bicycles
and pedestrians outnumbering
cars? Can you picture Yosemite
Falls without a parking lot,
swimming pool, or the barber
shop obstructing the view? No,
this is not an exercise in imagi
nation. The United States Na
tional Park Service (NPS) may
soon make these and other
"fantasies" into realities.
In August 1978, the NPS re
leased a draft Yosemite man
agement plan that will direct
the park's development for the
next 15 years. The plan should
please anyone who ap
preciates the natural beauty of
Yosemite. If implemented, it
would reduce automobile
congestion and decrease the
number of commercial
facilities in the park.
Briefly, the plan significantly
reduces traffic in the Valley and
sets total elimination of traffic
as a long-term goal. It proposes
removal of 1200 parking
spaces, including those at the
foot of Yosemite Falls. Day vis
itors would leave their cars at
parking lots west of El Capitan,
while those staying overnight
may drive into the Valley — but
only as far as their accommoda
tions. All visitors will walk or
ride shuttle buses or bicycles

between points of interest in
the Valley.
The plan also removes all
unnecessary buildings and
services form the Valley. These
include the tennis courts,
swimming pools, golf course,
ice skating rink, most of the
park offices, and the nones
sential support structures of
the Yosemite Park and Curry
Company (YPPC), the park
concessionaire.
Other proposals include:
eliminating buildings and
campgrounds from areas
where they are unsafe or
ecologically unsound; leaving
the high country essentially as
it is except for Tuolumne
Meadows, where some build
ings will be removed and
facilities will be relocated;
transfering the concession
stands from Glacier Point to
Badger Pass which will remain
open all year for food, clo
thing, and sourvenir sales; and
increasing by 24,305 acres the
land classified as wilderness.
In 1974, public outcry forced
the NPS to reject the Yosemite
management plan because the
YPPC — owned by the Music
Corporation of America — was
pressuring the NPS to allow
more commercial develop
ment. The NPS then opened
planning to the public. Over
56,000 individuals and group
members attended work
shops, completed the planning
workbook, or offered opin

ions. All these contributions
and ideas for the future of
Yosemite shaped the draft
plan. The plan represents the
beginning of a "new era" at
Yosemite; an era no longer
marked by an "overzealous at
tempt to civilize the park."
This is only a draft, however,
and the plan faces review and
possible alterations. Under the
proposal, YPPC will not main
tain its current level of profits,
and consequently they are ex
pected to strongly fight ap
proval of the plan. Developers
can significantly weaken the
guidelines if they use their
large financial resources to
generate the public opposition
to the management plan.
Once more public participa
tion is necessary. The NPS
needs support from those
favoring the draft management
plan. Write to the Superinten

Your actions today may not re
store Yosemite to the condi
tion it was in when )ohn Muir
first saw it, but you may enable
future visitors to experience
the park in a more natural
state.
