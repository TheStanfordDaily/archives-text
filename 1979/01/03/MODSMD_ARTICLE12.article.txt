## Arguments for keeping the shah 
### 
The Shah of Iran may or may
not have weathered the recent
wave of unrest inside his coun
try. This gives us a moment to
contemplate the future of this
ancient empire if there is any.
I am no personal admirer of
the shah. In fact, as a defector
myself, I am still outraged at his
returning Valentin Zasimov, a
Soviet pilot who had defected
to Iran, back to the USSRand to
the silence of death. This ac
tion alone suggests to me that
the shah's respect for human
rights of his own subjects may
be no greater.
In spite of that, I can see no
viable — nor more humane —
alternative to the present re
gime. A sudden removal of the
shah from the political scene
under present circumstances
would not mean a triumph for
democracy and human rights
but will plunge the country
into a longer period of calamity

and bloodshed which could be
ended only by foreign inter
vention. For one thing, since
the opposition leaders are not
willing to settle for anything
less than the monarch's scalp,
the pro-shah forces would
hardly accept his forcible over
throw without an armed resis
tance. But if a full-scale civil
war would fail to break out
then, it will start later, among
theanti-shah allies themselves.
Except for their hatred of the
shah and, possibly, their mis
guided resentment of U.S.
"imperialism," what can be in
common between the conser
vative Shi-ite Muslims and the
"progressive" petrodollar ex
patriate students, the liberal
minded Westernists and theAl
Fatah inspired terrorists? Not
much. And the bond of hatred
is the shakiest of foundations
to build a new country on.
The anti-shah forces are

simply too heterogeneous, to
antagonistic to each other to
hold any promise of a durable
political coalition. Some of
them want to replace the em
pire with an Islamic Republic.
Others see in Islam a major ob
stacle for the desired
Western-style democratization
of Iran. Still others would have
nothing to do with either Islam
or the West. No sooner the
shah is gone than they will beat
each other's throats, and then
there will ensue a civil war the
cost of which in blood and suf
fering of the Iranian people, to
say nothing of petrodollars,
would far outweigh anything
the present admittedly repres
sive regime could be charged
with.
But could not the cost be jus
tified as a necessary sac
rifice for the bright future of a
free, prosperous and inde
pendent Iran? Not at all. For

there is nothing bright in sight.
After all, the most likely victors
will be neither the democratic
Westernists nor the theocratic
Muslims but the Moscow-line
Tudeh Communists.
Have you not heard of them?
Neither had we hard of the
Khalq Communists, that is until
they took over neighboring Af
ghanistan. The Tudeh Com
munists may be small in num
bers but in fanaticism they can
match any Shi'ite mullah. They
now prostrate themselves as
lowa-.the Muslim believers but
the) do so to a different Allah.
Unlike their more popular al
lies, they can point to history as
being on their side. To wit,
where is Kerensky's democra
tic coalition that rejoiced at the
fall of the czar in Russia? Where
are the Kuomintang nationalist
that aspired to fill the em
peror's shoes in China? Where
is the majority of colonels who
dethroned the Lion of Judah in
Ethiopia? Or — closer to home
— doesn't the blood of the de
vout Muslim Daoud, who over
threw the King of Afghanistan,
fly in the face of the Muslim
opponents of the Shah?
The fact that the Iranian
Communists play to the tune of
Moscow rather than Pek'ng
makes their chances only all
too realistic. In spite of the of
ficial State Department denials
of the Soviet complicity in Iran,
one has to assume that while
Soviet leaders risk nothing by
keeping the turmoil in Iran
boiling, they can hope to win
perhaps the greatest strategic
victory since 1917. Notonlycan
they easily exploit the advan
tage of having the longest bor
der with Iran (now expanded
even further by the Afghan
border), but the ethnic com
position of Iran is such that its
territory can be viewed as a
natural extension of the Soviet
"republics" of Armenia, Azer
baijan, and Turkmenistan.
Moreover, the language of iran
is very close to that spoken in
Afghanistan and Soviet Tad :
zhikistan. Last but not least,
unlike in 1946 when the West
was in a position to demand
the end of Soviet occupation of
the Iranian territory, now the
Soviets can practically count
on a carte blanche. Only the
Chinese Qommunists could
explain to their Iranian com
rades how strong the "loving"
hug of the polar bear can be.
And the Rumanians could in
struct them, before it is too
late, that one does not dictate
oil prices to the shahs in Mos
cow the way the Shah of Iran
dictates them to the U.S. "im
perialists."
So, if I were an Iranian, I
would still opt forthe shah, not
so much for his own sake, but
because his rule, oppressive as
it is,.offers in the long run the
best chance for Iran to assert
itself as a proud, prosperous
and independent nation.
By gradually evolving toward
a constitutional monarchy in
style with Great Britain and Ja
pan, the present regime may
yet prove the least painful way
to democracy and human
rights for the Iranians and
many others. Otherwise, I am
afraid that as surely as the flow
of Iranian oil abroad would
slacken, the flow of the "boat
people" from the Persian gulf
would replace the übiquitous
Iranian students.
