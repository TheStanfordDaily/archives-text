'lnsane' sensitivity
I noted a letter from Alice
Supton, assistant dean of resi
dential education, announcing
a course on homosexuality
"for men and women, both
homosexual and heterosex
ual" {Daily, Dec. 7). She gives
as a reason for providing the
course that "students have
sometimes demonstrated an
insensitivity to their fellow stu
dents who are gay."
It would appear that the
course is designed to "brain
wash" students into accepting
and approving of homosexual
ity so that they will show more
politeness and "sensitivity"
toward the gays.
This is insanity! Every sane
human being regards
homosexuality with instinctive
abhorrence. Any other attitude
is insane; and anyone who
tries to encourage any other at
titude is insane.
The campaign to make
homosexuality respectable
and thus to encourage its
spread appears to be part of
the general campaign to re
duce the birth rate of those
with sufficient intelligence to
get into institutions of higher
learning where they can be
reached with this propaganda,
without the opposition from
parents they would encounter
in grade schools and high
schools. Every civilization has
perished when those with the
intelligence and character

needed to maintain this civili
zation did not reproduce
themselves.
Why is it that no one at Stan
ford speaks out against this en
couragement of homosexual
ity? Why are even the religious
groups silent? The penalty pro
vided in the Bible for
homosexuality is death. And
the flood and the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah are
supposed to have been
punishments for the practice
of homosexuality.
Are there any individuals or
groups at Stanford who regard
homosexuality with abhorr
ence and who resent the at
tempt to "brainwash" them
into accepting homosexuality
and treating gays with "sen
sitivity?" If there are, they
should make themselves
heard.

"Equality of rights under the
law shall not be denied or ab
ridged by the United states or
by any State on account of
sex."
It seems like such an obvious
declaration of American prin
ciples; however, the simple
issue of constitutional equality
for the sexes has been mis
construed and disastrously
sidetracked. It is also unfortu
nate that those opposed to ERA
passage, mostly white conser

vative women, are far more
verbal, fearful and politically
activated than those of us
drawn from every sector of soc
iety, both men and women,
who support the ERA and
naively believe that the virtues
of equality simply cannot be
denied.
Despite the recent victory
securing extension for the
amendment, and the fact that
only three more states are
needed for the amendment to
become a law, we must not be
lulled into dangerous compla
cency.
Whether you have been
politically active before, or are
like most of the current mem
bers of Stanford for ERA, who
had never written letters to
their congressional or state
representatives or other politi
cal leaders, it is time to become
motivated by the urgency of
the situation.
If you are from one of the 15
unratified states, write to your
elected officials. Inform them
of your support for the ERA and
encourage them to use their
vote and influence to work af
firmatively for the amendment.
If you are from one of the 35
enlightened states, do not
withdraw and allow events to
take their course. Support the
economic boycott of unratified
states and write letters of con
viction to officials from your
state as well as to those from
the unratified states. As San
Jose attorney and woman ac
tivist said, "Letter writing is a
critical link, every single bit of
the effort enhances everything
else," in the effort to ratify the
ERA.
The season forgiving is upon
us. Give something of youself,
for yourself and for others. Ac
tively support the ERA!

'lnsane' sensitivity
I noted a letter from Alice
Supton, assistant dean of resi
dential education, announcing
a course on homosexuality
"for men and women, both
homosexual and heterosex
ual" {Daily, Dec. 7). She gives
as a reason for providing the
course that "students have
sometimes demonstrated an
insensitivity to their fellow stu
dents who are gay."
It would appear that the
course is designed to "brain
wash" students into accepting
and approving of homosexual
ity so that they will show more
politeness and "sensitivity"
toward the gays.
This is insanity! Every sane
human being regards
homosexuality with instinctive
abhorrence. Any other attitude
is insane; and anyone who
tries to encourage any other at
titude is insane.
The campaign to make
homosexuality respectable
and thus to encourage its
spread appears to be part of
the general campaign to re
duce the birth rate of those
with sufficient intelligence to
get into institutions of higher
learning where they can be
reached with this propaganda,
without the opposition from
parents they would encounter
in grade schools and high
schools. Every civilization has
perished when those with the
intelligence and character

needed to maintain this civili
zation did not reproduce
themselves.
Why is it that no one at Stan
ford speaks out against this en
couragement of homosexual
ity? Why are even the religious
groups silent? The penalty pro
vided in the Bible for
homosexuality is death. And
the flood and the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah are
supposed to have been
punishments for the practice
of homosexuality.
Are there any individuals or
groups at Stanford who regard
homosexuality with abhorr
ence and who resent the at
tempt to "brainwash" them
into accepting homosexuality
and treating gays with "sen
sitivity?" If there are, they
should make themselves
heard.

Support ERA
"Equality of rights under the
law shall not be denied or ab
ridged by the United states or
by any State on account of
sex."
It seems like such an obvious
declaration of American prin
ciples; however, the simple
issue of constitutional equality
for the sexes has been mis
construed and disastrously
sidetracked. It is also unfortu
nate that those opposed to ERA
passage, mostly white conser

vative women, are far more
verbal, fearful and politically
activated than those of us
drawn from every sector of soc
iety, both men and women,
who support the ERA and
naively believe that the virtues
of equality simply cannot be
denied.
Despite the recent victory
securing extension for the
amendment, and the fact that
only three more states are
needed for the amendment to
become a law, we must not be
lulled into dangerous compla
cency.
Whether you have been
politically active before, or are
like most of the current mem
bers of Stanford for ERA, who
had never written letters to
their congressional or state
representatives or other politi
cal leaders, it is time to become
motivated by the urgency of
the situation.
If you are from one of the 15
unratified states, write to your
elected officials. Inform them
of your support for the ERA and
encourage them to use their
vote and influence to work af
firmatively for the amendment.
If you are from one of the 35
enlightened states, do not
withdraw and allow events to
take their course. Support the
economic boycott of unratified
states and write letters of con
viction to officials from your
state as well as to those from
the unratified states. As San
Jose attorney and woman ac
tivist said, "Letter writing is a
critical link, every single bit of
the effort enhances everything
