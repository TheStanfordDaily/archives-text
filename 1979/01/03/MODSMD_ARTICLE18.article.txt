The Card's found their performance impaired during the first half as Stanford QB Steve Dils,
the offensive player of the game, was under constant pressure from a strong Georgia defensive
rush.
Gordy Ceresino led the Stanford defenders with 20 tackles and was named the most valuable
defensive player of the game.
The running game helped the Card's regain control. Darrin Nelson, escorted by Paul Hibler,
sprints for a good portion of his 100 yards on the day.
The outlook was dismal for the Cards late in the second quarter. Coach Bill Walsh prays for a
miracle.
Georgia's turnovers were the key to Stanford's victory. The Cards recovered five fumbles and
intercepted one Bulldog pass.
