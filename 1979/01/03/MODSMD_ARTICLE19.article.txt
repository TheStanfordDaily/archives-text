# Perry gets 34 for Cards
## Stanford surprises Bruins in 75-72 hoop thriller 
### CHRIS HAFT 
The Stanford partisans among the
7946 in attendance at Maples Pavilion
December 27 received their most ex
citing and satisfying, albeit belated,
Christmas present from the Cardinal
basketballers as Stanford gave a furi
ous and glorious effort to defeat the
vaunted UCLA Bruins, 75-72.
Every Card player and even the
coaching staff participated in wrap
ping the triumphant gift box, with
Wolfe Perry's career-high 34 points
providing most of the decoration.
Jeff Ryan tied the final ribbon,
banking in a little lay-up with two
seconds left to give Stanford a 73-72
lead.
Sinking winner
Ryan, who was fouled by David
Greenwood while sinking the win
ner, missed his free throw on pur
pose to keep the ball in play and dis
courage UCLA from taking another
shot. No Bruin ever touched the re
bound, as the Cards' Orlando Ward
followed it in for the present's final
flourish.
Yet the Bruins, college basketball's
most majestic team for a decade and
a half, nearly prevented the gift from
being delivered.
Holding a slender 72-70 lead with
3:26 to go, UCLA went into a
spread-court delay offense in an at
tempt to draw a foul while running
out the clock — sound strategy, since
one more Stanford foul would put
the Bruins into the bonus situation,
enabling them to shoot free throws
on any Card foul committed.
The inevitable occurred with 1:37
remaining as Kimberly Belton
pushed Greenwood.
Belton, with five fouls, was out of
the game. All Greewood had to do
was make his free throws,and Stan
ford would be out of it too.
Missed loss
But the Bruins' All-American mis
sed the first of a one-and-one. Perry
grabbed the rebound for the Cards.
Paul Giovacchini missed a 17-footer,
but Ward, Belton's replacement,
outfought two Bruins for the carom
and was fouled while shooting by
James Wilkes with 1:11 left.
UCLA then called the customary
time out to try and unnerve Ward. "I
was nervous, but I've got confi
dence," Ward said later. "We prac
tice free throws every day, and I just
tried to go with the mechanics."
Mechanically and coolly, Ward hit
his first charity toss for 72-71. Again
UCLA called time out. Pressure hung
like a cloud over Maples' shiny floor
as Ward's second shot went in and
out, and finally headed for the left
corner.
Greenwood and Stanford's Brian

Welch dove for the loose ball, which
finally went out of bounds off
Greenwood with 1:09 left, thus pav
ing the way for the Cards' last-minute
heroics.
Stanford then ran down the clock
until 16seconds remained beforecal
ling the game's last time out to set up
a play for one shot.
Clincher
After inbounding, the pure
shooting Welch got the ball back.
Unable to pass or work for a shot, he
suddenly drove baseline and fed
Ryan waiting underneath the basket
for the clincher.
The last shot, Welch explained,
was supposed to be taken by "either
Wolfe over the top or me coming
around on a pick. I looked up and
saw there were seven seconds left. I
knew we couldn't run the play fully. I
saw the lanes cleared, so I drove and
saw Jeff there."

"I was just trying to get position
underneath," Ryan said. "I went
numb after the shot."
Card coach Dick Dißiaso was any
thing but numb, euphorically await
ing the arrival of a throng of reporters
and television cameramen by
exclaiming, "The press is in the win
ning locker room! Shit!"
Of the triumph, Dißiaso said, "It
feels super. My mother and father
taught me to be humble in victory. I
just want them to understand when
they wake up tomorrow and see me
in the newspaper, I hope they aren't
disappointed if I look happy and
gloat a little bit."
Coach's praise
Dißiaso went on to praise his assis
tant coaches, Ken Maxey and Tim
Miller ("They did a great job scouting
and preparing us for UCLA") and his
players ("It was a team victory").
Dißiaso scoffed at the suggestion

that this might be considered an up
set. "Upsets are something the fans
and the bookies think about," he
said. "Coaches and ballplayers don't
think about upsets. Every game
we've played since we've been here,
we went in thinking we could win."
The outcome squared Stanford's
Pac-10 record at 1-1. It was UCLA's
conterence opener, and its first loss
in 18 league games since falling 65-55
to Oregon in the 1977 season.
It was also UCLA's first road game
of the campaign after running up a
6-1 mark at Pauley Pavilion. "I don't
like to think being on the road was a
factor," Bruin coach Gary Cunnin
gham said.
With senior guard Brad Holland
scoring on long-distance missiles,
the Bruins appeared worthv of the
No. 3 national raking while soaring to
an early 18-7 advantage.
Then Perry brought Stanford back,

stuffing the Cards' stockings by ris
ing over fellow shootist Holland for
sweet-looking jumpers.
Late in the first half Stanford trailed
32-24, but Perry's three hoops let a
10-2 Card streak that tied it 34-34 by
intermission.
The dual duel continued in the
second half. Perry and Holland con
tinually traded baskets, and Stanford
and UCLA battled through six ties
and three lead changes.
Each team gained and lost
moderately-sized leads. Within two
minutes after the second half began,
UCLA held a 40-34 margin on baskets
by Greenwood, Gig Sims and Hol
land.
Stanford retaliated with a 13-2
spree, paced by Perry's seven points,
that gave the Cards a 47-42 lead
which was soon erased by four Hol
land howitzers.
In the end, however, Perry's per

formance transcended all others'.
Besides shooting a spectacular 15-
for-20 from the floor, the 6-foot-2
senior guard ripped a team-high
eight rebounds.
"I dreamed of this game about
seven times this past week," Perry
said. "UCLA is probably one of the
best defensive teams in the country,
and they played us heads up and got
into us early. But I felt good the
whole night."
"I give Stanford all the credit," said
Cunningham. "I think two of their
players had exceptional nights, those
being Perry and Belton (14 points).
I ve been watching Perry play for four
years now, and I'd have to say that
this was his best game ever. He gave
just a magnificent effort."
Poor first-half shooting (12 for 35)
hampered the Bruins significantly,
though their marksmanship im
proved in the second half (18-for-32).
Holland, who scored 25 points on
12-for-18 shooting, had the only
strong outing for UCLA.
Meanwhile, the Cards meshed 55
percent of their floor attempts, in
cluding 66.7 percent ( 18-for-27) in the
second half when it counted most.
Staunch defense
Stanford's able defense held
Greenwood to 11 ponts, almost nine
below his average, while All-
Conference guard Roy Hamilton col
lected just 13 points, over seven
below his norm.
"We played great defense, espe
cially on Greenwood," Belton stated.
"Coach (Dißiaso) wanted us to deny
him the ball, and out changing de
fenses a lot did that. We just wanted
to play him honest, play good ball."
It was good ball, all right.
