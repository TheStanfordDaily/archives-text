Tehran, Iran (AP) — Aides of Iranian
Prime Minister-designate Shahpour
Bakhtiar said yesterday he had com
pleted selections for a new civilian
Cabinet to replace the military re
gime installed two months ago to
deal with riots against Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The shah is
expected to remain on his throne but
Bakhtiar's Cabinet would take over
much of the 59-year-old monarch's
power.
Meanwhile, in Beverly Hills, hun
dreds of angry demonstrators
stormed the palatial home of the
Shah of Iran's sister yesterday over
turning a police car, setting several
brush fires and smashing windows in
the mansion.
Both the sister, Princess Chams,
owner of the house, and her visiting
90-year-old mother, Tadj Ul Moluk,
remained in the royal residence dur
ing the bloody confrontation, but
neither was injured, according to a
spokesman for the Iranian Consulate
in San Francisco, who asked not to be
identified.
In Iran, Bakhtiar's aides said the
62-year-old lawyer would present his
Cabinet list to parliament tomorrow.
The list will be presented to the shah
for his approval if both houses of par
liament back Bakhtiar's Cabinet
nominees.
Bakhtiar was kicked out of the op
position National Front when he ag
reed to try to end the year-long civil
crisis without requiring the shah to
abdicate. Religious and political

leaders rejected the plan and said the
bloodshed will end only when the
shah gives up the Peacock Throne.
Hundreds of Americans and other
foreigners flew out of the country
yesterday after Iranian soldiers re
placed striking control tower work
ers and reopened Tehran's interna
tional airport following a one-day
shutdown.
In Beverly Hills, the rock- and
bottle-throwing protesters shattered
windows on the upper floor of the
princess' home, overturned a police
car and set brush fires that briefly
threatened the house and other ex
pensive homes before tear gas and
high pressure fire hoses sent the Ira
nians fleeing.
Officers formed a protective ring
around the residence, blocking the
chanting demonstrators from actu
ally entering the home.
An unknown number of the esti
mated 2000 demonstrators were in
jured when they were reportedly hit
by sheriff's cars during the4s-minute
melee that for a time completely im
mobilized this exclusive Los Angeles
suburb. The affluent community re
sembled an armed camp and traffic
was backed up for miles.
Thirteen demonstrators were
taken to Cedars Sinai Hospital with
assorted injuries, but none was re
ported to be serious, said hospital
spokesman Larry Baum.
The demonstrators said they were
supporting the current rebellion in
Iran that seeks to overthrow the

shah's military regime.
"It was planned as a peaceful de
monstration," said Mina Azad,
spokeswoman for the protesting Ira
nians, many of them students.
She said there will be additional
demonstrations in Beverly Hills.
The bloody protest began with an
hour-long peaceful march by the
mostly young male and femolp pro
testers who scrupulously obeyed in
structions from the Beverly Hills
police not to block traffic and to walk

only on sidewalks.
The only indication of the hostility
to be violently released later was the
throng's loud chanting of "Bye, Bye
Shah" and "Death To The Shah."
The students set fire to their
placards and tossed them onto the
hillside below the house. The flames
spread quickly in the thick, dry brush
• \H ticked dangerously close to the
estate and other residences in the
wealthy neighborhood before they
were brought under control.
