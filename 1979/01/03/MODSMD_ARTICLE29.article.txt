# Gas shortages slow as consumers adapt

Washington (AP) — The
natural gas shortage that
plagued the nation over the
past four years has finally
begun to wind down — not
because of any spurt in pro
duction, but because
householders and indus
tries have learned to get
along with less gas, or even
without it.
But the improvement is
uneven. As a result, gas in
dustry spokesmen say,
some pipelines and utilities
can start selling natural gas
to new customers, but
others still cannot fill the
needs of their users.
Further improvement is
expected for the next three
to five years, says George
Lawrence, president of the
American Gas Association.
This is because additional
gas supplies previously
withheld from sale should
become available with
elimiriation of the country's
two-market system and its
price differences, Lawrence
says.
This improvement has
been called a "gas glut" or
"bubble," ill-chosen
phrases that made experi
enced observers here won
der how the low gas supply
of recent years suddenly
turned into abundance.
The answer is, simply,
that it didn't.
After peaking at 22.6 trill
ion cubic feet in 1973, U.S.
natural gas production slid
back, year by year, to only

19.5 trillion in 1976. In 1977
production almost leveled
off at about 19.4 trillion
cubic feet.
The downslide left many
pipelines and utilities far
short of the gas they owed
customers. As utilities tem
porarily shut off deliveries,
industrial users given a low
priority by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commis
sion were usually the first to
suffer.
Many of them switched to
other fuels, mainly oil, and
are not anxious to trust their
fate to natural gas again.
An Energy Department
survey last April said that
natural gas, which provided
37.6 percent of the energy
used by reporting industries
in 1972, accounted for only
30.1 percent in the first half
of 1977.
At the same time, the per
centage of their energy
from fuel oil went up from
9.8 to 13.9, and that from
electricity rose from 15.1 to
17.1. Their direct use of coal
held steady, just over 20
percent.
The department called
this "a substantial switch by
participating firms away
from the dominant fuel
source of natural gas."
The result has been that
nationwide use of natural
gas has backed down, out of
necessity, to accommodate
itself to the new, low
supplies and the new, high
prices.
