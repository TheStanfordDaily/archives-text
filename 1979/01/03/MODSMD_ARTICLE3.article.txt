# Trustees refuse approval of 27.6 percent increase in Medical School tuition
## 
### MIKE CHARLSON Senior staff writer 
In a surprise move, the Board of
trustees refused to accept an ad
ministration proposal to increase tui
tion for new medical students by 27.6
percent.
At its December meeting, the
board instead directed the administ
ration to spread the increase —
deemed necessary to meet increased
costs — over a three-year period.
At the same meeting, the board
approved tuition, room and board
increases for all other students, ef
fective next fall. The increases
amount to an 8.9 percent jump in
costs.
I he rejected proposal would have
raised tuition for new medical stu
dents 27.6 percent, to $6873 a year
while lessening the shock for
already-enrolled students, imposing
a 14.6 percent hike.
Extraordinary jump
The extraordinary jump was
necessary to bring the rise in tuition
in line with recent rises in costs at the
Medical School, according to David
Hopkins, assistant dean foradminist
ration.

In 1972-73, the cost of educating a
medical student for one year was
$16,450, according to Hopkins, with
tuition revenues comprising 21.6
percent of that figure.
However, it now costs $35,000 to
educate a student, but tuition hikes
have not kept pace with cost in
creases, he said. Tuition, presently at
$5388, provides only 17.9 percent of
costs.
Hopkins said other income
sources are not making up the differ
ence, so it was decided to restore the
21 percent-of-cost policy. To bring
tuition back into line with the goal, a
substantial increase wou-ld be re
quired for one year.
But the board felt the figure was
too high.
Bad looks
"They just didn't like the looks of it
(the proposal)," Hopkins said.
Trustee Sallyanne Payton said trus
teees felt such a large hike was "in
consistent with the spirit" of wage
and price guidelines set by President
Jimmy Carter.
The guidelines required that the
weighted average of all prices the
University charges for services be no
greater than 9.1 percent above this
year's assessments.
Even with the higher Medical
School tuition jump, administration
figures show that overall the Univer
sity would be in compliance with the
guidelines.
No doubt
Payton said the trustees were not
in doubt as to the legality of the
proposal, but they felt such a large
increase was not a good idea.
Trustee William Eberle agreed that
the size of the increase was the main
factor behind the board's decision,
but he said the board did not like the
disparity between rates paid by new
and continuing students.
The board set a formula for the
administration to use in determining
a new rate, Eberle said, which will

restrict the size of the increase to a
range which the board has approved.
The formula will allow the ad
ministration to develop a new prop
osal which will then be submitted to
Board President Peter Bing,
Academic Affairs Committee Chair
man Barbara Finberg and Finance
and Development Committee Co-
Chairmen Roger Lewis and William
Timken for final approval, according
to Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president for trustee affairs.
No meetings
The four board members will act
because the full board does not meet
in lanuary. Acting Provost Gerald
Lieberman said the administration
wants to set the rate as soon as possi
ble so that both new and continuing
students will know what to expect.
FHe said he thought final approval
would come within the next two
weeks.
Administration sources said yes
terday that the new proposal is nearly
complete.
An overall hike of about 15 percent
will likely be proposed, according to
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for
budget and planning.
A 15 percent jump would put tui
tion at about the $6200 level.
A break
But Hopkins said there is still the
feeling that continuing students
should be given a break in the tuition
increase. He said the administration
is considering forming an internal
fund to refund a portion of the in
crease to continuing students.
That part of the proposal is stll ten
tative, he said
Tuition rates approved for the re
mainder of the University included a
9.1 percent increase in general tui
tion from $51 iO to $5695 and an 8.8
percent increase in Law School tui
tion from $5280 to $5744.
Room and board rates were-raised
8.5 percent from $2169 to $2354.
