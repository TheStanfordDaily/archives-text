Egypt agrees to resume talks
Egypt indicated its readiness to resume dead
locked peace negotiations with Israel yesterday
while Jewish extremists tried to establish a new
settlement in the Irsaeli-occupied West Bank of
the Jordan River.
The Israeli army said it will remove about 50
families that squatted on a hill near an existing
settlement, six miles northwest of Jerusalem.
Both the United States and Egypt regard the
Israeli settlements as illegal and an obstruction to
peace.
Egypt's willingness to resume peace talks with
Israel was expressed in Cairo by an Egyptian
Foreign Ministry official, who barred use of his
name.
He said the decision of the Israeli Cabinet last
Sunday was an "encouraging and a positive step.''
The Cabinet confirmed Israel's willingness to re
sume negotiations on at least two of the three
major issues standing in the way of a peace treaty.
He added Egypt was preparing an assessment of
the situation for relay to Washington as an inter
mediate step to having the talks resumed.
Cambodia charges invasion
Bangkok, Thailand — Cambodia charged yester
day that Vietnamese forces penetrated deep into
its eastern territory and political analysts here con
firmed Hanoi-backed rebels grabbed control of a
key Mekong River town.
The three-year border conflict between the two
Southeast Asian nations is seen by some as an
extension of the Soviet-Chinese rift. Communist
Vietnam is allied with Moscow, while Peking backs
the Cambodian government.
Khieu Samphan said the major Vietnamese at
tacks have come in Ratanakiri and Kratie provinces
and along Highway 7 which leads to another key
Mekong River town, kompong Cham. He ap
pealed to countries "far and near," as well as the
United Nations to help stop the invasion.
Reliable sources in Bangkok confirmed that the
major Mekong River town of Kratie had been
seized but could provide no details of the current
situation in that area, 100 miles northeast of
Phnom Penh.
Pro-Hanoi Cambodian insurgents claimed
Kratie fell into their hands Dec. 30, but Western
and Thai analysts here are convinced regular Viet
namese troops were largely responsible.
Peking invites Goldwater
Peking — Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping yester
day invited Sen. Barry Goldwater, the most bitter

opponent of the United States' split with Taiwan,
to visit Peking and discuss China's plans to reunify
the capitalist island with the communist mainland.
Teng also reportedly told minor Communist
Party members and former Nationalist Chinese
Party members that reunification of Taiwan and
China's modernization drive ranked first on the
national agenda.
In Washington, Coldwater press aide Tony
Smith said the conservative Arizona Republican
would not comment until he received an official
invitation. Coldwater has filed suit to block Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's termination of the U.S.-
Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty effective at the end
of 1979.
Rep. Thomas Ashley (D-Ohio), leader of an
eight-man delegation from the House Banking
Committee that met with Teng for two hours yes
terday, said he would relay the invitation to Cold
water.
During the meeting, Teng sought to calm fears
about the future of Taiwan and about possible
Chinese Communist expansionism.
Rhodesian constitution published
Salisbury, Rhodesia — A draft constitution ex
pected to guide Rhodesia after blacks get the vote
was published yesterday as guerillas, in separate
raids, attacked a black opponent of the govern
ment and a white suburban home.
The draft provides for minority whites to retain
leadership in the courts, military and civil service
for five years and for the country to be renamed
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia — combining white and
black names.
The constitution of white Prime Minister lan
Smith's bi-racial government is to be presented to
Rhodesia's 80,000 white voters in a referendum
)an. 30. Conservative and liberal white groups at
tacked the proposals, but approval is expected.
Early yesterday, guerillas blasted with rocket,
small arms fire and grenades a white-owned home
in Borrowdale, 10 miles north of Salisbury. The
seven white residents escaped injury.
Northeast thaws as Dixie chilled
An arctic storm yesterday pushed the mercury to
record lows in some parts of the country and
spread snow as far south as Florida while Easter
ners waited their turn in wet and balmy weather.
The cold front that walloped the West over the
holiday weekend spread eastward and into Dixie,
and New Englanders were warned that it was head
ing their way.
If the year 1978 brought mudslides, ear

thquakes, crop freezes and wind-whipped fires to
Southern California, the advent of the new year
bode more of the same for 1979.
Aftershut-ks of an earthquake that rattled five
California counties Monday continued to rumble
yesterday while winds of 90 mph and flooding
closed a major interstate highway and several
bridges, stranding hundreds of motorists trying to
get home from the holidays.
The California Highway Patrol said six cars and
three trailers were flipped over by high winds on
Interstate 8 before it was closed.
Senators deplore budget cuts
Sacramento — Four Senate leaders gave Gov.
Jerry Brown a New Year's message yesterday, say
ing he could face a budget battle with lawmakers if
he tries to cut too deeply into state spending this
year.
The four, all Democrats, said Brown's proposal
to hold spending increases under the rate of infla
tion would do too much damage to state programs
and might lead to serious attempts to override
some cutbacks.
But the Senate's Republican leader praised the
Democratic governor's proposal, calling it"the
goal we should attempt to achieve."
The complaints deal with signals from Brown
that he is abandoning an agreement made with
Senate President Pro Tem James Mills and Assem
bly Speaker Leo McCarthy last summer after the
passage of Proposition 13 to limit spending in
creases in 1979-80 to growth in personal income,
which has been running about 10 percent.
Dow Jones rises in slow trading
New York — A flurry of buying just before the
close carried the stock market to a broad gain
yesterday in the first trading session of 1979.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up only
fractionally a half hour before the close, closed
with a 6.41 gain at 811.42.
Less impressive, however, was the pace of activ
ity. New York Stock Exchange volume came to just
18.34 million shares, down from 30.03 million last
Friday and the lightest total since a 14.59 million
share day on Nov. 24.
Today's weather
Chance of rain today. Occasional rain likely to
night and tomorrow. Warming trend. Lows in the
upper 30s to mid 40s and tonight in the mid 40s to
low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the 50s to
low 60s. Chance of rain 40 percent today and 60
percent tonight.
