## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost
and dean of research here, assumed
the post of acting provost Jan. 1, re
placing William Miller.
Miller, whose September resigna
tion became effective at the start of
this year, will become the first reci
pient of the Herbert Hoover profes
sorship at the Graduate School of
Business.
Lieberman has been vice provost
since 1977 and is also a professor of
statistics and operations research.
He will serve as acting provost until a
permanent replacement for Miller
can be found.
A search committee seeking a re
placement for Miller will probably
narrow the list of possible successors
to a small number of candidates by
early February, according to )ean Fet
ter, assistant to the president. She
added that Lieberman has agreed to
hold the job until Aug. 31 if neces
sary.
1 he provost is the senior vice pres
ident of the University — there are
five altogether — and the second
executive officer under the presi
dent, responsible to him for the ad
ministration of the academic prog
ram in all the schools of the Univer
sity.
The provost is also the president's
chief delegate in preparing the Uni
versity budget.
Robert Street, professor of civil
engineering, will replace Lieberman
as acting vice provost and dean of
research.
