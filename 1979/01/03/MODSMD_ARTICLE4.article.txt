# Psychiatrist denies cults, violence linked

### LEE TIEN 
"Religious cults are no more apt to
do violence" than any other or
ganized group, according to Dr.
Donald Lunde, clinical associate pro
fessor of psychiatry and law lecturer
here.
Lunde said that the linking of re
ligious cults with violence is "very
definitely a misconception." Despite
the number of cults here, he said that
"California has never been particu
larly high (in terms of the murder
rate) compared to the other states."
According to Lunde, the Peoples
Temple incident in Guyana is a poor
example from which to generalize
about any relationship between cults
and violence.
"It could only have happened in
isolation," he said. "It was total can

trol" of the environment, Lunde
said, which allowed Rev. Jim Jones to
dominate his followers so com
pletely.

If the group had been living in San
Francisco before the incident, Lunde
said that "there would have been no
way" the mass suicide could have
occurred because rumors of suicide
pacts would have filtered through to
officials, as such reports did even
from Guyana.
"You can be sure there would have
been an investigation by local
police," perhaps with informants
and infiltration, Lunde said.
"I don't think it could happen
here," he said.

The main problem with religious
cults today, Lunde said, is not a ten
dency toward violence. Instead, he
said he felt that fraudulent recruiting
practices employed by many of these
groups are most deserving of atten
tion.
Lunde said there are really no
problems for parents of minors who
have entered such sects, because the
law is designed to protect minors.
However, Lunde said that once indi
viduals are of legal age, the problem
becomes nearly insoluble.
In such cases, a possible legal re
course is to classify the person in
question as a "mental incompetent."
Originally this was used to protect
the elderly from exploitation, but re
cently it has been used to take cus
tody of individuals who had joined

cults such as the Unification Church
or the so-called Moonies.
Lunde said this tactic is not com
pletely satisfactory. He added that he
thinks "we would have a hard time
writing a constitutional law in this
country that will stop religious cults
from taking in all the people over
18."
In general, Lunde discounted the
impact of cults in modern American
life.
"If you could count accurately and
compare, you would find a much
higher proportion of people in re
ligious cults 150 years ago," Lunde
said. At that time, "the United States
was full of cults in the Midwest and
the South," he said.
