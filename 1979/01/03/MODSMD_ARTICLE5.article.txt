# Stanford 25, Georgia 22
## Cards dump Bulldogs in third-quarter Astrodome thriller 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Houston — The most surpris
ing New Year's Eve celebration
in Texas this week was held on
the Astrodome Astroturf fol
lowing Stanford's 25-22
Bluebonnet Bowl victory over
Georgia. An hour before, it
seemed certain the only New
Year's festivities the Cards
would engage in would be a
wake mourning Stanford's
demise at the hands of the
Bulldogs.
Trailing 22-0 midway through
the third quarter, Stanford
scored 25 points in 6V2 minutes
to stun the Bulldogs and the
underflow Harris County
Domed Stadium crowd of
44,084.
The Cards capitalized on
three Georgia fumbles and a
short Bulldog punt to reverse a
wretched first half. Steve Dils,
named the game's Most Valu
able Offensive Player, con
nected on three touchdown
passes — two to Ken
Margerum and one to Darrin
Nelson — to knot the game at
22. Ken Naber then booted a
24-yard field goal on the sec
ond play of the last period to
give Stanford coach Bill Walsh
and the Cards their second
bowl victory in two years.
Hemingway defined courage

as "grace under pressure" and
the Cards, who many thought
were dying a painful death
Sunday night, played courage
ously the second half.
Stanford co-captain Gordy
Ceresino, who collected
another Most Valuable Defen
sive Player award for his 20-
tackle performance, to go
along with last year's Sun Bowl
award, stood on a chair in the
Stanford locker room after the
game and shouted, "Listen up
for a minute."
When the noise subsided,
he continued:
"At halftime I told you that in
two years I have never seen
you quit on Bill and I asked you
not to quit on him today. I
knew you wouldn't.
When asked what had trans
pired at half, one player said,
"We did a lot of soul searching.
There wasn't a lot of adjust
ment; just a lot of soul search
ing."
The search bore fruit and, for
Stanford, erased the em
harassment of the first stanza.
A physical, stunting Georgia
defense thwarted Stanford in
the first half, stopping three
drives by sacking Dils. The
blitzing Bulldogs left Dils with
little time to throw and often
he did not have time to look for

his secondary receivers.
The six-week layoff since the
Big Game may have exacted its
toll, too, as Dils appeared less
crisp in the first half than he
had all season.
"Dils was holding the ball
too long in the first half and it
resulted in some big losses,"
Walsh said, before adding,
"but in the second half he
showed he's the best forward
passer in college football."
The Stanford defense had its
problems, too. The Bulldogs
mauled the Cards for 302 yards
in the first half, 173 on the
ground and 129 in the air. Wil
lie McClendon, the Southeast
Conference MVP, cut through
Staford for 77 yards on 10 car
ries to lead the first-half Geor
gia charge.
Georgia quarterbacks Jeff
Pyburn and Buck Belue each
found flanker Carmon Prince
wih a TD pass and Rex Robin
son drilled a 31-yard field goal
as the Bulldogs grabbed a 15-0
halftime advantage.
Robinson, the first-team
All-SEC kicker, connected on
all 29 PAT attempts this year
and set an NCAA record by
making good on 15 of 17 field
goal attempts, a sizzling 88.2
percent.
