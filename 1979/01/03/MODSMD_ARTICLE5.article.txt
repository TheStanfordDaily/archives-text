# Stanford 25, Georgia 22
## Cards dump Bulldogs in third-quarter Astrodome thriller 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Houston — The most surpris
ing New Year's Eve celebration
in Texas this week was held on
the Astrodome Astroturf fol
lowing Stanford's 25-22
Bluebonnet Bowl victory over
Georgia. An hour before, it
seemed certain the only New
Year's festivities the Cards
would engage in would be a
wake mourning Stanford's
demise at the hands of the
Bulldogs.
Trailing 22-0 midway through
the third quarter, Stanford
scored 25 points in 6V2 minutes
to stun the Bulldogs and the
underflow Harris County
Domed Stadium crowd of
44,084.
The Cards capitalized on
three Georgia fumbles and a
short Bulldog punt to reverse a
wretched first half. Steve Dils,
named the game's Most Valu
able Offensive Player, con
nected on three touchdown
passes — two to Ken
Margerum and one to Darrin
Nelson — to knot the game at
22. Ken Naber then booted a
24-yard field goal on the sec
ond play of the last period to
give Stanford coach Bill Walsh
and the Cards their second
bowl victory in two years.
Hemingway defined courage

as "grace under pressure" and
the Cards, who many thought
were dying a painful death
Sunday night, played courage
ously the second half.
Stanford co-captain Gordy
Ceresino, who collected
another Most Valuable Defen
sive Player award for his 20-
tackle performance, to go
along with last year's Sun Bowl
award, stood on a chair in the
Stanford locker room after the
game and shouted, "Listen up
for a minute."
When the noise subsided,
he continued:
"At halftime I told you that in
two years I have never seen
you quit on Bill and I asked you
not to quit on him today. I
knew you wouldn't.
When asked what had trans
pired at half, one player said,
"We did a lot of soul searching.
There wasn't a lot of adjust
ment; just a lot of soul search
ing."
The search bore fruit and, for
Stanford, erased the em
harassment of the first stanza.
A physical, stunting Georgia
defense thwarted Stanford in
the first half, stopping three
drives by sacking Dils. The
blitzing Bulldogs left Dils with
little time to throw and often
he did not have time to look for

his secondary receivers.
The six-week layoff since the
Big Game may have exacted its
toll, too, as Dils appeared less
crisp in the first half than he
had all season.
"Dils was holding the ball
too long in the first half and it
resulted in some big losses,"
Walsh said, before adding,
"but in the second half he
showed he's the best forward
passer in college football."
The Stanford defense had its
problems, too. The Bulldogs
mauled the Cards for 302 yards
in the first half, 173 on the
ground and 129 in the air. Wil
lie McClendon, the Southeast
Conference MVP, cut through
Staford for 77 yards on 10 car
ries to lead the first-half Geor
gia charge.
Georgia quarterbacks Jeff
Pyburn and Buck Belue each
found flanker Carmon Prince
wih a TD pass and Rex Robin
son drilled a 31-yard field goal
as the Bulldogs grabbed a 15-0
halftime advantage.
Robinson, the first-team
All-SEC kicker, connected on
all 29 PAT attempts this year
and set an NCAA record by
making good on 15 of 17 field
goal attempts, a sizzling 88.2
percent.

Bulldogs in the Bluebonnet Bowl held last weekend in Houston.
For Robinson, however,
the windless, Astroturfed envi
a rons of the Astrodome spelled
disaster. For Stanford, they
spelled relief. Robinson mis
sed two PATs and two field go
als, a 31-yard try and a 38-
yarder.
On their first possession of
the second half, the Bulldogs
stormed through the Stanford
defense the same way General
Sherman once stormed
through the Georgians' home
state. Keeping the ball on the
ground, Georgia raced 75 yards
on six plays into the Stanford
end zone, the key run being a
28-yard delay by tailback Matt
Simon. Pyburn crossed the
goalline on a 1-yard quarter
back sneak to lift the Bulldogs
to a 22-0 lead.
Stanford seemed unable to
stop the Bulldogs. But the
Georgians found a way to stop
themselves. Split end Anthony
Arnold tumbled an end
around as he went through the
line and Ceresino pounced on
it.
Two runs by fullback Phil
Francis and a 12-yard pass to
Margerum from Dils moved
Stanford to Georgia's 28. Dils
tripped while retreating into
the pocket, however, to give
Stanford a third-and-14 two
plays later.
Dils burned the gambling
Georgian defense on the next
play, however, when he lofted
a 32-yard TD pass to Margerum
who took advantage of the
hole left in the secondary by a
blitzing safety. A two-point
conversion effort failed and
the Cards trailed 22-6.
Recovered fumble
Georgia, sticking to the
ground, third-and-2 from its
16-yard line when sophomore
linebacker Steve Budinger
stood McClendon up at the
line of scrimmage, causing him
to fumble. Card linebacker
Terry Rennaker recovered the
loose ball and Stanford was
breathing on the Georgia end
zone again.
On the second play of the
following drive, Dils once
again beat the blitz, finding
Nelson with a short pass over
the middle in a space vacated
by blitzing linebackers.
The flashy halfback sprinted
into the end zone with a 20-
yard TD to close the once
cavernous Georgia advantage
to 22-12.
"When you blitz as much as
they do, you run the risk of
the other team breaking one,"
Walsh said. "We broke long
plays four or five times and that
was the difference in the
game."
Placekicker Ken Naber came
in for the PAT, but holder Dils
pitched the ball to Naber who
rambled into the left half of the
end zone to chip two more

points from the Bulldog lead.
Stanford shut down Georgia
on the ensuing possession and
for the first time'all day the
Bulldogs punted. Bulldog
punter Mke Garrett kicked a
35-yard squibbler which Stan
ford's Joe St. Geme returned to
the Georgia 44.
Time to throw
Twice-burned on the blitz,
the Georgia defense reduced
its stunting, giving Dils more
time to throw, time which he
used to great advantage. He hit
Pleis over the middle with a
13-yard strike. Nelson, who
rushed for 100 yards on 16 car
ries, then squirted throgh the
middle for 17 yards.
Margerum, on the sideline,
told Walsh he knew he could
get open on a slant shake.
Walsh sent him in with the play
and Dils found him with a per
fect pass on the left side of the
end zone. Georgia's solid 22-
point lead had been reduced to
a very tenuous two points. On
the point after, Dils rolled right
and flipped a pass to Nelson in
the end zone to tie the score.
Seconds later, Stanford's
Milt McColl forced Belue, the
freshman quarterback who

came off the bench to steer the
Bulldogs to a 29-28 victory over
Georgia Tech, to make a bad
pitch to McClendon. Card
linebackers Tom Hall reco
vered the errant toss.
A 16-yard run by Francis
moved Stanford into comfort
able field goal range and Naber
chipped a 24-yard field goal.
"We did three things that
cost us the game," Georgia
coach Vince Dooley said.
Number one, we are not a very
sound football team. Second,
we were not able to come back
on them tonight, or put them
away when we had the chance.
Third, we made mistakes we
hadn't made all year.
"We showed that we had a
chance to win late and had a
good drive, but you have to
give their defense a lot of cre
dit. Even though they gave up a
lot of yards, they were tough in
the clutch."
Stanford steal
Stanford stole two pages
from Georgia's playbook Sun
day night. Georgia, picked to
finish seventh and eighth in the
SEC by preseason pollsters,
outgained only four of 11 op
ponents during the regular

season, but still managed a
9-1-1 record. New Year's Eve
the Bulldogs outgained Stan
ford, 504 yards to 338.
The Bulldogs also made a
habit of coming from behind
during the season, rallying tp
win six games. Their hopes of a
rally against Stanford were ex
tinguished when Robinson
missed a 31-yard field goal with
9Vi minutes left and Stanford
safety Steve Foley batted down
a Pyburn pass to tight end Ulys
ses Norris on Georgia's last
possession.
For Dooley, it was his fourth
consecutive bowl loss at Geor
gia. "I have been in the busi
ness too long to feel snakebit,"
he said. "I think if we stay with
it long enough, we'll win our
share."
Stanford, meanwhile, con
tinues a charmed bowl exis
tence. The Cards have won all
four postseason games they
have played in during the '70s.
The triumph left the Cards 8-4
on the year and ranked No. 16
in the final UPI college football
poll released yesterday.
All in all, the Cards left Texas
with something more than
frostbite to celebrate.

ing New Year's Eve celebration
in Texas this week was held on
the Astrodome Astroturf fol
lowing Stanford's 25-22
Bluebonnet Bowl victory over
Georgia. An hour before, it
seemed certain the only New
Year's festivities the Cards
would engage in would be a
wake mourning Stanford's
demise at the hands of the
Bulldogs.
Trailing 22-0 midway through
the third quarter, Stanford
scored 25 points in 6V2 minutes
to stun the Bulldogs and the
underflow Harris County
Domed Stadium crowd of
44,084.
The Cards capitalized on
three Georgia fumbles and a
short Bulldog punt to reverse a
wretched first half. Steve Dils,
named the game's Most Valu
able Offensive Player, con
nected on three touchdown
passes — two to Ken
Margerum and one to Darrin
Nelson — to knot the game at
22. Ken Naber then booted a
24-yard field goal on the sec
ond play of the last period to
give Stanford coach Bill Walsh
and the Cards their second
bowl victory in two years.
Hemingway defined courage

as "grace under pressure" and
the Cards, who many thought
were dying a painful death
Sunday night, played courage
ously the second half.
Stanford co-captain Gordy
Ceresino, who collected
another Most Valuable Defen
sive Player award for his 20-
tackle performance, to go
along with last year's Sun Bowl
award, stood on a chair in the
Stanford locker room after the
game and shouted, "Listen up
for a minute."
When the noise subsided,
he continued:
"At halftime I told you that in
two years I have never seen
you quit on Bill and I asked you
not to quit on him today. I
knew you wouldn't.
When asked what had trans
pired at half, one player said,
"We did a lot of soul searching.
There wasn't a lot of adjust
ment; just a lot of soul search
ing."
The search bore fruit and, for
Stanford, erased the em
harassment of the first stanza.
A physical, stunting Georgia
defense thwarted Stanford in
the first half, stopping three
drives by sacking Dils. The
blitzing Bulldogs left Dils with
little time to throw and often
he did not have time to look for

his secondary receivers.
The six-week layoff since the
Big Game may have exacted its
toll, too, as Dils appeared less
crisp in the first half than he
had all season.
"Dils was holding the ball
too long in the first half and it
resulted in some big losses,"
Walsh said, before adding,
"but in the second half he
showed he's the best forward
passer in college football."
The Stanford defense had its
problems, too. The Bulldogs
mauled the Cards for 302 yards
in the first half, 173 on the
ground and 129 in the air. Wil
lie McClendon, the Southeast
Conference MVP, cut through
Staford for 77 yards on 10 car
ries to lead the first-half Geor
gia charge.
Georgia quarterbacks Jeff
Pyburn and Buck Belue each
found flanker Carmon Prince
wih a TD pass and Rex Robin
son drilled a 31-yard field goal
as the Bulldogs grabbed a 15-0
halftime advantage.
Robinson, the first-team
All-SEC kicker, connected on
all 29 PAT attempts this year
and set an NCAA record by
making good on 15 of 17 field
goal attempts, a sizzling 88.2
percent.

Bulldogs in the Bluebonnet Bowl held last weekend in Houston.
For Robinson, however,
the windless, Astroturfed envi
a rons of the Astrodome spelled
disaster. For Stanford, they
spelled relief. Robinson mis
sed two PATs and two field go
als, a 31-yard try and a 38-
yarder.
On their first possession of
the second half, the Bulldogs
stormed through the Stanford
defense the same way General
Sherman once stormed
through the Georgians' home
state. Keeping the ball on the
ground, Georgia raced 75 yards
on six plays into the Stanford
end zone, the key run being a
28-yard delay by tailback Matt
Simon. Pyburn crossed the
goalline on a 1-yard quarter
back sneak to lift the Bulldogs
to a 22-0 lead.
Stanford seemed unable to
stop the Bulldogs. But the
Georgians found a way to stop
themselves. Split end Anthony
Arnold tumbled an end
around as he went through the
line and Ceresino pounced on
it.
Two runs by fullback Phil
Francis and a 12-yard pass to
Margerum from Dils moved
Stanford to Georgia's 28. Dils
tripped while retreating into
the pocket, however, to give
Stanford a third-and-14 two
plays later.
Dils burned the gambling
Georgian defense on the next
play, however, when he lofted
a 32-yard TD pass to Margerum
who took advantage of the
hole left in the secondary by a
blitzing safety. A two-point
conversion effort failed and
the Cards trailed 22-6.
Recovered fumble
Georgia, sticking to the
ground, third-and-2 from its
16-yard line when sophomore
linebacker Steve Budinger
stood McClendon up at the
line of scrimmage, causing him
to fumble. Card linebacker
Terry Rennaker recovered the
loose ball and Stanford was
breathing on the Georgia end
zone again.
On the second play of the
following drive, Dils once
again beat the blitz, finding
Nelson with a short pass over
the middle in a space vacated
by blitzing linebackers.
The flashy halfback sprinted
into the end zone with a 20-
yard TD to close the once
cavernous Georgia advantage
to 22-12.
"When you blitz as much as
they do, you run the risk of
the other team breaking one,"
Walsh said. "We broke long
plays four or five times and that
was the difference in the
game."
Placekicker Ken Naber came
in for the PAT, but holder Dils
pitched the ball to Naber who
rambled into the left half of the
end zone to chip two more

points from the Bulldog lead.
Stanford shut down Georgia
on the ensuing possession and
for the first time'all day the
Bulldogs punted. Bulldog
punter Mke Garrett kicked a
35-yard squibbler which Stan
ford's Joe St. Geme returned to
the Georgia 44.
Time to throw
Twice-burned on the blitz,
the Georgia defense reduced
its stunting, giving Dils more
time to throw, time which he
used to great advantage. He hit
Pleis over the middle with a
13-yard strike. Nelson, who
rushed for 100 yards on 16 car
ries, then squirted throgh the
middle for 17 yards.
Margerum, on the sideline,
told Walsh he knew he could
get open on a slant shake.
Walsh sent him in with the play
and Dils found him with a per
fect pass on the left side of the
end zone. Georgia's solid 22-
point lead had been reduced to
a very tenuous two points. On
the point after, Dils rolled right
and flipped a pass to Nelson in
the end zone to tie the score.
Seconds later, Stanford's
Milt McColl forced Belue, the
freshman quarterback who

came off the bench to steer the
Bulldogs to a 29-28 victory over
Georgia Tech, to make a bad
pitch to McClendon. Card
linebackers Tom Hall reco
vered the errant toss.
A 16-yard run by Francis
moved Stanford into comfort
able field goal range and Naber
chipped a 24-yard field goal.
"We did three things that
cost us the game," Georgia
coach Vince Dooley said.
Number one, we are not a very
sound football team. Second,
we were not able to come back
on them tonight, or put them
away when we had the chance.
Third, we made mistakes we
hadn't made all year.
"We showed that we had a
chance to win late and had a
good drive, but you have to
give their defense a lot of cre
dit. Even though they gave up a
lot of yards, they were tough in
the clutch."
Stanford steal
Stanford stole two pages
from Georgia's playbook Sun
day night. Georgia, picked to
finish seventh and eighth in the
SEC by preseason pollsters,
outgained only four of 11 op
ponents during the regular

season, but still managed a
9-1-1 record. New Year's Eve
the Bulldogs outgained Stan
ford, 504 yards to 338.
The Bulldogs also made a
habit of coming from behind
during the season, rallying tp
win six games. Their hopes of a
rally against Stanford were ex
tinguished when Robinson
missed a 31-yard field goal with
9Vi minutes left and Stanford
safety Steve Foley batted down
a Pyburn pass to tight end Ulys
ses Norris on Georgia's last
possession.
For Dooley, it was his fourth
consecutive bowl loss at Geor
gia. "I have been in the busi
ness too long to feel snakebit,"
he said. "I think if we stay with
it long enough, we'll win our
share."
Stanford, meanwhile, con
tinues a charmed bowl exis
tence. The Cards have won all
four postseason games they
have played in during the '70s.
The triumph left the Cards 8-4
on the year and ranked No. 16
in the final UPI college football
poll released yesterday.
All in all, the Cards left Texas
with something more than
frostbite to celebrate.

in Texas this week was held on
the Astrodome Astroturf fol
lowing Stanford's 25-22
Bluebonnet Bowl victory over
Georgia. An hour before, it
seemed certain the only New
Year's festivities the Cards
would engage in would be a
wake mourning Stanford's
demise at the hands of the
Bulldogs.
Trailing 22-0 midway through
the third quarter, Stanford
scored 25 points in 6V2 minutes
to stun the Bulldogs and the
underflow Harris County
Domed Stadium crowd of
44,084.
The Cards capitalized on
three Georgia fumbles and a
short Bulldog punt to reverse a
wretched first half. Steve Dils,
named the game's Most Valu
able Offensive Player, con
nected on three touchdown
passes — two to Ken
Margerum and one to Darrin
Nelson — to knot the game at
22. Ken Naber then booted a
24-yard field goal on the sec
ond play of the last period to
give Stanford coach Bill Walsh
and the Cards their second
bowl victory in two years.
Hemingway defined courage

as "grace under pressure" and
the Cards, who many thought
were dying a painful death
Sunday night, played courage
ously the second half.
Stanford co-captain Gordy
Ceresino, who collected
another Most Valuable Defen
sive Player award for his 20-
tackle performance, to go
along with last year's Sun Bowl
award, stood on a chair in the
Stanford locker room after the
game and shouted, "Listen up
for a minute."
When the noise subsided,
he continued:
"At halftime I told you that in
two years I have never seen
you quit on Bill and I asked you
not to quit on him today. I
knew you wouldn't.
When asked what had trans
pired at half, one player said,
"We did a lot of soul searching.
There wasn't a lot of adjust
ment; just a lot of soul search
ing."
The search bore fruit and, for
Stanford, erased the em
harassment of the first stanza.
A physical, stunting Georgia
defense thwarted Stanford in
the first half, stopping three
drives by sacking Dils. The
blitzing Bulldogs left Dils with
little time to throw and often
he did not have time to look for

his secondary receivers.
The six-week layoff since the
Big Game may have exacted its
toll, too, as Dils appeared less
crisp in the first half than he
had all season.
"Dils was holding the ball
too long in the first half and it
resulted in some big losses,"
Walsh said, before adding,
"but in the second half he
showed he's the best forward
passer in college football."
The Stanford defense had its
problems, too. The Bulldogs
mauled the Cards for 302 yards
in the first half, 173 on the
ground and 129 in the air. Wil
lie McClendon, the Southeast
Conference MVP, cut through
Staford for 77 yards on 10 car
ries to lead the first-half Geor
gia charge.
Georgia quarterbacks Jeff
Pyburn and Buck Belue each
found flanker Carmon Prince
wih a TD pass and Rex Robin
son drilled a 31-yard field goal
as the Bulldogs grabbed a 15-0
halftime advantage.
Robinson, the first-team
All-SEC kicker, connected on
all 29 PAT attempts this year
and set an NCAA record by
making good on 15 of 17 field
goal attempts, a sizzling 88.2
percent.

Bulldogs in the Bluebonnet Bowl held last weekend in Houston.
For Robinson, however,
the windless, Astroturfed envi
a rons of the Astrodome spelled
disaster. For Stanford, they
spelled relief. Robinson mis
sed two PATs and two field go
als, a 31-yard try and a 38-
yarder.
On their first possession of
the second half, the Bulldogs
stormed through the Stanford
defense the same way General
Sherman once stormed
through the Georgians' home
state. Keeping the ball on the
ground, Georgia raced 75 yards
on six plays into the Stanford
end zone, the key run being a
28-yard delay by tailback Matt
Simon. Pyburn crossed the
goalline on a 1-yard quarter
back sneak to lift the Bulldogs
to a 22-0 lead.
Stanford seemed unable to
stop the Bulldogs. But the
Georgians found a way to stop
themselves. Split end Anthony
Arnold tumbled an end
around as he went through the
line and Ceresino pounced on
it.
Two runs by fullback Phil
Francis and a 12-yard pass to
Margerum from Dils moved
Stanford to Georgia's 28. Dils
tripped while retreating into
the pocket, however, to give
Stanford a third-and-14 two
plays later.
Dils burned the gambling
Georgian defense on the next
play, however, when he lofted
a 32-yard TD pass to Margerum
who took advantage of the
hole left in the secondary by a
blitzing safety. A two-point
conversion effort failed and
the Cards trailed 22-6.
Recovered fumble
Georgia, sticking to the
ground, third-and-2 from its
16-yard line when sophomore
linebacker Steve Budinger
stood McClendon up at the
line of scrimmage, causing him
to fumble. Card linebacker
Terry Rennaker recovered the
loose ball and Stanford was
breathing on the Georgia end
zone again.
On the second play of the
following drive, Dils once
again beat the blitz, finding
Nelson with a short pass over
the middle in a space vacated
by blitzing linebackers.
The flashy halfback sprinted
into the end zone with a 20-
yard TD to close the once
cavernous Georgia advantage
to 22-12.
"When you blitz as much as
they do, you run the risk of
the other team breaking one,"
Walsh said. "We broke long
plays four or five times and that
was the difference in the
game."
Placekicker Ken Naber came
in for the PAT, but holder Dils
pitched the ball to Naber who
rambled into the left half of the
end zone to chip two more

points from the Bulldog lead.
Stanford shut down Georgia
on the ensuing possession and
for the first time'all day the
Bulldogs punted. Bulldog
punter Mke Garrett kicked a
35-yard squibbler which Stan
ford's Joe St. Geme returned to
the Georgia 44.
Time to throw
Twice-burned on the blitz,
the Georgia defense reduced
its stunting, giving Dils more
time to throw, time which he
used to great advantage. He hit
Pleis over the middle with a
13-yard strike. Nelson, who
rushed for 100 yards on 16 car
ries, then squirted throgh the
middle for 17 yards.
Margerum, on the sideline,
told Walsh he knew he could
get open on a slant shake.
Walsh sent him in with the play
and Dils found him with a per
fect pass on the left side of the
end zone. Georgia's solid 22-
point lead had been reduced to
a very tenuous two points. On
the point after, Dils rolled right
and flipped a pass to Nelson in
the end zone to tie the score.
Seconds later, Stanford's
Milt McColl forced Belue, the
freshman quarterback who

came off the bench to steer the
Bulldogs to a 29-28 victory over
Georgia Tech, to make a bad
pitch to McClendon. Card
linebackers Tom Hall reco
vered the errant toss.
A 16-yard run by Francis
moved Stanford into comfort
able field goal range and Naber
chipped a 24-yard field goal.
"We did three things that
cost us the game," Georgia
coach Vince Dooley said.
Number one, we are not a very
sound football team. Second,
we were not able to come back
on them tonight, or put them
away when we had the chance.
Third, we made mistakes we
hadn't made all year.
"We showed that we had a
chance to win late and had a
good drive, but you have to
give their defense a lot of cre
dit. Even though they gave up a
lot of yards, they were tough in
the clutch."
Stanford steal
Stanford stole two pages
from Georgia's playbook Sun
day night. Georgia, picked to
finish seventh and eighth in the
SEC by preseason pollsters,
outgained only four of 11 op
ponents during the regular

season, but still managed a
9-1-1 record. New Year's Eve
the Bulldogs outgained Stan
ford, 504 yards to 338.
The Bulldogs also made a
habit of coming from behind
during the season, rallying tp
win six games. Their hopes of a
rally against Stanford were ex
tinguished when Robinson
missed a 31-yard field goal with
9Vi minutes left and Stanford
safety Steve Foley batted down
a Pyburn pass to tight end Ulys
ses Norris on Georgia's last
possession.
For Dooley, it was his fourth
consecutive bowl loss at Geor
gia. "I have been in the busi
ness too long to feel snakebit,"
he said. "I think if we stay with
it long enough, we'll win our
share."
Stanford, meanwhile, con
tinues a charmed bowl exis
tence. The Cards have won all
four postseason games they
have played in during the '70s.
The triumph left the Cards 8-4
on the year and ranked No. 16
in the final UPI college football
poll released yesterday.
All in all, the Cards left Texas
with something more than
frostbite to celebrate.
