# Report shows tuition, room and board rates follow national wage/price guidelines
## 
### 
Following is a background paper circulated to the
Board of Trustees recommending tuition and room and
board rates lor 1979-80'
In the two sections which follow, general tuition, room
and board rates (or 1979-80 aggregating an 8.9% increase
are recommended The general tuition is recommended to
increase 9 1% and basic room and board by 8.5% These
increases are consistent with the voluntary Wage-Price
Guidelines issued by President Carter on October 24, 1978
Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1979-80.
That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the general
tuition rate for the academic year 1979-80 be set at $5,595
($1,865 per regular quarter). Further, these committees
recommend approval to set tuition rates for entering M D
candidates at $6,873 ($2,291 per regular quarter); for
continuing M D candidates at $6,174 ($2,058 per regular
quarter); and for the School ol Law at $5,744 ($2,872 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1979-80
Background:
A comparison of the 1979-80 tuition recommendations is
as follows:
From To %
Type 1978-79 1979-80 Increase Increase
General
Tuition $5,130 $5,5595 $ 465 91%
Schl. of Medicine (M.D Program)
Entering
Students $5,388 $6,873 $1,485 27.6%
Continuing
Students $5,388 $6,174 $ 786 14 6%
School of
Law $5,280 $5,744 $ 464 8 8%

At their Dec. 12 meeting the Board of Trustees
voted "that tuition for 1979-80 in the Medical
School be set so as to meet the tuition objectives
proposed over a three-year period and that the
final formulation be ratified by the president of
the Board of Trustees, the president of the
University, and the heads of the trustee com
mittees on Finance & Development and Academic
Affairs."

In the information presented below, we outline the
(actors which have been influential in determining these
recommendations While several factors have been taken
into account, the overall objective has been to establish
tuition rates which are
1) in keeping with national voluntary wage-price
guidelines;
2) consistent with the University's financial plans, and;
3) which, when offset by financial aid for those with
demonstrated financial need, keep Stanford economically
accessible to qualified applicants.
The first section addresses the wage-price guidelines
The second looks at financial planning considerations. The
third and fourth sections address respectively 1) research
and related questions in the area of undergraduate ad
missions, financial aid, and enrollment, and 2) Stanford's
current comparative positions with other institutions.
National Voluntary Wage-Price Guidelines
The Guidelines in respect to what a college or university
can charge its students in 1979-80 have two essential
components The first relates the increase in charges for
1979-80 to the increase in charges in the base period The
second further decelerates the increase in relation to the
degree to which 1979-80 wage increases will rise less fast
than did wage increases in the base period.
The Guidelines apply, then, to each college or university
(or other organization) in terms of that organization's recent
history, not in terms of a standard limit identically applicable
to all. The figure of 5 3 /< % which has been discussed as the
price guideline is an economy-wide average
We have found, in working to understand and then apply
the Guidelines to Stanford's 1979-80 needs and plgns, that
they raise serious conceptual and calculational difficulties.
We expect over the course of 1978-79 to be working with the
Guidelines and with successive interpretations and
refinements to calibrate price limitations appropriately
throughout the institution.
For purposes of tuition, room, and board, we have made
an effort in good faith to determine empirically and by
estimate the base period figures upon which the appropriate
price guidelines should be based In summary form, our
calculation takes the following course (with the base period
as the first quartersof fiscal years 1975-76 and 1977-78)

Weighted average of tuition, room, and
board increases over the base period 10 7%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10 2%
Weighted average of increases in wages and
nonmandatory benefits during base period 9 2%
Less comparable increase under guidelines
in 1979-80 7.0%
Difference 2.2%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Difference 1.7%'
Multiplied by fraction which compensation
is of appropriate operating expenditures .65
Wage decelerator 11%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10.2%
Less Wage decelerator 1.1%
Tuition, room, and board increase limit,
per guidelines 9 1%
Because this is an overall figure, the several separate
increases covered in this recommendation must fall under it
on a weighted average basis, rather than each one being
governed individually by a 9 1% limit thus, while the M.D.
tuition increases are above 9.1%, they are offset by the
weighted average of room and board (see below), which
comes to 8.2%.
The weighted average ol all the recommendations in
cluded in this action is 9.1%, a figure which is within the
Wage-Price Guidelines insofar as we have been able
adequately to understand and apply those Guidelines to
Stanford's recent past and present plans.
Financial Planning Considerations
In the iong-range financial forecast of a year ago, the
tuition element of income was assumed to grow at 2.9%
above inflation (the Consumer Price Index) in 1979-80. With
inflation currently projected in the neighborhood ol 8.0%
nationally, that assumption would have produced a tuition
increase of 10.9% Room and board rates might have grown
at a sorrv -hat lower rate, since the costs to be met have
components such as debt service, which are fixed or which
grow more slowly than the CPI.
With inflation as high as 8 0%, it is quite possible that we
would not have recommended converting the forecast
assumptions directly into budget plans But to set tuition
lower would have required lowering expenditure assump
tions as well Needless to say, the advent of Wage-Price
Guidelines mooted all speculation of the relation of those
assumptions to budget plans.
The aspects of the current long-range financial forecast
which press forcefully upon 1979-80 plans are those related
to inflation, to the decline of the dollar abroad, and in general
to that category o' expense we have called "con
solidations."
Consolidations are new budget requirements which are
at best only semidiscretionary, for example, those
associated with the aging of facilities and the consequent
heavier level of programmed maintenance and repair. These
expenses along with provision for a modest level of im
provement produce, we believe, strong arguments in sup
port of the recommended level of general tuition.
In the School of Medicine the unusually high tuition
recommendations come from the objective of restoring the
relationship between tuition and the cost of medical
education, (See box in first column.)
In 1972 the Institute of Medicine conducted a study of the
cost of medical education, citing the figure for Stanford at
$16,450 per student per year. In 1972-73 the tuition charged
each student for the typical load of 3.5 quarters was 21.6%
of the average annual cost per student. In 1978-79 that cost
is approximately $35,200, and tuition (again, for 3.5 quarters)
comes to 17.9% of the cost figure
Under the recommendations set forth here, M.D tuition
in 1979-80 will comprise approximately 21 % of the average
annual cost per student. The School, through a combination
of fellowship aid and loans, will be able to meet the
demonstrated financial need of medical students in 1979-80
Admissions and Financial Aid Considerations.
The undergraduate admissions process and the financial
aid policies of the University serve two separate and distinct
purposes The objective of the admissions process is to
admit the most able and qualified students. This decision is
made without regard to the financial circumstances of the
student or his or her family.
Once a student has been admitted, the objective of
financial aid policy is the reduction of economic barriers for
the student with financial need. By applying this policy and
meeting all demonstrated financial need, the University
makes possible initial access and continued enrollment
thereafter.

We examine the recommended tuition rate against
undergraduate admissions and financial aid obiectives to
insure, insofar as we can, that the rate will not be a
systematic barrier to attracting and enrolling an able and
qualified sutdent body
To check for evidence as to whether this objective is
being met, we have for a number of years monitored the
enrollment behavior of the incoming freshman class A
report for 1978-79 was prepared and included with the
November Board Agenda. In this background note, we touch
only on the highlights of that report
In looking at the results of the 1978-79 report,, we saw a
continuation of the significant patterns observed in earlier
years. The most significant difference was the increase in
the total applications, up approximately 10% in those who
begin the application process, and up by approximately 6%
(to 9,000) in those who complete the process and are, thus,
"actionable candidates." Looking at the choices made by
those individuals admitted to Stanford but electing to enroll
elsewhere, we saw this pattern
Enrollment Choices ol Admittees Enrolling Elsewhere
Year % Choosing Private % Choosing Public
1972-73 75 25
1973-74 77 23
1974-75 82 18
1975-76 80 20
1976-77 76 24
1977-78 78 22
1978-79 77 23
The actual choices where 10 or more of those admittees
chose a given institution were these:

Schools Chosen by Admittees Enrolling Elsewhere

Pomona 14
Northwestern 10
U.S.C. 10
Cornell 10
Georgetown 10
In terms of the relationship of enrollment percentages
and family economic circumstances, the report showed no
significant differences from the patterns of prior years,
patterns which cause us to be neither alarmed nor com
placent.
In concluding, the report states:
Overall, this year's research has again pointed
to the continued strength of the applicant and
enrollment figures. In addition, most measures
have been shown to be quite stable and where
fluctuations have occurred, they have been
within familiar ranges. This continues to be
especially reassuring with regard to the high
cost/financial aids question. Given the
stability in most factors, it seems important to
continue to maintain the sort of monitoring
which this report represents.
Two further aspects worth noting pertain to aid in
financing college costs First, as we noted last month, the
newly passed Middle-Income Student Assistance Act will
provide additional support to Stanford students and parents.
The Basic Opportunity grant provision raises the family
income limit from $15,000 to $25,000 The guaranteed
student loan program provides an interest subsidy with no
family-income limit, thus making available a significant form
of assistance to middle-income students arid their families.
Second, Stanford began in 1977 its own Parent Loan
Program, making loans for tuition, room, and board ex
penses available to parents at 8 3 /« % interest The use of that
program over the two years of its experience looks like this:
Parent Loan Plan
1977-78 1978-79
Number of Participants 116 121
Average annual loan amount $3,961 $4,750
Maximum loan available $6,000 $7,000

Median adjusted gross family
income $30-35,000 $35-40,000
Percent ot borrowers who chose
maximum annual loan 29% 34%
A questionnaire sent to 1977-78 participants elicited from
about half of the respondents the judgment that the PLP
made a significant difference in their financial ability to send
their sons or daughters to Stanford
Cost Comparisons with Other Institutions
In looking at where Stanford stands in relation to the sum
of tuition, mandatory fees, room, and board, we gathered
current-year information on the independent institutions
most often selected by students admitted here We did not
speculate about what those institutions might charge in
1979-80, since the applicability of wage-price guidelines is
expressed in terms of each one's individual history.

Establishment of Room and Board Rates for 1979-
80
That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the basic
rcom and board rate for the academic year 1979-80 be set at
$2,354, an increase of 8 5%, that the room rate be set at
$1,003, an increase of 7.7%, that the full board rate be set at
$1,351, an increase of 9 1%, and that the rates for specific
units be set within the pattern of these rates. Further, that
Escondido Village apartment rentals be increased by 7.7%.
Background:
Residences and Food Service- In December 1977 the
Board approved a 1978-79 basic room and board rate of
$2,169 The basic room rate was set at $931, (full-service
residence with University-operated kitchen) and the basic
board rate at $1,238. Room rates for the current year vary
from $888 (utilities included) in self-operated houses and
fraternity clusters to $1,040 in full-service residences with
self-operated kitchens.
For 1979-80 a basic rate of $2,354 is proposed, an in
crease of 8.5%. This consists of a basic room rate of $1,003,
a 7.7% increase, and a basic board rate of $1,351, a 9.1%
increase. All room and board rates for the various options
are expected to increase by 7 7% and 9.1 %, respectively.
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $213 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $277 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment. All apartments are furnished, and
utilities are provided Apartment rents for 1979-80 will be set
at from $229 per month for a one-bedroom apartment to
$298 per month for a four-bedroom apartment. Commencing
with academic year 1979-80, Escondido Village facilities and
finances will be integrated more closely with the total
residence system, in terms of assignment of spaces, use of
operating funds, and use of major repair funds.
The 8.5% increase in the combined room and board rate
affects 3,300 students—those who live in University
residences and are served by University food service. The
remaining 3,600 students living in University residences will
see an increase of just 7.7% in their room or apartment
costs. The weighted average of University-imposed in
creases on these 6,900 residents is an 8 2% rise in costs.
The proposed increases will enable the residences, food
services, and apartments to break even for 1979-80. Further,
the increases will permit an increase of $339,000 flowing to
the major repair reserves and a consequent acceleration in
major reoairs, particularly in the older residences.
Even at the increased level of allocation to the major
repair reserves, expenditures on major repairs for 1978-79
and 1979-80 will exceed the amounts flowing into the
reserves, and the reserves will be nearly depleted by the end
of fiscal year 1980 Consequently, the continuation of an
accelerated major repair program beyond 1980 will call for
further increases in allocations to the major repair reserves.
These statements are consistent with the assumptions of the
long-range forecast for housing presented to the Board of
Trustees at the November 1978 meeting.
While the major repair reserve balances will drop to
$17,000 at the end of the year 1979-80, the operating
reserves for the housing system will stand at approximately
$1,100,000 at that time.

$2,354, an increase of 8 5%, that the room rate be set at
$1,003, an increase of 7.7%, that the full board rate be set at
$1,351, an increase of 9 1%, and that the rates for specific
units be set within the pattern of these rates. Further, that
Escondido Village apartment rentals be increased by 7.7%.
Background:
Residences and Food Service- In December 1977 the
Board approved a 1978-79 basic room and board rate of
$2,169 The basic room rate was set at $931, (full-service
residence with University-operated kitchen) and the basic
board rate at $1,238. Room rates for the current year vary
from $888 (utilities included) in self-operated houses and
fraternity clusters to $1,040 in full-service residences with
self-operated kitchens.
For 1979-80 a basic rate of $2,354 is proposed, an in
crease of 8.5%. This consists of a basic room rate of $1,003,
a 7.7% increase, and a basic board rate of $1,351, a 9.1%
increase. All room and board rates for the various options
are expected to increase by 7 7% and 9.1 %, respectively.
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $213 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $277 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment. All apartments are furnished, and
utilities are provided Apartment rents for 1979-80 will be set
at from $229 per month for a one-bedroom apartment to
$298 per month for a four-bedroom apartment. Commencing
with academic year 1979-80, Escondido Village facilities and
finances will be integrated more closely with the total
residence system, in terms of assignment of spaces, use of
operating funds, and use of major repair funds.
The 8.5% increase in the combined room and board rate
affects 3,300 students—those who live in University
residences and are served by University food service. The
remaining 3,600 students living in University residences will
see an increase of just 7.7% in their room or apartment
costs. The weighted average of University-imposed in
creases on these 6,900 residents is an 8 2% rise in costs.
The proposed increases will enable the residences, food
services, and apartments to break even for 1979-80. Further,
the increases will permit an increase of $339,000 flowing to
the major repair reserves and a consequent acceleration in
major reoairs, particularly in the older residences.
Even at the increased level of allocation to the major
repair reserves, expenditures on major repairs for 1978-79
and 1979-80 will exceed the amounts flowing into the
reserves, and the reserves will be nearly depleted by the end
of fiscal year 1980 Consequently, the continuation of an
accelerated major repair program beyond 1980 will call for
further increases in allocations to the major repair reserves.
These statements are consistent with the assumptions of the
long-range forecast for housing presented to the Board of
Trustees at the November 1978 meeting.
While the major repair reserve balances will drop to
$17,000 at the end of the year 1979-80, the operating
reserves for the housing system will stand at approximately
$1,100,000 at that time.

Following is a background paper circulated to the
Board of Trustees recommending tuition and room and
board rates lor 1979-80'
In the two sections which follow, general tuition, room
and board rates (or 1979-80 aggregating an 8.9% increase
are recommended The general tuition is recommended to
increase 9 1% and basic room and board by 8.5% These
increases are consistent with the voluntary Wage-Price
Guidelines issued by President Carter on October 24, 1978
Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1979-80.
That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the general
tuition rate for the academic year 1979-80 be set at $5,595
($1,865 per regular quarter). Further, these committees
recommend approval to set tuition rates for entering M D
candidates at $6,873 ($2,291 per regular quarter); for
continuing M D candidates at $6,174 ($2,058 per regular
quarter); and for the School ol Law at $5,744 ($2,872 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1979-80
Background:
A comparison of the 1979-80 tuition recommendations is
as follows:
From To %
Type 1978-79 1979-80 Increase Increase
General
Tuition $5,130 $5,5595 $ 465 91%
Schl. of Medicine (M.D Program)
Entering
Students $5,388 $6,873 $1,485 27.6%
Continuing
Students $5,388 $6,174 $ 786 14 6%
School of
Law $5,280 $5,744 $ 464 8 8%

At their Dec. 12 meeting the Board of Trustees
voted "that tuition for 1979-80 in the Medical
School be set so as to meet the tuition objectives
proposed over a three-year period and that the
final formulation be ratified by the president of
the Board of Trustees, the president of the
University, and the heads of the trustee com
mittees on Finance & Development and Academic
Affairs."

In the information presented below, we outline the
(actors which have been influential in determining these
recommendations While several factors have been taken
into account, the overall objective has been to establish
tuition rates which are
1) in keeping with national voluntary wage-price
guidelines;
2) consistent with the University's financial plans, and;
3) which, when offset by financial aid for those with
demonstrated financial need, keep Stanford economically
accessible to qualified applicants.
The first section addresses the wage-price guidelines
The second looks at financial planning considerations. The
third and fourth sections address respectively 1) research
and related questions in the area of undergraduate ad
missions, financial aid, and enrollment, and 2) Stanford's
current comparative positions with other institutions.
National Voluntary Wage-Price Guidelines
The Guidelines in respect to what a college or university
can charge its students in 1979-80 have two essential
components The first relates the increase in charges for
1979-80 to the increase in charges in the base period The
second further decelerates the increase in relation to the
degree to which 1979-80 wage increases will rise less fast
than did wage increases in the base period.
The Guidelines apply, then, to each college or university
(or other organization) in terms of that organization's recent
history, not in terms of a standard limit identically applicable
to all. The figure of 5 3 /< % which has been discussed as the
price guideline is an economy-wide average
We have found, in working to understand and then apply
the Guidelines to Stanford's 1979-80 needs and plgns, that
they raise serious conceptual and calculational difficulties.
We expect over the course of 1978-79 to be working with the
Guidelines and with successive interpretations and
refinements to calibrate price limitations appropriately
throughout the institution.
For purposes of tuition, room, and board, we have made
an effort in good faith to determine empirically and by
estimate the base period figures upon which the appropriate
price guidelines should be based In summary form, our
calculation takes the following course (with the base period
as the first quartersof fiscal years 1975-76 and 1977-78)

Weighted average of tuition, room, and
board increases over the base period 10 7%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10 2%
Weighted average of increases in wages and
nonmandatory benefits during base period 9 2%
Less comparable increase under guidelines
in 1979-80 7.0%
Difference 2.2%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Difference 1.7%'
Multiplied by fraction which compensation
is of appropriate operating expenditures .65
Wage decelerator 11%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10.2%
Less Wage decelerator 1.1%
Tuition, room, and board increase limit,
per guidelines 9 1%
Because this is an overall figure, the several separate
increases covered in this recommendation must fall under it
on a weighted average basis, rather than each one being
governed individually by a 9 1% limit thus, while the M.D.
tuition increases are above 9.1%, they are offset by the
weighted average of room and board (see below), which
comes to 8.2%.
The weighted average ol all the recommendations in
cluded in this action is 9.1%, a figure which is within the
Wage-Price Guidelines insofar as we have been able
adequately to understand and apply those Guidelines to
Stanford's recent past and present plans.
Financial Planning Considerations
In the iong-range financial forecast of a year ago, the
tuition element of income was assumed to grow at 2.9%
above inflation (the Consumer Price Index) in 1979-80. With
inflation currently projected in the neighborhood ol 8.0%
nationally, that assumption would have produced a tuition
increase of 10.9% Room and board rates might have grown
at a sorrv -hat lower rate, since the costs to be met have
components such as debt service, which are fixed or which
grow more slowly than the CPI.
With inflation as high as 8 0%, it is quite possible that we
would not have recommended converting the forecast
assumptions directly into budget plans But to set tuition
lower would have required lowering expenditure assump
tions as well Needless to say, the advent of Wage-Price
Guidelines mooted all speculation of the relation of those
assumptions to budget plans.
The aspects of the current long-range financial forecast
which press forcefully upon 1979-80 plans are those related
to inflation, to the decline of the dollar abroad, and in general
to that category o' expense we have called "con
solidations."
Consolidations are new budget requirements which are
at best only semidiscretionary, for example, those
associated with the aging of facilities and the consequent
heavier level of programmed maintenance and repair. These
expenses along with provision for a modest level of im
provement produce, we believe, strong arguments in sup
port of the recommended level of general tuition.
In the School of Medicine the unusually high tuition
recommendations come from the objective of restoring the
relationship between tuition and the cost of medical
education, (See box in first column.)
In 1972 the Institute of Medicine conducted a study of the
cost of medical education, citing the figure for Stanford at
$16,450 per student per year. In 1972-73 the tuition charged
each student for the typical load of 3.5 quarters was 21.6%
of the average annual cost per student. In 1978-79 that cost
is approximately $35,200, and tuition (again, for 3.5 quarters)
comes to 17.9% of the cost figure
Under the recommendations set forth here, M.D tuition
in 1979-80 will comprise approximately 21 % of the average
annual cost per student. The School, through a combination
of fellowship aid and loans, will be able to meet the
demonstrated financial need of medical students in 1979-80
Admissions and Financial Aid Considerations.
The undergraduate admissions process and the financial
aid policies of the University serve two separate and distinct
purposes The objective of the admissions process is to
admit the most able and qualified students. This decision is
made without regard to the financial circumstances of the
student or his or her family.
Once a student has been admitted, the objective of
financial aid policy is the reduction of economic barriers for
the student with financial need. By applying this policy and
meeting all demonstrated financial need, the University
makes possible initial access and continued enrollment
thereafter.

We examine the recommended tuition rate against
undergraduate admissions and financial aid obiectives to
insure, insofar as we can, that the rate will not be a
systematic barrier to attracting and enrolling an able and
qualified sutdent body
To check for evidence as to whether this objective is
being met, we have for a number of years monitored the
enrollment behavior of the incoming freshman class A
report for 1978-79 was prepared and included with the
November Board Agenda. In this background note, we touch
only on the highlights of that report
In looking at the results of the 1978-79 report,, we saw a
continuation of the significant patterns observed in earlier
years. The most significant difference was the increase in
the total applications, up approximately 10% in those who
begin the application process, and up by approximately 6%
(to 9,000) in those who complete the process and are, thus,
"actionable candidates." Looking at the choices made by
those individuals admitted to Stanford but electing to enroll
elsewhere, we saw this pattern
Enrollment Choices ol Admittees Enrolling Elsewhere

1975-76 80 20
1976-77 76 24
1977-78 78 22
1978-79 77 23
The actual choices where 10 or more of those admittees
chose a given institution were these:

CalTech 15
Pomona 14
Northwestern 10
U.S.C. 10
Cornell 10
Georgetown 10
In terms of the relationship of enrollment percentages
and family economic circumstances, the report showed no
significant differences from the patterns of prior years,
patterns which cause us to be neither alarmed nor com
placent.
In concluding, the report states:
Overall, this year's research has again pointed
to the continued strength of the applicant and
enrollment figures. In addition, most measures
have been shown to be quite stable and where
fluctuations have occurred, they have been
within familiar ranges. This continues to be
especially reassuring with regard to the high
cost/financial aids question. Given the
stability in most factors, it seems important to
continue to maintain the sort of monitoring
which this report represents.
Two further aspects worth noting pertain to aid in
financing college costs First, as we noted last month, the
newly passed Middle-Income Student Assistance Act will
provide additional support to Stanford students and parents.
The Basic Opportunity grant provision raises the family
income limit from $15,000 to $25,000 The guaranteed
student loan program provides an interest subsidy with no
family-income limit, thus making available a significant form
of assistance to middle-income students arid their families.
Second, Stanford began in 1977 its own Parent Loan
Program, making loans for tuition, room, and board ex
penses available to parents at 8 3 /« % interest The use of that
program over the two years of its experience looks like this:
Parent Loan Plan
1977-78 1978-79
Number of Participants 116 121
Average annual loan amount $3,961 $4,750
Maximum loan available $6,000 $7,000

Median adjusted gross family
income $30-35,000 $35-40,000
Percent ot borrowers who chose
maximum annual loan 29% 34%
A questionnaire sent to 1977-78 participants elicited from
about half of the respondents the judgment that the PLP
made a significant difference in their financial ability to send
their sons or daughters to Stanford
Cost Comparisons with Other Institutions
In looking at where Stanford stands in relation to the sum
of tuition, mandatory fees, room, and board, we gathered
current-year information on the independent institutions
most often selected by students admitted here We did not
speculate about what those institutions might charge in
1979-80, since the applicability of wage-price guidelines is
expressed in terms of each one's individual history.

Establishment of Room and Board Rates for 1979-

That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the basic

$2,354, an increase of 8 5%, that the room rate be set at
$1,003, an increase of 7.7%, that the full board rate be set at
$1,351, an increase of 9 1%, and that the rates for specific
units be set within the pattern of these rates. Further, that
Escondido Village apartment rentals be increased by 7.7%.
Background:
Residences and Food Service- In December 1977 the
Board approved a 1978-79 basic room and board rate of
$2,169 The basic room rate was set at $931, (full-service
residence with University-operated kitchen) and the basic
board rate at $1,238. Room rates for the current year vary
from $888 (utilities included) in self-operated houses and
fraternity clusters to $1,040 in full-service residences with
self-operated kitchens.
For 1979-80 a basic rate of $2,354 is proposed, an in
crease of 8.5%. This consists of a basic room rate of $1,003,
a 7.7% increase, and a basic board rate of $1,351, a 9.1%
increase. All room and board rates for the various options
are expected to increase by 7 7% and 9.1 %, respectively.
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $213 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $277 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment. All apartments are furnished, and
utilities are provided Apartment rents for 1979-80 will be set
at from $229 per month for a one-bedroom apartment to
$298 per month for a four-bedroom apartment. Commencing
with academic year 1979-80, Escondido Village facilities and
finances will be integrated more closely with the total
residence system, in terms of assignment of spaces, use of
operating funds, and use of major repair funds.
The 8.5% increase in the combined room and board rate
affects 3,300 students—those who live in University
residences and are served by University food service. The
remaining 3,600 students living in University residences will
see an increase of just 7.7% in their room or apartment
costs. The weighted average of University-imposed in
creases on these 6,900 residents is an 8 2% rise in costs.
The proposed increases will enable the residences, food
services, and apartments to break even for 1979-80. Further,
the increases will permit an increase of $339,000 flowing to
the major repair reserves and a consequent acceleration in
major reoairs, particularly in the older residences.
Even at the increased level of allocation to the major
repair reserves, expenditures on major repairs for 1978-79
and 1979-80 will exceed the amounts flowing into the
reserves, and the reserves will be nearly depleted by the end
of fiscal year 1980 Consequently, the continuation of an
accelerated major repair program beyond 1980 will call for
further increases in allocations to the major repair reserves.
These statements are consistent with the assumptions of the
long-range forecast for housing presented to the Board of
Trustees at the November 1978 meeting.
While the major repair reserve balances will drop to
$17,000 at the end of the year 1979-80, the operating
reserves for the housing system will stand at approximately
$1,100,000 at that time.

in 1979-80 will comprise approximately 21 % of the average

In terms of the relationship of enrollment percentages
and family economic circumstances, the report showed no
significant differences from the patterns of prior years,
patterns which cause us to be neither alarmed nor com
placent.
In concluding, the report states:
Overall, this year's research has again pointed
to the continued strength of the applicant and
enrollment figures. In addition, most measures
have been shown to be quite stable and where
fluctuations have occurred, they have been
within familiar ranges. This continues to be
especially reassuring with regard to the high
cost/financial aids question. Given the
stability in most factors, it seems important to
continue to maintain the sort of monitoring
which this report represents.
Two further aspects worth noting pertain to aid in
financing college costs First, as we noted last month, the
newly passed Middle-Income Student Assistance Act will
provide additional support to Stanford students and parents.
The Basic Opportunity grant provision raises the family
income limit from $15,000 to $25,000 The guaranteed
student loan program provides an interest subsidy with no
family-income limit, thus making available a significant form
of assistance to middle-income students arid their families.
Second, Stanford began in 1977 its own Parent Loan
Program, making loans for tuition, room, and board ex
penses available to parents at 8 3 /« % interest The use of that
program over the two years of its experience looks like this:
Parent Loan Plan
1977-78 1978-79
Number of Participants 116 121
Average annual loan amount $3,961 $4,750
Maximum loan available $6,000 $7,000

Median adjusted gross family
income $30-35,000 $35-40,000
Percent ot borrowers who chose
maximum annual loan 29% 34%
A questionnaire sent to 1977-78 participants elicited from
about half of the respondents the judgment that the PLP
made a significant difference in their financial ability to send
their sons or daughters to Stanford
Cost Comparisons with Other Institutions
In looking at where Stanford stands in relation to the sum
of tuition, mandatory fees, room, and board, we gathered
current-year information on the independent institutions
most often selected by students admitted here We did not
speculate about what those institutions might charge in
1979-80, since the applicability of wage-price guidelines is
expressed in terms of each one's individual history.

Establishment of Room and Board Rates for 1979-
80
That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the basic
rcom and board rate for the academic year 1979-80 be set at
$2,354, an increase of 8 5%, that the room rate be set at
$1,003, an increase of 7.7%, that the full board rate be set at
$1,351, an increase of 9 1%, and that the rates for specific
units be set within the pattern of these rates. Further, that
Escondido Village apartment rentals be increased by 7.7%.
Background:
Residences and Food Service- In December 1977 the
Board approved a 1978-79 basic room and board rate of
$2,169 The basic room rate was set at $931, (full-service
residence with University-operated kitchen) and the basic
board rate at $1,238. Room rates for the current year vary
from $888 (utilities included) in self-operated houses and
fraternity clusters to $1,040 in full-service residences with
self-operated kitchens.
For 1979-80 a basic rate of $2,354 is proposed, an in
crease of 8.5%. This consists of a basic room rate of $1,003,
a 7.7% increase, and a basic board rate of $1,351, a 9.1%
increase. All room and board rates for the various options
are expected to increase by 7 7% and 9.1 %, respectively.
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $213 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $277 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment. All apartments are furnished, and
utilities are provided Apartment rents for 1979-80 will be set
at from $229 per month for a one-bedroom apartment to
$298 per month for a four-bedroom apartment. Commencing
with academic year 1979-80, Escondido Village facilities and
finances will be integrated more closely with the total
residence system, in terms of assignment of spaces, use of
operating funds, and use of major repair funds.
The 8.5% increase in the combined room and board rate
affects 3,300 students—those who live in University
residences and are served by University food service. The
remaining 3,600 students living in University residences will
see an increase of just 7.7% in their room or apartment
costs. The weighted average of University-imposed in
creases on these 6,900 residents is an 8 2% rise in costs.
The proposed increases will enable the residences, food
services, and apartments to break even for 1979-80. Further,
the increases will permit an increase of $339,000 flowing to
the major repair reserves and a consequent acceleration in
major reoairs, particularly in the older residences.
Even at the increased level of allocation to the major
repair reserves, expenditures on major repairs for 1978-79
and 1979-80 will exceed the amounts flowing into the
reserves, and the reserves will be nearly depleted by the end
of fiscal year 1980 Consequently, the continuation of an
accelerated major repair program beyond 1980 will call for
further increases in allocations to the major repair reserves.
These statements are consistent with the assumptions of the
long-range forecast for housing presented to the Board of
Trustees at the November 1978 meeting.
While the major repair reserve balances will drop to
$17,000 at the end of the year 1979-80, the operating
reserves for the housing system will stand at approximately
$1,100,000 at that time.

Following is a background paper circulated to the
Board of Trustees recommending tuition and room and
board rates lor 1979-80'
In the two sections which follow, general tuition, room
and board rates (or 1979-80 aggregating an 8.9% increase
are recommended The general tuition is recommended to
increase 9 1% and basic room and board by 8.5% These
increases are consistent with the voluntary Wage-Price
Guidelines issued by President Carter on October 24, 1978
Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1979-80.
That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the general
tuition rate for the academic year 1979-80 be set at $5,595
($1,865 per regular quarter). Further, these committees
recommend approval to set tuition rates for entering M D
candidates at $6,873 ($2,291 per regular quarter); for
continuing M D candidates at $6,174 ($2,058 per regular
quarter); and for the School ol Law at $5,744 ($2,872 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1979-80
Background:
A comparison of the 1979-80 tuition recommendations is
as follows:
From To %
Type 1978-79 1979-80 Increase Increase
General
Tuition $5,130 $5,5595 $ 465 91%
Schl. of Medicine (M.D Program)
Entering
Students $5,388 $6,873 $1,485 27.6%
Continuing
Students $5,388 $6,174 $ 786 14 6%
School of
Law $5,280 $5,744 $ 464 8 8%

At their Dec. 12 meeting the Board of Trustees
voted "that tuition for 1979-80 in the Medical
School be set so as to meet the tuition objectives
proposed over a three-year period and that the
final formulation be ratified by the president of
the Board of Trustees, the president of the
University, and the heads of the trustee com
mittees on Finance & Development and Academic
Affairs."

In the information presented below, we outline the
(actors which have been influential in determining these
recommendations While several factors have been taken
into account, the overall objective has been to establish
tuition rates which are
1) in keeping with national voluntary wage-price
guidelines;
2) consistent with the University's financial plans, and;
3) which, when offset by financial aid for those with
demonstrated financial need, keep Stanford economically
accessible to qualified applicants.
The first section addresses the wage-price guidelines
The second looks at financial planning considerations. The
third and fourth sections address respectively 1) research
and related questions in the area of undergraduate ad
missions, financial aid, and enrollment, and 2) Stanford's
current comparative positions with other institutions.
National Voluntary Wage-Price Guidelines
The Guidelines in respect to what a college or university
can charge its students in 1979-80 have two essential
components The first relates the increase in charges for
1979-80 to the increase in charges in the base period The
second further decelerates the increase in relation to the
degree to which 1979-80 wage increases will rise less fast
than did wage increases in the base period.
The Guidelines apply, then, to each college or university
(or other organization) in terms of that organization's recent
history, not in terms of a standard limit identically applicable
to all. The figure of 5 3 /< % which has been discussed as the
price guideline is an economy-wide average
We have found, in working to understand and then apply
the Guidelines to Stanford's 1979-80 needs and plgns, that
they raise serious conceptual and calculational difficulties.
We expect over the course of 1978-79 to be working with the
Guidelines and with successive interpretations and
refinements to calibrate price limitations appropriately
throughout the institution.
For purposes of tuition, room, and board, we have made
an effort in good faith to determine empirically and by
estimate the base period figures upon which the appropriate
price guidelines should be based In summary form, our
calculation takes the following course (with the base period
as the first quartersof fiscal years 1975-76 and 1977-78)

Weighted average of tuition, room, and
board increases over the base period 10 7%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10 2%
Weighted average of increases in wages and
nonmandatory benefits during base period 9 2%
Less comparable increase under guidelines
in 1979-80 7.0%
Difference 2.2%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Difference 1.7%'
Multiplied by fraction which compensation
is of appropriate operating expenditures .65
Wage decelerator 11%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10.2%
Less Wage decelerator 1.1%
Tuition, room, and board increase limit,
per guidelines 9 1%
Because this is an overall figure, the several separate
increases covered in this recommendation must fall under it
on a weighted average basis, rather than each one being
governed individually by a 9 1% limit thus, while the M.D.
tuition increases are above 9.1%, they are offset by the
weighted average of room and board (see below), which
comes to 8.2%.
The weighted average ol all the recommendations in
cluded in this action is 9.1%, a figure which is within the
Wage-Price Guidelines insofar as we have been able
adequately to understand and apply those Guidelines to
Stanford's recent past and present plans.
Financial Planning Considerations
In the iong-range financial forecast of a year ago, the
tuition element of income was assumed to grow at 2.9%
above inflation (the Consumer Price Index) in 1979-80. With
inflation currently projected in the neighborhood ol 8.0%
nationally, that assumption would have produced a tuition
increase of 10.9% Room and board rates might have grown
at a sorrv -hat lower rate, since the costs to be met have
components such as debt service, which are fixed or which
grow more slowly than the CPI.
With inflation as high as 8 0%, it is quite possible that we
would not have recommended converting the forecast
assumptions directly into budget plans But to set tuition
lower would have required lowering expenditure assump
tions as well Needless to say, the advent of Wage-Price
Guidelines mooted all speculation of the relation of those
assumptions to budget plans.
The aspects of the current long-range financial forecast
which press forcefully upon 1979-80 plans are those related
to inflation, to the decline of the dollar abroad, and in general
to that category o' expense we have called "con
solidations."
Consolidations are new budget requirements which are
at best only semidiscretionary, for example, those
associated with the aging of facilities and the consequent
heavier level of programmed maintenance and repair. These
expenses along with provision for a modest level of im
provement produce, we believe, strong arguments in sup
port of the recommended level of general tuition.
In the School of Medicine the unusually high tuition
recommendations come from the objective of restoring the
relationship between tuition and the cost of medical
education, (See box in first column.)
In 1972 the Institute of Medicine conducted a study of the
cost of medical education, citing the figure for Stanford at
$16,450 per student per year. In 1972-73 the tuition charged
each student for the typical load of 3.5 quarters was 21.6%
of the average annual cost per student. In 1978-79 that cost
is approximately $35,200, and tuition (again, for 3.5 quarters)
comes to 17.9% of the cost figure
Under the recommendations set forth here, M.D tuition
in 1979-80 will comprise approximately 21 % of the average
annual cost per student. The School, through a combination
of fellowship aid and loans, will be able to meet the
demonstrated financial need of medical students in 1979-80
Admissions and Financial Aid Considerations.
The undergraduate admissions process and the financial
aid policies of the University serve two separate and distinct
purposes The objective of the admissions process is to
admit the most able and qualified students. This decision is
made without regard to the financial circumstances of the
student or his or her family.
Once a student has been admitted, the objective of
financial aid policy is the reduction of economic barriers for
the student with financial need. By applying this policy and
meeting all demonstrated financial need, the University
makes possible initial access and continued enrollment
thereafter.

We examine the recommended tuition rate against
undergraduate admissions and financial aid obiectives to
insure, insofar as we can, that the rate will not be a
systematic barrier to attracting and enrolling an able and
qualified sutdent body
To check for evidence as to whether this objective is
being met, we have for a number of years monitored the
enrollment behavior of the incoming freshman class A
report for 1978-79 was prepared and included with the
November Board Agenda. In this background note, we touch
only on the highlights of that report
In looking at the results of the 1978-79 report,, we saw a
continuation of the significant patterns observed in earlier
years. The most significant difference was the increase in
the total applications, up approximately 10% in those who
begin the application process, and up by approximately 6%
(to 9,000) in those who complete the process and are, thus,
"actionable candidates." Looking at the choices made by
those individuals admitted to Stanford but electing to enroll
elsewhere, we saw this pattern

chose a given institution were these:

In terms of the relationship of enrollment percentages

significant differences from the patterns of prior years,
patterns which cause us to be neither alarmed nor com
placent.
In concluding, the report states:
Overall, this year's research has again pointed
to the continued strength of the applicant and
enrollment figures. In addition, most measures
have been shown to be quite stable and where
fluctuations have occurred, they have been
within familiar ranges. This continues to be
especially reassuring with regard to the high

While the major repair reserve balances will drop to
$17,000 at the end of the year 1979-80, the operating

expenses along with provision for a modest level of im
provement produce, we believe, strong arguments in sup
port of the recommended level of general tuition.
In the School of Medicine the unusually high tuition
recommendations come from the objective of restoring the
relationship between tuition and the cost of medical
education, (See box in first column.)
In 1972 the Institute of Medicine conducted a study of the
cost of medical education, citing the figure for Stanford at
$16,450 per student per year. In 1972-73 the tuition charged
each student for the typical load of 3.5 quarters was 21.6%
of the average annual cost per student. In 1978-79 that cost
is approximately $35,200, and tuition (again, for 3.5 quarters)
comes to 17.9% of the cost figure
Under the recommendations set forth here, M.D tuition
in 1979-80 will comprise approximately 21 % of the average
annual cost per student. The School, through a combination
of fellowship aid and loans, will be able to meet the
demonstrated financial need of medical students in 1979-80
Admissions and Financial Aid Considerations.
The undergraduate admissions process and the financial
aid policies of the University serve two separate and distinct
purposes The objective of the admissions process is to
admit the most able and qualified students. This decision is
made without regard to the financial circumstances of the
student or his or her family.
Once a student has been admitted, the objective of
financial aid policy is the reduction of economic barriers for
the student with financial need. By applying this policy and
meeting all demonstrated financial need, the University
makes possible initial access and continued enrollment
thereafter.

We examine the recommended tuition rate against
undergraduate admissions and financial aid obiectives to
insure, insofar as we can, that the rate will not be a
systematic barrier to attracting and enrolling an able and
qualified sutdent body
To check for evidence as to whether this objective is
being met, we have for a number of years monitored the
enrollment behavior of the incoming freshman class A
report for 1978-79 was prepared and included with the
November Board Agenda. In this background note, we touch
only on the highlights of that report
In looking at the results of the 1978-79 report,, we saw a
continuation of the significant patterns observed in earlier
years. The most significant difference was the increase in
the total applications, up approximately 10% in those who
begin the application process, and up by approximately 6%
(to 9,000) in those who complete the process and are, thus,
"actionable candidates." Looking at the choices made by
those individuals admitted to Stanford but electing to enroll
elsewhere, we saw this pattern

1976-77 76 24
1977-78 78 22
1978-79 77 23
The actual choices where 10 or more of those admittees
chose a given institution were these:

In terms of the relationship of enrollment percentages
and family economic circumstances, the report showed no
significant differences from the patterns of prior years,
patterns which cause us to be neither alarmed nor com
placent.
In concluding, the report states:
Overall, this year's research has again pointed
to the continued strength of the applicant and
enrollment figures. In addition, most measures
have been shown to be quite stable and where
fluctuations have occurred, they have been
within familiar ranges. This continues to be
especially reassuring with regard to the high
cost/financial aids question. Given the
stability in most factors, it seems important to
continue to maintain the sort of monitoring
which this report represents.
Two further aspects worth noting pertain to aid in
financing college costs First, as we noted last month, the
newly passed Middle-Income Student Assistance Act will
provide additional support to Stanford students and parents.
The Basic Opportunity grant provision raises the family
income limit from $15,000 to $25,000 The guaranteed
student loan program provides an interest subsidy with no
family-income limit, thus making available a significant form
of assistance to middle-income students arid their families.
Second, Stanford began in 1977 its own Parent Loan
Program, making loans for tuition, room, and board ex
penses available to parents at 8 3 /« % interest The use of that
program over the two years of its experience looks like this:
Parent Loan Plan
1977-78 1978-79
Number of Participants 116 121
Average annual loan amount $3,961 $4,750
Maximum loan available $6,000 $7,000

Median adjusted gross family
income $30-35,000 $35-40,000
Percent ot borrowers who chose
maximum annual loan 29% 34%
A questionnaire sent to 1977-78 participants elicited from
about half of the respondents the judgment that the PLP
made a significant difference in their financial ability to send
their sons or daughters to Stanford
Cost Comparisons with Other Institutions
In looking at where Stanford stands in relation to the sum
of tuition, mandatory fees, room, and board, we gathered
current-year information on the independent institutions
most often selected by students admitted here We did not
speculate about what those institutions might charge in
1979-80, since the applicability of wage-price guidelines is
expressed in terms of each one's individual history.

Establishment of Room and Board Rates for 1979-
80
That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the basic
rcom and board rate for the academic year 1979-80 be set at
$2,354, an increase of 8 5%, that the room rate be set at
$1,003, an increase of 7.7%, that the full board rate be set at
$1,351, an increase of 9 1%, and that the rates for specific
units be set within the pattern of these rates. Further, that
Escondido Village apartment rentals be increased by 7.7%.
Background:
Residences and Food Service- In December 1977 the
Board approved a 1978-79 basic room and board rate of
$2,169 The basic room rate was set at $931, (full-service
residence with University-operated kitchen) and the basic
board rate at $1,238. Room rates for the current year vary
from $888 (utilities included) in self-operated houses and
fraternity clusters to $1,040 in full-service residences with
self-operated kitchens.
For 1979-80 a basic rate of $2,354 is proposed, an in
crease of 8.5%. This consists of a basic room rate of $1,003,
a 7.7% increase, and a basic board rate of $1,351, a 9.1%
increase. All room and board rates for the various options
are expected to increase by 7 7% and 9.1 %, respectively.
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $213 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $277 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment. All apartments are furnished, and
utilities are provided Apartment rents for 1979-80 will be set
at from $229 per month for a one-bedroom apartment to
$298 per month for a four-bedroom apartment. Commencing
with academic year 1979-80, Escondido Village facilities and
finances will be integrated more closely with the total
residence system, in terms of assignment of spaces, use of
operating funds, and use of major repair funds.
The 8.5% increase in the combined room and board rate
affects 3,300 students—those who live in University
residences and are served by University food service. The
remaining 3,600 students living in University residences will
see an increase of just 7.7% in their room or apartment
costs. The weighted average of University-imposed in
creases on these 6,900 residents is an 8 2% rise in costs.
The proposed increases will enable the residences, food
services, and apartments to break even for 1979-80. Further,
the increases will permit an increase of $339,000 flowing to
the major repair reserves and a consequent acceleration in
major reoairs, particularly in the older residences.
Even at the increased level of allocation to the major
repair reserves, expenditures on major repairs for 1978-79
and 1979-80 will exceed the amounts flowing into the
reserves, and the reserves will be nearly depleted by the end
of fiscal year 1980 Consequently, the continuation of an
accelerated major repair program beyond 1980 will call for
further increases in allocations to the major repair reserves.
These statements are consistent with the assumptions of the
long-range forecast for housing presented to the Board of
Trustees at the November 1978 meeting.
While the major repair reserve balances will drop to
$17,000 at the end of the year 1979-80, the operating
reserves for the housing system will stand at approximately
$1,100,000 at that time.

Following is a background paper circulated to the
Board of Trustees recommending tuition and room and
board rates lor 1979-80'
In the two sections which follow, general tuition, room
and board rates (or 1979-80 aggregating an 8.9% increase
are recommended The general tuition is recommended to
increase 9 1% and basic room and board by 8.5% These
increases are consistent with the voluntary Wage-Price
Guidelines issued by President Carter on October 24, 1978
Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1979-80.
That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the general
tuition rate for the academic year 1979-80 be set at $5,595
($1,865 per regular quarter). Further, these committees
recommend approval to set tuition rates for entering M D
candidates at $6,873 ($2,291 per regular quarter); for
continuing M D candidates at $6,174 ($2,058 per regular
quarter); and for the School ol Law at $5,744 ($2,872 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1979-80
Background:
A comparison of the 1979-80 tuition recommendations is
as follows:
From To %
Type 1978-79 1979-80 Increase Increase
General
Tuition $5,130 $5,5595 $ 465 91%
Schl. of Medicine (M.D Program)

Students $5,388 $6,873 $1,485 27.6%
Continuing
Students $5,388 $6,174 $ 786 14 6%
School of
Law $5,280 $5,744 $ 464 8 8%

At their Dec. 12 meeting the Board of Trustees
voted "that tuition for 1979-80 in the Medical
School be set so as to meet the tuition objectives
proposed over a three-year period and that the
final formulation be ratified by the president of
the Board of Trustees, the president of the
University, and the heads of the trustee com
mittees on Finance & Development and Academic
Affairs."

In the information presented below, we outline the
(actors which have been influential in determining these
recommendations While several factors have been taken
into account, the overall objective has been to establish
tuition rates which are
1) in keeping with national voluntary wage-price
guidelines;
2) consistent with the University's financial plans, and;
3) which, when offset by financial aid for those with
demonstrated financial need, keep Stanford economically
accessible to qualified applicants.
The first section addresses the wage-price guidelines
The second looks at financial planning considerations. The
third and fourth sections address respectively 1) research
and related questions in the area of undergraduate ad
missions, financial aid, and enrollment, and 2) Stanford's
current comparative positions with other institutions.
National Voluntary Wage-Price Guidelines
The Guidelines in respect to what a college or university
can charge its students in 1979-80 have two essential
components The first relates the increase in charges for
1979-80 to the increase in charges in the base period The
second further decelerates the increase in relation to the
degree to which 1979-80 wage increases will rise less fast
than did wage increases in the base period.
The Guidelines apply, then, to each college or university
(or other organization) in terms of that organization's recent
history, not in terms of a standard limit identically applicable
to all. The figure of 5 3 /< % which has been discussed as the
price guideline is an economy-wide average
We have found, in working to understand and then apply
the Guidelines to Stanford's 1979-80 needs and plgns, that
they raise serious conceptual and calculational difficulties.
We expect over the course of 1978-79 to be working with the
Guidelines and with successive interpretations and
refinements to calibrate price limitations appropriately
throughout the institution.
For purposes of tuition, room, and board, we have made
an effort in good faith to determine empirically and by
estimate the base period figures upon which the appropriate
price guidelines should be based In summary form, our
calculation takes the following course (with the base period
as the first quartersof fiscal years 1975-76 and 1977-78)

Weighted average of tuition, room, and
board increases over the base period 10 7%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10 2%
Weighted average of increases in wages and
nonmandatory benefits during base period 9 2%
Less comparable increase under guidelines
in 1979-80 7.0%
Difference 2.2%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Difference 1.7%'
Multiplied by fraction which compensation
is of appropriate operating expenditures .65
Wage decelerator 11%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10.2%
Less Wage decelerator 1.1%
Tuition, room, and board increase limit,
per guidelines 9 1%
Because this is an overall figure, the several separate
increases covered in this recommendation must fall under it
on a weighted average basis, rather than each one being
governed individually by a 9 1% limit thus, while the M.D.
tuition increases are above 9.1%, they are offset by the
weighted average of room and board (see below), which
comes to 8.2%.
The weighted average ol all the recommendations in
cluded in this action is 9.1%, a figure which is within the
Wage-Price Guidelines insofar as we have been able
adequately to understand and apply those Guidelines to
Stanford's recent past and present plans.
Financial Planning Considerations
In the iong-range financial forecast of a year ago, the
tuition element of income was assumed to grow at 2.9%
above inflation (the Consumer Price Index) in 1979-80. With
inflation currently projected in the neighborhood ol 8.0%
nationally, that assumption would have produced a tuition
increase of 10.9% Room and board rates might have grown
at a sorrv -hat lower rate, since the costs to be met have
components such as debt service, which are fixed or which
grow more slowly than the CPI.
With inflation as high as 8 0%, it is quite possible that we
would not have recommended converting the forecast
assumptions directly into budget plans But to set tuition
lower would have required lowering expenditure assump
tions as well Needless to say, the advent of Wage-Price
Guidelines mooted all speculation of the relation of those
assumptions to budget plans.
The aspects of the current long-range financial forecast
which press forcefully upon 1979-80 plans are those related
to inflation, to the decline of the dollar abroad, and in general
to that category o' expense we have called "con
solidations."
Consolidations are new budget requirements which are
at best only semidiscretionary, for example, those
associated with the aging of facilities and the consequent
heavier level of programmed maintenance and repair. These
expenses along with provision for a modest level of im
provement produce, we believe, strong arguments in sup
port of the recommended level of general tuition.
In the School of Medicine the unusually high tuition
recommendations come from the objective of restoring the
relationship between tuition and the cost of medical
education, (See box in first column.)
In 1972 the Institute of Medicine conducted a study of the
cost of medical education, citing the figure for Stanford at
$16,450 per student per year. In 1972-73 the tuition charged
each student for the typical load of 3.5 quarters was 21.6%
of the average annual cost per student. In 1978-79 that cost
is approximately $35,200, and tuition (again, for 3.5 quarters)
comes to 17.9% of the cost figure
Under the recommendations set forth here, M.D tuition
in 1979-80 will comprise approximately 21 % of the average
annual cost per student. The School, through a combination
of fellowship aid and loans, will be able to meet the
demonstrated financial need of medical students in 1979-80
Admissions and Financial Aid Considerations.
The undergraduate admissions process and the financial
aid policies of the University serve two separate and distinct
purposes The objective of the admissions process is to
admit the most able and qualified students. This decision is
made without regard to the financial circumstances of the
student or his or her family.
Once a student has been admitted, the objective of
financial aid policy is the reduction of economic barriers for
the student with financial need. By applying this policy and
meeting all demonstrated financial need, the University
makes possible initial access and continued enrollment
thereafter.

We examine the recommended tuition rate against
undergraduate admissions and financial aid obiectives to
insure, insofar as we can, that the rate will not be a
systematic barrier to attracting and enrolling an able and
qualified sutdent body

continuation of the significant patterns observed in earlier
years. The most significant difference was the increase in
the total applications, up approximately 10% in those who
begin the application process, and up by approximately 6%

history, not in terms of a standard limit identically applicable
to all. The figure of 5 3 /< % which has been discussed as the
price guideline is an economy-wide average
We have found, in working to understand and then apply
the Guidelines to Stanford's 1979-80 needs and plgns, that
they raise serious conceptual and calculational difficulties.
We expect over the course of 1978-79 to be working with the
Guidelines and with successive interpretations and
refinements to calibrate price limitations appropriately
throughout the institution.
For purposes of tuition, room, and board, we have made
an effort in good faith to determine empirically and by
estimate the base period figures upon which the appropriate
price guidelines should be based In summary form, our
calculation takes the following course (with the base period
as the first quartersof fiscal years 1975-76 and 1977-78)

Weighted average of tuition, room, and
board increases over the base period 10 7%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10 2%
Weighted average of increases in wages and
nonmandatory benefits during base period 9 2%
Less comparable increase under guidelines
in 1979-80 7.0%
Difference 2.2%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Difference 1.7%'
Multiplied by fraction which compensation
is of appropriate operating expenditures .65
Wage decelerator 11%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10.2%
Less Wage decelerator 1.1%
Tuition, room, and board increase limit,
per guidelines 9 1%
Because this is an overall figure, the several separate
increases covered in this recommendation must fall under it
on a weighted average basis, rather than each one being
governed individually by a 9 1% limit thus, while the M.D.
tuition increases are above 9.1%, they are offset by the
weighted average of room and board (see below), which
comes to 8.2%.
The weighted average ol all the recommendations in
cluded in this action is 9.1%, a figure which is within the
Wage-Price Guidelines insofar as we have been able
adequately to understand and apply those Guidelines to
Stanford's recent past and present plans.
Financial Planning Considerations
In the iong-range financial forecast of a year ago, the
tuition element of income was assumed to grow at 2.9%
above inflation (the Consumer Price Index) in 1979-80. With
inflation currently projected in the neighborhood ol 8.0%
nationally, that assumption would have produced a tuition
increase of 10.9% Room and board rates might have grown
at a sorrv -hat lower rate, since the costs to be met have
components such as debt service, which are fixed or which
grow more slowly than the CPI.
With inflation as high as 8 0%, it is quite possible that we
would not have recommended converting the forecast
assumptions directly into budget plans But to set tuition
lower would have required lowering expenditure assump
tions as well Needless to say, the advent of Wage-Price
Guidelines mooted all speculation of the relation of those
assumptions to budget plans.
The aspects of the current long-range financial forecast
which press forcefully upon 1979-80 plans are those related
to inflation, to the decline of the dollar abroad, and in general
to that category o' expense we have called "con
solidations."
Consolidations are new budget requirements which are
at best only semidiscretionary, for example, those
associated with the aging of facilities and the consequent
heavier level of programmed maintenance and repair. These
expenses along with provision for a modest level of im
provement produce, we believe, strong arguments in sup
port of the recommended level of general tuition.
In the School of Medicine the unusually high tuition
recommendations come from the objective of restoring the
relationship between tuition and the cost of medical
education, (See box in first column.)
In 1972 the Institute of Medicine conducted a study of the
cost of medical education, citing the figure for Stanford at
$16,450 per student per year. In 1972-73 the tuition charged
each student for the typical load of 3.5 quarters was 21.6%
of the average annual cost per student. In 1978-79 that cost
is approximately $35,200, and tuition (again, for 3.5 quarters)
comes to 17.9% of the cost figure
Under the recommendations set forth here, M.D tuition
in 1979-80 will comprise approximately 21 % of the average
annual cost per student. The School, through a combination
of fellowship aid and loans, will be able to meet the
demonstrated financial need of medical students in 1979-80
Admissions and Financial Aid Considerations.
The undergraduate admissions process and the financial
aid policies of the University serve two separate and distinct
purposes The objective of the admissions process is to
admit the most able and qualified students. This decision is
made without regard to the financial circumstances of the
student or his or her family.
Once a student has been admitted, the objective of
financial aid policy is the reduction of economic barriers for
the student with financial need. By applying this policy and
meeting all demonstrated financial need, the University
makes possible initial access and continued enrollment
thereafter.

We examine the recommended tuition rate against
undergraduate admissions and financial aid obiectives to
insure, insofar as we can, that the rate will not be a
systematic barrier to attracting and enrolling an able and
qualified sutdent body
To check for evidence as to whether this objective is
being met, we have for a number of years monitored the
enrollment behavior of the incoming freshman class A
report for 1978-79 was prepared and included with the
November Board Agenda. In this background note, we touch
only on the highlights of that report
In looking at the results of the 1978-79 report,, we saw a
continuation of the significant patterns observed in earlier
years. The most significant difference was the increase in
the total applications, up approximately 10% in those who
begin the application process, and up by approximately 6%
(to 9,000) in those who complete the process and are, thus,
"actionable candidates." Looking at the choices made by
those individuals admitted to Stanford but electing to enroll
elsewhere, we saw this pattern
Enrollment Choices ol Admittees Enrolling Elsewhere

1972-73 75 25
1973-74 77 23

1975-76 80 20
1976-77 76 24
1977-78 78 22
1978-79 77 23
The actual choices where 10 or more of those admittees
chose a given institution were these:

U.S.C. 10

Georgetown 10
In terms of the relationship of enrollment percentages
and family economic circumstances, the report showed no
significant differences from the patterns of prior years,
patterns which cause us to be neither alarmed nor com
placent.
In concluding, the report states:
Overall, this year's research has again pointed
to the continued strength of the applicant and
enrollment figures. In addition, most measures
have been shown to be quite stable and where
fluctuations have occurred, they have been
within familiar ranges. This continues to be
especially reassuring with regard to the high
cost/financial aids question. Given the
stability in most factors, it seems important to
continue to maintain the sort of monitoring
which this report represents.
Two further aspects worth noting pertain to aid in
financing college costs First, as we noted last month, the
newly passed Middle-Income Student Assistance Act will
provide additional support to Stanford students and parents.
The Basic Opportunity grant provision raises the family
income limit from $15,000 to $25,000 The guaranteed
student loan program provides an interest subsidy with no
family-income limit, thus making available a significant form
of assistance to middle-income students arid their families.
Second, Stanford began in 1977 its own Parent Loan
Program, making loans for tuition, room, and board ex
penses available to parents at 8 3 /« % interest The use of that
program over the two years of its experience looks like this:
Parent Loan Plan
1977-78 1978-79
Number of Participants 116 121
Average annual loan amount $3,961 $4,750
Maximum loan available $6,000 $7,000

Median adjusted gross family
income $30-35,000 $35-40,000
Percent ot borrowers who chose
maximum annual loan 29% 34%
A questionnaire sent to 1977-78 participants elicited from
about half of the respondents the judgment that the PLP
made a significant difference in their financial ability to send
their sons or daughters to Stanford
Cost Comparisons with Other Institutions
In looking at where Stanford stands in relation to the sum
of tuition, mandatory fees, room, and board, we gathered
current-year information on the independent institutions
most often selected by students admitted here We did not
speculate about what those institutions might charge in
1979-80, since the applicability of wage-price guidelines is
expressed in terms of each one's individual history.

Establishment of Room and Board Rates for 1979-
80
That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the basic
rcom and board rate for the academic year 1979-80 be set at
$2,354, an increase of 8 5%, that the room rate be set at
$1,003, an increase of 7.7%, that the full board rate be set at
$1,351, an increase of 9 1%, and that the rates for specific
units be set within the pattern of these rates. Further, that
Escondido Village apartment rentals be increased by 7.7%.
Background:
Residences and Food Service- In December 1977 the
Board approved a 1978-79 basic room and board rate of
$2,169 The basic room rate was set at $931, (full-service
residence with University-operated kitchen) and the basic
board rate at $1,238. Room rates for the current year vary
from $888 (utilities included) in self-operated houses and
fraternity clusters to $1,040 in full-service residences with
self-operated kitchens.
For 1979-80 a basic rate of $2,354 is proposed, an in
crease of 8.5%. This consists of a basic room rate of $1,003,
a 7.7% increase, and a basic board rate of $1,351, a 9.1%
increase. All room and board rates for the various options
are expected to increase by 7 7% and 9.1 %, respectively.
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $213 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $277 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment. All apartments are furnished, and
utilities are provided Apartment rents for 1979-80 will be set
at from $229 per month for a one-bedroom apartment to
$298 per month for a four-bedroom apartment. Commencing
with academic year 1979-80, Escondido Village facilities and
finances will be integrated more closely with the total
residence system, in terms of assignment of spaces, use of
operating funds, and use of major repair funds.
The 8.5% increase in the combined room and board rate
affects 3,300 students—those who live in University
residences and are served by University food service. The
remaining 3,600 students living in University residences will
see an increase of just 7.7% in their room or apartment
costs. The weighted average of University-imposed in
creases on these 6,900 residents is an 8 2% rise in costs.
The proposed increases will enable the residences, food
services, and apartments to break even for 1979-80. Further,
the increases will permit an increase of $339,000 flowing to
the major repair reserves and a consequent acceleration in
major reoairs, particularly in the older residences.
Even at the increased level of allocation to the major
repair reserves, expenditures on major repairs for 1978-79
and 1979-80 will exceed the amounts flowing into the
reserves, and the reserves will be nearly depleted by the end
of fiscal year 1980 Consequently, the continuation of an
accelerated major repair program beyond 1980 will call for
further increases in allocations to the major repair reserves.
These statements are consistent with the assumptions of the
long-range forecast for housing presented to the Board of
Trustees at the November 1978 meeting.
While the major repair reserve balances will drop to
$17,000 at the end of the year 1979-80, the operating
reserves for the housing system will stand at approximately
$1,100,000 at that time.

Following is a background paper circulated to the
Board of Trustees recommending tuition and room and
board rates lor 1979-80'
In the two sections which follow, general tuition, room
and board rates (or 1979-80 aggregating an 8.9% increase
are recommended The general tuition is recommended to
increase 9 1% and basic room and board by 8.5% These
increases are consistent with the voluntary Wage-Price
Guidelines issued by President Carter on October 24, 1978
Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1979-80.
That the Committee on Finance and Development and
the Committee on Academic Affairs recommend the general
tuition rate for the academic year 1979-80 be set at $5,595
($1,865 per regular quarter). Further, these committees
recommend approval to set tuition rates for entering M D
candidates at $6,873 ($2,291 per regular quarter); for
continuing M D candidates at $6,174 ($2,058 per regular
quarter); and for the School ol Law at $5,744 ($2,872 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1979-80
Background:
A comparison of the 1979-80 tuition recommendations is
as follows:
From To %
Type 1978-79 1979-80 Increase Increase
General
Tuition $5,130 $5,5595 $ 465 91%
Schl. of Medicine (M.D Program)
Entering
Students $5,388 $6,873 $1,485 27.6%
Continuing
Students $5,388 $6,174 $ 786 14 6%
School of
Law $5,280 $5,744 $ 464 8 8%

At their Dec. 12 meeting the Board of Trustees
voted "that tuition for 1979-80 in the Medical
School be set so as to meet the tuition objectives
proposed over a three-year period and that the
final formulation be ratified by the president of
the Board of Trustees, the president of the
University, and the heads of the trustee com
mittees on Finance & Development and Academic
Affairs."

In the information presented below, we outline the
(actors which have been influential in determining these
recommendations While several factors have been taken
into account, the overall objective has been to establish
tuition rates which are
1) in keeping with national voluntary wage-price
guidelines;
2) consistent with the University's financial plans, and;
3) which, when offset by financial aid for those with
demonstrated financial need, keep Stanford economically
accessible to qualified applicants.
The first section addresses the wage-price guidelines
The second looks at financial planning considerations. The
third and fourth sections address respectively 1) research
and related questions in the area of undergraduate ad
missions, financial aid, and enrollment, and 2) Stanford's
current comparative positions with other institutions.
National Voluntary Wage-Price Guidelines
The Guidelines in respect to what a college or university
can charge its students in 1979-80 have two essential
components The first relates the increase in charges for
1979-80 to the increase in charges in the base period The
second further decelerates the increase in relation to the
degree to which 1979-80 wage increases will rise less fast
than did wage increases in the base period.
The Guidelines apply, then, to each college or university
(or other organization) in terms of that organization's recent
history, not in terms of a standard limit identically applicable
to all. The figure of 5 3 /< % which has been discussed as the
price guideline is an economy-wide average
We have found, in working to understand and then apply
the Guidelines to Stanford's 1979-80 needs and plgns, that
they raise serious conceptual and calculational difficulties.
We expect over the course of 1978-79 to be working with the
Guidelines and with successive interpretations and
refinements to calibrate price limitations appropriately
throughout the institution.
For purposes of tuition, room, and board, we have made
an effort in good faith to determine empirically and by
estimate the base period figures upon which the appropriate
price guidelines should be based In summary form, our
calculation takes the following course (with the base period
as the first quartersof fiscal years 1975-76 and 1977-78)

Weighted average of tuition, room, and
board increases over the base period 10 7%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10 2%
Weighted average of increases in wages and
nonmandatory benefits during base period 9 2%
Less comparable increase under guidelines
in 1979-80 7.0%
Difference 2.2%
Less constant from national formula 0.5%
Difference 1.7%'
Multiplied by fraction which compensation
is of appropriate operating expenditures .65
Wage decelerator 11%
Price guideline before wage decelerator 10.2%
Less Wage decelerator 1.1%
Tuition, room, and board increase limit,
per guidelines 9 1%
Because this is an overall figure, the several separate
increases covered in this recommendation must fall under it
on a weighted average basis, rather than each one being
governed individually by a 9 1% limit thus, while the M.D.
tuition increases are above 9.1%, they are offset by the
weighted average of room and board (see below), which
comes to 8.2%.
The weighted average ol all the recommendations in
cluded in this action is 9.1%, a figure which is within the
Wage-Price Guidelines insofar as we have been able
adequately to understand and apply those Guidelines to
Stanford's recent past and present plans.
Financial Planning Considerations

tuition element of income was assumed to grow at 2.9%
above inflation (the Consumer Price Index) in 1979-80. With
inflation currently projected in the neighborhood ol 8.0%

increase of 10.9% Room and board rates might have grown

Under the recommendations set forth here, M.D tuition
in 1979-80 will comprise approximately 21 % of the average

of fellowship aid and loans, will be able to meet the
demonstrated financial need of medical students in 1979-80

Establishment of Room and Board Rates for 1979-

That the Committee on Finance and Development and

$2,354, an increase of 8 5%, that the room rate be set at
$1,003, an increase of 7.7%, that the full board rate be set at
$1,351, an increase of 9 1%, and that the rates for specific
units be set within the pattern of these rates. Further, that
Escondido Village apartment rentals be increased by 7.7%.
Background:
Residences and Food Service- In December 1977 the
Board approved a 1978-79 basic room and board rate of
$2,169 The basic room rate was set at $931, (full-service
residence with University-operated kitchen) and the basic
board rate at $1,238. Room rates for the current year vary
from $888 (utilities included) in self-operated houses and
fraternity clusters to $1,040 in full-service residences with
self-operated kitchens.
For 1979-80 a basic rate of $2,354 is proposed, an in
crease of 8.5%. This consists of a basic room rate of $1,003,
a 7.7% increase, and a basic board rate of $1,351, a 9.1%
increase. All room and board rates for the various options
are expected to increase by 7 7% and 9.1 %, respectively.
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $213 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $277 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment. All apartments are furnished, and
utilities are provided Apartment rents for 1979-80 will be set
at from $229 per month for a one-bedroom apartment to
$298 per month for a four-bedroom apartment. Commencing
with academic year 1979-80, Escondido Village facilities and
finances will be integrated more closely with the total
residence system, in terms of assignment of spaces, use of
operating funds, and use of major repair funds.
The 8.5% increase in the combined room and board rate
affects 3,300 students—those who live in University
residences and are served by University food service. The
remaining 3,600 students living in University residences will
see an increase of just 7.7% in their room or apartment
costs. The weighted average of University-imposed in
creases on these 6,900 residents is an 8 2% rise in costs.
The proposed increases will enable the residences, food
services, and apartments to break even for 1979-80. Further,
the increases will permit an increase of $339,000 flowing to
the major repair reserves and a consequent acceleration in
major reoairs, particularly in the older residences.
Even at the increased level of allocation to the major
repair reserves, expenditures on major repairs for 1978-79
and 1979-80 will exceed the amounts flowing into the
reserves, and the reserves will be nearly depleted by the end
of fiscal year 1980 Consequently, the continuation of an
accelerated major repair program beyond 1980 will call for
further increases in allocations to the major repair reserves.
These statements are consistent with the assumptions of the
long-range forecast for housing presented to the Board of
Trustees at the November 1978 meeting.
While the major repair reserve balances will drop to
$17,000 at the end of the year 1979-80, the operating
reserves for the housing system will stand at approximately
$1,100,000 at that time.
