# Children's TV shows pushing sex?
## Critics debate program quality 
### Associated Press 
The father of a kindergarten student
who donated a turtle to his daughter's
class told the youngsters not to squeeze it
too tightly because it might hurt. The class
named the turtle "Charmin."

garten children were asked which they
preferred, television or daddy, 44 percent
answered television.

What's a parent to do?
Those who seem to know say television
is sucking enthusiasm and imagination
from the minds of the nation's youngsters.
The studies show violence is down, but
sex is up.
And commercials? Consider the recent
yuletide barrage of TV spots for bleeping,
blinking space toys "batteries not in
cluded." Or the kids' cartoon heroes who
are forever pushing sugar-coated cereals.

Is that really any way to start your day?
nutritionists ask.
Although broadcasters are beginning to
show at least some concern about what
they put on the air for youngsters, the de
bate over kids and the tube rages on.
Some critics say the medium itself is bad
and advocate turning off the set for good.
They cite excessive TV viewing as the
major factor behind a national slump in
reading skills and test scores. Others say
we should strive to harness the "beast,"
limiting its use through increased parental
control and putting its powerful inflence
to work in the classroom.
But the loudest voices in the debate over
children's television seem to be coming
from those who feel broadcasters simply
are not providing enough quality prog
ramming on morning and afternoon
schedules when children watch the most
televisiorf. There are too many reruns of
"Cilligan's Island" and" "Road Runner,"
they say, and not enough programs of the
ABC "Afterschool Special" genre.
These critics also feel there is too much
sex and violence during the evening prime
time period, when studies show most
children watch their favorite programs.

And many experts, including the inf
luential Action for Children's Television
(ACT) group, would like to see a limit or
complete ban placed on certain kinds of
kiddy advertising — for products like
those sugary cereals and other food items
consumerists say are of little nutritional
value.
The Federal Trade Commission is col
lecting data on an advertising ban prop
osed by ACT and hearings on the issue are
scheduled to start in January in San Fran
cisco.
The Federal Communications Commis
sion, meanwhile, is gathering evidence on
whether current voluntary standards gov
erning children's programming should be
revised or made mandatory.
The commission is asking parents and
others about the quantitiy, quality and var
iety of children's programs and commer
cials on their local stations.
But despite efforts to improve what's av
ailable, no one working in the children's
television field expects to completely
change the nature of the tube overnight.
And even when a better mix of programs is
aired, they realize there will always be car
toons and commericals.
