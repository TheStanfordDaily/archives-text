'Home birth' in a hospital
A Saudi Arabian prince donated funds for some of the renovations which transformed two rooms
on the University Hospital's third floor into family birth rooms. Here, a couple awaits the birth of
their child in one of the rooms. The family birth areas are available for any woman who wishes to
give birth with her family and friends around her, and whose doctor doesn't anticipate any
complications. If a child is born at home without medical equipment nearby, serious complica
tions cannot be handled as efficiently, as they can in a hospital setting, said a community
obstetrician.
