## Alex Alben 'Honorable profession'

An honest politician is one who, when he is
bought, will stay bought.
-Simon Cameron
Politicians are like the bones of a horse's
foreshoulder - not a straight one in it.
-Wendell Phillips
I am not a politician, and my other habits are
good.
-Artemus Ward
People don't like politicians. They haven't
liked politicians throughout history. They do
not like them today.
Yet, with full awareness of the state of poli
tics today — of the ethics investigations, of
the scandals, of the pervasive influence of
lobbies — voters return incumbents to office
nine times out of 10.
This paradox persists because, while the
voters feel that Rep. Smith is a good guy, they
also believe that the rest of Congress is full of
lazy, inept 5.0.8.'5. And Rep. Smith does
nothing to alter this perception. When most
congressmen successfully run against Con
gress as an institution, should it be a surprise
that confidence in Congress erodes?
It is no secret that voters are disaffected: 60
percent of eligible voters chose to stay at
home in the recent mid-term election. Yet, I
do not think that a disgust with politicians as a
group is a sufficient explanation for voter dis
satisfaction. I suggest that voters don't go to
the polls because they believe that the prob
lems facing America today are so intractable,
and seem so remote from the electoral pro
cess.
Inflation is the prime example. People feel
the bite of inflation whether they go to the
supermarket or to buy a car or try to pay for
the cost of a college education.
Yet what leader has proposed a solution to
escalating prices, which does not risk reces
sion or require extreme government inter
vention? No one. If a solution existed, the
best minds of the business community, the
universities and the government would have
arrived long ago.
A host of other issues seem to defy solution
or even crisis management. Take crime. Is
there anyone who has produced a reasona
ble plan for rehabilitation of hardened crimi
nals? Have we even begun to move in the
direction of eliminating the environmental
conditions that cause thousands of Ameri
cans to strike out violently against their soci
ety?
I began with some critical words for politi
cians and politics as a profession, criticism
that I feel reflects the public's general mood.
Yet I have shifted to a discussion of the appa
rent insolubility of the problems that con
front the nation.
The clear link between a public, dissatis
fied with its leaders as a group, and a public
which believes that its leaders cannot cope
with essential problems, is the electoral pro
cess. In an election, a politician creates an
expectation that he can accomplish some
thing. Yet today's elections don't serve to
inform the public about what can realistically
be accomplished and what can't.
James Reston noted over 10 years ago,
"Elections almost always emphasize the
worst. They exaggerate everything, including
our national weakness for overstatement,
and in the process they distort what they are
supposed to clarify."
The tone of elections today is alarmingly
negative. It seems to be much more success
ful to shout, "Don't vote for |oe! He's a
loser! " than to say, "Vote for me because of
my stands on the issues."
This negative politics is underscored by the
plethora of single-issue constituencies.
People have become so frustrated with the
lack of movement on the major issues facing
the nation, they are willing to derive satisfac

tion from victories on narrow, self-defined
causes.
In his speech a few weeks ago here, Sen.
John Culver gave a straightforward and
eloquent analysis of the challenge lobbies
pose to representative government: "The
worth of every public servant is measured by
a single litmus test of ideological purity.
Taken together, the tests are virtually im
passable for any officeholder who hopes to
keep both his conscience and his consti
tuency."
The money that lobbies pour into elections
and the voices of politicians who are only
interested in getting re-elected, serve to
obscure the real issues in an election. The
influence of mass media, especially televi
sion, which elevates personality above is
sues, compounds the problem.
It would be easy to conclude that the pub
lic has a right to turn off, because politics is a*
dirty game, elections are a sham and the
leaders which we get are elected for all the
wrong reasons.
In a sense, that conclusion is accurate, for
apathy rules the day. Yet, I can't accept that as
a final answer. While we may be unhappy
with our leaders or with the electoral pro
cess, the problems remain. Charles DeCaulle
once said that, "Politics are too serious a mat
ter to be left to the politicians." What he
meant was that genuine problems can't be
soived by people with purely political mo
tives.
If we are to talk about the crying need for
social commitment and an end to the "Me
First!" politics of the current year; if we are to
begin to improve the lives of people who live
in the inner cities of our nation; if we are to
develop an approach to the energy crisis
which both increases production and is fair
to the consumer; if we are to put a cap on an
insane arms race and feel confidence in our
defense; then we need politicians more than
ever.
Like it or not, these problems will be ad
dressed by politicians. The public must keep
them honest, elect the right people, get in
volved in the fight. For a moment, we must
suspend our automatic disdain for politicians
and give government a chance to work.
The public's adversary attitude towards
politicians came home to me when I ran for
the ASSU Senate. The issues in the senate are
not earthshaking, but they affect life here in
small ways. I ran for senate because I was
interested in a set of issues. Yet the question
that was asked most frequently of me in the
campaign was, "You're running so that you
can get into law school, aren't you?" The
presumption was that anyone who ran for
office was running solely to promote himself,
that he was necessarily arrogant and egocen
tric.
I won't deny that running for office is an
ego trip. You have to sell yourself. You have
to say why you're the best man for the job.
But a candidacy involves issues as well as
personality. The public should concentrate
on issues and consider those facets of per
sonality such as imagination and integrity
that are essential for public officials.
If voters continue to be apathetic, then
they will get what they deserve; boring, self
serving, corrupt politicians.
If the electorate were more demanding,
selective and involved, then it would get
leaders who were competent to handle the
realistic agenda of issues.
When that time comes to pass, perhaps
politics will be considered — as Robert Ken
nedy was fond of saying — "an honorable
profession."
