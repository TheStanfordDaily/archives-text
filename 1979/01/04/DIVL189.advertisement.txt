PHOTOGS
Are you tired of dull, drab
photos in the pages of the Daily?
Well, put your creativity to work,
and join us! We're not asking for
much. Only a few hours of your
time - when you can spare it.
We'll even train you in processing
and printing. No the pay isn't any
thing to write home about, but
we think it's the best day-to-day
experience opportunity around.
Give us a try. We're holding a
special meeting just for photo
graphers Friday at 12:30 p.m. at
the Daily office.
