You all know the Daily as Stanford's most read
formation source, and, of course, our primary
nction is to try to report the news, every
eekday, accurately, concisely and objectively.
But the Daily is so much more. You see, the
j/7y is a group of people, not just an institution.
e're a group of students learning how a "real''
?wsp aper is run — from photo cropping to
>rporate balance sheets. We're an independent
iucational corporation with annual revenues
iproaching $400,000. We're an honest-to-God
?wspaper with a daily circulation of 16,000.
e're a proving ground for aspiring journalists.
, ... e're an activity which makes Stanford more than
mm just a place to attend classes. We're a social group.
We're a bunch of friends.
And we're growing. Our papers this year have I
been 28 percent larger on the average than last .7^*
year while our advertising/copy ratio has A*" 3 !
remained essentially constant. That means our l
I papers; this year are filled with more news,
M features, sports, entertainment and photographs.
And that means our staff is more hard pressed I
|k : V 3 1 . I'M
than ever to turn out quality stories on interesting |.%
subjects. That's a real problem. flpfp
Ever y department here has a constant staffing %*{sss
problem. We sometimes have to hold important * y • |
stories for publication. We sometimes miss that
photograph which could make the front page
really stellar. All because we couldn't find
someone to do the work.
? rtj.: \\ We understand. We're students too. People
have exams, papers and homework assignments
which severely reduce their free time.
The solution is simple: we need you! No, we
aren't asking you for4o, or even 10, hours a week.
E v '*rY} Just a!• ittle time. Maybe an occasional article. Or a
page layout. Or a simple photograph. If everyone
pitches in, everyone's portion is reduced.
It's simple. We need you for as much or as little
as Y ou c an spare. ■!
3 We II train you — no experience is necessary. i
What could be simpler?
t • The rewards? Well, we might pay you a little
J money. But we promise you won't get rich with
us - So it's better that you join us with higher
motives. At the Daily you'll find friendship, F
instruction and satisfaction in knowing you're •
helping the community become more informed.
1 We can't promise that you'll like the Daily; we I
can't promise you won't. But we can promise that
you'll never know unless you give us a try. We're
holding new staffer meetings tomorrow at 2 p.m.
anc ' next Monday at 1 p.m. If you are a
photographer, there will be a special meeting
tomorrow at 12:30 p.m.
