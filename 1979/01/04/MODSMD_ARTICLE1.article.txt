# Committee of local, faculty doctors to talk
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
A liaison committee composed of
University faculty physicians and
doctors from the Palo Alto commun
ity will meet for the first time this
month in efforts to ease tensions be
tween the University and Palo Alto.
Strained relations between the
University and community doctors
reached a head in August when the
Hospital board of directors voted for
a closed-staff policy which restricts
some specialized laboratories and
hospital-based clinical services for
faculty use only.
The Palo Alto Times reported last
week that officials here are consider
ing separating the Hospital from the
Medical Center to resolve the prob
lems between the University and
community physicians.
However, President Richard
Lyman only confirmed that the or
ganizational structure would be part
of a broad study of problems and said
it was "vastly premature" to say that a
Hospital-Medical Center split would
occur.
The debate over the University's
obligation to community physicians
stems from a 1968 contract between
the University and Palo Alto. At that
time, Stanford purchased Palo Alto's
holdings in the Hospital and provi
sions were made regarding the com
position and privileges of the medi
cal staff.
Although the liaison committee
will develop an "early focus" on
these contractual provisions and
their relation to the board's closed
staff policy, Deputy Dean Lawrence
Crowley said he hopes the commit
tee will "broaden" its discussions "to
include all relevant aspects of the re
lationship."
Crowley said the committee's
overall goal is to "review and make
appropriate recommendations re
garding the relationship of the
School of Medicine — in particular
its overall educational program —
with the community physicians prac
ticing at Stanford University Hospi
tal."
He added that most of the com
munity physicians already participate
in the educational programs of the
Med School.
Only 41 of the 550 community
physicians on the medical staff may
still use the clinics because the 1968
contract exempted them from the
August ruling.
The closed-staff policy has
triggered the formation of Commun
ity Physicians for Patient Care, a
group of about 150 local doctors de
termined to keep the Hospital a
community facility. Five members of
this group, including chairman David
Cooney, have been included in the
liaison committee.
At the first meeting of the physi
cian's group, held earlier this year,
Cooney said doctors were being cut
off from discovering the new
techniques of medicine.
The closed-staff rule therefore
"diminishes the patient's freedom of
choice" of physicians and creates "a
monopoly on medical care for the
Hospital," he said.
The Hospital board deemed the
closed-staff rule "essential to the
successful research and teaching
missions of the School of Medicine."
