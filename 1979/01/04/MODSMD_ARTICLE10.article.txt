Middle Eastern
studies
I read with great interest
your story about the formation
of the Stanford Middle East
Studies Club by a group of stu
dents (Daily, Dec. 1), and I wel
come this expression of in
terest in the Middle East. I wish
to correct a false impression
which may have been left by
the article and to suggest fruit
ful ways to work toward enlarg
ing the number of course offer
ings in an area which is impor
tant from a variety of points of
view.
It is not quite accurate to
state that the only course of
fered in the area of Middle East
is "The Ottoman Empire" in
the History Department. Re
ligious Studies offers a number
of courses on the Ancient,
Medieval and Modern religion
and culture of the Near and
Middle East. In addition, this
year the Linguistics Depart
ment is offering Elementary
and Intermediate Arabic as

well as Elementary Hebrew.
But here is the rub. Inter
mediate Hebrew is not being
offered because of a lack of
funds, although there is
marked student interest in
such a course. The fate of
Arabic as well is hanging by the
thread of the accidental availa
bility of funds.
SMESC could well employ its
energies by trying to present a
well-rounded series of talks on
Middle Eastern topics in order
to gauge student interest and
to generate departmental con
cern for hiring faculty with an
interest in Middle Eastern to
pics. It seems obvious that
there is a need here for addi
tional regular members of the
faculty interested in the Middle
East in history, sociology, polit
ical science and linguistics.
Evidence of student interest
might serve to focus de
partmental attention on this
area.

Historical myopia
I would like to respond to
the emotional, uninformed
reaction of Sloane Citron
(Daily, Nov. 30) to the article by
Andrei Amalrik on the situation
of the Soviet lews (Daily, Nov.
28).
The issue of human rights in
the USSR is universal, not
primarily Jewish. Amalrik's re
marks were not directed
against the attempts of Soviet
lews to emigrate. He merely
indicated that the question of
Jewish emigration is only one
aspect of the struggle for
human rights in the Soviet Un
ion.
Sonya Slepak, who spoke
here on the persecution of
Jews in the USSR, failed even to
mention the plight of other
Soviet minorities (such as the
hundreds of thousands of Cri
mean Tartars, or the more than
two million Volga Deutsch). He
thereby drew for the Stanford
students a simplified and dis
torted picture of the real

struggle for freedom in the
Soviet Union. Political efforts
in defense of universal human
rights are easily misdirected
when they spring from beliefs
based on ethnic exclusivity.
It is to be regretted that Cit
ron did not care to familiarize
himself more thoroughly with
the real history of human ac
tions during World War 11. His
view of the treatment of Jews
by non-)ews in those catas
trophic years is derived
second-hand from his father's
single (but, of course, not sin
gular) experience. It is all too
easy to generalize inaccurately
when life and emotions are at
stake.
I am also part Jewish; all
members of my family paid
with their lives for their origin.
Yet I would be committing an
immoral act of injustice if I al
lowed my opinion of the help
given to the Jews by numerous
Europeansofall nationalities to
be of Citron's color. The help
given was of the highest caliber
of human courage. It was of

fered selflessly and with indi
vidual compassion for suffer
ing fellow humans, in spite of
the fact that the Nazis re
warded all such acts with death
if discovered.
It is painful to see that we
who live in relatively peaceful
times still cannot learn objec
tively from the dramatic events
of more than a generation ago,
and that there are among us
those who single-mindedly
place emphasis on "Jews hav
ing no one else to turn to ex
cept their fellow Jews."
Yet anyone interested in the
more complex truth of history
need only consult the holdings
of the Hoover Library, which
has an impressive amount of
documentation on the self
sacrificing help given to the
Jews by others during the
Holocaust. I think this would
be a good way to begin to
counteract the emotionality
that results from historical
myopia.

Jews defend
dissidents
I read with interest Andrei
Amalrik's column {Daily, Nov.
28), entitled, "Dissident Rus
sian Author Views Two Stan
ford Rallies." Amalrik was ap
parently unaware of several
things regarding the Jewish
role in defending various dis
sidents.
When I went to Moscow in
October 1975, I visited Dr. An
drei Sakharov and discussed
our mutual problems. In fact, a
colleague and I were privileged
to bring Sakharov the London
Times newspaper in which his
winning of the Nobel Peace
Prize was announced. Later, I
traveled to Siena, Italy, to
spend time with his wife Elena
Bonner and gathered advice
and messages from herand her
husband for dealing with our
mutual problems in the Soviet
Union. Last year, another Bay
Area Council on Soviet Jewry
member was vitally instrumen
tal in relating messages from

Bonner in Siena to Sakharov in
Moscow which resulted in the
Sakharov hearings in Rome. At
one point, we held a mass de
monstration at the Soviet Con
sulate on behalf of Sakharov,
hundreds of people protested
with us â€” most of them Jewish.
In other connections, we
have held vigils and demonst
rations at the Soviet Consulate
on behalf of Alexander Sol
zhenitsyn as well as his priest
confessor, Father Dmitri
Dudko. We sponsored public
protests for Valentin Moroz
and Pyotr Grigirenko. More re
cently, we organized and
sponsored a speech by Vla
dimir Bukovsky to over 125
doctors at the Mount /ion
Hospital (a Jewish hospital) on
the subject of psychiatric
abuse in the USSR.
We have repeatedly ap
proached the Russian Or
thodox community in San
Francisco, as well as the Bap

tists and Pentecostal Christ
ians, in an attempt to interest
them in the fate of their fellow
religionists in the USSR. The
answer was uniformly, "We
shall pray for them." Our pleas
for social demonstrative action
fell on deaf ears.
We are extremely concerned
about the human rights viola
tions in the Soviet Union. Our
resources, however, restrict us
by necessity to working on one
issue: freedom of emigration.
But we frequently refer other
human rights violations to such
organizations as Amnesty In
ternational and we cooperate
with them as extensively as we
are able. We are frustrated by
the fact that there are no non-
Jewish organizations, except
the Ukrainians, working for
human rights in the USSR.

the real history of human ac
tions during World War 11. His
view of the treatment of Jews
by non-)ews in those catas
trophic years is derived
second-hand from his father's
single (but, of course, not sin
gular) experience. It is all too
easy to generalize inaccurately
when life and emotions are at
stake.
I am also part Jewish; all
members of my family paid

Yet I would be committing an
immoral act of injustice if I al

be of Citron's color. The help

fered selflessly and with indi
vidual compassion for suffer
ing fellow humans, in spite of
the fact that the Nazis re
warded all such acts with death

It is painful to see that we

Jews defend
dissidents
I read with interest Andrei
Amalrik's column {Daily, Nov.
28), entitled, "Dissident Rus
sian Author Views Two Stan
ford Rallies." Amalrik was ap
parently unaware of several
things regarding the Jewish
role in defending various dis
sidents.
When I went to Moscow in
October 1975, I visited Dr. An
drei Sakharov and discussed
our mutual problems. In fact, a
colleague and I were privileged
to bring Sakharov the London
Times newspaper in which his
winning of the Nobel Peace
Prize was announced. Later, I
traveled to Siena, Italy, to
spend time with his wife Elena
Bonner and gathered advice
and messages from herand her
husband for dealing with our
mutual problems in the Soviet
Union. Last year, another Bay
Area Council on Soviet Jewry
member was vitally instrumen
tal in relating messages from

Bonner in Siena to Sakharov in
Moscow which resulted in the
Sakharov hearings in Rome. At
one point, we held a mass de
monstration at the Soviet Con
sulate on behalf of Sakharov,
hundreds of people protested
with us â€” most of them Jewish.
In other connections, we
have held vigils and demonst
rations at the Soviet Consulate
on behalf of Alexander Sol
zhenitsyn as well as his priest
confessor, Father Dmitri
Dudko. We sponsored public
protests for Valentin Moroz
and Pyotr Grigirenko. More re
cently, we organized and
sponsored a speech by Vla
dimir Bukovsky to over 125
doctors at the Mount /ion
Hospital (a Jewish hospital) on
the subject of psychiatric
abuse in the USSR.
We have repeatedly ap
proached the Russian Or
thodox community in San
Francisco, as well as the Bap

tists and Pentecostal Christ
ians, in an attempt to interest
them in the fate of their fellow
religionists in the USSR. The
answer was uniformly, "We
shall pray for them." Our pleas
for social demonstrative action
fell on deaf ears.
We are extremely concerned
about the human rights viola
tions in the Soviet Union. Our
resources, however, restrict us
by necessity to working on one
issue: freedom of emigration.
But we frequently refer other
human rights violations to such
organizations as Amnesty In
ternational and we cooperate
with them as extensively as we
are able. We are frustrated by
the fact that there are no non-
Jewish organizations, except
the Ukrainians, working for
human rights in the USSR.

to correct a false impression
which may have been left by
the article and to suggest fruit

It is not quite accurate to

of courses on the Ancient,

Middle East. In addition, this
year the Linguistics Depart
ment is offering Elementary

well as Elementary Hebrew.
But here is the rub. Inter
mediate Hebrew is not being
offered because of a lack of
funds, although there is
marked student interest in
such a course. The fate of
Arabic as well is hanging by the
thread of the accidental availa

SMESC could well employ its

to generate departmental con

Historical myopia
I would like to respond to
the emotional, uninformed
reaction of Sloane Citron
(Daily, Nov. 30) to the article by
Andrei Amalrik on the situation
of the Soviet lews (Daily, Nov.
28).
The issue of human rights in
the USSR is universal, not
primarily Jewish. Amalrik's re
marks were not directed
against the attempts of Soviet
lews to emigrate. He merely
indicated that the question of
Jewish emigration is only one
aspect of the struggle for
human rights in the Soviet Un
ion.
Sonya Slepak, who spoke
here on the persecution of
Jews in the USSR, failed even to
mention the plight of other
Soviet minorities (such as the
hundreds of thousands of Cri
mean Tartars, or the more than
two million Volga Deutsch). He
thereby drew for the Stanford
students a simplified and dis
torted picture of the real

struggle for freedom in the
Soviet Union. Political efforts
in defense of universal human
rights are easily misdirected
when they spring from beliefs
based on ethnic exclusivity.
It is to be regretted that Cit
ron did not care to familiarize
himself more thoroughly with

rations at the Soviet Consulate
on behalf of Alexander Sol
zhenitsyn as well as his priest
confessor, Father Dmitri
Dudko. We sponsored public
protests for Valentin Moroz
and Pyotr Grigirenko. More re
cently, we organized and
sponsored a speech by Vla
dimir Bukovsky to over 125
doctors at the Mount /ion
Hospital (a Jewish hospital) on
the subject of psychiatric
abuse in the USSR.
We have repeatedly ap
proached the Russian Or
thodox community in San
Francisco, as well as the Bap

tists and Pentecostal Christ
ians, in an attempt to interest
them in the fate of their fellow
religionists in the USSR. The
answer was uniformly, "We
shall pray for them." Our pleas
for social demonstrative action
fell on deaf ears.
We are extremely concerned
about the human rights viola
tions in the Soviet Union. Our
resources, however, restrict us
by necessity to working on one
issue: freedom of emigration.
But we frequently refer other
human rights violations to such
organizations as Amnesty In
ternational and we cooperate
with them as extensively as we
are able. We are frustrated by
the fact that there are no non-
Jewish organizations, except
the Ukrainians, working for
human rights in the USSR.
