## theater/bruce leiserowitz 'Beatlemania:' uneven visuals and entertaining clones 
### 
"The musicians in this show are
not the Beatles; they are an in
credible simulation." (Sign
above the Orpheum Theatre
ticket counter)
Take four reasonably
talented musicians. Dress
them up to look somewhat like
the Beatles. Train them to sing
and play like the Fab Four for
about two hours worth of
music. Then add an expensive
multi-media display to create
the atmosphere of the '60s.
What you end up with is the
show now playing at the Or
pheum Theatre in San Fran
cisco, called Beatlemania.
When I first heard of the
show some months ago, I
wasn't pleased at all. After all, I
thought, Beatlemania was just
someone's attempt to present
a fictional version of an event
that will probably never take
place: a Beatles reunion con
cert. The rumors of the offers
for just such a concert show
why an idea as Beatlemania was
bound to make money. Most
of us would pay outrageous
prices to attend a Beatles reun
ion concert, and if the Beatles
won't oblige us, then why not
have the next best thing?
Hence the motivating force
behind Beatlemania. In my
mind, the show was just
another shot at trying to
squeeze a dollar out of the

memories of the rock and roll
music of the '60s. Just what the
world needs, a set of Beatles
clones. The whole concept
sounded fairly tasteless.
Purpose
But the purpose of Beat
lemania is not merely to enter
tain the audience with four
Beatles lookalikes. The intro
duction of an elaborate audio
visual projection was sup
posed to change the concert
environment into a piece of
theater. The show would be
more than the on-stage imita
tions; it would provide a per
sepective on that turbulent
period of our nation's history.
While not a "heavy intellectual
trip," Beatlemania was sup
posed to get the audience to
think about the '60s. It was
because the show promised
more than I had expected from
it, and because some people
who I knew had seen the L.A.
production and enjoyed it
greatly, that convinced me to
see it for myself.
Questions
Once the show started, I was
basically thinking about two
questions. Hrst of all, how well
do the musicians on stage
simulate the Beatles? And sec
ondly, are the still pictures and
the film clips used effectively?
As to the first question, my
conclusion was that the pro
ducers of the show and the
musicians had done a fairly

creditable job of imitating both
the looks and the music of the
Beatles. What was interesting
was how the illusion improved
as the show went on, so that at
the end, it was very easy to im
agine that these four guys re
ally were the Beatles.
The production takes about
30 songs in roughly chronolog
ical order, and hence we see
the Beatles in different sets of
costumes that reflect that ar
rangement. They first appear
as the early Beatles, in coats
and ties. Although they smile
like the Beatles, and
shake their hair and sing
"OOOH!" like the Beatles, the
illusion doesn't work. Partly
this is because their stage pre
sence is rather wooden. But
also they don't facially resem
ble the Beatles at all. The origi
nal Broadway cast, from the
pictures that I have seen, were
dead ringers, especially the
McCartney lookalike. After a
speeded-up film of them in the
dressing-room changing into
white outfits (reminiscent of
the old Beatles films), they
emerge again wearing, you
guessed it, white suits. They
come a little closer to looking
like the real McCoys, but then
they ruin the effect by remov
ing their coats, and sitting at
the edge of the stage while
singing. They become just four
men trying to sound like the
Beatles.

But in the next set of cos
tumes, the illusion is very well
done, as they are dressed up in
the Sgt. Pepper uniforms. They
all have moustaches, and John
sports granny glasses and long
wavy hair. It is during this set of
songs that it is easiest to pre
tend that you are watching the
Beatles perform.
My highest compliments go
to the ability of the four musi
cians to sound like the Beatles.
Again, however, the concept
works best during the second
half of the show. In the first
part, when it is only the four
guys on stage singing and play
ing, the voices don't quite fit
what I remember for a given
song, even though their parts
are sung very well. But as the
show progressed, more in
strumentation is added, which
effectively blots out the differ
ences in singing styles.
Visual effects
With respect to the visual ef
fects, I wish that they had
equaled the level of quality that
went into the costumes and the
singing. There are over 4 000
color images, film and video
projections which are used in
Beatlemania, and it took eight
months and over $100,000 to
put them together. It is too bad
that the end result didn't seem
to justify the initial effort. Jules
Fischer, the person who was in
charge of the lighting designs,
has admitted that he would

have done some things diffe
rently.
His problem is that he is
given several songs with no
story line to them, and he has
to come up with designs that
are both appropriate to each
song and which help recreate
the '60s. Considering that the
whole show only lasts about
two hours, that is quite a task.
Fischer must use the ability of
pictures to suggest things to
us, because of the time con
straints. Instead, the pictures
and films tend more toward
the expected, the cliched and
the mundane.
The images that appear be
hind, in front of, and beside
the performers often stoop to
the trite. During "We Can
Work it Out," for example,
there is a series of drawings
of a man and a woman, who,
after facing apart after an appa
rent argument, eventually
come together and embrace.
That took very little imagina
tion. The psychedelic images
that went along with "Lucy in
the Sky with Diamonds," in
cluded the usual Moiree pat
terns, not to mention Life
magazine-style pictures of
hippies smoking dope. Al
though some of that sequence
worked, such as the floating
galaxies, I was reminded more
of some of the drug education
films I used to see in hygiene
classes.

Often the images don't really
go along with the songs. Dur
ing "Michelle," we are treated
to various scenes of pollution
as seen out of a set of blue win
dows.
The above discussion is not
to suggest that the projections
are never well done. Perhaps
the best part of the show was
when a film clip of Johnson de
claring his War on Poverty was
immediately followed by
"Can't Buy Me Love." That was
an excellent touch.
But overall, when there was
no clear theme to a given set of
songs, the images tended to be
rather poor. It would be as dif
ficult to understand the '60s by
viewing Beatlemania as it is to
understand the complexities
of, say, a national energy policy
by watching a 90-second news
report on the CBS evening
news.
Entertainment
Of course, the main purpose
of Beatlemania is to entertain,
and it manages to do that. The
performers got a standing ova
tion from the audience at the
end, and many people I talked
to really liked it. I talked to a
member of the sound crew, who

plays Paul McCartney in the
other set of Beatles (there are
two sets in every city), and he
said that there is always a stand
ing ovation in San Francisco.
But even if the main purpose
of the show is entertainment, I
would take exception to the
price you have to pay to see it.
The minimum is $9, which is a
balcony seat on an off-night.
Decent seats on weekends
(excluding discounts) cost up
to $15. Unless you have money
to burn, you may find that you
would be spending your
money better if you used it to
improve your collection of
Beatles albums, rather than to
go see a higher-priced imita
tion.

there is a series of drawings
of a man and a woman, who,
after facing apart after an appa
rent argument, eventually
come together and embrace.
That took very little imagina
tion. The psychedelic images
that went along with "Lucy in
the Sky with Diamonds," in
cluded the usual Moiree pat
terns, not to mention Life
magazine-style pictures of
hippies smoking dope. Al
though some of that sequence
worked, such as the floating
galaxies, I was reminded more
of some of the drug education
films I used to see in hygiene
classes.

Often the images don't really
go along with the songs. Dur
ing "Michelle," we are treated
to various scenes of pollution
as seen out of a set of blue win
dows.
The above discussion is not
to suggest that the projections
are never well done. Perhaps
the best part of the show was
when a film clip of Johnson de
claring his War on Poverty was
immediately followed by
"Can't Buy Me Love." That was
an excellent touch.
But overall, when there was
no clear theme to a given set of
songs, the images tended to be
rather poor. It would be as dif
ficult to understand the '60s by
viewing Beatlemania as it is to
understand the complexities
of, say, a national energy policy
by watching a 90-second news
report on the CBS evening
news.
Entertainment
Of course, the main purpose
of Beatlemania is to entertain,
and it manages to do that. The
performers got a standing ova
tion from the audience at the
end, and many people I talked
to really liked it. I talked to a
member of the sound crew, who

plays Paul McCartney in the
other set of Beatles (there are
two sets in every city), and he
said that there is always a stand
ing ovation in San Francisco.
But even if the main purpose
of the show is entertainment, I
would take exception to the
price you have to pay to see it.
The minimum is $9, which is a
balcony seat on an off-night.
Decent seats on weekends
(excluding discounts) cost up
to $15. Unless you have money
to burn, you may find that you
would be spending your
money better if you used it to
improve your collection of
Beatles albums, rather than to
go see a higher-priced imita
tion.
"The musicians in this show are
not the Beatles; they are an in
credible simulation." (Sign
above the Orpheum Theatre
ticket counter)
Take four reasonably
talented musicians. Dress
them up to look somewhat like
the Beatles. Train them to sing
and play like the Fab Four for
about two hours worth of
music. Then add an expensive
multi-media display to create
the atmosphere of the '60s.
What you end up with is the
show now playing at the Or
pheum Theatre in San Fran
cisco, called Beatlemania.
When I first heard of the
show some months ago, I
wasn't pleased at all. After all, I
thought, Beatlemania was just
someone's attempt to present
a fictional version of an event
that will probably never take
place: a Beatles reunion con
cert. The rumors of the offers
for just such a concert show
why an idea as Beatlemania was
bound to make money. Most
of us would pay outrageous
prices to attend a Beatles reun
ion concert, and if the Beatles
won't oblige us, then why not
have the next best thing?
Hence the motivating force
behind Beatlemania. In my
mind, the show was just
another shot at trying to
squeeze a dollar out of the

memories of the rock and roll
music of the '60s. Just what the
world needs, a set of Beatles
clones. The whole concept
sounded fairly tasteless.
Purpose
But the purpose of Beat
lemania is not merely to enter
tain the audience with four
Beatles lookalikes. The intro
duction of an elaborate audio
visual projection was sup
posed to change the concert
environment into a piece of
theater. The show would be
more than the on-stage imita
tions; it would provide a per
sepective on that turbulent
period of our nation's history.
While not a "heavy intellectual
trip," Beatlemania was sup
posed to get the audience to
think about the '60s. It was
because the show promised
more than I had expected from
it, and because some people
who I knew had seen the L.A.
production and enjoyed it
greatly, that convinced me to
see it for myself.
Questions
Once the show started, I was
basically thinking about two
questions. Hrst of all, how well
do the musicians on stage
simulate the Beatles? And sec
ondly, are the still pictures and
the film clips used effectively?
As to the first question, my
conclusion was that the pro
ducers of the show and the
musicians had done a fairly

creditable job of imitating both
the looks and the music of the
Beatles. What was interesting
was how the illusion improved
as the show went on, so that at
the end, it was very easy to im
agine that these four guys re
ally were the Beatles.
The production takes about
30 songs in roughly chronolog
ical order, and hence we see
the Beatles in different sets of
costumes that reflect that ar
rangement. They first appear
as the early Beatles, in coats
and ties. Although they smile
like the Beatles, and
shake their hair and sing
"OOOH!" like the Beatles, the
illusion doesn't work. Partly
this is because their stage pre
sence is rather wooden. But
also they don't facially resem
ble the Beatles at all. The origi
nal Broadway cast, from the
pictures that I have seen, were
dead ringers, especially the
McCartney lookalike. After a
speeded-up film of them in the
dressing-room changing into
white outfits (reminiscent of
the old Beatles films), they
emerge again wearing, you
guessed it, white suits. They
come a little closer to looking
like the real McCoys, but then
they ruin the effect by remov
ing their coats, and sitting at
the edge of the stage while
singing. They become just four
men trying to sound like the
Beatles.

But in the next set of cos
tumes, the illusion is very well
done, as they are dressed up in
the Sgt. Pepper uniforms. They
all have moustaches, and John
sports granny glasses and long
wavy hair. It is during this set of
songs that it is easiest to pre
tend that you are watching the
Beatles perform.
My highest compliments go
to the ability of the four musi
cians to sound like the Beatles.
Again, however, the concept
works best during the second
half of the show. In the first
part, when it is only the four
guys on stage singing and play
ing, the voices don't quite fit
what I remember for a given
song, even though their parts
are sung very well. But as the
show progressed, more in
strumentation is added, which
effectively blots out the differ
ences in singing styles.
Visual effects
With respect to the visual ef
fects, I wish that they had
equaled the level of quality that
went into the costumes and the
singing. There are over 4 000
color images, film and video
projections which are used in
Beatlemania, and it took eight
months and over $100,000 to
put them together. It is too bad
that the end result didn't seem
to justify the initial effort. Jules
Fischer, the person who was in
charge of the lighting designs,
has admitted that he would

have done some things diffe
rently.
His problem is that he is
given several songs with no
story line to them, and he has
to come up with designs that
are both appropriate to each
song and which help recreate
the '60s. Considering that the
whole show only lasts about
two hours, that is quite a task.
Fischer must use the ability of
pictures to suggest things to
us, because of the time con
straints. Instead, the pictures
and films tend more toward
the expected, the cliched and
the mundane.
The images that appear be
hind, in front of, and beside
the performers often stoop to
the trite. During "We Can
Work it Out," for example,
there is a series of drawings
of a man and a woman, who,
after facing apart after an appa
rent argument, eventually
come together and embrace.
That took very little imagina
tion. The psychedelic images
that went along with "Lucy in
the Sky with Diamonds," in
cluded the usual Moiree pat
terns, not to mention Life
magazine-style pictures of
hippies smoking dope. Al
though some of that sequence
worked, such as the floating
galaxies, I was reminded more
of some of the drug education
films I used to see in hygiene
classes.

Often the images don't really
go along with the songs. Dur
ing "Michelle," we are treated
to various scenes of pollution
as seen out of a set of blue win
dows.
The above discussion is not
to suggest that the projections
are never well done. Perhaps
the best part of the show was
when a film clip of Johnson de
claring his War on Poverty was
immediately followed by
"Can't Buy Me Love." That was
an excellent touch.
But overall, when there was
no clear theme to a given set of
songs, the images tended to be
rather poor. It would be as dif

viewing Beatlemania as it is to

like the real McCoys, but then
they ruin the effect by remov
ing their coats, and sitting at
the edge of the stage while
singing. They become just four
men trying to sound like the
Beatles.

But in the next set of cos
tumes, the illusion is very well
done, as they are dressed up in
the Sgt. Pepper uniforms. They
all have moustaches, and John
sports granny glasses and long
wavy hair. It is during this set of
songs that it is easiest to pre
tend that you are watching the
Beatles perform.
My highest compliments go
to the ability of the four musi
cians to sound like the Beatles.
Again, however, the concept
works best during the second
half of the show. In the first
part, when it is only the four
guys on stage singing and play
ing, the voices don't quite fit
what I remember for a given
song, even though their parts
are sung very well. But as the
show progressed, more in
strumentation is added, which
effectively blots out the differ
ences in singing styles.
Visual effects
With respect to the visual ef
fects, I wish that they had
equaled the level of quality that
went into the costumes and the
singing. There are over 4 000
color images, film and video
projections which are used in
Beatlemania, and it took eight
months and over $100,000 to
put them together. It is too bad
that the end result didn't seem
to justify the initial effort. Jules
Fischer, the person who was in
charge of the lighting designs,
has admitted that he would

have done some things diffe
rently.
His problem is that he is
given several songs with no
story line to them, and he has
to come up with designs that
are both appropriate to each
song and which help recreate
the '60s. Considering that the
whole show only lasts about
two hours, that is quite a task.
Fischer must use the ability of
pictures to suggest things to
us, because of the time con
straints. Instead, the pictures
and films tend more toward
the expected, the cliched and
the mundane.
The images that appear be
hind, in front of, and beside
the performers often stoop to
the trite. During "We Can
Work it Out," for example,
there is a series of drawings
of a man and a woman, who,
after facing apart after an appa
rent argument, eventually
come together and embrace.
That took very little imagina
tion. The psychedelic images
that went along with "Lucy in
the Sky with Diamonds," in
cluded the usual Moiree pat
terns, not to mention Life
magazine-style pictures of
hippies smoking dope. Al
though some of that sequence
worked, such as the floating
galaxies, I was reminded more
of some of the drug education
films I used to see in hygiene
classes.

Often the images don't really
go along with the songs. Dur
ing "Michelle," we are treated
to various scenes of pollution
as seen out of a set of blue win
dows.
The above discussion is not
to suggest that the projections
are never well done. Perhaps
the best part of the show was
when a film clip of Johnson de
claring his War on Poverty was
immediately followed by
"Can't Buy Me Love." That was
an excellent touch.
But overall, when there was
no clear theme to a given set of
songs, the images tended to be
rather poor. It would be as dif
ficult to understand the '60s by
viewing Beatlemania as it is to
understand the complexities
of, say, a national energy policy
by watching a 90-second news
report on the CBS evening
news.
Entertainment
Of course, the main purpose
of Beatlemania is to entertain,
and it manages to do that. The
performers got a standing ova
tion from the audience at the
end, and many people I talked
to really liked it. I talked to a
member of the sound crew, who

plays Paul McCartney in the
other set of Beatles (there are
two sets in every city), and he
said that there is always a stand
ing ovation in San Francisco.
But even if the main purpose
of the show is entertainment, I
would take exception to the
price you have to pay to see it.
The minimum is $9, which is a
balcony seat on an off-night.
Decent seats on weekends
(excluding discounts) cost up
to $15. Unless you have money
to burn, you may find that you
would be spending your
money better if you used it to
improve your collection of
Beatles albums, rather than to
go see a higher-priced imita
tion.
"The musicians in this show are
not the Beatles; they are an in
credible simulation." (Sign
above the Orpheum Theatre
ticket counter)
Take four reasonably
talented musicians. Dress
them up to look somewhat like
the Beatles. Train them to sing
and play like the Fab Four for
about two hours worth of
music. Then add an expensive
multi-media display to create
the atmosphere of the '60s.
What you end up with is the
show now playing at the Or
pheum Theatre in San Fran
cisco, called Beatlemania.
When I first heard of the
show some months ago, I
wasn't pleased at all. After all, I
thought, Beatlemania was just
someone's attempt to present
a fictional version of an event
that will probably never take
place: a Beatles reunion con
cert. The rumors of the offers
for just such a concert show
why an idea as Beatlemania was
bound to make money. Most
of us would pay outrageous
prices to attend a Beatles reun
ion concert, and if the Beatles
won't oblige us, then why not
have the next best thing?
Hence the motivating force
behind Beatlemania. In my
mind, the show was just
another shot at trying to
squeeze a dollar out of the

memories of the rock and roll
music of the '60s. Just what the
world needs, a set of Beatles
clones. The whole concept
sounded fairly tasteless.
Purpose
But the purpose of Beat
lemania is not merely to enter
tain the audience with four
Beatles lookalikes. The intro
duction of an elaborate audio
visual projection was sup
posed to change the concert
environment into a piece of
theater. The show would be
more than the on-stage imita
tions; it would provide a per
sepective on that turbulent
period of our nation's history.
While not a "heavy intellectual
trip," Beatlemania was sup
posed to get the audience to
think about the '60s. It was
because the show promised
more than I had expected from
it, and because some people
who I knew had seen the L.A.
production and enjoyed it
greatly, that convinced me to
see it for myself.
Questions
Once the show started, I was
basically thinking about two
questions. Hrst of all, how well
do the musicians on stage
simulate the Beatles? And sec
ondly, are the still pictures and
the film clips used effectively?
As to the first question, my
conclusion was that the pro
ducers of the show and the
musicians had done a fairly

creditable job of imitating both
the looks and the music of the
Beatles. What was interesting
was how the illusion improved
as the show went on, so that at
the end, it was very easy to im
agine that these four guys re
ally were the Beatles.
The production takes about
30 songs in roughly chronolog
ical order, and hence we see
the Beatles in different sets of
costumes that reflect that ar
rangement. They first appear
as the early Beatles, in coats
and ties. Although they smile
like the Beatles, and
shake their hair and sing
"OOOH!" like the Beatles, the
illusion doesn't work. Partly
this is because their stage pre
sence is rather wooden. But
also they don't facially resem
ble the Beatles at all. The origi
nal Broadway cast, from the
pictures that I have seen, were
dead ringers, especially the
McCartney lookalike. After a
speeded-up film of them in the
dressing-room changing into
white outfits (reminiscent of
the old Beatles films), they
emerge again wearing, you
guessed it, white suits. They
come a little closer to looking
like the real McCoys, but then
they ruin the effect by remov
ing their coats, and sitting at
the edge of the stage while
singing. They become just four
men trying to sound like the
Beatles.

But in the next set of cos
tumes, the illusion is very well
done, as they are dressed up in
the Sgt. Pepper uniforms. They
all have moustaches, and John
sports granny glasses and long
wavy hair. It is during this set of
songs that it is easiest to pre
tend that you are watching the
Beatles perform.
My highest compliments go

cians to sound like the Beatles.
