Iran leader to end martial law
Tehran, Iran — Nominated by both houses of
Parliament, Prime Minister-designate Shahpour
Bakhtiar promised yesterday that he will gradually
dismantle martial law and indicated the be
leaguered shah would leave Iran temporarily after
the government takes power.
Speaking at a news conference after receiving
the nomination as the newcivilian prime minister,
Bakhtiar said the shah "wants to rest and take a
vacation — that is the desire he has expressed
himself."
Some reports indicated Washington was pres
sing him to go, but the State Department denied it
has advised the shah to leave. U.S. spokesman
Hodding Carter said there was no change in the
administration's support but that the shah would
be welcome in the United States should he decide
to leave Iran.
Bakhtiar said questions about the shah's future
were "extremely delicate" and he hoped to re
store "the legality of the king," apparently a refer
ence to his intention to limit the shah's powers.
While angry public officials in this country de
manded deportation of demonstrating Iranians,
another group of students marched peacefully for
several hours yesterday, one day after a violent
siege at the Beverly Hills home of a sister of the
Shah of Iran.
In Washington, Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger urged Americans yesterday to head
off the threat of shortages by reducing oil con
sumption until production in Iran resumes.
Schlesinger said there is no immediate,supply
problem but shortages could develop by next fall if
Iran's oil production is not resumed by then.
Israeli diplomat foresees talks
Washington — A new round of Mideast peace
talks probably will be held here in mid-month with
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance as the host, an
Israeli diplomat said yesterday.
But a State Department spokesman charged the
diplomat with "jumping the gun."
The spokesman, Hodding Carter, said that while
the administration would like to see the Egyptian-
Israeli negotiations resumed, "there is no time set,
there is no meeting set."
In any event, prospects for breaking the dead
lock on a treaty were uncertain.
The Israeli diplomat, who asked not to be
named, said in an interview that Israel still opposes
a target date for granting Palestinian self-rule and
remains opposed to dilution of a provision that
gives the treaty precedence over Egypt's military
ties with other Arab countries.
Carter indicated, meanwhile, that in its own dip
lomatic soundings, the United States has not
found any major shift in the positions of the two
sides.
In trying to resume negotiations, he said, "the
first thing you want to know is what is feasible to
do, and for that, you have to have something back
from the parties themselves."

Cambodia claims invasion halted
Bangkok, Thailand — Cambodia claimed early
today it has blunted a major Vietnamese thrust
into eastern Cambodia. Radio Phnom Penh said
Cambodian forces killed 14,000 enemy troops, de
stroyed 84 tanks and downed one warplane in a
week of fierce fighting.
The report was in sharp contrast to claims by
Cambodian rebels in the northeast who said they
had driven to within 45 miles of Phnom Penh and
estimates by military analysts in Bangkok who be
lieve Vietnamese troops were still advancing
westward into Cambodia.
The Phnom Penh broadcast said Cambodian vic
tories were scored between Christmas and New
Year's Day along the length of the Vietnamese-
Cambodian border.
There was no independent confirmation of the
report.
Cambodia formally asked the U.N. Security
Council in New York yesterday to hold an "urgent
meeting," saying Vietnam was "threatening
peace, security, independence and stability in
Southeast Asia and the world."
Earlier today, Cambodia accused Vietnam of
launching seven air raids against a key Mekong
River town only 35 miles southeast of Phnom
Penh. It said the warplanes destroyed a number of
houses and killed many patients at a hospital.
Mexicans debate pope's visit
Puebla, Mexico — Pope John Paul ll's impending
visit to Mexico is causing shock waves in a country
where church and state are rigorously separated.
The papal visit to inaugurate the third General
Conference of Latin American Bishops Jan. 26-31
could have a deep impact in this overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic country where the government
owns all church property and has no diplomatic
relations with the Vatican.
Since the announcement last month of the
pope's visit, Mexican newspapers and political
groups have debated the effect of his presence
here on the anti-clerical provisions of the 1917
Constitution.
Some columnists have suggested the pope's trip
might be the first step toward stronger ties bet
ween the Vatican and Mexico, where 95 percent of
the 61 million people are Catholic. Others have
said his visit might indicate the country is ready to
change its constitution to give all religious groups
more rights.
Portland air crash investigated
Portland, Ore. — The pilot of the United Airlines
jet that crashed in a residential section of Portland
was unaware of any fuel problem before he lost
power, his attorney said yesterday.
The attorney, Albert Malanca, made the state
ment after a National Transportation Safety Board
interview with the pilot, Malburn Mcßroom, 52.
Ten of the 184 people aboard were killed.
Investigators say evidence indicates the plane
ran out of fuel. Malanca said Mcßroom did not

speculate on what caused the crash, but said he
thought there was enough fuel to reach the run
way.
He said that the engines flamed out and the pilot
made a quick attempt tn determine hnw to get the
plane down with the smallest possible loss of life.
Haig to resign as NATO chief
Mons, Belgium — Gen. Alexander Haig, the
Republican-appointed commander of NATO
forces in Europe who differed with President
Jimmy Carter on the neutron bomb, said at a news
conference yesterday he will resign June 30.
The 54-year-old general told reporters at
NATO's European headquarters near Mons, 30
miles south of Brussels, he had asked Defense
Secretary Harold Brown to relieve him a year ago,
but Carter asked him to stay on another year.
Asked if he had any political plans, he said, "No,
not yet. I have no plans yet for any profession or
engagement, but nothing is excluded."
There have been persistent rumors in
Washington that Haig may seek the Republican
presidential nomination as another NATO com
mander, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, did in 1952.
Brown blasted for welfare cuts
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown wants to deny
welfare mothers and nearly 700,000 aged, blind
and disabled persons most of the cost-of-living
increase due them this year, Assembly Speaker
Leo McCarthy said yesterday.
The San Francisco Democrat said he would
"vigorously" oppose the move, saying that even
with a full increase the two groups would be living
at a "miserable level of existence."
McCarthy said that Brown will propose giving
about a 6 percent increase to 485,000 welfare
families, who got no increase last year, and to
685,000 aged, blind and disabled Californians,
most of whom got a 3.9 percent increase in federal
funds.
Dow Jones picks up
New York — The stock market chalked up its
second broad gain so far in 1979 yesterday, aided
by strength in the dollar in foreign exchange. Trad
ing picked up from Tuesday's slow pace.
The dollar registered substantial gains against

Analysts also noted that investors' recent con
cern over the political crisis in Iran had abated
somewhat with the Iranian Parliament's approval
of a new civilian government.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
5.97 to 817.39 after a 6.41-point gain Tuesday.

Bakhtiar said questions about the shah's future
were "extremely delicate" and he hoped to re
store "the legality of the king," apparently a refer
ence to his intention to limit the shah's powers.
While angry public officials in this country de
manded deportation of demonstrating Iranians,
another group of students marched peacefully for
several hours yesterday, one day after a violent
siege at the Beverly Hills home of a sister of the
Shah of Iran.
In Washington, Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger urged Americans yesterday to head
off the threat of shortages by reducing oil con
sumption until production in Iran resumes.
Schlesinger said there is no immediate,supply
problem but shortages could develop by next fall if
Iran's oil production is not resumed by then.
Israeli diplomat foresees talks
Washington — A new round of Mideast peace
talks probably will be held here in mid-month with
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance as the host, an
Israeli diplomat said yesterday.
But a State Department spokesman charged the
diplomat with "jumping the gun."
The spokesman, Hodding Carter, said that while
the administration would like to see the Egyptian-
Israeli negotiations resumed, "there is no time set,
there is no meeting set."
In any event, prospects for breaking the dead
lock on a treaty were uncertain.
The Israeli diplomat, who asked not to be
named, said in an interview that Israel still opposes
a target date for granting Palestinian self-rule and
remains opposed to dilution of a provision that
gives the treaty precedence over Egypt's military
ties with other Arab countries.
Carter indicated, meanwhile, that in its own dip
lomatic soundings, the United States has not
found any major shift in the positions of the two
sides.
In trying to resume negotiations, he said, "the
first thing you want to know is what is feasible to
do, and for that, you have to have something back
from the parties themselves."

Cambodia claims invasion halted
Bangkok, Thailand — Cambodia claimed early
today it has blunted a major Vietnamese thrust
into eastern Cambodia. Radio Phnom Penh said
Cambodian forces killed 14,000 enemy troops, de
stroyed 84 tanks and downed one warplane in a
week of fierce fighting.
The report was in sharp contrast to claims by
Cambodian rebels in the northeast who said they
had driven to within 45 miles of Phnom Penh and
estimates by military analysts in Bangkok who be
lieve Vietnamese troops were still advancing
westward into Cambodia.
The Phnom Penh broadcast said Cambodian vic
tories were scored between Christmas and New
Year's Day along the length of the Vietnamese-
Cambodian border.
There was no independent confirmation of the
report.
Cambodia formally asked the U.N. Security
Council in New York yesterday to hold an "urgent
meeting," saying Vietnam was "threatening
peace, security, independence and stability in
Southeast Asia and the world."
Earlier today, Cambodia accused Vietnam of
launching seven air raids against a key Mekong
River town only 35 miles southeast of Phnom
Penh. It said the warplanes destroyed a number of
houses and killed many patients at a hospital.
Mexicans debate pope's visit
Puebla, Mexico — Pope John Paul ll's impending
visit to Mexico is causing shock waves in a country
where church and state are rigorously separated.
The papal visit to inaugurate the third General
Conference of Latin American Bishops Jan. 26-31
could have a deep impact in this overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic country where the government
owns all church property and has no diplomatic
relations with the Vatican.
Since the announcement last month of the
pope's visit, Mexican newspapers and political
groups have debated the effect of his presence
here on the anti-clerical provisions of the 1917
Constitution.
Some columnists have suggested the pope's trip
might be the first step toward stronger ties bet
ween the Vatican and Mexico, where 95 percent of
the 61 million people are Catholic. Others have
said his visit might indicate the country is ready to
change its constitution to give all religious groups
more rights.
Portland air crash investigated
Portland, Ore. — The pilot of the United Airlines
jet that crashed in a residential section of Portland
was unaware of any fuel problem before he lost
power, his attorney said yesterday.
The attorney, Albert Malanca, made the state
ment after a National Transportation Safety Board
interview with the pilot, Malburn Mcßroom, 52.
Ten of the 184 people aboard were killed.

ran out of fuel. Malanca said Mcßroom did not

speculate on what caused the crash, but said he
thought there was enough fuel to reach the run
way.
He said that the engines flamed out and the pilot
made a quick attempt tn determine hnw to get the
plane down with the smallest possible loss of life.
Haig to resign as NATO chief
Mons, Belgium — Gen. Alexander Haig, the
Republican-appointed commander of NATO
forces in Europe who differed with President
Jimmy Carter on the neutron bomb, said at a news
conference yesterday he will resign June 30.
The 54-year-old general told reporters at
NATO's European headquarters near Mons, 30
miles south of Brussels, he had asked Defense
Secretary Harold Brown to relieve him a year ago,
but Carter asked him to stay on another year.
Asked if he had any political plans, he said, "No,
not yet. I have no plans yet for any profession or
engagement, but nothing is excluded."
There have been persistent rumors in
Washington that Haig may seek the Republican
presidential nomination as another NATO com
mander, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, did in 1952.
Brown blasted for welfare cuts
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown wants to deny
welfare mothers and nearly 700,000 aged, blind
and disabled persons most of the cost-of-living
increase due them this year, Assembly Speaker
Leo McCarthy said yesterday.
The San Francisco Democrat said he would
"vigorously" oppose the move, saying that even
with a full increase the two groups would be living
at a "miserable level of existence."
McCarthy said that Brown will propose giving
about a 6 percent increase to 485,000 welfare
families, who got no increase last year, and to
685,000 aged, blind and disabled Californians,
most of whom got a 3.9 percent increase in federal
funds.

Tehran, Iran — Nominated by both houses of
Parliament, Prime Minister-designate Shahpour
Bakhtiar promised yesterday that he will gradually
dismantle martial law and indicated the be
leaguered shah would leave Iran temporarily after
the government takes power.
Speaking at a news conference after receiving

Washington — A new round of Mideast peace
talks probably will be held here in mid-month with
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance as the host, an
Israeli diplomat said yesterday.
But a State Department spokesman charged the
diplomat with "jumping the gun."
The spokesman, Hodding Carter, said that while
the administration would like to see the Egyptian-
Israeli negotiations resumed, "there is no time set,
there is no meeting set."
In any event, prospects for breaking the dead
lock on a treaty were uncertain.
The Israeli diplomat, who asked not to be
named, said in an interview that Israel still opposes
a target date for granting Palestinian self-rule and
remains opposed to dilution of a provision that
gives the treaty precedence over Egypt's military
ties with other Arab countries.
Carter indicated, meanwhile, that in its own dip
lomatic soundings, the United States has not
found any major shift in the positions of the two
sides.
In trying to resume negotiations, he said, "the
first thing you want to know is what is feasible to
do, and for that, you have to have something back
from the parties themselves."

Cambodia claims invasion halted
Bangkok, Thailand — Cambodia claimed early
today it has blunted a major Vietnamese thrust
into eastern Cambodia. Radio Phnom Penh said
Cambodian forces killed 14,000 enemy troops, de
stroyed 84 tanks and downed one warplane in a
week of fierce fighting.
The report was in sharp contrast to claims by
Cambodian rebels in the northeast who said they
had driven to within 45 miles of Phnom Penh and
estimates by military analysts in Bangkok who be
lieve Vietnamese troops were still advancing
westward into Cambodia.
The Phnom Penh broadcast said Cambodian vic
tories were scored between Christmas and New
Year's Day along the length of the Vietnamese-
Cambodian border.
There was no independent confirmation of the
report.
Cambodia formally asked the U.N. Security
Council in New York yesterday to hold an "urgent
meeting," saying Vietnam was "threatening
peace, security, independence and stability in
Southeast Asia and the world."
Earlier today, Cambodia accused Vietnam of
launching seven air raids against a key Mekong
River town only 35 miles southeast of Phnom
Penh. It said the warplanes destroyed a number of
houses and killed many patients at a hospital.
Mexicans debate pope's visit
Puebla, Mexico — Pope John Paul ll's impending
visit to Mexico is causing shock waves in a country
where church and state are rigorously separated.
The papal visit to inaugurate the third General
Conference of Latin American Bishops Jan. 26-31
could have a deep impact in this overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic country where the government
owns all church property and has no diplomatic
relations with the Vatican.
Since the announcement last month of the
pope's visit, Mexican newspapers and political
groups have debated the effect of his presence
here on the anti-clerical provisions of the 1917
Constitution.
Some columnists have suggested the pope's trip
might be the first step toward stronger ties bet
ween the Vatican and Mexico, where 95 percent of
the 61 million people are Catholic. Others have
said his visit might indicate the country is ready to
change its constitution to give all religious groups
more rights.
Portland air crash investigated
Portland, Ore. — The pilot of the United Airlines
jet that crashed in a residential section of Portland
was unaware of any fuel problem before he lost
power, his attorney said yesterday.
The attorney, Albert Malanca, made the state
ment after a National Transportation Safety Board
interview with the pilot, Malburn Mcßroom, 52.
Ten of the 184 people aboard were killed.
Investigators say evidence indicates the plane
ran out of fuel. Malanca said Mcßroom did not

speculate on what caused the crash, but said he
thought there was enough fuel to reach the run
way.
He said that the engines flamed out and the pilot
made a quick attempt tn determine hnw to get the
plane down with the smallest possible loss of life.
Haig to resign as NATO chief
Mons, Belgium — Gen. Alexander Haig, the
Republican-appointed commander of NATO
forces in Europe who differed with President
Jimmy Carter on the neutron bomb, said at a news
conference yesterday he will resign June 30.
The 54-year-old general told reporters at
NATO's European headquarters near Mons, 30
miles south of Brussels, he had asked Defense
Secretary Harold Brown to relieve him a year ago,
but Carter asked him to stay on another year.
Asked if he had any political plans, he said, "No,
not yet. I have no plans yet for any profession or
engagement, but nothing is excluded."
There have been persistent rumors in
Washington that Haig may seek the Republican
presidential nomination as another NATO com
mander, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, did in 1952.
Brown blasted for welfare cuts
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown wants to deny
welfare mothers and nearly 700,000 aged, blind
and disabled persons most of the cost-of-living
increase due them this year, Assembly Speaker
Leo McCarthy said yesterday.
The San Francisco Democrat said he would
"vigorously" oppose the move, saying that even
with a full increase the two groups would be living
at a "miserable level of existence."
McCarthy said that Brown will propose giving
about a 6 percent increase to 485,000 welfare
families, who got no increase last year, and to
685,000 aged, blind and disabled Californians,
most of whom got a 3.9 percent increase in federal
funds.
