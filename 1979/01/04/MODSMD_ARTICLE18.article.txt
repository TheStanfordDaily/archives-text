A Palo Alto firm has developed
and plans to market a drug for mo
tion sickness in an innovative
form that will allow the medica
tion to be taken without pills or
injections.
The drug, developed by Alza
Corporation, will be encased in a
thin foil film about the size of a
dime and taped behind the pa
tient's ear. The drug will be ab
sorbed through the skin and can
be left in place up to three days.
Alza spokesman Jackie Horvath
said the new application
technique has several major be
nefits. When someone is suffer
ing from nausea, she said, "the
last thing you want to do is put
pills in their stomach."
The technique also eliminates
certain side effects of the drug,
according to Horvath.
The active ingredient of the Alza
drug is scopalamine which has
been used to cure motion sick
ness since the 1800s. However, it
traditionally has had undesirable
side effects including drowsiness,
hallucinations, and dryness of the
mucous membranes.
Horvath said that allowing the
drug to be absorbed through the
skin will cause it to enter the
blood stream slower than when
administered orally or by injec
tion. She said that the slow doses
will eliminate the drug's adverse
effects.

The film is placed behind the
ear because the skin there is quite
thin and because that area is a
convenient location, Horvath
said.
To use the drug, a person would
peel a backing off the foil to ex
pose an adhesive surface, then
place the foil-enclosed drug be
hind his ear several hours before
traveling. The drug can be re
moved at any time or left in place
for the full-dosage three days.
Since the drug will be absorbed
into the blood stream at the same
rate by everyone, the same dos
age can be used by all people, ac
cording to Horvath.
Horvath added that Alza is
planning to apply the same
technique to other drugs which
might have fewer side effects
when administered in slow, regu
lated doses.
The Alza product should go on
the market in about 18 months â€”
as soon as the production
facilities can be designed and or
ganized. However, Horvath said
the firm will not know how much
thedrugwill cost until the method
of production has been decided.
The technique of administering
a drug through the skin, (referred
to as a transdermal system) has
never been attempted, according
to Horvath.
The method was approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administ
ration late last year.
