# Debate continues on mascot guidelines
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
In the latest development in the
seven-year quest for a new mascot,
the Academic Affairs committee of
the ASSU Senate has begun to look
into the problems of replacing the
old Stanford Indian.
The full senate referred the prob
lem to the committee in late
November, instructing them to de
velop a series of guidelines that
would define and help expedite the
selection process.
But even the process of determin
ing guidelines may prove to be dif
ficult. At its first meeting to consider
guidelines on Dec. 15, the commit
tee resolved to postpone any deci
sion until its next meeting )an. 11 be
cause only three of its seven regular
members were present.
Committee Chairman Erik
Thompson said the conclusions at
the next meeting will be "more defi
nite, but may not be final."
The committee's deliberations
centered on a five-point proposal by
Thompson. The plan stipulated the
mascot should:
— be real and tangible to the entire
Stanford community;
— relate to Stanford tradition;
— symbolize a hard-driving, aggres
sive spirit, though it need not be
ferocious;

— be relatively contemporary;
— and constitute no slur to any
group or person.
No disagreement
There was some disagreement on
the purpose of the guidelines.
Thompson said they would enable
the senate to have a say in the deci
sion on a mascot. Thompson said the
entire senate should become a lob
bying body for any mascot it or the
student body as a whole finally de
cided upon.
Friends of the Griffin, a recently
formed student group working for
the selection of the griffin as the Uni
versity's new mascot, was rep
resented at the meeting by Heidi
Munzinger. She stressed that the
adoption of guidelines would let her
organization work toward the selec
tion of the griffin as mascot within a
more clearly defined framework than
is now possible.
The committee also discussed the
"no slur" provision. Members disag
reed on the extent of offensiveness
that might bar a potential mascot
from consideration. Several ideas
were debated, including the estab
lishment of the minimum number of
peoplewho would have to object to a
mascot candidate to veto it.
The members said that provision
was included as a reaction to the de

mise of the Indian, which was the
University's mascot until objections
from native American groups promp
ted President Richard Lyman to re
voke it as mascot.
Munzinger said the committee
should not lose sight of the purpose
of a mascot, which she describes as
"something the athletes can get be
hind. I don't think it is fair to just say
to them 'this is what the rest of the
student body wants.'" Munzinger
added that the administration will
have a say in the decision "no matter
what."
Methods of approval of a mascot
were also on the agenda. Thompson
suggested that nominations be made
by the ASSU Senate or a petition
signed by 5 percent of the student
body. In discussing an eventual re
ferendum vote on the mascot most
members present said there should
be a minimum turnout to validate the
election. The majority felt a run-off
election should be held if any candi
date failed to draw a majority.
This stipulation was meant to allay
fears that the outcome of the re
ferendum would be similar to the last
one held on this issue, in which the
Robber Barons outpolled the nearest
runners-up, the Sequoias, by ap
proximately 70 votes out of more
than 2700 cast.
