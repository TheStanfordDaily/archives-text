# McCloskey defends draft plan
## 
### ALI WEBB 
"The volunteer army is not work
ing," Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) said in defense of his proposed
national youth service program in a
debate last night.
"You must start with the concept
that it is necessary to national sec
urity to have a combat force in readi
ness," McCloskey argued, in front of
an audience of nearly 100 at the First
Congregational Church in Palo Alto.
His opponent, Rev. Barry Lynn of
the United Church of Christ and a
member of the District of Columbia
Bar, called the program "unneces
sary and impractical. It is unconstitu
tional and an inappropriate method
to deal with the problems that face
the United States."
Three options
McCloskey's plan — first proposed
two months ago — would require all
youths to register at a local place
ment center before their 18th birth
day, and to select one of three op
tions:
— two years of military service by
age 24 with the incentive of a year of
paid college education for each year
served;
— one year of civilian service by
age 24, in a variety of situations in

cluding groups such as the Peace
Corps. Minimum wage would be
paid minus housing or other be
nefits; or
— placement in a military lottery
pool in which the individual would
be drafted into the armed services
sometime between the age of 18 and
24, if necessary.
Involuntary servitude
Lynn decried the proposal, saying
that "to enact national service would
constitute involuntary servitude
under the 13th Amendment."
McCloskey disputed the uncon
stitutionality claim, saying "we pas
sed the first Selective Service Act in
1938 or '39 by one vote in Congress,
we were not then at war and weren't
at war for two or three years after."
But a mandatory program is neces
sary to maintain desirable levels of
quality personnel because, "no
reasonable young person would
want to be in a combat ready unit,"
McCloskey admitted. He cited the
failure of the Air Force to meet its
recruiting needs for the first time re
cently, as has been the case with the
Army and Marine Corps for several
years.
"The lack of a draft or a large pool

of man or woman power has had a
slight but serious calming effect on
the military establishment, a military
establishment that has a tendency to
get itself involved in misadventures
like Vietnam," Lynn said.
'Reluctant' army
McCloskey sees a volunteer army
as a reluctant army — one which
makes foreign intervention less feas
ible. "There is value in having a reluc
tant citizen army rather than an all
professional army," and possibly a
more mercenary force, he said.
Audience response to McClos
key's proposal was mixed. By a show
of hands, approximately half of the
audience appeared to be in favor of
McCloskey's introduction of the
program before the next Congress.
Throughout the debate both sides
received strong support from the
audience.
"There are three things that this
country can demand of its citizens:
payment of taxes, service on a jury
and service in defense of the coun
try," McCloskey closed.
Lynn said that church members
must lead the right against the prop
osal, which he said would not recog
nize conscientious objectors.
