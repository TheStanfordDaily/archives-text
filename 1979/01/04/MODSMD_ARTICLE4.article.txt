# Multimillion dollar Hospital expansion considered
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Serious problems resulting from
overcrowded University Hospital
areas have caused officials here to
consider building a new multi
million dollar medical facility.
Remodeling alone will not meet
present or future demands, adminis
trators say.
"It doesn't make practical or finan
cial sense to remodel our current
facilities for meeting our present or
future needs," explained 1 Gary
Mecklenburg, Hospital adminis
trator. "We're going to need more
room and it won't be a small con
struction job. We're talking about a
project in the tens of millions of dol
lars."
Overcrowded conditions have
caused problems in the Hospital's
surgical areas and in the neonatal
nursery where workers recently
threatened to strike.
However, according to Mecklen
burg, these areas can't be remodeled
without considering the Hospital as a
whole. "You can't go out and spend
money when you don't know how
the remodeling is going to fit into the
master plan," he explained.
Master plan
Therefore, administrators are
drawing up a master facilities plan,
expected to be completed in mid
-1979. This plan will probably show
the need for a totally new building,
Mecklenburg said.
But he added that because of gov
ernment regulations and other red
tape, a new medical building may not
be built for at least another five years.
The overcrowded situation is not a
new occurrence at the Hospital. Sur
gical areas in both the Hospital and
Hoover Pavilion have been over
worked for the last few years,
Mecklenburg said.
Scheduling problem
He stressed that although the qual
ity of operations performed there
has not decreased, problems have
arisen in operation scheduling.
Surgeries are scheduled only from

7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. but, because of
emergency' cases which must be
squeezed into the already-tight
timetable, regularly scheduled cases
are performed later in the day. The
rooms end up being used about 10
hours daily, Mecklenburg estimated.
The problem is that there are too
few operating rooms, he said. He
added that six to eight more are
needed immediately.
Neonatal nursery
The neonatal nursery, too, "needs
to be replaced," he said.
Many of the nursery workers
threatened to strike earlier this year,
citing overcrowded working condi
tions among their numerous com
plaints.
"We had plans to remodel even
before the nurses threatened to
strike," Mecklenburg said, adding
that remodeling which is designed to
"make better use of the facilities now
being provided" is currently under
way.
The nursery is not being enlarged.
This will be included only in the mas
ter facilities plan, he said.
Regional center
The overcrowded problem in the
nursery has resulted from the Hospi
tal's new prominence as a regional
center. "We're flying critically ill
babies here for treatment from all
over Northern California and some
times from places even farther
away," he said.
Furthermore, an increasing
number of high risk mothers are
coming to the Hospital to give birth
so the babies can immediately be
placed in the nursery, he added.
'Crowing pains'
The entire Hospital will eventually
suffer "growing pains" because of
rapid technological changes which
demand advanced equipment, more
space and more patient facilities,
Mecklenburg said.
"There's a significant growth in
medical knowledge and with that
growth comes more patients,"
Mecklenburg said. "We're treating
patients now who couldn't receive

care 20 years ago."
However, the Hospital is not
necessarily seeinga larger numberof
patients. Because of Stanford's up
to-date medical technology, the
Hospital is seeing more seriously ill
patients who stay longer, forcing the
Hospital to cut back on the total
number of patients admitted.
Fewer births
"Forexample the number of births
here at Stanford has gone down be
cause we're admitting more high-risk
mothers who stay longer than the
mothers with no complications,"
Mecklenburg said.
The Hospital must also solve the
expensive problem of trying to keep
up jvith changing federal guidelines

which are often confusing and am
biguous.
"Some of our facilities may be
cited because they don't conform to
standards made three or four years
ago," Mecklenburg said. "However,
at the time the facilities were built,
they conformed to the guidelines."
Constant updating
Title 22, which constantly updates
new building codes, raises an impor
tant question: How long after Title 22
is revised may an institution wait be
fore it complies with that guideline,
which may be changed again two
years later?
Administrators have also had diffi
culty with Title 22 because of its am
biguity.

"For example, Title 22 mandates
that the medical institution provide
80 square feet per bassinet in the
neonatal nursery," Mecklenburg
explained. "So how do you countthe
square footage? Does it mean you
need 80 square feet around each bas
sinetorthat there can be 20 bassinets
in the nursery as long as the total
floor space equals 1600 square feet?"
Unfortunately, University ar
chitects guessed wrong. The plan
ners took the total gross area and
divided it by 80 to give them the
number of bassinets they could in
stall. Later, during federal inspec
tions, the state government cited the
nursery tor not having 80 square feet
around each bassinet.
