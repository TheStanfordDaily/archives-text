# Research shows tentative results
## Drug may help cancer patients 
### BRAD CRYSTAL 
When doctors in a 1960 Flash Cor
don comic strip administered a new
drug called interferon to cure an ex
traterrestrial virus, it was probably
dismissed by most people as science
fiction. Nineteen years later, it ap
pears that the science fiction may be
science fact.
Interferon, a scarce natural body
substance discovered in 1957, has
been used successfully by a team of
University Medical School resear
chers to reduce tumors of the lym
phatic system in three cancer pa
tients. Led by Dr. Thomas Merigan, a
leading interferon specialist, the re
searchers reported that injections of
the chemical resulted in "significant
regressions" in all three cases.
A recently published report said
that two of the three patients have
been followed for several months
and "remain well, with no evidence
of progression of the disease."
The three patients in the study had
received no prior treatment, and a
spontaneous regression was highly
unlikely to have occurred, Merigan
said.
While Merigan said he is "very en

couraged" by the findings, he
acknowledged that it has not yet
been determined whether interferon
is "uniquely useful in prolonging the
lives of cancer patients."
Lymphoma
Lymphoma, or cancer of the lym
phaticsystem, is characterized by the
increase of white blood cells pro
duced in the bone marrow and the
formation of malignant growths in
the lymphatic system. The lymphatic
system plays a role in the body's im
mune responses.
The study noted three other pa
tients with a different, rapidly ad
vancing form of lymphoma who
failed to respond to the interferon
treatments. They previously had re
ceived drug and radiation treat
ments. But the report pointed out
that previous therapy may inhibit in
terferon's ability to work with the
body's immune system in shrinking
tumors.
The University study is the
forerunner of a $2 million research
project supported by the American
Cancer Society to test the effective
ness of interferon on human can
cers. The University is one of five

medical centers participating in the
nationwide trial.
Protein
Interferon is a large hormone-like
protein produced by cells of all ver
tebrate animals when white cells en
counter foreign substances. In addi
tion to its anti-tumor properties, it is
an anti-viral agent effective against
herpes zoster (shingles) and
hepatitis B infections.
Unlike some of the strong anti
cancer drugs that cause dangerous
side effects, interferon is relatively
non-toxic because it is produced in
the body.
The way interteron works is still a
mystery, according to the resear
chers. Evidence suggests that it may
act either by inhibiting malignant cell
growth or by aiding destruction of
tumor cells by the body's natural de
fenses.
From Finland
Most interferon, including the
supply that will be used in the new
tests, comes from Finland where it is
extracted from white blood cells ex
posed to virus. The process is ex
pensive, making extensive interfe-
Ron research before this time dif
ficult. A millionth of an ounce of
pure interferon costs almost $1500.
To curb this cost efforts are under
way to synthesize the material or iso
late the gene for its production using
recombinant DNA, according to a
November Time article.

The University study, appearing in
the Dec. 28 issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine, marked the first
published report of its kind in the
United States. Besides Merigan,
team members included Karol
Sikorga, James breeden, Ronald Levy
and Saul Rosenberg.
