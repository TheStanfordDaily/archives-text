## Not far enough 
### 
Last month, the Board of Trustees
rejected an administration proposal
to dramatically increase Medical
School tuition.
Under the proposal, new students
would have had to pay 27.6 percent
more next fall. Continuing students
would have faced a mere 14.6 per
cent increase.
Administrators agree that such an
increase is necessary to bring Medi
cal School tuition revenue back up to
21 percent of cost â€” a level existent
in 1972-73. Since that year, the per
centage of costs covered by tuition
has eroded, so that present assess
ments only cover 17.9 percent of
costs.
We believe the board's decision
was the correct one. But we feel the
board did not go far enough in its
directive to the administration to re
think its proposal.
For one thing, we question the
two-tiered system of tuition assess
ment. We understand the administ
ration's concern that such a huge
hike for continuing students is
perhaps unfair. Butall studentsatthe
Medical School share equally in the

facilities, and they should all pay the
same amount.
Moreover, if the 21-percent-of
cost policy is to be implemented and
maintained, it will mean that stu
dents presently enrolled will be get
ting an education without paying
their "fair share."
A second consideration is com
pliance with President Jimmy Car
ter's wage and price guidelines.
Under the guidelines, the Universi
ty's weighted average of all prices it
charges must reflect an overall in
crease of no more than 9.1 percent.
Even under the original proposal,
the University would have met this
requirement.
But legal compliance is simply not
enough. The University should
acknowledge not only the letter, but
also the spirit of the guidelines.
Using that criterion, we feel the
University should make every effort
to keep any tuition hike at or below
the 9.1 percent level.
It's too bad the board, while realiz
ing the unworkability of the original
proposal, did not go one step further
and order the administration to keep
its tuition hikes at a reasonable level.
