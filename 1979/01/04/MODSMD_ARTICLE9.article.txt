## Rachelle Marshall Middle East deadlock: symptom of Camp David failure 
### 
The current deadlock in Israeli-Egyptian
treaty negotiations is only symptomatic of
the fact that the Camp David agreements
failed to resolve the basic problems that lie
in the way of a Middle East peace.
In 1975, when the leaders of Saudi Arabia,
Jordan and Syria offered to recognize Israel
under certain conditions; they were making
as significant a break with the past as Anwar
Sadat was to do two years later when he
visited Jerusalem. Until then the Arab posi
tion had been that a Jewish state was an alien
presence, a usurper of Arab land whose exis
tence could not be tolerated under any con
ditions.
In agreeing to live in peace with Israel,
King Khaled, King Hussein and President
Assad were reversing 60 years of Arab or
thodoxy.
In return, however, they insisted on Is
rael's withdrawal to her 1967 borders and the
creation of an independent Palestinian state
on the west bank of the Jordan River.
The Camp David accords essentially re
jected these conditions, and the subsequent
denunciation of the accords by Saudi Arabia,
Jordan and Syria, as well as the other Arab
states, should have come as no surprise.
Jordan's Hussein has attacked the agree
ments for their failure to deal with the status

of Jerusalem, for permitting the continued
presence of Israeli troops on the West Bank
and for lack of any firm guarantee that Pales
tinian refugees could return to their former
homes in the occupied territories.
He observed that the proposal for Palesti
nian autonomy resembled the all-black re
servations established by the government of
South Africa.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin's
statements shortly after leaving Camp David
served only to reinforce Arab opposition.
On Sept. 25, Begin told the Knesset that
there "will not be under any circumstances a
Palestinian state" and that Jerusalem would
remain undivided as the capital of Israel "for
eternity."
Contrary to what President Jimmy Carter
and other U.S. officials claimed had been
agreed to at Camp David, Begin said that
Israeli settlements on the West Bank would
be increased and strengthened after three
months. Finally, he pledged that Israeli
troops would remain on the West Bank inde
finitely.
On Dec. 10 the Manchester Guardian re
ported that Israel intended to settle 27,000
more Jewish families on the West Bank
within five years. In addition, the report
said, the Israeli Defense Ministry was prop

osing that Israel retain 250,000 acres of pub
lic land on the West Bank, that Israeli settle
ments should be governed under their own
laws and local councils despite Palestinian
autonomy, and that Israel should continue
to control all water resources in the oc
cupied territories.
The last could only further inflame Palesti
nian resentment. Since 1967 the Israeli
Water Authority has drilled 17 new irrigation
wells on the West Bank exclusively for the
use of Jewish settlers. Since that time no
Palestinian villages have been granted per
mission to drill such wells; consequently
there is less water available today to Palesti
nian farmers than before the occupation.
In November the Israeli military govern
ment on the West Bank launched a
crackdown, arresting a number of students
and others for illegal political activity and
allegedly beating and torturing some of
them. Israeli soldiers resumed tbe practice
of blowing up the homes of suspected ter
rorists and sprayed mace at Arabs attending
a court hearing to challenge the seizure of
their land by the occupation authorities.
As Israel continued to make it clear that
there was to be no softening of her attitude
toward the occupied territories, Sadat be
came more and more vulnerable to the

charge that he was abandoning the Palesti
nians in an effort to reach a separate peace
with Israel. So it was not surprising that in
late November he insisted that before there
could ge full peace between Egypt and Israel
the process of establishing Palestinian au
tonomy must begin.
He asked also that Egypt be able to retain
the right to go to the aid of other Arab na
tions if they were attacked. Israel rejected
both proposals and the talks have been
deadlocked ever since.
The Begin government accuses Sadat of
obstructionism for introducing new condi
tions into the negotiations, but Sadat virtu
ally had no choice. While Israel is willing to
return Egyptian land taken in 1967 in order to
eliminate Egypt as a military threat, she re
fuses even to discuss the concessions
necessary for a comprehensive peace.
The terms that Israel insists on would iso
late Egypt from the rest of the Arab world
and leave her, like Israel, totally dependent
on the U.S. for outside support.
Such terms increase the risk that Sadat
would be assassinated or deposed and re
placed by a government benton repudiating
the Camp David accords and any concilia
tion with Israel. In any case, an agreement
based on Israel's terms would only shift the

alliances in the Middle East; the tensions
and grievances that threaten war would con
tinue to exist.
That the treaty negotiations have found
ered over the question of a timetable for
Palestinian autonomy only indicates once
again that the question of the Palestinians'
future, along with the status of Jerusalem,
must be central to any productive negotia
tions. The Camp David agreements did not
resolve these problems to the satisfaction of
even the most moderate Arabs/ and con
sequently the fragility of those agreements
should have been evident from the start.
It should also be obviou.-* by now that the
fate of the one and a half million people now
living unwillingly under Israeli occupation
cannot be fairly determined unless their
chosen representatives can take part in the
deliberations.
Unfortunately there has been no sign that
the Carter administration recognizes these
realities, or is prepared to act on them. If
Carter can exert enough pressure on Sadat,
a treaty may yet be signed. But such an
event, no matter how much fanfare accom
panies it, should not be confused with mak
ing peace.
