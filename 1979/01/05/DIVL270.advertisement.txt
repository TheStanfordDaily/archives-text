Attention everyone
who finds newspapers
vaguely interesting
Now is your big chance. Today and Monday, The Stanford Daily is
holding special meetings for people interested in joining the staff. No
experience is necessary. All we require is interest in our operations and a
desire to learn. The Daily offers you the best opportunity on campus to
learn the inner workings of a newspaper, yet schedules here are flexible
so there is no minimum (or maximum) rime commitment. And there
ore such a variety of jobs to be done, there is something for everyone.
And the more people we have, the less there is for everyone to do. So
no matter how much you've done on a newspaper before, come on in
and give us a try. The meetings are today at 2 p. m. and Monday at 1
p.m. in the Daily offices. We're just across the mall from Terman
Engineering Center. For photographers, there is a special meeting
today at 12:30 p.m. See you there.
