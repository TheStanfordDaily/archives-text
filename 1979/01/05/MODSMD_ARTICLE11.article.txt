# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## David Steuer Place for regulation 
### 
This is a late response to a
November column by Doug
Bandow decrying govern
ments regulation in general,
and the proposed banning of
certain categories of toys in
tended for children under the
age of three in particular. I
wanted to wait out the Christ
mas season for a report of chil
dren killed by gagging on toy
parts. One toy alone knocked
off two within one week, ac
cording to NBC News. With
that in mind, I'd like to con
sider Bandow's charge that the
Consumer Product Safety
Commission (the regulating
agency) is "a bunch of myopic
and officious intermeddlers."
Bandow says that "the
citizenry must soon rebel
against this new tyranny."
Perhaps the image springs to
mind of toddlers crawling
around the White House bear
ing signs upon which is
scrawled (in mischievously
chosen toxic crayon) "Give us
back our gaggables," or some
thing of the sort. But of course,
the children aren't the pur
chasers of unsafe toys. Parents
are.
Bandow points out that "pa
rents are not considered . . .
capable enough to judge the
risk of toys." Indeed, if it was
shown that parents knew
which toys had small parts in
side, which toys splintered and
broke with jagged edges â€”
then there would be no need
to regulate the sale of such
toys. They wouldn't be bought.
But since such patently unsafe
toys are bought, and children
are injured and killed by them,
then there are at least some pa
rents who are incapable of
making sound choices. How
many parents have the time or
knowledge to run the proper
tests on toys? Perhaps I would
agree with Bandow and sing
caveat emptor to the purchas
ers of unsafe toys, but they
don't suffer for it. Their chil
dren do. I am hard pressed to
condemn a society which
would regulate to protect its
children.

Of course, dumping on gov
ernment is fast becoming the
national pastime. What politi
cian would run today on a plat
form of government regula
tion? There are perhaps three
rather intermingled strains of
attack on government to be
discerned.
The first is the inexorable
slide, creeping-socialism
school of thought. Milton
Friedman is a leading propo
nent of this theory which holds
that totalitarianism is the in
evitable result of government
interference in the economy;
the more involvement, the
quicker the slide. This school
hates Sweden and all social
democracies. It likes to pick on
Britain, which is the weakest,
and snipe at others when pos
sible.
The second line of attack is
the freedom and liberty de
fense. This is basically Ban
dow's line. Here it is asserted
that the essence of regulation
is not in the content of what is
being regulated, but in its as
sault on our freedom and lib
erty.
The third, and probably now
the dominant line of attack is
theme-first syndrome. That is,
all government regulation is to
,be judged on the objective and
personally verifiable scale of
whether or not it makes me
better or worse off. If it's ir
relevant to me (and here is its
strength) I'm against it because
it probably costs me money.
This last argument seems to
be the most honest. Most (if
not all) objections to regula
tion are rooted in economics.
There is money to be made
from dangerous toys. Defend
ing the sale of unsafe products
because of their connection to
our personal liberties can only
be done with the aid of the
theoretical and arcane propos
itions. The only real interest
anyone could have in selling
dangerous toys is financial.
All the foregoing is not to de
fend the sum of government
regulation, much of which is
burdensome and moronic, as

well as often enacted at the be
hest of economic interest
groups. Vet there is a place for
government regulation, which
is best conceived of and
applied in a democratic fashion
with community discussion
and initiative.
As to the erosion of our liber
ties, freedom of speech must
surely be the real bellwether
of democracy, since free
speech and totalitarianism are
incompatible. As long as Doug
Bandow can harangue the
evils of government, we are
probably in good shape.
