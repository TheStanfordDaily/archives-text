## Oregon trial bad test of rape law 
### 
A good law can survive a bad
case. But a bad case can deter
bringing a good one. The rape
trial just concluded in Oregon
is the case in point.
Last year, Oregon revised its
rape law, eliminating "spousal
immunity" as a defense. In
plain English, that meant that a
wife could charge her husband
with rape. This October, Greta
Rideout, 23, did just that. On
Wednesday, a jury in Salem,
Ore., unanimously acquitted
her husband, John Rideout, 21,
after a brief trial that attracted
national and international at
tention as the first case of its
kind.
Only Oregon, lowa, Dela
ware and— starting Monday —
New Jersey depart from the
English common-law practice
of exempting a husband from
prosecution on charges of rap
ing his wife. Those four states
are acknowledging that wives
are not their husbands' sexual

property, that there should be
some mutual agreement about
when to have sexual inter
course.
But there is another princi
ple that operates in our courts.
The presumption of innocence
if thereisany reasonabledoubt
of guilt. On Wednesday, that
principle prevailed because
the jury simply didn't know
whom to believe, and so found
Rideout innocent.
Greta Rideout had testified
that her husband had de
manded to have sex, that she
refused and that he hit her be
fore she submitted in fear.
John Rideout said they had
fought — adding that it was the
first time that he had intention
ally hit his wife — and then had
intercourse to make up.
One would expect divergent
testimony. Because only the
accused and the victim are pre
sent in an alleged rape in most
instances, judge and jury are

forced to weigh the reliabilty of
the accuser against that of the
accused. Mrs. Rideout was not
helped when the defense
counsel reminded the jury that
she had had two abortions,
one of which he said was the
result of a relationship with
another man while she was
married. We wonder, though,
about the propriety of discus
sing a woman's sexual history
in any rape case.
In short, it was a messy case.
Yet there are other women
who are plainly victims in simi
lar situations. The law remains
a necessary deterrent. It may
take more courage now for vic
tims to try to halt the violence
to which they are subjected
under so-called marital
privilege.
We have said that this case
was a good one. But who can
say what will constitute a
"good" case? It may be that any
marriage in which a wife feels

that she is being raped will
yield a sordid trial. Rape by na
ture is a difficult act tq prove;
clearly, it is going to be all the
more so in marriage, because
marriage by most definitions
involves sex. Proving rape
within marriage is. also made
difficult by the facf that what is
violence in one part of our cul
ture is accepted behavior in
another.
These problems of credibil
tiy and culture dictate that a law
is not the total solution. Ulti
mately, the answer lies not in
the courts hut in the civility of
husband and wife, each to the
other. Communication and
the understanding that it yields
go further than any law, how
ever needed and however
sound.
