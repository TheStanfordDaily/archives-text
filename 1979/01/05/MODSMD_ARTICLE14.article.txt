## Food can no longer he taken for granted 
### 
(This is the first of two parts.)
Food is certainly one of the
great pleasures of life, but un
fortunately for many people it
is a luxury that is unaffordable.
We take food for granted —
there has always been at least
enough — and we trust others
to take care of the growing,
packaging, the transporting to
convenient outlets, and the
cooking in most cases.
The dreaded specter of
global starvation is becoming
increasingly real in much of the
world as we approach the end
of the petroleum era. Accord
ing to the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) Second World Food Sur
vey, two-thirds of the human
population is undernourished.
Each year an estimated 10 to 20
million peoplt die from starva
tion or the effects of malnutri
tion, which represents one
thirdof theannual human mor
tality rate of 60 million.
Industrialized agriculture
will have to increase produc
tion to keep abreast of a 2 per
cent annual growth in world
population and rising demands
for meat production. Over
population may not be a prob

lem today, but it soon will be.
In the next 35 years, we must
double food production to
keep pace with the growth in
human numbers, and yet only
two continents — North
America and Australia — have
net food surpluses. In addi
tion, no American farmland is
being held out of production,
reserves are at an all-time low
(29 days of grain), we're run
ning out of fossil fuel, and
marine protein supplies are on
the decline.
We can no longer afford to
ignore the far-reaching effects
of excessive food consumption
in America. The American diet,
high in cholesterol, sugar, re
fined grains and fat, is directly
responsible for many of our
major health problems. On the
one hand inadequacies and on
the other hand excesses in our
diet can lead to diabetes, heart
disease, obesity and intestinal
cancer. And even in the U.S.,
the best-fed nation in the
world, although there is
enough food for everyone, we
don't distribute it equally or
fairly. A Senate investigation
revealed that between 10 and
15 million Americans are con

stantly hungry, mostly chil
dren, and another 10 to 15 mill
ion cannot afford a proper diet.
Tragically, children suffer the
most. The first three years are
critical for the brain grows 25 to
80 percent of its adult size.
If Americans can export
food, why can't it feed its own
people? Because Americans
desire so much meat in their
diets (an average of 250 lbs. a
year per person), it has be
come necessary to feed lives
tock half of our entire harvest.
It is clear that we must take re
sponsibility for what we eat,
and how our diet affects the
national and global food sup
ply. Most Americans eat twice
as much protein as they need,
which results in considerable
protein wastage.
The USDA reports that 90
percent of our corn, oats and
barley, and 90 percent of our
unexported soy bean crop are
fed to animals. Americans use
as much grain for livestock
feed as people in the poor
countries consume directly as
food. This is not only a real
tragedy, but a national dis
grace. Most of the grain with
which we feed our livestock
ends up as animal fat, which
adds to shipping costs and
then is trimmed off at a cost of
$2 billion yearly (USDA).
Americans, almost without ex
ception, consume grain-fed
rather than range-fed animals.
We could do far better if
more acres were converted
from meat production to high
protein grains. An acre of
cereal produces five times
more protein than one de
voted to cattle raising.
Legumes (beans, peas, and
lentils) produce 10 times as
much, leafy vegetables 15
times more, and spinach pro
duces 26 times more protein
than raising cattle on compar
able acreage. Eating less meat
not only relieves pressure on
our energy supplies but helps
to reduce the daily intake of
poisons in our food such as
pesticides.
Our short-sighted, overin
tensive agricultural practices
have resulted in deforestation,
overgrazing, accelerated soil
erosion, pollution and waste
disposal problems. Two and a
half million acres of primefarm
land are lost each year to non
agricultural purposes in the

U.S. With less land available,
farming must become more in
tensive and higher yielding.
But these pressures to increase
food supply often result in
widespread ecological dam
age. Each year we lose a billion
tons of topsoil. Already 60 per
cent of American topsoil has
been lost.
Farming in the tropics often
leads to a permanent degener
ation of soil and loss of all or
ganic matter. The Amazon
jungle, often called the "lungs
of the world," supplies much
of our planet's oxygen. It is
being deforested at an alarm
ing rate and used for cattle to
keep pace with the rising de
mands for meat. In Africa and
Asia, the imprudent clearing of
lands to use for farming has re
sulted in the spreading of de
serts and serious soil eroision
problems. In North America
and Europe, heavy inputs of
fertilizers pollute groundwater
and waterways. Poor irrigation
and soil conservation practices
lead to runoff, and rather than
feeding crops the fertilizer
(three million tons a year),

nourishes algae in nearby
streams, ponds and lakes. The
result is eutrophication, where
oxygen is removed by the algal
blooms till the water becomes
stagnant and lifeless. Pes
ticides also drain from fields
and into streams, killing fish
and wildlife.
What will be the first limiting
factor to seriously reduce food
production — loss of topsoil,
loss of arable land, reduced av
ailable sunlight from high
levels of atmospheric pollut
ants, inadequate water for irri
gation, lack of fertilizers, ex
tended bad weather or lack of
fossil fuel? We can't count on
food technology or miracle
new foods to help in solving
future food problems. What
will be required are serious
and sustained, individual and
collective efforts to share food
more equitably, slow down
population growth, conserve
soil, water, fuel and food, and
the development and practice
of a system of agriculture
based on permanence.
