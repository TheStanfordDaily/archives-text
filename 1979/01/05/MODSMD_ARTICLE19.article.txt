Notorious ickif-k
Festival Cinema, Palo Alio
Cine of Hitchcock's greatest
movies. Pauline Kael has called it
an 'amatory thriller," and she's
right; you're more concerned
about the Cary Grant-lngrid
Bergman relationship than you
are about the plot (which con
tains Hitchcock's most famous
"MacGuffin" — the uranium in
the wine bottles).
—Ron Lillejord
Rebecca ++* +
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Although he is not quite com
fortablewith the Gothic material,
Hitchcock takes the Daphne du
Maurier novel and makes a very
tight, technically brilliant chiller,
loan Fontaine gives a strong per
formance as the new wife of En
glish nobleman Max de Winter
(Laurence Olivier). Their bliss is
short-lived because both are
haunted by the memory of De
Winter's first wife. Judith Ander
son is memorable as the evil
housekeeper who won't let Fon
taine forget her predecessor.

Lord of the Rings ★
Old Mill
One of last year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat and
Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after
more than two hours we are in
formed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.

Coming Home ★★★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Set in 1968, Coming Home is a

drama about people at home de
aling with the Vietnam War. The
Bruce Dern character is unde
fined, and the movie occasionally
suffers from poor transition, but
it more than makes up for these
deficiencies with its understand
ing of the look and feel of the
time, lane Fonda and |on Voight
(as a paraplegic) are excellent,
and Hal Ashby's direction is fine
throughout.
—R.L.
Superman ★★ ★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot' Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie' ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets off
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the lane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the
ordinary sound witless and
forced.
—R.L.

Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst

frat on campus." I am neverquite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good

Excellent ★★★★
Good ★★★
Fair ★★
Better than TV*
Guano tl

stuff.
|ohn Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

Autumn Sonatj ★ ★★ Vi
Fine Arts, Palo Alio
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.
Magic ★★
Old Mill
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's a dummy in the |udy Gar
land part and the star-on-the
way-down role is taken by An
thony Hopkins as a ventriloquist.
Director Richard Attenborough
pulls off one or two scary mo
ments, but this pseudo
psychological story about a ven
triloquist who becomes obses
sed with his own mannequin has
been done many times before —
and better.
—J.M.
The Wiz ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical; lots of every
thing — but make sure we don't
offend anybody. In his desire to
energize this sprawling mess,
Sidney Lumet, the director, sim
ply increased the budget, turned
the volume up and enlarged the
sets. Subtlety and individuality
are trampled by all the technol
ogy-
The movie has huge sets, hun

dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multicolored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on<
Who do we fear Vou can t
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, it there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so huge, so loud in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.
—R.L.
King of the Gypsies ★ ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you're in the right mood, this
silly mock epic about a clan of
gypsies in the big city is surpris
ingly entertaining. Vou could
spend days just trying to figure
out the genetics of this family, in
which the most amazingly di
verse looking people are sup
posed to be closely related. Sterl
ing Hayden and Shelley Winters
get top billing, but the only per
formances worth watching are by
Susan Sarandon as a gutsy, vib
rant gypsy woman, and new
comer Eric Roberts as the son
who realizes that the gypsies
must adapt to the 20th century.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Palo Alto Square ★★★★
This nearly flawless thriller,
which deals with an invasion by
aliens who come in the form of
harmless-looking flowers, will
have you looking suspiciously at
every vegetable in your re
frigerator. lOTBS is set in San
Francisco, and seldom has the
city looked more beautiful than
here as the control center for the
take-over of the human race.
Donald Sutherland and Brooke
Adams star as two people who
are desperately trying to keep
their own identities; Leonard
Nimoy is the villain who works to
take them away. Phil Kaufman di
rected, stunningly.
