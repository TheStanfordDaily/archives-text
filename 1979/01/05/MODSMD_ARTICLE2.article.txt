# Senate studies budget, hospital billing
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Special Events pro
ject lost $27,000 last year and has
lost $10,000 so far this year, ASSU
Financial Manager Bill Lape re
ported to the ASSU Senate last
night.
In other action, the senate
voted to condemn the practice of
"double-billing" by the Medical
Centerin which patients are billed
for services rendered by salaried
physicians.
Lape's report, prepared by the
accounting firm of Hood and
Strong for the academic year end
ing Aug. 31, 1978, showed that
the project group suffered the
loss over $330,000 worth of trans
actions.
Lape admitted that "special
events is a big problem," but
added that the ASSU breaks even
as a whole, despite the loss.
A formal report giving a detailed
analysis of the problem will be
presented to the senate finance
committee next week and the full
senate the week following in
order for the body to consider
possible action.
Last year, three of the 13 ASSU
project groups showed a loss:
Special Events, the Flicks ($8000)
and the Restaurant Guide ($5O).
All together, the 13 groups
showed a profit of $M),0()0. The
net budget of the entire operation
was $1.2 million, according to
Lape.

Lape said he is also studying the
possibility of eliminating the
travel service because lower air
fares are making it less expensive
to fly with regular coach fares than
on an ASSU charter flight.
The senate passed their resolu
tion condemning the Medical
Center's billing practice after a
presentation by Eugene Dong,
professor of cardiovascular
surgery here. Dong was invited to
the meeting by Sen. Geoff Baskir.
Dong in criticizing the Center's
present practices told the senate
that the Center sends out bills to
patients charging them for treat
ment from doctors who are
salaried employees of the Center.
He said that this money comes
under the control of the Board of
Trustees, which is a group of
non-doctors.
Dong said that it is against
California law for a group of non
professionals to receive the fees
collected for professional medical
services.
Senators Erik Thompson and
Baskir said that they had invited a
spokesman from the Medical
Center administration to argue
their side of the case before the
senate, but that no such spokes
man came to the meeting.
The senate also passed a resolu
tion inviting a member of the
Medical Center's administration
to present its viewpoint to the se
nate at a future meeting.
At the start of the meeting,

chairperson Peter Stamos praised
the senate for regularly meeting in
committees autumn quarter. He
said that this greatly enhanced the
efficiency of the senate. He also
commended the new districting
plan which sends senators into
the dorms to meet with students.
"It makes us the authoritative
voice of student opinion," he
said.
The senate unanimously passed
what Sen. Dave Steuer termed an
"obviously superb motion," au
thorizing the Academic Affairs

Committee to investigate the Ath
letic Department's decision to
ban beverage containers being
brought into Stanford Stadium.
A resolution forming a commit
tee to study the feasibility of light
ing the tennis courts on campus
was also overwhelmingly passed.
Its author, Sen. Ron Johnson, said
that a committee of one senator,
four students at-large, and one
representative from the Athletic
Department might provide the
impetus needed to get the lights
built.

professor of cardiovascular
surgery here. Dong was invited to
the meeting by Sen. Geoff Baskir.
Dong in criticizing the Center's
present practices told the senate
that the Center sends out bills to
patients charging them for treat
ment from doctors who are
salaried employees of the Center.
He said that this money comes
under the control of the Board of
Trustees, which is a group of
non-doctors.
Dong said that it is against
California law for a group of non
professionals to receive the fees
collected for professional medical
services.
Senators Erik Thompson and
Baskir said that they had invited a
spokesman from the Medical
Center administration to argue
their side of the case before the
senate, but that no such spokes
man came to the meeting.
The senate also passed a resolu
tion inviting a member of the
Medical Center's administration
to present its viewpoint to the se
nate at a future meeting.
At the start of the meeting,

chairperson Peter Stamos praised
the senate for regularly meeting in
committees autumn quarter. He
said that this greatly enhanced the
efficiency of the senate. He also
commended the new districting
plan which sends senators into
the dorms to meet with students.
"It makes us the authoritative
voice of student opinion," he
said.
The senate unanimously passed
what Sen. Dave Steuer termed an
"obviously superb motion," au
thorizing the Academic Affairs

Committee to investigate the Ath
letic Department's decision to
ban beverage containers being
brought into Stanford Stadium.
A resolution forming a commit
tee to study the feasibility of light
ing the tennis courts on campus
was also overwhelmingly passed.
Its author, Sen. Ron Johnson, said
that a committee of one senator,
four students at-large, and one
representative from the Athletic
Department might provide the
impetus needed to get the lights
built.
