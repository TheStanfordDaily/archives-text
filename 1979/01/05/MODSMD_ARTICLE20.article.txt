# Flat 1st half deflates Cardinals
## SPORTS 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Unable to eliminate the
stigma of first-half ballhandling
deficiencies, Stanford fell to
the University of Arizona,
74-64, at McKale Memorial
Center in Tucson.
The outcome left each team
with a 1-2 record in Pac-10 Con
ference play. The victory tasted
particularly sweet to the
Wildcats, as it was their first
ever conference triumph since
entering the league this sea
son.
For the first 20 minutes,
however, the Cardinals ap
peared to be from a much
lower league than Arizona.
After Paul Ciovacchini's basket
from the top of the key gave
Stanford a 10-8 lead, the
Wildcats went on an 11 -2 spree
climaxed by center Larry De
mic's turn-around jumper to
take a 19-12 advantage.
Matters soon worsened as
usually reliable guard Paul
Giovacchini committed three
consecutive turnovers, help
ing Arizona to a 29-15 lead.
"They were cancerous," said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso of
the miscues. "By far the first

half was our worst half of the
year. We took ourselves out of
the ballgame and put us in a
struggling situation."
The slippery-fingered dis
ease wasn't confined to
Giovacchini, as Brian Welch,
Tom Schmalzried and Wolfe
Perry also made offensive mis
takes.
The halftime statistics accu
rately told the story: 17 turnov
ers for the Cards, just five for
Arizona.
Donald Mellon's jumper in
creased the Wildcats' cushion
to 39-22 early in the second
half, but Stanford roused itself
and actually controlled the
game's tempo thereafter.
Two free throws by Wolfe
Perry put the Cards within
45-34, and a Perry 18-footer
closed the gap to 64-55. By that
time, unfortunately, less than
three minutes remained.
"We can't say we were dis
pleased with our overall per
formance, because we did
what we wanted to do in the
second half," Dißiaso con
ceded.
Arizona guard Joe Nehls
broke his nose in the first half

whilegoing fora loose ball, but
the pain didn't stop him from
scoring a team-high 20 points.
Demic was also a destructive
force, hitting all nine of his
shots from the floor and grab
bing 10 rebounds. Mellon's 11
boards led the Wildcats, who
also received fine playmaking
in the form of 13 assists from
guard Russell Brown.
Kimberly Belton came
through with another stalwart
effort for the Cards with 20
points, four assists and a
game-high 16 rebounds. Perry
finished with 18, making this
the 11th time in 12 games that
he has scored 17 points or bet
ter.
Tomorrow Stanford moves
to Tempe where it faces
Arizona State. The game will be
televised live by KRON (Ch. 4)

Card sophomore forward Jeff Ryan dives for a loose ball in Stanford's 103-81 victory over Harvard Dec.
23 as teammate Orlando Ward (42) looks on. Forward Don Fleming (32) of the Crimson is also going for
the ball. Last night against Arizona most of the loose balls strayed from Stanford hands as the Wildcats
triumphed, 74-64.
Unable to eliminate the
stigma of first-half ballhandling
deficiencies, Stanford fell to
the University of Arizona,
74-64, at McKale Memorial
Center in Tucson.
The outcome left each team
with a 1-2 record in Pac-10 Con
ference play. The victory tasted
particularly sweet to the
Wildcats, as it was their first
ever conference triumph since
entering the league this sea
son.
For the first 20 minutes,
however, the Cardinals ap
peared to be from a much
lower league than Arizona.
After Paul Ciovacchini's basket
from the top of the key gave
Stanford a 10-8 lead, the
Wildcats went on an 11 -2 spree
climaxed by center Larry De
mic's turn-around jumper to
take a 19-12 advantage.
Matters soon worsened as
usually reliable guard Paul
Giovacchini committed three
consecutive turnovers, help
ing Arizona to a 29-15 lead.
"They were cancerous," said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso of
the miscues. "By far the first

half was our worst half of the
year. We took ourselves out of
the ballgame and put us in a
struggling situation."
The slippery-fingered dis
ease wasn't confined to
Giovacchini, as Brian Welch,
Tom Schmalzried and Wolfe
Perry also made offensive mis
takes.
The halftime statistics accu
rately told the story: 17 turnov
ers for the Cards, just five for
Arizona.
Donald Mellon's jumper in
creased the Wildcats' cushion
to 39-22 early in the second
half, but Stanford roused itself
and actually controlled the
game's tempo thereafter.
Two free throws by Wolfe
Perry put the Cards within
45-34, and a Perry 18-footer
closed the gap to 64-55. By that
time, unfortunately, less than
three minutes remained.
"We can't say we were dis
pleased with our overall per
formance, because we did
what we wanted to do in the
second half," Dißiaso con
ceded.
Arizona guard Joe Nehls
broke his nose in the first half

whilegoing fora loose ball, but
the pain didn't stop him from
scoring a team-high 20 points.
Demic was also a destructive
force, hitting all nine of his
shots from the floor and grab
bing 10 rebounds. Mellon's 11
boards led the Wildcats, who
also received fine playmaking
in the form of 13 assists from
guard Russell Brown.
Kimberly Belton came
through with another stalwart
effort for the Cards with 20
points, four assists and a
game-high 16 rebounds. Perry
finished with 18, making this
the 11th time in 12 games that
he has scored 17 points or bet
ter.
Tomorrow Stanford moves
to Tempe where it faces
Arizona State. The game will be
televised live by KRON (Ch. 4)
at 2:30 p.m.
