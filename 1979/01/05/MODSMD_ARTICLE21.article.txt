# Women cagers stay undefeated

### ROBERT RUDY 
Pre-registration in Maples
Pavilion may have forced Stan
ford's women's basketball
team to play its Wednesday
night game in Roble Gym, but
it did not prevent them from
registering their sixth straight
win of the season, a 93-51 vic
tory over Arizona.
The game was decided just
barely after it began. With the
score 6-4 in favor of Stanford
after three minutes of play, the
unbeaten Cardinals ran off 19
unanswered points against the
Wildcats. The pace hardly let

up as Stanford went on to a
55-21 halftime lead that saw the
Cards shoot an incredible 74
percent from the field.
Jeanne Ruark led the Cardi
nal scoring attack with 25
points, 19 of those coming in
the first half. The 6-0 freshman
continued to display her fine
shooting style as she hit on 11
of 14 shots from the floor.
Kathy Murphy added a
season-high 16 points for Stan
ford and also pulled down six
rebounds.
To keep her players in
terested in the lopsided game,

Cardinal coach Dottie McCrea
told her players at halftime that
their goal for the second half
would be to hold Arizona to 45
points for the game.
Stanford didn't quite reach
their goal, but they played
sound defense nonetheless,
grabbing numerous steals and
forcing 26 Wildcat turnovers.
With Stanford's conference
opener against USF less than a
week away, McCrea feels that
her young squad — she has
nine freshmen on a squad of 13
— is making rapid progress.
"They are much more
aware," she said, "of what they
are doing and why they are
doing it. They have much more
of a team concept now."
Stanford's 42-point margin of
victory was their widest of the
season. They have been av
eraging beating their oppo
nents by an average of almost
30 points a game, thus giving
McCrea a chance to play many
of her reserves for long periods
of time.
"They (the reserves) are
more experienced now," she
said, "I wouldn't be afraid to
put them in the game in a tight
situation."
After playing all their previ
ous home games in massive
Maples Pavilion, it was a bit of a
switch to play in rustic Roble
Gym. A near capacity crowd of
about 120 people lined the
walls;

"It's the first time this season
we've packed the house," said
McCrea.
The woman cagers will be re
turning to Maples ths evening,
hosting Arizona St.at 8:00 p.m.
