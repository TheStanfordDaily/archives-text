### DIANNE CAHOON 
The men's and women's swimming teams
stroked to team victories in two acclaimed
meets during an 18-day conditioning sojourn in
Hawaii over the holidays.
Without the services of standouts Linda Jezek
and Kim Peyton, the women nonetheless swept
both the Wahine Invitational and the Aulea Invi
tational. Valerie Lee and Libby Beaudet each
captured three individual wins at the Wahine
meet. Lee concentrated her energies on the
grueling 200 yard butterfly (2:06.1), and the 200
(1:54.5) and 500 (5:01.4) freestyle events.
Beaudet outswam the field in the 200 (2:11.3)
and the 400 (4:29.8) individual medleys and the
200breaststroke(2:28.9). At Aulea, Beaudetwon
the 100 yard breaststroke in 1:10.7 and finished
second in the 400 IM (4:37.8).
The men also basked in the sun and the
limelight at the Kaneohe Marine base site of the
Aulea Invitational. Mike Bruner earned the

men's high point honors by winning the 200 free
(1:44.5), the 500 tree (4:40.1), the 1650 free
(16:03.8) and the 200 fly (1:52.0). Sam Franklin
saw gold in the 100 tly (52.1), and Wade Flemens
touched the wall first in the 200 backstoke
(1:56.7). Tom O'Brian churned to a 400 IM win
ning time of 4:16.3 while Joe Jiminez won the
100 breaststroke in 1:02.4.
Considering that the team members practiced
at least once a day for up to 10,000 yards, Coach
Jim Gaughran termed their performance "very
successful." He underscored the swimmers' en
thusiastic fundraising efforts, such as stadium
cleaning, a raffle and the sponsorship of an AAU
meet, for this trip.
The teams will compete tomorrow only in the
two-day California Invitational at Berkeley,
which begins today. Meet officials will compile
no team results, so Gaughran plans to "just to
see where we stand individually at this point in
time."
