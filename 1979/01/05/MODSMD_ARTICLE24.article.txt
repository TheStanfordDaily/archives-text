Shah leaves Iranian capital
Tehran, Iran — The Shah of Iran left this capital
city yesterday after weeks of near-seclusion in his
palace and traveled to a nearby ski resort for two
days of rest, a top aide said.
Meanwhile, the shah's staunchest foe, Shiite
Moslem leader Ayatullah Khomaini, in exile out
side Paris, called for the monarch to be jailed for
life for his "crimes."
The airborne exodus of Americans and other
foreigners from this riot-torn country continued,
but the violence tapered off as Iranians awaited
developments in the fast-moving political situa
tion.
Before leaving with his family for the mountain
resort of Jajroud, 40 miles east of Tehran, Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi signed a royal decree
appointing opposition leader Shahpour Bakhtiar
prime minister, the royal aide, Ardeshir Zahedi,
told reporters.
The shah asked Bakhtiar last week to form a
civilian Cabinet that would replace Iran's military
government and try to quell the year-long unrest
sparked by anti-shah protests.
Cambodian war continues
Bangkok, Thailand — Cambodian Premier Pol Pot
said today that Vietnam with Soviet support is mak
ing an all-out effort to conquer Cambodia but "we
pledge to fight them to the end to keep our na
tional prestige."
Political analysts in Bangkok said Cambodian
defenses apparently are folding under Vietnamese
ground attacks and air strikes.
The analysts here said that Cambodian rebels,
who are also striking against government forces,
seemed to be planning a military attack on the
capital, but added it was difficult to evaluate the
conflict without first-hand information. The rebels
were last reported besieging Kompany Cham, 45
miles northeast of the capital on the Mekong
River.
In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim called for restraint by <tlI concerned.
The border conflict increasingly mirrored the
political struggle between the Soviet Union and
China, with Vietnam responding to Cambodian
charges of aggression at the United Nations.
Teng: Force possible in Taiwan
Peking— Senior Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping
said today he hoped Taiwan could be returned
peacefully to China this year but refused to rule
out taking control of the island by other means.

He told American correspondents at a Peking
news conference that China "will be taking a vari
ety ot measures in different forms" to discuss the
question with Taiwan authorities and in particular
Nationalist Chinese President Chiang Ching-kuo.
Teng emphasized that Peking's goal is to achieve
a tranquil reunification of Taiwan and the main
land — divided for 30 years — but noted there are
"other than peaceful means."
To rule out other means, he said, would be to tie
China's hands.

Cleveland — A $675,000 settlement and a state
ment of regret brought an end yesterday to the
long and bitter legal battle waged by the victims of
the Ohio National Guard bullets fired at Kent State
University in 1970.
The settlement was read into the record in U.S.
District Court, ending a retrial of a five-year-old
damage suit stemming from the shootings.
It included a statement on behalf of the defen
dants — Gov. lames Rhodes and 27 present and
former National Guard members — expressing re
gret and saying that "the tragedy of May 4, 1970,
should not have occurred," but denying liability
for the shootings.
The biggest part ot the settlement, $350,000,
goes to Dean Kahler, now 28, who was paralyzed
below the waist during the clash between
guardsmen and students who were protesting the
movement of U.S. forces into Cambodia. The
other eight wounded get amounts ranging from
$15,000 to $42,000.
The families of the slain students receive $15,000
each. Also included in the settlement is $50,000 for
lawyers' fees and $25,000 for the lawyers' out-of
pocket expenses.
Brown may seek new tax cut
Sacramento — Gov. )erry Brown is privately tel
ling lawmakers he may ask for an additional $1
billion tax cut this year, Senate President pro tem
lames Mills said yesterday.
Brown has hinted the formal announcement of
the tax cut plan may come soon. In a television
interview yesterday, Brown appeared to be hinting
at such an announcement during his inaugural
address, which will be televised statewide next
Monday.
This development could bring a simmering bat
tle between the Democratic governor and liberal

leaders ot his party out into the open if the tax cut
is financed by cuts in social programs.
Brown said in the television interview that he
"might" ask for still another state tax cut soon.
Study links estrogen use, cancer
New York — Doctors must take a harder look at
the danger of uterine cancer before prescribing
estrogens for women in menopause, says a doctor
whose study found a link between the two.
The lohns Hopkins University study, largest of
its kind to date, said women who took estrogens at
menopause ran a five-fold greater risk of cancer of
the uterus than non-users.
Women who took the drug for more than five
years ran a risk 16 times higher than non-users, it
said.
Dr. Paul Stolley, who directed the study, said the
risks remained low for short-term use of the drug,
such as six months to a year.
Estrogens have been prescribed since the 1930s
to alleviate certain forms of distress, such as hot
flashes or a drying of the mucous membrane, ex
perienced by many women during or after
menopause.
The )ohns Hopkins study, which involved I H9
women, is the sixth to draw a link between uterine
cancer and estrogen, and disputes arguments by
Vale University researchers in November who
suggested that the link was the result of faulty
statistical work.
Stocks advance again
New York — The stock market tallied its third
broad advance in as many days as violence tapered
off in Iran and as a Federal Reserve Board member
gave an optimistic forecast for the troubled dollar.
Several analysts noted that large institutions,
rich with cash from a December selling spree,
apparently returned to the market this week as
buyers.
The Dow Jones average of <0 industrials, ahead
by more than 12 points at mid-afternoon, closed
up 8.75 at 826.14. New York Stock Exchange vol
ume rose to 33.29 million shares from 29.18 million
Wednesday.

Shah leaves Iranian capital
Tehran, Iran — The Shah of Iran left this capital
city yesterday after weeks of near-seclusion in his
palace and traveled to a nearby ski resort for two
days of rest, a top aide said.
Meanwhile, the shah's staunchest foe, Shiite
Moslem leader Ayatullah Khomaini, in exile out
side Paris, called for the monarch to be jailed for
life for his "crimes."
The airborne exodus of Americans and other
foreigners from this riot-torn country continued,
but the violence tapered off as Iranians awaited
developments in the fast-moving political situa
tion.
Before leaving with his family for the mountain
resort of Jajroud, 40 miles east of Tehran, Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi signed a royal decree
appointing opposition leader Shahpour Bakhtiar
prime minister, the royal aide, Ardeshir Zahedi,
told reporters.
The shah asked Bakhtiar last week to form a
civilian Cabinet that would replace Iran's military
government and try to quell the year-long unrest
sparked by anti-shah protests.
Cambodian war continues
Bangkok, Thailand — Cambodian Premier Pol Pot
said today that Vietnam with Soviet support is mak
ing an all-out effort to conquer Cambodia but "we
pledge to fight them to the end to keep our na
tional prestige."
Political analysts in Bangkok said Cambodian
defenses apparently are folding under Vietnamese
ground attacks and air strikes.
The analysts here said that Cambodian rebels,
who are also striking against government forces,
seemed to be planning a military attack on the
capital, but added it was difficult to evaluate the
conflict without first-hand information. The rebels
were last reported besieging Kompany Cham, 45
miles northeast of the capital on the Mekong
River.
In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim called for restraint by <tlI concerned.
The border conflict increasingly mirrored the
political struggle between the Soviet Union and
China, with Vietnam responding to Cambodian
charges of aggression at the United Nations.
Teng: Force possible in Taiwan
Peking— Senior Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping
said today he hoped Taiwan could be returned
peacefully to China this year but refused to rule
out taking control of the island by other means.

He told American correspondents at a Peking
news conference that China "will be taking a vari
ety ot measures in different forms" to discuss the
question with Taiwan authorities and in particular
Nationalist Chinese President Chiang Ching-kuo.
Teng emphasized that Peking's goal is to achieve
a tranquil reunification of Taiwan and the main
land — divided for 30 years — but noted there are
"other than peaceful means."
To rule out other means, he said, would be to tie
China's hands.

the Ohio National Guard bullets fired at Kent State
University in 1970.

dants — Gov. lames Rhodes and 27 present and
former National Guard members — expressing re
gret and saying that "the tragedy of May 4, 1970,
should not have occurred," but denying liability
for the shootings.
The biggest part ot the settlement, $350,000,
goes to Dean Kahler, now 28, who was paralyzed
below the waist during the clash between
guardsmen and students who were protesting the
movement of U.S. forces into Cambodia. The
other eight wounded get amounts ranging from
$15,000 to $42,000.
The families of the slain students receive $15,000
each. Also included in the settlement is $50,000 for
lawyers' fees and $25,000 for the lawyers' out-of

Brown may seek new tax cut
Sacramento — Gov. )erry Brown is privately tel

billion tax cut this year, Senate President pro tem
lames Mills said yesterday.
Brown has hinted the formal announcement of
the tax cut plan may come soon. In a television
interview yesterday, Brown appeared to be hinting

Study links estrogen use, cancer
New York — Doctors must take a harder look at
the danger of uterine cancer before prescribing
estrogens for women in menopause, says a doctor
whose study found a link between the two.
The lohns Hopkins University study, largest of
its kind to date, said women who took estrogens at
menopause ran a five-fold greater risk of cancer of
the uterus than non-users.
Women who took the drug for more than five
years ran a risk 16 times higher than non-users, it
said.
Dr. Paul Stolley, who directed the study, said the
risks remained low for short-term use of the drug,
such as six months to a year.
Estrogens have been prescribed since the 1930s
to alleviate certain forms of distress, such as hot
flashes or a drying of the mucous membrane, ex
perienced by many women during or after
menopause.
The )ohns Hopkins study, which involved I H9
women, is the sixth to draw a link between uterine
cancer and estrogen, and disputes arguments by
Vale University researchers in November who
suggested that the link was the result of faulty
statistical work.
