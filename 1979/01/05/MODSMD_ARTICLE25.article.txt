# Faculty retention hurt by housing shortage
## 
### KATHY ANDREWS 
Severe housing problems may
negatively influence the retention of
old laculty members and limit the re
cruitment of new faculty members,
said chairman William Chace at the
Academic Council's meeting yester
day.
Chairman of the Joint Subcommit
tee on Faculty-Staff FHousing Martin
Andersori said in his report to the
council that the replies to a ques
tionnaire recently distributed to all
deans and department chairmen in
dicate that "there is a very sincere
and deep-felt need forchanges in the
system."
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy said the limited
supply and the high cost of housing
are both local and national issues. A
constellation of local political forces
have made housing "a hot political
issue" for residents in the immediate
vicinity, he said.
Massy outlined current and pros
pective finance and supply programs
forfaculty and staff housing, explain
ing that newly-adopted University
loan policies contain several options
to make housing financing easier for
future staff members.
Massy said that to further facilitate
financing, the University was con
sidering such possible future
strategies as an arrangement with
one or more local banks to facilitate
transferrals of mortgages between
houses on campus, and to encour
age special deferments for interest
payments on second mortgages for
new recruits.
Massy also said site studies for the'
planned Peter Coutts housing de
velopment are underway. It is prob
able that approximately 150 single
family or townhouse units will be
constructed, with the possibility of
equity share valuation of the land.
The concerns of visiting scholars
and blue collar employees, as well as
the most desirable "portfolio," or
mix of apartment, townhouse and
single-family houses were also dis
cussed at the council meeting.

With regard to housing supply,
Massy said 611 single-family houses
and 82 condominiums, in total, are
now occupied by faculty and staff
members.
According to Anderson, four out
of seven tenured faculty members
reside on campus, as compared to
one in five untenured faculty mem
bers.
Massy said bench-mark studies
have shown that only a 5 percent dif
ferential exists between the cost of
University residences and compara
ble open-market residences.
