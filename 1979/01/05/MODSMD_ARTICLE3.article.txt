# New brand of student activism infuses growing Hillel
## 
### RUTHANN RICHTER 
The era of student activism may have ended with the '60s, but
today there is a new brand of activism that is infusing the
Stanford Hillel, the Jewish student organization.
Most people would be surprised to learn that Hillel is the
largest student organization on campus outside of the ASSU —
largest in that it schedules more activities each week and at
tracts more students than any other group except ASSU.
But those who are familiar with today's Hillel might be
equally surprised to know that just three years ago, it had a
corps group of about a dozen students. At that time, Hillel was
so barely visible that few were aware of its existence, and even
fewer cared.
"Stanford until that time lived up to its image as a place to
escape your Judaism . . .You didn't come here to be Jewish,"
said Hillel Director Rabbi Mark Cartun.
As Debbie Weissman, Hillel's folk dance teacher, said,
"People who were Jewish tried to avoid that fact as much as
possible. People wouldn't go to Hillel because they considered
themselves 'normal' and only 'weirdos' went to Hillel."
Since that time, Hillel's two-member staff and $25,000 budget
has burgeoned into an organization with a budget of $80,000 and
a staff of four full-time and four part-time workers, along with
200 active student volunteers. A student-run board of 35 serves
a student mailing list of 1000 and its three-room basement office
in the Old Union has expanded to include a library and a kosher
kitchen.
It sponsors a program-a-day, including luncheons, folkdanc
ing, religious services, Hebrew conversation, a deli and sports
events, among others.
What has happened to the Hillel here has been happening to
theB7 B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundations nationwide, although toa
lesser degree, according to Rabbi Samuel Fishman.
Fishman, the organization's associate international director
in the Washington, D.C. headquarters, said an average of five
new Hillels have sprung up each year on campuses across the
country. Since 1967, the national budget has literally doubled,
he said.
Fishman viewed 1967, the year of the six-day Mideast war, as a
watershed for "heightened Jewish identity and campus ac
tivism.''

At Stanford after the war, "all of a sudden, people who had
latent identities came out to express themselves in very vocal
ways. . .Jewish students who had never shown anv interest
came out in droves" to demonstrate and distribute leaflets in
White Plaza, said Rabbi Charles Familant, the Hillel director
here from 1965 to 1975.
Coincident with the events in the Mideast was the evolution
of a national phenomenon that drove all ethnic minorities —
blacks, Chicanos and Jews alike — in search of their "Roots."
"That was a time when ethnicity became a legitimate and
desirable goal," said Rabbi Fishman.
For the first time, Stanford began to respond to the pressure
for change. The University's "unofficial policy of quotas" faded
and "they went out of their way to recruit minorities, including
Jews," said Familant.
Familant estimated that when he came in 1965, there were4oo
to 500 Jewish students on campus. Now the figure has jumped
to 1 500.
But the numbers and the theories do not give the full story
behind the revolution at Hillel. Many believe that Rabbi Car
tun's coming in August 1975 has had a galvanizing effect.
"Cartun injected new life into Hillel . . .He helped set up all
these new programs and encouraged students to become in
volved," said Robert Smith, a 1977 graduate of the University.
"The spread of activities has mushroomed by the sheer ap
plication of his energy," added English Prof. John Felstiner.
"He has the kind of charisma that attracts a lot of people,"
said Barbara Bentkowsky, Cartun's assistant.
"He is a wonderful teacher. . .Mark is very smart and very
well-read on the one hand and very easy-going on the other,"
said Felstiner, who became involved in the community about
the time Cartun came to Hillel.
His predecessor, Familant, was of a different temperament
and philosophy. Familant said he recognized that students
were "apathetic," but he said he believed that "there was no
way of getting them involved." Instead, he said he felt there
was a "need for people to do their own thing and express
themselves in their own way."
Coinciding with the changeover in directors was the arrival

on campus of several professors who were interested in Hillel
or had been active elsewhere. A kind of snowball effect occur
red with a Faculty Advisory Committee being set up at Cartun's
initiative.
Robert Rosenzweig, Vice President for Public Affairs who has
been at the University tor 16years, said it was at that point when
he first became involved. He is now chairman of the Faculty
Advisory Committee.
"The committee shows the students and the community that
there is a level of faculty involvement and interest," he said.
In general, Rosenzweig said he became "aware of a change in
spirit. The atmospheie was much livelier, more spirited,
warmer."
According to Rosenzweig, one of the "nagging problems"
facing Hillel is one that bedevils all organizations of its kind —
fundraising. Hillel receives no University support, outside of its
building facility. The national organization and the San Francisco
lewish Welfare Federation (JWF) together put up half the
budget for the group. The rest comes from donations and
activities fees. There is no formal membership and hence, no
membership dues.
Cartun said most of the funding goes toward staff and stu
dent participation in training workshops.
"My primary goal is to train lews and inspire them and give
them a feeling of commitment and investment," he said.
Fishman said the JWF only recently has given Hillel its sup
port because it "saw this as an opportunity to invest in its own
future growth."
But that future concerns Cartun. He said he would like to
believe the growth figures, but "I'm always aware of the pes
simistic predictions" regarding conversion, assimilation, in
termarriage, self-hate and apathy.
The future, he said, will depend upon political and economic
changes in the Mideast. Forone thing, he explained, if peace in
Israel becomes a reality, it would no longer serve as a rallying
point for American )ewry.
In the meantime, Cartun said he is banking on Hillel and the
diversity it offers. As he said, it involves "everybody from anti-
Israel radicals to the radically pro-Israel. . .from the atheistic to
the Orthodox. . .They are all involved because there are places
for them."

lewish Welfare Federation (JWF) together put up half the
budget for the group. The rest comes from donations and
activities fees. There is no formal membership and hence, no
membership dues.
Cartun said most of the funding goes toward staff and stu
dent participation in training workshops.
"My primary goal is to train lews and inspire them and give
them a feeling of commitment and investment," he said.
Fishman said the JWF only recently has given Hillel its sup
port because it "saw this as an opportunity to invest in its own
future growth."
But that future concerns Cartun. He said he would like to
believe the growth figures, but "I'm always aware of the pes
simistic predictions" regarding conversion, assimilation, in
termarriage, self-hate and apathy.
The future, he said, will depend upon political and economic
changes in the Mideast. Forone thing, he explained, if peace in
Israel becomes a reality, it would no longer serve as a rallying
point for American )ewry.
In the meantime, Cartun said he is banking on Hillel and the
diversity it offers. As he said, it involves "everybody from anti-
Israel radicals to the radically pro-Israel. . .from the atheistic to
the Orthodox. . .They are all involved because there are places
for them."
The era of student activism may have ended with the '60s, but
today there is a new brand of activism that is infusing the
Stanford Hillel, the Jewish student organization.
Most people would be surprised to learn that Hillel is the
largest student organization on campus outside of the ASSU —
largest in that it schedules more activities each week and at
tracts more students than any other group except ASSU.
But those who are familiar with today's Hillel might be
equally surprised to know that just three years ago, it had a
corps group of about a dozen students. At that time, Hillel was
so barely visible that few were aware of its existence, and even
fewer cared.
"Stanford until that time lived up to its image as a place to
escape your Judaism . . .You didn't come here to be Jewish,"
said Hillel Director Rabbi Mark Cartun.
As Debbie Weissman, Hillel's folk dance teacher, said,
"People who were Jewish tried to avoid that fact as much as
possible. People wouldn't go to Hillel because they considered
themselves 'normal' and only 'weirdos' went to Hillel."
Since that time, Hillel's two-member staff and $25,000 budget
has burgeoned into an organization with a budget of $80,000 and
a staff of four full-time and four part-time workers, along with
200 active student volunteers. A student-run board of 35 serves
a student mailing list of 1000 and its three-room basement office
in the Old Union has expanded to include a library and a kosher
kitchen.
It sponsors a program-a-day, including luncheons, folkdanc
ing, religious services, Hebrew conversation, a deli and sports
events, among others.
What has happened to the Hillel here has been happening to
theB7 B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundations nationwide, although toa
lesser degree, according to Rabbi Samuel Fishman.
Fishman, the organization's associate international director
in the Washington, D.C. headquarters, said an average of five
new Hillels have sprung up each year on campuses across the
country. Since 1967, the national budget has literally doubled,
he said.
Fishman viewed 1967, the year of the six-day Mideast war, as a
watershed for "heightened Jewish identity and campus ac
tivism.''

At Stanford after the war, "all of a sudden, people who had
latent identities came out to express themselves in very vocal
ways. . .Jewish students who had never shown anv interest
came out in droves" to demonstrate and distribute leaflets in
White Plaza, said Rabbi Charles Familant, the Hillel director
here from 1965 to 1975.
Coincident with the events in the Mideast was the evolution
of a national phenomenon that drove all ethnic minorities —
blacks, Chicanos and Jews alike — in search of their "Roots."
"That was a time when ethnicity became a legitimate and
desirable goal," said Rabbi Fishman.
For the first time, Stanford began to respond to the pressure
for change. The University's "unofficial policy of quotas" faded
and "they went out of their way to recruit minorities, including
Jews," said Familant.
Familant estimated that when he came in 1965, there were4oo
to 500 Jewish students on campus. Now the figure has jumped
to 1 500.
But the numbers and the theories do not give the full story
behind the revolution at Hillel. Many believe that Rabbi Car
tun's coming in August 1975 has had a galvanizing effect.
"Cartun injected new life into Hillel . . .He helped set up all
these new programs and encouraged students to become in
volved," said Robert Smith, a 1977 graduate of the University.
"The spread of activities has mushroomed by the sheer ap
plication of his energy," added English Prof. John Felstiner.
"He has the kind of charisma that attracts a lot of people,"
said Barbara Bentkowsky, Cartun's assistant.
"He is a wonderful teacher. . .Mark is very smart and very
well-read on the one hand and very easy-going on the other,"
said Felstiner, who became involved in the community about
the time Cartun came to Hillel.
His predecessor, Familant, was of a different temperament
and philosophy. Familant said he recognized that students
were "apathetic," but he said he believed that "there was no
way of getting them involved." Instead, he said he felt there
was a "need for people to do their own thing and express
themselves in their own way."
Coinciding with the changeover in directors was the arrival

on campus of several professors who were interested in Hillel
or had been active elsewhere. A kind of snowball effect occur
red with a Faculty Advisory Committee being set up at Cartun's
initiative.
Robert Rosenzweig, Vice President for Public Affairs who has
been at the University tor 16years, said it was at that point when
he first became involved. He is now chairman of the Faculty
Advisory Committee.
"The committee shows the students and the community that
there is a level of faculty involvement and interest," he said.
In general, Rosenzweig said he became "aware of a change in
spirit. The atmospheie was much livelier, more spirited,
warmer."
According to Rosenzweig, one of the "nagging problems"
facing Hillel is one that bedevils all organizations of its kind —
fundraising. Hillel receives no University support, outside of its
building facility. The national organization and the San Francisco
lewish Welfare Federation (JWF) together put up half the
