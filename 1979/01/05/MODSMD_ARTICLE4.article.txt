# Lyman mum on candidacy for Ford Foundation post
## 
### IIM TRANQUADA 
Renewed speculation sparked by a
recent New York Times article that
said President Richard Lyman is one
of seven leading candidates for the
presidency of the Ford Foundation
caused Lyman to issue a carefully
worded statement yesterday reiterat
ing that he will say nothing of his
intentions until he hears directly
from the foundation.
"I have been asked whether I
would accept the presidency of the
Ford Foundation if it were to be of
fered," Lyman said in the written
statement. "To that I can only say that
I 've learned not to accept or decline a
job that has not been offered to me."
Lyman, stressing that "naturally
I'm anxious to limit as much as possi
ble the amount of gossip and rumor
that distracts us from the business of
tending to Stanford's affairs," said
nothing more definite, concluding
"this statement is all that I'm pre
pared to say on the matter at this
time."
Rumors
Rumors concerning Lyman and the
Ford Foundation presidency have
been circulating for several weeks.
On the Nov. 30 Campus Conference
on KZSU, Lyman told listeners that
he had heard the rumors, but had

heard nothing from the Foundation
itself, and said "I won't speculate on
something like this until it really
happens."
For the past year, the Foundation
has been conducting a nationwide
and largely secret search for a suc
cessor to current president
McGeorge Bundy, who announced
several years ago that he would retire
at age 68, which will happen this
spring.
New leadership
The search for a new president is
particularly significant as this will be
the first time in 13 years that the
foundation — the country's largest
and most influential private founda
tion — will assume new leadership.
A major factor behind the persis
tent rumors concerning Lyman's
candidacy is the fact that he declared
soon after he was inagurated as the
University's president in 1970 that 10
years was about long enough to
serve as head of a university.
But in yesterday's statement,
Lyman said, "I have not been looking
for ways to depart from the fascinat
ing and demanding job I have right
now at Stanford."
Wednesday's article in the New
York Times stated that "according to
various sources close to the search,"
Lyman heads a list of seven candi
dates, who are being "considered
seriously," which also includes
Thomas Ehrlich, a former dean of the
Law School here who now heads the
Legal Services Corporation, a federal
agency that provides free legal aid to
the poor.
The Times quoted Lyman as saying

he did not think there was "any
basis" to a rumor that he was the
leading candidate, and said he de
clined all further comment.
The Ford search committee of
seven Ford trustees has narrowed its
search to Lyman and the six other
candidates after considering "sev
eral hundred" other names repre
senting a wide variety of talents, ac
cording to the Times.
The foundation attempted to keep
the names being considered totally
secret, the Times said, taking such
stringent precautions that some of
the foundation's highest-ranking of
ficers have not been told any of the
candidate's names.
Such elaborate methods are due to
the importance of the successor to
the post that Bundy will vacate this
spring.
Influential role
The foundation — which has about
$2 billion in assets and spent $129.9
million during the last fiscal year —
often takes a leadership role among
other foundations, especially in an
era of depleted funds when founda
tions frequently pool their re
sources. The Ford Foundation is
often the first to commit money to
such a pool, the Times said.
And Bundy has made the future of
the foundation dependent on his
successor by keeping "the forward
commitments of 'he foundation to a
minimum so that the new president
would have as much leeway in mak
ing his proposals" as possible, the
Times quoted Alexander Fleard,
head of the presidential search
committee, as saying.

ing his proposals" as possible, the
Times quoted Alexander Fleard,
head of the presidential search
committee, as saying.
Renewed speculation sparked by a
recent New York Times article that
said President Richard Lyman is one
of seven leading candidates for the
presidency of the Ford Foundation
caused Lyman to issue a carefully
worded statement yesterday reiterat
ing that he will say nothing of his
intentions until he hears directly
from the foundation.
"I have been asked whether I
would accept the presidency of the
Ford Foundation if it were to be of
fered," Lyman said in the written
statement. "To that I can only say that
I 've learned not to accept or decline a
job that has not been offered to me."
Lyman, stressing that "naturally
I'm anxious to limit as much as possi
ble the amount of gossip and rumor
that distracts us from the business of
tending to Stanford's affairs," said
nothing more definite, concluding
"this statement is all that I'm pre
pared to say on the matter at this
time."
Rumors
Rumors concerning Lyman and the
Ford Foundation presidency have
been circulating for several weeks.
On the Nov. 30 Campus Conference
on KZSU, Lyman told listeners that
he had heard the rumors, but had

heard nothing from the Foundation
itself, and said "I won't speculate on
something like this until it really
happens."
For the past year, the Foundation
has been conducting a nationwide
and largely secret search for a suc
cessor to current president
McGeorge Bundy, who announced
several years ago that he would retire
at age 68, which will happen this
spring.
New leadership
The search for a new president is
particularly significant as this will be
the first time in 13 years that the
foundation — the country's largest
and most influential private founda
tion — will assume new leadership.
A major factor behind the persis
tent rumors concerning Lyman's
candidacy is the fact that he declared
soon after he was inagurated as the
University's president in 1970 that 10
years was about long enough to
serve as head of a university.
But in yesterday's statement,
Lyman said, "I have not been looking
for ways to depart from the fascinat
ing and demanding job I have right
now at Stanford."
Wednesday's article in the New
York Times stated that "according to
various sources close to the search,"
Lyman heads a list of seven candi
dates, who are being "considered
seriously," which also includes
Thomas Ehrlich, a former dean of the
Law School here who now heads the
Legal Services Corporation, a federal
agency that provides free legal aid to
the poor.
The Times quoted Lyman as saying

he did not think there was "any
basis" to a rumor that he was the
leading candidate, and said he de
clined all further comment.
The Ford search committee of
seven Ford trustees has narrowed its
search to Lyman and the six other
candidates after considering "sev
eral hundred" other names repre
senting a wide variety of talents, ac
cording to the Times.
The foundation attempted to keep
the names being considered totally
secret, the Times said, taking such
stringent precautions that some of
the foundation's highest-ranking of
ficers have not been told any of the
candidate's names.
Such elaborate methods are due to
the importance of the successor to
the post that Bundy will vacate this
spring.
Influential role
The foundation — which has about
$2 billion in assets and spent $129.9
million during the last fiscal year —
often takes a leadership role among
other foundations, especially in an
era of depleted funds when founda
tions frequently pool their re
sources. The Ford Foundation is
often the first to commit money to
such a pool, the Times said.
And Bundy has made the future of
the foundation dependent on his
successor by keeping "the forward
commitments of 'he foundation to a
minimum so that the new president
would have as much leeway in mak
ing his proposals" as possible, the
Times quoted Alexander Fleard,
head of the presidential search
committee, as saying.
