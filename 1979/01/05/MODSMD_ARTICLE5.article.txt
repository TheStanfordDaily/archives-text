# Two profs named to state medical board
## BMQA investigating private med schools, possible conflict of interest 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Two professors here have been
elected to major offices on the Board
of Medical Quality Assurance
(BMQA), a state agency currently in
vestigating the University for the al
leged violation of state codes.
Dr. Harry Oberhelman, professor
of surgery and head of the division of
general surgery, was elected BMQA
president for the 1979 term by board
members.
Dr. lames Lockhart, clinical assis
tant professor in the department of
family, community and preventative
medicine, was elected president of
BMQA's division of medical quality,
the division which Oberhelman said
is "dealing with the Stanford investi
gation."
Lockhart was unavailable for
comment yesterday.
Oberhelman said he would "make
every effort not to be involved" in
the issues concerning the BMQA's

investigation of the University.
"I will attempt to stay perfectly
clear of the matter until the issue is
resolved," he said.
UAP claims
BMQA began investigating the
medical school's billing procedures
more than a year ago after the Union
of American Physicians (UAP) and
other individuals claimed the medi
cal schools at Stanford, USC and
Loma Linda were all in violatiorwof
the California Business Code, which
states that medical schools may make
"no charge for professional services
rendered to patients."
However, Dr. Robert Weinmann,
president of UAP, has already com
plained that BMQA is guilty of a con
flict of interest because Robert Row
land, BMQA's executive director, is
the son of a former business man
ager here.
"I said once before that BMQA was
in Stanford's hip pocket," Wein
mann said yesterday after being told
of Oberhelman's and Lockhart's new
positions. "That was an understate
ment. Stanford's hip pocket and the
BMQA are the same thing.
'Miscarriage of power'
"It is obviously a gross hypocritical
miscarriage of the power of BMQA to
put these people into such appoint
ments and then to two-facedly claim
that an objective evaluation is being
made," he said.
All of the medical schools under
investigation have maintained that
the controversial portion of the
California Business Code, Section
2008, was never meant to apply to
private medical schools.
They cite the fact that schools in
the University of California system
may biil patients because they are
controlled by the state constitution
which overrides the business code.
The constitution contains no provi
sions similar to the code's Section
2008, said Larry Horton of the gov
ernment relations office here.
Faculty bills
Stanford further claims it is not in
violation because the institution
does not bill patients on behalf of the
University. According to Horton, the
University sends out bills on behalf
of the faculty physicians who are al
ready being paid faculty salaries. Col
lected fees to the University, are
turned over so the institution even
tually gets the money, but patients
are paying the individual physicians,
Horton said.
The entire corporate practice of
medicine issue will confront the
State Assembly health committee
)an. 15 in Sacramento as state legis
lators hear testimony from medical
schools and the UAP as well as from
other concerned citizens. Originally
this hearing was scheduled for last
month in San Francisco but was can
celled after the murders of Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor
Harvey Milk.
Debate
Legislators will then debate Pre
print Assembly Bill 19 which would
"provide that a clinic operated
primarily for the purpose of medical
education by a private nonprofit uni
versity medical school...may charge
for professional services rendered to
teaching patients by physicians and
surgeons."
The bill is being introduced by As
semblyman Art Torres (D-Los
Angeles), chairman of the health
committee. Gordon Duffy (R-
Flanford) originally introduced the
bill but recently withdrew it because
of his new appointment as vice
chairman of the ways and means
committee, his aide said yesterday.
