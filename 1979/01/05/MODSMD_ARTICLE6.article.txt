# Walsh named potential Raider coach
## Ulcer forces Madden resignation 
### 
Oakland (AP) — John Madden retired as
coach of the Oakland Raiders yesterday
and said, "I'm never going to coach
again."
His decision was made, Madden said at a
news conference, partly because of an
ulcer condition.
But, he added, "I gave it everything I
had, and it's basically that simple — I don't
have it anymore."
There was no immediateannouncement
of a successor to the 42-year-old Madden,
who compiled one of the best coaching
records in National Football League his
tory, 103-32-7, over his 10 seasons with the
Raiders.
Walsh mentioned
But Stanford head football coach Bill
Walsh was one of several candidates men
tioned yesterday as a successor to Mad
den.
Other names mentioned are Tom
Flores, the receivers coach oPthe Raiders,
and USC head football coach John Robin
son. No decision is expected to be made
for the Raiders' coaching position for at
least a week.
Walsh, who has taken his team to bowl
games in both of his seasons as head coach
here, has been mentioned as a candidate
for several NFL jobs including the San
Francisco 49ers and New York Giants.
"I haven't talked to the Raiders about a
job," Walsh told the Palo Alto Times yes
terday morning. "I am flattered to even be
mentioned as a candidate."

Walsh was an assistant coach with the
Raiders in 1968 before moving on to jobs
with the Cincinnati Bengals and San Diego
Chargers.
Madden fears
Madden's eyes filled with tears as he
spoke yesterday and he said at one point,
"Things like this are easy to talk about and
hard to do."
Al Davis, managing general partner of
the Raiders, said the team called the news
conference "with a touch of sorrow but
also with great respect for a job well done,
perhaps one of the best in the history of
football."
News that Madden would leave the
coaching post broke earlier in the day.
There also was a report that the Raiders
had traded quarterback Ken Stabler to Bal
timore for the Colts' Bert Jones, but Davis
said the story was "totally unfounded."
Madden stated emphatically that he had
no thoughts of moving to another NFL
team.
"I'm an Oakland Raider. I started with
them when I was young and I will always
be an Oakland Raider," he said. "I can't
understand people going from one place
to another."
Assistant coach
Madden served two years as an assistant
coach with the team, then an American
Football League franchise, before Davis
appointed him head coach 10 years ago.
This past season he became the 13th
coach in pro football history to reach 100

victories and his winning pecentage of
.763 is the highest in the 100-victory club.
Davis indicated there would be no deci
sion on a successor to Madden until "I
think about it for a week iu 10 days," and
he added that Madden was welcome to
stay in the organization.
"I want John to take a month off, two or
three months, whatever time he needs to
get the problem (the ulcer) under control,
and then whatever he wants to do with us,
he's welcome to do," Davis said.
Madden said his immediate plans were
"to do nothing."
The big, red-haired coach said he had
his mind virtually made up to retire before
the 1978 season ended, but that the deci
sion had nothing to do with the 9-7, his
worst with the team.
Pete Banazak, one of several veteran
Oakland players attending the news con
ference, said later, "I think this is the end
of an era, certainly in Oakland Raiders'
history."
Art Shell said, "I can understand how at
this time he's ready to retire. He's done
about everything a coach can do. You
name it, he's done it."
Madden, whose greatest triumph was
leading the 1976 Raiders to a Super Bowl
championship, said, "These were the 10
happiest years of my life and I just want to
be remembered for 10 great years."
He said he had no medical advice that he
should retire and that it was strictly his
own decision.

team.
"I'm an Oakland Raider. I started with
them when I was young and I will always
be an Oakland Raider," he said. "I can't
understand people going from one place
to another."
Assistant coach
Madden served two years as an assistant
coach with the team, then an American
Football League franchise, before Davis
appointed him head coach 10 years ago.
This past season he became the 13th
coach in pro football history to reach 100

victories and his winning pecentage of
.763 is the highest in the 100-victory club.
Davis indicated there would be no deci
sion on a successor to Madden until "I
think about it for a week iu 10 days," and
he added that Madden was welcome to
stay in the organization.
"I want John to take a month off, two or
three months, whatever time he needs to
get the problem (the ulcer) under control,
and then whatever he wants to do with us,
he's welcome to do," Davis said.
Madden said his immediate plans were
"to do nothing."
The big, red-haired coach said he had
his mind virtually made up to retire before
the 1978 season ended, but that the deci
sion had nothing to do with the 9-7, his
worst with the team.
Pete Banazak, one of several veteran
Oakland players attending the news con
ference, said later, "I think this is the end
of an era, certainly in Oakland Raiders'
history."
Art Shell said, "I can understand how at
this time he's ready to retire. He's done
about everything a coach can do. You
name it, he's done it."
Madden, whose greatest triumph was
leading the 1976 Raiders to a Super Bowl
championship, said, "These were the 10
happiest years of my life and I just want to
be remembered for 10 great years."
He said he had no medical advice that he
should retire and that it was strictly his
own decision.
Oakland (AP) — John Madden retired as
coach of the Oakland Raiders yesterday
and said, "I'm never going to coach
again."
His decision was made, Madden said at a
news conference, partly because of an
ulcer condition.
But, he added, "I gave it everything I
had, and it's basically that simple — I don't
have it anymore."
There was no immediateannouncement
of a successor to the 42-year-old Madden,
who compiled one of the best coaching
records in National Football League his
tory, 103-32-7, over his 10 seasons with the
Raiders.
Walsh mentioned
But Stanford head football coach Bill
Walsh was one of several candidates men
tioned yesterday as a successor to Mad
den.
Other names mentioned are Tom
Flores, the receivers coach oPthe Raiders,
and USC head football coach John Robin
son. No decision is expected to be made
for the Raiders' coaching position for at
least a week.
Walsh, who has taken his team to bowl
games in both of his seasons as head coach
here, has been mentioned as a candidate
for several NFL jobs including the San
Francisco 49ers and New York Giants.
"I haven't talked to the Raiders about a
job," Walsh told the Palo Alto Times yes
terday morning. "I am flattered to even be
mentioned as a candidate."

Walsh was an assistant coach with the
Raiders in 1968 before moving on to jobs
with the Cincinnati Bengals and San Diego
Chargers.
Madden fears
Madden's eyes filled with tears as he
spoke yesterday and he said at one point,
"Things like this are easy to talk about and
hard to do."
Al Davis, managing general partner of
the Raiders, said the team called the news
conference "with a touch of sorrow but
also with great respect for a job well done,
perhaps one of the best in the history of
football."
News that Madden would leave the
coaching post broke earlier in the day.
There also was a report that the Raiders
had traded quarterback Ken Stabler to Bal
timore for the Colts' Bert Jones, but Davis
said the story was "totally unfounded."
Madden stated emphatically that he had
no thoughts of moving to another NFL
team.
"I'm an Oakland Raider. I started with
them when I was young and I will always
be an Oakland Raider," he said. "I can't
understand people going from one place
to another."
