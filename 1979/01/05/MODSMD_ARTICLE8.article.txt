# Bookstore theft persists here, nationwide
## 
### CARL CHAMBERLIN 
"Before the day ended I
had successfully stolen
$64.37 worth of merchan
dise," including books, an
alarm clock, drawing pad,
desk calendar, a four-foot
bicycle chain and other arti
cles. "I made sure that at
least one person saw me
take each piece of mer
chandise."
This is the report of
freshman Richard Marquez
after his shoplifting spree at
the Stanford Bookstore. Al
though an experiment for a
sociology class, Richard's
successful theft is indicative
of a major phenomenon at
university bookstores and
in the nation.
Shoplifting is one of the
most frequent and übiquit
ous crimes in America. Of
ficer Ronald Renfro of the
Mountain View Police De
partment asserts that ap
proximately 5000 people are
arrested yearly in Santa
Clara County alone. Retail
prices increase from 5 to 15
percent, annual taxes for
the average California fam
ily go up $200 and losses to
merchants across the coun
try total $5 billion a year —

all due to shoplifting losses.
Renfro estimates that one
out of 11 people who walk
through a store's door is a
shoplifter.
At the bookstore here,
Operations Manager Rose
Sims acknowledges the
"too frequent" problem.
Certain times of the day and
year, such as the pre-
Christmas season, repre
sent high points in the shop
lifting activity chart.

News analysis

The bookstore employs
plainclothes surveillance
workers in an attempt to
catch shoplifters. Sims feels
this system serves as a de
terrent since shoppers
realize they might be
watched; even those who
start to take something will
put it back.
Another asset, she as
serts, is that the bookstore
treats equally all those ap
prehended for shoplifting.
According to Captain Raoul
Niemeyerof Stanford Police
Services, the security
worker confronts the sus

pect, makes a citizen's ar
rest and contacts the police.
After the facts of the case
have been discussed and
verified hv invpstigating
sources, the police "miran
dize" the defendant, at
which point he usually ad
mits his guilt and receives a
citation for petty theft, ver
ifying his arrest and binding
him to a municipal court
appearance. Police officers
check the defendant's re
cord for prior convictions
and subsequently file an in
cident report. If the defen
dant has been convicted
earlier, he or she is subject
to felony action. Although
most shoplifting is effected
by putting the merchandise
in a jacket pocket, some
shoplifters employ "tricks,"
such as sliding items into an
inside coat pocket or using
false-bottomed containers.
When such "plots" are
used, the charge becomes
burglary, according to de
tectives at Stanford Police
Services.
Jim Magdaleno, head of
security at the Associated
Students of UC-Berkeley
Bookstore also reports the
seriousness of shoplifting

losses. He has, however,
found improvement in the
apprehension rate since his
procedural switch from a
visible security officer
system, in which
conspicuously uniformed
guards patrolled the store,
to plainclothes surveillance,
similar to that utilized at the
Stanford Bookstore. The
VSO system proved ineffec
tive since shoplifters merely
had to wait until the guard
was out of sight. Magdaleno
admits that only "one of
eight to 10 shoplifters are
actually caught." A factor in
this ineffectiveness, he
adds, might lie in the at
titudes of some employees
who don't pay adequate at
tention to possible shoplift
ing attempts.
Other factors contribute
to the high frequency of
shoplifting. Marquez noted
a "sort of thrill in my ac
tions" and the vicarious ex
citement which some wit
nesses seemed to experi
ence. The frequency,
übiquity, and ease of shop
lifting actually work to per
petuate the crime by both
diminishing the deterrent
factor and by providing

rationalizations to the shop
lifter..
Although these condona
tions fuel the perpetration
of petty theft and have a de
gree of validity, the fact re
mains that stores do miss
stolen articles, whether pil
fered by students, staff,
outsiders or employees,
and adamantly prosecute
those they apprehend.
More importantly, perhaps,
shoplifting hits the con
sumer as hard as it does
stores. In most establish
ments, Renfro comments,
prices go up due to shoplift
ing losses. Although the
bookstore here does not di
rectly raise its prices, Sims
admits shoplifting limits
merchandise discounts and
customer services.
Sims points out that there
are legal alternatives to
shoplifting. For the person
who can't afford a necessary
book, the bookstore pro
vides the opportunity to
work for it. Many people,
she asserts, "forget that
they could earn it." Under
certain conditions, students
may also make arrange
ments for future payment
for merchandise.

The future direction of
shoplifting prevention is
unclear. Bookstore officials
hesitate to expand or inten
sify bookstore security.
They feel that the installa
tion of cameras or mirrors
"creates a bad image."
Other preventive measures
currently employed by
some stores include stapl
ing bags at check-out coun
ters and using one-way
turnstiles. These turnstiles
limit otherwise easy exits
available to the shoplifter.
The most effective pre
vention, according to
Niemeyer, is education.
Some stores post signs re
minding consumers that
shoplifting is petty theft
punishable by a fine of not
more than $500, and/or a jail
sentence not to exceed six
months. Niemeyer main
tains that people aren't
aware that shoplifting is a
crime.
Condoned in the minds
of many, criminal in the
eyes of the law, shoplifting
has permeated and per
petuated security measures
and consumer rationale;
shoplifting appears to be
here for a long stay.

shoplifter.

News analysis

The bookstore employs
plainclothes surveillance
workers in an attempt to
catch shoplifters. Sims feels
this system serves as a de
terrent since shoppers
realize they might be
watched; even those who
start to take something will
put it back.
Another asset, she as
serts, is that the bookstore
treats equally all those ap
prehended for shoplifting.
According to Captain Raoul
Niemeyerof Stanford Police
Services, the security
worker confronts the sus

pect, makes a citizen's ar
rest and contacts the police.
After the facts of the case
have been discussed and
verified hv invpstigating
sources, the police "miran
dize" the defendant, at
which point he usually ad
mits his guilt and receives a
citation for petty theft, ver
ifying his arrest and binding
him to a municipal court
appearance. Police officers
check the defendant's re
cord for prior convictions
and subsequently file an in
cident report. If the defen
dant has been convicted
earlier, he or she is subject
to felony action. Although
most shoplifting is effected
by putting the merchandise
in a jacket pocket, some
shoplifters employ "tricks,"
such as sliding items into an
inside coat pocket or using
false-bottomed containers.
When such "plots" are
used, the charge becomes
burglary, according to de
tectives at Stanford Police
Services.
Jim Magdaleno, head of
security at the Associated
Students of UC-Berkeley
Bookstore also reports the
seriousness of shoplifting

losses. He has, however,
found improvement in the
apprehension rate since his
procedural switch from a
visible security officer
system, in which
conspicuously uniformed
guards patrolled the store,
to plainclothes surveillance,
similar to that utilized at the
Stanford Bookstore. The
VSO system proved ineffec
tive since shoplifters merely
had to wait until the guard
was out of sight. Magdaleno
admits that only "one of
eight to 10 shoplifters are
actually caught." A factor in
this ineffectiveness, he
adds, might lie in the at
titudes of some employees
who don't pay adequate at
tention to possible shoplift
ing attempts.
Other factors contribute
to the high frequency of
shoplifting. Marquez noted
a "sort of thrill in my ac
tions" and the vicarious ex
citement which some wit
nesses seemed to experi
ence. The frequency,
übiquity, and ease of shop
lifting actually work to per
petuate the crime by both
diminishing the deterrent
factor and by providing

rationalizations to the shop
lifter..
Although these condona
tions fuel the perpetration
of petty theft and have a de
gree of validity, the fact re
mains that stores do miss
stolen articles, whether pil
fered by students, staff,
outsiders or employees,
and adamantly prosecute
those they apprehend.
More importantly, perhaps,
shoplifting hits the con
sumer as hard as it does
stores. In most establish
ments, Renfro comments,
prices go up due to shoplift
ing losses. Although the
bookstore here does not di
rectly raise its prices, Sims
admits shoplifting limits
merchandise discounts and
customer services.
Sims points out that there
are legal alternatives to
shoplifting. For the person
who can't afford a necessary
book, the bookstore pro
vides the opportunity to
work for it. Many people,
she asserts, "forget that
they could earn it." Under
certain conditions, students
may also make arrange
ments for future payment
for merchandise.

The future direction of
shoplifting prevention is
unclear. Bookstore officials
hesitate to expand or inten
sify bookstore security.
They feel that the installa
tion of cameras or mirrors
"creates a bad image."
Other preventive measures
currently employed by
some stores include stapl
ing bags at check-out coun
ters and using one-way
turnstiles. These turnstiles
limit otherwise easy exits
available to the shoplifter.
The most effective pre
vention, according to
Niemeyer, is education.
Some stores post signs re
minding consumers that
shoplifting is petty theft
punishable by a fine of not
more than $500, and/or a jail
sentence not to exceed six
months. Niemeyer main
tains that people aren't
aware that shoplifting is a
crime.
Condoned in the minds
of many, criminal in the
eyes of the law, shoplifting
has permeated and per
petuated security measures
and consumer rationale;
shoplifting appears to be
here for a long stay.

"Before the day ended I
had successfully stolen
$64.37 worth of merchan
dise," including books, an
alarm clock, drawing pad,
desk calendar, a four-foot
bicycle chain and other arti
cles. "I made sure that at
least one person saw me
take each piece of mer
chandise."
This is the report of
freshman Richard Marquez
after his shoplifting spree at
the Stanford Bookstore. Al
though an experiment for a
sociology class, Richard's
successful theft is indicative
of a major phenomenon at
university bookstores and
in the nation.
Shoplifting is one of the
most frequent and übiquit
ous crimes in America. Of
ficer Ronald Renfro of the
Mountain View Police De
partment asserts that ap
proximately 5000 people are
arrested yearly in Santa
Clara County alone. Retail
prices increase from 5 to 15
percent, annual taxes for
the average California fam
ily go up $200 and losses to
merchants across the coun
try total $5 billion a year —

all due to shoplifting losses.
Renfro estimates that one
