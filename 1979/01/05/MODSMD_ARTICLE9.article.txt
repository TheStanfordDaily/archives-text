# Chairing Committee for Undergrad Studies
## Prof. Triska serves as 'jack-of-all-trades' 
### JESSICA CHERESKIN 
Prof. )an Triska is living proof
of the adage "The busier you
are, the more you can do." Be
sides teaching classes in inter
national law and eastern Euro
pean studies, the 56-year-old
political science professor
heads the Committee for Un
dergraduate Studies (C-US) and
was recently named president
of the Czechoslovak Society of
Arts and Sciences. He serves
on the editorial boards of
numerous political journals
and continues to add to the
long list of his published
works.
Before accepting a profes
sorship here in 1960, Triska ac
quired a high-caliber educa
tion at some of the world's
most distinguished univer
sities. He first graduated from
Charles University Law School
in Prague, Czechoslovakia, his
native city. A Sterling Fellow
ship at Yale Law School al
lowed him to earn two more
law degrees before he received
his doctorate in political sci
ence at Harvard in 1957. Soon
afterwards Triska began teach
ing, first at UC-Berkeley and
then at Cornell.
Triska loves Stanford. Dur
ing his 18 years here he has
seen it progress from a "west
ern, small and parochial" uni
versity into one with a "na
tional character." Of the stu
dents here he says, "They're
getting better and better,"
though he added that they're
"very impressive orally, but
not as articulate in writing."
Triska has authored 12 books
and 50 articles.
Triska expects diligent work
from those who attend his clas
ses, and his internatonal law
course is reputed to be espe
cially challenging. "They're af
raid of it because we use briefs
and cases," he commented. "I
enjoy it and so do they after
their initial fear." Triska enjoys
teaching at the University's
overseas campuses. In past
years he's taught in Florence
and Vienna, and will return to
Vienna next winter quarter be
fore taking a sabbatical.

Triska's concern forstudents
and the quality of under
graduate education emerges as
he discusses C-US and his role
as its chairperson. "It's the
busiest committee on campus
and perhaps the most impor
tant one," he said.
The powerful group includes
seven faculty members, three
students, the registrar and
several deans. Members
examine issues related to un
dergraduate studies and then
C-US makes recommendations
to the Faculty Senate. Triska
boasted that during his three
years on the committee the se
nate has adopted all its re
commendations, such as per
mitting graduation with two
majors and adopting a western
culture series.
In addition to evaluating the
success of the western culture
requirement, C-US will be dis
cussing distribution require
ments, residential education
and equity in units of credit, all
under Triska's direction. He
remarked that students here
are expected to achieve both
depth and breadth before
graduating. "A well-educated
person is to have some view of

chemistry, English or what
ever," he notes. He said he
worries that current distribu
tion guidelines may be too
loose, allowing students to ig
nore entire academic fields. In
troductory science courses or
more survey classes may need
to be created to fill this gap. He
added that universities
nationwide are increasing cur
ricular restraints after the laxity
of the '60s.
Triska also compared Stan
ford's residential education
programs with other univer
sities. He praised the current
residential education office.
However, he wants to ensure
that "we're doing all that we
could." Triska thinks that more
classes taught in residences
here would bring warmth to
the University and reduce un
dergraduates' awe of profes
sors. Furthermore, he says,
"Advising needs to be im
proved. If we could relate it to
residential education, faculty
advising would be better." He
hopes to hear from faculty
members who share his in
terest in residential education.
The committee has yet to in
vestigate the "present anar

chy" regarding the uneven as
signment of credit units in dif
ferent classes. Triska says,"I
always assume that one unit of
credit means three hours of
work per week. So for my
five-unit class, students should
put in 15 hours studying time.
But some people tell me this is
overestimating." Despite the
problems involved in review
ing units per course among var
ious undergraduate depart
ments, Triska wants to relieve
current credit inflation.
Against the busy professor's
protests that he already had
too much to do, the Czechos
lovak Society of Arts and Sci
ences appointed him to be its
1979-80 president. The non
partisan, non-profit organiza
tion includes 1600 members
worldwide. It brings together
scientists, scholars, artists and
writers who study Czechos
lovakia because of their na
tional origin or their individual
interest in the country. Primar
ily Triska will try to raise funds
for an English journal which
would chronicle the 20-year
old group's activities.
Having grown up there,
Triska still feels strongly about

his native Czechoslovakia. Like
many others who left Czechos
lovakia in 1948 after the Com
muist take-over, he eventually
expected to return. "I liketogo
there as much as possible, but
my life is here." He married a
Californian, and his two sons
both attend the University.
"It's great to live in California. I
just love it," Triska says.
Such "leisure on the job"
also helps to explain why Triska
prefers teaching to a possible
career in law. Law proved un
satisfying, especially American
law which he finds too techni
cal. Triska always wanted to
study economics or political
science. "I enjoy what I do. I
enjoy teaching and research,"
he said.
Finally, the professor values
the important interaction with
students, the "reciprocal
feedback and growth." He
feels the University cares more
for its undergraduates than do
most other universities, includ
ing Harvard and Yale.
"Everyone's treated as a
human being here. I think this
is magnificent. Anything can
be done at this university be
cause it's concerned."

Prof. Jan Triska
Prof. )an Triska is living proof
of the adage "The busier you
are, the more you can do." Be
sides teaching classes in inter
national law and eastern Euro
pean studies, the 56-year-old
political science professor
heads the Committee for Un
dergraduate Studies (C-US) and
was recently named president
of the Czechoslovak Society of
Arts and Sciences. He serves
on the editorial boards of
numerous political journals
and continues to add to the
long list of his published
works.
Before accepting a profes
sorship here in 1960, Triska ac
quired a high-caliber educa
tion at some of the world's
most distinguished univer
sities. He first graduated from
Charles University Law School
in Prague, Czechoslovakia, his
native city. A Sterling Fellow
ship at Yale Law School al
lowed him to earn two more
law degrees before he received
his doctorate in political sci
ence at Harvard in 1957. Soon
afterwards Triska began teach
ing, first at UC-Berkeley and
then at Cornell.
Triska loves Stanford. Dur
ing his 18 years here he has
seen it progress from a "west
ern, small and parochial" uni
versity into one with a "na
tional character." Of the stu
dents here he says, "They're
getting better and better,"
though he added that they're
"very impressive orally, but
not as articulate in writing."
Triska has authored 12 books
and 50 articles.
Triska expects diligent work
from those who attend his clas
ses, and his internatonal law
course is reputed to be espe
cially challenging. "They're af
raid of it because we use briefs
and cases," he commented. "I
enjoy it and so do they after
their initial fear." Triska enjoys
teaching at the University's
overseas campuses. In past
years he's taught in Florence
and Vienna, and will return to
Vienna next winter quarter be
fore taking a sabbatical.

Triska's concern forstudents
and the quality of under
graduate education emerges as
he discusses C-US and his role
as its chairperson. "It's the
busiest committee on campus
and perhaps the most impor
tant one," he said.
The powerful group includes
seven faculty members, three
students, the registrar and
several deans. Members
examine issues related to un
dergraduate studies and then
C-US makes recommendations
to the Faculty Senate. Triska
boasted that during his three
years on the committee the se
nate has adopted all its re
commendations, such as per
mitting graduation with two
majors and adopting a western
culture series.
In addition to evaluating the
success of the western culture
requirement, C-US will be dis
cussing distribution require
ments, residential education
and equity in units of credit, all
under Triska's direction. He
remarked that students here
are expected to achieve both
depth and breadth before
graduating. "A well-educated
person is to have some view of

chemistry, English or what
ever," he notes. He said he
worries that current distribu
tion guidelines may be too
loose, allowing students to ig
nore entire academic fields. In
troductory science courses or
more survey classes may need
to be created to fill this gap. He
added that universities
nationwide are increasing cur
ricular restraints after the laxity
of the '60s.
Triska also compared Stan
ford's residential education
programs with other univer
sities. He praised the current
residential education office.
However, he wants to ensure
that "we're doing all that we
could." Triska thinks that more
classes taught in residences
here would bring warmth to
the University and reduce un
dergraduates' awe of profes
sors. Furthermore, he says,
"Advising needs to be im
proved. If we could relate it to
residential education, faculty
advising would be better." He
hopes to hear from faculty
members who share his in
terest in residential education.
The committee has yet to in
vestigate the "present anar

chy" regarding the uneven as
signment of credit units in dif
ferent classes. Triska says,"I
always assume that one unit of
credit means three hours of
work per week. So for my
five-unit class, students should
put in 15 hours studying time.
But some people tell me this is
overestimating." Despite the
problems involved in review
ing units per course among var
ious undergraduate depart
ments, Triska wants to relieve
current credit inflation.
Against the busy professor's
protests that he already had
too much to do, the Czechos
lovak Society of Arts and Sci
ences appointed him to be its
1979-80 president. The non
partisan, non-profit organiza
tion includes 1600 members
worldwide. It brings together
scientists, scholars, artists and
writers who study Czechos
lovakia because of their na
tional origin or their individual
interest in the country. Primar
ily Triska will try to raise funds
for an English journal which
would chronicle the 20-year
old group's activities.
Having grown up there,
Triska still feels strongly about

his native Czechoslovakia. Like
many others who left Czechos
lovakia in 1948 after the Com
muist take-over, he eventually
expected to return. "I liketogo
there as much as possible, but
my life is here." He married a
Californian, and his two sons
both attend the University.
"It's great to live in California. I
just love it," Triska says.
Such "leisure on the job"
also helps to explain why Triska
prefers teaching to a possible
career in law. Law proved un
satisfying, especially American
law which he finds too techni
cal. Triska always wanted to
study economics or political
science. "I enjoy what I do. I
enjoy teaching and research,"
he said.
Finally, the professor values
the important interaction with
students, the "reciprocal
feedback and growth." He
feels the University cares more
for its undergraduates than do
most other universities, includ
ing Harvard and Yale.
