# Walsh to notify Geiger today on 49ers offer
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Despite reports to the contrary appearing
everywhere else, Stanford football coach Bill Walsh
has not yet ended the guessing game as to whether he
will return to the NFL to coach the San Francisco
49ers.
The 47-year-old coach met yesterday with 49er
owner Eddie Deßartolo Jr. to discuss the financial
terms and working arrangements of a possible con
tract. Walsh will meet with Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Ceiger this morning to present a decision he is
expected to reach after consultation with his family,
Ceiger said last night from San Francisco, where he
is attending the NCAA convention.
Last year, Walsh told the San Jose Mercury News,
"I'm not in the process of searching (for a pro job),
but if someone wants to make you wealthy, what do
you do?" Walsh will answer that question today be
cause Deßartolo, who is worth somewhere in the
neighborhood of $45 million, can afford to make
Walsh an offer few can refuse.
A Walsh departure for San Francisco would be con
tingent on Deßartolo firing 49er general manager Joe
Thomas, a roadblock which has apparently been re
moved, as reports circulated all weekend that
Thomas had been fired.
Thomas, a brash, egotistical front-office veteran
has a large number of detractors. One of his first acts
as the general manager in San Francisco was to get rid
of head coach Monte Clark, a good friend of Walsh.

If Walsh does leave Stanford — he has two years left
on his contract — the Athletic Department will move
quickly to name a replacement. His successor,
should one be needed, will almost certainly come
from his current staff, with receiving coach Rod
Dowhower likely to get the nod.
Speculation about Walsh's return to the pros
seems as much a part of his mystique here as his
offensive wizardry or his professorial bearing. Last
year he was rumored to be one of the principal candi
dates for head coaching jobs at St. Louis, Buffalo,
Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles. The Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner went as far as to say that not only had
the Rams hired Walsh, butthe silver-haired veteran of
the NFL had named former Cleveland Brown coach
Paul Wiggins and former California mentor Mike
White as assistants.
This year, talk has linked him with jobs in New
York, Oakland and San Francisco. The 49er job would
grant a Walsh wish to return to the NFL while remain
ing in California.
Worst year
Two years of Joe Thomas, however, have left the
49ers in such straits that the immediate success Walsh
enjoyed at Stanford would be difficult to repeat. The
49ers posted a 2-14 mark this season, the nadir of a
33-year existence.
Thomas traded five prime draft choices to obtain an
injured O.J. Simpson from the Buffalo Bills and sent
running back Delvin Williams to Miami, where he led

the Dolphins to the playoffs.
Stanford, in the midst of recruiting, needs an ans
wer to the Walsh dilemma soon. If Walsh leaves,
observers expect a replacement to be named by the
end of the week.
Dowhower, the probable replacement should one
be needed, is a 14-year coaching veteran who has no
head coaching experience but has been instrumental
in the offensive magic Stanford has had the last two
years.
Deserves credit
"Dowhower hasn't been given a lot of credit," ex-
Stanford quarterback Guy Benjamin told the Daily
last year, "but I feel he's made James Lofton. And he's
given me something I can use the rest of my football
career."
In his two seasons here, Walsh has rescued a team
mired in the mediocrity of five years of uninspired
leadership from jack Christiansen. He has done so
with excellent organization and innovative coaching.
In 1977, the Cards capped a 9-3 season with a 24-14
victory over LSU in the Sun Bowl. Walsh was named
Pac-8 Coach of the Year. This year the Cards finished
an 8-4 season with a 25-22 triumph over Georgia in the
Bluebonnet Bowl.
But guessing games have replaced bowl games as
the main topic of discussion around the Stanford
Athletic Department, and the point spread says that
Walsh will sign with the 49ers.
