# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Walsh and contracts 
### 
With the apparent departure of foot
ball head coach Bill Walsh, the Univer
sity loses one of the most important
gears in its Rose Bowl-bound machine.
That he may be leaving one of the
most promising teams in college foot
ball for one of the least promising
teams in professional football — the
San Francisco 49ers — is not a decision
which we are in a position to judge.
Much more than a head coach may
be lost, however. Most apparent will be
the damage to Stanford's ability to re
cruit top high school prospects.
Walsh's ability to turn out professional
football players is something that must
be quite attractive to aspiring athletes
of the nation's high schools. Arid, of
course, Walsh's own recruiting ability
has provided the University with a host
of talented freshmen and sophomores.
Additionally, Walsh has led Stanford
in two seasons to two bowl games and
is rightfully considered to be one of the
top college coaches in the country. His
genius will be difficult, if not impossi
ble, to replace.
An important inequity arises with
Walsh's departure, however. When
Walsh's predecessor, Jack Christian
sen, was fired, the University was

'bound to buy out the remaining two
years of his contract as compensation.
Walsh also has two years remaining to
his contract, but thai will not prevent
him from leaving. In other words, col
lege coaching contracts seem to be
binding to the universities, but not to
the coaches.
In would be impractical for one
school, such as Stanford, to institute a
policy of absolutely binding contracts.
Prospective coaches would naturally
prefer to go to a school which would
allow them the opportunity of leaving
before the expiration of their contract.
However, if the NCAA were to man
date that college coaches be bound to
their contracts, the currently existing
inequity might be eliminated. After all,
why should a university be required to
compensate a fired coach that is still
under contract, when a coach desiring
to leave his school may do so with no
obligation?
As for Walsh, we can be sure that his
decision will be reached with the same
intelligent contemplation that, applied
on the gridiron, brought us two excit
ing years of Stanford football. We wish
him luck in the future.
