Bible doesn't
disapprove of
homosexuality
For a Christian, George
Bump sure hates like Hell — or
so it would seem from his letter
(Daily, Jan. 3). He makes too
many general statements on
homosexuality, so much that
he himself would be a prime
candidate for the course on
homosexuality created by Alice
Supton.
True, there are many people
who do not approve of
homosexuality. I arn one of
them. I would say that as for
me, I could not love a woman
sexually. But for a friend, rela
tive or acquaintance, male or
female, who am I to judge or
downrate them?
I believe Supton's course is
not out to propagandize any
one group, may they be intel
lectually or non-intellectually
inclined. Strains of intelligence
in every person varies, just as
one's inclination to love to
wards another of the same or
different sex.
I said I do not approve of
homosexuality. But I can begin
to understand. I can break
down the walls of my own pre
judice to speak with a gay per
son, to get to know a gay per
son. That's the idea I believe
the course will try to get across.
Yes, I have read the Bible.
David ben Jesse, one of Israel's
greatest kings, certainly had a
great love for his rival King
Saul's son, Jonathon. The bond
between the two was fostered
while both were in the armed
services of Israel, just as many
other soldier love relationships
flourished in ancient Greece,
where democracy first flo
wered.
Saul, in one of his dark
moods, accused Jonathon,
. . do I not know that you
have chosen the son of Jesse to

your own shame, and the
shame of your mother's
nakedness!" (Samuel 1:20: iO).
And David's lament for
Jonathon's death at the hands
of the Philistines ranks as one
of the best lyric poetry found in
the Bible . . your love to me
was wonderful, passing the
love of women."
Apparently, both David and
Jonathon were not struck
down dead for their love.
Jonathon was killed in battle
for his father's sins. And
David's later adultery with
Bathsheba was considered
worse than this love affair with
Jonathon. Those supposed
punishments in the Bible for
the sin of homosexuallity are
just that — supposed.
People are not having chil
dren out of their own specific
wishes not just because they
are gay. There are many men
who refuse to be fathers to
theirown children and theyare
not in the majority gay men.
Statistics show that women are
fast becoming heads of the
household in the majority,
without economic or emo
tional support of a male part
ner. This society will falter if
children are not being clothed,
fed, given those tools that will
shape theirdestinies r and love.
That is the real "sin."
I am a woman and black.
There are many gay black men
and women who are discrimi
nated against by theirown kind
as well as the larger white
community. Vet people of
many origins have learned
about black history in this
country, and that of our
forepeople in Africa, and have
gained a bit more insight into
black people in general. This
has resulted in a bit more toler
ance, and a bit more accep
tance.
Bump's exhortation to those
individuals who abhor
homosexuality smacks of put

ting down people who are dif
ferent as "niggers" who don't
belong in our society. That is
an insult to the human race. Do
you know what "nigger"
means in my book? It is not
only a derivation from negro,
meaning black, but from nig
gardly, which means lazy and
unproductive. People of color
and of choice are not always
lazy and unproductive in our
society! They have a place on
this earth, in this society, and
part of their place is to be true
to themselves as individuals
and as creators of their own
happiness.
