## Abortion cannot be justified 
### 
Moral philosophers are in definite dis
agreement regarding whether abortion is
morally permissible or not. The question
of deciding whether abortion is morally
wrong is a difficult one because in several
cases it can be shown that a true moral
dilemma is involved. Beforediscussing the
nature of this dilemma, it is important to
define exactly what is meant by a true
moral dilemma.
A true moral dilemma is a situation in
which, no matter what action is taken to
resolve the situation, one will be acting
immorally. As an example, suppose you
were kidnapped by a tribe of barbarians
and brought to an encampment. In the
center of the encampment is a box divided
into two compartments. In compartment
A, a person named ]ohn is imprisoned. In
compartment B, a person named Mary is
imprisoned. Youaretoldby the barbarians
that if you push a button on the exterior of
the box, John will die. If you dbn't push
the button within one minute, Mary will
die. You are then told to make the choice.
Here we have a true moral dilemma be
cause regardless of the course of action
you take an immoral result will follow. The
fact that you have been forced to make the
choice does not alter the fact that the re
sults of the decision will be immoral re
gardless of what decision is made.
A true moral dilemma, then, always in
volves a situation in which one is faced
with several alternative courses of action,
each of which is immoral. The question to
be considered in deciding which immoral
act to choose is: "Is the immoral act jus
tified?" The circumstances of the situation
will dictate which immoral act is justified,
or which act is more justified than another.
It must be remembered, however, that the
act chosen will still be immoral, even if
justified.
Many of the traditional anti-abortion ar
guments hinge on the fetus' right to life. I
begin with the premise that every human
person has the natural right to life. By a
natural right, I mean a right that is inherent
in the very fact that one is human, a right
that is not acquired in virtue of any con
tract. All living human persons have a
natural right to life. To show that the fetus
possesses this natural right,, one must
show that the fetus is indeed a human per
son and not just a living being.
Many arguments have dealt with various
criteria for humanity. I shall maintain that
the fetus is a full human person, posses
sing of all natural human rights, from the

moment of conception. Most arguments
against the fetus possessing full natural
rights from the moment of conception rest
on the belief that there is a point in the
development of the fetus beyond which
the fetus may be considered a person and
prior to which the fetus is not considered a
full fledged human being possessing the
rights of such an entity. Various points in
the physiological development of the
fetus have been proposed as the point at
which the fetus becomes human: the time
of segmentation, the point at which fetal
brain activity begins, the time of quicken
ing, the time at which the fetus becomes
viable, and the moment of birth.
I maintain that a human cannot be de
fined purely by a set of physiological fea
tures. The essence of humanity includes
far more than physiological elements, so
any set of characteristics necessary and
sufficient to define humanity would have

I propose that there is at
least one case in which the
immoral act of abortion can
be potentially justified, and
that is the case of a woman
whose life is threatened by
the pregnancy.

to include features of man beyond the
purely physiological. Thus to use solely a
set of physiological manifestations to de
cide humanity is to reduce man to some
thing less in concept than he actually is.
Any such physiological point selected
will be, at best, arbitrary since its accep
tance already ignores completely those
non-physiological features of humanity.
Under these premises, we must reject all
arguments that reduce humanity to a
physiological point in the development
cycle (even after birth) and conclude that
the fetus is a human being, possessing full
natural rights, from the moment of con
ception.
Perhaps the most fundamental right
among the natural rights that the fetus
possesses is the right to life. Having estab

lished, then, that the fetus possesses a
natural right to life from the moment of
conception, it follows immediately that
abortion violates that right. To abort, then,
is always to act immorally. We are now left
with the question of deciding under what
circumstances, if any, the immoral act is
justified. It should be remembered that
immoral acts can only be justified in the
situation in which one faces a true moral
dilemma.
I propose that there is at least one case
in which the immoral act of abortion can
be potentially justified, and that is the case
of a woman whose life is threatened by the
pregnancy. To argue this case, we must
bring in the presence of a third person, the
physician. To see that the physician faces a
true moral dilemma we need only imagine
that the physician is the person kidnapped
by the barbarians mentioned earlier. If he
aborts (pushes the button), the fetus
()ohn) dies. If he does not abort, the
mother (Mary) dies. The consequence of
either decision is an immoral result, the
death of a human being. There is abso
lutely nothing that can be said, a priori,
about which decision should be made.
Either immoral act could be justified in the
face of the true moral dilemma.
It is important to note that the case of an
unwanted pregnancy not due to rape, a
situation for which abortion is often con
sidered, does not involve a true moral di
lemma. Here the pregnancy is the direct
result of sexual intercourse to which the
mother assented. She has engaged in in
tercourse knowing full well that it might
result in pregnancy, regardless of any birth
control measures that might have been ta
ken.
If pregnancy results, she and the father
are morally responsible for the pregnancy,
for it is a direct result of actions they them
selves took. Any rights of the woman
which are violated by the pregnancy, such
as her right to privacy, her right to control
her own body, or the right to determine
family size, are violations that have ulti
mately been self-imposed by her electing
to have intercourse in the face of pre
gnancy risks. Because the fetus has been
brought into a dependent relationship
with the mother by actions which the pa
rents themselves took, the parents are
morally responsible for the fetus. No
moral dilemma exists, and abortion can
not be justified.
