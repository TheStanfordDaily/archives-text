## Steady-state food production strategies needed 
### 
(This is the second of two parts.)
The American food system is under increasing
pressure and stress. High levels of production are
maintained only because we use so much fossil fuel
to substitute for labor. Fuel runs the tractors, com
bines and other farm machinery. Fuel is used to make
pesticides and herbicides and also heats farm build
ings. Electricity is used to pump water and irrigate,
propane dries the crop, and natural gas is required to
make nitrogen fertilizer. Thus, chemical agriculture,
as long as it relies on dwindling supplies of fossil
fuels, will raise the price of our commercial fuel and
food. Our heavy reliance on fuels to substitute for
labor in farming and other food-related activities are
only temporary fixes.
Agriculture ought to be an energy-yielding activity,
but running the food system requires 10 times more
fuel energy as the energy content of the food pro
duced by the system. For each calorie of food eaten,
10 calories of fossil fuel are needed to produce,
transport, process and store the food. Growing the
food only takes one-fifth of the energy used in the
American food system. The other four-fifths of the
total energy is devoted to preparing, processing,
packaging, and distributing the food. Processing
food now uses twice as much energy as it takes to
grow it.
Each American farmer produces enough food to
feed 200 people. The average U.S. farm uses 80 gal
lons of gasoline to raise one acre of corn. The energy
used to dry the corn with propane fuel exceeds the
energy required to produce the corn. Even the aver
age dairy cow requires $30 worth of energy annually
to heat and sanitize water, remove waste, and heat
the buildings. The U.S. farmer and farm worker,
though, has suffered physically and financially. Poor
living conditions and health hazards have combined
togivethe farmeran average life span of only49years
— 21 years less than the national live expectancy.

Fertilizers are becoming the most essential input
into the American farm system. Eighteen and a half
million tons of fertilizer are required each year to
sustain current levels of crop production and soil
fertility in the U.S. In U.S. corn production, fertilizers
use more energy per acre than tractor fuel. And still
fertilizer has been growing at 4 per cent a year, the
last 20 years.
As fossil fuel supplies diminish, it is clear that in
dustrial agriculture is not indefinitely sustainable.
Renewable energy sources must'be used. Methane or
solar crop-dryers could replace propane fuel for this
task. Farmers could reduce their fuel requirements
by building their own simple solar collectors to heat
their homes, water, and livestock buildings.
A revival of windmills in this country would help
replace electricity in pumping and moving water. Ir
rigation uses 75 per cent of all U.S. farm electricity,
and solar, biogas, and wind powered pumps can all
replace non-renewable resources to provide the
power. Farmers could also plant more clover, alfalfa,
soybeans and other legumes to add nitrogen natur
ally to the soil, reducing the need for artificial fertiliz
ers.
The energy potentially recoverable from the wastes
from a feedlot of 100,000 cattle in the U.S. would
supply the equivalent of the natural gas needs of
30,000 people at present rates of use in the form of
methane gas. At present, livestock waste is an expen
sive and serious disposal problem. The USDA has
estimated if we recycled the waste and used it as
feed, rather than allowing it to run off, it would pro
vide as much protein as the entire U.S. soybean crop.
In the last three years, China has built an estimated
4.3 million biogas plants which digest crop and ani
mal wastes and convert them into fertilizer and
methane gas — a cooking fuel. China, Korea, and
)apan also use human waste to maintain soil fertility
for food production. We could use processed urban

wastes, sewage sludge, animal wastes, and proces
sing residues, and convert them into valuable energy
and fertilizer. In Tel Aviv, Israel, city sewage sludge
helps enrich the soil and lessen the need for
for fertilize
We must tranform urban areas into major food
producers. Attempts should be made to buy both
fresh and canned foods locally to reduce transporta
tion costs. Eighty percent of vegetables in every
Chinese city are grown within seven miles of that
urban area. The New York Times says there are en
couraging signs in the U.S. of a renewed interest in
urban gardening. In 1977, 32 million households, or
42 per cent of all American families, raised fruits and
vegetables on an area equivalent to approximetely
seven million acres. The average American gardener
saved mo're than $375 on his food bill last year.
Optimal food strategies will combine favorable as
pects of large-scale and small-scale farming. A wide
range of diverse strategies is the best way to insure
security. Ecological, sustainable farming practices,
elimination of food waste, a slowdown in population
growth, and a decline in energy-intensive meat con
sumption are all essential in keeping pace with rising
food demands.
The largest energy savings will not come from im
proving farming efficiency but from eliminating un
necessary food processing, and inefficient market
ing, transport, cooking, and a storage of food. A
national nutritional policy and program, such as
Norway has undertaken, is an important first step in
eliminating products of little nutritive value and in
creasing public awareness of the content of foods.
The food you eat, where it is grown, how it is grown,
how it is processed, all will determine our future
health, environment, and prospects for human survi
val.

saved mo're than $375 on his food bill last year.
Optimal food strategies will combine favorable as
pects of large-scale and small-scale farming. A wide
range of diverse strategies is the best way to insure
security. Ecological, sustainable farming practices,
elimination of food waste, a slowdown in population
growth, and a decline in energy-intensive meat con
sumption are all essential in keeping pace with rising
food demands.
The largest energy savings will not come from im
proving farming efficiency but from eliminating un
necessary food processing, and inefficient market
ing, transport, cooking, and a storage of food. A
national nutritional policy and program, such as
Norway has undertaken, is an important first step in
eliminating products of little nutritive value and in
creasing public awareness of the content of foods.
The food you eat, where it is grown, how it is grown,
how it is processed, all will determine our future
health, environment, and prospects for human survi
val.

The American food system is under increasing
pressure and stress. High levels of production are
maintained only because we use so much fossil fuel
to substitute for labor. Fuel runs the tractors, com
bines and other farm machinery. Fuel is used to make
pesticides and herbicides and also heats farm build
ings. Electricity is used to pump water and irrigate,
propane dries the crop, and natural gas is required to
make nitrogen fertilizer. Thus, chemical agriculture,
as long as it relies on dwindling supplies of fossil
fuels, will raise the price of our commercial fuel and
food. Our heavy reliance on fuels to substitute for
labor in farming and other food-related activities are
only temporary fixes.
Agriculture ought to be an energy-yielding activity,
but running the food system requires 10 times more
fuel energy as the energy content of the food pro
duced by the system. For each calorie of food eaten,
10 calories of fossil fuel are needed to produce,
transport, process and store the food. Growing the
food only takes one-fifth of the energy used in the
American food system. The other four-fifths of the
total energy is devoted to preparing, processing,
packaging, and distributing the food. Processing
food now uses twice as much energy as it takes to
grow it.
Each American farmer produces enough food to
feed 200 people. The average U.S. farm uses 80 gal
lons of gasoline to raise one acre of corn. The energy
used to dry the corn with propane fuel exceeds the
energy required to produce the corn. Even the aver
age dairy cow requires $30 worth of energy annually
to heat and sanitize water, remove waste, and heat
the buildings. The U.S. farmer and farm worker,
though, has suffered physically and financially. Poor
living conditions and health hazards have combined
togivethe farmeran average life span of only49years
— 21 years less than the national live expectancy.

Fertilizers are becoming the most essential input
into the American farm system. Eighteen and a half
million tons of fertilizer are required each year to
sustain current levels of crop production and soil
fertility in the U.S. In U.S. corn production, fertilizers
use more energy per acre than tractor fuel. And still
fertilizer has been growing at 4 per cent a year, the
last 20 years.
As fossil fuel supplies diminish, it is clear that in
dustrial agriculture is not indefinitely sustainable.
Renewable energy sources must'be used. Methane or
solar crop-dryers could replace propane fuel for this
task. Farmers could reduce their fuel requirements
by building their own simple solar collectors to heat
their homes, water, and livestock buildings.
A revival of windmills in this country would help
replace electricity in pumping and moving water. Ir
rigation uses 75 per cent of all U.S. farm electricity,
and solar, biogas, and wind powered pumps can all
replace non-renewable resources to provide the
power. Farmers could also plant more clover, alfalfa,
soybeans and other legumes to add nitrogen natur
ally to the soil, reducing the need for artificial fertiliz
ers.
The energy potentially recoverable from the wastes
from a feedlot of 100,000 cattle in the U.S. would
supply the equivalent of the natural gas needs of
30,000 people at present rates of use in the form of
methane gas. At present, livestock waste is an expen
sive and serious disposal problem. The USDA has
estimated if we recycled the waste and used it as
feed, rather than allowing it to run off, it would pro
vide as much protein as the entire U.S. soybean crop.
In the last three years, China has built an estimated
4.3 million biogas plants which digest crop and ani
mal wastes and convert them into fertilizer and
methane gas — a cooking fuel. China, Korea, and
)apan also use human waste to maintain soil fertility
for food production. We could use processed urban

wastes, sewage sludge, animal wastes, and proces
sing residues, and convert them into valuable energy
and fertilizer. In Tel Aviv, Israel, city sewage sludge
helps enrich the soil and lessen the need for
for fertilize
We must tranform urban areas into major food
producers. Attempts should be made to buy both
fresh and canned foods locally to reduce transporta
tion costs. Eighty percent of vegetables in every
Chinese city are grown within seven miles of that
urban area. The New York Times says there are en
couraging signs in the U.S. of a renewed interest in
urban gardening. In 1977, 32 million households, or
42 per cent of all American families, raised fruits and
vegetables on an area equivalent to approximetely
seven million acres. The average American gardener
saved mo're than $375 on his food bill last year.
