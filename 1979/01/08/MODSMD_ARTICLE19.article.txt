# Portuguese farms spark conflict

Avis, Portugal (AP) — With the year's work done, dozens of
plows stand in rows outside whitewashed cottages, pumpkins
lean against the barn and dunes of seed corn dry in the sun
These gentle hills don't look like a battlefield.
But this is the "May 1 Cooperative," whose workers tell you
they are fighting for survival. Their enemies, they say are
bureaucrats in Lisbon and the club-swinging national
guardsmen who may evict them from the land on bureaucratic
orders.
11 j tf l e . c ' ass stru gg |e - We play this game in Portugal," Jose
Luis da Silva, the mayor of the medieval town of Avis and
president of the cooperative, said in explaining the conflict
that has embroiled much of Portugal's agriculture for more
than three years.
"Our fight is for the right to share the rewards of our work,"
he recently told a group of reporters who got a rare tour here
under arrangements made with Communist officials in Lisbon.
Da Silva s farm is one of about 600 cooperatives that grew up
when land was seized from private owners after the April 1974
revolution that toppled Portugal's dictatorship. Now the new
government wants to give some of the land back, but the
cooperatives want to keep it.
This farm has 1100 cows, 12,000 sheep and 29,250 acres of
land. Da Silva said of its development" "Physically, we a re
worse off than before. We work harder. But we live much
better. We have liberty."
No issue bears more heavily on Portugal's future than the
fate of the cooperatives. No question stirs more bitterness
than who controls the land that produces most of the grain,
olives and cork. No struggle has more to do with the fate of the
Communist Party, which is staking its main electoral stron
ghold — the poverty-stricken countryside — on the success of
the cooperatives.
And, if productivity could be increased, few sections of
Portugal would hold more promise for self-sufficiency than
the Alentejo, the rolling plains beyond the Tagus river,
stretching east and south toward Spain. Now half of Portugal's
food is imported.
Once these plains were largely a preserve of the wealthy,
much land lay fallow, and seasonal hiring kept the work force
small and poor.
The reaction a year after the dictatorship's collapse seems
now to have been inevitable. Peasants swarmed onto big es
tates and barred absentee landlords. In a region of nearly 10
million acres, nearly half of Portugal, they occupied more than
2.5 million acres.
With help from left-wing organizers, some 75,000 workers
— more than half the estimated number of the region's farm
laborers settled on cooperatives. It was a dramatic increase

in employment that, at first, brought about a big gain in pro
duction.
But output was disastrously low in 1977 and again this year.
Peasants cited destructively heavy rainfalls, although reports
of good harvests came from just across the border in Spain.
Politics became a key factor in laying blame.
Some government officials accuse the cooperatives of waste
and fraud. Peasants contend that Lisbon deliberately with
holds loans and technical aid and sets prices low to try to
bankrupt the farms.
Clashes between evicted peasants and armed guardsmen
have occurred on a number of Alentejo farms since Sep
tember, and Da Silva said of his own cooperative's experi
ence:
"Some of the guard came in here recently like an army,
turning families out of houses and wrecking gardens. ... If
the government tries to give this cooperative back, we shall go
away. But when the national guard leaves, we shall return."
Reinstated landowners have complaints, too. Some say
peasants sold cattle to meet expenses and left broken equip
ment in fields rather than repair it. One found a tractor engine
used to dam a stream.
No such mismanagement was evident on the May 1
Cooperative, an acknowledged showcase. Rubbing a week's
beard with a calloused hand, Da Silva stood in a barnyard and
assessed the cooperative.
"This land belonged to several owners. A lot of it was not
worked," he said. "People from Avis were emigrating to Fr
ance to find jobs. We occupied the farms. . . . We found 18
tractors here and now there are 60. The same land that used to
support 97 workers now has 524. We have four times as many
sheep as before. We've begun growing rice — 800 tons this
year. Next year, tobacco.
"Nobody emigrates from Avis anymore," he said. "Some
have even come back from France."
Da Silva said the cooperative's 11-man executive committee
controls a monthly budget of about $300,000. The farm has
erected new buildings with surplus funds, he said, and pays
wages regularly.
As president of the cooperative, Da Silva earns $150 a
month, the same as a tractor driver. Antonio Manuel Varela
earns more because of his special skills in caring for dairy
cattle.
The best I ever made before the revolution was 6800 es
cudos ($150) a month but only for five or six months a year,"
Varela said. "Now I'm paid monthly. Last month I made 9000
escudos ($200).
That s what the cooperative means, as far as I'm con
cerned."
