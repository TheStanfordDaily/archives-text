# Rebels claim Phnom Penh fallen

### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) â€” Pro-
Hanoi Cambodian rebels claimed
they "totally liberated" the capital of
Phnom Penh, overthrew Premier Pol
Pot and said Monday they had com
plete control of Cambodia.
Vietnam radio and the Soviet News
Agency Tass, both quoting the insur
gents' SPK news agency, also said
Phnom Penh had fallen.
Analysts in Bangkok said the offen
sive took two weeks. The reports that
Phnom Penh had been captured by
the Cambodian rebels could not be
independently confirmed.
Tass and Hanoi Radio credited the
victories to the month-old National
United Front for National Salvation,
although Vietnamese troops are
generally believed to have done
most, if not all, of the fighting.
Tass said the "liberation" of
Phnom Penh would cause "profound
satisfaction and joy by millions of
people" in the world. The dispatch
said the Cambodian government had
pursued "a barbarous policy of
genocide against the Kampuchean
people." It added "the birth of an
independent and free Kampuchea
will be an important factor for peace
and stability in Southeast Asia."
Kampuchea is the official name of
Cambodia.
Carter declines comment
President jimmy Carter, still in
Guadeloupe after a four-power
Western summit, declined to answer
reporters' questions about Cam
bodia, but did say he had heard
Phnom Penh had fallen.
White House aides with Carter said
privately that the invasion fell in line
with predictions by national security

adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski that
there would be a "proxy war" bet
ween the Soviets, who back Viet
nam, and China, which supports
Cambodia.
In Washington, Jack Cannon, State
Department spokesman for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, said U.S. of
ficials have not yet received confir
mation of the rebel victory.
Opposes invasion
"Our position has been that Viet
nam intervention in Cambodia is to
tally unjustified and Vietnam should
remove its forces," Cannon said.
The rebel communique, released
in Bangkok, said: "After annihilating
or disintegrating the main force divi
sions of the Pol Pot-leng Sary army
and smashing the outer defense ring
of the enemy, the revolutionary
armed forces of Kampuchea (Cam
bodia), in coordination with the
people, entered Phnom Penh from
various directions."
The communique said the rebels
took the capital city at 12:30 p.m.,
forcing the complete collapse of the
government of Pol Pot and his de
puty premier, Keng Sary.
No resistance reported
None of the reports mentioned re
sistance, if any, against the victors in
Phnom Penh. Unconfirmed reports
said the top Cambodian leadership
had been evacuated by air to China,
which verbally attacked the Viet
namese but did not come to Cam
bodia's aid militarily.
China said Sunday that Vietnam
invaded Cambodia "to serve the
Soviet Union in its expansionist
plan," and called on the United Na
tions to intervene in the border war,

a government statement said.
Former Cambodian head of state
Prince Norodom Sihanouk met with
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping and
"exposed the towering crimes of Vie
tnam in invading Cambodia and ex
pressed the Cambodian peoples' de
termination to resist aggression,"
the official Chinese news agency
Hsinhua said. It said Teng reaffirmed
China's support for Cambodia.
Sihanouk to Peking
Sihanouk, ousted as Cambodia's
ruler in a 1970 rightist coup, headed a
government in exile in Peking and
backed a Communist-led fight
against the U.S.-backed Lon Nol
government. Sihanouk returned to
Cambodia after the communist vic
tory in 1975, but was eased out of
politics by Premier Pol Pot's regime.
