# Rebels claim Phnom Penh fallen

### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) â€” Pro-
Hanoi Cambodian rebels claimed
they "totally liberated" the capital of
Phnom Penh, overthrew Premier Pol
Pot and said Monday they had com
plete control of Cambodia.
Vietnam radio and the Soviet News
Agency Tass, both quoting the insur
gents' SPK news agency, also said
Phnom Penh had fallen.
Analysts in Bangkok said the offen
sive took two weeks. The reports that
Phnom Penh had been captured by
the Cambodian rebels could not be
independently confirmed.
Tass and Hanoi Radio credited the
victories to the month-old National
United Front for National Salvation,
although Vietnamese troops are
generally believed to have done
most, if not all, of the fighting.
Tass said the "liberation" of
Phnom Penh would cause "profound
satisfaction and joy by millions of
people" in the world. The dispatch
said the Cambodian government had
pursued "a barbarous policy of
genocide against the Kampuchean
people." It added "the birth of an
independent and free Kampuchea
will be an important factor for peace
and stability in Southeast Asia."
Kampuchea is the official name of
Cambodia.
Carter declines comment
President jimmy Carter, still in
Guadeloupe after a four-power
Western summit, declined to answer
reporters' questions about Cam
bodia, but did say he had heard
Phnom Penh had fallen.
White House aides with Carter said
privately that the invasion fell in line
with predictions by national security

adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski that
there would be a "proxy war" bet
ween the Soviets, who back Viet
nam, and China, which supports
Cambodia.
In Washington, Jack Cannon, State
Department spokesman for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, said U.S. of
ficials have not yet received confir
mation of the rebel victory.
Opposes invasion
"Our position has been that Viet
nam intervention in Cambodia is to
tally unjustified and Vietnam should
remove its forces," Cannon said.
The rebel communique, released
in Bangkok, said: "After annihilating
or disintegrating the main force divi
sions of the Pol Pot-leng Sary army
and smashing the outer defense ring
of the enemy, the revolutionary
armed forces of Kampuchea (Cam
bodia), in coordination with the
people, entered Phnom Penh from
various directions."
The communique said the rebels
took the capital city at 12:30 p.m.,
forcing the complete collapse of the
government of Pol Pot and his de
puty premier, Keng Sary.
No resistance reported
None of the reports mentioned re
sistance, if any, against the victors in
Phnom Penh. Unconfirmed reports
said the top Cambodian leadership
had been evacuated by air to China,
which verbally attacked the Viet
namese but did not come to Cam
bodia's aid militarily.
China said Sunday that Vietnam
invaded Cambodia "to serve the
Soviet Union in its expansionist
plan," and called on the United Na
tions to intervene in the border war,

a government statement said.
Former Cambodian head of state
Prince Norodom Sihanouk met with
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping and
"exposed the towering crimes of Vie
tnam in invading Cambodia and ex
pressed the Cambodian peoples' de
termination to resist aggression,"
the official Chinese news agency
Hsinhua said. It said Teng reaffirmed
China's support for Cambodia.
Sihanouk to Peking
Sihanouk, ousted as Cambodia's
ruler in a 1970 rightist coup, headed a
government in exile in Peking and
backed a Communist-led fight
against the U.S.-backed Lon Nol
government. Sihanouk returned to
Cambodia after the communist vic
tory in 1975, but was eased out of
politics by Premier Pol Pot's regime.
Sihanouk, 56, arrived in Peking
Saturday night en route to a U.N.
Security Council meeting this week
where he is to make a plea for inter
national support for Cambodia.
China urged in a statement that all
nations interested in peace and sta
bility "take every possible measure
to stop the Vietnamese authorities'
savage aggression against a
sovereign state."
Indochina federation
The Chinese said the Soviet plan
envisaged an Indochina federation
under Vietnam's control.
Vietnam "brazenly dispatched a
dozen or so divisions, supported by
many planes, tanks and guns, to
wage a new massive war of aggres
sion" against Cambodia and cap
tured a large part of the territory,
China said.
China cannot remain "indifferent"
to the situation, it said, and "will con

tinue to extend assistance in various
forms to the Cambodian people."
Vietnam, in an official statement,
claimed Sunday that China had
moved "a large military force" and
war materials close to the Viet
namese border and indicated the re
ported build-up was tied to the situa
tion in Cambodia.
The reported fall of Cambodia
would end one of the most radical
social experiments this century, and
from the accounts of refugees, one
of the bloodiest. It would also give
Vietnam sway over Indochina and
create growing international anxiety
about Vietnam's regional ambitions.
Indochina includes Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos, an area twice
the size of Japan with a population of
more than 60 million.
Analysts speculated that the Cam
bodians might resort to guerrilla war
fare tactics in the countryside and
this still could not be discounted.
