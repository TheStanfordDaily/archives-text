# 'Laetrile on trial' in Plymouth
## 
### 
Plymouth, Mass. (AP) â€” A
young couple returns to court
today to try to regain official
custody of their leukemia
stricken 3-year-old son is what
is seen as a trial on the merits of
Laetrile.
"Actually, that's what it is,
Laetrile on trial," said George
Donovan of Hull, lawyer for
Gerald and Diana Green of Sci
tuate.
For the third time within a
year, the couple will try to
overturn a state Superior Court
ruling making their son, Chad,
a ward of the Welfare Depart
ment and requiring him to un
dergo chemotherapy.
The parents contend that
metabolic therapy, including
the use of Laetrile and a special
diet, is as effective as the
chemotherapy in arresting
leukemia and that they have
the right to choose his treat
ment.
Advocates claim that taet
rile, a substance extracted
from apricot and peach pits, is
a cancer cure. But the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration
has banned interstate trans
port of Laetrile on grounds the
substance has not been proven
safe and effective.
The Greens plan to present
at least four pro-Laetrile wit
nesses, including Dr. Ernesto
Contreros, a Harvard
educated physician who has

treated patients with Laetrile at
his clinic in Tijuana, Mexico.
Contreros has said, if neces
sary, he will treat Chad with
Laetrile and chemotherapy,
said Mrs. Green, 25.
The boy receives Laetrile and
a special diet from his parents,
in addition to the court
ordered chemotherapy from
Massachusetts General Hospi
tal and a public health nurse in
their home town. Although
formally a ward of the state,

Chad lives with his parents.
Jonathan Brandt, an assistant
state attorney general, repre
senting the Welfare Depart
ment, said he will present what
he considers evidence of the
side effects of Laetrile as well as
expert witnesses denying its
value.
Both the hospital, which
Chad visits periodically for
treatment, and the boy's pa
rents report he is doing well.
