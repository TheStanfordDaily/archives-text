# Exciting women cagers win two
## 
### SALLY JENKINS 
Are you tired of the same old
thing on weekends? Is the
drink-sleep drink-sleep
routine getting a little tiring?
Check out the women's bas
ketball team. You might be
pleasantly surprised.
Not only do the Cards play
an exciting game, but they
have managed to string up
eight victories in a row, defeat
ing Arizona St.and Cal State-
Northridge on Friday and
Saturday nights.
In a last minute thriller Friday
night, Angie Paccione hit a free
throw in the final two seconds
to clinch a 69-67 over ASU.
Trailing by one point at the half
the Cards came back to win it's
toughest game this season,
according to coach Dottie
McCrea.
"The ASU game was the first
time we faced a really tough
pressure defense," she said.
"We had some problems get
ting points. But it was good for
us to play a tough game. When
you win a lot of games you tend
to get complacent.
"The first half we came out
kind of flat, the pressure got to
us. We really hadn't faced that
before. At halftime I told them
that they weren't mentally pre
pared to play this team. Then
they came out in the second
half and played with more in
tensity."
Paccione and Jeanne Ruark
are fast establishing them
selves as the team leaders.
Both freshmen, Ruark was the
top scorer in the ASU game
with 25 points, and Paccione

followed her up sinking seven
of 10 free throws for a total of
13 points.
The Northridge game was
equally as interesting, though
in a different way. In one of its
better games thus far this sea
son, the team tore apart the
Matadors, 98-69. According to
McCrea:
"We learned a good lesson
against Arizona St. For the first
time, against Northridge, we
played up to our full potential.
We showed that we were cap
able of scoring a lot of points."
Paccione and Ruark once
again proved themselves to be
virtually indispensable, Pac
cione scoring 17 points, and
Ruark scoring 35 points.
But one of the biggest stars
of the team is not an individual
— its the bench.
"Right now I'm using about
eight or nine players a game,"
McCrea said. "It gives us a lot
more depth."
Along with Renee Stiener, an
excellent rebounder, there is
Stephanie Calef, Louise Smith
(who, though in the midst of
recovering from an ankle in
jury, managed to score five
points last night in the closing
minutes), and Kathy Murphy, a
substitute who also manages to
score her share of points.
With the two victories this
weekend, the Cards just might
be thinking about an unde
feated season.
In fact, the ASU game could
be indicative of just how far
this team can go. They could
start a trend of Card teams that
win in the last few seconds

rather than lose.
And by the way, what Stan
ford team ever won a grueling
Friday night game, and re
turned on Saturday to score 98
points?
So, if you're ever bored of
the same old routine, you
might want to mosey on over to

Maples (if you can go without a
beer for that long) and join the
assortment of parents, Palo
Alto store clerks, alumni, the
Palo Alto junior high and the
guys from Toyon who like to
ring a cowbell whenever
someone tries to shoot a free
throw.
