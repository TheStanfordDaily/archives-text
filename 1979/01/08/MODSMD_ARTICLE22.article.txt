# NFC and AFC Playoffs
## 
### 
Charlie Waters inter
cepted two passes, setting
up a pair of Dallas
touchdowns, and the de
fending champion Cow
boys charged into Super
Bowl XIII with a 28-0 victory
over the Los Angeles Rams
in the NFC Championship
game yesterday.
Cowboy tackle Randy
White wiped out two-thirds
of the Rams' starting
backfield with jarring tack
les that knocked running
back John Cappelletti and
quarterback Pat Haden out
of the game.
The injury to Haden came
on Waters' second intercep
tion of the game and set up
Roger Staubach's four-yard

touchdown pass to Scott
Laidlaw. Earlier, Waters in
tercepted a pass and set up a
five-yard TD sprint by Tony
Dorsett, breaking a 0-0
halftime tie.
At Pittsburgh, Terry Brad
shaw passed for two TDs
just 19 seconds apart in the
final minute of the first half,
blowing apart a rain-soaked
AFC Championship game
yesterday and sending the
Pittsburgh Steelers past the
Houston Oilers 34-5 and
into Super Bowl XIII.
After first-quarter TD runs
of seven yards by Franco
Harris and 15 yards by Rocky
Bleier, Bradshaw made it
21-3 with a 29-yard scoring
pass to Lynn Swann.
