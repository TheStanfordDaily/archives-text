## Sun Devils burn Cards 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Shed no tears and cast no as
persions over Stanford's 80-68
defeat at the hands of Arizona
State Saturday. The Cardinals
just plain got beat, fair and
square.
The Cards didn't give this
one away with turnovers as
they did Thursday night to
Arizona. Stanford was simply
overpowered by a continuous
barrage of Sun Devil talent.
"They have five excellent
starters, and five high-quality
substitutes," said Card coach
Dick Dißiaso. "Those 10
players all have size, speed and
quickness, and I think they just
wore us down eventually."
Stanford slumped to 1-3 in
Pac-10 play and 7-6 overall.
Arizona State is now 2-2 and
11-4.
During the early first-half ac
tion, almost every rebound
was contested by massive Sun
Devils such as Tony Zeno (6-
foot-8), Kurt Nimphius (6-10)
and Alton Lister (6-11).
But the Cards, particularly
forwards Kimberly Belton and
Brian Welch, managed to filch
enough rebounds here and
there to keep the score tem
porarily close.
The teams battled through
seven ties, and with around
seven minutes remaining in
the half Stanford trailed just
24-23.
Then the Cards suffered an
ultimately fatal lapse of con
centration that resulted in

sloppy offensive execution.
After Nimphius made a tip-in
for a 26-23 Arizona State lead,
Stanford committed two tur
novers in a row, paying for the
second one by yielding a turn
around jumper to Lister.
Now trailing by five, the
Cards should have worked pa
tiently fora good shot. Instead,
Orlando Ward threw up an air
ball, and Zeno sank a baseline
jumper for Arizona St.
Belton forced an inside shot
that missed, and Zeno came
right back with a three-point
play giving the Sun Devils a
33-23 lead.
A long jumper by Welch, two
free throws by Wolfe Perry and
one charity toss by Belton
brought Stanford back to
within 33-28, but Johnny Nash
hit a 10-footer and Blake Taylor
slam-dunked and added a free
throw to restore the 10-point
margin.
Arizona State began the sec
ond half with an 8-2 surge on
Nimphius' two hoops, Taylor's
drive and Greg Goorjian's
lay-in to extend its lead to
48-32. The Cards never came
closer than nine thereafter.
Vet Dißiaso credited his
players for a strong effort.
"Other than for poor shot
selection over a short stretch
(the first-half collapse), our
guys played with a tremendous
amount of courage," he said.
Stanford, which was among
the Pac-10 leaders in most of
fensive categories, endured a

disappointing shooting after
noon, hitting just 40 percent
(26-for-65) of its floor attempts,
its lowest figure of the season.
"Their quickness and size
made us change a lot of our
shots," Dißiaso explained.
Perry's 21 points led all scor
ers, and Welch's 14 rebounds
topped the board figures. Di-
Biaso also praised Belton, who
finished with 13 points and 11
rebounds, as "outstanding."
