# Stanford reacts to Walsh rumors
## Going, going, going... gone? 
### 
Bill Walsh's coaching fu
ture may be up in the air for
the moment, but among as
sistant coaches, players,
students and faculty there
were many down to earth
opinions expressed about
the prospect of Walsh be
coming head coach for the
49ers. A sampling:
Fred vonAppen, assistant
coach (defensive line): "I'm
like Will Rogers, I only know
what I read in the papers.
"Stanford is a fine Univer
sity. They were able to win
before Bill Walsh and prob
ably will be able to win after
Bill Walsh is gone."
Dr. William Dement, pro
fessor of psychiatry: "I'm
devastated. Absolutely
crushed. But he should do
it. The 49ers are probably
his best opportunity.
"The thing is that Bill
Walsh is so perfect for Stan

ford. He's an intellectual.
He keeps the game in
perspective. I've never
heard him say the goal is to
win."
Cordon Banks, junior
flanker: "He's an outstand
ing man, and very good to
the program. I don't think
we'll falter too much; we'll
still be competitive. All of us
want him to stay. If it's a
good move for him and his
family we all wish him the
best."
Jeff Wachtel, senior: "If
he was going to go pro, I'm
glad he didn't go to New
York because he's too nice a
guy to go to the Giants."
Dennis Green, assistant
coach (running backs):
"The players will naturally
be disappointed. They have
all enjoyed playing for him,
but we all have to be mature
enough to realize that a per

son's career comes first."
Pat Bowe, junior right
end: "He's a great coach.
He likes it here and wants to
stay, but it's a business for
him. Whatever he does it
will be the right decision."
Steve Schramm, sopho
more: "I'm really surprised.
I thought he'd stay around
and win a Rose Bowl with
Nelson and Margerum and
those guys. He had a nuc
leus for a good team. I'm
pissed that he's leaving.
"Look at Chuck Fair
banks. He had one of the
best teams in the NFL and
he's going back to college.
Walsh is leaving one of the
best teams in college for the
worst team in the NFL. But
he's the type of person that
would go after a challenge
. . . and what can be more
of a challenge than the
49ers?"
Doug Single, assistant

coach (offensive line): "It
won't be a shock. It's some
thing we have been living
with for the past two years."
Bob Mooney, senior:
"It's bad news for Stanford
football as far as winning is
concerned, but I've been
kind of disappointed with
the recruiting tendencies
that have gone on since he's
taken over. He's got his eye
on football players more
than on students, and there
fore lets in lower-caliber
students. He looks at
academics more than most
football coaches do, but I
think we need someone
more low-keyed."
Shellye McKinney,
sophomore: "I'm hoping
he won't leave because he's
done so much for the prog
ram. I'd be really disap
pointed if he left, but I think
it's a lot better than when
Christiansen was here. It
would hurt us if he left."

best teams in college for the
worst team in the NFL. But
he's the type of person that
would go after a challenge
. . . and what can be more
of a challenge than the
49ers?"
Doug Single, assistant

coach (offensive line): "It
won't be a shock. It's some
thing we have been living
with for the past two years."
Bob Mooney, senior:
"It's bad news for Stanford
football as far as winning is
concerned, but I've been
kind of disappointed with
the recruiting tendencies
that have gone on since he's
taken over. He's got his eye
on football players more
than on students, and there
fore lets in lower-caliber
students. He looks at
academics more than most
football coaches do, but I
think we need someone
more low-keyed."
Shellye McKinney,
sophomore: "I'm hoping
he won't leave because he's
done so much for the prog
ram. I'd be really disap
pointed if he left, but I think
it's a lot better than when
Christiansen was here. It
would hurt us if he left."
