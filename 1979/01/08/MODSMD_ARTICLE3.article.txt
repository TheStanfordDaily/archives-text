# Medical Center billing investigation finished
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
The state Board of Medical Quality
Assurance (BMQA) has "substan
tially completed" its investigation of
the University Medical Center's bil
ling procedures and has turned the
case over to the attorney general's
office for possible legal action, a
BMQA official said Friday.
But neither the board nor the at
torney general can comment on the
results of the investigation because
that would violate an attorney-client
privilege, said Charleton Ftolland of
the attorney general's office and
Robert Rowland, BMQA executive
director.
The attorney general's office
serves as counsel for BMQA, a divi
sion of the state Department of Con
sumer Affairs.
"I'm saying the investigation is
substantially complete because we
will need to get more information if
the attorney general's office so re
quests," explained Rowland. "But as
of now, the case is in the hands of our
lawyers â€” the attorney general's of
fice."
As of Friday, no legal action had
been taken against the University,
Rowland said.
Professor charged University
The BMQA investigation of the
Medical Center began in October,
1977, when Dr. Eugene Dong, as
sociate professor of cardiovascular
surgery here, and the Union of
American Physicians (UAP) told the
board that the University was violat
ing the California Business Cod.e.
Section 2008 of that code states

that medical schools may make "no
charge for professional services
rendered to patients."
The investigation has since been
marked by several accusations of
conflict of interest. Rowland is the
son of a former Stanford business
manager, and two professors here
were recently elected to major posi
tions on the board.
'Defiant of public trust'
Because of this, Dr. Robert Wein
mann, president of UAP, has called
BMQA "synonomous with hypoc
risy" and has accused it of being
"blatantly defiant of its public trust."
Rowland called these claims "ir
responsible."
"Section 2008 has been on the
books for years," Rowland said Fri
day. "For 20 years now, Stanford has
been following the same billing pr
cedure and no government age cy
has looked into the matter. We
(BMQA) are the first to investigate
and now we're being accused of
being in Stanford's hip pocket."
The University's billing proce
dures will be scrutinized again today
as state legislators in the Assembly
Health Committee hear testimony
from Stanford, USC and Loma Linda
medical school officials, all of whom
have been accused of violating Sec
tion 2008.
The schools maintain they are
within the law because the code was
never meant to apply to private med
ical schools. University officials
further claim Stanford is not in viola
tion of the code because the medical
school bills on behalf of faculty
physicians, not on behalf of the in
stitution itself.
