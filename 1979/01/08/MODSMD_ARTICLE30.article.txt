# Dils directs TD drive
## West clobbered in Shrine game 
### MATTHEW KREPS 
If a sudden storm had blown up after the
first half to end the 54th Shrine All-Star
East-West Came right then and there,
Steve Dils, Cordy Ceresino and the rest of
the West team would have loved it.
A second-half storm did blow up, only
its name was Michigan fullback Russell
Davis. Davis ripped through the West de
fense for 199 yards and six touchdowns,
leading the East to a 56-17 rout, the biggest
in Shrine Came history, and breaking re
cords right and left before 72,000 fans at
Stanford Stadium last Saturday.
The East quarterbacks, Clemson's Steve
Fuller and Alabama's Jeff Rutledge, fulfil
led pre-game predictions by putting to
gether a devastating attack of option and
trap plays, passes to Missouri tight end
Kellen Winslow and runs up the porous
West middle by Davis, Willie McClendon
of Georgia and Maryland's Steve Atkins, to
score on every East possession in the sec
ond half.
Ceresino, whose eight tackles and two
assists couldn't keep the East out of the
end zone, said, "They came out and put
together a good option play ... we had
only four days to practice our defense. It's
supposed to be an offensive showcase,
but it wasn't supposed to be as much a

showcase as it turned out to be "
Rutledge and Turner, both masters of
the option, played to the flanks and
opened up the middle for Davis, Atkins
(who added two touchdowns to Davis' six)
and McClendon.
Meanwhile, an East defense that seem
ingly slept through the first half woke up
and shut down the West in the second,
holding Steve Dils to only 42 yards passing
and the West backs to another 42 yards.
Dils, who was "surprised how easy the
first drive was" when he hit his first four
passes for 58 yards and a TD, threw two
interceptions in the second half. "Our de
fense just got tired and we had to throw,"
Dils explained after the game. "They put a
bigger rush on me, and covered my re
ceivers a little better. They played better
than we did."
It was the other way around in the be
ginning, when Dils went seven for 10 for 84
yards and one TD pass to San Diego State's
tight end Don Warren to put the West
ahead, 7-0, in the first quarter.
Then a 36-yard punt return by Memphis
State's Ernest Grey set up Davis' first
touchdown run to tie the score.
UC-Davis quarterback Mike Moroski,
playing the second quarter, drove the
West down to the East's 23-yard line,

where St. Mary's Mike Shea kicked a 40-
yard field goal.
The West defense, which had stymied
the East so far, then took over when
California's Ralph Deloach snatched up a
Rutledge fumble and took it 17 yards to
make it 17-7 at half-time for the West.
After that, the West's roof fell in.
But the West's coach, Claude Gilbert of
San Diego State, had nothing but praise
for Dils and Ceresino, calling them both
"outstanding players."
Phil Francis, whose pulled groin injury
kept him out of practices and most of the
game, did play a few minutes in the first
half, rushing for nine yards and catching
one Moroski pass for seven yards before
retiring.
But, even though Stanford's stars
wound up on the wrong end of the score,
they weren't too disappointed.
"Overall, I did pretty well," Dils said.
"The first half was a lot of fun." What
about his chances in the pro draft? "The
game could help a little, hurt a little. I
really can't say."
Ceresino seemed to have the proper
perspective about the game, which be
nefits the Shriners' Hospitals for Crippled
Children: "No one's a loser, because it's
played for the crippled children."
