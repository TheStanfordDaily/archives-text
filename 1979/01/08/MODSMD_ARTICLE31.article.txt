Rioting breaks four day calm
Tehran, Iran — Hundreds of protesters set fires
and smashed windows in Tehran yesterday, re
newing demands for Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi's abdication and ending four days of rela
tive calm in the capital.
Anti-shah rioting was also reported in at least six
other cities and four persons reportedly were kil
led.
In the capital, heavily armed military police dis
persed protesters with tear gas and gunfire, and
one person was killed, officials said. The official
Paris news agency said a policeman was killed in
the western city of Hamadan and that two protes
ters died during a demonstration in Baneh, in
western Iran.
The official Iranian state radio said thousands
paraded in Qom and bank windows were smashed
in Tabriz. Opposition sources reported demonst
rations in Abadan and Khorram-shahr.
The four days of comparative calm that prevailed
while Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar formed a
new government halted after Paris-based Ayatul
lah Khomaini, the shah's chief religious opponent,
denounced the new government as "illegal" and
called for it to be overthrown.
A Bakhtiar aide, who declined to be identified,
said yesterday he expected anti-shah and anti-
Bakhtiar demonstrations to continue until the
shah's vacation begins and "Bakhtiar starts show
ing the people what his government can do."
Schlesinger fears Iranian oil cuts
Washington — Iran's ability to prod lice oil prob
ably has been permanently impaired by its domes
tic crisis and the United States may have to ease
domestic environmental restrictions to make up
the difference, says Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger.
Schlesinger conceded, however, that environ
mental concerns are a sensitive issue within the
administration and indicated his view is not shared
unanimously.
The secretary, in an interview yesterday on CBS'
Face the Nation, repeated earlier assurances that
the Iranian crisis will not affect U.S. supplies for
two to three months because of the availability of
other sources, including stockpiles.
But when a questioner referred to Iran resuming
full production, Schlesinger interrupted: "I think
we have to recognize now that Iranian production
is unlikely ever to return to the pre-crisis level.
"We should begin to plan for increasing produc
tion elsewhere," Schlesinger added, mentioning
specifically California and the North Slope of
Alaska.
Oil workers strike averted
Denver — The oil workers union declined last
night to call a nationwide strike, and said it in
tended to study further what its union president
said was an attractive offer from Amoco.

Following a two-hour, closed-door meeting
with the bargaining policy committee, A.F. Gros
piron, head of the Denver-based Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers International Union, said he
and the committee would resume study of the
Amoco proposal at 10 a.m. today.
The union's two-year contracts expired at mid
night local time last night.
No strikes were reported.
Hours before the strike deadline, the union of
60,000 refinery workers said it was studying some
new offers from oil companies in a contract dis
pute focusing on President Jimmy Carter's wage
guidelines.
In Washington, Energy Secretary lames
Schlesinger had said that if a strike is honored by
transportation unions, "They we could be in seri
ous trouble in the near term and the consequ
ences would be shortages and the need to take
actions to constrain demand."
There was no comment from the oil companies
on the possibility of a strike. But at big refinery
plants in Houston, at least three companies —
Shell, American Oil and Phillips —had supervisory
personnel standing by to take over shifts in the
event of a strike.
Britt expected to replace Milk
San Francisco — A 40-year-old homosexual au
ditor is expected to be named today to replace
slain city Supervisor Harvey Milk, giving San Fran
cisco's huge gay population a new political
spokesman.
The San Francisco Examiner reported Sunday
that Mayor Dianne Feinstein has chosen Harry
Britt to replace Milk on the Board of Supervisors.
Neither Britt nora mayoral spokesman would con
firm the appointment.
But Mel Wax, Feinstein's spokesman, said the
mayor had made her decision and would reveal it
at a news conference today.
Britt, a native of Port Arthur, Tex., and a former
Methodist minister and one-time letter carrier,
works as a hotel accountant. He is president of the
Harvey Milk Cay Democratic Club.
Britt came to San Francisco in 1971 from Dallas,
where he obtained his divinity degree from
Southern Methodist University.
Cameras click aboard Voyager I
Pasadena — As Voyager 1 homed in on the giant
planet of Jupiter yesterday, a spokesman for the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory here said cameras
aboard the spacecraft were sending "fantastic"
pictures of the approach back to Earth.
The mission officially got underway Saturday,
when Voyager 1 cameras clicked on 37 million
miles from the Jovian surface. The first transmis
sions were received Saturday afternoon, said JPL
spokesman Frank Bristow.
The craft is scheduled to zoom within 174,000
miles of the surface on March 5, cameras and other
instruments whirring away.

One of the mission's major functions will be to
photograph Jupiter's five inner
said.
As seen from Earth, Bristow said the moons —
five of Jupiter's 13 or 14 satellites — appear to glow
when they emerge from behind the hydrogen
cloud-covered planet. One of the moons, 10, is
trailed by a cloud believed to be made of sodium.
Instruments aboard Voyager 1 will record informa
tion about those moons, as well as the planet, he
said.
Baker to meet with Soviets
Moscow — Senate Minority Leader Howard
Baker and five other Republican senators arrived
in the Soviet Union yesterday for a series of high
level meetings with Soviet officials on the strategic
arms limitation talks and other issues.
Baker, of Tennessee, was quoted in an interview
with the Soviet news agency Tass as saying the visit
came "at a very important time" for the United
States because of the continuing talks on SALT 11.
He said he was confident the Senate would ratify a
treaty.
Filipinos to head U.S. bases
Manila, Philippines — The United States and the
Philippine government signed documents yester
day that will put two key Pacific U.S. military bases
under Filipino commanders, but leave Americans
in control.
Philippine Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile
said last month Clark Air Force base, 50 miles north
of Manila and Subic Naval Base, 45 miles to the
northwest, did little for Philippine security, and
basically served only the security interests of the
United States.
But Marcos said yesterday they would
"strengthen security not only of the Philippines
and the United States but also the entire Western
Pacific region."
Guerrilla gunfire kills four
Beirut, Lebanon — Warring guerrilla factions ex
changed gunfire in a refugee camp north of here
over the weekend, leaving four dead and six
wounded, Palestinian sources said yesterday.
In Beirut, police said shooting yesterday bet
ween right-wing Christians and Syrian soldiers left
one Lebanese dead and four wounded.
The inter-guerrilla fighting between Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Al Fatah guerrilla group and
the Marxist Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine coincided with the 14th anniversary of
the launching of the Palestinian guerrilla move
ment in Beirut.
Today's weather
Rain likely through tomorrow. Little change in
temperature, with lows near 50 and highs from 55

The union's two-year contracts expired at mid
night local time last night.
No strikes were reported.
Hours before the strike deadline, the union of
60,000 refinery workers said it was studying some
new offers from oil companies in a contract dis
pute focusing on President Jimmy Carter's wage
guidelines.
In Washington, Energy Secretary lames
Schlesinger had said that if a strike is honored by
transportation unions, "They we could be in seri
ous trouble in the near term and the consequ
ences would be shortages and the need to take
actions to constrain demand."
There was no comment from the oil companies
on the possibility of a strike. But at big refinery
plants in Houston, at least three companies —
Shell, American Oil and Phillips —had supervisory
personnel standing by to take over shifts in the
event of a strike.

Cameras click aboard Voyager I
Pasadena — As Voyager 1 homed in on the giant
planet of Jupiter yesterday, a spokesman for the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory here said cameras
aboard the spacecraft were sending "fantastic"
pictures of the approach back to Earth.
The mission officially got underway Saturday,
when Voyager 1 cameras clicked on 37 million
miles from the Jovian surface. The first transmis
sions were received Saturday afternoon, said JPL
spokesman Frank Bristow.
The craft is scheduled to zoom within 174,000
miles of the surface on March 5, cameras and other
instruments whirring away.

One of the mission's major functions will be to
photograph Jupiter's five inner
said.
As seen from Earth, Bristow said the moons —
five of Jupiter's 13 or 14 satellites — appear to glow
when they emerge from behind the hydrogen
cloud-covered planet. One of the moons, 10, is
trailed by a cloud believed to be made of sodium.
Instruments aboard Voyager 1 will record informa
tion about those moons, as well as the planet, he
said.
Baker to meet with Soviets

Filipinos to head U.S. bases
Manila, Philippines — The United States and the
Philippine government signed documents yester
day that will put two key Pacific U.S. military bases
under Filipino commanders, but leave Americans
in control.
Philippine Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile
said last month Clark Air Force base, 50 miles north
of Manila and Subic Naval Base, 45 miles to the
northwest, did little for Philippine security, and
basically served only the security interests of the
United States.
But Marcos said yesterday they would
"strengthen security not only of the Philippines
and the United States but also the entire Western
Pacific region."
Guerrilla gunfire kills four

the Marxist Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine coincided with the 14th anniversary of
the launching of the Palestinian guerrilla move
ment in Beirut.

Rioting breaks four day calm
Tehran, Iran — Hundreds of protesters set fires
and smashed windows in Tehran yesterday, re
newing demands for Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi's abdication and ending four days of rela
tive calm in the capital.
Anti-shah rioting was also reported in at least six
other cities and four persons reportedly were kil
led.
In the capital, heavily armed military police dis
persed protesters with tear gas and gunfire, and
one person was killed, officials said. The official
Paris news agency said a policeman was killed in
the western city of Hamadan and that two protes
ters died during a demonstration in Baneh, in
western Iran.
The official Iranian state radio said thousands
paraded in Qom and bank windows were smashed
in Tabriz. Opposition sources reported demonst
rations in Abadan and Khorram-shahr.
The four days of comparative calm that prevailed
while Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar formed a
new government halted after Paris-based Ayatul
lah Khomaini, the shah's chief religious opponent,
denounced the new government as "illegal" and
called for it to be overthrown.
A Bakhtiar aide, who declined to be identified,
said yesterday he expected anti-shah and anti-
Bakhtiar demonstrations to continue until the
shah's vacation begins and "Bakhtiar starts show
ing the people what his government can do."
Schlesinger fears Iranian oil cuts
Washington — Iran's ability to prod lice oil prob
ably has been permanently impaired by its domes
tic crisis and the United States may have to ease
domestic environmental restrictions to make up
the difference, says Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger.
Schlesinger conceded, however, that environ
mental concerns are a sensitive issue within the
administration and indicated his view is not shared
unanimously.
The secretary, in an interview yesterday on CBS'
Face the Nation, repeated earlier assurances that
the Iranian crisis will not affect U.S. supplies for
two to three months because of the availability of
other sources, including stockpiles.
But when a questioner referred to Iran resuming
full production, Schlesinger interrupted: "I think
we have to recognize now that Iranian production
is unlikely ever to return to the pre-crisis level.
"We should begin to plan for increasing produc
tion elsewhere," Schlesinger added, mentioning
specifically California and the North Slope of
Alaska.
