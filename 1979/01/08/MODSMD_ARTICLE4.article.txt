# Palo Alto may ban age discrimination
## 
### ALI WEBB 
Landlords may be forced to take
down "Adults Only" signs if a new
Palo Alto ordinance prohibiting age
discrimination in housing is passed.
Human Relations Commissioner
Doug Winslow plans to present the
ordinance that he drafted to the
Human Relations Commission at the
commission's January 11 meeting.
Palo Alto would join the cities of
Berkeley and San Francisco which al
ready prohibit discrimination on the
basis of "age, parenthood, pre
gnancy or the presence of a jninor
child," Winslow said. Forty-eight
percent of Palo Alto residents are
renters, according to W'nslow.
"The situation has gotten out of
hand," he stated, referring to a 1977
study by the Midpeninsula Citizens
for Fair Housing (MCFH), a private
anti-discrimination agency. The
study reported that 75 percent of all
Palo Alto rentals exclude children.
"One third of the population of
Palo Alto resides in units banning
children," siated Winslow.
"We are in an emergency situation
in terms of housing for families,"
said Beverly Mann, co-founder of the
United Families for Fair Housing and
mother of two. "We searched for a
place to rent for 2Vi years before we
found our present house," she said.
"You don't know what it feels like to
have the door slammed in your face
that many times."
Property rights
The Mann family rented in Santa
Clara before finding their present re
sidence in Palo Alto. Mann organized
the United Families group with the
goal of passing local ordinances
against family discrimination in hous
ing.
But landlords in Palo Alto feel that
they have a right to protect their in
vestments against children.
"As a landlord over the past 15
years, I've seen what damage chil
dren can do. I prefer to rent to
adults," said one rental property
owner who is the mother of three
and a kindergarten teacher.
Her kids' damage
"I've seen the kind of damage that
my own kids can do and I consider
them well-behaved. I don't like the
idea of the government telling me
who I can and cannot rent to," she
said.
Winslow sees discrimination
against families as a bigger issue than
the rights of property owners vs. the

rights of children.
"The key is the right of families to
decent housing," he said.
Effects of discrimination
Age discrimination in housing al
lows for unequal distribution of
families with children and a "cluster
ing effect," according to Winslow.
"Census tract information provided
in the 'Community Profile' of January
1978 indicates that children are not
equally distributed throughout the
community," he said. The areas of
highest rental density are some of
the lowest in numbers of children,
Winslow said.
Another serious effect is that racial
and ethnic minorities are more likely
to be the victims of child discrimina
tion, according to Winslow.
"A children's ghetto is created be
cause there are so few apartment
complexes open to families," said
Mann. "All the families are stuck in
one place together, causing higher
than normal use and the complexes
get run-down. The children are then
accused of being destructive; it's a
vicious cycle."
Fears stereotyping
Palo Alto City Council member
Ellen Fletcher said she sees the
stereotyping of children as the more
destructive fact in the long run.
Winslow agrees.
"Often children are aware of the
pressures that have been imposed
on their parents — which could make
any child feel burdening and un
wanted by society," he said.
Fletcher said she believes the time
for action is now.
"The longer we wait to do some
thing about this, the older the popu
lation becomes and the less sym
pathetic they grow to the plight of
families," she said.
Average age rising
The population of Palo Alto is in
deed growing older, according to the
city's Comprehensive Plan. "At the
same time that the percentage of
seniors is rising, the percentage of
children is decreasing," stated the
report. Two elementary schools will
be closed this year in response to a
decline in enrollment, according to
the Palo Alto Unified School District.
Palo Alto is committed by its
Comprehensive Plan to the encour
agement and development of hous
ing suitable to families with children.
"I am concerned that we are forc
ing families out of Palo Alto and that
really worries me," said Winslow.

place to rent for 2Vi years before we
found our present house," she said.
"You don't know what it feels like to
have the door slammed in your face
that many times."
Property rights
The Mann family rented in Santa
Clara before finding their present re
sidence in Palo Alto. Mann organized
the United Families group with the
goal of passing local ordinances
against family discrimination in hous
ing.
But landlords in Palo Alto feel that
they have a right to protect their in
vestments against children.
"As a landlord over the past 15
years, I've seen what damage chil
dren can do. I prefer to rent to
adults," said one rental property
owner who is the mother of three
and a kindergarten teacher.
Her kids' damage
"I've seen the kind of damage that
my own kids can do and I consider
them well-behaved. I don't like the
idea of the government telling me
who I can and cannot rent to," she
said.
Winslow sees discrimination
against families as a bigger issue than
the rights of property owners vs. the

rights of children.
"The key is the right of families to
decent housing," he said.
Effects of discrimination
Age discrimination in housing al
lows for unequal distribution of
families with children and a "cluster
ing effect," according to Winslow.
"Census tract information provided
in the 'Community Profile' of January
1978 indicates that children are not
equally distributed throughout the
community," he said. The areas of
highest rental density are some of
the lowest in numbers of children,
Winslow said.
Another serious effect is that racial
and ethnic minorities are more likely
to be the victims of child discrimina
tion, according to Winslow.
"A children's ghetto is created be
cause there are so few apartment
complexes open to families," said
Mann. "All the families are stuck in
one place together, causing higher
than normal use and the complexes
get run-down. The children are then
accused of being destructive; it's a
vicious cycle."
Fears stereotyping
Palo Alto City Council member
Ellen Fletcher said she sees the
stereotyping of children as the more
destructive fact in the long run.
Winslow agrees.
"Often children are aware of the
pressures that have been imposed
on their parents — which could make
any child feel burdening and un
wanted by society," he said.
Fletcher said she believes the time
for action is now.
"The longer we wait to do some
thing about this, the older the popu
lation becomes and the less sym
pathetic they grow to the plight of
families," she said.
Average age rising
The population of Palo Alto is in
deed growing older, according to the
city's Comprehensive Plan. "At the
same time that the percentage of
seniors is rising, the percentage of
children is decreasing," stated the
report. Two elementary schools will
be closed this year in response to a
decline in enrollment, according to
the Palo Alto Unified School District.
Palo Alto is committed by its
Comprehensive Plan to the encour
agement and development of hous
ing suitable to families with children.
"I am concerned that we are forc
ing families out of Palo Alto and that
really worries me," said Winslow.

Landlords may be forced to take
down "Adults Only" signs if a new
Palo Alto ordinance prohibiting age
discrimination in housing is passed.
Human Relations Commissioner
Doug Winslow plans to present the
ordinance that he drafted to the
Human Relations Commission at the
commission's January 11 meeting.
Palo Alto would join the cities of
Berkeley and San Francisco which al
ready prohibit discrimination on the
basis of "age, parenthood, pre
gnancy or the presence of a jninor
child," Winslow said. Forty-eight
percent of Palo Alto residents are
renters, according to W'nslow.
"The situation has gotten out of
hand," he stated, referring to a 1977
study by the Midpeninsula Citizens
for Fair Housing (MCFH), a private
anti-discrimination agency. The
study reported that 75 percent of all
Palo Alto rentals exclude children.
"One third of the population of
Palo Alto resides in units banning
children," siated Winslow.
"We are in an emergency situation
in terms of housing for families,"
said Beverly Mann, co-founder of the
United Families for Fair Housing and
mother of two. "We searched for a
place to rent for 2Vi years before we
found our present house," she said.
"You don't know what it feels like to
have the door slammed in your face
that many times."
