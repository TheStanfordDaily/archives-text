# USE members seek Hardy's resignation
## 
### REBECCA MOSS 
An apparent misunderstanding of
what manager of Plant Services
Roger Hardy said at a June 8 United
Stanford Employees (USE) meeting
prompted 52 USE members to sign a
petition in December that many are
reluctant to talk about now.
The petition, dated December 8,
called for Hardy either to fulfill the
promises he allegedly made to the
June 8 meeting or resign.
According to locksmith Ernie
Clouse, who circulated the petition,
Hardy had promised the workers
that:
— their wages would be raised to a
level comparable to wages earned by
colleagues outside the University;
— an apprenticeship program
would be initiated; and
— that there would be adequate
help in each shop to efficiently oper
ate without any speed-ups or over
working of employees.
Clouse maintained that at the June
8 meeting, Hardy said he would res
ign if he had not achieved these goals
in six months. Clouse added that the
six months have expired without the
promises being fulfilled.
Clouse claimed that most of the
140 workers under Hardy are dissatis
fied with his performance, and that
there are only eight to 10 people who
like him. His own dissatisfaction with
Hardy dates back to the signing of
USE's present contract two years ago
when Hardy was USE president.
Down the drain
"He (Hardy) sold people down the
drain in order to achieve his own
personal gain," Clouse charged.
But Hardy, who said that Clouse
has "a personal axe to grind,"
claimed his comments at the June 8
meeting were misinterpreted, and
that "the majority (of the petitions
claims) is a fabrication."
According to Hardy, he merely
tried to outline the direction of man
agement by presenting an overview

of service operations and describing
his goals for the next six months.
He claimed he told the employees
at the meeting that he wanted to es
tablish adequate care of University
buildings, which, he said, meant re
novating buildings so they would be
in good enough shape to be main
tained properly.
This, in turn, meant setting up an
apprenticeship program, according
to Hardy, which would require
employing "more people and more
expertise."
"They translated this into my say
ing that I would give them more
money and more people," Hardy
said.
Vested interest
Hardy claimed Clouse has "a ves
ted interest and is somewhat self
serving." He explained that recently
one locksmith has retired who has
not been replaced and that Clouse
wants more locksmiths.
But Clouse said that the petition
"was exactly Hardy's words," and
that "if he can't live up to his prom
ises, obviously he will change them
around to.fit his fancy."
Workers under Hardy contacted
by the Daily, some of whom had
signed the petition, were often reluc
tanttotalk aboutthe issue, and those
who did comment gave conflicting
accounts.
A majority
lack Foley, a worker who signed
the petition, said, "it goes way back
to when Roger Hardy was president
of the union and the things that he
said at the time that don't pan out."
But when asked if Hardy should
resign, Foley responded, "No, I
don't think he should resign."
Asked if Clouse and the petition
represented the feeling of the major
ity of the workers, another worker
commented, "I think he does,
maybe not 100 percent, but almost."
Yet a third worker, Brian Collins,
said, "I don't think anybody cares."
A meeting between Hardy and
workers last month apparently did
nothing to resolve the problem.
Hardy attributed the whole con
flict to the fact that "we are in the
midst of management/union labor
negotiations and the union wants to
develop anti-management issues.
One way of doing this is to accuse the
management of promising things
(and not delivering) — that'sall that's
happening here!"

In the month since the petition was
circulated, Hardy said, "half a dozen
of those who signed it came up to me
and admitted that it was a bunch of
bullshit."
Clouse, on the other hand, said
that Hardy's claim was "bullshit" and
said that "if anyone did apologize I
would like to know who the hell it
was."
None of the workers contacted by
the Daily werewilling to admit to hav
ing apologized to Hardy.
