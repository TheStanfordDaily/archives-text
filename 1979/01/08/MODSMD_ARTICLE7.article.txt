# From hang gliders to cable car brakes
## Engineering students invent useful devices 
### PETER VAN SICKEL 
How do you teach a group of
students to build things when
each wants to build something
different? The design division
of the School of Engineering
offers a sequence of courses
beginning in autumn quarter
with Mechanical Engineering
(ME) 111, a course on engineer
ing materials and continuing
winter quarter with ME 112, a
course on mechanical systems.
The sequence finishes in the
spring with ME 113, acourseon
engineering design.
Students, working in groups
or individually, take these
courses to learn to build pro
jects as diverse as a hang
glider, a tonearm tracking
mechanism, or a brake system
for San Francisco cable cars.
Each project is developed from
an initial idea to a working pro
totype.
Dr. Ernest Chilton, ME pro
fessor, taught the sequence
courses last year. Chilton sees

his role as a "teacher. A stu
dent who comes to Stanford to
learn engineering wants to
build things and to do things. I
see myself as a provider of
materials and information for
the students to use. My role is
to be a facilitator of learning."
Chilton said his primary ob
jective "is to teach students
problem solving techniques."
He explained that this involves
teaching a student to make
judgments on particular design
alternatives; to devise experi
ments that lead to greater un
derstanding of a particular
problem; to know where and
how to get more information
on a particular subject. "If we
can teach a student these
techniques, then the particular
subjects taught are of relatively
minor importance."
Rick Tompane, one of Chil
ton's graduate students, said,
"Ernie emphasizes the process
of doing the design and know
ing where to find solutions to a

problem rather than the solu
tion itself.
"Some students don't like
this. They want to be spoon
fed. His courses weren't the
kind where you sat in lecture
and turned in a problem set
each week.
"I think his emphasis reflects
how things are in the real
world. There isn't going to be
someone in industry telling
you solutions to design prob
lems."
Since 1975, Lonnie Kroo,
ano'her graduate student
here, has been building and
testing approximately 100 de
sign models for a stable and
controllable hang glider. Kroo
enjoys the freedom of Chil
ton's classes. "His course ena
bled people to work pretty
much on their own as long as
they were well-focused. You
had to be highly self
motivated. If you didn't know
what you wanted to do it could
be a problem."
The primary method for
learning problem solving is to
work on projects.
Chilton has found that one
half of his students work best
when assigned a specific pro
ject. However, he encourages
students to devise their own
project topics.
"Deciding on a project is
more difficult than you might
think. You could easily spend a
term researching ideas for pro
jects. Any way you can come
up with a good idea, people
will jump at it," Tompane, in
ventor of a perfectly-tracking
phonograph tonearm, said.
"I had two main criteria for
choosing a project," he con
tinued. "It had to be some
thing useful and I wanted the
project to have educational
value. I wanted it to teach me
something in detail about at
least one of the standard en
gineering concepts."
By working in groups, stu
dents benefit from the ideas
and inspirations of their fellow
inventors. While one person
may have the idea for what to
make, others will have ideas on
how to make it.
Tompane explained how his

group generated design ideas.
"We might spend a night a
week for a couple of weeks just
brainstorming. Nothing is out
lawed except criticizing
another person's ideas. We
might have a piece of butcher
paper taped on a wall and use
felt tipped pens to sketch
thingsout. Eventually you have
to choose the ideas that appear
to be the most promising."
Tompane also said that in
teracting with other students
helped him in his designs.
"Working in a group helps to
avoid making mistakes. If we
were all brilliant maybe we
wouldn't need to work in
groups. But I think a group of
three is ideal. When you de
sign something you find egos
get involved and sometimes
they clash. But with three usu
ally you can get at least two to
agree and overrule the other
guy. You learn to keep your
mind open to other ideas. You
learn to prove your case. If you
have an idea you think is bet
ter, you have to prove it to the
other members of the group."
Chilton allows students to
criticize each other's work. He
explained, "Students don't get
enough opportunity to exer
cise judgment. They are usu
ally the ones on the receiving
end of criticism. It's important
to teach students how to look
at someone else's work criti
cally. I have the students ask
themselves if they could build
the project given the plans and
description of another stu
dent."
Engineering design is a per
sonal endeavor. Tompane
said, "A design is a product of
your life experiences. Bits and
pieces of your life come to
gether and are reflected in
your design, sometimes sub
tly, other times more
explicitly. For example, the
light switches in the house my
parents live in are never where
you need them or expect them
to be. And the shower heads
are all too low. If I ever design a
house, the light switches are
going to be in the right places
and the shower heads are
going to be high enough.

Those are just examples, and
they're little things. But you
take all the bits and pieces of
information you read in
magazines or books, or some
thing you saw or did, or talked
to someone about and say,
'That's not exactly what I want,
but if I change it just a little it
can work for this design.' "
Kroo considers his designs
to be "a synthesis of know
ledge and experience. In the
past, people designed hang
gliders pretty much by trial and
error. Recently it has become
more analytical." He said many
of his ideas come from the
same theories of aerodynamics
that apply to jet airplanes.
"But," he said, "there are a lot
of complicated things that
don't fit so nicely into formulas
and you have to make deci
sions based on experience and
testing." Kroo has used self
constructed models to test var
ious design ideas. His hang
gliding experience has pro
vided the intuitive understand
ing he needed to create his
most recent prototype.
Engineering design is not a
static process. Both Kroo and
Tompane said there is a lot of
trial and redesign involved in
completing a project, as origi
nal ideas are tested. "Very few
people can visualize some
thing so well in their head that
they can put it down on paper,
then go build it and have it
work just the way they said it
would. Initial designs on paper
and actual finished products
are two different things,"
Tompane said.
Chilton, too, is involved in a
design process using "prob
lem solving techniques." Very
little about his" teaching is
"usual." He said, "In this divi
sion we are continually chang
ing and experimenting with
new ways of teaching, not just
for the sake of change but for
finding ways to improve. In es
sence Chilton and his as
sociates in the design division
aretrying to create an optimum
environment in which students
like Kroo and Tompane are
able "to build things and to do
things."

How do you teach a group of
students to build things when
each wants to build something
different? The design division
of the School of Engineering
offers a sequence of courses
beginning in autumn quarter
with Mechanical Engineering
(ME) 111, a course on engineer
ing materials and continuing
winter quarter with ME 112, a
course on mechanical systems.
The sequence finishes in the
spring with ME 113, acourseon
engineering design.
Students, working in groups
or individually, take these
courses to learn to build pro
jects as diverse as a hang
glider, a tonearm tracking
mechanism, or a brake system
for San Francisco cable cars.
Each project is developed from
an initial idea to a working pro
totype.
Dr. Ernest Chilton, ME pro
fessor, taught the sequence
courses last year. Chilton sees

his role as a "teacher. A stu
dent who comes to Stanford to
learn engineering wants to
build things and to do things. I
see myself as a provider of
materials and information for
the students to use. My role is
to be a facilitator of learning."
Chilton said his primary ob
jective "is to teach students
problem solving techniques."
He explained that this involves
teaching a student to make
judgments on particular design
alternatives; to devise experi
ments that lead to greater un
derstanding of a particular
problem; to know where and
how to get more information
on a particular subject. "If we
can teach a student these
techniques, then the particular
subjects taught are of relatively
minor importance."
Rick Tompane, one of Chil
ton's graduate students, said,
"Ernie emphasizes the process
of doing the design and know
ing where to find solutions to a

problem rather than the solu
tion itself.
"Some students don't like
this. They want to be spoon
fed. His courses weren't the
kind where you sat in lecture
and turned in a problem set
each week.
"I think his emphasis reflects
how things are in the real
world. There isn't going to be
someone in industry telling
you solutions to design prob
lems."
Since 1975, Lonnie Kroo,
ano'her graduate student
here, has been building and
testing approximately 100 de
sign models for a stable and
controllable hang glider. Kroo
enjoys the freedom of Chil
ton's classes. "His course ena
bled people to work pretty
much on their own as long as
they were well-focused. You
had to be highly self
motivated. If you didn't know
what you wanted to do it could
be a problem."
The primary method for
learning problem solving is to
work on projects.
Chilton has found that one
half of his students work best
when assigned a specific pro
ject. However, he encourages
students to devise their own
project topics.
"Deciding on a project is
more difficult than you might
think. You could easily spend a
term researching ideas for pro
jects. Any way you can come
up with a good idea, people
will jump at it," Tompane, in
ventor of a perfectly-tracking
phonograph tonearm, said.
"I had two main criteria for
choosing a project," he con
tinued. "It had to be some
thing useful and I wanted the
project to have educational
value. I wanted it to teach me
something in detail about at
least one of the standard en
gineering concepts."
By working in groups, stu
dents benefit from the ideas
and inspirations of their fellow
inventors. While one person
may have the idea for what to
make, others will have ideas on
how to make it.
Tompane explained how his

group generated design ideas.
"We might spend a night a
week for a couple of weeks just
brainstorming. Nothing is out
lawed except criticizing
another person's ideas. We
might have a piece of butcher
paper taped on a wall and use
felt tipped pens to sketch
thingsout. Eventually you have
to choose the ideas that appear
to be the most promising."
Tompane also said that in
teracting with other students
helped him in his designs.
"Working in a group helps to
avoid making mistakes. If we
were all brilliant maybe we
wouldn't need to work in
groups. But I think a group of
three is ideal. When you de
sign something you find egos
get involved and sometimes
they clash. But with three usu
ally you can get at least two to
agree and overrule the other
guy. You learn to keep your
mind open to other ideas. You
learn to prove your case. If you
have an idea you think is bet
ter, you have to prove it to the
other members of the group."
Chilton allows students to
criticize each other's work. He
explained, "Students don't get
enough opportunity to exer
cise judgment. They are usu
ally the ones on the receiving
end of criticism. It's important
to teach students how to look
at someone else's work criti
cally. I have the students ask
themselves if they could build
the project given the plans and
description of another stu
dent."
Engineering design is a per
sonal endeavor. Tompane
said, "A design is a product of
your life experiences. Bits and
pieces of your life come to
gether and are reflected in
your design, sometimes sub
tly, other times more
explicitly. For example, the
light switches in the house my
parents live in are never where
you need them or expect them
to be. And the shower heads
are all too low. If I ever design a
house, the light switches are
going to be in the right places
and the shower heads are
going to be high enough.

Those are just examples, and
they're little things. But you
take all the bits and pieces of
information you read in
magazines or books, or some
thing you saw or did, or talked
to someone about and say,
'That's not exactly what I want,
but if I change it just a little it
can work for this design.' "
Kroo considers his designs
to be "a synthesis of know
ledge and experience. In the
past, people designed hang
gliders pretty much by trial and
error. Recently it has become
more analytical." He said many
of his ideas come from the
same theories of aerodynamics
that apply to jet airplanes.
"But," he said, "there are a lot
of complicated things that
don't fit so nicely into formulas
and you have to make deci
sions based on experience and
testing." Kroo has used self
constructed models to test var
ious design ideas. His hang
gliding experience has pro
vided the intuitive understand
ing he needed to create his
most recent prototype.
Engineering design is not a
static process. Both Kroo and
Tompane said there is a lot of
trial and redesign involved in
completing a project, as origi
nal ideas are tested. "Very few
people can visualize some
thing so well in their head that
they can put it down on paper,
then go build it and have it
work just the way they said it
would. Initial designs on paper
and actual finished products
are two different things,"
Tompane said.

How do you teach a group of
students to build things when
each wants to build something
different? The design division
of the School of Engineering
offers a sequence of courses
beginning in autumn quarter
with Mechanical Engineering
(ME) 111, a course on engineer
ing materials and continuing
winter quarter with ME 112, a
course on mechanical systems.
The sequence finishes in the
spring with ME 113, acourseon
engineering design.
Students, working in groups
or individually, take these
courses to learn to build pro
jects as diverse as a hang
glider, a tonearm tracking
mechanism, or a brake system
for San Francisco cable cars.
Each project is developed from
an initial idea to a working pro
totype.
Dr. Ernest Chilton, ME pro
fessor, taught the sequence
courses last year. Chilton sees

his role as a "teacher. A stu
dent who comes to Stanford to
learn engineering wants to
build things and to do things. I
see myself as a provider of
materials and information for
the students to use. My role is
to be a facilitator of learning."
Chilton said his primary ob
jective "is to teach students
problem solving techniques."
He explained that this involves
teaching a student to make
judgments on particular design
alternatives; to devise experi
ments that lead to greater un
derstanding of a particular
problem; to know where and
how to get more information
on a particular subject. "If we
can teach a student these
techniques, then the particular
subjects taught are of relatively
minor importance."
Rick Tompane, one of Chil
ton's graduate students, said,
"Ernie emphasizes the process
of doing the design and know
ing where to find solutions to a

problem rather than the solu
tion itself.
"Some students don't like
this. They want to be spoon
fed. His courses weren't the
kind where you sat in lecture
and turned in a problem set
each week.
"I think his emphasis reflects
how things are in the real
world. There isn't going to be
someone in industry telling
you solutions to design prob
lems."
Since 1975, Lonnie Kroo,
ano'her graduate student
here, has been building and
testing approximately 100 de
sign models for a stable and
controllable hang glider. Kroo
enjoys the freedom of Chil
ton's classes. "His course ena
bled people to work pretty
much on their own as long as
they were well-focused. You
had to be highly self
motivated. If you didn't know
what you wanted to do it could
be a problem."
The primary method for
learning problem solving is to
work on projects.
Chilton has found that one
half of his students work best
when assigned a specific pro
ject. However, he encourages
students to devise their own
project topics.
"Deciding on a project is
more difficult than you might
think. You could easily spend a
term researching ideas for pro
jects. Any way you can come
up with a good idea, people
will jump at it," Tompane, in
ventor of a perfectly-tracking
phonograph tonearm, said.
"I had two main criteria for
choosing a project," he con
tinued. "It had to be some
thing useful and I wanted the
project to have educational
value. I wanted it to teach me
something in detail about at
least one of the standard en
gineering concepts."
By working in groups, stu
dents benefit from the ideas
and inspirations of their fellow
inventors. While one person
may have the idea for what to
make, others will have ideas on
how to make it.
Tompane explained how his

group generated design ideas.
"We might spend a night a
week for a couple of weeks just
brainstorming. Nothing is out
lawed except criticizing
another person's ideas. We
might have a piece of butcher
paper taped on a wall and use
felt tipped pens to sketch
thingsout. Eventually you have
to choose the ideas that appear
to be the most promising."
Tompane also said that in
teracting with other students
helped him in his designs.
"Working in a group helps to
avoid making mistakes. If we
were all brilliant maybe we
wouldn't need to work in
groups. But I think a group of
three is ideal. When you de
sign something you find egos
get involved and sometimes
they clash. But with three usu
ally you can get at least two to
agree and overrule the other
guy. You learn to keep your
mind open to other ideas. You
learn to prove your case. If you
have an idea you think is bet
ter, you have to prove it to the
other members of the group."
Chilton allows students to
criticize each other's work. He
explained, "Students don't get
enough opportunity to exer
cise judgment. They are usu
ally the ones on the receiving
end of criticism. It's important
to teach students how to look
at someone else's work criti
cally. I have the students ask
themselves if they could build
the project given the plans and
description of another stu
dent."
Engineering design is a per
sonal endeavor. Tompane
said, "A design is a product of
your life experiences. Bits and
pieces of your life come to
gether and are reflected in
your design, sometimes sub
tly, other times more
explicitly. For example, the
light switches in the house my
parents live in are never where
you need them or expect them
to be. And the shower heads
are all too low. If I ever design a
house, the light switches are
going to be in the right places
and the shower heads are
going to be high enough.

Those are just examples, and
they're little things. But you
take all the bits and pieces of
information you read in
magazines or books, or some
thing you saw or did, or talked
to someone about and say,
'That's not exactly what I want,
but if I change it just a little it
can work for this design.' "
Kroo considers his designs
to be "a synthesis of know
ledge and experience. In the
past, people designed hang
gliders pretty much by trial and
error. Recently it has become
more analytical." He said many
of his ideas come from the
same theories of aerodynamics
that apply to jet airplanes.
"But," he said, "there are a lot
of complicated things that
don't fit so nicely into formulas
and you have to make deci
sions based on experience and
testing." Kroo has used self
constructed models to test var
ious design ideas. His hang
gliding experience has pro
vided the intuitive understand
ing he needed to create his
most recent prototype.
Engineering design is not a
static process. Both Kroo and
Tompane said there is a lot of
trial and redesign involved in
completing a project, as origi
nal ideas are tested. "Very few

thing so well in their head that
