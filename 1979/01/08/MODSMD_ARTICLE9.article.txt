# Rand report reveals Nixon forced peace

Santa Monica (AP) — Former President Richard Nixon forced
South Vietnam to sign the 1973 Paris accords by threatening to cut
off all support money, a new Rand Corp. report reveals.
The report, issued Saturday, was compiled by Rand "think
tank" researchers after interviewing South Vietnamese leaders in
exile. It attributed the eventual fall of South Vietnam in 1975 to
misunderstandings, impatience, corruption and gullibility.
The peace accords of 1973 were made possible by some arm
twisting on the part of Nixon, the report said. Bui Diem, Saigon's
ambassador to Washington from 1967 to 1972, told researchers
that Nixon sent South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu
"painful" messages demanding that Thieu sign the Paris agree
ments.
Diem quoted one Nixon message as saying: "I am firmly con
vinced that the alternative to signing the present agreement is a
total cutoff of funds to assist your country."
The report also indicated that Thieu believed, right up to the
fall of South Vietnam, that the United States would come to their
rescue. He had been privately guaranteed by Nixon at a San
Clemente meeting in 1973 that the U.S. would not "abandon"
South Vietnam, the report said.
And one day after Nixon resigned, President Gerald Ford sent
Thieu a message assuring him that his administration would con
tinue to support South Vietnam following "a policy of five presi
dents."
After the Paris accords were signed and American troops were
withdrawn, the report said, South Vietnamese dependence on
American support became evident.
"The South Vietnamese soldier had been 'conditioned' by the
U.S. presence to rely on vast air and artillery support in combat
and had 'forgotten how to walk,' being used to motorized and air
transportation — military resources that became increasingly
scarce after 1972," the report concluded.
