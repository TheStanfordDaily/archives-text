# Chomsky begins Kant lecture series here
## 
### JOHN DEAN 
Speaking before an overflow audi
ence of about 300, with people
crowding the aisles, and many others
turned away to their dismay at the
door, Prof. Noam Chomsky of Mas
sacusettts Institute of Technology
opened his two-week lecture stay
here last night.
The noted philosopher, linguist
and critic is visiting the University as
the lecturer for the 1979 Immanuel
Kant Lectures in Philosophy prog
ram.
In the first of a four-part public lec
ture series, Chomsky clarified sev
eral of his theories, presented a
number of issues related to cognitive
structures and language, and con
tinued the discussion of several
philosophical problems. In addition,
he emphasized his belief in the in
nate acquisition of language.
Chomsky confined most of his re
marks to the cognitive domain of
human language. Introducing the
notion of human capacity for all ac
tions, Chomsky launched into a dis
cussion of cognitive functions that
take place in the brain which he cal
led mental structures and represen
tations. Partly through these struc
tures, Chomsky said humans are able
to learn language. "Language is rep
resented in our minds and ultimately
in our brains, represented in struc
tures that we hope to be able to
characterize abstractly."
Chomsky battled singlehandedly
against Putnam, Hume and other
philosophers who maintain a
philosophy of "what's correct today
won't be tomorrow" in human be
havior. Chomsky, on the other hand,
said that there are aspects of the
mind, specifically language, that
lend themselves to study by a scien
tific method such as the Galilean
model used in some aspects of the
natural sciences. By using a scientific
method of study, Chomsky said it is
possible to learn more about the ori
gins and the acquisition of language.
Turning to the linguistic con
troversy that helped make his name
famous, Chomsky repeated what he
said he originally thought "was an
innocent and uncontroversial state
ment."
"Linguistic theory is concerned
primarily with an ideal speaker
listener in a completely homogene
ous speech community who knows

its language perfectly and is unaf
fected by memory limitations, dis
tractions, and so on." And with his
humor that amused the audience
throughout his lecture, he added
"the formulation still seems to me
innocent but it is obviously far from
controversial."
Chomsky went on to say that there
is a distinction between two types of
environmental effects and while not
sharp, the distinction is crucial.
Chomsky identified these two types
of environmental effects as shaping
and triggering.
While shaping is almost exclu
sively the result of the environment,
genetic agents must interact with the
environment to produce the trigger
ing effect.
In language, there are many exam
ples where experience is not neces
sary for rules to develop, Chomsky
said. The process of forming ques
tions and the rule that allows people
to form reciprocal expressions are
two examples which demonstrate
that experience is not necessary, he
said.
Chomsky further argued that "the


Noam Chomsky
language faculty and other mental
organs develop in the individual
under the triggering effect of ap
propriate social interactions, and
partly shaped by the environment.
English is not Japanese, just as the
distribution of horizontal and verti
cal receptors in the visual cortex can
be modified by early visual experi
ence.
"Much of our knowledge reflects
our modes of cognition and is there
fore not limited to inductive generali
zation from experience, let alone any
training that we may have received,"
Chomsky said. "And just as the visual
system of the cat will never be that of
a bee or a frog, so the human mind
will develop one of the human lan
guages and narrow constraints will
be set."
Chomsky ended the lecture with
an emphasis on the limits on the en
terprise that he will be pursuing in
his next few lectures. "Two individu
als with the same genetic endow
ment and common experience will
attain the same state — specifically
the same state of knowledge.
"But this does not preclude the
possibility of diversity in the exer
cises in this knowledge and thought
in action," he said. The study of ac
quisition of knowledge or its in
terpretation of experience through
the use of acquired knowledge, still
leaves open the question of the cau
sation of behavior and more broadly
the question of our ability to choose
and decide what we will do, he said.

philosophy of "what's correct today
won't be tomorrow" in human be
havior. Chomsky, on the other hand,
said that there are aspects of the
mind, specifically language, that
lend themselves to study by a scien
tific method such as the Galilean
model used in some aspects of the
natural sciences. By using a scientific
method of study, Chomsky said it is
possible to learn more about the ori
gins and the acquisition of language.
Turning to the linguistic con
troversy that helped make his name
famous, Chomsky repeated what he
said he originally thought "was an
innocent and uncontroversial state
ment."
"Linguistic theory is concerned
primarily with an ideal speaker
listener in a completely homogene
ous speech community who knows

its language perfectly and is unaf
fected by memory limitations, dis
tractions, and so on." And with his
humor that amused the audience
throughout his lecture, he added
"the formulation still seems to me
innocent but it is obviously far from
controversial."
Chomsky went on to say that there
is a distinction between two types of
environmental effects and while not
sharp, the distinction is crucial.
Chomsky identified these two types
of environmental effects as shaping
and triggering.
While shaping is almost exclu
sively the result of the environment,
genetic agents must interact with the
environment to produce the trigger
ing effect.
In language, there are many exam
ples where experience is not neces
sary for rules to develop, Chomsky
said. The process of forming ques
tions and the rule that allows people
to form reciprocal expressions are
two examples which demonstrate
that experience is not necessary, he
said.
Chomsky further argued that "the


Noam Chomsky
language faculty and other mental
organs develop in the individual
under the triggering effect of ap
propriate social interactions, and
partly shaped by the environment.
English is not Japanese, just as the
distribution of horizontal and verti
cal receptors in the visual cortex can
be modified by early visual experi
ence.
"Much of our knowledge reflects
our modes of cognition and is there
fore not limited to inductive generali
zation from experience, let alone any
training that we may have received,"
Chomsky said. "And just as the visual
system of the cat will never be that of
a bee or a frog, so the human mind
will develop one of the human lan
guages and narrow constraints will
be set."
Chomsky ended the lecture with
an emphasis on the limits on the en
terprise that he will be pursuing in
his next few lectures. "Two individu
als with the same genetic endow
ment and common experience will
attain the same state — specifically
the same state of knowledge.
"But this does not preclude the
possibility of diversity in the exer
cises in this knowledge and thought
in action," he said. The study of ac
quisition of knowledge or its in
terpretation of experience through
the use of acquired knowledge, still
leaves open the question of the cau
sation of behavior and more broadly
the question of our ability to choose
and decide what we will do, he said.
Speaking before an overflow audi
ence of about 300, with people
crowding the aisles, and many others
turned away to their dismay at the
door, Prof. Noam Chomsky of Mas
sacusettts Institute of Technology
opened his two-week lecture stay
here last night.
The noted philosopher, linguist
and critic is visiting the University as
the lecturer for the 1979 Immanuel
Kant Lectures in Philosophy prog
ram.
In the first of a four-part public lec
ture series, Chomsky clarified sev
eral of his theories, presented a
number of issues related to cognitive
structures and language, and con
tinued the discussion of several
philosophical problems. In addition,
he emphasized his belief in the in
nate acquisition of language.
Chomsky confined most of his re
marks to the cognitive domain of
human language. Introducing the
notion of human capacity for all ac
tions, Chomsky launched into a dis
cussion of cognitive functions that
take place in the brain which he cal
led mental structures and represen
tations. Partly through these struc
tures, Chomsky said humans are able
to learn language. "Language is rep
resented in our minds and ultimately
in our brains, represented in struc
tures that we hope to be able to
characterize abstractly."
Chomsky battled singlehandedly
against Putnam, Hume and other
philosophers who maintain a
philosophy of "what's correct today
won't be tomorrow" in human be
havior. Chomsky, on the other hand,
said that there are aspects of the
mind, specifically language, that
lend themselves to study by a scien
tific method such as the Galilean
model used in some aspects of the
natural sciences. By using a scientific
