# Cheap, easy-to-operate mopeds gain in popularity, visibility here
## 
### LINDA HARDESTY 
Mopeds — pedalable, motorized bicy
cles — are gaining in popularity and visibil
ity here. A rumor several years ago,
mopeds have become quite prevalent re
cently and their numbers show no sign of
decreasing.
Police and University officials don't
know how many mopeds are now being
operated here. For registration purposes,
mopeds are classified as motorized cycles.
But Stanford Police Services doesn't keep
separate counts of motorized and non
motorized bicycle registrations. Accord
ing to Marvin Herrington, director of Stan
ford Police Services, approximately 100 to
200 mopeds are owned and operated here.
Herrington said mopeds are beginning
to cause problems. Mopeds are subject to
a mixed bag of state and local regulations.
While considered bicycles for registration
procedures, they are nof bicycles, accord
ing to the California Vehicle Code. Moped
riders are prohibited from using bicycle
paths while operating their vehicles with
motor power, unless the trail is part of the
street surface, or unless local authorities

have opened the paths to moped use.
Further, the University prohibits the op
eration of any gasoline-powered cycle
within 100 feet of a classroom or library
building or in any area closed to au
tomobiles.
"We haven't figured out any way to en
force these rules," said Herrington, "but
we're working on it." Herrington also
noted that while moped operators legally
may pedal their vehicles across White
Plaza, for example, they may not use
motor power to operate the vehicles. "I've
never seen one being pedaled yet,
though," he said.
Mopeds' safety record here is, so far,
unblemished. But an accident involving a
moped or complaints about them could
move the enforcement of moped laws up
from the back burner, according to Police
Services officers.
Hardy souls intent on owning a moped
can make the investment for less than $800
for a new set of wheels or $200 used. To
operate the machine with motor power,
one must have a valid driver's license,
though it need not be endorsed for

motorcycle operation. Sixty-five cents will
fill the gas tank and carry the rider at least
100 miles.
The low cost of operating a moped is
one of its major attractions for college stu
dents. A survey commissioned by Puch, a
leading moped manufacturer, found that
12 percent of the students who purchased
mopeds for use on university campuses,
did so as an alternative to buying or main
taining an automobile. Freshman moped
owner Steve Eisner says a moped "is a
good investment. I can ride for 2Vi weeks
on a fil I up." Eisner voiced no dissatisfac
tions with his one-year-old Vespa Brava,
and said it requires no major maintenance.
"A good dealer relationship is impor
tant," he advised. "Try to find one that will
be helpful when you take it in for mainte
nance and repairs."
Mopeds: they go anywhere a bike can
go, while not tiring the rider. They pollute
less than cars, according to environmen
talists and riders don't yet need moped
insurance. Moped owners agree, however
— the major reason for owning a moped is
that they're fun.
