# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Richard Wohl All facts not told 
### 
The historic speech is over. The television
cameras whirr to a stop. Unaware that a mic
rophone is still on, the President of the United
States leans back in his chair and revels in the
power that is his alone. "Massive applause
throughout the nation" he whispers smugly,
only half to himself.
This incident of self-infatuation is not fiction,
but fact, a disturbing addendum to President
Jimmy Carter's latest revelation about the
People's Republic of China. The rest of his talk
differed only in degree rather than tone: con
descending catch-phrases like "good for the
country" and "good for peace" glossed over
some rather substantial questions and conse
quential implications. His handling of the China
question seems to point to a shallowness of
thought and motive indicated by his ill-timed
revelry.
For the possibilities of the "China break
through," as it has come to be called, are not
only good. Like any high-risk investment, there
is great potential on both the up and down
sides. The alluring reward is balanced by real
dangers.
Politically, there can be little question that
normalization recognizes simple reality. In fact,
it is hard to believe that the U.S. could pretend
to ignore a nation of a billion people for so long.
Clearly, past policy was a moral facade for
weak-hearted leaders; it intensified mutual mis
trust and misunderstanding.
But it is not so clear why Taiwan was the politi
cal price for normalization. Obviously, Taiwan's
claim to be the only true representative of the
Chinese people is absurd. Yet her social and
economic system is very different from that of
the mainland. Hence the principle of national
self-determination, which these days gets self
righteous lip-service from almost everyone, ar
gues for Taiwan's sovereignty. In a world of two
Cermanies, two Koreas and two Yemens, our
eagerness to concur in a stubborn insistence
on one China is insensitive and hypocritical,
more so in light of our own past policy.
Strong economic reasons for normalization
have also been voiced. U.S. multinational cor
porations have long coveted such a giant mar
ket. China claims to be rich in oil. In an era of
both limitless trade deficits and chronic oil shor
tages, a president can be swayed by such logic.
Besides, China has in the last year concluded
a rapid series of large trade agreements with
Japan, Britain, France and Sweden. If there's
going to be a stampede, China might as well be
bullish on America, too. After all, the Chinese
might like Coke as well as they did opium.

But the rush to reap profit also raises serious
questions. Why has China, after thousands of
years of self-conscious isolation, so suddenly
opened her arms to the capitalist West? Are her
long-term interests really pro-Western? Can we
feel safe building a sophisticated industrial base
for a potentially hostile country whose human
resources so vastly exceed ours?
The strategic issue is less two-sided. For the
immediate future, Breshnev may spend some
sleepless nights. More Russian troops and a few
more squadrons of MIGs will be needed along
the Chinese border to offset China's acquisition
of British Harrier jets. The Soviets' chronic
paranoia in foreign affairs will probably in
crease. Whether this bodes well for the equally
paranoid U.S. is at best debatable.
And this is the best we can hope for strategi
cally. It is important to remember, despite the
recent, well-orchestrated series of democratic
sounding wall posters in Peking, that Chinese
individual and societal values are quite different
from our own, and that this difference runs far
deeper than the catch-words of communist and
capitalist ideology.
The dialectical nature of international politics
means constant fluctuation — when the existing
balance of power is changed or upset, upheaval
can be sharp. The same fluctuating process that
has momentarily brought us closer to China
could someday move us apart again. Indeed, as
China becomes stronger, and begins to assert
herself, it may be inevitable that our interests
conflict. The volatile leadership situation in the
Peoples' Republic today, characterized by the
epithet — "twice-purged" — of present ruler
Teng Hsio-p'ing, makes rude surprises even
more likely. "China?" said Napoleon
Bonaparte. "There lies a sleeping giant. Let him
sleep, for when he wakes the world will trem
ble."
Unfortunately, Jimmy Carter chose to tell us
none of these things. Perhaps he felt badly
about the way he'd lied to the press over the past
year, employing secret Kissinger-style diplo
macy in place of the openness he had once
pledged.
But even without such explanation, it is clear
that Carter chose expediency over morality.
Possibly he had little choice in this. Neverthe
less, he owed us a full review of the facts, and
some strong justifications as to why he chose
the course he did. Instead, he treated us with a
contempt as shallow as his "breakthrough."

years of self-conscious isolation, so suddenly
opened her arms to the capitalist West? Are her
long-term interests really pro-Western? Can we
feel safe building a sophisticated industrial base
for a potentially hostile country whose human
resources so vastly exceed ours?
The strategic issue is less two-sided. For the
immediate future, Breshnev may spend some
sleepless nights. More Russian troops and a few
more squadrons of MIGs will be needed along
the Chinese border to offset China's acquisition
of British Harrier jets. The Soviets' chronic
paranoia in foreign affairs will probably in
crease. Whether this bodes well for the equally
paranoid U.S. is at best debatable.
And this is the best we can hope for strategi
cally. It is important to remember, despite the
recent, well-orchestrated series of democratic
sounding wall posters in Peking, that Chinese
individual and societal values are quite different
from our own, and that this difference runs far
deeper than the catch-words of communist and
capitalist ideology.
The dialectical nature of international politics
means constant fluctuation — when the existing
balance of power is changed or upset, upheaval
can be sharp. The same fluctuating process that
has momentarily brought us closer to China
could someday move us apart again. Indeed, as
China becomes stronger, and begins to assert
herself, it may be inevitable that our interests
conflict. The volatile leadership situation in the
Peoples' Republic today, characterized by the
epithet — "twice-purged" — of present ruler
Teng Hsio-p'ing, makes rude surprises even
more likely. "China?" said Napoleon
Bonaparte. "There lies a sleeping giant. Let him
sleep, for when he wakes the world will trem
ble."
Unfortunately, Jimmy Carter chose to tell us
none of these things. Perhaps he felt badly
about the way he'd lied to the press over the past
year, employing secret Kissinger-style diplo
macy in place of the openness he had once
pledged.
But even without such explanation, it is clear
that Carter chose expediency over morality.
Possibly he had little choice in this. Neverthe
less, he owed us a full review of the facts, and
some strong justifications as to why he chose
the course he did. Instead, he treated us with a
contempt as shallow as his "breakthrough."

The historic speech is over. The television
cameras whirr to a stop. Unaware that a mic
rophone is still on, the President of the United
States leans back in his chair and revels in the
power that is his alone. "Massive applause
throughout the nation" he whispers smugly,
only half to himself.
This incident of self-infatuation is not fiction,
but fact, a disturbing addendum to President
Jimmy Carter's latest revelation about the
People's Republic of China. The rest of his talk
differed only in degree rather than tone: con
descending catch-phrases like "good for the
country" and "good for peace" glossed over
some rather substantial questions and conse
quential implications. His handling of the China
question seems to point to a shallowness of
thought and motive indicated by his ill-timed
revelry.
For the possibilities of the "China break
through," as it has come to be called, are not
only good. Like any high-risk investment, there
is great potential on both the up and down
sides. The alluring reward is balanced by real
dangers.
Politically, there can be little question that
normalization recognizes simple reality. In fact,
it is hard to believe that the U.S. could pretend
to ignore a nation of a billion people for so long.
Clearly, past policy was a moral facade for
weak-hearted leaders; it intensified mutual mis
trust and misunderstanding.
But it is not so clear why Taiwan was the politi
cal price for normalization. Obviously, Taiwan's
claim to be the only true representative of the
Chinese people is absurd. Yet her social and
economic system is very different from that of
the mainland. Hence the principle of national
self-determination, which these days gets self
righteous lip-service from almost everyone, ar
gues for Taiwan's sovereignty. In a world of two
Cermanies, two Koreas and two Yemens, our
eagerness to concur in a stubborn insistence
on one China is insensitive and hypocritical,
more so in light of our own past policy.
Strong economic reasons for normalization
have also been voiced. U.S. multinational cor
porations have long coveted such a giant mar
ket. China claims to be rich in oil. In an era of
both limitless trade deficits and chronic oil shor
tages, a president can be swayed by such logic.
Besides, China has in the last year concluded
a rapid series of large trade agreements with
Japan, Britain, France and Sweden. If there's
going to be a stampede, China might as well be
bullish on America, too. After all, the Chinese
might like Coke as well as they did opium.
