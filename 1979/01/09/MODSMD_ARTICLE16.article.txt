Stabbed in
the back
I was glad to note the Daily's
concern regarding bookstore
theft and it was good to see an
article which explored this
problem. However, in your ar
ticle you failed to mention one
type of bookstore theft that is
apparently very common. This
is the theft of the customer's
articles which we are "kindly"
requested to leave outside.
I was recently the victim of
such a theft and I find it rather
ironic that my cooperation
with the bookstore manage
ment (in an effort to reduce
shoplifting) resulted in my own
loss of personal belongings. It
is my opinion that this means
of theft is particularly back
stabbing and I am a bit sur
prised to find it here at Stan
ford.

A warm round of applause for
the wonderful folks at the Stan
ford Coif Course. Why?
They're ingenious, clever and
resourceful — that's why!
They've managed to turn a

facility intended for educa
tional use into a private coun
try club. What a belly laugh. No
wonder the county wanted to
tax 'em.
So, you ask, how did they ac
complish this amazing feat?
Basically, they've made it as dif
ficult as possible for students
to use the course, and as easy
as possible for members of the
faculty and the "Stanford Coif
Club" to use it.
You say you didn't even
know there was a Stanford Golf
Club. Well there is. And mem
bers of the old Club can make
reservations to play anytime
they like.
Students, however, are
strictly on a first-come, first
serve basis.
And what about weekends?
Well, on weekends ( and holi
days) students are not allowed
to use the course before 11
a.m. After 11, they do allow the
miserable clods to play on the
course — as long as they put
down newspapers wherever
they go.
I think this idea — this idea of
restricting people from using
facilities designed primarily for
them — is a good one. We
should find uses for it
elsewhere on campus.
Let's take the bookstore.
Let's establish a "Stanford

Bookstore Club" made up en
tirely of people who do not be
long to the student body. Then
we'll make up rules so that
members of the Club get first
priority for all the required
textbooks, even though
they're not in any of the clas
ses. We can even forbid stu
dents to come into the
Bookstore before 2 p.m. on
weekdays, the hours before 2
being the most popular, so that
everything will be analogous to
the Stanford Golf Course.
As you can see, it makes a
whole lot of sense.
