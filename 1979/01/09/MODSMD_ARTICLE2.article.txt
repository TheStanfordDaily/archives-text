# Accounting office to return ASSU funds
## Fee assessment mix-up rectified 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
After deducting nearly $4000 from
the fall quarter ASSU fee assess
ments fund to compensate for
money the University overpaid to the
fund last year, the general account
ing office has agreed to return this
money, according to Bob Phillips, a
supervisor in the general accounting
office.
ASSU Financial Manager Bill Lape
said the accounting office overpaid
$3735 to the fee assessments fund
over all three quarters last year. In an
effort to recover the losses that re
sulted from this overpayment, the
accounting office deducted $3700
from the fall quarter fee assessments
in November.
This deduction was an "adminis
trative error" by the general account
ing office, Lape said. "The money
should never have been deducted."
After the "error" was discovered.

the accounting office agreed to re
turn the money to the ASSU fee as
sessments fund when the winter
quarter assessments are sent in later
this year, according to Phillips.
In addition to transferring too
much money into the fee assess
ments fund, the general accounting
office also overpaid the row houses
$5000 for spring quarter house dues,
according to Lape.
In June, the University sent "late
fees" totaling $5000 to be included in
the house and dorm accounts, Lape
said. He said he distributed this
money to all the houses.
Then, prior to the end of spring
quarter, Lape said the residential
education office informed him that
the $5000 overpayment was a mis
take. He said he froze the accounts of
houses still in the black, but was only
able to recover about $2500.
Because it was impossible to
itemize where fee assessment

money was used, none of the over
paid fee assessment money was re
covered, Lape said.
When the $3700 was deducted
from last quarter's fee assessment
fund, Lape said he complained to the
Office of Residential Education.
Philip Curry, administrative assis
tant in the residential education of
fice, said he agreed that the deduc
tion was unfair. According to Lape, it
is unfair to penalize this year's stu
dents for a mistake made last year.
Lape explained that the University
collects funds for fee assessments
and house dues along with tuition
and room and board payments. Sev
eral months later, the ASSU receives
the money.
The amount ASSU receives de
pends on the number of students en
rolled, and since the ASSU has no
attendance figures at its disposal, it
takes whatever sum the University
sends, Lape said. The money is then
placed in the dorm and house ac
counts and sent to those groups re
ceiving fee assessments.
Transfer student fees
Last year, the transfer student fees
were erroneously included in the
sum sent to the ASSU as fee assess
ments. About $300 extra was in
cluded fall quarter, $500 winter, and
$3000 in the spring, according to
Lape.
Curry said that the transfer stu
dents whose funds were misdirected
will not lose any services because the
money that goes toward their orien
tation comes from a large reserve ac
count.
Curry said the issue with the house
dues is settled, because most ot the
money has been returned. He said
he is still trying to recover some of
the fee assessment money.
"It is reasonable to ask those
groups who received extra to refund
what they can," he said.
He added that the accounting
problem that caused the mistakes
has been corrected and that this fall
the allotment of money "ran
smoothly."
