## Poverty and social justice 
### 
(This is the conclusion of a two part col
umn on poverty.)
These unhappy times call for the
building of plans . . . that build from
the bottom up and not from the top
down, that put their faith once more
in the forgotten man at the bottom
of the economic pyramid.
— Franklin Roosevelt
It was in 1932 that President Roosevelt
called to the attention of the national pub
lic the problems of the poor. Though ob
viously not so severe and widespread as
during the Depression, over four and a
half decades later, many of the same
economic and social injustices remain
both at home and abroad. When 25 million
Americans live below the poverty level,
400 million people face starvation in the
world and perhaps two-thirds of the
earth's population is undernourished,
clearly, something must be done.
Any analysis seeking solutions to such
problems must begin domestically, forour
domestic poverty presents a microcosm of
poverty in the world economic order.
The starting point is to recognize our
social responsibility. The political
philosophy of Plato and Aristotle remind
us that we are born into society with a
social responsibility — each of us as mem
bers of the body politic with specific duties
and obligations toward one another. The
wisdom of literature reaffirms this belief —
ranging from Rousseau's Contrat Social to
John Donne's conviction that "no man is
an island." We live in a world of plenty
surrounded by want and need. Our social
responsibility requires action to correct
such disparities.
In addition, a second attitude change is
required. We must adopt a sense of com
munity. This sense of community was pre
sented by Olaf Palme in a lecture at Stan
ford a year ago: "To live and survive, a
society has to breath an air of solidarity
that embraces all its members, a power of
empathy, of caring for the lives of others, a
feeling of joint responsibility and partici
pation . . . Solidarity and justice are and
must be indivisible."
With this outlook, furthered by the rela
tive homogeneity of the Swedish popula
tion and their resulting sense of unity,
Sweden has been able to find cooperation
between government, business, trade un
ions and individuals in their common go
als. The result— low inflation with no un
employment, no poverty and a high stan
dard of living.
Clearly, in the United States this unity
will be more difficult to achieve. Aside
from the mere vastness of our boundaries
compared to so small a nation as Sweden,
we are, moreover, a nation torn apart by
racial, religious, ethnic, social and

economic differences. We lack the simple
homogeneity that serves to unify Sweden.
And yet we too share a common heritage
— we are a nation of immigrants whose
ancestors came to America fleeing
tyranny, seeking opportunity, individual
freedom and in a phrase — a better life.
We must simply recognize and accentuate
our common purpose. This requires edu
cation in a liberal sense, which requires
time.
And what about individual freedom —
would not these attitude changes strike
hard against our sacred rugged and
materialistic individualism — this itself
may be the most difficult attitude change
we must adopt if we are to face the prob
lems of poverty. Americans must come to
realize that social justice and individual
freedom are not opponents or contradic
tions, but are rather prerequisites and
complements of one another.
The domestic situation has revealed
some hope for the poor. The commit
ment started by Presidents John Ken
nedy and Lyndon Johnson to fight the
"war on poverty" and support civil rights
legislation has helped balance the in
equities of the nation and move us closer
to achieving economic justice. Despite the
fact that the major impact of the war on
poverty was denied in favor of expendi
tures on another, less-noble war, and al
though abandoned during the Nixon and
Ford years, such programs to assist the
poor await rekindling in the future.
However, lest we fall heir to the same
mistakes, we must recognize the
shortcomings of our earlier poverty prog
rams. First, objective must be clearly de
fined. Many of the '60s programs, such as
job rehabilitation and opportunity pro
jects, "failed" because there was no
method of defining or registering "suc
cess." For example, what percentage of
Job Core trainees must find and maintain
employment to constitute success for the
program? Such an issue was seldom ad
dressed in the '60s and the data rarely col
lected.
Second, our leaders in Washington
must realize that they cannot merely throw
money at a troubled area and hope to
solve the problem. Programs must be ca
tered to individual needs and people must
be dealt with as people, not mere num
bers. This requires imparting a "sense of
humanity" into the welfare system, and is
closely related to a third failure of poverty
programs.
This failure centers around the current
liberal dilemma. In thewakeof the Propos
ition 13, "get government off my back"
hysteria, the federal, state and local gov
ernments must show Americans that their
programs can work. Part of the answer is

for the federal government to realize that
itcannot simplydevelopafederal program
without adjusting to localized needs.
Federal oversight and funding are
necessary to ensure egalitarian concern
and equality for national programs, but
decentralized discretion in decision mak
ing and programs developed at local and
regional levels must also be permitted.
Once assistance programs are seen to
work at the local level, people will begin to
have renewed confidence in government.
In this light President Carter and the
federal government will have the mandate
and support necessary to start enacting
legislation which would ameliorate the
economic burdens of the poor at the na
tional level through tax benefits, income
redistribution (perhaps a negative income
tax), increased government-supported job
opportunity projects, a national health
care plan and similar programs.
Domestic improvement, however, will
be short-lived unless our economic and
political relationships with other nations
follow suit. Again, incremental changes
through legislation and reform can help
improve the situation of conflict — poor
vs. rich — in the international order.
The United States should make gradual
and yet significant concessions to such
Third World demands as commodity pric
ing agreements, development and
technology assistance, aid and loan ag
reements and the opening of markets in a
less asymmetrical manner. The U.S. must
rejuvenate, improve and increase spend
ing on such programs as the Peace Corps
and Food for Peace, as well as assisting
efforts for world food and monetary or
ganizations.
A proposal for domestic and interna
tional economic harmony is, granted,
highly idealistic and most likely will not be
fulfilled in the near future. However, the
United States sits at the fulcrum of world
order and with that position a concerted
national effort could turn the tide of
events and lead us in the direction of social
and economic justice.
Indeed, we may begin to adopt the
world community attituda necessary for
our own survival. This struggle against
poverty has a higher vision — that one day
we might all live in a world where our
common needs and aspirations unify us in
a general common purpose. For, as Presi
dent Kennedy stated,
In the finai analysis, our most basic
common link is that we all inhabit
this small planet. We all breath the
same air. We all cherish our chil
dren's future. And we are all mortal.

freedom and in a phrase — a better life.
We must simply recognize and accentuate
our common purpose. This requires edu
cation in a liberal sense, which requires
time.
And what about individual freedom —
would not these attitude changes strike
hard against our sacred rugged and
materialistic individualism — this itself
may be the most difficult attitude change
we must adopt if we are to face the prob
lems of poverty. Americans must come to
realize that social justice and individual
freedom are not opponents or contradic
tions, but are rather prerequisites and
complements of one another.
The domestic situation has revealed
some hope for the poor. The commit
ment started by Presidents John Ken
nedy and Lyndon Johnson to fight the
"war on poverty" and support civil rights
legislation has helped balance the in
equities of the nation and move us closer
to achieving economic justice. Despite the
fact that the major impact of the war on
poverty was denied in favor of expendi
tures on another, less-noble war, and al
though abandoned during the Nixon and
Ford years, such programs to assist the
poor await rekindling in the future.
However, lest we fall heir to the same
mistakes, we must recognize the
shortcomings of our earlier poverty prog
rams. First, objective must be clearly de
fined. Many of the '60s programs, such as
job rehabilitation and opportunity pro
jects, "failed" because there was no
method of defining or registering "suc
cess." For example, what percentage of
Job Core trainees must find and maintain
employment to constitute success for the
program? Such an issue was seldom ad
dressed in the '60s and the data rarely col
lected.
Second, our leaders in Washington
must realize that they cannot merely throw
money at a troubled area and hope to
solve the problem. Programs must be ca
tered to individual needs and people must
be dealt with as people, not mere num
bers. This requires imparting a "sense of
humanity" into the welfare system, and is
closely related to a third failure of poverty
programs.
This failure centers around the current
liberal dilemma. In thewakeof the Propos
ition 13, "get government off my back"
hysteria, the federal, state and local gov
ernments must show Americans that their
programs can work. Part of the answer is

for the federal government to realize that
itcannot simplydevelopafederal program
without adjusting to localized needs.
Federal oversight and funding are
necessary to ensure egalitarian concern
and equality for national programs, but
decentralized discretion in decision mak
ing and programs developed at local and
regional levels must also be permitted.
Once assistance programs are seen to
work at the local level, people will begin to
have renewed confidence in government.
In this light President Carter and the
federal government will have the mandate
and support necessary to start enacting
legislation which would ameliorate the
economic burdens of the poor at the na
tional level through tax benefits, income
redistribution (perhaps a negative income
tax), increased government-supported job
opportunity projects, a national health
care plan and similar programs.
Domestic improvement, however, will
be short-lived unless our economic and
political relationships with other nations
follow suit. Again, incremental changes
through legislation and reform can help
improve the situation of conflict — poor
vs. rich — in the international order.
The United States should make gradual
and yet significant concessions to such
Third World demands as commodity pric
ing agreements, development and
technology assistance, aid and loan ag
reements and the opening of markets in a
less asymmetrical manner. The U.S. must
rejuvenate, improve and increase spend
ing on such programs as the Peace Corps
and Food for Peace, as well as assisting
efforts for world food and monetary or
ganizations.
A proposal for domestic and interna
tional economic harmony is, granted,
highly idealistic and most likely will not be
fulfilled in the near future. However, the
United States sits at the fulcrum of world
order and with that position a concerted
national effort could turn the tide of
events and lead us in the direction of social
and economic justice.
Indeed, we may begin to adopt the
world community attituda necessary for
our own survival. This struggle against
poverty has a higher vision — that one day
we might all live in a world where our
common needs and aspirations unify us in
a general common purpose. For, as Presi
dent Kennedy stated,
In the finai analysis, our most basic
common link is that we all inhabit
this small planet. We all breath the
same air. We all cherish our chil
dren's future. And we are all mortal.

ence. His column appears bi-weekly.)

(This is the conclusion of a two part col
umn on poverty.)
These unhappy times call for the
building of plans . . . that build from
the bottom up and not from the top
down, that put their faith once more
in the forgotten man at the bottom
of the economic pyramid.
— Franklin Roosevelt
It was in 1932 that President Roosevelt
called to the attention of the national pub
lic the problems of the poor. Though ob
viously not so severe and widespread as
during the Depression, over four and a
half decades later, many of the same
economic and social injustices remain
both at home and abroad. When 25 million
Americans live below the poverty level,
400 million people face starvation in the
world and perhaps two-thirds of the
earth's population is undernourished,
clearly, something must be done.
Any analysis seeking solutions to such
problems must begin domestically, forour
domestic poverty presents a microcosm of
poverty in the world economic order.
The starting point is to recognize our
social responsibility. The political
philosophy of Plato and Aristotle remind
us that we are born into society with a
social responsibility — each of us as mem
bers of the body politic with specific duties
and obligations toward one another. The
wisdom of literature reaffirms this belief —
ranging from Rousseau's Contrat Social to
John Donne's conviction that "no man is
an island." We live in a world of plenty
surrounded by want and need. Our social
responsibility requires action to correct
such disparities.
In addition, a second attitude change is
required. We must adopt a sense of com
munity. This sense of community was pre
sented by Olaf Palme in a lecture at Stan
ford a year ago: "To live and survive, a
society has to breath an air of solidarity
that embraces all its members, a power of
empathy, of caring for the lives of others, a
feeling of joint responsibility and partici
pation . . . Solidarity and justice are and
must be indivisible."
With this outlook, furthered by the rela
tive homogeneity of the Swedish popula
tion and their resulting sense of unity,
Sweden has been able to find cooperation
between government, business, trade un
ions and individuals in their common go
als. The result— low inflation with no un
employment, no poverty and a high stan
dard of living.
Clearly, in the United States this unity
will be more difficult to achieve. Aside
from the mere vastness of our boundaries
compared to so small a nation as Sweden,
we are, moreover, a nation torn apart by
racial, religious, ethnic, social and

economic differences. We lack the simple
homogeneity that serves to unify Sweden.
And yet we too share a common heritage
— we are a nation of immigrants whose
ancestors came to America fleeing
tyranny, seeking opportunity, individual
freedom and in a phrase — a better life.
We must simply recognize and accentuate
our common purpose. This requires edu

legislation which would ameliorate the
economic burdens of the poor at the na
tional level through tax benefits, income
redistribution (perhaps a negative income
tax), increased government-supported job
opportunity projects, a national health
care plan and similar programs.
Domestic improvement, however, will
be short-lived unless our economic and
political relationships with other nations
follow suit. Again, incremental changes
through legislation and reform can help
improve the situation of conflict — poor
vs. rich — in the international order.
The United States should make gradual
and yet significant concessions to such
Third World demands as commodity pric
ing agreements, development and
technology assistance, aid and loan ag
reements and the opening of markets in a
less asymmetrical manner. The U.S. must
rejuvenate, improve and increase spend
ing on such programs as the Peace Corps
and Food for Peace, as well as assisting
efforts for world food and monetary or
ganizations.
A proposal for domestic and interna
tional economic harmony is, granted,
highly idealistic and most likely will not be
fulfilled in the near future. However, the
United States sits at the fulcrum of world
order and with that position a concerted
national effort could turn the tide of
events and lead us in the direction of social
and economic justice.
Indeed, we may begin to adopt the
world community attituda necessary for
our own survival. This struggle against
poverty has a higher vision — that one day
we might all live in a world where our
common needs and aspirations unify us in
a general common purpose. For, as Presi
dent Kennedy stated,
In the finai analysis, our most basic
common link is that we all inhabit
this small planet. We all breath the
same air. We all cherish our chil
dren's future. And we are all mortal.
