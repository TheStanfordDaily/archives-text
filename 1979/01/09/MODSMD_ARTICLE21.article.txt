## Trials and tribulations of the long flight home 
### 
I don't know why I did it again. I really should have
known. I got so carried away with being back at
school that I totally forgot to make my Christmas
plane reservations until November. This meant that I
had the thrill of experiencing another Stanford char
ter to D.C.
Now the charters are a wonderful service. It's just
that they make each negative aspect of flying about 27
per cent worse. Sort of like the difference between
real rood and McDonald's.
It's not as if it's any easier to take a charter. In fact,
those diabolical schemers across the ASSU desk must
have taken a crash course from Freddie Laker. The
contract is written in that verbal befuddlement best
found in the prose of Courses and Degrees.
First, you're supposed to sign up a month in ad
vance, and put down an unrefundable deposit. You
have to present a student I.D. — that beaten-up piece
of white paper that's never exactly where you thought
you put it last. But the hardest part of this whole
process is that at the end of the quarter, right when
you need to pick up your ticket, you find that the
ASSU office is only open during your three finals.
But the real fun begins the day you fly. Charters
leave anywhere from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. You
inevitably miss a night of sleep. And you're inevitably
met at your destination by assorted cranky members
of your beloved family. 3:30 a.m. is no time to shine in
anybody's book.
It takes a good 10 minutes on the plane for the
novelty of flying to wear off. You find out that the
channels on the earphones run the musical gamut
from Henry Mancini to Charlie Pride. The guy next to
you listens to five hours of Top 40 with the earphones
sitting in his lap.
The stewardesses bounce up and down the aisle

demonstrating oxygen masks in a performance which
could rival Carol Merrill next to Door Number Three.
A quick check proves that there are no less than 46
people closer than you to the emergency exit.
As things settle down there's time to notice your
fellow passengers. The guy on your right, the typical
young pseudo-exec, is reading a Playboy discreetly
tucked into his open briefcase. The guy two seats
over is discreetly reading over his shoulder. So much
for casual conversation with that pair.

The greatest part of the trip is
figuring out the meal schedule.
What do you feed people on a
5-hour trip which leaves at 1 a.m.
Pacific and arrives at 9 a.m. Eastern
Standard Time. Obviously this
problem has stumped the best
minds of the airline industry.

The guy one seat up is beginning to get rambuncti
ous. On his third trip back from the can he announ
ced to all within earshot that he has consumed 2bVi
ounces of alcohol so far. Don't think he really needed
to announce it, though. Next thing you notice he's
taking apart his collapsible food tray and giving
pieces to each of his neighbors. What a fun guy.
The greatest part of the trip is figuring out the meal
schedule. What do you feed people on a five-hour
trip which leaves at 1 a.m. Pacific and arrives at 9 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time? Obviously this problem has

stumped the finest minds of the airline industry. On
one trip we were served a "snack," "dinner," drinks,
and "breakfast." Another time we had drinks, "din
ner " and "brunch." And once we had nothing.
The meals are a true highlight of the trip. The
stewardesses whip out little styrofoam trays with plas
tic silverware, each item encased in cellophane. A
true ecologist's nightmare. The food itself makes
Food Service look like a four-star restaurant. Mystery
meat, miniscule salads and synthetic potatoes are
standard.
The beverage cart always appears 30 minutes on
either side of your meal. I'm pretty sure they put the
rookie stewardesses in charge of this enterprise. In
any case, a request for anything beyond Coke or milk
usually results in a major inter-stewardess skirmish in
the back.
The final diversion of the flight is the movie. But
serious obstacles prevent enjoying even this. First,
you didn't realize you had to pay $2.50. Even your
Ultrabrite smile won't convince the stewardess to
give you free earphones. Second, even if you do pay,
you fall asleep by the time it's shown. Third, even if
you are awake, you have a window seat and there's no
way you can contort your body into a convenient
viewing position.
The best way to survive an air flight of any distance
is to work yourself into a state of semi-consciousness
before boarding, so that you can sleep through a
good part of the trip. Finals will usually help in the
preparation. If the whole ordeal still seems too horri
ble, maybe Christmas in Palo Alto wouldn't be such a
bad idea, after all. And that $241 would be in your
pocket, not in the friendly skies.

novelty of flying to wear off. You find out that the
channels on the earphones run the musical gamut
from Henry Mancini to Charlie Pride. The guy next to
you listens to five hours of Top 40 with the earphones
sitting in his lap.
The stewardesses bounce up and down the aisle

demonstrating oxygen masks in a performance which
could rival Carol Merrill next to Door Number Three.
A quick check proves that there are no less than 46
people closer than you to the emergency exit.
As things settle down there's time to notice your
fellow passengers. The guy on your right, the typical
young pseudo-exec, is reading a Playboy discreetly
tucked into his open briefcase. The guy two seats
over is discreetly reading over his shoulder. So much
for casual conversation with that pair.

The greatest part of the trip is
figuring out the meal schedule.
What do you feed people on a
5-hour trip which leaves at 1 a.m.
Pacific and arrives at 9 a.m. Eastern
Standard Time. Obviously this
problem has stumped the best
minds of the airline industry.

The guy one seat up is beginning to get rambuncti
ous. On his third trip back from the can he announ
ced to all within earshot that he has consumed 2bVi
ounces of alcohol so far. Don't think he really needed
to announce it, though. Next thing you notice he's
taking apart his collapsible food tray and giving
pieces to each of his neighbors. What a fun guy.
The greatest part of the trip is figuring out the meal
schedule. What do you feed people on a five-hour
trip which leaves at 1 a.m. Pacific and arrives at 9 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time? Obviously this problem has

stumped the finest minds of the airline industry. On
one trip we were served a "snack," "dinner," drinks,
and "breakfast." Another time we had drinks, "din
ner " and "brunch." And once we had nothing.
The meals are a true highlight of the trip. The
stewardesses whip out little styrofoam trays with plas
tic silverware, each item encased in cellophane. A
true ecologist's nightmare. The food itself makes
Food Service look like a four-star restaurant. Mystery
meat, miniscule salads and synthetic potatoes are
standard.
The beverage cart always appears 30 minutes on
either side of your meal. I'm pretty sure they put the
rookie stewardesses in charge of this enterprise. In
any case, a request for anything beyond Coke or milk
usually results in a major inter-stewardess skirmish in
the back.
The final diversion of the flight is the movie. But
serious obstacles prevent enjoying even this. First,
you didn't realize you had to pay $2.50. Even your
Ultrabrite smile won't convince the stewardess to
give you free earphones. Second, even if you do pay,
you fall asleep by the time it's shown. Third, even if
you are awake, you have a window seat and there's no
way you can contort your body into a convenient
viewing position.
The best way to survive an air flight of any distance
is to work yourself into a state of semi-consciousness
before boarding, so that you can sleep through a
good part of the trip. Finals will usually help in the
preparation. If the whole ordeal still seems too horri
ble, maybe Christmas in Palo Alto wouldn't be such a
bad idea, after all. And that $241 would be in your
pocket, not in the friendly skies.

I don't know why I did it again. I really should have
known. I got so carried away with being back at
school that I totally forgot to make my Christmas
plane reservations until November. This meant that I
had the thrill of experiencing another Stanford char
ter to D.C.
Now the charters are a wonderful service. It's just
that they make each negative aspect of flying about 27
per cent worse. Sort of like the difference between
real rood and McDonald's.
It's not as if it's any easier to take a charter. In fact,
those diabolical schemers across the ASSU desk must
have taken a crash course from Freddie Laker. The
contract is written in that verbal befuddlement best
found in the prose of Courses and Degrees.
First, you're supposed to sign up a month in ad
vance, and put down an unrefundable deposit. You
have to present a student I.D. — that beaten-up piece
of white paper that's never exactly where you thought
you put it last. But the hardest part of this whole
process is that at the end of the quarter, right when
you need to pick up your ticket, you find that the
ASSU office is only open during your three finals.
But the real fun begins the day you fly. Charters
leave anywhere from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. You
inevitably miss a night of sleep. And you're inevitably
met at your destination by assorted cranky members
of your beloved family. 3:30 a.m. is no time to shine in
anybody's book.
