## Pod paranoia 
### 
It's clear that something
sinister is in the air when we
see a woman wake up to
find that her chronically
sloppy boyfriend now looks
like an escapee from an
Arrow shirt ad. She realizes
that the man she went to
bed with isn't the same one
she woke up with, but how
does one convince others of
such an occurrence without
appearing either promiscu
ous or insane?
Paranoia, pure and sim
ple, makes United Artists'
Invasion of the Body
Snatchers the creepiest
movie of the year. We all
know the feeling that grabs
us when we think we're sur
rounded by antagonists. But
in lOTBS this fear becomes
a reality where friends and
lovers can be changed in a
matter of minutes into
clean-cut aliens intent only
on finding a way to repro

duce their own kind.
We're used to those
grade-Z science fiction films
where the aliens invade in a
paty-looking armada of
metal ships. One of IOTBS's
neatest tricks is having its
aliens invade in the form of
spores which drift through
space until they find a hos- 1
pitable environment. After
they land in the favorable
clime of San Francisco, the
spores grow into flower-like
objects people steal with as
much pleasure as any other
bloom pilfered from the
park. As it turns out, these
flowers are no pansies: they
have a singularly nasty habit
of duplicating intended vic
tims and then taking over
their personalities and lifes
tyles.
Phil Kaufman directed
this thriller and gave it great
pacing and style. But much
of the credit for the film's

wit must come from W.D.
Richter's screenplay, which
is based on the novel by Jack
Finney and the 1956 film. Di
rector and screenwriter
have worked together to •
add a surprising liveliness to
what might have been a
pretty heavy little movie.
lOTBS balances its horror
show with a healthy propor
tion of humor, and much of
the film's greatness comes
from the tension between
the two. The people who
areduplicated, forexample,
become a sort of Madison
Avenue ideal of a well
balanced human being; it is
both terrible and terribly
funny to watch all of human
ity reduced to the manic in
tensity of a Buick commer
cial.
Casting coup
A minor casting coup was
made by having Leonard
Nimoy play Dr. Kibner, a
pop psychiatrist who moon
lights as a missionary for the
aliens. It's not that Nimoy's
acting skills are that great;
he's really rather stodgy,
which, in this movie, fits his
character perfectly. But
Nimoy, as an individual,
captures the image of a per
sonality which was created
by forces beyond his con
trol — just look at his endur
ing fame from his role in the
long-defunct Star Trek tele-

vision series. His acting has
almost always tended to
ward caricature, and here,
as an alien caricature of a
human being, the effect is
phenomenal.
Donald Sutherland, who,
for a while, seemed to be a
Hollywood expatriate as he
devoted himself to Euro
pean productions 1900 and
Fellini's Casanova, is back in
the States in great form as
the San Francisco health in
spector who suddenly finds
himself looking for more
than flies and rodent hairs.
Brooke Adams, who was
fine in Days of Heaven (still
to be released in the Bay
Area) does equally well with
her part as the woman who,
after seeing her lover
turned into a malevolent
vegetable, begins to sus
pect that the creatures are
all around her.
Even the music in Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers
has been synthesized, and
the electronic score com
bined with a brilliant use of
Dolby stereo adds im
measurably to the film.
Such bravura technical ef
fects combined with a '70s
distrust of large organiza
tions combine to create
what can only be described
as a new genre: post-
Watergate gothic.

of the credit for the film's

wit must come from W.D.
Richter's screenplay, which
is based on the novel by Jack
Finney and the 1956 film. Di
rector and screenwriter
have worked together to •
add a surprising liveliness to
what might have been a
pretty heavy little movie.
lOTBS balances its horror
show with a healthy propor
tion of humor, and much of
the film's greatness comes
from the tension between
the two. The people who
areduplicated, forexample,
become a sort of Madison
Avenue ideal of a well
balanced human being; it is
both terrible and terribly
funny to watch all of human
ity reduced to the manic in
tensity of a Buick commer
cial.
Casting coup
A minor casting coup was
made by having Leonard
Nimoy play Dr. Kibner, a
pop psychiatrist who moon
lights as a missionary for the
aliens. It's not that Nimoy's
acting skills are that great;
he's really rather stodgy,
which, in this movie, fits his
character perfectly. But
Nimoy, as an individual,
captures the image of a per
sonality which was created
by forces beyond his con
trol — just look at his endur
ing fame from his role in the
long-defunct Star Trek tele-

vision series. His acting has
almost always tended to
ward caricature, and here,
as an alien caricature of a
human being, the effect is
phenomenal.
Donald Sutherland, who,
for a while, seemed to be a
Hollywood expatriate as he
devoted himself to Euro
pean productions 1900 and
Fellini's Casanova, is back in
the States in great form as
the San Francisco health in
spector who suddenly finds
himself looking for more
than flies and rodent hairs.
Brooke Adams, who was
fine in Days of Heaven (still
to be released in the Bay
Area) does equally well with
her part as the woman who,
after seeing her lover
turned into a malevolent
vegetable, begins to sus
pect that the creatures are
all around her.
Even the music in Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers
has been synthesized, and
the electronic score com
bined with a brilliant use of
Dolby stereo adds im
measurably to the film.
Such bravura technical ef
fects combined with a '70s
distrust of large organiza
tions combine to create
what can only be described
as a new genre: post-
Watergate gothic.

It's clear that something
sinister is in the air when we
see a woman wake up to
find that her chronically
sloppy boyfriend now looks
like an escapee from an
Arrow shirt ad. She realizes
that the man she went to
bed with isn't the same one
she woke up with, but how
does one convince others of
such an occurrence without
appearing either promiscu
ous or insane?
Paranoia, pure and sim
ple, makes United Artists'
Invasion of the Body
Snatchers the creepiest
movie of the year. We all
know the feeling that grabs
us when we think we're sur
rounded by antagonists. But
in lOTBS this fear becomes
a reality where friends and
lovers can be changed in a
matter of minutes into
clean-cut aliens intent only
on finding a way to repro

duce their own kind.
We're used to those
grade-Z science fiction films
where the aliens invade in a
paty-looking armada of
metal ships. One of IOTBS's
neatest tricks is having its
aliens invade in the form of
spores which drift through
space until they find a hos- 1
pitable environment. After
they land in the favorable
clime of San Francisco, the
spores grow into flower-like
objects people steal with as
much pleasure as any other
bloom pilfered from the
park. As it turns out, these
flowers are no pansies: they
have a singularly nasty habit
of duplicating intended vic
tims and then taking over
their personalities and lifes
tyles.
