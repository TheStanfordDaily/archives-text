## theater/karen wada 'Dracula' deliciously designed 
### 
Dracula is an optical illusion. What you see
isn't what you get. It's deliciously designed and
staged, but there's nothing at the heart of it all
except, perhaps, a spotty treatment of the famil
iar plot.
That might seem unimportant to a self
admitted "fang-in-cheek" production, but its
designer forces Dracula to aim for higher stan
dards.
Edward Gorey's sets dominate the show. They
are studies in black and white with drops of red,
etchings a little like Goya or Escher, but wholly
the work of this artist-author, known for mis
chievously macabre illustrations.
Each of the sets in Gorey's bat-happy world
demands more than a few second looks. Intri
cate, eerie, often whimsical — they're intellec
tual as well as artistic games.
Because of them, you expect cleverness in the
script. There isn't any. Hamilton Deane and
John Balderston's adaptation of Bram Stoker's
novel unearths every Transylvania joke known
and invents a few that should be forgotten.
There are some delightful vamp-camp bits,
especially for Jeremy Brett, the British actorwho
plays the ominous Count. Brett gets a lot of
mileage out of twisting Dracula cliches, from his
"Good EEEEvening" opening to his stake-in
heart deathbed scene. He's superb when it's
time for business, whirling that opera cape,
glowering hungrily, then sinking teeth into
flesh. He suffers only when, at someone's bid
ding, he tries to play the cult hero. His attempts
at sensuality sometimes seem ludicrous.
As Dracula's adversary, Van Helsing, David
Hurst is a winning blend of Dutch uncle and
Dutch oven. He's stern, stocky and warm inside,

carrying the show through the most weak
kneed scenes.
John Long gets the juicy role of Renfield, the
fly-eating zany, and he mops the floor in the best
and worst of acting traditions — which is exactly
right.
The others play their spoofed-up roles well,
but the servants lose their lines in their British
accents.
Director Dennis Rosa tries to ease the strain
by staging Dracula like a silent movie: full of
exaggerated sighs, melodramatic pauses and
visual effects. He should have gone further,
canningthe dialogueformusicand thought bal
loons.
Instead of camping up to excess, Rosa works
for understatement. Toothmarks on the neck
are dismissed as "another accident with a safety
pin" and fits of evil possession are tossed aside
as mere indigestion. When Van Helsing meets
one of Dracula's victims, so bloodlessly white
she'd make an albino look tanned, he greets her
with the solicitous, "Well, my dear, you look
very well — a little pale, perhaps."
If such humor misses your mark, Dracula isn't
your kind of show. It won't be funny and it
definitely isn't scary. The special effects are ef
fective but you expect more. Vou have to — with
those sets.
That hint of disappointment over what
could-have-been haunts the show.
But for those who don't care about such stuff,
and especially for the groupies in the emerging
Vampire Fan Club (they sell T-shirts in the
lobby), Dracula's still got a lot of bite in it.
(Dracula plays at the Curran Theatre, San Fran
cisco, through Feb. 3.)
