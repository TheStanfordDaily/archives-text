## Taylor trio thrills crowd 
### 
The Lively Arts' choice of
Billy Taylor seemed at first to
be a courageous one. He has
an impeccable reputation
among jazz musicians and cri
tics, but remains largely un
known by jazz fans. He tours
only infrequently and has re
leased, to the best of my know
ledge, no records during the
past several years.
These drawbacks were com
pletely forgotten once the
concert began. Taylor and his
cohorts, Victor Gaskin and
Freddie Waits,, thrilled a near
capacity crowd at Dinkelspiel
with a demonstration of acous
tic jazz at its finest. This was
perhaps the best jazz concert
presented at Stanford during
the past three years.
Early in his career Taylor
studied under the master
pianist Art Tatum, and the ef
fect it had on his playing is still
evident. His touch was crystal
clear (aided by a fantastic Bor
sendorfer piano) and his oc
taves and scales were fast and
clean. His playing is reminis
cent of Oscar Peterson's, but
more harmonically complex.

Peterson often sacrifices har
monic ingenuity in order to
create a greater feeling of
swing. Taylor looks for a more
integrated balance.
The program was made up
completely of originals, except
foran Ellington medley, and an
unannounced encore of Char
lie Parker's tune "Confirma
tion." The Ellington medley
was a real gem â€” the trio went
through about 15 Ellington
tunes which were full of in
teresting twists and turns. A
gorgeous rendition of "Lush
Life" led into a slow stride ver
sion of "A Train" which
emerged eventually as "Per
dido." Along the way Taylor
made passing references to
"All Too Soon," "In a Senti
mental Mood, " "Prelude to a
Kiss," "Do Nothing 'Till You
Hear From Me," and "Don't
Get Around Much Any More,"
as well as about a dozen
others.
The medley was brightened
by Taylor's frequent key
changes. His music is rich in
modulations, although he ap
pears to have a particular liking

for the key of A flat. At one
point Taylor took a break in
"Satin Doll" which brought the
song down to the sub
dominant during the course of
three seconds.
Taylor's drummer Freddie
Waits did a fantastic job of
supporting the musical pro
ceedings, although his fea
tured solo number was al
together too long. His playing
was at its best when it tried to
show off his ingenuity rather
than his virtuosity.
Bassist Victor Gaskin did a
commendable job as well. His
solos were really striking, and
at one point he engaged in
some interesting call-and
response antics with Taylor.
His speed and precision, like
Taylor's, cannot be faulted.
Perhaps even more reward
ing than the concert was the
fact that the Taylor trio spent
much of the week giving clinics
and demonstrations through
out the Peninsula. Lively Arts is
to be congratulated for bring
ing another fantastic act to
Stanford.
