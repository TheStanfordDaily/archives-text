# Convicted bomber selected financial leader of local church

### LEAH HALPER 
This summer, Michael
Poulin will become the Univer
sity Lutheran Church's (ULC)
financial director.
It is no ordinary job.
It is no ordinary church.
Poulin is no ordinary guy. In
fact, his story p r»•!lels his ex
traordinary personality, and
when he moves from Folsom
Prison in Folsom, Calif, to Palo
Alto, he will be faced with the
task of paying off the church's
large $189,000 mortage. He will
also find himself the center of
attention in the church com
munity, since he has become a
symbolic political cause for
ULC's vibrant pastor, Manfred
Bahmann, and most of ULC's
congregation.
Poulin's story began eight
years ago last fall. He was dat
ing a Bay Area woman who
broke up with him several
weeks before Christmas in
1970. Poulin, 29 years old and
then suffering from what his
lawyer, Doren Weinberg, calls
"extreme stress," hid a bomb
inside a paper bag and drop
ped the bag at his girlfriend's
house. The bag was opened by
the woman's stepfather,
whose vision and hearing were
partially impaired by the
bomb's detonation. Poulin was
convicted of exploding a de
structive device to cause bodily
injury. "Let's assume he did
it,"says Weinberg, who adds
that the charges arose from a
1969 law which bars establish
ing defense with a "diminished
capacity" or mental stress ar
gument. The law, passed in

what Weinberg terms "reac
tionary panic" to punish stu
dent activists and terrorists,
was protested early in the pro
ceedings by Poulin's friends,
who thought it was being mis
applied.
"Michael was caught in a
web not meant for him," says
Weinberg. "Of all the possible
charges against him, all butthis
one have short prison terms.
Only this one carries life im
prisonment. And the district at
torney chose to charge him
under the only California law
where you can charge some
one without the defense of
mental stress."
The bombing was Poulin's
first offense and Weinberg ar
gued that Poulin "wasn't func
tioning intelligently or ration
ally, as several psychiatric tests
taken at the time show."
With support from Bay Area
activists, Poulin found himself
before the state Supreme
Court, arguing that he had
been charged unfairly, and
under the wrong law. "It was a
sufficiently moral and
humanisticquestion to interest
many groups,'' Weinberg says.
"After we explained the cir
cumstances, they mostly ag
reed that he wasn't legally re
sponsible for his acts."
The high court disagreed,
however. The court disre
garded the argument that that
the law was aimed at deterring
underground organizations
from bombing crowded public
places. In early 1971, Poulin
was locked into the California
Men's Colony at San Luis

Obispo, Calif. A combination
of illness and his outraged pro
tests at guards who riffled
through his cell and posses
sions sent Poulin to high-risk
Folsom prison where he has
been held since.
But in 1975, Poulin's life took
a new turn as he began corres
ponding with others who
shared his political beliefs, in-

eluding members of ULC.
"Michael, being in Folsom,
listened to a broadcast by a
woman who is allied with us (at
ULC)," Pastor Bahmann re
calls. "She corresponded with
Michael and became in
terested in him as a person —
just someone who eight years
ago had gone bonkers and re
habilitated himself marvel
ously."
But prison officials have
been less than impressed with
his behavior, says Bahmann,
because Poulin protests the
treatment of inmates at Fol
som. "He had, shall we say,

run-ins with prison authorities.
He stood on the principle that
he wanted to be treated
equal."
As Poulin grew more politi
cally aware, he began acting
out his beliefs. Poulin's actions
impressed Bahmann. "We re
spected the courage with
which he stood his ground on
basic human rights and dig
nity."
Last year, when Poulin be
came eligible for parole, a
number of organizations, in
cluding Amnesty International
and the International Fellow
ship of Reconciliation also
began to respect Poulin's iron
ethics. He twice declined to
beg for release from the parole
board.
"He absolutely refused to
participate in the process or
accept parole because the
concept of it is degrading,"
explains Weinberg. "After
prisoners serve their sentences
they have to demonstrate their
further allegiance. Hefeels this
is a degradation of the spirit
unnecessary to rehabilitation.
Also, parole bothers him be
cause it's like holding a string
on people you let back into the
street. Whatever anyone
thinks, even if you believe in
harsh punishment, there is no
justification for additional
punishment outside jail.
Michael wanted to challenge
the very system itself."
Bahmann says Poulin's de
fense of the rights of prisoners
as people "is the main charac
teristic that has drawn us to
him. A very common reaction

to the naked, hungry, misera
ble, sick people is Ohmygod
wheredolstart? So many are in
paralysis, a guilt complex."
Poulin is not afraid to act "for
himself or others," Bahmann
reflects.
"No one loves freedom
more than I, and yet freedom
won by begging is no freedom
at all — and I will have none of
it," Poulin wrote in a public
statement a year ago. He might
still be at Folsom years from
now, Weinberg says, but for
changes in California's parole
procedures under the 1977 in
determinate sentencing law.
Rather than getting automa
tic parole at a predetermined
date, prisoners are now called
before parole boards after part
of their sentences have
elapsed. Parole eligibility is de
termined for each case.
"Michael wanted to stay in
until he was past his parole
date, so he would at some his
torical moment be serving time
not because of his original
crime, but because of his op
position to parole," Weinberg
explains. "But things changed
with the new law, and so many
people were begging him not
to stay in and ruin his life over
this. So many told him he could
do more good outside of
prison."
Bahmann thinks so.
"Michael is extremely good
with figures and money. Truth
is, we're in financial trouble.
There is real work waiting for
him here, PR with other
churches, because I am so
damn busy, grant proposals,

money-raising campaigns."
Bahmann confides that even
the National Lutheran Church
is pressuring ULC to 'move
ahead' more briskly on the
mortgage." Aside from the
money worries, though, there
are advantages for Poulin at
ULC.
"We received a rather
generous gift from an indi
vidual donor which makes it
possible to pay him a small sal
ary. We thought it would be
helpful to provide him with a
job as well as acommunity. We
will give him exposure to lots
of people who will care for him
— a starting basis. To stretch
and reach out." Bahmann says
the job arrangement was
greeted with enthusiasm by
the congregation, and is con
sistent with his church's
policies.
"As Christians, we're called
upon to be radicals in a special
way. It means to not be out and
wave one flag or another. We

don't want to jump on every
bandwagon. We have to go to
the roots of problems and start
there for the changes we want,
and I don't mind being called
that kind of radical." Bahmann
thinks ULC's involvement with
issues ranging from Chilean re
fugees to opposition to the
recently-defeated Brigg's in
itiative will complement
Poulin's desire to "be of ser
vice to others. It was very im
portant to us, the way he tried
to make apologies to the indi
vidual he had injured,"
Bahmann says. "Also the way
he considers his own life, his
own person. He's undergone
some very intensive contem
plation and reflection."
Whether Poulin will stay at
ULC once he has readjusted to
outside life is unknown, but
Bahmann and his congregation
hope that ULC's environment
will give him a "place to be
long." In August, when Poulin
arrives, they will find out.
