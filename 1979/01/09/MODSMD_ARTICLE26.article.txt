## Tristano: a variety of approaches 
### 
When Lennie Tristano
passed away several months
ago, his death received only
passing notices in the trade
papers. This neglect, how
ever unfortunate, is
nonetheless understanda
ble. During the last two de
cades of his life Tristano's
presence on the jazz scene
was felt only indirectly
through his many pupils. Al
though most critics con
ceded that Tristano was one
of the most important in
novators in jazz, Lennie still
performed only rarely and
recorded even less often.
The jazz world abounds in
recluses, yet Tristano was
perhaps most reclusive of
them all.
One of the most persis
tent cliches of the artistic
world is the belief that an
artist must be dead before
he receives acclaim. Even a
cursory examination of the
world of culture reveals the
absurdity of this premise;
yet ironically, Tristano
seems to fall into the cliched
mold with surprising preci
sion. Since his recent death
three albums have been re
leased which document
Tristano's importance in the
jazz world.
The most significant of
these releases comes from
Inner City records and is en
titled Descent into the
Maelstrom. The album con
tains scattered takes of Tris
tano's work between the
years 1952 and 1966. So little
of Tristano's work is availa
ble that these recordings,
despite the mediocre sound
quality, are vital additions to
any comprehensive jazz col
lection.
Avant-garde
The title pice should
cause quite a stir in the
music world. The number is
a piece of program music
based on an Edgar Allan Poe
story. The work is an amaz
ingtechnical demonstration
of the possibilities of
avant-garde piano; Tristano
thrashes the piano with
finger-breaking atonal ar

peggios and dissonant
scales. The interesting as
pect of the recording is its
date; it was taped in 1953,
which would make it the
first (jazz critics keep track
of such things) experimen
tation with atonal jazz. Cecil
Taylor's first recording (in
1955) is mild in comparison,
while Ornette Coleman's
much heralded work of the
late '50s is not nearly so dar
ing.

The rest of the album re
veals the variety of Tris
tano's musical approaches.
The other solo pieces,
which sound as if they were
taped from a radio broad
cast, are engaging excur
sions in impressionism. The
trio pieces, which comprise
side two, document Tris
tano's "soft swing," which
was to influence others
such as Dave Brubeck and
Bill Evans.
Successful pupil
Prestige: First Recordings
is a reissue from Prestige
which documentsTristano's
playing of 30 years ago. Tris
tano's work comprises

about V* of the album; here
is is joined by his most suc
cessful pupil, alto
saxophonist Lee Konitz.
Konitz seems inspired by
the presence of his mentor
and turns in a particularly
moving performance. Tris
tano uses his solo space to
its best advantage, and pro
duces several concise and
melodic solos. The rest of
the album is devoted to per
formances by jazz

luminaries such as Bud
Powell, Al Haig, Serge
Chaloff and several others.
The third album reflects
Tristano only through the
prominence it affords two
of his most outstanding
pupils: Warne Marsh and
Lee Konitz. The album is Bill
Evans' latest (and perhaps
his last) release from Fan
tasy records entitled
Crosscurrents.
Strong effort
Evans has always sounded
much like Tristano, and the
presence of Konitz and
Marsh only serves to accen
tuate this resemblance. The
album is one of Evans' best

efforts —whenever he plays
with horns Evans always
seems to swing more
strongly and play more ag
gressively. The lastest re
lease is no exception; one
would have to go back to
the Quintessence of three
years ago to find a more
powerful group album from
Evans.
Marsh and Konitz engage
in some counterpoint solos
which belie their long as
sociation with each other.
"Night and Day"and
"Speak Low" are particu
larly rich in group interac
tion; here Evans de
monstrates his often over
looked abilities as an ac
companist, while his solos
are rich in ideas.
Highpoint
Yet the highpoint of the
album is a duet between
Konitz and Evans on the
haunting tune "When I Fall
in Love." Konitz has often
Seen seen as a disciple of
Charle Parker; but I have
always found his tone to be
much different from Bird's.
The clear airy sound he pro
duces goes farther back to
the musicof Johnny Hodges
and Benny Carter. On the
duet Konitz is particularly
conscious of his tone; he
plays slightly sharp, which is
a rarity for jazz player (sol
oists who inflect flat are
much more common in
jazz). But even more strik
ing is the refined breathi
ness of Konitz's attack.
Evans is particularly sensi
tive to Lee's playing, and the
result is one of the most
touching collaborations I
have heard in the past few
months.
Hopefully there is more
of Tristano's music which
has yet to be released. The
last decade of his life re
mains a mystery to jazz cri
tics; he was always search
ing for new ways to create
music, as these scattered
recordings document, but
even now his talent can only
be glimpsed at through his
few surviving recordings.

playing of 30 years ago. Tris
tano's work comprises

about V* of the album; here
is is joined by his most suc
cessful pupil, alto
saxophonist Lee Konitz.
Konitz seems inspired by
the presence of his mentor
and turns in a particularly
moving performance. Tris
tano uses his solo space to
its best advantage, and pro
duces several concise and
melodic solos. The rest of
the album is devoted to per
formances by jazz

luminaries such as Bud
Powell, Al Haig, Serge
Chaloff and several others.
The third album reflects
Tristano only through the
prominence it affords two
of his most outstanding
pupils: Warne Marsh and
Lee Konitz. The album is Bill
Evans' latest (and perhaps
his last) release from Fan
tasy records entitled
Crosscurrents.
Strong effort
Evans has always sounded
much like Tristano, and the
presence of Konitz and
Marsh only serves to accen
tuate this resemblance. The
album is one of Evans' best

efforts —whenever he plays
with horns Evans always
seems to swing more
strongly and play more ag
gressively. The lastest re
lease is no exception; one
would have to go back to
the Quintessence of three
years ago to find a more
powerful group album from
Evans.
Marsh and Konitz engage
in some counterpoint solos
which belie their long as
sociation with each other.
"Night and Day"and
"Speak Low" are particu
larly rich in group interac
tion; here Evans de
monstrates his often over
looked abilities as an ac
companist, while his solos
are rich in ideas.
Highpoint
Yet the highpoint of the
album is a duet between
Konitz and Evans on the
haunting tune "When I Fall
in Love." Konitz has often
Seen seen as a disciple of
Charle Parker; but I have
always found his tone to be
much different from Bird's.
The clear airy sound he pro
duces goes farther back to
the musicof Johnny Hodges
and Benny Carter. On the
duet Konitz is particularly
conscious of his tone; he
plays slightly sharp, which is
a rarity for jazz player (sol
oists who inflect flat are
much more common in
jazz). But even more strik
ing is the refined breathi
ness of Konitz's attack.
Evans is particularly sensi
tive to Lee's playing, and the
result is one of the most
touching collaborations I
have heard in the past few
months.
Hopefully there is more
of Tristano's music which
has yet to be released. The
last decade of his life re
mains a mystery to jazz cri
tics; he was always search
ing for new ways to create
music, as these scattered
recordings document, but
even now his talent can only
be glimpsed at through his
few surviving recordings.

When Lennie Tristano
passed away several months
ago, his death received only
passing notices in the trade
papers. This neglect, how
ever unfortunate, is
nonetheless understanda
ble. During the last two de
cades of his life Tristano's
presence on the jazz scene
was felt only indirectly
through his many pupils. Al
though most critics con
ceded that Tristano was one
of the most important in
novators in jazz, Lennie still
performed only rarely and
recorded even less often.
The jazz world abounds in
recluses, yet Tristano was
perhaps most reclusive of
them all.
One of the most persis
tent cliches of the artistic
world is the belief that an
artist must be dead before
he receives acclaim. Even a
cursory examination of the
world of culture reveals the
absurdity of this premise;
yet ironically, Tristano
seems to fall into the cliched
mold with surprising preci
sion. Since his recent death
three albums have been re
leased which document
Tristano's importance in the
jazz world.
The most significant of
these releases comes from
Inner City records and is en
titled Descent into the
Maelstrom. The album con
tains scattered takes of Tris
tano's work between the
years 1952 and 1966. So little
of Tristano's work is availa
ble that these recordings,
despite the mediocre sound
quality, are vital additions to
any comprehensive jazz col
lection.
Avant-garde
The title pice should
cause quite a stir in the
music world. The number is
a piece of program music
based on an Edgar Allan Poe
story. The work is an amaz
ingtechnical demonstration
of the possibilities of
avant-garde piano; Tristano
thrashes the piano with
finger-breaking atonal ar

peggios and dissonant
scales. The interesting as
pect of the recording is its
date; it was taped in 1953,
which would make it the
first (jazz critics keep track
of such things) experimen
tation with atonal jazz. Cecil
Taylor's first recording (in
1955) is mild in comparison,
while Ornette Coleman's
much heralded work of the
late '50s is not nearly so dar
ing.

The rest of the album re
veals the variety of Tris
tano's musical approaches.
The other solo pieces,
which sound as if they were
taped from a radio broad
cast, are engaging excur
sions in impressionism. The
trio pieces, which comprise
side two, document Tris
tano's "soft swing," which
was to influence others
such as Dave Brubeck and
Bill Evans.
