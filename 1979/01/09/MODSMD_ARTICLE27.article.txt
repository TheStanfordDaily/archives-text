## Queen fails to experiment

Queen
Elektra/Asylum
Queen has never been pre
dictable. After their hard rock
ing debut album, many obser
vers foresaw a new Led Zeppe
lin, only to be surprised by a
softer, more progressive and
experimental followup, Queen
11, quite possibly Queen's
finest work to date. More re
cently, Queen once again sur
prised many by producing the
jagged sounding News of the
World, an about-face from the
ultra-polished and interesting
Night at the Opera /Day at the
Races period. Perhaps the dif
ference is most dramatically il
lustrated in production times:
Day at the Races took over a
year to record, News of the
World took barely one month.
Veers away
Queen's newest, lazz took
two months to record, and it
thus, expectedly, veers away
from the rawness of such cuts
as "Get Down Make Love"
from News. Unexpected,
though, is Jazz's overall softer
sound. Only two of the al
bum's 13 tunes, "Dead on
Time" and "Let Me Entertain
You," strike as hard as the
majority of News. This is seem
ingly good news, since, as has

been demonstrated on previ
ous albums, Queen is more
adept at writing good "fun"
rock than hard rock.
Unfortunately, while Jazz is
musically much better than its
predecessor, it fails to com
pare favorably with Queen's
earlier material. The trouble
lies with Queen's failure to ex
periment and the absense of
amusing lyrics. Only one of the
album's tunes, "Mustapha,"
which sounds like a rock-a
tized Gregorian chant, displays
any real excursions outside
standard rock fare.
Compare this to, say, the
Gilbert and Sullivan rock tones
of "Bohemian Rhapsody," the
bizzare tone and stereo separa
tion of the "Prophets' Song,"
and the rock version of "God
Save the Queen," all of which
appear on one album. Night at
the Opera. "Mustapha" wilts in
comparison.
Misses mark
Some of this album's songs
attempt to capture the amusing
qualities of songs such as "The
Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke"
and "Old Fashioned Lover
Boy" among many, but some
how miss their mark. "Bicycle
Race" attempts to be light and
enticing but sounds plain and
witless. "Dreamer's Ball" finds
a wistful Freddie Mercury

thinking about an imaginary
dance, but bores the listener
more than anything else, in
much the same way as "My
Melancholy Blues" from News
did. "Don't Stop Me Now"
couples an exciting beat with
Mercury's whimsical claims,
and makes for one of the al
bum's few inspired moments.
The remainder of the album
consists of songs with mildly
catchy melodies and some
what above-average lyrics, but
they are all relatively undistin
guished. There's enough here,
then, to satisfy the passive lis
tener, i.e. one who knows
Queen from only a few songs.
Butforthe avid Queen fan who
has followed them from the
start (or nearly so), this album
is a disappointment. Let us
hope that, unlike Jazz, the next
album will be more classical.
