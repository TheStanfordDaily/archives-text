# Improvising cellist to perform
## 
### 
Gwendolyn Watson, cellist, composer and im
proviser, will be appearing at Stanford on
Thursday evening, January 11th at 7:00 p.m. in
the Serra House lounge of Stern Hall. The even
ing will feature both classical works and her own
original compositions.
Ail accomplished performer, Watson is
well known for her ability in the art of accom
panying dancers and in composing music for
modern dance. Her commissions for dance
have brought her international recognition.
In 1967 the Martha Graham Dance Company
invited her to compose a piece for their com
pany in New York City. Watson says,"I
thought it over for 24 hours, and decided to go
to New York for a year." It turned into 10 during
which she taught at the Herbert Lehman College
of New York City, the Julliard School and the
National Association for Regional Ballet, and
traveled to teach and perform as far as Alaska,
Canada and Switzerland. During this time she
also composed works for New York Dance
companies, including Paul Taylor, Rod Rogers,
Paul Sanasardo and Margaret Beals. The Cana
dian Arts Council invited her to conduct the first
symposium ever for dance accompanists last
summer. Students will come again this summer
from all over Canada to learn about improvisa
tion from Watson.
The Village Voice said of her "The minute I see
Gwen Watson haul her cello on stage, I know

things are going to be fine for awhile." The New
York Times has called her "A zany but serious
musician" and the Anchorage (Alaska) Times said
last summer, "Like most originals, in both art
and nature, it is a hybrid, the product of a blend,
a new kind of animal ...She makes music
movement, poetry, humor, and even a whimsi
cal philosophy of joy."
Gwendolyn Watson is a native Californian,
born in Santa Rosa. Her gift in music and her
independent spirit were recognized and en
couraged by her family. She received a B.A. in
Music from UC-Santa Barbara, and took her
M.A. at Mills College in Music Composition. Im
portant influences on her music have been
Bonnie Hampton, the cellist, Darius Milhaud,
the composer, Louis Horst, dance accompanist,
and Pablo Casais, with whom she studied in
Puerto Rico, after receiving a special grant along
with 14 others chosen from all over the world.
Ms. Watson's forte is improvisation. She has
cut two spontaneously improvised albums,
"Kinetic Transparencies" and"I Keep Thinking
of the Word Peace," the former widely used as
accompaniment to dance. The evening at Serra
House will highlight improvisation and audi
ence participation. The one-woman show will
feature Eurydice, her cello, and the impromptu
use of taped recordings. It's an evening not to
miss!
