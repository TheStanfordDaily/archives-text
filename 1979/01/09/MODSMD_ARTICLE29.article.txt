# A.P. SUMMARY

### 
Demonstrations continue in Iran
Tehran, Iran — Bloody demonstrations demand
ing abdication of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
raged across Iran yesterday and the new civilian
government ran into problems with military and
political leaders.
Newspapers said 50-60 persons were killed in 10
cities and protests were reported in most Iranian
cities.
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar delayed until
Thursday plans to present his Cabinet to Parlia
ment. A key general was reported to have backed
out of the Cabinet and government employees
were said to have tried to block Bakhtiar ministers
from their offices.
Sources said Gen. Fereidum Jam, the man
Bakhtiar chose to supervise Iran's 430,000-man
military establishment, rejected the appointment
and met with Bakhtiar Thursday. He reportedly
disagreed with plans to restructure the military,
backbone of the shah's power.
Cooperation of the military is considered crucial
to the new government.
Sources said the shah would await the vote of
confidence from the lower house and the Senate,
which meets on the matter Saturday, before pos
sibly departing on a trip abroad.
Cambodia makes last effort
Bangkok, Thailand — Routed Cambodian leaders
were trying yesterday to organize a loyal force to
make a last stand against Vietnamese troops and
pro-Hanoi Cambodian rebels who seized most of
the country and set up a provisional government
in Phnom Penh, reliable analysts said.
The rebel National United Front for National
Salvation claimed they "totally liberated" the capi
tal of Phnom Penh, overthrew Premier Pol Pot and
had complete control of Cambodia.
Radio Hanoi, however, said some areas had not
yet fallen to the rebels.
Premier Pol Pot and the other deposed leaders
— having abandoned the capital to Vietnamese
and rebel forces on Sunday — were trying to set up
a line of resistance near Siem Reap in northwest
ern Cambodia, the analysts reported. The rebels
claimed they were in control of the area, about 320
miles northwest of Phnom Penh.
Unconfirmed reports said the top Cambodian
leadership had been evacuated by air to China,
Cambodia's major backer, which verbally attacked
the Vietnamese but did not come to Cambodia's
aid militarily.
The rebel news agency said an eight-member
"People's Revolutionary Council" had been set up
and front leader Heng Samrin, a defector from the
Pol Pot government, was named chairman.
The rebels promised to restore democratic
rights and reinstate traditional practices, including
the Buddhist religion, and to move Cambodia to
ward "peace, freedom, nonalignment and
socialism."
French tanker explodes; 50 die
Bantry, Ireland — Two explosions ripped
through the big French tanker Betelgeuse unload
ing at a Gulf Oil terminal here yesterday, cutting
the vessel in two and hurling the bodies of the
crew into a sea of flaming oil. The death toll was

placed at 50, including the crew of 41, two rep
resentatives of the tanker's owners and seven local
workers engulfed in the ball of fire.
By nightfall, only 15 bodies had been recovered
— all badly mutilated and horribly burned, some
with limbs blown off in the blast. The owners said
in Paris that two were identified, a sailor and a
woman, the wife of the ship's baker.
Gulf Oil officials could give no immediate cause,
but oil experts in London speculated that the blast
may have been triggered off by highly volatile
gases in the ship's emptying oil tanks.
Cork County pollution officer Liam Mullins said
if initial reports about the amount of oil spilled
were correct, then the resulting pollution would
be 20 times greater than the biggest previous spill
at Bantry in 1974. The Betelgeuse was carrying 31
million gallons. Terminal manager Don Ashe, an
American, wid the spillage was likely to be mini
mal, however.
The record Amoco Cadiz spill off France in
March 1978 was estimated at 39 million gallons.
The explosion occurred when the 121,430-ton
deadweight Betelgeuse, owned by the Compagnie
Navale des Petroles, had unloaded two-thirds of its
cargo of crude oil through undersea pipes into the
terminal on Whiddy Island. The Betelgeuse was
standing about three miles offshore at the time.
While large, the Betelgeuse was well below the
200,000-ton size of the supertankers.
Brown proposes tax, state job cut
Sacramento — Gov. jerry Brown proposed cuts
of $1 billion in taxes and 5000 in state jobs yester
day in an inaugural address filled with emotional
attacks on government spending.
The 40-year-old Democrat, in a speech that
sounded much like a kickoff of a presidential cam
paign, also endorsed a national constitutional
convention on an amendment requiring the fed
eral government to balance its budget.
Brown, starting his second term, was somber as
he read from a prepared text for the first time in
over four years. An audience of about 400 legis
lators, supporters and aides was restrained, inter
rupting the speech with applause only three times.
The emphasis on national issues was unusual for
an inaugural address. Republican critics described
it as the beginning of a 1980 campaign for presi
dent.
Brown, who has not flatly ruled out such a 1980
bid, also promised in the televised address to cut
state taxes back to 1975 levels.
"This requires a $1 billion tax cut. Such a reduc
tion should, on a percentage basis, give the
greatest benefit to renters and those at the lower
and middle income level of the income scale."
Gay named as SF supervisor
San Francisco— Mayor Dianne Feinstein named
a 40-year-old homosexual auditor and former
Methodist minister yesterday to replace slain
Supervisor Harvey Milk.
Harry Britt, a former letter carrier who had plan
ned to go to law school this fall, is viewed as a
low-key, quiet believer in many of the causes that
Milk loudly espoused.
"I do not consider myself a leader of gays
around the world," said Britt. "There will never be
another Harvey Milk.

"Harvey was a prophet," said Britt. "I'm more of
a tactician."
Milk, one of the nation's few avowed homosex
ual political figures and San Francisco's first gay
supervisor, was gunned down Nov. 27 in City Hall,
along with Mayor George Moscone. Former
Supervisor Dan White has been charged with the
shootings.
Estimates are that one-sixth of the city's 660,000
residents are homosexual, and they have become
a powerful political force in the city.
Reversal on Tanner case sought
San Francisco — The Attorney General asked the
California Supreme Court yesterday to reconsider
its controversial Tanner decision which over
turned a law involving mandatory prison terms for
using a gun during a crime.
The petition for rehearing suggested the court
should make its Dec. 22 decision "conform . . .
with views expressed in its opinions."
The decision, signed by three justices, did not
hold the law unconstitutional. But it said the legis
lature did not intend that triai judges should be
stripped of the power to throw out the gun use
charge and grant probation in certain cir
cumstances.
Chief Justice Rose Bird agreed with three dissen
ters that the legislature intended to make a prison
term mandatory when a gun was used, and re
move the power of granting probation from a
judge hearing such a case.
The three dissenters said lawmakers had the
power to do that, but Chief Justice Bird contended
it violated the constitutional separation of powers
and concluded the trial court's granting of proba
tion must be affirmed.
Thus, the attorney general said, four justices
held that under the law the trial judge has no
discretion to grant probation where a gun is used.
Major oil workers strike put off
Denver — Oil workers struck one refinery yes
terday and honored a strike at a second one, but
their union put off any major walkout until iearn
ing the Carter Administration's reaction to a pos
sible 8.3 percent raise.
The contract dispute, in which offers from 21
companies were rejected yesterday, is the first
major union test of President Jimmy Carter's
wage-price guidelines.
Contracts covering 60,000 members of the
Denver-based Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
International Union expired at midnight Sunday.
But an offer from Amoco that the union is consid
ering has delayed any union-wide strike.
Market suffers mild setback
New York — The stock market suffered a mild
setback yesterday as the New Year's rally of last
week faded.
Analysts said some selling was to be expected
after the 25.72-point runup in the Dow Jones in
dustrial average over the first four trading sessions
of the year last week.
Today's weather
Rain likely on and off through today. Little
temperature change. Highs in the mid to upper

Estimates are that one-sixth of the city's 660,000

Reversal on Tanner case sought
San Francisco — The Attorney General asked the
California Supreme Court yesterday to reconsider
its controversial Tanner decision which over
turned a law involving mandatory prison terms for
using a gun during a crime.
The petition for rehearing suggested the court
should make its Dec. 22 decision "conform . . .
with views expressed in its opinions."
The decision, signed by three justices, did not
hold the law unconstitutional. But it said the legis
lature did not intend that triai judges should be
stripped of the power to throw out the gun use
charge and grant probation in certain cir
cumstances.
Chief Justice Rose Bird agreed with three dissen
ters that the legislature intended to make a prison
term mandatory when a gun was used, and re
move the power of granting probation from a
judge hearing such a case.
The three dissenters said lawmakers had the
power to do that, but Chief Justice Bird contended
it violated the constitutional separation of powers
and concluded the trial court's granting of proba
tion must be affirmed.
Thus, the attorney general said, four justices
held that under the law the trial judge has no
discretion to grant probation where a gun is used.
Major oil workers strike put off
Denver — Oil workers struck one refinery yes
terday and honored a strike at a second one, but
their union put off any major walkout until iearn

The contract dispute, in which offers from 21
companies were rejected yesterday, is the first
major union test of President Jimmy Carter's
wage-price guidelines.
Contracts covering 60,000 members of the
Denver-based Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
International Union expired at midnight Sunday.
But an offer from Amoco that the union is consid

Market suffers mild setback
New York — The stock market suffered a mild
setback yesterday as the New Year's rally of last

Analysts said some selling was to be expected

dustrial average over the first four trading sessions
of the year last week.

Demonstrations continue in Iran
Tehran, Iran — Bloody demonstrations demand
ing abdication of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
raged across Iran yesterday and the new civilian
government ran into problems with military and
political leaders.
Newspapers said 50-60 persons were killed in 10
cities and protests were reported in most Iranian
cities.
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar delayed until
Thursday plans to present his Cabinet to Parlia
ment. A key general was reported to have backed
out of the Cabinet and government employees
were said to have tried to block Bakhtiar ministers
from their offices.
Sources said Gen. Fereidum Jam, the man
Bakhtiar chose to supervise Iran's 430,000-man
military establishment, rejected the appointment
and met with Bakhtiar Thursday. He reportedly
disagreed with plans to restructure the military,
backbone of the shah's power.
Cooperation of the military is considered crucial

Sources said the shah would await the vote of
confidence from the lower house and the Senate,
which meets on the matter Saturday, before pos

Cambodia makes last effort
Bangkok, Thailand — Routed Cambodian leaders
were trying yesterday to organize a loyal force to
make a last stand against Vietnamese troops and
pro-Hanoi Cambodian rebels who seized most of
the country and set up a provisional government
in Phnom Penh, reliable analysts said.
The rebel National United Front for National
Salvation claimed they "totally liberated" the capi
tal of Phnom Penh, overthrew Premier Pol Pot and
had complete control of Cambodia.
Radio Hanoi, however, said some areas had not
yet fallen to the rebels.
Premier Pol Pot and the other deposed leaders
— having abandoned the capital to Vietnamese
and rebel forces on Sunday — were trying to set up
a line of resistance near Siem Reap in northwest
ern Cambodia, the analysts reported. The rebels
claimed they were in control of the area, about 320
miles northwest of Phnom Penh.
Unconfirmed reports said the top Cambodian
leadership had been evacuated by air to China,
Cambodia's major backer, which verbally attacked
the Vietnamese but did not come to Cambodia's
aid militarily.
The rebel news agency said an eight-member
"People's Revolutionary Council" had been set up
and front leader Heng Samrin, a defector from the
Pol Pot government, was named chairman.
The rebels promised to restore democratic
rights and reinstate traditional practices, including
the Buddhist religion, and to move Cambodia to
ward "peace, freedom, nonalignment and
socialism."
French tanker explodes; 50 die
Bantry, Ireland — Two explosions ripped
through the big French tanker Betelgeuse unload
ing at a Gulf Oil terminal here yesterday, cutting
the vessel in two and hurling the bodies of the
crew into a sea of flaming oil. The death toll was

placed at 50, including the crew of 41, two rep
resentatives of the tanker's owners and seven local
workers engulfed in the ball of fire.
By nightfall, only 15 bodies had been recovered
— all badly mutilated and horribly burned, some
with limbs blown off in the blast. The owners said
in Paris that two were identified, a sailor and a
woman, the wife of the ship's baker.
Gulf Oil officials could give no immediate cause,
but oil experts in London speculated that the blast
may have been triggered off by highly volatile
gases in the ship's emptying oil tanks.
Cork County pollution officer Liam Mullins said
if initial reports about the amount of oil spilled
were correct, then the resulting pollution would
be 20 times greater than the biggest previous spill
at Bantry in 1974. The Betelgeuse was carrying 31
million gallons. Terminal manager Don Ashe, an
American, wid the spillage was likely to be mini
mal, however.
The record Amoco Cadiz spill off France in
March 1978 was estimated at 39 million gallons.
The explosion occurred when the 121,430-ton
deadweight Betelgeuse, owned by the Compagnie
Navale des Petroles, had unloaded two-thirds of its
cargo of crude oil through undersea pipes into the
terminal on Whiddy Island. The Betelgeuse was
standing about three miles offshore at the time.
While large, the Betelgeuse was well below the
200,000-ton size of the supertankers.
Brown proposes tax, state job cut
Sacramento — Gov. jerry Brown proposed cuts
of $1 billion in taxes and 5000 in state jobs yester
day in an inaugural address filled with emotional
attacks on government spending.
The 40-year-old Democrat, in a speech that
sounded much like a kickoff of a presidential cam
paign, also endorsed a national constitutional
convention on an amendment requiring the fed
eral government to balance its budget.
Brown, starting his second term, was somber as
he read from a prepared text for the first time in
over four years. An audience of about 400 legis
lators, supporters and aides was restrained, inter
rupting the speech with applause only three times.
The emphasis on national issues was unusual for
an inaugural address. Republican critics described
it as the beginning of a 1980 campaign for presi
dent.
Brown, who has not flatly ruled out such a 1980
bid, also promised in the televised address to cut
state taxes back to 1975 levels.
"This requires a $1 billion tax cut. Such a reduc
tion should, on a percentage basis, give the
greatest benefit to renters and those at the lower
and middle income level of the income scale."
Gay named as SF supervisor
San Francisco— Mayor Dianne Feinstein named
a 40-year-old homosexual auditor and former

placed at 50, including the crew of 41, two rep
resentatives of the tanker's owners and seven local
workers engulfed in the ball of fire.
By nightfall, only 15 bodies had been recovered
— all badly mutilated and horribly burned, some
with limbs blown off in the blast. The owners said
in Paris that two were identified, a sailor and a
woman, the wife of the ship's baker.
Gulf Oil officials could give no immediate cause,
but oil experts in London speculated that the blast
may have been triggered off by highly volatile
gases in the ship's emptying oil tanks.
Cork County pollution officer Liam Mullins said
if initial reports about the amount of oil spilled
were correct, then the resulting pollution would
be 20 times greater than the biggest previous spill
at Bantry in 1974. The Betelgeuse was carrying 31
million gallons. Terminal manager Don Ashe, an
American, wid the spillage was likely to be mini
mal, however.
The record Amoco Cadiz spill off France in
March 1978 was estimated at 39 million gallons.
The explosion occurred when the 121,430-ton
deadweight Betelgeuse, owned by the Compagnie
Navale des Petroles, had unloaded two-thirds of its
cargo of crude oil through undersea pipes into the
terminal on Whiddy Island. The Betelgeuse was
standing about three miles offshore at the time.
While large, the Betelgeuse was well below the
200,000-ton size of the supertankers.
Brown proposes tax, state job cut
Sacramento — Gov. jerry Brown proposed cuts
of $1 billion in taxes and 5000 in state jobs yester
day in an inaugural address filled with emotional
attacks on government spending.
The 40-year-old Democrat, in a speech that
sounded much like a kickoff of a presidential cam
paign, also endorsed a national constitutional
convention on an amendment requiring the fed
eral government to balance its budget.
Brown, starting his second term, was somber as
he read from a prepared text for the first time in
over four years. An audience of about 400 legis
lators, supporters and aides was restrained, inter
rupting the speech with applause only three times.
The emphasis on national issues was unusual for
an inaugural address. Republican critics described
it as the beginning of a 1980 campaign for presi
dent.
Brown, who has not flatly ruled out such a 1980
bid, also promised in the televised address to cut
state taxes back to 1975 levels.
"This requires a $1 billion tax cut. Such a reduc
tion should, on a percentage basis, give the
greatest benefit to renters and those at the lower
and middle income level of the income scale."
Gay named as SF supervisor
San Francisco— Mayor Dianne Feinstein named
a 40-year-old homosexual auditor and former
Methodist minister yesterday to replace slain
Supervisor Harvey Milk.
Harry Britt, a former letter carrier who had plan
ned to go to law school this fall, is viewed as a
low-key, quiet believer in many of the causes that
Milk loudly espoused.
"I do not consider myself a leader of gays
around the world," said Britt. "There will never be
another Harvey Milk.

"Harvey was a prophet," said Britt. "I'm more of
a tactician."
Milk, one of the nation's few avowed homosex
ual political figures and San Francisco's first gay
supervisor, was gunned down Nov. 27 in City Hall,
along with Mayor George Moscone. Former
Supervisor Dan White has been charged with the
shootings.
Estimates are that one-sixth of the city's 660,000
residents are homosexual, and they have become
a powerful political force in the city.
Reversal on Tanner case sought
San Francisco — The Attorney General asked the
California Supreme Court yesterday to reconsider
its controversial Tanner decision which over
turned a law involving mandatory prison terms for
using a gun during a crime.
The petition for rehearing suggested the court
should make its Dec. 22 decision "conform . . .
with views expressed in its opinions."
The decision, signed by three justices, did not
hold the law unconstitutional. But it said the legis
lature did not intend that triai judges should be
stripped of the power to throw out the gun use
charge and grant probation in certain cir
cumstances.
Chief Justice Rose Bird agreed with three dissen
ters that the legislature intended to make a prison
term mandatory when a gun was used, and re
move the power of granting probation from a
judge hearing such a case.
The three dissenters said lawmakers had the
power to do that, but Chief Justice Bird contended
it violated the constitutional separation of powers
and concluded the trial court's granting of proba
tion must be affirmed.
Thus, the attorney general said, four justices
held that under the law the trial judge has no
discretion to grant probation where a gun is used.
Major oil workers strike put off
Denver — Oil workers struck one refinery yes
terday and honored a strike at a second one, but
their union put off any major walkout until iearn
ing the Carter Administration's reaction to a pos
sible 8.3 percent raise.
The contract dispute, in which offers from 21
companies were rejected yesterday, is the first
major union test of President Jimmy Carter's
wage-price guidelines.
Contracts covering 60,000 members of the
Denver-based Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
International Union expired at midnight Sunday.
But an offer from Amoco that the union is consid
ering has delayed any union-wide strike.
Market suffers mild setback
New York — The stock market suffered a mild
setback yesterday as the New Year's rally of last
week faded.
Analysts said some selling was to be expected
after the 25.72-point runup in the Dow Jones in
dustrial average over the first four trading sessions
of the year last week.
Today's weather
Rain likely on and off through today. Little
temperature change. Highs in the mid to upper
50s. Lows in upper 40s to low 50s.
Demonstrations continue in Iran
Tehran, Iran — Bloody demonstrations demand
ing abdication of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
raged across Iran yesterday and the new civilian
government ran into problems with military and
political leaders.
Newspapers said 50-60 persons were killed in 10
cities and protests were reported in most Iranian
cities.
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar delayed until
Thursday plans to present his Cabinet to Parlia
ment. A key general was reported to have backed
out of the Cabinet and government employees
were said to have tried to block Bakhtiar ministers
from their offices.
Sources said Gen. Fereidum Jam, the man
Bakhtiar chose to supervise Iran's 430,000-man
military establishment, rejected the appointment
and met with Bakhtiar Thursday. He reportedly
disagreed with plans to restructure the military,
backbone of the shah's power.
Cooperation of the military is considered crucial
to the new government.
Sources said the shah would await the vote of
confidence from the lower house and the Senate,
which meets on the matter Saturday, before pos
sibly departing on a trip abroad.
Cambodia makes last effort
Bangkok, Thailand — Routed Cambodian leaders
were trying yesterday to organize a loyal force to
make a last stand against Vietnamese troops and
pro-Hanoi Cambodian rebels who seized most of
the country and set up a provisional government
in Phnom Penh, reliable analysts said.
The rebel National United Front for National
Salvation claimed they "totally liberated" the capi
tal of Phnom Penh, overthrew Premier Pol Pot and
had complete control of Cambodia.
Radio Hanoi, however, said some areas had not
yet fallen to the rebels.
Premier Pol Pot and the other deposed leaders
— having abandoned the capital to Vietnamese
and rebel forces on Sunday — were trying to set up
a line of resistance near Siem Reap in northwest
ern Cambodia, the analysts reported. The rebels
claimed they were in control of the area, about 320
miles northwest of Phnom Penh.
Unconfirmed reports said the top Cambodian
leadership had been evacuated by air to China,
Cambodia's major backer, which verbally attacked
the Vietnamese but did not come to Cambodia's
aid militarily.
The rebel news agency said an eight-member
"People's Revolutionary Council" had been set up
and front leader Heng Samrin, a defector from the
Pol Pot government, was named chairman.
The rebels promised to restore democratic
rights and reinstate traditional practices, including
the Buddhist religion, and to move Cambodia to
ward "peace, freedom, nonalignment and
socialism."
French tanker explodes; 50 die
Bantry, Ireland — Two explosions ripped
through the big French tanker Betelgeuse unload
ing at a Gulf Oil terminal here yesterday, cutting
the vessel in two and hurling the bodies of the
crew into a sea of flaming oil. The death toll was

placed at 50, including the crew of 41, two rep
resentatives of the tanker's owners and seven local
