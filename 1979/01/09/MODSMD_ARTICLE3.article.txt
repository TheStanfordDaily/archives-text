# HEW proposal will prevent medical grants from meeting tuition rise
## 
### ANDREA JAMES 
Senior staff writer
Medical students in some scholar
ship programs may not be able to get
more money when tuition costs rise
if a recent proposal by the Deapt
ment of Health, Education and Wel
fare (HEW) becomes law.
According to a proposal published
in a November Federal Register, stu
dents in the National Health Service
Corps Scholarship Program, the In
dian Health Scholarship Program and
a program giving grants to Students
of Exceptional Financial Need might
not get proportionally higher scho
larships if medical schools raise tui
tion for reasons other than to combat
"uncontrollable costs."
The Medical School participates in
these three programs, a spokesman
in the school's Office of Student Af

fairs said.
However, neither the school's fi
nancial aids office nor a San
Frnacisco division of HEW's Educati
nal Program Office has been notified
of HEW's proposal.
"Things usually start in
Washington D.C. and gradually filter
down to us," said Fran Epps of the
HEW office in San Fracisco. "This
proposal has to go to public hearing
before it becomes law and even then
it will take some time before we can
start enforcing it."
The proposal defines "uncontroll
able costs" as fuel costs and in
creases geared to "the institution's
efforts to improve and maintain the
quality of health profession s educa
tion at the institution."
Examples of permissible increases

include hiring additional faculty to
improve the faculty-student ratio, in
creases in programs providing off
site training to students and the
purchase of "necessary and impor
tant teaching equipment."
The law would give HEW the right
to demand a detailed account of a
medical school's expenses, espe
cially where tuition is rising more
than the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
However, "it is not intended that
the CPI be interpreted as being the
maximum or minimum increase that
will be acceptable," the proposal
states.
Epps said there is no way of telling
when HEW's proposal will go before
the public for a hearing. "It all de
pends on how fast the proposing
committee acts," she explained.
