# Engineering offered at Florence campus
## 
### JOHN DEAN 
Nestled on the edge of Florence,
Italy, and surrounded by natural gar
dens and woods is the villa that
houses the 76 Stanford students dur
ing their Overseas Studies Program.
This quarter, 17 of these students
have set a new stage in Stanford edu
cation â€” it is the first time that en
gineering courses have been offered
at an overseas campus.
Prof, lames Adams, associate dean
for academic affairs in the Engineer
ing Department, said that "there was
a feeling in the department for a long
time that the overseas studies prog
ram is a good thing for students and
yet engineering students face prob
lems going abroad."
Because of the highly structured
nature of the engineering program,
few engineers could take advantage
of going abroad to study, he said.
Engineering students must start their
major by taking sequences of pre
liminary studies.
The Florence program is an at
tempt to help engineering students
"academically on a one-to-one basis
and to offer classes on a tutoring
basis," Adams said.

Ronald Bracewell, Lewis Terman
professor in electrical engineering, is
teaching at Florence for the remain
der of the academic year. Offering
tutorials in five or six topics, he will
tutor any engineering course on in
dividual needs, said Peggy Blument
hal, student services coordinator for
overseas studies.
Topics being taught include the
continuing series in circuits, elec
tromechanics and electronics.
Bracewell also teaches an astronomy
course.
Always encouraged
Madelyn Hunt, assistant dean of
the School of Engineering, said, "we
have always encouraged our stu
dents to go overseas. But for the en
gineering student, the overseas
program must be carefully planned
in advance."
Some department advisers actively
encourage students to go overseas,
Hunt said. Advisers help plan the
best quarter for the student to go.
About five to 10 students from the
various engineering departments
study overseas every year, Blument
hal said.
The method for selecting en

gineering students for the Florence
program differed from the general
selection process. Rather than fulfil
ling the normal two quarters of Ita
lian, engineering students were only
required to fulfill one quarter, Blu
menthal said. In addition, the en
gineering students did not need to
have fulfilled the language require
ment before applying.
In the selection process, "we nor
mally look for fairly strong relevant
course-work, but in the engineering
program there's not much room for
that," Blumenthal said. "Most of the
engineers selected do have one or
two courses in history, political sci
ence or art," she added.
Priority was given to students
closer to graduation, Blumenthal
said. However, the main difference
in the selection process is fewer
academic prerequisites forengineer
ing students.
Twelve chosen
Twelve engineering students were
selected for this quarter's Florence
program, according to Blumenthal.
She said Bracewell could not handle
more than that on a tutorial basis.
"The engineering students are not

treated as a special category except
in their Italian requirement," Blu
menthal said. However, she added,
the difference in levels of Italian will
equalize because "once the en
gineering students are immersed in
the language, they'll progress."
Blumenthal said the overseas of
fice will "see how Florence goes and
see if there are any special problems
that have to be dealt with. We're
not expecting too many problems."
In any case, Blumenthal said
"we're committed to the idea that
you can send them (engineering stu
dents) over and we've got to make
more programs available to en
gineering and science students be
cause they do make up a large popu
lation at Stanford."
Bracewell developed
The Florence program was de
veloped by Bracewell and other fa
culty members in the Engineering
Department. Bracewell received ap
proval for his classes at Florence in
February. The department held sev
eral meetings with Mark Mancall, di
rector of overseas studies to encour
age the development of a program
