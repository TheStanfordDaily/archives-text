# Walsh to 49ers; Dowhower is in
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Stanford receiving coach Rod
Dowhower will be named today to
replace Bill Walsh as Stanford's head
football coach. Walsh is leaving Stan
ford to take the head job with the San
Francisco 49ers.
The 35-year-old Dowhower will be
named head coach at 11:30 a.m. at
the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco,
where new Athletic Director Andy
Ceiger is attending the NCAA Con
vention.
Yesterday 49er owner Eddie De-
Bartolo Jr. fired general manager Joe
Thomas, head coach Fred O'Connor
and the entire coaching staff to make
way for the arrival of Walsh, a 10-year
coaching veteran in the NFL. Walsh
left the pros two years ago to take the
reins at Stanford, where he led the
Cards to a 17-7 record and two bowl
victories.
Geiger, who said yesterday that he
has had "the shortest honeymoon on
record" at his new job, moved
quickly to replace Walsh so that Stan
ford's current recruiting campaign
would not be hampered by coaching
question marks.
"With coach Dowhower taking
over, there should be no change in
the way our program is going now,"
Card wide receiver Ken Margerum
said. "He's the same type personality
as Bill and if anyone knows our of
fense the way coach Walsh does, it's
coach Dowhower. There should be
no changes in our offensive
scheme."
Dowhower recruited Margerum
and the sophomore starter gave the
new head coach outstanding marks
for being above board while dealing
with high school players.
"If it was anyone else in the whole
nation, I'd be disappointed,"
Margerum added. "I was praying it
would be him."
Dowhower began his coaching
career as a student assistant to San
Diego State coach Don Coryell,
working with quarterbacks and wide
receivers. Following graduation in

1968, he remained with the Aztecs as
offensive coordinator, then moved
to St. Louis in 1973 as an assistant
coach when the Cardinals named
Coryell as their head coach.
After one year in the NFL,
Dowhower returned to the West
Coast and served as offensive coor
dinator at UCLA, where he de
veloped 1975 All-America quarter
back John Sciarra, and Boise State.
He joined Walsh's fledgling Stanford
staff in December 1976.
Dowhower, given much of the
credit for the development of such
standouts as Haven Moses, Isaac
Curtis, Jesse Freitas and Don Horn
while at San Diego and James Lofton,
Guy Benjamin, Steve Dils and Ken
Margerum at Stanford, faces the
challenge of improving upon the
successes of the last two years.
Walsh, on the other hand, goes to
San Francisco where the 49ers have
finished their worst season in a 33-
year history, posting a dismal 2-14
mark.
Don Klosterman, general manager
of the Los Angeles Rams, and Dick
Mansperger, personnel director of
the Seattle Seahawks, have been
named as possible replacements for
Thomas, the Associated Press re
ported yesterday.
De√üartolo, who expressed keen
disappointment with the 49er per
formance of the paSt season when he
released Thomas yesterday, said,
"What concerns rne every bit as
much as our record is the fact that
our image and stature in the com
munity has suffered."
Walsh, credited by many with per
forming miracles during his short te
nure at Stanford, will need the wis
dom of Solomon, the sleight of hand
of Houdini and the luck of the Irish to
make immediate contenders of the
49ers. Forty-Niner Faithfuls are hop
ing they won't need the patience of
Job. After three decades in the NFL,
the 49ers have yet to bring home a
league championship.
