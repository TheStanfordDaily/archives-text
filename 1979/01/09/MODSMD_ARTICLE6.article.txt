# Biological discovery made at Med Center

### BRAD BROCKBANK 
Using the recently-discovered
technique of recombinant DNA, re
searchers at the Medical Center have
achieved the first biological expres
sion of mammalian genes in bacterial
cells, and have taken another step
toward the mass production of hor
mones.
Early last month, the group of sci
entists, led by Genetics Prof. Stanley
Cohen and Biological Sciences Prof.
Robert Schimke, successfully in
duced clones of E. Coli bacteria to
synthesize the mammalian enzyme
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).
According to a release issued by
the Med Center, the transfer of
genes from higher organisms to bac
teria has been possible for several
years using recombinant DNA
techniques, but this was the first time
a biologically active protein was pro
duced in bacteria by transferred
mammalian genes.
The technique of recombination,
discovered in 1973 by Cohen and
others, involves the use of an en
zyme which splits a cellular molecule

called messenger RNA (mRNA) at a
specific site. The selected,
mammalian-derived mRNA, which
codes forthe desired protein, is then
spliced back onto the bacterial sequ
ence by another enzyme.
Using this new, altered strand of
mRNA, a complementary strand of
DNA is produced, which is in turn
injected into the bacterial cell where
it initiates the process of protein
synthesis. As the bacteria reproduce,
relatively large amounts of the pro
tein are synthesized by the clone
"bacterial factories."
'Hybrid' proteins
Before last month's achievement,
previous research had resulted in the
production of "hybrid" proteins,
molecules which contained
bacterially-derived as well as mam
malian sequences.
According to the release, the pro
duction of this biologically active and
functional protein (DHFR) was a mat
ter of having the correct DNA sequ
ences which allow production of a
separate, rather than a hybrid, pro-
