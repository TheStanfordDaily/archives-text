# Mullahs: influential Moslem clergymen
## 
### 
Qom, Iran (AP) — This holy
city tucked in central Iran bears
little resemblance these days
to a community imbued with
love and peace.
It is a city marred by almost
daily brutality — part of the
widening bloody unrest
against Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi's rule.
Qom's 300,000 residents live
under the shadow of the grand
iose religious shrine of Hazrat
Masoumeh, named after the
sister of a deceased spiritual
leader of Iran's 32 million Shiite
Moslems. The city, about 80
miles south of Tehran, is fam
ous for its theological schools
where 10,000 students aspire to
be mullahs or Moslem clergy
men.
Qom was once a famous
oasis on the edge of a creeping
dry, brown earth desert, and it
was known at one time for its
high grade production of silk
carpets. Today, because many
of the Moslem faithful want to
be buried near its holy shrine,
Iranians quip that Qom now

imports corpses and exports
mullahs.
It has also become one of the
foremost arenas of anti-shah
unrest stemming from the de
mands of the Shiite Moslem
leaders.
The mullahs neither com
mand an army or hold public
office, but their influence and
power is undisputed. At their
subtle calling, crowds surge
through the center of town and
the dirt alleys of the bazaar,
taunting armed troops in
never-ending chants against
the shah. The chant of "death
to the shah" reverberates from
one end of the commercial dis
trict to the next.
Troops have been stationed
in Qom since serious out
breaks of anti-shah violence
erupted in September. The
mullahs in their heavy, flow
ing, brown wool robes and
turbans of white or black have
been spotted on the fringes of
mobs swirling through the
bazaar.
About 40 persons in Qom

have lost their lives in clashes
against nervous armed troops
since September. More than
100 have been wounded by
clubs and bullets. The mullahs,
in conversations in the narrow
alleyways of this city, say their
struggle against the shah will
continue "at all costs."
The younger mullahs who
inundate Qom, seeking to
build reputations as teachers
and scholars among the willing
masses, tend to be more milit
ant. But moderate voices are
also heard — one of them be
longing to Ayatullah Shariet
madari, one of six living mar
jataqlids or patriarchs of the
Shiite sect.
The white-bearded, 76-
year-old expert on Shiite law
has never issued calls against
the shah, but neither has he
voiced his approval.
"The shah has never re
ceived our blessing to reign,"
says Sharietmadari. "Accord
ing to the holy Shiite law, new
rulers of this nation must first
receive our approval. He has

never done this."
Tugging at his black robe
over a light grey flannel under
garment, Sharietmadari inter
rupted his conversation long
enough to offer some words of
advice to a follower who en
tered unannounced. He main
tained a serious appearance as
he perused a legal document
handed to him by a poor man
who slipped him some money
for his trouble.
In the Moslem clergymen's
world, the faithful are obliged
to give 20 percent of their in
come to support the clergy.
The clergy, totally dependent
on their followers for support,
retain only one-third of their
income, giving the rest to the
poor or to worthy causes.
Religious teachers say suc
cessful mullahs with large fol
lowings are usually clever
amateur psychologists with the
ability to sway the devout.
"Mullahs are experts at feel
ing the prevailing mood of the
people, rich, poor, educated
or illiterate. They tell the
people what they want to hear
and what the masses are hear
ing today at most of the ser
mons in the mosques is anti
shah," a religious teacher said.
In an apparent effort to stop
the bloodshed, Sharietmadari
issued an edict commanding
the soldiers to stop shooting
their countrymen. He claims
his message got through "be
cause there was a noticeable
drop in demonstrators shot by
soldiers over the high religious
mourning period last week."
However, the shooting and
killinggoon in Qomas in order
areas of Iran, with no end in
sight. One young mullah put it
this way: "Only a miracle com
promise" with the shah will
end the brutality in this cityand
elsewhere — "or the end of the
Pahlavi dynasty."

In the Moslem clergymen's
world, the faithful are obliged
to give 20 percent of their in

The clergy, totally dependent
on their followers for support,
retain only one-third of their
income, giving the rest to the
poor or to worthy causes.

ability to sway the devout.

people, rich, poor, educated

people what they want to hear

shah," a religious teacher said.
In an apparent effort to stop
the bloodshed, Sharietmadari
issued an edict commanding
the soldiers to stop shooting
their countrymen. He claims
his message got through "be

mourning period last week."

areas of Iran, with no end in

this way: "Only a miracle com

end the brutality in this cityand
elsewhere — "or the end of the
Pahlavi dynasty."
Qom, Iran (AP) — This holy
city tucked in central Iran bears
little resemblance these days
to a community imbued with
love and peace.
It is a city marred by almost
daily brutality — part of the
widening bloody unrest
against Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi's rule.
Qom's 300,000 residents live
under the shadow of the grand
iose religious shrine of Hazrat
Masoumeh, named after the
sister of a deceased spiritual
leader of Iran's 32 million Shiite
Moslems. The city, about 80
miles south of Tehran, is fam
ous for its theological schools
where 10,000 students aspire to
be mullahs or Moslem clergy
men.
Qom was once a famous
oasis on the edge of a creeping
dry, brown earth desert, and it
was known at one time for its
high grade production of silk
carpets. Today, because many
of the Moslem faithful want to
be buried near its holy shrine,
Iranians quip that Qom now

imports corpses and exports
mullahs.
It has also become one of the
foremost arenas of anti-shah
unrest stemming from the de
mands of the Shiite Moslem
leaders.
The mullahs neither com
mand an army or hold public
office, but their influence and
power is undisputed. At their
subtle calling, crowds surge
through the center of town and
the dirt alleys of the bazaar,
taunting armed troops in
never-ending chants against
the shah. The chant of "death
to the shah" reverberates from
one end of the commercial dis
trict to the next.
Troops have been stationed
in Qom since serious out
breaks of anti-shah violence
erupted in September. The
mullahs in their heavy, flow
ing, brown wool robes and
turbans of white or black have
been spotted on the fringes of
mobs swirling through the
bazaar.
About 40 persons in Qom

have lost their lives in clashes
against nervous armed troops
since September. More than
100 have been wounded by
clubs and bullets. The mullahs,
in conversations in the narrow
alleyways of this city, say their
struggle against the shah will
continue "at all costs."
The younger mullahs who
inundate Qom, seeking to
build reputations as teachers
and scholars among the willing
masses, tend to be more milit
ant. But moderate voices are
also heard — one of them be
longing to Ayatullah Shariet
madari, one of six living mar
jataqlids or patriarchs of the
Shiite sect.
The white-bearded, 76-
year-old expert on Shiite law
has never issued calls against
the shah, but neither has he
voiced his approval.
"The shah has never re
ceived our blessing to reign,"
says Sharietmadari. "Accord
ing to the holy Shiite law, new
rulers of this nation must first
receive our approval. He has

never done this."
Tugging at his black robe
over a light grey flannel under
garment, Sharietmadari inter
rupted his conversation long
enough to offer some words of
advice to a follower who en
tered unannounced. He main
tained a serious appearance as
he perused a legal document
handed to him by a poor man
who slipped him some money
for his trouble.
