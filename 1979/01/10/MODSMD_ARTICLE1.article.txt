# 49ers score with Walsh
## Dowhower new coach here 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Athletic Director Andy Ceiger
made it official yesterday: Rod
Dowhower has replaced Bill Walsh as
the University's head football coach.
Walsh, who resigned Monday, was
named head coach of the San Fran
cisco 49ers yesterday afternoon.
Forthe 35-year-old Dowhower, the
Cards' receiving and quarterback
coach for the past two seasons, the
appointment is his first head coach
ing job.
"As an old quarterback, I guess
you relish this kind of attention,"
Dowhower said after being intro
duced by Ceiger. "I look forward to
the continued resurgence of the
Stanford football program."
It is a resurgence which began little
more than two years ago when
then-Athletic Director |oe Ruetz an
nounced the hiring of Walsh. Walsh
returned to the NFL yesterday after
guiding the Cardinals to a 17-7 mark
and two bowl triumphs.
"In his two outstanding years at
Stanford, plus a highly successful
tour of duty in the National Football
League as an assistant for 10 years,
Bill Walsh has proven that he is ready
to become a head coach in the NFL,"
49ers owner Eddie Deßartolo Jr. said
at a press conference yesterday.
"A lot of teams would like to be
making the announcement that we
are making right now — I'm pleased
that we have been able to land a man
with his stature and credentials," he
added.
The bait used to land Walsh, ac
cording to a Palo Alto Times report, is
a salary estimated to be as much as
$200,000 per year.
"I am pleased to have this oppor
tunity afforded me by Ed Deßartolo
and I am particularly happy to stay in
the Bay Area," Walsh said at the press
conference. "I know that there is
some raw, young talent on the 49ers
team and I look forward to the chal

lenge of building a winner."
If Walsh builds as successfully at
San Francisco as he did here, the
49ers could certainly turn around
what has been a dismal outlook for
the past two years.
Ernie Accorsi, assistant general
manager of the Baltimore Colts of the
National Football League, said he has
been offered the position of general
manager for the San Francisco 49ers.
Accorsi, who moved here two
years ago from a high position in the
NFL commissioner's office, said he
has not made a decision on the offer.
"I have talked with Eddie Deßar
tolo, but I have not accepted or re
jected the offer," Accorsi said.
Deßartolo, the 49ers owner,
"suggested I think it over and then
we would meet with his new coach,
Bill Walsh, around Super Bowl time
in Miami."

"I would be remiss totally if I did
not acknowledge his (Walsh's) tre
mendous accomplishments on be
half of the University — the integrity,
the level of excitement and the gen
eral excellence he has brought to
Stanford University football," Ceiger
said.
Ceiger said that because the Athle
tic Department has been aware for
some time of the attractiveness of
Walsh as an NFL coach, the depart
ment since last year has done a con
tinuing search and evaluation job to
determine who would be the best
replacement if Walsh left.
"We are very confident," Ceiger
said. "We have searched thoroughly
and are confident we have come up
with a marvelous choice to succeed
Bill Walsh."
Ceiger said he talked with
Dowhower last week and told him

that if Walsh left, he would be named
Stanford's head coach.
Dowhower said he expects the rest
of the coaching staff to remain intact.
He also said that he, working with
Geiger, will move quickly to find a
new receiving coach. He said he will
continue to coach the quarterbacks.
"As far as immediate priorities are
concerned, recruiting is
paramount," Dowhower said. "The
swiftness with which the whole situa
tion has been handled will allow us to
continue without skipping a beat."
Dowhower said that the head
coaching position had been on his
mind for some time. Last year, when
it appeared Walsh would go to the
Rams, Dowhower was mentioned as
a possible successor.
Asked how long it took him to ac
cept the position, he replied, "It
didn't take me but a second."
