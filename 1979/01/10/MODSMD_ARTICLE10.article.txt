# 'Brainwashing' proposed
## Prof, suggests new defense plea 
### 
Minneapolis (AP) — Brainwashing should
be a legal defense plea available to defen
dants, such as Patricia Hearst, who are ac
cused of criminal acts, says an article in the
Minnesota Law Review.
Richard Delgado, visiting professor of law
at the University of California-Los Angeles,
wrote in the article that brainwashing as a
defense plea should be as available as a plea
of insanity.
Delgado outlined a proposed "coercive
persuasion" or "thought reform" defense in
the article published last week.
The legal concept involved in the plea
would be similar to that used by some
California courts, which have allowed a de
fense of hypnosis if the mental responsibility
for a crime belongs to someone other than
the person who physically acts it out.
'Coercive persuasion'
Delgado used the "coercive persuasion"
and "thought reform" terms to describe an
indoctrination process which begins with a
person being kidnapped and forced to aban
don political, religious or social beliefs.
Hearst, daughter of millionaire publisher
Randolph Hearst, was kidnapped in 1974 and
eventually convicted of armed robbery as a
participant in escapades of the Symbionese
Liberation Army.
Delgado proposed a defense theory that
could be used in appeals of the Hearst case.

The lack of a new theory to cover the case, he
said, could mean "denying a defense to a
class of defendants who are, by ordinary
moral intuitions, often more victims than
perpetrators."
Religious cults
He wrote that thought reform processes
are used by many religious cults but the
"coercive persuasion" defense would apply
only in cases in which an individual was ini
tially forced to join the group which came to
dominate him.
Delgado wrote that the brainwashing pro
cess is different from hypnosis and that the
state of mind which results from it cannot
legally be classified as insanity.
"The victim of brainwashing, by contrast,
acts voluntarily and is usually aware of the
wrongfulness of his acts," Delgado wrote.
Abnormal influences
Among conditions which could result in
coercive persuasion, he wrote, are such un
usual or abnormal influences as drugs, hyp
nosis, prolonged confinement, physiological
depletion and deliberate manipulation of
guilt, terror and anxiety.
Delgado, who is teaching at UCLA this
year, has a regular appointment as associate
professor of*'law at the University of
Washington.
