# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Time for fairness 
### 
The ASSU Senate is headed on the
wrong track after a promising fall
quarter. With the failure of the CRAP
motion, there was great promise that
this year's senate would be a respon
sible and deliberative body.
But its recent condemnation of the
Medical Center's so-called "double
billing" practices was definitely a step
in the wong direction. That action
could pave the way for a loss of stu
dent and faculty respect for this year's
senate.
Although indications are that gen
eral deficiencies exist at the Medical
Center, and although the Daily cer
tainly has strong reservations about
some practices there, the senate con
sidered itself wise enough to con
demn the center after only listening
to one of its leading critics, Dr.
Eugene Dong, professor of car
diovascular surgery here.
If the senate is to be a fair body,
which it certainly must be if it is to
truly represent Stanford students, it
should listen to both sides of an issue.
This includes hearing the views of
Medical Center administrators.
Senators Erik Thompson and Geoff
Baskir said at last week's meeting that
they had invited a spokesman from
the Medical Center administration to

argue their side of the case before the
senate. Though no spokesman
showed up, that does not open the
door to a condemnation action by the
senate.
The crowning blow was that the se
nate also passed a resolution inviting a
member of the Medical Center's ad
ministration to present its viewpoint
to the senate at a future meeting.
What purpose will that serve when the
administrators already know they
have been condemned?
And if by some chance these ad
ministrators came to a meeting and
convinced the senate its condemna
tion was in error, then the senate
would be in the same sorry state it was
during the Bhutto affair â€” having to
reject its earlier position and look
foolish in the process.
Although the senate has made
strides forward this year with a
stronger committee system, it is walk
ing on very thin ice if it pretends to be
a "know it all" after listening to only
one side of an issue.
Next time the intelligent senate ac
tion is to be fairer in the gathering of
information. Otherwise student re
spect, which the senate so desper
ately needs, will be lost.
