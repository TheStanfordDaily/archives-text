## Root issue in Mideast 
### 
The attention given by the
media to the Egyptian-Israeli
negotiations in recent months
has obscured the fact that the
root problem of the Mideast
lies in the conflict between Is
rael and the Palestinians.
Until the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is successfully resol
ved, there will not be a lasting
peace in the Mideast.
This central problem of the
Mideast is caused by the virus
of perverted nationalism. Con
cepts such as "the Jewish
homeland" or "a Palestinian
homeland'' rest on the Wilso
nian idea that political and
ethnic boundaries should
coincide, that the nation-state
should serve as the tool of a
particular ethnic group.
On a planet inhabited by a
wide variety of peoples widely
intermixed and intermingled,
this belief that each territory
should be the monopoly of a
particular ethnic group is a
prescription for inhumanity,
oppression and war. Such has
been the fate of the Mideast.
Four decades ago, the infec
tion of Germany by the ideal of
the Volkstaat led to Hitler's in
vasion of Austria, Czechos
lovakia and Poland and. ulti
mately, to the Second World
War. While Hitler was de
feated, his central idea that the
Volk and the state should coin
cide still lingers on in the
Mideast.
Only when this idea of the
ethnic state is abandoned by
both Jews and Arabs will a last
ing peace in the Mideast be
come possible. The current fix
ation on the collective rights
of the Jewish or the Palestinian
nation r lust be replaced by a
concern for the human rights
of individual Palestinians and
Jews. All involved parties must
come to realize that a just gov
ernment must be neutral not
only between competing relig
ions but also between different
ethnic groups, cultures and
ways of life.
In particular, both justice
and realism demand that the
state of Israel as presently con
stituted — i.e., as the Jewish
homeland and as a Jewish state
— must cease to exist.
Specifically:
1) Israel must return all sto
len property and land to its
rightful Arab owners, and all
refugees who have fled Pales
tine must be allowed to freely
return.
2) Civil liberties must be ex
tended to all inhabitants of Is
rael whatever their race, creed,
ethnic group or national ori
gin. The arbitrary and caprici
ous military government of oc
cupied areas must be replaced
by the objective and impartial
rule of law.
3) Laws and state institu
tions favoring Jews or Judaism
— the establishment of the Or
thodox Rabbinate, the favoring
of Jews in immigration, laws
enforcing the Jewish Sabbath,
etc. — must be abolished.

4) Finally, those symbols
which identify the current re
gime as Jewish — the name Is
rael, the establishment of Heb
rew as the official language,
the star of David in the Israeli
flag, etc. — should be re
placed.
Until such reforms are inau
gurated by the Israeli govern
ment, the government and
people of the United States
should abstain from all support
of the state of Israel.
Neithera foolish belief in the
myths of the Old Testament
nor an honest respect for the
courage and industry of the Is
raeli people should be allowed
to distort our judgments of the
policies of the Israeli govern
ment.
To criticize the state of Israel
is not to suggest that it is as
oppressive as many of the
world's governments: the
obscenity of Uganda's or the
Soviet Union's condemning Is
rael is obvious to any honest
observer. Nor does criticism of
Israel imply approval of Arab
terrorism. Nonetheless, the
governance of Palestine by a
government explicitly commit
ted to Jewish supremacy is the
most serious obstacle to peace
in the Mideast.
A call for the disestablish
ment of the Jewish state is not,
of course, a call for the expul
sion of the Jews from Palestine.
Both Jews and Arabs (as well as
Christians, Hindus, Buddhists,
etc.) should be free to live
peacefully in Palestine or, for
that matter, anywhere else.
If it is claimed that the dises

tablishment of the Jewish state
is an impractical dream, it must
be replied that then a stable
and lasting peace in the
Mideast is an impractical
dream. Indeed, as Palestinian
and Arab strength increases
over time, Israel's position will
become increasingly precari
ous. Only by excising the root
of the Mideast conflict by dis
establishing the state of Israel,
can the Israeli Jews be saved
from annihilation.
The only just or practical sol
ution to the Mideast conflict
lies not in summitry or shuttle
diplomacy but in the rigorous
separation of ethnicity and
state. Until that principle is im
plemented, there will not be a
permanent peace in the
Mideast.

ethnic groups, cultures and
ways of life.
In particular, both justice
and realism demand that the
state of Israel as presently con
stituted — i.e., as the Jewish
homeland and as a Jewish state
— must cease to exist.
Specifically:
1) Israel must return all sto
len property and land to its
rightful Arab owners, and all
refugees who have fled Pales
tine must be allowed to freely
return.
2) Civil liberties must be ex
tended to all inhabitants of Is
rael whatever their race, creed,
ethnic group or national ori
gin. The arbitrary and caprici
ous military government of oc
cupied areas must be replaced
by the objective and impartial
rule of law.
3) Laws and state institu
tions favoring Jews or Judaism
— the establishment of the Or
thodox Rabbinate, the favoring
of Jews in immigration, laws
enforcing the Jewish Sabbath,
etc. — must be abolished.

4) Finally, those symbols
which identify the current re
gime as Jewish — the name Is
rael, the establishment of Heb
rew as the official language,
the star of David in the Israeli
flag, etc. — should be re
placed.
Until such reforms are inau
gurated by the Israeli govern
ment, the government and
people of the United States
should abstain from all support
of the state of Israel.
Neithera foolish belief in the
myths of the Old Testament
nor an honest respect for the
courage and industry of the Is
raeli people should be allowed
to distort our judgments of the
policies of the Israeli govern
ment.
To criticize the state of Israel
is not to suggest that it is as
oppressive as many of the
world's governments: the
obscenity of Uganda's or the
Soviet Union's condemning Is
rael is obvious to any honest
observer. Nor does criticism of
Israel imply approval of Arab
terrorism. Nonetheless, the
governance of Palestine by a
government explicitly commit
ted to Jewish supremacy is the
most serious obstacle to peace
in the Mideast.
A call for the disestablish
ment of the Jewish state is not,
of course, a call for the expul
sion of the Jews from Palestine.
Both Jews and Arabs (as well as
Christians, Hindus, Buddhists,
etc.) should be free to live
peacefully in Palestine or, for
that matter, anywhere else.
If it is claimed that the dises

tablishment of the Jewish state
is an impractical dream, it must
be replied that then a stable
and lasting peace in the
Mideast is an impractical
dream. Indeed, as Palestinian
and Arab strength increases
over time, Israel's position will
become increasingly precari
ous. Only by excising the root
of the Mideast conflict by dis
establishing the state of Israel,
can the Israeli Jews be saved
from annihilation.
The only just or practical sol
ution to the Mideast conflict
lies not in summitry or shuttle
diplomacy but in the rigorous
separation of ethnicity and
state. Until that principle is im
plemented, there will not be a
permanent peace in the
Mideast.

The attention given by the
media to the Egyptian-Israeli
negotiations in recent months
has obscured the fact that the
root problem of the Mideast
lies in the conflict between Is
rael and the Palestinians.
Until the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is successfully resol
ved, there will not be a lasting
peace in the Mideast.
This central problem of the
Mideast is caused by the virus
of perverted nationalism. Con
cepts such as "the Jewish
homeland" or "a Palestinian
homeland'' rest on the Wilso
nian idea that political and
ethnic boundaries should
coincide, that the nation-state
should serve as the tool of a
particular ethnic group.
On a planet inhabited by a
wide variety of peoples widely
intermixed and intermingled,
this belief that each territory
should be the monopoly of a
particular ethnic group is a
prescription for inhumanity,
oppression and war. Such has
been the fate of the Mideast.
Four decades ago, the infec
tion of Germany by the ideal of
the Volkstaat led to Hitler's in
vasion of Austria, Czechos
lovakia and Poland and. ulti
mately, to the Second World
War. While Hitler was de
feated, his central idea that the
Volk and the state should coin
cide still lingers on in the
Mideast.
Only when this idea of the
ethnic state is abandoned by
both Jews and Arabs will a last
ing peace in the Mideast be
come possible. The current fix
ation on the collective rights
of the Jewish or the Palestinian
nation r lust be replaced by a
concern for the human rights
of individual Palestinians and
Jews. All involved parties must
come to realize that a just gov
ernment must be neutral not
only between competing relig
ions but also between different
ethnic groups, cultures and
ways of life.
