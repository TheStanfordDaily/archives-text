## Regulation without government 
### 
In his recent column (Daily, )an. 5) David
Steuer defended the Consumer Product
Safety Commission's (CPSC) role in reg
ulating small children's toys. He argued
that, because parents cannot be safety ex
perts, capitalists can con them into buying
hazardous toys. He concludes that CPSC
regulation is necessary to save children's
lives.
While the unscrupulous producer is a
real problem, Steuer's conclusion is a
myth perpetuated by various regulatory
agencies and academic institutions. There
are two superior solutions — warranties
and approval labels — neither of which
requires any legal apparatus beyond a
court system.
Imagine what would happen if all "con
sumer protection" agencies suddenly dis
appeared (e.g. CPCS, FTC, FDA, USDA).
With them would go the still widespread
illusion that everything we have been eat
ing, drinking and using is automatically
wholesome and safe because the govern
ment has not objected to it. Consumers
would become more suspicious, cautious
and picky. Manufacturers who were con
fident that their products were safe would
warrant them so in order to attract more
business.
Legally, this would mean that they could
be brought to court for large financial
damages if the product turned out to be
otherwise. Consumes would come to

demand such warranties. Parents who
gave unwarranted toys to babies might
also be held liable by the courts. Thus
many unsafe products lacking in redeem
ing qualities would be forced off the mar
ket — not by bureaucratic diligence but by
the more reliable force of self-interest.
Another way for producers to restore
consumer confidence would be to have
their products inspected by a reputable
independent research company. If the re
search company was satisfied that the
product was up to its own advertised stan
dards, it would give the product its 'seal of
approval,' which consumers could look
for. The cost of the research could be re
covered by charging for the seal. A re
search company would have an adequate
incentive to be honest since a tarnished
reputation could destroy its reputation
and since it could be prosecuted for fraud.
The reader might find these scenarios
farfetched. But which processes are more
worthy of our trust — those that deliver
our mail and decided that Vietnam was a
good idea or those that have supplied us
with stereos?
Steuer comments, "of course, dumping
on government is fast becoming the na
tional pastime." Of course. Government is
more and more being seen for what it is —
prone to nonsense and destructive to
nearly everyone. 112

"Okay," the reader might say, "if war
ranties and approval labels are so great,
why have we gotten regulatory bodies in
stead?" First, distrust of the market due to
nineteenth century policy which favored
industrialization over people's legitimate
rights (e.g. corporate and tort law). Sec
ondly, publicity hungry politicians can in
troduce bills in Congress quicker than en
trepreneurs can work out more sensible
solutions on a voluntary basis.
Thirdly, it is cheaper for industry to have
taxpayers foot part of the cost of screening
out unsafe products. Fourthly, there is a
better chance that producers can control a
government regulatory body than the
'market for safety' (e.g. USDA). Finally,
our state monopoly judicial system can not
be expected to be particularly responsive
to change. (The reader can probably sup
ply still more reasons.)
It would be unfortunate if humans had
to make tough tradeoffs between free
dom, justice and well-being. Fortunately,
this is not the case. In the absence of force
or fraud, people are amazingly capable of
"working things out." Steuer's liberal
democracy was an improvement over
kings; but as the populace becomes more
aware, history will be ready to shed even
this political skin.

and since it could be prosecuted for fraud.
The reader might find these scenarios
farfetched. But which processes are more
worthy of our trust — those that deliver
our mail and decided that Vietnam was a
good idea or those that have supplied us
with stereos?
Steuer comments, "of course, dumping
on government is fast becoming the na
tional pastime." Of course. Government is
more and more being seen for what it is —
prone to nonsense and destructive to
nearly everyone. 112

"Okay," the reader might say, "if war
ranties and approval labels are so great,
why have we gotten regulatory bodies in
stead?" First, distrust of the market due to
nineteenth century policy which favored
industrialization over people's legitimate
rights (e.g. corporate and tort law). Sec
ondly, publicity hungry politicians can in
troduce bills in Congress quicker than en
trepreneurs can work out more sensible
solutions on a voluntary basis.
Thirdly, it is cheaper for industry to have
taxpayers foot part of the cost of screening
out unsafe products. Fourthly, there is a
better chance that producers can control a
government regulatory body than the
'market for safety' (e.g. USDA). Finally,
our state monopoly judicial system can not
be expected to be particularly responsive
to change. (The reader can probably sup
ply still more reasons.)
It would be unfortunate if humans had
to make tough tradeoffs between free
dom, justice and well-being. Fortunately,
this is not the case. In the absence of force
or fraud, people are amazingly capable of
"working things out." Steuer's liberal
democracy was an improvement over
kings; but as the populace becomes more
aware, history will be ready to shed even
this political skin.
