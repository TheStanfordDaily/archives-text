## Rut of apathy, shallowness 
### 
New Year's Day has come and gone, and
we move further into 1979. Columnists
often take advantage of a rather trite cus
tom at this time of the year. In our attempt
to view what our society is and what it
should be, we use New Year resolutions to
convey ouranalyses. Banal as it might be, I
will offer up my New Year resolution as I
hope it might be added to the resolutions
that other members of the Stanford com
munity have compiled.
The "apathetic'' seventies are coming to
a close; or at least I hope that the apathy
might end with the arrival of a new decade.
Obviously, the eighties will be nodifferent
than the seventies if people will not allow
themselves to change. I believe that our
world is constantly changing in a dynamic
manner. Much of this change is beyond
the control of individuals.
However, ultimately it is human beings
— as individuals and as social groups —
who initiate and participate in reform and
revolution. I would contend that men,
women and children in our country would
contribute to the eradication of apathy in
our society if they could begin to rise
above the specific circumstances of their
individual lives, and if they could begin to
look at the world in a more comprehensive
view. We might pay more attention to the
connections between different events in
different places; and we might focus an
eye toward viewing society as made up of
different people with different experi
ences, as well as one with people who
share common experiences.
In this context a very vivid image comes
to my mind. When people race horses
they often put blinders on the animals.
This restricts the vision of the horse to a
very narrow range — dead ahead. Al
legedly this practice helps to prevent the
animal from rearing because of distracting
sights. Further, once the beast has been
locked into the gates, and once the race
has begun, the animal fixes its sights and
runs for all it is worth. The practice seems
to work very well indeed.
I believe that many Americans are re
stricted in their vision by "blinders." Most

of us can really see no farther than our own
lives and the environment in which we
must function on a daily basis. For many
working class people who must constantly
struggle to survive, it is very difficult to see
beyond where they will find their next job
or how they might feed themselves and
their children.
The basic conditions of these people's
lives have, up until now, precluded them
from broadening and expanding their
world view. At the same time, however, it
may be that these basic struggles will be
the catalyst that expedites changes in
these peoples conceptions of the world.
For no matter how restricted an individual
might be in his or her focus, simultaneous
unemployment, inflation and recession
will probably change many peoples at
titudes. Apathy can no longer suffice.
At Stanford, most of us do not have to
worry about where our next meal will
come from. And yet, I fear that many of us
cannot remove the blinders that narrow
our sight. Are we lazy and arrogant, or are
we driven by our relentless pursuit of a
profession? )ust as working class people
"entered the gate" and were off and run
ning to the factories or offices, some of us
have aimed ourselves at the corporate
suite or the doctor's office with a potted
rhododendron in the waiting room.
Surely we consume our energies with
anxiety over our personal lives and what
not. However, many of us do not question
what we are doing at Stanford, what we
purport to accomplish when we leave
here, and what affect our actions have on
others. We need to begin to answer some
of these questions if we are to remove our
blinders — if we are to become more
complete human beings.
Let us look at a concrete example of a
group of people who have begun to re
move their blinders. Women in the late
'60s and the early 70s have come together
in their kitchens, in consciousness raising
groups, in small political caucuses, and in
large national organizations.
These women have discovered that

many of their experiences were not just
personal idiosyncratic events. Rather, they
found their lives to be bound by common
ordeals that resulted from the oppression
of women in our society. Women have
seen the commonality of their lives.
Further, once they were joined together
in their struggle, women began to see the
variability of people. Among themselves
they recognized third world women,
single women, married women, lesbians,
working class women and middle class
women — all with different lifestyles and
different needs, yet they shared a com
mon struggle.
With their blinders at least partially re
moved, women have "reared" so to
speak. New goals and expectations are the
banners that the women's movement has
raised. In fact, most political and social
analysts would have to agree that the wo
men's movement has been one of the
most significant perpetrators of social
change in the United States during the
otherwise staid 19705.
Certainly the women's movement has
not caused every woman in America to
jump on the band wagon for social
change. Further, women in the women's
movement have had to grapple with class
and race biases that, in essence, "blinded"
the movement to the plight of many wo
men. I do not espouse the naive ideal that;
change is easy or fast. However, as stu
dents or academics, members of the Stan-!
ford community should have the ability
and the responsibility to transcend some
of the boundaries of our individual lives.
We can contribute to a renewed vigor in
American society in the 1980s.
At this new year, we must resolve to
question ourselves about our conceptions
of the world. We must pull ourselves out
of the rut of apathy and shallowness that
has characterized the 19705. I resolve to do
everything that I c an to shuck the blinders
that narrow my vision. I hope that you will
join me.

to work very well indeed.
I believe that many Americans are re
stricted in their vision by "blinders." Most

of us can really see no farther than our own
lives and the environment in which we
must function on a daily basis. For many
working class people who must constantly
struggle to survive, it is very difficult to see
beyond where they will find their next job
or how they might feed themselves and
their children.
The basic conditions of these people's
lives have, up until now, precluded them
from broadening and expanding their
world view. At the same time, however, it
may be that these basic struggles will be
the catalyst that expedites changes in
these peoples conceptions of the world.
For no matter how restricted an individual
might be in his or her focus, simultaneous
unemployment, inflation and recession
will probably change many peoples at
titudes. Apathy can no longer suffice.
At Stanford, most of us do not have to
worry about where our next meal will
come from. And yet, I fear that many of us
cannot remove the blinders that narrow
our sight. Are we lazy and arrogant, or are
we driven by our relentless pursuit of a
profession? )ust as working class people
"entered the gate" and were off and run
ning to the factories or offices, some of us
have aimed ourselves at the corporate
suite or the doctor's office with a potted
rhododendron in the waiting room.
Surely we consume our energies with
anxiety over our personal lives and what
not. However, many of us do not question
what we are doing at Stanford, what we
purport to accomplish when we leave
here, and what affect our actions have on
others. We need to begin to answer some
of these questions if we are to remove our
blinders — if we are to become more
complete human beings.
Let us look at a concrete example of a
group of people who have begun to re
move their blinders. Women in the late
'60s and the early 70s have come together
in their kitchens, in consciousness raising
groups, in small political caucuses, and in
large national organizations.
These women have discovered that

many of their experiences were not just
personal idiosyncratic events. Rather, they
found their lives to be bound by common
ordeals that resulted from the oppression
of women in our society. Women have
seen the commonality of their lives.
Further, once they were joined together
in their struggle, women began to see the
variability of people. Among themselves
they recognized third world women,
single women, married women, lesbians,
working class women and middle class
women — all with different lifestyles and
different needs, yet they shared a com
mon struggle.
With their blinders at least partially re
moved, women have "reared" so to
speak. New goals and expectations are the
banners that the women's movement has
raised. In fact, most political and social
analysts would have to agree that the wo
men's movement has been one of the
most significant perpetrators of social
change in the United States during the
otherwise staid 19705.
Certainly the women's movement has
not caused every woman in America to
jump on the band wagon for social
change. Further, women in the women's
movement have had to grapple with class
and race biases that, in essence, "blinded"
the movement to the plight of many wo
men. I do not espouse the naive ideal that;
change is easy or fast. However, as stu
dents or academics, members of the Stan-!
ford community should have the ability
and the responsibility to transcend some
of the boundaries of our individual lives.
We can contribute to a renewed vigor in
American society in the 1980s.
At this new year, we must resolve to
question ourselves about our conceptions
of the world. We must pull ourselves out
of the rut of apathy and shallowness that
has characterized the 19705. I resolve to do
everything that I c an to shuck the blinders
that narrow my vision. I hope that you will
join me.

New Year's Day has come and gone, and
we move further into 1979. Columnists
often take advantage of a rather trite cus
tom at this time of the year. In our attempt
to view what our society is and what it
should be, we use New Year resolutions to
convey ouranalyses. Banal as it might be, I
will offer up my New Year resolution as I
hope it might be added to the resolutions
that other members of the Stanford com
munity have compiled.
The "apathetic'' seventies are coming to
a close; or at least I hope that the apathy
might end with the arrival of a new decade.
Obviously, the eighties will be nodifferent
than the seventies if people will not allow
themselves to change. I believe that our
world is constantly changing in a dynamic
manner. Much of this change is beyond
the control of individuals.
However, ultimately it is human beings
— as individuals and as social groups —
who initiate and participate in reform and
revolution. I would contend that men,
women and children in our country would
contribute to the eradication of apathy in
our society if they could begin to rise
above the specific circumstances of their
individual lives, and if they could begin to
look at the world in a more comprehensive
view. We might pay more attention to the
connections between different events in
different places; and we might focus an
eye toward viewing society as made up of
different people with different experi
ences, as well as one with people who
share common experiences.
In this context a very vivid image comes
to my mind. When people race horses
they often put blinders on the animals.
This restricts the vision of the horse to a
very narrow range — dead ahead. Al
legedly this practice helps to prevent the
animal from rearing because of distracting
sights. Further, once the beast has been
locked into the gates, and once the race
has begun, the animal fixes its sights and
runs for all it is worth. The practice seems
to work very well indeed.
