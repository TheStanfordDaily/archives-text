No absolute criteria
As the unnamed "critic"
mentioned in Ted Gioia's re
cord reviews that appeared in
the Daily ,Dec. 7, I would like
the opportunity to respond.
Cioia took issue with my
statement in The Real News
(Nov. 22) to the effect that
there is no demonstrable good
or bad in music.
First of all, I did not disagree
with Gioia's review of Patrice,
by Patrice Rushen, as he infer
red. I merely used a quote from
his review as an example of the
obfuscatory language critics

use. My assessment of the al
bum, as is Cioia's, is irrelevant.
Second, Gioia states that he
has played piano for 16 years
and if there is no such thing as
good or bad in music, he can
play no better today than he
could 16 years ago because
there is no such thing as better
music. Just because he has
played for 16 years does not
mean that he can play better
music now â€” it only means
that he is more proficient at
trying the piano.
If we are going to assume
that there is good music and
bad music, then we must estab

lish some criteria for what con
stitutes good and bad. I chal
lenge Gioia to produce such
criteria. If he does, we would
then be able to take all of the
music ever produced, from
Bach to Donna Summer, from
ancient hymns to Foreigner,
from the Star Spangled Banner
to Stanley Clarke and rank
them all from best to worst.
This, of course, is impossible
and even if possible would be
totally meaningless.
The intent of my article was
to address the overdepen
dence we have on the views of
critics. Many people, it seems,

will not go see a particular
movie or read a particular book
because someone like Rex
Reed cuts it down. We should
not allow our tastes to be man
ipulated like this.
