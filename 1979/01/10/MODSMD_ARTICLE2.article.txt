# Brown proposes $2 billion cut from projected budget
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) —Gov. Jerry Brown
yesterday proposed a $20.3 billion
spending plan that severely limits
welfare, education and other social
programs and cuts 5,140 jobs out of
state government.
Brown said his 1979-80 budget — a
reaction to the Proposition 13 tax re
volt— is the first in 30 years to reduce
the total number of state employees.
The document is one of the leanest
in recent state history, proposing
only a 3.5 percent overall increase
over the current year.
"The proposed budget is about $2
billion less than we projected only a
year ago and reflects the clear man
date of the voters for a leaner gov
ernment," Brown said in a message
to the State Legislature.
The budget sets aside $1.2 billion
foranother round of state income tax
cuts and $4.4 billion fora second year
of bail-out aid to local governments
which suffered massive Proposition
13 property tax losses.
Proposed cuts span the full range
of state government, from abolition
of front license plates for new cars to
elimination of the board licensing
geologists.
In a IVi-hour media briefing,
Brown said the cuts were reasonable,
and he was particularly defensive
about liberal legislators' charges that
the budget was an "orgy of cutting"
that penalizes the poor.
"The budget increase is well below
the rate of inflation and for the first
time since World War II requires an
actual decrease in the number of
state employees," the Democratic
governor said.
Total state jobs would be reduced
from the current 223,759 positions to
218,619, compared with 206,361
employees when Brown began his
first term four years ago.
"The continuation of the hiring
freeze and normal attrition will allow
us to come very close to the budget
goal without layoffs. We do not an
ticipate any large layoffs," Finance
Director Richard Silverman said of
the proposed reduction of 5,140
jobs.
Brown put an especially tight
squeeze on education, Medi-Cal and
welfare, the state's three biggest ex
penditures.
No funds are specifically budgeted
for pay raises, which are to be
negotiated with state employee
groups separate from the budget for
the first time this year. But Brown
mentioned 6 percent as a cap on
raises.
The budget also proposes a 6 per
cent cap on cost-of-living increases
for welfare recipients and 6 percent
increases on doctor fees for Medi-
Cal services.
Funds for education are even
tighter, up 3.3 percent for public
schools, 3.9 percent for the Univer
sity of California and 3.2 percent for
the state universities and colleges.
"We're putting our fiscal house in
order," Brown said, citing "the new
political chemistry following Propos
ition 13."
Two of the most controversial
budget items may be a $34 million

appropriation for Medi-Cal—
financed abortions an the proposed
6 percent cap on welfare grant in
creases for 1.45 million mothers and
children and 713,000 aged, blind and
disabled recipients.
A similar abortion appropriation
last year triggered a one-week
budget deadlock and deletion of
most abortion funds from the
budget, but a court order continued
abortion funding.
Democratic legislators have prom
ised to fight Brown for the 15.7 per
cent welfare increases required by
state law to make up for cost-of-living
raises denied in the post-Proposition
13 budget last July.
Brown said he would fight any wel
fare increase in excess of 6 percent,
and he said if the legislature does
not change the law mandating the
15.7 percent raises, the $294 million
in extra welfare costs would have to
be deducted from aid to local gov
ernment.
"It's not a cut. It's a 6 percent in
crease," Brown said. He repeated
several times that California already
has from the highest to third highest
welfare grants in the nation in diffe
rent categories.
"Are the welfare grants enough?
No. They are not enough for many
people," Brown said defensively in a
briefing with reporters. "But people
all over America are not keeping up
with inflation," he added.
"We are meeting the competi
tion...When you are No. 1 and you
continue to grant increases you are
dispatching your responsibilities,"
he said.
Other major cuts in Brown's
budget include abolition of special
school funds for driver training and
for mentally gifted children and abol
ition or severe cutbacks in 23 profes
sional licensing boards.
Among those no longer needing
state licenses would be real estate
salespersons, new and used car
dealers and geologists.
Another proposed cutback saving
$325,950 next year would give
motorists registering new vehicles
just one license plate for the back of
their cars instead of the current pair
for front and back.
The budget also rolls back previ
ously approved major increases in
the state's Early Childhood Education
program and denies cost-of-living
raises for so-called "categorical aid"
programs for public schools such as
bilingual education, hot lunches and
some programs for the educationally
disadvantaged.
State spending for construction of
new buildings and roads is also cut
from $682 million in the current year
to $466 million next year, with the
biggest cut, $107 million, in funds for
new freeways and expressways.
New programs are also tightly li
mited.
Brown set aside $100 million for a
still-to-be defined program to help
low and moderate income families
buy homes, and he requested $100
million for new state prisons f0r2,400
inmates.
