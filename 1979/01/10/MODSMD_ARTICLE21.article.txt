# Russians laughing at Chinese jokes

Moscow (AP) — Russians
are laughing at some
newly-minted China jokes.
But peeping out from under
the humor is Soviet concern
at what the new
Washington-Peking rela
tionships may portend.
One story has President
)immy Carter chatting amic
ably on the hot line with
Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev.
"Guess what," says Car
ter. "We've got a new com
puter that tells the future.
We won't sell it to you, of
course, but if you want, you
can ask it some questions."
Soviet harvest
The computer answers
Brezhnev's questions about
the Soviet harvest and for
steel production in 1990.
"And who's going to be in
the politburo then?" asks
Brezhnev.
After a pause, Carter
answers, "I'm sorry Leonid,

I can't read it. All the names
are written in Chinese."
Bottle of vodka
Another joke begins with
the question: "How much is
a bottle of vodka going to
cost in 1990?"
The answer is not in ru
bles or kopeks but, "five
yuan" — the currency of
China.
The jokes express the un
derlying edginess raised by
China's establishment of
diplomatic relations with
the United States and its
foreign policy initiatives in
Eastern Europe and the
West.
Small talk
These developments
have been widely pub
licized here, and more and
more Westerners tell of taxi
drivers, restaurant patrons
and housemaids engaging
them in small talk and ask
ing "what about China?"
