## USF beats Cards, 80-61 
### RICH MARTINEZ 
By the time the young Stan
ford team got over its initial jit
ters the U.S.F. Dons had con
trol of the game that was to
blemish the Cardinals' loss
column for the first time.
In the 80-61 victory, San
Francisco and All-America
candidate Mary Hile played up
to and above their potential in
the first Northern California
Athletic Conference game for
both teams.
Utilizing a tenacious 1-2-2
zone defense, the Dons suc
cessfully shut down Stanford's
inside game and seemed to
confuse a Cardinal offense that
ran across that type of set-up
for the first time this season.
The bewildered Cards of
fense lacked the powerful
winning attack, quick move

ment, and sharp passing that
were responsible for the
team's first eight wins. Besides
San Francisco's stingy defense,
poor shot selection caused the
women cagers shooting per
centage to dip to a season low
of 38 percent.
Stanford made two serious
threats at salvaging the lop
sided affair though. With two
minutes left in the first half, the
Card offense woke from its
comatose condition and, mov
ing brilliantly, cut the Dons'
lead to six and went to the loc
kers with the momentum.
As the second half resumed,
they seemed to regain the vib
rancy of their first eight games
and outscored San Francisco
12-6 to tie the score within the
first few minutes. The women
from the City then ran off nine

straight points and the Cards'
offense returned again to its
dormant stage.
Any attempts made to cut the
lead were thwarted by Sue Cot
tier, who blocked five shots
and grabbed seven rebounds,
Gloria Smith, who shot a per
fect eight-for-eight from the
floor in route to 17 points, and
Mary Hile, whose 23 points and
all-around brilliant court per
formance impressed everyone
in Maples Pavilion.
The Dons shot 55 percent
overall from the floor and
showed the poise of an experi
enced team.
The Stanford team simply
met a good team on one of
their hottest nights and they
lacked the experience to offset
some vital factors. It was an ex
cellent education for the
young Cardinal team, though.

"I think it's good for the girls
to lose once in a while," stated
coach Dotty McCrea.
"It really keeps them from
becoming complacent. We're
a young team and we'll en
counter many more of these
tough games before the season
is over. It's tough, though, that
it had to be the first league
game."
The Cards meet Yale this
Thursday evening at 5:45 p.m.
and, being a young team, will
probably put this loss behind
them and try to curb the
Bulldogs.
Angie Paccione and Jeanne
Ruark led the Cardinal cause

tively.

blemish the Cardinals' loss
column for the first time.
In the 80-61 victory, San
Francisco and All-America
candidate Mary Hile played up
to and above their potential in
the first Northern California
Athletic Conference game for
both teams.
Utilizing a tenacious 1-2-2
zone defense, the Dons suc
cessfully shut down Stanford's
inside game and seemed to
confuse a Cardinal offense that
ran across that type of set-up
for the first time this season.
The bewildered Cards of
fense lacked the powerful
winning attack, quick move

ment, and sharp passing that
were responsible for the
team's first eight wins. Besides
San Francisco's stingy defense,
poor shot selection caused the
women cagers shooting per
centage to dip to a season low
of 38 percent.
Stanford made two serious
threats at salvaging the lop
sided affair though. With two
minutes left in the first half, the
Card offense woke from its
comatose condition and, mov
ing brilliantly, cut the Dons'
lead to six and went to the loc
kers with the momentum.
As the second half resumed,
they seemed to regain the vib
rancy of their first eight games
and outscored San Francisco
12-6 to tie the score within the
first few minutes. The women
from the City then ran off nine

straight points and the Cards'
offense returned again to its
dormant stage.
Any attempts made to cut the
lead were thwarted by Sue Cot
tier, who blocked five shots
and grabbed seven rebounds,
Gloria Smith, who shot a per
fect eight-for-eight from the
floor in route to 17 points, and
Mary Hile, whose 23 points and
all-around brilliant court per
formance impressed everyone
in Maples Pavilion.
The Dons shot 55 percent
overall from the floor and
showed the poise of an experi
enced team.
The Stanford team simply
met a good team on one of
their hottest nights and they
lacked the experience to offset
some vital factors. It was an ex
cellent education for the
young Cardinal team, though.

"I think it's good for the girls
to lose once in a while," stated
coach Dotty McCrea.
"It really keeps them from
becoming complacent. We're
a young team and we'll en
counter many more of these
tough games before the season
is over. It's tough, though, that
it had to be the first league
game."
The Cards meet Yale this
Thursday evening at 5:45 p.m.
and, being a young team, will
probably put this loss behind
them and try to curb the
Bulldogs.
Angie Paccione and Jeanne
Ruark led the Cardinal cause

with 16 and 13 points, respec
tively.
