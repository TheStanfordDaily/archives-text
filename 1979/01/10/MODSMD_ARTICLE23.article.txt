# Dowhower set to take charge
## 
### IVAN MAISEL 
Rod Dowhower was very
professional in his debut as
head ccstii of the Stanford
Cardinals. Speaking in a low,
distinct voice, he calmly
fielded questions for almost an
hour. Even when shoved
against the wall by a pack of
salivating reporters brandish
ing microphones in his face
like weapons, Dowhower
didn't flinch. He was having
too much fun.
He looked like a 10-year-old
kid who had been accidentally
locked in a candy store all
night.
Here was a man with the
world on a string. If he had had
an umbrella, he would have
danced through the St. Francis
Hotel lobby, into the San Fran
cisco drizzle, bellowing "Sin
gin' In the Rain" in a fashion
that would have made Gene
Kelly proud.
Dowhower had the look that
every head coach who sent his
team out against the 49ers this
year had; his blue eyes literally
twinkled as he began his reign
as Stanford's 26th head coach.
Coach's coolness
Dowhower's coolness
prompted comparisons to his
predecessor, Bill Walsh. In
fact, one of the reasons
Dowhower is being elevated is
for a continuance of the prog
ram that has turned Stanford's
football fortunes around.
As Walsh's right-hand man,
the 35-year-old Nebraska na
tive was considered by many to
be the logical choice. He is fol
lowing in some large footsteps,
but Dowhower does not see
that as a problem.
"Replacing Bill like I am
(normally would) cause undue
pressure," Dowhower said,
"but the fact that I've worked
with him so closely gives me
that much more confidence."

Dowhower plans few im
mediate changes in the prog
ram, particularly because it is
"courtin' time." The signing
date for football scholarships is
in mid-February, and
Dowhower had nothing but
praise for the minimum of
boat-rocking that has occurred
in hiring a new skipper.
Recruiting paramount
"Recruiting is paramount,"
Dowhower said. "The change
and the way it has come about
has been done with class. The
expediency and swiftness will
allow us to continue (recruit
ing) without skipping a beat."
The offensive philosophy of
the Cardinals will undergo few
changes, for Dowhower's cur
rent dunes of quarterback and
receiver coach made him a key
designer of the Stanford at
tack.
"I have always believed in
the forward pass, and we will
continue to use that as a
weapon. We will continue to
recruit as fine of running backs
as possible," Dowhower said.
As for the rest of the prog
ram, Dowhower plans to make
only minor adjustments.
Coaching changes
"I will be organizing the
whole program to fit my
needs," Dowhower said. As for
coaching changes, there won't
be any; that is, if it is up to
Dowhower. There was specu
lation that Walsh would take
some of the staff with him to
Candlestick Park next season.
"I don't see any coaching
changes. I will continue to
coach the quarterbacks, but I
will need a receiver coach to
replace myself," Dowhower
said.
If Dowhower will need to re
place any of his staff, he
foresees no problems. While
naming no names, Dowhower
told reporters they "would be

surprised at the caliber of
coaches that have inquired
about assistant coaching posi
tions for Stanford football."
Dowhower began coaching
in 1966 at his alma mater, San
Diego State. While there, he
directed the development of
current NFL stars such as Isaac
Curtis, Haven Moses and Brian
Sipe.
Other stops included UCLA,
Boise State and one year in the
pros with the St. Louis Cardi
nals, before he arrived on the
Farm two years ago with Bill
Walsh.
Stars who have benefited
from Dowhower's tutelage in
clude John Sciarra, Dennis
Shaw, Jesse Freitas and the
Stanford entourage of Guy
Benjamin, James Lofton, Steve
Dils and Ken Margerum.
Player grumblings
A few Stanford players have
privately expressed grumbl
ings about the way the coach
ing change was handled, par
ticularly the fact that Walsh did
not call a team meeting to in
form them of the change be
fore they read it in the paper.
However, Dowhower has
called a team meeting for
Monday, January 15.

"We feel that due to the
press conference and all the
commotion surrounding the
change, that we would give the
players a few days to reflect
themselves upon the change,"
Dowhower explained. "It gives
me time to prepare my presen
tation to them."
Overall, Dowhower sees
himself as a teacher instead of a
coach. "Our fellows are bright,
articulate young men. They
know how to assimilate infor
mation," Dowhower said.
"I have a great deal of re
spect for the players. I have
never been disappointed by
any of them." That respect that
Dowhower speaks of is
twofold. He holds the respect
of everyone in the Athletic De
partment. Without it, he never
would have been appointed as
swiftly as he was, much less
given a three-year contract.
Athletic Director Andy
Geiger told reporters Tuesday
that he "has been aware of this
possibility (Walsh leaving Stan
ford) since October and pre
pared accordingly."
In other words, there was
never any doubt that Rodney
Douglas Dowhower was the
man for the job.
