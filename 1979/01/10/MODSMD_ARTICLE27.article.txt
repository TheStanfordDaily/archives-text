# Card cagers take on Cougars, hoping to renew winning ways
## 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Stanford attempts to resume its winning
habits at Maples Pavilion tomorrow evening
when it hosts Washington State in a Pacific-10
Conference basketball game at 8 p.m.
The Cardinals are just 7-6 overall and 1-3 in
conference, but they own a shiny 6-1 record at
Maples.
Washington State, meanwhile, has been get
ting the most out of its considerable talent. The
Cougars are 10-2, including victories over
Arizona and Arizona State â€” two teams that beat
Stanford this past weekend.
Junior guard Terry Kelly, averaging 16.4 points
per game, is WSU's leading scorer, but the
Cougars' two best all-around players are proba
bly )ames Donaldson and Don Collins.
You won't need a program or scorecard to
spot Donaldson. At 7-foot-2 and 280 lbs., he will
be the most conspicuous person in Maples to
morrow night.
Donaldson's performances have been as ba
lanced as he is large, averaging 13.5 points and
13.5 rebounds a game.
Stanford fans with keen memories recall Col
lins well as the man who scored just eight points
in WSU's 62-59 victory over Stanford in Maples
last year.
Four of those points, though, came in the last
two and a half minutes and provided the differ
ence. This year Collins is scoring at a 13.5 clip
and rebounding at a 6.5 pace.
Stuart House, whose last name is quite fitting
(he's 6-11, 230 lbs.), rounds out WSU's starting
front line. The other guard is promising
freshman Bryan Rison, averaging 9.7 points a

game.
Guard Clyde Huntley and wing John Preston
are among the top Cougar substitutes.
The WSU coach, George Raveling, is an ac
complished man of letters. He has authored two
books on basketball: "War on the Boards" and
"A Rebounder's Workshop."
Raveling might contemplate writing another
book: "On Defeating Stanford." Unfortunately
for the Cards, WSU has done just that six straight
times. The last time Stanford beat the Cougars
was in 1975, when Howie Dallmar was coach.
Stanford, of course, wants that six-game skein
to end tomorrow night. If the Cards do win, it is
likely that Wolfe Perry will be quite responsible.
Perry, Stanford's 6-2 senior guard, is averag
ing a brilliant 20.7 points a game on 51.4 percent
shooting.
He has been receiving able support from for
wards Kimberly Belton and Brian Welch. Belton
is the Cards' second-leading scorer with a 14.1
average and top rebounder at 9.6 boards a
game. Welch is averaging 12.7 points a game and
firing in 51.1 percent of his shots.
Paul Giovacchini has the anonymous but cer
tainly honorable job of getting the ball to Stan
ford's big three. And Giovacchini has done a
fine job in doing so, as he has already dished off
61 assists.
Either Tom Schmalzried or Jeff Ryan will start
at center. Schmalzried, at 6-11, will be needed to
contend with human skyscrapers Donaldson
and House.
Ryan has proved himself as a "game" player
with his last-second game-winning heroics over
UCLA and San Diego State.
