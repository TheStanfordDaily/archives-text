### 
The women's profes
sional tennis circuit has a
new member. Stanford's
Barbara Jordan has decided
to turn professional instead
of playing out her final year
of eligibility.
"We are disappointed as
far as the team is con
cerned," said women's ten
nis coach Ann Gould, "but
for Barbara, at this time, it's
probably the right move."
Jordan's pro career began
Monday evening as she

played in the opening
round of the Avon Champ
ionships at the Oakland Col
iseum.
Unfortunately for Jordan
her first round opponent
was the No. 1 women's ten
nis player in the world,
Chris Evert. Evert defeated
Jordan 6-3, 6-1 as the Stan
ford senior made some
crowd pleasing shots before
succumbing to Evert's usual
precision groundstrokes.
"I think she'll do very
well," Evert said after the

match. "She doesn't have
the reputation of an
amateur player."
Last season Jordan
teamed up with her younger
sister Kathy towin theAIAW
national doubles champ
ionship. The play of Jordan
during that tournament was
instrumental in Stanford's
winning its first AIAW team
title.
Jordan has also been
named a tennis All -
American three consecutive
years.
