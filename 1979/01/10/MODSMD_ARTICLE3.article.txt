One suspect, believed to be a member of a team of
rapists that has assaulted eight women locally, has been
taken into custody, according to police.
Francisco Rodriguez, 24, of 1180 Hilton Road, Red
wood City, is charged with attempted kidnap, rape and
child molestation, said Lt. Richard Piatt, press officer at
the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.
Similar tactics and victims' descriptions of the rapists
indicate that a gang of three to four Mexican-Americans
is working jointly in remote areas of Woodside and Palo
Alto, Sgt. Ken Bush of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
department said.
Rodriguez has been positively identified by a victim in
one case, and two other suspects are pending arrest,
Bush said.
"I know they're all involved, but now I have to prove
it," Bush said. He said he plans to have some line-ups of
possible suspects for identification and hopes such
identification, along with "some physical evidence" he
said r,e has, will lead to the arrest of the rest cf the team.

All eight attacks occurred over the last four months on
women who were alone. The victims, who were walking,
jogging or bicycling often did not see their attackers
because they were grabbed from behind, according to
Bush. He said the rapists often wait in the bushes before
seizing their victims and dragging them to secluded
areas.
A few of the rape attempts involved cars, Piatt said. In
one case, a morning jogger was grabbed by several men
in a car in Woodside but she managed to break loose.
Another woman who sat down on a rock along Kinyata
Road to rest was seized from behind and driven to Por
tola Valley where she was raped by two men, according
to Piatt.
The rapists first molested a 13-year-old girl riding her
bike on Alpine Road, Piatt said. The three men blocked
her path, knocked her off her bike, but she screamed
and got away, he explained.
One attack by the group occurred on the Stanford
campus, according to Bush, but the woman was able to
escape her attackers.
