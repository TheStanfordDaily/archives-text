# Green library completion delayed due to late bookshelf delivery

### MICHAEL PRINCE 
Thes2o million Cecil H. Green Lib
rary addition faces construction de
lays which may increase costs and
postpone the library's opening well
into the next academic year, accord
ing to Phil Leighton, Library Projects
Manager.
Bookshelves, promised by the
Estey Company in San )ose to be de
livered before the building's original
completion date of April 1, may not
be supplied until June or July at the
earliest, Leighton sad.
A spokesman for Estey Co. con
tacted by the Daily said, "we don't
know for sure yet whether or not
the shelving could be delivered on
schedule.
"Efforts are progressing to
minimize the delay," Leighton said.
But if the shelving is not delivered on
time, it is "very conceivable" that
Estey Co. will be in violation of their
contract and that litigation will result,

he said.
The bookshelves are central to the
completion of the library, because
without them, airflow and wiring sys
tems cannot be completed, while
work such as carpeting and lighting
must be delayed or installed at grea
ter expense.
Leighton expressed "guarded
hope" that the library will be ready
for use in the fall. However, for that
to be possible, building and book
moving procedures would have to be
accelerated over the summer which
would also result in increased costs.
The least optimistic estimate is that
the library addition will not be ready
for use until after winter vacation, he
said.
According to Leighton, the Estey
Co. contracted to build the shelves
within two years along special seis
mic and aestheitic specifications set
by Stanford.
But he said that Estey discovered
the project would require a complete

retooling of their shop, and in
formed Stanford in December that
the requested color and seismic
bracing could not be supplied.
Since that time they have promised
to meet the original seismic specifi
cations but not the color and have
asked for more time, according to
Leighton. To date, no new schedule
has been agreed on.
Work on the west wing of Green

Library (the old main library) is still in
its preliminary stages. An architect's
schematic design has been ap
proved, which will be subject to
numerous changes. The majoraim of
,the west wing construction is to re
novate architectural assets such as
arches and columns which have
been damaged through the years
due to "over-occupancy," Leighton
explained.

Construction at Green Library is behind schedule due to a problem with shelving
orders. Construction is expected to continue into the next academic year, and the
library may not be ready for use until Winter 1980.
