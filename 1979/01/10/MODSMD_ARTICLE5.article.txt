# Russian women urged to further themselves

"In the Soviet Union, people feel that a woman's work and civic activity
enhance her strengths, making her better able to raise the family," said
Madeline Duckies, guest speaker at yesterday's Bechtel International Center
noon luncheon.
Duckies, who made a trip to Russia in November, discussed the observa
tions she made about women in Soviet life with a group of about 40 students,
faculty, alumni and community members.
According to Duckies, traditional Russian cultural beliefs still dictate a
woman's primary functions â€” serving the family and maintaining the home.
But along with these established beliefs, Russia's socialist doctrines en
courage women to go to school and gain employment with the idea of
improving themselves and the country, Duckies said.
"Statistics show that 93 percent of the able-bodied women in Russia either
work or go to school," she added.
And though women are not yet in positions at the highest level of govern
ment, Duckies said that nearly five and one-half million of the country's
women have had some experience at either the local, regional or national
level of government.
In addition, Duckies said that women compose one-third of the members
of the Supreme Soviet, the legislative body comparable to the U.S. Con
gress.
This fact is remarkable, she added, in light of the fact that "there are only
about 18 women out of some 365 members" in the U.S. House of Represen
tatives.
At the end of her talk, Duckies stated that despite the fact that Soviet
women's lives are still largely bounded by their heritage and culture, they
have liberated their status considerably.
"We tend to criticize Soviet women for what they don't have." But in terms
of the numbers of women working or in school, they have achieved a
considerable amount, according to Duckies.
