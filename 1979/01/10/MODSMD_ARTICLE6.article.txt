# Biz students criticize maintenance
## 
### MATTHEW KREPS 
I Something's awry at the
"Graduate School of Business
■(GSB). It may have overtaken
lHarvard as the top American
*biz school, but it's also having
•trouble heating its rooms com
fortably and keeping its halls
•clean.
Since the school's news
paper, The Reporter, printed
•an article on poor mainte
nance, students and faculty
"have been vocally complaining
• about some long-standing
• Poor heating and ventilation
•— Some classrooms are so hot
stuffy that professors have
'chosen to move the classes
•elsewhere. Some faculty of
fices must use electric heaters
•to ward off the cold.
Poor custodial service —
squeak; litter swamps
•most restrooms, courtyards
land student lounges; no
•coathooks exist for wet rain
coats; a limited number of bike
jracks can't accommodate a
number of cycles.

News analysis
ft —

; Both the GSB and University
-administrators agree that prob
lems exist and say they're mak
"ing efforts to solve them. But
exactly who is responsible?
"flow does the University
handle maintenanceat the GSB
and on the rest of the campus
'as well?
The Office of Service Opera
tions has responsibility for
campus maintenance. But it is
the building maintenance divi
sion that directly handles cus
todial and building mainte
nance for the University —
excluding the Medical Center,
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and campus
housing.
Building maintenance, ac
cording to Operations Director
Bruce Wiggins, covers only the
actual buildings and classroom
furniture. All other furnishings

— in faculty offices, student
lounges, and the like — are the
individual schools' and de
partments' responsibilities.
Hence, squeaky or broken
classroom chairs are Wiggins'
problem, although the $2000
he has each year to cover
15,000 chairs here somewhat
limits the number of improve
ments he can make. Wiggins
estimates that oiling every
chair in the GSB once would
cost $2600, so he prefers the
GSB's solution to use student
labor to oil the squeaking
chairs.
Paul Johnson, the GSB's as
sistant dean of administration,
says chairs were oiled last
summer and again during
Christmas recess.
Service Operations con
tracts two outside firms for
campus custodial work. Both
companies work from identical
contracts of basic, minimum
specifications. These specs
provide for a single janitor to
clean the GSB during vveek
nights, but not during the day
or on weekends. The Univer
sity can not afford additional
service, according to Lucille
Maravilla, facilities coordinator
for the service operations of
fice.
Some schools, such as the
Law School, use their own
funds to obtain extra custodial
service. Other schools can and
do resort to volunteer student
labor for extra service.
Furnishings that individual
schools and departments sup
ply — such as faculty and grad
student offices, student
lounges, even coathooks — do
not come under Service Oper
ations' budget. So, if the GSB
wants to renovate its student
lounges, it must come up with
the money itself or request
funds from the University's
general funds pool.
Departments seeking refur
bishing, however, can purch
ase the services of the Univer
sity's maintenance shops,
which charge lower rates than

outside companies and often
have more experience dealing
with the campus buildings.
Problems with the GSB's
heating system began soon
after the school's construction
in 1966 and grew worse when
air conditioning was tacked on
several years later.
Thermostats are not fitted
for individual rooms but rather
for blocs ot rooms. So in any
given bloc, a sunny room may
be too warm while a shady
room may need more heating.
The system also does not
work as efficiently as it should,
says Jason Mavis, director of
Service Operations, because it
hasn't been cleaned since its
installation 12 years ago.
Nor was the system designed
with an energy shortage in
mind, Wiggins explains. Since
the University's energy con
servation implementation
program began in 1976, ventila
tion fans are periodically shut
off to conserve fuel. But the
system was not designed to
conserve fuel and remain
completely comfortable at the
same time, Mavis admits.
The Planning Office is now
working on cleaning and ad
justing the GSB's heating sys
tem, says Ole Christensen, the
engineer in charge of the
energy program. The office is
alsoworkingon similar heating
problems in Mitchell Earth Sci
ences Building, and in the
math corner of the Quad, and
plans to look into Old Union
and Jordan Hall.
If all the solutions just men
tioned above really exist, why
did the University wait so long
to implement them?
Mavis says simply, "We
know what the problems are,
we know how to solve them.
It's just a matter of resources."
Those resources, as Wiggins
explains, were cut back in two
budget programs in the '60s,
when building maintenance
was deemed a low-priority
area. Wiggins now has only
$1.5 million per year to cover

190 campus buildings.
Meanwhile, newer buildings
are more architecturally com
plex and thus more expensive
to maintain, Mavis says.
The people using the build
ings have also changed, creat
ing new demands. "The cul
ture has changed and the
building hasn't adapted,"
Trudi Jackson, second year biz
student, says of the CSB. For
example, it was not built for
bike riders, so that it suffers
from a shortage of bike racks,
and the University is not clear
on whose responsibiltiy rack
purchases are. The heating sys
tem has problems partly be
cause of one particular cultural
change — the energy crisis.
When will the GSB's prob
lems be eliminated? No one's
willingtosetadate. But Service
Operations has reorganized it
self and is now preparing its
first comprehensive mainte
nance plan for 1979-80.
Now, whenever problems
pop up — in the GSB or
elsewhere — Wiggins wants
people to pick up their
phones, dial the emergency
maintenance number and exp
lain the problem.

Litter is rampant throughout the Graduate School of Business student lounge. While faculty and students
complain about maintenance problems, funds to remedy the situation are lacking.
