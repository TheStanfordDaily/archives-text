# Art theft increases worldwide
## 
### 
Chicago (AP) — One apparently was the
work of a slick, well-schooled profes
sional, and the other, of an impulsive
amateur. But in each case, the result was
the same — the loss of works of art valued
in the millions of dollars.
Specialists in the international world of
art theft can only speculate about who
stole the paintings recently from museums
in San Francisco and Chicago, or who
eventually will receive them.
But experts agree the probable market
for the art is a loosely organized interna
tional criminal network specializing in
such expensive loot.
"What we find in most cases is that the
piece will be held and then placed on a
different market in a different country,"
said New York detective Robert Volpe, re
garded by the FBI and the international
police agency Interpol, as a leader in the
fight against art theft.
Last year, Volpe, the New York Police
Department's one-man art theft and re
covery squad, recovered more than 400
works of art, valued in excess of $2 million.
The objects ranged from a series of oil
paintings valued at $20 each by New
Yorker Morris Katz, the self-described
"King of Schlock Art," to the recovery of

four Byzantine ivory plaques, stolen from
the Pesaro Museum in Italy and valued at
$1.5 million.
Art theft statistics are rare. The magazine
U.S News & World Report said in a March
edition that more than 42,000 art objects,
with an estimated value of $33 million, are
stolen every year worldwide.
This would make art theft second only to
narcotics trafficking as an international
criminal activity. And experts feel that the
ever-spiraling price of art makes it ever
more inviting to criminals.
lust Sunday night, two armed men
forced their way into a Paris apartment and
made off with a Rembrandt self-portrait
and eight other paintings. The Rembrandt
was described as "priceless."
Art theives generally do their work more
quietly. On Christmas day in San Fran
cisco, for example, someone slipped
through a skylight of the M.H. de Young
Memorial Museum and stole Rembrandt's
"Portrait of a Rabbi," valued at $1 million,
and three other Dutch Renaissance paint
ings.
Authorities speculate the job was done
by a profssional who apparently knew
which of several skylights was not con
nected to a burglar alarm system.

On Dec. 27, three 19th century paintings
by French master Paul Cezanne, valued at
$.3 million, were discovered missing from a
storage room at the Art Institute of
Chicago. That was 10 days after institute
officials discovered an 18th century
Japanese scroll, valued at $5000, was sto
len from its frame in a first-floor gallery.
Experts say one sign that a comparative
amateur may have taken the Cezanne
paintings was that a piece of brown paper,
glued to the back of one painting, was left
behind in the thief's apparent haste.
Volpe discounts the idea that some
works are so well known they can't be
stolen and then sold.
"It may be difficult to move right away,"
he said, "but there are fences well-enough
placed to sit on these things for years. In
most instances, the art will eventually sur
face on the legitimate market.
"Once it does," said Volpe, "we get a
shot at recovering it. Sometimes,though,
word of its surfacing doesn't reach us in
time. Then it comes down to a question of
ethics in the art community. How much
are these people willing to turn their heads
and deal in gray areas."
