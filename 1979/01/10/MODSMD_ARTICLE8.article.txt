# GOP committee not to endorse candidates in special election for Ryan's vacant seat
## 
### ALI WEBB 
To thundering applause in a
packed meeting room, the Re
publican Central Committee of
San Mateo County voted Mon
day not to endorse any candi
date in the 11th Congressional
district seat contest.
The seat was vacated when
former Rep. Leo Ryan was kil
led Nov. 17 during an investiga
tion of the Rev. Jim Jones'
People's Temple in Guyana. A
special election has been
scheduled in March to fill the
vacancy in the 11th district.
The district's boundaries
stretch from the north San
Mateo County line to the mid
dle of Redwood City.
A close 15-13 vote against
endorsement effectively

locked up campaign coffers of
both state and national Repub
lican committees. Any candi
date who had received the en
dorsement would have also re
ceived strong financial aid for
his campaign.
'Joint effort'
San Mateo County Super
visor Bill Royer, whose 25 years
of local political experience
was expected to help him win
the nomination, attributed his
failure to a joint effort by other
candidates.
"There was no question that
this (non-endorsement vote)
was the field of Republican
candidates versus Bill Royer,"
he said.
"I can't say that I wouldn't
have done the same thing in

their position."
Royer's main opponents —
Dave Welch, who lost to Ryan
in last November's election;
Bruce Makar, a Burlingame real
estate broker; and Roger Can
field, a consultant to the San
MateoPolice Dept. —said they
had acted jointly against Royer
and in so doing had achieved a
victory for the voters.
Non-endorsement
"I consider non
endorsement a victory for the
rest of us. Royer put his clout
on the line and lost. Now it is a
fair fight for the people to de
cide," Makar said.
Supporters holding Makar
signs made up most of the au
dience at the meeting and
cheered loudly when the

committee's decision was an
nounced.
"The non-°ndorsement vote
was a vote against the political
machine mentality," Welch
declared.
A total of 18 candidates —
both Republican and Democ
ratic — have taken out
petition-in-lieu forms or have
formally announced their can
didacy.
The decision by the Republi
can Central Committee means
that no party money will go to
any of the Republican candi
dates. However candidates
appeared confident that Re
publican candidates will do
well in the special election in
which voters will be allowed to
vote across party lines.
The Democratic vote is split
between Joe Holsinger, aide to
the late Ryan and Millbrae at
torney George Corey. If no
candidate receives a majority
of votes in the first election,
then the leading vote-getters
from each party will face each
other in a run-off ballot.
And nationwide Republicans
have compiled an excellent re
cord for winning special elec
tions, according to Welch.
