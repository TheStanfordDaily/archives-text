With the start of the quarter, stu
dents here finally began to receive
the long-awaited 1978-79 Student Di
rectory.
We would like to be among the
first to congratulate editor Ray
Thomas on a fine new format. The
very readable names and addresses
are a welcome change from the dull,
hard-to-read microtype from the
past. The continuation of the
green-page guide to organizations
and the yellow advertiser pages was
another good idea.
Moreover, Thomas adds that this
year the publication, only in its sec
ond year of student control, nearly
broke even.
All well and good.
But there are still a few problems.
First off, distribution did not run all
that smoothly. Especially for off
campus students, securing one of
these rare books proved nearly im
possible with the usual redirection
from one office to another reported.
More importantly, it was January
before anyone saw the Student Di
rectory. Obviously their benefit to
students is automatically reduced by
one-third when they do not appear
before the second quarter of the
year.

Obviously, production is con
strained because the Registrar's Of
fice simply does not have even
quasi-accurate student records until
a few weeks into the quarter.
Still, some things could speed up
the process for the future.
Thomas reports that advertising
was sold over the summer. That's a
good move. But next year, hire
enough salespeople to complete the
work early. Then have the entire
publication ready to go in September
before school starts, leaving only
space for names and phone num
bers. This would necessitate collec
tion of organization information the
previous spring, but for an organized
staff, that should prove to be no real
burden.
In addition, since it was the paper
strike which caused a three-week
delay in printing, we suggest the
Publications Board contract for the
paper — maybe even purchase it —
now.
Finally, give the publication a staff
large enough to handle the big work
load which hits in mid-October.
The students subsidize the direc
tory. We feel it is only right that they
should receive the maximum possi
ble benefit from their investment.
