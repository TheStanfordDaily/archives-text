## On the faithful phone 
### 
I've often wondered if Stan
ford owns any stock in Pacific
Telephone. If the average stu
dent sinks as much into that
corporation as / have in the last
couple of years, it'd probably
be a better investment than
South Africa.
The telephone company is
an old hand at dealing with col
lege students. Remember the
first week of school, when they
dazzled you with seven styles
of phones available in at least
as many colors? And how they
had worked out big restricted,
little restricted, and unre
stricted service plans? Who
could resist?
In fact, getting the phone in
stalled at the beginning of au
tumn quarter usually precedes
registering, setting up the
stereo, even meeting your new
roommates. The guy across the
hall from me freshman year in
troduced himself by disas
sembling our phone to show
us the marvels of modular
technology. Needless to say,
the incident cast serious
doubts in my mind as to the
type of people I would be
meeting here.
Once the phone is in things
start getting complicated. You
spend all of the first quarter
getting your friends' last year's
numbers from "information."
Not to get discouraged — the
phone company usually has
this all straightened out by Ap
ril.
The next discovery is that it is
extremely difficult to share a
phone with one, two or three
other people. No matter how
diverse the student body is,
most of us have the same
schedule for using the phone.
The general rule in my trailer
is that if anyone is home,
there's someone on the
phone. I like to blame stagna
tions in my social life on this
fact. Of course 16 people tried
to call yesterday — they just

couldn't get through.
The other big headache is
trying to avoid certain calls.
These fall into two categories.
First, any calls before 8:30 a.m.
These are usually avoided sim
ply by pretending you're still
asleep.
The second category is the
tell-t hem-I'm-not-home
group. This includes calls from
your grandmother, the Mas
ter Charge credit office, your
Bio lab partner, your ex
boyfriend. The way around
these is to not be home, to
learn to impersonate your
roommate's voice, and to
change your phone number
mid-year.
The true ordeal involved in
owning a phone, however, is
that ominous white envelope
containing the monthly bill.
After two years of college,
my roommates and I have the
process down to a ritual.
First, someone takes the in
itiative to figure out who owes
what. This is accomplished
with help from the Texas In
strument I bought to survive
Math 41.
Immediate confusion arises,
and everyone files out to the
living room to heckle over the
bill. The huge calls always go to
me (Washington, D.C.), and
Roommate No. 2 (Pittsburgh,
Pa.). Roommate No. 3 (Pied
mont) and No. 4 (Palo Alto)
then divide up most of the Bay
Area calls. It always annoyed
me that they could make 27
calls for a tenth of what it costs
me to make three. Pac Tel
should offer stipends to the
geographically estranged.
Each month there is one
mystery call on the bill — to
someplace like Little Rock or
Minneapolis. I suppose the re
venue from these "calls" —
usually not big enough to
complain about — is used to
redecorate the office of some
phone company exec. Like I

said, they know what they're
doing.
Once each roommate knows
what she owes, it turns out that
no one has any money, any
way. Usually one roommate
gets nailed with the bill and
three 1.0.U.'5. Or somebody's
parents get nailed with the bill
and four 1.0.U.'5.
Phones can be a hassle. But I
don't know anybody who
could, or would want to, live
without one. It's really the best
way to keep in touch with the
"Real World" off the Farm. And
who knows when you'll get
that call from Harvard Law
School, IBM and Universal
Studios?

phone company usually has
this all straightened out by Ap
ril.
The next discovery is that it is
extremely difficult to share a
phone with one, two or three
other people. No matter how
diverse the student body is,
most of us have the same
schedule for using the phone.
The general rule in my trailer
is that if anyone is home,
there's someone on the
phone. I like to blame stagna
tions in my social life on this
fact. Of course 16 people tried
to call yesterday — they just

couldn't get through.
The other big headache is
trying to avoid certain calls.
These fall into two categories.
First, any calls before 8:30 a.m.
These are usually avoided sim
ply by pretending you're still
asleep.
The second category is the
tell-t hem-I'm-not-home
group. This includes calls from
your grandmother, the Mas
ter Charge credit office, your
Bio lab partner, your ex
boyfriend. The way around
these is to not be home, to
learn to impersonate your
roommate's voice, and to
change your phone number
mid-year.
The true ordeal involved in
owning a phone, however, is
that ominous white envelope
containing the monthly bill.
After two years of college,
my roommates and I have the
process down to a ritual.
First, someone takes the in
itiative to figure out who owes
what. This is accomplished
with help from the Texas In
strument I bought to survive
Math 41.
Immediate confusion arises,
and everyone files out to the
living room to heckle over the
bill. The huge calls always go to
me (Washington, D.C.), and
Roommate No. 2 (Pittsburgh,
Pa.). Roommate No. 3 (Pied
mont) and No. 4 (Palo Alto)
then divide up most of the Bay
Area calls. It always annoyed
me that they could make 27
calls for a tenth of what it costs
me to make three. Pac Tel
should offer stipends to the
geographically estranged.
Each month there is one
mystery call on the bill — to
someplace like Little Rock or
Minneapolis. I suppose the re
venue from these "calls" —
usually not big enough to
complain about — is used to
redecorate the office of some
phone company exec. Like I

said, they know what they're
doing.
Once each roommate knows
what she owes, it turns out that
no one has any money, any
way. Usually one roommate
gets nailed with the bill and
three 1.0.U.'5. Or somebody's
parents get nailed with the bill
and four 1.0.U.'5.
Phones can be a hassle. But I
don't know anybody who
could, or would want to, live
without one. It's really the best
way to keep in touch with the
"Real World" off the Farm. And
who knows when you'll get
that call from Harvard Law
School, IBM and Universal
Studios?

I've often wondered if Stan
ford owns any stock in Pacific
Telephone. If the average stu
dent sinks as much into that
corporation as / have in the last
couple of years, it'd probably
be a better investment than
South Africa.
The telephone company is
an old hand at dealing with col
lege students. Remember the
first week of school, when they
dazzled you with seven styles
of phones available in at least
as many colors? And how they
had worked out big restricted,
little restricted, and unre
stricted service plans? Who
could resist?
In fact, getting the phone in
stalled at the beginning of au
tumn quarter usually precedes
registering, setting up the
stereo, even meeting your new
roommates. The guy across the
hall from me freshman year in
troduced himself by disas
sembling our phone to show
us the marvels of modular
technology. Needless to say,
the incident cast serious
doubts in my mind as to the
type of people I would be
meeting here.
Once the phone is in things
start getting complicated. You
spend all of the first quarter
getting your friends' last year's
numbers from "information."
Not to get discouraged — the
phone company usually has
this all straightened out by Ap
ril.
