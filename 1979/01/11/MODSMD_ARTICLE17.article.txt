## McCloskey's incongruity 
### 
It is disappointing to see Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) continuing to
push his ill-conceived plan for mandatory
national service. In doing so, McCloskey is
even teaming up with old hawks like Sen.
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.); the incongruity of it all
is almost too much.
McCloskey's proposed program would
require all youths to register before their
18th birthday, and to choose one of three
different mini-programs: (1) one year of
civilian service by the age of 24, (2) two
years of military service, or (3) placement
in the military lottery pool, in which the
individual could be drafted into military
service, if necessary.
McCloskey justifies his program on the
grounds that the country must have a
"combat force in readiness," and that the
current volunteer system is not providing
one. Since McCloskey believes that the
current system is not working, he sees his
program as being necessary to adequately
prepare the United States for a potential
conflict.
However, even assuming, for the sake
of argument, that McCloskey is right and
the current system is not working, and that
some form of draft is required (which I
don't believe), his program of national
servitude is not justified.
The major point to note in the proposed
program is that it includes mandatory civi
lian, as well as military, service. Mandatory
civilian service, consisting of work with
retarded children, the peace corps, or
even farmers, has nothing to do with main
taining a "combat ready" force. Thus we
must look foranother reason forthe inclu
sion of this part of the program.
One explanation could be that McClos
key suffers from the typical Congressional
mentality of forever using the government
to run people's lives. This philosophy

holds that if a "problem" exists, gov
ernmental coercion must be applied to
"solve" it. Thus if farmers need cheap
labor, the government has a duty to pro
vide it.
Further, the Congressional frame of re
ference supports the notion that people
should possess certain values and experi
ences (arbitrarily chosen by the govern
ment, of course), and that such "qualities"
should be forced on the people if neces
sary. Thus if young people are in
adequately sensitive to the needs of re
tarded children, good ol' Big Brother will
pound it into them.
Another possible explanation is that
McCloskey is concerned with the equity of
a purely military service program. In the
past, the draft has been inherently arbit
rary and irrational; only a random sample
of males, who were too poor to get an
exemption for attending college, were en
snared. McCloskey's program therefore
does, in a sense, have the "virtue" of
eliminating this inequity: everyone —
male or female, rich or poor, healthy or
unhealthy — would be stuck with forced
labor.
However, this is simply not a justifica
tion for trampling over every young per
son's liberty. Better a system that disrupts
the lives of a few, rather than one which
affects an entire segment of society.
McCloskey's program is therefore un
necessarily overbroad in its attempt to re
medy the problem that he believes exists.
But more fundamental questions still re
main: does the problem in fact exist, and
even if it does, can a draft be morally jus
tified?
In charging that the current system is
not "working" (of which I've yet to see or
hear a satisfactory definition), McClos
key's chief complaint appears to be that

the United States spends 53 percent of its
defense budget on personnel costs, while
the USSR spends only 25 percent of a
comparable budget on such costs. There
fore, McCloskey argues, the United States
doesn't have enough money to spend on
weapons.
The problem with this argument is that
the personnel costs do not go away with a
draft. McCloskey proposes to eliminate
the high laborcosts by impressing a legion
of slave laborers at minimal wages, thus
imposing those high costs on them alone.
What the entire society is supposedly un
able to afford would incongruously be
borne entirely by young people between
the ages of 18 and 24.
Finally, the most basic question occurs
— whether the government has a moral
right to force someone to turn his or her
entire life over to the government, and to
even risk losing it. Even if one feels that a
"moral obligation" to defend the country
accrues from living in the United States,
this does not give one the right to force
others to fulfill it.
A free society should rise or fall on its
ability to generate voluntary support from
its citizens. A country that is virtuous and is
involved in a morally just struggle will
generate the support necessary to survive.
If the country has lost the moral authority
to generate such voluntary support, it de
serves its fate; it certainly does not have
the right to try to force the creation of such
support. Forcing people, in the name of
freedom, to join the military is a contradic
tion in terms.
McCloskey's plan is morally repugnant
and ill-conceived. It should be buried
where he sought to bury our freedom.

different mini-programs: (1) one year of
civilian service by the age of 24, (2) two
years of military service, or (3) placement
in the military lottery pool, in which the
individual could be drafted into military
service, if necessary.
McCloskey justifies his program on the
grounds that the country must have a
"combat force in readiness," and that the
current volunteer system is not providing
one. Since McCloskey believes that the
current system is not working, he sees his
program as being necessary to adequately
prepare the United States for a potential
conflict.
However, even assuming, for the sake
of argument, that McCloskey is right and
the current system is not working, and that
some form of draft is required (which I
don't believe), his program of national
servitude is not justified.
The major point to note in the proposed
program is that it includes mandatory civi
lian, as well as military, service. Mandatory
civilian service, consisting of work with
retarded children, the peace corps, or
even farmers, has nothing to do with main
taining a "combat ready" force. Thus we
must look foranother reason forthe inclu
sion of this part of the program.
One explanation could be that McClos
key suffers from the typical Congressional
mentality of forever using the government
to run people's lives. This philosophy

holds that if a "problem" exists, gov
ernmental coercion must be applied to
"solve" it. Thus if farmers need cheap
labor, the government has a duty to pro
vide it.
Further, the Congressional frame of re
ference supports the notion that people
should possess certain values and experi
ences (arbitrarily chosen by the govern
ment, of course), and that such "qualities"
should be forced on the people if neces
sary. Thus if young people are in
adequately sensitive to the needs of re
tarded children, good ol' Big Brother will
pound it into them.
Another possible explanation is that
McCloskey is concerned with the equity of
a purely military service program. In the
past, the draft has been inherently arbit
rary and irrational; only a random sample
of males, who were too poor to get an
exemption for attending college, were en
snared. McCloskey's program therefore
does, in a sense, have the "virtue" of
eliminating this inequity: everyone —
male or female, rich or poor, healthy or
unhealthy — would be stuck with forced
labor.
However, this is simply not a justifica
tion for trampling over every young per
son's liberty. Better a system that disrupts
the lives of a few, rather than one which
affects an entire segment of society.
McCloskey's program is therefore un
necessarily overbroad in its attempt to re
medy the problem that he believes exists.
But more fundamental questions still re
main: does the problem in fact exist, and
even if it does, can a draft be morally jus
tified?
In charging that the current system is
not "working" (of which I've yet to see or
hear a satisfactory definition), McClos
key's chief complaint appears to be that

the United States spends 53 percent of its
defense budget on personnel costs, while
the USSR spends only 25 percent of a
comparable budget on such costs. There
fore, McCloskey argues, the United States
doesn't have enough money to spend on
weapons.
The problem with this argument is that
the personnel costs do not go away with a
draft. McCloskey proposes to eliminate
the high laborcosts by impressing a legion
of slave laborers at minimal wages, thus
imposing those high costs on them alone.
What the entire society is supposedly un
able to afford would incongruously be
borne entirely by young people between
the ages of 18 and 24.
Finally, the most basic question occurs
— whether the government has a moral
right to force someone to turn his or her
entire life over to the government, and to
even risk losing it. Even if one feels that a
"moral obligation" to defend the country
accrues from living in the United States,
this does not give one the right to force
others to fulfill it.
A free society should rise or fall on its
ability to generate voluntary support from
its citizens. A country that is virtuous and is
involved in a morally just struggle will
generate the support necessary to survive.
If the country has lost the moral authority
to generate such voluntary support, it de
serves its fate; it certainly does not have
the right to try to force the creation of such
support. Forcing people, in the name of
freedom, to join the military is a contradic
tion in terms.
McCloskey's plan is morally repugnant
and ill-conceived. It should be buried
where he sought to bury our freedom.

It is disappointing to see Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) continuing to
push his ill-conceived plan for mandatory
national service. In doing so, McCloskey is
even teaming up with old hawks like Sen.
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.); the incongruity of it all
is almost too much.
