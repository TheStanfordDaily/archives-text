## Social Security system needs reassessment 
### 
(First of two parts)
"It will act as a protection to
future administrations against
the necessity of going deeply
into debt to furnish relief to the
needy."
- Franklin Delano Roosevelt
With this objective,
Roosevelt signed into law, in
1935, one of the most massive
and controversial federal prog
rams now in existence — social
security. But this "insurance"
program has turned into a fi
nancial nightmare for both the
citizens and the government.
In seeking to solve the prob
lems that plague the social
security system, the 95th Con
gress chose to saddle Ameri
can taxpayers with the largest
peacetime tax increase in Un
ited States history.
It is projected that, over the
next 10 years, this new tax will

require taxpayers to pay an ad
ditional $227 billion. It is obvi
ous that there is a financial de
ficit problem, but there are
some positive solutions.
The current crisis has
evolved from past Congress'
follies. In the past, Congress
has repeatedly increased be
nefits and broadened coverage
without adding new taxes to
pay for it.
Congress lacked the
foresight to predict the disaster
which would develop. Because
of this, we are now faced with
massive social security tax in
creases. As of this Jan. 1, social
security tax increases from 6.05
percent of income to 6.13 per
cent.
In addition, the tax will be
collected on largerearnings. In
1978, social security tax was

collected on the first $17,700 of
income. In 1979, it will be col
lected on the first $22,900.
Everyone who earns $22,900 or
more faces a payroll tax in
crease of $333 from $1071 in
1978 to $1404 in 1979.
As late as 1970, the maximum
tax was $374. Between 1978 and
1987 the tax rate will rise in
steps to 7.15 percent and the
maximum salary tax will go to
$42,600. This means the
maximum social security tax
levied on a workerwill increase
to $3046 in 1987.
In 1975, for the first time,
taxes paid into the program did
not cover benefits paid out,
making necessary a tapping of
the system's dwindling reserve
fund.
The financial problems re
sulted from four majorfactors:
— increased unemploy
ment, which has reduced the
fund's income;
— increases in the Con
sumer Price Index, which
cause higher outlays, since be
nefits are tied to the CPI;
— increased lifespans; and
— a decrease in the growth
rate of the population, which
obviously reduces the number
of new individuals entering the
system. There simply are not as
many workers in the labor
force contributing to one re
tiree as in prior years.
The social security system
will only work as long as it is in
a pyramid form. The elderly at
the top receive funds only so
long as an ever increasing
number of young people enter
at the bottom. By the year 1990
it is reliably estimated, there
will be two workers supporting
one retiree. This is in contrast
to the present ratio of four
workers to every retiree, and

22 workers for every retiree 30
years ago.
But Congress has not
learned their lesson yet. Cur
rently, there is talk of escalat
ing the tax rate in the future to
an astronomical 9.20 percent
and ultimately to raise the tax
able wage base to 94 percent of
income.
There is also talk of removing
the wage base ceiling for
employers entirely. Removing
the wage base ceiling for
employers simply means that
employers have no other alter
native than to pass those in
creased costs on to all of us as
consumers.

The employee, on the other
hand, will be faced with a di
minishing take home amount
in his or her paycheck.
The only alternative for the
employee will be to ask for
higherwages. The result of this
will be enormous inflation.
And the person hit hardest by
this inflation will be the one
who is supposed to benefit
from this program, the retired
worker.
The solutions the Congress
has provided us seem limited
and inadequate. It is time for
effective action and new prop
osals to solve this dilemma.

the wage base ceiling for
employers entirely. Removing
the wage base ceiling for
employers simply means that
employers have no other alter
native than to pass those in
creased costs on to all of us as
consumers.

The employee, on the other
hand, will be faced with a di
minishing take home amount
in his or her paycheck.
The only alternative for the
employee will be to ask for
higherwages. The result of this
will be enormous inflation.
And the person hit hardest by
this inflation will be the one
who is supposed to benefit
from this program, the retired
worker.
The solutions the Congress
has provided us seem limited
and inadequate. It is time for
effective action and new prop
osals to solve this dilemma.

"It will act as a protection to
future administrations against
the necessity of going deeply
into debt to furnish relief to the
needy."
- Franklin Delano Roosevelt
With this objective,
Roosevelt signed into law, in
1935, one of the most massive
and controversial federal prog
rams now in existence — social
security. But this "insurance"
program has turned into a fi
nancial nightmare for both the
citizens and the government.
In seeking to solve the prob
lems that plague the social
security system, the 95th Con
gress chose to saddle Ameri
can taxpayers with the largest
peacetime tax increase in Un
ited States history.
It is projected that, over the
next 10 years, this new tax will

require taxpayers to pay an ad
ditional $227 billion. It is obvi
ous that there is a financial de
ficit problem, but there are
some positive solutions.
The current crisis has
evolved from past Congress'
follies. In the past, Congress
has repeatedly increased be
nefits and broadened coverage
without adding new taxes to
pay for it.
Congress lacked the
foresight to predict the disaster
which would develop. Because
of this, we are now faced with
massive social security tax in
creases. As of this Jan. 1, social
security tax increases from 6.05
percent of income to 6.13 per
cent.
In addition, the tax will be
collected on largerearnings. In
1978, social security tax was

collected on the first $17,700 of
income. In 1979, it will be col
lected on the first $22,900.
Everyone who earns $22,900 or
more faces a payroll tax in
crease of $333 from $1071 in
1978 to $1404 in 1979.
As late as 1970, the maximum
tax was $374. Between 1978 and
1987 the tax rate will rise in
steps to 7.15 percent and the
maximum salary tax will go to
$42,600. This means the
maximum social security tax
levied on a workerwill increase
to $3046 in 1987.
In 1975, for the first time,
taxes paid into the program did
not cover benefits paid out,
making necessary a tapping of
the system's dwindling reserve
fund.
The financial problems re
sulted from four majorfactors:
— increased unemploy
ment, which has reduced the
fund's income;
— increases in the Con
sumer Price Index, which
cause higher outlays, since be
nefits are tied to the CPI;
— increased lifespans; and
— a decrease in the growth
rate of the population, which
obviously reduces the number
of new individuals entering the
system. There simply are not as
many workers in the labor
force contributing to one re
tiree as in prior years.
The social security system
will only work as long as it is in
a pyramid form. The elderly at
the top receive funds only so
long as an ever increasing
number of young people enter
at the bottom. By the year 1990
it is reliably estimated, there
will be two workers supporting
one retiree. This is in contrast
to the present ratio of four
workers to every retiree, and

22 workers for every retiree 30
years ago.
But Congress has not
learned their lesson yet. Cur
rently, there is talk of escalat
ing the tax rate in the future to
an astronomical 9.20 percent
and ultimately to raise the tax
able wage base to 94 percent of
income.
There is also talk of removing
the wage base ceiling for
employers entirely. Removing
the wage base ceiling for
employers simply means that
employers have no other alter
native than to pass those in
creased costs on to all of us as
consumers.
