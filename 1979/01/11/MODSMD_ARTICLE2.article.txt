# Foreign engineering students troubled here
## 
### NANA N'KUMULAH HUMASI 
The University's School of En
gineering ranks third in the nation,
behind Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and California Institute
of Technology, and enrolls 2142 stu
dents — 552 of whom are foreign.
"The foreign application figures
are constantly on the rise," said Ann
Fletcher, credentials evaluator in the
Foreign Graduate Admissions office.
"Out of approximately 2300 applica
tions received in this office, about
1000 will be to the engineering
school."
The rise in the number of foreign
students has caused some concern
to school administrators, faculty and
students.

"Some foreign students have
complained that certain professors
do not like having them in their clas
ses," said Mitchell Hall, foreign stu
dent advisor at Bechtel International
Center. "At the same time some have
talked about other professors want
ing more foreign students," he said.
Studying engineering here pre
sents mixed benefits for the foreign
student. He may leave with a re
spectable degree but may not have
studied anything of relevance to the
developing or underdeveloped
country from which he came.
"There is too much emphasis on
computer solutions," said Roberto
Leon, masters candidate in structure
from Costa Rica. "I may never work
with computers in Costa Rica and
even if, computertime would bevery
expensive. Right now my professor
works with steel, which is a material

of high expense in my country."
Tim Gonsalves, computer science
doctoral candidate from India, said
the faculty at the India Institute of
Technology (IIT) is comparable to
here, the only difference being that
the lIT faculty is not under the same
pressure to publish academic pap
ers.
Therefore, Gonsalves said, "they
make better teachers than those here
who find out that research ability
does not automatically make one
able to convey basics to students."
In 1976, William Kays, dean of the
School of Engineering, commis
sioned a study to find out how
foreign students and faculty related
to each other.
"The dean's task force surveyed
200 ex-students and 113 faculty," said
Grant Ireson, professor of industrial
engineering and head of the study
group. "It was conducted so that we
could help in policy making in rela
tion to the admission of foreign stu
dents.
"Twelve percent of the faculty said
that the courses offered had no use
to the student in his country," Ireson
said. "One-hundred of the 113 said
they would not be interested in con
tributing to any internationally
oriented courses or seminars."
"Courses here are not designed
with the foreign students in mind,"
said Madelyn Hunt, assistant dean of
the School of Engineering. However,
to ensure their preparedness for the
graduate program, applicants are re
quired to take a language exam, such
as the Graduate Record Exam.
Nevertheless, there are Asian and
Latin American students who find it
difficult to carry on daily conversa
tions in English.

Leon rebuffed Hunt's remarks on
the designing of the courses. He did
not consider that approach approp
riate because of the number of
foreign students enrolled in the
programs. However, he said he
could understand the underlying
philosophy of Hunt's statement.
To alleviate the problem of irrele
vance, a seminar, Ethics of Develop
ment in a Global Environment
(EDGE) has been sponsored jointly
by the Bechtel International Center,
engineering and education schools,
and the anthropology department.

"EDGE brings the sociological
meaning of science applications into
focus," said Ursula Funk, doctoral
candidate in anthropology from
Switzerland
The situation of foreign students in
American universities is of growing
concern. The National Science
Foundation has offered a foreign
student here a $1000 grant to study
the situation of the foreign engineer
ing student, the relevance of the
courses and how students and the
school interact.
Kays expressed other concerns
about the number of foreign stu
dents that enroll in the graduate en
gineering program.
"We must remember that Stanford
programs are sponsored by Ameri
can industry and we therefore must
be able to supply American industry
with American engineers," Kays said.

"If we can't supply enough Ph.D s to
industry, we will begin to encounter
a serious problem. This is a potential
difficulty we have to deal with in re
spect to the ratio of Americans to
foreign students in the engineering
program."
"There is another concern that the
foreign students are a loss in alumni
revenue to the school for the backing
of the programs," Hall said. "When
the foreign alumni go home, there is
no contribution forthcoming to sup
port the program they had been in."
Some foreign students said they

are sponsored by their government
or American firms abroad.
"I did not choose Stanford for my
self," said Mamadou Traore, a mas
ters candidate in petroleum en
gineering from the Ivory Coast. "My
government sent me here even
though I had wanted to go to Tulsa,
Oklahoma which has a better pet
roleum department than Stanford.
But that's not saying the standards
here are not high," he said.
Some students have great diffi
culty relating to professors and un
derstanding them. Vet others comp
lain of a cold distance between pro
fessors and foreign students.
"Some of them (professors) take it
for granted that you know a great
deal and just fly through the material
without much concentration," Leon
said.

"We must remember that Stanford
programs are sponsored by Ameri
can industry and we therefore must
be able to supply American industry
with American engineers," Kays said.

"If we can't supply enough Ph.D s to
industry, we will begin to encounter
a serious problem. This is a potential
difficulty we have to deal with in re
spect to the ratio of Americans to
foreign students in the engineering
program."
"There is another concern that the
foreign students are a loss in alumni
revenue to the school for the backing
of the programs," Hall said. "When
the foreign alumni go home, there is
no contribution forthcoming to sup
port the program they had been in."
Some foreign students said they

are sponsored by their government
or American firms abroad.
"I did not choose Stanford for my
self," said Mamadou Traore, a mas
ters candidate in petroleum en
gineering from the Ivory Coast. "My
government sent me here even
though I had wanted to go to Tulsa,
Oklahoma which has a better pet
roleum department than Stanford.
But that's not saying the standards
here are not high," he said.
Some students have great diffi
culty relating to professors and un
derstanding them. Vet others comp
lain of a cold distance between pro
fessors and foreign students.
"Some of them (professors) take it
for granted that you know a great
deal and just fly through the material
without much concentration," Leon
said.

"Courses here are not designed with the foreign
students in mind/' says Madelyn Hunt, assistant
dean of the School of Engineering.
The University's School of En
gineering ranks third in the nation,
behind Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and California Institute
of Technology, and enrolls 2142 stu
dents — 552 of whom are foreign.
"The foreign application figures
are constantly on the rise," said Ann
Fletcher, credentials evaluator in the
Foreign Graduate Admissions office.
"Out of approximately 2300 applica
tions received in this office, about
1000 will be to the engineering
school."
The rise in the number of foreign
students has caused some concern
to school administrators, faculty and
students.

"Some foreign students have
complained that certain professors
do not like having them in their clas
ses," said Mitchell Hall, foreign stu
dent advisor at Bechtel International
Center. "At the same time some have
talked about other professors want
ing more foreign students," he said.
Studying engineering here pre
sents mixed benefits for the foreign
student. He may leave with a re
spectable degree but may not have
studied anything of relevance to the
developing or underdeveloped
country from which he came.
"There is too much emphasis on
computer solutions," said Roberto
Leon, masters candidate in structure
from Costa Rica. "I may never work
with computers in Costa Rica and
even if, computertime would bevery
expensive. Right now my professor
works with steel, which is a material

of high expense in my country."
Tim Gonsalves, computer science
doctoral candidate from India, said
the faculty at the India Institute of
Technology (IIT) is comparable to
here, the only difference being that
the lIT faculty is not under the same
pressure to publish academic pap
ers.
Therefore, Gonsalves said, "they
make better teachers than those here
who find out that research ability
does not automatically make one
able to convey basics to students."
In 1976, William Kays, dean of the
School of Engineering, commis
sioned a study to find out how
foreign students and faculty related
to each other.
"The dean's task force surveyed
200 ex-students and 113 faculty," said
Grant Ireson, professor of industrial
engineering and head of the study
group. "It was conducted so that we
could help in policy making in rela
tion to the admission of foreign stu
dents.
"Twelve percent of the faculty said
that the courses offered had no use
to the student in his country," Ireson
said. "One-hundred of the 113 said
they would not be interested in con
tributing to any internationally
oriented courses or seminars."
"Courses here are not designed
with the foreign students in mind,"
said Madelyn Hunt, assistant dean of
the School of Engineering. However,
to ensure their preparedness for the
graduate program, applicants are re
quired to take a language exam, such
as the Graduate Record Exam.
Nevertheless, there are Asian and
Latin American students who find it
difficult to carry on daily conversa
tions in English.

Leon rebuffed Hunt's remarks on
the designing of the courses. He did
not consider that approach approp
riate because of the number of
foreign students enrolled in the
programs. However, he said he
could understand the underlying
philosophy of Hunt's statement.
To alleviate the problem of irrele
vance, a seminar, Ethics of Develop
ment in a Global Environment
(EDGE) has been sponsored jointly
by the Bechtel International Center,
engineering and education schools,
and the anthropology department.

"EDGE brings the sociological
meaning of science applications into
focus," said Ursula Funk, doctoral
candidate in anthropology from
Switzerland
The situation of foreign students in
American universities is of growing
concern. The National Science
Foundation has offered a foreign
student here a $1000 grant to study
the situation of the foreign engineer
ing student, the relevance of the
courses and how students and the
school interact.
