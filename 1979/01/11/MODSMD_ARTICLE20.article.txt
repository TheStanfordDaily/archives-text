# Dinosaur extinction puzzles scholars

### SUE GOLDFARB 
"If dinosaurs hadn't become
extinct, man might not havb
evolved," said Dr. Dale Russell
in a speech held yesterday at
Ames Research Center in
Mountain View.
Russell has a Ph.D. in geol
ogy from Columbia University
and specializes in dinosaur
taxonomy — especially focus
ing on the problem of extinc
tion.
* Russell explained that some
dinosaurs were bipedal and
had human-like eyes, as well as
other humanoid attributes.
Had they not become extinct,
they might well have occupied
some of the niches primitive
man held at some time — pos
sibly changing the course of

evolution, according to Rus
sell.
"Dinosaurs were 67 percent
more encephalized than mod
ern reptiles and they had seven
times the brain power of al
ligators," Russell said.
Enigmatic event
This is one of the reasons he
calls the extinction of the di
nosaur an enigmatic event. He
said he finds it baffling that an
animal as developed as the di
nosaur could vanish from the
earth in a period of only about
300,000 years.
Russell said that other or
ganisms disappeared 65 to 75
million years ago with the di
nosaur. He emphasized that
this sudden extinction is im
portant because it signifies that

the continuity of life on earth
has been disrupted.
Because other organisms
also disappeared, and di
nosaur bones are so difficult to
find and piece together,
paleontologists like Russell
find it more practical to study
micro-fossils that became ex
tinct around the same time as
the dinosaurs.
Ecological change
After the dinosaurs left the
earth, there was no significant
change in vegetation, accord
ing to Russell. He said he finds
this startling because their dis
appearance was a substantial
ecological change on plant life.
A member of the audience
proposed that the extinction
may have caused a lack of car

bon dioxide, thus stifling plant
growth. Russell appeared in
terested in the hypothesis.
Selective event
One of the most interesting
of Russell's hypotheses is that
the extinction of the dinosaur
was a selective event. "Only
certain species were wiped
out. Some marine turtles made
it through. Generally, it seems
that the more general species
made it through while the
more specialized ones did
not."
Russell concluded by saying
he had a lot more research
planned, in an attempt to ans
wer the question why the most
highly evolved creature on
earth left 20 million years be
fore man appeared.
