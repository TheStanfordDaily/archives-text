## Upcoming jazz 
### 
Mel Martin and Listen,
one of the Bay Area's fastest
rising jazz groups, will per
form at the Station (formerly
the Encina Commons) on
January 19. Tl « appearance
by Listen istb rst concert
in what promises to be an
outstanding jazz series at
the Station.
Martin's group has been
gaining greater and greater
national exposure since
they signed with jazz
oriented Inner City records.
With the departure of
pianist Art Lande, Listen
remains, perhaps, the most
important jazz group
situated in the Bay Area.
Croup leader Martin is an
extremely capable reed
player who displays fluency
on a variety of instruments.
In addition to his work on
saxophone, Martin also
plays flute, piccolo and
bass clarinet.
The other outstanding
member of Listen, in my
opinion, is drummer
George Marsh. Marsh is
another local who is begin
ning to gain national promi
nence. Particularly impres
sive has been his work with
pianist Denny Zeitlin.
Forthcoming concerts at
the Station include progres
sive violinist Leroy Jenkins,
on January 27, and Latin jazz

veteran Willie Bobo on Feb
rary 3.
A particular treat will be
the appearance of Joe Pass
at the Station on February 8.
Pass, in this reviewer's opin
ion, the best guitarist in
jazz day. Not only that,
then .re few classical artists
that can match Pass's
fluency on the six-stringed
instrument. I expect that
tickets for this may vanish
rather soon.
Peninsula jazz
The last announced act at
the Station will be Yusef
Lateef, who brings his
group to Stanford on Feb
ruary 24. Lateef is a master
ful reed player who has
been one of the luminaries
of the tenor sax for two de
cades. Recently Lateef re
vamped his mainstream
group to give it a newer
more accessible sound. I
have yet to hear any of the
new group's music, but I do
have fond memories of the
last time I saw Lateef per
form. The series strikes me
as being the most ambitious
endeavor to bring jazz to
campus since the '60s.
The groups booked appeal
to a broad range of jazz fans,
and will hopefully signal
Stanford's emergence as
one of the important cen
ters of Peninsula jazz.
