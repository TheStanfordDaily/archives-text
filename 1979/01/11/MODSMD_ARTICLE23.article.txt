## Movies/ron lillejord 'Superman' – the virtues of comic book sense 
### 
The last hour or so of Super
man is sheer comic book fun,
with the kind of drive that used
to (or perhaps still does) make
you keep poring through
stacks of comics at the local
drugstore.
And there's something to
that kind of drive; it's enough
to power this excessively
budgeted "Big Movie."
Superman, though, is hardly
great, and you often hate it, but
it's got enough comic book
sense to be a success.
Superman often looks to be
out of control — it seems to
luck into its best moments. The
movie isn't inventive; most of
its choices are obvious ones
because no one seems to want
to take charge.
Director Richard Donner
probably didn't have the
power to get (or maybe he
simply didn't know) the style
he wanted, so he lets his actors
choose the movie's tone.
Brando
Marlon Brando's mock seri
ousness dominates the over
long opening sequence, which
is a weak fantasy sketch with
mysticism cloned from Star
Wars. Brando plays Jor-EI, a
big-shot on Krypton; he deliv
ers his lines in a solemn man
ner like someone from a
Shakesperean tragedy, his
hands resting on his chest, his
voice sharp, well-modulated. •
But there's a slight smile in
Brando's face as he goes about
his business. It's as if he's

laughing at a system which
makes a 15-minute perfor
mance worth $3.7 million.
Besides getting Brando into
the movie (and making the in
vestors happy), the only other
purpose of this opening sequ
ence seems to be to stuff a lot
of familiar English actors (Tre
vor Howard, Harry Andrews,
etc.) into a half-baked disaster
sequence, as Krypton explodes
just after the baby Superman is
sent to Earth.
Middle America Buick
After the boy lands and
Glenn Ford appears, you know
what to expect — Middle
America Buick. For no appa
rent reason, this sequence —
Superman growing up in the
Midwest — is percussively shot
(by master cinematographer
Geoffrey Unsworth, who died
shortly after the production
ended) with lots of pictures of
endless horizons. This section
of the film "works" like those
car commericals Glenn Ford
makes on TV do — it's pleasant
if you aren't paying attention —
but the movie moves on before
things get tiresome.
Up to this point, the movie is
reeling badly, but it saves itself
by jumping into Metropolis,
where we finally get to see
Christopher Reeve. Reeve,
who plays the roles of Clark
Kent and Superman with what
(amazingly enough) can almost
be called deftness, is im
mediately likeable. He takes a
role filled with potential disas

ter and waltzes through it with
engaging believability.
In a smart, sexy perfor
mance, Margot Kidder pro
vides a good contrast to Reeve.
Lois Lane is a thankless and
forgettable role — a woman
who's always in a fog and in
some sort of trouble. If Kidder
didn't try to exploit something
in the role, I don't think any
one would know she was in the
movie. Although Kidder has
the movie's worst scene — the
sequence where Superman
takes her for a flight above
Metropolis and she recites a
poem about the god flying be
side her — she brings out the
sexiness we always knew Lois
Lane had and survives the role
winningly.
With a nicely done love

story, good pacing and just
enough planned comedy, the
movie's last 75 minutes go
quickly, like a good stack of
comic books would. Donner
wisely avoids building up his
special effects, like Steven
Spielberg did in Close Encoun
ters, because his effects aren't
strong enough. With clever
editing, Donner keeps throw
ing his effects at us, faster and
faster, until the movie reaches
its rather breathless climax.
The major dampener in this
portion of the movie is Gene
Fiackman, who plays Lex
Luthor, master villain. More
than anything else, Hackman is
done in by lack of coherence
caused by having several diffe
rent screenwriters work on his
character, but he gives a clow

nish performance besides.
Hackman reminded Pauline
Kael of a character in the Hat
man TV series, and that's just
about right. There's nothing
necessarily wrong with that,
but it doesn't work here.
Mad jumble
Superman is a mad jumble of
a movie; it bounces along from
flawed to strong scene without
ablush. lt'sa"BigMovie"mess
that looks effortless, and for
what it's worth, I don't think
you'll find a better Lois and
Clark Kent/Superman than
Kidder and Reeve. Superman
runs the gamut of limited emo
tions, and that's more than
such movies usually give us —
and besides, we didn't expect
much more from the old comic
books, did we?


Christopher Reeve plays the title character in Superman, now playing at the Park Theater in Menlo Park.

movie isn't inventive; most of
its choices are obvious ones
because no one seems to want
to take charge.
Director Richard Donner
probably didn't have the
power to get (or maybe he
simply didn't know) the style
he wanted, so he lets his actors
choose the movie's tone.
Brando
Marlon Brando's mock seri
ousness dominates the over
long opening sequence, which
is a weak fantasy sketch with
mysticism cloned from Star
Wars. Brando plays Jor-EI, a
big-shot on Krypton; he deliv
ers his lines in a solemn man
ner like someone from a
Shakesperean tragedy, his
hands resting on his chest, his
voice sharp, well-modulated. •
But there's a slight smile in
Brando's face as he goes about
his business. It's as if he's

laughing at a system which
makes a 15-minute perfor
mance worth $3.7 million.
Besides getting Brando into
the movie (and making the in
vestors happy), the only other
purpose of this opening sequ
ence seems to be to stuff a lot
of familiar English actors (Tre
vor Howard, Harry Andrews,
etc.) into a half-baked disaster
sequence, as Krypton explodes
just after the baby Superman is
sent to Earth.
Middle America Buick
After the boy lands and
Glenn Ford appears, you know
what to expect — Middle
America Buick. For no appa
rent reason, this sequence —
Superman growing up in the
Midwest — is percussively shot
(by master cinematographer
Geoffrey Unsworth, who died
shortly after the production
ended) with lots of pictures of
endless horizons. This section
of the film "works" like those
car commericals Glenn Ford
makes on TV do — it's pleasant
if you aren't paying attention —
but the movie moves on before
things get tiresome.
Up to this point, the movie is
reeling badly, but it saves itself
by jumping into Metropolis,
where we finally get to see
Christopher Reeve. Reeve,
who plays the roles of Clark
Kent and Superman with what
(amazingly enough) can almost
be called deftness, is im
mediately likeable. He takes a
role filled with potential disas

ter and waltzes through it with
engaging believability.
In a smart, sexy perfor
mance, Margot Kidder pro
vides a good contrast to Reeve.
Lois Lane is a thankless and
forgettable role — a woman
who's always in a fog and in
some sort of trouble. If Kidder
didn't try to exploit something
in the role, I don't think any
one would know she was in the
movie. Although Kidder has
the movie's worst scene — the
sequence where Superman
takes her for a flight above
Metropolis and she recites a
poem about the god flying be
side her — she brings out the
sexiness we always knew Lois
Lane had and survives the role
winningly.
With a nicely done love

story, good pacing and just
enough planned comedy, the
movie's last 75 minutes go
quickly, like a good stack of
comic books would. Donner
wisely avoids building up his
special effects, like Steven
Spielberg did in Close Encoun
ters, because his effects aren't
strong enough. With clever
editing, Donner keeps throw
ing his effects at us, faster and
faster, until the movie reaches
its rather breathless climax.
The major dampener in this
portion of the movie is Gene
Fiackman, who plays Lex
Luthor, master villain. More
than anything else, Hackman is
done in by lack of coherence
caused by having several diffe
rent screenwriters work on his
character, but he gives a clow

nish performance besides.
Hackman reminded Pauline
Kael of a character in the Hat
man TV series, and that's just
about right. There's nothing
necessarily wrong with that,
but it doesn't work here.
Mad jumble
Superman is a mad jumble of
a movie; it bounces along from
flawed to strong scene without
ablush. lt'sa"BigMovie"mess
that looks effortless, and for
what it's worth, I don't think
you'll find a better Lois and
Clark Kent/Superman than
Kidder and Reeve. Superman
runs the gamut of limited emo
tions, and that's more than
such movies usually give us —
and besides, we didn't expect
much more from the old comic
books, did we?


Christopher Reeve plays the title character in Superman, now playing at the Park Theater in Menlo Park.
The last hour or so of Super
man is sheer comic book fun,
with the kind of drive that used
to (or perhaps still does) make
you keep poring through
stacks of comics at the local
drugstore.
And there's something to
that kind of drive; it's enough
to power this excessively
budgeted "Big Movie."
Superman, though, is hardly
great, and you often hate it, but
it's got enough comic book
sense to be a success.
