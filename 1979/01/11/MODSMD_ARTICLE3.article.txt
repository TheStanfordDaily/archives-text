Will Lake Lag become a lake this
year?
It takes nine to ten inches of rain
fall each season to fill Lake Lagunita
with overflow from two lakes higher
in the foothills, said |ason Mavis, di
rector of Service Operations.
The Bay Area received more than
three inches so far this year, and if
weather predictions for rain hold,
the lake should fill sometime before
the end of February, according to
Mavis.
Lake Lag filled in December last
year for the first time after two years
of drought.
The lake holds approximately 100
million gallons of water, according to
Water Department Supervisor Joe
Carrington. But the water depart
ment never tries to fill it beyond 100
million gallons, so there will be no
overflow in case of late rain, he said.
When full, the lake loses two mill
ion gallons of water each day — one
million from evaporation and one
million by percolation or absorption
into the water table.
Drainage from two lakes higher in
the hills, both on University prop
erty, provide most of Lake Lagunita's

water supply. Searsville Lake, a
biological reserve located off San
dhill Road behind the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, holds 265
million gallons. Felt Lake, about a
mile from Highway 280, holds 343
million gallons.
Searsville requires two to three in
ches of rain while Felt needs four to
six inches to fill completely. Water
from these lakes runs into two
natural rivers, San Francisquito and
Los Trancos, which the University
taps with man-made waterways cal
led "flumes."
