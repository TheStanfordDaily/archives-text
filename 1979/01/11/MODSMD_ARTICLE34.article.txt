Iranian head foresees shah exit
Tehran, Iran — Prime Minister Shahpour Bakht
iar was quoted yesterday as saying that Iran faces
the danger of a military coup, but that he still
expects the shah to leave the country.
"At the moment the country is facing on the one
hand corrupt governments of the last 25 years
which violated the rights of the Iranian people and
on the other hand is facing the threat of a military
coup," the Persian newspaper Kayhan quoted
him.
Rumors spread over the capital in recent days
that military commanders deeply loyal to Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi might attempt a repeat of
the events of August 1953 when unrest plagued the
nation. At that time the monarch was forced to
leave the country, returning three days later when
the miltary had seized power.
Bakhtiar was quoted as saying the shah would be
leaving the country, ostensibly for rest and medi
cal treatment.
"Not only will I not prevent the shah from going
abroad," Bakhtiar was quoted, "but I personally
suggested this and this has been one of the condi
tions under which I accepted the premiership."
The United States, meanwhile, will send a small
squadron of 12 F-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia for a
"relatively short period" this month to demonstrate
American support for Saudi security, U.S. Defense
Department officials said yesterday.
UN to review Cambodian claims
United Nations — The Security Council agreed
last night to hold a public meeting on the fleeing
Cambodian government's charge of Vietnamese
aggression, U.N. spokeswoman Marcia Pinchas
announced.
She said the session will open this afternoon and
at that time the council will decide if it will hear
Prince Norodom Sihanouk as the representative of
the Cambodian government ousted by
Vietnamese-backed Cambodian rebels.
Sihanouk said he wanted the council to tell Vie
tnam to pull its troops out of Cambodia.
Sihanouk came to the United Nations on behalf
of the government that fled Phnom Penh when the
rebels, with strong support from the Vietnamese
army, seized the capital and announced formation
of a rival government.
U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young argued for the
council to take up the issue.
Referring to the defeated government, Young
said, "We strongly condemn the government for
its human rights position, but there is something
to be said for respecting the territorial integrity of a
nation in spite of what we think of that nation.
Vietnam concerns U.S. officials
Washington — The United States is concerned
that Vietnam may try to spread its influence to
other Southeast Asian countries now that it is the
dominant force in what was once French In
dochina.
That, according to one knowledgeable U.S. offi
cial, is "the biggest unanswered question" in the
region after the unseating of the Pol Pot regime in
Cambodia by Vietnam-led rebels.
If Vietnam tries to extend its reach, the U.S. view

is that the Hanoi government probably would not
use troops, as it did in Cambodia, but conduct its
assault through local Communist parties or by acts
of subversion.
However, there is no firm conclusion within the
administration that Vietnam will follow an aggres
sive course against Thailand, Malaysia and other
neighbors. And the administration is relying on
the inner strength of these countries.
Federal judge halts steel strike
Pittsburgh — A federal judge ordered yesterday
that dissident steel haulers end a violent nine
week strike. He threatened to jail the group's
leaders if the order is ignored.
U.S. District Judge Louis Rosenberg ordered the
Pittsburgh-based Fraternal Association of Steel
Haulers (FASH) to notify all of its members within
48 hours to end the strike, which touched off hun
dreds of shootings, stonings and tire slashings in
steel country.
William Hill, chairman of the association, said
the decision would be appealed.
The judge found FASH in contempt of a 1971
injunction and also threatened to jail Hill and
FASH VicePresidentßobert Trent if the ruling is not
obeyed.
Since the strike began Nov. 11, state police in
Pennsylvania alone have counted more than 400
incidents of violence involving truckers.
FASH, however, has denied responsibility for
the violence.
"Such a disclaimer is incredible in the face of the
fact that immediately after the stoppage-strike be
came effective, identified FASH representa
tives. . .overtly participated in the manifestations and
threats," Rosenberg wrote in his 30-page opinion.
Rideouts reconciliate after trial
Salem, Ore. — John Rideout said yesterday that
his trial and acquittal on a charge of raping his wife
forced both of them to change their lives and in
spired them to give their marriage another try.
"I think both me and Greta have changed tre
mendously," said Rideout, 21, in a telephone in
terview at the restaurant where he works as a
cook. "I don't think we'd be together now if it was
not for the trial. It made us both see things average
people in this world don't get to see...lt helped us
to grow and learn.
Rideout was acquitted Dec. 27 after a six-day trial
in Marion County Circuit Court which cost an es
timated $9 000. The trial was believed to be the first
criminal prosecution of a husband charged with
raping his wife while they lived together. He was
tried under a 1977 change in Oregon law that
eliminated marital privilege as a defense to rape.
"The law is right," Rideout said. "It's a hard
thing for a person like me to come back and say he
belives the law is right when the law was used on
me."
Gacy pleads innocent to charges
Chicago — John Gacy Jr., who reportedly has
confessed to 32 sex-related slayings, yesterday en
tered innocent pleas to each of seven murder
charges contained in a grand jury indictment.
Circuit Court Judge Richard Fitzgerald ordered
that Gacy be examined to determine his compe

tency to stand trial and whether he was sane at the
time the slayings occurred. But he did not rule on a
defense motion to quash the indictments. Gacy's
attorney argued that the grand jurors' judgment
must have been tainted by news accounts of the
slayings.
Cook County sheriff's investigators have found
the bodies and skeletal remains of 26 young men
beneath the floor of Gacy's house in excavations
begun Dec. 21, when the stocky building contrac
tor was arrested.
Police investigators reportedly have said that
Gacy has told them that during a six-year period he
has killed 32 young men and teenagers after hav
ing sex with them.
The 29 bodies so far linked to Gacy are the
largest total of any mass murderer in the United
States in this century. So far, 10 of the bodies have
been identified, mostly through dental records.
Study reveals smoking dangers
Washington — Research has provided "over
whelming" evidence that cigarette smoking
causes lung cancer in both men and women and is
a major factor in heart disease, bronchitis, em
physema and other ills, the surgeon general said in
an exhaustive new report.
Surgeon General Julius Richmond said the "re
port's findings have grave public health implica
tions for women of all ages."
He cited soaring lung cancer rates among
women and risks posed by maternal smoking to
the fetus and newborn babies.
The surgeon general said women are dying from
lung cancer at rates three times as high as in 1964.
An estimated 21,900 women and 70,000 men died
from lung cancer in 1978. There were 45,838 lung
cancer deaths in 1964.
"This document reveals, with dramatic clarity,
that smoking is even more dangerous — indeed,
far more dangerous — than was supposed in
1964," declared HEW Secretary Joseph Califano Jr.
HEW estimates that although 54 million Ameri
cans still smoke, 30 million have quit since 1964,
and the percentage of adult smokers has dropped
from 42 percent then to an estimated 33 percent in
1978 — "its lowest recorded point in 30 years."
Total U.S. cigarette consumption actually fell
last year by 2 billion to 615 billion cigarettes — the
first drop in 10 years.
The smoking rate among men plummeted from
53 percent in 1964 t039 percent in 1978, but among
women it has remained "virtually unchanged at
about 30 percent," said Richmond.
