# Group to unify African students
## 
### ROBERT REED 
A new organization designed to
unify local African students has
been formed.
The Stanford African Students
Association (SASA) will start oper
ations sometime next week, ac
cording to a group spokesman.
Among other goals, the group
hopes to heighten student aware
ness in political and social issues
concerning Africans, and to pre
sent forums on these issues.
SASA, which has attracted
about 50 members so far, fulfills a
need in the growing African
community here, said spokesman
Nana Humasi. There are 83 Afri
can students enrolled here, from
17 different countries.
For the past few years, some
students have searched for a un
ifying theme for African students.
About three weeks ago, a group
such as SASA was proposed.
According to Humasi, a poten
tial problem in forming a "mean
ingful group of ths kind" is the
great variety of interests of the
backgrounds of African students.
But, Humasi said, the differences
among the many peoples are not
that significant.
"When you concentrate on
black Africa," Humasi said, "Afri
cans are not so different." Humasi
explained that, although the

people speak different languages,
the basis of the cultures are simi
lar.
"Africans are Africans," Humasi
said.
Although most of those who
have shown interest in SASA have
come from nations south of the
Sahara, Humasi emphasized that
the organization is "open to all
African students," including
South Africans.
"We don't consider South Af
rica to be any different," Humasi
said. SASA members feel South
Africa should be considered a
black country, he said.
Full voting membership in SASA
is open to all African students, fa
culty, and their families. Associate
membership is open to those of
African descent or anyone else
expressing an interest in the Afri
can community. Honorary mem
bership also will be granted to
those in the community who have
worked to improve the African
cause, according to Humasi.
The organization eventually
hopes to have an African House
constructed on campus, butthis is
a future goal.
Following ASSU recognition of
the group next week, SASA busi
ness will be handled from a desk
in the Black House.
