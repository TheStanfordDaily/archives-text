# Actor Perry stars
## 
### JOHN DOANE 
"My decision to come to Stanford was
based more on academics than athletics,"
said Wolfe Perry. "My parents wanted me to
get a good education."
Perry, a senior guard and one of the few
four-year starters in Stanford basketball his
tory is a drama major and has hopes for a
career in acting or directing. But despite his
scholastic leanings, the standout cager's re
cent on-court feats have earned him national
recognition, usually a rarity for Stanford bas
ketball players. Perry, however, will tell you
he gets the best of both worlds.
Perry gave what UCLA coach Gary Cunnin
gham called a "magnificent effort" in leading
the unranked Cards to a 75-72 upset over the
talent-packed Bruins on December 27. As a
result, last week the 6-foot-2, 175 lb. Perry
was named Sports Illustrated player of the
week and Northern California Player of the
Week. To top it all off, Perry was named Most
Valuable Player at the Cabrillo Classic bas
ketball tournament on Dec. 30. Not a bad
performance for a so-called "secondary" in
terest.
Perry's off-court performances have been
just as noteworthy. A talented actor, Perry
has a leading role in the upcoming Public
Broadcasting Service (PBS) series entitled Up
and Coming, which will air next fall. A drama
focusing on the life of an inner city youth, the
program is being filmed in San Francisco.
For someone with such diverse interests,
though, conflicts do arise. Says Perry, "Bas
ketball definitelytakes a lot of timeawayfrom
my work with drama. I'd like to be perform
ing off campus, but the only time I have is
during the spring." An Oakland native,
Lieutenant Wolfe Perry Jr. (his given name)
attended Oakland Tech High School where

he was named prep Ail-American. As a junior,
he led Tech to the prestigious Tournament of
Champions title and averaged 15 points per
game his senior year before entering Stan
ford.
"I came here with an open mind," he said.
"I didn't have any stereotypes of the stu
dents." Nevertheless, the academics, as he
expected, have been personally satisfying
though he dislikes the intensity of many stu
dents. "I don't like the attitude of some stu
dents here. They're too serious about study
ing and are often too shut off from the rest of
the world."
Perry also notes his dissatisfaction with the
ethnic theme house program at Stanford. He
says the situation is "not good" and "unheal
thy." "School," says Perry, "should be a
complete learping experience. When people
with similar backgrounds live together away
from the mainstream no one really learns
anything."
Because of the tremendous publicity given
his latest basketball exploits, Perry has been
suggested as possible pro basketball mate
rial. Perry concedes that playing pro would
be "fun," but insists that he's not really play
ing any differently than he had his first three
years. He says that he is "playing with as
much effort and concentration" as in earlier
years. "I think I stand out more because as a
senior the role of leader is put upon you."
The actor-athlete is not completely certain
of his future but says that he "would eventu
ally like to end up in some facet of drama." As
far as the past four years at Stanford are con
cerned, Lieutenant Wolfe Perryjr. has had no
real disappointments here. "I've been happy
here,", he said. "I'm very glad I came to Stan
ford." And as far as Dick Dißiaso and PBS is
concerned, he's not the only one.

"I didn't have any stereotypes of the stu
dents." Nevertheless, the academics, as he
expected, have been personally satisfying
though he dislikes the intensity of many stu
dents. "I don't like the attitude of some stu
dents here. They're too serious about study
ing and are often too shut off from the rest of
the world."
Perry also notes his dissatisfaction with the
ethnic theme house program at Stanford. He
says the situation is "not good" and "unheal
thy." "School," says Perry, "should be a
complete learping experience. When people
with similar backgrounds live together away
from the mainstream no one really learns
anything."
Because of the tremendous publicity given
his latest basketball exploits, Perry has been
suggested as possible pro basketball mate
rial. Perry concedes that playing pro would
be "fun," but insists that he's not really play
ing any differently than he had his first three
years. He says that he is "playing with as
much effort and concentration" as in earlier
years. "I think I stand out more because as a
senior the role of leader is put upon you."
The actor-athlete is not completely certain
of his future but says that he "would eventu
ally like to end up in some facet of drama." As
far as the past four years at Stanford are con
cerned, Lieutenant Wolfe Perryjr. has had no
real disappointments here. "I've been happy
here,", he said. "I'm very glad I came to Stan
ford." And as far as Dick Dißiaso and PBS is
concerned, he's not the only one.
