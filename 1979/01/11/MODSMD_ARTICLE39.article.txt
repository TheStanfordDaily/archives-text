# Cards shoot against Washington teams
## 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Most trips to Arizona are
quite pleasurable. Everyone
who goes there has the chance
to enjoy the warm, refreshing
climate and the beautiful,
abundant scenery.
Everyone, that is, except for
the Stanford basketball team.
The Cardinals' excursion to
the Grand Canyon State last
week met with disaster, as
Stanford dropped two Pacific
-10 Conference games, first to
Arizona 74-64 and then to
Arizona State 80-68.
Tonight the Cards return to
friendly Maples Pavilion,
where they are 6-1, to face
Washington State. Saturday
evening Washington provides
the opposition.
Now 7-6 overall and 1-3 in
Pac-10, the Cards hope to re
sume the winning habits they
displayed over Christmas vaca
tion when they won four of five
contests, including a 75-72
nail-biter over powerful UCLA.
That UCLA victory ranks
foremost in the minds of op
posing coaches when they talk
about Stanford. It means that
from now on, playing the
Cards will be no easy task.
Washington State coach
George Raveling, for example,
may use the Bruin victory as an
aid in motivating his players
against Stanford. "Because
they beat UCLA, I won't have
any trouble getting my kids up
for this game," said the
Cougars' mentor.
Actually, WSU never has
trouble getting "up" for any
game. Raveling, who has au
thored two basketball literary
classics ("War on the Boards"
and "A Rebounder's Work
shop"), knows how to prepare
a team.
In their most recent game
last Saturday the Cougars lost
to rival Washington, 57-56. The
Cougars nevertheless hold an
impressive 10-2 record, and
stand 2-1 in conference action.
"I'm extremely pleased with
our performance overall,"
Raveling said. "Anytime you're
10-2 you have to count your
blessings."
One large blessing Raveling
can be thankful for is 7-foot-2,
280-lb. post James Donaldson.

The mastodonic senior has
identical 13.5 averages in both
scoring and rebounding this
season. "He's a very big
player," Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso murmured.
Junior guard-wing Terry
Kelly tops the Cougars in scor
ing with a 16.4 average. Tough
on defense'and consistent on
offense, Kelly also averaged
13.0 points a year ago.
Wing Don Collins (6-6) is
another WSU VIP. Last year at
Maples the Cards stifled Col
lins until the final two and a half
minutes, when he poured in
four vital points to beat Stan
ford, 62-59. This year Collins is
scoring at a 14.6 clip and adds
6.5 rebounds per outing.

Donaldson and Collins are
essential to WSU's success.
Last Saturday against
Washington, both spent con
siderable time on the bench in
the second half because of foul
trouble. Raveling noted their
absences as key factors in the
Cougars' loss.
Freshman guard Bryan Rison
and junior post Stuart House
complete WSU's starting
lineup. Rison,as-11 sparkplug,
is averaging a creditable 9.7
points a game.
House, like Donaldson, is
structured in huge propor
tions: 6-11,230 lbs. He entered
WSU two years ago amid much
fanfare, but has averaged just
6.7 and 6.4 points a game in the
past two seasons. This year
House maintains a 6.8 scoring
figure and a 5.9 rebounding
average.

Guard Clyde Huntley and
wing John Preston a 6-8
bruiser are among WSU's
top men off the bench.
Stanford has not defeated
WSU since 1975, way back
when Howie Dallmar was
coaching, and Rich Kelley was
the Cards' star. Since then the
Cougars have defeated Stan
ford six consecutive times, the
last three by bare three-point
margins.
"We'll need superior de
fense to disrupt their passing
game offense," Raveling said
of the Cards. "They set good
screens and move well. We
must be able to control the
heart of their offense, that is,
(Kimberly) Belton, (Brian)
Welch and (Wolfe) Perry."
Stanford must be ready to
face a variety of defenses from
the Cougars, according to
Raveling. "We"ll play a combi
nation of defenses," he said.
"Man-to-man, zone, full-court
press we'll throw everything
but the kitchen sink at them
until we find one that works."
Washington, the Cards'
Saturday night foe, ended up
on the better half of the
aforementioned WSU
Washington game. It was
probably the biggest win of the
season for the 7-5 Huskies,
who are 2-1 in Pac-10 play.
Washington coach Marv
Harshman echoed Raveling's
new-found reverence for Stan
ford and its victory over UCLA.
"They're a good, tough
jDallclub," Harshman said.
"They beat UCLA, and I haven't
seen many teams do that."
Forwards Andra Griffin and
Stan Walker lead the Huskies'
scoring with 13.8 and 13.3 aver
ages, respectively. Griffin, a6-7
Minneapolis, Minn, native, has
improved markedly over last
season when he scored just 6.5
points a game.
Walker, on the other hand, is
in his third year as a starter. He
averages 6.3 rebounds a game
to go with his scoring.
Washington's starter in the
center spot will be either 6-8
James Woods or 7-2 Petur
Cudmundsson, who was born
in Reykjavik, Iceland.
Woods started all 27 games
last year, and is averaging 8.8

points and 7.3 rebounds a con
test this campaign. Gud
mundsson, however, was a
"real plus" in the triumph over
WSU, according to Harshman.
In that game, Gudmundsson
collected 12 points, nine re
bounds, and three blocked
shots.
Harshman has four capable
guards from which to choose,
including returning lettermen
Steve Matzen (7.2 scoring av
erage) and Don Vaughn (5.2).
Lorenzo Romar, averaging 6.1 a
game, and 6-4 Bob Fronk are
the other two Husky backcourt
men.
Unlike WSU, Washington
has had little success against
Stanford recently, losing its last

three games with the Cards.
"We haven't beaten them too
readily the last couple of
years," Harshman admits.
Harshman cited the same
trio of Cards Raveling did in
evaluating Stanford. "Belton
poses a problem for us posting
up and on the boards," Har
shman said. "Welch is a good
shooting freshman, and Perry
js having the greatest year of
his life."
The Cards, meanwhile, will
likely start their usual lineup at
the forward and guard spots.
Freshman Welch (6-7) main
tains one forecourt position.
Despite a slight shooting
slump "He's been a little
tentative lately," said Dißiaso
Welch is still firing with ac
curacy, averaging 12.7 points a
game and shooting 51.1 per
cent from the floor, mostly

from long distances.
The fiery Belton, averaging
14.1 points and 9.6 rebounds a
game, occupies the other for
ward spot. Dißiaso termed Bel
ton's play in the Arizona State
game as "outstanding" and
added, "Kimberly is probably
having his best year, but he's
gone sort of unnoticed with
everything Perry has done."
And Perry has done a lot. For
scoring 78 points against
UCLA, San Diego State and
lowa, he was named Player of
the Week by Sports Illustrated
last week.

Team captain Paul Giovac
chini rounds out the
backcourt. Giovacchini, the
Cards' leader in assists with 61,
needs to bounce back with a
strong effort after enduring
sub-par efforts in Arizona.
The center position con
tinues to be a question mark
for Stanford. Tom Schmalzried
(6-11) started the first eight
games, but his inconsistency
disenchanted Dißiaso, who
replaced Schmalzried with Jeff
Ryan after Ryan had fine games
off the bench against Seton
Hall and Harvard.

Upon entering the starting
lineup against UCLA, Ryan re
sponded by beating both the
Bruins on a layin with two sec
onds to go and San Diego State
on a last-second tip-in.
Except for those heroics,
however, Ryan didn't do sig
nificantly better than Schmal
zried, who turned in good per
formances against San Diego
State (12 points) and lowa
(eight points) in the Cabrillo
Classic.
Freshman Orlando Ward,
who improves with each game
and is 79 inches of exuberance,
could eventually start in the
pivot.
No matter who is in the
lineup, Stanford should be
ready to play. The Cards, like
most teams play better at
home.
"We need these two," Di-
Biaso asserted. "The players
are confident they're not
down at all."
Whatever you do, Coach,
don't reward them with a.trip
to Arizona.

ford, 62-59. This year Collins is
scoring at a 14.6 clip and adds
6.5 rebounds per outing.

Donaldson and Collins are
essential to WSU's success.
Last Saturday against
Washington, both spent con
siderable time on the bench in
the second half because of foul
trouble. Raveling noted their
absences as key factors in the
Cougars' loss.
Freshman guard Bryan Rison
and junior post Stuart House
complete WSU's starting
lineup. Rison,as-11 sparkplug,
is averaging a creditable 9.7
points a game.
House, like Donaldson, is
structured in huge propor
tions: 6-11,230 lbs. He entered
WSU two years ago amid much
fanfare, but has averaged just
6.7 and 6.4 points a game in the
past two seasons. This year
House maintains a 6.8 scoring
figure and a 5.9 rebounding
average.

Guard Clyde Huntley and
wing John Preston a 6-8
bruiser are among WSU's
top men off the bench.
Stanford has not defeated
WSU since 1975, way back
when Howie Dallmar was
coaching, and Rich Kelley was
the Cards' star. Since then the
Cougars have defeated Stan
ford six consecutive times, the
last three by bare three-point
margins.
"We'll need superior de
fense to disrupt their passing
game offense," Raveling said
of the Cards. "They set good
screens and move well. We
must be able to control the
heart of their offense, that is,
(Kimberly) Belton, (Brian)
Welch and (Wolfe) Perry."
Stanford must be ready to
face a variety of defenses from
the Cougars, according to
Raveling. "We"ll play a combi
nation of defenses," he said.
"Man-to-man, zone, full-court
press we'll throw everything
but the kitchen sink at them
until we find one that works."
Washington, the Cards'
Saturday night foe, ended up
on the better half of the
aforementioned WSU
Washington game. It was
probably the biggest win of the
season for the 7-5 Huskies,
who are 2-1 in Pac-10 play.
Washington coach Marv
Harshman echoed Raveling's
new-found reverence for Stan
ford and its victory over UCLA.
"They're a good, tough
jDallclub," Harshman said.
"They beat UCLA, and I haven't
seen many teams do that."
Forwards Andra Griffin and
Stan Walker lead the Huskies'
scoring with 13.8 and 13.3 aver
ages, respectively. Griffin, a6-7
Minneapolis, Minn, native, has
improved markedly over last
season when he scored just 6.5
points a game.
Walker, on the other hand, is
in his third year as a starter. He
averages 6.3 rebounds a game
to go with his scoring.
Washington's starter in the
center spot will be either 6-8
James Woods or 7-2 Petur
Cudmundsson, who was born
in Reykjavik, Iceland.
Woods started all 27 games
last year, and is averaging 8.8

points and 7.3 rebounds a con
test this campaign. Gud
mundsson, however, was a
"real plus" in the triumph over
WSU, according to Harshman.
In that game, Gudmundsson
collected 12 points, nine re
bounds, and three blocked
shots.
Harshman has four capable
guards from which to choose,
including returning lettermen
Steve Matzen (7.2 scoring av
erage) and Don Vaughn (5.2).
Lorenzo Romar, averaging 6.1 a
game, and 6-4 Bob Fronk are
the other two Husky backcourt
men.
Unlike WSU, Washington
has had little success against
Stanford recently, losing its last

three games with the Cards.
"We haven't beaten them too
readily the last couple of
years," Harshman admits.
Harshman cited the same
trio of Cards Raveling did in
evaluating Stanford. "Belton
poses a problem for us posting
up and on the boards," Har
shman said. "Welch is a good
shooting freshman, and Perry
js having the greatest year of
his life."
The Cards, meanwhile, will
likely start their usual lineup at
the forward and guard spots.
Freshman Welch (6-7) main
tains one forecourt position.
Despite a slight shooting
slump "He's been a little
tentative lately," said Dißiaso
Welch is still firing with ac
curacy, averaging 12.7 points a
game and shooting 51.1 per
cent from the floor, mostly

from long distances.
The fiery Belton, averaging
14.1 points and 9.6 rebounds a
game, occupies the other for
ward spot. Dißiaso termed Bel
ton's play in the Arizona State
game as "outstanding" and
added, "Kimberly is probably
having his best year, but he's
gone sort of unnoticed with
everything Perry has done."
And Perry has done a lot. For
scoring 78 points against
UCLA, San Diego State and
lowa, he was named Player of
the Week by Sports Illustrated
last week.

Team captain Paul Giovac
chini rounds out the
backcourt. Giovacchini, the
Cards' leader in assists with 61,
needs to bounce back with a
strong effort after enduring
sub-par efforts in Arizona.
The center position con
tinues to be a question mark
for Stanford. Tom Schmalzried
(6-11) started the first eight
games, but his inconsistency
disenchanted Dißiaso, who
replaced Schmalzried with Jeff
Ryan after Ryan had fine games
off the bench against Seton
Hall and Harvard.

Upon entering the starting
lineup against UCLA, Ryan re
sponded by beating both the
Bruins on a layin with two sec
onds to go and San Diego State
on a last-second tip-in.
Except for those heroics,
however, Ryan didn't do sig
nificantly better than Schmal
zried, who turned in good per
formances against San Diego
State (12 points) and lowa
(eight points) in the Cabrillo
Classic.
Freshman Orlando Ward,
who improves with each game
and is 79 inches of exuberance,
could eventually start in the
pivot.
No matter who is in the
lineup, Stanford should be
ready to play. The Cards, like
most teams play better at
home.
"We need these two," Di-
Biaso asserted. "The players
are confident they're not
down at all."
Whatever you do, Coach,
don't reward them with a.trip
to Arizona.


James Woods


Don Collins
Most trips to Arizona are
quite pleasurable. Everyone
who goes there has the chance
to enjoy the warm, refreshing
climate and the beautiful,
abundant scenery.
Everyone, that is, except for
the Stanford basketball team.
The Cardinals' excursion to
the Grand Canyon State last
week met with disaster, as
Stanford dropped two Pacific
-10 Conference games, first to
Arizona 74-64 and then to
Arizona State 80-68.
Tonight the Cards return to
friendly Maples Pavilion,
where they are 6-1, to face
Washington State. Saturday
evening Washington provides
the opposition.
Now 7-6 overall and 1-3 in
Pac-10, the Cards hope to re
sume the winning habits they
displayed over Christmas vaca
tion when they won four of five
contests, including a 75-72
nail-biter over powerful UCLA.
That UCLA victory ranks
foremost in the minds of op
posing coaches when they talk
about Stanford. It means that
from now on, playing the
Cards will be no easy task.
Washington State coach
George Raveling, for example,
may use the Bruin victory as an
aid in motivating his players
against Stanford. "Because
they beat UCLA, I won't have
any trouble getting my kids up
for this game," said the
Cougars' mentor.
Actually, WSU never has
trouble getting "up" for any
game. Raveling, who has au
thored two basketball literary
classics ("War on the Boards"
and "A Rebounder's Work
shop"), knows how to prepare
a team.
In their most recent game
last Saturday the Cougars lost
to rival Washington, 57-56. The
Cougars nevertheless hold an
impressive 10-2 record, and
stand 2-1 in conference action.
"I'm extremely pleased with
our performance overall,"
Raveling said. "Anytime you're
10-2 you have to count your
blessings."
One large blessing Raveling
can be thankful for is 7-foot-2,
280-lb. post James Donaldson.

The mastodonic senior has
identical 13.5 averages in both
scoring and rebounding this
season. "He's a very big
player," Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso murmured.
Junior guard-wing Terry
Kelly tops the Cougars in scor
ing with a 16.4 average. Tough
on defense'and consistent on
offense, Kelly also averaged
13.0 points a year ago.
Wing Don Collins (6-6) is
another WSU VIP. Last year at
Maples the Cards stifled Col
lins until the final two and a half
minutes, when he poured in
four vital points to beat Stan
ford, 62-59. This year Collins is
scoring at a 14.6 clip and adds
6.5 rebounds per outing.

improved markedly over last
season when he scored just 6.5
points a game.
Walker, on the other hand, is
in his third year as a starter. He
averages 6.3 rebounds a game
to go with his scoring.
Washington's starter in the
center spot will be either 6-8
James Woods or 7-2 Petur
Cudmundsson, who was born
in Reykjavik, Iceland.
Woods started all 27 games
last year, and is averaging 8.8

points and 7.3 rebounds a con
test this campaign. Gud
mundsson, however, was a
"real plus" in the triumph over
WSU, according to Harshman.
In that game, Gudmundsson
collected 12 points, nine re
bounds, and three blocked
shots.
Harshman has four capable
guards from which to choose,
including returning lettermen
Steve Matzen (7.2 scoring av
erage) and Don Vaughn (5.2).
Lorenzo Romar, averaging 6.1 a
game, and 6-4 Bob Fronk are
the other two Husky backcourt
men.
Unlike WSU, Washington
has had little success against
Stanford recently, losing its last

three games with the Cards.
"We haven't beaten them too
readily the last couple of
years," Harshman admits.
Harshman cited the same
trio of Cards Raveling did in
evaluating Stanford. "Belton
poses a problem for us posting
up and on the boards," Har
shman said. "Welch is a good
shooting freshman, and Perry
js having the greatest year of
his life."
The Cards, meanwhile, will
likely start their usual lineup at
the forward and guard spots.
Freshman Welch (6-7) main
tains one forecourt position.
Despite a slight shooting
slump "He's been a little
tentative lately," said Dißiaso
Welch is still firing with ac
curacy, averaging 12.7 points a
game and shooting 51.1 per
cent from the floor, mostly

from long distances.
The fiery Belton, averaging
14.1 points and 9.6 rebounds a
game, occupies the other for
ward spot. Dißiaso termed Bel
ton's play in the Arizona State
game as "outstanding" and
added, "Kimberly is probably
having his best year, but he's
gone sort of unnoticed with
everything Perry has done."
And Perry has done a lot. For
scoring 78 points against
UCLA, San Diego State and
lowa, he was named Player of
the Week by Sports Illustrated
last week.

Team captain Paul Giovac
chini rounds out the
backcourt. Giovacchini, the
Cards' leader in assists with 61,
needs to bounce back with a
strong effort after enduring
sub-par efforts in Arizona.
The center position con
tinues to be a question mark
for Stanford. Tom Schmalzried
(6-11) started the first eight
games, but his inconsistency
disenchanted Dißiaso, who
replaced Schmalzried with Jeff
Ryan after Ryan had fine games
off the bench against Seton
Hall and Harvard.

Upon entering the starting
lineup against UCLA, Ryan re
sponded by beating both the
Bruins on a layin with two sec
onds to go and San Diego State
on a last-second tip-in.
Except for those heroics,
however, Ryan didn't do sig
nificantly better than Schmal
zried, who turned in good per
formances against San Diego
State (12 points) and lowa
(eight points) in the Cabrillo
Classic.
Freshman Orlando Ward,
who improves with each game
and is 79 inches of exuberance,
could eventually start in the
pivot.
No matter who is in the
lineup, Stanford should be
ready to play. The Cards, like
most teams play better at
home.
"We need these two," Di-
Biaso asserted. "The players
are confident they're not
down at all."
Whatever you do, Coach,
don't reward them with a.trip
to Arizona.


James Woods


Don Collins
Most trips to Arizona are
quite pleasurable. Everyone
who goes there has the chance
to enjoy the warm, refreshing
climate and the beautiful,
abundant scenery.
Everyone, that is, except for
the Stanford basketball team.
The Cardinals' excursion to
the Grand Canyon State last
week met with disaster, as
Stanford dropped two Pacific
-10 Conference games, first to
Arizona 74-64 and then to
Arizona State 80-68.
Tonight the Cards return to
friendly Maples Pavilion,
where they are 6-1, to face
Washington State. Saturday
evening Washington provides
the opposition.
Now 7-6 overall and 1-3 in
Pac-10, the Cards hope to re
sume the winning habits they
displayed over Christmas vaca
tion when they won four of five
contests, including a 75-72
nail-biter over powerful UCLA.
That UCLA victory ranks
foremost in the minds of op
posing coaches when they talk
about Stanford. It means that
from now on, playing the
Cards will be no easy task.
Washington State coach
George Raveling, for example,
may use the Bruin victory as an
aid in motivating his players
against Stanford. "Because
they beat UCLA, I won't have
any trouble getting my kids up
for this game," said the
Cougars' mentor.
Actually, WSU never has
trouble getting "up" for any
game. Raveling, who has au
thored two basketball literary
classics ("War on the Boards"
and "A Rebounder's Work
shop"), knows how to prepare
a team.
In their most recent game
last Saturday the Cougars lost
to rival Washington, 57-56. The
Cougars nevertheless hold an
impressive 10-2 record, and
stand 2-1 in conference action.
"I'm extremely pleased with
our performance overall,"
Raveling said. "Anytime you're
10-2 you have to count your
blessings."
One large blessing Raveling
can be thankful for is 7-foot-2,
280-lb. post James Donaldson.

The mastodonic senior has
identical 13.5 averages in both
scoring and rebounding this
season. "He's a very big
player," Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso murmured.
Junior guard-wing Terry
Kelly tops the Cougars in scor
ing with a 16.4 average. Tough
on defense'and consistent on
offense, Kelly also averaged
13.0 points a year ago.
Wing Don Collins (6-6) is
another WSU VIP. Last year at
Maples the Cards stifled Col
lins until the final two and a half
minutes, when he poured in
four vital points to beat Stan
ford, 62-59. This year Collins is
scoring at a 14.6 clip and adds
6.5 rebounds per outing.

Donaldson and Collins are
essential to WSU's success.
Last Saturday against
Washington, both spent con
siderable time on the bench in
the second half because of foul
trouble. Raveling noted their
absences as key factors in the
Cougars' loss.
Freshman guard Bryan Rison
and junior post Stuart House
complete WSU's starting
lineup. Rison,as-11 sparkplug,
is averaging a creditable 9.7
points a game.
House, like Donaldson, is
structured in huge propor
tions: 6-11,230 lbs. He entered
WSU two years ago amid much
fanfare, but has averaged just
6.7 and 6.4 points a game in the
past two seasons. This year
House maintains a 6.8 scoring
figure and a 5.9 rebounding
average.

Guard Clyde Huntley and
wing John Preston a 6-8
bruiser are among WSU's
top men off the bench.
Stanford has not defeated
WSU since 1975, way back
when Howie Dallmar was
coaching, and Rich Kelley was
the Cards' star. Since then the
Cougars have defeated Stan
ford six consecutive times, the
last three by bare three-point
margins.
"We'll need superior de
fense to disrupt their passing
game offense," Raveling said
of the Cards. "They set good
screens and move well. We
must be able to control the
heart of their offense, that is,
(Kimberly) Belton, (Brian)
Welch and (Wolfe) Perry."
Stanford must be ready to
face a variety of defenses from
the Cougars, according to
Raveling. "We"ll play a combi
nation of defenses," he said.
"Man-to-man, zone, full-court
press we'll throw everything
but the kitchen sink at them
until we find one that works."
Washington, the Cards'
Saturday night foe, ended up
on the better half of the
aforementioned WSU
Washington game. It was
probably the biggest win of the
season for the 7-5 Huskies,
who are 2-1 in Pac-10 play.
Washington coach Marv
Harshman echoed Raveling's
new-found reverence for Stan
ford and its victory over UCLA.
"They're a good, tough
jDallclub," Harshman said.
"They beat UCLA, and I haven't
seen many teams do that."
Forwards Andra Griffin and
Stan Walker lead the Huskies'
scoring with 13.8 and 13.3 aver
ages, respectively. Griffin, a6-7
Minneapolis, Minn, native, has
improved markedly over last
season when he scored just 6.5
points a game.
Walker, on the other hand, is
in his third year as a starter. He
averages 6.3 rebounds a game
to go with his scoring.
