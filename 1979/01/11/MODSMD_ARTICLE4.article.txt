# Ex-Premier reportedly killed
## Pol Pot strongholds attacked 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — The Viet
namese army yesterday battled re
maining strongholds of the van
quished Pol Pot government whose
forces still had shaky control of about
20 percent of Cambodia, Western
sources said.
The Soviet Union and some of its
allies recognized the Vietnam
backed provisional government in
Phnom Penh. China condemned the
Soviets, while some Southeast Asian
nations called on the U.N. Security
Council to restore peace.
Sources in Thailand said there
were reports ex-Premier Pol Pot,
whose repressive government was
condemned by almost everyone but
China, had been killed in fighting in
northwestern Cambodia. But Japan's
Kyodo news service reported from
Peking that Chinese Vice Foreign
Minister Chung FJsi-tung told Japan's
ambassador Pol Pot was alive in
Cambodia.
Air strikes
Western sources said Vietnamese
air strikes, reported at about 100 a
day Tuesday, had lessened.
Thai sources said a Vietnamese di
vision was pushing against Siem
Reap, 260 miles west of the
Vietnamese-Cambodian border and
90 miles from Thailand. The 9th cen
tury temples of Angkor — a symbol
of Cambodian nationalism — are
near the town.
Kyodo's report said Japan's ambas
sador was told Vietnamese troops
had occupied Siem Reap and Bat
tambang, a key center and airfield
site.
Thai and Western sources, how

ever, said the two towns had not
been taken and that a third city, Pur
sat, may be controlled by the ousted
leaders. Gunfire could be heard at
the Thailand-Cambodia border.
Sources said the Vietnamese
onslaught that began less than three
weeks ago left some pockets of resis
tance, but that the Vietnamese cap
tured about 25 China-supplied
warplanes and World War II U.S.
bombers.
Vietnam maintains that a Cambo
dian rebel movement called the Na
tional United Front for National Sal
vation, led by President Heng Sam
rin, overthrew Pol Pot. But Western
sources say Vietnamese troops
backed by tanks, howitzers and air
support, did most of the fighting.
Reporters at the border said solid
ers of the ousted government gave

border officials at Aranyaprathet, 124
miles west of Bangkok, a letter to the
Thai Foreign Ministry signed by ex-
Deputy Premier leng Sary.
There was speculation the letter
was a request for asylum.
In New York, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, a former Cambodian head
of state who had been under house
arrest by Pol Pot, met with U.N.
Secretry-Ceneral Kurt Waldheim and
Security Council president Donald
Mills of Jamaica.
The Pol Pot government forced
evacuation of Cambodia's cities and
villages and sent most Cambodians
to communal farms after the 1975
Khmer Rouge Communist victory
over the U.S.-backed Lon Nol gov
ernment.
Millions were said to have died in
the process.
