# Coaches play the recruiting game
## 
### RICK OSTILLER 
There is a game going on in
college basketball besides the
one on the court. It's the re
cruiting game, and playing it
well for just one year can make
even a mediocre program suc
cessful for several seasons.
There are many good college
coaches, but they all have one
common trait. They cannot win
without good players. Thus
they must all play the recruiting
game.
At Stanford, the three-man
recruiting team consists of

coach Dick Dißiaso and assis
tants Ken Maxey and Tim Mil
ler.
All three are involved in the
early stages of recruiting, with
Dißiaso handling the top pros
pects. Eventually, one coach
will establish a relationship
with a player and recruit him
until the athlete chooses a
school. If the player decides to
attend Stanford, Dißiaso hand
les the signing of the letter of
intent, which obligates the
player to the school.
"The letter of intent insures

that the athlete doesn't make a
commitment to a university,
then back out and go to
another one," Miller
explained.
Once a player signs a letter
of intent he cannot be ap
proached by another school.
However, should an athlete
transfer to another university
after signing a letter of intent,
he faces a loss of one year of
eligibility. He can only retain
his eligibility if he goes instead
to a junior college.
Stanford, like many colleges

today, has one black assistant,
Maxey, and one white assis
tant, Miller. Some schools
employ a black assistant to re
cruit blacks while the white as
sistant recruits whites, but Mil
ler denied that this happens at
Stanford.
One recruiting advantage for
Card coaches is Stanford's
academic reputation. Recruit
ers here can use the academic
program as well as the basket
ball program to lure athletes.
One of this year's freshmen
recruits, Terry Smith, said,
"Athletes realize it's harder to
say no to a school like Stanford
where the education will help
them after they graduate."
In the past, many institutions
would try to fool high school
players, but Smith said that is
harder to do today.
"Athletes are more aware of
false selling and recruiting
techniques because many
were recruited out of junior
high school to high school.
They are better equipped to
deal with recruiters, and they
don't just jump at the first of
fer," Smith said.
Miller agreed. "Players today
are more knowledgeable than
they were 10 years ago. Our re
cruits have their priorities in
order and things in perspec
tive."
Like any other game, the re
cruiting contest needs rules.

With mounting demands for
successful programs, pres
sures on recruiters have be
come almost unbearable. To
preserve order, the NCAA has
established several regula
tions.
The rules limit a recruit to six
paid 48-hour visits to colleges
across the country, but no
more than one to any single
school. In addition, the school
can make three official visits to
the player's home. Under no
circumstances can the player
accept a gift.
By far the most controversial
and most violated rule involves
bumping. Miller defined a
bump as when "a coach from,
an institution has an encounter
with a player which was not
scheduled or prearranged." A
meeting in the locker room
after a high school game is one
example. A team is allowed
only three bumps on any
player, although the rule is
very difficult to enforce.
Despite the rules, recruiting
stakes are high, and violations
are inevitable. The NCAA has
begun a crackdown, however,
by placing several schools on
probation and thus making
them ineligible for post-season
play. The crackdown and the
penalties have had a positive
effect, according to Smith.
"Coaches are getting more
