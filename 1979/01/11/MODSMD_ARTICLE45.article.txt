# Marty emerges
## 
### DAVID SEAMAN 
"Everything is a new ex
perience." For a Stanford
freshman, this is a typical
statement, but it is espe
cially true for one Branner
resident named Doug
Marty. Marty is a varsity
basketball player on The
Farm.

Although not a starter,
the 6-foot-2 guard has
played quite well during his
brief tenure here. And he
has an impressive record to
help his future prospects.
He graduated from Long
Beach's Millikan High
School after playing three
years on the varsity team. In
his junior and senior years,
he led his team to the
playoffs and was honored
with selection to both the
all-league and all-CIF post
season teams.
Marty has played basket
ball as long as he can re
member; "probably ever
since I could dribble," he
guessed.
Five years ago Marty at
tended a Bill Sharman camp
in Los Angeles and was
coached there by Ken Mor
gan, the physical therapist
at Cowell Student Health
Center. According to Mor
gan, former LA Laker coach
Sharman used footage of
Marty in a basketball fun
damentals.film.

"Sharman took Matty out
and let him shoot while he
narrated. Marty was a very
coachable kid even then
and looked super," Morgan
said.
Of his former player now,
Morgan said: "In the first
game I saw him (against
Santa Barbara), he did great.
He was especially impres
sive on defense. And, obvi
ously, he is an excellent
shooter . . . but at the mo
ment that's not his job be

cause he's still a freshman.
Perry's the shooter."
Accustomed to constant
play in high school, Marty
said he finds it frustrating
not to play a lot here. "But I
realize the position I am in,"
he said. "I think I can do the
job, but we have two senior
guards. I also want to im
prove in a few things, like
ball handling, forexample."
These essential ingre
dients of the game have not
changed for Marty since
leaving high school, but he
said he feels that the atmos
phere surrounding the
game is different here.
"Everything is on a grea
ter scale here. It almost
seems like big~business. The
intensity surrounding the
game is increased, but the
game is still fun."
Marty said he is not plan
ning a life in basketball.
Concentrating on his
scholastic education he is
taking a variety of courses to
determine his preferences
and said he is leaning to
ward a liberal arts major.
"I find that I have to or
ganize my time better be
cause there's less time to
mess around and always
something to be done," he
said.
Marty looks ahead to the
future with optimism.
"The team is really play
ing well at home. It is much
more a total team effort.
We've got a team goal and
we'll continuetoplayhard. I
can only see improve
ment," he said.
