### RICH MARTINEZ 
In this age of highly pub
licized and glorified athletes, it
is hard to find a truly humble'
benchwarmer, much less a
humble star. One such rarity is
Jeanne Ruark, center for the
women's basketball team.
Such a weighty statement
requires some support. Ruark
has scored an average of 25
points per game, including a
season high 35 against Cal State
Northridge. Her shooting per
centage is over 60 percent from
the floor and 85 percent from
the foul line, and she has aver
aged 17 rebounds a game. In
fact, she has done everything
except clean up the gym after
the game. _But then, why
should she? Ruark cleans up
enough on the court during
the contest.
Why such raves all of a sud
den? Where was she last year
and why have few people
heard of her? Because Ruark
was leading her team to a state
crown while earning Alabama
Player of Year honors and spots
on several All-America teams.
She is only a freshman. No
wonder Head Coach Dotty
McCrea has been in such a
good mood of late.
Led by Ruark and fellow
wunderkind Angie Paccione,
the Cardinals are undefeated
through eight games. This is
nothing new for Ruark,
though.
"Through all my years in
high school and thus far at
Stanford, I haven't lost a game
yet. I really don't know what
it's like," she said. It's not that
I'm not prepared to lose at
Stanford. I wil-l never learn to
take a loss complacently. If we
play to our highest capacities
and are simply beaten by a bet
ter team, I'll accept it, but it's
giving a game away to a lesser
team that would really bother
me."
The way that Ruark came to
Stanford is as amazing as her
stats.
"I was given some good of
fers from eastern schools with
fine reputations in basketball
programs but not in
academics. When considering
Stanford, I was very much im
pressed with their scholastic
reputation, and I knew I'd be
able to play ball. It was a deci

sion between having a good
time or receiving a good edu
cation."
While some freshmen had
trouble just adjusting to the
new environment, Ruark has
had to move,to California while
her parents travelled overseas
for business, take a challeng
ing academic load and play
basketball on top of it all.
"I enjoy being very busy,"
she said. "If I just had my
school work to do I know I
would procrastinate and sim
ply waste a lot of free time. As it
is, I don't have much time to
waste, and I do a better job
with everything."
Ruark contends that if she
had more self-confidence, she
would be a better player. Dis
cussing the other players' ta
lents, Ruark cannot say enough
good things about her team
mates.
Although she devotes so
much of her energy to basket
ball, the freshman star detests
being treated solely as an
athlete.
"I know it gives others a
chance to break the ice. But my
life is made up of more than
shots and rebounds. I want
people to like all of me not
just the basketball player in
me. When basketball is over,
I'll have a chance to devote
moretimeto school life. Hope
fully, that will help change
things," she said.
If asked one particular ques
tion, though, she will answer
with the utmost confidence
and assertiveness:
"Of course, we'll be the
best. One of these years there
will be no doubt that we'll be
on top. There's just so much
talent, unity, good leadership
and coaching with this group
that everyone also has that
special feeling."
