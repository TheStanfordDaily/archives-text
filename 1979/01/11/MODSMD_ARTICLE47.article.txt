# Rojcewicz assists Cards

### JULIE HILL 
Her last name may be hard to pronounce, but
assistant coach Sue Rojcewicz has few problems
articulating her opinions about women's bas
ketball and the part she's played as a member
and coach of several teams. Rojcewicz's playing
career began as a junior in high school and cul
minated as a member of the U.S. women's team
which participated in the '76 Olympics in
Montreal.
Between those momentous occasions, Roj
cewicz attended Worcester State College in
Massachusetts and Southern Connecticut State
College in New Haven. Southern Connecticut's
women's basketball team placed third in the
nation one year.
In the summer of '75, Rojcewicz played forthe
U.S. team in the Pan Am tournament in Mexico
City and the World Championship in Columbia.
Between the summer of '75 and her Olympic
games, Rojcewicz attended grad school at Penn
State where she was the assistant coach of the
women's team.
Since then, Rojcewicz has been the assistant
coach of the currently undefeated Stanford
women's team. When asked how women's bas
ketball and the players have changed over the
years, she quickly said, "The girls are more ex
perienced now some junior high school

programs have them playing 20 games a sea
son." She said she felt that the number of good
players has increased. While there were good
players before, the number has increased sig
nificantly in the last decade.
Concerning changes in strategy, Rojcewicz
said that the "coaches are able to become more
sophisticated" because the girls are better.
Also, since the advent of full-time women
coaches, she found that coaches can now de
vote more of their time to the team and, thus,
better quality emerges in the women's play.
One change Rojcewicz found disturbing was
i n the attitudes of the women players today. She
said she felt a change had come about with the
availability of athletic scholarships for women.
Rojcewicz said that players are not always out
just because they like to play, but they're also
eyeing the external benefits and that this may be
"hurting their game."
"Stanford looks very good this year in terms of
an excellent recruiting season," added Roj
cewicz, who is in charge of the recruiting and
scouting in addition to helping coach the team.
This year, nine freshmen form the nucleus for
the Cardinal team, and their record speaks well
for Rojcewicz and Head Coach Dotty McCrea.
Tough opponents in upcoming games include
USF, San Jose State and Cal.
