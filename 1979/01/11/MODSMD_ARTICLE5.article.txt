# Financial aid critique to be next month
## 
### KATHY ANDREWS 
Sophomore David Aladjem has
been selected to attend the second
annual Student-Commissioner Con
ference on Financial Aid Issues in
Washington D.C. next month.
Funded by the U.S. Office of Edu
cation (OE), the conference brings
together 55 student leaders selected
by a committee of sponsors with OE
staff, financial aid policy makers,
administrators and interns.
The three-day conference is de
signed to provide the OE with a con
sumer review of the $3 billion spent
in federal grant, work and loan prog
rams. It also serves to build a net
work of experienced students work
ing to shape federal financial aid
policies.
National group
Aladjem said he first became in
volved with the financial aid system
as a senior in high school. "I was very
intimidated by the length, multiplic
ity and complexity of the forms," he
said.
Aladjem said he consulted the
Council of Presidents about ways he
could become involved in financial
aid policy issues and was referred to
the Coalition of Independent Col
lege and University Students
(COPUS). COPUS is a national stu
dent association designed to lobby
for students' interests and to raise
student consciousness about finan
cial aid issues.
"I really feel that no one who is
qualfied to go to a school, especially
one like Stanford, should be denied
the opportunity on the basis of fi
nancial problems," he said.
"My internship with COPUS and
my follow-up work allowed me to dig
deeper into financial aid issues,"
Aladjem said.
System 'confusing'
"I've reached two conclusions,"
he said. "First, the aid system is very,
very confusing â€” the only people
who understand it are adminis
trators. Secondly, the aid delivery
system is not designed with the con
venience of the student in mind."
Aladjem explained that while the
standard four-page financial aid form
with attached direction booklet is
convenient for national level ad
ministrators to process, high school
seniors find it "very unclear and
complicated."
On the other hand, students who

have used an experimental nine
page application form with incorpo
rated instructions found it easier to
understand. Administrators have not
used this form because it would
prove extremely cumbersome, Alad
jem said.
The procedure for the allocation of
funds to schools is another example
of an inherent inequity in the finan
cial aid system, Aladjem said. The
quantity of aid from the government
to a given school can vary according
to the "grantsmanship" skills of its
financial aid officers. Thus students
interested in attending schools with
"poorer" officers can sufferan unfair
disadvantage in attempting to obtain
aid, he said.
Aladjem added that the University
does a relatively good job in provid
ing financial aid to undergraduates
through both government and Uni
versity funding.
Wanted to confer
Aladjem said he applied to the con
ference because he wanted to learn
more about the financial aid process,
the state of financial aid programs
around the country and the OE's ac
tivities. He also wanted to confer
with other students and adminis
trators involved in financial aid policy
issues.
Conference participants will for
mulate recommendations for the OE
and Congress.
Conference Coordinator Layton
Olson estimated that two-thirds of
the conference participants' recom
mendations will pertain to internal
policy changes which can be effected
by the OE, such as the possible estab
lishment of a peer counseling system
in th OE. Other recommendations
will involve larger political ques
tions, like the issue of whether the
OE should make direct loans to stu
dents who cannot obtain them from
banks. This would require congres
sional action.
"One of the biggest things that
came out of the conference was the
students' support of policy revision
on financial aid for independent stu
dents," Olson said.
He explained that previously self
supporting students' assets had not
been treated like those of parents of
dependent students, even though
both groups share similar financial
responsibilities.
