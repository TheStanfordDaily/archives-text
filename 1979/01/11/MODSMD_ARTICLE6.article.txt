# Gift pool here ranks second to Harvard
## Persistence pays off for fundraisers 
### MICHAEL KOHN 
As large gifts become more
and more essential to the fi
nancial survival of private uni
versities, the problems in
volved in soliciting and accept
ing these gifts become increas
ingly important and controver
sial.
About one-third of the Uni
versity's operating costs are
paid by gifts and income from
previous gifts.
More than $54.5 million was
given to the University last fis
cal year. The year before
marked the conclusion of the
$300 million Campaign for
Stanford, and the University
received a record $56.1 million.
This represents more than
the generosity of alumni and
friends; it represents a large
and effective program of gift
solicitation.
The Office of Development
runs fundraising operations
here. It has 165 employees and
a nationwide network of volun
teers. The people involved try
to inform every available
alumnus of the University's
needs and to convince them to
donate money.
Jon Cosovich, director of the
major gift program here, esti
mated that 85 percent of all gift
money comes from "major
gifts" of $25,000 or more.
Special attention is given to
prospective donors with the
capability to make a major gift.
Identifying these prospects re
quires research into their fi
nancial backgrounds and their
interests.
"We try to identify who has
the capacity to make major
gifts. We try to find out who
our customer is," said
Cosovich.
This became a controversial
subject recently, when The
Wall Street Journal reported
that Yale's research is surpris
ingly extensive. According to
the article, Yale researchers
examine public records includ
ing house assessments, di
vorce settlements and wills in
which the potential donors are
mentioned. They also gather
"more obscure information,"
including, in one case, an au
topsy report of a research sub
ject's father and, in another
case, the subject's living ar
rangements.

All fundraisers agree that re
search is necessary. The ques
tion is how far it should go.
"Stanford does not do any
where near the type or depth
of the research that is de
scribed in that article, out of
respect for the privacy for the
individual," said Bill Dailey,
major gifts director for north
ern California.
Stanford's researchers use
"strictly public information,"
according to Abbie Von
Schlegel who works under
Dailey.
"I thought all that stuff (in
the Wall Street Journal article)
was absolutely appalling," said
Von Schlegel. "They just dug
their own graves, first by doing
stuff like that and then by tel
ling people about it."
Office of Development per
sonnel said they don't gather

some forms of public informa
tion such as divorce settle
ments, tax assessments and
causes of parents' death.
"I've never been to the
county assessor's office," said
Von Schlegel.
Researchers here use the
common reference books and
business indexes such as
Who's Who, Standard and
Poor's Register, and Walker's
Manual of Western Corpora
tions, according to Cosovich.
They also check proxy state
ments to learn the salaries of
prospective donors who are
top corporate officers.
Part of research is accurately
keeping records, said
Cosovich. "If you invite a
prospective donor to a number
of library events and he consis
tently says 'no,' then you don't
ask him to donate a library."
Often major donors want to
specify the use of donated
money. The donors try to set
conditions on their gifts which
the University deems unac
ceptable.

In 1963 Stanford refused gift
offers from two individuals
who stipulated that use of the
funds be designated or ap
proved at a later date by direc
tors of the Winds of Freedom
Foundation. This foundation
was organized to support the
"many faculty members whose
philosophies are pro-
American."
The University Board of Trus
tees refused the donation, stat
ing, "The board cannot sur
render or divide the responsi
bility and authority for control
ling the University's affairs, in
cluding the solicitation and ac
ceptance of gifts and the de
terminations of their use. One
aspect of this policy is that gifts
tendered to the University and
not exclusively subject to Uni
versity control cannot be ac
cepted."

Major gifts "are almost al
ways designated for a specific
purpose," according to David
Fulton, director of communi
cations. "We try to persuade
the donors to be as broad as
possible in their specifica
tions."
The degree of restriction
which the University allows is
best exemplified by its policy
for handling endowed profes
sorships. The donor of an en
dowed professorship may
specify the area of study but
not the professorwho will hold
the chair.
Gifts usually come with re
strictions as to the area in
which they can be spent. "That
isn't a restriction which trou
bles us," said Joel Smith, vice
president of development, but
"we do not yield with respect
to faculty appointments or
shaping the academic prog
ram."
The gift must also fit the
needs of the University. "We
won't take a gift of $1 million
unless it is consistent with the

goals and objectives of the
University," said Cosovich.
There is disagreement bet
ween some of the faculty and
the Office of Development
over what those goals and ob
jectives should be. The Pro
vost's Office sets official Uni
versity priorities.
Albert Elsen, professor of art
history, said, "Projects that we
think are important never get
on a priority list." Elsen spends
some of his time fundraising
for art projects that have "zero
priority with the University."
As fundraising becomes a
bigger business, the organiza
tion and bureaucracy of fun
draising become more com
plex. Some faculty members
are alienated by the "re
moved" nature of the fundrais
ing operation, by delays in get
ting clearance for their pro
jects, and by disagreement
with the established program

for the University's develop
ment.
This fiscal year's fundraising
target is $50 million, according
to Cosovich. "Right now we're
looking for money for the his
tory corner," he said. And"the
highest priority for new con
struction is a music building."
The bulk of the money for
these projects will come from'
major gifts.
Stanford, like other private
universities, will have to deal
with the problems involved in
the increasing dependence on
major gifts: the tendency to in
vade the privacy of potential
donors while searching for
necessary money, the threat
posed by big money interests
to the academic independence
of and the es
trangement of faculty by the
business, all part of the
"bureaucratic" nature of fun
draising.

"We try to identify who has the
capacity to make major gifts. We try
to find out who our customer is."
