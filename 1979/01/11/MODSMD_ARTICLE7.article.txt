# Students fashion tools for class

### NEIL MacFARQUHAR 
Sometimes, classes move outside of the
classroom. For anthropology students
grappling with prehistoric archaeology,
lecture attendance was important. So was
tool-making.
In Prof. John Rick's Introduction to Pre
historic Archaeology, "cultural evolution
is taught through the methods and results
of archaeology — how materials are dug
up and analyzed."
The course, taught autumn quarter,
gives students a feeling for prehistoric
technology by providing them with a
tool-making outlet. Students were given a
piece of volcanic obsidian and a deer an
tler. The project: to chip and mold the
obsidian into a functional tool. Most stu
dents attempted to make arrowheads.
"Once you found a good technique it
was fun," said junior Ted Bara. "It did give
us an idea of how tool-making went ini
tially, but it would take more practice and
refinement for us to get good tools."
Another important aspect of the exer
cise, according to Rick, is to analyze the
deposited debris. "Students not only get a
sense of the time and knowledge required
in tool-making in hunter-gathered
societies, but they examine the flakes they
leave behind and can get a feel for the type
of debris they need to look for to read a
dig."
Debris often gives clues about where to
begin a dig, Rick said. Also, archaeologists
often base conclusions about a society's

tools and culture on the debris at a digging
site, and not just on the tools found there.
Most students enjoyed the tool-making
sessions. "It was a way to appreciate what
prehistoric people had to do, what their
accomplishments were," said sophomore
Nina Friend.
"It was a good experience for a physics
major," said senior David Berg. "It helped
me to get a perspective on what technol
ogy is — that it is more than transistor
radios. It is something that started with
stone tools and is going to continue in the
future with whatever I am going to be
working with. The course gives an impor
tant understanding of society from where
it has been."
Rick began experimenting with tool
chipping techniques while an under
graduate at UC-Santa Cruz.
Tool-making is not a requirement for the
course but Rick and his students feel that
the knowledge gained from the process
aids in understanding other facets of the
course, such as analyzing data from ar
chaeological work surfaces.
Rick also lectures and shows a series of
slides and films. Students also take a field
trip to an archaeological site at Coyote Hill
near Newark, Calif.
Students offer much praise for Rick. "He
was very open to comments on the way the
course was run and he was always availa
ble outside of class," said Friend.
"He had been to the excavations we

were studying and thus knew how the
problems were approached," said Berg.
"His enthusiasm was contagious. It was
more like learning to enjoy a new hobby
than taking a class."
Bara said that Rick was "personable,
knowledgeable and proficient. He was
aware that people did not have much
knowledge in the field and he taught it
from that basis — having fun while learn
ing about something new."
Rick, after earning his Ph.D. in an
thropology at the University of Michigan
taught graduate students for only one
semester at Washington State University
before coming to Stanford this fall. He has
done archaeological work in many parts of
North America and in Europe and is pre
sently involved in a project excavating
cave sites in the Peruvian Andes. He en
joys teaching archaeology, which he con
siders the most interesting branch of an
thropology.
"One of the functions of the course,"
Rick said, "especially with complex
societies such as the Mayan or the Incan, is
to give the students a perspective so they
can read the ancient monuments and the
museum artifacts as part of a social organi
zation."
"The monuments represent the
emergence of stratification, class differ
ences, in society, and this course should
thus give them a framework for interpret
ing things that they are bound to see later
in their lives."

gives students a feeling for prehistoric
technology by providing them with a
tool-making outlet. Students were given a
piece of volcanic obsidian and a deer an
tler. The project: to chip and mold the
obsidian into a functional tool. Most stu
dents attempted to make arrowheads.
"Once you found a good technique it
was fun," said junior Ted Bara. "It did give
us an idea of how tool-making went ini
tially, but it would take more practice and
refinement for us to get good tools."
Another important aspect of the exer
cise, according to Rick, is to analyze the
deposited debris. "Students not only get a
sense of the time and knowledge required
in tool-making in hunter-gathered
societies, but they examine the flakes they
leave behind and can get a feel for the type
of debris they need to look for to read a
dig."
Debris often gives clues about where to
begin a dig, Rick said. Also, archaeologists
often base conclusions about a society's

tools and culture on the debris at a digging
site, and not just on the tools found there.
Most students enjoyed the tool-making
sessions. "It was a way to appreciate what
prehistoric people had to do, what their
accomplishments were," said sophomore
Nina Friend.
"It was a good experience for a physics
major," said senior David Berg. "It helped
me to get a perspective on what technol
ogy is — that it is more than transistor
radios. It is something that started with
stone tools and is going to continue in the
future with whatever I am going to be
working with. The course gives an impor
tant understanding of society from where
it has been."
Rick began experimenting with tool
chipping techniques while an under
graduate at UC-Santa Cruz.
Tool-making is not a requirement for the
course but Rick and his students feel that
the knowledge gained from the process
aids in understanding other facets of the
course, such as analyzing data from ar
chaeological work surfaces.
Rick also lectures and shows a series of
slides and films. Students also take a field
trip to an archaeological site at Coyote Hill
near Newark, Calif.
Students offer much praise for Rick. "He
was very open to comments on the way the
course was run and he was always availa
ble outside of class," said Friend.
"He had been to the excavations we

were studying and thus knew how the
problems were approached," said Berg.
"His enthusiasm was contagious. It was
more like learning to enjoy a new hobby
than taking a class."
Bara said that Rick was "personable,
knowledgeable and proficient. He was
aware that people did not have much
knowledge in the field and he taught it
from that basis — having fun while learn
ing about something new."
Rick, after earning his Ph.D. in an
thropology at the University of Michigan
taught graduate students for only one
semester at Washington State University
before coming to Stanford this fall. He has
done archaeological work in many parts of
North America and in Europe and is pre
sently involved in a project excavating
cave sites in the Peruvian Andes. He en
joys teaching archaeology, which he con
siders the most interesting branch of an
thropology.
"One of the functions of the course,"
Rick said, "especially with complex
societies such as the Mayan or the Incan, is
to give the students a perspective so they
can read the ancient monuments and the
museum artifacts as part of a social organi
zation."
"The monuments represent the
emergence of stratification, class differ
ences, in society, and this course should
thus give them a framework for interpret
ing things that they are bound to see later
in their lives."
