# Tax revolts began a decade ago
## Northern city's schools suffer 
### 
Federal Way, Wash. (AP) — Long before
California's Howard Jarvis issued his call
for a property tax revolt, the voters of Fed
eral Way knew how to say "no" to taxes.
In 10 elections in the past five years,
voters in this bedroom community 20
miles south of Seattle turned down prop
osals to raise school maintenance and op
eration funds through property taxes. That
amounted to 21 separate measures, a state
record for consecutive school levy de
feats.
"We had our Proposition 13 revolt early
in the 705," explains Larry Van Sickle,
school board president. "Some very vocal
opponents . . . were successful in chang
ing the temper of the schools and the at
titudes of the community toward the
schools."
Many results
Voters' persistence had its results — for
taxpayers and schools.
First, under a new Basic Education Law,
the state will pick up the costs of educa
tional necessities in 1981-82 — maybe ear
lier — meaning it's possible Federal Way
will never have to vote on another levy.
Second, property owners in this com
munity of 65,000, named for the federal
highway running through the city, had a
1978 property tax rate of $11.9 per $1000 of
assessed valuation. In Shoreline, a similar
city north of Seattle, that figure was $20.3
per $1000.
Schools suffer
The effects on the school system were
less pleasant, or as Van Sickle put it: "We
seemingly never recovered."
Two elementary schools were closed.
And budget cutbacks trimmed the number
of teachers and other certified staff from
760 to about 650, says Superintendent Vic
tor Heinlen.
Heinlen, who took the job in 1975, re
cently announced his resignation. Earlier
he had said: "My largest professional dis
appointment is that the community has
not consistently seen fit to approve local
financial support. Nevertheless ... I can
emphatically state that no staff has done

more with less . . ."
Also — until parents volunteered to
help — school grounds often went un
mowed after groundskeepers were cut
from 10 to one.
And textbook purchases were deferred.
Notes Van Sickle: "My sixth grade son told
me jokingly the other day that in the next
five years we'd have a man on the moon.
He'd read it in his school books."
Black marks
In the state's last school accreditation
ratings in 1976-77, all five Federal Way
junior high schools were denied accredita
tion, two high schools were given prob
ationary accreditation and the third only
temparary accreditation. Elementary
schools were not evaluated.
The black marks against the schools in
cluded a shortage of course offerings in
social studies, science and foreign lan
guages at one junior high, and too many
students per counselor and a below
standard library budget at one high
school.
How does the dilemma affect students
leaving the schools? Responds state edu
cation official Bill Everhart: "A student
who comes out of an unaccredited school
can still get into any college if his own
personal course work is properly pre
sented and he is qualified. It might make it
just a touch more difficult . . ."
Numerous theories
Almost everyone associated with the
levy failures has a theory on why they oc
curred. Van Sickle points to school dis
tricts' increasing reliance on special levies
in the early '70s — a trend reversed by the
Basic Education Law and a legislated lid on
school levies.
The levy proposals fell primarily on
home owners in Federal Way, a commun
ity of moderate homes and little industry
in the mid '70s.
And the school district itself was in tur
moil, with a recall campaign against three
school board members, a teachers' strike
in 1974 and the resignation under pressure
of a superintendent.

"It just tore the community to pieces,"
says Van Sickle, "and the rejection of the
school system . . . was almost total."
John Pancratz, leader of the anti-levy
Save Your Homes Committee, says,
"Some people just oppose tax increases,
some were opposed to the way the
teachers' union was effectively running
the school districts."
Poll analysis
In 1977, the district hired consultant C.
Montgomery Johnson with a $25,000 to
poll the community and find reasons for
levy failures. Forty percent of respondents
said they thought voters saw "too many
school programs, too many tax dollars
spent and too little evidence of educat
ional effectiveness." Others complained
about the board and teacher-board in
fighting.
Johnson also said 90 percent of the resi
dents work in other cities and lack com
munity roots.
For a district with 21 strikes against it,
however, the mood is now surprisingly
upbeat.
The state Board of Education has
granted the district two waivers from the
basic education law. Without the waivers,
penalties could have amounted to more
than $900,000.
Enrollment down
District enrollment is down to 15,244
from a 1973 peak of 16,316, but the decline
has slowed to 1 Vi percent this year, versus
3 percent last year, says Heinlen.
Ron Carlson of the teachers' associa
tions says:"The morale of the teachers is
very good because we realize that soon we
will not have to rely on levies."
In recent years, too, Federal Way has
begun to boom. Its population grew from
54,786 in 1976 to 65,089 now, and new
homes, office space and a shopping mall
have been built. The Weyerhaeuser Co.
has located its headquarters here and a
Weyerhaeuser subsidiary is developing
homes and condominiums that eventually
will house 20,000 people.

five years we'd have a man on the moon.
He'd read it in his school books."
Black marks
In the state's last school accreditation
ratings in 1976-77, all five Federal Way
junior high schools were denied accredita
tion, two high schools were given prob
ationary accreditation and the third only
temparary accreditation. Elementary
schools were not evaluated.
The black marks against the schools in
cluded a shortage of course offerings in
social studies, science and foreign lan
guages at one junior high, and too many
students per counselor and a below
standard library budget at one high
school.
How does the dilemma affect students
leaving the schools? Responds state edu
cation official Bill Everhart: "A student
who comes out of an unaccredited school
can still get into any college if his own
personal course work is properly pre
sented and he is qualified. It might make it
just a touch more difficult . . ."
Numerous theories
Almost everyone associated with the
levy failures has a theory on why they oc
curred. Van Sickle points to school dis
tricts' increasing reliance on special levies
in the early '70s — a trend reversed by the
Basic Education Law and a legislated lid on
school levies.
The levy proposals fell primarily on
home owners in Federal Way, a commun
ity of moderate homes and little industry
in the mid '70s.
And the school district itself was in tur
moil, with a recall campaign against three
school board members, a teachers' strike
in 1974 and the resignation under pressure
of a superintendent.

"It just tore the community to pieces,"
says Van Sickle, "and the rejection of the
school system . . . was almost total."
John Pancratz, leader of the anti-levy
Save Your Homes Committee, says,
"Some people just oppose tax increases,
some were opposed to the way the
teachers' union was effectively running
the school districts."
Poll analysis
In 1977, the district hired consultant C.
Montgomery Johnson with a $25,000 to
poll the community and find reasons for
levy failures. Forty percent of respondents
said they thought voters saw "too many
school programs, too many tax dollars
spent and too little evidence of educat
ional effectiveness." Others complained
about the board and teacher-board in
fighting.
Johnson also said 90 percent of the resi
dents work in other cities and lack com
munity roots.
For a district with 21 strikes against it,
however, the mood is now surprisingly
upbeat.
The state Board of Education has
granted the district two waivers from the
basic education law. Without the waivers,
penalties could have amounted to more
than $900,000.
Enrollment down
District enrollment is down to 15,244
from a 1973 peak of 16,316, but the decline
has slowed to 1 Vi percent this year, versus
3 percent last year, says Heinlen.
Ron Carlson of the teachers' associa
tions says:"The morale of the teachers is
very good because we realize that soon we
will not have to rely on levies."
In recent years, too, Federal Way has
begun to boom. Its population grew from
54,786 in 1976 to 65,089 now, and new
homes, office space and a shopping mall
have been built. The Weyerhaeuser Co.
has located its headquarters here and a
Weyerhaeuser subsidiary is developing
homes and condominiums that eventually
will house 20,000 people.
Federal Way, Wash. (AP) — Long before
California's Howard Jarvis issued his call
for a property tax revolt, the voters of Fed
eral Way knew how to say "no" to taxes.
In 10 elections in the past five years,
voters in this bedroom community 20
miles south of Seattle turned down prop
osals to raise school maintenance and op
eration funds through property taxes. That
amounted to 21 separate measures, a state
record for consecutive school levy de
feats.
"We had our Proposition 13 revolt early
in the 705," explains Larry Van Sickle,
school board president. "Some very vocal
opponents . . . were successful in chang
ing the temper of the schools and the at
titudes of the community toward the
schools."
Many results
Voters' persistence had its results — for
taxpayers and schools.
First, under a new Basic Education Law,
the state will pick up the costs of educa
tional necessities in 1981-82 — maybe ear
lier — meaning it's possible Federal Way
will never have to vote on another levy.
Second, property owners in this com
munity of 65,000, named for the federal
highway running through the city, had a
1978 property tax rate of $11.9 per $1000 of
assessed valuation. In Shoreline, a similar
city north of Seattle, that figure was $20.3
per $1000.
Schools suffer
The effects on the school system were
less pleasant, or as Van Sickle put it: "We
seemingly never recovered."
Two elementary schools were closed.
And budget cutbacks trimmed the number
of teachers and other certified staff from
760 to about 650, says Superintendent Vic
tor Heinlen.
Heinlen, who took the job in 1975, re
cently announced his resignation. Earlier
he had said: "My largest professional dis
appointment is that the community has
not consistently seen fit to approve local
financial support. Nevertheless ... I can
emphatically state that no staff has done

more with less . . ."
Also — until parents volunteered to
help — school grounds often went un
mowed after groundskeepers were cut
from 10 to one.
And textbook purchases were deferred.

me jokingly the other day that in the next
five years we'd have a man on the moon.
