# Plan to end arms race proposed
## 
### ROD STEVENS 
An alternative global security sys
tem under U.N. control could elimi
nate the global arms race, said San
ford Persons, speaking yesterday at
the Bechtel International Center.
Persons, a vice-president of New
Directions nationally, discussed the
future of the United Nations and
possibilities for world disarmament.
New Directions, which sponsored
the bag lunch, is a public interest
group concerned with international
affairs.
Noting the continuing arms build
up, Persons said, "Despite the in
credible sums we spend each year
for defense, congressional leaders
still tell us, 'We cannot defend you.'"
This year President jimmy Carter has
increased the defense budget more
than any other program, he said.
Cut spending
"We all have inbred conceptions
about the need for armament," he
said. "In fact, we could cut back our
defense spending 90 percent if we
agreed to disarm with other na
tions."
Persons cited congressional and
public support for international
peace keeping bodies like the U.N.
forces in the Sinai. He said he looks
to an international body like the Un
ited Nations to police the accords of
any disarmament treaty.
U.N. role
When asked about the role the Uni
ted Nations could play in the present
SALT II talks between the United
States and Russia, Persons conceded
that both countries don't want what
they see as outside interference.
While both sides want to limit arms,
he said, they don't want other less
developed countries to influence
their decisions.
The United States' and Russia's
"commonalities of wealth and
technological advantage" set the two
off against the non-super-powers, he
said. On the other hand, these de
veloping nations fear the great influ
ence Russia and the United States
have over international conferences
on disarmamentand havedemanded
a rotating chairmanship to give them
some power as well, he explained.
Persons conceded that interna
tional arbitrating bodies are weak,
since most countries will not use
them.
