### 
Sacramento (AP) — California
physicians could prescribe
marijuana to help in treatment
of ailments including cancer
and glaucoma under a bill in
troduced Wednesday.
Paul Johnson, a 23-year-old
Riverside man who suffers
from Hodgkin's disease and
says he uses marijuana illegally
because of his illness, ap
peared with the two legislators
sponsoring the bill.
Johnson said his
chemotherapy treatments for
the disease, a form of cancer,
made him vomit for five or six
hours at a time, and the
marijuana leaves him almost
without "any problem."

"To me, the issue is a moral
one. Is it better for me to suffer
or use a little marijuana?"
Johnson asked reporters, say
ing he was uncomfortable with
having to do anything illegal.
Johnson said he can combat
his nausea with one or two
marijuana cigarettes while the
legally prescribed drug his
doctor gave him before made
him higher than marijuana.
SB 184, the bill by Sen.
Robert Presley (D-Riverside),
and Assemblyman Herschel
Rosenthal (D-Los Algeles),
would create a state commis
sion for a two-year pilot
period. The commission would
have to approve each specific
case of marijuana use.
"I want to stress this is no
way the forerunner of an at
tempt to legalize marijuana. I
wouldn't support that," Pre
sley said.
Four other states, Florida,
Louisiana, New Mexico and Il
linois, have similar laws, and
those states have trouble get
ting marijuana from federal au
thorities, Rosenthal said. For
that reason, the bill will allow
the state to obtain the
marijuana from state or federal
narcotics authorities.
In the case of glaucoma, Pre
sley said controlled use of
marijuana has been successful
in easing pressure on the optic
nerve, thus halting the advance
of the blindness which
glaucoma causes.
