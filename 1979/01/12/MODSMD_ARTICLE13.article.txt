# Judge hears testimony
## Worldwide Church of God financial affairs questioned 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — A judge seeking to un
tangle the complex financial affairs of the
Worldwide Church of Cod heard testimony
Thursday that its treasurer, Stanley Rader,
has reaped millions of dollars through his
employment contract with the church.
Rader,4B, testifying on the second day ofa
hearing questioning the receivership cur
rently imposed on the entity, said he is cur
rently paid $200,000 a year by the church in
his role as adviser to church patriarch Her
bert Armstrong. He also conceded he would
be paid $100,000 a year through theyear2oo3
even if he stepped down as adviser to
Armstrong.
In addition, the following details of
Rader's benefits from his job at the church
were disclosed in questioning by an attorney
for disenchanted church members, who
claim Rader and other church executives
have misappropriated funds for their own

use:
— The church financed his purchase of a
$300,000 Beverly Hills home in 1972 which
Rader sold last year for $1.8 million. He said
he pocketed the profits.
— The church paid most of the taxes on
Rader's home. Asked why, he said, "that
would take a long theological explanation."
— The church recently bought Rader a
$150,000 house in Tucson, Ariz., so he could
be near the 86-year-old Armstrong, who now
lives there following a major heart attack last
year. It also paid for all the furnishings.
— Rader's law firm has been the only legal
counsel used by the church for many years.
The amount of its reimbursement was not
revealed.
— An accounting firm in which Rader has
been an associate does all of the church's
books.
— Rader set up a corporation to buy

airplanes and lease them to the church in an
arrangement through which the church paid
the full price of the airplanes and Rader's
firm made a profit.
— Rader organized an advertising firm
known as Worldwide Advertising, which
handled all advertising, radio and television
shows put on by the church. Rader recently
stepped out of that firm.
Rader's answers at first were hesitant and
convoluted. Superior Court Judge Julius
Title at one point instructed him: "Mr.
Rader, I think it would be helpful if you
would listen to the questions — you are a
lawyer — and respond to the questions."
Hillel Chodos, the attorney for the plain
tiffs, sought to show that Rader has exer
cised complete legal control over matters
which involve his self interest. He suggested
that Rader has given misinformation to
Armstrong to keep him from hiring inde

pendent counsel, and from knowing the
true nature of the current investigation.
Besides looking at the court-appointed
receivership question, the hearing was also
to determine the merits of a suit filed by the
state attorney general and six church mem
bers accusing Rader and Amstrong of divert
ing millions of dollars in church funds.
Rader conceded that after he spoke to
Armstrong earlier this month the church
patriarch "disfellowshipped" members of
the church hierarchy who were cooperating
with the attorney general's investigators.
"Mr. Herbert Armstrong is Christ's apos
tle," Rader declared. "He is Cod's represen
tative on earth right now. He has the right to
hire and fire, and has done so for 46 years."
Following Chodos' questioning, attorney
Allan Browne, who is representing Rader
and the church, showed the judge a 10-
minute promotional film prepared by the

church to tell its members of Armstrong's
world travels and crusade for Christ.
Ironically, the film, made in 1974, has the
white-haired grandfatherly Armstrong dec
laring that the greatest problem of our time
is acquisitiveness.
"Everybody's concerned about his own
self, what he can get, what he can take, ac
cumulate," Armstrong declared. "That very
attitude has caused all of the troubletoday."
The film includes a scene in which
Armstrong presents President Ferdinand
Marcos of the Philippines a gift of Steuben
crystal, one of the many expensive items
which has led to the questioning of church
expenditures.
Throughout the hearing ludge Title was
impatient with the lawyers' extensive ques
tioning on issues which he said would more
appropriately be brought up at a trial.
