# The 						Stanford Daily OPINIONS
## Steve Conley Time for some change 
### 
(Second of two parts.)
One functional proposal for
social security reform, ex
pounded by California's Con
gressman William Ketchum,
would do the following: it
would put the social security
system on a sound financial
footing for at least the next 75
years; it would make long
needed adjustments to reflect
changes in the living and work
ing patterns of the American
people; and it would move
closer to universal coverage.
This proposal would require
that which has been suggested
since 1937 — universal cover
age. At present, no federal
employee, and that includes
the Congress, participates in
the social security system, nor
do about 30 percent of all state
and local government
employees.
Another necessary conclu
sion of the proposal is to raise
the minimum retirement age
for full benefits to 68. The
longer lifespan as well as the
better physical condition of
older people compared to 40
years ago necessitates this
change.
A gradual implementation
with a target date 33 years in
the future, would give people
sufficient time to plan for their
later retirement, and it would
permit management and labor
to revise employment prac
tices carefully and systemati
cally.
Ketchum explains, "Some
may argue that raising the age
at which full benefits may be
collected is a breach of faith.
However, those persons now
43 years of age or older will not
be affected. A greater breach
of faith would be to let the en
tire system become insolvent.
By the year 20000 the number

of those 65 years or older will
have increased by 36 percent,
representing an impossible
burden on the system as is."
Specifically the proposal
would:
—Remove the earnings limi
tation on beneficiaries in three
stages by 1980. Under existing
law, if individuals aged 65 to 70
wish to continue working, the
law imposes a discriminatory
tax of 50 percent on all income
earned over $4000, up to the
full amount of their social sec
urity benefits.
—Advance the age of eligibil
ity for full retirement benefits,
slowly and gradually, from 65
to 68, between 2000 and 2011.
—Extend social security
coverage to all federal, state
and local government
employees by 1982.
—Require no tax increase
until 1982, then a three-stage
rate advance totaling less than
1.25 percent over the next 75
years.
—"Decouple" benefit level
adjustments. At present, ben
efits are adjusted for inflation
according to increases both in
wages and in the Consumer
Price Index. This double ad
justment was unforeseen and
has resulted in a massive de
ficit. Decoupling eliminates
about half of this deficit by in
dexing benefits levels to rises
in wages only.
—Limit survivorship and dis
ability benefit amounts to the
maximum payable to a retiree
under the system. This would
prevent younger beneficiaries
from receiving unduly large
benefits, in comparison with
benefits awarded older dis
abled workers who have con
tributed more.
—Freeze the minimum
primary benefit (given mostly

to those who moonlight just
lone enough to obtain social
security benefits on top of their
regular pension), but increase
the,special minimum benefit
(for those with many year's
work at low wages).
Ketchum's proposal would
comfort the millions of Ameri
can citizens who are con
cerned about the future of the
social security system and
whether it can be financially
secure. These objectives can
be attained without the
enormous tax increases Con
gress has recently imposed.
There are an increasing
number of proposals being put
forth on how to solve the social
security crisis. The Ketchum
proposal is indeed thought
provoking, but it is being killed
by those members of Congress
who will not admit that the pre
sent system is a failure.
The restitution of the social
security system to financial
stability is vital, not only to the
individual participants in the
program, but also to society as
a whole. It is society's backup
system to ease the hardships
caused by an abrupt cessation
of earned income. Yet, in its
present structure, it is severely
deficient, and therefore it is
time for a change.

age. At present, no federal
employee, and that includes
the Congress, participates in
the social security system, nor
do about 30 percent of all state
and local government
employees.
Another necessary conclu
sion of the proposal is to raise
the minimum retirement age
for full benefits to 68. The
longer lifespan as well as the
better physical condition of
older people compared to 40
years ago necessitates this
change.
A gradual implementation
with a target date 33 years in
the future, would give people
sufficient time to plan for their
later retirement, and it would
permit management and labor
to revise employment prac
tices carefully and systemati
cally.
Ketchum explains, "Some
may argue that raising the age
at which full benefits may be
collected is a breach of faith.
However, those persons now
43 years of age or older will not
be affected. A greater breach
of faith would be to let the en
tire system become insolvent.
By the year 20000 the number

of those 65 years or older will
have increased by 36 percent,
representing an impossible
burden on the system as is."
Specifically the proposal
would:
—Remove the earnings limi
tation on beneficiaries in three
stages by 1980. Under existing
law, if individuals aged 65 to 70
wish to continue working, the
law imposes a discriminatory
tax of 50 percent on all income
earned over $4000, up to the
full amount of their social sec
urity benefits.
—Advance the age of eligibil
ity for full retirement benefits,
slowly and gradually, from 65
to 68, between 2000 and 2011.
—Extend social security
coverage to all federal, state
and local government
employees by 1982.
—Require no tax increase
until 1982, then a three-stage
rate advance totaling less than
1.25 percent over the next 75
years.
—"Decouple" benefit level
adjustments. At present, ben
efits are adjusted for inflation
according to increases both in
wages and in the Consumer
Price Index. This double ad
justment was unforeseen and
has resulted in a massive de
ficit. Decoupling eliminates
about half of this deficit by in
dexing benefits levels to rises
in wages only.
—Limit survivorship and dis
ability benefit amounts to the
maximum payable to a retiree
under the system. This would
prevent younger beneficiaries
from receiving unduly large
benefits, in comparison with
benefits awarded older dis
abled workers who have con
tributed more.
—Freeze the minimum
primary benefit (given mostly

to those who moonlight just
lone enough to obtain social
security benefits on top of their
regular pension), but increase
the,special minimum benefit
(for those with many year's
work at low wages).
Ketchum's proposal would
comfort the millions of Ameri
can citizens who are con
cerned about the future of the
social security system and
whether it can be financially
secure. These objectives can
be attained without the
enormous tax increases Con
gress has recently imposed.
There are an increasing
number of proposals being put
forth on how to solve the social
security crisis. The Ketchum
proposal is indeed thought
provoking, but it is being killed
by those members of Congress
who will not admit that the pre
sent system is a failure.
The restitution of the social
security system to financial
stability is vital, not only to the
individual participants in the
program, but also to society as
a whole. It is society's backup
system to ease the hardships
caused by an abrupt cessation
of earned income. Yet, in its
present structure, it is severely
deficient, and therefore it is
time for a change.

One functional proposal for
social security reform, ex
pounded by California's Con
gressman William Ketchum,
would do the following: it
would put the social security
system on a sound financial
footing for at least the next 75
years; it would make long
needed adjustments to reflect
changes in the living and work
ing patterns of the American
people; and it would move
closer to universal coverage.
This proposal would require
that which has been suggested
since 1937 — universal cover
age. At present, no federal
employee, and that includes
the Congress, participates in
the social security system, nor
do about 30 percent of all state
and local government
employees.
Another necessary conclu
sion of the proposal is to raise
the minimum retirement age
for full benefits to 68. The
