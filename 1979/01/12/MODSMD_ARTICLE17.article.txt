I was shocked, as I am sure
many of the community were,
by the letter from George
Bump (Daily, Jan. 3) regarding
the proposed course to be
given to hopefully create a sen
sitivity among students here to
those of their colleagues who
are gay.
Since the author made some
references to the Bible, I think
it appropriate to reply in kind.
If we were to take all the bibli
cal verses literally, then much
of modern behavior would be
proscribed. For example, ac
cording to Deuteronomy
(22:11), "You shall not wear
clothes woven with two kinds
of yarn, wool and flax to
gether." (New English Bible).
There are many other such
items mentioned in the lengthy
collection of works called the
Bible. Quoting out of context,
as Bump does, is at best mis
leading and, at worst, irres
ponsible.
In a similar vein, )esus had
lessons to teach regarding al
leged "Christian" behavior.
One such lesson was to the ef
fect that people should not
judgeothers, but rathershould
address their own shortcom
ings (see St. Matthew 7:1 et
seq.).
Another pointed lesson was
that he himself did not con
demn people "society" re
garded as sinners (see the case
of the adulterous woman at St.
John (8:3-11),' wherein Jesus
told the accused "I do not con
demn you").
And, thirdly, Jesus reserved
his harshest words for the
Pharisees of his day, those per
sons who regarded themselves
as righteous and worthy of pas
sing judgment on others; he
once referred to them as "you
snakes, you vipers' brood. . ."
(St. Matthew 23:33).
A mistake often made by
persons who use the label
"Christian," as does Anita
Bryant, for example, is that
they feel they are appoi nted by
God to be the guardians of soc
iety's moral fabric and they are
to determine what is to be
condemned conduct using
society's worldly standards; all
such witch-hunting is then car
ried on in the name of the Al
mighty.
In a more secular vein, it is
apparent that the references to
the birth rate are a not-too
subtle racial slur by the author
and, in view of the population
explosion, should not be taken
as a condition to be concerned
about anyway. As to the pre
mise that making homosexual
ity "respectable" will result in
its spread, all scientific evi
dence is that one's sexual pre
ferences are fixed early in
one's life, so it is hardly credi

ble that a sensitivity course
taught at Stanford is going to
result in a burgeoning "gay"
population here.
Finally, the gay community is
reasonably large and is entitled
to respect for its preferences
both from a legal and from an
ethical point of view. The ar
guments in favor of this posi
tion are many and since they
are well known to the com
munity, I shall not restate them
here. I only wish more mem
bers of the general community
would take the time to intorm
themselves and to cultivate a
little more tolerance and good
will toward those who are dif
ferent from themselves.

ble that a sensitivity course
taught at Stanford is going to
result in a burgeoning "gay"
population here.
Finally, the gay community is
reasonably large and is entitled
to respect for its preferences
both from a legal and from an
ethical point of view. The ar
guments in favor of this posi
tion are many and since they
are well known to the com
munity, I shall not restate them
here. I only wish more mem
bers of the general community
would take the time to intorm
themselves and to cultivate a
little more tolerance and good
will toward those who are dif
ferent from themselves.

from one Southern California
mansion to another the shah's
mother is arousing Califor
nians' concern. Can't Pat and
Dick take her in?
