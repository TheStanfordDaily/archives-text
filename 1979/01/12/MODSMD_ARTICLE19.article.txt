## Enlightenment by credit card

I am not going to begin by apologizing
for adding another opinion about EST
to the large pile of opinions that have
appeared in the press during the last
few years. I won't even claim that this
opinion is an "inside" one: I haven't
taken EST, and have no intention of
doing so.
But EST is an intensely interesting
phenomenon, especially to anyone
concerned about pscyhology, sociol
ogy or religion. It is interesting be
cause it has as its goal nothing less than
(to quote an EST document) "the trans
formation of the world." It is interest
ing because of the incredible rate at
which it is growing.
And it is interesting because of the
people who support it. The usual com
plement of TV and film "personalities;"
the usual collection of slightly off-beat
savants (Buckminster Fuller, Swami
Muktananda); but EST has found adhe
rents in unlikely places. At least four
graduate students in the Psychology
Department here — certainly no center
of soft-headedness — have taken EST.
Princeton Philosophy Prof. Walter
Kaufmann, respected scholar, author
ity on Martin Buber, has taken EST. He's
also an authority on Nietzsche, so some
people will probably say, "well, no
wonder."
But that misses the point: a profes
sor, a professor who has published
scholarly books, has gone to an encyc
lopedia salesman turned guru to seek
enlightenment.
So when Janet, a friend and graduate
of the EST training, invited some of us
to attend an EST "guest seminar," I ac
cepted. She wasn't trying to sell us on

EST, she said, but she thought that it
would be interesting. Besides, I had
read a lot about EST but never attended
an EST event before. Moreover, this
was a special guest seminar: one of the
nine or 10 EST trainers was to be pre
sent, and a film was to be shown, a film
entitled "I used to be different, now I'm
the same."
The seminar was held in the Masonic
Auditorium, in San Francisco. EST was
in evidence even before we arrived at
the auditorium; EST personnel directed
us through that tricky left turn at the top
of Nob Hill and waved us toward a park
ing space. Seemingly hundreds of
them were scurrying about the au
ditorium itself, some carrying walkie
talkies, all wearing neatly-lettered
nametags, directing ("assisting") the
800 or 900 of us — quite a "seminar"! —
into the auditorium.
Their discipline was impressive:
"they're pretty well organized," said
)anet. It was also frightening: "If they
offer me any Kool-Aid, I'm not taking
it," said Gary, another guest in our
group.
The seminar itself resembled a revival
service in many ways. Laurel Scheaf,
the EST trainer who led it, was greeted
by enthusiastic applause both when
she arrived and several times during the
seminar.
At a certain point, we were instructed
to stand and greet those who were sit
ting near us, rather like the "passing of
the peace" during a service. And there
was plenty of evangelism and encour
agement to sign up for "The Training"
— one could hear the capital letters in
Scheaf's voice.
No, they didn't sing hymns about

Werner Erhard, and they didn't shout at
us, and they didn't jump up and down
or wave copies of the Gospel according
to Werner (if such a thing exists). But
the appeal, though low-key, was
nonetheless there.
You can now pay for EST, they in
formed us, by Master Charge or VISA.
Enlightenment on the installment plan:
how many churches can offer that?
So what is EST ail about? Does it really
brainwash people?
Here is my hypothesis — it is no more
than that. EST, at its core, attempts to
shake its trainees loose from the epis
temological system they- have de
veloped — the grid through which they
see the world, their rules for know
ledge acquisition.
It does this in a number of ways, few
of which are new: paradoxical state
ments, exercises in altered states of
consciousness, and what a philosophy
professor I had once called "the
world's most venerable philosophical
method'": jumping up and down and
shouting.
It does this in the hope that the
trainees will then be able to perceive
reality in a "naked" state, as it actually
is, rather than as their rules and beliefs
would construct it for them.
But what happens once this disorien
tation is accomplished — if it can be
accomplished? Such a state is far from
stable; many people, placed in such a
disoriented state, will grasp at the first
chance of orientation that comes along.
It is possible, forexample, to hypnotize
many subjects by disorienting them,
then offering them a logical and true
statement, e.g. "you can go into a deep
trance."

EST claims that it does not offer
trainees any belief system or ideology
They are supposedly encouraged to
"experience" the world, to see it as it
really is. But it is not clear that this is the
case. There is considerable evidence, I
think, that EST does offer its "en
lightened" trainees something: and
that something is EST itself.
Immediately following the graduates'
experience of "enlightenment" (what
EST calls "getting it") they are given a
book of Erhard's aphorisms, intro
duced to members of the EST organiza
tion, and allowed to mingle with atten
dees at a guest seminar. The graduates
are also encouraged to sign up for a
graduate seminar, which most of them
do. Such actions, namely the devotion
that EST graduates have for Erhard and
the EST organization, and the energy
with which new members are recruited
and graduates encouraged to return for
more seminars, do not fit EST's claim
that they offer no ideology to their
trainees.
The older, less technological ways of
enlightenment — the religions — do
not promise results in two weekends.
Some of them promise to make sub
stantial demands upon their followers'
time and energy; some of them de
mand devotion to a person; some of
them insist that their followers adopt
certain beliefs and practices. But at
least they are honest about what they
are up to. If EST is here to stay — and it
looks like it may well be — it is time for
it to grow up and do the same thing.
