## Science needs informed public participation 
### 
In the late '60s and early '70s
a series of scientific discoveries
and refinements lead to the
ability to splice together DNA
— the "blueprint molecule"
that directs the growth and
function of almost all life —
from different organisms and
to insert this hybrid, or recom
binant, DNA molecule into a

host organism where it could
be copied indefinitely through
the organism's offspring. Such
offspring would be very diffe
rent from the original host
species — a new form of life.
While the potential theoreti
cal and practical benefits of
such a technique were exci
ting, the risks of this research

were also soon noticed.
For example, inserting a
foreign sequence of DNA into
an organism, such as 112. coli, a
bacteria of the human gut,
could potentially endow that
organism with harmful proper
ties like drug resistance, the
ability to make toxins or
perhaps a tendency to cause
cancer.
Such potential dangers
prompted a precedence
setting degree of public inter
vention in this area of scientific
research. This intervention
demonstrated both the prob
lems and the positive poten
tials for public involvement in
making judgments of issues in
volving science. And while the
risk in this area is now thought
to be less than initially feared,
there will continue to be a de
mand for informed public par
ticipation.
Public involvement began
when concern about the risks
of the research, initially by the
scientists themselves and then
by the National Institute of
Health (NIH), the government
agency which funds most of
the r-DNA research in the Un
ited States. This led to a set of
NIH safety guidelines, drawn
up largely by the scientists
themselves and issued in July
1976.
These guidelines covered
only NIH-funded experiments,
were enforced simply by the
threat of withdrawing NIH
funds, and were to be carried
out by Institutional Biosafety
Committees (IBCs) at the in
stitution where the research
was being done.

This concern for public
safety has led to other
precedent-setting develop
ments in public involvement in
science. For example, in 1976
the Cambridge City Council
forced Harvard to declare a
moratorium on much of its
r-DNA research until a lay
committee decided on its
safety for the community.
Several bills have been in
troduced at federal and state
levels to give some version of
the NIH Guidelines the forceof
law and to establish a commit
tee of scientists and non
scientists to oversee the regu
lations.
It has now been 2Vi years
since the NIH guidelines were
first issued. Has the public
hand been a well-coordinated
and helping one or clumsy and
detrimental?
There have been undeniable
problems — sensationalism
and oversimplification at times
by the media, delays in updat
ing the guidelines, excessive
and misleading lobbying ef
forts by scientists supporting
the research and by its oppo
nents.
But there have also been en
couraging successes. The
Cambridge lay committee de
monstrated that educated
members of the public can act
responsibly in areas of science
policy. The media has run
many accurate and responsible
descriptions of the issues and
the science involved. Local
public participation in com
munities from San Diego to
Bloomington, Indiana has had
its problems, but such partici

pation has also shown the po
tential for public interest and
responsible involvement.
And federal involvement can
be responsive and reasonable.
The new NIH guidelines, for
mulated with a substantial
amount of public input, are de
signed to provide for greater
ease in reducing research re
strictions and to actually re
duce the amount of bureaucra
tic controls as more is learned
about the risks.
Significantly, the guidelines
specifically provide for greater
public input in decision mak
ing in this area by increasing
the public membership on
local IBCs and the Federal Ad
visory Committee and by urg
ing more open local meetings.
Yet there are many issues in
volving r-DNA research which
have not been adequately dealt
with or which will become im
portant in the near future, in
which public involvement is
needed.
For example, there is still no
mechanism for enforcing the
new safety guidelines for in
dustrial r-DNA research.
Methods for monitoring lab
worker health are still, to quote
the new NIH guidelines,
"primitive . . . particularly in
recombinant DNA research."
There is the issue of whether
patents should be granted to
individuals or private institu
tions for r-DNA techniques or
discoveries that were in fact
developed with public funds.
Also, the NIF} will eventu
ally be facing pressure to allow
the release of certain recom
binant organisms, such as nit

rogen fixing corn plants
perhaps. And r-DNA
tenhniques may at sometime
be applied to humans directly
by inserting a properly func
tioning gene into a genetically
defective fetus, thereby allow
ing more normal develop
ment.
On a local level, the oppor
tunity for public participation
is still inadequate. The IBC
here currently has three mem
bers from the public: an en
gineer from Lockheed, the di
rector of the Cell Biology Divi
sion at SRI International and
the director of New
Technologies at Syntex. Yet
three out of four meetings re
mained closed to the public.
The above concerns, many
of which will actually be co
vered in a free public forum at
Fairchild Auditorium tomor
row, need informed public
participation through local,
state and federal governments
and local IBCs.
Obviously r-DNA research is
only one area of science, but as
the impact of science in gen
eral on our lives continues to
increase, there will be an in
creasing need for the public to
make informed judgments
about other areas of science as
well. The recombinant DNA
issue has shown that informed
public involvement in science
is necessary and can ultimately
be beneficial to both science
and the public.

research. This intervention
demonstrated both the prob
lems and the positive poten
tials for public involvement in
making judgments of issues in
volving science. And while the
risk in this area is now thought
to be less than initially feared,
there will continue to be a de
mand for informed public par
ticipation.
Public involvement began
when concern about the risks
of the research, initially by the
scientists themselves and then
by the National Institute of
Health (NIH), the government
agency which funds most of
the r-DNA research in the Un
ited States. This led to a set of
NIH safety guidelines, drawn
up largely by the scientists
themselves and issued in July
1976.
These guidelines covered
only NIH-funded experiments,
were enforced simply by the
threat of withdrawing NIH
funds, and were to be carried
out by Institutional Biosafety
Committees (IBCs) at the in
stitution where the research
was being done.

This concern for public
safety has led to other
precedent-setting develop
ments in public involvement in
science. For example, in 1976
the Cambridge City Council
forced Harvard to declare a
moratorium on much of its
r-DNA research until a lay
committee decided on its
safety for the community.
Several bills have been in
troduced at federal and state
levels to give some version of
the NIH Guidelines the forceof
law and to establish a commit
tee of scientists and non
scientists to oversee the regu
lations.
It has now been 2Vi years
since the NIH guidelines were
first issued. Has the public
hand been a well-coordinated
and helping one or clumsy and
detrimental?
There have been undeniable
problems — sensationalism
and oversimplification at times
by the media, delays in updat
ing the guidelines, excessive
and misleading lobbying ef
forts by scientists supporting
the research and by its oppo
nents.
But there have also been en
couraging successes. The
Cambridge lay committee de
monstrated that educated
members of the public can act
responsibly in areas of science
policy. The media has run
many accurate and responsible
descriptions of the issues and
the science involved. Local
public participation in com
munities from San Diego to
Bloomington, Indiana has had
its problems, but such partici

pation has also shown the po
tential for public interest and
responsible involvement.
And federal involvement can
be responsive and reasonable.
The new NIH guidelines, for
mulated with a substantial
amount of public input, are de
signed to provide for greater
ease in reducing research re
strictions and to actually re
duce the amount of bureaucra
tic controls as more is learned
about the risks.
Significantly, the guidelines
specifically provide for greater
public input in decision mak
ing in this area by increasing
the public membership on
local IBCs and the Federal Ad
visory Committee and by urg
ing more open local meetings.
Yet there are many issues in
volving r-DNA research which
have not been adequately dealt
with or which will become im
portant in the near future, in
which public involvement is
needed.
For example, there is still no
mechanism for enforcing the
new safety guidelines for in
dustrial r-DNA research.
Methods for monitoring lab
worker health are still, to quote
the new NIH guidelines,
"primitive . . . particularly in
recombinant DNA research."
There is the issue of whether
patents should be granted to
individuals or private institu
tions for r-DNA techniques or
discoveries that were in fact
developed with public funds.
Also, the NIF} will eventu
ally be facing pressure to allow
the release of certain recom
binant organisms, such as nit

rogen fixing corn plants
perhaps. And r-DNA
tenhniques may at sometime
be applied to humans directly
by inserting a properly func
tioning gene into a genetically
defective fetus, thereby allow
ing more normal develop
ment.
On a local level, the oppor
tunity for public participation
is still inadequate. The IBC
here currently has three mem
bers from the public: an en
gineer from Lockheed, the di
rector of the Cell Biology Divi
sion at SRI International and
the director of New
Technologies at Syntex. Yet
three out of four meetings re
mained closed to the public.
The above concerns, many
of which will actually be co
vered in a free public forum at
Fairchild Auditorium tomor
row, need informed public
participation through local,
state and federal governments
and local IBCs.
Obviously r-DNA research is
only one area of science, but as
the impact of science in gen
eral on our lives continues to
increase, there will be an in
creasing need for the public to
make informed judgments
about other areas of science as
well. The recombinant DNA
issue has shown that informed
public involvement in science
is necessary and can ultimately
be beneficial to both science
and the public.

In the late '60s and early '70s
a series of scientific discoveries
and refinements lead to the
ability to splice together DNA
— the "blueprint molecule"
that directs the growth and
function of almost all life —
from different organisms and
to insert this hybrid, or recom
binant, DNA molecule into a

host organism where it could
be copied indefinitely through
the organism's offspring. Such
offspring would be very diffe
rent from the original host
species — a new form of life.
While the potential theoreti
cal and practical benefits of
such a technique were exci
ting, the risks of this research

were also soon noticed.
For example, inserting a
foreign sequence of DNA into
an organism, such as 112. coli, a
bacteria of the human gut,
could potentially endow that
organism with harmful proper
ties like drug resistance, the
ability to make toxins or
perhaps a tendency to cause
cancer.
