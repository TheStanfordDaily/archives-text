# Austrian celebrations will be held next week

### KAREN EUSTIS 
Students may not be singing in the rain, but a few may be
seen waltzing in White Plaza or along Campus Drive. Accord
ing to coordinators of the second annual Viennese ball and
Austria Week, this is merely preparation for next week's
events.
After last year's successful ball, returnees from Stanford's
overseas campus in Vienna have decided to expand this year's
festivities. In addition to the ball on Jan. 20, Austria Week will
include a folk dance exhibition, a wine evening, a multimedia
show oh Austria with Emeritus Prof. Anton Sokol and a Vien
nese cafe, all at Haus Mitteleuropa.
"We want to show a side of Austrian culture that is not only
the ritzy stuff," ball committee member Jeff Ryan said.
Highbrow Austrian culture will also be represented with a
production of Mozart's "Impressario" on Jan. 12-14.
"We feel it's important that students are aware of the diver
sity of Austrian culture," committee member Anita Lindemann
said.
"In 1976 the Austrian government endowned the University
with a professorship in Austrian studies. It's only fitting that
the campus become more aware of not only Austrian intellec
tual, but also social life."
Many students return from the Viennese campus with a
deep affection for the city, its people and its culture. Most
agree that the fun and excitement of a Viennese ball was worth
the trouble of bruised toes while learning to waltz or the
difficulty in renting a tuxedo using classroom German.
"The balls showed me the livelier side of the Viennese
people," one student said. "You don't recognize the some
what somber people you see in the street as the friendly, lively
people who bump into you on the dance floor."
"Both Austria Week and the ball allow us to share our over
seas experiences like these with students who haven't been to
a foreign campus, or perhaps went to a different one," Lin
demann added.
The Viennese ball and Austria Week are major financial
undertakings with a total budget of nearly $7000. Students
have been working since October to secure donations of
wine, refreshments and tuxedoes.
The ball committee is also trying to encourage more faculty
and staff attendance at the ball.
