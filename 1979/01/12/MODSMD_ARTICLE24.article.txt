# Gymnasts are new and improved
## 
### DEAN EYRE 
The phrase "new and im
proved" often appears in ad
vertising campaigns, but it's a
description that aptly applies
to head coach Jackie Walker's
women gymnasts. New to the
team are freshmen Karen Hall,
Jeanette LaCoste, Annie Smith,
Cindy Stevenson and sopho
mores Julie Love and Pilar Os
sorio. Improved after a season
of collegiate competition are
sophomore Linda Park and
junior Cindy Sedlund.
With this admittedly young
cast Walker hopes to put on a
winter performance that will
give the San Jose State gym
nasts "a run for their money, if
not beat them." The Spartans
captured the Northern
California Athletic Conference
title last year, finishing ahead
of the Cardinals, who enter
their second year of varsity
competition this season.
Taking on the responsibility
of the team's leading role is
Hall, an elite gymnast hailing
from Newport Beach and rated
19th in the country in all
around competition. To qualify
for the elite category, Hall had
to average a 9.0 (of a perfect
10.0) or better in a series of na
tional level meets.
Of her team members
Walker says, "I'm really ex
cited. The new kids helped in
spire the returning gymnasts.
The freshmen are anxious to get
started — they have worked
hard all fall quarter. Linda's in
the best shape ever and the
team spirit is fantastic."
After almost three months of
practice under the supervision
of Walker and assistants Joanie
Little, Seth Anderson and Tom
Corral, the stage is set. Act one
begins tonight against Arizona,
ranked 17th in the nation. The
Cards get an encore with 7th
rated Arizona State tomorrow
night.

Facing stiff opposition in
their 1979 debut, Stanford's
gymnasts won't get the most
relaxing trip to the Grand Ca
nyon State. However, "if the
girls hit really well, we can beat
them (Arizona)," Walker said.
"We can be competitive with
them, but I don't know about
their depth."
As for Saturday's match-up
with Arizona State, Walker
pointed out "We do not plan to
beat them, but to compete and
experience going up against a
top team. Two of the women
Annie and Karen, have com

peted at that level and know
what to expect, but the team as
a whole doesn't.
"I could have scheduled
easier opponents but that's not
good for them in the long run
and it's better to get in shape
for the regionals," she said.
"Its not whether you win or
lose, it's how you play the
game, and to see how the new
girls perform under pressure,"
Walker added.
And just how does a team
prepare for an acid-test season
opener? Practice and more
practice to "do safe tricks con

sistently — that's the only way
to beat Arizona State," Walker
said.
Both teams have had work
outs interrupted by the holi
days which, Walker explained,
may affect the meet. "Arizona
State has not started classes, so
hopefully they'll be little bit off
coming back from vacation.
We're not near our peak. We
still have rough spots, but the
main point is the experience."
Of the eight-member squad,
seven gymnasts will make the
trip to Arizona — Love will not
be going and LaCoste will be
limited to performing on the
uneven parallel bars due to a
bad knee. A checkup in three
weeks should determine
whether or not she can begin
working out on the other
events. With the exception of
Sedlund, who won't enter the
bars event, all of the other
gymnasts will be going all
around.
As a result of redistribution
by the AIAW, Arizona will be
included in the Western region
(the WAIAW) next year, and ac
cording to Walker, the change
"overloads the region" with
too many good gymnasts. The
effect of the decision is to re
move competition from Arizo
na's former region and
eliminate good athletes from
the Western regional participa
tion since only a set number
can represent each area.
After flying back to school
from the two days of meet per
formances, the women will be
busy readying for the season
home opener next Friday in
Maples Pavilion.
While the women host Cal
Poly Pomona, the men's team
will take on UCLA and Califor
nia. This meet, beginning at
7:30 p.m., is the first of three
featuring men and women's
gymnastics performed simul
taneously at Maples.

As for Saturday's match-up
with Arizona State, Walker
pointed out "We do not plan to
beat them, but to compete and
experience going up against a
top team. Two of the women
Annie and Karen, have com

peted at that level and know
what to expect, but the team as
a whole doesn't.
"I could have scheduled
easier opponents but that's not
good for them in the long run
and it's better to get in shape
for the regionals," she said.
"Its not whether you win or
lose, it's how you play the
game, and to see how the new
girls perform under pressure,"
Walker added.
And just how does a team
prepare for an acid-test season
opener? Practice and more
practice to "do safe tricks con

sistently — that's the only way
to beat Arizona State," Walker
said.
Both teams have had work
outs interrupted by the holi
days which, Walker explained,
may affect the meet. "Arizona
State has not started classes, so
hopefully they'll be little bit off
coming back from vacation.
We're not near our peak. We
still have rough spots, but the
main point is the experience."
Of the eight-member squad,
seven gymnasts will make the
trip to Arizona — Love will not
be going and LaCoste will be
limited to performing on the
uneven parallel bars due to a
bad knee. A checkup in three
weeks should determine
whether or not she can begin
working out on the other
events. With the exception of
Sedlund, who won't enter the
bars event, all of the other
gymnasts will be going all
around.
As a result of redistribution
by the AIAW, Arizona will be
included in the Western region
(the WAIAW) next year, and ac
cording to Walker, the change
"overloads the region" with
too many good gymnasts. The
effect of the decision is to re
move competition from Arizo
na's former region and
eliminate good athletes from
the Western regional participa
tion since only a set number
can represent each area.
After flying back to school
from the two days of meet per
formances, the women will be
busy readying for the season
home opener next Friday in
Maples Pavilion.
While the women host Cal
Poly Pomona, the men's team
will take on UCLA and Califor
nia. This meet, beginning at
7:30 p.m., is the first of three
featuring men and women's
gymnastics performed simul
taneously at Maples.

STRAIGHT AS an arrow is sophomore Linda Park. Park, from Park
Forest, 111., is the captain of this year's women's squad and competes
in all-around competition.
The phrase "new and im
proved" often appears in ad
vertising campaigns, but it's a
description that aptly applies
to head coach Jackie Walker's
women gymnasts. New to the
team are freshmen Karen Hall,
Jeanette LaCoste, Annie Smith,
Cindy Stevenson and sopho
mores Julie Love and Pilar Os
sorio. Improved after a season
of collegiate competition are
sophomore Linda Park and
junior Cindy Sedlund.
With this admittedly young
cast Walker hopes to put on a
winter performance that will
give the San Jose State gym
nasts "a run for their money, if
not beat them." The Spartans
captured the Northern
California Athletic Conference
title last year, finishing ahead
of the Cardinals, who enter
their second year of varsity
competition this season.
Taking on the responsibility
of the team's leading role is
Hall, an elite gymnast hailing
from Newport Beach and rated
19th in the country in all
around competition. To qualify
for the elite category, Hall had
to average a 9.0 (of a perfect
10.0) or better in a series of na
tional level meets.
Of her team members
Walker says, "I'm really ex
cited. The new kids helped in
spire the returning gymnasts.
The freshmen are anxious to get
started — they have worked
hard all fall quarter. Linda's in
the best shape ever and the
team spirit is fantastic."
After almost three months of
practice under the supervision
of Walker and assistants Joanie
Little, Seth Anderson and Tom
Corral, the stage is set. Act one
begins tonight against Arizona,
ranked 17th in the nation. The
Cards get an encore with 7th
rated Arizona State tomorrow
night.

Facing stiff opposition in
their 1979 debut, Stanford's
gymnasts won't get the most
relaxing trip to the Grand Ca
nyon State. However, "if the
girls hit really well, we can beat
them (Arizona)," Walker said.
"We can be competitive with
them, but I don't know about
their depth."
