## Women whip Yale, 75-61 
### RICH MARTINEZ 
The Stanford women's basketball team is
such a multi-faceted ball club that with each
game one notices yet another bright area of
talent. With the Cardinals' 75-61 victory over
Yale last night, the depth of the squad shone
forth. In fact, the reserves could have been the
deciding factor in the 14-point victory.
"The game was very exciting," said Vale coach
Louise O'Neal. "Stanford has an excellent team
with much depth. I feel the difference between
us was their bench." The Card reserves contri
buted 16 points to the cause while Vale's bench
added » free throw to their totals.
On a club that boasts some fine young
talent, plus some seasoned veterans, it seems
that the reserves would not get much playing
time nor recognition. The women the
bench get plenty of the former but not nearly
enough of the latter. In fact, during some of the
Cards' games there is so much activity between
the bench and the court that it is difficult to
distinguish between the starters and the re
serves.
Last night was no exception as the well-rested
Cards ran a fatigued group of Ivy-leaguers off
the court. The first half of action left something
to be desired from a spectator's standpoint as
neither team played extraordinarily well. Both
teams utilized presses resulting in a more cauti
ous, slower paced game plan. Neither team
dominated convincingly, but Stanford seemed
to be in control of matters as they went into the
lockers with a 10-point halftime lead, 41-31.
Yale was determined not 1o be blown out early
as the second half resumed, and their three
woman attack made a serious threat to the
Cards' lead.
The Stanford team lost its concentration and
was slow in defensing after a basket. The Elis
were quick to take advantage.
With Lisa Brummel's driving lay-ups account
ing for 16 points, Carol Lynch shooting 67 per
cent on her outside shots for 12 more points,
and Rosa Aparicio — whocontinually meanaced

the Cards' front court — scoring 16, Yale
seemed intent upon making it a close game as
they cut the lead to 52-47.
Five points were as close as they got, though,
as Angie Paccione returned to the line-up and
sparked the Cards with her electrifying perfor
mance. Paccione alone scored five points within
30 seconds as she hit on a 20-footer at the
baseline and then made a steal, sunk a gravity
defying lay-up, drew a foul and converted a
three-point play.
Jeanne Ruark turned in another impeccable
performance — 25 points and 12 rebounds.
Shelly Chapman singed the nets shooting 67
percent from the floor and totaling 12 points.
Team captain Betsy Lough injured her knee
early in the first half and the severity of the
ailment is not yet known.
The team has improved with each contest
while gaining invaluable experience. This is re
flected in their ever increasing confidence! con
sistency and cool-headed play.
"Our defense is still a bit erratic," stated
Ruark, "but our improvement is quite obvious.
This was a crucial game after coming off our
tough defeat against USF."
"We must score on more consistent levels
rather than in big spurts," stated coach Dottie
McCrea. "We're coming along very well,
though. We have a tough conference game at
Fresno St. this Saturday, but if the girls show
enough confidence in themselves, they'll do
just fine."
