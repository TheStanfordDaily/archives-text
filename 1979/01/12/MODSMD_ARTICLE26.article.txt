# Wet weekend meets swimmers
## 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
Come fair weather or foul,
swimmers stay wet. This
weekend spectators at de-
Guerre pool complex may be
as inundated with water as the
competitors. Nevertheless,
Stanford swim coach Jim
Gaughran said that tomorrow's
Stanford Relays and Sunday's
scheduled dual meet against the

University of Washington will
be held regardless of rain or
inclement conditions.
The quality of the action may
well justify the sufferings of a
tenacious audience. Gaughran
said that he anticipates "tough
competition" for men and
women in both meets.
For the men, the Stanford
Relays will field two teams from

both the University of Califor
nia and Stanford plus one team
apiece from the University of
Pacific, Washington, UC-Davis
and the West Valley Aquatic
Club of Los Altos.
Cal will sport a squad virtu
ally unchanged from the group
that placed third in last year's
NCAA championships. Gaug
hran admitted that the aqua-
Bears, strong contenders for
the NCAA title this year, are
favorites to win the relay
events but should confront an
unrelenting Stanford chal
lenge. The other squads will
"fight it out" between them
selves for the remaining spots,
he added.
Members of an improved
Washington team should
thoroughly test the abilities of
their Stanford foes Sunday, ac
cording to Gaughran.
Tomorrow's women's races
will feature Stanford, Cal, Uni
versiy of Pacific and
Washington. However, the
weekend's closest match-ups
will involve Stanford and
Washington contestents.
Kim Petyon has returned to
Stanford practice sessions,
Gaughran said, but she will not
swim in the upcoming meets.
Competition will begin at
1:00 p.m. both days for the be
nefit of die-hard water rats.
