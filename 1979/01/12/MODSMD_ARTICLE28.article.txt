# Cougar center ejected
## Cardinals succumb in second half, 72-52 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Washington State turned the
loss of its biggest player —
7-foot-2 James Donaldson —
into an even bigger gain last
night at Maples Pavilion as ihe
Cougars defeated Stanford,
72-52, in a Pacific-10 Confer
ence basketball contest.
WSU resembled a defunct
locomotive in the early going,
missingopen shots and playing
tentatively. Meanwhile, the
Cardinals employed their usual
and most effective weapons —
intensity and accurate shoot
ing — to take a 33-32 halftime
lead.
With Donaldson's ejection
midway in the first half,
though, a spiritual engineer
began to stoke the Cougars'
emotional fires.
By the start of the second
half WSU had its pistons churn
ing and boilers burning, and
Stanford, left in billows of
smoke, inexplicably lost any
semblance of determination.
The unpleasant result was 40
second-half points for WSU,
and just 19 for Stanford. None
of the Cards could or wanted to
explain it.
"There was a lack of effort on
our part, and I don't know what
it was that caused it," said dis
consolate Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso of his club's collapse.
"The second half was an in
credible experience."
Wearing a rueful smile, as if
he had been the victim of some
incredibly bad joke, guard Paul
Ciovacchini could only com
ment, "I have no idea."
The game's ugliest and ulti
mately most important mo
ment occurred with 9:58 re
maining in the first half. WSU
guard Bryan Rison had made a
lay-in to cut Stanford's lead to
15-10, and the Cards were br
inging the ball downcourt.

Suddenly there was a flurry
of action around the middle of
the key area. The huge 280-lb.
Donaldson swung a massive
elbow at Card center Tom
Sclimdiziitd, who went down,
clutching his mouth in pain.
Referee Bob Korte reacted
immediately, blowing his whis
tle and angrily excusing
Donaldson from any further
participation.
Carried away by the fervor of
the moment, Dißiaso ran ac
ross to Cougar coach George
Raveling and shouted, "He's
out of the game!"
Schmalzried lay prostrate for
over a minute, oblivious to the
crowd's boos surrounding
Donaldson. However,
Donaldson soon won approval
by walking over to Schmalzried
and shaking his hand.
"I want to make a public
apology on James' behalf,"
Raveling said later. "He's
probably the nicest kid I've
ever coached in 17 years. It
wasn't characteristic of him. All
I know is that there is no place
for that type of play in basket
ball. It's up to Ihe officials to
stop these things before they
get started."
"It was just a matter of losing
my temper," said Donaldson,
smiling calmly. "There was a

lot of contact early in the game,
and the refs weren't doing any
thing about it."
Donaldson went on to con
tradict Raveling's claim that he
is generally mild-mannered on
the court."I feel like doing it
(throwing violent elbows) al
most every game," said
Donaldson. "Tonight I was in a
bad mood."
Donaldson's exit left the re
sponsibility of playing the post
to 6-11 Stuart House, who had
been averaging just 6.8 points a
game.
After Orlando Ward's elec
trifying slam-dunk gave Stan
ford a 31-24 lead late in the half,
House accepted the scoring
burden with ease, sinking five
out of the next six WSU baskets
and helping the Cougars to a
44-33 cushion. Hefinished with
16 points, a season-high.
"Perhaps it was psychologi
cal," said Raveling. "At any
rate, when James went out of
the game, we knew we had to
work harder. From that point
on, we played like demons."
Despite going scoreless for
the first 4:45 of the second half,
Stanford managed to stay
within striking distance of the
Cougars.
After Schmalzried's tip-in cut

WSU's margin to 56-50, Brian
Welch headed downcourt for
an apparent fast-break lay-in
that would have brought the
Cards even closer.
However, Welch missed the
shot under bothersome pres
sure from Cougar forward Don
Collins. WSU got the rebound,
and sweet-shooting Terry Kelly
lofted one over an airborne
Wolfe Perry for a 58-50 lead —
an important "four-point
play."
"You would think that with
Donaldson not being in the
game, House in foul trouble
(he had four early in the sec
ond half), and us not in foul
trouble, that all would be to
our advantage," Dißiaso
moaned.
"I thought we took Welch
and Belton out of what they
wanted to do," Raveling said,
explaining WSU's defensive
success. "Perry's going to get
his2oor2s points, but he's not
gonna beat you by himself."
Perry and Kelly each tallied a
game-high 18 points, though
Kelly had more help, as team
mates House, Rison and Col
lins also scored in double fi

gures.
Tomorrow afternoon Stan
ford provides pre-dinner en
tertainment with a 3 p.m. game
at Maples against the
Washington Huskies.

KIMBERLY BELTON rises for a shot over Washington State's Don
Collins (42) and John Preston (50) in last night's 72-52 Cougar vic
tory. Belton's 13-point, seven-rebound performance was one of the
few Stanford bright spots in an otherwise lackluster evening.
