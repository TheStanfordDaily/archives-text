# Fourth time around for student rent bill
## 
### ALI WEBB 
Getting the run-around from your
prospective landlord? Are delays in
processing an application or in run
ning a credit check common? Do
rents seem unduly high or suddenly
raised? Is there a difference between
the advertised rent and the figure
quoted to you at the door? Are you a
student?
A bill designed to give students
legal redress from discriminatory
landlords was introduced for the
fourth time in the California State As
sembly )an. 4 by Assembly Majority
Leader Howard Berman (D-Beverly
Hills).
If passed, the bill would make it
illegal under California law to refuse
to sell, rent or lease housing to an
individual because he or she is a
student. An identical bill failed in the
closing hours of the last legislative
session.
Approximately 80 percent of Stan
ford students live off-campus at
some time before graduation, states
the Handbook for the Stanford
Community-Life off the Farm.
If the bill passes, any student who
felt that he or she had been discrimi
nated against solely because they are
students could take their case to
small claims court asking for dam
ages and attorney's fees.

Major obstacles to the bill are ex
pected to come from the California
Association of Realtors and the
California Apartment Association,
stated Berman's legislative aide,
Catherine Bergren. Berman repre
sents a district with a high proportion
of students which includes UCLA,
Bergren said.
The bill faced stiff opposition in
previous legislative sessions because
it amended the Rumford Fair Hous
ing Act to add student status to the
list which currently includes race,
sex, ethnic origin and marital status.
Opponents of the bill felt that stu
dent status wasn't a legitimate
categorical minority. The bill was
amended to separate it from the
Rumford Act, thereby reducing the
sanctions, stated Bergren.
"The bill was passed last session
for all intents and purposes but we
just ran cut of time." she explained.
Doug Gillies of the California As
sociation of Realtors stated that the
association had not taken a position
on the present bill but that they had
been opposed in the past sessions.
The economic issue at stake for land
lords is the pivotal issue, according
to Gillies.
The seasonal nature of students in
rental housing poses a serious prob

lem for landlords, according to Gil
lies.
"If a landlord had 100 units and he
was approached by 100 students, he
would be required by law to fill his
units with students.
"At the end of the semester, all 100
students would leave, causing seri
ous problems for the landlord, who
would be faced with 100 units to
clean, redecorate and fill," stated
Gillies. Student status is a legitimate
basis for selection, Gillies com
mented.

housing (MCFH; is a local organiza

commented that they have received
some calls from students.
"There have been no legal
grounds for pursuing student dis
crimination allegations," stated
Rumpf. "However, we would cer
tainly support the bill."
