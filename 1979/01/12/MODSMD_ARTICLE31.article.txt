### 
Casablanca
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. It sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung
by the man they've tried to im
itate ever since — Dooley Wilson
— and the services of a pair of
stars it would be hard for anyone
to forget: Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and
the great Claude Rains also add
their talents. For the benefit of
Comm 141 students, the director
was Michael Curtiz (The Adven
tures of Robin Hond, Mildred
Pierce) and the studio was
Warner Brothers.
—Jim Mattson
To Have and Have Not + 'tc'k'k
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
There's not too much left of
Hemingway's plot here, but it re
ally doesn't matter — the audi
ence is too busy watching the re
lationship between Humphrey
Bogart and Lauren Bacall. She
calls him Steve for no apparent
reason (You know how to whis
tle, don't you, Steve? You just put
your lips together and blow), and
Bogart falls in love both on- and
off-screen. William Faulkner had
a hand in the script; Howard
Hawks directed.

Potemkin ★★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Russian director Sergei Eisens
tein exploited his theory of mon
tage (the putting together of two
pieces of film to create a third,
more complex meaning) to full
advantage here; there's so much
cutting that you'll find yourself
either galvanized or motion-sick.
It reconstructs the Odessa
mutiny of 1905, and includes one
of the most famous sequences in
the movies: the massacre of the
peasants on the Odessa Steps.

Looking for Mr. Coodbar ★ ★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Should have been titled God
zilla meets Annie Hall.
—|.M.
Midnight Express
Biograph, Palo Alto
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook cast of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—|.M.
Chinatown ★★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
A movie about nosy people,
and how they lose their noses.
Directed with intelligence and
venom by Roman Polanski, and
acted with intelligence and

venom by Jack Nicholson and
Faye Dunaway. A detective movie
with a brain; one that is both in
telligent and venomous. Not to
be missed.
—John Nielsen
Superman ★'A"Ar
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—Ron Lillejord
California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets off
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the )ane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the
ordinary sound witless and
forced.
—R.L.
Lord of the Rings ★
Old Mill
One of last year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat and
Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after
more than two hours we are in
formed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—J.M.
Magic ★★
Old Mill
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's a dummy in the Judy Car
land part and the star-on-the
way-down role is taken by An
thony Hopkins as a ventriloquist.
Director Richard Attenborough
pulls off one or two scary mo
ments, but this pseudo
psychological story about a ven
triloquist who becomes obses
sed with his own mannequin has
been done many times before —
and better.
—J.M.

The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
★ ★★
Tuesday, Bishop
Directed by Vittorio de Sica,
the great Italian realist who is
most famous for his life-studies
in Shoeshine and The Bicycle
Thief. Here he goes back to
World War II to deal with a family
of wealthy Italian Jews who find
their status and dignity stripped
away by Mussolini. A little glos
sier production than his best, but
still very good. The lovely
Dominique Sanda stars.
—J.M.
The Lacemaker ★★★★
Wednesday, Bishop
Claude Coretta directed
Isabelle Huppert in this slow
moving, occasionally very beauti
ful film about a young woman
who is so sensitive that she is un
able to cope with the loss of love.
Ms. Huppert, whose latest film is
Claude Chabrol's fine Violette,
gives a characterization so flaw
less it is difficult to separate
character from actress.
—J.M.

American Graffiti
Palo Alto Square
You'll find this double-billed
with Oliver's Story, but there's no
reason you can't go just for this
one and then skip out. George
Lucas directed this gem after THX
1138 (if you look closely, you'll
notice that one of the license
plates reads "THX 138") and be
fore Star Wars. American Graffiti
is an account-of a single summer
night in a small California town
where the teenagers cruise the
streets until daybreak. It intro
duced America to the word graf
fiti, spawned the current '50s
craze, and sported a case of vir
tual unknowns — Richard
Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Cindy
Williams — who've since done
quite well with themselves.

No Time For Breakfast ★ ★★
Aquarius Theatre, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
this is a good movie about a doc
tor who discovers how comfort
less the ministrations of her pro
fession can be when she finds
she is dying of cancer. Annie
Cirardot, who gave last year's
Dear Detective any merit it pos
sessed, turns what was poten
tially soap-opera material into a
very moving performance.
—J.M.
Oliver's Story ★
Palo Alto Square
Marci (Candice Bergen)
teaches Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) that
the way to erase the memory of a
dead wife is to discover the plea
sures of being frightfully rich.
This pointless sequel begins with
a reprise of Oliver's first wife's
funeral; it becomes progres
sively less interesting from there.
This movie gets the Muzak
award: it's this season's closest
cinematic equivalent to super
market music.
—J.M.

King of the Gypsies ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you're in the right mood, this
silly mock epic about a clan of
gypsies in the big city is surpris
ingly entertaining. You could
spend days just trying to figure
out the genetics of this family, in
which the most amazingly di
verse looking people are sup
posed to be closely related. Sterl
ing Hayden and Shelley Winters
get top billing, but the only per
formances worth watching are by
Susan Sarandon as a gutsy, vib
rant gypsy woman, and new
comer Eric Roberts as the son
who realizes that the gypsies
must adapt to the 20th century.
—J.M.
The W/> ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical; lots of every
thing — but make sure we don't
offend anybody. In his desire to
energize this sprawling mess,
Sidney Lumet, the director, sim
ply increased the budget, turned
the volume up and enlarged the
sets. Subtlety and individuality
are trampled by all the technol

ogy-
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multicolored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? Vou can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so huge, so loud in
The W/z that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.
—R.L.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Palo Alto Square ★★★★
This nearly flawless thriller,
which deals with an invasion by
aliens who come in the form of
harmless-looking flowers, will
have you looking suspiciously at
every vegetable in your re
frigerator. lOTBS is set in San
Francisco, and seldom has the
city looked more beautiful than
here as the control center for the
take-over of the human race.
Donald Sutherland and Brooke
Adams star as two people who
are desperately trying to keep
their own identities; Leonard
Nimoy is the villain who works to
take them away. Phil Kaufman di
rected, stunningly.
—J.M.
Autumn Sonata ★★★ Vi
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.
Animal House •k-kirif
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, )ohn Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.
