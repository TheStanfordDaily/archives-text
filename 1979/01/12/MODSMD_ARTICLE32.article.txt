COLONEL LEE'S MONGOLIAN
BBQ
304 Castro Street

Amidst the swirling steam
and smoke, the cook expertly
turns and blends various con
coctions of vegetables, meats
and sauces on the round stone
grill. His smooth wooden stick
takes each medley once
around the grill's edge, and
then sweeps it into a waiting
bowl. This is the scene that
greeted us upon entering Col
onel Lee's Mongolian Bar-B-Q
in Mountain View.
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced
in China during the 13th cen
tury A.D. The Chinese added
vegetables and other ingre
dients, and the cuisine became

known as the "Mongolian Bar
beque."
Immediately upon being
seated, we were served a plat
ter of "baby" egg rolls and
bowls of egg-drop soup. Both
were hot and fresh.
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
desert bars, appetizer bars) are
in for a new treat — an entree
bar! Dinner is priced at $4.95
and includes all you can eat.
Here, you create your own
dinner. Take a bowl and help
yourself to frozen strips of tur
key, lamb, pork and beef.
Fresh vegetables, including
shredded carrots, onions, cel
ery, cabbage, bean sprouts and
cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and sour,
lobster, spicy, mild, medium,
hot and extra hot are offered,
and you are encouraged to
create your own combination.

The first time through, I
started with turkey, added
vegetables, and followed the
suggested recipe for a
"medium sauce." My partner
had beef and vegetables top
ped with an unidentifiable
sauce created by our waiter.
We found both to be a bit too
mild, and we got bolder the
second time around. Beef with
lobster and hot sauces and
pork with hot and spicy sauces
had more zip.
The flavorings were all very
subtle — one should not ex
pect any one flavor to pre
dominate. And don't be afraid
to try the hot sauces, as they
are not excessively hot or
spicy.
Two more pieces of advice:
go easy on the barbeque oil, as
it tends to make things too oily,
and be wary of the cilantro. It
has a slightly grassy taste which
neither of us cared for. Start
with a small amount of food,

and keep going back to try new
combinations — create some
masterpieces!
Our meal was complimented
by rice and chow mein-style
noodles which added extra
body and crunch to the meats
and vegetables. Our waiter
explained that our Chinese
biscuits were delayed because
of oven faiure, but when they
did arrive, they were delicious.
Crispand flaky, theirflavorwas
reminiscent of the French
croissant.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighbor
hood cafes. The service was
courteous, and made some
what more charming by the
fact that no one spoke English
very well. Colonel Lee's might
be just the ticket if you are
looking for something truly
unusual.
