GAYLORD
Ghiradelli Square
San Francisco
771-8822
For those who have never
sampled Indian cuisine,
Gaylord will be one of the most
novel, interesting, and enjoy
able restaurants you can find.
For those who have, we think
Gaylord offers the finest Indian
food in California.
Though difficult to compare
with other genres of cuisine,
Indian food can best be de
scribed as a combination of
Szechuan and Indonesian dis
hes.
Despite Gaylord's Protestant
ring, the restaurant was
founded in New Delhi in the
early 50's by two Indians. They
dedicated the restaurant to
Lord Krishna, and created its
name by combining the "lord"
withthelast nameofoneofthe
owners, Mr. Gay. Hence, the
name Gaylord.
Today, Galord has sister re
staurants in London, Hong
Kong, Chicago and New York.
The management plans to
open a new Gaylord in or near
Beverly Hills.
Upon entering Gaylord, you
are greeted by the Maitre
d'Hotel and promptly seated in
a plush waiting area. In other
restaurants, this is a sign of
overbooking but at Gaylord,
like many London restaurants,
this period is meant to give one
an opportunity to enjoy an

apertif, to lesiurely survey the
menu and, if one wishes, to
place one's order. The sup
remely tranquil atmosphere is
a sudden relief from busy
Ghiradelli Square.
The Maitre d'Hotel then es
corts you to your table. On the
way, you can see the Tandoor
(a clay firepit) from which
emerge tastily barbecued
meats and breads.
Caylord is dimly lit and
warmly furnished: salmon
colored linen adorned with
elegant flatware and china, in
timate tables and antiqued
chairs. It immediately brings to
mind an English tea room.
Gaylord is the sort of place to
go when you don't want to be
seen. A good place to bring
one's mistress.
As is fitting for this elegant

decor, the service is faultless.
The waiters never rush the di
ners, and the diner need never
call the waiter, for he is always
at hand.
Gaylord's menu offers an
elaborate selection, including
many meatless dishes. It is di
vided into two main
categories: specialties frory
the Tandoor (chicken, lamb,
seafood), and curried dishes.
Tandoor dishes have a distinc
tive barbecued flavor. The cur
ried selections vary in flavor
because of differences in the
mixture of the curry spices (the
Masala).
We started dinner with a
platter of assorted Indian hors
d'oeuvres — vegetable fillings

surrounded by a fried batter.
All were excellent.
We progressed to Nargisi
Kofta (a lamb meatball stuffed
with a whole egg in a mild curry
sauce); Sag Paneer (creamed
spinach and Indian Farmer's
cheese, mildly spiced); and
Prawn Bruna.
Of the three, we liked the
lamb the least. The ground
meat seemed to have been
mixed with grain, yielding a
somewhat unappetizing tex
ture and flavor. However, the
spinach and cheese, the re
staurant's best vegetarian spe
cialty, was a luscious combina
tion, perfectly spiced. Succu
lent prawns arrived in a thick
spicy curry sauce which ba
lanced nicely the milder

cheese and spinach.
The waiter then rushed to
our table a sizzling platter of
Tanfoori chicken smothered
with lightly grilled onions. Hav
ing been cooked in a clay pit, it
was not surprising that the
meat tasted like finely bar
becued chicken. It was delici
ous.
While unimaginative, the
wine list does sport some
adequate selections. The St.
Verain (white French Bur
gundy) produced by the Caves
Cooperatives de Prisse is the
best buy at $12. However, we
would recommend a red wine

which stands up better to the
hardy flavor of Indian food. Try
the J. Lohr Petit Syrah.
Despite several good wines
on the list, we prefer beer as an
accompaniment to Indian dis
hes. The MacEwans Edinburgh
Ale is a rich, full-bodied brew
that is perfect for such a meal.
There are several desserts
from which to choose. Ice
cream — supplied by Mary Best
— such as mango, pistachio,
and lychee are all rich and re
freshing.
Even more exotic are the
selections from the dessert
cart. One can choose from
several burhi, which are made

from condensed milk and
cooked for many hours until it
is reduced to a paste. Fear not
the metallic coating: it is only a
very thin silver leaf which sepa
rates the hurhi, and it is edible.
Caylord is only as expensive
as one chooses to make it; the
more diners in your group, the
cheaper the cost per person.
Ordering a la carte, dinner for
two should cost no more than
$30 (tip included), providing
that you stick to beer or house
wine. For less decisive souls,
there areprix fixe dinners rang
ing from $10 to $14 per person.
