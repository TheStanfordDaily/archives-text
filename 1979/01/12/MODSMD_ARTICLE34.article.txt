Vance urges shah to vacate
Washington — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday the Shah of Iran plans to form a
regency council in the next few days and afterward
will take a foreign vacation.
U.S. officials denied, however, that Vance's un
usual disclosure of the future plans of a foreign
head of state was an attempt to preclude a decision
by the shah to remain in Iran to continue the fight
for his throne.
However, Carter administration sources have
said in recent days that they now look on the
shah's continuing presence as an impediment to a
restoration of order.
American officials have said the principal risk
the shah runs in taking a vacation abroad is that
circumstances may prevent him from ever return
ing.
In an opening statement, Vance said the United
States will continue to work with the shah in his
capacity as head of state, and he also issued a
strong endorsement of the 6-day old civilian gov
ernment headed by Prime Minister Shahpour
Bakhtiar.
Meanwhile, violence in Iran erupted again yes
terday when a mob hauled down and burned an
American flag in front of the U.S. consulate in the
city of Shariz.
Secret police agents opened fire on the rioters
as they stormed SAVAK headquarters, Shiraz resi
dents said. Between two and eight demonstrators
were reported killed and from 10 to 15 wounded.
The city is 275 miles south of Tehran.
In other developments, scores of political pris
oners streamed out of jails in Tehran to a tumultu
ous welcome from relatives and friends. Their re
lease was part of a plan to free 266 prisoners that
the Bakhtiar government announced Tuesday in
the shah's name.
Oil to Israel, South Africa cut
Tehran, Iran — Oil exports from Iran are shut off
by a complex mixture of political and technical
factors that sources say make it impossible to pre
dict when the vital fuel shipments will resume.
Industry sources who asked not to be identified
said there is no guarantee Iran will ever produce
the six million barrels of oil a day that made it the
world's second largest exporter after Saudi Arabia.
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar, echoing the
wishes of the Paris-based religious opposition
leader Ayatullah Khomaini, told Parliament yes
terday that Iran will halt deliveries of oil to South
Africa and Israel, both of which rely heavily on this

troubled nation for their fuel supplies.
He said oil sales to South Africa would be stop
ped because of that country's policy of racial
segregation. Oil to Israel will be shut off, he said,
because "the Iranian nation has always shown its
unity with the Arab brothers and has always sup
ported the rights of the Palestinian people."
Although most Iranians are Moslems, they are
not Arabs, and Iran has continued to export oil to
the Jewish state despite the Arab-Israeli conflict.
About 6 percent of American oil imports come
from Iran, and a significant reduction in Iranian
exports will affect prices in the United States.
In Tel Aviv, Israeli Energy Ministry spokesman
Saul Galai said Israel will get by without Iranian oil
because of a U.S. promise to supply oil to the
Jewish state for five years but that "we will have to
adapt ourselves." One source said Israel was
doubling oil imports from Mexico.
Yuba City bus crash suit settled
Martinez — A jury yesterday awarded the pa
rents of an 18-year-old girl killed in the 1976 Yuba
City High School bus crash $150,000 plus burial
expenses as compensation for her death.
The Contra Consta County Superior Court jury
deliberated about two hours before deciding in
favor of Fred and Elsie Melani, whose daughter
Marti was killed in the crash along with 27 other
students and an adult advisor.
The Melanis' suit against the Yuba City Unified
School District, the owner of the 19505-vintage bus
and the state of California was the only one of 40
suits filed in the case to go to trial.
The other suits were settled out of court, the last
on Monday. Court records in the settlements are
sealed but the amounts for each of the victims'
parents or relatives were reportedly around
$75,000.
The crash May 21,1976, occurred when the bus
carrying members of the Yuba City High choir lost
its airbrakes and plunged off a Martinez freeway
off-ramp.
Legislators blast state budget
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown's 1979-80
budget was condemned yesterday by a Democra
tic legislator as a "shell game" intended to win
votes for a presidential campaign rather than meet
California's needs.
The ranking Republican on the Assembly Ways
and Means Committee also criticized the Democ
ratic governor for political manipulation of the
$20.3 billion spending plan. And non-partisan

Legislative Analyst William Hamm told committee
members Brown's figures were "misleading'' and
the true budget increase proposed by Brown is
about 7.5 percent, not the 2.5 to 3.5 percent the
Democratic governor claimed.
Assemblyman Bruce Young (D-Cerritos), said
the budget is unworkable because it is based on
the assumption that dozens of state lawsand some
federal laws must be changed to make it work.
"This presidential gamesmanship may play well
in New Hampshire or Florida, but we have to live
with it in California. It's a shell game," Young said.
Oil workers contract announced
Denver — The oil workers union announced
tentative agreement last night with Gulf Oil and
Amoco on contracts that apparently fall within
President Jimmy Carter's wage guidelines.
A.F. Grospiron, president of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers International Union, said the
Gulf pact is expected "to set a pattern for the U.S.
oil industry" and avert a threatened strike by the
union's 60,000 members.
The contracts are the first negotiated by a major
union under Carter's guidelines, which place a 7
percent ceiling on wage and fringe benefit in
creases over the life of a contract.
The Gulf pact offers a 73-cents-per-hour first
year wage increase, which amounts to slightly
more than 8 percent based on the average oil
worker's wagesB.B2 per hour. But the contract's
second-year increase of 5 percent would indicate
the contract falls within the guidelines.
"Following action of the policy committee to
accept the Gulf offer, I have approved an offer
from Amoco which conforms with the pattern set
tlement. Offers from other companies are ex
pected to follow," Grospiron said.
Grospiron said OCAW locals would be given
information on the tentative agreement by Friday
and would then call local meetings to ratify or
reject the offer.
He would not comment on when the final re
sults of the voting would be available, but said, "I
think they will accept it."
Today's weather
Showers likely in the morning decreasing in the
afternoon. Partly cloudy tonight. Increasing
clouds tomorrow with chance of rain late tomor
row night. Lows in upper 40s to low 50s. Highs in
