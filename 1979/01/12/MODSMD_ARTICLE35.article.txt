# New editor chosen

### 
Michael (Mikey) Charlson, 20, a junior Biology major, was cer
tified the Daily editor for Volume 175 yesterday in an election by Daily
staffers. Charlson assumes the duties of current editor Craig Dennis on
jan. 29.
Acclaimed as "clearly our only choice" and"the best person availa
ble" by Daily staffers, Charlson is well known to students here for his
annual reporting of the good news of rising tuition.
Known fondly as an "Idaho mutato" and suffering genetic damage as
a result of digging radioactive ditches during the summer months,
Charlson had his real start in journalism back in seventh grade as a
sports editor for the Jefferson junior High School Patriot in Lebanon,
Penn. By eleventh grade, he was editor of the Rampage for Highland
High School in Pocatello, Idaho.
One unnamed Daily staffer said, "There's an old saying — 'There's a
woman behind every man.' It's true at the Daily, Sara Lessley is the new
de facto editor." Lessley's official title during the Charlson regime will
be managing editor.
Another staffer at the Daily office last night said, "I've long since quit
caring about quality — I'm only concerned with form ... if he can get
the paper out before 3:30 a.m. and I start getting some sleep, I'm
content."
An unnamed staffer described Charlson as "a journalistic Santa
Claus.
"You see him but once a year, his most intelligible comment is always
'ho, ho, ho' and he's too plump to fit into normal clothing. And listen,
there's nothing more ridiculous than an overweight journalist in a red
velvet suit with white trim sweating over a Smith-Corona."
Despite all the flowing champagne after Charlson's "tough" victory,
staffers continued to call him a "quality journalism product."
Charlson started at the Daily two days before he was an officially
registered student, and previously was news editor, managing editor,
staff editor and opinions editor.
