# Grad student's leap rocks building
## Parts of Chem bldg. structurally unsafe 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
Two weeks ago, parts of the Old Chemistry
building were found to be structurally unsound
and will be locked for an indefinite period within
the next couple of weeks, according to Asst. Pro
vost Susan Schofield.
The problem was caused by an overstressed
beam that was discovered in the course of a
routine architectural inspection. As a result, the
western half of the second floor will be "deacti
vated" and its occupants moved to other quarters
in the chemistry complex, Scholfield said.
She stressed, however, that the building is not
in any danger of collapse.
"Nothing has happened yet," she said, and
"one would have to surmise that the situaton has
existed for many years without anyone being par
ticularly aware of it." She said the problem must
have been more acute in the past because the Old
Chemistry building was used much more heavily
before the Seely G. Mudd building opened in
1977.
The rooms in question were being used for stor
age, classroom space, and laboratory facilities.

Schofield added that the poorly supported area
could be strengthened by adding a few columns,
but she said that was not going to be done because
of financial considerations. The department "feels
it would be better to use the money for something
else." she said.
A graduate student working in the laboratory,
)im Ferrell, jumped off a workbench to de
monstrate the instability of the building. Tremors
could be felt in the room for several seconds af
terward as the floor shook slowly. According to
Ferrell, about 10 persons work in the defective part
of the building, most of whom are connected with
experiments being conducted by Asst. Chemistry
Prof. Wray Huestis.
Huestis said she had "not received any informa
tion" on the impending close of the rooms. Al
though she said her research work is scheduled to
be moved into the Mudd building next week, she
and Schofield said the move had been planned
before any problems were discovered in the struc
ture.
According to Schofield, the Mudd building was
designed to eventually accommodate all there

search and instruction goingon in the old building
at that time. As part of this master plan, Huestis's
operations had long been expected to be shifted
to the Mudd building, she said.
Schofield said her office is still working out the
options for relocating the people displaced be
cause of the defect, and said that no overcrowding
would result because most of the structurally
sound parts of the old building are not currently in
use.
The classrooms were moved across the hall to an
unaffected section, and Asst. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Sydney Burkhart said "things are still
in limbo" for other occupants of the soon-to-be
vacated portions.
Schofield said the structural report was ordered
because there had been plans to add a large
number of books to the chemistry library, also
located in the Old Chemistry building. The Uni
versity wanted to make sure the structure could
support the extra weight. This is a routine proce
dure whenever a room's function is significantly
changed, she added.
