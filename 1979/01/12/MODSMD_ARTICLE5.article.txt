# Chicano study calls for more than school reform

### SAMUEL HOWE 
Chicanos face social and economic problems
which are not going to be alleviated solely by edu
cational reform, according to a doctoral thesis
completed recently here.
Catherine Putnam, who currently holds the pos
ition of research director for the Western Center
on Law and Poverty in Los Angeles, concluded
that:
"Educational reform will not alter the social dis
parities which exist in the community and the
workplace, as well as within the schools. And edu
cational policies will not be able to effect
economic and social reform to end discrimina
tion."
Putnam found that young chicanos are poorer,
drop out of school with greater frequency, don't
achieve as well when they do remain in school,
and in general, wind up lower on the socio
economic scale than their Anglo-American coun
terparts.
Putnam called for improvements in other social
services and government sanctions against dis
crimination in addition to improved education for
chicanos in order for "equal life outcomes to be
realized for all Californians."
Maria Baeza, assistant to the president for
chicano affairs, praised Putnam's efforts and cal
led the thesis "excellent." But she said that educa
tion should remain a crucial issue, especially in
children's earlier years.

"What we need is more sensitized and more
knowledgeable teachers at the elementary and
secondary levels. I can't overemphasize that.
Eliminating problems early would eliminate so
many problems which occur now at the junior
college and college level here," she said.
For instance, she explained, youngsters who are
allowed to reach the eighth grade without learning
how to read will inevitably be the ones to drop out
in 10th grade, simply because they have nothing to
stay for — schools have become detention halls,
not educational facilities, according to Baeza.
Putnam said in a telephone interview that her
thesis had received a "favorable response" from
chicano leaders who had reviewed it. She said that
complaints about it centered on the fact that
specific remedies were not presented by her,
merely an overall view of the problems.
How might a real change be effected in the
chicano status? Putnam explained that a "unified
(political) force will bring action, and not just in an
educational sense.
"A major problem is the fact that Mexican-
Americans simply haven't learned how to manipu
late the political system — blacks, for instance,
have had more time," she said.
Houston chicano community leader Hector
Garcia was recently quoted in Newsweek as say
ing, "We are just beginning to be aware of ourse
lves and the power we represent."
An example of this potential influence is the

U.S. census, which has never been issued in
Spanish before but will be in 1980. Too often, she
said, chicanos have simply gone undocumented
and therefore neglected in crucial data because of
either a fear of filling out the form (many illegal
immigrants from Mexico enter this country each
year) or an inability to do so because of the lan
guage barrier.
Debate has arisen over the concept of a bilingual
system in this country. Many people contend that
Mexican-Americans should be forced to learn to
speak English, because "that's the way it has been
for all other immigrants."
However, many chicanos seem determined to
keep their own culture in this society, and that
includes their language. According to a recent ar
ticle in Newsweek, which called chicanos "both
immigrant and indigenous, tenaciously Mexican
yet indisputably American," there are 7.2 million
chicanos in the United States, a 60.5 percent in
crease over the 1970 figure.
But, contends Baeza, there is an even more
pressing reason to maintain the chicano's lan
guage than just the sheer number of them here.
She said it is critical for a child to be taught basic
educational concepts in his own language, and
then apply them to their second language at a later
age. The fact that this is not done now, she said,
accounts for a lot of the educational handicaps
which chicano children are saddled with now.
And, she said, there is a historical
difference between chicanos and
other immigrants. "We are really
migrants in a territory that once was
ours," she said.
At the college level, Baeza pointed
out that there are only two
Mexican-American colleges in the

entire country, and both of them are
small.
Enrique Monguia, a member of the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan (MEChA), a chicano student
group here, also praised the study.
"Educational reform has too often
been seen as a cure-all forsocial ills,"
he said.
