Thailand (AP) â€” Cambodian
Deputy Premier leng Sary was re
scued from his conquered country
by a Thai helicopter yesterday, escap
ing capture by victorious Vietnamese
units that closed in on theThai-
Cambodian border.
leng Sary, the No. 2 man in the
Phnom Penh regime toppled last
Sunday by Vietnamese troops and
their Cambodian rebel proteges,
flew to Bangkok and then to Hong
Kong en route to China.
The Vietnamese, possibly operat
ing with pro-Vietnamese Cambodian
units, reportedly seized Siem Reap,
140 miles northwest of Phnom Penh,
and the nearby ancient temples of
Angkor yesterday. Sources said Viet
namese planes attacked Battambang,
20 miles farther northwest, probably
in the last majorarea still in the hands
of the toppled government.
The sources, who appear to have
accurately predicted the three-week
Vietnamese blitz across Cambodia,
said they believed the entire country
would be in Vietnamese or Cambo
dian rebel hands within two days.
There were no reports on the fate
of other ousted Cambodian leaders,
including President Khieu Samphan
or Premier Pol Pot. But reliable Thai
and Western sources said the de
feated Cambodians had asked Thai-

land to allow the transit to China of
about 500 people. They were said to
be near Poipet, the Cambodian bor
der town where two Thai helicopters
landed to scoop up leng Sary and
others with him, possibly including
his family.
Some sources said Pol Pot might
have been killed during the Viet
namese invasion. But Prince Noro
dom Sihanouk, the former Cambo
dian chief of state, told reporters in
New York Wednesday that Pol Pot
was "in the jungle" and in daily radio
contact with Peking.
Thailand said earlier it would grant
transit to high-ranking officials of the
toppled regime, but no one else. The
sources said Vietnamese troops and
tanks were moving along a major
highway less than 60 miles from the
Thai frontier.

leng Sary, branded by many as
partly responsible for mass repres
sion and death in his country, arrived
in Hong Kong Thursday night. A gov
ernment official said he would spend
the night before flying to Peking, the
only ally of the toppled Phnom Penh
regime.
The rebels have established a new
government in Phnom Penh. It has
been recognized by the Soviet Un
ion, Vietnam's chief supporters, as
well as Ethiopia, Hungary, Poland,
East Germany, Mongolia, Afgh ;nis
tan, Vietnam and Laos.
In Washington, Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance condemned the ousted
Cambodian government's record of
repression and brutality but said sta
bility in the region required an inde
pendent Cambodia.
