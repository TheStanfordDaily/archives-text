# University rejects convention center
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
The University has rejected an
offer by a New York firm to build a
major conference center on 20 to 25
acres of University foothill lands.
Restrictions in the University's
1974 land-use policy require that any
development "enhance" academic
purposes here. But a 10-member
committee of deans and department
heads found the proposed center
could not meet that requirement,
given the high costs of such a pro
ject, said Dan DeYoung, executive
assistant to the vice-president for
business and finance.
The corporation which proposed
the project, Harrison Conference
Services, Inc., now maintains four or
five major conference centers similar
to the one proposed for Stanford,
DeYoung said, adding that rates for
these centers are much higher than
attendees at Stanford conferences
now pay.
"Rates at such centers run $80 to
$100 a day and the conferences we
sponsor cost attendees $12 to $15 a
day," DeYoung said. Attendees stay
in student residences, and meals are
supplied by the University's food
service.
First rate
"Of course the Harrison facility
would be a different type of facility
with first rate accommodations and
gourmet food," DeYoung explained.
"But the deans and department
heads felt this type of facility was
geared more toward the corporate
market — the insurance companies,
pharmaceutical companies and
management teams.
"The people we attract here don't
come to pay $80 a day for conference
accommodations," he added.
Therefore, "it was not possible to

demonstrate a need for such a con
ference center, given the academic
purpose requirement in the land-use
policy," he said.
Costs down
DeVoung explained that although
some conferences are held on cam
pus during the school year, most
occur during the summer months,
thereby helping to keep down the
cost of the student dorm system.
"Besides conference staff from
Stanford would normally be too busy
with other things during the school
year — namely providing education
— to work extensively on conference
programs," he added.
Most of the conferences held dur
ing the school year are affiliated with
the Medical Center. Such confer
ences are usually on* 1 or two days
longwith attendees usually staying in
local hotels, DeVoung said.
Summer proposal
Harrison Conference Services ap
proached the University last summer
with the conference center proposal.
DeYoung said this was the first time
the University had seriously consi
dered having an outside corporation
build and operate a conference
center, although the idea of having
such a center on campus had been
discussed previously by University
administrators.
"General statements in Harrison's
proposal said that the University
would be given priority in use of the
conference center, but negotiations
were ended before that 'priority' was
strictly defined," DeYoung said.
The University's land-use policy
does not exclude common academic
and commercial uses for Stanford
land, according to the faculty staff
committee which looked into the
Harrison proposal.
