# Class scheduling requires patience, concentration

Murphy's Laws for Students
tell us: "The one class that you
need to graduate will not be
offered your last quarter." But
there seems to be a corollary
that Murphy forgot â€” The last
two courses you need to
graduate will be offered at the
same time your last quarter.
Such "laws" may seem typical
to students here but they are
the flaws the Office of the Re
gistrar and most departments
here try to avoid them when
scheduling classes.
To students here the process
of scheduling classes is vague
and obscure. However, the
system of scheduling here is

complicated and the main idea
seems to be "avoiding con
flicts."
Scheduling for next year's
courses has already begun in
many departments. Through
the use of committees or fa
culty meetings, departments
design tentative lists of courses
to be offered, their times and
rooms. These lists will be re
vised and juggled several times
before they, almost miracul
ously, appear in the fall time
schedule. First, the de
partmental lists go to the Of
fice of the Registrar where they
are shifted and tentatively
finalized, checked and re
checked by both the depart

ments and the registrar. "They
do the scheduling and we try to
coordinate between the indi
vidual departments," Meg
Gross, office assistant in the
registrar's office, explained.
"We are rarely in a position to
decide on times (of classes).
Mostly we deal with room dis
crepancies," Chuck Wolfe, the
room scheduling assistant ad
ded.
While the process varies
from department to depart
ment, most follow some basic
guidelines. "In theory, you
could put all the information
into a computer and the best
schedule would come out."
Prof. Harry Mosher, who
works on scheduling for the
Chemistry Dept, said. "But that
isn't how it works." Scheduling
for the Chemistry Dept. as with
most large departments, is
on a "long line of his
tory." Prof. Richard Eastman
said the Chemistry Dept. must
"arrange its classes with the

physics and biology classes, so
that the first and second year
classes won't conflict with, say,
the biology requirement." His
torically, lecture classes have
been offered in the morning
while labs are offered in the af
ternoon. Mosher explained:
"If someone changes (his
teaching schedule), then
everyone else must."
While history and tradition
play a major role in class
scheduling, there are several
other factors. For instance the
availability of the larger clas
srooms presents an area of
concern. Both Maxine Aiken,
administrative officer for the
Psychology Dept. and Lillian
Zabohan in the Economics
Dept., agree that there are
"not too many large rooms."
Aiken also said that because
of space limitations and stu
dents' schedules, departments
try to. "avoid offering three
popular courses at the same
hour." Zabohan said "morn

ings seem to be the time that
the majority of students pre
fer."
Another factor to be consi
dered is professors' availabil
ity. Arlee Ellis, the administra
tive assistant for the Political
Science Dept., said, "Most of
the professors teach both
graduate and undergraduate
courses along with doing re
search. We try to accommo
date their patterns." Aiken ag
reed. "The professors usually
ask for a time and we try to
negotiate with them."
"Professors in economics
can express their preference,
but can only choose times
under certain circumstances,"
Zabohan said.
Content of courses poses
another area of consideration.
The Political Science Dept.
tries to "spread their courses
over a suitable number of
hours and days." Irene Miller,
the administrative secretary for
the Electrical Engineering
Dept. said: "We try to avoid
offering courses in the same

area at the same time." In addi
tion to other factors the Electri
cal Engineering Dept. has a
special problem. "Many of our
courses are televised," Miller
said. "We must also work
around the television
schedules."
If the problem of course
scheduling seems compli
cated, it is. The general rule fol
lowed is: "Avoid conflicts."
While each department has
developed its own system

within the process, the basic
guidelines are still the same.
Schedules are generally de
termined by tradition and his
tory, professor and room av
ailability, course content and
major requirements. Figuring
out departmental schedules
might inspire new Murphy's
laws, perhaps something like:
"]ust when the schedule is per
fectly adjusted and everyone is
satisfied, the quarter will be
canceled."
