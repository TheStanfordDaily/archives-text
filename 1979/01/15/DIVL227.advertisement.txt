There once was a funeral in a small village in
Spain for a young girl who had been killed in an
auto accident At the funeral, a somber group
of mourners file past the closed coffin. Sud

falls to her knees, looks to heaven, and sobs,
Porque? Porque'? Then the lid of the coffin
slowly creaks open, and through the crack a
voice is heard — butler!
