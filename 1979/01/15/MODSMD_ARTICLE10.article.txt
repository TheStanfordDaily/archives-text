Fairness indeed
I'm writing this letter in re
sponse to the editorial, "A
Time for Fairness" (Daily, Jan.
10). If it is the opinion of the
editorial board that the ASSU
Senate did not adequately con
sider the issue of "double bil
ling" at the Stanford Hospital, I
accept this criticism as valid.
I too felt, as I unsuccess
fully attempted to convince the
senate, that we were making a
very strong statement without
sufficient debate. As a man
agement intern in a hospital
this past summer I gained an
appreciation for the complex
ity of hospital billing. And as a
proponent of the offer to Mr.
Ali Bhutto to serve as a guest
professor, I learned an invalu
able lesson regarding the im
portance of "completely"
studying an issue before enact
ing resolutions. Given these
two considerations, I
abstained in the vote on this
particular resolution to con
demn the Hospital for its al
leged billing practice.
However, the implication
that the senate was "unfair" in
its deliberations, that it did not
consider and consult both
sides of the issue, and there
fore did not "truly represent
Stanford students," is itself un
fair and completely unsubstan
tiated. I have two serious re
servations with the editorial.
First, the editorial board ap
pears to be under the misun
derstanding that the senate
only contacted Cardiovascular
Surgery Prof. Eugene Dong be
fore making its decision.
This is untrue. The resolu
tion presented over two
months ago, had been through
committee, President Richard
Lyman had been contacted,
two senators had individually
spoken with representatives of
the hospital including the dean
of the Medical School, and as
you reported, we spoke with
Dong.
Although I personally felt
that I needed more informa
tion before deciding this issue,
in no way did the senate "con
sider itself wise enough to
condemn the center after only
listening to one of its leading
critics." Extensive effort and
consideration were given this
issue by the Academic Affairs
Committee and several
senators. Even a cursory inves
tigation by the editorial board
would have revealed that the

senate made a strong effort to
gain information from both
sides, and therefore the impre
ssion given the student body
by this editorial is both inaccu
rate and unfair.
My second reservation is
your conclusion, "The crown
ing blow was that the senate
also passed a resolution invit
ing a member of the Medical
Center's administration to pre
sent its viewpoint to the senate
at a future meeting. What pur
pose will that serve when the
administrators already know
they've been condemned?" If
the resolution had been read
more carefully, the editorial
board would have realized that
the senate did not convict the
hospital of such practice, but
only stated that if the allega
tions were true, we condemn
them and urge their discon
tinuance. In order to discover
if the allegations are true, we
have invited a representative of
the Hospital to attend our next
meeting. I feel this is a proper
step to take.
I feel in this instance, how
ever, that the Daily is guilty Of
the same offense it alleges the
senate to be guilty of: that is it
failed to adequately consider
all available information, both
sides of the issue, and thus
wrote an inaccurate and unfair
editorial. In the future it is my
hope that a more detailed in
vestigation be made before an
editorial of this kind, with such
tremendous implications, be
published.
Ron lohnson
ASSU Senator
As co-sponsor of the ASSU
Senate resolution which con
demns the Medical Center's
billing practices, I take excep
tion to your editorial (Daily,
jan. 10).
My main concern is that the
Daily bases its condemnation
of the senate on incorrect
statements about one
sidedness.
Fact: The first official heard
by the senate was President
Richard Lyman near the end of
last quarter.
Fact: At its last meeting of fall
quarter, the senate Academic
Affairs Committee passed the
resolution with the provision
that the chairman should in
vestigate the Medical Center's
position and introduce the
legislation only if the evidence
warranted consideration by
the entire senate.

Fact: Prior to the senate
meeting Jan. 4, I went to the
Medical Center and talked to
Acting Dean Lawrence Crow
ley and Assoc. Staff Counsel
Carl Hitchner. From the infor
mation provided at that meet
ing, I decided that the resolu
tion was unnecessary, but that
the senate should be made
aware of the case.
Fact: At the same senate
meeting, I introduced the re
solution (under new business
so that it did not carry commit
tee recommendation), and,
after it was seconded, spoke
first. I presented the Medical
Center's case and urged that
the resolution be defeated.
Fact: It was only after first
hearing Lyman last quarter and
my presentation of the Medical
Center's position that the se
nate was addressed by Car
diovascular Surgery Prof.
Eugene Dong.
Fact: Dong clearly indicated
that the information I received
from Crowley and Hitchner
was incomplete and totally mis
leading in regard to California
Statute 2008. Therefore, rather
than move to table the resolu
tion as I had planned, I sup
ported the legislation and

urged passage.
I would like toadd that when
the senate has considered it
self in error, it has moved to
reverse the situation. The Daily
should consider doing
likewise.

Committee
Editors' Note: The Daily was
incorrect in asserting that the
senate had not made any effort
to hear both sides of the billing
controversy. But because of
the complexity of the question
- which touches on not only
legal but also ethical issues -
the Daily believes that the se
nate should have realistically
made even greater efforts to
ensure that they would be
adequately informed. There
fore, aside from the aforemen
tioned point, the Daily stands
by its editorial.
Cartoons sexist
We demand that the Daily
immediately stop printing Gil
Morales' cartoons.
Morales has established

himself as a sexist cartoonist.
He frequently degrades
women and has humiliated the
entire female community at
Stanford through his "Barbie
Doll" (and Raggedy Ann) im
ages. We have often thrown
the Daily down in disgust after
reading his work.
Last Thursday's comic strip,
however, especially unnerved
us. For a newspaper that pro
fesses it wants to help alleviate
the rape problem at Stanford,
we find it incredible and tragic
that you published a cartoon
which glorifies rape and makes
it a subject for laughs. The
most violent sexist act is not
comic.
There is no "freedom of
press" involved here when the
freedom of every woman at
Stanford is threatened. Stop
printing this cartoon.

I feel that the Daily owes an
apology to the public forallow
ing such perversion to be
printed on its pages as Gil
Morales' comic strip of last
Thursday, and those of other
dates. Does the Daily have any
idea how dangerous it is to
allow sexual perversion to be
made into "humor?" Do you
actually find enjoyment in
elevating the basest sexual fan
tasies? Is there not enough
humor to be found in ourse
lves and in society: we who
disdain perversion? I say there
is!
Granted it takes quite a bit of
creativity to draw it out, but
dirty jokes come cheap. Please
think about this long enough
to come to your senses and
take appropriate action!

Editors' Note: Daily car
toonist Gil Morales has submit
ted the following response to
these criticisms:
I never expected to see the
day when the feminist move
ment would become so reac
tionary. It seems that with a
single cartoon I have set the
feminist movement back about
7000 or 8000 years, judging
from the tone of the responses
I've received thus far.
I must admit, though, that I

did make a mistake. I do that
sometimes. My mistake was
that I did not have the foresight
to see that rape (of anything) is
not a situation to use when try
ing to make a point about dolls
and their contribution to sexist
conditioning. Obviously, by
mentioning the word "rape," I
gave the impression to some
that I was making fun of rape,
or, at best, commenting on
rape, which I was not.
What I find to be humorous,
though, is the fact that I've
been accused of being a sexist
cartoonist simply because I
have depicted "sexist" situa
tions. Such accusations have
also been leveled against
another Daily cartoon strip, ]'.
Moist and Co., as well as
against certain Daily adver
tisements.
Unfortunately, there seem to
be a few involved in the
feminist movement who suffer
from such extreme delusions
of persecution that they are
unable to realize that I depict a
sexist situation to satirize it. A
good example of this is Archie
Bunker and racism. Hunker is a
racist, and we laugh at him not
because we are racist but be
cause we see how foolish he is
as a racist.
Sure, there are probably ra
cists who find Bunker humor
ous for the wrong reasons, but
that is their problem.
It would be naive to think
that the writers of All in the
Family write such a program
because they enjoy poking fun
at "niggers" and "spies."
This line of thought also
applies to "sexist" cartoons. I
think the problem with those
sensitive members of the
feminist movement is that they
are more worried about condi
tioning people away from
sexism than letting them figure
out for themselves just how
much they are deprived of by
sexist attitudes.
Finally, I doubt very much if
my cartoon or cartoons do very
much to condone or encour
age sexist attitudes in societv.
Sexism is a pervasive force in
our society, and I simply depict
it as such. When you attack me,
is it really because I'm the
cheerleading section for
sexism, or because you are so
uptight about sexism, and I
make a great scapegoat?
