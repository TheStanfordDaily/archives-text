# Help for overcrowded courts
## Dispute settlement centers arise 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — Itwas the kind
of case the already over
crowded courts could do with
out.
A young Atlanta man had
bought $400 worth of living
room furniture on an install
ment plan and tell behind on
his payments. The merchant
promptly filed suit.
Most prosecutors and
judges — worried about more
serious cases — want no part of
these hassles between store
and customers, neighbor and
neighbor, husband and wife —
where tempers can flare
beyond reason and sometimes
turn on the petty.
Still, these arguments wind
up in the courts, disputes over
a neighbor's dog trespassing
on a lawn, a shoving match in a
bar, something bought in a
store and not paid for on time.
But in Atlanta and about 20
other cities across the nation,
an alternative to court battles
has been spreading recently:
community dispute settlement
centers.
The idea is simple and goes
back to the days when personal
disputes were usually settled
not by a judge and jury but by a
respected elder in the com
munity, like a parish priest.
An individual who has a dis
pute with someone brings his
complaint to the police, a Bet
ter Business Bureau office, a
prosecutor or a judge. He may
be thinking of suing or de
manding that someone be ar
rested— or be threatened with
arrest himself.
In any case, the agency hear
ing the dispute decides that the
problem might be solved far
more quickly, fairly and inex
pensively if both sides can
agree to sit down together and
reason out an agreement.
The opponents are referred
to one of these dispute cen
ters. They can bring their
lawyers if they wish, but if not,
the dispute could potentially
be settled at no cost at all.
"Even when you have a good
small claims court, a judge can
listen for five minutes and de
cideone person is liable. Butto
get at the underlying problem,
people still have to sit together
and work things out," says
John Beal, an attorney for the
federal Law Enforcement Assis
tance Administration, which is
spending $600,000 to finance
Neighborhood justice Centers
in Atlanta, Los Angeles and
Kansas City, Mo.
The young man defaulting
on his furniture payments —
whom the center did not iden
tify — managed to persuade
the merchant to work out the
dispute at Atlanta's center. He
agreed to pay off his debt over
a nine-month period, and the
store agreed not to charge any

penalty.
The centers work in different
ways. The Atlanta center, for
instance, uses voluntary
mediators representing a
cross-section of race, sex, age
and pronomic backgrounds.
They mediate disputes and
suggest solutions, with a leg
ally binding contract the
hoped-for outcome.
Mediation does not always
succeed. Atlanta merchant
Dale Dasher and customer
Joyce Scurry, for instance, re
cently tried for half a day to set
tle a $21 argument over a man's
suit bought on time. Mediator
Charlie Phillips could not get
the parties to agree, and forc
ing a solution was out of the
question. So the two will prob
ably wind up in court.
More typically, the parties
will agree to a settlement. The
Atlanta center has handled
1479 cases since last March
with settlements in more than
80 percent of them, says center
director Linwood Slayton.
The center in Kansas City has
solved all but 37 percent of the
more than 500 cases it has
handled since March. And an
older program run by the Col
umbus, Ohio, city attorney's

office since 1971 boasts a suc
cess rate of over 90 percent
when both parties agree to ap
pear.
Whether the justice centers
are entirely voluntary is not so
clear-cut Ray, forinstance. will
offer mediation as an alterna
tive to a criminal charge — an
offer that can be pretty hard to
refuse. Or the mediator, in
handling a dispute, might pri
vately tell one party he does
not stand a chance in court and
had betteraccept a settlement.
Despite the potential civil
rights questions, the centers
appear to have support from
those who have used them and
from national and local bar as
sociations, which have helped
finance some.
The recent spread of the cen
ters, particularly in states like
Florida where eight cities now
have programs, is at least partly
a reflection of Attorney Gen
eral Griffin Bell's and Chief jus
tice Warren Burger's support
for neighborhood centers.
But at least as important has
been concern over the mount
ing public expense of dispens
ing justice in the courts. Mea
sured case-by-case, mediation
is clearly cheaper.

80 percent of them, says center
director Linwood Slayton.
The center in Kansas City has
solved all but 37 percent of the
more than 500 cases it has
handled since March. And an
older program run by the Col
umbus, Ohio, city attorney's

office since 1971 boasts a suc

when both parties agree to ap

Whether the justice centers

offer that can be pretty hard to
refuse. Or the mediator, in
handling a dispute, might pri
vately tell one party he does
not stand a chance in court and

Despite the potential civil
rights questions, the centers
appear to have support from
those who have used them and
from national and local bar as
sociations, which have helped
finance some.
The recent spread of the cen

Florida where eight cities now

a reflection of Attorney Gen

is clearly cheaper.
Atlanta (AP) — Itwas the kind
of case the already over
crowded courts could do with
out.
A young Atlanta man had
bought $400 worth of living
room furniture on an install
ment plan and tell behind on
his payments. The merchant
promptly filed suit.
Most prosecutors and
judges — worried about more
serious cases — want no part of
these hassles between store
and customers, neighbor and
neighbor, husband and wife —
where tempers can flare
beyond reason and sometimes
turn on the petty.
Still, these arguments wind
up in the courts, disputes over
a neighbor's dog trespassing
on a lawn, a shoving match in a
bar, something bought in a
store and not paid for on time.
But in Atlanta and about 20
other cities across the nation,
an alternative to court battles
has been spreading recently:
community dispute settlement
centers.
The idea is simple and goes
back to the days when personal
disputes were usually settled
not by a judge and jury but by a
respected elder in the com
munity, like a parish priest.
An individual who has a dis
pute with someone brings his
complaint to the police, a Bet
ter Business Bureau office, a
prosecutor or a judge. He may
be thinking of suing or de
manding that someone be ar
rested— or be threatened with
arrest himself.
In any case, the agency hear
ing the dispute decides that the
problem might be solved far
more quickly, fairly and inex
pensively if both sides can
agree to sit down together and
reason out an agreement.
The opponents are referred
to one of these dispute cen
ters. They can bring their
lawyers if they wish, but if not,
the dispute could potentially
be settled at no cost at all.
"Even when you have a good
small claims court, a judge can
listen for five minutes and de
cideone person is liable. Butto
get at the underlying problem,
people still have to sit together
and work things out," says
John Beal, an attorney for the
federal Law Enforcement Assis
tance Administration, which is
spending $600,000 to finance
Neighborhood justice Centers
in Atlanta, Los Angeles and
Kansas City, Mo.
The young man defaulting
on his furniture payments —
whom the center did not iden
tify — managed to persuade
the merchant to work out the
dispute at Atlanta's center. He
agreed to pay off his debt over
a nine-month period, and the
store agreed not to charge any

penalty.
The centers work in different
ways. The Atlanta center, for
instance, uses voluntary
mediators representing a
cross-section of race, sex, age
and pronomic backgrounds.
They mediate disputes and
suggest solutions, with a leg
ally binding contract the
hoped-for outcome.
Mediation does not always
succeed. Atlanta merchant
Dale Dasher and customer
Joyce Scurry, for instance, re
cently tried for half a day to set
tle a $21 argument over a man's
suit bought on time. Mediator
