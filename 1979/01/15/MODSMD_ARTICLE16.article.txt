# Welch, Belton star
## Cards snap losing streak, 80-69 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Regaining the accurate
shooting and fierce en
thusiasm that has charac
terized their successes this
season, the Stanford Cardinals
ended a four-game losing
streak Saturday afternoon at
Maples Pavilion by outlasting
Pacitic-10 Conference basket
ball rival Washington, 80-69.
Stanford thus escaped the
ignominy of falling below .500
for the first time. The Cards are
now 8-7 overall, and own a 2-4
mark in Pac-10 action.
)ust three seconds after the
regionally-televised game
began Kimberly Belton gave
the Cards a lead they never re
linquished with a lay-in off
center Tom Schmalzried's un
usually long tip.
The biggest scare came with
9:01 remaining to play when
james Woods slammed home
Bob Fronk's alley-oop pass to
bring Washington within 62-60.
Welch ends slump
Then Brian Welch simul
taneously ended his recent of
fensive slump and the Ftuskies'
rally with a pretty rainbow from
the right corner, a tough short
jumper and a 13-footer off a
fine pump fake that put Stan
ford ahead 68-62.
"We just wanted to take it
right to them," Belton said of
that period. "We thought we

had the game, and we didn't
want to be deprived of it."
Twice Washington closed
the gap to five, at 70-65 and
74-69, but each time Welch re
sponded with clutch tallies —
first a lay-in, then two free
throws — to finally muzzle the
Huskies.
"Today I was more con
scious of the drive," said
Welch. "Everybody was start
ing to guard me for the outside
shot, and with people playing
me tight, I have to concentrate
on going to the hoop."
The 6-foot-7 freshman
finished with a game-high 22
points '">n 9-for-14 shooting.
Such performances, Welch be
lieves, involve a snowball ef
fect.
"You hit one or two shots,
you get some confidence go
ing, and then you feel that
you'll make your shot no mat
ter what move you make,"
Welch said.
Marty scores
Welch's statement also
applied to the performance of
freshman guard Doug Marty.
Compensating for Wolfe Per
ry's surprising ineffectiveness,
Marty scored 10 points, swish
ing four-ot-four from the field
in the first half.
After falling behind 11-2,
Washington began running its
offense at a quicker tempo.
Forward Stan Walker particu
larly roused the Ftuskies, sink
ing three straight 16-footers to
help cut the margin to 15-12.
Marty's entry, however,
caused momentum's fickle
finger to point favorably at the
Cards. Marty's confidence was
evident as he canned a 15-
footer, two free throws, a nice
lean-in jumper, a challenging
12-footer and a 21-foot bomb
within the space of four mi
nutes. His last shot regained
the nine-point advantage for
Stanford at 29-20.
"I felt good and rested,"

Marty said, his face happily
alight. "I had the opportunities
a little more in this game. I've
felt I could play like this before,
but today I just had the
chance,"
Stanford kept lashing the
Huskies after Marty's heroics
ended. Holding a 31-24 lead,
the Cards dealt off seven un
answered points on Orlando
Ward's 12-foot turn-around
jumper, Jeff Ryan's smooth 21-
footer, Daryle Morgan's two
free throws and Tom Schmal
zried's one to extend the dif
ference to 14.
Biggest lead
Minutes later two free
throws by Welch gave Stanford
a 48-33 lead, its biggest of the
day. By halftime the Huskies
had crept to within 50-39, and
never trailed by more than nine
thereafter until Morgan made a
joyous breakaway slam-dunk
that set the final margin.
Card coach Dick Dißiaso said
that he and his men were con
scious of their lackluster per
formance Thursday night
against Washington State — to
a certain degree. "The
Washington State game has
been in our mind since it en
ded, but it wasn't in our mind
once this game began," Di-
Biaso asserted.
The marked increase in spirit
over the WSU game made all
the difference in the world.
"Stanford is a team that has to
play with emotion and inten
sity," Dißiaso said. "This has
been one of our trademarks,
and we did it today."
The outstanding contribu
tions from the substitutes
pleased Dißiaso considerably.
"We played 10 people in the
first half and they did an excel
lent job off the bench. Marty
didn't miss a shot. (Steve)
Crandell did an excellent job
defensively, and Ward was our
leading rebounder (he had a
game-high nine)."

DiBiaso believed that even
Perry, who shot just one-for
eight and scored a season-low
six points, helped the victory
cause. "Wolfe completely sac
rificed himself," said DiBiaso.
"He passed the hall instead of
going one-on-one."
Belton, meanwhile, sac
rificed nothing. He did nearly
everything well, scoring 17
points on 8-for-12 shooting,
and added eight rebounds and
five assists. "Belton did a
yeoman job," DiBiaso sum
med.
Poor free-throw shooting,
which earlier this season posed
as much of a problem as the
punting game did for the foot
ball team, appears to be a thing
of the past for the Cards, as
they hit 20 of 22 charity tosses
against the Huskier.
Well, it'sabout time, DiBiaso
essentially said. "We've shot
close to 16,000 tree throws
since October 15," he re
vealed. "Our goal was to lead
the nation. We'll have to make
every one for the rest of the
season to do that."

defensively, and Ward was our
leading rebounder (he had a
game-high nine)."

DiBiaso believed that even
Perry, who shot just one-for
eight and scored a season-low
six points, helped the victory
cause. "Wolfe completely sac
rificed himself," said DiBiaso.
"He passed the hall instead of
going one-on-one."
Belton, meanwhile, sac
rificed nothing. He did nearly
everything well, scoring 17
points on 8-for-12 shooting,
and added eight rebounds and
five assists. "Belton did a
yeoman job," DiBiaso sum
med.
Poor free-throw shooting,
which earlier this season posed
as much of a problem as the
punting game did for the foot
ball team, appears to be a thing
of the past for the Cards, as
they hit 20 of 22 charity tosses
against the Huskier.
Well, it'sabout time, DiBiaso
essentially said. "We've shot
close to 16,000 tree throws
since October 15," he re
vealed. "Our goal was to lead
the nation. We'll have to make
every one for the rest of the
season to do that."

THE WINGSPANS of forwards Kimherly Belton (41) and Andra Griffin (right) are shown here. Griffi
out-scored Belton 18-17, hut in the end Belton's Cardinals flew away with an 80-69 win.
Regaining the accurate
shooting and fierce en
thusiasm that has charac
terized their successes this
season, the Stanford Cardinals
ended a four-game losing
streak Saturday afternoon at
Maples Pavilion by outlasting
Pacitic-10 Conference basket
ball rival Washington, 80-69.
Stanford thus escaped the
ignominy of falling below .500
for the first time. The Cards are
now 8-7 overall, and own a 2-4
mark in Pac-10 action.
)ust three seconds after the
regionally-televised game
began Kimberly Belton gave
the Cards a lead they never re
linquished with a lay-in off
center Tom Schmalzried's un
usually long tip.
The biggest scare came with
9:01 remaining to play when
james Woods slammed home
Bob Fronk's alley-oop pass to
bring Washington within 62-60.
Welch ends slump
Then Brian Welch simul
taneously ended his recent of
fensive slump and the Ftuskies'
rally with a pretty rainbow from
the right corner, a tough short
jumper and a 13-footer off a
fine pump fake that put Stan
ford ahead 68-62.
"We just wanted to take it
right to them," Belton said of
that period. "We thought we

had the game, and we didn't
want to be deprived of it."
Twice Washington closed
the gap to five, at 70-65 and
74-69, but each time Welch re
sponded with clutch tallies —
first a lay-in, then two free
throws — to finally muzzle the
Huskies.
"Today I was more con
scious of the drive," said
Welch. "Everybody was start
ing to guard me for the outside
shot, and with people playing
me tight, I have to concentrate
on going to the hoop."
The 6-foot-7 freshman
finished with a game-high 22
points '">n 9-for-14 shooting.
Such performances, Welch be
lieves, involve a snowball ef
fect.
"You hit one or two shots,
you get some confidence go
ing, and then you feel that
you'll make your shot no mat
ter what move you make,"
Welch said.
Marty scores
Welch's statement also
applied to the performance of
freshman guard Doug Marty.
Compensating for Wolfe Per
ry's surprising ineffectiveness,
Marty scored 10 points, swish
ing four-ot-four from the field
in the first half.
After falling behind 11-2,
Washington began running its
offense at a quicker tempo.
Forward Stan Walker particu
larly roused the Ftuskies, sink
ing three straight 16-footers to
help cut the margin to 15-12.
Marty's entry, however,
caused momentum's fickle
finger to point favorably at the
Cards. Marty's confidence was
evident as he canned a 15-
footer, two free throws, a nice
lean-in jumper, a challenging
12-footer and a 21-foot bomb
within the space of four mi
nutes. His last shot regained
the nine-point advantage for
Stanford at 29-20.
"I felt good and rested,"

Marty said, his face happily
alight. "I had the opportunities
a little more in this game. I've
felt I could play like this before,
but today I just had the
chance,"
Stanford kept lashing the
Huskies after Marty's heroics
ended. Holding a 31-24 lead,
the Cards dealt off seven un
answered points on Orlando
Ward's 12-foot turn-around
jumper, Jeff Ryan's smooth 21-
footer, Daryle Morgan's two
free throws and Tom Schmal
zried's one to extend the dif
ference to 14.
Biggest lead
Minutes later two free
throws by Welch gave Stanford
a 48-33 lead, its biggest of the
day. By halftime the Huskies
had crept to within 50-39, and
never trailed by more than nine
thereafter until Morgan made a
joyous breakaway slam-dunk
that set the final margin.
Card coach Dick Dißiaso said
that he and his men were con
scious of their lackluster per
formance Thursday night
against Washington State — to
a certain degree. "The
Washington State game has
been in our mind since it en
ded, but it wasn't in our mind
once this game began," Di-
Biaso asserted.
The marked increase in spirit
over the WSU game made all
the difference in the world.
"Stanford is a team that has to
play with emotion and inten
sity," Dißiaso said. "This has
been one of our trademarks,
and we did it today."
The outstanding contribu
tions from the substitutes
pleased Dißiaso considerably.
"We played 10 people in the
first half and they did an excel
lent job off the bench. Marty
didn't miss a shot. (Steve)
Crandell did an excellent job
defensively, and Ward was our
leading rebounder (he had a
game-high nine)."

sponded with clutch tallies —
first a lay-in, then two free
throws — to finally muzzle the
Huskies.
"Today I was more con
scious of the drive," said
Welch. "Everybody was start
ing to guard me for the outside
shot, and with people playing
me tight, I have to concentrate
on going to the hoop."
The 6-foot-7 freshman
finished with a game-high 22
points '">n 9-for-14 shooting.
Such performances, Welch be
lieves, involve a snowball ef
fect.
"You hit one or two shots,
you get some confidence go
ing, and then you feel that
you'll make your shot no mat
ter what move you make,"
Welch said.
Marty scores
Welch's statement also
applied to the performance of
freshman guard Doug Marty.
Compensating for Wolfe Per
ry's surprising ineffectiveness,
Marty scored 10 points, swish
ing four-ot-four from the field
in the first half.
After falling behind 11-2,
Washington began running its
offense at a quicker tempo.
Forward Stan Walker particu
larly roused the Ftuskies, sink
ing three straight 16-footers to
help cut the margin to 15-12.
Marty's entry, however,
caused momentum's fickle
finger to point favorably at the
Cards. Marty's confidence was
evident as he canned a 15-
footer, two free throws, a nice
lean-in jumper, a challenging
12-footer and a 21-foot bomb
within the space of four mi
nutes. His last shot regained
the nine-point advantage for
Stanford at 29-20.
"I felt good and rested,"

Marty said, his face happily
alight. "I had the opportunities
a little more in this game. I've
felt I could play like this before,
but today I just had the
chance,"
Stanford kept lashing the
Huskies after Marty's heroics
ended. Holding a 31-24 lead,
the Cards dealt off seven un
answered points on Orlando
Ward's 12-foot turn-around
jumper, Jeff Ryan's smooth 21-
footer, Daryle Morgan's two
free throws and Tom Schmal
zried's one to extend the dif
ference to 14.
Biggest lead
Minutes later two free
throws by Welch gave Stanford
a 48-33 lead, its biggest of the
day. By halftime the Huskies
had crept to within 50-39, and
never trailed by more than nine
thereafter until Morgan made a
joyous breakaway slam-dunk
that set the final margin.
Card coach Dick Dißiaso said
that he and his men were con
scious of their lackluster per
formance Thursday night
against Washington State — to
a certain degree. "The
Washington State game has
been in our mind since it en
ded, but it wasn't in our mind
once this game began," Di-
Biaso asserted.
The marked increase in spirit
over the WSU game made all
the difference in the world.
"Stanford is a team that has to
play with emotion and inten
sity," Dißiaso said. "This has
been one of our trademarks,
and we did it today."
The outstanding contribu
tions from the substitutes
pleased Dißiaso considerably.
"We played 10 people in the
first half and they did an excel
lent job off the bench. Marty
didn't miss a shot. (Steve)
Crandell did an excellent job
defensively, and Ward was our
leading rebounder (he had a
game-high nine)."

DiBiaso believed that even
Perry, who shot just one-for
eight and scored a season-low
six points, helped the victory
cause. "Wolfe completely sac
rificed himself," said DiBiaso.
"He passed the hall instead of
going one-on-one."
Belton, meanwhile, sac
rificed nothing. He did nearly
everything well, scoring 17
points on 8-for-12 shooting,
and added eight rebounds and
five assists. "Belton did a
yeoman job," DiBiaso sum
med.
Poor free-throw shooting,
which earlier this season posed
as much of a problem as the
punting game did for the foot
ball team, appears to be a thing
of the past for the Cards, as
they hit 20 of 22 charity tosses
against the Huskier.
Well, it'sabout time, DiBiaso
essentially said. "We've shot
close to 16,000 tree throws
since October 15," he re
vealed. "Our goal was to lead
the nation. We'll have to make
every one for the rest of the
season to do that."

Regaining the accurate
shooting and fierce en
thusiasm that has charac
terized their successes this
season, the Stanford Cardinals
ended a four-game losing
streak Saturday afternoon at
Maples Pavilion by outlasting
Pacitic-10 Conference basket
ball rival Washington, 80-69.
Stanford thus escaped the
ignominy of falling below .500
for the first time. The Cards are
now 8-7 overall, and own a 2-4
mark in Pac-10 action.
)ust three seconds after the
regionally-televised game
began Kimberly Belton gave
the Cards a lead they never re
linquished with a lay-in off
center Tom Schmalzried's un
usually long tip.
The biggest scare came with
9:01 remaining to play when
james Woods slammed home
Bob Fronk's alley-oop pass to
bring Washington within 62-60.
Welch ends slump
Then Brian Welch simul
taneously ended his recent of
fensive slump and the Ftuskies'
rally with a pretty rainbow from
the right corner, a tough short
jumper and a 13-footer off a
fine pump fake that put Stan
ford ahead 68-62.
"We just wanted to take it
right to them," Belton said of
that period. "We thought we

had the game, and we didn't
want to be deprived of it."
Twice Washington closed
the gap to five, at 70-65 and
74-69, but each time Welch re
sponded with clutch tallies —
first a lay-in, then two free
throws — to finally muzzle the
Huskies.
"Today I was more con
