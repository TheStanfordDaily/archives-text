# First league win
## Women cagers beat Fresno St. 
### RICH MARTINEZ 
Stanford's women cagers travelled to
the fertile valley of the San Joaquin last
Saturday and harvested their first North
ern California Athletic Conference victory.
Defeating Fresno St. 64-50, the Cardinals
evened their league record at 1-1 and im
proved their overall record to 10-1.
Stanford's starting line-up consisted of
four freshmen and one sophomore as
junior guard Betsy Lough was out because
of a knee injury and senior Stephanie
Galef is just coming off an injury to her
jaw.
"This is a very good indication of the
depth of our team," stated coach Dottie
McCrea. "When a team loses two starters
and still plays winning ball, I'd say they
were loaded with talent."
The Cardinals received quite a scare in
the opening minutes of the game as the
Bulldogs scored 10 unanswered points to
take a 12-4 lead. McCrea then called a time
out and spent the minute in silence as she
let the team think of their mistakes.
"There was nothing I could tell them
three minutes into the game," explained
McCrea. "I bad just given them the game
plan. They just were not thinking on the
court."
The silence proved to be golden for the
women as they cashed in on some Bulldog
errors and, turning the momentum
around, outscored Fresno St. 12-2 while
taking back the lead, 16-14.
The game was sloppily but closely
played for the remainder of the half as
Stanford led at the intermission, 26-22.
An important plus for the Cardinals was
their handling of Fresno St. center Connie
Cooch. A 6-foot-1 transfer from the Uni

versity of Nevada-Las Vegas, Gooch plays
more like 6-J because of her superb jump
ing ability. She played a bit out of control
on Saturday, though, as she committed
three fouls in the first half and was held to
three baskets.
Obviously dissatisfied with her team's
20-minute performance, McCrea kept the
players in the locker room for the entire
intermission. Feeling her lecture would be
more beneficial than warming-up, McCrea
talked until a few seconds before the sec
ond half tip-off.
Her thinking paid off most noticeably as
a tenacious pressing defense and quick,
smart offense held Fresno St. scoreless for
the first 4'/j minutes of the second period
while running off 12 straight points and a
JB-22 lead.
Kathy Murphy, 16 points, and Jeanne
Ruark, 14 points, played brilliantly under
neath as they seemed to openly challenge
Gooch to defend them. The Bulldog's
center, who is loaded with talent but lacks
discipline, soon picked up her fourth foul
and found herself on the bench.
Angie Paccione, who added 16 points,
compounded the problems for a befud
dled Bulldog offense by making many
spectacular steals.
Gooch and Fresno St. then made a brief
surge by scoring six straight points as the
home crowd came to life. The Cardinals,
though, showed the stability they lacked
in the first half and the closest Fresno St.
ever came was 40-UJ.
Fifty-four turnovers were committed
during the game, 22 of which belonged to
the Cards. Many of them brought the
ominous figure of McCrea flying from the

bench, much to the crowd's amusement
and the players' disdain.
"I only yell and make such a fuss be
cause I know how good these girls are and
what they can do," explained McCrea. "If
they weren't as good, I wouldn't demand
as much. But they're young, they need
discipline and I don't ever want them be
coming complacent.
"By the time these girls become seniors
I won't have to do this at all because they
will already Fiave become well-disciplined
players."
