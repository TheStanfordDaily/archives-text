# Doctors debate recombinant DNA research
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
A University biochemist said
Saturday that there are "no known
hazards" in experimenting with re
combinant DNA, but a University of
California chancellor called the
biochemist's statements "over
simplified."
Dr. Ronald Davis from the
biochemistry department here and
Dr. Robert Sinsheimer, chancellor at
UC-Santa Cruz, were featured
speakers at a day-long public forum
on the relationship between scien
tists and the public in DNA research.
About 200 people attended the
forum, held in Fairchild Auditorium.
"The hazards of DNA have been
greatly exaggerated," Davis said.
"Almost everything that happens in a
laboratory test tube happens natur
ally in the outside world. All or

ganisms are probably exchanging
their DNA at very low rates."
He described the world as being
"one big pool of genes."
Combinations improbable
But Sinsheimer argued that many
genetic combinations are improba
ble in nature. "I doubt that a cotton
plant would mix genes with an
elephant," he said.
Sinsheimer added that hazards
exist because such combinations
could accidently escape the laborat
ory confines and replicate.
"Accidents can happen," he said.
"The consequences would be hard
to predict." He added that such
laboratory failures "could have a di
rect effect upon human beings."
Poor guidelines
Both Davis and Sinsheimer agreed
that the present National Institutes of
Health guidelines for DNA research

are "a disaster" both from a scien
tist's and a citizen's viewpoint.
Besides delaying risk assessment
experiments and forbidding the use
of new and possibly safer research
techniques, the guidelines offer no
appeals system, Davis said.
This has "demoralized all young
scientists," and has forced many re
searchers to work in Europe where
guidelines are less strict, he said.
Current DNA research centers
around ways to manufacture certain
body hormones and proteins, in
cluding insulin, interferon and an
tibodies.
Such research may also be applied
to agriculture and crop improve
ment. "It's not happening right now,
but I bet you this will come true,"
Davis said.
Scientists who stay in the United
States can find ways to work around

the guidelines by finding natural re
combinations and experimenting
with them, he added.
Sinsheimer said the guidelines are
inadequate because they do not
make clear who is to address the
ecological and long-term social is
sues of DNA research. He advocated
the formation of a "more visible citi
zen platform closer to the center of a
political platform."
Members of one forum workshop
later passed a resolution to appoint a
citizens' delegation which will dis
cuss the guidelines with California
legislators.
Ethics committee
The group will specifically address
the fact that the guidelines give no
rules for choosing public members
to serve on biomedical ethics com
mittees.
Workshop spokesmen who intro
duced the resolution said they were
concerned that public members
were not being selected in the "most
public way possible/'
Members of another forum work
shop told the panel they were con
cerned about facilities for recombin
ant DNA workers and urged mem
bers of the United Stanford
Employees union to bring up health
and safety issues in contract talks.
Davis had earlier told the group
that recombinant DNA workers were
not getting sick.
