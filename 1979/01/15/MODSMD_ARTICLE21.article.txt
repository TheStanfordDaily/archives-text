## Assistant coach Green picked by Walsh for 49ers 
### 
Rod Dowhower, newly
appointed Stanford head toot
hall coach, suffered his first loss
Friday when assistant coach De
nnis Green joined Bill Walsh on
the San Francisco 49ers staff.
The 29-year-old Green served
under Walsh, who left Stanford
to take the 49ers' head coaching
job last week, during the 1977
and 1978 seasons as running
backs coach. At San Francisco
Green will handle special teams
and receivers.
"We would love to have had
him stay," Dowhower said yes
terday of Green. "FHe's a fine
man and an excellent football
coach. He contributed greatly to
the development of the prog
ram."
Dowhower realized, though,
that Green's move was probably
better for himself in the long
run. "On the other hand, he has
his family and future to think
of," Dowhower said.
Dowhower experienced a
similar situation as an assistant
coach at San Diego State. When
Don Coryell, the SDS head

coach, took over the St. Louis
Cardinals in 1973, he named
Dowhower to coach the St.
Louis quarterbacks and receiv
ers.
Dowhower had gained a mea
sure of fame at SDS, but fol
lowed Coryell to the NFL, exp
laining, "I thought in the final
analysis that it would be good for
my future, and it was." There
fore, Dowhower has "a lot of
feeliim for Dennis' decision."

Dowhower anticipates no
problems with replacing Green.
To maintain the racial balance of
the coaching staff, however,
Dowhower plans to name a
black man to make up for the
loss of Green, who was also
black.
"The staff should reflect the
team and the University,"
Dowhower reasoned. "That's a
way we can eliminate any credi
bility gap."
