Endorsement of Iranian gov't debated
Tehran, Iran — Thousands of protesters chanting "Death to
the shah!" marched peacefully through the streets of Tehran
yesterday demanding that the monarchy be abolished and an
Islamic republic be set up to replace Iran's new civilian gov
ernment.
As they marched, the Iranian Parliament opened debate on
whether to endorse the government of Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar, a step that would pave the way for Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to leave his strife-torn nation.
Twenty-two of the 268 legislators of the Majlis, the lower
house of Parliament, spoke yesterday, half in favor of Bakhtiar s
government and half against. The Majlis, which traditionally
does not meet on Mondays, scheduled a vote of confidence for
tomorrow. The Senate will debate the issue today.
Political observers said the new government would not re
ceive rubber-stamp approval but that both houses probably will
give Bakhtiar the vote of confidence that would allow him to
begin carrying out a program aimed at pulling Iran from the
brink of economic and political collapse.
In related events Ayatullah Khomaini, an Iranian religious
leader opposed to the Shah of Iran, said yesterday he probably
will announce establishment of an Islamic state in Iran in a few
days.
Khomaini said he would not have any position in the future
government but that he would supervise others. Asked if he
would be, in effect, the strongman of Iran, he replied, "You
may assume so."
Carter: another summit necessary?
Atlanta — President Jimmy Carter said yesterday he would
not hesitate to call the leaders of Egypt and Israel to another
summit meeting if that is necessary to get a peace treaty.
Speaking to a black audience at Ebenezer Baptist Church, the
president said a U.S. delegation of negotiators was being sent
to the Middle East this week "to resolve the last difference on
language" that has bogged the treaty down.
After the language problems are worked out, Carter said: "If
necessary, I will not hesitate to call Sadat and Begin to a meeting

with me again to get a peace treaty."
At Dobbins Air Force Base later, the president said he hoped
negotiators would make rapid progress now that they have time
to reassess their difficulties.
However, the president said that after negotiators work out
language there may be political difficulties deciding how
rapidly to carry out some of the treaty's provisions.
Carter said if representatives of each nation were not suc
cessful in working out those difficulties "then I would without
any further delay be willing to get together with the heads of
state."
Heavy snow wreaks havoc in Midwest
Icy cold gripped the Midwest yesterday after a killer storm
that took the lives of at least 22 people, stranded thousands of
travelers and unleashed a vicious blizzard on Chicago.
The heavy snows brought activity to a halt in many parts of
Illinois, Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin as records for low temp
eratures were set from Pueblo, Colo., east to Springfield, Mo.,
and south to Austin, Texas.
O'Hare International Airport, the world's busiest, was closed
early Saturday when snow-moving equipment could not move.
It was still closed yesterday. FAA duty officer Loretta
Bridgeforth said airport officials planned to reopen the facility
today at 5 a.m.
Gov. )ames Thompson proclaimed the northern half of Il
linois a disaster area yesterday and requested federal aid for
snow removal in Rockford and Winnebago counties.
Thompson also ordered National Guardsmen to assist some
local governments in snow removal.
In Wisconsin 12 to 15 inches of snow brought the southern
and eastern parts of the state to a standstill, as extreme subzero
temperatures added to difficulties. Snow clearing crews were
just starting to get back on the roads late yesterday afternoon.
In Indiana the storm dumped more than 16 inches of snow,
paralyzing the northern part of the state as it blocked roads,
stranded vehicles and caused at least one traffic fatality, state
police reported.
South Haven, Mich., was cut off from the rest of the state

over the weekend as Michigan was blanketed by up to 15 inches
of snow. Snow, freezing rain and 35 mph winds closed roads
throughout Michigan.
96th Congress convenes today
Washington — The 96th Congress convenes today with most
of its leaders selected, leaving the battle for House Appropria
tions Committee chairman one of the major contests remain
ing.
In an uphill struggle, House liberals are trying to buck the
seniority system and persuade the Democratic caucus to seat
Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.) as chairman of the Appropria
tions Committee instead of conservative Rep. Jamie Whitten
(D-Miss.).
The outcome will be important in a year in which inflation
and federal spending are shaping up as the major domestic
issues facing the new budget-minded Congress.
Today's activities in both House and Senate will be mostly
ceremonial and housekeeping chores, with members being
sworn in and already-designated leaders approved for new
two-year terms.
Despite COP gains in November, Democrats still firmly con
trol both chambers, with a 59-41 margin in the Senate and a
277-158 edge in the House.
A move also may be made to bar Rep. Daniel Flood (D-Pa.)
from retaining his chairmanship of a labor-health appropria
tions subcommittee while under indictment for bribery and
other charges.
And House Republicans are expected to try to expel Rep.
Charles Diggs (D-Mich.) from the House entirely. Diggs is ap
pealing a three-year sentence on a federal payroll fraud convic
tion.
Expulsion would require a two-thirds vote of the House.
Today's weather
Occasional showers, locally heavy, likely today. Clearing to
night then fair tomorrow. Colder nights. Lows tonight in the
mid 30s to low 40s with chance of local frost. Highs in the low
50s. Chance of rain 60 percent today.
