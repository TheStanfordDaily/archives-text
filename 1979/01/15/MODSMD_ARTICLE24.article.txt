# Canadian minister urges unity in Quebec
## 
### GAYLE ASHTON 
Marc LaLonde, Canada's minister of justice,
voiced a firm belief in continued Canadian
unity in an address given to the Commonwealth
Club in San Francisco Friday.
LaLonde, a Quebecker, emphasized the
necessity of understanding the divisions within
French Canada in order to understand
Quebec's separatist movement. Flowever, he
said the flexibility of federalism, constitutional
reform and continued unity is the best and
most likely path for the future.
Virtually none of French Canada accepts the
idea of cultural assimilation, Lelonde said. At
issue is the bestway in which to achieve cultural
security, he said.
Some Quebeckers feel that the boundary of a
nation should rest on the lines of language,
culture and history. Others see independent as
a radical solution to the problem, and feel that a
multilingual country is possible as well as de
sirable.

In economic terms, LaLonde said that some
see an independent Quebec as a type of North
American Sweden with a more active role for its
government. Others see that participation in a
federal government also brings a share in grea
ter resources.
Independent Quebec
LaLonde emphasized that an independent
Quebec means either tax increases for a pro
vince already highly taxed or cuts in services.
LaLonde said the separatist movement began
in the 19605. Grievances centered on the
English-speaking character of the federal gov
ernment and the relatively poor place of French
Canadians in economic life.
Party formed
In 1967 separatist groups joined to form the
Parti Quebecois (PC)). Only 15 to 20 percent of
Quebeckers were willing to vote for a party
which advocated immediate independence,
and only .JO to 35 percent would vote for inde
pendence even if it meant an economic union

with the rest of Canada, LaLonde said.
The PQ won in 1976 by changing its plat
form. The PQ said they would work within the
framework of federalism, but hold a referen
dum on the question of independence during
the party's term.
The referendum has not been held and in the
past two years, LaLonde said, "speculation on
the matter has become a national sport." The
PQ remains vague about the exact wording of
the referendum because of divisions within the
province, according to LaLonde.
LaLonde said "there are always tensions in a
federal system." One concern for the future
involves the upcoming parliamentary elec
tions, which Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau
must call sometime before the summer.
If the Conservatives were to gain a majority in
Parliament over the Liberals, LaLonde said he
felt that this might cause a polarization of the
vote between French-speaking and English
speaking Canada, and exacerbate tensions.
