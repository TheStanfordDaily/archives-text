# Assaulted secretary's grievance rejected by University arbitrator
## 
### BRAD CRYSTAL 
The case of Barbara Honegger, a former University
secretary physically assaulted by Psychology and
Psychiatry Prof. Karl Pribram, has come to a conclusion.
In a Dec. 16 "Catch-22" decision, a University
appointed arbitrator rejected Honegger's request for
revision of the University's grievance policy, ruling that
the matter was beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator.
Honegger was seeking a "special channel of communi
cation" to protect secretaries working for Pribram.
The grievance decision marks the end of the case that
began more than three years ago. Honegger alleged that
on Oct. 29, 1975, while working as Pribram's personal
secretary, Pribram struck her several times on the head
and back, smashing her glasses. Her account is acknow
ledged by Peter Carpenter, then assistant vice president
for medical affairs and hearing officer.
According to Honegger's unchallenged testimony,
from the first week of her employment (Aug. 7, 1974)
until the assault, Pribram often vented his displeasure
with various aspects of her work by shooting.
Pribram claims he immediately took blame for the
October incident. Reflecting on the incident, Pribram
conceded a susceptibility to bursts of temper and said,
"I should not have gotten so angry."
lekyll and Hyde
Honegger labeled Pribram a "Dr. lekyll and Mr.
Hyde" personality. "No one should have to interact with
him," she said.
Honegger's observations are corroborated by another
former Pribram secretary who explained, "When there
is no pressure on him, when his personal life is going
smoothly, he behaves normally. At the time of the as
sault, his personal and professional life were in an up
roar." She said that, like Honegger, she was often the
victim of verbal abuse.
In response to the assault, Honegger filed a civil suit
against Pribram seeking $50,000 in damages. The lawsuit
was settled out of court last )une by an agreed payment
of $8000 to Honegger, paid through University insur
ance.
Disciplinary action
In February 1976 the University took disciplinary ac
tion against Pribram, placing him on two year's proba
tion and cutting his salary by $3000 for one year. The
probationary agreement negotiated by the office of Uni
versity President Richard Lyman stipulated that if "dur
ing the period of his probation, Prof. Pribram struck a
member of the University or anyone on campus, it might
be cause for dismissal."
Pribram's probationary period ended October 1977.
His status and tenure were not affected.
Although Honegger said she believes she never re
ceived appropriate financial compensation for the inci

dent, she added, "I really feel with the adverse publicity
to Dr. Pribram and the $3000 salary reduction, he's suf
fered enough."
Stronger action needed
Honegger, a 1969 graduate and presently a research
associate at Washington Research Center in San Fran
cisco, still asserts that the University should have taken
stronger action. "Ideally I think Karl Pribram should
have been fired on the spot," she said.
Honegger contends the University demonstrated a
lack of consistency in its handling of her case. "To dis
miss former English Prof. Bruce Franklin for allegedly
inciting others to violence (during the riots here in 1971)
and to fine Pribram for active violence against another
human being makes a mockery of the entire disciplinary
procedure," she wrote in a 1976 Daily column.
In Honegger's first grievance to the University, sub
mitted in November 1975, she sought and won retroac
tive job classification, back pay and paid overtime for her
work under Pribram.
University obligated
Her second grievance, the one decided last month,
requested a "set of proposed protective and corrective"
measures for Pribram's secretaries. "I believe Stanford
has an obligation to make it easy for employees of
people like Pribram to anonymously report abuse."
One source in the Department of Psychology esti
mates that from 15 to 20 secretaries came and left bet
ween Honegger's employment and that of the present
secretary. According to the source, many of these sec
retaries departed in tears after working less than an
hour.
Despite the reports of Pribram's irascibility, the Uni
versity claims "Dr. Pribram's present secretary perceives
no danger, enjoys working for her supervisor, and be
lieves no protective measures are needed."
Not a failure
Admitting that it was a "long shot" attempt, Honegger
says she does not regard the rejection of her "protective
measures'' plan as a failure since the arbitrator, )une
Weisberger, recognized the validity of her requests.
Weisberger, while turning down the plan, recom
mended that the University "re-explore the possibility of
a special role for the University Ombudsman's office" so
as to "avoid a repetition of the Oct. 29 incident."
Although Honegger claims to be "over it now," she
maintains that Pribram owes her an apology. Pribram
contends an apology was written, but may never have
been submitted.
Grievances like Honegger's are rare, but are likely to
become even rarer. As of Dec. 1, grievances can only be
filed after the grievant is no longer a University
employee, a restriction that would have prevented Hon
egger from initiating her complaints.

The grievance decision marks the end of the case that
began more than three years ago. Honegger alleged that
on Oct. 29, 1975, while working as Pribram's personal
secretary, Pribram struck her several times on the head
and back, smashing her glasses. Her account is acknow
ledged by Peter Carpenter, then assistant vice president
for medical affairs and hearing officer.
According to Honegger's unchallenged testimony,
from the first week of her employment (Aug. 7, 1974)
until the assault, Pribram often vented his displeasure
with various aspects of her work by shooting.
Pribram claims he immediately took blame for the
October incident. Reflecting on the incident, Pribram
conceded a susceptibility to bursts of temper and said,
"I should not have gotten so angry."
lekyll and Hyde
Honegger labeled Pribram a "Dr. lekyll and Mr.
Hyde" personality. "No one should have to interact with
him," she said.
Honegger's observations are corroborated by another
former Pribram secretary who explained, "When there
is no pressure on him, when his personal life is going
smoothly, he behaves normally. At the time of the as
sault, his personal and professional life were in an up
roar." She said that, like Honegger, she was often the
victim of verbal abuse.
In response to the assault, Honegger filed a civil suit
against Pribram seeking $50,000 in damages. The lawsuit
was settled out of court last )une by an agreed payment
of $8000 to Honegger, paid through University insur
ance.
Disciplinary action
In February 1976 the University took disciplinary ac
tion against Pribram, placing him on two year's proba
tion and cutting his salary by $3000 for one year. The
probationary agreement negotiated by the office of Uni
versity President Richard Lyman stipulated that if "dur
ing the period of his probation, Prof. Pribram struck a
member of the University or anyone on campus, it might
be cause for dismissal."
Pribram's probationary period ended October 1977.
His status and tenure were not affected.
Although Honegger said she believes she never re
ceived appropriate financial compensation for the inci

dent, she added, "I really feel with the adverse publicity
to Dr. Pribram and the $3000 salary reduction, he's suf
fered enough."
Stronger action needed
Honegger, a 1969 graduate and presently a research
associate at Washington Research Center in San Fran
cisco, still asserts that the University should have taken
stronger action. "Ideally I think Karl Pribram should
have been fired on the spot," she said.
Honegger contends the University demonstrated a
lack of consistency in its handling of her case. "To dis
miss former English Prof. Bruce Franklin for allegedly
inciting others to violence (during the riots here in 1971)
and to fine Pribram for active violence against another
human being makes a mockery of the entire disciplinary
procedure," she wrote in a 1976 Daily column.
In Honegger's first grievance to the University, sub
mitted in November 1975, she sought and won retroac
tive job classification, back pay and paid overtime for her
work under Pribram.
University obligated
Her second grievance, the one decided last month,
requested a "set of proposed protective and corrective"
measures for Pribram's secretaries. "I believe Stanford
has an obligation to make it easy for employees of
people like Pribram to anonymously report abuse."
One source in the Department of Psychology esti
mates that from 15 to 20 secretaries came and left bet
ween Honegger's employment and that of the present
secretary. According to the source, many of these sec
retaries departed in tears after working less than an
hour.
Despite the reports of Pribram's irascibility, the Uni
versity claims "Dr. Pribram's present secretary perceives
no danger, enjoys working for her supervisor, and be
lieves no protective measures are needed."
Not a failure
Admitting that it was a "long shot" attempt, Honegger
says she does not regard the rejection of her "protective
measures'' plan as a failure since the arbitrator, )une
Weisberger, recognized the validity of her requests.
Weisberger, while turning down the plan, recom
mended that the University "re-explore the possibility of
a special role for the University Ombudsman's office" so
as to "avoid a repetition of the Oct. 29 incident."
Although Honegger claims to be "over it now," she
maintains that Pribram owes her an apology. Pribram
contends an apology was written, but may never have
been submitted.
Grievances like Honegger's are rare, but are likely to
become even rarer. As of Dec. 1, grievances can only be
filed after the grievant is no longer a University
employee, a restriction that would have prevented Hon
egger from initiating her complaints.
The case of Barbara Honegger, a former University
secretary physically assaulted by Psychology and
Psychiatry Prof. Karl Pribram, has come to a conclusion.
In a Dec. 16 "Catch-22" decision, a University
appointed arbitrator rejected Honegger's request for
revision of the University's grievance policy, ruling that
the matter was beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator.
