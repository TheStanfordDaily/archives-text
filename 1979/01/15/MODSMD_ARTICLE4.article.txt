# Following 310-mile, three-week blitz
## Troops take last Cambodian stronghold 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — Viet
namese troops captured the last
urban stronghold of the defeated
Cambodian government's forces,
but the retreating soldiers struck
back in isolated attacks and set up
mountain and island guerrilla bases
to carry on the war, Thai sources said
yesterday.
"We will fight until we die," one of
the Cambodian loyalists in the Thai
border area reportedly told a Thai of
ficial.
Armor-led Vietnamese troops
were reported within 15 miles of the
Thai border, having completed a
310-mile blitz through Cambodia in
three weeks. The radio station of the
provisional Phnom Penh govern
ment installed by the Vietnamese
said the fall of Premier Pol Pot's re
gime touched off nationwide celeb
rations.
Thai sources said the northwestern
city of Battambang, Cambodia's
second-largest, had fallen to the Vie
tnamese but that some defenders
"melted away" and were staging
hit-and-run attacks against the vic
tors. Sources also said there were
signs of stiff counter-attacks in other
areas, some of which had been
bypassed in the lightning drive by
Vietnam's tanks and mechanized in
fantry.
"In many areas right now, the Vie
tnamese only control the space that a
tank comes through," said one
analyst, who like the others asked
that he not be identified.

Western sources here said soldiers
of the defeated regime were retreat
ing to the Cardamom and Elephant
mountains in the Southwest. Thai
sources said some loyalists were set
ting up headquarters on the island of
Kong off southwestern Cambodia
and that fighting continued near the
deepwater port of Kompong Som.
The provisional government of the
Hanoi-backed Kampuchea Cam
bodia National United Front for Na
tional Salvation had claimed to con
trol the port.
Western sources said Kong, in the
Gulf of Thailand just off the Cambo
dian coast, would be a logical supply
link to the mountain bases if China
carried out its promise to back a
guerrilla war.
Thai sources said Vietnamese
troops were on the approaches to
the Cambodian-Thai border town of
Poipet, which is still in the hands of
the former regime's troops.
But both Thai and Western analysts
said the Vietnamese may leave the
assault on Poipet to the forces of the
new Cambodian rebel government.
Officially Vietnam denies its troops
are involved in the invasion, so its
forces presumably would not want to
stray within sight of the border.
Western sources said 10 battalions
of "Khmer Krom" — Cambodians
who long have resided in southern
Vietnam — had recently been moved
into Cambodia and might serve as
occupation troops in an effort to pre
sent the war as strictly a Cambodian

affair. The roughly 3000 troops were
trained and used by the Americans to
fight in Cambodia during the In
dochina War.
Thai analysts said there had been a
great deal of movement, difficult to
follow, in the border area of north
western Cambodia — site of the last
major stand of Pol Pot's army, which
once numbered 80,000 to 100,000
men. Its present strength is not
known.
Thailand agreed to accept about
400 wounded soldiers of the fallen
regime from the Cambodian border
town of Nimit, despite a Thai policy

against accepting refugees. But un
specified problems reportedly arose
in these arrangements and the
wounded were not brought across
the border immediately.
Over the past four years, Cambo
dian soldiers staged periodic raids
into Thai border areas, sometimes
killing villagers.
Military sources at the frontier
crossing town of Aranyaprathet,
Thailand, said the wounded would
be accepted because of pressure
from China, primary backer of the
fallen government.
Thai defense officials, meanwhile,
reinforced their troops along the
border, and fresh bunkers were dug
at Aranyaprathet, 125 miles east of
Bangkok.
Unlike the influx of refugees after
the 1975 Khmer Rouge communist
takeover in Cambodia, only a few
hundred refugees have entered 1 hai
land. Thai border officers speculated
the rapid Vietnamese advance may
have cut escape routes for the troops
and many of the 20,000 Chinese ad
visers believed in Cambodia.
The official media of the new
Phnom Penh government claimed
people throughout Cambodia re
joiced at the downfall of the Pol Pot
government — an ouster engineered
by the Vietnamese, neighbors for
whom Cambodians have a deep
seated historical hatred.
"Two things Cambodians like to
do best are eat and make love, and
the last regime wouldn't let them do
much of either," said one diplomat,
referring to strict rationing and re
strictive rules about sex under the
harih Khmer Rouge regime.
In Moscow, the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda said events in
Cambodia marked "a victory over
the reactionary dictatorial regime of
Peking puppets." The Soviets re
cently signed a friendship and coop
eration treaty with Vietnam.
Radio broadcasts by the new gov
ernment repeated that freedom
would be restored in Cambodia. The
radio played songs about the cruelty
of the former leaders and about an
upcoming revival of traditional Cam
bodian life.

bypassed in the lightning drive by
Vietnam's tanks and mechanized in
fantry.
"In many areas right now, the Vie
tnamese only control the space that a
tank comes through," said one
analyst, who like the others asked
that he not be identified.

Western sources here said soldiers
of the defeated regime were retreat
ing to the Cardamom and Elephant
mountains in the Southwest. Thai
sources said some loyalists were set
ting up headquarters on the island of
Kong off southwestern Cambodia
and that fighting continued near the
deepwater port of Kompong Som.
The provisional government of the
Hanoi-backed Kampuchea Cam
bodia National United Front for Na
tional Salvation had claimed to con
trol the port.
Western sources said Kong, in the
Gulf of Thailand just off the Cambo
dian coast, would be a logical supply
link to the mountain bases if China
carried out its promise to back a
guerrilla war.
Thai sources said Vietnamese
troops were on the approaches to
the Cambodian-Thai border town of
Poipet, which is still in the hands of
the former regime's troops.
But both Thai and Western analysts
said the Vietnamese may leave the
assault on Poipet to the forces of the
new Cambodian rebel government.
Officially Vietnam denies its troops
are involved in the invasion, so its
forces presumably would not want to
stray within sight of the border.
Western sources said 10 battalions
of "Khmer Krom" — Cambodians
who long have resided in southern
Vietnam — had recently been moved
into Cambodia and might serve as
occupation troops in an effort to pre
sent the war as strictly a Cambodian

affair. The roughly 3000 troops were
trained and used by the Americans to
fight in Cambodia during the In
dochina War.
Thai analysts said there had been a
great deal of movement, difficult to
follow, in the border area of north
western Cambodia — site of the last
major stand of Pol Pot's army, which
once numbered 80,000 to 100,000
men. Its present strength is not
known.
Thailand agreed to accept about
400 wounded soldiers of the fallen
regime from the Cambodian border
town of Nimit, despite a Thai policy

against accepting refugees. But un
specified problems reportedly arose
in these arrangements and the
wounded were not brought across
the border immediately.
Over the past four years, Cambo
dian soldiers staged periodic raids
into Thai border areas, sometimes
killing villagers.
Military sources at the frontier
crossing town of Aranyaprathet,
Thailand, said the wounded would
be accepted because of pressure
from China, primary backer of the
fallen government.
Thai defense officials, meanwhile,
reinforced their troops along the
border, and fresh bunkers were dug
at Aranyaprathet, 125 miles east of
Bangkok.
Unlike the influx of refugees after
the 1975 Khmer Rouge communist
takeover in Cambodia, only a few
hundred refugees have entered 1 hai
land. Thai border officers speculated
the rapid Vietnamese advance may
have cut escape routes for the troops
and many of the 20,000 Chinese ad
visers believed in Cambodia.
The official media of the new
Phnom Penh government claimed
people throughout Cambodia re
joiced at the downfall of the Pol Pot
government — an ouster engineered
by the Vietnamese, neighbors for
whom Cambodians have a deep
seated historical hatred.
"Two things Cambodians like to
do best are eat and make love, and
the last regime wouldn't let them do
much of either," said one diplomat,
referring to strict rationing and re
strictive rules about sex under the
harih Khmer Rouge regime.
In Moscow, the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda said events in
Cambodia marked "a victory over
the reactionary dictatorial regime of
Peking puppets." The Soviets re
cently signed a friendship and coop
eration treaty with Vietnam.
Radio broadcasts by the new gov
ernment repeated that freedom
would be restored in Cambodia. The
radio played songs about the cruelty
of the former leaders and about an
upcoming revival of traditional Cam
bodian life.
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — Viet
namese troops captured the last
urban stronghold of the defeated
Cambodian government's forces,
but the retreating soldiers struck
back in isolated attacks and set up
mountain and island guerrilla bases
to carry on the war, Thai sources said
yesterday.
"We will fight until we die," one of
the Cambodian loyalists in the Thai
border area reportedly told a Thai of
ficial.
Armor-led Vietnamese troops
were reported within 15 miles of the
Thai border, having completed a
310-mile blitz through Cambodia in
three weeks. The radio station of the
provisional Phnom Penh govern
ment installed by the Vietnamese
said the fall of Premier Pol Pot's re
gime touched off nationwide celeb
rations.
Thai sources said the northwestern
city of Battambang, Cambodia's
second-largest, had fallen to the Vie
tnamese but that some defenders
"melted away" and were staging
hit-and-run attacks against the vic
tors. Sources also said there were
signs of stiff counter-attacks in other
areas, some of which had been
bypassed in the lightning drive by
Vietnam's tanks and mechanized in
