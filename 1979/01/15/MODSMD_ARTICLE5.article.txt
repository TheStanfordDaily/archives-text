# Enrollment increases in trial culture series

### SUSAN ESSOYAN 
Enrollment in the experimental
Western Culture series has increased
this quarter, with both freshmen and
faculty endorsing the class.
About 95 out of 100 available
spaces are filled, approximately 25
more than last quarter, said Ruth
Hoagof the Humanities and Sciences
office.
If successful, the course will be
come one of several three-quarter
sequences to fulfill the proposed
Western Culture requirement, ac
cording to Philosophy Prof. John
Perry, chairman of the Western Cul
ture Pilot Program Committee. Perry
said the requirement would be insti
tuted in 1980, at the earliest.
The Faculty Senate endorsed the
Western Culture requirement in
1976, and the University is now ex
perimenting with one of several
course sequences designed to fulfill
the requirement.
Courses must be taught by "ex
perienced teacher-scholars" and
must actively engage students with
the primary works of Western civili
zation in order to qualify for the
program, Perry said.
Favorable
Faculty and students involved in
last quarter's course commended
the "great works-small class" ap
proach.
Religious Studies Prof. Edwin
Good called his Western Culture I
section "one of the best classes I've
ever had." Although the freshmen
had little background, they came to
class eager and prepared, he said.
Freshmen who volunteered to take
the course were also enthusiastic.
However, some freshmen said they
did not think the course should be
required.
Heavy reading load
Freshman Brad Carpenter said that
although he was "thrilled" to have a
chance to study with Classics Prof.
Antony Raubitschek, "I don't see
how they could require the course
because the reading load is so big
that you have to really want to read
the works."
Freshman Joanne Chou added that
it might be ethnocentric to require
the course because "not all students

are interested in Western cuture.
Some might like to study Eastern cul
ture," she said.
Many faculty, however, consider
some form of a Western Culture re
quirement a necessity. History Prof.
Lewis Spitz said students here may
be "bright as all hell, but they are
totally ignorant of the great works of
the past."
'Pragmatic' advisers
Spitz, coordinator of the program,
said he resented the fact that many
students who had originally signed
up for the course were told to drop it
by "pragmatic" advisers. He said he
wants the sequence required so "no
damn-fool adviser can screw things
up."
Higher tuition seems to be push
ing students toward practical skills
leading directly to jobs, Spitz said.
Perry said he is optimistic about
the Western Culture program. He
said his committee has received
eight or nine "very exciting" propos
als for course sequences. The prop
osed sequences include courses al
ready in existence, but modified to
meet the new requirement, such as
Humanities 61 to 63 and History 1 to
3. It also includes entirely new sequ
ences like Western Culture, and a
Values, Technology and Society
Dept. proposal.
Variety
Classics Prof. Edward Spofford
said that parallel course sequences
should be as different from each
other as possible if they are to be
required. He said he has volunteered
to teach one section of three quar
ters of Western Culture
Cost may limit the program be
cause the small-group approach is
very expensive, according to Spitz.
Former Provost William Miller's es
timate of $208,000 for the program is
"not nearly enough," Spitz said.
Both Spitz and Perry, however,
said the administration should not
quibble about expenses. "After all,
this is something that will affect every
Stanford student," Spitz said.
Perry added that if the track is suc
cessful, the University will have to
stand the expense. "It's as good a
way as any to spend the money," he
said.
