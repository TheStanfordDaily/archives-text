Most of what is happening in
Iran today is certainly not un
expected. Following the long,
suppressive and unresponsive
reign of Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi the current explosion
should have been anticipated.
What makes the crisis extraor
dinary is the magnitude of the
internal belligerence and the
international importance of
Iran. It also offers ample evi
dence that the U.S. foreign pol
icy is bankrupt.
The norms of interpretation
of both U.S. political analysts
and policy makers preclude
several important variables.
The world has changed. The
Cold War principle of spheres
of influence, a notion that con
siders the world largely as an
exploitable realm, inhabited by
weak-willed beings, should
have been abandoned long
ago. Yet, former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger only last
week talked of a world at
"rough parity" with the Soviet
Union.
The idea that the United
States, through the CIA (as it
has been openly admitted in
the case of the shah) could in
stall a ruler, guardian of U.S.
interests, is not of course li
mited to Iran. This method, a
remnant of old, pre-American
imperialistic practices has
been in wide use since % World
War 11.
In vain, a few enlightened
Americans and foreigners have
warned of the pitfalls of this
practice. It does not take a
great political scientist to see
that support of repressive re
gimes could backfire; that a
large share of America's cur
rent worldwide woes derives
from its own foreign policy ac
tions.
Two elements of the ongo
ing analyses of the Iranian
crisis are subtle but indicative
proofs that lessons are yet to
be learned.
— A major criticism of the
intelligence agencies is that

they did not "predict" the
shah's trouble. A news media
account blamed this on the
ClA's dependence on the Sav
vak, Iran's secret police, for in
formation. The analysts, in
other words, are irked that the
CIA did not forewarn us so that
early appropriate action could
be taken. They rarely mention
the ClA's involvement in the
installation of the shah and his
subsequent autocratic rule.
— An all-out effort has been
undertaken to unearth the
Soviet involvement. Following
months of blaming the "fanatic
Moslems" the next culprits
would naturally be the com
munist provocateurs, oiled by
the Soviets. Terms such as "Is
lamic Marxists" have been
coined and drew international
sarcasm. Although the Soviets
would have an interest in the
erosion of U.S. influence in the
area, their involvement has
been minimal.
Truth is that the U.S. policy
makers' thinking is grossly in
adequate because it omits the
will of the people of many
countries. It is not empty re
volutionary rhetoric to make
references to the people. It
should not be surprising that
the people of any country
would eventually revolt against
a tyrant and in the process turn
against his patrons.
This sentiment, already in ef
fect in several countries is cur
rently exploding in Iran and
brewing in a number of other
lands. It is not that the United
States does not have the power
to impose policies upon other
countries. Few people, how
ever, today advocate the force
ful usurpation of other nations'
wealth. Such an act, unless it is
in total collusion with the
Soviet Union, a possibility cur
rently remote, would most
surely generate a world con
flict.
It is this line of thought that
produced the clandestine
coup, the dirty covert opera

tions and the "destabiliza
tions."
However, the Iranian ex
perience points towards a ring
ing failure. The "opportunity
cost" of supporting ephemeral
dictators should be replaced
by a more open and equivocal
approach to foreign countries.
The old, racist gunboat dip
lomacy is not only outdated, it
is ineffective and counter
productive. Metternich died
over a century ago.

Most of what is happening in
Iran today is certainly not un
expected. Following the long,
suppressive and unresponsive
reign of Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi the current explosion
should have been anticipated.
What makes the crisis extraor
dinary is the magnitude of the
internal belligerence and the
international importance of
Iran. It also offers ample evi
dence that the U.S. foreign pol
icy is bankrupt.
The norms of interpretation
of both U.S. political analysts
and policy makers preclude
several important variables.
The world has changed. The
Cold War principle of spheres
of influence, a notion that con
siders the world largely as an
exploitable realm, inhabited by
weak-willed beings, should
have been abandoned long
ago. Yet, former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger only last
week talked of a world at
"rough parity" with the Soviet
Union.
The idea that the United
States, through the CIA (as it
has been openly admitted in
the case of the shah) could in
stall a ruler, guardian of U.S.
interests, is not of course li
mited to Iran. This method, a
remnant of old, pre-American
imperialistic practices has
been in wide use since % World
War 11.
In vain, a few enlightened
Americans and foreigners have
warned of the pitfalls of this
practice. It does not take a
great political scientist to see
that support of repressive re
gimes could backfire; that a
large share of America's cur
rent worldwide woes derives
from its own foreign policy ac
tions.
Two elements of the ongo
ing analyses of the Iranian
crisis are subtle but indicative
proofs that lessons are yet to
be learned.
— A major criticism of the
intelligence agencies is that

they did not "predict" the
shah's trouble. A news media
account blamed this on the
ClA's dependence on the Sav
vak, Iran's secret police, for in
formation. The analysts, in
other words, are irked that the
CIA did not forewarn us so that
early appropriate action could
be taken. They rarely mention
the ClA's involvement in the
installation of the shah and his
subsequent autocratic rule.
— An all-out effort has been
undertaken to unearth the
Soviet involvement. Following
months of blaming the "fanatic
Moslems" the next culprits
would naturally be the com
munist provocateurs, oiled by
the Soviets. Terms such as "Is
lamic Marxists" have been
coined and drew international
sarcasm. Although the Soviets
would have an interest in the
erosion of U.S. influence in the
area, their involvement has
been minimal.
Truth is that the U.S. policy
makers' thinking is grossly in
adequate because it omits the
will of the people of many
countries. It is not empty re
volutionary rhetoric to make
references to the people. It
should not be surprising that
the people of any country
would eventually revolt against
