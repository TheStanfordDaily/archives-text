# The

## Minority issues of the post-Bakke Era 
### 
On this date, the 50th an
niversary of the birth of the
slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., it is imperative
that we attempt to reassess the
state of the black community
here. It is particularly impor
tant that this reassessment
occur in this, the post-Bakke
Era. For despite repeated as
surances by the University ad
ministration that the Bakke de
cision would have no negative
impact on the minority com
munities here, an examination
of the deteriorating position of
blacks in several areas seems to
indicate that the limited gains
made by minorities during the
late '60s are gradually being
eroded.
The Stanford Black Caucus
has undertaken the responsi
bility of critically examining the
status of blacks at Stanford.
The caucus is comprised of
students, faculty and staff who
have met voluntarily over the
past three years to discuss and
act on issues affecting the
black community here.
Over the past year, we have

been particularly concerned
with three issues:
— the implications of the
change in the Medical School's
admissions policy;
— the problems encoun
tered by black employees —
particularly the black
employees in the Personnel
Office; and
— the overly cautious and
almost obstructionist interpre
tation of the Bakke decision
taken by the University legal
counsel in regard to a grant
proposal for fellowships for
minority graduate students.
As the change in the Medical
School's admissions policy has
been fairly widely publicized,
we would like to take this op
portunity to expose two
equally critical issues to the
community at large.
Within the last three
months, three senior black
employees in the Personnel
Office have either been fired
or have resigned. In addition,
there have been two com
plaints filed with the state's Fair
Employment Practices Com

mission (FEPC). Whether these
employees left voluntarily or
involuntarily, this is a sizable
loss, considering the small
number of black senior
employees working in the of
fice.
We do not hold these events
to be unrelated to major
changes within the Personnel
Office's top management over
the last year. Nor do we hold
these events to be unrelated to
revisions in the University's
grievance procedures. The
opinion that has been voiced
by many of the black
employees leaving or when fil
ing complaints with the FEPC,
is that they could not expect a
grievance to be heard and
acted upon fairly by the Uni
versity.
We believe the first expres
sion of an institution's com
mitment to any employment
policy or practice, be it affirma
tive action or others, should be
reflected in that institution's
own personnel office. If the
University's commitment to af
firmative action is to fail within

the Personnel Office, then it
will be only a matter of time
before the few remaining black
employees throughout the
University will disappear.
While the future of black
employees appears question
able, the future of black stu
dents is no less grave a situa
tion. We are extremely con
cerned about the annual de
cline in the number of black
graduate students here. We
are even more concerned that
the University legal counsel's
recent interpretation of the
Bakke decision threatens po
tential funding for future
minority graduate students,
and indeed threatens the fu
ture of any affirmative action
program here.
The Sloan Foundation would
like to donate funding for
minority graduate students in
engineering. We would like to
express our full support for the
School of Engineering's efforts
to secure funds to increase the
number of minority engineers
in America. It would seem that
if one had a donor willing to

provide funding for minority
students, and a school willing
to increase the number of
minority students, that this was
a marriage made in heaven,
and important evidence of the
University's continuing com
mitment to the education of
minorities.
To date, the School of En
gineering has been unable to
devise wording for a proposal
to receive the funding that is
acceptable to the University's
Legal Office, which must ap
prove all contracts entered into
by the University.
The legal counsel has appa
rently interpreted the Bakke
decision to mean that the Uni
versity can accept no monies
earmarked for minority stu
dents. They have implied in
another case that a federal
program to increase minority
students in fields in which they
have been underrepresented
is also illegal under the Bakke
decision.
At best, the University legal
staff has taken an overly con
servative interpretation of the
Bakke decision; at worst, they
have assumed an obstruc
tionist position of blocking any
programs that have a racial
tinge and may possibly be
questioned in court. We be
lieve that it is in the best in
terests of the University to
have a legal staff that is actively,
creatively attempting to devise
legal solutions which would en
sure the continued representa
tion of minority students at the
University.
The legal staff's position has
severe implications for the fu
ture of minority graduate stu
dents and for the future of
minorities as well. It is difficult
to see the difference between
the Engineering School's
proposal and the present
Humanities and Sciences'
program of supplementing
departments for the scholar
ships given minority students.
It is difficult to see the differ
ence between the legality of
the Provost's Opportunity
Fund for the hiring of outstand
ing minority and women fa
culty and the legality of the
Sloan Foundation proposal. It
seems clear that every program
designated for minorities or
designed to increase the
number of minorities is
threatened by the University
legal staff's position.
On many fronts, the con
tinuance of a black (and other
minority) presence on campus
appears to be threatened. It
appears that there is a need for
a clear statement from the top
levels of the administration of
Stanford's continuing com
mitment to maintain and im
prove the position of
minorities at this University.
The Black Caucus is eager to
see if the administration will
provide the leadership and
guidance necessary to resolve
problems in this post-
Bakke Era.
