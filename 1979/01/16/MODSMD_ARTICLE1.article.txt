# Hospital allegations heard by committee
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Sacramento — The president of
a local doctor's union told a state as
sembly committee yesterday that
both the University and a state con
sumers group have "wantonly dis
obeyed" a section of the Business
and Professions Code.
Dr. Robert Weinmann, a doctor
here and president of the Union of
American Physicians Local 7402, told
the Health Committee in Sacramento
that the Board of Medical Quality As
surance (BMQA) and the University
have "disregarded" Section 2008
which states that medical schools
may make "no charge for profes
sional services rendered to pa
tients."
BMQA, a division of the state de
partment of consumer affairs, super
vises the practice of medicine in
California. Weinmann claimed this
agency has violated the code be
cause it has been "negligent or
worse" in not stopping the Universi
ty's billing practices.
BMQA recently turned over results
of its year-long investigation of the
University to the state Attorney Gen
eral's office for possible legal action,
a BMQA official said last week.
Although the results of this inves
tigation have not been released, the
acting dean of the Medical School,
Dr. Lawrence Crowley, told the
committee that the University is not
in violation because physicians, not
the medical school, charge fees to
patients.
Decision to charge
He added that the decision to
charge is "solely within the discre
tion of the faculty member."
But Weinmann disagreed.
Weinmann claimed that physicians
do not have that choice and told
legislators that in at least one case a
faculty physician had stated on the
patient's record, "please do not
charge for this visit.
Patient billed
"But the patient was billed
nevertheless and has now been
turned over to a collection agency by
Stanford for failure to pay the bill,"
Weinmann said.
The patient plans to take the mat
ter to small claims court, Weinmann
said.
Crowley told the committee he
was unfamiliar with that case.
"The fact is that a great deal of
pressure is put on faculty doctors to
charge, to send bills, and to earn as
much money for Stanford as they can

possibly generate," Weinmann told
the committee.
Accountability
He suggested that legislators not
introduce the proposed changes for
Section 2008 but instead demand that
medical schools be held accountable
for all fees charged to patients.
The proposed change in the code
would make the University's billing
procedures unquestionably legal
because it specifically permits faculty
physicians to charge patients.
Assemblyman Gordon Duffy (R-
Hanford), author of the proposed
change, Preprint Assembly Bill 19,
said he has changed his mind on the
bill's effectiveness.
Issue not resolved
"After hearing testimony today, I
don't think that Preprint 19 resolves
this major financial and medical is
sue," he said.
"What we are doing is trying to
determine the proper public policy
in financing a medical education,"
he said.
Dr. Eugene Dong at the Medical
Center also testified against the in
troduction of Preprint 19.
No action was taken today. Any
further legislative action must come
from a committee member who
would introduce the bill on the as
sembly floor.
The committee also heard tes
timony from state Health Services Di
rector Beverlee Myers, who said uni
versity hospitals are charging Medi-
Cal for more than the cost of treating
the poor and may be double-billing
in violation of state law.
"Medi-Cal overpayments may go
for medical education, faculty
bonuses, or into a medical school or
university general fund," Myers said.
The problem, legislators were
told, is that university-affiliated hos
pitals have found ways of including
the cost of teaching in bills to Medi-
Cal and private patients.
UC schools
It was previously believed that
University of California medical
schools were not in violation of Sec
tion 2008 because they are governed
by the state constitution which over
rides Business and Professions
Code.
However, a legislative counsel has
told a legislative consultant that he
believes the UC schools are in viola
tion.
A University of California rep
resentative who was at the commit
tee hearing said he knew nothing of
the counsel's recent decision.

nevertheless and has now been
turned over to a collection agency by
Stanford for failure to pay the bill,"
Weinmann said.
The patient plans to take the mat
ter to small claims court, Weinmann
said.
Crowley told the committee he
was unfamiliar with that case.
"The fact is that a great deal of
pressure is put on faculty doctors to
charge, to send bills, and to earn as
much money for Stanford as they can

possibly generate," Weinmann told
the committee.
Accountability
He suggested that legislators not
introduce the proposed changes for
Section 2008 but instead demand that
medical schools be held accountable
for all fees charged to patients.
The proposed change in the code
would make the University's billing
procedures unquestionably legal
because it specifically permits faculty
physicians to charge patients.
Assemblyman Gordon Duffy (R-
Hanford), author of the proposed
change, Preprint Assembly Bill 19,
said he has changed his mind on the
bill's effectiveness.
Issue not resolved
"After hearing testimony today, I
don't think that Preprint 19 resolves
this major financial and medical is
sue," he said.
"What we are doing is trying to
determine the proper public policy
in financing a medical education,"
he said.
Dr. Eugene Dong at the Medical
Center also testified against the in
troduction of Preprint 19.
No action was taken today. Any
further legislative action must come
from a committee member who
would introduce the bill on the as
sembly floor.
The committee also heard tes
timony from state Health Services Di
rector Beverlee Myers, who said uni
versity hospitals are charging Medi-
Cal for more than the cost of treating
the poor and may be double-billing
in violation of state law.
"Medi-Cal overpayments may go
for medical education, faculty
bonuses, or into a medical school or
university general fund," Myers said.
The problem, legislators were
told, is that university-affiliated hos
pitals have found ways of including
the cost of teaching in bills to Medi-
Cal and private patients.
UC schools
It was previously believed that
University of California medical
schools were not in violation of Sec
tion 2008 because they are governed
by the state constitution which over
rides Business and Professions
Code.
However, a legislative counsel has
told a legislative consultant that he
believes the UC schools are in viola
tion.
A University of California rep
resentative who was at the commit
tee hearing said he knew nothing of
the counsel's recent decision.
Sacramento — The president of
a local doctor's union told a state as
sembly committee yesterday that
both the University and a state con
sumers group have "wantonly dis
obeyed" a section of the Business
and Professions Code.
Dr. Robert Weinmann, a doctor
here and president of the Union of
American Physicians Local 7402, told
the Health Committee in Sacramento
that the Board of Medical Quality As
surance (BMQA) and the University
have "disregarded" Section 2008
which states that medical schools
may make "no charge for profes
sional services rendered to pa
tients."
BMQA, a division of the state de
partment of consumer affairs, super
vises the practice of medicine in
California. Weinmann claimed this
agency has violated the code be
cause it has been "negligent or
worse" in not stopping the Universi
ty's billing practices.
BMQA recently turned over results
of its year-long investigation of the
University to the state Attorney Gen
eral's office for possible legal action,
a BMQA official said last week.
Although the results of this inves
tigation have not been released, the
acting dean of the Medical School,
Dr. Lawrence Crowley, told the
committee that the University is not
in violation because physicians, not
the medical school, charge fees to
patients.
Decision to charge
He added that the decision to
charge is "solely within the discre
tion of the faculty member."
But Weinmann disagreed.
Weinmann claimed that physicians
do not have that choice and told
legislators that in at least one case a
faculty physician had stated on the
patient's record, "please do not
charge for this visit.
Patient billed
"But the patient was billed
nevertheless and has now been
turned over to a collection agency by
Stanford for failure to pay the bill,"
Weinmann said.
The patient plans to take the mat
ter to small claims court, Weinmann
said.
Crowley told the committee he
was unfamiliar with that case.
"The fact is that a great deal of
pressure is put on faculty doctors to
charge, to send bills, and to earn as
