# THE
						STAN FORD DAILY OPINIONS
## David Le Vine Historical facts overlooked 
### 
In his column "Root issue in
Mideast," (Daily, Jan. 10),
David Miller presented his sol
ution for peace in the Middle
East. Based on the idea that
peace can only result from
both the Arabs and the Jews
abandoning the idea of an
ethnic state, Miller proposes
four points which he deems
necessary for a lasting peace:
1. Israeli return of all "stolen
property and land to its rightful
Arab owners," 2. Extension of
civil liberties to all inhabitants
of Israel, 3. Abolishment of
judaically based laws, and 4.
Replacement of "Jewish" na
tional symbolism.
In each of these premises,
Miller has overlooked histori
cal facts which refute them as
solutions. While I can accept
that peace might result from a
non-ethnic state, I do not see
how he can demand that the
United States abstain from the
problem until Israel has made
the aforementioned changes,
especially when the very faults
he cites are mirrorred in the
U.S. and it does not appear
likely that the citizenry of the
U.S. is about to make similar
changes.
First, all of the territory oc
cupied by modern Israel was
obtained in one of three ways:
purchase, mandate or war. In
the 1880's, during the height of
the pogroms in Russia, many
Jews fled to Palestine, which
was under British control. Dur
ing the next 30 years, promo
tion by Zionist ideology led
many of the Jews who had
moved to Palestine from all
over the world to purchase
large tracts of unarable land
from its Arab owners at unmar
ketably high prices.

The basic structure of the
State of Israel was provided
when Great Britain mandated
its existence in 1948. All other
Israeli occupied territory was
conquered through war. Con
cerning this conquered land,
did the U.S. steal the 13 col
onies from Great Britain in 1776
and should not we have re
turned our land to Britain when
the war had ended in 1783?
Indeed, who is to say who
owns land or anything else.
Not one inch of modern Israel
is "stolen property," so there is
no stolen property to return
and there are no "rightful Arab
owners" to whom the property
should be returned.
Miller has also denied the
fact that over one-third of the
population of Israel is not
Jewish, yet all of these people
have full citizenship and are
protected under the law. The
Palestinian refugees deny Is
raeli government and they
therefore deny themselves citi
zenship. Does the U.S. extend
full citizenship to its own illegal
aliens?
Thirdly, by calling for the
abolishment of judaically
based laws, Miller also de
mands that such religious
"Blue Laws" be abolished in
the U.S. (i.e., the sale of liquor
should not be prohibited on
Sundays), and our own immig
ration laws should be
abolished. In either case, Israel
or the U.S., these demands are
unreasonable because the
majority of the population in
each republic prefers the laws
as they presently exist.
Finally, there is no need for
the replacement of Jewish
symbolism as national sym
bolism. The name "Israel" is
historically applicable to the

territory as is the flag. Keep in
mind that the U.S. kept the
same basic colors as England
after the Revolutionary War. As
for a language, just as English
was the major language spo
ken in the Confederation of
States in the 1780's, so was and
is Hebrew me majority lan
guage in the territory of Israel.
Bear in mind that Hebrew mis
sed becoming the national lan
guage of the Confederation by
one vote!
Again, I ask, how can Miller
call for U.S. abstention from an
unreformed Israel when the
U.S. itself has not im
plemented these reforms?
Further, Miller states that "if
the disestablishment of the
Jewish State is an impractical
dream, it must be replied that
then a stable and lasting peace
in the Mideast is an impractical
dream." I point out to Miller
that a century ago, both the es
tablishment of the State of Is
rael and landing a man on the
moon were each impractical
dreams, yet, each has come to
pass. Therefore, Miller's logic
is invalid: The disestablish
ment of the State of Israel does
not lead to permanent peace.
Finally, as both a Jew and a
student, I am appalled not so
much by Miller's "anti
semitic" (Arabs are also Se
mites because Arabic, like
Hebrew, is a Semitic language)
overtones as I am by the fact
that a graduate student at Stan
ford could make an argument
with such faulty historical re
search. Miller should learn to
do research, and he should
learn his history for life and not
just for tests!
