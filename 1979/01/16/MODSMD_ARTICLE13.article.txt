## Gathering spot needed 
### 
Before Stanford whisks away
15 students to the Little Eleven
conference to assess our
school's strengths and weak
nesses, I'd like to point out
what will undoubtedly prove to
be one of our school's most sa
lient omissions. We simply do
not have a socially oriented
student cafeteria.
Through college touring and
visiting of friends over the last
three years, I have had the
chance to see many colleges.
On almost every campus, there
was one central gathering spot
where student social interests
and fast food addictions inter
sected. At Williams College,
this social hub is called the
"Log." At Duke University, it
is affectionately called the
"Pits." Stanford has its own
plethora of names, but to date
we have what I will unaffec
tionately call a void.
Understand that it is not a
relief from Food Service
maladies that is sought.
Thrice-a-day dorm servings of
USDATopSirloin would not al
leviate the problem. Instead,
we need an on-campus home
for so many natural campus
events: the late-night study
breaks, the "after-the-game"
retreats, the b.s. sessions that
can only take place amidst

grease and junk food.
Ah, but we have the Cof
feehouse, right? Yes, we do
. . . there's no doubt about
that. But where are the ham
burgers, the french fries, the
large Cokes with ice? Most im
portantly, where are the stu
dents? One walk into the Cof
feehouse will dispel any no
tions that it is a "student"
center. A rest stop for Santa
Cruz nomads? A haven for
chess players? A murky bar in

One walk into the Coffeehouse will dispel
any notion that it is a "student" center. A
rest stop for Santa Cruz nomads? . ... A
murky bar in which one can play-act
high-level meetings? Maybe. But not a
student center.

which one can play-act high
level meetings? Maybe. Butnof
a student center.
Our other food centers —
the Transition, the Commons
(now the "Station"), and as
sorted departmental food
shops — all miss the main mark
entirely. For a start, none are
open at night. Secondly, only

the Transition provides the
space, center-of-campus loca
tion and hot food that is
needed.
Stanford's present void is
that much more acute because
of the suburban, dichotomous
nature of the campus. Our
Farm has no town bar or burger
joint to call its own (as Harvard
might find in Boston), thus
making our escapes car-limited
and difficult. Additionally,
Stanford's former sex segrega-

tion in housing leaves our
campus sorely spread out and
effectively stymied by the
White Plaza expanse between
dorm complexes.
The problem is severe; the
solution is rather simple. Ob
serving that Tresidder was built
as a student center, that a
cafeteria uniting the campus at
White Plaza would be benefi
cial, and that an overwhelming
need for such a center exists,
one must look to the Cof
feehouse and the Transition
for the answers.
The Coffeehouse does have
its place at Stanford. In true
school tradition, it has an air of
intellectual non-comformity.
However, its presence should
be in addition to, not in place
of, a student social center. As a
small neighbor to a student
cafeteria, it could become a
flexible entertainment center
and a welcome change-of
pace.
The Transition, however, is
nothing short of abominable
and needs a total rehaul. It al
ready possesses the ovens, the
location, and the abundant
space necessary for a campus
social center. Given an atmos
phere, late hours and a mini
mal hot food menu, it would
quickly turn into a student
mecca. In time, the student
cafeteria might even provide,
campus-wide, what residential
education hopes for in each
dorm. It certainly would pro
vide what campus-wide stu
dents hope for -- and are de
nied — in their university.

nature of the campus. Our
Farm has no town bar or burger
joint to call its own (as Harvard
might find in Boston), thus

Stanford's former sex segrega-

effectively stymied by the
White Plaza expanse between
dorm complexes.
The problem is severe; the
solution is rather simple. Ob
serving that Tresidder was built
as a student center, that a
cafeteria uniting the campus at
White Plaza would be benefi
cial, and that an overwhelming
need for such a center exists,
one must look to the Cof
feehouse and the Transition
for the answers.
The Coffeehouse does have
its place at Stanford. In true
school tradition, it has an air of
intellectual non-comformity.
However, its presence should
be in addition to, not in place
of, a student social center. As a
small neighbor to a student
cafeteria, it could become a
flexible entertainment center
and a welcome change-of
pace.
The Transition, however, is
nothing short of abominable
and needs a total rehaul. It al
ready possesses the ovens, the
location, and the abundant
space necessary for a campus
social center. Given an atmos
phere, late hours and a mini
mal hot food menu, it would
quickly turn into a student
mecca. In time, the student
cafeteria might even provide,
campus-wide, what residential
education hopes for in each
dorm. It certainly would pro
vide what campus-wide stu
dents hope for -- and are de
nied — in their university.

Before Stanford whisks away
15 students to the Little Eleven
conference to assess our
school's strengths and weak
nesses, I'd like to point out
what will undoubtedly prove to
be one of our school's most sa
lient omissions. We simply do
not have a socially oriented
student cafeteria.
Through college touring and
visiting of friends over the last
three years, I have had the
chance to see many colleges.
On almost every campus, there
was one central gathering spot
where student social interests
and fast food addictions inter
sected. At Williams College,
this social hub is called the
"Log." At Duke University, it
is affectionately called the
"Pits." Stanford has its own
plethora of names, but to date
we have what I will unaffec
tionately call a void.
Understand that it is not a
relief from Food Service
maladies that is sought.
Thrice-a-day dorm servings of
USDATopSirloin would not al
leviate the problem. Instead,
we need an on-campus home
for so many natural campus
events: the late-night study
breaks, the "after-the-game"
retreats, the b.s. sessions that
can only take place amidst

grease and junk food.
Ah, but we have the Cof
feehouse, right? Yes, we do
. . . there's no doubt about
that. But where are the ham
burgers, the french fries, the
large Cokes with ice? Most im
portantly, where are the stu
dents? One walk into the Cof
feehouse will dispel any no
tions that it is a "student"
center. A rest stop for Santa
Cruz nomads? A haven for
chess players? A murky bar in

which one can play-act high
level meetings? Maybe. Butnof
a student center.
Our other food centers —
the Transition, the Commons
(now the "Station"), and as
sorted departmental food
shops — all miss the main mark
entirely. For a start, none are
open at night. Secondly, only

the Transition provides the
space, center-of-campus loca
tion and hot food that is
needed.
Stanford's present void is
that much more acute because
of the suburban, dichotomous
nature of the campus. Our
Farm has no town bar or burger
joint to call its own (as Harvard
might find in Boston), thus
making our escapes car-limited
and difficult. Additionally,
Stanford's former sex segrega-
