## Disillusion plagues teachers 
### 
Twenty-five years ago, in the days prior
to teacher militancy, strikes, and Proposi
tion 13, the public viewed teaching as a
thankless but honorable profession. The
stereotyped schoolteacher was hard work
ing, docile and underpaid, a bit inept
perhaps but dedicated despite adversity to
improving the lives of young people. In
short, she was part schnook and part saint.
While certainly exaggerated, this view
was not without foundation. In the ab
sence of even the threat of teacher collec
tive action, school boards were free to
draw contracts with little regard for the
needs and desires of their employees.
Salaries were low, security lacking and
teachers were often treated unfairly by
their superiors. Not surprisingly, they had
to be satisfied with whatever intrinsic re
wards their profession could offer.
Today, a generation of collective bar
gaining has done much to correct this situ
ation. Teachers now enjoy reasonable job
security, adequate compensation and, for
the most part, freedom from unreasona
ble treatment by administrators and
school boards. In terms of material re
wards, the teaching profession is in a bet
ter position than pver before to compete
for new talent.
At the same time, these changes and the
events which created them have also
ushered in a new public attitude towards
teachers. Many now consider teaching an
easy job, filled by people who think first of
theirample paychecks and second of their
more than ample vacations.
Like its predecessor, today's stereotype,
while exaggerated, also has a factual base.

Studies of teacher union activity, for
example, have shown that despite union
claims of concern for the quality of educa
tion, almost all organizational resources
are devoted to a quest for higher salaries
and better benefits. If teachers are dedi
cated, their unions do not reflect their
feelings.
Equally disturbing are the results of sev
eral recent studies of teacher absen
teeism. One particularly thorough but typ
ical report prepared for the New Jersey
State Board of Education indicates that
teachers are three to four times as likely to
be absent from their jobs as industrial
workers and about six times as likely .as
managers. With few exceptions, at least
four percent of teachers are absent from
school each day. On peak absence days —
such as the first warm days of spring — as
many as 11 percent of all teachers stay out.
By contrast, there are two days each
month when there is almost no absen
teeism: paydays.
Studies such as these do much to bolster
the view that dedicated teachers are
largely a relic of the past. Yet, as a person
who has worked with teachers for the past
eight years, I know that this conclusion is
much too simple.
In particular, my observations of stu
dent teachers and first year teachers have
convinced me that most people who enter
the profession have a strong desire to have
lasting positive impact on young people.
Almost without exception, they believe
that their greatest rewards will come from
their relationships with students. If I'd
wanted to make a lot of money, they say,
I'd have gone into industry. And they
mean it.

However, within a few years these dedi
cated novices find that much of what they
had hoped and believed about their jobs
was erroneous. They find their training
largely irrelevant. They find opportunities
for meaningful collegial contact almost
nonexistent and administrative support
similarly lacking. They find parents un
cooperative and the community unsym
pathetic. Most devastating, they find stu
dents indifferent and often hostile to their
efforts. In sum, they find that teaching is a
very hard job which makes greater emo
tional demands and offers fewer emo
tional rewards than they ever imagined.
One of the greatest problems facing
public education today is that too few
teachers are able to meet this challenge.
Many leave teaching after a year or two. Of
those who stay, the majority are over
whelmed by the petty demands of daily
existence. In order to survive they detach
their emotions from their jobs. They ac
cept the only rewards that are readily av
ailable — higher salaries and better be
nefits. Their dedication does not disap
pear but it becomes mired in a swamp of
disillusionment.
If the public perceives with some accu
racy that teacher dedication has waned, it
behooves everyone connected with edu
cation to ask why this is so. Perhaps more
than any other, the profession of teaching
requires people who care about what they
do and those for whom they work.
Somehow, something must be done to
drain the swamp.
