Your article "Multimillion
dollar Hospital expansion con
sidered" (Daily, Jan. 4), may
leave readers with some inac
curate impressions of future
planning at Stanford University
Hospital.
The Hospital does have sig
nificant space problems, but
the inference that we are con
sidering the construction of a
totally new hospital is inaccu
rate, and was not stated or im
plied in my conversation with
the Daily reporter.
The Hospital is presently de
veloping an approach to meet
ing present and future facility
needs. A professional architec
tural firm is assisting us in this
planning effort. We anticipate
some remodeling of the pre
sent Hospital, completion of
"shell space" in the Hospital
addition opened last year, and
possibly the construction of
new space.
The costs of these efforts will
besubstantial butareyet unde
termined. No plans have yet
been formulated or submitted
for consideration to the Uni
versity administration and the
Board of Trustees.
Several specific errors
should be pointed out:
— The Daily states that the
Neonatal Nursery "is not being
enlarged." The Neonatal Nur
sery will be enlarged, with con
struction beginning this year.
The expansion is made possi
ble by remodeling the existing
unit and some area around it.
— The Daily is correct in stat
ing that the Hospital is "seeing
more seriously ill patients who
stay longer." But it does not
follow that this "is forcing the
Hospital to cut back on the
total number of patients admit
ted." The Hospital has not re
stricted the number of admis
sions, nor does it have any
plans to do so in the future.
— Regarding the matter of
compliance with Title 22 forthe
Neonatal Nursery, University
architects did not "guess" re
garding square footage re
quirements. The plans were
done by an outside architec

tural firm which has built other
intensive care nurseries in
California according to the
standard of an average of 80
square feet per bassinet. The
point is that with less than clear
standards, construction efforts
are subject to interpretation on
a project-by-project basis.
— The number of births at
Stanford has not "gone down
because we are admitting high
risk mothers who stay longer
than mothers with no compli
cations." Stanford Hospital has
not reduced the number of
births because of the de
velopment of the high-risk
mothers program. Over the
last five years, the number of
babies born at Stanford Hospi
tal has steadily increased.
The Hospital desires to keep
you and your readers informed
about current and future plans.
However, it is important that
the information conveyed be
accurate so that our plans or
intentions aren't misinter
preted.

Editor's note: The Daily stands
corrected on the "specific er
rors" mentioned by Mecklen
burg. However, it is the Daily's
belief the story did not imply a
completely new Hospital
would be built, but that the
strong possibility exists that a
multi-million dollar expansion
of the present Hospital will
take place, including the addi
tion of new buildings.
Foxes guard the
chickens
Kudos to the Daily and
Andrea James for persistent
and conscientious coverage of
the complicated "double bil
ling" allegations that the Union
of American Physicians Local
7402 has made against Stan
ford. Your follow-ups have
often been informative to the
principals.
The UAP does not, however,
object to Robert Rowland,
executive director of the Board
of Medical Quality Assurance

(BMQA) because his father
once worked for the Univer
sity. UAP's objection is that
Robert Rowland's previous job
was business manager for the
Department of Internal
Medicine at Stanford. We
would say that he should be
among the investigated, not
among the investigators. Al
lowing Rowland to lead BMQA
in this investigation is like hir
ing foxes to guard chicken
coops.
Rowland also called my re
marks "irresponsible" when I
said that BMQA was in Stan
ford's hip-pocket. Rowland
pointed out that the current in
vestigation of Stanford by
BMQA is the first such investi
gation in the 20 years that the
University has utilized its cur
rent quaint billing strategems.
What Rowland does not say
is that BMQA tried to duck this
investigation. In summer 1977,
one BMQA divisional chief said
an investigation into alleged
double billing here would have
"no priority." It was not until
UAP Local 7402 unearthed
massive adverse documenta
tion against Stanford — and re
leased it to the combined
media, newspaper, television
and radio — that BMQA finally
reluctantly agreed to accept
the responsibility of an investi
gation. Of course, by that time
many of us were ready to un
dertake an investigation of
BMQA!

Compassion for the

David Hayes wrote a finely
reasoned treatise proving
abortion cannot be justified
(Daily, (an. 8). However, Hayes
merelyasserfs "that the fetus is
a full human person." He is
certainly entitled to his opinion
and therefore to his conclu
sion.
To illustrate my opinion, let
us ask if a woman's arm is a
"full human person." No more
than a corpse; for if it were se

vered it would lack the one es
sential of a full human person:
life. Apply this criterion to a
fetus or any other appendage
of a woman's body and the
semantic difficulties vanish.
The only distinction is that a
fetus has a chance to achieve
human status if nature, the
greatest abortionist of all,
should spare it.
Hayes and I are entitled to
our disparate moral views on
abortion, but do we have a
right to preach? For abortion is
none of our business, neither
Hayes', nor mine, nor any
man's. A woman's body has
ceased to be the property of
herfather until marriage, when
title passed to the husband.
No man can feel the pain of
an unwelcome pregnancy, nor
can he plumb the psychologi
cal hell if it results from rape or
incest. Calling abortion "im
moral" does not ease the
agony of the woman who must
make the decision. A little
compassion, please, for those
who do the suffering.

merelyasserfs "that the fetus is
a full human person." He is
certainly entitled to his opinion
and therefore to his conclu
sion.
To illustrate my opinion, let
us ask if a woman's arm is a
"full human person." No more
than a corpse; for if it were se

vered it would lack the one es
sential of a full human person:
life. Apply this criterion to a
fetus or any other appendage
of a woman's body and the
semantic difficulties vanish.
The only distinction is that a
fetus has a chance to achieve
human status if nature, the
greatest abortionist of all,
should spare it.
Hayes and I are entitled to
our disparate moral views on
abortion, but do we have a
right to preach? For abortion is
none of our business, neither
Hayes', nor mine, nor any
man's. A woman's body has
ceased to be the property of
herfather until marriage, when
title passed to the husband.
No man can feel the pain of
an unwelcome pregnancy, nor
can he plumb the psychologi
cal hell if it results from rape or
incest. Calling abortion "im
moral" does not ease the
agony of the woman who must
make the decision. A little
compassion, please, for those
who do the suffering.

Your article "Multimillion
dollar Hospital expansion con
sidered" (Daily, Jan. 4), may
leave readers with some inac
curate impressions of future
planning at Stanford University
Hospital.
The Hospital does have sig
nificant space problems, but
the inference that we are con
sidering the construction of a
totally new hospital is inaccu
rate, and was not stated or im
plied in my conversation with
the Daily reporter.
The Hospital is presently de
veloping an approach to meet
ing present and future facility
needs. A professional architec
tural firm is assisting us in this
planning effort. We anticipate
some remodeling of the pre
sent Hospital, completion of
"shell space" in the Hospital
addition opened last year, and
possibly the construction of
new space.
The costs of these efforts will
besubstantial butareyet unde
termined. No plans have yet
been formulated or submitted
for consideration to the Uni
versity administration and the
Board of Trustees.
Several specific errors
should be pointed out:
— The Daily states that the
Neonatal Nursery "is not being
enlarged." The Neonatal Nur
sery will be enlarged, with con
struction beginning this year.
The expansion is made possi
ble by remodeling the existing
unit and some area around it.
— The Daily is correct in stat
ing that the Hospital is "seeing
more seriously ill patients who
stay longer." But it does not
follow that this "is forcing the
Hospital to cut back on the
total number of patients admit
ted." The Hospital has not re
stricted the number of admis
sions, nor does it have any
plans to do so in the future.
— Regarding the matter of
compliance with Title 22 forthe
Neonatal Nursery, University
architects did not "guess" re
garding square footage re
quirements. The plans were
done by an outside architec

tural firm which has built other
intensive care nurseries in
California according to the
standard of an average of 80
square feet per bassinet. The
point is that with less than clear
standards, construction efforts
are subject to interpretation on
a project-by-project basis.
— The number of births at
Stanford has not "gone down
because we are admitting high
risk mothers who stay longer
than mothers with no compli
cations." Stanford Hospital has
not reduced the number of
births because of the de
velopment of the high-risk
mothers program. Over the
last five years, the number of
babies born at Stanford Hospi
tal has steadily increased.
The Hospital desires to keep
you and your readers informed
about current and future plans.
However, it is important that
the information conveyed be
accurate so that our plans or
intentions aren't misinter
preted.

Editor's note: The Daily stands
corrected on the "specific er
rors" mentioned by Mecklen
burg. However, it is the Daily's
belief the story did not imply a
completely new Hospital
would be built, but that the
strong possibility exists that a
multi-million dollar expansion
of the present Hospital will
take place, including the addi
tion of new buildings.
Foxes guard the

Kudos to the Daily and
Andrea James for persistent
and conscientious coverage of
the complicated "double bil
ling" allegations that the Union
of American Physicians Local
7402 has made against Stan
ford. Your follow-ups have
often been informative to the
principals.
The UAP does not, however,
object to Robert Rowland,
executive director of the Board
of Medical Quality Assurance

(BMQA) because his father
once worked for the Univer
sity. UAP's objection is that
Robert Rowland's previous job
was business manager for the
Department of Internal
Medicine at Stanford. We
would say that he should be
among the investigated, not
among the investigators. Al
lowing Rowland to lead BMQA
in this investigation is like hir
ing foxes to guard chicken
coops.
Rowland also called my re
marks "irresponsible" when I
said that BMQA was in Stan
ford's hip-pocket. Rowland
pointed out that the current in
vestigation of Stanford by
BMQA is the first such investi
gation in the 20 years that the
University has utilized its cur
rent quaint billing strategems.
What Rowland does not say
is that BMQA tried to duck this
investigation. In summer 1977,
one BMQA divisional chief said
an investigation into alleged
double billing here would have
"no priority." It was not until
UAP Local 7402 unearthed
massive adverse documenta
tion against Stanford — and re
leased it to the combined
media, newspaper, television
and radio — that BMQA finally
reluctantly agreed to accept
the responsibility of an investi
gation. Of course, by that time
many of us were ready to un
dertake an investigation of
BMQA!
