## ballet/lael stone San Francisco Ballet season opens with a disappointment 
### 
The San Francisco Ballet
opened its season this past
week with a program that
reminded one how wonder
ful it is to watch good dan
cers perform live, and how
disappointing it is to see
them in sometimes
mediocre and artistically
unfulfilled choreography.
The seven programs in
this year's season each run
for about a week in the city
at the War Memorial Opera
House with additional per
formances at Zellerbach
auditorium, Berkeley, the
Center for the Performing
Arts, San Jose, and Flint
Center, Cupertino, spread
ing the season into late May.
Five of these programs
contain world premiere per
formances of pieces by the
company's resident
choreographers. Program
one's world premiere,
Richmond Diary, provided
probably the biggest disap
pointment of the evening.
By the time I saw it, on

Saturday, Jan. 13, Tomm
Rudd, company dancer and
choreographer, revised his
work, shortening it by tight
ening it since the premiere
on Tuesday. Perhaps he
should have expanded the
piece though, as the love
story of a Confederate Gen
eral and his wife, ending in
the General's death, is
rather a lot to present in a
50-minute ballet.
If Rudd were to re-work
the choreography, and ex
pand it, he would be forced
to put in more dancing. The
only dancing in the piece at
the present are waltzes, and
variations on waltzes. Rudd
might be reminded that if
one is telling a story though
dance, one does so through
dance, not through walking
around the stage, using
cliched gestures from the
elbow down, or superflu
ous voiceovers.
After Richmond Diary, any
sort of movement, even
barre exercises, would have

pleased me, and my view of
the next piece, Quanta, was
consequently biased. This
piece, choreographed by
another company dancers
and choreographer, John
McFall, premiered in '78.
The title and the program
notes direct our attention to
"energy relationships and
energy levels based on the
various theories of quantum

physics." The movements
seemed more reminiscent
of waving cilia from biologi
cal studies. The music, Di
mitri Shostakovitch's String
Quartet No. 6, enhanced
the movement but provided
no further clue to title.
Apart from this discre
pancy, (Quanta is a pleasant
piece, well performed; al
though it sometimes

seemed a bit academic in its
paralellisms and symmet
ries.
The next piece, Diver
tissment d'Auber, which has
been in the company's re
petory since their 1959 tour
of the mid-East, provided an
excellent illustration of the
technical capabilities of
three of the company dan
cers. David McNaughton

showed off his smooth plie
and jump to great advan
tage. His two companions,
Diana Weber and Elizabeth
Tienke seemed to take a
while to warm up to the
movement, but when they
did they were sharp and
clean. Tienken seemed to
show signs of nervousness
in the back of her neck and
face as if she didn't quite be
lieve how good she was.
Almost pedantic
The last piece on the
program, Mozart's C Minor
Mass, suffered greatly from
the albeit necessary
economy measure of taping
the choir. Michael Smuin's
choreography sticks very
closely to the musical beat
of the music, almost to the
point of pedantry, but gen
erally fails to convey the
dance-qualities of the
music. (The music in fact
was banned by the Pope as
being too "dance-like" for
the late 1700s.)
Program one, minus

Richmond Diary, will be
performed in Berkeley, Jan.
23. Program two, which will
run at the Opera House )an.
16, 20, 21, and 28, with later
performances in April and
in San )ose on April 6, is
Michael Smuin's much
acclaimed production of
Romeo and Juliet, using
Prokofiev's score. Pre
miered in 1976, this ballet in
1978 was the first full-length
ballet to be performed for
PBS's "Dance-in-America"
series on Great Perfor
mances.
The third program, of
fered in San Francisco Jan.
30, Feb. 3, 4, and 6, pre
mieres SFB's ballet master's
new ballet, The Mistletoe
Bride. This ballet is de
scribed as a Gothic horror
story based on a 17th cen
tury legend, with an original
score by Paul Chihara
(Shinju). Also on the prog
ram are Con Amore,
Stravinsky Pas de Deux, and
Songs of Mahler.

"energy relationships and
energy levels based on the
various theories of quantum

physics." The movements
seemed more reminiscent
of waving cilia from biologi
cal studies. The music, Di
mitri Shostakovitch's String
Quartet No. 6, enhanced
the movement but provided
no further clue to title.
Apart from this discre
pancy, (Quanta is a pleasant
piece, well performed; al
though it sometimes

seemed a bit academic in its
paralellisms and symmet
ries.
The next piece, Diver
tissment d'Auber, which has
been in the company's re
petory since their 1959 tour
of the mid-East, provided an
excellent illustration of the
technical capabilities of
three of the company dan
cers. David McNaughton

showed off his smooth plie
and jump to great advan
tage. His two companions,
Diana Weber and Elizabeth
Tienke seemed to take a
while to warm up to the
movement, but when they
did they were sharp and
clean. Tienken seemed to
show signs of nervousness
in the back of her neck and
face as if she didn't quite be
lieve how good she was.
Almost pedantic
The last piece on the
program, Mozart's C Minor
Mass, suffered greatly from
the albeit necessary
economy measure of taping
the choir. Michael Smuin's
choreography sticks very
closely to the musical beat
of the music, almost to the
point of pedantry, but gen
erally fails to convey the
dance-qualities of the
music. (The music in fact
was banned by the Pope as
being too "dance-like" for
the late 1700s.)
Program one, minus

Richmond Diary, will be
performed in Berkeley, Jan.
23. Program two, which will
run at the Opera House )an.
16, 20, 21, and 28, with later
performances in April and
in San )ose on April 6, is
Michael Smuin's much
acclaimed production of
Romeo and Juliet, using
Prokofiev's score. Pre
miered in 1976, this ballet in
1978 was the first full-length
ballet to be performed for
PBS's "Dance-in-America"
series on Great Perfor
mances.
The third program, of
fered in San Francisco Jan.
30, Feb. 3, 4, and 6, pre
mieres SFB's ballet master's
new ballet, The Mistletoe
Bride. This ballet is de
scribed as a Gothic horror
story based on a 17th cen
tury legend, with an original
score by Paul Chihara
(Shinju). Also on the prog
ram are Con Amore,
Stravinsky Pas de Deux, and
Songs of Mahler.

The San Francisco Ballet
opened its season this past
week with a program that
reminded one how wonder
ful it is to watch good dan
cers perform live, and how
disappointing it is to see
them in sometimes
mediocre and artistically
unfulfilled choreography.
The seven programs in
this year's season each run
for about a week in the city
at the War Memorial Opera
House with additional per
formances at Zellerbach
auditorium, Berkeley, the
Center for the Performing
Arts, San Jose, and Flint
Center, Cupertino, spread
ing the season into late May.
Five of these programs
contain world premiere per
formances of pieces by the
company's resident
choreographers. Program
one's world premiere,
Richmond Diary, provided
probably the biggest disap
pointment of the evening.
By the time I saw it, on

Saturday, Jan. 13, Tomm
Rudd, company dancer and
choreographer, revised his
work, shortening it by tight
ening it since the premiere
on Tuesday. Perhaps he
should have expanded the
piece though, as the love
story of a Confederate Gen
eral and his wife, ending in
the General's death, is
rather a lot to present in a
50-minute ballet.
If Rudd were to re-work
the choreography, and ex
pand it, he would be forced
to put in more dancing. The
only dancing in the piece at
the present are waltzes, and
variations on waltzes. Rudd
might be reminded that if
one is telling a story though
dance, one does so through
dance, not through walking
around the stage, using
cliched gestures from the
elbow down, or superflu
ous voiceovers.
After Richmond Diary, any
sort of movement, even
barre exercises, would have

pleased me, and my view of
the next piece, Quanta, was
consequently biased. This
piece, choreographed by
another company dancers
and choreographer, John
McFall, premiered in '78.
The title and the program
notes direct our attention to
"energy relationships and
energy levels based on the
various theories of quantum

physics." The movements
seemed more reminiscent
of waving cilia from biologi
cal studies. The music, Di
