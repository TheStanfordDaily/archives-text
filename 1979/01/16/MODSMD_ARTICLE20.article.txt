## Winterland—The Feeling held on 
### 
"Winterland lasted a little
longer than the others be
cause we were a little . . .
(pause) . . . more mad than
the others."
-Bill Graham, 1978
Because it was always
there. The Feeling, I mean.
The Feeling was what the
place was all about. And
that's why they came, every
weekend, and stood
bunched against the build
ing, collars turned up
against a nasty city wind, as
if seeking warmth from a
mother they knew would
always hold them. They
knew The Feeling, and if
they stood bewildered
here, facing a strange and
unsure world, feet shuffling
on a slick, rain-spattered
sidewalk, they still knew
what they'd find inside.
And you knew it. Even as
you approached the place,
trudging through the
mean/dirty wind-splashed
streets of the sad and
wretched Fillmore district,
all manner of brothers and
sisters tugging at you, palms
heavenward in the eternal
plea for drugs and/or spare
change, even then you
could already feel it.
—you knew it as you fol
lowed the line past the same
rent-a-cop that stood right
there on the Post/Steiner
corner every show, under
the outdated vertical
movie-house marquee that
spelled W-l-N-T-E-R
-—A-N-D, 'cause even he
had The Feeling.
—you knew it when you
passed the cat across the
sidewalk, the guy slouched
against the trash bin, denim
jacket and greasy T-shirt
over a rotting, potted belly;
motor-grime junked jeans
to the tops of his $1.35 black
surplus lace-em-up army
boots. . . this cat with lesus
hair and beard framing a
lined and weathered, late
nights-and-daze face,
half-mast eyelids only par
tially obscuring the beggar's
savvy, the joker's wit, as he
called in a scratched, whis
key breath voice: "LSD,
man, there's two kinds: the
kind you take, and the kind
you listen to . . . ever hear
the Dead, man. . .?" And
you'd laugh because
you'd know: he had it too,
man. The Feeling.
—you knew it as you
neared the door; you could
begin to see sense it then
and your nose would twitch

and your body would begin
to shake, and you knew you
were home, past the door
and through the foyer, into
the lobby and suddenly
stroked by the smell of out
sized sugar donuts and
chocolate-chip cookies,
and you could hear the
sound . . . through the
archway, into the dark,
down the day-glo stripped
steps (no tripping here, at
least physically), onto the
painted red wooden floor,
and ZANG! —
—Baby, now you knew.
You knew why they came to
this hulking mother of a
barn, her mile-high ceiling
girdered and hung with
black lights makeyour teeth
look green, and red and
blue lights too; her bal
conies like great matriarchal
arms holding her children
out over the floor, where
hundreds more Believers
shook and danced and
grooved, 'cause nobody got
the feeling if they don't got
it.
And first came the Dark
ness, the signal, because
immediately after came the
Roar, five thousand throats
and hearts, visceral charged
screams urging "take me
with you, let me go, I get it
now, I got The Feeling."
And then the Voice, om
nipotent, kindly, spelling it
out and pushing it on, till
there's The Rising Flash! of
lights coming up, and the
first smashing CHIANG!; the
single chord chasing itself
off the stage and over across
their heads, burning a path
up the balconies and down
the walls till it meets its next
of kin, the two hissing like
hellbent alley cats, devil's
agents with fur raised on
end and claws bared. Then
you're off, and there's no
place to go but out. 'Cause
now everyone's got it.
And so, someone says,
what is this Feeling? Right? I
mean, what are you talking
about all this stuff, and you
don't say what you mean.
And you laugh, ha ha, and
you laugh and say, "so,
what, I describe it to you?
Yeah, and how? How do I
describe high school, and
friends, and crying at night
because you wanted the
goddamn car, and how do I
describe growing up, and
zits and my damn parents,
man, and how do I tell you
about all the shit that flies?
And then how do I make
you see the magazines, the

hair growing, countless
hours in record stores and
between headphones, dri
vin' with the radio on and
playing the guitar, and stay
ing up till four o'clock drin
kin' lack Daniels, the boil
ing vacuum and churning
capsule of adolescent emo
tion that constantly has to
get SPENT, friend? Do I de
scribe light and drugs and
noise and the fucking
rhythm man, that you can
stand on, tromp on, that
holds you up — boom
boom-boom, right there
making your heart beat and
your glands work, stroking
your skin till it sizzles all hot
and cold, and your hips start
to grind like a ce-ment
mixer, baby. . .?" All right
then, and so what's this
Feeling?
"ROCK AND ROLL!"
they'd shout, slashing their
guitars, kick-pounding the
drums, possessed. Our
STARS, man, these cats
couldp/ay, and damn if they
didn't have It too. And so
you'd jump and writhe,
push, shove and swim your
way to the front, to be with
the greats, man, and they all
played here: The Stones. The
Who. Cream, Jefferson
Airplane, the Dead. Muddy
Waters and 8.8. King.
Frampton, Foghat, )ohnny
and Edgar Winter, Yes,
Mayall, and Ten Years After,
Butterfield/Bishop/Bloom
field.
And every night was spe
cial, because everyone FELT
It there ever night. The
players — the ones who said
it at you, to you, for you.
Only they did what they did
the way they did it. And you
heard it, man — reaffirma
tion . . . you became the
primal thrust-push Beat; it
let you rock, sweet one, it
got you through the long
and lonely night. It was all
right.
And it was hers, this grand
dame of rock n' roll, who'd
gotten her start christened
"Dreamland" back in the
'20s, home to lectures,
sports events, horse shows,
and opera, mind you, and
who, re-named "Winter
land" in 1939, alternately
hosted boxing matches and
the Ice Follies throughout
the '40s and '50s.
'Cause then came the
'60s: beads, bells, hippies
and drugs, the San Fran
cisco sound and communal
living, Bill Graham and the

Fillmore West, and all of this
was sort of . . ~ way out
there in that weird little city
on the coast — And this big
bosomy madam saw her
rock 'n' roll heyday,
I'hotesse du fin de la
semaine, weekend witch for
the really Big acts of those
days, when 5000 was the
largest draw anywhere, and
if you can do that, baby, you
play the big W.
And on into the '70s,
when business realities and
social reactionaries took
their toll, and the 5000-
seater became financially
and artistically, uh . . . un
desirable, with acts toting
tons of sound and light
equipment around and one
of those 18,000 seat
monstrosities looming prac
tically right around the
corner.
And The Feeling, like an
ancient kerosene lamp,
dims, lacking fuel and fight
ingthe prevailing wind of an
audience need to be enter
tained rather than to par
take in the entertainment.
And the feeling, man, it
slows, hobbles along,
searching for even a tem
porary kiss of life even as it
suffocates under the pil
lowy cushion of personality,
ego, and hype-schiock,
until finally. . . .
—her doors are closed
now, and the bitter wind
sweeps her tattered skirts,
whistling a whispered cry,
"Why, momma, why?" And
she stands silent and proud,
dark bitten and beaten,
monument to no one and
nothing you can put your
goddamn finger on; she too
awaits her fate, eyebrows
arched haughty, sad and
wary, but daring, man just
daring you to tear at her or
hers for one second and
she'll. . . .
Arid you can always hear
the bum in the distance,
pierced by one dim cry, a
shout perhaps from
another, better time; while
she listens a moment, then
with a huge and breathy
sigh and the creak of old
joints re-settles her girth to
wait and see . . . and one
last time the wind curls and
scratches, rubs around her
corners, and finally twists
off into the blank and swirl
ing night nobody knows.
And she sleeps.

records by some very fam
ous people. And yes, he still
believes in Magic.)

you'd laugh because
you'd know: he had it too,
man. The Feeling.
—you knew it as you
neared the door; you could
begin to see sense it then
and your nose would twitch

and your body would begin
to shake, and you knew you
were home, past the door
and through the foyer, into
the lobby and suddenly
stroked by the smell of out
sized sugar donuts and
chocolate-chip cookies,
and you could hear the
sound . . . through the
archway, into the dark,
down the day-glo stripped
steps (no tripping here, at
least physically), onto the
painted red wooden floor,
and ZANG! —
—Baby, now you knew.
You knew why they came to
this hulking mother of a
barn, her mile-high ceiling
girdered and hung with
black lights makeyour teeth
look green, and red and
blue lights too; her bal
conies like great matriarchal
arms holding her children
out over the floor, where
hundreds more Believers
shook and danced and
grooved, 'cause nobody got
the feeling if they don't got
it.
And first came the Dark
ness, the signal, because
immediately after came the
Roar, five thousand throats
and hearts, visceral charged
screams urging "take me
with you, let me go, I get it
now, I got The Feeling."
And then the Voice, om
nipotent, kindly, spelling it
out and pushing it on, till
there's The Rising Flash! of
lights coming up, and the
first smashing CHIANG!; the
single chord chasing itself
off the stage and over across
their heads, burning a path
up the balconies and down
the walls till it meets its next
of kin, the two hissing like
hellbent alley cats, devil's
agents with fur raised on
end and claws bared. Then
you're off, and there's no
place to go but out. 'Cause
now everyone's got it.
And so, someone says,
what is this Feeling? Right? I
mean, what are you talking
about all this stuff, and you
don't say what you mean.
And you laugh, ha ha, and
you laugh and say, "so,
what, I describe it to you?
Yeah, and how? How do I
describe high school, and
friends, and crying at night
because you wanted the
goddamn car, and how do I
describe growing up, and
zits and my damn parents,
man, and how do I tell you
about all the shit that flies?
And then how do I make
you see the magazines, the

hair growing, countless
hours in record stores and
between headphones, dri
vin' with the radio on and
playing the guitar, and stay
ing up till four o'clock drin
kin' lack Daniels, the boil
ing vacuum and churning
capsule of adolescent emo
tion that constantly has to
get SPENT, friend? Do I de
scribe light and drugs and
noise and the fucking
rhythm man, that you can
stand on, tromp on, that
holds you up — boom
boom-boom, right there
making your heart beat and
your glands work, stroking
your skin till it sizzles all hot
and cold, and your hips start
to grind like a ce-ment
mixer, baby. . .?" All right
then, and so what's this
Feeling?
"ROCK AND ROLL!"
they'd shout, slashing their
guitars, kick-pounding the
drums, possessed. Our
STARS, man, these cats
couldp/ay, and damn if they
didn't have It too. And so
you'd jump and writhe,
push, shove and swim your
way to the front, to be with
the greats, man, and they all
played here: The Stones. The
Who. Cream, Jefferson
Airplane, the Dead. Muddy
Waters and 8.8. King.

field.
And every night was spe
cial, because everyone FELT
It there ever night. The
players — the ones who said
it at you, to you, for you.
Only they did what they did
the way they did it. And you
heard it, man — reaffirma
tion . . . you became the
primal thrust-push Beat; it
let you rock, sweet one, it
got you through the long
and lonely night. It was all
right.
And it was hers, this grand
dame of rock n' roll, who'd
gotten her start christened
"Dreamland" back in the
'20s, home to lectures,
sports events, horse shows,
and opera, mind you, and
who, re-named "Winter
land" in 1939, alternately
hosted boxing matches and
the Ice Follies throughout
the '40s and '50s.
'Cause then came the
'60s: beads, bells, hippies
and drugs, the San Fran
cisco sound and communal
living, Bill Graham and the

Fillmore West, and all of this
was sort of . . ~ way out
there in that weird little city
on the coast — And this big
bosomy madam saw her
rock 'n' roll heyday,
I'hotesse du fin de la
semaine, weekend witch for
the really Big acts of those
days, when 5000 was the
largest draw anywhere, and
if you can do that, baby, you
play the big W.
And on into the '70s,
when business realities and
social reactionaries took
their toll, and the 5000-
seater became financially
and artistically, uh . . . un
desirable, with acts toting
tons of sound and light
equipment around and one
of those 18,000 seat
monstrosities looming prac
tically right around the
corner.
And The Feeling, like an
ancient kerosene lamp,
dims, lacking fuel and fight
ingthe prevailing wind of an
audience need to be enter
tained rather than to par
take in the entertainment.
And the feeling, man, it
slows, hobbles along,
searching for even a tem
porary kiss of life even as it
suffocates under the pil
lowy cushion of personality,
ego, and hype-schiock,
until finally. . . .
—her doors are closed
now, and the bitter wind
sweeps her tattered skirts,
whistling a whispered cry,
"Why, momma, why?" And
she stands silent and proud,
dark bitten and beaten,
monument to no one and
nothing you can put your
goddamn finger on; she too
awaits her fate, eyebrows
arched haughty, sad and
wary, but daring, man just
daring you to tear at her or
hers for one second and
she'll. . . .
Arid you can always hear
the bum in the distance,
pierced by one dim cry, a
shout perhaps from
another, better time; while
she listens a moment, then
with a huge and breathy
sigh and the creak of old
joints re-settles her girth to
wait and see . . . and one
last time the wind curls and
scratches, rubs around her
corners, and finally twists
off into the blank and swirl
ing night nobody knows.
And she sleeps.

Because it was always
there. The Feeling, I mean.
The Feeling was what the
place was all about. And
that's why they came, every
weekend, and stood
bunched against the build
ing, collars turned up
against a nasty city wind, as
if seeking warmth from a
mother they knew would
always hold them. They
knew The Feeling, and if
they stood bewildered
here, facing a strange and
unsure world, feet shuffling
on a slick, rain-spattered
sidewalk, they still knew
what they'd find inside.
And you knew it. Even as
you approached the place,
trudging through the
mean/dirty wind-splashed
streets of the sad and
wretched Fillmore district,
all manner of brothers and
sisters tugging at you, palms
heavenward in the eternal
plea for drugs and/or spare
change, even then you
could already feel it.
—you knew it as you fol
lowed the line past the same
rent-a-cop that stood right
there on the Post/Steiner
corner every show, under
the outdated vertical
movie-house marquee that
spelled W-l-N-T-E-R
-—A-N-D, 'cause even he
had The Feeling.
—you knew it when you
passed the cat across the
sidewalk, the guy slouched
against the trash bin, denim
jacket and greasy T-shirt
over a rotting, potted belly;
motor-grime junked jeans
to the tops of his $1.35 black
surplus lace-em-up army
boots. . . this cat with lesus
hair and beard framing a
lined and weathered, late
nights-and-daze face,
half-mast eyelids only par
tially obscuring the beggar's
savvy, the joker's wit, as he
called in a scratched, whis
key breath voice: "LSD,
man, there's two kinds: the
kind you take, and the kind
you listen to . . . ever hear
the Dead, man. . .?" And
you'd laugh because
you'd know: he had it too,
man. The Feeling.

you laugh and say, "so,
what, I describe it to you?
Yeah, and how? How do I
describe high school, and
friends, and crying at night
because you wanted the
goddamn car, and how do I
describe growing up, and
zits and my damn parents,
man, and how do I tell you
about all the shit that flies?
And then how do I make
you see the magazines, the

hair growing, countless
hours in record stores and
between headphones, dri
vin' with the radio on and
playing the guitar, and stay
ing up till four o'clock drin
kin' lack Daniels, the boil
ing vacuum and churning
capsule of adolescent emo
tion that constantly has to
get SPENT, friend? Do I de
scribe light and drugs and
noise and the fucking
rhythm man, that you can
stand on, tromp on, that
holds you up — boom
boom-boom, right there
making your heart beat and
your glands work, stroking
your skin till it sizzles all hot
and cold, and your hips start
to grind like a ce-ment
mixer, baby. . .?" All right
then, and so what's this
Feeling?
"ROCK AND ROLL!"
they'd shout, slashing their
guitars, kick-pounding the
drums, possessed. Our
STARS, man, these cats
couldp/ay, and damn if they
didn't have It too. And so
you'd jump and writhe,
push, shove and swim your
way to the front, to be with
the greats, man, and they all
played here: The Stones. The
Who. Cream, Jefferson
Airplane, the Dead. Muddy
Waters and 8.8. King.

field.
And every night was spe
cial, because everyone FELT
It there ever night. The
players — the ones who said
it at you, to you, for you.
Only they did what they did
the way they did it. And you
heard it, man — reaffirma
tion . . . you became the
primal thrust-push Beat; it
let you rock, sweet one, it
got you through the long
and lonely night. It was all
right.
And it was hers, this grand
dame of rock n' roll, who'd
gotten her start christened
"Dreamland" back in the
'20s, home to lectures,
sports events, horse shows,
and opera, mind you, and
who, re-named "Winter
land" in 1939, alternately
hosted boxing matches and
the Ice Follies throughout
the '40s and '50s.
'Cause then came the
'60s: beads, bells, hippies
and drugs, the San Fran
cisco sound and communal
living, Bill Graham and the

Fillmore West, and all of this
was sort of . . ~ way out
there in that weird little city
on the coast — And this big
bosomy madam saw her
rock 'n' roll heyday,
I'hotesse du fin de la
semaine, weekend witch for
the really Big acts of those
days, when 5000 was the
largest draw anywhere, and
if you can do that, baby, you
play the big W.
And on into the '70s,
when business realities and
social reactionaries took
their toll, and the 5000-
seater became financially
and artistically, uh . . . un
desirable, with acts toting
tons of sound and light
equipment around and one
of those 18,000 seat
monstrosities looming prac
tically right around the
corner.
And The Feeling, like an
ancient kerosene lamp,
dims, lacking fuel and fight
ingthe prevailing wind of an
audience need to be enter
tained rather than to par
take in the entertainment.
And the feeling, man, it
slows, hobbles along,
searching for even a tem
porary kiss of life even as it
suffocates under the pil
lowy cushion of personality,
ego, and hype-schiock,
until finally. . . .
—her doors are closed
now, and the bitter wind
sweeps her tattered skirts,
whistling a whispered cry,
"Why, momma, why?" And
she stands silent and proud,
dark bitten and beaten,
monument to no one and
nothing you can put your
goddamn finger on; she too
awaits her fate, eyebrows
arched haughty, sad and
wary, but daring, man just
daring you to tear at her or
hers for one second and
she'll. . . .
Arid you can always hear
the bum in the distance,
pierced by one dim cry, a
shout perhaps from
another, better time; while
she listens a moment, then
with a huge and breathy
sigh and the creak of old
joints re-settles her girth to
wait and see . . . and one
last time the wind curls and
scratches, rubs around her
corners, and finally twists
off into the blank and swirl
ing night nobody knows.
And she sleeps.

Because it was always
there. The Feeling, I mean.
The Feeling was what the
place was all about. And
that's why they came, every
weekend, and stood
bunched against the build
ing, collars turned up
against a nasty city wind, as
if seeking warmth from a
mother they knew would
always hold them. They
knew The Feeling, and if
they stood bewildered
here, facing a strange and
unsure world, feet shuffling
on a slick, rain-spattered
sidewalk, they still knew
what they'd find inside.
And you knew it. Even as
you approached the place,
trudging through the
mean/dirty wind-splashed
streets of the sad and
wretched Fillmore district,
all manner of brothers and
sisters tugging at you, palms
heavenward in the eternal
plea for drugs and/or spare
change, even then you
could already feel it.
—you knew it as you fol
lowed the line past the same
rent-a-cop that stood right
there on the Post/Steiner
corner every show, under
the outdated vertical
movie-house marquee that
spelled W-l-N-T-E-R
-—A-N-D, 'cause even he
had The Feeling.
—you knew it when you
passed the cat across the
sidewalk, the guy slouched
against the trash bin, denim
jacket and greasy T-shirt
over a rotting, potted belly;
motor-grime junked jeans
to the tops of his $1.35 black
surplus lace-em-up army
boots. . . this cat with lesus
hair and beard framing a
lined and weathered, late
nights-and-daze face,
half-mast eyelids only par
tially obscuring the beggar's
savvy, the joker's wit, as he
called in a scratched, whis
key breath voice: "LSD,
man, there's two kinds: the
kind you take, and the kind
you listen to . . . ever hear
the Dead, man. . .?" And
you'd laugh because
you'd know: he had it too,
man. The Feeling.
—you knew it as you
neared the door; you could
begin to see sense it then
and your nose would twitch

and your body would begin
to shake, and you knew you
were home, past the door
and through the foyer, into
the lobby and suddenly
stroked by the smell of out
sized sugar donuts and
chocolate-chip cookies,
and you could hear the
sound . . . through the
archway, into the dark,
down the day-glo stripped
steps (no tripping here, at
least physically), onto the
painted red wooden floor,
and ZANG! —
—Baby, now you knew.
You knew why they came to
this hulking mother of a
barn, her mile-high ceiling
girdered and hung with
black lights makeyour teeth
look green, and red and
blue lights too; her bal
conies like great matriarchal
arms holding her children
out over the floor, where
hundreds more Believers
shook and danced and
grooved, 'cause nobody got
the feeling if they don't got
it.
And first came the Dark
ness, the signal, because
immediately after came the
Roar, five thousand throats
and hearts, visceral charged
screams urging "take me
with you, let me go, I get it
now, I got The Feeling."
And then the Voice, om
nipotent, kindly, spelling it
out and pushing it on, till
there's The Rising Flash! of
lights coming up, and the
first smashing CHIANG!; the
single chord chasing itself
off the stage and over across
their heads, burning a path
up the balconies and down
the walls till it meets its next
of kin, the two hissing like
hellbent alley cats, devil's
agents with fur raised on
end and claws bared. Then
you're off, and there's no
place to go but out. 'Cause
now everyone's got it.
And so, someone says,
what is this Feeling? Right? I
mean, what are you talking
about all this stuff, and you
don't say what you mean.
And you laugh, ha ha, and
you laugh and say, "so,
what, I describe it to you?
Yeah, and how? How do I
describe high school, and
friends, and crying at night
