# WINTERLAND!
## bruce springsteen/ron lillejord Rockin' your ass off 
### 
"Anyone who has seen Elvis Presley and
doesn't want to be like Elvis Presley has got
something wrong with him."
Bruce Springsteen said that about four years
ago, and at Winterland last month, he continued
his obsessive pursuit of the ultimate in rock 'n'
roll with a show that left everyone involved to
tally drained — happily exhausted. Joined by his
phenemonal E Street Band, Springsteen put on
the truest kind of rock celebration — one that
pours out from the guts, from the heart.
Every last ounce
Springsteen and the E Streeters have the per
fect "rockin' your ass off" philosophy, and they
know how to communicate it. Everything they
do is played like they won't get another chance;
every last ounce of energy is strained out of each
song. "I don't give a damn for just the in
betweens," Springsteen screams in his opening
.number "Badlands," the veins in his neck look
ing like they'd burst anytime. And when he con
tinues, "I want your heart, I want your soul, right
now," you're damn sure he means it — and that
he'll get what he wants.
The people he hadn't convinced by that time
were converted when, during "Spirits in the
Night," Springsteen threw himself onto the
crowd massed on the floor, the people propel
ling him, hand by hand, back to the stage.
The full-tilt fearlessness of the act infected
everyone, and as he slapped hands directly af
terward, Springsteen grinned like a kid who'd
never known adulation before. The audience
was his.
Dreams
In the concert's first set, Springsteen played
most of Darkness on the Edge of Town, his latest
(and best) album. In Darkness, unlike other
Springsteen albums, there's an intense aware
ness that your dreams can be taken away —
"crushed in the dirt" — and will be if you don't
fight for them. The album is tinged with bitter
ness and pain from lies and stolen dreams, but,
overwhelmingly, the tone is inspirational, and
that's made clear when the songs are done live.
The extended "Prove it All Night," with Roy Bit
tan's excellent piano brilliantly underscoring
Springsteen's searing guitar opening, and"The
Promised Land," witb the magnificent Clarence
demons' short blast on sax fitting perfectly be
tween Springsteen's solos on guitar and har
monica, are triumphant shouters — the roars of
the survivors.
The opening set ended with Born to Run's
shatteringly powerful "Jungleland." "Miami."
Steve Van Zandt took on the guitar chores here
and filled effortlessly, and demons dominated
the song with his matchless sax solo. At the end,
stark white lighting revealed a tensed Springs
teen, who wailed: "the poets 'round here, they
don't write nothin'. . . they just stand back and
let it all be." It was a dramatic emotional shift:
the lyrics snarled out in pure anger. In a new
song, "Point Blank," and again in a lengthy story
told in the middle of "Backstreets" about a lover
who'd lied to him, Springsteen would again turn
frighteningly personal. Vou wanted to either
turn away or cry. It's the not-too-pretty flip side
of being a rock 'n' roll survivor.
In the second set, the good-time rock side was
allowed to burst free. The set was dominated by

Springsteen songs that have been covered by
others, including "Fire," where Bruce did a very
good Elvis imitation, and a rowdy "Because the
Night" which blew away the strong Patti Smith
version.
"Because the Night" is the closest Springs
teen comes to English heavy metal; as he prowls
the stage with his guitar flashing, the notes of
the instrument ripping through the hall, you
know that the man has heard Jimmy Page — and
that he s got nothing to apologize for as far as his
playing goes.
In honor of the Christmas season, Springs
teen even pulled out his rocked-up "Santa Claus
is Coming to Town." Clemons put on a red cap
and supplied the rich bass tones of "you better
be good for goodness' sake."
Harder and harder
"Backstreets," "She's the One" and
"Rosalita" completed the set in forceful fashion.
Springsteen and band kept pushing harder and
harder during this half-hour assault; there was
no dip in the energy level. In "Backstreets,"
Danny Federeci contributed moving organ
work. Drummer Max Weinberg powered "She's
the One" and its short intro, the oldie "Hey
Mona,' with a massive bass drum beat. Bassist
Gary Tallent couldn't stop moving — in
"Rosalita," he jumped up and down like a
crazed man.
After the two and a half hours plus that pre
ceded them, the energy and intensity of the
concert's encores were simply difficult to be
lieve. The anthem "Born to Run" came first,
followed by the sing-a-long "Tenth Avenue
Freeze-Out." Then came a dizzying succession
of great oldies: "Raise Your Hand," "Devil with
the Blue Dress On," "Good Golly Miss Molly"
and "Spinnin' Like a Spinning Top;" all fren
zied, good-time danceable rock.
Powerhouse version
The concert ended with a powerhouse ver
sion of the Gary "U.S." Bonds oldie, "A Charter
to Three." Sitting just offstage, Bill Graham
shook his head as if to say "he doesn't have to do
this," when Springsteen jumped off ten-foot
high speakers.
Springsteen paused numerous times during
the song, saying at one point "I think I'm going
to throw up," at another, assuming a De Niro
pose and asking "are you talkin' to me?" in re
sponse to the crowd's cheers. Then he would go
and beat his brains out again, belting out the
chorus for all it was worth.
Revival meeting
At the very end, it was like a revival meeting:
Springsteen screaming as loud as he could "I'm
just a prisoner ... of ROCK AND ROLL ... Do
you all understand me?" Then he left, whipping
his coat in the air, the cheers deafening.
And at that moment, I didn't much care that I
was completely exhausted and couldn't hear or
talk very well. All I wanted to do with my remain
ing energy was rave on about this guy —what he
does is the best thing going right now.
Neil Young put it simply: "Hey, hey. My my.
Rock and roll can never die" — and it's true,
because the rock spirit will be around always, on
the street, somewhere. That spirit was a big part
of what Winterland was, and people like Bruce
Springsteen will, I think, keep proving that it's
still around — proving it all night.

After the two and a half hours plus that pre
ceded them, the energy and intensity of the
concert's encores were simply difficult to be
lieve. The anthem "Born to Run" came first,
followed by the sing-a-long "Tenth Avenue
Freeze-Out." Then came a dizzying succession
of great oldies: "Raise Your Hand," "Devil with
the Blue Dress On," "Good Golly Miss Molly"
and "Spinnin' Like a Spinning Top;" all fren
zied, good-time danceable rock.
Powerhouse version
The concert ended with a powerhouse ver
sion of the Gary "U.S." Bonds oldie, "A Charter
to Three." Sitting just offstage, Bill Graham
shook his head as if to say "he doesn't have to do
this," when Springsteen jumped off ten-foot
high speakers.
Springsteen paused numerous times during
the song, saying at one point "I think I'm going
to throw up," at another, assuming a De Niro
pose and asking "are you talkin' to me?" in re
sponse to the crowd's cheers. Then he would go
and beat his brains out again, belting out the
chorus for all it was worth.
Revival meeting
At the very end, it was like a revival meeting:
Springsteen screaming as loud as he could "I'm
just a prisoner ... of ROCK AND ROLL ... Do
you all understand me?" Then he left, whipping
his coat in the air, the cheers deafening.
And at that moment, I didn't much care that I
was completely exhausted and couldn't hear or
talk very well. All I wanted to do with my remain
ing energy was rave on about this guy —what he
does is the best thing going right now.
Neil Young put it simply: "Hey, hey. My my.
Rock and roll can never die" — and it's true,
because the rock spirit will be around always, on
the street, somewhere. That spirit was a big part
of what Winterland was, and people like Bruce
Springsteen will, I think, keep proving that it's
still around — proving it all night.



Bruce Springsteen (with "The Big Man" Clarence Clemons), who played Winterland, December 15 and
16, as part of the closing of the famous hall.

"Anyone who has seen Elvis Presley and
doesn't want to be like Elvis Presley has got
something wrong with him."
Bruce Springsteen said that about four years
ago, and at Winterland last month, he continued
his obsessive pursuit of the ultimate in rock 'n'
roll with a show that left everyone involved to
tally drained — happily exhausted. Joined by his
phenemonal E Street Band, Springsteen put on
the truest kind of rock celebration — one that
pours out from the guts, from the heart.
Every last ounce
Springsteen and the E Streeters have the per
fect "rockin' your ass off" philosophy, and they
know how to communicate it. Everything they
do is played like they won't get another chance;
every last ounce of energy is strained out of each
song. "I don't give a damn for just the in
betweens," Springsteen screams in his opening
.number "Badlands," the veins in his neck look
ing like they'd burst anytime. And when he con
tinues, "I want your heart, I want your soul, right
now," you're damn sure he means it — and that
he'll get what he wants.
The people he hadn't convinced by that time
were converted when, during "Spirits in the
Night," Springsteen threw himself onto the
crowd massed on the floor, the people propel
ling him, hand by hand, back to the stage.
The full-tilt fearlessness of the act infected
everyone, and as he slapped hands directly af
terward, Springsteen grinned like a kid who'd
never known adulation before. The audience
was his.
Dreams
In the concert's first set, Springsteen played
most of Darkness on the Edge of Town, his latest
(and best) album. In Darkness, unlike other
Springsteen albums, there's an intense aware
ness that your dreams can be taken away —
"crushed in the dirt" — and will be if you don't
fight for them. The album is tinged with bitter
ness and pain from lies and stolen dreams, but,
overwhelmingly, the tone is inspirational, and
that's made clear when the songs are done live.
The extended "Prove it All Night," with Roy Bit
tan's excellent piano brilliantly underscoring
Springsteen's searing guitar opening, and"The
Promised Land," witb the magnificent Clarence
demons' short blast on sax fitting perfectly be
tween Springsteen's solos on guitar and har
monica, are triumphant shouters — the roars of
the survivors.
The opening set ended with Born to Run's
shatteringly powerful "Jungleland." "Miami."
Steve Van Zandt took on the guitar chores here
and filled effortlessly, and demons dominated
the song with his matchless sax solo. At the end,
stark white lighting revealed a tensed Springs
teen, who wailed: "the poets 'round here, they
don't write nothin'. . . they just stand back and
let it all be." It was a dramatic emotional shift:
the lyrics snarled out in pure anger. In a new
song, "Point Blank," and again in a lengthy story
told in the middle of "Backstreets" about a lover
who'd lied to him, Springsteen would again turn
frighteningly personal. Vou wanted to either
turn away or cry. It's the not-too-pretty flip side
of being a rock 'n' roll survivor.
In the second set, the good-time rock side was
allowed to burst free. The set was dominated by

Springsteen songs that have been covered by
others, including "Fire," where Bruce did a very
good Elvis imitation, and a rowdy "Because the
Night" which blew away the strong Patti Smith
version.
"Because the Night" is the closest Springs
teen comes to English heavy metal; as he prowls
the stage with his guitar flashing, the notes of
the instrument ripping through the hall, you
know that the man has heard Jimmy Page — and
that he s got nothing to apologize for as far as his
playing goes.
In honor of the Christmas season, Springs
teen even pulled out his rocked-up "Santa Claus
is Coming to Town." Clemons put on a red cap
and supplied the rich bass tones of "you better
be good for goodness' sake."
Harder and harder
"Backstreets," "She's the One" and
"Rosalita" completed the set in forceful fashion.
Springsteen and band kept pushing harder and
harder during this half-hour assault; there was
no dip in the energy level. In "Backstreets,"
Danny Federeci contributed moving organ
work. Drummer Max Weinberg powered "She's
the One" and its short intro, the oldie "Hey
Mona,' with a massive bass drum beat. Bassist
Gary Tallent couldn't stop moving — in
"Rosalita," he jumped up and down like a
crazed man.
