Economics and complaints from the
neighbors.
It you can believe Bill Graham, those were
the primary reasons why the Winterland bal
lroom will no longer be used by Graham's or
ganization for rock concerts.
In a press conference prior to the final con
certs at Winterland, Graham explained his
reasons for his decision not to renew his lease
on the old building, a lease he had held for 13
years.
According to Graham, Winterland was being
used sparingly (only 11 times in 1978) even
during the last year. The primary reason,
Graham said, that they even kept it open last
year was "because of the Dead (The Grateful
Dead) more than anything else. And for the
chance that, on occasion, we would be suc
cessful in appealing to the artistic, creative and
communal intent of ?. visiting artist, so as to
pose the challenge of Winterland to him."
But, Graham explained, the small size of
Winterland (5400 people) made most concerts
there economically unattractive.
"When you have groups now who are capa
ble of drawing 3000 or 4000 seats, the desire,
more often than not, is to package them with
another group and go into the Cow Palace, or
go into Oakland (Coliseum), or wait for the
summer (Days on the Green)," Graham said.
Not only did the economics of Graham's or
ganization contribute to Winterland's closing,

but the decision was also influenced by the
economics of the groups that Graham signed
to play in the Bay Area.
"Majorgroupsthat could haveplayed places
two and three times bigger than that didn't
want to support that building," Graham said.
"Some of these groups think their life-span
of major popularity lasts "x" number of years,"
he continued, "and they want to capitalize on
that."
Graham added that the cost of going on the
road for groups is very high. Consequently,
they plan out tours carefully, often touring
only during the summer. That's another reason
why they want to maximize the money they
earn on tours, Graham said.
Besides economics, however, Graham said
he has been receiving numerous letters from
the residents who live in the area around Win
terland, complaining of litter and other prob
lems.
According to Graham, the residents are at
tempting to improve the neighborhood, and
the accumulation of beer cans and other de-'
bris that is left by concert-goers is hampering
their attempts to keep the area clean. Noise
pollution was also cited by Graham as a com
mon complaint.
But, Graham emphasized, "even if the
neighborhood problem didn't exist, the
economics of the business just didn't allow
