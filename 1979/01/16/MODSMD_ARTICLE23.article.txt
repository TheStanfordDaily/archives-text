## Petty brings the building down 
### 
Two nights before Winterland Ballroom closed its doors to
concert-goers forthe final time, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers
and the Greg Kihn Band threatened to bring the building down
around them.
On Dec. 30, two days before Bill Graham's lease ran out, the
two groups put on a show that carried the crowd of over 5400 to
feverish delerium.
Kihn opened the show by announcing, "Let's rock this place!"
He and his band went on to keep that promise, beginning with a
driving version of Buddy Holly's "Love's Made a Fool of You"
from Kihn's second album. The mood for the evening was set and
Kihn next went about winning the audience's favor with his hit
"Remember" from his latest album, Next of Kihn.
.The audience was easily won overand kihn spent the rest of the
evening proving that he is one of Rock and Roll's fastest-rising
new talents. He played a mixed selection from each of his three
albums, including "For You," which he dedicated to the author
â€” Bruce Springsteen, "Cold Hard Cash," "All the Right
Reasons," "Secret Meetings" and "Chinatown."
Satisfying the audience
Also included in the show was an excellent version of Jonathan
Richman's "Roadrunner." Kihn encored with "Museum" from
Next of...but the audience wasn't satisfied and stomped on the
floor until the band returned once more, playing Lou Reed's
"Sweet )ane."
Last year, when Petty played at Winterland as the second bill to
Be Bop Deluxe, the Heartbreakers stole the show from the head
liners.
This year, the tables were nearly turned on Petty as he and his
band had a difficult time matching Kihn's frenzied intensity.
Though Petty put on a tighter and more professional shovy Satur

day than he has since he began touring, he did not totally capture
the audience's emotions until he was through his set.
Part of the reason may have been the relative deemphasization of
the guitar lines in the concert. Though the overall band sound
was extremely tight and entertaining, the hard driving sound of
Petty's rhythm guitar and Mike Campbell's lead was noticeably
lacking for the first half of the show.
Pouting sex-symbol
Like Kihn, Petty mixed his selections well and entertained the
audience with his usual pouting sex-symbol stage demeanor.
Along with his old standards like "Breakdown," "American Girl"
and a sizzling version of "Strangtered in the Night," Petty intro
duced three new songs. Of the three, "Refugee" is likely to
become Petty's next big hit.
The second half of Petty's performance was outstanding. In the
four times I've seen him, this was definitely his best effort. His
encores were the best part of the whole show. "Shout!" was the
first encore, which ended with Petty falling into the audience. He
had to be rescued by the roadies when his hysterical fans
wouldn't let him go. Several times during the performance,
over-excited female fans had to be restrained when they climbed
on stage.
"I Fought the Law" was Petty's second encore and a new song,
"Even the Losers Get Lucky Sometimes" was his final effort of the
evening.
The pairing of the two acts for the show was a very smart move.
The styles of the two bands are similar and compliment each
other on stage very well. Both hands are professional, tight and
exciting. They are unquestionably the two most promising stars
on Rock and Roll's horizon.
