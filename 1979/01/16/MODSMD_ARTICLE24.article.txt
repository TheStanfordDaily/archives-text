## The
						Dead close their home court 
### 
"Well the joint was jumpin'
Coin' 'round and 'round,
Hey, reelin' and a-rockin,'
What a crazy sound.
No, they never stopped rockin'
Till the moon went down!"
- B. Weir, quoting C. Berry
All right, okay, maybe I
shouldn't have resorted to sel
ling my sister into white slav
ery, but I had to, to get a ticket
to the New Year's Eve Last Day
of Winterland concert. What
Deadhead could pass up se
eing the grateful Dead playing
from midnight todawn on their
home court? The non-
Deadheads came either as a
last farewell or in hopes that a
Last Waltz-type conglomera
tion of Bay Area musicians
would be joining the Dead on
stage during the night. Some
came expecting that at thirty
dollars ($30.00) a pop they
would be provided free
cocaine or Beatles' nose hairs.
Return to the golden daze
For we psychedelic relics of
the '60s, the concert was to be a
return to the golden daze of

San Francisco music: New
Year's Eve concerts at the
Fillmore or Avalon, lasting
from 9p.m. to9a.m., with a bill
of the Dead, Quicksilver Mes
senger Service, AND Santana,
followed by a breakfast. This
time the lineup was to be the
Dead, the New Riders of the
Purple Sage, and those "Soul
Men," the Blues Brothers, with
breakfast at dawn.
Bizarre angles
The importance of the con
cert resulted in much advance
publicity, in the major news
magazines such as Rolling
Stone and Dead Relix. On the
day of the concert the televi
sion news vultures swooped
in, to scoop up any interesting
and/or bizarre angles to the
event. Scoop (Nisker) scooped
them all with his interviews of
Deadheads who had come
from Boston, New York,
Alaska, the Moon, to line up
one to six days ahead of time
on the sidewalk outside Win
terland. These were the same
people who had followed their
musical Moseses to three
concerts at the pyramids in
Egypt during September 1978.
Some came with tickets, but
many came without, desper
ately hoping to trade drugs or
money for the few tickets
being "resold." (The night of
the concert, $100 was not a rare
price for tickets; rumors of
some heinous scalpers getting
$200 were probably true.
Thank you, Bill Graham.)
The concert started nearly
on time at 8:00 p.m., with a
standard set by the New Rid
ers, followed by a high energy
set by Elwood and Juliet lake
Blues and their band (mostly
the same personnel as on their
album, Briefcase Full of Blues).
Dan Aykroyd proved again that
he is a fine harpist and handled
his one vocal, "Rubber Bis

cuit," admirably. John Belushi
was manic, frantic, and superb
on vocals. Some of their Satur
day Night Live compatriots
provided spiritual assistance
from backstage.
Then began the wait for the
midnight hour and the appear
ance of our heroes.
Opening the New Year
At the stroke of 12:01 the
Dead appeared, opening the
New Year traditionally with
their ode to the perenially
flowering "Sugar Magnolia."
The crowd continued roaring
through the medley of "Scarlet
Begonias" and "Fire On the
Mountain." The remainder of
the set included many old and
new favorites, with the Stones'
"It's All Over Now" providing a
fitting rock n' roll tribute tothe
old wooden arena.
Guests and jams
Following a short break for
refueling, the second set be
gan, the words of Reverend
Gary Davis promising that "It I
had my way, I would tear this
old building down," but the
crowd certainly intended to
wait until after breakfast to
begin the tearing-down. Altera
percussion jam, guests began
appearing on stage, including
harpists Matthew Kelly (who
played on the Dead's
Shakedown Street album) and
Lee Oskar (from the "Cisco
Kid" days of War) and old
friend John Cippolina. Other
musicians could be seen
backstage, but the Dead's
music, unlike the Band's, is not
conducive to thirty-player
jams. The presence of the
ghosts of former Winterland
performers could be felt, how
ever. And the sight of Ken
Kesey on stage setting off
explosives stirred memories of
the Trips Festivals and Acid
Tests in which the arena and its

contents had participated.
Nostalgic joy was reflected
by the illegal smiles of
Deadheads sent into ecstacy at
the beginning of the third set
by the appearance after 1535
days of "Dark Star," its spacey
wanderings leading to the au
tobiographical story of life in
Palo Alto and San Francisco
with Kesey, Neal Cassady, and
the Merry Pranksters, con
tained in the song "That's It For
the Other One." The musical
peaks continued through
superb versions of "Wharf Rat"
and "Saint Stephen" until the
finger was pulled out of the
happiness dike, and "Good
Lovin'" erupted over the
crowd.
High Octave
It was approximately 5:30
a.m. as the set closed. One
might have expected that the
band and crowd would be too
drained to continue the party.
But these were the Dead and
their Heads, and they were all
on high octane that night. So,
putting their fingers aside of
their noses, up the chimney
they roses. After hopping
aboard the driving train of
"Casey Jones," the real thing
added life to the high-powered
finale, "Johnny B. Goode."
With one last trip to the mic
rophones, Grateful Dead said
farewell to an extraordinary
year, an extraordinary evening,
and an extraordinary concert
hall, with "We Bid You Good
night."
As we stumbled outside fol
lowing a breakfast of crepes
and ham, the morning sunlight
issuing in a Happy New Year
shone on the painted message
which in its simplicity explains
the phenomenon of the Grate
ful Dead concerts: "They
aren't just the best at what they
do, they're the only ones who
do what they do."
