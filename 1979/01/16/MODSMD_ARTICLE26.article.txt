# Black students, faculty meet
## King's birthday marked here 
### ROBERT REED 
In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the
birth of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a
group of about 90 black students, faculty and staff
met last night to discuss the black community here.
"What Dr. King tried to do was transform the Un
ited States from a white nation into an American na
tion," said Prof. Sylvia Wynter, chairman of the Afri
can and Afro-American Studies Dept. Wynter said
members of the black community here should try for
the same unity.
Wynter also said that blacks must keep contesting
issues concerning black people, however small they
may appear.
Heriry Organ, of the Office of Development and
spokesman for the black staff, discussed employee
grievances, specifically last year's dismissals of two
black University employees, Hinda Smith-
Washington and Sonya Jackson.
Organ said the University, one of the largest
employers in the Bay Area, is a trendsetter. Blacks
must be concerned with the actions the University
takes as well as with the standards it sets, he said.
Another issue discussed was the Sloan Foundation

Scholarships.
According to Art Walker, associate professor of
applied physics, the Sloan Foundation is considering
awarding scholarships to graduate minority engineer
ing students. However, in light of the Supreme
Court's Bakke decision, there may be problems in
volved in instituting this program.
Melanie Reeves, assistant dean of undergraduate
studies and chairman of the black caucus here, ex
pressed concern about the decline of minority
graduate admissions. She said that some kind of ac
tion must be taken by the University to alleviate this
problem.
Black House
Renovation of the Black House, a service center for
the black community, as well as renovation of Har
mony House — which houses the Black Theatre of
Performing Arts — were also discussed.
Black Liberation Month activities, which start on
Jan. 25 and continue through the end of the quarter
was discussed. Highlighting the activities of the first
week will be black actor William Marshall's on
campus portrayal of Frederick Douglass, an
abolitionist of the 1800s.
