# Between University and Nationals
## Conflict plagues sororities here 
### NEIL MACFARQUHAR 
As rush season approaches, the
sororities here are caught between
the policies of their national organi
zations and the need to be recog
nized by the University.
The problem is caused by a conflict
between the national sorority tradi
tion of letteib of recommendation
from people outside the University
forfreshmengoingthrough rushand
the University's Residential Educa
tion policy that membership selec
tion for local groups cannot be influ
enced by outside sources.
Sororities may have to choose be
tween national or University recogni
tion, said Patricia Brandt, adviser to
sororities. Without University rec
ognition, sororities will lose the use
of the University's name and re
sources, she said.
According to Inter-Sorority Coun

cil (ISC) President Tami Ritchey, the
local chapters received a letter last
month from their national presidents
(Nationals) asking them not to seek
University recognition at this time
since not all of them could be ap
proved.
The Nationals opposed the fact
that the University would not allow
someone outside the local group to
set the membership acceptance pol
icy. The Nationals believed that the
University would not permit the use
of any field secretaries, counselors,
or advisers they might provide,
Ritchey said.
However, as Office of Residential
Education (ORE) Director Norm
Robinson explained in a memo to
local sorority representatives, "We
encourage the role of advisers, so
long as they are limited to advice
giving and not usurping those func

tions that properly belong to the stu
dents."
Residential Education policy states
that "the selection process (rush)
may not in any manner involve letters
of reference...from any source out
side the University for the purposes
of deciding whether or not to
select...any particular student."
Robinson said it would be "inap
propriate for an outsider to have an
influence on a student's access to
University resources." Since the
sororities have traditionally been the
stronghold of the "white, upper
middle class," he said he fears that
the Nationals might "give preference
to some more than others."
Alpha Phi President Janice Kimball
said the Nationals "have been
around for hundreds of years —
longer than this University — and
these are important policies which
they are not going to change for us.
They would rather we have an off
campus system, which has been re
ally successful elsewhere."
Few people believe that an off
campus system could work here.
"The national sororities don't seem
to understand that off-campus would
not work here and would probably
close down the system since Stan
ford is such a self-contained com
munity," Brandt said.
"It would be difficult to exist off
campus," added Robinson, "since
they would need vehicles and have
to meet Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County zoning laws."
According to Ritchey, moving the
system off-campus would defeat one
purpose of re-establishing it in the
first place. "The sororities are
needed as women's clubs, to fill the
needs of women on campus," she
said.

Ritchey believes that moving the
system off-campus is the sororities'
last alternative. She said the differ
ences of opinion have not been dis
cussed.
"The girls are loyal to the Univer
sity. They don't want to be separated
nor antagonistic," Brandt said.
If sororities decide to seek recog
nition from the University, the pro
cess will be long. Each proposal has
to be read by the national sorority to
ensure their policies are stated cor
rectly before it is submitted to the
ORE.
The University has already begun
to revoke some of the temporary
privileges it granted the sororities,
Ritchey said. Many sororities have
started to meet off-campus because
they are no longer allowed to use
dorm lounges.
If the issue has not been resolved
by spring, the sororities will have to
look into the feasibility of holding an
off-campus rush, a situation Kimball
called "a scary prospect."

Ritchey said. Many sororities have
started to meet off-campus because
they are no longer allowed to use
dorm lounges.
If the issue has not been resolved
by spring, the sororities will have to
look into the feasibility of holding an
off-campus rush, a situation Kimball
called "a scary prospect."
As rush season approaches, the
sororities here are caught between
the policies of their national organi
zations and the need to be recog
nized by the University.
The problem is caused by a conflict
between the national sorority tradi
tion of letteib of recommendation
from people outside the University
forfreshmengoingthrough rushand
the University's Residential Educa
tion policy that membership selec
tion for local groups cannot be influ
enced by outside sources.
Sororities may have to choose be
tween national or University recogni
tion, said Patricia Brandt, adviser to
sororities. Without University rec
ognition, sororities will lose the use
of the University's name and re
sources, she said.
According to Inter-Sorority Coun

cil (ISC) President Tami Ritchey, the
local chapters received a letter last
month from their national presidents
(Nationals) asking them not to seek
University recognition at this time
since not all of them could be ap
proved.
The Nationals opposed the fact
that the University would not allow
someone outside the local group to
set the membership acceptance pol
icy. The Nationals believed that the
University would not permit the use
of any field secretaries, counselors,
or advisers they might provide,
Ritchey said.
However, as Office of Residential
Education (ORE) Director Norm
Robinson explained in a memo to
local sorority representatives, "We
encourage the role of advisers, so
long as they are limited to advice
giving and not usurping those func

tions that properly belong to the stu
dents."
Residential Education policy states
that "the selection process (rush)
may not in any manner involve letters
of reference...from any source out
side the University for the purposes
of deciding whether or not to
select...any particular student."
Robinson said it would be "inap
propriate for an outsider to have an
influence on a student's access to
University resources." Since the
sororities have traditionally been the
stronghold of the "white, upper
middle class," he said he fears that
the Nationals might "give preference
to some more than others."
Alpha Phi President Janice Kimball
said the Nationals "have been
around for hundreds of years —
longer than this University — and
these are important policies which
they are not going to change for us.
They would rather we have an off
campus system, which has been re
ally successful elsewhere."
Few people believe that an off
campus system could work here.
"The national sororities don't seem
to understand that off-campus would
not work here and would probably
close down the system since Stan
ford is such a self-contained com
munity," Brandt said.
"It would be difficult to exist off
campus," added Robinson, "since
they would need vehicles and have
to meet Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County zoning laws."
According to Ritchey, moving the
system off-campus would defeat one
purpose of re-establishing it in the
first place. "The sororities are
needed as women's clubs, to fill the
needs of women on campus," she
said.

Ritchey believes that moving the
system off-campus is the sororities'
last alternative. She said the differ
ences of opinion have not been dis
cussed.
"The girls are loyal to the Univer
sity. They don't want to be separated
nor antagonistic," Brandt said.
If sororities decide to seek recog
nition from the University, the pro
cess will be long. Each proposal has
to be read by the national sorority to
ensure their policies are stated cor
rectly before it is submitted to the
ORE.
The University has already begun
to revoke some of the temporary
privileges it granted the sororities,
Ritchey said. Many sororities have
started to meet off-campus because
they are no longer allowed to use
dorm lounges.
If the issue has not been resolved
by spring, the sororities will have to
look into the feasibility of holding an
off-campus rush, a situation Kimball
called "a scary prospect."
