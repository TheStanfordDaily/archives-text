# Between University and Nationals
## Conflict plagues sororities here 
### NEIL MACFARQUHAR 
As rush season approaches, the
sororities here are caught between
the policies of their national organi
zations and the need to be recog
nized by the University.
The problem is caused by a conflict
between the national sorority tradi
tion of letteib of recommendation
from people outside the University
forfreshmengoingthrough rushand
the University's Residential Educa
tion policy that membership selec
tion for local groups cannot be influ
enced by outside sources.
Sororities may have to choose be
tween national or University recogni
tion, said Patricia Brandt, adviser to
sororities. Without University rec
ognition, sororities will lose the use
of the University's name and re
sources, she said.
According to Inter-Sorority Coun

local chapters received a letter last
month from their national presidents
(Nationals) asking them not to seek
University recognition at this time
since not all of them could be ap

The Nationals opposed the fact
that the University would not allow
someone outside the local group to
set the membership acceptance pol

University would not permit the use
of any field secretaries, counselors,
or advisers they might provide,
Ritchey said.
However, as Office of Residential
Education (ORE) Director Norm
Robinson explained in a memo to
local sorority representatives, "We
encourage the role of advisers, so
long as they are limited to advice
giving and not usurping those func

tions that properly belong to the stu
dents."
Residential Education policy states
that "the selection process (rush)
may not in any manner involve letters
of reference...from any source out
side the University for the purposes
of deciding whether or not to
select...any particular student."
Robinson said it would be "inap
propriate for an outsider to have an
influence on a student's access to
University resources." Since the
sororities have traditionally been the
stronghold of the "white, upper
middle class," he said he fears that
the Nationals might "give preference
to some more than others."
Alpha Phi President Janice Kimball
said the Nationals "have been
around for hundreds of years â€”
