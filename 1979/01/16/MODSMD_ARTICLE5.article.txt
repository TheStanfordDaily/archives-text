# Shah to leave Iran, family members flee

Tehran, Iran (AP) â€” Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi, his power crumbl
ing and many of his people rejoicing
in his downfall, will leave Iran today
for Egypt and the United States, in
formed sources said yesterday. Many
expect his journey to end in perma
nent exile.
Political violence erupted anew as
this country awaited the uncertain
ties of a post-shah era.
Among at least 18 persons re
ported killed in two days of
bloodshed was a former U.S. Air
Force colonel, Martin Berkowitz, 53,
of San Francisco, the second Ameri
can slain in 12 months of nationwide
turmoil here.
The Iranian Senate hastily gave its
endorsement yesterday to the new
government of Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar, a prominent op
position figure, and the lower house
of Parliament was expected to vote
its approval today.
The shah is scheduled to hold a
rare news conference late this morn
ing, apparently just before flying out
of the country.
By leaving, the shah will clear the
way for Bakhtiar to take full control of
the nation. But the new prime minis
ter must overcome the political
stigma of having been chosen by the
shah and must deal with the power
ful Moslem religious leaders, chiefly
the exiled Ayatullah Khomaini, who
want to establish an Islamic republic
of their design.

More than 100,000 jubilant Iranians
converged on Tehran's main bazaar
district yesterday, cheerfully chant
ing "Death to the shah!" and "Long
live Khomaini!"
No major bloodshed was reported
in Tehran, but reports reaching the
capital said at least 17 persons were
killed Sunday in violence in 21 towns
and cities, and at least one death was
reported yesterday.
More than 1500 persons are esti
mated to have been killed in the
year-long political upheaval.
The newspaper Khayan said Ber
kowitz, identified as head of a
copper-mining firm, Parson-Jordan
Co., apparently was stabbed Sunday
night in the kitchen of his home in
the southeast city of Kerman.
Anti-Americanism runs strong
among the shah's opponents be
cause of Washington's support for
the monarch and because of what
many Iranians consider Western
domination of their country.
In a related development, an Im
perial Iranian 747 jet, believed to be
carrying the mother-in-law and three
children of the Shah of Iran, landed
in New Jersey last night as the shah's
37-year reign apparently neared its
end. The passengers took off in
another plane for a secret destina
tion.
Air Force officials, the State De
partment and the Iranian Embassy in
Washington would not say where the
plane was headed.
