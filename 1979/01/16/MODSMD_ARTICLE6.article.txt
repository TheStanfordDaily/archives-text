# Chomsky says elite sets U.S. foreign policy

### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
The monied elite in the United
States and the Western press have
convinced most of the Western
world of "the logical impossibility of
the United States committing ag
gression," Noam Chomsky, noted
MIT linguist' sa»d in a speech last
night.
A crowd of more than 400 gathered
in Braun Auditorium of the Mudd
Chemistry building to hear Chomsky
describe how this and other beliefs
have evolved in the United States
and to explain what he felt are the
true causes of U.S. intervention ab
road.
Chomsky, who was a leading op
ponent of the Vietnam War and has
written several articles and books on
U.S. foreign policy, said that the Un
ited States is essentially controlled by

rich industrialists allied with gov
ernment leaders. The government
leaders themselves have interests
similar to those of the rich because
many of them come from this indust
rial elite.
Their primary concern, he as
sorted, is the protection and expan
sion of their capital wherever it is iri
the world. This idea is so basic, he
added, that "it ought to be the kind
of thing people learn in third grade."
He said the primary doctrine of this
country is that "(it) is fundamentally
benevolent." He said the second as
sumption made is that "what the Un
ited States does is primarily reac
tive."
He cited an article written by the
New York Times' Anthony Lewis, also
a sharp critic of the Vietnam War.
Lewis said the war was "a case of our
blundering efforts to do good."
Chomsky said that the intent of the
United States here as in most other
literature is rarely questioned. "The
question is not could (the United
States) win or couldn't they. It's
should they win," he declared.
Chomsky said the facts bear out
the reality that the U.S. military's

main attack was against the rural
community of South Vietnam, not
against foreign intervention.
He pointed out that the United
States was not the only country post
uring good intentions in foreign
lands. The Soviet Union can't under
stand how the people of the world
could criticize them "for doing
something so obviously selfless as
going into Czechoslovakia," he ad
ded.
He said there is a "state religion" in
the United States which is spread by
"secular priests" of the ruling intel
lectual elite. Political analyst Hans
Morgenthau was cited by Chomsky
as an example of a secular priest.
Morgenthau believes the United
States has a mission to spread equal
ity and freedom throughout the
world. Chomsky said its failure to do
this is evidenced by the number of
"neo-Fascist" regimes it supports.
Morgenthau seems to feel these fai
lures reflect shortcomings, rather
than sham, Chomsky said.
Chomsky explained, "It's not that
we failed to achieve the kind of world
we wanted. We did to a large ex
tent." A rational analysis of events

reveals that the true purpose of
American foreign policy was largely
to achieve domination and security
for its capital abroad, he said.
Because the "state religion" had
been partially destroyed by the war
in Vietnam, the United States with
the help of the press has tried to re
build popular faith in that "religion."
This is being achieved, Chomsky
explained, by attempting to show
that "we are good and they are bad."
He cited the tremendous amount
of coverage given by the Western
press to the events in Cambodia. The
coverage emphasized the atrocities
of the communist regime there, ac
cording to Chomsky. But Chomsky
claimed the evidence was not solid,
although he did not say he knew
what is happening in Cambodia.
He contrasted Cambodian cover
age with the lack of news reports of
attacks on the island of East Timor
near Indonesia. The American
supplied Indonesian army has been
waging war on the island since 1975,
Chomsky said. Although as many as
100,000 Timorians have died in the
fighting, little has appeared in the
press about the war, he added.

attacks on the island of East Timor
near Indonesia. The American
supplied Indonesian army has been
waging war on the island since 1975,
Chomsky said. Although as many as
100,000 Timorians have died in the
fighting, little has appeared in the
press about the war, he added.
The monied elite in the United
States and the Western press have
convinced most of the Western
world of "the logical impossibility of
the United States committing ag
gression," Noam Chomsky, noted
MIT linguist' sa»d in a speech last
night.
A crowd of more than 400 gathered
in Braun Auditorium of the Mudd
Chemistry building to hear Chomsky
describe how this and other beliefs
have evolved in the United States
and to explain what he felt are the
true causes of U.S. intervention ab
road.
Chomsky, who was a leading op
ponent of the Vietnam War and has
written several articles and books on
U.S. foreign policy, said that the Un
ited States is essentially controlled by

rich industrialists allied with gov
ernment leaders. The government
leaders themselves have interests
similar to those of the rich because
many of them come from this indust
rial elite.
Their primary concern, he as
sorted, is the protection and expan
sion of their capital wherever it is iri
the world. This idea is so basic, he
added, that "it ought to be the kind
of thing people learn in third grade."
He said the primary doctrine of this
country is that "(it) is fundamentally
benevolent." He said the second as
sumption made is that "what the Un
ited States does is primarily reac
tive."
He cited an article written by the
New York Times' Anthony Lewis, also
a sharp critic of the Vietnam War.
Lewis said the war was "a case of our
blundering efforts to do good."
Chomsky said that the intent of the
United States here as in most other
literature is rarely questioned. "The
question is not could (the United
States) win or couldn't they. It's
should they win," he declared.
Chomsky said the facts bear out
the reality that the U.S. military's

main attack was against the rural
community of South Vietnam, not
against foreign intervention.
He pointed out that the United
States was not the only country post
uring good intentions in foreign
lands. The Soviet Union can't under
stand how the people of the world
could criticize them "for doing
something so obviously selfless as
going into Czechoslovakia," he ad
ded.
He said there is a "state religion" in
the United States which is spread by
"secular priests" of the ruling intel
lectual elite. Political analyst Hans
Morgenthau was cited by Chomsky
as an example of a secular priest.
Morgenthau believes the United
States has a mission to spread equal
ity and freedom throughout the
world. Chomsky said its failure to do
this is evidenced by the number of
"neo-Fascist" regimes it supports.
Morgenthau seems to feel these fai
lures reflect shortcomings, rather
than sham, Chomsky said.
Chomsky explained, "It's not that
we failed to achieve the kind of world
we wanted. We did to a large ex
tent." A rational analysis of events

reveals that the true purpose of
American foreign policy was largely
to achieve domination and security
for its capital abroad, he said.
Because the "state religion" had
been partially destroyed by the war
in Vietnam, the United States with
the help of the press has tried to re
build popular faith in that "religion."
This is being achieved, Chomsky
explained, by attempting to show
that "we are good and they are bad."
He cited the tremendous amount
of coverage given by the Western
press to the events in Cambodia. The
coverage emphasized the atrocities
of the communist regime there, ac
cording to Chomsky. But Chomsky
claimed the evidence was not solid,
although he did not say he knew
what is happening in Cambodia.
He contrasted Cambodian cover
age with the lack of news reports of
attacks on the island of East Timor
near Indonesia. The American
supplied Indonesian army has been
waging war on the island since 1975,
Chomsky said. Although as many as
100,000 Timorians have died in the
fighting, little has appeared in the
press about the war, he added.
