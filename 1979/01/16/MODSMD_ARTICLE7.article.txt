# China scholar discusses normalization
## China ties lead to Taiwan turmoil 
### MARK MORODOMI 
President ]imniy Carter's move to normalize relations
with the People's Republic of China (PRC) was
applauded by most of the world, but normalization
acted like a bombshell to the people of Taiwan.
Victor Li, professor of law and director of East Asian
'Studies was in Taiwan when normalization was an
nounced.
"The Taiwan problem is st ;l ! there; normalization
doesn't change things too much. And that there is a
potential source of abrasion between the United States
and the PRC, depending on which path Taiwan takes
over time, isn't something Washington or Peking has
much control over.
"There is a domestic, internal dynamo in Taiwan poli
tics that will turn. It can turn faster or slower, but things
will happen," Li said.

News Analysis

Although the Nationalist Party is the only party in the
nation, there is a growing public trend away from the
party. Last year, in local elections, non-party candidates
polled 38 percent of the popular vote.
Li, an expert on Chinese and international law and
Chinese politics, was in Taipei observing the two-week
election campaign that began Dec. 13. The announce
ment of normalization on Dec. 15 suspended the elec
tions "right smack in the middle," Li said.
"There was a lot of political debate and discussion,
and to have normalization dropped on this thoroughly
confused the issues. The debate prior to normalization
concerned purely domestic issues; this normalization
adds a different element in a potentially disruptive man
ner," Li said.
With the suspended elections added to the normaliza
tion announcement, the Taiwan government is on the
brink of a state ot confusion. The legislators' terms will
expire soon, and there is no one to replace them.
The suspension could "last a long time or end next
month," Li said. "The election was an example of a very
gradual and somewhat tentative move towards democ
ratization of Taiwan. It ended," he said.
Timing questioned
Li said he questions the importance for the U.S. of
making the announcement on Dec. 15. "The main
reason that's given is the fear of a leak," he said. "I must
say I just don't understand that as a reason.

"Leaks are our business, not Taiwan's business.
Would Barry Coldwater have complained any more
loudly or effectively if he had known beforehand?," Li
said.
Other sources suggest that the decision was made at
that time to divert attention from the failure of Secretary
of State Cyrus Vance's "shuttle diplomacy," according
to a December issue of Time.
The ideology of both Taiwan and the PRC emphasize
the existence of only one China. Ninety percent of the
Taiwanese legislators represent the mainland and were
last elected in 1947. However, 80 to 85 percent of
Taiwan's 17 million people are native to the island.
The long-term question the Taiwanese people must
consider is how long it will take for the 1947 legislators to
"die off," Li said. Estimates predict the last mainland
representative to die in about 2007, he said.
Taiwan has two courses to choose from: increase the
amount of seats alloted to the island orallow the legisla
ture to become very small. Each course moves toward
democratization of Taiwan's one party government, Li
said.
According to Li, Taiwan is raising the possibility of a
plan called "The German Formula." This allows the Un
ited States to recognize the PRC and its claims, while also
recognizing Taiwan and its claims.
"The dilemma that the Taiwan government is in is that
if it relinquishes its claim to the mainland, how do you
explain the continual holding of power by the 1200
people of the national assembly and the 400 in the na
tional legislature?," Li said. If Taiwan does not relinquish
claims to the mainland, then the U.S. and most of the
world will disagree with Taiwan's claim to the mainland,
he said.
Although Washington is allowing the mutual defense
pact with Taiwan to expire, the United States plans on
continuing selling defensive weaponry to Taiwan, ac
cording to Li. Peking stresses that such selling of arms
would "violate the principles of normalization," he said.
Li concluded, "Taiwan may be a small place, but it isn't
all that tiny, and it is an independent actor. In the sense
of'could westopTaiwan from going nuclearorcould we
stop them from dealing with the Russians,' there we may
have quite a bit of leverage.
"But in terms of domestic internal change, that's
going to happen," he said. "We don't know what direc
tion it's going to take, but something's got to happen."

over time, isn't something Washington or Peking has
much control over.
"There is a domestic, internal dynamo in Taiwan poli
tics that will turn. It can turn faster or slower, but things
will happen," Li said.

News Analysis

Although the Nationalist Party is the only party in the
nation, there is a growing public trend away from the
party. Last year, in local elections, non-party candidates
polled 38 percent of the popular vote.
Li, an expert on Chinese and international law and
Chinese politics, was in Taipei observing the two-week
election campaign that began Dec. 13. The announce
ment of normalization on Dec. 15 suspended the elec
tions "right smack in the middle," Li said.
"There was a lot of political debate and discussion,
and to have normalization dropped on this thoroughly
confused the issues. The debate prior to normalization
concerned purely domestic issues; this normalization
adds a different element in a potentially disruptive man
ner," Li said.
With the suspended elections added to the normaliza
tion announcement, the Taiwan government is on the
brink of a state ot confusion. The legislators' terms will
expire soon, and there is no one to replace them.
The suspension could "last a long time or end next
month," Li said. "The election was an example of a very
gradual and somewhat tentative move towards democ
ratization of Taiwan. It ended," he said.
Timing questioned
Li said he questions the importance for the U.S. of
making the announcement on Dec. 15. "The main
reason that's given is the fear of a leak," he said. "I must
say I just don't understand that as a reason.

"Leaks are our business, not Taiwan's business.
Would Barry Coldwater have complained any more
loudly or effectively if he had known beforehand?," Li
said.
Other sources suggest that the decision was made at
that time to divert attention from the failure of Secretary
of State Cyrus Vance's "shuttle diplomacy," according
to a December issue of Time.
The ideology of both Taiwan and the PRC emphasize
the existence of only one China. Ninety percent of the
Taiwanese legislators represent the mainland and were
last elected in 1947. However, 80 to 85 percent of
Taiwan's 17 million people are native to the island.
The long-term question the Taiwanese people must
consider is how long it will take for the 1947 legislators to
"die off," Li said. Estimates predict the last mainland
representative to die in about 2007, he said.
Taiwan has two courses to choose from: increase the
amount of seats alloted to the island orallow the legisla
ture to become very small. Each course moves toward
democratization of Taiwan's one party government, Li
said.
According to Li, Taiwan is raising the possibility of a
plan called "The German Formula." This allows the Un
ited States to recognize the PRC and its claims, while also
recognizing Taiwan and its claims.
"The dilemma that the Taiwan government is in is that
if it relinquishes its claim to the mainland, how do you
explain the continual holding of power by the 1200
people of the national assembly and the 400 in the na
tional legislature?," Li said. If Taiwan does not relinquish
claims to the mainland, then the U.S. and most of the
world will disagree with Taiwan's claim to the mainland,
he said.
Although Washington is allowing the mutual defense
pact with Taiwan to expire, the United States plans on
continuing selling defensive weaponry to Taiwan, ac
cording to Li. Peking stresses that such selling of arms
would "violate the principles of normalization," he said.
Li concluded, "Taiwan may be a small place, but it isn't
all that tiny, and it is an independent actor. In the sense
of'could westopTaiwan from going nuclearorcould we
stop them from dealing with the Russians,' there we may
have quite a bit of leverage.
"But in terms of domestic internal change, that's
going to happen," he said. "We don't know what direc
tion it's going to take, but something's got to happen."
President ]imniy Carter's move to normalize relations
with the People's Republic of China (PRC) was
applauded by most of the world, but normalization
acted like a bombshell to the people of Taiwan.
Victor Li, professor of law and director of East Asian
'Studies was in Taiwan when normalization was an
nounced.
