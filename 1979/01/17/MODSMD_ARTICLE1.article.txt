# Tearful shah leaves Iran for 'vacation'

### 
Tehran, Iran (AP) — Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi, a weeping king
driven from his kingdom, flew his
royal jet out of Iran yesterday on a
journey from which he may never re
turn.
His departure set off an explosion
of joy by millions of his people. If his
triumphant foes have their way, the
shah's flight means the end of
monarchy in a land ruled by kings for
2 500 years.
jubilant Iranians poured into
Tehran's streets, singing and danc
ing, cheering each other in celebra
tion of victory in the bloody year
long popular struggle against the
man who has ruled their nation since
1941.
The 59-year-old monarch took the
controls himself and piloted his
"Shah's Falcon" Boeing 727 jetliner
into the bright skies over Tehran and
on to Aswan, Egypt, where he was
welcomed by President Anwar Sadat.
He is expected to stay there for a
few dciys before flying on to the Un
ited States for what is officially de
scribed as an "extended vacation."
At Tehran's airport, two royal
guard officers fell tearfully to their
knees to try to kiss the shah's feet as
he neared the plane ramp, an
eyewitness reported.
The monarch — "Shah of Shahs,"
"Center of the Universe," "Shadow
of the Almighty" — left behind shat
tered dreams of glory for his Pahlavi
dynasty and a volatile political
situaton.
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar,
the shah's choice to lead Iran, won
parliamentary approval for his
Cabinet Tuesday. But the powerful
Khomaini, head of the nation's do
minant Shiite sect, has branded the
new, U.S.-backed government "il
legitimate" and vowed to establish
an Islamic republic.
Bakhtiar, a courtly French
educated lawyer and longtime foe of

the shah, had agreed to form a gov
ernment if the monarch left the
country. He allowed the shah to re
main titular head of state, leaving
open the possibility of his eventual
return. A nine-member Regency
Council was formed to act for him in
his absence.
In his farewell message to his 34
million subjects, the shah appealed
for the preservation of the monarchy
and support for the new govern
ment. He also urged revival of the
economy, paralyzed by strikes in oil,
communications and other vital in
dustries.
Speaking to the lower house of
Parliament before it gave him its vote
of confidence Tuesday, Bakhtiar also
vowed that Iran, a big buyer of U.S.
arms "will no longer spend billions
of dollars" to act as the policeman of
the Persian Gulf, protecting Western
oil interests.
In his address to parliament,
Bakhtiar pledged again to dissolve
the hated SAVAK secret police and
said 100 agents had already been
fired.
In Paris, Ayatullah Khomaini,
spiritual leader of Iran's uprising, cal
led the shah's departure a "first
step" and strongly indicated he
would remain in this French city to
work for the downfall of the proxy
government appointed by the
monarch.
"It is not a final victory, but a pre
face to our victory," said Khomaini,
78. Roars of triumph erupted in his
villa when Tehran Radio broadcast
news of the shah's departure.
The bearded, black-robed ayatul
lah said an even more important ob
jective than the shah's departure was
"the end to foreign domination."
Dr. Ibrahim Yazdi, his chief assis
tant, read a statement containing
"congratulations to the heroic
people of Iran" for the year of strikes
and violent demonstrations that led

to the shah's departure.
Khomaini's reaction to the depar
ture and sources close to him made it
clear the exiled leader of Iran's pre
dominant Shiite Moslem sect would
not cooperate with Premier
Shahpour Bakhtiar.
Khomaini said he would return to
Iran "at the first proper time." But
Yazdi said Khomaini would remain in

exile here forsometime — definitely
longer than a few days. He has been
abroad 15 years.
Vazdi said it was "probable" Kho
maini would be an exile as long as
Bakhtiar is in power. The shah has
appointed a regency council to wield
his power while he is away on what
he calls a "vacation" but many see it
as the beginning of a permanent
exile.
A businessman in Neauphle-le-
Chateau, the suburb where Kho
maini has lived for nearly four
months, disclosed the ayatullah'sen
tourage had just extended for three
months the lease of a large tent used
by Khomaini for prayers.
Khomaini aides say the French
government has allowed him to stay
here as long as he wishes.
Yazdi said Khomaini was unwilling
to take any governing role himself,
preferring to give "general gui
dance" to his people.
His aides also disclosed he did not
envisage any members of the Na
tional Front opposition group par
ticipating in a government of his
choice, including its leader, Karim
Sanjaby.
