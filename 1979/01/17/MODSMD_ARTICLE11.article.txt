## U.S.-China barrier dissolving 
### 
The Pacific Ocean is a vast
expanse. Until the recent deci
sion by President Jimmy Car
ter's administration to estab
lish diplomatic relations with
the Chinese government in
Peking, it represented
metaphorically a formidable
barrier between the United
States and the People's Repub
lic of China. Now, a conven
tional line of communication
has been lain across the chasm
â€” a line from which the U.S.
will benefit enormously.
First, it is clear that the rec
ognition of China enhances
the international position of
the United States. We could
not have continued pragmati
cally to ignore the vast military,
economic, and political poten
tial in the hands of the Peking
government.
As a regional force, China
has exhibited its importance.
Its role in the current struggle
between Cambodia and Viet
nam demonstrates its role in
Southeast Asia. Our ally japan
has recognized the great
power which lies to its west.
The japanese, augmenting
their already substantial
economic and political rela
tions with the Chinese, re
cently entered into an agree
ment of friendship with their
neighbor, resulting in another
important manifestation of
Chinese influence in Asia.
On a global level as well,
China has entered with gusto
the struggle for strength and
influence. A permanent
member of the U.N. Security
Council, a possessorof nuclear
weapons, and a holder of an
unmatched reserve of sheer
manpower, China is driving
toward modernization in order
to make itself an even more
important member of the
world community. With the
technological aid of various in
dustrial nations, Premier Teng
Hsiao-p'ing is now concentrat
ing on giving his country the
ability to exploit its mineral
wealth and realize its industrial

potential. The Chinese have
undeniably come into their
own in world affairs.
The frantic, obsessive, al
most mindless devotion of the
Chinese government to thwart
ing Soviet "hegemonism"
perhaps represents most
clearly the value of our new re
lationship. In Africa, the
Chinese have acted to frustrate
the Russians. They aided the
"pro-Western" factions in
volved in the Angolan civil war.
They have lent support, mostly
moral but sometimes tangible,
to other anti-Soviet parties
around the world in an attempt
to limit Russian influence. Re
cent moves to solidify contacts
with Yugoslavia and Romania
indicate further their desire to
tweak the nose of the Russian
bear.
The Chinese, for reasons en
tirely their own, have often
held common ground with the
United States in reacting to
Soviet designs in various parts
of the world. In a strictly
Machiavellian sense, it would
have been foolish for us to con
tinue without full relations
with Peking.
This does not mean that the
establishment of those rela
tions is merely a slap at the
Russians. Other, more sig
nificant considerations promp
ted the decision. Zbigniew
Brzezinski, President )immy
Carter's National Security Ad
visor, says,"The U.S. has a
long-term common strategic
interest in the improvement of
our relationship with the
People's Republic. This is not
motivated by some tactical
'China card.' " The SALT talks
go on, and even Leonid
Brezhnev feels compelled to
call the normalization of rela
tions a "natural" occurrence.
But our action does tell the en
tire world that we recognize
the strategic worth and the
political advantage of our ties
to Peking. No longer will we
slight a nation which we cannot

afford to ignore.
Second, a feast for American
business will follow the estab
lishment of relations. U.S.
trade with mainland China now
amounts to only about $1 bil
lion a year, and a large part of
the Chinese reluctance to ex
pand this commerce has been
related to the lack of official
diplomatic relations. Now,
American businesses will be
able to compete on equal
terms in China with their com
petitors from other industrial
countries. A billion people
should comprise a market for
more than just Coca-Cola.
Other opportunities exist for
American enterprises. W.
Roberts, executive vice
president of Phillips Pet
roleum, has said that the East
China Sea is "one of the largest
unexplored areas left in the
world today," and various
American oil companies have
been negotiating with China
for offshore drilling rights.
However, no deals have yet
been completed. Perhaps now
the way is open for the culmi
nation of those negotiations.
The most serious obstacle to
the normalization of relations
had been the Taiwan question.
The U.S. has decided to termi
nate its diplomatic relations
and mutual defense treaty with
Taipei. Conservatives claim that
this act is an abdication of re
sponsibility and a weakening
of the confidence of our allies
in our willingness to defend
them.
However, our allies have an
ticipated the establishment of
relations with the Peking gov
ernment since President Nix
on's visit in 1972. They had
expected, and some had pub
licly encouraged, us to follow
the pattern set by )apan: the
recognition of Peking and the
concomitant severance of rela
tions withTaipei, accompanied
nevertheless by the mainte
nance of strong economic and
unofficial political ties to
Taiwan. Indeed, President

Carter's decision to recognize
the mainland elicited the
hearty praise of our major allies
in Europe and Asia.
The Taiwan government is
understandably unhappy with
our action. However, we will
continue our extensive
economic and cultural rela
tions with the island.
Moreover, Taiwan faces no
danger of actual invasion. We
retain the right to sell defen
sive weapons to it, and an ac
tual military landing from the
mainland would be impractical
and prohibitively costly for
Peking.
In addition, the Chinese
have assured us that the
reunification of Taiwan and the
mainland foreseen in the 1972
Shanghai communique will be
achieved peacefully and with
out the disruption of Taiwan's
economy. Although this is only
a promise, we should expect
the Chinese to abstain from ac
tions which would imperil their
valuable ties to the U.S. and
the rest of the industrial world.
The well-being of Taiwan has
been protected.
Frankly, the practical reality
of the matter is that two sepa
rate nations exist: China and
Taiwan. But the government of
neither will deign to admit the
fact, and we, in accommoda
tion, must choose one with
which to conduct official rela
tions. Stark realism dictates
that, if there is to be only one
"China," its government is the
one in Peking. President Car
ter's choice was the correct
one.
To the nation, the recogni
tion of China offers political
and economic advantages
which cannot be ignored. The
Pacific Ocean is indeed a broad
one, and it can sometimes ap
pear to be an impassable obs
tacle. But, now, it appears
somewhat less impassable,
and seems just a little less
broad.
