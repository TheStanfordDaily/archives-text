## Separation of church and state 
### 
Everytime we hear about
the decline of Catholic
parochial education, or the
growth of religiously
oriented "white
academies," or the latest
exploits of Madelyn Murray
O'Hair or the ACLU in their
war against school prayer or
Christmas carols, we are
constantly reminded of the
significance of the "separa
tion of church and state."
We also must be aware of
how this policy or that law
suit threatens to either
sharpen or blur the distinc
tion. The purpose of this
column is to point out that
church and state, while not
as monolithically fused as
they once were, are still in a
tight embrace that stifles
human expression and
human creativity.
Both conventional gov
ernment and conventional
religion are hierarchical
bureaucracies that require
their flocks to be obedient.
They require their obedient
flocks to subsidize the
cushy lifestyles of those at
the top. They exact their tri
bute in various ways.
In the old days the church
and state would simply con
fiscate the wealth of the
citizenry by force. Things

have gotten better; nowa
days the church gets its re
venue through donations,
while only the state must
seize a larger and larger
share of the national in
come in order to support its
unpopular ventures in pro
tection and benevolence.
"Donations" to most
churches are not as overtly
coercive, but are still
exacted through peer pres
sure and manipulation of
the believer's fear of the
unknown.
In oursociety, the interre
lationship of these two
power blocs exists at many
levels. Government
regulated radio and TV sta
tions are forced to provide
time for religious broad
casts. Religious luminaries
freely mix with the gov
ernmental elite, offering
valuable endorsements and
even more valuable cam
paign contributions. Most
importantly, while govern
ments at all levels have
hiked taxes to record highs,
religious institutions are
tax-exempt.
While Americans are be
ginning to comprehend the
maxim that the "power to
tax is the power to destroy,"
a maniac like Jim (ones, con

fident of the Bay Area power
structure, was allowed to
build a $26 million tax-free
empire. The marriage of
government and religion is
neatly summarized in our
currency, every piece of
which is emblazoned with
"In God We Trust."
The Universal Life Church
offers an alternative to this
sort of incestuous tyranny.
We believe that people are
inherently thinking, feeling
and compassionate beings,
and that they would be bet
ter off without the sort of
condescension and au
thoritarianism that charac
terizes modern government
The Universal Life Church
believes that there is a
natural law that underlies
everything, and that every
thing has its own nature.
This is not Spencerian social
Darwinism; it is merely the
common-sense observation
that people are most fulfil
led and complete when they
interact voluntarily, and that
the tremendous promise of
human nature is realized
when people are free.
Some things are immuta
ble, whether or not radicals
choose to admit the fact.
Other things are always in a
state of flux, even if conser

vatives pretend otherwise.
The calamities and disas
ters that afflict mankind
come about when the radi
cals try to change every
thing, and/or the conserva
tives try to freeze every
thing. The frustrations that
ensue from such a hopeiess
course of action are the
cause of the sort of nihilism
and irrationality that has
shaped the 20th century and
underlined the necessity of
a decentralized and open
society where zealots and
crazies can tyrannize only
themselves, leaving the vast
majority free from the cap
rices and calculations of
centralized power.
The ULC looks forward to
the day when people will no
longer be viewed by religi
ous and political institutions
as enemies to be extermi
nated, putty to be molded,
or resources to be
exploited, but as equal and
sovereign individuals, all
evolving toward higher
levels of contentment and
achievement in the manner
of their own choosing.
