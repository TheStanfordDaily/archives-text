# Frozen in obscurity
## Card hockey team melts the ice 
### PAUL SPAETH 
It is not surprising that many
Stanford students have never
heard of Stanford's ice hockey
team. After all, most of them
have never even heard of ice
hockey. What is surprising is
that this relatively obscure
team holds one of the best re
cords in Stanford sports.

In three seasons the club has
compiled enviable records of
10-1, 9-2,11-0, the three losses
coming to semi-professional
teams. Last year's undefeated
season was matched only by
the tennis team, yet the club
shunned publicity.
"We don't completely mind
the apathy that peopletfeel to

wards ice hockey," team pres
ident and starting left wing
Henry Dudley said. "This way
we aren't held accountable for
our notorious actions on road
trips."
The hockey club consists of
Stanford students and faculty.
Most of the players are either
midwesterners or eastern pre
ppies. Returning lettermen are
Dudley, Gervin Peters, Dave
Lougee, Gary Panton, lay
Jonston, Mark Cunha, Paul
Spaeth, Gary Farner, Mike
Werner, )ay Quimby, Danny
Schley and Rod McMillan. The
rookies are Bill Mulroy, Dave
Frentzel, Randy Breitenbach,
Larry Morley, Jim Garvin and
John Delmare.
"This year's team isn't as big
or physical as last year's," said
player-coach Pat Baldwin. "But
we're a lot slower."
The hockey season opened
last weekend with a tourna
ment in Squaw Valley. Friday
morning Stanford beat Cal
State Northridge 5-2, with Gary
Farner tallying twice for the
Cards.
In the second game, a con
test marred by fighting and
penalties, Stanford defeated
San Diego State 10-7. "I always
look forward to the San Diego
game," said a bruised Mark
Cunha. "Because I usually
come away looking like a hoc

key player."
lay Johnston, who netted a
hat trick (three goals) in the
second game was not pleased
with the performance. "It was
nice to score some goals for
the team," he said. "But I sort
of wish they hadn't pulled me
away from the crap tables in
Reno. I was just starting to win
some money."
This season's upcoming
hockey schedule features
some exciting games against
Brigham Voung University, San
Diego State, and the San Diego
Cougars, a semi-professional
team, and some unexciting
games agairist UC-Berkeley
and Cal-State Northridge.
Probably all of Stanford's
games will be played away
from home, because its their
home games usually precede
the San Francisco Shamrocks'
games in the Cow Palace. And
the future of the Shamrocks is
bleak, owing to financial dif
ficulties.
"Unless the Shamrocks un
dergo a miraculous recovery,"
Dudley said, ''Our closest
game to Stanford will be at Cal
this weekend. It's too bad
though. I'm sure there are a lot
of students who would enjoy
the privilege of watching us
play. It would be a nice change
from the violence they see in
other sports."
