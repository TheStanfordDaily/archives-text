## Dowhower names Fassel as new receiver coach 
### 
Jim Fassel, highly regarded in college football
circles as a passing expert, was named Stan
ford's receiver coach yesterday. Fassel replaces
Rod Dowhower, who assumed the head coach
ing job last week.
Fassel's football experiences are numerous
and varied, according to Dowhower. "Jim has an
extensive background*relative to the passing
game, beginning as a player in the quarterback
position at the high school, college and pro
levels, and continuing with coaching at the pro
fessional and collegiate levels," Dowhower
said. "We are extremely happy that he is with us,
not only as a football coach, but as a representa
tive of the University."
"It's a great opportunity to be a part of a
school with the background and tradition of
Stanford," the 29-year-old Fassel commented.
"I'm excited about the direction the program
will continue to take under Rod."
Fassel spent the past three seasons at Weber
State College in Ogden, Utah as offensive coor
dinator and quarterback and receiver coach.
Weber State prospered greatly under his
tutelage, finishing second nationally in NCAA
Division-1-AA passing last year. The Wildcats led
the Big Sky Conference in passing, breaking all
league records. The year before, Weber State
placed third in passing.

As an undergraduate, Fassel attended Fuller
ton (Calif.) Junior College and Long Beach State.
He garnered second-team All-PCAA honors as a
quarterback in 1971, his junior year.
After graduating in 1972 Fassel remained at
Fullerton to coach the receivers and quarter
backs in 1973.
Fassel gained pro experience as player-coach
with the Hawaiians of the now-defunct World
Football League.
In 1976 Fassel coached the quarterbacks and
receivers at the Universiy of Utah, where Tom
Lovat, now Stanford's offensive line coach, was
the head mentor.
Meanwhile, up the Peninsula, San Francisco
49er coach Bill Walsh, the erstwhile Cardinal
head man, retained former California coach
Mike White as an assistant on the 49er staff
Monday.
The entire San Francisco coaching corps, in
cluding General Manager Joe Thomas, had been
deposed last week prior to the hiring of Walsh.
Flowever, Walsh has strong regard for White,
stemming from the fact that the two worked
together as assistants first at California and then
Stanford.
White, the Golden Bears' head coach from
1972-77, will continue to survey the49ers' offen
sive line while assuming certain administrative
duties.
