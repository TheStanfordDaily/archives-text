# Ganz speeds for fun
## 
### MARK SCOTT 
Whitney Ganz probably
wishes he could drive his
Porsche 911 T around a race
track. It would go faster than
his racecar does.
Ganz, however, doesn't just
drive at the Malibu Grand Prix
miniature track.
For the past year Ganz, 22, a
University senior, has com
peted in the Formula Ford
amateur division of the Sports
Car Club of America. Although
each car uses a 1600 cc Ford
Cortina engine, they average
speeds of about 200 mph.
In his first year, Ganz
finished second three times,
third twice, fourth once and
fifth once in 12 races.
But he explains, "You just
don't get into the car and go
crazy. If there was any exhilara
tion, you wouldn't make it
around one lap."
To be eligible to race, Ganz
attended Jim Russell's School
of Driving in the Mojave Desert
for a week and had to pass a
weekend of driving tests ad
ministered by the SCCA.
At driving school, he says,
they start drivers from"the be
ginning."
"They explain how to drive
the tracks" and limit the re
volutions per minute drivers
may use, he says.
Including himself, Ganz says
there were 10 new competitors
in his division in 1978. During
the first races, they had to dis
play big x's on their cars so
that experienced drivers knew
to beware.
He was the only new driver
to finish with the front runners
consistently.
Ganz treats his racing as if it
were a business. Indeed, he
aims to make it his business
beginning in June.
He plans to compete in the
Formula Ford division for one
more year and then move to a
higher division.
His goal after that is to enter
the Formula 1 division, which
holds its 16 races a year in 15
different countries.
Ganz says many drivers
begin in the Formula Ford divi
sion because it is the most
competitive. He recalls a race
at Riverside where the top 20
finishers came in within two
seconds of each other.

Because all cars have the
same small engine, "There's
no way you can pull away from
other cars in this division," he
says.
Although amateur formula
races last about 30 minutes
each, Ganz describes them as
grueling.
Drivers must wear a head
sock, three layers of clothes, a
double-layer one-piece driving
suit and a helmet.
During the summer at some
tracks, the track can get to 120
degrees.
"Aftera race,alotof guysget
out of the car, get dizzy and
pass out," he says.
Last year, Ganz crashed in
three consecutive races. He
was never hurt.
"I still don't think about it,"
he says."I laugh at it. That's
just my way of dealing with it."
His worst crash came at a
hairpin turn. He slammed on
his brakes and his brakepads
failed. Instead of turning the
corner sharply, he rammed
head on into the outside wall at
70 mph.
"This year I learned how to
drive fast," Ganz says. "Now
I've got to learn how to race."
He says the two are distinct.
"One will get you third or
fourth and the other will win it
for you."
According to Ganz, it takes a
serious contender, serious in
attitude and results, about
$50,000 a year to compete in his
division.
His sponsors cover expenses
for his car, travel, his two
mechanics and testing.
Every weekend he's not rac
ing, he heads down to Mojave
to test his car. He performs
much of his own mechanic
work because he spent two
years working as a volunteer
pit crewman before he began
driving himself.
At Stanford, he spends his
weeks, he says, "relaxing and
doing as little as possible."
The art history major has all
A's but one in his major.
"I don't think Stanford's that
hard," he says. "I'm gone
every weekend. How hard can
it be?"
Ganz, who grew up in
Brentwood near Los Angeles,
attended Middlebury College
in Vermont for two years be

fore coming to Stanford. Al
though he has played lacrosse
at Stanford and played rugby at
Middlebury, racing is what he
takes seriously
Over winter break, he says
he told some friends, "Well,
that's my last vacation for 20
years."
While racing, Ganz says he
has to be like a computer. He
must be emotionless to be ef
fective.
"The exhilaration comes two
or three hours after a race," he
says.
"All of a sudden a smile will
come across your face and
you'll say, 'Wow, that was
bitchin'."
