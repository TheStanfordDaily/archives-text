Terrorist strongholds stormed
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli commandos stormed
ashore and attacked a Palestinian "terrorist"
stronghold in southern Lebanon early yesterday
and Israeli naval vessels bombarded guerrilla
"concentrations" along the coast, the army said.
The army denied the attack was made in retalia
tion for a Palestinian terrorist raid at Maalot in
northern Israel last Saturday in which an Israeli
woman and all three guerrillas were killed.
The military command in Tel Aviv gave few de
tails of the raid, which took place at Ras el-Ain, 12
miles north of the Israeli border and two miles
south of the Lebanese port city of Tyre.
An army spokesman scoffed at statements is
sued in Beirut by the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation that claimed guerrillas fought a pitched bat
tle with the Israelis and "inflicted heavy casualties
in the enemy ranks."
In Jerusalem, alert passersby were credited with
averting a potential disaster yesterday morning
when they spotted an explosives-packed car
parked on a busy shopping street. Demolition ex
perts defused the bomb and no one was hurt.
Hijacked passengers released
Beirut, Lebanon — Six Moslem hijackers released
all the passengers and crew members of a
Lebanese airliner early today, ending a seven-hour
drama they had staged to protest the disappear
ance of a religious leader.
The hijackers freed the 66 passengers and nine
crew members after their leader told a hastily or
ganized airport news conference that Libya was
responsible for the missing Imam Mousa al-Sadr.
The leader told the news conference that the
54-year-old Imam had been kidnapped in October
by the Libyan regime of Col. Moammar Khaddafy
"in defiance of all international laws." He added,
"It is a crime that will not go unpunished."
The jetliner was refueled at the hijackers' de
mand when it returned here after Cyprus and Tur
key refused to allow it to land. An airport spokes
man said the hijackers had not indicated in their
talks with government officials if they planned to
leave again.
According to the negotiators, the hijackers said
they wanted to publicize the five-month disap
pearance of al-Sadr, leader of the Shiites. It is the
largest Moslem sect in this nation of three million
Moslems and Christians.
The Imam has been missing since he flew to
Libya in October to attend the anniversary celebra
tions of Moammar Khadafy's 1969 coup against the
pro-Western monarchy.
Brown asks Medi-Cal reforms
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown proposed re
forms of California's Medi-Cal and civil service
systems in a conciliatory message yesterday to the
state Legislature.
The Democratic governor also offered an olive
branch to liberals, putting a strong emphasis on
more jobs for the poor and minorities, an end to
discrimination against homosexuals and protec
tion of workers from hazards on the job.
But Brown did not mollify all the liberals in

censed last week at the fiscal conservatism of his
inaugural address, which emphasized cuts in gov
ernment and attacks on federal deficit spending.
He said California's $4 billion-a-year Medi-Cal
program must be reformed to curb escalating
costs. He said cost-containment reforms will "not
be done at the expense of the poor" who rely on
the program for medical care.
The 40-year-old governor also promised an un
specified reform of state and local government
finances, and he made general references to the
need for new housing and for adoption of his
controversial water projects proposal.
The only specific proposal in the jobs area,
where Brown put the greatest emphasis, was a $5
million job training program.
The reaction of many liberal lawmakers to
Brown's renewed emphasis on helping the poor
and disadvantaged was cautious and skeptical.
The audience of more than 100 state senators and
assemblymen reacted with only subdued
applause.
55 dead after midwest storms
Chicago — The nation's midsection, torn by the
worst weather of the winter, began repair opera

55 persons dead.
Efforts in the nation's second largest city cen
tered on O'Hare International Airport, which was
closed for 42 hours and left thousands of stranded
passengers staying at nearby hotels while awaiting

Gov. Otis Bowen of Indiana declared four
northern Indiana counties as a disaster area be
cause of blizzard conditions.
The National Weather Service said more snow
was headed for northern Indiana and southern
Michigan last night and that there was a chance of
more snow in other parts of the midwest.
Heavy snows closed schools and snarled traffic
throughout the midwest.
With more than 20 inches of snow on the ground
in many places and temperatures that set or tied
record lows before the warming trend set in yes
terday, emergencies were declared in parts of
lowa and Kansas. Illinois Gov. James Thompson
declared parts of the state a disaster before head
ing for a Florida vacation with his family.
The storm has caused at least 55 weather-related
deaths.
Pot to help cancer patients
Santa Fe, N.M. — Capsules containing federally
grown marijuana were en route to four cancer
patients yesterday under provisions of a pioneer
ing New Mexico law aimed at easing side effects of
chemotherapy.
The shipment from the National Institute of
Drug Abuse will be the first under New Mexico's
law that legalizes marijuana and its basic chemical
component, THC, for use in cancer treatment re
search.
"There is consistent evidence that marijuana
does inhibit vomiting and facilitates sleep," said
George Goldstein, secretary of the state Health
and Environment Department. "There is some lit
erature indicating that it also relieves pain."

The marijuana is grown under contract in Ox
ford, Miss., and rolled into cigarettes at a research
site in North Carolina.
Goldstein said the choice between capsules or
cigarettes would depend on the personal prefer

to smoke," he said.
The legislature passed the law after a personal
plea from Lynn Pierson of Albuquerque, a 27-

died last August of lung cancer without receiving a
legal supply of marijuana.

Hijacked passengers released
Beirut, Lebanon — Six Moslem hijackers released
all the passengers and crew members of a
Lebanese airliner early today, ending a seven-hour

The hijackers freed the 66 passengers and nine

responsible for the missing Imam Mousa al-Sadr.
The leader told the news conference that the
54-year-old Imam had been kidnapped in October
by the Libyan regime of Col. Moammar Khaddafy
"in defiance of all international laws." He added,
"It is a crime that will not go unpunished."
The jetliner was refueled at the hijackers' de

55 dead after midwest storms
Chicago — The nation's midsection, torn by the
worst weather of the winter, began repair opera

55 persons dead.
Efforts in the nation's second largest city cen

closed for 42 hours and left thousands of stranded
passengers staying at nearby hotels while awaiting
flights.
Gov. Otis Bowen of Indiana declared four
northern Indiana counties as a disaster area be
cause of blizzard conditions.
The National Weather Service said more snow
was headed for northern Indiana and southern
Michigan last night and that there was a chance of
more snow in other parts of the midwest.
Heavy snows closed schools and snarled traffic

Pot to help cancer patients
Santa Fe, N.M. — Capsules containing federally
grown marijuana were en route to four cancer
patients yesterday under provisions of a pioneer
ing New Mexico law aimed at easing side effects of
chemotherapy.
The shipment from the National Institute of
Drug Abuse will be the first under New Mexico's
law that legalizes marijuana and its basic chemical
component, THC, for use in cancer treatment re
search.
"There is consistent evidence that marijuana
does inhibit vomiting and facilitates sleep," said
George Goldstein, secretary of the state Health
and Environment Department. "There is some lit
erature indicating that it also relieves pain."

The marijuana is grown under contract in Ox
ford, Miss., and rolled into cigarettes at a research
site in North Carolina.
Goldstein said the choice between capsules or
cigarettes would depend on the personal prefer
ence of patient and doctor. "Some just don't like
to smoke," he said.
The legislature passed the law after a personal
plea from Lynn Pierson of Albuquerque, a 27-
year-old University of New Mexico student, who
died last August of lung cancer without receiving a
legal supply of marijuana.
Goldstein said he was told by Dr. Edward Tocus
of the Food and Drug Administration that since
New Mexico's law was the first in the nation, it was
being used as a model in coordinating programs in
other states. Similar laws have since been passed
in Florida, Illinois and Louisiana.

Pot to help cancer patients
Santa Fe, N.M. — Capsules containing federally
grown marijuana were en route to four cancer
patients yesterday under provisions of a pioneer
ing New Mexico law aimed at easing side effects of
chemotherapy.
The shipment from the National Institute of
Drug Abuse will be the first under New Mexico's
law that legalizes marijuana and its basic chemical
component, THC, for use in cancer treatment re
search.
"There is consistent evidence that marijuana
does inhibit vomiting and facilitates sleep," said
George Goldstein, secretary of the state Health
and Environment Department. "There is some lit
erature indicating that it also relieves pain."

The marijuana is grown under contract in Ox
ford, Miss., and rolled into cigarettes at a research
site in North Carolina.
Goldstein said the choice between capsules or
cigarettes would depend on the personal prefer
ence of patient and doctor. "Some just don't like
to smoke," he said.
The legislature passed the law after a personal
plea from Lynn Pierson of Albuquerque, a 27-
year-old University of New Mexico student, who
died last August of lung cancer without receiving a
legal supply of marijuana.
Goldstein said he was told by Dr. Edward Tocus
of the Food and Drug Administration that since
New Mexico's law was the first in the nation, it was
being used as a model in coordinating programs in
other states. Similar laws have since been passed
in Florida, Illinois and Louisiana.

Terrorist strongholds stormed
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli commandos stormed
ashore and attacked a Palestinian "terrorist"
stronghold in southern Lebanon early yesterday
and Israeli naval vessels bombarded guerrilla
"concentrations" along the coast, the army said.
The army denied the attack was made in retalia
tion for a Palestinian terrorist raid at Maalot in
northern Israel last Saturday in which an Israeli
woman and all three guerrillas were killed.
The military command in Tel Aviv gave few de
tails of the raid, which took place at Ras el-Ain, 12
miles north of the Israeli border and two miles
south of the Lebanese port city of Tyre.
An army spokesman scoffed at statements is
sued in Beirut by the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation that claimed guerrillas fought a pitched bat
tle with the Israelis and "inflicted heavy casualties
in the enemy ranks."
In Jerusalem, alert passersby were credited with
averting a potential disaster yesterday morning
when they spotted an explosives-packed car
parked on a busy shopping street. Demolition ex
perts defused the bomb and no one was hurt.
Hijacked passengers released
Beirut, Lebanon — Six Moslem hijackers released
all the passengers and crew members of a
Lebanese airliner early today, ending a seven-hour
drama they had staged to protest the disappear
ance of a religious leader.
The hijackers freed the 66 passengers and nine
crew members after their leader told a hastily or
ganized airport news conference that Libya was
responsible for the missing Imam Mousa al-Sadr.
The leader told the news conference that the
54-year-old Imam had been kidnapped in October
by the Libyan regime of Col. Moammar Khaddafy
"in defiance of all international laws." He added,
"It is a crime that will not go unpunished."
The jetliner was refueled at the hijackers' de
mand when it returned here after Cyprus and Tur
key refused to allow it to land. An airport spokes
man said the hijackers had not indicated in their
talks with government officials if they planned to
leave again.
According to the negotiators, the hijackers said
they wanted to publicize the five-month disap
pearance of al-Sadr, leader of the Shiites. It is the
largest Moslem sect in this nation of three million
Moslems and Christians.
The Imam has been missing since he flew to
Libya in October to attend the anniversary celebra
tions of Moammar Khadafy's 1969 coup against the
pro-Western monarchy.
Brown asks Medi-Cal reforms
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown proposed re
forms of California's Medi-Cal and civil service
systems in a conciliatory message yesterday to the
state Legislature.
The Democratic governor also offered an olive
branch to liberals, putting a strong emphasis on
more jobs for the poor and minorities, an end to
discrimination against homosexuals and protec
tion of workers from hazards on the job.
But Brown did not mollify all the liberals in

censed last week at the fiscal conservatism of his
inaugural address, which emphasized cuts in gov
ernment and attacks on federal deficit spending.
He said California's $4 billion-a-year Medi-Cal
program must be reformed to curb escalating
costs. He said cost-containment reforms will "not
be done at the expense of the poor" who rely on
the program for medical care.
The 40-year-old governor also promised an un
specified reform of state and local government
finances, and he made general references to the
need for new housing and for adoption of his
controversial water projects proposal.
The only specific proposal in the jobs area,
where Brown put the greatest emphasis, was a $5
million job training program.
The reaction of many liberal lawmakers to
Brown's renewed emphasis on helping the poor
and disadvantaged was cautious and skeptical.
The audience of more than 100 state senators and
assemblymen reacted with only subdued
applause.

Chicago — The nation's midsection, torn by the
worst weather of the winter, began repair opera
tions yesterday after a snowstorm that left at least
55 persons dead.

in many places and temperatures that set or tied
record lows before the warming trend set in yes
terday, emergencies were declared in parts of
lowa and Kansas. Illinois Gov. James Thompson
declared parts of the state a disaster before head
ing for a Florida vacation with his family.
