Grievance article correction
On lan. 15, the Daily ran an ar
ticle concerning a grievance filed
against the University by Barbara
Honegger, former employee,
which incorrectly stated the change
in the University's grievance policy
took effect "as of Dec. 1." The
change actually took place as of April
5,1978. Also the sweeping statement
made that "grievances can only be
filed after the grievant is no longer a
University employee" only applies to
grievances submitted to an outside
hearing officer or arbitrator. As the
rules exist today only persons who
have been discharged from the Uni
versity are entitled to file a grievance
for arbitration. Thus Barbara Hon
egger under the present system
would not have been able to submit
her grievance to an arbitrator since at
the time of the complaints she was a
University employee. She would,
however, have been able to submit a
grievance through what Robert
Parker, director of personnel, calls
an "internal procedure," which pre
cludes outside arbitration.
