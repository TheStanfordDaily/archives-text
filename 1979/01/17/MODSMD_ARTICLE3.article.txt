# Women warned of breast cancer threat
## 
### SHERYL DAVIS 
First it was Betty Ford and Happy
Rockefeller who told America about
their mastectomies. Then, this year,
television told more about the sub
ject when CBS showed the movie,
First, You Cry.
But for all the public talk about
breast cancer, one University doctor
does not think that women here are
taking the threat seriously enough.
Dr. Peter Nelson, a gynecologist at
Cowell Student Health Center who
sees female students five mornings a
week, said he is surprised at the large
number of women who do not think
breast cancer is their concern.
"Stanford women are intelligent
and there isn't any point in acting
incredulous that they're not check
ing their breasts," he said.
But the woman who thinks it is her
doctor's responsibility to find lumps
during an annual breast examination
is taking a gamble with her life, ac
cording to Nelson.
"The one year between examina
tions could potentially make a life

and death difference," he said, and a
woman's chances for survival in
crease if the cancer is caught early.
"In this day and age of women de
livering their own babies at home
and women doing their own Pap
smears, they should also be able to
do their own breast examinations,"
he said.
Breast Self Examination (BSE) re
ceived wide publicity after Ford 'sand
Rockefeller's mastectomies in 1974.
Television commercials, instruc
tional sessions and pamphlets
helped explain BSE.
Less than 1 percent of all diag
nosed breast cancer occurs in men.
But according to the American
Cancer Society (ACS), 91,000 Ameri
can women will be diagnosed with
breast cancer this year, a figure
which has jumped more than a
thousand in the past three years.
That means one in every 14 women
will develop breast cancer — an un
checked growth of cells — during
her lifetime. Breastcancer, which the
ACS cites as the foremost cancer

among women, will kill 34,000
women this year.
Despite this 34,000 figure, ACS fi
gures show that less than 1/2 of all
women with breast cancer will die
from it. The majority of cases are ar
rested with amputation of the breast
of a combination of surgery and radi
ation or drug treatment.
Too often, however, fear becomes
cancer's friend. It is fear that turns
early cases of breast cancer, which
are more easily treated, into terminal
cases, according to Nelson.
He added that women are afraid of
what they might find if they practice
BSE; and in other instances, if they
practice BSE and do find a lump, they
are afraid to go to their doctor for
further testing to see if the lump is
malignant.
Not all lumps are cancerous. Nel
son said "if a woman finds something
in her breast, it's not necessarily
cancer; in fact, 95 to 99 percent of the
time, it's not cancer. But she needs to
get it further evaluated.
"But if it is cancer," Nelson con
tinued, "catching it early means po
tentially less disfiguring surgery and
a better chance for survival."
David Torin, a doctor at Cowell
said women can come to Cowell on a
walk-in basis if they find a lump in
their breast. Often what the woman
has felt turns out to be the end of a
rib or something like a skin boil. But
in any case, the woman is wise to be
concerned, Torin said.
"If there werea lump in the breast,
we would refer the person to one of
our specialists," Torin said.
The specialists include Nelson and
general surgeons available on a re
ferral basis at the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic (PAMC).
"I look at my role as being that of
an experienced screener," Nelson

said.
Nelson develops a history of the
patient as part of his screening. Age
isonefactorhe considers when look
ing for breast cancer. Most breast
cancer occurs in women between
the ages of 30 and 50, he explained.
"It's not common in women below
30," Nelson said, "but the chance is
still there."
Nelson said he also notes whether
the woman's sister, mother or
grandmother has had breast cancer.
"There's definitely a familial
increase risk," he said. "It is proba
bly only a two-fold increase over the
general population."
Nelson said he also asks a patient if
she is taking any hormonal medica
tion. However, he did not speculate
as to whether the Pill is linked to
breast cancer.
"To date, no one has shown a
clear-cut connection between breast
cancer and the Pill. The problem is,
we don't know. If the risk (of breast
cancer) is increased, it seems to be a
small risk," Nelson said.
Several studies which have re
ceived wide coverage in women's
magazines in the past few years raise
questions about hormones in the
Pill. Some studies suggest they might
stimulate, or feed, an embryonic
breast cancer.
Nelson said he finds arguments on
both sides for the Pill's possible in
volvement in breast cancer plausi
ble.
"It's a controversial issue. Some
say the Pill increases the chance of
cancer two-fold, others say it's de
creased 50 percent by taking the
birth control pill," he said.

The Stanford Outdoor Primate Facility was formerly the home of chimpanzees.
But by spring, after some remodeling has taken place, the site will house rhesus
macaques, to be used for experimental study here.
