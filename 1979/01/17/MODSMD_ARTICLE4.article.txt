# Burciaga quits NWAC over Abzug dismissal
## 
### SUE GOLDFARB 
Cecilia Preciado-Burciaga, assis
tant provost for faculty affairs here,
sent a telegram to President Jimmy
Carter last Friday night, giving notice
of her resignation from the National
Women's Advisory Committee
(NWAC).
"I had no alternative," Burciaga
said yesterday."I chose not to serve
on a committee that existed for the
pleasure of the president."
Burciaga said her resignation was
triggered by Carter's firing of Bella
Abzug, co-chairman of the NWAC.
According to Burciaga, Abzug was
playing the role of a spokesman for
the committee in delivering criticism
to the President.
The committee's main function
was to monitor the progress of the 26
issues voted on at the National Wo
men's Conference in Houston, ac
cording to Burciaga.
"I think the President was taken
aback that we did not only congratu
late him on the ERA, but we went on
to look at domestic affairs," Burciaga
said.
Some of the NWAC's criticisms
were aimed at Carter's anti
inflationary program.
Over half the members of the
committee have taken the same ac
tion Burciaga has — that of resigna
tion.
"The President miscalculated the
unity of the women on the commit
tee. More than half the committee
has resigned, and that proves the ef
fectiveness of women acting in sol
idarity," Burciaga said.
Some of the other women who res
igned from the committee are; Mario
Thomas, the actress, Joyce Miller,

president of the Coalition of Labor
Union Women, and Claire Randall,
director of the National Council of
Churches of Christ.
Burciaga said, "It's clear to me that
the committee is now gutless. I find it
very hard to believe that the women
who remained on the committee will
not find it difficult to talk with Car
ter."
Burciaga said that Carterwants this
issue to die very quickly, but she
added that it's not going to.
"In away, I think he (Carter) did us
a favor. Some women are too satis
fied with a semblance of equity. This
display proves we were backburner
material and Carter was not very
serious in any of his statements to
us," Burciaga said.
As a result of the numerous resig
nations, task forces established by
the committee in health, education
and international issues will not con
tinue. Burciaga said the committee
had begun to meet with legislators
and had been able to have a voice in
legislative enactments, but now that
will not occur.
On Saturday, after Burciaga had
resigned, she was contacted by Sarah
Weddington, assistant to the presi
dent for women's affairs. Burciaga
said she was asked whether she was
willing to have a separate meeting
with the president to get his view on
the NWAC resignatons.
"I would be amenable to having
that kind of meeting," Burciaga said.
"But I haven't heard anything more
about it yet. The ball is in the presi
dent's court. We've resigned. We're
waiting for what the president is
going to do."
