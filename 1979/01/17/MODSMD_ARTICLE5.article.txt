# U.S. root of Iranian ills
## 
### SUSAN ESSOYAN 
Iranian students here agree that
U.S. intervention in Iran is at the root
of the political turmoil there and
that, if left to themselves, Iranians
would eventually be able to work
things out.
Although the shah's departure last
night from Iran is a positive step, the
new civilian government led by
Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar,
which the shah left behind, can be
only transitional, they said.
None of the students contacted
randomly by the Daily supported the
shah.
The students agreed that Bakht
iar's government can't last because it
lacks the support of the people, but
the students were divided on what
alternative government they consi
dered best for Iran.
Support of exiled Muslim leader
Ayatullah Khomaini is crucial for any
government because only he has
grassroots support, one Iranian,
Saeed Kadivar said.
Kadivar, formerly with the Iranian
government Planning and Budget
Organization just completed his
Ph.D. in civil engineering here.
Khomeini, whose persistent op
position to the shah brought him
tremendous popular support, is cal
ling for an Islamic Republic. Al
though the concept of an Islamic Re
public has not been defined (beyond
the goals of ending foreign interven
tion and the shah's dynasty), Kadivar
said it must be given a chance.
Whether such a republic would
last depends on the amount of
democratic reform it would institute,
Kadivar said.
Students agreed that the transi
tional government should hold a re
ferendum to decide Iran's future
government.
SLAC Prof. Pierre Noyes, a
member of the U.S. People's Com
mittee on Iran (USPCI), agreed that
the Bakhtiar government must give

way to "something more in line with
what 10,000 people have been dying
for."
He said it is critical for Americans
to see to it that their government
does not interfere because the Ira
nian people "want to run their own
affairs, and they have shown that
they can remove foreign interven
tion."
One Iranian graduate student who
requested anonymity said he would
like to see a constitutional democ
racy, rather than an Islamic Republic,
installed in Iran. But he said he be
lieves that "if that is what the people
choose, khomaini would accept it."
Kadivar said that Americans are
unduly worried over the turmoil in
Iran. Division of opinion in Iran is
"only natural," he said. "Thirty-five
million people expressing different
points of view is the true nature of a
democracy," he added.
The American media has been un
fair in its coverage of the Iranian situ
ation because press reports from the
country were strictly controlled by
the government, according to
Noyes.
"Foreign correspondents could be
thrown out of the country on 24-hour
notice if they wrote something the
government didn't like," he said.
Most students said all they ask of
Americans is understanding.
"Americans must note that the up
rising of Iranians has been for free
dom," one graduate student said.
Students disagreed on whether
the average American citizen can af
fect foreign policy. However, they
advocated better education of the
American public on Iranian issues,
particularly since the United States
has been directly involved.
A conference on "The Iranian
Crisis and U.S. Policy" will be held
tonight in Memorial Auditorium to
help inform the community on the
U.S. role in Iran, according to Politi
cal Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier
who will moderate part of the prog
ram.
Speakers will include Kadivar, visit
ing lecturer Noam Chomsky,
Thomas Ricks — the national coor
dinator of USPCI — and Kenneth
Hansen, international consultant for
Asian Development Corporation.

to see to it that their government
does not interfere because the Ira
nian people "want to run their own
affairs, and they have shown that
they can remove foreign interven
tion."
One Iranian graduate student who
requested anonymity said he would
like to see a constitutional democ
racy, rather than an Islamic Republic,
installed in Iran. But he said he be
lieves that "if that is what the people
choose, khomaini would accept it."
Kadivar said that Americans are
unduly worried over the turmoil in
Iran. Division of opinion in Iran is
"only natural," he said. "Thirty-five
million people expressing different
points of view is the true nature of a
democracy," he added.
The American media has been un
fair in its coverage of the Iranian situ
ation because press reports from the
country were strictly controlled by
the government, according to
Noyes.
"Foreign correspondents could be
thrown out of the country on 24-hour
notice if they wrote something the
government didn't like," he said.
Most students said all they ask of
Americans is understanding.
"Americans must note that the up
rising of Iranians has been for free
dom," one graduate student said.
Students disagreed on whether
the average American citizen can af
fect foreign policy. However, they
advocated better education of the
American public on Iranian issues,
particularly since the United States
has been directly involved.
A conference on "The Iranian
Crisis and U.S. Policy" will be held
tonight in Memorial Auditorium to
help inform the community on the
U.S. role in Iran, according to Politi
cal Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier
who will moderate part of the prog
ram.
Speakers will include Kadivar, visit
ing lecturer Noam Chomsky,
Thomas Ricks — the national coor
dinator of USPCI — and Kenneth
Hansen, international consultant for
Asian Development Corporation.
