# Rhesus macaques replace chimps at SOPF
## 
### SUE GOLDFARB 
Chimps from the Stanford Outdoor Primate
Facility (SOPF) moved to their new home at the
University of Texas on Jan. 11.
The move marks the end of a behavioral study
initiated here by )ane Goodall in 1974. She and
former Director of SOPF David Hamburg began
the study to observe chimpanzees here and in the
wild — at Goodall's research center at the Gombe
Stream Reserve in Tanzania.
But in May of 1975, four Stanford researchers
were kidnapped from the Gombe site by Zaire
guerillas. Although they were later'released un
harmed, the danger at the Gombe site remained,
and Stanford severed its association with
Goodall's Tanzanian center.
The loss of the Gombe center prevented com
parison of chimpanzee behavior in captivity and in
the wild.
"Although we have made considerable progress
and have produced data that are interesting in
terms of understanding chimpanzee behavior, we
believe that in the future the program will have

diminishing returns," said Dr. Seymour Levine,
current director of SOPF.
Levine said he plans to use the chimps' vacated
facility to study rhesus macaques. Although
somewhat glum at the prospect of losing the
chimps, Levine said, "You reach a certain point in
all research. The next step for us is four to five
years down the line. That involves a long-term
commitment, and there are no funds available."
"If we could have kept the project going, we
would have, but the problems were insurmounta
ble, said Christopher Coe, field director of the
primate facility here. "Chimps breed very slowly
and we couldn't add more chimps due to the re
stricted size of the facility. It would take nearly a
decade to get a fair sample for a mother-infant
study, and that would cost nearly a million dollars.
I personally don't think the cost benefit would be
worth that amount of money."
Although Goodall urged that some of the space
at SOPF be allocated to graduate student Penny
Patterson, who is conducting language studies
with gorillas here, Levine is reluctant to oblige.

"For the kind of work Penny is doing, she needs a
facility specifically designed for her. She is proba
bly better off on campus, near the computers, and
would be better off redesigning the facility she
has," Levine said.
Levine said he favors rhesus macaques for the
facility because they are widely used in research
and background information is available. He
added that the facility is like their natural habitat so
no other facility would be needed.
"The project with the rhesus macaques will be
experimentation, not observation," Levine said.
"Itwould not be wrong to use a different kindof
monkey, but money is available for the breeding
of rhesus macaques so we are using them," Coe
said.
Rhesus macaques breed and develop faster than
chimpanzees and are more suitable for
biobehavioral research.
According to Levine, the rhesus macaques are
on campus and will move to SOPF in several
months, after some remodeling is done to ac
comodate the smaller animals at the facility.
