# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Lise Giraud Misdirected outrage 
### 
A stream of moral outrage poured forth from
government and media recently — condemning
the Iranian students who protested the presence
of the shah's family in Beverly Hills. All decried
the violence, and indeed, on our TV screens, in
living color, were burning bushes and a car.
I like both cars and bushes and hate to see
either of them burn. Still, to condemn their de
struction as violence when it takes place in pro
test against a violence so enormous and so per
vasive as to forbid all comparison is a vicious and
purposeful distortion of the context. It is sad
that still so many people harbor a deeper hostil
ity toward student protesters than against the
ghastly deeds they protest against. Even the
events of Vietnam, with which this situation has
many parallels, have not mellowed the cry for
the protesters' blood.
Some aimed cheap shots at students acting
from the "safety" of this country's shelter. That
sort of accusation is apt to be leveled by people
who have never protested anything more than
the weather, and they may not therefore know
that protest is seldom all that "safe."
A year or so back some Nazis opened a
bookstore in San Francisco and were promptly
trashed by some Jewish victims of Nazi persecu
tion. The local attorney general's office refused
to press charges, calling the incident "a justified
reaction."
Such understanding was absent from our
government's attitude, which ranged from
genuine stupidity to genuine hypocrisy. Attor
ney General Griffin Bell likened the Iranian stu
dents to the Ku Klux Klan, because both have
worn hoods. A man who can't tell the difference
between the two should probably confine him
self to chasing ambulances as an occupation
more suited to his stature and perceptions.
But it was President Jimmy Carter, his eyes on
God, his heart on human rights and his mind on
the Trilateral Commission, of which he is a
member in good standing, who sent down the
order for deportation.
He had been reported to have been briefly
miffed at the CIA for not telling him — for our tax
billions — what he could have learned free of
charge long ago from innumerable other
sources — namely, that the shah was not as
popular in his own country as he was in
Washington and the board rooms of Grumman
Aircraft, General Dynamics, Atlantic Richfield,
or, for that matter, Stanford University, which
sold him a million dollars worth of communica
tions satellite technology.
The media gave us shouting students and
burning shrubbery. But they did not give equal
time to pictures of some of SAVAK's tens of
thousands of prisoners burned by being in
serted into red-hot metal grills, nor to people
being wire-whipped for hours or having their
fingernails extracted while locked into a metal
hood so that the reverberation of their own
screams would exacerbate the torture.
This too, like arms and high technology, is our
export to Iran. The ClA'schief Iran analyst in the
early '70s told The New York Times (Jan. 8) that

the CIA itself instructed SAVAK in how to tor
ture, in "seminars based on German torture
techniques from World War II." The U.S. Con
sul in Tehran recently told a visiting lawyer:
"The shah has done some things that would
make Hitler seem like Mary Poppins."
The media, cosily intertwined with govern
ment and big business, have not been hammer
ing home to us that aspect of our progressive
ally, the shah.
What we did get in the press was fulsome
drivel about "the beleaguered mother and sister
of the troubled shah" — two frail dears caught
innocently in a crossfire not of their making. At
the very least, these two have, for the last quar
ter century, profited hugely from the depreda
tions the shah has wought on his people.
His mother, who has attained the venerable
age of 90 in a country whose average life expec
tancy is less than half of that, eased her road of
travail from the Beverly Hills mansion to the
Annenberg estate via an entire floor of 33 rooms
of the airport Hilton, accompanied by a flock of
exotic birds and 90 pieces of luggage. In Iran,
2/3 of the population do not even have water in
their houses, of which half are one-room
hovels, and 93 percent of rural women are illit
erate.
Not all the royal luggage, though, is made up
of Valentino wardrobes and Cartier jewels. The
shah'sother sister, Princess Ashraf, was stopped
at Paris' Orly Airport some years back with a
suitcase full of heroin. Being royalty and thereby
entitled to diplomatic immunity, she could not
be touched and has, for years, eked out her
lavish living with a very profitable drug business.
(Bulletin of the ISA, March 1, 1976).
All this makes the shah's family front-line sol
diers in this battle, and it is quite fair that they be
treated as such.
It is they, and not their opponents, who
should be deported. This country has become
moreand more, not the havenofthe oppressed,
but of the oppressor. The U.S. government is
firmly committed to upholding some of the dir
tiest regimes in all creation as long as they "stem
thetideofcommunism"and national liberation.
As these regimes come a cropper, this country
gets the offal of their disintegration — Battista
Cubans, the corrupt elite of South Vietnam and
now Iranians fleeing their just deserts in their
own country.
In justice, the Iranian rulers should be exe
cuted as war criminals who have waged war
upon their own people. However, most super
criminals do not even go to jail. They go to ski
resorts. The least we can hope for is that they do
not go to ours. The Palo Alto Times has
editorialized that incidents like the one in Be
verly Hills may make the United States less at
tractive as a refuge for the shah. For their con
tribution to that, even if for nothing else, the
Beverly Hills protesters should be awarded a
medal. But given this country's touching con
cern for human rights and abhorrence of vio
lence, they may have to wait for history to confer
it upon them.

self to chasing ambulances as an occupation
more suited to his stature and perceptions.
But it was President Jimmy Carter, his eyes on
God, his heart on human rights and his mind on
the Trilateral Commission, of which he is a
member in good standing, who sent down the
order for deportation.
He had been reported to have been briefly
miffed at the CIA for not telling him — for our tax
billions — what he could have learned free of
charge long ago from innumerable other
sources — namely, that the shah was not as
popular in his own country as he was in
Washington and the board rooms of Grumman
Aircraft, General Dynamics, Atlantic Richfield,
or, for that matter, Stanford University, which
sold him a million dollars worth of communica
tions satellite technology.
The media gave us shouting students and
burning shrubbery. But they did not give equal
time to pictures of some of SAVAK's tens of
thousands of prisoners burned by being in
serted into red-hot metal grills, nor to people
being wire-whipped for hours or having their
fingernails extracted while locked into a metal
hood so that the reverberation of their own
screams would exacerbate the torture.
This too, like arms and high technology, is our
export to Iran. The ClA'schief Iran analyst in the
early '70s told The New York Times (Jan. 8) that

the CIA itself instructed SAVAK in how to tor
ture, in "seminars based on German torture
techniques from World War II." The U.S. Con
sul in Tehran recently told a visiting lawyer:
"The shah has done some things that would
make Hitler seem like Mary Poppins."
The media, cosily intertwined with govern
ment and big business, have not been hammer
ing home to us that aspect of our progressive
ally, the shah.
What we did get in the press was fulsome
drivel about "the beleaguered mother and sister
of the troubled shah" — two frail dears caught
innocently in a crossfire not of their making. At
the very least, these two have, for the last quar
ter century, profited hugely from the depreda
tions the shah has wought on his people.
His mother, who has attained the venerable
age of 90 in a country whose average life expec
tancy is less than half of that, eased her road of
travail from the Beverly Hills mansion to the
Annenberg estate via an entire floor of 33 rooms
of the airport Hilton, accompanied by a flock of
exotic birds and 90 pieces of luggage. In Iran,
2/3 of the population do not even have water in
their houses, of which half are one-room
hovels, and 93 percent of rural women are illit
erate.
Not all the royal luggage, though, is made up
of Valentino wardrobes and Cartier jewels. The
shah'sother sister, Princess Ashraf, was stopped
at Paris' Orly Airport some years back with a
suitcase full of heroin. Being royalty and thereby
entitled to diplomatic immunity, she could not
be touched and has, for years, eked out her
lavish living with a very profitable drug business.
(Bulletin of the ISA, March 1, 1976).
All this makes the shah's family front-line sol
diers in this battle, and it is quite fair that they be
treated as such.
It is they, and not their opponents, who
should be deported. This country has become
moreand more, not the havenofthe oppressed,
but of the oppressor. The U.S. government is
firmly committed to upholding some of the dir
tiest regimes in all creation as long as they "stem
thetideofcommunism"and national liberation.
As these regimes come a cropper, this country
gets the offal of their disintegration — Battista
Cubans, the corrupt elite of South Vietnam and
now Iranians fleeing their just deserts in their
own country.
In justice, the Iranian rulers should be exe
cuted as war criminals who have waged war
upon their own people. However, most super
criminals do not even go to jail. They go to ski
resorts. The least we can hope for is that they do
not go to ours. The Palo Alto Times has
editorialized that incidents like the one in Be
verly Hills may make the United States less at
tractive as a refuge for the shah. For their con
tribution to that, even if for nothing else, the
Beverly Hills protesters should be awarded a
medal. But given this country's touching con
cern for human rights and abhorrence of vio
lence, they may have to wait for history to confer
it upon them.

A stream of moral outrage poured forth from
government and media recently — condemning
the Iranian students who protested the presence
of the shah's family in Beverly Hills. All decried
the violence, and indeed, on our TV screens, in
living color, were burning bushes and a car.
I like both cars and bushes and hate to see
either of them burn. Still, to condemn their de
struction as violence when it takes place in pro
test against a violence so enormous and so per
vasive as to forbid all comparison is a vicious and
purposeful distortion of the context. It is sad
that still so many people harbor a deeper hostil
ity toward student protesters than against the
ghastly deeds they protest against. Even the
events of Vietnam, with which this situation has
many parallels, have not mellowed the cry for
the protesters' blood.
Some aimed cheap shots at students acting
from the "safety" of this country's shelter. That
sort of accusation is apt to be leveled by people
who have never protested anything more than
the weather, and they may not therefore know
that protest is seldom all that "safe."
A year or so back some Nazis opened a
bookstore in San Francisco and were promptly
trashed by some Jewish victims of Nazi persecu
tion. The local attorney general's office refused
to press charges, calling the incident "a justified
reaction."
Such understanding was absent from our
government's attitude, which ranged from
genuine stupidity to genuine hypocrisy. Attor
ney General Griffin Bell likened the Iranian stu
dents to the Ku Klux Klan, because both have
worn hoods. A man who can't tell the difference
between the two should probably confine him
self to chasing ambulances as an occupation
more suited to his stature and perceptions.
