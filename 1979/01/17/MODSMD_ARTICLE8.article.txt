Not realistic
The assertion by David Miller
in his column (Daily, Jan. 10)
that . . both justice and
realism demand that the state
of Israel as presently consti
tuted . . . must cease to exist,"
deserves comment. He seems
to envisage some sort of ideal
world state in which people of
any ethnic group could live
wherever they wished, without
interference. Wonderful! I
suggest that a bit of reflection
onworld history will reveal that
"justice" for lews has been
largely nonexistent, and that
the "realism" of )ewish life for
some, such as those in the
Soviet Union, remains gov
erned by the axiom: We had
better watch out for ourselves,
because nobody else will. If
this sounds paranoid, so be it.
The knowledge that about one
third of world Jewry was ex

terminated by the Nazis jus
tifies a bit of paranoia.
Miller completely rejects the
linkage of "ethnicity and
state." Reality shows that this
linkage often, if not always,
exists, and that separatist
movements commonly involve
a yearning to preserve ethnic
ity of a minority, as in Quebec.
I agree with Miller that the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is
the principal cause of trouble
in the Mideast. Unlike him, I
don't have the dream of a Uto
pian, secular state of Palestine
(or whatever name he wishes
to assign it). I suggest that the
preservation of Israel and the
establishment of a Palestinian
state that will protect the
ethnic heritage of the Palesti
nian people is the best solution
to the conflict.

Institutional
disgrace
After reading the article on
the deplorable state of affairs at
the Graduate School of Busi
ness (Daily, Jan. 10), which is
certainly not unique, the most
obvious remedy for minimiz
ing litter and the costs for re
moving it from lounges, com
mon rooms, libraries, etc., is
for each and every individual
on campus to assume respon
sibility for cleaning up and dis
posing of his/her own litter —
the empty drink cans and bot
tles, food wrappers, newspap
ers, etc.
This requires no special ef
fort— just depositing the items
in the trash cans or recycling
bins existing in and around
public rooms. Unfortunately
the majority of the current
campus population seem to be
completely immune to con
cern about personal litter. It
seems so much easier to gripe
about the poor custodial ser
vices than to pick up a piece of
trash and put it in the was
tebasket. We have no one to
blame but ourselves for the
high cost and poor quality
janitorial service when these
people have to spend so much
time cleaning up our litter that
there is no time left to do the
routine housecleaning which
they are contracted to do.
The treatment of furniture
and carpeting in public rooms
around the campus is a dis
grace for an institution of cul
ture and higher learning, and
especially in a private institu
tion of higher learning purport
ing to have an "elite" popula
tion. I have seen better in
tenements!
The GSB is not the only
building on campus either
where the heating and air con
ditioning goes awry regularly.
The Durand Space Engineering
Building was permanently
afflicted before the first occup
ants moved in. I only hope
University engineers were not
involved!
