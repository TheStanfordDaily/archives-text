# Minority grad enrollment down 22% last five years
## 
### ROBERT REED 
Minority graduate student enrollment
here has declined significantly during the
last five years, according to enrollment fi
gures.
Despite President Richard Lyman's pledge
that "ethnic diversity is an absolute re
quirement for genuinely strong quality" in a
university, overall minority grad student en
rollment here has suffered a 22 percent drop
since 1973-74, down from 494 (10.4 percent
of total graduate enrollment) to 38.} (7.4 per
cent).
During this same period, minority under
graduate enrollment has steadily increased.

News analysis

While admitting that he did not know
exactly what has caused this decline, Lyman
said, "The most plausible explanation, al
though I've not seen it documented, is that
there are too many attractive opportunities
for immediate employment right out of col
lege to make graduate study very enticing to
minority students."
Lyman said this decline has been happen
ing "not just here, but everywhere."
"The job market in academic life is simply
not that good," said Fred Hargadon, dean of
undergraduate admissions, explaining what

he thought might be a cause of minority
enrollment decline.
Lyman agreed saying that, "gettinga Ph.D.
in some fields may make you less employ
able."
Engineering
Hargadon also cited as a possible reason
for the decline the fact that more minority
students are going into engineering.
"Companies want to build diversity," said
Hargadon. In addition, most companies
train their employees, he said.
However, these are just a few of the
reasons. Judy Little, associate dean of
graduate studies, has others.
In addition to job situation, Little said that
less availability of funds for grad students,
tougher admission standards, an increase in
institutions admitting graduates, and an in
crease in the number of students going to
professional schools, have contributed to
decreased minority graduate enrollment
here.
General schools
The trend of decline has been limited to
the general graduate schools and not the
professional schools, Little said. Both the
Business and Medical schools have experi
enced substantial increases, while the Law
School has remained stable.
Twenty students entering the Law School
in September 1978 were minorities.
One of the problems with minority admis
sions at the Law School is that of admissions

criteria. According to a letter sent out re
cently by the school to prospective minority
applicants the median grade point average
(CPA) for minorities admitted in 1976 was
3.56, while the median LSAT score was 660.
National survey
One nationwide survey, conducted by
Lorenzo Morris, a researcher at Howard
University, showed that in 1977 there were
only eight black law school candidates in the
country that had at least a 3.5 CPA and 660
LSAT score.
"I think a lot of minority students are dis
couraged from coming to Stanford," said
Lynn Burbridge, president of the Black
Graduate Student Union. The University's
atmosphere as well as the financial problems
of many minority students keep students
away, she said.
According to Diane Burbie, president of
the Stanford chapter of the NAACP, a
"reasonable percentage" of minority stu
dents and faculty at the University's
graduate schools would help minorities feel
more comfortable about applying here.
Too much risk
Burbridge said that graduate admissions
officers "don't want to take the risk" on
minority students who did not score com
paratively high on standardized tests.
Burbridge said she was also upset that
many of the minorities that are accepted into
the University's grad schools come from
"white" schools like Stanford, and not from
many of the black colleges in the South and

East.
"A different approach needs to be taken
towards recruitment," said.Burbridge.
That different approach is being taken.
Recruiting effort
LaDoris Cornell, associate dean for stu
dents affairs at the Law school, made a major
recruiting effort earlier this year throughout
thecountry. She informed students, particu
larly those in small colleges in the South and
East, about the University- Cordell said she
felt that if more minorities were informed
"realistically" about the University, more
would apply, and consequently, more
would be admitted.
In 1978, 49 minority students were admit
ted to the Law school while 20 actually enrol
led. The University's first black law student
graduated in 1968, while its first Chicano
student graduated in 1969.
New recruitment efforts have also been
investigated and implemented in the
Graduate Studies Office. These efforts in
clude a name exchange program between
current students and applicants on a
nationwide level. This would provide pros
pective students a greater picture of what
the University has to offer.
Motivation key
Lyman said he believes the key to ending
decreased minority enrollment is "to keep
motivation fresh and strong," and not be
bogged down in paperwork. He said ad
ministrators should not simply try to satisfy
government standards, but must sustain a

"more energetic effort."
"The NAACP is not satisfied," Burbie said,
explaining that the NAACP can not merely
have Lyman "lamenting" existing problems.
She said that some action must be taken.
Melanie Reeves, chairman of the Black
Caucus, concurred, saying that "drastic
measures" must be taken to improve this
situation.
"Money has to be made available. That's
crucial," said Burbridge.
Money a problem
Money is a key issue in this problem.
According to Lyman, many minority stu
dents, already plagued with the problem of
debt, are also trying to provide support for
their families. They are "faced with the ques
tion of getting a job or going to graduate
school."
Minority students are "more likely to feel
the need to get employed and start earning a
paycheck," Lyman said.
Programs offering money for minorities
are being implemented. These include a
"Fellowship Incentive" program, which
grants an increase in fellowship money to
those departments successful in recruiting
minorities.
Other programs include "The Graduate/
Professional Opportunities Program," a
government-funded program offered to
only 60 schools in the nation and the "Sloan
Foundation Scholarships," which offer fi
nancial aid to minority engineering stu
dents.
