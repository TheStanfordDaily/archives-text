## Miller ignored history 
### 
I think it demonstrates rather
poor taste for David Miller to
publicly express opinions on
topics he knows nothing ab
out. The Middle East seems
such a subject based on his
column (Daily, )an. 10). The
pressure involved in writing a
biweekly column must be se
vere, but he really should make
an effort to choose topics with
which he is remotely ac
quainted.
Miller's ideas on the Middle
East could only come from
complete ignorance about the
history of the situation. Briefly,
he attributes the existence of
Israel to the "virus of perverted
nationalism." He claims that
the "root" of the situation is
the conflict between the Is
raelisand Palestinians, and that
the only way to resolve the
conflict is to replace Israel with
a secular state for Jews and
Arabs.
In the first argument, that
the desire for a Jewish state is
the result of obsolete or inap
propriate nationalism, Miller
has confused the cause with
the effect.
During 2000 years of exile,
lews were harshly persecuted
in virtually every nation in
which they were allowed to
live. In the late I9th and early
20th centuries, persecution in
Europe reached new levels of
brutality, and Jews realized
that the only way to escape
persecution once and for all
was to form a nation of their
own. This is the source of
Zionism.
While sometimes less severe
than persecution in Europe,
both before and after the crea
tion of Israel, Arab treatment of
Jews has been strongly racist.
(Arab treatment of other
minorities such as blacks,
Kurds and Christians has been
perhaps even more brutal, but
that is another story.)
Since the Middle Ages, Jews
living in Arab countries have
been harrassed by Islamic reg
ulations and treated as
second-class citizens. In the
19th century hundreds of Jews
were killed in riots in Syria,
Morocco and Tunis, and in the
1930s and '40s hundreds of
Jews were killed in Palestine in
riots instigated by the Nazi
Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.
Before the birth of Israel in
1948, Jews were murdered in
riots in Egypt, Libya, Iraq and
Yemen. When Israel was
formed, 800,000 Jews were ex
pelled from Arab countries
after having their property con
fiscated, and the few remain
ing face harsh government op
pression.
In most Arab countries, Jews
must register and carry special
identification, and they are
subject to special laws restrict

ing their occupation and resi
dence.
In 1967, the Jews in Egypt had
their property confiscated and
were imprisoned. In Libya,
Jews were murdered in riots,
and the rest lost their property
and were herded into refugee
camps. In Iraq, 19 Jews were
arrested on trumped-up
treason charges and publicly
hanged. In most Arab coun
tries Islam is the state religion
and worship by Jews is severely
restricted.
While Arabs like to claim that
their fight is with "Zionists"
and that they have no pre
judice against Jews, Arabs
persecuted Jews long before
the beginning of Zionism, and
Arabs continue to oppress
lews who are in no way con
nected with Israel. Thus, it
would be far more to the point
for Miller to call for the Arab
nations to stop their persecu
tions of Jews, to renounce
Islam as their state religion,
and to replace their present
governments (all of which are
dictatorships of one kind or
another) with democracies in
which Jews can participate.
This would be a gesture of
good faith on the part of the
Arabs to show that lews can
live safely with an Arab major
ity.
If this proposal sounds
ridiculous or unrealistic, how
much more foolish must Mil
ler's plan be, when it calls for
the same concessions from the
victim of persecution instead
of the persecutor?
The second argument is that
the root of the problem is the
conflict between the Palesti
nians and the lews. While this
aspect has been emphasized in
Arab propaganda, a look at the
history of the conflict shows
again that this is an effect and
not a cause.
The U.N. plan to partition
Palestine in 1948 not only pro
vided for a Palestinian state,
but also specified that any Arab
who chosisto live in the lewish
state was to be a full citizen.
The claim that the lews would
have deprived the Palestinians
of their land is entirely false.
The Arab response to this
solution was unequivocal. The
secretary of the Arab league,
Azzam Pasha, said in Cairo,
"This will be a war of extermi
nation and momentous mas
sacre which will be spoken of
like the Mongolian massacres
and the Crusades." The key
point here is that Israel was an
abomination to the Arabs, not
because it injured the Palesti
nians, but because it was a
Jewish state. The notion that
the Arabs' attempt at mass
murder was in the cause of jus
tice for the Palestinians is
ridiculous.

Noris it supported by further
developments. When the
Arabs lost the war, most of the
Palestinian state remained
under Arab control. Yet, in
stead of establishing a Palesti
nian state, the territory was an
nexed by Egypt and Jordan,
and the homeless Palestinians
were herded into refugee
camps. Since then, the treat
ment of the Palestinians in the
refugee camps, the expulsion
of Palestinians from Jordan,
and the attack by Syria of the
Palestinians in Lebanon pro
vide ample evidence of the ex
tremes the Arab nations are
willing to go to in order to pro
tect the rights of the Palesti
nians.
Miller's conclusion is that
theonly solution to the conflict
is to replace Israel with a secu
lar state for Arabs and Jews.
Clearly, this places the respon
sibility for the crime with the
victim instead of ihe criminal.
It would also place the Jews at
the mercy of an Arab majority
so that they could be subjected
to the racist policies prevalent
throughout the rest of the Arab
world.
This may seem like a just sol
ution to Miller, but I can hardly
blame the Israelis if they defer.
