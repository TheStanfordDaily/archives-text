## Four questions about Soviet power 
### 
In his role as director of policy
studies for the Committee on the Pre
sent Danger, Paul Nitze is one of the
principal spokesmen for reactionary
America. He recently warned that "un
less we take urgent measures at once to
reverse current trends, the Russians in
a few years' time will have the capability
to fight a nuclearwar — and towin such
a war in the military sense of ending up
in undisputed command of the
battlefield and being in a position to
dictate the peace."
George Will writes a column for
Newsweek. Not too long ago he asked
whether it is fair to view Soviet leaders
as "a terrible and forbidding group of
men." His answer: "The rivers of
blood, and mountains of other evi
dence, constantly expanding, confirm
this view. The system presupposes and
produces coarse, cruel leaders."
Listening to the current debate in
Congress, one would think that the
ghost of Sen. )oe McCarthy was not
only Ronald Reagan's campaign man
ager, but also chairman of the Republi
can Caucus.
Nitze, Will, Reagan and others would
have us believe not only that the Rus
sians are coming, but that they have
landed on Long Island and are driving
to the heartland.
To a certain extent, extreme political
rhetoric is taken for granted by the
American public. My fear is that on the
threshold of the Senate debate over
ratification of the SALT II treaty, the
American people are uncritically ac
cepting the simplistic and inflated
analysis of Soviet capabilities and inten
tions that the American Right provides.
I find it illuminating to re-evaluate my
existing perceptions»and to try to ans
wer four basic questions on the nature
of Soviet power.
— Is the Soviet Union a superpower ?
At first glance we might say yes. But
on a closer look we are led to ask: can it
really be a superpower when it doesn't

even have a system of decent roads,
when technological innovation and
economic standards are clearly inferior
to those of the West, when Soviet cur
rency is worthless outside its borders,
when the world economy is controlled
by its adversaries?
It is more of an empire than a super
power, for its economy is carefully in
tertwined with those of its satellites in
Eastern Europe. But if it is a super
power, then it is one characterized by
severely uneven development.
— Is the Soviet Union a military power ?
Certainly. But it is essential to note
that it achieved that status through a
huge concentration of resources to
wards narrow objectives.
The Russians have the hardware, and
they are currently engaged in a great
deal of adventurism (witness their sup
port for Cuban mercenaries in Africa). I
would like to be able to say that this is
just a manifestation of what used to be
called "soft-spot probing." That is to
say, they will advance where they are
not resisted.
What is the threat to us from this
military behemoth? Can we really be
lieve that the Soviet Union threatens
the West when they must tie down re
sources to deal with China, when they
cannot control their affairs in Eastern
Europe, never mind their own
economy?
I suggest that the Soviets have
reached military parity — or rough par
ity — with the United States and that
they are willing to sit tight at this
juncture. An offensive posture towards
NATO may frighten us, but I will ven
ture that this is not explained by future
intent, so much as a willingness to pre
serve the status quo and an amount of
inertia that will maintain a posture
beyond its real utility.
If Nitze is correct, and the men in the
Kremlin really aim to rule over a
radioactive landscape in the wake of a
nuclear war, then I am left with only
one response: American leaders must

assume that Soviet leaders are rational,
and therefore they should continue to
seek security within a framework of
arms limitation.
— Is the Soviet Union an ally of the third
world ?
How can they be when they lack the
tools to deal with the problems of over
population, poverty, hunger and inter
dependence, which plague unde
veloped nations?
They can't even realize their own
five-year plans. The only thing that the
Soviets have to offer the Third World is
arms; and this explains the form their
foreign policy has taken in the last few
years.
— Is the Soviet Union an ally of com
munism ?
They are allies of those they can con
trol. If they can control communists,
then so be it; but they have de
monstrated an ability to support re
gimes of opposite ideology (as has the
United States) in order to further na
tional interests.
The present regime is embarrassed
by the emergence of Eurocommunism.
It undermines their ballyhooed role as
guardian of the faith and offers a seri
ous example to the regimes of Eastern
Europe.
With respect to Eastern Europe, the
prevailing policy seems to be one of
balancing repression with relaxation of
control. The Soviet Union provides the
raw materials, energy and military pre
sence — that is the lever that keeps
these countries in line. It is a powerful
lever, but one is tempted to ask
whether they are willing to engage in
another invasion of a rebellious satel
lite, or whether they could pull one off
without disastrous consequences.
The answers to these questions lead
me to pose one more, unconventional,
question: is the Soviet Union an ally of
the West?
The calculus of power can not be
seen purely in military terms. The study
of the internal Soviet structure — of the

economy, the leaders, the bureaucracy
— suggests that they have made the
decision to risk more dependence on
the West, rather than turning towards
increased self-sufficiency. They will
buy a factory from West Germany or
Italy rather than disrupt their internal
structure to achieve those ends.
These "technical fixes," may enable
the leadership to satisfy the consumer
and enhance the stability, perhaps the
legitimacy, of the people in power,
while retaining control for them.
Soviet leaders are attempting to insu
late the populace from these contacts
with the West in order to combat what
ever liberalizing influence it may bring.
The Soviets have no word for de
tente. Rather, they use the phrase: "the
relaxation of international tensions."
Such a relaxation will afford them a bet
ter opportunity to pursue their in
terests.
What are those interests? To upgrade
an isolated and inferior economy, to
maintain control over a vulnerable em
pire and to check the threat that they
perceive from China.
Perhaps I am overly optimistic or
naive. I cannot argue with George Will
when he points out the terrors of Soviet
totalitarianism. But I cannot agree that
heightened controntation will amelior
ate conditions inside the Soviet Union.
If we persist in the "Devil Image," of
the Soviets, which so many right-wing
politicians harp on, then we will forec
lose any chance of attaining real coop
eration.
The hardliners shout that the "Devil
Image," is real and verifiable and those
who differ are either deceived or
duped.
They are correct to the extent that if
we act aggressively, the Soviets will re
spond in kind. Therefore, such an
image is real only if we make it real by
failing to embrace the path of coopera
tion and peace.

economy?
I suggest that the Soviets have
reached military parity — or rough par
ity — with the United States and that
they are willing to sit tight at this
juncture. An offensive posture towards
NATO may frighten us, but I will ven
ture that this is not explained by future
intent, so much as a willingness to pre
serve the status quo and an amount of
inertia that will maintain a posture
beyond its real utility.
If Nitze is correct, and the men in the
Kremlin really aim to rule over a
radioactive landscape in the wake of a
nuclear war, then I am left with only
one response: American leaders must

assume that Soviet leaders are rational,
and therefore they should continue to
seek security within a framework of
arms limitation.
— Is the Soviet Union an ally of the third
world ?
How can they be when they lack the
tools to deal with the problems of over
population, poverty, hunger and inter
dependence, which plague unde
veloped nations?
They can't even realize their own
five-year plans. The only thing that the
Soviets have to offer the Third World is
arms; and this explains the form their
foreign policy has taken in the last few
years.
— Is the Soviet Union an ally of com
munism ?
They are allies of those they can con
trol. If they can control communists,
then so be it; but they have de
monstrated an ability to support re
gimes of opposite ideology (as has the
United States) in order to further na
tional interests.
The present regime is embarrassed
by the emergence of Eurocommunism.
It undermines their ballyhooed role as
guardian of the faith and offers a seri
ous example to the regimes of Eastern
Europe.
With respect to Eastern Europe, the
prevailing policy seems to be one of
balancing repression with relaxation of
control. The Soviet Union provides the
raw materials, energy and military pre
sence — that is the lever that keeps
these countries in line. It is a powerful
lever, but one is tempted to ask
whether they are willing to engage in
another invasion of a rebellious satel
lite, or whether they could pull one off
without disastrous consequences.
The answers to these questions lead
me to pose one more, unconventional,
question: is the Soviet Union an ally of
the West?
The calculus of power can not be
seen purely in military terms. The study
of the internal Soviet structure — of the

economy, the leaders, the bureaucracy
— suggests that they have made the
decision to risk more dependence on
the West, rather than turning towards
increased self-sufficiency. They will
buy a factory from West Germany or
Italy rather than disrupt their internal
structure to achieve those ends.
These "technical fixes," may enable
the leadership to satisfy the consumer
and enhance the stability, perhaps the
legitimacy, of the people in power,
while retaining control for them.
Soviet leaders are attempting to insu
late the populace from these contacts
with the West in order to combat what
ever liberalizing influence it may bring.
The Soviets have no word for de
tente. Rather, they use the phrase: "the
relaxation of international tensions."
Such a relaxation will afford them a bet
ter opportunity to pursue their in
terests.
What are those interests? To upgrade
an isolated and inferior economy, to
maintain control over a vulnerable em
pire and to check the threat that they
perceive from China.
Perhaps I am overly optimistic or
naive. I cannot argue with George Will
when he points out the terrors of Soviet
totalitarianism. But I cannot agree that
heightened controntation will amelior
ate conditions inside the Soviet Union.
If we persist in the "Devil Image," of
the Soviets, which so many right-wing
politicians harp on, then we will forec
lose any chance of attaining real coop
eration.
The hardliners shout that the "Devil
Image," is real and verifiable and those
who differ are either deceived or
duped.
They are correct to the extent that if
we act aggressively, the Soviets will re
spond in kind. Therefore, such an
image is real only if we make it real by
failing to embrace the path of coopera
tion and peace.

In his role as director of policy
studies for the Committee on the Pre
sent Danger, Paul Nitze is one of the
principal spokesmen for reactionary
America. He recently warned that "un
less we take urgent measures at once to
reverse current trends, the Russians in
a few years' time will have the capability
to fight a nuclearwar — and towin such
a war in the military sense of ending up
in undisputed command of the
battlefield and being in a position to
dictate the peace."
George Will writes a column for
Newsweek. Not too long ago he asked
whether it is fair to view Soviet leaders
as "a terrible and forbidding group of
men." His answer: "The rivers of
blood, and mountains of other evi
dence, constantly expanding, confirm
this view. The system presupposes and
produces coarse, cruel leaders."
Listening to the current debate in
Congress, one would think that the
ghost of Sen. )oe McCarthy was not
only Ronald Reagan's campaign man
ager, but also chairman of the Republi
can Caucus.
Nitze, Will, Reagan and others would
have us believe not only that the Rus
sians are coming, but that they have
landed on Long Island and are driving
to the heartland.
To a certain extent, extreme political
rhetoric is taken for granted by the
American public. My fear is that on the
threshold of the Senate debate over
ratification of the SALT II treaty, the
American people are uncritically ac
cepting the simplistic and inflated
analysis of Soviet capabilities and inten
tions that the American Right provides.
I find it illuminating to re-evaluate my
existing perceptions»and to try to ans
wer four basic questions on the nature
of Soviet power.
— Is the Soviet Union a superpower ?
At first glance we might say yes. But
on a closer look we are led to ask: can it
really be a superpower when it doesn't

even have a system of decent roads,
when technological innovation and
economic standards are clearly inferior
to those of the West, when Soviet cur
rency is worthless outside its borders,
when the world economy is controlled
by its adversaries?
It is more of an empire than a super
power, for its economy is carefully in
tertwined with those of its satellites in
Eastern Europe. But if it is a super
power, then it is one characterized by
severely uneven development.
— Is the Soviet Union a military power ?
Certainly. But it is essential to note
that it achieved that status through a
huge concentration of resources to
wards narrow objectives.
The Russians have the hardware, and
they are currently engaged in a great
deal of adventurism (witness their sup
port for Cuban mercenaries in Africa). I
would like to be able to say that this is
just a manifestation of what used to be
called "soft-spot probing." That is to
say, they will advance where they are
not resisted.
What is the threat to us from this
military behemoth? Can we really be
lieve that the Soviet Union threatens
the West when they must tie down re
sources to deal with China, when they
cannot control their affairs in Eastern
Europe, never mind their own
economy?
I suggest that the Soviets have

Such a relaxation will afford them a bet
ter opportunity to pursue their in
terests.
What are those interests? To upgrade
an isolated and inferior economy, to
maintain control over a vulnerable em
pire and to check the threat that they
perceive from China.
Perhaps I am overly optimistic or
naive. I cannot argue with George Will
when he points out the terrors of Soviet
totalitarianism. But I cannot agree that
heightened controntation will amelior
ate conditions inside the Soviet Union.
If we persist in the "Devil Image," of
the Soviets, which so many right-wing
politicians harp on, then we will forec
lose any chance of attaining real coop
eration.
The hardliners shout that the "Devil
Image," is real and verifiable and those
who differ are either deceived or
duped.
They are correct to the extent that if
we act aggressively, the Soviets will re
spond in kind. Therefore, such an
image is real only if we make it real by
failing to embrace the path of coopera
tion and peace.
