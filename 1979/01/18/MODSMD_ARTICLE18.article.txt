Personal
clarification
I would like to clarify certain
statements I made to reporter
Nana Humasi and which ap
peared in the story "Foreign
engineering students troubled
here" (Daily, |an. 11).
First of all, I would like to say
that I came to the University
knowingfull well what kinds of
courses and work I would be
encountering; I had seen the
course lists and their descrip
tions, and thus was aware that
some of it would not be applic
able in my own country.
My criticism of computer
based solutions and the use of
steel as a construction material
are not as sweeping as the arti
cle makes them out to be; in
fact, computers and steel are
used by engineers in Costa
Rica, although not to the extent
that they are in the United
States.
Secondly, I would like to say
that I got my bachelor's degree
in civil engineering from the
University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, and thus my state
ment about professors "flying
through the material" is a per
sonal opinion and not that of a
graduate of a foreign university
as the article would seem to
imply.
Thirdly, the statement that
professors move quickly
"without much concentration"
at the end of the article does
not make sense to me; what I

meant to say was that because
of the amount of material that
has to be covered in a given
quarter, sometimes it is not
possible to give attention to
topics of my interest.
Lastly, I would like to add
that my opinion and those of
the other people cited in the
article are personal ones, and
should not be taken, as the title
of the article implied, as those
of foreign engineering stu
dents at large.

Unpleasant
surprise
I write to comment on Nana
Humasi's article on foreign en
gineering students (Daily, |an.
11).
I was surprised to read not
only that I "had said" some
thing (they were "off-the
record" comments to my
friend Nana, not to a jour
nalist), but also that I had been
misquoted.
First, nobody sent me here. I
applied to the University my
self, went through the admis
sion procedure and elected to
come here. The only interven
tion on my government's part
was to send a letter of financial
support.
Secondly, I have never been
a student at the University of
Tulsa, so I know little about the
school. What I do know about
it, and what I said, is that it has a

larger Petroleum Engineering
Dept. than Stanford, not a bet
ter one.
In fact, I withdrew my appli
cation foradmission to Tulsa as
soon as I was offered admis
sion here, as the University was
my first choice.

Morbid
preoccupation
Why may our sexual fan
tasies only be expressed in the
language of orthodox feminist
dogma?
A person, man or woman,
who can laugh at rapes, a
parody of sexuality, is less a
sexual object than one who is
morbidly preoccupied with
sexual violence. In pragmatic
terms, uproarious laughter
might actually be a deterrent
where cowering temerity is an
incitement.
Departure from a "correct"
serious tone need denote
neither revisionism nor reac
tion.

Personal
responsibility
The caption under the
photograph of table litter in the
Graduate School of Business
(Daily, )an. 10), is a frightening

commentary on people's
unwillingness to accept per
sonal responsibility, which
seems so prevalent today.
While faculty and students
bemoan the lack of funds for
better maintenance, have they
considered the simple expe
dient of cleaning up after
themselves? These same indi
viduals are probably also ar
dent spokesmen for greater
state and federal spending to
clean up the environment,
motivated no doubt by the
foulness of their own nests.

Misplaced zeal
Vou can't imagine how de
lighted I was to see your edito
rial headed "Time for fairness"
[Daily, |an. 10). I was appalled
when I read of the action by the
ASSU Senate in response to a
presentation by Cardiovascu
lar Surgery Prof. Eugene Dong.
The subject of his polemic was,
of course, the alleged
"double billing" at the Medi
cal Center. Your editorial
comments pointing out the re
petitive nature of the ASSU's
poorly thought out actions in
this situation and in the Bhutto
situation reflected a much
needed indicator to the ASSU
that its activities were being
closely observed and seriously
questioned.
Though I have the same feel
ings as you do about the likely
outcome of a presentation by a

member of the Medical Center
administration to the ASSU, I
think it still should be carried
out so that the Medical Cent
er's position can be accurately
reflected in the Daily.
More important, I hope that
the ASSU now realizes that
when it dabbles in serious mat
ters, it should consider the im
pact of its pronouncements. I
thank the Daily for admonish
ing the ASSU for its misplaced
zeal.

Escort prototype
Because of the concern
many of us feel about rape on
campus, a number of Casa
Zapata residents have or
ganized what we hope will be a
prototype for dorm escort ser
vices, at least until a campus
wide, University-funded prog
ram gets off the ground.
Just about everyone in our
house has agreed to have his or
her name placed on a dittoed
list, along with his or her
phone number. Anyone on the
list is then a potential escort
agreeing to be on call at all
times, or to take responsibility
for finding another Zapatan
who can go if he or she is too
busy.
We hope other dorms will
adopt our idea.

University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, and thus my state
ment about professors "flying

professors move quickly
"without much concentration"
at the end of the article does
not make sense to me; what I

meant to say was that because
of the amount of material that

Lastly, I would like to add
that my opinion and those of

should not be taken, as the title
of the article implied, as those
of foreign engineering stu
dents at large.

Unpleasant
surprise
I write to comment on Nana
Humasi's article on foreign en
gineering students (Daily, |an.
11).
I was surprised to read not
only that I "had said" some
thing (they were "off-the
record" comments to my
friend Nana, not to a jour
nalist), but also that I had been
misquoted.
First, nobody sent me here. I
applied to the University my
self, went through the admis
sion procedure and elected to
come here. The only interven
tion on my government's part
was to send a letter of financial
support.
Secondly, I have never been
a student at the University of
Tulsa, so I know little about the
school. What I do know about
it, and what I said, is that it has a

larger Petroleum Engineering
Dept. than Stanford, not a bet
ter one.
In fact, I withdrew my appli
cation foradmission to Tulsa as
soon as I was offered admis
sion here, as the University was
my first choice.

Morbid
preoccupation
Why may our sexual fan
tasies only be expressed in the
language of orthodox feminist
dogma?
A person, man or woman,
who can laugh at rapes, a
parody of sexuality, is less a
sexual object than one who is
morbidly preoccupied with
sexual violence. In pragmatic
terms, uproarious laughter
might actually be a deterrent
where cowering temerity is an
incitement.
Departure from a "correct"
serious tone need denote
neither revisionism nor reac
tion.

The caption under the
photograph of table litter in the
Graduate School of Business
(Daily, )an. 10), is a frightening

commentary on people's
unwillingness to accept per
sonal responsibility, which
seems so prevalent today.
While faculty and students
bemoan the lack of funds for
better maintenance, have they
considered the simple expe
dient of cleaning up after
themselves? These same indi
viduals are probably also ar
dent spokesmen for greater
state and federal spending to
clean up the environment,
motivated no doubt by the
foulness of their own nests.

Misplaced zeal
Vou can't imagine how de
lighted I was to see your edito
rial headed "Time for fairness"
[Daily, |an. 10). I was appalled
when I read of the action by the
ASSU Senate in response to a
presentation by Cardiovascu
lar Surgery Prof. Eugene Dong.
The subject of his polemic was,
of course, the alleged
"double billing" at the Medi
cal Center. Your editorial
comments pointing out the re
petitive nature of the ASSU's
poorly thought out actions in
this situation and in the Bhutto
situation reflected a much
needed indicator to the ASSU
that its activities were being
closely observed and seriously
questioned.
Though I have the same feel
ings as you do about the likely
outcome of a presentation by a

member of the Medical Center
administration to the ASSU, I
think it still should be carried
out so that the Medical Cent
er's position can be accurately
reflected in the Daily.
More important, I hope that
the ASSU now realizes that
when it dabbles in serious mat
ters, it should consider the im
pact of its pronouncements. I
thank the Daily for admonish
ing the ASSU for its misplaced
zeal.

Escort prototype
Because of the concern
many of us feel about rape on
campus, a number of Casa
Zapata residents have or
ganized what we hope will be a
prototype for dorm escort ser
vices, at least until a campus
wide, University-funded prog
ram gets off the ground.
Just about everyone in our
house has agreed to have his or
her name placed on a dittoed
list, along with his or her
phone number. Anyone on the
list is then a potential escort
agreeing to be on call at all
times, or to take responsibility
for finding another Zapatan
who can go if he or she is too
busy.
We hope other dorms will
adopt our idea.

Personal
clarification
I would like to clarify certain
statements I made to reporter
Nana Humasi and which ap
peared in the story "Foreign
engineering students troubled
here" (Daily, |an. 11).
First of all, I would like to say
that I came to the University
knowingfull well what kinds of
courses and work I would be
encountering; I had seen the
course lists and their descrip
tions, and thus was aware that
some of it would not be applic
able in my own country.
My criticism of computer
based solutions and the use of
steel as a construction material
are not as sweeping as the arti
cle makes them out to be; in
fact, computers and steel are
used by engineers in Costa
Rica, although not to the extent
that they are in the United
States.
Secondly, I would like to say
that I got my bachelor's degree
in civil engineering from the
University of Massachusetts at
