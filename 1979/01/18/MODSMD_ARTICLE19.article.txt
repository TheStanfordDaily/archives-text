Remember that scene in Persona where
Liv Ullman and Bibi Andersson are both
photographed so they seem to merge fea
tures and personalities? Well, that doesn't
have half the overtones of any scene in
Moment by Moment: John Travolta and
Lily Tomlin look so much alike that, in
close-up, the audience may get the uneasy
feeling that its watching someone make
love to himself in a wide-screen mirror.
If you haven't seen Persona, the makers
ot Moment by Moment still see to it that
you get a lot of insights from it anyway.
Even Bergman wouldn't be brave enough
to use as much blatant symbolism as any
one bright enough to read Reader's Digest
can find here.
A plot analysis of Moment by Moment
would run something like this. A middle
aged woman, named Trish, has a white
dog, named Scamp, and an estranged
husband, named Stu. Scamp is very well
manicured, as is Trish. This younger guy,
named Strip (like Sunset Strip, not the
comic variety), comes along to this wo
man's beach house, and immediately dis
cerns that under her uptight, bourgeois
exterior lies a libido that would do any
traveling salesman proud. Trish doesn't
like Strip at first, but she quickly changes
her mind and takes him to bed.
The symbolism
Here's where the symbolism comes in.
Strip finds a dog with a hurt foot; he names
it Corky. Corky is sloppy, not too bright,
and thinks very well of himself, as does
Strip. Corky and Trish's dog, Scamp, hit it
off right away and remain that way for the
rest of the movie. Unfortunately for the
animals, and for the audience, their
human counterparts aren't so lucky: they
wrangle out the intricacies of a May-
September romance for more than an
hour of remaining screen-time before
coming to the inevitable clinch at the end.
Dialogue matches plot
With a plot like that, bright dialogue
must have been too much to ask for.
Travolta's big line is, "I've had it with
cheap sex. It makes me feel cheap." Tom
lin's equally witty reply is, "I've never had
cheap sex. I was sort of looking forward to
it." But a little later, Travolta gets to mouth
what may become one of the most famous
bad lines in the movies: "Pretty soon," he

says to Tomlin, "You'll be old enough to
be my grandmother." Tomlin's character
is understandably upset and immediately,
without visible effort, psychoanalyses
him: "You must be in pain yourself to want
to hurt me so much."
Pod-people
It took the producing genius of Robert
( Saturday Night Fever, Grease, Sargeant
Pepper) Stigwood to take two admittedly
talented performers like Tomlin and
Travolta and turn them into museum
specimens of the walking dead. Moment
by Moment might be regarded as an unof
ficial sequel to Invasion of the Body
Snatchers: everyone in this film walks,
talks and thinks like K)TBS's pod-people.
Tomlin's character makes the first move
on the couch, but she shows nothing else
of the lack of stereotype that might be
expected in a film directed by a woman,
lane Wagner. Does Wagner really believe
that Moment by Moment could be an ac
curate depiction of human behavior, or is
she merely too inept at handling actors
and scenes to put across what she really
means?
If Brando can sue about the way his
name was used as collateral by the pro
ducers of Superman, perhaps Tomlin and
Travolta might wish to consider suing
about the way their names are being hand
led in Moment by Moment's advertising. If
they're lucky, maybe they can have them
removed from the credits before it does
irreparable damage to their reputations.

In The Duellists a soldier in Napoleon's
army attempts for 15 years to avenge a
blow to his honor. He is a hussar lieuten
ant, stationed in Strassbourg, and he kills a
cousin of the mayor in a duel — when
another lieutenant informs him that this is
not proper he sees himself gravely of
fended. And for 15 years he is obsessed
with thoughts of killing his military peer —
he attempts to do so whenever peace,
proximity, and the Napoleonic code of
honor permit. The Duellists is a story of a
madman whose weapon is a strained set of
ethical imperatives, and of a "victim"

whose apparently malignant sense of
honor triumphs in the end.
It is a very good movie. It is a beautiful
movie. The cinematography in The Duel
lists is the best I have ever seen, and direc
tor Ridley Scott has kept this beauty cent
ral to the picture. Early morning shots of
the French countryside; deliberate still
life shots of bread and wine on a table —
images such as these are consistantly set
against the action of the story. A child
tending to a flock of geese walks in on the
fight between soldier and civilian — she
watches as the soldier bolsters his pride
with a clean thrust through the lung.
For the most part, the transition from
literature to film has been made effectively
here. Joseph Conrad's "The Duel" is only
slightly bastardized, yet the movie that re
sults is decidedly a thing unto itself. It is
overwhelmingly a visual exercise, in which
most of the dialogue seems peripheral —
the lasting moments are a product of the
strain between image and situation. We
see it in the terror in the eyes of the man
who prepares to joust with swords on hor
seback, and in the elaborate precautions
taken to insure that a loser has an oppor
tunity to be slaughtered in a dignified
manner.
Excellent
And the acting, generally, is excellent,
as we expect from such a cast. Harvey
Keitel is villainous as hell and still strangely
alluring, and Keith Carradine plays oppo
site him with considerable panache (he
does, at times, sound as if he belongs in
Newport Beach rather than IHth-century
France, but much more often his ef
fortlessness is masterfully aristocratic).
And Albert Finney and Edward Fox and
Cristina Raines also star— their respective
brilliancies keep the picture from being
more than occasionally flimsy.
They thrive in the richness and expres
siveness and dignity of the filming, and
provide the story with a base upon which
an archaic dillemma has striking immedi
acy. The Duellists, in this sense has very
little in common with most of what we
generally see, as it proves that a movie can
be well-nigh riveting without being new
and improved.
