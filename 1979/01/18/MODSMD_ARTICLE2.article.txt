"Iran, under the great leadership
of the shah, is an island of stability in
one of the more troubled areas of the
world. This is a great tribute to you,
your majesty, to your leadership and
to the respect, admiration and love
which your people give to you."
President |immy Carter gave this
telephone message to the Shah of
Iran in September, 1977.
"It is a great specimen of political
analysis," said Noam Chomsky of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy and one of the featured panelists
at last night's symposium on the Ira
nian crisis and the United States.
1000 attended
About 1000 persons filled the bot
tom floor of Memorial Auditorium to
hear the "teach-in' on Iran, spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau
and other campus groups.
Chomsky's opinions of the United
States "imperialistic" attitudes to
wards Iran were supported by
panelists Prof. Thomas Ricks of
Georgetown University and Stanford
graduate student Saeed Kadivar.
A representative from the State
Department had previously been
scheduled to attend but this week
notified the Speakers Bureau that he
would not be able to travel to Stan
ford.
The current U.S. policies toward
Iran were instead presented by Ken
neth Hansen, an international con
sultant for the Asian Development
Corporation.
Chomsky cited several news arti

cles which told of the imperialistic
attitude of the United States toward
Iran. Government documents were
also presented, including one joint
recommendation from the Depart
ments of State, Defense and Interior
urging good relations with the
Mideast because "the American oil
operations are, for all practical pur
poses, instruments of our foreign
policy."
Chomsky alsp said the United
States actions in Iran did not reflect
the stated goals of "Mr. Human
Rights" — Jimmy Carter.
"The chief CIA analyst of Iran in
the 1970s has recently stated that the
CIA not only knew of the regular
practice of torture by Savak (the Ira
nian police force), but that the senior
CIA official was involved in instruct
ing officials in Savak torture
techniques," Chomsky said.
Torture seminars
"The torture seminars were based
on German torture techniques of
World War II," he added.
The future of Iran can be dictated
by the American people, Chomsky
said.
"It's a fear, yes, that U.S. planners
are now preparing another object
lesson for the Iranian people,
perhaps one modeled after In
donesia or Chile, and it is up to us to
make sure that they have no oppor
tunity to teach that lesson,"
Chomsky said.
Ricks, considered to be one of a
small number of Iran experts now in
the United States, sees the future of
Iran as including U.S. involvement.

"The possibility of military inter
vention is not a possibility any
longer. It's <1 probability," he said.
"We have to be prepared."
And along with this U.S. interven
tion will come the fall of the Bakhtiar
government.
"I'd be very surprised if Bakhtiar's
government lasts until March," Ricks
said. "He made an enormous politi
cal mistake by redefining the Iranian
Nationalist Front, and he's lost all
support because of that action."
Mthough Hansen was the substi
tute for the advocate of current U.S.
policies in Iran, his statements belied
that position.
Policies 'crumbling
He said U.S. foreign policies are
"crumbling" because of the "under
lying but tardy awareness that U.S.
interests cannot be long sustained by
policies which align us with forces
which suppress basic human rights.
"This is a hard lesson for the Un
ited States to have to learn again and
again," he added.
"Even during the international
turor created by President Carter's
redeclaration of human rights, Iran
was virtually ignored in this context
or even peripherally considered."
This has left U.S. policies in "near
shambles," he said. But there is
hope, he added.
"I am confident that we will strive
to manifest equal awareness and un
derstanding that the principles for
which the Iranians have fought and
died are kindred to ours and should
not be compromised further by
expediency or ignorance."
