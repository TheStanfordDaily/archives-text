## (Complete Fun) Almost 
### 
Briefcase Full of Blues
Blues Brothers
Atlantic Records
It's ironic that one of the
better songs on the Blues
Brothers' new album, Brief
case Full of Blues, is entitled
"(I Got Everything I Need)
Almost," because that's
exactly the feeling I got
about the entire album.
Briefcase is a very enter
taining album, and a good
debut effort for Joliet lake
and Elwood Blues — better
known as John Belushi and
Dan Aykroyd—but that's
about all it is. It has some
very good moments, such
as King Floyd's "Groove
Me" and Isaac Hayes' "Soul
Man," but it also has some
not-so-good moments, like
"Messin' with the Kid" and
" B' Movie Box Car Blues."
The album, recorded live
at the Universal Amphithea
ter in Los Angeles, is ham
pered by one main prob
lem. The principals, Aykroyd
and Belushi, are musically
inferior to the band that
plays behind them. Be
lushi's singing can best be
described as slightly better
than competent. Aykroyd's
harmonica playing is just

barely adequate and his
background vocals aren't
worth describing.
His only good vocal effort
comes on "Rubber Biscuit,"
on which his lead singing is
good only because the song
is more like a Saturday Night
Live sketch than anything
else — just good fun.
The best aspect of the

album is the band itself,
which consists of some of
the top studio musicians in
the country.
Matt Murphy, the lead
guitarist, is the strongest
link in the chain. Many parts
of the album are laced with
his intricate work, and cre
dit must be given to
whomever is responsible
for letting him take as many
solos as he does.

Steve Cropper and
Donald Dunn, guitar and
bass, respectively, are both
veterans ot Otis Redding's
band and add a stabilizing
force to the live perfor
mance.
The horn section is also
very good, and is fortu
nately allowed to prove it
fairly often on the album.
Paul Shaffer, though his
keyboard playing does not
equal the talent around
him, is the musical director
of the group and is probably
the one responsible for the
smart choice of emphasiz
ing the stronger points of
the band.
After watching the Blues
Brothers' performance on
New Year's Eve at Winter
land, I believe the album
catches much of the fun of
the real thing. Even though
you can't see Belushi's and
Aykroyd's entertaining stage
antics, they successfully put
the feeling across on the re
cord. It is definitely an
album worth buying, if for
no other reason than just
the pure enjoyment derived
from listening to it. It is by
no means a bad album, and I
look forward to their next
effort.
