## Spirited production 
### 
Period comedies often seem
slow and stressed and tedious
to me — what was funny or
clever in past eras often ap
pears hackneyed or artless iri
ours. It is a pleasant surprise to
discover that Oliver
Goldsmith's farce She Stoops
to Conquer retains its youthful
charm in the Berkeley Reper
tory Theatre's spirited produc
tion.
Written in 1773, She Stoops
to Conquer is Goldsmith's
parody of the popular senti
mental comedies of his day.
The plot abounds with the ex
pected, but nevertheless
amusing mistaken identities,
foiled elopements, stolen
jewels and practical jokes.
Young Charles Marlow, a
man who easily woos the bar
maids yet stutters and stam
mers with women of his own
class visits a friend of his
father's with a marriageable
daughter, Kate Hardcastle. Ac
companied by his friend
George Hastings, who is sec
retly engaged to Kate's niece,
Constance Neville, they are led
to believe that Hardcastle's
home is an inn by the merry
prankster Tony Lumpkin.
The plot continues to tie it
self in wonderfully humorous
knots, yet everything rights it
self in the end, and, as always,
everyone lives happily ever af
ter.
For a light comedy
Goldsmith's characters have
surprising depth, and are re
freshingly imperfect

stereotypes. Goldsmith avoids
the affected dialogue of many
of his contemporaries, sub
stituting good-natured humor
for insipid sentimentality.
The Berkeley Repertory
Theatre's production of She
Stoops to Conquer has an in
fectious exuberance. Director
Maureen O'Reilly plays
Goldsmith for all he's worth,
yet skillfully avoids exaggerat
ing scenes to the ridiculous.
Though the British accents did
sound affected at first, the en
semble (or my ears) eventually
settled into an acceptable West
Coast version of the King's En
glish.
Paul Laramore is brilliant as
Young Marlow, alternating be
tween the arrogant, virile
seducer of barmaids and the
stammering, self-effacing idiot
during his flirtations with Kate.
Anne Swift, the determined
Kate, ably stoops to the level of
a barmaid to conquer Young
Marlow — their scenes to
gether are among the funniest
in the play.
Charles Dean is wonderful as
the drunken joker Tony
Lumpkin who revels in the
misunderstandings of others.
He brings a very physical en
joyment to the role with his
marvelously expressive face
and eyebrows equalling those
of Groucho Marx.
With the exception of J.C.
Sealy who is too young to be
convincing as the vain and
ridiculous Mrs. Hardcastle,
they are ably supported by Joe

DeSalvio, Nicole Baptiste,
Robert Sicular, Michael
Leibert, Jahnna Beecham,
Michael Ford and Charles Mar
tinet.
The period costumes are by
Rondi Davis and the ingenious
sets by Lauren Cory.
