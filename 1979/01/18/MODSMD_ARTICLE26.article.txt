## Three new classical releases 
### 
Handel: Water Music (com
plete)
Concentus Musicus Wien
Nikolaus Harnoncourt, cond.
Telefunken
Complete performances of
the Water Music have become
so common that Telefunken is
offering this record at a tem
porary reduced price to attract
the jaded collector.
Once lured, the buyer actu
ally finds something quite

novel: this performance tries
hard to "out-authenticate" its
rivals. Concentus Musicus
uses original instruments or
replicas — superbly — and
there are but 27 players in all.
The effect is nicely transpa
rent and quite anti-romantic;
in the new tradition, "slow"
movements are no longer
lingered over. At times Har
noncourt's rhythms seem a bit
"precious," and the trilling
bray of the horns is downright

laughable in the Overture
sequence.
But humorless worship of
each of Harnoncourt's ideas is
not the point; much better to
hoist a glass of ale, toast
Handel, and recognize this as
much closer to the sound he
knew than some inflated re
cordings of the past.
Beethoven Trio No. 7, "Ar
chduke"
Suk Trio
Quintessence
This is not really a new re
lease — it dates from 1962 and
has been offered before on
other labels — but rather a
welcome old friend which
sounds better than ever.
With the possible exception
of Suk's very recent remake,
this has to be the best "Ar
chduke" in stereo. Beeth
oven's humor is conveyed
nearly to the fullest by the Suk
Trio's give-and-take between
players.
The recording does place the
piano a bit too much behind
the string players in the last two
movements, but otherwise all
is well. It's nice, too, to see a

cassette to boost the taped
chamber repertoire, even if it
doesn't have any program
notes.
Berlioz: Harold in Italy
Josef Suk, viola
Czech Philharmonic, Diet
rich Fischer-Dieskau, cond.
Supraphon
Can a part-time violist and a
part-time conductor compete
with the established record
ings of this work?
Well, I'm not sure I'd want
this as the only one, but
Fischer-Dieskau s is a novel
view stressing the lighter ele
ments of the score. He gives
the winds and the brass promi
nence; this becomes almost
the Italy of Mendelssohn s "Ita
lian" Symphony.
Suk's viola playing is also
very fine, while the
demonstration-quality Sup
raphon recording (in SQ quad)
adds to the drama.
Quintessence has issued this
record too, with a different
cover at half the price, though I
can't say whether or not the
sound is as good.
