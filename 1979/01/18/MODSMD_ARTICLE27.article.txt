## Alternatives to simplistic funk 
### 
The vibraharp, as it was used by early perfor
mers, was a harsh and metallic-sounding in
strument. Lionel Hampton, one of the pioneers
of the instrument, favored hard mallets, and the
tone he created was thus sharply percussive and
very brittle. In contrast, Milt Jackson completely
changed the direction of the vibraharp during
the '50s with his use of soft mallets and smooth
legato lines. For almost two decades lackson's
playing remained the model of what the vib
raharp should sound like.
All that changed with the emergence of Gary
Burton. In the late '60s Burton had the reputa
tion of being something of a child prodigy. Every
summer, in between school years, Burton
would record an album for RCA — albums which
were completely different from traditional vib
raharp music. With the release of Alone at Last
— a solo vibes album — it became clear what
direction Burton was taking. Hampton's style
was modelled on the work of drummers,
lackson had adopted phrasings like a
saxophone would make — but Burton was for
going a very pianistic form of expression. Burton
has credited Bill Evans with being an important
influence on his playing; one can see why —
both accentuated the smooth melodic aspects
and the harmonic potential of their instruments.
Complex chord patterns
Burton's newest album, Times Square, from
the ECM label, serves as an excellent example of
the graces of Burton's playing. )azz of the past
decade has been wavering between dissonant
modalities and simplistic funk riffs. In contrast
to these prevailing schools of thought, Burton
opts for complex chord patterns and intriguing
melodies. Burton has always favored the intri
cate compositions of his bassist Steve Swallow,
and Times Square is no exception. Swallow con
tributes no less than five of the album's eight
songs. Two of the other works are by Keith Jar
rett — another composer noted for his choice of
unusual harmonic sequences.
Improvisation
Recently Burton added trumpeter Tiger
Okoshi to his group, and the new instrument
gives the group a sound much different than
Burton's last few bands. The emphasis here is on
improvisation — the soloists are given a chance
to explore the complex songs at length, while
melody statements and background riffs are
held to the barest minimum. Instead Burton is

always challenging his imagination in order to
create and the result is well worthwhile. Bur
ton's technical proficiency is well known, but
often overlooked is his sensitivity in soloing. It
would be hoped that Burton's albums for ECM
dispel his reputation as a slick technician, and
replace it with an appreciation of the more sub
tle aspects of his playing.
Burton is joined by drummer Roy Haynes,
which is in manv ways a surprise. Haynes built
his reputation playing be-bop, while his most
recent album was a very "funky'' effort.
Nonetheless, it is to Hayne's credit that he fits
quite well into the smooth streamlined ECM
school of playing. It would be very nice to hear
more of this type of playing from him.
As Good As It Gets
Jimmy Rowles/Ray Brown
Concord
The theory that opposites attract can have dis
astrous effects when applied to the music world.
Norman Cranz, in the jazz world, has made a
career out of assembling stylistically different
musicians on the same album (his recent release
of the Cecil Taylor/Mary Lou Williams duets is a
perfect example). The results are often disastr
ous, and when they succeed it is often despite
the combinations rather than because of them.
But the combination of Jimmy Rowles and Ray
Brown suffers from none of these problems.
One might complain that these two artists are
not, in fact, opposites — certainly they have
recorded together as long as 20 years. Still their
rhythmic conceptions are very different. Brown
favors a strong reliable pulse, while Rowles
favors a light airy rhythmic approach. The result
ing combination is surprisingly attractive.
Rowles swings more than he has in recent years
and Brown plays as usual — which is to say
superb.
Under-recorded
Until recently Rowles remained one of the
most under-recorded artists in jazz. His critical
reputation, particularly among the prominent
New York critics, was extremely high. Nonethe
less, few record companies use critical notices
as a criteria in selecting artists. But in the last few
months Rowles has seen his albums released on
Columbia (an excellent duet album with Stan
Cetz) Xanadu and Choice.
The Concord release with Ray Brown is, how
ever, perhaps the best indication of Rowles'
pianistic talents. His playing is very crisp; his
tone control seems to get more and more daring
with every record. Particularly on "Sophisti
cated Lady" and "Love," Rowles is very aggres
sive i— hopefully this album will dispel the
long-held assumption that Rowles does not
"swing."
Rowles, throughout his career, has been
noted primarily as an accompanist for singers.
He was, reputedly, the favorite pianist of Billie
Holiday, while he has also worked with vocal
luminaries such as Sarah Vaughn and Carmen
McCrae. It is perhaps this background which
has caused Rowles' playing to be so under
stated.
Really breathes
Given the chance to spread out, Rowles, in
the Concord album, hits more notes than is his
wont. Also noteworthy is his rhythmic control.
He has a sure sense of time — something which
is much more rare among jazz musicians than
one might expect. You could set your watch by
his playing yet it never has that metronomic
boredom of some great time keepers. His play
ing really breathes, seems really loose.
It would be nice to think that Rowles' years of
neglect have passed for good. This amazing
musician certainly deserves to have more of his
playing set down on record, particularly in the
company of master musicians such as Ray
Brown. A follow-up album would be delightful.
