# Lauds capitalism for the progress it brings
## Henry Ford decries liability suits 
### DAVID FRANK 
Henry Ford II defended the merits
of capitalism, calling it"the most in
novative and progressive force" in
the world's history in a speech here
yesterday.
Ford, chairman of the board and
chief executive of the Ford Motor
Company and grandson of Henry
Ford, listed freedom as one of the
most distinguishing elements of of
American capitalism.
In a question and answer period
following his speech, Ford asked re
porters to leave the auditorium be

cause he said "answers can't be as
full and frank as we would like them
to be. That's the thing to do here if
we are to have a good free flow of
questions and answers."
Asked about the technological ad
vancements of the Japanese auto in
dustry, Ford replied that the Ameri
can auto industry is falling behind in
innovation, but the United States is
"not behind" with respect to the
whole industry.
When asked about the corpora
tion's product liability concerning
the Ford Pinto and defects in Fires
tone tires, Ford said, "I prefer to
talk about the Firestone case of
which I have absolutely no know
ledge."
Lawyer is king
"We're living in a society today
where the lawyer is king," Ford said.
"We've got to do something about
them (liability settlements). They're
getting out of hand."
"Corporations have (product) lia
bility, no queston ...but I don't know
where the liability lies," he said. "We
felt we built a good model Pinto in
1969 and 1970. We thought we had a
safe product in accordance to the
tests that were made at that
time." Regarding President |immy
Carter's mandatory wage and price
guidelines and their effect on indus
try, Ford said the situation was com
plex and there "will be difficulties"
for some companies to comply.
However, he said the Ford Motor

Company "is committed to the
guidelines as a corporation.
Positive effects?
Throughout his speech, Ford
pointed out the positive effects of
the automobile industry. He said that
the car has provided Americans with
"greater personal autonom* than
has ever been known before." He
noted the "millions of jobs" created
in the auto industry and other related
industries.
Ford, speaking to a capacity crowd
in Bishop Auditorium, answered
criticisms about the pollution and
gas-guzzling habits of cars. There are
no "perfect" cars, he said. In order to
respond to the rigors of the con
sumer market, "certain trade-offs are
involved" to insure prices "within
the reach of most people."
"Anyone who doubts that
capitalism is innovative should take a
look at the socialist countries of East-


Henry Ford II
ern Europe," Ford said. The
"deadening hand" of those govern
ments made citizens bereft of pro
ducts such as automobiles, re
frigerators, and washing machines,
he said.
Ford said capitalism's harshest cri
tics work at American universities.
Tolerance of these criticisms is "one
of capitalism's important qualities,"
On the issue of free enterprise,
Ford said that a capitalist society "is
not one looking to the state for gui
dance. The vote for Proposition 13
demonstrated that America wants
the government off their backs," he
said.
The freedom of capitalism repre
sents a fundamental ingredient of
our country because Americans "are
enterprising people," Ford con
cluded.
