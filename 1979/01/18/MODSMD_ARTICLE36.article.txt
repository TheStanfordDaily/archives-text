Violence threatens Bakhtiar regime
Tehran, Iran — Pro-shah troops battled demonstrators in the
oil city of Ahwaz yesterday, the first full day of the shah's forced
"vacation" abroad, creating a major threat to the stability of
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar's fledgling civilian govern
ment.
At least 30 people were reported killed or wounded in the
violence.
Meanwhile, the embattled Shah of Iran and Empress Farah
will seek refuge at the fenced estate of Walter Annenberg this
weekend, the Palm Springs Desert Sun reported yesterday.
In the capital, Bakhtiar huddled with top national security
advisers to plan moves for halting the violence that has plagued
Iran for more than a year.
The widespread strikes that have crippled the nation's oil
based economy continued as workers demanded that Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who left the country Tuesday for
Egypt en route to the United States, formally give up the throne.
Schlesinger: gas rationing may be needed
Washington — Tough government action may be needed,
including gasoline rationing as a last resort, if Iranian oil pro
duction is not restored by this summer, Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger said yesterday.
President Jimmy Carter, however, expressed confidence yes
terday that the Iranian people would be able to restore a stable
government and economy to their strife-torn nation following
the departure of the shah.
Schlesinger told the Senate Energy Committee that much of
the loss of Iranian oil is being made up by increased imports

from Saudi Arabia.
Schlesinger expressed confidence that Iranian production
soon will be restored- But, he warned, "If Iranian production
does not come on stream by the summer, we could be in
trouble by next winter."
Judge refuses gag order in White trial
San Francisco — A judge Tuesday refused to gag more than 40
witnesses subpoenaed to testify at a closed-door hearing for
Dan White, accused of killing Mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk.
"I believe the people, press and news media usually, for the
most part, at least try to report the news in a fair and impartial
manner," said Judge R.J. Reynolds in explaining why he didn't
invoke the gag rule.
Despite that, Douglas Schmidt, White's attorney, refused to
talk with reporters after the day's session was over.
Reynolds said the law forced him to close the hearing at the
request of Schmidt, who said he wanted a closed hearing to
avoid pretrial publicity.
