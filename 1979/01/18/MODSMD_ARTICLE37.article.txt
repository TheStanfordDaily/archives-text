# Author decries women's status in fiction
## 
### KATHLEEN WHEATON 
In discussing what she called
the "staggering exclusiveness of
literature," a woman writer asked
an audience of nearly 300 women
here yesterday how many of them
had ever found their lives
adequately portrayed in fiction.
"Minorities in literature are
majorities in humanity," writer
Tillie Olsen told an audience
primarily composed of women.
The author of two short story col
lections, Tell Me a Riddle and Si
lences, described the vast ab
sences and silences she perceives
in the world of literature.
"Women are half of all people
of color, and nearly all people of
color are working people," said
Olsen. "But how many pages of
literature have to do with the
everyday world of work?"
Olsen said that the exclusion of

"proletarian" writers by the liter
ary world is particularly regretta
ble "at a time when our colleges
are so full of people whose pa
rents could never contribute to
the arts — the sons and daughters
of the working class."
Olsen describes her education
as "the great college of everyday
human work." While she wrote
her first novel Yonnondio at the
age of nineteen, she had to set it
aside and work for the next 20
years as an office employee, a
domestic and mother of four
daughters.
Eirst story
In 1955 Olsen was admitted to
the creative writing program here
as a Wallace Stegner fellow. She
continued to work and raise her
family, writing stories on the iron
ing board. She published her first
story, "Tell Mea Riddle" at age 50.
At Stanford "I established my

first literary friendships except for
the public librarian," Olsen said.
Olsen discovered that her read
ing background was quite diffe
rent from that of the University
faculty. "I had read literature that
did not exist for them: regional,
sociological, black, women. I
began to see that what was read in
literature was selected by men of a
privileged class."
Olsen described her discovery
of the faculty wife in the 19505;
women with educations often
equal to their husbands, but
whose literary voices were un
heard. "I understood the situa
tion of my sex in a way that I never
had before," Olsen said.
More men
Olsen pointed out that men
make up anywhere from 50 to 95
percent of American writers, ad
ding that any ratio except a one
to-one deserves to be ques

tioned.
"The issues of motherhood and
sexuality are only accorded rec
ognition when they are expressed
in terms of art or in terms of suc
cess." Olsen read a passage from
her latest work, Silences, which
describes a woman trying to cook
and to care for two sick children.
"It's a miracle of human move
ment," said Olsen. When you see
it on the stage, at a ballet, you
recognize it; but the mother can
ning in the kitchen with the baby
juggling on her hip, you don't
recognize."
Olsen said that when she began
to write, she "did not understand
that an ironing board was not a fit
subject."
"Literature has had to do with a
small percentage of women. Most
literature about women has yet to
be written."
