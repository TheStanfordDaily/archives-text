# Major a popular field here
## Women move into engineering 
### JENNY STIMSON 
— Katy Counts, a sophomore in mechanical engineer
ing, was "curious to know how everything works."
— Robin Furness, a senior in civil engineering, feels an
obligation to help improve the environment.
— Stacy Azama, a junior in industrial engineering, said
her major provides a "good springboard for business
management."
These are reasons cited by some of the 156 women
majoring in engineering this year — the most popular
field for undergraduate women here.
The number of women with either a declared major in
engineering or undeclared in a pre-engineering prog
ram has increased at the rate of approximately 40 per
year since 1974 for undergraduates and 20 per year for
graduate students, according to Madeline FHunt, assis
tant dean of engineering.
Hunt said women "have become more aware of op
portunities in engineering. Also engineering has
changed; it is not as much physical, but involves work
ing with computers." Environmental engineering and
product design are particularly popular with women
right now, Hunt said.
(During the past five years, the number of under
graduate women majoring in engineering has increased
by nearly 400 percent. Only 43 majored in this field in
1973-74.
Women now make up almost a quarter of the 990 total
undergraduates either majoring in engineering or ex
pressing an interest as freshmen.
According to the Academic Information Center, the
number of freshmen indicating an interest in engineer
ing has nearly doubled in the last five years. Nearly one
out of 10 freshman women this year listed engineering as
their first choice among six academic fields.
Furness decided on her major after stopping out for
five years and working with theater companies in the Bay
Area.
"I woke up one morning and felt that the world was
falling apart," Furness said. "A lot of environmental

problems have their basis in a lack of conscientiousness
in industry. The key to the door is to have a grasp of the
problems they have in coming up with solutions." Fur
ness said she feels going into environmental work with a
technical background will give her more credibility.
Several women commented that a technical
background was a good foundation fora career in law or
business.
|an Crawford majored in human biology as an under
graduate and is currently studying Engineering
Economics Systems. She said she feels her graduate
study in engineering will give her an analytical
framework with which to handle problems, probably as
a consultant to large firms.
Counts said she had no interest in using her engineer
ing vocationally. As a freshman, she leaned heavily to
ward humanities, but "got tired of everything being so
subjective." Reading she did last summer made her
realize "how much more is involved in engineering than
slabbing bricks together."
Many women said engineering would provide them
with a broader base in the job market. But they said they
chose their major primarily because they found it in
teresting. Several women who started as pre-med stu
dents decided on engineering during their sophomore
year.
Women said that affirmative action did not affect their
decision to major in engineering, but they noticed its
effect when applying for jobs. Wendy Peterman, a fifth
year co-terminal student in electrical engineering, said
industry is "dying for electrical engineers in general and
even more for women electrical engineers."
In general, although women engineering students
said there are noticeably fewer women students in their
classes, their professors treated them no differently than
male students.
Furness said she had encountered a discriminatory
attitude when taking prerequisite classes at Foothill Col
lege, but had not been aware of any kind of prejudice
here.
