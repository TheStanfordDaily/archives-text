# Med Center leads world in heart transplants

Most of them are young, vigorous,
fairly stable psychologically, and
have a good family situation to sup
port them.
These young and vigorous people
have serious heart diseases and a life
expectancy of months; thev repre
sent the average heart transplant pa
tient here.
About 250 people are reterred by
physicians from throughout the Un
ited States to the University's Medi
cal Center for heart transplants each
year, said Dr. Bruce Reitz, an assis
tant professor of cardiovascular
surgery and one of six surgeons on
the University's heart transplant
team.

About 15 percent of the patients
are finally selected each year to un
dergo a five-hour heart transplant
operation at the Med Center.
Reitz, a 196b graduate of the Uni
versity, told about 50 members of the
Stanford Pre-Medical Society about
his work last night in the Meyer
Forum Room.
"Fewer heart transplants are done
in the rest of the world than take
place here each year/' Reitz said.
"The research the University has
been doing since 1960, when it per
sisted in being the only major medi
cal center pursuing it, has paid off."
The first human heart transplant
was performed by Dr. Christiaan
Barnard in South Africa in 1967. The

University's surgeons were not far
behind, Rietz said, because the first
heart transplant in the Medical
Center was performed in (anuary
1968.
Since then, there have been 169
heart transplants at the Medical
Center, he said. Seventy of those pa
tients are still living, with one man
celebrating his ninth year with his
second heart.
More heart transplant patients will
survive in the future, Reitz said, be
cause "significant improvements
in familiarity with the operation''
have been developed in the last five
years.
Today, he said, a heart transplant
patient has a 65 percent chance of

surviving one year, and a 50 percent
chance of surviving five years.
The patients' chances are also en
hanced by the 50 members of the
heart transplant team, including six
cardiologists and six surgeons, im
munologists and other technicians.
At each operation, Reitz said, the
team provides four surgeons, one
nurse, two anesthesiologists and two
technicians to operate the heart-lung
machine that keeps the patient alive.
The average cost of a heart trans
plant operaton is $40,000 which in
cludes an average recovery stay in
the hospital of about three months.
Private insurance covers about one
half of the cost of the operations,
Reitz said, while research grants
from the National Institutes of Health
cover the other half.
Reitz credited the Universal
Anatomical Gift Act of 1970 with pro
viding enough donor hearts for
transplanting. Under the act, a
neurologist can declare a person leg
ally dead when their brain ceases
functioning. This makes their heart
available for transplanting if the next
of kin approve.
"The general sophistication of soc
iety" has families of such individuals
offering the deceased's heart for
transplanting, Reitz said.
"The families of people who have
been declared legally dead often in
itiate the action," he said. "In fact, 50
percent of the donor referrals are
families who have suggested to their
doctor that maybe the heart could go
to someone else."
