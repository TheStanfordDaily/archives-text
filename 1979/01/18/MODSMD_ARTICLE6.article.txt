# Economist foresees bright future for U.S. economy and trade
## 
### KATHY ANDREWS RICHARD SHAMES 
Despite gloomy predictions
made recently by many
economists, international
economist Robert Gomperts,
said Tuesday he remains op
timistic about the American
economy and its role in inter
national trade.
Speaking before an audi
ence of about 50 at the Bechtel
Center, Gomperts, currently
president of Nordisk Andels
forbund, the West Coast buy
ing office for Scandinavian
consumer cooperatives,
explained that reporting on the
state of the economy is "a little
bit on the level of a healthy
person who takes his tempera
ture every half hour, finds his
temperature one degree above

normal at four o'clock in the
morning and says, My God,
I'm sick.'"
Gomperts, former president
of the California Council for In
ternational Trade, assured the
audience that the American
economy is "fantastically
strong."
The current devaluation of
the dollar is no cause for great
concern, Gomperts said. He
explained that from the post-
World War II period through
the early 19705, the dollar had a
highly unrealistic and inflexi
ble value. Until two months
ago, the dollar had maintained
a reasonable ratio relative to
other currencies. The dollar
will rise again through the play
of the market, according to
Gomperts.

He predicted that the U.S.
trade deficit, now at $30 billion,
also will improve. It could pos
sibly drop to $10 billion by the
1980s, he added.
"It's a deficit that has to be
watched, but we can live with
it. We're about the only coun
try that can," Gomperts said.
He attributed the deficit to a
variety of sources, most of
which have corrected them
selves. Persisting problems in
ch ie the high level of pet
rol. m imports and their con
sumption, along with Ameri
can manufacturers' lack of in
itiative to sell abroad, Gom
perts said.
World slow-down
In addition, the effects of the
1975 world economic slow
down are hindering interna

tional trade, according to
Gomperts. Unlike the United
States, other developed coun
tries have not recovered from
the recession. Thus, the Un
ited States is now a tremend
ous market for imports but
lacks trading partners for its
exports.
While predicting that the
trade gap will undergo a sub
stantial narrowing, Gomperts
cautioned that the United
States must not allow itself to
become what he called a trade
imperialist.
"A trade deficit is not only
healthy but required to keep
the rest of the world moving
along," said Gomperts.
American industries are as
suming a more active role in
international trade out of

necessity rather than choice,
he continued.
The level of the United States'
competition in international
trade is determined primarily
by its interest, said Gomperts.
He said that until 10 years
ago, only about 7 percent of
the U.S. Gross National Pro
duct (GNP) was from interna
tional trade. China and the
Soviet Union were the only
other nations with as little as a 7
percent investment.
Today, international invest
ments in all three countries
have risen to about 15 percent
of the GNP — which is still a
low figure relative to certain
West European countries in
vestments, Gomperts added.
Less self sufficient
He attrituted the increases to
the realization by "giant
land-mass countries that they
are not as self-sufficient as they
used to be."
He added, however, that the

15 percent figure is a mislead
ing statistic.
"Our GNP is so absolutely
overwhelmingly large com
pared to other countries' that
we are by far the largest inter
national trading country in the
world. This gives a clue to why
we can compete and do as well
as we want," Gomperts said.
'Adventurous' businessmen
One block to international
trade cited by Gomperts is that
only what he called "adventur
ous" American businessmen
are willing to sell products ab
road. Most are discouraged by
language barriers, foreign cur
rencies and freight problems.
Also, American businessmen
traditionally look first to their
stable domestic market for
sales.
"The question is: how hard
are American businessmen
working on exporting? The
answer is not hard enough,"
Gomperts said.
In an effort to raise the con

sciousness of California
businessmen, as well as that of
legislators and laborers in the
international trade industry,
Gomperts and Sen. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
have launched "The Trade
Awareness Project." The pro
ject is designed to identify the
number of jobs in Calfornia
that depend on international
trade, Gomperts explained.
Many jobs
"I think we are going to find
out that a great many more jobs
depend on international trade
than has ever been thought
possible," Gomperts said.
For example, he said that the
California almond industry —
which supplies 50 to 70 percent
of the world's almond crop —
exports most of its yield each
year.
"California agricultural in
dustries would simply die
without international trade,"
Gomperts said.
