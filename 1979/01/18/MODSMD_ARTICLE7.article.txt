Surrealist poet and writer Sotere Torregian presented a reading of some of his works yesterday,
including "On the Birthday of Huey P. Newton: For the Freedom of all Political Prisoners," from
his The Age of Gold collection. Torregian served as research assistant in the Afro-American
Studies Department here from 1968 to 1973.
