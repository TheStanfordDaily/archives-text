## Racquetball popularity surge here

"It's great exercise." "It helps keep the
weight down." "It helps me work my ag
gression out and it's fun!" Is it running? Is
it yoga? Is it some other laid-back, mellow
California sport? No.
It is racquetball, and the sport has found
its outlet here in the Stanford Racquetball
Club. R-ball enthusiasts here can now join
the increasing number of people playing
organized racquetball.
Once a sport primarily of the wealthy,
racquetball has enjoyed a surge of popu
larity in recent years. According to Bill Au
stin, professional racquetball player and
coach-instructor for the Stanford Rac
quetball Club, "Racquetball is the fastest
growing sport in the country." Here rac
quetball seems particulaly popular during
winter quarter. Staff members at De-
Cuerre Courts, site of the University's four
racquetball-squash courts, report court
usage now is significantly higher than last
spring and seems to be growing. Accord
ing to staffers at the courts, court times are
booked full within an hour after the reser
vation desk opens each morning.
In light of the growing enthusiasm for
the sport, eight students and community
members here formed a racquetball club
last winter. Originally organized as a
round robin tournament at DeCuerre
Courts, these enthusiasts obtained Athle
tic Department permission to form a Uni-'
versity club. Membership rose to its pre
sent total of 32 players, half of whom are

female.
According to the club's acting vice
president, junior Kelly McDonough, "The
purpose of the racquetball club is to pro
mote the sport and to allow people who
like racquetball to find people of their
level to play with."
The club, financed by student member
ship dues and University funds, has sole
use of DeCuerre Courts each morning.
Members, therefore, have unrestricted
playing opportunities.
In addition to morning play, club offic
ers have planned several weekend instruc
tion clinics, various inter-club and inter
scholastic tournaments and numerous so
cial and fund-raising activities.
Already well-established in such fields
as squash, rugby and lacrosse, sports
clubs are beginning to dominate the game
of racquetball. A growing number of
California schools, in eluding UC-
Berkeley, UC-Santa Barbara, and Univer
sity of Santa Clara, have racquetball clubs,
and many of these clubs compete inter
scholastically. A club, distinct from a var
sity sport, does not restrict its membership
to specific students and is not subject to
various National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (NCAA) regulations. The Stan
ford Racquetball Club is open to all stu
dents, faculty and staff members.
For the skilled and strongly motivated
players, the racquetball club will sponsora
traveling team. An elimination tourna
ment between club members will decide

team members, ihe learn win participate
in at least eight scheduled inter-scholastic
matches and several tournaments. Austin
will coach the team and will also serve as
general instructor to all club members.
Coach-instructor Austin said there will be
12 men and six women on the team which
eventually hopes to become NCAA
sanctioned.
"There's excellent potential here. I like
the attitude of the Stanford people. They
have fine intellectual abilities and that's
important in a mental game like racquet
ball," Austin said. The 18 team players will
be subject to challenges trom other club
members and will practice daily at Sup
reme Courts, a Palo Alto racquetball club.
"These players have to lie dedicated and
want to win," added Austin.
In addition to team matches with other
schools, the racquetball club will sponsor
several club meets with other schools,
thus allowing interested club members to
play inter-collegiately. Currently
scheduled club meets include matches
with University of Santa Clara, San Jose
University, and UC-Santa Barbara.
For a $15 quarterly fee, club members
obtain several benefits. In addition to un
restricted use of DeCuerre Courts during
club hours, members receive a discount at
the Stanford Sports Shop and an oppor
tunity to play ipter-collegiately at the team
or club level. Club members also obtain
pertinent information concerning local
tournaments, clinics and clubs.
