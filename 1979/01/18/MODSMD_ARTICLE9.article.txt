# Historical accounts depict ancient griffin legend, myth
## 
### ROBERT REED 
"But what is a griffin?" asks a contused stu
dent here.
Since the University dropped the "Indian" as
its mascot in 1972, controversy has risen over
what should replace it. A name that has rallied
frequent support in the discussions is the "grif
fin."
However, many students and boosters know
little about the griffin.
Proposal
With the ASSU Senate proposing a spring
quarter mascot election, in which the griffin may
be the top choice, students may want to learn
about the mythical creature.
Most historians agree that the griftin is a crea
ture with the head of a bird — usually an eagle
— and the body of a lion. Despite this agree
ment, opinions vary about the form of other
griffin appendages and functions.
Mvth and legend
Many historians and scholars say the griffin
has the wings of an eagle, but some disagree.
Otten the griffin is pictured with a serpent's tail,
but it may be pictured just as otten with the tail
of a lion.
The ancient Asiatic griffin was said to have a
crested head while the Minoan and Greek grif
fins were seen with a mane of spiraled curls. 1 he
ancient Persians often pictured their griffin with
the horns of a goat or a ram.
The griffin, a minor figure in classical and
eastern mythology, probably originating in the
eastern Mediterranean in the second millenium
8.C., had spread throughout western Asia into
Greece by the 14th century B.C.
The ancient Greeks thought of the griffin as
sacred, hence it often appeared in sanctuary and
tomb furnishings. However, its precise nature
and place in cult and legend remains unclear.
Griffins are also mentioned in ancient Indian
legend as guardians of gold mines.
Of the Golden State
These associations of the griffin with gold and
gold protection helped an old Spanish novelist
create the legend that has tied the griffin to the
golden state, California.
In Las Sergasde Esplandian, written about 1500
X.D., Garci Ordonez de Montalvo, makes sev
jral references to griffins and an Amazon island
railed California.
When in the novel, the hero Esplandian was

defending Constantinople against the attack of
several pagan armies, Calafia, Queen of Califor
nia, appeared.
California, Montalvo wrote, was an island in
habited by black women in an area of the world
on the "right hand side of the Indies and very
near to terrestrial paradise."
According to Montalvo, the weapons of the
Californians were golden.
Also in California, according to Montalvo,
"there were many griffins."
When the griffins were small, the women
trapped them, took them home and raised
them. The creatures ate the flesh of the prison
ers the Californians had taken
For battle, these "monstrous birds" were
trained to seize men from the ground and drop
them from great heights.
At Constantinople, Calafia freed her griffins,
but her maneuver failed because the creatures
attacked the soldiers of both armies indiscrimi
nately.
Calafia was captured. She converted to Christ
ianity and married a relative of Esplandian. His
torians don't know what happened to the grif
fins.
Senate action
One of the criteria for ASSU senate approval
of a mascot nominee is that it have relevance to
the University. Except for two griffin statues,
now sitting in front of Encina Gym, there seem
to be few historical ties between the griffin and
the University.
According to |oe Davies, member of Friends
of the Stantord Griffins, a group urging adop
tion of the griffin as a mascot, "The historical
link is that the Stanfords themselves brought it
over with them from Europe." But, he added,
"The major reason we're pushing the Griffin is
that it is such a powerful symbol and such a good
mascot for the athletes." The griffin can be
ferocious at times while also symbolizing wis
dom and courage, a quality desired in athletes,
Davies said.
Probably because of its fierce appearance,
many have equated the griffin with the devil, or
a facsimile thereof. However, the griffin is more
often represented as a symbol of the divine
unity — of truth, wisdom, vigilance and
strength.
But is it a good mascot or a bad mascot? Is it a
single, solid and solitary symbol that the Univer
sity can rally behind? Who knows...

has mythical significance to California, historians find no partit ular relationship between the University
and the griffin.
"But what is a griffin?" asks a contused stu
dent here.
Since the University dropped the "Indian" as
its mascot in 1972, controversy has risen over
what should replace it. A name that has rallied
frequent support in the discussions is the "grif
fin."
However, many students and boosters know
little about the griffin.
Proposal
With the ASSU Senate proposing a spring
quarter mascot election, in which the griffin may
be the top choice, students may want to learn
about the mythical creature.
Most historians agree that the griftin is a crea
ture with the head of a bird — usually an eagle
— and the body of a lion. Despite this agree
ment, opinions vary about the form of other
griffin appendages and functions.
Mvth and legend
Many historians and scholars say the griffin
has the wings of an eagle, but some disagree.
Otten the griffin is pictured with a serpent's tail,
but it may be pictured just as otten with the tail
of a lion.
The ancient Asiatic griffin was said to have a
crested head while the Minoan and Greek grif
fins were seen with a mane of spiraled curls. 1 he
ancient Persians often pictured their griffin with
the horns of a goat or a ram.
The griffin, a minor figure in classical and
eastern mythology, probably originating in the
eastern Mediterranean in the second millenium
8.C., had spread throughout western Asia into
Greece by the 14th century B.C.
The ancient Greeks thought of the griffin as
sacred, hence it often appeared in sanctuary and
tomb furnishings. However, its precise nature
and place in cult and legend remains unclear.
Griffins are also mentioned in ancient Indian
legend as guardians of gold mines.
Of the Golden State
These associations of the griffin with gold and
gold protection helped an old Spanish novelist
create the legend that has tied the griffin to the
golden state, California.
In Las Sergasde Esplandian, written about 1500
X.D., Garci Ordonez de Montalvo, makes sev
jral references to griffins and an Amazon island
railed California.
When in the novel, the hero Esplandian was

defending Constantinople against the attack of
several pagan armies, Calafia, Queen of Califor
nia, appeared.
California, Montalvo wrote, was an island in
habited by black women in an area of the world
on the "right hand side of the Indies and very
near to terrestrial paradise."
According to Montalvo, the weapons of the
Californians were golden.
Also in California, according to Montalvo,
"there were many griffins."
When the griffins were small, the women
trapped them, took them home and raised
them. The creatures ate the flesh of the prison
ers the Californians had taken
For battle, these "monstrous birds" were
trained to seize men from the ground and drop
them from great heights.
At Constantinople, Calafia freed her griffins,
but her maneuver failed because the creatures
attacked the soldiers of both armies indiscrimi
nately.
Calafia was captured. She converted to Christ
ianity and married a relative of Esplandian. His
torians don't know what happened to the grif
fins.
Senate action
One of the criteria for ASSU senate approval
of a mascot nominee is that it have relevance to
the University. Except for two griffin statues,
now sitting in front of Encina Gym, there seem
to be few historical ties between the griffin and
the University.
According to |oe Davies, member of Friends
of the Stantord Griffins, a group urging adop
tion of the griffin as a mascot, "The historical
link is that the Stanfords themselves brought it
over with them from Europe." But, he added,
"The major reason we're pushing the Griffin is
that it is such a powerful symbol and such a good
mascot for the athletes." The griffin can be
ferocious at times while also symbolizing wis
dom and courage, a quality desired in athletes,
Davies said.
Probably because of its fierce appearance,
many have equated the griffin with the devil, or
a facsimile thereof. However, the griffin is more
often represented as a symbol of the divine
unity — of truth, wisdom, vigilance and
strength.
But is it a good mascot or a bad mascot? Is it a
single, solid and solitary symbol that the Univer
sity can rally behind? Who knows...
