# Winter beach fun
## 
### 
Okay, so it's winter quarter
and you've promised yourself
(and your parents) that you're
going to ace those 20 units by
hitting the books from January
to March.
But like many students here
somtime about the third week
into the quarter you're going to
start searching for ways to
avoid reading Joyce or com
pleting that physics problem
set.
Why not go to the beach?
Remember, this is California
and people are allowed to get
away with doing things like
that. In fact, the winter months
offer some of the best weather
at the northern California
beaches. There are more clear
days (between the storms) now
than in the summer.
The San Mateo County
coastline features 56 miles of
great beaches, most within a
45-minute drive of the Univer
sity campus. The most popular
beaches are Half Moon Bay,
San Gregorio and Pescadero.
But Highway 1, which runs
along the coast, provides
plenty of places to pull over
and walk, climb or scale your
way down to less crowded
stretches of sand.
Winter beach trips can be
imaginative. Since you're
probably not gong to want to
stretch out in a bathing suit
with suntan lotion and a radio,
you might want to look for
something to do. Here are
some ideas:
A popular seasonal attrac
tion is the elephant seals,

which come to the dunes of
Ano Nuevo State Reserve from
December through March to
mate and molt. At this time the
beach is closed to the public,
but 2'/i-hour tours are offered
by students from UC-Santa
Cruz. Reservations are re
quired for the 3-mile hike.
Several stables on the north
ern part of the coast rent
horses and all have trail access
for beach riding. Prices range
from $5 to $6.50 an hour. Con
tact the following for more in
formation:
Friendly Acres, Half Moon Bay
Mar Vista Riding Academy,
Daly City
Palo Mar Stables, Daly City
Sea Horse Ranch, Half Moon
Bay
Fishing — from surfcasting
to mussel gathering — is espe
cially good at this time of year.
But remember that unless you
are fishing from a pier or are
under 16, you need a license.

on where and when to go,
check How to Fish the Pacific
Coast, by Ray Cannon.
Picnicking, anywhere. Thor
ton, Fitzgerald Marine Reserve
at Moss Beach and Half Moon
Bay at Francis Beach provide
tables, firepits, restrooms and
water. San Cregorio, Pom
ponio, and Bean Hollow have
tables but no water.
Camping is possible at Half
Moon Bay's Francis Beach, the
only official camping area, for
$4 a night.
You might want to watch
hang gliding, which is popular

on the high cliffs of Thorton
Beach. The steady winds here
are also great for kite flying.
For more information con
cerning any of the local
beaches, the headquarters for
the San Mateo Coast State
Beaches is located in Half
Moon Bay. It is open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. to
4:30 p.m.


San Mateo County's Coast
stretches 56 miles from San
Francisco to just below Ano
Nuevo.
