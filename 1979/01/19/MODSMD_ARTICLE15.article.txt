Wars never really end. The
actual fighting may stop with a
peace treaty signed, but for
many the pain and suffering
continues.
Although the Vietnam War
ended almost four years ago,
for many — too many — the
ravage of those terrible years
has never ceased. Countless
thousands of Vietnamese are
missing one or more of their
limbs, while others bear the
scars of skin disfigured by
napalm.
In our own country,
thousands of Vietnam veterans
cannot find a job. As the recent
film Coming Home depicted,
many other veterans, doomed
never to walk again, are forced
to call a hospital a home.
The veterans portrayed in
Coming Home are young
men cut down in the prime of
their lives, victims of the
American effort to win the
hearts and minds of the people
of Southeast Asia.
But there are other veterans
who left Vietnam in one piece,
only to join the list of dead or
disabled at a later date. These
are men who regularly
breathed the chemical de
foliants, such as Agent Orange,
with which American forces
sought to destroy the hiding
places that the countryside
provided opposition guerillas.
The gas they inhaled had no
immediate effect, but little by
little it began to destroy their
bodies. Some have suffered
severe cases of weight loss or
acne; others have had de
formed children; others have
died from cancer.
Agent Orange finally caught
up with Paul Reutershan last
month in a Connecticut hos
pital, where he died of

stomach cancer. A decade ago
he was the crew chief on an
Army helicopter in Vietnam
and often flew through heavy
mists of Agent Orange, made
by the Dow Chemical Com
pany, which also manufac
tured napalm.
After Reutershan left the
Army, he began having
stomach problems. A year ago
he found he had stomach
cancer. Claiming it was caused
by Agent Orange, he re
quested disability benefits
from the Veterans Administra
tion (VA). Reutershan also
joined with other veterans to
form a group called Agent
Orange Victims International
and sued Dow Chemical for
$10 million.
Not surprisingly, Dow has
denied that Agent Orange
poses any danger for humans,
despite much evidence to the
contrary. Meanwhile, the VA
rejected Reutershan's disabil
ity claim — as well as claims by
other veterans for defoliant
related illnesses — as it refused
to acknowledge the probable
carcinogenic nature of Agent
Orange.
Even as he lay dying in the
hospital last month, Reuter
shan was determined to pub
licize the effects of Agent
Orange.
He recognized he didn't
have much time left; two days
before he died, he told his
mother, "I got killed in Viet
nam and didn't know it."
It is said that old soldiers
never die, that they just fade
away. In Vietnam it was the
young soldiers who died at the
orders of the old ones. Many of
those who escaped death now
find themselves fading away in

hospitals, in unemployment
lines, or in the tumult of their
own minds.
Others, such as Reutershan,
also died without knowing it,
A simple pawn in the ugly
game of war, Reutershan left
behind notonlyagrievingfam
ily and fiancee, but also a
group of people determined to
publicize the dangers of Agent
Orange and to win benefits for
other veterans. His death
serves as a pognant reminder
that in many ways the Vietnam
war is still claiming its victims.
