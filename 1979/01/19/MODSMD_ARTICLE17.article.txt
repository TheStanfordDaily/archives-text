## Exercise in inhumane politics 
### 
The Southeast Asian policy of the Un
ited States has at times been maligned
as hypocritical and exploitative. This
opinion, stemming in part from opposi
tion to the Vietnam War, has not been
very well tested in the last five or six
years. Now, with the fall of Cambodia's
Khmer Rouge regime, U.S. Southeast
Asian policy is again in the spotlight.
Unfortunately, it reveals itself to be still
an exercise in inhumane weltpolitik.
The official U.S. line on the Cambo
dian war is roughly this: while Cam
bodia under the regime of Premier Pol
Pot had little or no respect for human
rights, its territorial integrity must be
respected. Therefore, the United States
condemns the invasion of Vietnamese
troops and demands the removal of all
foreign forces.
What about the Cambodia of the
Khmer Rouge? Conservative estimates
say that hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians have been murdered by
their government. Even Pol Pot could
not deny the killings in a recent inter
view with Western correspondents.

Cambodia was a country with no cur
rency, no mail, savage repression and
even a near ban on marriage. Punish
ment for sex outside of marriage was
execution.
In short, the Pol Pot regime was
probably the most hideous national
government the world has seen since
1945. Vietnam is Disneyland by com
parison.
One must wonder why the United
States would have a policy which in ef
fect states that we may wag scornful
fingers at the butchers of Cambodia,
but any more forceful action against
them is wrong. It is their business and
their borders. Borders did not stop the
United States from invading Cambodia
in 1970, of course, but that was diffe
rent. Cambodia was neutral then. This
time, Cambodia was a belligerent.
Cambodia had begun a war with Vie
tnam last year over a disputed piece of
territory known as the Parrot's Beak.
After a rain delay, Vietnam pursued the
war to what may become a total victory.

Realizing that countries who begin wars
run the risk of losing them, why does
the United States line up with the
ousted Khmer Rouge?
The answer, of course, is the Chinese
connection. U.S. policy-makers seem
to be so enthralled with our new ties to
the People's Republic of China that
they have been slavishly following Chi
na's line in Southeast Asia although
they have not yet called for the unifica
tion of Korea under Kim II Sung.
They do this, it must be supposed,
because of the points they feel the Uni
ted States scores against the Soviet Un
ion. Let the Soviets feel the heat for a
while. Then we in the United States can
smile modestly as the Chinese ex
coriate the Soviets, which they do so
well and chuckle over our ingenuity at
driving a wedge between the two
communist superpowers.
In any event, Chinese imperialism is
preferable to the Soviet variety. Once
this is realized to be central to U.S.
Southeast Asian policy, it can be under
stood how the United States could ig

nore both the slaughter of Cambodians
and the moral debt which we will prob
ably never make up to the Vietnamese
people.
Lost in the shuffle of U.S. policy pa
pers is the fact that the lot of the Cambo
dian people should improve markedly
under the new regime. The Soviets
claim that the fall of the Pol Pot clique is
welcomed by millions throughout the
world.
It should be. How pathetic that the
Soviet Union should be on the side of
human rights in an international con
flict, with the United States ostensibly
on the side of border integrity.
If the human rights policy sporadi
cally pursued by the Carter administra
tion means anything, it should mean
that human life is more precious than
lines on a map. Or must it be that such a
precept is simply incompatible with the
necessities of present-day superpower
politics?
