## Press misrepresents religion issue in Iran 
### 
I was extremely disturbed
when I read the Associated
Press report "Mullah: influen
tial Moslem clergymen" (Daily,
)an. 9). To describe the influ
ence of the mullah on the Ira
nian people, the report in
cluded sentences like: "The
mullah have been spotted on
the fringes of mobs swirling
through the bazaar," "In the
Moslem clergyman's world,
the faithful are obliged to give
20 percent of their income to
support the clergy" and "Re
ligious teachers say successful

mullah with large followings
are usually clever amateur
psychologists with the ability
to sway the devout."
The mullah were portrayed
in the report as senseless
seditionaries deceiving, agitat
ing and exploiting innocent
people. Such analysis can
serve only two purposes: to
cover the real motives behind
the struggle of the Iranian Mos
lem people and indirectly to at
tack the religion of Islam.
The news media habitually
uses such tactics in analyzing

the situation in Iran. Sentences
like "Moslems are against
modernization" and "An Is
lamic government in Iran will
push it hack centuries in time"
frequently appear in different
news reports.
In order to understand why
Moslems are shedding their
biood on the streets of Iran, we
need to know some facts about
the Islamic religion.
Islam is not against building
factories or using cars, planes,
calculators or computers.
Islam is against building

houses for prostitution and
gambling near factories. Islam
is against corruption, social in
justice and exploitation of man
by other men. Islam encour
ages benefitting from modern
technology but rejects the
flaws of other civilizations.
Islam is not only a religion
but a complete way of life that
has to be applied as a whole.
Ayatullah Khomaini knows that
if such a system could be
applied again, the Iranian
people would suffer no more.

Certain merits of Islam are
mentioned here as simple
facts. Unfortunately these
claims cannot be substantiated
by examples from real life be
cause although Islam as a belief
for individuals still exists and
Moslems do exist, Islam as a
total way of life has completely
disappeared even from those
countries which are supposed
to be Islamic.
