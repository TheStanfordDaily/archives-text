Vicious accusation
Since the Holocaust, an ac
cusation of anti-semitism has
been a deadly serious matter. I
am therefore deeply angered
by David LeVine';, claim (Daily,
Jan. 16) that there were "anti
semitic overtones" in my col
umn on the Mideast (Daily, Jan.
10). I challenge LeVine to pro
duce a single shred of evidence
or reasoning to support this
groundless and vicious accusa
tion.
In general, LeVine's at
tempts at reasoning betray a
marvelous ineptitude.
For example, Sunday "Blue
Laws" in the United States
should of course be repealed:
such laws are wrong and vio
late the principle of separation
of church and state. LeVine's
contention that the assent of
the majority justifies such un
just laws is absurd: would
LeVine condone the Holocaust
if it were shown that a majority
of Germans supported
genocide of the Jews?
Furthermore, religious
based or ethnic-based laws in
America, though unjust, are far
less oppressive than are such
laws in Israel. There is no
Ministry of Religious Affairs in
America; American religious
organizations are not integ
rated into the government and
allowed to perform certain
governmental functions.
Nor do religious-based laws
in America generally serve as
tools by which one ethnic
group asserts its supremacy
over another.
LeVine is similarly muddled
in discussing the issue of sto
len Arab property. The fact is
that in 1947 and 1948 approxi
mately 600,000 Palestinian
Arabs fled from their homes
because of the conflict and war
which accompanied the estab

lishment of the state of Israel.
Israel has steadfastly refused
to allow most of these refugees
to return and has expropriated
their land, homes and prop
erty. It is difficult to see how
LeVine can deny that such ex
propriation constitutes theft —
unless LeVine believes that any
violation of human rights by
the Israeli state should be over
looked.
LeVine declares himself
"appalled" by my "faulty his
torical research." In fact, I was
once a supporter of Israel until
I learned some details concern
ing Israeli history and society.
If LeVine is ever willing to
submit his preconceived ideas
to the test of facts and logic,
even he might achieve a ba
lanced view of the Mideast
conflict.
Let us eschew both anti
semitism and the converse of
anti-semitism exhibited by
LeVine. Jews or Israelis are
simply people. Let us judge
their actions by the same stan
dards and principles which we
apply to everyone else.

I agree with Gil Morales' cri
tics who claim his cartoons
about rape contribute to the
sexual objectification and vio
lation of women rather than
exposing sexism through
humor, as he implies in his re
sponse (Daily, Jan. 10).
Morales' efforts to defend
himself fall flat. His counterat
tack betrays hostility toward
feminists ("delusions of perse
cution" tells more about
Morales than those he ac
cuses); moreover, his intima
tion that he has a sophisticated
satirical approach to the prob

lem of sexism gains little by his
comparing himself with the
creators of Archie Bunker. Nor
is it born out by his cartoon
strips.
If Morales has a political
analysis of rape, he has not ex
pressed it through his car
toons. Rather, he has offended
both women and men on cam
pus and reacted to criticism by
ignoring the heart of the issue.
I cannot help but wonder if
he would find rape so humor
ous if he were at risk. I am sad
that he could not appreciate
the anger of his critics and
learn from it to rethink his posi
tions about rape and about the
uses of humor.

Energy action
The University's energy bill
is rising every year. It totals
millions of dollars annually and
should be a cause of concern
to students and faculty. It is a
major contributor to rising tui
tion costs.
There is great controversy
and confusion about energy
sources today: is nuclear
power worth the danger? What
are the real costs and impacts
of gasified coal and oil shale?
What are the potentials and
costs of conservation, solar
and wind power, recycling and
biomass energy?
We are helping to organize a
group to study energy issues
called Stanford Energy Action.
We will also work to make sure
that the University's new dor
mitory is constructed in an
energy-efficient manner, using
"passive solar" design which
can accommodate solar collec
tors. We are working with
Energy Conservation Director
Karl Johnson to suggest ar

chitects who have worked with
such designs.
We are also going to or
ganize, an "Energy Week" in
April which will include speak
ers, distribution of information
and political action.
SEA needs your support. We
hope everyone will get in
volved.

Guano for Mattson
I frequently disagree with
Daily movie reviews. That has
never bothered me much,
though, because it is true that
people seldom ever agree on
what is good or bad about a
particular film. But I must say
that )im Mattson's critiques
reached an irksome level of ab
surdity when he rated Midnight
Express with a guano while
awarding Invasion of the Body
Snatchers the coveted four stars
{Daily, Jan. 12).
Mattson refers to Midnight
Express as . . the first
mainstream excursion into
sado-masochism." Granted,
this film does have several
graphic, violentscenes. Yet un
like so many other movies
which exploit violence for vio
lence's own sake, Midnight Ex
press' intensity is there for a
much more admirable reason.
The violence in this movie is
only as vulgar as the injustice
which causes it.
In this case, violence is used
to convey a statement about
how cruel and inhumane the
Turkish justice system was to
Billy Hayes, an American
(notice that I do not include the
irrelevant and suggestive de
scription "college dropout")
convicted for possessing two
kilos of hashish.
Mattson calls the movie

"rabid cinema." How ludicr
ous! The film is based on a true
story. Midnight Express is
merely a reflection of some of
the barbarous and unmerciful
characteristics that humanity
so often displays. Criticizing
the violence in Midnight Express
is like criticizing the violence in
photographs of Auschwitz.
Mattson was apparently so
overcome by his simplistic
view of the violence in this
movie that he forgot to recog
nize the film's sensitive charac
terizations, such as well
controlled pacing and pur
poseful use of sound. Midnight
Express is "about something,"
it is well made, and it is defi
nitely worth seeing.
If the Daily is going to con
tinue to reprint Mattson's re
view of Midnight Express, 11 hi n k
that they should include a
rather large and ugly black
splotch next to his name.

Support for choice
Three cheers for Charles
Hoard who finally said the
words so many of us have been
thinking {Daily, )an. 16).
Hoard's simple but exact reply
to David Hayes' anti-choice
column {Daily, )an. 8) echoes
the feelings many of us have
when abortion is condemned
by men on moral grounds:
how can these men, who will
never experience the shock of
unwanted pregnancy, deign to
sit in judgment?
At best, men can hope to
understand, as Hoard seems
to, the complexity and pain of
the situation. They may also be i
obliged to support their j
women friends in whatever j
decisions the women make, if'
necessary.

But, of course, the men who
write articles condemning the
choice of abortion never "in
dulge" in sex, and, naturally
theywouldall bewillingtotake
on the responsibility of an un
wanted child should one be
conceived whether by rape,
incest, failing contraception or
whatever. Thanks, Hoard for
putting these men in their
place.
In order to express support
tor choice, commemorate the
Supreme Court decision that
legalized abortion, and raise
public awareness of abortion
issues, we have chosen Mon

day, Jan. 22 as a Day of Sup
port.
This will be a time to learn
the facts, understand the op
tions available to women and
show support for choice.
There will be speakers, thea-
letter-writing activities and
a potluck reception for all rally
participants and others that
evening.
I extend an open invitation
to all who do not sit in judg
ment but stand in support, to
join with us next Monday.

Guano for Mattson
I frequently disagree with
Daily movie reviews. That has
never bothered me much,
though, because it is true that
people seldom ever agree on
what is good or bad about a
particular film. But I must say
that )im Mattson's critiques
reached an irksome level of ab
surdity when he rated Midnight
Express with a guano while
awarding Invasion of the Body
Snatchers the coveted four stars
{Daily, Jan. 12).
Mattson refers to Midnight
Express as . . the first
mainstream excursion into
sado-masochism." Granted,
this film does have several
graphic, violentscenes. Yet un
like so many other movies
which exploit violence for vio
lence's own sake, Midnight Ex
press' intensity is there for a
much more admirable reason.
The violence in this movie is
only as vulgar as the injustice
which causes it.
In this case, violence is used
to convey a statement about
how cruel and inhumane the
Turkish justice system was to
Billy Hayes, an American
(notice that I do not include the
irrelevant and suggestive de
scription "college dropout")
convicted for possessing two
kilos of hashish.
Mattson calls the movie

"rabid cinema." How ludicr
ous! The film is based on a true
story. Midnight Express is
merely a reflection of some of
the barbarous and unmerciful
characteristics that humanity
so often displays. Criticizing
the violence in Midnight Express
is like criticizing the violence in
photographs of Auschwitz.
Mattson was apparently so
overcome by his simplistic
view of the violence in this
movie that he forgot to recog
nize the film's sensitive charac
terizations, such as well
controlled pacing and pur
poseful use of sound. Midnight
Express is "about something,"
it is well made, and it is defi
nitely worth seeing.
If the Daily is going to con
tinue to reprint Mattson's re
view of Midnight Express, 11 hi n k
that they should include a
rather large and ugly black
splotch next to his name.

Support for choice
Three cheers for Charles
Hoard who finally said the
words so many of us have been
thinking {Daily, )an. 16).
Hoard's simple but exact reply
to David Hayes' anti-choice
column {Daily, )an. 8) echoes
the feelings many of us have
when abortion is condemned
by men on moral grounds:
how can these men, who will
never experience the shock of
unwanted pregnancy, deign to
sit in judgment?
At best, men can hope to
understand, as Hoard seems
to, the complexity and pain of
the situation. They may also be i
obliged to support their j
women friends in whatever j
decisions the women make, if'
necessary.

But, of course, the men who
write articles condemning the
choice of abortion never "in
dulge" in sex, and, naturally
theywouldall bewillingtotake
on the responsibility of an un
wanted child should one be
conceived whether by rape,
incest, failing contraception or
whatever. Thanks, Hoard for
putting these men in their
place.
In order to express support
tor choice, commemorate the
Supreme Court decision that
legalized abortion, and raise
public awareness of abortion
issues, we have chosen Mon

day, Jan. 22 as a Day of Sup
port.
This will be a time to learn
the facts, understand the op
tions available to women and
show support for choice.
There will be speakers, thea-
letter-writing activities and
a potluck reception for all rally
participants and others that
evening.
I extend an open invitation
to all who do not sit in judg
ment but stand in support, to
join with us next Monday.

Vicious accusation
Since the Holocaust, an ac
cusation of anti-semitism has
been a deadly serious matter. I
am therefore deeply angered
by David LeVine';, claim (Daily,
Jan. 16) that there were "anti
semitic overtones" in my col
umn on the Mideast (Daily, Jan.
10). I challenge LeVine to pro
duce a single shred of evidence
or reasoning to support this
groundless and vicious accusa
tion.
In general, LeVine's at
tempts at reasoning betray a
marvelous ineptitude.
For example, Sunday "Blue
Laws" in the United States
should of course be repealed:
such laws are wrong and vio
late the principle of separation
of church and state. LeVine's
contention that the assent of
the majority justifies such un
just laws is absurd: would
LeVine condone the Holocaust
if it were shown that a majority
of Germans supported
genocide of the Jews?
Furthermore, religious
based or ethnic-based laws in
America, though unjust, are far
less oppressive than are such
laws in Israel. There is no
Ministry of Religious Affairs in
America; American religious
organizations are not integ
rated into the government and
allowed to perform certain
governmental functions.
Nor do religious-based laws
in America generally serve as
tools by which one ethnic
group asserts its supremacy
over another.
LeVine is similarly muddled
in discussing the issue of sto
len Arab property. The fact is
that in 1947 and 1948 approxi
mately 600,000 Palestinian
Arabs fled from their homes
because of the conflict and war
which accompanied the estab

lishment of the state of Israel.
Israel has steadfastly refused
to allow most of these refugees
to return and has expropriated
their land, homes and prop
erty. It is difficult to see how
LeVine can deny that such ex
propriation constitutes theft —
unless LeVine believes that any
violation of human rights by
the Israeli state should be over
looked.
LeVine declares himself
"appalled" by my "faulty his
torical research." In fact, I was
once a supporter of Israel until
I learned some details concern
ing Israeli history and society.
If LeVine is ever willing to
submit his preconceived ideas
to the test of facts and logic,
even he might achieve a ba
lanced view of the Mideast
conflict.
Let us eschew both anti
semitism and the converse of
anti-semitism exhibited by
LeVine. Jews or Israelis are
simply people. Let us judge
their actions by the same stan
dards and principles which we
apply to everyone else.

Flat defense
I agree with Gil Morales' cri
tics who claim his cartoons
about rape contribute to the
sexual objectification and vio
lation of women rather than
exposing sexism through
humor, as he implies in his re
sponse (Daily, Jan. 10).
Morales' efforts to defend
himself fall flat. His counterat
tack betrays hostility toward
feminists ("delusions of perse
cution" tells more about
Morales than those he ac
cuses); moreover, his intima
tion that he has a sophisticated
satirical approach to the prob

lem of sexism gains little by his
comparing himself with the
creators of Archie Bunker. Nor
is it born out by his cartoon
strips.
If Morales has a political
analysis of rape, he has not ex
pressed it through his car
toons. Rather, he has offended
both women and men on cam
pus and reacted to criticism by
ignoring the heart of the issue.
I cannot help but wonder if
he would find rape so humor
ous if he were at risk. I am sad
that he could not appreciate
the anger of his critics and
learn from it to rethink his posi
tions about rape and about the
uses of humor.

Energy action
The University's energy bill

should be a cause of concern
to students and faculty. It is a

There is great controversy
and confusion about energy
sources today: is nuclear
power worth the danger? What
are the real costs and impacts
of gasified coal and oil shale?
What are the potentials and
costs of conservation, solar

biomass energy?
We are helping to organize a

Vicious accusation
Since the Holocaust, an ac
cusation of anti-semitism has
been a deadly serious matter. I
am therefore deeply angered
by David LeVine';, claim (Daily,
Jan. 16) that there were "anti
semitic overtones" in my col
umn on the Mideast (Daily, Jan.
10). I challenge LeVine to pro
duce a single shred of evidence
or reasoning to support this
groundless and vicious accusa
tion.
In general, LeVine's at
tempts at reasoning betray a
marvelous ineptitude.
For example, Sunday "Blue
Laws" in the United States
should of course be repealed:
such laws are wrong and vio
late the principle of separation
of church and state. LeVine's
contention that the assent of
the majority justifies such un
just laws is absurd: would
LeVine condone the Holocaust
if it were shown that a majority
of Germans supported
genocide of the Jews?
Furthermore, religious
based or ethnic-based laws in
America, though unjust, are far
less oppressive than are such
laws in Israel. There is no
Ministry of Religious Affairs in
America; American religious
organizations are not integ
rated into the government and
allowed to perform certain
governmental functions.
Nor do religious-based laws
in America generally serve as
tools by which one ethnic
group asserts its supremacy
over another.
LeVine is similarly muddled
in discussing the issue of sto
len Arab property. The fact is
that in 1947 and 1948 approxi
mately 600,000 Palestinian
Arabs fled from their homes
because of the conflict and war
which accompanied the estab

lishment of the state of Israel.
Israel has steadfastly refused
to allow most of these refugees
to return and has expropriated
their land, homes and prop
erty. It is difficult to see how
LeVine can deny that such ex
propriation constitutes theft —
unless LeVine believes that any
violation of human rights by
the Israeli state should be over
looked.
LeVine declares himself
"appalled" by my "faulty his
torical research." In fact, I was
once a supporter of Israel until
I learned some details concern
ing Israeli history and society.
If LeVine is ever willing to
submit his preconceived ideas
to the test of facts and logic,
even he might achieve a ba
lanced view of the Mideast
conflict.
Let us eschew both anti
semitism and the converse of
anti-semitism exhibited by
LeVine. Jews or Israelis are
simply people. Let us judge
their actions by the same stan
dards and principles which we
apply to everyone else.

Flat defense
I agree with Gil Morales' cri
tics who claim his cartoons
about rape contribute to the
sexual objectification and vio
lation of women rather than
exposing sexism through
humor, as he implies in his re
sponse (Daily, Jan. 10).
Morales' efforts to defend
himself fall flat. His counterat
tack betrays hostility toward
feminists ("delusions of perse
cution" tells more about
Morales than those he ac
cuses); moreover, his intima
tion that he has a sophisticated
satirical approach to the prob

lem of sexism gains little by his
comparing himself with the
creators of Archie Bunker. Nor
is it born out by his cartoon
strips.
If Morales has a political
analysis of rape, he has not ex
pressed it through his car
toons. Rather, he has offended
both women and men on cam
pus and reacted to criticism by
ignoring the heart of the issue.
I cannot help but wonder if
he would find rape so humor
ous if he were at risk. I am sad
that he could not appreciate
the anger of his critics and
learn from it to rethink his posi
tions about rape and about the
uses of humor.

Energy action
The University's energy bill
is rising every year. It totals
millions of dollars annually and
should be a cause of concern
to students and faculty. It is a
major contributor to rising tui
tion costs.
There is great controversy
and confusion about energy
sources today: is nuclear
power worth the danger? What
are the real costs and impacts
of gasified coal and oil shale?
What are the potentials and
costs of conservation, solar
and wind power, recycling and
biomass energy?
We are helping to organize a
group to study energy issues
called Stanford Energy Action.
We will also work to make sure
that the University's new dor
mitory is constructed in an
energy-efficient manner, using
"passive solar" design which
can accommodate solar collec
tors. We are working with
Energy Conservation Director
Karl Johnson to suggest ar

chitects who have worked with
such designs.
We are also going to or
ganize, an "Energy Week" in
April which will include speak
ers, distribution of information
and political action.
SEA needs your support. We
hope everyone will get in
volved.

Guano for Mattson
I frequently disagree with
Daily movie reviews. That has
never bothered me much,
though, because it is true that
people seldom ever agree on
what is good or bad about a
particular film. But I must say
that )im Mattson's critiques
reached an irksome level of ab
surdity when he rated Midnight
Express with a guano while
awarding Invasion of the Body
Snatchers the coveted four stars
{Daily, Jan. 12).
Mattson refers to Midnight
Express as . . the first
mainstream excursion into
sado-masochism." Granted,
this film does have several
graphic, violentscenes. Yet un
like so many other movies
which exploit violence for vio
lence's own sake, Midnight Ex
press' intensity is there for a
much more admirable reason.
The violence in this movie is
only as vulgar as the injustice
which causes it.
In this case, violence is used
to convey a statement about
how cruel and inhumane the
Turkish justice system was to
Billy Hayes, an American
(notice that I do not include the
irrelevant and suggestive de
scription "college dropout")
convicted for possessing two
kilos of hashish.
Mattson calls the movie

"rabid cinema." How ludicr
ous! The film is based on a true
story. Midnight Express is
merely a reflection of some of
the barbarous and unmerciful
characteristics that humanity
so often displays. Criticizing
the violence in Midnight Express
is like criticizing the violence in
photographs of Auschwitz.
Mattson was apparently so
overcome by his simplistic
view of the violence in this
movie that he forgot to recog
nize the film's sensitive charac
terizations, such as well
controlled pacing and pur
poseful use of sound. Midnight
Express is "about something,"
it is well made, and it is defi
nitely worth seeing.
If the Daily is going to con
tinue to reprint Mattson's re
view of Midnight Express, 11 hi n k
that they should include a
rather large and ugly black
splotch next to his name.

Support for choice
Three cheers for Charles
Hoard who finally said the
words so many of us have been
thinking {Daily, )an. 16).
Hoard's simple but exact reply
to David Hayes' anti-choice
column {Daily, )an. 8) echoes
the feelings many of us have
when abortion is condemned
by men on moral grounds:
how can these men, who will
never experience the shock of
unwanted pregnancy, deign to
sit in judgment?
At best, men can hope to
understand, as Hoard seems
to, the complexity and pain of
the situation. They may also be i
obliged to support their j
women friends in whatever j
decisions the women make, if'
necessary.

But, of course, the men who
write articles condemning the
choice of abortion never "in
dulge" in sex, and, naturally
theywouldall bewillingtotake
on the responsibility of an un
wanted child should one be
conceived whether by rape,
incest, failing contraception or
whatever. Thanks, Hoard for
putting these men in their
place.
In order to express support
tor choice, commemorate the
Supreme Court decision that
legalized abortion, and raise
public awareness of abortion
issues, we have chosen Mon

day, Jan. 22 as a Day of Sup
port.
This will be a time to learn
the facts, understand the op
tions available to women and
show support for choice.
There will be speakers, thea-
letter-writing activities and
a potluck reception for all rally
participants and others that
evening.
I extend an open invitation
to all who do not sit in judg
ment but stand in support, to
join with us next Monday.
