# Faculty Senate discusses HEW guidelines, sabbatical policies
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
President Richard Lyman told the Faculty Senate yes
terday that he is optimistic the federal government's
new guidelines for recovering certain university re
search costs will not hit the nation's universities as. hard
as originally expected.
The guidelines were released last year, but after they
met strong opposition from universities nationwide, the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)
decided to reconsider its original proposal.
The ruling known as A-21 would make researchers
more strictly accountable for time spent on
government-sponsored research projects and stricter
regulations were put on the recovery of indirect costs.
University officials expressed fears that the University
would possibly lose millions of dollars, forcing cutbacks
in some areas.
Lyman, who recently met with Office of Management
and Budget officials in Washington, said that the
changes in the guidelines will not be primarily changes in
the actual wording, but rather in the interpretation of
the wording.
Lyman also said that HEW has asked for input on its
new directives concerning women's athletics at institu
tions which receive federal money. Lyman said the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has main
tained that unless federal money is used to support
athletic activities at universities, the activities should be
exempt from the requirements of Title IX — the federal

statute prohibiting sex discrimination in athletics.
Lyman said it is clear that these activities are not
exempt, as is evidenced by recent court rulings. He
added that Stanford is preparing a statement of its posi
tion and said the statement will "not follow the lines
followed by the NCAA statement."
In other business, senate member Harry Harding, an
assistant professor of political science, said he was con
cerned about recent changes in the University's leave of
absence and sabbatical policies. Last month, then-
Provost and Vice President William Miller altered some
sections of the policies.
The new acting provost and vice president, Gerald
Lieberman, called the changes minor, but Harding dis
agreed and added he was upset that no justification was
given for the changes.
There were two changes that Harding expressed par
ticular concern about.
Eirst, faculty members are now required to stay at the
University even though they may be up for sabbatical or
leave, if the department chairman — in conjunction with
the dean and provost — decide that the department is
badly in need of that professor's services for the coming
year. In such a case, leave time accumulates.
Second, faculty members used to be limited to 24
months of continuous leave. They are now limited to 24
months in a seven-year period.
Lieberman said exceptions might be allowed under
special circumstances.
