# Cal, UCLA come to Maples
## Gymnasts to tumble on 'Bears' 
### DEAN EYRE 
Whether you are a long-time
fan of gymnastics or a recent
convert, your opportunity for
an excellent entertainment
value arrives tonight at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion when
Stanford's gymnastics teams
host over two hours of compet
ition. Admission for adults is
$2, while students and children
are $1.
In the first of three such
combined meets, the women
take on Cal Poly Pomona and
the men go up against Califor
nia and UCLA. Both of Stan
ford's teams are decidedly
young, but it is this very factor
which promises to offer some
surprises for the spectators.
For coach Sadao Hamada's
men, the home showing be
gins a nine-meet season. He
said the 1979 squad has "a lot
more depth and a lot higher
skill level than last year. In
some events, like floor exer
cise, where we lost Ken Gor
man and Al Nemcek, we're
about the same as last year, but
in events where we were weak
last year, like parallel bars and
high bar, we are a lot
stronger."
Senior Chris Takimoto, who
along with Dan Wessner,
serves as co-captain said, "Per
sonally, I wish I had a little
more time — because of a
sprained tendon, I'm not in the
shape I'd like to be." Hamada
concurs, saying that "for the
first meet, I need about a week
or more, but I'll have all the
guys try their best and see from
there what we have to do."
In comparing Stanford with
the "bear" teams, Hamada
said, "I think we are pretty
close. I don't know too much
about how they're (UCLA and
Cal) doing yet. But Cal has
good all-around men and
specialists so they probably
will be tough to beat. With
UCLA I think it will be very
close."
"Berkeley is a dominant
force in gymnastics and should
challenge Oregon for the
Western regionals," Takimoto
said. "We're really looking
forward to it, especially an en
thusiastic crowd, and since it is
the first meet, seeing how the
team is. It will be interesting to
see how we do."
Although he has seven
freshmen on the team,
Hamada isn't particularly wor

ried about having a young
team. "In the competition I
may get some surprises — both
good and bad surprises. A
good one, of course, is some
one doing super well; or
someone can choke up and
miss their routine."
Primarily because of his
gymnasts'.attitude and self-dis
cipline, Hamada doesn't ex
pect much of the latter.
"My guys are pretty confi
dent because it has a lot to do
with intelligence," he said. "I
don't have to worry too much.
They just need more repetition
to get more confidence and ac
tually improve their skill level,
then they won't miss. If they
miss now, it's because they are
trying something a little too
hard for them, but that will
come with time.
"We have good all-around
men this year and depth and I
don't have to do anything to
keep them going because they
knowthey havetowork hard to
compete against each other in
a meet. That helps mea lot. The
whole attitude is different now
— we have a very good, unified
team this year."
For Stanford's women gym

nasts, the home meet presents
an opportunity to get on the
winning track after dropping a
pair of meets with strong
Arizona and Arizona State
teams last weekend.
Outscored 124.20 to 116.65
by Arizona and 132.45 to 111.00
by Arizona State, the Cards
were hurt not by talent, but by
the lack of depth. The nation
ally seventh-ranked Sun Devils
and the 17th-place Wild Cats
possess obvious depth in their
programs. The Stanford team,
consisting of four freshmen,
three sophomores and a
junior, has the talent, but the
depth isn't there — not yet. Be
fore the season's end, there'sa
good chance that will change.
Head coach Jackie Walker
explained that she scheduled
"some tough competition at
the very beginning of the sea
son to get the girls ready for the
rest of the season. They came
back very positive, all inspired
about room for improvement
in their routines and how the
team'sgoing todo. I think what
they saw is that there's not as
much difference between the
top teams and themselves."

Highlighting the trip was
Annie Smith's third place finish
in all-around competition
against Arizona, which she
earned by taking fourth in vau
lting and floor exercise and
third on the balance beam. The
night before, Smith earned
second place all-around with
seconds in floor exercise and
beam and thirds in vaulting and
the uneven parallel bars.
Karen Hall, forced out of
Saturday's meet because of an
irritated ligament in her left
hand, swept all-around honors
Friday night and won the vault
ing, beam and floor exercise
events. She also placed fourth
on bars.
"I was just really happy
about those outstanding per
formances — Annie Smith with
the best beam routine of her
life Friday and Jeanette Lacoste
on bars," said Walker. "(La
coste's) routines were basi
cally free of any mistakes — the
best I've seen her do all year.
She's a good competitor — she
did a much better routine both
nights than she does in prac
tice." Depending on the condi
tion of her knee, Lacoste may
be able to enter beam and floor
exercise competition.
As a junior, team captain
Linda Park is one of the squad's
veterans, and has "done an ex
cellent job of keeping
everyone's spirits up," accord
ing to Walker. "Cindy Sedlund
was very impressive in the way
she's becoming a competitor,"
she added. "Last year she was
very nervous for all of her
meets and at Arizona State on
balance beam it's the calmest
she's ever been. I think they all
matured a great deal this
weekend."
As for the prospects in to
night's meet, Walker said that
"depending on Karen's hand,
it could be a real close meet.
Cal Poly Pomona has been
scoring right around 110 to
115; without Karen we scored
111, and with her we scored
116, so I think we have a good
chance to win."
Also depending on Hall's
health, Julie Love's college
debut could be tonight. "If Ka
ren's healthy and in all-around,
then Julie will be a forerunner
(competing to "warm up" the
judges but not for an actual
score)," Walker said. "If Karen
is not in all the events, then
Julie will be competing."

said. "We're really looking
forward to it, especially an en
thusiastic crowd, and since it is
the first meet, seeing how the
team is. It will be interesting to
see how we do."
Although he has seven
freshmen on the team,
Hamada isn't particularly wor

ried about having a young
team. "In the competition I
may get some surprises — both
good and bad surprises. A
good one, of course, is some
one doing super well; or
someone can choke up and
miss their routine."
Primarily because of his
gymnasts'.attitude and self-dis
cipline, Hamada doesn't ex
pect much of the latter.
"My guys are pretty confi
dent because it has a lot to do
with intelligence," he said. "I
don't have to worry too much.
They just need more repetition
to get more confidence and ac
tually improve their skill level,
then they won't miss. If they
miss now, it's because they are
trying something a little too
hard for them, but that will
come with time.
"We have good all-around
men this year and depth and I
don't have to do anything to
keep them going because they
knowthey havetowork hard to
compete against each other in
a meet. That helps mea lot. The
whole attitude is different now
— we have a very good, unified
team this year."
For Stanford's women gym

nasts, the home meet presents
an opportunity to get on the
winning track after dropping a
pair of meets with strong
Arizona and Arizona State
teams last weekend.
Outscored 124.20 to 116.65
by Arizona and 132.45 to 111.00
by Arizona State, the Cards
were hurt not by talent, but by
the lack of depth. The nation
ally seventh-ranked Sun Devils
and the 17th-place Wild Cats
possess obvious depth in their
programs. The Stanford team,
consisting of four freshmen,
three sophomores and a
junior, has the talent, but the
depth isn't there — not yet. Be
fore the season's end, there'sa
good chance that will change.
Head coach Jackie Walker
explained that she scheduled
"some tough competition at
the very beginning of the sea
son to get the girls ready for the
rest of the season. They came
back very positive, all inspired
about room for improvement
in their routines and how the
team'sgoing todo. I think what
they saw is that there's not as
much difference between the
top teams and themselves."

Highlighting the trip was
Annie Smith's third place finish
in all-around competition
against Arizona, which she
earned by taking fourth in vau
lting and floor exercise and
third on the balance beam. The
night before, Smith earned
second place all-around with
seconds in floor exercise and
beam and thirds in vaulting and
the uneven parallel bars.
Karen Hall, forced out of
Saturday's meet because of an
irritated ligament in her left
hand, swept all-around honors
Friday night and won the vault
ing, beam and floor exercise
events. She also placed fourth
on bars.
"I was just really happy
about those outstanding per
formances — Annie Smith with
the best beam routine of her
life Friday and Jeanette Lacoste
on bars," said Walker. "(La
coste's) routines were basi
cally free of any mistakes — the
best I've seen her do all year.
She's a good competitor — she
did a much better routine both
nights than she does in prac
tice." Depending on the condi
tion of her knee, Lacoste may
be able to enter beam and floor
exercise competition.
As a junior, team captain
Linda Park is one of the squad's
veterans, and has "done an ex
cellent job of keeping
everyone's spirits up," accord
ing to Walker. "Cindy Sedlund
was very impressive in the way
she's becoming a competitor,"
she added. "Last year she was
very nervous for all of her
meets and at Arizona State on
balance beam it's the calmest
she's ever been. I think they all
matured a great deal this
weekend."
As for the prospects in to
night's meet, Walker said that
"depending on Karen's hand,
it could be a real close meet.
Cal Poly Pomona has been
scoring right around 110 to
115; without Karen we scored
111, and with her we scored
116, so I think we have a good
chance to win."
Also depending on Hall's
health, Julie Love's college
debut could be tonight. "If Ka
ren's healthy and in all-around,
then Julie will be a forerunner
(competing to "warm up" the
judges but not for an actual
score)," Walker said. "If Karen
is not in all the events, then
Julie will be competing."

RINGS SPECIALIST Dan Wessner combines the strength and form
needed for this difficult event. Wessner, a 5-foot-11 senior from
Highland Park, 111., will be one of the co-captains for the men's
gymnastic squad this season.
Whether you are a long-time
fan of gymnastics or a recent
convert, your opportunity for
an excellent entertainment
value arrives tonight at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion when
Stanford's gymnastics teams
host over two hours of compet
ition. Admission for adults is
$2, while students and children
are $1.
In the first of three such
combined meets, the women
take on Cal Poly Pomona and
the men go up against Califor
nia and UCLA. Both of Stan
ford's teams are decidedly
young, but it is this very factor
which promises to offer some
surprises for the spectators.
For coach Sadao Hamada's
men, the home showing be
gins a nine-meet season. He
said the 1979 squad has "a lot
more depth and a lot higher
skill level than last year. In
some events, like floor exer
cise, where we lost Ken Gor
man and Al Nemcek, we're
about the same as last year, but
in events where we were weak
last year, like parallel bars and
high bar, we are a lot
stronger."
Senior Chris Takimoto, who
along with Dan Wessner,
serves as co-captain said, "Per
sonally, I wish I had a little
more time — because of a
sprained tendon, I'm not in the
shape I'd like to be." Hamada
concurs, saying that "for the
first meet, I need about a week
or more, but I'll have all the
guys try their best and see from
there what we have to do."
In comparing Stanford with
the "bear" teams, Hamada
said, "I think we are pretty
close. I don't know too much
about how they're (UCLA and
Cal) doing yet. But Cal has
good all-around men and
specialists so they probably
will be tough to beat. With
UCLA I think it will be very
close."
"Berkeley is a dominant
force in gymnastics and should
challenge Oregon for the
Western regionals," Takimoto
said. "We're really looking
forward to it, especially an en
thusiastic crowd, and since it is
the first meet, seeing how the
team is. It will be interesting to
see how we do."

depth isn't there — not yet. Be
fore the season's end, there'sa
good chance that will change.
Head coach Jackie Walker
explained that she scheduled
"some tough competition at
the very beginning of the sea
son to get the girls ready for the
rest of the season. They came
back very positive, all inspired
about room for improvement
in their routines and how the
team'sgoing todo. I think what
they saw is that there's not as
much difference between the
top teams and themselves."

Highlighting the trip was
Annie Smith's third place finish
in all-around competition
against Arizona, which she
earned by taking fourth in vau
lting and floor exercise and
third on the balance beam. The
night before, Smith earned
second place all-around with
seconds in floor exercise and
beam and thirds in vaulting and
the uneven parallel bars.
Karen Hall, forced out of
Saturday's meet because of an
irritated ligament in her left
hand, swept all-around honors
Friday night and won the vault
ing, beam and floor exercise
events. She also placed fourth
on bars.
"I was just really happy
about those outstanding per
formances — Annie Smith with
the best beam routine of her
life Friday and Jeanette Lacoste
on bars," said Walker. "(La
coste's) routines were basi
cally free of any mistakes — the
best I've seen her do all year.
She's a good competitor — she
did a much better routine both
nights than she does in prac
tice." Depending on the condi
tion of her knee, Lacoste may
be able to enter beam and floor
exercise competition.
As a junior, team captain
Linda Park is one of the squad's
veterans, and has "done an ex
cellent job of keeping
everyone's spirits up," accord
ing to Walker. "Cindy Sedlund
was very impressive in the way
she's becoming a competitor,"
she added. "Last year she was
very nervous for all of her
meets and at Arizona State on
balance beam it's the calmest
she's ever been. I think they all
matured a great deal this
weekend."
As for the prospects in to
night's meet, Walker said that
"depending on Karen's hand,
it could be a real close meet.
Cal Poly Pomona has been
scoring right around 110 to
115; without Karen we scored
111, and with her we scored
116, so I think we have a good
chance to win."
Also depending on Hall's
health, Julie Love's college
debut could be tonight. "If Ka
ren's healthy and in all-around,
then Julie will be a forerunner
(competing to "warm up" the
judges but not for an actual
score)," Walker said. "If Karen
is not in all the events, then
Julie will be competing."
