# Cardinals hunt tiny Bears
## 
### CHRIS HAFT 
With eyes downcast, Stan
ford resumes its Pacific-10
Conference basketball
schedule tomorrow evening at
8 p.m. in Berkeley's Harmon
Gymnasium against perennial
rival California.
The Cardinals won't be look
ing down because of depres
sion or sorrow. Rather, it is be
cause their opponents, the
Golden Bears, are a smaller
than-average collegiate team.
Doug True, a starting for
ward last year, now plays
center and is the tallest starter,
though he stands only 6-foot-8.
True makes the most of what
he's got, however, for he leads
Cal in rebounding with a 7.3
per-game average. He is also
scoring at a creditable 10.1 clip.
Forward Kevin Singleton, at
6-6, tops the Bears' scoring
charts with a 15.7 average. A
smooth-moving, streak
shooting player, Singleton
burned Stanford for 23 points
last year in Cal's 84-68 victory at
Maples Pavilion.
Walt Gillespie, Cal's other

starting forward, stands just
6-3, which is the size of most
guards. Gillespie has been av
eraging a consistent, if unspec
tacular, 8.1 points a game.
Freshman Kevin Sparks, 6-2,
mans one guard spot. He has
proven to be one of the Bears'
best recruits in recent history,
averaging 9.2 points per out
ing.
The other starter in Cal's
backcourt is 6-3 John Caselli.
Caselli is scoring just 7.3 points
a game, but his value lies in his
aggressive, suffocating de
fense and his endless hustle.
After suffering a nine-game
losing streak earlier this sea
son, the Bears have rejuve
nated themselves, winning
three out of their last four to
improve their overall record to
5-10.
Cal committed just three
turnovers in its 70-59 triumph
at Arizona State January 4
(Stanford lost to the Sun Devils
80-68).
Following a loss to Arizona,
the Bears defeated both
Washington, 67-65, and

Washington State, 45-39, Uist
weekend, squaring thpir
Pac-10 record at 3-3.
Like Stanford coach Dick 1 )i-
Biaso, Bears coach Dick
Kuchen served his apprentice
ship at basketball power Not re
Dame as an assistant coach {or
the past three seasons before
replacing Dick Edwards at {he
end of the 1977-78 camp'aigfi.
"California has played well
and consistently for the IJist
dozen games," said Dißiaso.
"They are very conscious ollhe
game's tempo and they^pjj
cute their offense very vwSi&i
Stanford, 8-7 overall at^Cw4
in conference, will start |Js
usual quintet against tSie
Bears: Kimberly Belton and
Brian Welch at forwards, T«n
Schmalzried at center,
Wolfe Perry and Paul
chini at guards.
Road games have not Xifitn
enjoyable occasions for-tne
Cards, who are a skimpjZ3}-5
away from Maples. TomoTfou
is a good time to begin rjekv
traveling habits.
