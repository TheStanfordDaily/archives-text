### RICH MARTINEZ 
The women's basketball
team, tuning up for its big
game against California this
evening, defeated San Fran
cisco State with relative ease
Tuesday evening, 54-42.
In a game that saw both
teams shoot an atrocious .52
percent and San Francisco
State commit 41 turnovers,
Stanford's defense rose to
the occasion and picked up
on the slack.
As is typical of fine teams,
when one aspect of the
Cards' game runs cold
another seems to compen
sate and keep the contest as
tough as ever.
The Stanford defense
shined as its zone press and
fierce play under the boards
forced the Gators into
numerous miscues and 16-
for-50 shooting.
Jeanne Ruark, Angie Pac
cione and Kafhy Murphy
seemed to be becoming a
more cohesive front-court
defense and Louise Smith,
Kathy Schultz, Renee
Steiner and Ann Miller
turned in their consistently
strong defensive perfor

mances as reserves.
"I was very pleased with
our defensive perfor
mance," stated Card coach
Dottie McCrea. "One area
where we need work on
performance is strength
under the boards and this
effort shows that our efforts
are paying off."
Two other positive as
pects of the Cards' game
were fine passing and their
consistent play. For one of
the few times this season,
Stanford took the lead from
the first shot and held the
lead throughout.
Known for starting slowly
and bursting into the lead
with large scoring spurts,
the Cards controlled the
tempo while gradually in
creasing their lead to 12 by
halftime, 30-18.
The women also executed
the offensive plays excel
lently with superb passing
and constant movement.
"They were everything I was
told they would be," stated
Gator coach Cooch Foster.
"Perhaps the biggest differ
ence between our teams
tonight was in execution.

Their movement and pasf
sing was excellent while wf
were sluggish on offense.'!
Stanford is now 2 : 1-in
league and 11-1 overall. It
hopes to improve its league
record to 3-1 with a win over i
a tough Cal team in Berkeley J
this evening.
"I've scouted so many Cal !
games that I dream about J
them in my sleep," said '
McCrea.
Cal owns a deceptive |
record with two losses com* t
ing against powerful UCLA |
and USC. Led by sopho- \
more forwards Colleen Gal-. ;
loway (21.2 points per !
game), jill Weddich (17.0 i
points) and junior center-
Kris Franklin, the Bears' I
frontcourt averages over 4ft 1
points a game and over 30 !
rebounds.
Cal coach Marci Cantrelf 1
stated, "We'll need to !
exploit their weakness, '
which is youth on defense." â– 
"We'll be ready for !
them," stated a confidertlj ;
Paccione. "They don't know' i
how hard we've been j
ing on our defense in prac*
tice." __ I
