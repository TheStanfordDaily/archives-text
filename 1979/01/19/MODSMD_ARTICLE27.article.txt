# Walsh recalls bygone Farm days
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Bill Walsh vacated his second-floor
office in the Athletic Department last
week as he began working to rejuve
nate the beleaguered San Francisco
49ers. His departure, perhaps to the
surprise of some, has not created an
unfillable void in the upstairs quarters
of the football staff.
Rod Dowhower has moved in.
"Some people take a position that
the program will miss me a lot," Walsh
said Tuesday, "but they will find that I
can and will be replaced. People get
into trouble when they think they can't
be replaced. We have seen what has
happened to others who refused to
recognize this."
As he did throughout his two years
here, Walsh maintained that the suc
cess of Stanford's football program re
flected the coaching staff as a unit, not
him as an individual.
Intelligent staff
"We had one of the finest coaching
staffs in the country," Walsh said.
"First, they are all very intelligent
people. Second, they deal well with
other people. Anyone of our coaches
could have replaced me and done a
good job."
The coach who did replace Walsh
was the one who worked most closely
with Walsh on the part of the game
which is the hallmark of Stanford foot
ball — passing.
"Rod did an outstanding job working
with me and the athletes, often working
as an intermediary," Walsh said.
"He will offer the University the type
of football it likes to see, and have an
atmosphere on the squad that's in

keeping with what we've been doing. It
doesn't mean his personality isn't going
to find its way into the program — it
will. In a short time it's going to be
strictly a Rod Dowhower team. All
things considered, he was an ideal can
didate for the job."
Talking to a reporter in a coffee shop
near campus, Walsh could see the
morning sun seemingly sitting on the
rim of Stanford Stadium. Walsh still has
strong attachments to the University.
He speaks with "we" and "our" while
discussing the program.
Profound decision
"The later in life career decisions
come, the more profound their effect,"
the 47-year-old coach said. "My career
changing is much in keeping with
things that often happen to people
such as Stanford graduates. For those
people that have things happen in their
lives, career decisions come up often.
"My leaving is not an evil thing," he
said, then paused for words, "it doesn't
have ominous meanings of someone
being selfish . . . (pause) ... I can't
thinkofthewords. . . who is perpetrat
ing some kind of selfish ambition or
taking full advantage of others and
throwing everything aside to move on.
"I think it's important that you have
certain drives in your make-up where
you are seeking to receive the full satis
faction of your profession," he said. La
ter, he added, "In the final analysis, it
means involving yourself in the highest
level of competition and matching wits
with those that are in that strata."
What gave Walsh his greatest satis
faction at Stanford?
"The state of mind and atmosphere

on the football team," he replied.
"Both seasons were similar: the fact
that we overcame frustration and dis
appointment and had thecharacterand
foundation to sustain our efforts and
come out on top where others easily
could have conceded."
His goal in San Francisco?
"To develop a squad with the same
attitude that our Stanford teams had; to
develop tenacity and a will to perform
up to their potential. I don't know
where that will leave us but then
whether you win or lose there is not
much more you can do."
Criticism of Walsh
Walsh came in for criticism from
some of his Stanford players for not
calling a team meeting to let them know
he was returning to the NFL.
"I don't know whether an emotional
team meeting would have indulged the
players, or me," he said. "I just don't
know what value it would have had in a
permanent sense. The memories I will
take from my two years at Stanford will
be given games and practices: the
light-hearted fun, the humor and fel
lowship.
"And really, there isn't anything com
ing to an end. The program will con
tinue on without missing a beat."
Walsh not only left his team in good
hands, but left it stocked with the fruits
of two tremendous recruiting years.
"I've got the feeling next year will be
a great year for Stanford," Walsh said.
"I don't want to put Rod on the spot
but, heck, he's got to do it." Fie re
flected for a moment, then added:
"I've started sounding just like an
alum."
