Forget about Scarlett
O'Hara. And savor Flozetta
Cooms, who struggles to fit her
48-inch pants around her 50-
inch hips.
Forget about the noble sci
ons of Faulkner's families. And
meet Lunar Module Barlow,
brought forth in July 1969 as the
ninth — and everyone hoped,
the last — child to come kick
ing from LaWanda Barlow's
tired womb.
With characters like these,
Ralph bucks a far-too-long trad
ition of majestic Southern lit
erature to give us a madcap col
lection of ornery and just plain
stupid rednecks in Florida's
panhandle.
It all starts when Lunar Mod
ule comes across the head of
Oren Purvis one night. Now
Oren was regarded as one
mean sonofabitch by everyone

in Fatchakulla County, so
people are shocked, but hardly
upset. 1
But then the dismembered
remains of another citizen are
found. And another. As the
subtitle tells us, sorrteone, or
something, is eating the folks
in Fatchakulla County.
Fortunately, the community
can draw upon the sleuthing
skills of Linwood Spivey, "a de
finite aberration of Fatchakul
la's stagnant gene pool."
Linwood's ability to Figger
Things Out is a caution to his
neighbors, whose standards
seem to be even lower than
USC's. The modest hero,
though, when pressed for an
explanation by his sidekick,
Dr. Bobo, will only demur:
"Simple as shit, my dear Bobo,
simple as shit."
But this case is hardly that
simple. In search of the solu
tion, Linwood wraps himself
around the Q-16 button of a
jukebox during one drunken
spree and plays the song sixty
some times in a row, scaring

everyone out of the bar.
He withstands gunfire on his
home, appalled at the low
breeding of someone that
would disturb his privacy like
that.
And he joins the congrega
tion of Rev. Walpurgis Good
pasture to hear a denounce
ment of "vile pleasures of the
flesh" and a pitch for loving
donations to Fatchakulla Chris
tian College.
As the mystery and its solu
tion unfold, author Ned Crabb
shows a master's touch for
lampooning the Southern way
of life. The barbs are powerful,
often hilarious, yet never vici
ous.
This buoyant, festive style
makes for a delightful even
ing's reading. But it also makes
for a lasting awareness of just
how ridiculous the gallant
South can be. And somewhere
in the acreage of every Tara,
there's probably a powerful lot
of Fatchakulla Springs.
