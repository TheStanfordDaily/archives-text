Birdy
William Wharton
Alfred A. Knopf
310 pp. $8.95
A good novel is one which represents
lite instead of merely imitating it; in gen
eral the best art expresses the artist's
deepest convictions about human experi
ence. A work of art need not be a literal
portrayal of an actual experience, for all
experience is subject to interpretation —
and the artist, through creative use of
analogies and models, can make plain the
subtlest truths about life.
Yet most of today's "art" fails to im
aginatively represent true human nature.
Instead, artists (through fear of offending
popular opinion) merely repeat cliches
and reinforce the ethical standards of their
communities without reflection on the
standards' validity. True art, including
good literature, is rare.
Exciting
Birdy, because it is art, is a very exciting
book. Seldom does one find so great a
love of truth and so comprehensive an un
derstanding of human life as William
Wharton exhibits in his first novel. None
of the major characters are the two
dimensional stock types that inhabit most
popular fiction. The two young men —
Birdy and Al — are real human beings, as
unique as humans are in life. The friend
ship that develops is also real; Wharton
understands friendship well enough to
show that it is made personal and indi

vidual by more than just the external
idiosyncrasies of the people involved. This
talent — the ability to portray real people
and real relationships — is the best mea
sure of a good novelist.
Wharton's most important task is to por
tray insanity in a manner which dispels
our negative preconceptions, yet the first
c hapter (in which Al narrates) tells us that
Birdy is in an insane asylum, pretending he
is a canary. However, Birdy's narrative
draws us in from the beginning. His de
scriptions of his birds and his feelings to-

wards them are so beautiful, aesthetically
and spiritually, that his reality becomes
ours. We must step back consciously into
our own minds in order to remember that
he is insane. It is difficult, however, to
return to the prejudices which Birdy so
dramatically shows to be invalid.
Believable
Wharton also has to portray a believable
attraction between Birdy, the "bird boy,"
and Al, the well-liked jock. Again, he suc
ceeds. Al's narrative is frank and very per
sonal: his contusion often overrides his
deep understanding and he is left with a

sadness with which we empathize. At
times, Al seems to hold the stereotypical
"jock" values which make him tell Birdy,
"You know you could've been state
champion if you wanted to. You could've
wrestled all those shrimps at a hundred
twenty-five without even trying. Could've
broken all kinds of track records too.'' Yet
it is clear that he knows that such awards
are meaningless when he says of his
father, "His face lights up when I tell him I
made sergeant. It's a dumb sad life most
men live."
We feel Al's confusion; we know that he
is drawn to Birdy by a desire to understand
life. Yet in the end, Al makes this revela
tion possible for Birdy. While through
their boyhood Birdy had kept Al from
blindly accepting the status quo, it is Al
who finally inspi res in Birdy the courage to
deal with the rest of the confused human
race. The two friends find hope in one
another; the book ends with joy.
Remarkable
Technically, Birdy is not perfect. As art
for the sake of art, it wants some refine
ment — yet even from the artistic
standpoint it is written skillfully. These
technical standards are secondary, how
ever, for the most important function of
art is that it express some truth about
human existence. Birdy does this, power
fully and unquestionably. As literature, it
is extraordinary. William Wharton has
written a remarkable first novel.

good literature, is rare.
Exciting
Birdy, because it is art, is a very exciting
book. Seldom does one find so great a
love of truth and so comprehensive an un
derstanding of human life as William
Wharton exhibits in his first novel. None
of the major characters are the two
dimensional stock types that inhabit most
popular fiction. The two young men —
Birdy and Al — are real human beings, as
unique as humans are in life. The friend
ship that develops is also real; Wharton
understands friendship well enough to
show that it is made personal and indi

vidual by more than just the external
idiosyncrasies of the people involved. This
talent — the ability to portray real people
and real relationships — is the best mea
sure of a good novelist.
Wharton's most important task is to por
tray insanity in a manner which dispels
our negative preconceptions, yet the first
c hapter (in which Al narrates) tells us that
Birdy is in an insane asylum, pretending he
is a canary. However, Birdy's narrative
draws us in from the beginning. His de
scriptions of his birds and his feelings to-

wards them are so beautiful, aesthetically
and spiritually, that his reality becomes
ours. We must step back consciously into
our own minds in order to remember that
he is insane. It is difficult, however, to
return to the prejudices which Birdy so
dramatically shows to be invalid.
Believable
Wharton also has to portray a believable
attraction between Birdy, the "bird boy,"
and Al, the well-liked jock. Again, he suc
ceeds. Al's narrative is frank and very per
sonal: his contusion often overrides his
deep understanding and he is left with a

sadness with which we empathize. At
times, Al seems to hold the stereotypical
"jock" values which make him tell Birdy,
"You know you could've been state
champion if you wanted to. You could've
wrestled all those shrimps at a hundred
twenty-five without even trying. Could've
broken all kinds of track records too.'' Yet
it is clear that he knows that such awards
are meaningless when he says of his
father, "His face lights up when I tell him I
made sergeant. It's a dumb sad life most
men live."
We feel Al's confusion; we know that he
is drawn to Birdy by a desire to understand
life. Yet in the end, Al makes this revela
tion possible for Birdy. While through
their boyhood Birdy had kept Al from
blindly accepting the status quo, it is Al
who finally inspi res in Birdy the courage to
deal with the rest of the confused human
race. The two friends find hope in one
another; the book ends with joy.
Remarkable
Technically, Birdy is not perfect. As art
for the sake of art, it wants some refine
ment — yet even from the artistic
standpoint it is written skillfully. These
technical standards are secondary, how
ever, for the most important function of
art is that it express some truth about
human existence. Birdy does this, power
fully and unquestionably. As literature, it
is extraordinary. William Wharton has
written a remarkable first novel.
