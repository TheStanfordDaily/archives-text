# Student response to Griffin, others sought
## Mascot proposal begins to take wing 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
"Moved, seconded and carried
that the following resolution be
adopted:
"Whereas the Indian has long been
unofficially recognized as the symbol
of Stanford and its spirit, and
"Whereas there has never been any
official designation of a Stanford
symbol, be it hereby
"Resolved that the Executive Com
mittee adopt the Indian as the sym
bol of Stanford."
With the passage of that resolution
on Nov. 25, 1930, by the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents (the equivalent of the ASSU
senate), the Indian became the offi
cial symbol of the University.

News analysis

Forty-two years later, the ASSU Se
nate voted 18-4 to eliminate the In
dian as the mascot. The senate deci
sion, in conjunction with support
from native American students and
then-Ombudsman Lois Amsterdam,
prompted President Richard Lyman
to officially remove the Indian as the
University's symbol.
New candidate
Since then, various attempts to
reinstate the Indian have failed, and a
new candidate, the Griffin, has
emerged.
Despite the fact that no formal
procedure for the selection of a mas
cot has ever been established, those
involved seem to agree that any
proposal must begin with the stu
dents and end in Lyman's office.
Lyman was unavailable for com

ment yesterday.
Until recently, there has been a lot
of discussion and little in the way of
decision. However, Senate Chair
person Peter Stamos said the mascot
problem may finally be on its way to
resolution.
Last night, the senate held the first
open debate on the issue. Stamos
said the senate plans to elicit feed
back from the student body, in order
to establish some kind of consensus,
before it makes any decisions.
' Definite answer"
According to Stamos, it is "very
possible, within a month, we'll have
a definitive answer as to what the
students want."
After general discussion, in col
laboration with the Athletic Depart
ment, Stamos said it will be up to the
senate to adopt a resolution. From
there, he said, the resolution would
be presented to Lyman, hopefully
gaining the support of the COP along
the way.
Stamos said any resolution would
have to represent a consensus of the
student body. Dean of Student Af
fairs )ames Lyons, agreed saying,
"The president will not act in the ab
sence of some demonstration of
support."
As for what might happen if the
senate proposes an idea that is not
supported by the administration,
Stamos said that might not make any
difference. He said he thought it
would be a good idea to cooperate
with the administration, but he
added that "if we get a student man
date, I don't think there's anything
that wold stop it."
Little fanfare
When the Indian was first adopted,
there was no official approval or dis
approval by then-president
Raymond Wilbur, according to
former presidential assistant Fred
Glover, who was a student here at

that time. Clover explained that the
selection of a mascot was not a major
issue at the time and "there weren't
any racial tensions involved." Con
sequently, the resolution was passed
by the senate without much fanfare.
However, Glover emphasized that
if Wilbur had not wanted the Indian,
"that would have been it."
"There was much less discussion
and much more decision in those
days," Glover said. "The officers
(Wilbur and athletic director Al Mas
ters) had a great deal of authority.
They would have been in a position
to stop it."
