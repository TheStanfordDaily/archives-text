"You should never let a girl
like that go. You just get one of
them in a lifetime, lust like you
get one big book in a lifetime."
â€” Fools Die p. 511.
When reading Fools Die, the
new novel by Mario Puzo, it is
easy to slip into the rut of com
paring it to Puzo's blockbuster
novel, The Godfather, which
rocked the literary world when
published in March of 1%9.
But as Osano, a character in
Fools Die says above, you only
get one good book in your
lifetime. The lesson is toaccept
Fools Die for what it is, an enter

taining though structurally
flawed novel.
Puzo has smartly not tried to
transcend The Godfather. He
has taken some tales from his
own life, thrown in a few gos
sipy, how-they-do-it anecdotes
about Las Vegas and Hol
lywood, and melded them into
a novel.
The protagonist is John Mer
lyn, an author who rises out of
an obscure childhood and
literary career to write a
bestselling novel and become
the toast of the literary world.
Merlyn is also a degenerate
gambler (a term which Puzo
uses as a definition of one who
must gamble) and a screenwri
ter, and his travels set the stage
for Puzo's stories about the
glamour of Las Vegas and Hoi

lywood.
In Las Vegas, Merlyn's base
is the glittering Hotel Xanadu,
run by a "Godfather" type,
Alfred Gronevelt. Women,
blackmaiI, expensive gifts,
foreign currency smuggling,
even the pumping of pure oxy
gen through the casino late at
night to refreshen the
gamblers; Gronevelt will cjp
anything to get the gambler fo
bet at the Xanadu, for he
knows that no matter how
many gifts he gives away, the
percentages demand that he
will profit in the long run.
Puzo is unrelentingly harsh
in his writing about the
"schlockmeisters" of Hol
lywood. Puzo despises Hol
lywood, and, not coinciden
tally, so does Merlyn. Puzo has
been through many squabbles,
both artistic and financial that
have left a bad taste in his
mouth. He puts Merlyn
through the same wringer.

Semi-autobiographical
In fact, the novel is semi
autobiographical in that much
of Merlyn's background is
drawn directly from the life of
Mario Puzo. Puzo's first novel
was critically acclaimed, yet did
a bellyflop at the cash register.
So does Merlyn's. Puzo also
uses a civil service scandal, a
career writing for pulp
magazines, and a gall-bladder
attack out of his past to enrich
the novel.
The flaws in Fools Die do not
suffocate the novel, but
neither are they insignificant.
Puzo often switches narration,
from one character to another
and then to third person back
to another character back to
narration, etc. If that descrip
tion seems confusing, it is
equally confusing to read an
entire novel chopped up in this
manner. Puzo seems to be try
ing to tell his story from alj
points of view, and he spreads
himself too thin.
Successful attempt
One must applaud Puzo's
literary skills, however, for
though he paints Merlyn as an
honorable man, in the course
ot the book Merlyn becomes a
bribe taker and gets a mistress.
Vet Merlyn still remains virtu
ous in the reader's eyes. Only a
writer of Puzo's caliber could
attempt this successfully and
not lose credibility.
Overall, Merlyn is a cautious
man, one whose only goaj'jn
life is to survive. Of the main
characters portrayed in the
novel, only two of them remain
alive at the end: Merlyn, the
survivor, and Cronevelt, the
man whose only god is the per
centage. Puzo is telling the
reader that fools die, to be
cautious and play the percen
tage. That is what he has done
in writing Fools Die. He took no
chances, did not try to
double-or-nothing his break
ing of the bank with The God
father, and sure enough, herof*
led another seven.
