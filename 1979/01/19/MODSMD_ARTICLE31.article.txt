The Pirate ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
This film is certainly not with
out its faults in pacing and
characterization. But if you're at
all susceptible to the charms of
the musical, chances are you'll be
able to ignore this film's
shortcomings in favor of its spec
tacular studio technicolor, a fine
Cole Porter score (including "Be
a Clown"), and two people who
represent the heyday of the big
musical: Judy Garland and Gene
Kelly. Vincente Minelli, who
would later do An American in
Paris, directed this Latin Ameri
can fantasy about a girl who
dreams of Mac the Biack, the pi
rate.
—Jim Mattson
High Anxiety ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Mel Brooks may keep doing
parodies until the bitter end; if
so, it would be a tragic waste of a
true comic talent. Here, in this
spoof of Hitchcock movies,
Brooks runs out of things to add
to the scenes — all we find is that
he can reproduce Hitchcock
fairly well. There's enough twists
here to keep things moving, and
some scenes are quite good,
especially the play on Psycho.
But, all told, Ffitchcock was fun
nier— you can't force drollnevs.
—Ron Lillejord
Breakfast at Tiffany's ★★
Friday, Kresge Auditoriurr
A'jHi-pv HpnH'jrr. stars as Holly
Golightly, a free spirit whose idea
of sublime elegance is to start the
day munching a donut in front of
the famous jewelry store's win
dow. This explains the title, sort
of; but it would take a good deal
more effort to decide just how
Henry Mancini's big tune, -
"Moon River," works itself into
the plot. God knows that George
Peppard, as the man being kept
by Patricia O'Neal, can't figure it
out.
—J.M.
Movie-Movie ★ ★★
Cinema 21, San Francisco
Stanley Donen, who directed
Singing in the Rain, possibly the
greatest musical Hollywood ever
produced, directed this skillful
parody of a '50s double bill.
One is a boxing film, in a concise
black-and-white imitation called
Dynamite Hands. The other is a
musical cailed Baxter's Heautiesot
I'U3, filmed in superbly gaudy
thirtyish color. George C. Scott
is surpnsingly adept with his
comedy roles in each ot the two
films within a film. His imperso
nation of a Ziegfield-type Broad
way producer named Spats Bax
ter is very sleek.
—J.M.
Moment by Moment ★*
Guild, Menlo Park
The very talented lily Tomlin
and the enormously popular
John Travolta combine their ef
forts here; the result is an in
explicably bad movie. I he direc
tor, Jane Wagner, is a woman,
but instead of helping Tomlin
give her character unusual
depth, as one would have ex
pected, Wagner allows Tomlin to
give a performance which seems
to have been drawn from her
nightclub laugh. Unfortunately,
all the laughs have been left out,
so Tomlin's character merely
seems excruciatingly flat. As
May-December romances go,
this cine should.
-J.M.

In Praise of Older Women ★
Regency 11, San Francisco
This is notable only because it
is probably the most sexually
explicit film released under an
"R" rating. Other than that, how
ever, this story of, according to
the press release, "the amorous
adventures of a virile young man,
glorifying in the sexual prowess
of older women," has little to
commend it: the single-minded
plot gets downright boring. Tom
Berenger is featured; Karen Black
is his first "older woman." Hun
garian George Kaczender directs.
—|.M.
Midnight Express
Biograph, Palo Alto
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—).M.
No Time For Breakfast ★★★
Aquarius Theatre, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
this is a good movie about a doc
tor who discovers how comfort
less the ministrations of her pro
fession can be when she finds
she is dying of cancer. Annie
Cirardot, who gave last year's
Dear Detective any merit it pos
sessed, turns what was poten
tially soap-opera material into a
very moving performance.
—J.M.
To Have and Have Notififkif
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
There's not too much left of
Hemingway's plot here, but it re
ally doesn't matter — the audi
ence is too busy watching the re
lationship between Humphrey
Bogart and Lauren Bacall. She
calls him Steve for no apparent
reason (You know how to whis
tle, don't you, Steve? You just put
your lips together and blow), and
Bogart falls in love both on- and
otf-screen. William Faulkner had
a hand in the script; Howard
Flawks directed.
—|.M.
Casablanca ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. It sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung
by the man they've tried to im
itate ever since — Dooley Wilson
— and the services of a pair of
stars it would be hard for anyone
to forget: Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and
the great Claude Rains also add
their talents. For the benefit of
Comm 141 students, the director
was Michael Curtiz (The Adven
tures of Robin Hood, Mildred
Pierce) and the studio was
Warner Brothers.
—|.M.
Oliver's Story ★
Palo Alto Square
Marci (Candice Bergen)
teaches Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) that
the way to erase the memory of a
dead wife is to discover the plea
sures of being frightfully rich.
This pointless sequel begins with
a reprise of Oliver's first wife's
funeral; it becomes progres
sively less interesting from there.
This movie gets the Muzak
award: it's this season's closest
cinematic equivalent to super
market music.

venom by Jack Nicholson and

—John Nielsen

California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets oft
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the lane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the
ordinary sound witless and
to reed.
—R.L.
Millie ★★
Old Mill
Best described as yet another
remakeof A Star is Born; this time
there's a dummy in the )udy Car
land part and the star-on-the
way-down role is taken by An
thony Hopkins as a ventriloquist.
Director Richard Attenborough
pulls off one or two scary mo
ments, but this pseudo
psychological story about a ven
triloquist who becomes obses
sed with his own mannequin has
been done many times before —
and better.
—J.M.
King of the Gypsies ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you're in the right mood, this
silly mock epic about a clan of
gypsies in the big city is surpris
ingly entertaining. You could
spend days just trying to tigure
out the genetics of this family, in
which the most amazingly di
verse looking people are sup
posed to be closely related. Sterl
ing Hayden and Shelley Winters
get top billing, but the only per
formances worth watching are by
Susan Sarandon as a gutsy, vib
rant gypsy woman, and new
comer Eric Roberts as the son
who realizes that the gypsies
must adapt to the 20th century.
—J.M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
lord of the Rings ★
Old Mill
One of last year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat and
Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after
more than two hours we are in
formed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—J.M.

The Wiz ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical; lots of every
thing — but make sure we don't
offend anybody. In his desire to
energize this sprawling mess,
Sidney Lumet, the director, sim
ply increased the budget, turned
the volume up and enlarged the
sets. Subtlety and individuality
are trampled by all the technol
ogy-
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multicolored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? You can't
have a tantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so huge, so loud in
Ihe Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.
—R.L.
Autumn Sonata •k-kir x 'i
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
trustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Palo Alto Square *★★★
This nearly flawless thriller,
which deals with an invasion by
aliens who come in the form of
harmless-looking flowers, will
have you looking suspiciously at
every vegetable in your re
frigerator. lOTBS is set in San
Francisco, and seldom has the
city looked more beautiful than
here as the control center for the
take-over of the human race.
Donald Sutherland and Brooke
Adams star as two people who
are desperately trying to keep
their own identities; Leonard
Nimoy is the villain who works to
take them away. Phil Kaufman di
rected, stunningly.
—|.M.
Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of trat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am neverquite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has a
decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

There's not too much left of
Hemingway's plot here, but it re
ally doesn't matter — the audi
ence is too busy watching the re
lationship between Humphrey
Bogart and Lauren Bacall. She
calls him Steve for no apparent
reason (You know how to whis
tle, don't you, Steve? You just put
your lips together and blow), and
Bogart falls in love both on- and
otf-screen. William Faulkner had
a hand in the script; Howard
Flawks directed.

Casablanca ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. It sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung
by the man they've tried to im
itate ever since — Dooley Wilson
— and the services of a pair of
stars it would be hard for anyone
to forget: Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and
the great Claude Rains also add
their talents. For the benefit of
Comm 141 students, the director
was Michael Curtiz (The Adven
tures of Robin Hood, Mildred
Pierce) and the studio was
Warner Brothers.

Oliver's Story ★
Palo Alto Square
Marci (Candice Bergen)
teaches Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) that
the way to erase the memory of a
dead wife is to discover the plea
sures of being frightfully rich.
This pointless sequel begins with
a reprise of Oliver's first wife's
funeral; it becomes progres
sively less interesting from there.
This movie gets the Muzak
award: it's this season's closest
cinematic equivalent to super
market music.

California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets oft
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the lane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the

to reed.

Millie ★★
Old Mill
Best described as yet another

there's a dummy in the )udy Car

Director Richard Attenborough

King of the Gypsies ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you're in the right mood, this
silly mock epic about a clan of
gypsies in the big city is surpris
ingly entertaining. You could
spend days just trying to tigure
out the genetics of this family, in
which the most amazingly di
verse looking people are sup
posed to be closely related. Sterl
ing Hayden and Shelley Winters
get top billing, but the only per
formances worth watching are by
Susan Sarandon as a gutsy, vib
rant gypsy woman, and new
comer Eric Roberts as the son
who realizes that the gypsies
must adapt to the 20th century.

Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com

shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
lord of the Rings ★
Old Mill
One of last year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat and
Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after
more than two hours we are in
formed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—J.M.

The Wiz ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical; lots of every
thing — but make sure we don't
offend anybody. In his desire to
energize this sprawling mess,
Sidney Lumet, the director, sim
ply increased the budget, turned
the volume up and enlarged the
sets. Subtlety and individuality
are trampled by all the technol
ogy-
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multicolored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? You can't
have a tantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so huge, so loud in
Ihe Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.

Autumn Sonata •k-kir x 'i
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
trustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Palo Alto Square *★★★
This nearly flawless thriller,
which deals with an invasion by
aliens who come in the form of
harmless-looking flowers, will
have you looking suspiciously at
every vegetable in your re
frigerator. lOTBS is set in San
Francisco, and seldom has the
city looked more beautiful than
here as the control center for the
take-over of the human race.
Donald Sutherland and Brooke
Adams star as two people who
are desperately trying to keep
their own identities; Leonard
Nimoy is the villain who works to
take them away. Phil Kaufman di
rected, stunningly.
—|.M.
Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of trat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am neverquite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has a
decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

The Pirate ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
This film is certainly not with
out its faults in pacing and
characterization. But if you're at
all susceptible to the charms of
the musical, chances are you'll be
able to ignore this film's
shortcomings in favor of its spec
tacular studio technicolor, a fine
Cole Porter score (including "Be
a Clown"), and two people who
represent the heyday of the big
musical: Judy Garland and Gene
Kelly. Vincente Minelli, who
would later do An American in

can fantasy about a girl who

rate.

High Anxiety ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Mel Brooks may keep doing
parodies until the bitter end; if
so, it would be a tragic waste of a
true comic talent. Here, in this
spoof of Hitchcock movies,
Brooks runs out of things to add
to the scenes — all we find is that
he can reproduce Hitchcock
fairly well. There's enough twists
here to keep things moving, and
some scenes are quite good,
especially the play on Psycho.
But, all told, Ffitchcock was fun

Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat and
Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after
more than two hours we are in

The Wiz ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical; lots of every
thing — but make sure we don't
offend anybody. In his desire to
energize this sprawling mess,
Sidney Lumet, the director, sim
ply increased the budget, turned
the volume up and enlarged the
sets. Subtlety and individuality
are trampled by all the technol
ogy-
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multicolored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? You can't
have a tantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so huge, so loud in
Ihe Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.

Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
trustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Palo Alto Square *★★★
This nearly flawless thriller,
which deals with an invasion by
aliens who come in the form of
harmless-looking flowers, will
have you looking suspiciously at
every vegetable in your re
frigerator. lOTBS is set in San
Francisco, and seldom has the
city looked more beautiful than
here as the control center for the
take-over of the human race.
Donald Sutherland and Brooke
Adams star as two people who
are desperately trying to keep
their own identities; Leonard
Nimoy is the villain who works to
take them away. Phil Kaufman di
rected, stunningly.
—|.M.
Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of trat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am neverquite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has a
decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

The Pirate ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
This film is certainly not with
out its faults in pacing and
characterization. But if you're at
all susceptible to the charms of
the musical, chances are you'll be
able to ignore this film's
shortcomings in favor of its spec
tacular studio technicolor, a fine
Cole Porter score (including "Be
a Clown"), and two people who
represent the heyday of the big
musical: Judy Garland and Gene
Kelly. Vincente Minelli, who
would later do An American in
Paris, directed this Latin Ameri
can fantasy about a girl who
dreams of Mac the Biack, the pi
rate.

High Anxiety ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Mel Brooks may keep doing
parodies until the bitter end; if
so, it would be a tragic waste of a

Brooks runs out of things to add
to the scenes — all we find is that
he can reproduce Hitchcock
fairly well. There's enough twists
here to keep things moving, and
some scenes are quite good,
especially the play on Psycho.
But, all told, Ffitchcock was fun

A'jHi-pv HpnH'jrr. stars as Holly

the famous jewelry store's win
dow. This explains the title, sort
of; but it would take a good deal
more effort to decide just how
Henry Mancini's big tune, -
"Moon River," works itself into
the plot. God knows that George

black-and-white imitation called
Dynamite Hands. The other is a
musical cailed Baxter's Heautiesot

Guild, Menlo Park
The very talented lily Tomlin
and the enormously popular
John Travolta combine their ef
forts here; the result is an in
explicably bad movie. I he direc
tor, Jane Wagner, is a woman,
but instead of helping Tomlin
give her character unusual
depth, as one would have ex
pected, Wagner allows Tomlin to
give a performance which seems
to have been drawn from her
nightclub laugh. Unfortunately,
all the laughs have been left out,
so Tomlin's character merely
seems excruciatingly flat. As
May-December romances go,
this cine should.

In Praise of Older Women ★
Regency 11, San Francisco
This is notable only because it
is probably the most sexually

"R" rating. Other than that, how
ever, this story of, according to
the press release, "the amorous
adventures of a virile young man,
glorifying in the sexual prowess
of older women," has little to
commend it: the single-minded
plot gets downright boring. Tom
Berenger is featured; Karen Black
is his first "older woman." Hun
garian George Kaczender directs.

Midnight Express

Columbia Pictures proudly

Aquarius Theatre, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems

To Have and Have Notififkif
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
There's not too much left of
Hemingway's plot here, but it re

lationship between Humphrey
Bogart and Lauren Bacall. She
calls him Steve for no apparent
reason (You know how to whis
tle, don't you, Steve? You just put
your lips together and blow), and
Bogart falls in love both on- and
otf-screen. William Faulkner had
a hand in the script; Howard
Flawks directed.

Casablanca ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. It sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung
by the man they've tried to im
itate ever since — Dooley Wilson
— and the services of a pair of
stars it would be hard for anyone
to forget: Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and
the great Claude Rains also add
their talents. For the benefit of
Comm 141 students, the director
was Michael Curtiz (The Adven

Pierce) and the studio was
Warner Brothers.

Oliver's Story ★
Palo Alto Square
Marci (Candice Bergen)
teaches Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) that
the way to erase the memory of a

This pointless sequel begins with
a reprise of Oliver's first wife's

sively less interesting from there.
This movie gets the Muzak
award: it's this season's closest
cinematic equivalent to super
market music.

Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than

from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets oft

A triumph of corporate com

what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex

The movie survives its overlong

brings out the sexiness we always

Breakfast at Tiffany's ★★
Friday, Kresge Auditoriurr
A'jHi-pv HpnH'jrr. stars as Holly
Golightly, a free spirit whose idea
of sublime elegance is to start the
day munching a donut in front of
the famous jewelry store's win
dow. This explains the title, sort
of; but it would take a good deal
more effort to decide just how
Henry Mancini's big tune, -
"Moon River," works itself into
the plot. God knows that George
Peppard, as the man being kept
by Patricia O'Neal, can't figure it
out.

Movie-Movie ★ ★★
Cinema 21, San Francisco
Stanley Donen, who directed
Singing in the Rain, possibly the
greatest musical Hollywood ever
produced, directed this skillful
parody of a '50s double bill.
One is a boxing film, in a concise
black-and-white imitation called
Dynamite Hands. The other is a
musical cailed Baxter's Heautiesot
I'U3, filmed in superbly gaudy
thirtyish color. George C. Scott
is surpnsingly adept with his
comedy roles in each ot the two
films within a film. His imperso
nation of a Ziegfield-type Broad
way producer named Spats Bax
ter is very sleek.

Moment by Moment ★*
Guild, Menlo Park
The very talented lily Tomlin
and the enormously popular
John Travolta combine their ef
forts here; the result is an in
explicably bad movie. I he direc
tor, Jane Wagner, is a woman,
but instead of helping Tomlin
give her character unusual
depth, as one would have ex
pected, Wagner allows Tomlin to
give a performance which seems
to have been drawn from her
nightclub laugh. Unfortunately,
all the laughs have been left out,
so Tomlin's character merely
seems excruciatingly flat. As
May-December romances go,
this cine should.

In Praise of Older Women ★
Regency 11, San Francisco
This is notable only because it
is probably the most sexually
explicit film released under an
"R" rating. Other than that, how
ever, this story of, according to
the press release, "the amorous
adventures of a virile young man,
glorifying in the sexual prowess
of older women," has little to
commend it: the single-minded
plot gets downright boring. Tom
Berenger is featured; Karen Black
is his first "older woman." Hun
garian George Kaczender directs.

Midnight Express
Biograph, Palo Alto
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

No Time For Breakfast ★★★
Aquarius Theatre, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
this is a good movie about a doc
tor who discovers how comfort
less the ministrations of her pro
fession can be when she finds
she is dying of cancer. Annie
Cirardot, who gave last year's
Dear Detective any merit it pos
sessed, turns what was poten
tially soap-opera material into a
very moving performance.
—J.M.
To Have and Have Notififkif
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
There's not too much left of
Hemingway's plot here, but it re
ally doesn't matter — the audi
ence is too busy watching the re
lationship between Humphrey
Bogart and Lauren Bacall. She
calls him Steve for no apparent
reason (You know how to whis
tle, don't you, Steve? You just put
your lips together and blow), and
Bogart falls in love both on- and
otf-screen. William Faulkner had
a hand in the script; Howard
Flawks directed.
—|.M.
Casablanca ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. It sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung
by the man they've tried to im
itate ever since — Dooley Wilson
— and the services of a pair of
stars it would be hard for anyone
to forget: Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and
the great Claude Rains also add
their talents. For the benefit of
Comm 141 students, the director
was Michael Curtiz (The Adven
tures of Robin Hood, Mildred
Pierce) and the studio was
Warner Brothers.
—|.M.
Oliver's Story ★
Palo Alto Square
Marci (Candice Bergen)
teaches Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) that
the way to erase the memory of a
dead wife is to discover the plea
sures of being frightfully rich.
This pointless sequel begins with
a reprise of Oliver's first wife's
funeral; it becomes progres
sively less interesting from there.
This movie gets the Muzak
award: it's this season's closest
cinematic equivalent to super
market music.

California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets oft
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the lane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the
ordinary sound witless and
to reed.

Millie ★★
Old Mill
Best described as yet another

there's a dummy in the )udy Car

Director Richard Attenborough

King of the Gypsies ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you're in the right mood, this
silly mock epic about a clan of
gypsies in the big city is surpris
ingly entertaining. You could
spend days just trying to tigure
out the genetics of this family, in
which the most amazingly di
verse looking people are sup
posed to be closely related. Sterl
ing Hayden and Shelley Winters
get top billing, but the only per
formances worth watching are by
Susan Sarandon as a gutsy, vib
rant gypsy woman, and new
comer Eric Roberts as the son
who realizes that the gypsies
must adapt to the 20th century.
—J.M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
lord of the Rings ★
Old Mill
One of last year's most promis

its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat and
Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after
more than two hours we are in
formed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—J.M.

The Wiz ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical; lots of every
thing — but make sure we don't
offend anybody. In his desire to
energize this sprawling mess,
Sidney Lumet, the director, sim
ply increased the budget, turned
the volume up and enlarged the
sets. Subtlety and individuality
are trampled by all the technol
ogy-
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multicolored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? You can't
have a tantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so huge, so loud in
Ihe Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.

Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
trustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Palo Alto Square *★★★
This nearly flawless thriller,
which deals with an invasion by
aliens who come in the form of
harmless-looking flowers, will
have you looking suspiciously at
every vegetable in your re
frigerator. lOTBS is set in San
Francisco, and seldom has the
city looked more beautiful than
here as the control center for the
take-over of the human race.
Donald Sutherland and Brooke
Adams star as two people who
are desperately trying to keep
their own identities; Leonard
Nimoy is the villain who works to
take them away. Phil Kaufman di
rected, stunningly.
—|.M.
Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of trat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am neverquite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has a
decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

The Pirate ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
This film is certainly not with
out its faults in pacing and
characterization. But if you're at
all susceptible to the charms of
the musical, chances are you'll be
able to ignore this film's
shortcomings in favor of its spec
tacular studio technicolor, a fine
Cole Porter score (including "Be
a Clown"), and two people who
represent the heyday of the big
musical: Judy Garland and Gene
Kelly. Vincente Minelli, who
would later do An American in
Paris, directed this Latin Ameri
can fantasy about a girl who
dreams of Mac the Biack, the pi
rate.

High Anxiety ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Mel Brooks may keep doing

he can reproduce Hitchcock

here to keep things moving, and
