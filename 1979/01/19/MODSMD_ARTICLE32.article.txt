Purchases push economy ahead
Washington — An holiday buying
spree by shoppers pushed the nation's economy
ahead at an unusually fast pace and reduced the
chances of a recession, a government report indi
cated yesterday.
The fa.l percent growth rate in the fourth quarter
was nearly double what many economists had
been predicting several months ago. It was consi
dered high enough to keep the unemployment
rate from rising above 6 percent for awhile.
The Commerce Department report showed that
consumers led the fourth-quarter boom by buying
more autos and Christmas gifts, but they also bor
rowed more money for their increased spending.
One reason they went further into debt was
worsening inflation, the report showed.
It said that prices for all of 1978 averaged 7.4
percent higher than they were in 1977, the highest
inflation rate since the 9.fa percent figure recorded
in 1975.
Inflation was getting worse at the end of the year
as prices rose at an 8.1 percent rate in the fourth
quarter.
Some economists have said that consumers may
be overextending themselves. When borrowing
eventually slows, they say the economy may grind
to a halt.
Vietnamese bomb Camboida
Bangkok, Thailand — Vietnamese-piloted Ameri
can and Soviet warplanes darted over the skies of
Cambodia yesterday, bombing and strafing re
mnants of the Cambodian army still resisting the
huge Vietnamese invasion force, analysts re
ported.
Units of the Cambodian army reportedly were
engaged in ground battles in widespread areas of
the country with the Vietnamese and their Cam
bodian rebel allies.
One analyst described the Vietnamese air
strikes as a "replay" on a smaller scale of American
air raids during the Indochina War. The Viet
namese got the American jets the United States
left behind when the communists conquered
South Vietnam in April 1975. The Soviets are allies
of the Vietnamese and supply them with planes
and other war material.
Military analysts said Vietnamese forces as
saulted the Cambodian island bastion of Kong,
launched heavy air strikes against two embattled
coastal port areas and were faced with resistance
in at least half a dozen areas in Cambodia.
Slight rise seen in jobless rate
Washington — The Carter administration is fore
casting that the nation's unemployment rate will
rise only sightly this year, to fa.2 percent, and stay
there in 1980, government sources say.
But most private economists are predicting a
sharper rise, to between fa.s percent and 7 per

cent. Each tenth of one percent stands for about
100,000 jobless Americans.
Private economists have less confidence in Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's ability to bring inflation
under control. All agree, though, that a recession
with much higher unemployment will occur if in
flation is not brought down from its current rate of
about 9.5 percent.
Government as well as private economists had
predicted that unemployment would remain
above 6 percent in 1978. However, economic
growth proved stronger than anticipated, and the
jobless rate fell from 6.2 percent last winter to 5.8
percent during the final three months of the year.
Releases to be delayed in Tenn.
Nashville — Gov. Lamar Alexander s?id yester
day that he probably won't be able to block the 52
pardons and commutations issued by his pre
decessor, Ray Blanton, two days before Blanton
left office in disgrace.
But Alexander said he will at least be able to
delay the release of 17 prisoners who became elig
ible for immediate release under Blanton's Mon
day night order.
Meanwhile, a federal grand jury reconvened
yesterday to continue its investigation of whether
clemency \Vas for sale in the Blanton administra
tion.
Blanton, a Democrat, signed three pardons and
49 sentence commutations Monday night. The
prisoners involved included 24 murderers, and the
legal papers showed 30 became eligible for im
mediate freedom. The other 22 had their sen
tences cut but still had time to serve. Blanton's
aides hinted more pardons and commutations
may have been on the way.
Senate passes anti-busing bill
Sacramento — A constitutional amendment de
signed to sharply limit the power of California
judges to integrate schools was approved over
whelmingly yesterday by the state Senate.
It was the third time since 1977 that the upper
house had approved such a measure, aimed
primarily at overturning Los Angeles' massive bus
ing program.
A 31-5 vote sent the amendment to the more
liberal Assembly, where the two earlier measures
died in committee. At least 27 votes, a two-thirds
majority in the 40-seat Senate, were needed for
passage.
Approval by both houses would put the
amendment on the ballot next year.
The amendment, by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van
Nuys) would force California courts to use the
standards of the U.S. Supreme Court in deciding
whether schools should be integrated.
The federal high court currently says school dis
tricts can be required to integrate only if there is
evidence of intentional segregation.
The California Supreme Court says schools must

integrate regardless of cause.
But it is questionable whether the bill would
block the Los Angeles program because at least
one judge has found that school officials there had
"affirmatively" promoted racial separation.
Probes to begin in BART blaze
Oakland — Commuters struggled through a
seven-mile traffic jam to their jobs in San Francisco
yesterday as fire officials sought thecause of Wed
nesday's Bay Area Rapid Transit tunnel fire, which
killed a fireman and hospitalized at least 35 per
sons.
At a morning news conference, BART General
Manager Keith Bernard said the cause of the fire
was unknown. Both BART and the state Public
Utilities Commission said they hoped to begin
hearings into the accident today.
Fire officials and BART information officer Mike
Healy said government red tape was at least partly
to blame for the toxic smoke that probably killed
Oakland fireman William Elliot, 50, of Castro Val
ley.
Brown blasts Carter comments
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown accused Presi
dent jimmy Carter of "scare tactics" yesterday
after Carter criticized the Californian's call for a
U.S. constitutional convention to prohibit federal
budget deficits.
It was the sharpest and most direct criticism
Brown has made of Carter since he challenged
Carter in 1976 for the Democratic nomination for
president.
Brown attacked the president both directly and
indirectly at a news conference, responding to
Carter's statement Wednesday that the sort of
convention Brown endorsed would be "extremely
dangerous."
Carter cited concerns voiced by liberals who say
theyfeara convention to amend the U.S. Constitu
tion could undercut civil liberties guaranteed in
the Bill of Rights.

New York — The stock market rose in fairly ac

drawing strength from generally favorable com
pany earning reports.
The Dow (ones average of 30 industrials strug
gled to a 4.94 gain to close at 839.14, following
declines in the previous two sessions.
Big Board volume came to 27.26 million shares,
up from Wednesday's 25.31 million.

under control. All agree, though, that a recession
with much higher unemployment will occur if in
flation is not brought down from its current rate of
about 9.5 percent.
Government as well as private economists had
predicted that unemployment would remain
above 6 percent in 1978. However, economic
growth proved stronger than anticipated, and the
jobless rate fell from 6.2 percent last winter to 5.8
percent during the final three months of the year.
Releases to be delayed in Tenn.
Nashville — Gov. Lamar Alexander s?id yester
day that he probably won't be able to block the 52
pardons and commutations issued by his pre
decessor, Ray Blanton, two days before Blanton
left office in disgrace.
But Alexander said he will at least be able to
delay the release of 17 prisoners who became elig
ible for immediate release under Blanton's Mon
day night order.
Meanwhile, a federal grand jury reconvened
yesterday to continue its investigation of whether
clemency \Vas for sale in the Blanton administra
tion.
Blanton, a Democrat, signed three pardons and
49 sentence commutations Monday night. The
prisoners involved included 24 murderers, and the
legal papers showed 30 became eligible for im
mediate freedom. The other 22 had their sen
tences cut but still had time to serve. Blanton's
aides hinted more pardons and commutations
may have been on the way.
Senate passes anti-busing bill
Sacramento — A constitutional amendment de
signed to sharply limit the power of California
judges to integrate schools was approved over
whelmingly yesterday by the state Senate.
It was the third time since 1977 that the upper
house had approved such a measure, aimed
primarily at overturning Los Angeles' massive bus
ing program.
A 31-5 vote sent the amendment to the more
liberal Assembly, where the two earlier measures
died in committee. At least 27 votes, a two-thirds
majority in the 40-seat Senate, were needed for
passage.
Approval by both houses would put the
amendment on the ballot next year.
The amendment, by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van
Nuys) would force California courts to use the
standards of the U.S. Supreme Court in deciding
whether schools should be integrated.
The federal high court currently says school dis
tricts can be required to integrate only if there is
evidence of intentional segregation.
The California Supreme Court says schools must

integrate regardless of cause.
But it is questionable whether the bill would
block the Los Angeles program because at least
one judge has found that school officials there had
"affirmatively" promoted racial separation.
Probes to begin in BART blaze
Oakland — Commuters struggled through a
seven-mile traffic jam to their jobs in San Francisco
yesterday as fire officials sought thecause of Wed
nesday's Bay Area Rapid Transit tunnel fire, which
killed a fireman and hospitalized at least 35 per
sons.
At a morning news conference, BART General
Manager Keith Bernard said the cause of the fire
was unknown. Both BART and the state Public
Utilities Commission said they hoped to begin
hearings into the accident today.
Fire officials and BART information officer Mike
Healy said government red tape was at least partly
to blame for the toxic smoke that probably killed
Oakland fireman William Elliot, 50, of Castro Val
ley.
Brown blasts Carter comments
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown accused Presi
dent jimmy Carter of "scare tactics" yesterday
after Carter criticized the Californian's call for a
U.S. constitutional convention to prohibit federal
budget deficits.
It was the sharpest and most direct criticism
Brown has made of Carter since he challenged
Carter in 1976 for the Democratic nomination for
president.
Brown attacked the president both directly and
indirectly at a news conference, responding to
Carter's statement Wednesday that the sort of
convention Brown endorsed would be "extremely
dangerous."
Carter cited concerns voiced by liberals who say
theyfeara convention to amend the U.S. Constitu
tion could undercut civil liberties guaranteed in
the Bill of Rights.

Purchases push economy ahead
Washington — An holiday buying
spree by shoppers pushed the nation's economy
ahead at an unusually fast pace and reduced the
chances of a recession, a government report indi
cated yesterday.
The fa.l percent growth rate in the fourth quarter
was nearly double what many economists had
been predicting several months ago. It was consi
dered high enough to keep the unemployment
rate from rising above 6 percent for awhile.
The Commerce Department report showed that
consumers led the fourth-quarter boom by buying
more autos and Christmas gifts, but they also bor
rowed more money for their increased spending.
One reason they went further into debt was
worsening inflation, the report showed.
It said that prices for all of 1978 averaged 7.4
percent higher than they were in 1977, the highest
inflation rate since the 9.fa percent figure recorded
in 1975.
Inflation was getting worse at the end of the year
as prices rose at an 8.1 percent rate in the fourth
quarter.
Some economists have said that consumers may
be overextending themselves. When borrowing
eventually slows, they say the economy may grind
to a halt.
Vietnamese bomb Camboida
Bangkok, Thailand — Vietnamese-piloted Ameri
can and Soviet warplanes darted over the skies of
Cambodia yesterday, bombing and strafing re
mnants of the Cambodian army still resisting the
huge Vietnamese invasion force, analysts re
ported.
Units of the Cambodian army reportedly were
engaged in ground battles in widespread areas of
the country with the Vietnamese and their Cam
bodian rebel allies.
One analyst described the Vietnamese air
strikes as a "replay" on a smaller scale of American
air raids during the Indochina War. The Viet
namese got the American jets the United States
left behind when the communists conquered
South Vietnam in April 1975. The Soviets are allies
of the Vietnamese and supply them with planes
and other war material.
Military analysts said Vietnamese forces as
saulted the Cambodian island bastion of Kong,
launched heavy air strikes against two embattled
coastal port areas and were faced with resistance
in at least half a dozen areas in Cambodia.
Slight rise seen in jobless rate
Washington — The Carter administration is fore

rise only sightly this year, to fa.2 percent, and stay
there in 1980, government sources say.
But most private economists are predicting a
sharper rise, to between fa.s percent and 7 per

cent. Each tenth of one percent stands for about
100,000 jobless Americans.
