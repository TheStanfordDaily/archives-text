# Khomaini rejection heightens political strife throughout Iran
## 
### 
Tehran, Iran (AP) — Armored
troops ran down protesters' cars with
their tanks, royalist gangs rampaged
in the streets and guerrillas attacked
from across the Iraqi border yester
day as Iran searched for a way out of
its deepening political crisis.
Between seven and 21 persons
were reported killed and more than a
dozen others wounded in bloody
fighting across the country.
"Because of the chaos, the nation
is headed for a new type of dictator
ship," Prime Minister Shahpour
Bakhtiar declared in a nationwide
broadcast address last night.
New blow
Bakhtiar's shaky government, de
sperately trying to assert control, was
dealt a new blow yesterday by Ayatul
lah Khomaini, moral leader of the
movement that drove Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from the
country. Bakhtiar had sent an envoy
to try to negotiate with the exiled
Khomaini in France, but the Moslem
holy man rejected any discussion of a
reconciliation.
Aides said Khomaini still maintains
that the shah-endorsed, U.S.-backed
government is illegal, demands its
abolition and intends to establish an
Islamic republic — "no ifs, ands or
buts," said one.
Rebuff to Carter
This was a rebuff of President
jimmy Carter's appeal to Khomaini
Wednesday to give the new govern
ment "a chance to succeed."
The worst bloodshed yesterday
was in the western oil-belt town of
Dezful. Iranian military sources said
tank-borne troops battled several
thousand anti-shah militants after
some of the protesters harassed the
families of military officers.
The enraged soldiers battered pro
testers' autos with their tanks, the

sources said. They said six persons
were killed and more than a dozen
injured. Others said as many as 20
persons had died.
U.S. Air Force evacuates
U.S. Air Force planes evacuated 17
Americans, most of them military ad
visers, from a nearby air base as the
violence flared in Dezful, a U.S.
military spokesman said. Many of the
anti-shah protests have been bitterly
anti-American as well. The spokes
man said the evacuation was a pre
cautionary measure.
In Tehran last night, witnesses said
three gangs of club-wielding, pro
shah militants, each numbering
about 300 persons, were attacking
automobiles bearing Khomaini's pic
ture.
There were no immediate reports
of injuries in Tehran, however.
On the southwest border with
Iraq, Kurdish tribesmen based in Iraq
attacked an Iranian military post near
the Iranian city of Sardasht. Two Ira
nian soldiers were reported
wounded and three taken prisoner.
Border skirmishes
It was a recurrence of sporadic
border skirmishing between the
Kurds and the Iranian military. The
shah had supported the Kurdish re
bels in their separatist war against
Iraq until 1974, when he and the
Iraqis patched up their differences.
In other incidents pointing up the
near-anarchy in Iran, the Tehran
newspaper Kayhan reported that
workers and farmers were trying to
seize a machinery factory and farm
land belonging to the shah's brother,
Prince Cholam Reza, who is now out
of the country.
The report said the factory workers
claimed they had not been paid, and
it said one of the farmers was killed in

a fight yesterday with the prince's
security men.
The state radio reported peaceful
anti-shah demonstrations in six
places in the country. Massive
crowds were expected to turn out for
a march and public prayer session in
Tehran today called hy Khomaini to
show opposition to Bakhtiar and the
shah.
The Iranian monarch, his throne
undermined by a year of bloody dis
turbances and damaging labor
strikes, left Iran on Tuesday on a va
cation'' that many here believe will
end in permanent exile. He went to
Egypt first and is traveling on to the
United States.
Before leaving he endorsed the
government led by Bakhtiar, but the
new prime minister appears to have
little popular support.
Bakhtiar said he sent Jalal Tehrani,
head of the Regency Council that is
acting in the shah's place, to Paris "to
explain the government's program"
to Khomaini "and obtain his views."
Demands fulfilled
"The majority of the demands of
. . . Khomaini have been fulfilled,"
Bakhtiar said, "and the restare under
consideration."
But a Khomaini aide in France said
any discussion of a reconciliation is
"out of the question." Khomaini,
head of Iran's dominant Shiite Mos
lem sect, has called on Iranians to
direct their struggle against Bakhtiar
now that the shah has left.
The religious leader is putting to
gether a "provisional government"
that he says will transform Iran into
an Islamic republic. Khomaini, who
denounces Bakhtiar for having
reached an accommodation with the
shah, will return to Iran soon, his
aides said.

three gangs of club-wielding, pro
shah militants, each numbering
about 300 persons, were attacking
automobiles bearing Khomaini's pic
ture.
There were no immediate reports
of injuries in Tehran, however.
On the southwest border with
Iraq, Kurdish tribesmen based in Iraq
attacked an Iranian military post near
the Iranian city of Sardasht. Two Ira
nian soldiers were reported
wounded and three taken prisoner.
Border skirmishes
It was a recurrence of sporadic
border skirmishing between the
Kurds and the Iranian military. The
shah had supported the Kurdish re
bels in their separatist war against
Iraq until 1974, when he and the
Iraqis patched up their differences.
In other incidents pointing up the
near-anarchy in Iran, the Tehran
newspaper Kayhan reported that
workers and farmers were trying to
seize a machinery factory and farm
land belonging to the shah's brother,
Prince Cholam Reza, who is now out
of the country.
The report said the factory workers
claimed they had not been paid, and
it said one of the farmers was killed in

a fight yesterday with the prince's
security men.
The state radio reported peaceful
anti-shah demonstrations in six
places in the country. Massive
crowds were expected to turn out for
a march and public prayer session in
Tehran today called hy Khomaini to
show opposition to Bakhtiar and the
shah.
The Iranian monarch, his throne
undermined by a year of bloody dis
turbances and damaging labor
strikes, left Iran on Tuesday on a va
cation'' that many here believe will
end in permanent exile. He went to
Egypt first and is traveling on to the
United States.
Before leaving he endorsed the
government led by Bakhtiar, but the
new prime minister appears to have
little popular support.
Bakhtiar said he sent Jalal Tehrani,
head of the Regency Council that is
acting in the shah's place, to Paris "to
explain the government's program"
to Khomaini "and obtain his views."
Demands fulfilled
"The majority of the demands of
. . . Khomaini have been fulfilled,"
Bakhtiar said, "and the restare under
consideration."
But a Khomaini aide in France said
any discussion of a reconciliation is
"out of the question." Khomaini,
head of Iran's dominant Shiite Mos
lem sect, has called on Iranians to
direct their struggle against Bakhtiar
now that the shah has left.
The religious leader is putting to
gether a "provisional government"
that he says will transform Iran into
an Islamic republic. Khomaini, who
denounces Bakhtiar for having
reached an accommodation with the
shah, will return to Iran soon, his
aides said.
Tehran, Iran (AP) — Armored
troops ran down protesters' cars with
their tanks, royalist gangs rampaged
in the streets and guerrillas attacked
from across the Iraqi border yester
day as Iran searched for a way out of
its deepening political crisis.
Between seven and 21 persons
were reported killed and more than a
dozen others wounded in bloody
fighting across the country.
"Because of the chaos, the nation
is headed for a new type of dictator
ship," Prime Minister Shahpour
Bakhtiar declared in a nationwide
broadcast address last night.
New blow
Bakhtiar's shaky government, de
sperately trying to assert control, was
dealt a new blow yesterday by Ayatul
lah Khomaini, moral leader of the
movement that drove Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from the
country. Bakhtiar had sent an envoy
to try to negotiate with the exiled
Khomaini in France, but the Moslem
holy man rejected any discussion of a
reconciliation.
Aides said Khomaini still maintains
that the shah-endorsed, U.S.-backed
government is illegal, demands its
abolition and intends to establish an
Islamic republic — "no ifs, ands or
buts," said one.
Rebuff to Carter
This was a rebuff of President
jimmy Carter's appeal to Khomaini
Wednesday to give the new govern
ment "a chance to succeed."
The worst bloodshed yesterday
was in the western oil-belt town of
Dezful. Iranian military sources said
tank-borne troops battled several
thousand anti-shah militants after
some of the protesters harassed the
families of military officers.
The enraged soldiers battered pro
testers' autos with their tanks, the

sources said. They said six persons
were killed and more than a dozen
injured. Others said as many as 20
persons had died.
U.S. Air Force evacuates
U.S. Air Force planes evacuated 17
Americans, most of them military ad
visers, from a nearby air base as the
violence flared in Dezful, a U.S.
military spokesman said. Many of the
anti-shah protests have been bitterly
anti-American as well. The spokes
man said the evacuation was a pre
cautionary measure.
