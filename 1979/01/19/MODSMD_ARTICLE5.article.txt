# Senate studies Coors ban but blocks moratorium; debates mascot issue
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate overwhelmingly
defeated a proposal to recommend
placing a moratorium on ASSU deal
ings with Adolph Coors Company
last night, opting instead to instruct
ASSU officers to act as they see fit
until the senate adopts a formal posi
tion on the issue.
COP member Andrew Golden
krantz had urged the moratorium as
part of a nationwide boycott against
Coors protesting alleged unfair labor
practices by the company.
The senate also voted to hold a
spring quarter referendum to deter
mine a new mascot. Nominees can
be placed on the ballot by the senate
or student petition.
Howard Wallace, Bay Area coor
dinator of the Coors boycott, told the
senate that Coors is an employer
which has distinguished itself in the
industrial field for its "outrageous in
fringement on basic human rights."
He charged the corporation with re
quiring a lie detector test forall pros
pective employees, a test which he
said pried into private lives.
Forced searches
Wallace said that Coors claims the
right to fire any employee making
disparaging remarks about the com
pany or its product.
Wallace added that Coors has a
bad record on minority hiring.
Coors has agreed to sponsor ASSU
Special Events for $1000 towards the

winter quarter jazz concert series. Al
though the first of the six concerts
starts today, no formal agreement
with Coors has been signed.
Wallace urged the senate to find
other sponsors for the event.
'Distorting' facts
Robert Carrol, a San Francisco at
torney and a representative of Coors,
accused Wallace of "distorting" the
facts. Wallace had claimed the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
had brought charges against Coors
for unfair labor practices. Carrol said
such complaints had been filed, but
the case was dismissed by an NLRB
judge, and his decision was upheld
on appeal.
Carrol said that (he union, AFL
CIO Local 366, which initiated the

boycott, no longer represents the
workers in the Coors brewery. In a
recent election, the workers voted
out the union.
Coldenkrantz said that the vote
was taken among workers not in the
union and added that the Coors
management told its present work
ers that if they voted to support the
union, they would lose their jobs to
the boycotters.
Coldenkrantz urged the
moratorium on accepting Coors
sponsorship of any ASSU events. He
said that if the senate accepted the
money and later decided to support
the boycott, it would lose its credibil
ity, having already taken the money.
On the other hand, he added, if the
