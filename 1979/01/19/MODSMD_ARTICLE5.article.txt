# Senate studies Coors ban but blocks moratorium; debates mascot issue
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate overwhelmingly
defeated a proposal to recommend
placing a moratorium on ASSU deal
ings with Adolph Coors Company
last night, opting instead to instruct
ASSU officers to act as they see fit
until the senate adopts a formal posi
tion on the issue.
COP member Andrew Golden
krantz had urged the moratorium as
part of a nationwide boycott against
Coors protesting alleged unfair labor
practices by the company.
The senate also voted to hold a
spring quarter referendum to deter
mine a new mascot. Nominees can
be placed on the ballot by the senate
or student petition.
Howard Wallace, Bay Area coor
dinator of the Coors boycott, told the
senate that Coors is an employer
which has distinguished itself in the
industrial field for its "outrageous in
fringement on basic human rights."
He charged the corporation with re
quiring a lie detector test forall pros
pective employees, a test which he
said pried into private lives.
Forced searches
Wallace said that Coors claims the
right to fire any employee making
disparaging remarks about the com
pany or its product.
Wallace added that Coors has a
bad record on minority hiring.
Coors has agreed to sponsor ASSU
Special Events for $1000 towards the

winter quarter jazz concert series. Al
though the first of the six concerts
starts today, no formal agreement
with Coors has been signed.
Wallace urged the senate to find
other sponsors for the event.
'Distorting' facts
Robert Carrol, a San Francisco at
torney and a representative of Coors,
accused Wallace of "distorting" the
facts. Wallace had claimed the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
had brought charges against Coors
for unfair labor practices. Carrol said
such complaints had been filed, but
the case was dismissed by an NLRB
judge, and his decision was upheld
on appeal.
Carrol said that (he union, AFL
CIO Local 366, which initiated the

boycott, no longer represents the
workers in the Coors brewery. In a
recent election, the workers voted
out the union.
Coldenkrantz said that the vote
was taken among workers not in the
union and added that the Coors
management told its present work
ers that if they voted to support the
union, they would lose their jobs to
the boycotters.
Coldenkrantz urged the
moratorium on accepting Coors
sponsorship of any ASSU events. He
said that if the senate accepted the
money and later decided to support
the boycott, it would lose its credibil
ity, having already taken the money.
On the other hand, he added, if the

senate refused the Coors money, the
ASSU could always go back and ask
for it later.
Taking a stand
Sen. Alex Alben said that if the se
nate did place the moratorium, it
would be taking a stand on the issue.
He said it had been made clear to the
representative from Special Events
who was at the meeting that there
was some feeling against Coors on
campus and that with that informa
tion, Special Events could "act ac
cordingly."
Alben said that passing the
moratorium could give Special
Events no new information and could
harm the senate's reputation if they
decided to reverse their decision la
ter.
Bottle ban discussed
In other action, new athletic direc
tor Andy Geiger told the senate that
while he hasn't consulted his staff
yet, he was "certainly receptive" to
re-opening the discussion of the ban
on bottles, cans and alcohol being
brought into Stanford Stadium.
He said he was not yet sure of the
reasons for the ban, but conceded
that "if we ban can 1 - for safety's sake
and then we sell them inside, that's
obviously an inconsistent policy."
Geiger also spoke on the mascot
issue, saying that athletes would

have a major part in the decision, but
that their voice would not count
more than the students at large.
Geiger added that while the mas
cot issue is important, his major con
cern is the quality of athletic prog
rams here.
Sports court li^htinj*
He said he was favorable towards
lighting several tennis and basketball
courts on campus and said club
sports need more funding. He was
also receptive to a suggestion that
the intramural sign-up procedure be
handled on a campus computer sys
tem to eliminate the long lines in
volved in registering a team.
The senate heard the report of
Academic Organization Board
chairman Clinton Killian on the
board's fall quarter allocations. The
board gave over $.JOOO to various
pre-professional and academically
oriented groups on campus.
Double billing
Senate chairperson Peter Stamos
said he has called Acting Medical
School Dean Lawrence Crowley
three times and written one letter to
invite him to speak before the senate
on the issue of alleged "double bil
ling" by the Center.
Last meeting the senate voted to
invite Crowley after voting to con
demn the billing practice if it does
indeed occur.

Wallace urged the senate to find
other sponsors for the event.
'Distorting' facts
Robert Carrol, a San Francisco at
torney and a representative of Coors,
accused Wallace of "distorting" the
facts. Wallace had claimed the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
had brought charges against Coors
for unfair labor practices. Carrol said
such complaints had been filed, but
the case was dismissed by an NLRB
judge, and his decision was upheld
on appeal.
Carrol said that (he union, AFL
CIO Local 366, which initiated the

boycott, no longer represents the
workers in the Coors brewery. In a
recent election, the workers voted
out the union.
Coldenkrantz said that the vote
was taken among workers not in the
union and added that the Coors
management told its present work
ers that if they voted to support the
union, they would lose their jobs to
the boycotters.
Coldenkrantz urged the
moratorium on accepting Coors
sponsorship of any ASSU events. He
said that if the senate accepted the
money and later decided to support
the boycott, it would lose its credibil
ity, having already taken the money.
On the other hand, he added, if the

senate refused the Coors money, the
ASSU could always go back and ask
for it later.
Taking a stand
Sen. Alex Alben said that if the se
nate did place the moratorium, it
would be taking a stand on the issue.
He said it had been made clear to the
representative from Special Events
who was at the meeting that there
was some feeling against Coors on
campus and that with that informa
tion, Special Events could "act ac
cordingly."
Alben said that passing the
moratorium could give Special
Events no new information and could
harm the senate's reputation if they
decided to reverse their decision la
ter.
Bottle ban discussed
In other action, new athletic direc
tor Andy Geiger told the senate that
while he hasn't consulted his staff
yet, he was "certainly receptive" to
re-opening the discussion of the ban
on bottles, cans and alcohol being
brought into Stanford Stadium.
He said he was not yet sure of the
reasons for the ban, but conceded
that "if we ban can 1 - for safety's sake
and then we sell them inside, that's
obviously an inconsistent policy."
Geiger also spoke on the mascot
issue, saying that athletes would

have a major part in the decision, but
that their voice would not count
more than the students at large.
Geiger added that while the mas
cot issue is important, his major con
cern is the quality of athletic prog
rams here.
Sports court li^htinj*
He said he was favorable towards
lighting several tennis and basketball
courts on campus and said club
sports need more funding. He was
also receptive to a suggestion that
the intramural sign-up procedure be
handled on a campus computer sys
tem to eliminate the long lines in
volved in registering a team.
The senate heard the report of
Academic Organization Board
chairman Clinton Killian on the
board's fall quarter allocations. The
board gave over $.JOOO to various
pre-professional and academically
oriented groups on campus.
Double billing
Senate chairperson Peter Stamos
said he has called Acting Medical
School Dean Lawrence Crowley
three times and written one letter to
invite him to speak before the senate
on the issue of alleged "double bil
ling" by the Center.
Last meeting the senate voted to
invite Crowley after voting to con
demn the billing practice if it does
indeed occur.
The ASSU Senate overwhelmingly
defeated a proposal to recommend
placing a moratorium on ASSU deal
ings with Adolph Coors Company
last night, opting instead to instruct
ASSU officers to act as they see fit
until the senate adopts a formal posi
tion on the issue.
COP member Andrew Golden
krantz had urged the moratorium as
part of a nationwide boycott against
Coors protesting alleged unfair labor
practices by the company.
The senate also voted to hold a
spring quarter referendum to deter
mine a new mascot. Nominees can
be placed on the ballot by the senate
or student petition.
Howard Wallace, Bay Area coor
dinator of the Coors boycott, told the
senate that Coors is an employer
which has distinguished itself in the
industrial field for its "outrageous in
fringement on basic human rights."
He charged the corporation with re
quiring a lie detector test forall pros
pective employees, a test which he
said pried into private lives.
Forced searches
Wallace said that Coors claims the
right to fire any employee making
disparaging remarks about the com
pany or its product.
Wallace added that Coors has a
bad record on minority hiring.
Coors has agreed to sponsor ASSU
Special Events for $1000 towards the

winter quarter jazz concert series. Al
though the first of the six concerts
starts today, no formal agreement
with Coors has been signed.

other sponsors for the event.
