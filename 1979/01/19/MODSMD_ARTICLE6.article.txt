# 'Barely noticeable here'
## Last total eclipse of century to occur Feb. 26 
### BILL POWEL 
Ancient man thought that dark skies at midday
meant the world was ending. In medieval times,
kings believed that a dragon was devouring the
moon. Now North Americans will soon see the
same phenomenon for the last time in the 20th
century: a solar eclipse.
On February 26, the moon will pass between the
sun and the earth and create the illusion of dark
ness for several minutes as the moon's 195 mile
shadow races at about 3000 miles per hour east
ward towards Canada and Greenland.
Here at the University, the moon will begin to
cover the right edge of the sun at 7 a.m. and the
maximum eclipse will occur at 8:02 a.m. when 88
percent of the sun's surface will be covered. The
moon's shadow will leave the left edge of the sun
at 9 a.m. here.
The longest duration for the total eclipse near a
populated area will be in Brandon, MT, for about
three minutes. Citizens in Winnepeg, Manitoba
will experience about 2 minutes and 50 seconds of
totality.
Although an 88 percent loss of sunlight seems
large, the eclipse will be "barely noticeable" in the
Bay Area, according to Dr. Alan Friedman, direc
tor of astronomy and physics education at the

Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley.
"Since the sun is so bright, it will look the same
as when there's a cloudy haze. Only when the
maximum eclipse reaches around 99 percent does
the change in brightness become dramatic."
Friedman also said that personnel at Lawrence
plan to set up many telescopes to project the sun's
image on screens so the public may safely view the
eclipse.
Among the many experiments which will be
conducted during the eclipse is an investigation of
sunspot activity. California Instituteof Technology
Astrophysics Prof. Harold Zirin said he will use
many large dish-shaped telescopes to try to locate
the exact positions of sunspots, using the amount
of radio emissions from the sun's "edge" during
the eclipse as a guide.
A greater knowledge of the sun is important
because scientists believe that sunspots affect
communications and the weather on earth.
Although no research is planned at the Univer
sity here a group of 10 to 20 astronomy un
dergraduates, graduates, and professors plan to
drive to the Columbia River basin in Washington
to view the eclipse "just for fun," according to
Frank Muennemann, a graduate student in
applied physics and astrophysics here. Muen

nemann said he hopes that the weather holds,
since any clouds would completely obscure the
view of the eclipse.
Like Stanford, the Lick Observatory on Mount
Hamilton in San jose is not planning any experi
ments in conjunction with the solar eclipse. Dan
Lester, a graduate student at the observatory, said
"solar astronomy doesn't rely on eclipses to look
at the corona (the bright outer rim) of the sun,
since sophisticated telescopes can block out the
sun to examine the corona."
Lester added that there are several safe methods
which protect the eyes when observing the partial
eclipse. Since staring directly at the sun can cause
severe damage to the retina of the eye or perhaps
even blindness, Lester suggested that viewers
look through one or two pieces of glass, darkened
with candle smoke so that the sun's rays will be
reduced. A safer way, he said, is to project the
sun's image from a telescope or binoculars onto a
piece of white cardboard.
North Americans will have to wait until 2024 for
the next total solar eclipse. However, Hawaiians
will experience a total eclipse on |uly 11, 1991.
Next year, people in Central Africa, India, and
China will be able to see a total eclipse on February
16.

"solar astronomy doesn't rely on eclipses to look
at the corona (the bright outer rim) of the sun,
since sophisticated telescopes can block out the
sun to examine the corona."
Lester added that there are several safe methods
which protect the eyes when observing the partial
eclipse. Since staring directly at the sun can cause
severe damage to the retina of the eye or perhaps
even blindness, Lester suggested that viewers
look through one or two pieces of glass, darkened
with candle smoke so that the sun's rays will be
reduced. A safer way, he said, is to project the
sun's image from a telescope or binoculars onto a
piece of white cardboard.
North Americans will have to wait until 2024 for
the next total solar eclipse. However, Hawaiians
will experience a total eclipse on |uly 11, 1991.
Next year, people in Central Africa, India, and
China will be able to see a total eclipse on February
16.
