### 
Washington (AP) — Lower
class teenagers are less likely
than their more affluent peers
to get mixed up with religious
or racial cults because they
"can recognize a street hus
tle," a California psychiatrist
says.
"Very few of the cults are
able to recruit lower-class
young adults, either black or
white," concluded Margaret
Singer, a professor of

psychiatry at UC-San Francisco.
In an article in a recent edi
tion of journal, published by
the National Association of Pri
vate Psychiatric Hospitals,
Singer asserted: "Lower-class
youths in the United States,
primarily, know there are no
free dinners and no free meals.
They can recognize a street
hustle."
Singer said there are some
250 different cults and that the

larger and more prominent
ones use extremely sophisti
cated recruitment methods
which are taught to their fol
lowers.
These methods include get
ting close enough to gaze into
a person's eye to determine if
the person is a warm, loving
person who would be easy to
recruit or one who would be
hard to get.
"They begin their love
bombing of the new recruit
from that point onward," she
wrote. "Middle- and upper
class young adults have not
had enough experience with
street hustlers in growing up to
know how artful deceivers on
the street can operate."
The psychiatrist said she
based her research on inter
views with 250 young people
with cult experience.
