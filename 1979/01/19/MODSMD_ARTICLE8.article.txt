# Savoyards master opera craft
## 
### ROD STEVENS 
Opera. Light opera. Formid
able forms that drive many
away. But consider a Gilbert
and Sullivan opera, with good
music and satirical and witty
lines. After watching a perfor
mance you may judge opera
differently.
Twice each year the Stanford
Savoyards produce a Gilbert
and Sullivan opera that sells
out most performances.
Few musicals have achieved
such popularity as those of
Gilbert and Sullivan, more than
100 years after they were first
produced. With clever words
and a unique brand of English
humor, characters satirize the
stuffy and self-important as
pects of society.
Written for a self-critical Vic
torian audience, the operas
often aroused scandals as they
panned contemporary institu
tions and stereotypes. Despite
their topical humor, however,
"the themes are incredibly
contemporary," notes Tony
McDonald, the Savoyards'
musical director.
On April 20, the Savoyards
will present lolanthe, a satire
that takes swipes at the British
House of Lords and pokes fun
at the rich and powerful ele
ments in society. The opera
exposes unqualified individu
als who "get places," accord
ing to producer Rita Taylor.
No subject seems immune to
the satire of a Gilbert and Sulli
van opera. From the House of
Lords to the lowly cockney,
everyone is ridiculed. Even a
careful listener can't catch all
of the wit the first time. The
chorus, which in most operas
sings with and echoes the lead
characters, may turn against
them.

Gilbert and Sullivan com
panies, usually called
Savoyards, have sprung up
around the world. The Stan
ford Savoyards got their start in
1973 when a group of graduate
students from Cornell Univer
sity couldn't find a local com
pany to sing with. With a $600
grant from the Student Center
for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE) they pre
sented The Pirates of Pen
zance. Many of the costumes
were made from bed sheets.
When lolanthe opens this
spring it will be the product of a
year-long effort involving ap
proximately 120 people and
close to $5000. One of the driv
ing forces behind Savoyard
productions in recent years has
been Taylor.
Taylor, an associate librarian,
was co-producer in the
Savoyards' second season in
1974. "It was clear they were
having a lot of fun when we saw
the Savoyards their first year.
My husband and I decided to
get in on it the following year."
Both Taylors are admitted
Gilbert and Sullivan
aficionados. "I guess you
could say we grew up on
them," Mrs. Taylor said. "After
the Savoyards' first year we of
fered to teach a freshman
seminar. No freshmen signed
up, but a lot of upperclassmen
wanted to take it."
Mrs. Taylor selected this
spring's lolathe last year from a
repertoire of 11 Gilbert and
Sullivan operas commonly
produced. Planning for the

new show began as soon as the
old one opened, she said.
Since August 1978, she's inven
toried costumes, selected pro
ducers and directors, au
ditioned the chorus and leads
and arranged rehearsals.
"We really have a broad base
of interests now in those who
get involved," she said. "You
get addicted to the music once
you've listened to it.
Satire
"I think the Gilbert and Sulli
van satire is still relevant today.
Our production last year of
Patience, for example, made
fun of the aesthetic movement,
and more generally, of the ex
cesses in popular movements.
"Besides the satire, how
ever, I think a big part of the
music's appeal is that it's easy
to listen to and play or sing,"
Mrs. Taylor said.
She admits that the Savoyard
group here was formed after a
period when students rejected
activities that weren't "relev
ant" or activist in nature.
A broad range of people help
produce the musicals each
year, ranging from faculty
wives who sew costumes, to
local high school students who
sing in the chorus.
"Often we get people who
have never performed in pub
lic before. Sometimes musi
cians in the orchestra haven't
played since high school, but
they practice for a few weeks or
months and then audition."
In the course of the produc
tion cast parties, swimming
get-togethers, and an annual

baseball party build a sense of
group unity. Since the or
chestra doesn't start rehearsals
until work on the production
is well underway, the musi
cians often don't get to know
the singers, Mrs. Taylor said.
Alums return
This year's chorus includes a
large number of Savoyards
alumnae who want to participate
in University musicals, but
can't perform in the Music or
Drama departments' produc
tions, which are limited to en
rolled students. Diversity in
performers' ages may be the
backbone of the group's suc
cess.
About 75 pecent of this
year's members participated
last year, too. Recent graduate
Bonnie Senko, now in charge of
costumes, played several lead
female roles for the Savoyards.
John Breakwell, rehearsal
pianist, has acted in Gilbert
and Sullivan musicals since the
19205.
Many people who plan pro
fessional musical careers sing
or direct for the Savoyards.
Working on two operas a year
gives students stage experi
ence, and strong reputations
before they face the competi
tive entertainment market.
Behind the gaiety of the pro
ductions is a strong sense of
discipline among the perfor
mers and crew. The costume
crew is already scrounging for
materials.
The cast meets three times a
week for the nine weeks pre
ceeding opening night.
