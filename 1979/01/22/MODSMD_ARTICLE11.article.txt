## Ethnic houses polarize campus 
### 
At Stanford, the question of race in
the context of student housing is rarely
discussed publicly.
Now a new proposal has come forth,
for a "Semitic" theme house. As this
proposal germinates, we may expect
terms like "cultural insensitivity" and
"ethnic identity" to be bandied about
sympathetically, just as they have in
connection with other ethnic theme
houses. For those other minority
groups, such sanctimony has passed
for necessity.
The result is "cross-cultural" theme
houses, conceived by the Office of Re
sidential Education to provide support
for students of a common racial group
who feel threatened by the values they
believe dominate the University.
Obviously, the creation of such
houses raises important questions
about how ethnic minorities fit into the
framework of our much-hallowed
"University community." And just as
importantly, the fact these houses exist
means their value, both to their resi
dents and the greater community, can
be assessed.
We must consider both of these
points in judging the costs and benefits
of a new ethnic theme house.
To find out as much as I could about
cross-cultural houses. I talked to whites
and ethnics in Ujamaa and Zapata, to
an official in the Office of Residential
Education, and attended a group dis
cussion on the Semitic house concept.
For the minority students who live in
them, Zapata and Ujamaa provide a

supportive, relaxed atmosphere and a
gathering point for cultural and politi
cal activity. But it is just as important to
note than 90 percent of blacks and
Chicanos here do not live in an ethnic
theme house. And in any given ethnic
house, University policy says that only
50 percent of the residents may be
members of the minority group.
In this sense, then, these houses are
primarily symbolic, since their direct
beneficiaries are few. Hence, any
judgment of them must take into ac
count how they benefit their non
ethnic members, and what they add to
the University community.
On both counts, there is room for
definite criticism. In Ujamaa racial di
vision seems especially evident. Only a
few white residents actually requested
to live there. The group of white stu
dents I talked to feel they are "sec
luded" and "not meeting friends."
Living in Ujamaa "is not what I would
call a cultural experience," one person
said matter-of-factly. None of these
students plan to return to Ujamaa next
year. Blacks agree there is some sec
tionalization, especially in the dining
room.
Both blacks and whites feel that the
house is essentially inward-looking, "a
gathering place for blacks, but not
necessarily with the intent of sharing."
In fact, some blacks believe there
would be more campus racial interac
tion without an Ujamaa house. "Now,"
they said, "we almost never see white
people from outside the dorm."

In Zapata, the case is somewhat less
sharp. Although few non-ethnics re
quested to live in the house, almost
everyone feels comfortable there. Still,
activities are not really designed to in
vite the participation of non-Chicanos.
One woman resident, asked how she
had helped in the theme, replied:
"They don't ask me to." According to a
house theme associate, the majority of
campus Chicano activists come from
within Zapata.
Ethnic theme houses, then, not sur
prisingly, have become isolated en
claves for both their minority and
non-minority residents. As one
Chicano stated, "being in a theme
house has a definite polarizing effect."
Some residents feel they have bene
fited from this atmosphere. But
perhaps their gain is illusory. However
distasteful they find the values the Uni
versity embodies, people here are rela
tively open-minded. After Stanford,
harsher value systems will be encoun
tered, and retreat will be much more
difficult.
Besides this there can be seen dis
tinct disadvantages for the University
community. On the one hand, the Uni
versity actively seeks a diverse ethnic
and geographic group of students to
enrich itself. It then seems counter
productive to create sanctuaries within
where people spend the bulk of their
time with others like them.
More importantly, both minorities
and non-minorities suffer from this lack
of interaction. Potential sources of ex

change and growth are cut away. The
opportunity that supposedly comes
from attending a university like Stan
ford is lost.
It is in the context of these benefits
and cost*- that we must weigh the prop
osed Semitic theme house. Jewish or
ganizations on campus are extremely
energetic, and, because activists are
spread throughout the community,
most of us are aware of this energy.
Concentrating activists in one house
seems counterproductive to this.
Yet in the broad sense it is unfair to
ask minority group members to bear
the burden of an acculturation process,
to live in places or with groups they feel
are unsympathetic or even hostile. But
it is also too easy to shunt activists off to
Stern or Lagunita, while non-ethnic
themes get choice Row House loca
tions.
Instead, the Office of Residential
Education might begin by asking itself
why so few minority students live on
the Row, and why so many choose to
live off campus or in the relative seclu
sion of Mirrielees. Amid the
sanctimony of "social consciousness,"
one of the housing system's most
noticeable problems has been treated
in only the most superficial sense.
There is enough separation in the
"real world." In the community of the
University, which is artificial because of
its supposed idealism, we should strive
for better.
