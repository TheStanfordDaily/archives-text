## Confessions of a Stanford Band groupie 
### 
Right away (he word "con
fessions" implies sin and guilt;
but hold on, this is no embar
rassed, giggling rock-star
groupie writing her wildest
fantasies for Teen Magazine â€”
close, but definitely not the
same.
Yes, three people in my fam
ily got Band albums for Christ
mas. Yes, I have three of them
myself. Yes, I designed and
sold (and am still selling if you
want one), Band T-shirts. Yes, I
danced alongside the Band on
every all-campus rally. Yes, I
showed up at every home
football game, though I hate
football, knowing each pre
game and half-time show well
in advance. Yes, I sneaked into
the end of two Gaieties, and
saw one complete show, to see
the Band come on at the end to
do "All Right Now." Yes, Yes,
Yes, Yes, Yes!
Okay, the question is, Why?
Well, it went something like
this.
Freshman orientation week,
off the plane from New York, a
stranger in a strange land. I'm
moving into the notorious
Burbank House when, sud
denly, I see a guy struggling
through the door with a suit
case and a conga drum.
"A conga drum?" I said.
"Yeah, a conga drum."
"That's just excellent!"
"Hey, well thanks. I'm gonna
play it in Band." (Note the ab
sence of the word 'the' before
Band').
"Oh, you must be a
freshman," he said.
"Yeah, I'm a freshman. What
Band?" The initial interest ap
parent in this persistent ques
tioning was due to my avid in

terest in jazz and general ob
session with music; I thought
he might have meant a jazz
band.
"Well, it's the Stanford
Marching Band. It's really
great. If you want to see us,
we're doing an all-campus this
afternoon, lust go up to White
Plaza and you'll hear us around
somewhere."
"Okay, thanks."
Later, that same day:
Walking out of Tresidder,
having just stood for 45 mi
nutes in line to open a bank
account, a sound, faint and
elusive, came by me, horns
and drumming. I cocked my
head to one side, closed my
eyes, and, pointing my finger
in the direction of Flo Mo, I
said, "That way." Aha, my
brain put two and two to
gether; that must be the Band.
I followed my ear to a then
totally foreign and exotic part
of campus, through the small
underpass at Flo Mo and then
stood frozen, wide-eyed and
awestruck. My head turned
slowly, eyes taking in the horn
players all over the roofs,
dribbling out of windows, just
everywhere, blowing, danc
ing, laughing, wearing every
thing from chains to scuba gear
to a banana suit.
Then I recognized the song
they were playing. It was the
Chicago song "Beginnings."
How utterly prophetic.
Eh maintenant, la piece de
resistance, a small, rhythmic
frenzy of motion reminiscent
of court jester, lagger and As
taire. He's wearing cut-offs
which also seem to be cut
outs, and managing somehow
to hold the whole show to
gether with a silvery stick that

sparkles in the sun just a little
bit brighter than that punk-'
leprechaun glint in his eye.
This is the Band's version of a
drum major.
Transfixed, it is only when
the final drum/mug solo is over
that I realize I have been
somewhat of r frenzy cf mo
tion myself. But before I have
time to even think about all
this, the circus is moving on.
"Follow us to the row," they
beckon sarcastically. At that
point, they might as well have
said "To the ends of the earth."
Needless to say, I followed
all over campus 'till, finally,
they ended up where any hot
sweaty band would want to
play, in deGuerre Pool. By that
time, I was dancing with the
Tree and cheering wildly.
You're walking along
anywhere, anytime and you
focus in on anything at all, and
suddenly a quiet voice in your
head pronounces the all-too
innocent phrase, "Wouldn't
that look nice in the Shak?"
That phrase has generally re
ferred to road signs, but there
have been some interesting
exceptions which I won't men
tion for fear of tipping off Sec
ret Agent Edward Embo, re
cently sent from the Houston
Astrodome security force and
from Marriott Hotels, Inc.
But all this is missing the
point which is, for me, the
music. I'll never understand
how people just stood still at
the post-game concerts. I al
ways had to move and dance.
Songs I would formerly have
refused to play on my turnta- j
ble, are now greeted with an
enthusiastic salute, "Band
Chart!" because the arrange
ments and style of playing are

such a perfect fusion of big jazz
brass with thecharisma of early
Stones drumming.
There is a sheer power to
Band music, an exuberance
that expresses a real love of
playing. This is what I ap
preciate and relate to most
about the Band.
No, Ann Landers, this con
fession is not for you. I know
what I'm going to do about this
strange fixation. I'm learning to
play sax and I'm going to be out

there, a total red-hot froshfart,
when spring finally rolls
around and lights up the cam
pus.
Until then, I'll find other
ways to keep up my Smiley Bal
loon Face (including seeing
Red Vest Band at basketball
games). Because my favorite
Band motto is, no, not "Drugs,
Sex and Violins," hut "You
Ought to be Having Fun."
