# Game companies reject Quadra Chess
## Inventor pursues confident strategy 
### BILL FOX 
Three years ago Honey
Sauberman, a technical prop
osals editor for Singer Simula
tion Devices in San Jose, was
"an average person with a 9 to 5
job who went to work, went
home, went to work."
Today, Sauberman is a game
inventor and business woman
who is marketing Quadra
Chess.
Quadra Chess is a four-way
chess game, played with four
colored chess armies. The
game, which sells for $20.95, is
played by two to four players
on a standard chess board with
half boards added to each side.
According to its creator,
Quadra Chess is more chal
lenging than normal chess;
playing a game can take from
15 minutes to two hours.
The game is played like stan
dard chess but strategy differs.
A player must use an oppo
nent's force and position to
gain advantage for himself. The
player who defeats an army in
herits the remainder of the de
feated army, Sauberman
explained.
Sauberman conceived the
game idea three years ago. She
wanted to invent a chess game
to be played by more than two
people. Also, Sauberman was
interested in developing a
"standard game."
Standard games, such as
Monopoly, are popular for
many years. They possess cer
tain basic ingredients, said
Sauberman.
"A classic game should be
able to be played within a half
hour; there should be ele
ments of luck and skill; it
should be both challenging
and entertaining; and it should
be able to be played by anyone
from 8 to 80," she said.
Sauberman is confident that,
within 10 years, her game will
be publicly accepted as a stan
dard game.
Since she invented Quadra
Chess, Sauberman has spent
the bulk ot her time promoting
her product. First she con
tacted large game companies
such as Parker Brothers and
Wham-O.
"They told me, 'Chess is
dead. Nobody is buying chess.
We have thousands of sets
stocked in our warehouses.
We're not interested in any
chess games.' "
The game companies also
told her that when a company
won't buy a game idea, the in
ventor has two options: either
to hire an agent to present the
game to various game com
panies, or to privately produce
and market the game and con
vince the game company, by

the game's popularity, that it
would be a marketable suc
cess. Sauberman chose the
second approach.
She sold Quadra Chess sets
to Bullock's 59 game stores
throughout California, and to
the Stanford Bookstore. The
game is also on the shelves at
Bloomingdale's department
store in New York City. Quadra
Chess will be featured in J.C.
Penney's 1979 catalogue and is
now being used as a prop in
ABC's Battlestar Gallactica
series. In the past two years,
5000 sets of Quadra Chess have
been sold.
In marketing her game,
Sauberman encountered sev
eral legal technicalities. She
discovered that someone else
had a patent on the concept of
a four-way chess game, even
though that individual's board
design and rules differ from
Sauberman's. Sauberman does
not own a patent, but was able
to secure a copyright on the
board design and on her
game's rules book.
A patent is a government
grant which gives an inventor
the exclusive rights to make,
use and vend an invention. A
copyright protects the work
from being reproduced and
sold by anyone other than the
copyright holder. Patents can
be challenged, but the process
is cumbersome and expensive,
Sauberman said.
"I am sure that I could get a
patent on my game, but I don't
have the money to pursue
that," she said.
Inventing and marketing
Quadra Chess became more
than a commercial endeavor.

"It became a personal con
quest," Sauberman said.
Sauberman, a shy, polite
woman remembers having lit
tle self-confidence when she
started marketing Quadra
Chess. In order to reach her
goals, Sauberman has de
veloped "an awful lot of confi
dence to overcome a lot of
hardships," she said.
"Having confidence in your
self is imperative if you expect

others to help you. You have to
Sauberman hopes to market
other games if ()uadra Chess is
successful. She also wants to
teach a course on starting a
business and wants, eventu
ally, to own a game company,
use a lot of ingenuity if you
don't have the money. You
also have to get people who are
willing to help you out even
though they won't be paid for a
while," she said.
