# Cowell notes violate Honor Code
## 
### FRAN MILLER 
Professors who require written medical excuses from
students who are unable to take exams are not acting "in
the spirit of the Honor Code," according to a recent
decision by the Honor Code Commission.
Mary Morimoto, a member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, said the demand for notes from Cowell Stu
dent Health Center verifying illness is not a new occurr
ence. Signed excuses from Cowell were in unusually
large demand last quarter, she said.
Dr. James McClenahan, director of Cowell, told the
commission he was disturbed about the flood of re
quests he had been receiving to validate students' illnes
ses. He asked the commission to examine this issue,
Morimoto said.
Although Morimoto said she had heard complaints
from students, she said no one had reported these to the
commission.
There is no specific section of the Honor Code which
deals with this particular issue, Morimoto said. "The
group didn't change the Honor Code but adapted it to
the situation."
Insulting
Morimoto said she thinks "it is very insulting that
several professors don't believe in the general honesty
of students." She said the commission agreed that there
was "no true need" to require written medical excuses

from students unless a professor had "valid reasons to
suspect dishonesty."
According to Morimoto, the commission is not al
lowed to hold hearings of a particular case but can deal
with general issues and problems such as this one.
"I think it would be helpful for students to know that
they do have a course of appeal and that they should
report this kind of incident," she said. The Student Con
duct Legislative Council (SCLC) deals with specific
cases.
In trying to speculate what general reactions faculty
members will have to the recent decision by the com
mission, Morimoto said the practice "might stop if pro
fessors know that they shouldn't do it and that students
have some recourse" by contacting the SCLC.
The subject of professors' demands for written medi
cal excuses has been dealt with previously in the Faculty
Senate, Morimoto said. However, no action was taken
against those professors who demand excuses, she said.
Although the interpretive powers of the Honor Code
Commission are currently a topic open to debate, the
group will continue to discuss and revise certain por
tions of the code itself, Morimoto said.
Members of the commission include the associate
dean of graduate studies, the dean of student affairs, the
ombudsman, a member of the Stanford judiciary Coun
cil, one student, and one faculty member.
