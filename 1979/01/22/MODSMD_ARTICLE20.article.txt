# Women split road games
## 
### RICHARD MARTINEZ 
If the women's basketball
team could erase just two mi
nutes from its weekend con
ference games it would pos
sess a 3-1 NCAC record. It was
in the last two minutes of Fri
day night's game that Stanford
dropped the toughest decision
of its season to Cal, 55-52.
Saturday evening was the
Cards' recovery period as they
rebounded from Friday's dis
appointment and breezed to
victory over Santa Clara, 74-56.
The Cards, now 2-2 in league
play, came out impressively at
Harmon Gym Friday night,
much to the displeasure of the

Bear supporters and the
thoroughly tacky Cal band.
The women opened with
their press working well, their
patient offense taking advan
tage of openings underneath
for easy lay-ups and a sub
sequent 14-7 lead.
Cal maintained its compo
sure, though. The Bears scored
11 straight points and grabbed
an 18-14 lead with eight mi
nutes remaining in the first
half. For the remainder of the
period both defenses played
equally well, grudgingly giving
up points.
In the first three minutes of
the second half Cal burst into
an eight-point lead. All-
Conference forward Colleen
Galloway seemed indefensible
as she hit from the outside with
brilliant form.
The front-court combination
of 6-foot-1 Jill Weddick and
identically-sized Kris Franklin
gave the Cards fits underneath
as many of their combined
total of 17 rebounds gave the
Bears second and third tries
from the floor.
"The basic strength of the
Cal team lies in their big girls,"
stated coach Dottie McCrea.
"They are a tremendous offen
sive team because their fine
rebounding ability gives them
so many more attempts to
shoot."
Louise Smith and Ann Miller
then entered the game and
began to shut off Cal's inside
game. With Stanford's zone
press again causing Bear
bumbles; the Cards turned the
momentum around and ran off
eight unanswered points to tie
the score at 32.
leanne Ruark started hitting
from the inside, Shelly Chap
man began connecting from
long range and Debbie Gore
and Angie Paccione moved the
ball well, contributing seven
and three assists, respectively.
The final 10 minutes gave the
crowd ample reason for having
bitten fingernails, tense
stomachs, and hoarse throats.
The Cards seemed in control of
the game, though, as they
maintained a slim lead ranging
from two to six points.
Unnecessarily rough play by
Cal guard Laura Loggains, un
controlled by the referees,
changed the tempo of the
game with six minutes remain

ing. She was responsible for
four Stanford turnovers and
subsequent Cal baskets as the
Cardinal bench looked on dis
believing that such plays could
not draw any whistles from the
officials. By the time the dam
age was done, Cal had cut Stan
ford's lead from a relatively
comfortable 50-44 to a marginal
52-50.
Stanford was not to score
another basket. The Bears tied
the score, rebounded a Card
miss and converted it into a
two point lead. With 20 sec
onds remaining, the Stanford
players missed McCrea's
time-out signal as the ball was
stolen and Cal's win secured.
Cal's Galloway led all scorers
with 21 points while Shelly
Chapman and Jeanne Ruark
led the Cards with 16 and 14
points, respectively.
In direct contrast, Saturday
evening's game against Santa
Clara was well-officiated,
cleanly played, and rather une
ventful. A much improved
Santa Clara squad held the
Cardinals to a two-point
halftime lead, 38-36.
Stanford then held the Bron
cos' scoring output to2o points
in the second half as kathy
Murphy and Jeanne Ruark
turned in fine defensive per
formances. Most importantly,
the Cards cut their turnovers
from 29 Friday to a season-low
seven Saturday evening.
"The refs called a good game
tonight " stated McCrea. "Our
girls can play extremely well
when the game is kept under
control and the aggressiveness
doesn't get out of hand."
Jeanne Ruark and Angie Pac
cione were the scorers with 22
and 12 points, respectively.

ence champion San Jose State

7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.

subsequent Cal baskets as the
Cardinal bench looked on dis
believing that such plays could
not draw any whistles from the
officials. By the time the dam
age was done, Cal had cut Stan
ford's lead from a relatively
comfortable 50-44 to a marginal
52-50.
Stanford was not to score
another basket. The Bears tied
the score, rebounded a Card
miss and converted it into a
two point lead. With 20 sec
onds remaining, the Stanford
players missed McCrea's
time-out signal as the ball was
stolen and Cal's win secured.
Cal's Galloway led all scorers
with 21 points while Shelly
Chapman and Jeanne Ruark
led the Cards with 16 and 14
points, respectively.
In direct contrast, Saturday
evening's game against Santa
Clara was well-officiated,
cleanly played, and rather une
ventful. A much improved
Santa Clara squad held the
Cardinals to a two-point
halftime lead, 38-36.
Stanford then held the Bron
cos' scoring output to2o points
in the second half as kathy
Murphy and Jeanne Ruark
turned in fine defensive per
formances. Most importantly,
the Cards cut their turnovers
from 29 Friday to a season-low
seven Saturday evening.
"The refs called a good game
tonight " stated McCrea. "Our
girls can play extremely well
when the game is kept under
control and the aggressiveness
doesn't get out of hand."
Jeanne Ruark and Angie Pac
cione were the scorers with 22
and 12 points, respectively.

FRESHMAN GUARD Doug Marty (22) attempts to drive between Washington's Stan Walker (left) and
Lorenzo Romar (right) in last week's 80-69 defeat of the Huskies. Saturday the Cards extended their
winning streak to two games with a 73-50 victory over California.
If the women's basketball
team could erase just two mi
nutes from its weekend con
ference games it would pos
sess a 3-1 NCAC record. It was
in the last two minutes of Fri
day night's game that Stanford
dropped the toughest decision
of its season to Cal, 55-52.
Saturday evening was the
Cards' recovery period as they
rebounded from Friday's dis
appointment and breezed to
victory over Santa Clara, 74-56.
The Cards, now 2-2 in league
play, came out impressively at
Harmon Gym Friday night,
much to the displeasure of the

Bear supporters and the
thoroughly tacky Cal band.
The women opened with
their press working well, their
patient offense taking advan
tage of openings underneath
for easy lay-ups and a sub
sequent 14-7 lead.
Cal maintained its compo
sure, though. The Bears scored
11 straight points and grabbed
an 18-14 lead with eight mi
nutes remaining in the first
half. For the remainder of the
period both defenses played
equally well, grudgingly giving
up points.
In the first three minutes of
the second half Cal burst into
an eight-point lead. All-
Conference forward Colleen
Galloway seemed indefensible
as she hit from the outside with
brilliant form.
The front-court combination
of 6-foot-1 Jill Weddick and
identically-sized Kris Franklin
gave the Cards fits underneath
as many of their combined
total of 17 rebounds gave the
Bears second and third tries
from the floor.
"The basic strength of the
Cal team lies in their big girls,"
stated coach Dottie McCrea.
"They are a tremendous offen
sive team because their fine
rebounding ability gives them
so many more attempts to
shoot."
Louise Smith and Ann Miller
then entered the game and
began to shut off Cal's inside
game. With Stanford's zone
press again causing Bear
bumbles; the Cards turned the
momentum around and ran off
eight unanswered points to tie
the score at 32.
leanne Ruark started hitting
from the inside, Shelly Chap
man began connecting from
long range and Debbie Gore
and Angie Paccione moved the
ball well, contributing seven
and three assists, respectively.
The final 10 minutes gave the
crowd ample reason for having
bitten fingernails, tense
stomachs, and hoarse throats.
The Cards seemed in control of
the game, though, as they
maintained a slim lead ranging
from two to six points.
Unnecessarily rough play by
Cal guard Laura Loggains, un
controlled by the referees,
changed the tempo of the
game with six minutes remain

ing. She was responsible for
four Stanford turnovers and
subsequent Cal baskets as the
Cardinal bench looked on dis
believing that such plays could
not draw any whistles from the
officials. By the time the dam
age was done, Cal had cut Stan
ford's lead from a relatively
