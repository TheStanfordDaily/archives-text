# Belton, Ward, Welch shine
## Cards 'school' Bears, 73-50 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Berkeley — Class was in ses
sion Saturday night at Harmon
Gymnasium, where Stanford
gave California a 73-50 lesson
in how to play an all-around
basketball game.
The Cardinals conducted a
rebounding seminar, grabbing
44 rebounds to Cal's 27.
Professors Kimberly Belton
and Orlando Ward gave pre
sentations on aggressive play
underneath the basket, and in
the second half Dr. Brian
Welch offered an outside
shooting clinic.
Stanford's defenses — man
to-man and zone — were re
warded an "A" for keeping the
Golden Bears off the offensive
boards and forcing them to
shoot almost exclusively from
the perimeters.
With the exception of the
UCLA triumph Dec. 27, this
was probably Stanford's best
effort of the season. The Cards
are now 3-4 in Pacific-10 Con
ference action and 9-7 overall.
"It was a total team victory,"
said Belton. "Tonight everyone
came in and did his job the way
he had to do it."
"There's no excuses on our
part," Cal guard |ohn Caselli
said. "Stanford played a whole
lot better than we did. They
just plain beat us."
A significant part of the beat
ing occurred during the first
seven and a half minutes of the
second half, as the Cards out
scored Cal 18-9 to assume a
commanding 47-32 lead.
Welch's three baskets — a
24-footer, a lay-in and an 18-
footer — highlighted the
surge, and Belton's short
banker over Doug True
climaxed it.

After True's one-hander
made it 53-40, the Cards ad
ministered the fatal blows,
scoring six consecutive points
on Welch's lay-in off an in
bounds play, Belton's lay-in
following a Welch steal, and
Wolfe Perry's 18-footer with
5:41 remaining.
"We had continuous inten
sity," said Ward. "At first they
were intense with us, but they
sort of died later on."
Welch's 8-for-11 marksman
ship paced Stanford's sound
59.3 percent shooting (32-for
-54). Each Card made at least
half of his shots, a remarkable
feat.
"I just had the shots in the
second half," said Welch, who
scored 13 of his 17 points after
intermission. "They were play
ing pretty tight on me in the
first half, so I just played the
waiting game."
The Bears' lack of size
proved to be one of their major
shortcomings. At b-foot-3,
starting forward Walt Gillespie
is actually guard-sized.
Thus Stanford was able to
work the ball inside to its
frontcourt men whenever Cal
played man-to-man. When the
Bears switched to a zone de
fense, Welch, Perry and Paul
Giovacchini would loft sweet
looking outside jumpers
through the hoop.
Shooting represented
another Cal problem, as the
Bears made just 22 of 61 floor
attempts for a sickly 36.1 per
cent.
"When the good shot is av
ailable to you, you have to be
able to 'stick' it," Bear coach
Dick Kuchen explained. "You
need to find the guy who has
the hot hand, and we couldn't

find that guy."
Finally, rebounds proved to
be scarce commodities for the
Bears. The hustling True's
game-high 12 rebounds ac
counted for nearly half Cal's to
tal. "They don't crash the
boards as hard as some of the
teams we've played against,"
Ward said.
In fact, the Bears could use a
couple of players like Ward.
Receiving his first collegiate
starting assignment, the 6-7
pogo stick grabbed a team
high nine rebounds.
"Orlando made some
freshman mistakes early," said
Dißiaso. "He was out of posi
tion in our zone, but he ad
justed and rebounded very
well."
Dißiaso added that Ward
would probably start this
weekend against Oregon State
and Oregon.
Taking mostly powerful
one-hancJed inside shots, Bel
ton led all scorers with 18
points. Backcourt men Perry

(13 points, eight rebounds, five
assists) and Giovacchini (10
points, seven assists) also had
strong games.

points. Backcourt men Perry

(13 points, eight rebounds, five

points, seven assists) also had
strong games.
Berkeley — Class was in ses
sion Saturday night at Harmon
Gymnasium, where Stanford
gave California a 73-50 lesson
in how to play an all-around
basketball game.
The Cardinals conducted a
rebounding seminar, grabbing
44 rebounds to Cal's 27.
Professors Kimberly Belton
and Orlando Ward gave pre
sentations on aggressive play
underneath the basket, and in
the second half Dr. Brian
Welch offered an outside
shooting clinic.
Stanford's defenses — man
to-man and zone — were re
warded an "A" for keeping the
Golden Bears off the offensive
boards and forcing them to
shoot almost exclusively from
the perimeters.
With the exception of the
UCLA triumph Dec. 27, this
was probably Stanford's best
effort of the season. The Cards
are now 3-4 in Pacific-10 Con
ference action and 9-7 overall.
"It was a total team victory,"
said Belton. "Tonight everyone
came in and did his job the way
he had to do it."
"There's no excuses on our
part," Cal guard |ohn Caselli
said. "Stanford played a whole
lot better than we did. They
just plain beat us."
A significant part of the beat
ing occurred during the first
seven and a half minutes of the
second half, as the Cards out
scored Cal 18-9 to assume a
commanding 47-32 lead.
Welch's three baskets — a
24-footer, a lay-in and an 18-
footer — highlighted the
surge, and Belton's short
banker over Doug True
climaxed it.

After True's one-hander
made it 53-40, the Cards ad
ministered the fatal blows,
scoring six consecutive points
on Welch's lay-in off an in
bounds play, Belton's lay-in
following a Welch steal, and
Wolfe Perry's 18-footer with
5:41 remaining.
"We had continuous inten
sity," said Ward. "At first they
were intense with us, but they
sort of died later on."
Welch's 8-for-11 marksman
ship paced Stanford's sound
59.3 percent shooting (32-for
-54). Each Card made at least
half of his shots, a remarkable
feat.
"I just had the shots in the
second half," said Welch, who
scored 13 of his 17 points after
intermission. "They were play
ing pretty tight on me in the
first half, so I just played the
waiting game."
The Bears' lack of size
proved to be one of their major
shortcomings. At b-foot-3,
starting forward Walt Gillespie
is actually guard-sized.
Thus Stanford was able to
work the ball inside to its
frontcourt men whenever Cal
played man-to-man. When the
Bears switched to a zone de
fense, Welch, Perry and Paul
Giovacchini would loft sweet
looking outside jumpers
through the hoop.
Shooting represented
another Cal problem, as the
Bears made just 22 of 61 floor
attempts for a sickly 36.1 per
cent.
"When the good shot is av
ailable to you, you have to be
able to 'stick' it," Bear coach
Dick Kuchen explained. "You
need to find the guy who has
the hot hand, and we couldn't

find that guy."
Finally, rebounds proved to
be scarce commodities for the
Bears. The hustling True's
game-high 12 rebounds ac
counted for nearly half Cal's to
tal. "They don't crash the
boards as hard as some of the
teams we've played against,"
Ward said.
In fact, the Bears could use a
couple of players like Ward.
Receiving his first collegiate
starting assignment, the 6-7
pogo stick grabbed a team
high nine rebounds.
"Orlando made some
freshman mistakes early," said
Dißiaso. "He was out of posi
tion in our zone, but he ad
justed and rebounded very
well."
Dißiaso added that Ward
would probably start this
weekend against Oregon State
and Oregon.
Taking mostly powerful
one-hancJed inside shots, Bel
ton led all scorers with 18
points. Backcourt men Perry

(13 points, eight rebounds, five
assists) and Giovacchini (10
points, seven assists) also had
