# Jezek makes big splash for Cardinals
## 
### RUTHANN RICHTER 
Not all Stanford athletes are
all wet. But Linda Jezek cer
tainly is. It is what has gotten
her today to the position of the
world's number one
backstroker.
Jezek, who is an 18-year-old
freshman at Stanford, was just
named Northern California
Athlete of the Year by the Citi
zens Savings Athletic Founda
tion for her efforts. Her aquatic
energies have taken her to the
'76 Olympics at Montreal and
the World Games in Columbia
and West Berlin, where she
won three gold medals. She
now claims the world record in
the 200-meter backstroke and
the American record in the
100-meter event.
Most swimmers of Jezek's
caliber become immersed, so
to speak, in swimming careers
at age six or seven. Jezek took
the plunge at age 12 in a life
saving class in Los Altos, where
she was raised.
She soon graduated to the
Santa Clara Swim Club, which
has gained a national reputa
tion for priming America's top
swimmers.
At Santa Clara, she swam
under Claudia Thomas, now
assistant coach for the Stanford
swim team. Thomas' encour
agement, backed by the lure of
a full scholarship, brought
Jezek to Stanford.
According to Thomas, "wo
men's college swimming is
coming into its own" these
days because of the scholar
ships now being made availa
ble nationwide. This was the
first year Stanford offered full
scholarships to swimmers.
For Jezek, the financial aid
compensates for the heavy

demands and time lost from
other activities.
She is up every weekday
morning at 6 a.m. for a two
hour practice that is repeated
in the afternoon. Her workouts
in the pool are complemented
by weight lifting three times a
week. This time of year,
weekends are taken up with
swim meets and more work
outs.
After hours come the in
dulgences. )ezek loves eating
and does a lot of it, sometimes
downing two hot fudge sun
daes or a half-gallon of ice
cream a day.

She's now dieting to get her
weight down nine pounds to
an ideal 147, for better
buoyancy. That means only
three hotdogs, two salads and
a container of yoghurt for
lunch. Ice cream is out, at least
for a few days.
One wonders where she
finds the time to go to school.
"I'd have to say now that
swimming comes first — be
fore academics — until 1980,"
when the Moscow Olympics
will take place, Jezek says.
Despite the priority, she still
managed to maintain a 3.0 av
erage last quarter, although
she was taking only 12 units

and says she "sloughed off."
In general, she says, "You
don't really have time to go out
and have fun and keep up with
your classes. I can't take advan
tage of anything offered at
Stanford."
But there are other rewards:
"I don't feel I'm missing any
thing. I get to travel all around
the world and have lots of
foreign friends," she says.
Jgst since September, she
has been offered AAU trips to
Australia, Rio de Janiero,
Taiwan, France and Holland
Having to turn them down be
cause of school seems to irk
her.
She complains that the Stan
ford team, which is unde
feated, doesn't have enough of
a challenge from other college
teams. "It's hard to improve
when there's no competition,"
she says. Last weekend's meet
at Arizona, one of the nation's
toughest groups, was an ex
ception.
So it appears that Jezek is just
biding her time at Stanford
until 1980 rolls around.
"I think I can go one more
year — up to 1980, Moscow.
After that swimming will be for
school and that's it," she says.
Even now, she is the oldest
member of the American team,
fast moving away from her
prime.
What will she do when she's
over the hill? She says she is
now thinking of capitalizing on
her reputation to become a
sports newscaster.
She adds that "I've never had
a chance to hold a job. There
are other things I'd like to do,
too." One thing is clear —
she'll have to find something
that burns up a lot of calories.

Even now, she is the oldest
member of the American team,
fast moving away from her
prime.
What will she do when she's
over the hill? She says she is
now thinking of capitalizing on
her reputation to become a
sports newscaster.
She adds that "I've never had
a chance to hold a job. There
are other things I'd like to do,
too." One thing is clear —
she'll have to find something
that burns up a lot of calories.

Not all Stanford athletes are
all wet. But Linda Jezek cer
tainly is. It is what has gotten
her today to the position of the
world's number one
backstroker.
Jezek, who is an 18-year-old
freshman at Stanford, was just
named Northern California
Athlete of the Year by the Citi
zens Savings Athletic Founda
tion for her efforts. Her aquatic
energies have taken her to the
'76 Olympics at Montreal and
the World Games in Columbia
and West Berlin, where she
won three gold medals. She
now claims the world record in
the 200-meter backstroke and
the American record in the
100-meter event.
Most swimmers of Jezek's
caliber become immersed, so
to speak, in swimming careers
at age six or seven. Jezek took
the plunge at age 12 in a life
saving class in Los Altos, where
she was raised.
She soon graduated to the
Santa Clara Swim Club, which
has gained a national reputa
tion for priming America's top
swimmers.
At Santa Clara, she swam
under Claudia Thomas, now
assistant coach for the Stanford
swim team. Thomas' encour
agement, backed by the lure of
a full scholarship, brought
Jezek to Stanford.
According to Thomas, "wo
men's college swimming is
coming into its own" these
days because of the scholar
ships now being made availa
ble nationwide. This was the
first year Stanford offered full
scholarships to swimmers.
For Jezek, the financial aid
compensates for the heavy

demands and time lost from
other activities.
She is up every weekday
morning at 6 a.m. for a two
hour practice that is repeated
in the afternoon. Her workouts
in the pool are complemented
by weight lifting three times a
week. This time of year,
weekends are taken up with
swim meets and more work
outs.
After hours come the in
dulgences. )ezek loves eating
and does a lot of it, sometimes
downing two hot fudge sun
daes or a half-gallon of ice
cream a day.

She's now dieting to get her
weight down nine pounds to
an ideal 147, for better
buoyancy. That means only
three hotdogs, two salads and
a container of yoghurt for
lunch. Ice cream is out, at least
for a few days.
One wonders where she
finds the time to go to school.
"I'd have to say now that
swimming comes first — be
fore academics — until 1980,"
when the Moscow Olympics
will take place, Jezek says.
Despite the priority, she still
managed to maintain a 3.0 av
erage last quarter, although
she was taking only 12 units

and says she "sloughed off."
In general, she says, "You
don't really have time to go out
and have fun and keep up with
your classes. I can't take advan
tage of anything offered at
Stanford."
But there are other rewards:
"I don't feel I'm missing any
thing. I get to travel all around
the world and have lots of
foreign friends," she says.
Jgst since September, she
has been offered AAU trips to
Australia, Rio de Janiero,
Taiwan, France and Holland
Having to turn them down be
cause of school seems to irk
her.
She complains that the Stan
ford team, which is unde
feated, doesn't have enough of
a challenge from other college
teams. "It's hard to improve
when there's no competition,"
she says. Last weekend's meet
at Arizona, one of the nation's
toughest groups, was an ex
ception.
So it appears that Jezek is just
biding her time at Stanford
until 1980 rolls around.
"I think I can go one more
year — up to 1980, Moscow.
After that swimming will be for
school and that's it," she says.
Even now, she is the oldest
member of the American team,
fast moving away from her
prime.
What will she do when she's
over the hill? She says she is
now thinking of capitalizing on
her reputation to become a
