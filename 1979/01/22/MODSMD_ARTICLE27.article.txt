# Gymnasts sparkle in home opener
## 
### DEAN EYRE 
From almost any point of view, Friday's
gymnastics home opener was a success —
a crowd of between 800 and 1000 showed
its support for the sport and saw high-level
performances. Sadao Hamada's men split
with strong California and UCLA teams
and Jackie Walker's women beat Cal Poly
Pomona.
Stanford's women recorded their first
win of the season, outscoring Pomona
111.10 to 105.35, paced by the top all
around showing of freshman Annie Smith.
Sweeping the vaulting, beam and floor
exercise events and tying with teammate
Karen Hall for first on bars, Smith tallied
32.55 points for the all-around title.
Other top individual scores for Stanford
included Cindy Stevenson's 7.3 in vault
ing, good for fourth place and Jeanette
Lacoste's third-place finish on bars with
6.55. junior Cindy Sedlund earned third
place on beam with a 6.75 score. Park took
second on beam and fourth in floor exer
cise, and Hall was off to a good start, with
the tie for first on bars and a second in
vaulting, until she injured her ankle while
warming up on balance beam.
In the men's competition, Cal took team
honors, outscoring Stanford 208.15 to
199.65. UCLA finished at 195.55. The Bears'
Warwick Forbes captured the all-around
title, accumulating 51.95 points by placing
sixth on pommel horse, third on high bar,
second on rings and winning the parallel
bars event.

Stanford's Tad Bostick was runner-up in
all-around, tallying an even 50.0 on per
formances that included seconds on floor
and high bar and sixth on parallel bars.
Cards Mike Lee and Bob Daniel finished
fifth and sixth respectively. Lee finished
fourth on horse and high bar, while Daniel
took fourth on bars. Other Card highlights
included co-captain Chris Takimoto's 9.35
to win on horse, Dan Margulies' fifth in
vaulting and Brian Nelson's second on
bars.
A few rusty spots showed in the gym
nast's routines, but since improvement is
the name of this game, the head-on com
petition and scrupulous judging can only
serve to aid the athletes' proficiency.
Men's co-captain Takimoto said, "I
think this meet did a good job of pointing
out our potential — it's just a matter of
having to work hard.''
"Things haven't jelled yet but we know
where we are," added sophomore Mar
gulies.
A feeling shared by many of the gym
nasts focused on the fact that this was,
after all, the beginning of the teams'
schedules and new tricks are added to in
crease the difficulty of routines.
Smith, who was "pleased about beam,"
was disappointed with her floor exercise
performance in which she fell once. "I felt
kind of silly because floor is a 'safe' event
— I think the problem was I just started
working on that trick (Arabian front some
rsault) and hadn't thrown it in competi

tion."
Dan Wessner, the men's other co
captain, was pleased with the team total of
199.65. "That'sabout 12 points higher than
our first meet last year," he said. "I figure
we can pick up three to tive points on
everything, so we'll be doing about 212 to
215 by the end of the season which is a
good 20 points better than last year."
"As I expected, there were some good
surprises and some bad ones, Hamada
observed. "On the first event (rings) we
didn't do too well because a lot of guys
were nervous.
"For this meet we did alright, but when I
think ahead I need more difficult moves
on the high bar. A lot of guys hit the moves
but they're lacking difficulty. No matter
how well they do they will still score lower
(than gymnasts with harder moves)/' he
added.
Both Stanford coaches were pleased
overall with the meet, their teams' poten
tial and depth. "It's evident we had more
depth than Cal Poly Pomona because they
got second and third in all-around, yet we
beat them as a team/' Walker noted.
Balance beam, even without Hall com
peting, was the second best event for the
women. Walker praised Julie Love as a
"great competitor" for tilling Hall's ab
sence at the last minute. Ot her debut on
beam Love said, "I enjoyed it very much —
it made working hard worthwhile and it's
an incentive to work harder."

Nelson goes through his routine on parallel bars. Scoring an in the event, he also competed on high
bar and did exhibition performances on rings and pommel horse.

serve to aid the athletes' proficiency.
Men's co-captain Takimoto said, "I
think this meet did a good job of pointing
out our potential — it's just a matter of
having to work hard.''
"Things haven't jelled yet but we know
where we are," added sophomore Mar
gulies.
A feeling shared by many of the gym
nasts focused on the fact that this was,
after all, the beginning of the teams'
schedules and new tricks are added to in
crease the difficulty of routines.
Smith, who was "pleased about beam,"
was disappointed with her floor exercise
performance in which she fell once. "I felt
kind of silly because floor is a 'safe' event
— I think the problem was I just started
working on that trick (Arabian front some
rsault) and hadn't thrown it in competi

tion."
Dan Wessner, the men's other co
captain, was pleased with the team total of
199.65. "That'sabout 12 points higher than
our first meet last year," he said. "I figure
we can pick up three to tive points on
everything, so we'll be doing about 212 to
215 by the end of the season which is a
good 20 points better than last year."
"As I expected, there were some good
surprises and some bad ones, Hamada
observed. "On the first event (rings) we
didn't do too well because a lot of guys
were nervous.
"For this meet we did alright, but when I
think ahead I need more difficult moves
on the high bar. A lot of guys hit the moves
but they're lacking difficulty. No matter
how well they do they will still score lower
(than gymnasts with harder moves)/' he
added.
Both Stanford coaches were pleased
overall with the meet, their teams' poten
tial and depth. "It's evident we had more
depth than Cal Poly Pomona because they
got second and third in all-around, yet we
beat them as a team/' Walker noted.
Balance beam, even without Hall com
peting, was the second best event for the
women. Walker praised Julie Love as a
"great competitor" for tilling Hall's ab
sence at the last minute. Ot her debut on
beam Love said, "I enjoyed it very much —
it made working hard worthwhile and it's
an incentive to work harder."


SHOWING THE form whii h earned him second place Friday night, freshman all-around performer Brian
Nelson goes through his routine on parallel bars. Scoring an in the event, he also competed on high
bar and did exhibition performances on rings and pommel horse.
From almost any point of view, Friday's
gymnastics home opener was a success —
a crowd of between 800 and 1000 showed
its support for the sport and saw high-level
performances. Sadao Hamada's men split
with strong California and UCLA teams
and Jackie Walker's women beat Cal Poly
Pomona.
Stanford's women recorded their first
win of the season, outscoring Pomona
111.10 to 105.35, paced by the top all
around showing of freshman Annie Smith.
Sweeping the vaulting, beam and floor
exercise events and tying with teammate
Karen Hall for first on bars, Smith tallied
32.55 points for the all-around title.
Other top individual scores for Stanford
included Cindy Stevenson's 7.3 in vault
ing, good for fourth place and Jeanette
Lacoste's third-place finish on bars with
6.55. junior Cindy Sedlund earned third
place on beam with a 6.75 score. Park took
second on beam and fourth in floor exer
cise, and Hall was off to a good start, with
the tie for first on bars and a second in
vaulting, until she injured her ankle while
warming up on balance beam.
In the men's competition, Cal took team
honors, outscoring Stanford 208.15 to
199.65. UCLA finished at 195.55. The Bears'
Warwick Forbes captured the all-around
title, accumulating 51.95 points by placing
sixth on pommel horse, third on high bar,
second on rings and winning the parallel
bars event.

Stanford's Tad Bostick was runner-up in
all-around, tallying an even 50.0 on per
formances that included seconds on floor
and high bar and sixth on parallel bars.
Cards Mike Lee and Bob Daniel finished
fifth and sixth respectively. Lee finished
fourth on horse and high bar, while Daniel
took fourth on bars. Other Card highlights
included co-captain Chris Takimoto's 9.35
to win on horse, Dan Margulies' fifth in
vaulting and Brian Nelson's second on
bars.
A few rusty spots showed in the gym
nast's routines, but since improvement is
the name of this game, the head-on com
petition and scrupulous judging can only
serve to aid the athletes' proficiency.
