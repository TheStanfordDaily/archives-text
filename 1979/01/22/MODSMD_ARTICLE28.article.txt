East Coast floods force evacuation
Authorities evacuated hundreds of families in Con
necticut, Massachusetts and New York City yesterday as
torrential rain and snow hammered the East Coast, caus
ing widespread flooding, snarling transportation and
contributing to hundreds of traffic accidents.
At least nine persons were reported killed in weather
related accidents across the country Saturday and yes
terday. A 53-year-old woman was drowned in her car
yesterday when a third of Stratford, Conn, was inun
dated under up to 10 feet of water. Police used boats to
evacuate residents who were taken to emergency shel
ters.
Police reported dozens of motorists stranded by
floodwaters throughout the region. Some motorists
were treated for exposure after being forced to swim to
safety through waist-high water.
In Hartford, many streets were underwater, with up to
3 feet reported in some areas.
Brown grant increases repudiated
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown's proposed 6 percent
cap on welfare grant increases was unanimously re
pudiated by the California Democratic Party's biennial
convention yesterday.
But the 40-year-old governor was spared further for
mal criticism from his own party because time came for
the kickoff of the Super Bowl football game.

The convention, without a dissenting vote, passed
resolutions calling for 15 percent grant increases for
welfare recipients, which Brown stiffly opposes, and
cost-of-living raises for state employees of more than
double the 6 percent figure he has cited as the most he
would consider.
Two other resolutions condemning Brown's en
dorsement of a constitutional amendment to balance
the federal budget failed.
Pope calls conference in Mexico
Puebla, Mexico — Pope John Paul II inaugurates a
conference of bishops here next Saturday that is ex
pected to have crucial meaning for the Roman Catholic
Church in Latin America. Some theologians say its re
percussions on Christianity could spread throughout
the world.
The 350 or so Latin American bishops will try to recon
cile the mission of evangelization with social needs.
They are seeking to maintain unity in the face of a grow
ing clamor from churchmen and laity for faster social
and political change.
This intra-church debate has been particularly strong
in Latin America. The experience gathered in tbe Con
ference of the Latin American Episcopate, meeting Jan.
27-Feb. 12, may especially influence the thinking of
Roman Catholic prelates in the Third World regions of
Asia and Africa.

Israelis fight against Palestinians
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli artillerymen and Palestinian
gunners dueled across the Lebanon border yesterday as
U.S. envoy Alfred Atherton pressed his Mideast peace
mediation efforts in Jerusalem. Israeli officials reported
some progress toward reviving the stalled Egyptian-
Israeli talks.
No Israeli casualties were reported in the fierce cross
border exchanges, but Lebanese provincial authorities
said one civilian was killed and five others wounded.
Lebanese said the towns of Nabatiyeh and Ayishiya
about 10 miles from the Israeli border, "came under
fierce rocketing and shelling from Israeli emplace
ments."
Palestinian rockets fell on the Israeli town of Kiryat
Shmona and nearby farm settlements in northern
Galilee, Israeli officials reported. Each side blamed the
other for starting the shelling.
Meanwhile, the leader of Israel's team of experts on
peace-treaty language said Atherton's suggestions for
solving treaty-language problems had met with some
success.
Israeli officials said Atherton, originally scheduled to
leave for Cairo today, may remain in Israel until tomor
row.
Cambodian troops duel Vietnamese
Bangkok, Thailand — Loyalist Cambodian troops have

regrouped and were battling Vietnamese forces yester
day around the city of Battambang, which the Viet
namese had declared "liberated' a week ago, Western
and Thai sources reported.
They also said a helicopter apparently manned by
loyalists was spotted trying to ferry in supplies to be
sieged troops in an ancient Buddhist temple atop a
2000-loot-high cliff in northern Cambodia.
Late last week, soldiers of Premier Pol Pot s fallen
government had been reported massing near Battam
bang, a western provincial capital and Cambodia's
second-largest city. The Vietnamese also beefed up their
forces in Battambang and brought in artillery pieces for
the showdown, the sources said.
The city, 155 miles northwest of the Cambodian capi
tal, Phnom Penh, was captured by the Vietnamese to
ward the end of their lightning invasion push through
Cambodia, which began in late December.
The estimated 100,000-man Vietnamese force,
bolstered by anti-Pol Pot Cambodian rebels, has spread
itself thin and is experiencing difficulties mopping up
areas of stiff resistance that were passed by in the initial
invasion, sources said.
Today's weather

through today becoming mostly fair tonight and tomor
row. Lows in the iOs to low 40s tonight. Highs in the 50s.
