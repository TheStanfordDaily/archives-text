# The 						College Bowl: not another football game
## 
### MARK NASSUTTI 
After the New Year's weekend with
its plethora of football games and all
the East-West and North-South
matchups, one would think the Col
lege Bowl was just another football
game.
It's not. Dubbed "the varsity sport
of the mind" by its backers, the Col
lege Bowl is "the intellectual equiva
lent of NCAA football," according to
senior Ted Cioia, a veteran of Stan
ford's championship team. Last year,
Stanford won the national champ
ionships and went on to represent
the United States in an international
match against an all-star team from
England.
Sponsored by Reader's Digest and
Smith-Corona, the College Bowl pits
students from schools across the
country against each other in a battle
of minds. Last year, there were over

50,000 matches leading to the na
tionally televised semi-finals and
final matches.
Open to all University students,
the University tournament for this
year's College Bowl will talk
place on Sunday. Participants must
register at Tresidder Memorial Union
this week.
Why does someone get involved in
this type of sport? Gioia said, "I had
seen the College Bowl on television
when I was younger. One day walk
ing through Tresidder I saw a notice
for the College Bowl and said 'Why
not?' "
Personal challenge
"I enjoy competition. I saw it as a
personal challenge and a way to
compete against other schools,
especially since I can't throw 80-yard
touchdown passes," Gioia said.

David Weinstein, Jon Reider, Peter Friedland and Ted Gioia (I. to r.) won the
College Bowl title for Stanford last year.
Does it take the memorization of
almanacs and encyclopedias to be
successful in the College Bowl ? Cioia
said it doesn't.
"You're basically putting your
lifelong education on the line. Study
ing for the bowl is very difficult.
People have tried, but for me it
doesn't work. I must admit I did try
before the (national) final match; I
was a bit nervous," he said.
Better balance
"Really bright people and some
super geniuses do this kind of thing.
We made it because we had better
balance than most teams. Berkeley,
who was tougher to beat than Vale
(Stanford met Berkeley at the reg
ional final and Yale at the national
final), had really only one guy, "Gioia
said.
The questions asked inthe College
Bowl are not trivia questions. They
are drawn from history and litera

ture, Cioia said.
The College Bowl was a popular
nation-wide television game show
that first appeared in 1956 after sev
eral years on radio. Last year's com
petition was an attempt to revive this
competition, a successful attempt,
according to Gioia. Over 100 colleges
and universities and over 5000 stu
dents participated.
Television show
When the College Bowl began as a
television show, it won accolades
from three presidents, several prime
ministers and the Queen of England.
The show lost its sponsor in 1%8
and with it its national exposure.
Gioia said he believes it has made a
comeback in this country.
In England, the only other country
presently involved in the College
Bowl, the contest has been popular
for almost 30 years.
Asked why there were no women
on the University's team, Gioia said

"there weren't that many women in
volved in the tournament. Even at the
nationals, only 15 percent of the par
ticipants were women. I think it's be
cause men have traditionally been
encouraged to compete more than
women," he said.
There will be an organizational
meeting for students interested in
participating in this year's College
Bowl this afternoon.

Why does someone get involved in
this type of sport? Gioia said, "I had
seen the College Bowl on television
when I was younger. One day walk
ing through Tresidder I saw a notice
for the College Bowl and said 'Why
not?' "
Personal challenge
"I enjoy competition. I saw it as a
personal challenge and a way to
compete against other schools,
especially since I can't throw 80-yard
touchdown passes," Gioia said.

David Weinstein, Jon Reider, Peter Friedland and Ted Gioia (I. to r.) won the
College Bowl title for Stanford last year.
Does it take the memorization of
almanacs and encyclopedias to be
successful in the College Bowl ? Cioia
said it doesn't.
"You're basically putting your
lifelong education on the line. Study
ing for the bowl is very difficult.
People have tried, but for me it
doesn't work. I must admit I did try
before the (national) final match; I
was a bit nervous," he said.
Better balance
"Really bright people and some
super geniuses do this kind of thing.
We made it because we had better
balance than most teams. Berkeley,
who was tougher to beat than Vale
(Stanford met Berkeley at the reg
ional final and Yale at the national
final), had really only one guy, "Gioia
said.
The questions asked inthe College
Bowl are not trivia questions. They
are drawn from history and litera

ture, Cioia said.
The College Bowl was a popular
nation-wide television game show
that first appeared in 1956 after sev
eral years on radio. Last year's com
petition was an attempt to revive this
competition, a successful attempt,
according to Gioia. Over 100 colleges
and universities and over 5000 stu
dents participated.
Television show
When the College Bowl began as a
television show, it won accolades
from three presidents, several prime
ministers and the Queen of England.
The show lost its sponsor in 1%8
and with it its national exposure.
Gioia said he believes it has made a
comeback in this country.
In England, the only other country
presently involved in the College
Bowl, the contest has been popular
for almost 30 years.
Asked why there were no women
on the University's team, Gioia said

"there weren't that many women in
volved in the tournament. Even at the
nationals, only 15 percent of the par
ticipants were women. I think it's be
cause men have traditionally been
encouraged to compete more than
women," he said.
There will be an organizational
meeting for students interested in
participating in this year's College
Bowl this afternoon.
