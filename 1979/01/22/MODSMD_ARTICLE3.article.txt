# The
						College Bowl: not another football game
## 
### MARK NASSUTTI 
After the New Year's weekend with
its plethora of football games and all
the East-West and North-South
matchups, one would think the Col
lege Bowl was just another football
game.
It's not. Dubbed "the varsity sport
of the mind" by its backers, the Col
lege Bowl is "the intellectual equiva
lent of NCAA football," according to
senior Ted Cioia, a veteran of Stan
ford's championship team. Last year,
Stanford won the national champ
ionships and went on to represent
the United States in an international
match against an all-star team from
England.
Sponsored by Reader's Digest and
Smith-Corona, the College Bowl pits
students from schools across the
country against each other in a battle
of minds. Last year, there were over

50,000 matches leading to the na
tionally televised semi-finals and
final matches.
Open to all University students,
the University tournament for this
year's College Bowl will talk
place on Sunday. Participants must
register at Tresidder Memorial Union
this week.
Why does someone get involved in
this type of sport? Gioia said, "I had
seen the College Bowl on television
when I was younger. One day walk
ing through Tresidder I saw a notice
for the College Bowl and said 'Why
not?' "
Personal challenge
"I enjoy competition. I saw it as a
personal challenge and a way to
compete against other schools,
especially since I can't throw 80-yard
touchdown passes," Gioia said.
