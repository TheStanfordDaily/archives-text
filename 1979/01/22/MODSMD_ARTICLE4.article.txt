# Father of Pill discusses contraception problems
## 
### ALEEN ZIMBEROFF 
There is plenty wrong with birth control,
and very little to be done about it, accord
ing to Carl Djerassi, professor of chemistry
here and inventor of the birth control pill.
Djerassi addressed a crowd of well over
200 on "What's Wrong With Birth Control
and What Can Be Done About It" last
Thursday evening in the first of a four part
lecture series sponsored by the Tresidder
Program Board on Vital Issues About Your
Body.
While stressing that he would deal only
with presently existing methods, Djerassi
reviewed the various types of birth control
and examined percentages of global us
age. Although "coitus interruptus" (with
drawal before ejaculation) is a "major
method in a number of countries," he
said, oral contraceptives are taken by 30 to
40 million women.
Djerassi also said that he is "quite con
vinced that the condom is a method that
should be used more frequently, espe
cially by teenagers," citing that "men
should learn younger that they share in the
burden of contraception."
"I'd like to see condoms everywhere,
especially in high school gyms," he
suggested. "It is the simplest and safest
barrier around."
Abortion
Djerassi discussed abortion in a
worldwide context, saying, "abortion has
had a bigger impact on population figures

than anything else.
"Abortion is used for very different pur
poses in different societies," he said. "It is
totally inhumane to try and make it illegal.
To try to legislate it out is ridiculous. We
should try and make it easier."
Djerassi also discussed the choice bet
ween using a diaphragm and taking the
Pill. "If a woman and her partner can cope
effectively with a diaphragm, they should
use it,"he said. "The Pill is an extraordi
narily imperfect method," he added.
Diaphragm
He explained that use of a diaphragm
was not feasible throughout the world for
a number of reasons. In the Moslem coun
tries, "a physician is not even able to see
the genitalia; the men are not concerned;
there is no choice," he said.
Millions of women in the world have no
private place toeven keep a diaphragm, let
alone to insert it.
He proposed that the number of diap
hragm users in the audience was consid
erably larger than an average group, stres
sing that women here have the knowledge
and facilities to make that choice.
Pill more common
He said women between the ages of 19
and 35 with what he called "an active sex
life" more commonly use oral contracep
tives.
When questioned on the possibility of a
"male Pill," he answered, "Every woman
in this audience will pass through

menopause before there will be a male
anti-fertility pill." He cited research dif
ficulties and regulatory restrictions as two
major setbacks in birth control progress.
With current testing regulations, "if you
moved everything back 20 years, there
would be no way to introduce the Pill on
the market now. You couldn't sell aspirin
either," for the same reasons, he said.
Testing
Djerassi cited the fact that current regu
lations require 10 years of testing on dogs
and five additional years testing on mon
keys. He added that reproduction is a
"species-specific" process and testing
birth-control drugs on dogs and monkeys
is not the same thing as testing them on
humans.
He added, however, that to blame the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
the problem is "pure nonsense. They are a
mirror of public opinion.
"The emphasis today is on safety," he
said.
In a press conference after his talk, a
woman asked him quietly if there was any
thing "we" would do about improving
birth control methods. He replied softly,
"Yes. It takes a more intelligent citizen.
That is why I spoke here tonight."
Djerassi is a native of Vienna, Austria
and has been teaching at Stanford since
1959. He is the author of over 900 books
and articles and has been the recipient of
numerous awards.
