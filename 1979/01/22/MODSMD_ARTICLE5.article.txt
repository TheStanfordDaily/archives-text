# Moslem leader to return from exile
## Iran premier vows not to quit 
### 
Tehran, Iran (AP) — Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar vowed yesterday
he would not be driven from office
by the return of Ayatullah Khomeini
from exile. He huddled with top sec
urity aides to plan for the arrival of
the charismatic Moslem leader.
"All the nonsense and rumors that
the newspapers are writing about my
resignation is untrue," the embattled
prime minister told the Iranian
people in a broadcast address. "I am
going to remain in the stronghold of
the constitution."
From his headquarters-in-exile in
France, Khomeini charged that Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who ap
pointed Bakhtiar before being forced
out of Iran by a popular uprising or
chestrated by Khomeini, was plan
ning a military coup to return to
power.
The shah, secluded on a Nile River
island since he left Iran, will leave
Egypt today, Egyptian officials said.
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was
expected to head for the United
States, with a possible stopover in
the Moroccan capital, Rabat. The
time of his departure and U.S. desti
nation were not mentioned in the
announcement yesterday.
In Texas
Most of the shah's family is cur
rently in Lubbock, Texas, where his
eldest son, Crown Prince Reza, is
training to be a military pilot. It is
believed the shah may go to the Palm
Springs, Ca., estate of Walter An
nenberg, a former U.S. ambassador
to Britain.
His trip abroad is described offi
cially as an indefinite "vacation," but
few in Iran doubt it will end in per
manent exile.
Rejoins shah
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat,
who had made a one-day trip to
neighboring Sudan, rejoined the
shah yesterday in this southern Egyp
tian resort.
The 78-year-old Khomeini wants to
abolish the monarchy and set up an
Islamic republic to replace Bakhtiar's
government, which he denounces as
a tool of the shah and of foreign in
terests.
Meanwhile, factional strife in the
country continued. Pro-Khomeini
demonstrators marched in Tehran,
pro-shah gangs reportedly harassed
motorists in the capital, and a Marxist
guerrilla group warned Khomeini
against "suffocating freedoms" if he

takes command of the nation.
A government source said Bakhtiar
called in the members ol his National
Security Council — the interior
minister, armed forces chiefs and the
head of the paramilitary state police
— to discuss plans tor Khomeini's
scheduled arrival in Iran Friday.
The Moslem elder, in exile for 14
years, is expected to be welcomed by
hundreds of thousands of jubilant
Iranians as the man who will abolish
the monarchy.
Khomeini is to arrive aboard a
chartered Iran Air jetliner piloted by
volunteers from the strike-bound
Iranian airline. His first stop will be a
Tehran cemetery where many "mar
tyrs" from the violence of the past
year are buried.
Requests calm
In his address, Bakhtiar called for
national "calm and order" and said
recent strikes, many of them di
rected at his government, have cost
the country more than the official
corruption of the past.
In an apparent reference to com
munists, he said some troublemak
ers in the country are "directed from
abroad."
The 430.000-man Iranian military
appears to hold the key to Iran's fu
ture. Khomeini must reach an ac
commodation with the army, which
retains considerable loyalty to the
shah, to succeed.
About 3000 demonstrators, appa
rently representing a communist fac

tion, marched through the streets of
Tehran yesterday morning shouting
both pro-Khomeini slogans and
"Workers and peasants, pull out the
roots of exploitation!"
Traffic stopped
Witnesses told reporters that
about 150 men armed with staffs
stopped traffic in south Tehran
Saturday night and demanded that
motorists shout pro-shah slogans.
The group, one of the several bands
of active shah supporters recently
reported in the city, melted away
when anti-shah militants arrived, the
witnesses said.
The Iranian People's Warriors
Guerrilla Organization, a Marxist
group, published an open letter to
Khomeini, warning him of trouble if
"you are trying to use Islam to censor
any tree thinking, suppress ideas, re
vive brainwashing, declare there is
only to be one party and suffocate
other freedoms."
Splits appear to be growing in the
broad-based opposition movement
as final political victory appears to be
nearing. There have been repeated
reports in recent weeks of clashes
between Marxist and Moslem ac
tivists, and Tehran Radio said there
was some fighting between rival
groups in the capital yesterday.
Far-left groups have warned de
vout Moslems not to attack non-
Moslem groups that are "fighting for
freedom and democracy."

the monarchy.
Khomeini is to arrive aboard a
chartered Iran Air jetliner piloted by
volunteers from the strike-bound
Iranian airline. His first stop will be a
Tehran cemetery where many "mar
tyrs" from the violence of the past
year are buried.
Requests calm
In his address, Bakhtiar called for
national "calm and order" and said
recent strikes, many of them di
rected at his government, have cost
the country more than the official
corruption of the past.
In an apparent reference to com
munists, he said some troublemak
ers in the country are "directed from
abroad."
The 430.000-man Iranian military
appears to hold the key to Iran's fu
ture. Khomeini must reach an ac
commodation with the army, which
retains considerable loyalty to the
shah, to succeed.
About 3000 demonstrators, appa
rently representing a communist fac

tion, marched through the streets of
Tehran yesterday morning shouting
both pro-Khomeini slogans and
"Workers and peasants, pull out the
roots of exploitation!"
Traffic stopped
Witnesses told reporters that
about 150 men armed with staffs
stopped traffic in south Tehran
Saturday night and demanded that
motorists shout pro-shah slogans.
The group, one of the several bands
of active shah supporters recently
reported in the city, melted away
when anti-shah militants arrived, the
witnesses said.
The Iranian People's Warriors
Guerrilla Organization, a Marxist
group, published an open letter to
Khomeini, warning him of trouble if
"you are trying to use Islam to censor
any tree thinking, suppress ideas, re
vive brainwashing, declare there is
only to be one party and suffocate
other freedoms."
Splits appear to be growing in the
broad-based opposition movement
as final political victory appears to be
nearing. There have been repeated
reports in recent weeks of clashes
between Marxist and Moslem ac
tivists, and Tehran Radio said there
was some fighting between rival
groups in the capital yesterday.
Far-left groups have warned de
vout Moslems not to attack non-
Moslem groups that are "fighting for
freedom and democracy."
Tehran, Iran (AP) — Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar vowed yesterday
he would not be driven from office
by the return of Ayatullah Khomeini
from exile. He huddled with top sec
urity aides to plan for the arrival of
the charismatic Moslem leader.
"All the nonsense and rumors that
the newspapers are writing about my
resignation is untrue," the embattled
prime minister told the Iranian
people in a broadcast address. "I am
going to remain in the stronghold of
the constitution."
From his headquarters-in-exile in
France, Khomeini charged that Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who ap
pointed Bakhtiar before being forced
out of Iran by a popular uprising or
chestrated by Khomeini, was plan
ning a military coup to return to
power.
The shah, secluded on a Nile River
island since he left Iran, will leave
Egypt today, Egyptian officials said.
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was
expected to head for the United
States, with a possible stopover in
the Moroccan capital, Rabat. The
time of his departure and U.S. desti
nation were not mentioned in the
announcement yesterday.
In Texas
Most of the shah's family is cur
rently in Lubbock, Texas, where his
eldest son, Crown Prince Reza, is
training to be a military pilot. It is
believed the shah may go to the Palm
Springs, Ca., estate of Walter An
nenberg, a former U.S. ambassador
to Britain.
His trip abroad is described offi
cially as an indefinite "vacation," but
few in Iran doubt it will end in per
manent exile.
Rejoins shah
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat,
who had made a one-day trip to
neighboring Sudan, rejoined the
shah yesterday in this southern Egyp
tian resort.
The 78-year-old Khomeini wants to
abolish the monarchy and set up an
Islamic republic to replace Bakhtiar's
government, which he denounces as
a tool of the shah and of foreign in
terests.
Meanwhile, factional strife in the
country continued. Pro-Khomeini
demonstrators marched in Tehran,
pro-shah gangs reportedly harassed
motorists in the capital, and a Marxist
guerrilla group warned Khomeini
against "suffocating freedoms" if he

takes command of the nation.
A government source said Bakhtiar
called in the members ol his National
Security Council — the interior
minister, armed forces chiefs and the
head of the paramilitary state police
— to discuss plans tor Khomeini's
scheduled arrival in Iran Friday.
The Moslem elder, in exile for 14
years, is expected to be welcomed by
hundreds of thousands of jubilant
Iranians as the man who will abolish
the monarchy.
