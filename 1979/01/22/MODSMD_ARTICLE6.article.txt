# Med School to require blanket fee, no thesis
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Medical students here should not
have to write mandatory theses be
fore receiving their M.D. degrees
and should pay the same tuition
whether they stay for four, five or six
years, the Medical School Faculty
Senate decided Friday.
After several months of debate,
the Faculty Senate unanimously
voted to recommend that more op
portunities be given for independent
student research, but that these pre
ceptorships and follow-up oral and
written presentations not be made
mandatory.
The final proposal unanimously
passed by the senate will still go back
to committee. It requires that the
curriculum panel "study the feasibil
ity" of increased research oppor
tunities and report back to the se
nate.
"The students feel that there's not
a general availability of research op
portunities now," Alan Garber, pres
ident of the Stanford Medical Stu
dents Association, told the senate.
Dr. Robert Chase, professor ot
surgery and head of the curriculum
policy committee which suggested
the thesis requirement, had argued
that the mandate would force faculty
members to provide the research
opportunities.
Burden
But students retorted that the bur
den would be on them, not on the
faculty members. They were also
concerned that the requirement
would attract a less diverse student
body to the Med School.
Chase said after the vote Friday
that he was "heartened" by these

nate's action.
"If the report stimulated the se
nate to do a feasibility study on the
academic benefits of a preceptor
ship, then the report, as well as the
committee, has done its job," he
said.
Spirit arid action
"People have gotten the spiritual
policy of the committee report con
fused with action," he added. "The
report was a base from which to start
discussions. It was not a policy re
commendation to be immediately
implemented. It would have gone
back to the curriculum committee
for detailed analysis."
The senate also passed unani
mously the committee's proposal
that a global tuition fee be charged
for all students working toward the
M.D. degree whether they stay for
four, five or six years.
Chase had said earlier that this re
commendation was in response to
faculty complaints that an "increas
ing number of students wanted to
rush and push and get through med
school in four years."
Incentive
This recommendation would also
be an added incentive for students to
do preceptorships because the
four-year curriculum does not allow
time for individual research, he said.
Although 35 to 40 percent of the
medical students stay the full five
years, "one of the highest percen
tages in the country," that figure
"used to be 100 percent," CFiase
explained.
Implementation of the global tui
tion will be left to Med School ad
ministration. The Board of Trustees
has already approved the plan.
