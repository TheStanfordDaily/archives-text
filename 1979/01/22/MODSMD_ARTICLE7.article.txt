## Europe's colleges declining 
### 
FHaving been connected with
European universities for half a
century, I was recently invited
to lectyre on international af
fairs in French and Swiss uni
versities. In addition I visited
Italy, attended a conference at
the University of Canterbury
and paid a brief visit to the Uni
versity of London.
Universities are no longer
the gems in the crown of
Europe. French universities are
relatively quiet slums, ready to
explode again. Amiens is
dominated by its glorious
cathedral.
The drab modern university
buildings bear tawdry tes
timony to their occupation by
protesters, who covered the
walls with puerile paintings. In
such a city it is impossible to
believe in the inevitability of
progress.
The University of Genoa is
housed in splendid renais
sance palaces, but the students
have reduced them to danger
ous slums; the president's of
fice is a fortress prepared for a
siege. The University of Padua,
■of historic renown, is a hideout
ior terrorists. The University of
London displays a shabbiness
which reflects partly budgetary
Stringencies and partly the un
awareness, so common in our
universities, that once impres
sive surroundings have be
come threadbare.
- Only in Switzerland was
"there an evident concern for
the dignity of academic sur
roundings, and there more
than anywhere else in Europe
do people live by a civilized ex
change of opinions.
Rational discourse has re
turned to European univer
sities, but no one trusts them
very much, and there are

groups which would like to
make them arenas of vio
lent confrontation.
Italian universities are in the
greatest danger, thanks
primarily to the Red Brigades.
In France, Sartre and the cult of
violence are passe; the "new
philosophers" like Bernard
Levy have slashed the ideolog
ical sails of Marxism, and the
Soviet Union no longer serves
as a model; but many students
unwittingly repeat Soviet
anti-American propaganda.
Swiss universities are stable,
but University of Geneva
Sociology Prof. Jean Ziegler's
attack on the Swiss way of life
indicates, at least in French
Switzerland, a willingness to
rock the boat just to watch the
passengers become seasick, or
rather lakesick.
The anti-Marxism fashiona
ble in France has scarcely hit
England, but even leftist scho
lars scorn the "lazy Marxists"
who are unwilling to follow
Marx's example and spend
long tedious hours in the lib
rary. The conference at the
University of Canterbury, de
voted to the European
Economic Community and at
tended primarily by civic lead
ers, was conducted on a high
level.
The Institut National de Sci
ence Politique in Paris is Fr
ance's leading center for the
study of international affairs,
but even there one notes an
ignorance of the United States
similar to American ignorance
of France.
Europe is a linguistic bed
lam. Yet students in someareas
are not getting down to the
serious business of learning
major foreign languages. Pres
sured by political activists and

linguists (whose language
abilities are usually limited),
these students are cultivating
local dialects primarily as an
expression of anti
establishmentarianism.
Theoneinstitution in Europe
where I found an adequate
command of foreign languages
was the Ostinstitut in Bern,
but, like Hoover Institution
here, it owes its linguistic
competency to refugees. Its
realistic approach has given it a
reactionary reputation among
leftists, but in fact the staff con
sists largely of old-fashioned
liberals. The director, Dr. Peter
Sager, is one of America's best
friends in Europe.
We have friends in Europe,
but few admirers. In particular,
San Francisco, once regarded
as the Paris of the New World,
has replaced Chicago as the
symbol of everything that is
wrong with American civiliza
tion. In Geneva I was inter
viewed at length by the Tribune
de Geneve. I covered the
world scene, but all that came
out were comments on the
People's Temple.
All this is part of a broader
phenomenon. No country
seems to admire any other
country any more.

FHaving been connected with
European universities for half a
century, I was recently invited
to lectyre on international af
fairs in French and Swiss uni
versities. In addition I visited
Italy, attended a conference at
the University of Canterbury
and paid a brief visit to the Uni
versity of London.
Universities are no longer
the gems in the crown of
Europe. French universities are
relatively quiet slums, ready to
explode again. Amiens is
dominated by its glorious
cathedral.
The drab modern university
buildings bear tawdry tes
timony to their occupation by
protesters, who covered the
walls with puerile paintings. In
such a city it is impossible to
believe in the inevitability of
progress.
The University of Genoa is
housed in splendid renais
sance palaces, but the students
have reduced them to danger
ous slums; the president's of
fice is a fortress prepared for a
siege. The University of Padua,
■of historic renown, is a hideout
ior terrorists. The University of
London displays a shabbiness
which reflects partly budgetary
Stringencies and partly the un
awareness, so common in our
universities, that once impres
sive surroundings have be
come threadbare.
- Only in Switzerland was
"there an evident concern for
the dignity of academic sur
roundings, and there more
than anywhere else in Europe
do people live by a civilized ex
change of opinions.
Rational discourse has re
turned to European univer
sities, but no one trusts them
very much, and there are

groups which would like to
make them arenas of vio
lent confrontation.
Italian universities are in the
greatest danger, thanks
primarily to the Red Brigades.
In France, Sartre and the cult of
violence are passe; the "new
philosophers" like Bernard
Levy have slashed the ideolog
ical sails of Marxism, and the
Soviet Union no longer serves
as a model; but many students
unwittingly repeat Soviet
anti-American propaganda.
Swiss universities are stable,
but University of Geneva
Sociology Prof. Jean Ziegler's
attack on the Swiss way of life
indicates, at least in French
Switzerland, a willingness to
rock the boat just to watch the
passengers become seasick, or
rather lakesick.
