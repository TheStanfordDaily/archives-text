## Winter warning 
### 
From the minute you arrive
on campus in the fall of your
freshman year, you begin to
hear ominous reports about
winter quarter. As I packed up
my suitcase to come back last
january, I was filled with a
sense of impending doom. I
anticipated three months of
studying, boredom and rain.
Well, it wasn't quite that bad.
But to make things easier on
this year's crop of new recruits,
I'd like to provide a few sugges
tions on survival, a kind of
first-timer's guide to winter
quarter.
The first thing you likely
noticed as you put your suit
case down in the small pond
outside your dorm, is that it
rains in California. And it rains
a lot. Get used to it, you'll
probably be plagued by that
pounding precipitation at least
through February.
The rain does stop every now
and then — usually just long
enough for you to walk two
thirds of the way to the Post
Office.
But this is actually nature's
way of easing depression. If
you really checked your P.O.
box every day during winter
quarter, you'd start to notice
how much less mail you get as
the year goes on. Not only
does the quantity drop, but
you discover you're getting
more letters from your great
aunt than from your high
school "friends."
For some people, particu
larly Southern Californians,
the worst part about the rain is
that you lose that heaithy glow,
the carefully cultivated tan. As
the quarter wears on, even the
Palm Beach die-hards fade to
the grayish pallor of their
northern peers. This is no tri
vial matter — a tan can be as
much a part of your identity as
a 280Z or Calvin Klein jeans.
The next problem with
winter quarter is that, for the
first time, you're coming back

to Stanford. The newness is
wearing off, and you begin to
be the least bit critical of your
environment. Your stomach
turns at the thought of daily
encounters with Math 42, your
roommate(s) and Food Service
concoctions.
With the arrival of your fall
quarter grades, it's time to
reassess your scholastic goals.
Depending on the results of
your first haphazard leap into
academia, your new approach
can range from avoiding the
Meyer social scene to inves
tigating alternatives to med
school.
Winter is a good time to get
used to being independent. Or
alone. About this time your RA
drifts out of the picture in time
to salvage his own life. And
about this time your room
mate, your best friend from
home and the person you've
had the hots for all autumn, fall
in love. And they do so with
some total unknown who
manages to monopolize all of
their time. Even the most
philosophical individuals have
trouble turning total desertion
into an experiment in self
reliance.
The lighter side of this time
of year is the main recreational
activity, the weekend ski trip.
Even if you've never seen snow
before, you risk social polariza
tion if you don't make the ef
fort to be enthusiastic about
Tahoe. Squaw Valley and Al
pine Meadows are as much of
an institution in California as
lerry Brown and Ocean Pacific
shorts.
Despite all this, winter quar
ter seems to go by pretty
quickly. Find a comfortable rut
and settle down for a couple of
months. After all, you know
what they say about spring
quarter. . . .

in love. And they do so with
some total unknown who
manages to monopolize all of
their time. Even the most
philosophical individuals have
trouble turning total desertion
into an experiment in self
reliance.
The lighter side of this time
of year is the main recreational
activity, the weekend ski trip.
Even if you've never seen snow
before, you risk social polariza
tion if you don't make the ef
fort to be enthusiastic about
Tahoe. Squaw Valley and Al
pine Meadows are as much of
an institution in California as
lerry Brown and Ocean Pacific
shorts.
Despite all this, winter quar
ter seems to go by pretty
quickly. Find a comfortable rut
and settle down for a couple of
months. After all, you know
what they say about spring
quarter. . . .
