# Pro-choice rally defends women's abortion rights
## 
### ROBIN MILLINGTON 
"Human rights must include
women's rights, and women's
rights must include fertility
rights," said Steven Hygh, Santa
Clara County Commission infor
mation coordinator for Planned
Parenthood, in a Pro-choice rally
in White Plaza yesterday.
The Pro-choice Alliance is a col
lective of the campus Feminist
Union "concerned with educat
ing the Stanford community on
abortions and restrictions on
women's choice," said Cinny
Puddefoot, a spokesperson for
the alliance.
Speaking to a crowd of about a
hundred people, including many
men, Hygh said that he, as a male,
was concerned with human rights
in any form. "The freedom and
liberty of mankind are inextricably
bound to the freedom and liberty
of womankind.
"No woman can call herself free
until she can control her own fer
tility," Hygh said, quoting Mar
garet Sanger, founder of Planned
Parenthood.
Hygh criticized the Right-to-Life
group and similar organizations.
He said such groups are "relent
less, omnipresent and fanatical."
According to Hygh, only 20 per
cent of practicing Catholics actu
ally support the Right-to-Life or
ganization.
He also said that opposition
groups are motivated by what he
called a fear of sex and the belief
there should be "no pleasure
without punishment."
Suzanne Case, a member of the
Stanford Committee on Repro
ductive Rights, expressed similar
concerns, including 1977 Con
gressional legislation which pre

vented federal funding for abor
tions. She said this action re
stricted poor women from the
"right to choose."
"We quit fighting, we thought
we had it in the bag," Case said.
"Now we're caught in the conser
vative backlash sweeping this
country."
Case said that "we cannot allow
any one of our hard won rights to
be taken away."
Case emphasized that the
movement was not necessarily
pro-abortion but pro-choice.
Case and Hygh both expressed
concern over the possible effects
of eliminating legal abortion.
Hygh said that groups attempt
ing to stop legal abortions will not
succeed in preventing unsafe
abortion practices but rather will
eliminate the safe abortions.
The rally was held to com
memorate the sixth anniversary of
the Jan. 22, 1973 Supreme Court
decision which made abortion
legal, according to Dawn Up
church, one of the three rally or
ganizers. Upchurch said that simi
lar rallies were taking place
throughout the Bay Area.
The Pro-choice Alliance spon
sored the rally in connection with
the Feminist Union, the Women's
Center and Leah Kaplan, assistant
dean of students, Puddefoot said.
The group will also be sponsor
ing a letter writing campaign to
further the cause of pro-choice.
Upchurch emphasized that the
Pro-choice group is supporting
"not just abortion but reproduc
tive rights — the whole thing."
Hygh urged people to "look in
side yourselves to see if you have
the courage to put into action
your rights."
