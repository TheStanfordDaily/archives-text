## Soviets display hostile intent 
### 
Alex Alben, in "Four Ques
tions About Soviet Power,"
(Daily, Jan. 18) has mindlessly
reiterated old, false arguments
about the strength and inten
tions of the Soviet Union. To
support his thesis that the
Soviet Union poses no threat
to the United States, Alben
makes extraordinary
generalizations without the
slightest support of evidence.
Herewithin, a few corrections
to the record.
Alben opens his column with
a ritual invocation of "Joe
McCarthy," whose ghost,
Alben believes, today controls
all the principal anti-Soviet
spokesmen in America. This
cheap smear is similar to the
ones McCarthy used and about
as logical. The implicit equa
tion is: McCarthy was despica
ble; McCarthy opposed com
munism; ergo, anyone who
opposes communism is de
spicable. Let's get this clear:
McCarthy was a rogue, not for
opposing communism, but for
destroying civil liberties in his
efforts to eliminate American
communists. I am not McCar
thyite for proclaiming publicly
that communism threatens
America; I am McCarthyite
only if I deny Alben his right to
proclaim the contrary.
"I suggest that the Soviets
have reached military parity —
or rough parity — with the Un
ited States and thatthey arewil
ling to sit tight at this
juncture," declares Alben.
Currently the Soviet Union
disposes of 168 combat divi
sions; the United States, 19.
America's 1280 tanks face
26,000 Russian ones. 231 Soviet
attack submarines are de
ployed against 75 American.
That is very, very "rough" par
ity indeed. For the past eleven
years, America has constructed
no new missle launchers,
being content with 1054 while
Russia has built its stock to
1600; America renounced the
ABM, while Russia is feverishly
trying to build one; the Soviet
Union has increased its
number of tanks by 40 percent;
Soviet military spending is 30
percent higher than America's,

although costs are lower and
the Russian CNP is much
lower. That is a very strange
way to "sit tight." (My figures
come from the Institute of
Strategic Studies in London.
Alben gives no figures).
Alben then tries to argue that
the Soviet Union is not an ally
of communism. "They are al
lies of those they can control."
"...they have demonstrated an
ability to support regimes of
opposite ideology..." Alben
has neatly avoided the central
issue. The Soviet leaders are
committed to an ideological
system that takes as its funda
mental statement, "capitalism
must be destroyed." Soviet
foreign policy actions are di
rected toward that ultimate
goal. At times, that goal may be
served by alliances with non
communist nations, as during
the Second World War. But the
Soviet objective has never
changed: to destroy the way of
life known to the West. Get
back to your basic reading, Al
ben. Read the Communist
Manifesto. Read Lenin on
world revolution. Read some
articles in Pravda. In short, do
your homework.
Not only is Russia not an ally
of communism, maintains Al
ben; verily, it is becoming an
ally of the West. Alben cites
Russia's dependence on West
ern technology sales, grain,
other economic support. The
fallacy is attractive: economic
dependence, one would think,
ought to lead to political al
liance. But it doesn't work that
way: Britain and Germany
were each other's largest trad
ing partners in 1914. Russia and
Germany did a brisk trade right
up to the German invasion of
)une, 1941. The Germans pro
fited from trade with the nation
they were plotting to destroy.
Today Russia is doing the
same.
Alben progresses from his
conclusion that Russia is de
pendent on the West to say,
"(A relaxation of international
tensions) will afford them (the
Soviets) a better opportunity to
pursuetheir interests." Indeed
it will. I commend to Alben's

attention, and to the attention
of the Republic, a speech made
by Leonid Brezhnev in 1973, in
which Brezhnev proclaimed
quite openly that detente is
simply a ruse designed to
change the balance of power
decisively in Russia's favor.
"We have been able to ac
complish more in a short time
with detente than was done for
years pursuing the confronta
tion policy...By 1985, as a con
sequence of detente, we will
have achieved most of our ob
jectives in Western
Europe. ..And a decisive shift in
the correlation of forces such
that, come 1985, we will be able
to extend our will wherever we
need to." (Boston Clobe, Feb.
11,1977). Brezhnev went on to
lis,t four countries that were to
be Communized or Finlan
dized by 1985: Norway, De
nmark, France, Italy.
Alben may believe that
Soviet goals are benign, but I
prefer to take Comrade
Brezhnev at his word. Simi
larly, Alben says,"I cannot
agree that heightened con
frontation will ameliorate con
ditions inside the Soviet Un
ion." Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,
speaking to the AFL-CIO in
1975, said, "We beg you to
come and interfere." I trust

Solzhenitsyn's judgment.
Alben concludes, "If we act
aggressively, the Soviets will
respond in kind. Therefore,
such (a "Devil Image" of the
Soviets) is real only if we make
it real by failing to embrace the
path of co-operation and
peace." People have been say
ing that ever since 1933. Pre
sumably Finnish aggressive
ness prompted the Russian in
vasion of 1939; Poland's ag
gressiveness that caused Rus
sia to invade it in the same year.
South Korean aggression pro
voked the Korean War, didn't
it? What American aggression
prompted Russia to build the
Berlin Wall! 1 And is the present
Soviet colonialism-by-proxy in
Africa also a response to
American aggression?
However hard we try to con
vince ourselves that the Rus
sians are our friends, they will
remain our enemies, deter
mined to destroy American
liberty. Alben lampoons the
idea that Russian troops might
land on Long Island; is it really
necessary to wait for that to
happen before we conclude
that the threat is real? Let's start
winning the struggle before it's
too late.

sequence of detente, we will
have achieved most of our ob
jectives in Western
Europe. ..And a decisive shift in
the correlation of forces such
that, come 1985, we will be able
to extend our will wherever we
need to." (Boston Clobe, Feb.
11,1977). Brezhnev went on to
lis,t four countries that were to
be Communized or Finlan
dized by 1985: Norway, De
nmark, France, Italy.
Alben may believe that
Soviet goals are benign, but I
prefer to take Comrade
Brezhnev at his word. Simi
larly, Alben says,"I cannot
agree that heightened con
frontation will ameliorate con
ditions inside the Soviet Un
ion." Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,
speaking to the AFL-CIO in
1975, said, "We beg you to
come and interfere." I trust

Solzhenitsyn's judgment.
Alben concludes, "If we act
aggressively, the Soviets will
respond in kind. Therefore,
such (a "Devil Image" of the
Soviets) is real only if we make
it real by failing to embrace the
path of co-operation and
peace." People have been say
ing that ever since 1933. Pre
sumably Finnish aggressive
ness prompted the Russian in
vasion of 1939; Poland's ag
gressiveness that caused Rus
sia to invade it in the same year.
South Korean aggression pro
voked the Korean War, didn't
it? What American aggression
prompted Russia to build the
Berlin Wall! 1 And is the present
Soviet colonialism-by-proxy in
Africa also a response to
American aggression?
However hard we try to con
vince ourselves that the Rus
sians are our friends, they will
remain our enemies, deter
mined to destroy American
liberty. Alben lampoons the
idea that Russian troops might
land on Long Island; is it really
necessary to wait for that to
happen before we conclude
that the threat is real? Let's start
winning the struggle before it's
too late.

Alex Alben, in "Four Ques
tions About Soviet Power,"
(Daily, Jan. 18) has mindlessly
reiterated old, false arguments
about the strength and inten
tions of the Soviet Union. To
support his thesis that the
Soviet Union poses no threat
to the United States, Alben
makes extraordinary
generalizations without the
slightest support of evidence.
Herewithin, a few corrections
to the record.
Alben opens his column with
a ritual invocation of "Joe
McCarthy," whose ghost,
Alben believes, today controls
all the principal anti-Soviet
spokesmen in America. This
cheap smear is similar to the
ones McCarthy used and about
as logical. The implicit equa
tion is: McCarthy was despica
ble; McCarthy opposed com
munism; ergo, anyone who
opposes communism is de
spicable. Let's get this clear:
McCarthy was a rogue, not for
opposing communism, but for
destroying civil liberties in his
efforts to eliminate American
communists. I am not McCar
thyite for proclaiming publicly
that communism threatens
America; I am McCarthyite
only if I deny Alben his right to
proclaim the contrary.
"I suggest that the Soviets
have reached military parity —
or rough parity — with the Un
ited States and thatthey arewil
ling to sit tight at this
juncture," declares Alben.
Currently the Soviet Union
disposes of 168 combat divi
sions; the United States, 19.
America's 1280 tanks face
26,000 Russian ones. 231 Soviet
attack submarines are de
ployed against 75 American.
That is very, very "rough" par
ity indeed. For the past eleven
years, America has constructed
no new missle launchers,
being content with 1054 while
Russia has built its stock to
1600; America renounced the
ABM, while Russia is feverishly
trying to build one; the Soviet
Union has increased its
number of tanks by 40 percent;
Soviet military spending is 30
percent higher than America's,

although costs are lower and
the Russian CNP is much
lower. That is a very strange
way to "sit tight." (My figures
come from the Institute of
Strategic Studies in London.
Alben gives no figures).
Alben then tries to argue that
the Soviet Union is not an ally
of communism. "They are al
lies of those they can control."
"...they have demonstrated an
ability to support regimes of
opposite ideology..." Alben
has neatly avoided the central
issue. The Soviet leaders are
committed to an ideological
system that takes as its funda
mental statement, "capitalism
must be destroyed." Soviet
foreign policy actions are di
rected toward that ultimate
goal. At times, that goal may be
served by alliances with non
communist nations, as during
the Second World War. But the
Soviet objective has never
changed: to destroy the way of
life known to the West. Get
back to your basic reading, Al
ben. Read the Communist
Manifesto. Read Lenin on
world revolution. Read some
articles in Pravda. In short, do
your homework.
Not only is Russia not an ally
of communism, maintains Al
ben; verily, it is becoming an
ally of the West. Alben cites
Russia's dependence on West
ern technology sales, grain,
other economic support. The
fallacy is attractive: economic
dependence, one would think,
ought to lead to political al
liance. But it doesn't work that
way: Britain and Germany
were each other's largest trad
ing partners in 1914. Russia and
Germany did a brisk trade right
up to the German invasion of
)une, 1941. The Germans pro
fited from trade with the nation
they were plotting to destroy.
Today Russia is doing the
same.
Alben progresses from his
conclusion that Russia is de
pendent on the West to say,
"(A relaxation of international
tensions) will afford them (the
Soviets) a better opportunity to
pursuetheir interests." Indeed
it will. I commend to Alben's

attention, and to the attention
of the Republic, a speech made
by Leonid Brezhnev in 1973, in
which Brezhnev proclaimed
quite openly that detente is
simply a ruse designed to
change the balance of power
decisively in Russia's favor.
"We have been able to ac
complish more in a short time
with detente than was done for
years pursuing the confronta
tion policy...By 1985, as a con
sequence of detente, we will
have achieved most of our ob
jectives in Western
Europe. ..And a decisive shift in
