## Deadening of imagination dangerous 
### 
I sat down to watch the tube
last Friday evening and when I
switched on the set I found I
was watching a program called
"Flying High." I am usually
bored to death by television
whose inanity is only exceeded
by that of the commercials
which mercifully interrupt it to
allow long awaited treks to the
refrigerator for another can of
beer.
A little boredom after a hec
tic day would be welcome, I
thought. Soon I would be lul
led into a semi-comotose state.
I had never seen the show
before and expected the usual
garbage, but for once I was
paying attention. "Ah hah,"
you "Flying High" regulars say.
"Another debauched sinner has
joined the ranks of the watch
ers of soft porn TV." Perhaps
that is true. But there is some
thing else that fascinated me
that I couldn't quite discern. I,
who have effortlessly resisted
almost all television was sud
denly taken by what on the sur
face appeared to be another ut
terly vapid skin show of the
same genre as "Charlie's
Angels."
But it wasn't just the sight of
beautifully proportioned Hol
lywood starlettes jostling their
breasts before my eyes that at

tracted my attention. There is
so much of that nowadays that
one hardly takes notice of it un
less there is something excep
tional about the way in which it
is presented. Moreover, there
are several magazines and
movies that will show a person
all there is to see in full color
for a modest price.
There is nothing unique
about our three protagonists,
all stewardesses. Predictably,
they are depicted by their
paternalistic writers as wholly
dependent on an uncom
promising but witty twosome,
namely their scheduling officer
and their airline captain. The
stereotypes ridicule them
selves. And the plot . . . What
plot?
The program is a throwback
to an age when women were
more docile and men less in
timidated (or so we are told).
There must be a bit of nostalgia
in this program for hard-core
chauvinists. But there is some
thing particularly engaging
about the way the pornog
raphy is presented. It is far
from graphic. Much of the nud
ity is implied — someone is in a
bathtub with head and shoul
ders visible for example. What
nudity there is is still quite dis

creet when compared to the
regular porn movie fare or a
classic oil painting with full
frontal nudity.
What is interesting then, is
not the explicit nature of the
pornography, but its unwitting
emphasis on the use of imagi
nation. I am not sure this is the
best use for the imagination,
but it seems to me that the im
agination gets very little use
these days and so any use at all
seems welcome.
I therefore think another
kind of nostalgia has also
helped to make the show
popular. It is a longing to go
back to those days when one
did not wait for the movie, but
read the book instead, when
one created entire worlds and
vicariously lived events by
exercising that exciting capac
ity the human mind has for im
againing things, for creating.
In this age we are rarely chal
lenged to use our imagina
tions. We are rarely asked to be
creative in our responses.
Most often we are confronted
with a juvenile multiple choice
test. Is it Brand X or Ivory we
prefer? Do we like Skippy
(cleverly disguised as Brand A)
over Brand Band C?
John Gardner once com
mented on the way parents

bring up their children nowa
days, and I think it is applicable
to all of us in our relationship
to the world. He said we are
handed cut flowers when what
we should be asked to do is
grow our own.
I fear that a deadening of im
agination foreshadows a
civilization going brittle. But as
everyone knows our imagina
tion comes and goes. Even as
children we were rudely inter
rupted in our daydreams by
maternal demands that we pick
up the mess and do our
homework.
If the popularity of programs
such as "Flying High" and
"Charlie's Angels" is a sign of
our country's increasing deca
dence, it is a simultaneous re
minder that there are still a lot
of people out there with an im
agination. I'm not ready to call
the race between the deca
dence we see and the vigor we
still retain. But I will say that in
the not too distant future this
country's imagination could
blossom like no one expects
and then all the prophets of
doom will have to return to
their gloomy caves until darker
times return.

In this age we are rarely chal
lenged to use our imagina
tions. We are rarely asked to be
creative in our responses.
Most often we are confronted
with a juvenile multiple choice
test. Is it Brand X or Ivory we
prefer? Do we like Skippy
(cleverly disguised as Brand A)
over Brand Band C?
John Gardner once com
mented on the way parents

bring up their children nowa
days, and I think it is applicable
to all of us in our relationship
to the world. He said we are
handed cut flowers when what
we should be asked to do is
grow our own.
I fear that a deadening of im
agination foreshadows a
civilization going brittle. But as
everyone knows our imagina
tion comes and goes. Even as
children we were rudely inter
rupted in our daydreams by
maternal demands that we pick
up the mess and do our
homework.
If the popularity of programs
such as "Flying High" and
"Charlie's Angels" is a sign of
our country's increasing deca
dence, it is a simultaneous re
minder that there are still a lot
of people out there with an im
agination. I'm not ready to call
the race between the deca
dence we see and the vigor we
still retain. But I will say that in
the not too distant future this
country's imagination could
blossom like no one expects
and then all the prophets of
doom will have to return to
their gloomy caves until darker
times return.

I sat down to watch the tube
last Friday evening and when I
switched on the set I found I
was watching a program called
"Flying High." I am usually
bored to death by television
whose inanity is only exceeded
by that of the commercials
which mercifully interrupt it to
allow long awaited treks to the
refrigerator for another can of
beer.
A little boredom after a hec
tic day would be welcome, I
thought. Soon I would be lul
led into a semi-comotose state.
I had never seen the show
before and expected the usual
garbage, but for once I was
paying attention. "Ah hah,"
you "Flying High" regulars say.
"Another debauched sinner has
joined the ranks of the watch
ers of soft porn TV." Perhaps
that is true. But there is some
thing else that fascinated me
that I couldn't quite discern. I,
who have effortlessly resisted
almost all television was sud
denly taken by what on the sur
face appeared to be another ut
terly vapid skin show of the
same genre as "Charlie's
Angels."
But it wasn't just the sight of
beautifully proportioned Hol
lywood starlettes jostling their
breasts before my eyes that at

tracted my attention. There is
so much of that nowadays that
one hardly takes notice of it un
less there is something excep
tional about the way in which it
is presented. Moreover, there
are several magazines and
movies that will show a person
all there is to see in full color
for a modest price.
There is nothing unique
about our three protagonists,
all stewardesses. Predictably,
they are depicted by their
paternalistic writers as wholly
dependent on an uncom
promising but witty twosome,
namely their scheduling officer
and their airline captain. The
stereotypes ridicule them
selves. And the plot . . . What
plot?
The program is a throwback
to an age when women were
more docile and men less in
timidated (or so we are told).
There must be a bit of nostalgia
in this program for hard-core
chauvinists. But there is some
thing particularly engaging
about the way the pornog
raphy is presented. It is far
from graphic. Much of the nud
ity is implied — someone is in a
bathtub with head and shoul
ders visible for example. What
nudity there is is still quite dis

creet when compared to the
regular porn movie fare or a
classic oil painting with full
frontal nudity.
What is interesting then, is
not the explicit nature of the
pornography, but its unwitting
emphasis on the use of imagi
nation. I am not sure this is the
best use for the imagination,
but it seems to me that the im
agination gets very little use
these days and so any use at all
seems welcome.
I therefore think another
kind of nostalgia has also
helped to make the show
popular. It is a longing to go
back to those days when one
did not wait for the movie, but
read the book instead, when
one created entire worlds and
vicariously lived events by
exercising that exciting capac
ity the human mind has for im
againing things, for creating.
