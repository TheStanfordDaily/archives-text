# New peer tutoring program aids engineers
## 
### CYNTHIA SANTANA 
Thanks to an innovative
communication project de
veloped by University graduate
Ellen Nold, engineering majors
here are being prepared for
writing and public speaking in
the working world.
"In academia, papers are
written for people who already
know the subject. The 'real
wotld' is different; people are
truly ignorant, and there are
requirements for communicat
ing to these people the proce
dures and conclusions of one's
work," said Nold.
"Engineers, as is the case
with most people, don't realize
that writing is more than the
ability to structure a correct
sentence. Equally important is
the need to place sentences so
as to marshal ideas clearly,"
she added.
Nold, who taught here and
worked with the under
graduate writing program from
1972 to 1976, sold her idea to
the School of Engineering by
"making them an offer they
couldn't refuse. Except for my
salary, all of the money the En
gineering School puts into the
project goes to its own stu
dents," Nold said.
Student tutors trained by
Nold teach technical writing
skills as teaching assistants
(TAs) in engineering courses.
Since the program started in
1976, 400 tutors have been
trained and 800 students have
been tutored.
Prospective tutors, usually
fifth year co-terminal students
in a number of fields, submit a
written composition to Nold,
who judges the paper's quality
and determines how much
time she would need to train
the person to be an excellent
writer and help others improve
their writing. Nold then
chooses approximately 24 stu
dents to enroll in Engineering
101, "Teaching Technical and
Expository Writing." The pros

pective tutors rewrite papers,
receive and give tutorials, and
are taught techniques for im
proving others' writing.
Students who successfully
pass the course compete for
the tutoring jobs. Engineering
professors choose whether to
incorporate writing instruction
in their classes. This year 15
professors decided to use
tutors. Tutors receive a partial
tuition rebate and work for an
hourly wage as well. In addi
tion to the writing program, Julie
Burks, a senior majoring in in
dustrial engineering and once a
tutor in Nold's program, now
teaches a course on public
speaking.
As with the writing courses,
the philosophy of the class is to
learn by doing. "The emphasis
of the class is practice. Most of
the time is spent with class
members up front giving
speeches, which works in giv
ing people confidence and ex
perience in speaking in front of
a group of people. Feedback is
done with peer rating forms
and video-tape playbacks,"
Burks said.
Burks said it is "weird" to be
giving grades to peers and

graduate students, but for the
most part she has no trouble
commanding respect from her
students.
The ingenious twist of the
program is the idea of "peer
tutoring. Being taught by
another student is powerfully
psychological. A student
thinks 'This guy does it, I can
get good enough to do it, too!'
Nold said.
"Because I am a peer, I feel
committed to saying intelligent
things," said John Connor, a
graduate student in geo
technical engineering. "I feel
responsible for my comments.
Older professors can get away
with saying anything, but a
student is looking to see what I
do and don't know."
"With my own writing I
know that I don't take the time
to review it, mainly because I
don't do a lot of writing. I don't
spend a lot of time scrutinizing
my papers. Working with a
tutor forces me to examine my
own writing and take the time
to notice my errors," said
Roger Kilgore, a senior "tutee"
majoring in civil engineering.
"I respect the fact that the tutor
knows more than me and very

rarely do I disagree with his
criticisms."
According to Nold and the
tutors, technical writing is
more structured than exposit
ory writing. When writing pro
cedures on how to manufac
ture an item or when writing
for engineering journals, exact
wording is required, she said.
"Civil Engineering Magazine
has the worst writers in the
world," Kilgore said. "And all
of them are engineers. They
could all use a tutor."
"I find it amazing that any
one learns anything about writ
ing, but I have seen how effec
tively the tutoring program can
improve a person's writing. I
think what is most effective is
that rather than receiving a
paper that is soiled with red
ink, the evaluation is done in
person so that particular prob
lems can be worked out,"
Connor said.
Amid the praise tutors re
ceive and the alleged im
provement of student writing,
several students voiced dis
satisfaction with the project. "I
really don't think that my writ
ing improved on the whole. I
wrote the way the tutor wanted

me to, but I don't think it was
really any better," said Richard
Archuleta, a senior in electrical
engineering. "My other
friends who also took the
course feel the same way I do.
Generally, I feel tutoring is a
good idea, but I think they are
trying to teach too much in one
shot," he said.
Working with foreign stu
dents requires yet another ap
proach to teaching. "The
foreign students make up a
small subset of the project, and
receive extra training. What
makes it easier, though, is that
their writing is defined for a
particular audience. We re
spond to their needs by con
centrating on getting their dis
sertations passed by their ad
visers," Nold said.
Because the project involves
educational research, Nold has
received funding from the
Exxon Educational Foundation
to write a textbook detailing
writing and speech fundamen
tals for engineers.
She has been contacted by
several companies and univer
sities, seeking information to
coordinate programs similiar
to the program here.
