## Listenable pop-wave anger 
### 
Armed Forces
E|lvis Costello
and the Attractions
Columbia
Whether they know it or
riot, this album is the record
all the so-called "punks"
Have been trying to make
but don't have the talent to:
an album which success
fully combines the anger
and rebelliousness of the
'Inew wave" movement
the extremely appeal
ing musical values of the
middle to late '60s pop-rock
(musical denseness,
clever and strong hooks,
etc.). Costello, and his pro
ducer Nick Lowe (musically
talented in his own right),
tpave the sense to realize
that all the complaining in
the world is futile if people
\&;on't listen to your music.
In accordance, they have
delivered this album,
fymed Forces, one of the
best, most listenable al
bums to appear in quite
some time, and a step above
Gostello's last two albums,
hjoth excellent. This is the
of album you like on
first listening.
Even the album's worst
two songs, "Senior Service"
alnd "Moods for Moderns,"

manage to hold the lis
tener's attention and rate
above mediocre. And the
album has an unusual
number of bright spots.
"Accidents Will Happen," a
somewhat balladic piece
about lovers fooling around
with others and getting
hurt, as well as hurting
others, is classic delectible
pop, and could well see its
way into the top 40 (giving
Costello the recognition he
has long deserved). "O
liver's Army," a poignant
protest of war and all that
surrounds it, moves swiftly
and engrossingly through
out, and is more enjoyable
and meaningful than much
of what such '60s heroes as
the Beatles did with pop.
"Chemistry Class" is
another pop feast which
also demonstrates Costel
lo's lyrical sense of humor
and wit. Sings Costello:
"You've got a chemistry
class, I want a piece of your
mind. . A little thought,
with respect to rhyme, re
veals what Costello really
wants. Touche!
In "Two Little Hitlers,"
Costello once again disdain
fully comments on what is
apparently his favorite to

pic, lover relations ("Two
little Hitlers fight it out until
one little Hitler does the
other one's will"). "Two Lit
tle Hitlers" is another
sounds-of-the-'6os-flashback
(interestingly, Nick Lowe
had a song called "Little Hi
tler" on his recent solo al
bum, "Pure Pop for Now
People"). "Two Little Hit
lers" is followed by the al
bum's last song, "(What's so
Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love
and Understanding," a
number which Nick Lowe
wrote, but which fits right in
with the rest of the album,
demonstrating how
strongly suited Costello
and Lowe are for each
other.
And this probably exp
lains this album's success.
Costello's anger has mixed
with Lowe's ear for well
produced pop to create the
album at hand. You might
call it a favorable mutation,
more lyrically meaningful
than pop is generally sup
posed to be, and better
musically than most anger
filled "new wave" music. To
say the least, it is a favorable
mutation. Let's hope this
"pop wave" mutant con
tinues to breed.
