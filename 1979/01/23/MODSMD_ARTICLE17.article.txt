An American Prayer
Jim Morrison and the Doors
Elektra
No eternal reward will forgive us now
For wasting the dawn.
—James Douglas Morrison
Jim Morrison was the Night. Chaos. The
Acid King. The Edge. The Moment. As lead
singer of the L.A.-based Doors, a '60s
"supergroup" renowned for its experien
tial free-form experiments in improvisa
tional musical exploration, Morrison was
the Shaman Serpent King Supreme,
leather-boy arch rock god, gonzo witch-

doctor and electric-pulse eclectic whose
performances were evangelical rituals and
exercises in mass hysteria for 10,000
people.
Or so says the press of the day. For it was
the press who fueled the Morrison myth,
the living legend, until it was utterly dis
proportionate to the reality of the man.
The scenario reads like a script for a bad
"B"-grade movie: more scholar/poet than
musican, Morrison and keyboardist-friend
Ray Manzarek formed a group in 1965 that
eventually metamorphosed into the
Doors. The band quickly became re
nowned for their hit single ("Light my
Fire," "Touch Me") and for their long
psychedelic musical rambles ("When The
Music's Over," "The End"), for their un
predictable and imaginative concerts and
for Morrison, the focal point, who sym
bolized the darker side of '60s sen
sibilities.
Flair
"I'm really pleased to be alive now," he
told Rolling Stone in 1969, "I think we're
going to look very good to future people
because so many changes are taking place
and we're really handling it with a flair."
Morrison was a renaissance man whose
heroes included Keats, Kerouac and Rim
baud. He lived the superstar's "depraved"
existence of groupies, drugs and drink, a

Satyricon whirl constantly and danger
ously close to the Brink: to him, life was a
great experiment. Lifestyle eventually
triumphed over human capacity, and the
world lost another vital creative power.
Labor of love
Now, 10 years later, we have An Ameri
can Prayer, two years in the making and a
"labor of love" for Morrison's friends and
fellow musicians. The album's release rep
resents a courageous corporate decision
by Elektra — this is no money-making mill
ion seller. It features snatches culled from
some 25 hours of Morrison's poetry re
corded on his birthday in 1970, set to
Doors music both past and present. Beaut
ifully packaged (including an eight-page
booklet of pictures, drawings and written
poetry), the disc is audio-verite, including
song, spoken verse, storytelling, even a
phone conversation.
One basic concept unifies the diverse
themes that are Morrison's poetry: his is
an immediate and turgid vision of
America. Through his eyes we see child
hood (". . . we laugh like soft, mad chil
dren/ Snug in the wooly cotton brains of
infancy"). We're on the streets, in "scenes
of rape in the arroyo,/ Seductions in cars,
abandoned buildings"). We're in our car,
when "the musicwas new;/black polished
chrome/ and came over the summer/ like
liquid night. /The D) took pills to stay
awake."
Rich with cinematic visions, Morrison's
work reveals the nether night world of

L.A., of "large buxom obese queens . . J
Drag strip officials/Tight lipped losers and/
Lustful Fuck Salesmen." It is a world of sex
("Girls in garages, stripped . . ./ jumped,
humped, born to suffer,/ made to undress
in the wilderness.") and death ("Did you
have a good world when you died?/
Enough to base a movie on?").
The music, sparklingly recorded, is sig
nature Doors: sometimes pulsating and
sensuous, the snakecharmer's weapon,
other times ethereal, star-bitten. It sup
ports Morrison's verse, weaving around
the lines in unhurried, trance-like throbs.
Pictoral documentary
The epic "American Prayer" reads like a
pictoral documentary of Vietnam, rock
music, communalism, TV, and all that was
America in the '60s. Morrison's work on
this album survives the test of time, and
exists as a first-hand glimpse, a sociologi
cal keyhole to a very different America in a
very different time.
On July 3, 1971, Jim Morrison died in
Paris, France, of an apparent "heart at
tack." He was 27.
The loss is ours.
Do you know how pale and wanton thrill
ful
comes death on a strange hour
unannounced, unplanned for
like a scaring over-friendly guest you've
brought to bed
(Dave Ford rarely drinks soft drinks. If
ever.)
