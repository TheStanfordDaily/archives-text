## Another streetcar named Desire 
### 
The Palo Alto Players are staging A Streetcar Named Desire at
the Palo Alto Community Theater. They do it rather well. Every
body in the production performs creditably, and occasionally
there are moments unsettling in their power. The set is striking,
the direction is good, and the thing rarely strays from the play that
Williams wrote.
This is good
And all of this is good. But the exceptional thing about this
production is the play itself, and the consistency with which this
play can cut you to the bone. It seems to me to be the kind of
thing that one is morally bound to see, the kind of thing one

ought to memorize and mumble along with the actors. To hear
Stanley tell Blanche he is not a Polack is one of the surest thrills I
know — to see Mitch stand up and punch Stanley in the face is
always a source of satisfaction. And Blanche has lines damn-near
unrivalled about Cod, and her life, and the courtesy of strangers,
and Stella with Stanley on the stairway is something to behold.
Almost always
Streetcar is a almost always worth one's while. This production
is no exception. And this is not to say that in and of itself the Palo
Alto players were lacking — they were rather good, and they did
do justice to a very demanding text.
Rick Lee's Stanley is properly loud, and eventually properly
maniacal, and he manages as well to provide us at times with a
thin sort of Ralph Cramden type. Stanley here is clumsy, and
funny, in addition to being possessed of his traditional vicious
magnetism and Lee does that well without getting it in the way of
our knowledge that in the last act he rapes his wife's sister.
Intelligent but nuts
And the Palo Alto Blanche is equally effective. Carolyn Davis
Burr keeps her character intelligent at the same time she keeps
her pathetic, and she keeps us aware that the woman, though
nuts, is deserving of considerable empathy.
But for the most part it's the play; let me make that point for
permanent. It's not the kind of thing that gives itself more credit
than it deserves, and if you do not think so you are out of your
stinking mind.
