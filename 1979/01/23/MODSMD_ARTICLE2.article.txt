# Ehrlich criticizes nuclear report
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
Prof. Paul Ehrlich, population
biologist and long-time proponent of
zero population growth, said yester
day the Rasmussen report on nuclear
safety is "largely a crock."
Ehrlich agreed with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's (NRC) re
cent decision to withdraw its en
dorsement of the 1975 report, then
hailed as a definitive study of the
dangers of nuclear power plants.
"That the report was incompetent
was apparent years ago when the
draft first appeared," he said.
The study was widely quoted in
support of nuclear power as an at
tractive solution to the energy crisis.
In its conclusions, the report stated
that the chance of a major mishap at a
nuclear reactor was as small as the
chance that a meteor would hit a
large city â€” once in a million years.
Ehrlich's principal argument
against the study was that it ignored
the possibility of sabotage in deter
mining the hazards of fission power
plants.

"Discussing the dangersof nuclear
power without talking about the
likelihood of sabotage is like discus
sing traffic accidents without think
ing about drunken driving," Ehrlich
said.
Conclusion misrepresented
Ehrlich also criticized the report
for being "basically dishonest" be
cause he said it misrepresented its
conclusions in the summary. The re
port was very long and consequently
many people ignored the bulk of the
report and read only the commis
sion's synopsis of its findings.
The NRC's latest release said the
summary is "a poor description of
the contents of the report." The re
port may leave readers with "a mis
placed confidence in the validityof the
risk estimates," the release said.
Ehrlich has been active for a long
time in the fight against nuclear
power. He has warned the public
since the 1960s about the depletion
of non-renewable resources and re
cently published a book, The Race
Bomb, in which he claims there is no

connection between race and intelli
gence.
Ehrlich said the methods of
analysis the commission used were
at fault at the start. He questioned
the commission's ability to compute
the exact probabilities that various
failures would occur, and raised the
issue of human error. "How do you
calculate the probability that some
one will install a valve backwards?"
he said.
"You know the old line, 'a fool can
be found to overcome every fool
proof system,"' he said.
Asked of the consequences the
NRC's retraction might have on the
fate of nuclear power in the United
States, Ehrlich said it will be more
difficult for proponents of nuclear
power to claim it is perfectly safe.
Without a comprehensive national
energy program, Ehrlich said certain
"idiots" might try to push nuclear
power. "That would be a terrible mis
take, particularly with the compe
tence the industry has at this time."

"There are two things one can say
about nuclear power. One is that
cheap, abundant power would not
be good for our society since we use
that kind of power to do destructive
things to the environment. Another
is that it i-s a premature technology
that we should continue to develop"
so that it can be used in the future, he
said. The NRC withdrew its support
Thursday from the report which it
had commissioned and endorsed
three and a half years ago.
According the The New York
Times, a spokesman for the NRC said
the decision to repudiate the Ras
mussen report was not due to an in
creased chance of reactor break
down, but rather to a re-evaluation of
the bounds of error involved in de
termining it.
The spokesman also said an inves
tigation is underway to find out how
many of the 60 reactors licensed in
the United States since the report
was released, gained approval based
in part on the Rasmussen findings.
