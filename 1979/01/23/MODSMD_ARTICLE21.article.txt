# Coupon fraud noted
## 
### Associated Press 
Clipping coupons from
newspapers isn't just a way
thrifty shoppers save nic
kels and dimes. Some au
thorities estimate manufac
turers are bilked out of at
least $200 million a year by
organized fraud.
Makers of laundry soap,
coffee, dog food, tooth
paste, paper towels and
other products increasingly
are promoting theif goods
by issuing coupons offering
discounts. And as the use of
coupons has grown — an
estimated 70 billion were is
sued last year — so has
fraud.
It works this way. A soap
company puts coupons in
newspapers, magazines or
the mail offering 25 cents off
on the purchase of it,s pro
duct. When you buy the
soap, the grocer cuts 25
cents oft the price. He later
sends the coupon to the
company, which sends him
the 25 cents plus a handling
charge. Fraud enters the
picture when the coupon is
redeemed without any soap
being purchased.
For example, crooks with

wads of clipped coupons
often find storeowners wil
ling to include the fraudu
lent claims in their legiti
mate coupon redemptions.
In other cases, coupon
clearinghouses, which act
as middlemen between
merchants and manufactur
ers, send in fraudulent
claims.
The New York district at
torney's office estimates
about 20 percent of the $930
million paid out in redemp
tions in 1977 involved fraud,
of $186 million.
"It is just like money,"
said one investigator, who
had counted as much as $12
worth of coupons in some
newspapers. "You can pick
up a newspaper for 15 cents
and make a hell of a profit."
But the industry has some
defenses. Blair Graphic
Group, a New York com
pany that prints millions of
coupons, now puts serial
numbers on them. They can
be used to spot a problem
— such as large quantities of
coupons being sent from
Louisiana for redemption
when the advertisements
ran in Michigan.
