Iran general supports Bakhtiar
Tehran, Iran — Iran's military chief, in an unpre
cedented radio appeal, called on his troops yes
terday to "overcome their sentiments" for Mos
lem religious leaders and defend the government
left behind by the shah.
A serious blow was dealt to the embattled gov
ernment of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar,
when the head of the Regency Council that sup
posedly is acting in the shah's absence, Jalal
Tehrani, resigned under pressure from anti-shah
religious leader Ayatullah Khomeini.
In other developments, new political violence
flared in the provinces. Armored troops in one
western city broke up street battles between pro
and anti-shah gangs in which five persons were
reported killed.
Gen. Abbas Charabaghi, military chief of staff,
made his broadcast speech after telling reporters
the430,000-man armed forces stood firmly behind
the "legal and constitutional" Bakhtiar govern
ment in the face of the challenge by Khomeini,
long-exiled head of Iran's dominant Shiite Moslem
sect.
Khomeini, who orchestrated the movement that
drove Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from Iran,
plans to return to Iran Friday and vows to replace
Bakhtiar and the U.S.-backed constitutional
monarchy with an Islamic republic.
The army, many of whose top commanders re
main loyal to the shah, may hold the key to
whether Khomeini succeeds in toppling the
Pahlavi dynasty. Tehran has been filled with
rumors of a possible military coup to keep Kho
meini from power.
Carter: more money for defense
Washington — President )immy Carter urged
Congress yesterday to let him spend more for de
fense but cut some job programs in a $532 billion
budget that is stirring controversy within the pres
ident's own party.
Describing his budget as "lean and austere,"
Carter said he plans to reduce this year's $37.4
billion budget deficit to $29 billion in 1980, during
the presidential campaign. The deficit would fall to
$1 billion in 1981.
Liberals within the Democratic party, particu
larly Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), have
criticized proposed cuts in school lunch, jobs and
other programs. "The budget asks the poor, the
black, the sick, the young, the cities and the un
employed to bear a disproportionate share of the
. . . reductions," Kennedy said yesterday.
Carter's decision to fight inflation with an au
stere budget that cuts some domestic social prog
rams follows advise from his political pollster, Pat
rick Caddell, who told the president-elect in 1976
that a second term depended on substantial sup
port from middle-income suburbanites who view
federal spending and inflation as major problems.
At the same time, Carter and his chief political
lieutenant, Hamilton Jordan, say the anti-inflation
effort will help poor people more than they will be
harmed by the cuts in social spending.
High court will judge on Laetrile
Washington — The Supreme Court, stepping
into a medical and legal storm of controversy, said

yesterday it will decide whether the federal gov
ernment may ban Laetrile.
The justices voted to study lower court rulings
that have permitted the substance's use by termi
nally ill cancer victims.
The controversy swirling around Laetrile, a de
rivative of apricot pits, is a highly emotional one
because of modern medicine's failure thus far to
conquer cancer.
The justices' eventual decision may hinge on the
privacy rights of cancer victims — whether the
government may limit the treatments available to
persons suffering from a disease for which there is
no known cure.
Government lawyers say the Laetrile ban is
necessary to protect cancer victims because the
substance has not been found to be safe or effec
tive.
Opponents of the substance also have argued
that allowing Laetrile treatments could keep
cancer patients from seeking more traditional
therapies that have been proven partly effective.
Second N.J. tenement fire kills 7
Jersey City, N.J. —Northern New Jersey's second
tenement fire in three days killed five children and
two adults yesterday, and police launched a man
hunt for an arsonist who may have torched the
building in a personal vendetta.
The fire brought the death toll to 40 persons
killed in fires thought to have been deliberately set
in northern New Jersey cities in the past six weeks,
authorities said.
A mother and her five children were among
those who died when a pre-dawn blaze swept
through a four-story brick building in the third
such fire in the Jersey City tenement since De
cember.
Victims were seen pounding on a window
shortly before firefighters arrived, but apparently
were overcome by smoke when they tried to reach
a fire escape, said Deputy Fire Chief Dominick
Cardillo.
Jersey City police hunted a man seen fleeing the
building. Less than two miles away a demolition
crew sifting through the rubble of a Hoboken
tenement found the last two bodies missing after a
fire on Saturday that clamed 21 lives.
Gov't sues Peoples Temple
San Francisco — The Justice Department filed
suit yesterday to recover nearly $4.3 million from
the Peoples Temple for costs to the government of
handling the bodies of more than 900 dead church
members and flying survivors out of Guyana last
fall.
The civil suit charged that the Peoples Temple
failed to protect its members, most of whom died
in a suicide-murder ritual led by the Rev. Jim Jones
in Jonestown last Nov. 18.
The government said the Peoples Temple had an
implied contract with its members to provide them
the necessities of life, including a proper burial.
The Justice Department said President Jimmy
Carter was aware of the suit and approved of it.
Department spokesman Terry Adamson in
Washington said the president was informed of
the probability of the suit about 10 days ago and
wrote back that it should be pursued if legally
feasible.

Peoples Temple officials and attorneys were not
immediately available to comment on the gov
ernment suit.
The suit said the government has spent
$4,298,000 so far on Peoples Temple matters,
mostly to remove the bodies from Guyana and
store them, and to fly survivors back. The suit said
the government undertook the task "for reasons
of public health, safety and decency, with the in
tent of being reimbursed."
Two Ryan aides vie forvacant post
Redwood City — jackie Speier, legislative coun
sel to the late Rep. Leo Ryan, officially announced
her candidacy for Ryan's congressional seat yes
terday and took out nomination papers.
Her candidacy sets into turmoil the previously
unanimous endorsement by Ryan's family of C.W.
"Joe" Holsinger, Ryan's administrative aide.
Three members of the family said the family will
endorse both Holsinger and Speier in the March 6
election.
At a press conference last week, Speier said that
Ryan's dying words were a plea for her to carry on
his work.
Ryan, and four others, were shot and killed in an
airstrip attack in Guyana last Nov. 18, after a visit to
the Peoples Temple jungle settlement. Hours after
the shootings, the Rev. Jim Jones led 900 cult fol
lowers in a mass murder-suicide ritual.
Speier, 28, who accompanied Ryan on the trip,
was wounded in the attack. She has scars on her
arms and legs, wears a cast on her right arm and
has a bullet lodged in her pelvis.
Holsinger, who made the family's support a con
tingency of his candidacy, said he will remain in
the race despite the family's equal support of
Speier.
"I made the commitment on the basis of their
commitment," said the 57-year-old aide.
Bill may reduce marijuana fines
Sacramento — An attempt to cut California's
penalties for growing small amounts of marijuana
was launched yesterday by a San Francisco legis
lator.
Democratic Assemblyman Willie Brown intro
duced a bill that would lower the maximum pen
alty for growing a limited number of plants to a
$100 fine.
Currently, cultivation of any amount of pot car
ries a potential prison sentence of up to three
years.
Budget fails to provoke market
New York — The stock market was mixed yes
terday, registering no strong response either way
to President Jimmy Carter's fiscal 1980 budget.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
edged up 1.3 last week, rose another 1.04 to
838.53.
Volume on the Big Board came to 24.39 million
shares, down from 26.80 million Friday.
Today's weather
Fair through tonight except local fog and low
clouds late night and mornings. Variable cloudi
ness tomorrow. Little temperature change. Lows
in upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs in mid 50s to mid
60s. Light winds.

The civil suit charged that the Peoples Temple
failed to protect its members, most of whom died
in a suicide-murder ritual led by the Rev. Jim Jones
in Jonestown last Nov. 18.
The government said the Peoples Temple had an
implied contract with its members to provide them
the necessities of life, including a proper burial.
The Justice Department said President Jimmy
Carter was aware of the suit and approved of it.

Washington said the president was informed of
the probability of the suit about 10 days ago and
wrote back that it should be pursued if legally

Peoples Temple officials and attorneys were not
immediately available to comment on the gov

The suit said the government has spent
$4,298,000 so far on Peoples Temple matters,
mostly to remove the bodies from Guyana and
store them, and to fly survivors back. The suit said
the government undertook the task "for reasons
of public health, safety and decency, with the in

Iran general supports Bakhtiar
Tehran, Iran — Iran's military chief, in an unpre
cedented radio appeal, called on his troops yes
terday to "overcome their sentiments" for Mos
lem religious leaders and defend the government
left behind by the shah.
A serious blow was dealt to the embattled gov
ernment of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar,
when the head of the Regency Council that sup
posedly is acting in the shah's absence, Jalal
Tehrani, resigned under pressure from anti-shah
religious leader Ayatullah Khomeini.
In other developments, new political violence
flared in the provinces. Armored troops in one
western city broke up street battles between pro
and anti-shah gangs in which five persons were
reported killed.
Gen. Abbas Charabaghi, military chief of staff,
made his broadcast speech after telling reporters
the430,000-man armed forces stood firmly behind
the "legal and constitutional" Bakhtiar govern
ment in the face of the challenge by Khomeini,
long-exiled head of Iran's dominant Shiite Moslem
sect.
Khomeini, who orchestrated the movement that
drove Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from Iran,
plans to return to Iran Friday and vows to replace
Bakhtiar and the U.S.-backed constitutional
monarchy with an Islamic republic.
The army, many of whose top commanders re
main loyal to the shah, may hold the key to
whether Khomeini succeeds in toppling the
Pahlavi dynasty. Tehran has been filled with
rumors of a possible military coup to keep Kho
meini from power.
Carter: more money for defense
Washington — President )immy Carter urged
Congress yesterday to let him spend more for de
fense but cut some job programs in a $532 billion
budget that is stirring controversy within the pres
ident's own party.
Describing his budget as "lean and austere,"
Carter said he plans to reduce this year's $37.4
billion budget deficit to $29 billion in 1980, during
the presidential campaign. The deficit would fall to
$1 billion in 1981.
Liberals within the Democratic party, particu
larly Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), have
criticized proposed cuts in school lunch, jobs and
other programs. "The budget asks the poor, the
black, the sick, the young, the cities and the un
employed to bear a disproportionate share of the
. . . reductions," Kennedy said yesterday.
Carter's decision to fight inflation with an au
stere budget that cuts some domestic social prog
rams follows advise from his political pollster, Pat
rick Caddell, who told the president-elect in 1976
that a second term depended on substantial sup
port from middle-income suburbanites who view
federal spending and inflation as major problems.
At the same time, Carter and his chief political
lieutenant, Hamilton Jordan, say the anti-inflation
effort will help poor people more than they will be
harmed by the cuts in social spending.
High court will judge on Laetrile
Washington — The Supreme Court, stepping
into a medical and legal storm of controversy, said

yesterday it will decide whether the federal gov
ernment may ban Laetrile.
The justices voted to study lower court rulings
that have permitted the substance's use by termi
nally ill cancer victims.
The controversy swirling around Laetrile, a de
rivative of apricot pits, is a highly emotional one
because of modern medicine's failure thus far to
conquer cancer.
The justices' eventual decision may hinge on the
privacy rights of cancer victims — whether the
government may limit the treatments available to
persons suffering from a disease for which there is
no known cure.
Government lawyers say the Laetrile ban is
necessary to protect cancer victims because the
substance has not been found to be safe or effec
tive.
Opponents of the substance also have argued
that allowing Laetrile treatments could keep
cancer patients from seeking more traditional
therapies that have been proven partly effective.
Second N.J. tenement fire kills 7
Jersey City, N.J. —Northern New Jersey's second
tenement fire in three days killed five children and
two adults yesterday, and police launched a man
hunt for an arsonist who may have torched the
building in a personal vendetta.
The fire brought the death toll to 40 persons
killed in fires thought to have been deliberately set
in northern New Jersey cities in the past six weeks,
authorities said.
A mother and her five children were among
those who died when a pre-dawn blaze swept
through a four-story brick building in the third
such fire in the Jersey City tenement since De
cember.
Victims were seen pounding on a window
shortly before firefighters arrived, but apparently
were overcome by smoke when they tried to reach
a fire escape, said Deputy Fire Chief Dominick
Cardillo.
Jersey City police hunted a man seen fleeing the
building. Less than two miles away a demolition
crew sifting through the rubble of a Hoboken
tenement found the last two bodies missing after a
fire on Saturday that clamed 21 lives.
Gov't sues Peoples Temple
San Francisco — The Justice Department filed
suit yesterday to recover nearly $4.3 million from
the Peoples Temple for costs to the government of

Carter: more money for defense
Washington — President )immy Carter urged
Congress yesterday to let him spend more for de
fense but cut some job programs in a $532 billion
budget that is stirring controversy within the pres
ident's own party.
Describing his budget as "lean and austere,"
Carter said he plans to reduce this year's $37.4
billion budget deficit to $29 billion in 1980, during
the presidential campaign. The deficit would fall to
$1 billion in 1981.
Liberals within the Democratic party, particu
larly Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), have
criticized proposed cuts in school lunch, jobs and
other programs. "The budget asks the poor, the
black, the sick, the young, the cities and the un
employed to bear a disproportionate share of the
. . . reductions," Kennedy said yesterday.
Carter's decision to fight inflation with an au
stere budget that cuts some domestic social prog
rams follows advise from his political pollster, Pat
rick Caddell, who told the president-elect in 1976
that a second term depended on substantial sup
port from middle-income suburbanites who view
federal spending and inflation as major problems.
At the same time, Carter and his chief political
lieutenant, Hamilton Jordan, say the anti-inflation
effort will help poor people more than they will be
harmed by the cuts in social spending.
High court will judge on Laetrile
Washington — The Supreme Court, stepping
into a medical and legal storm of controversy, said

yesterday it will decide whether the federal gov
ernment may ban Laetrile.
The justices voted to study lower court rulings
that have permitted the substance's use by termi
nally ill cancer victims.
The controversy swirling around Laetrile, a de
rivative of apricot pits, is a highly emotional one
because of modern medicine's failure thus far to
conquer cancer.
The justices' eventual decision may hinge on the
privacy rights of cancer victims — whether the
government may limit the treatments available to
persons suffering from a disease for which there is
no known cure.
Government lawyers say the Laetrile ban is
necessary to protect cancer victims because the
substance has not been found to be safe or effec
tive.
Opponents of the substance also have argued
that allowing Laetrile treatments could keep
cancer patients from seeking more traditional
therapies that have been proven partly effective.
Second N.J. tenement fire kills 7
Jersey City, N.J. —Northern New Jersey's second
tenement fire in three days killed five children and
two adults yesterday, and police launched a man
hunt for an arsonist who may have torched the
building in a personal vendetta.
The fire brought the death toll to 40 persons
killed in fires thought to have been deliberately set
in northern New Jersey cities in the past six weeks,
authorities said.
A mother and her five children were among
those who died when a pre-dawn blaze swept
through a four-story brick building in the third
such fire in the Jersey City tenement since De
cember.
Victims were seen pounding on a window
shortly before firefighters arrived, but apparently
were overcome by smoke when they tried to reach
a fire escape, said Deputy Fire Chief Dominick
Cardillo.
Jersey City police hunted a man seen fleeing the
building. Less than two miles away a demolition
crew sifting through the rubble of a Hoboken
tenement found the last two bodies missing after a
fire on Saturday that clamed 21 lives.
Gov't sues Peoples Temple
San Francisco — The Justice Department filed
suit yesterday to recover nearly $4.3 million from
the Peoples Temple for costs to the government of
handling the bodies of more than 900 dead church
members and flying survivors out of Guyana last
fall.
The civil suit charged that the Peoples Temple
failed to protect its members, most of whom died
in a suicide-murder ritual led by the Rev. Jim Jones
in Jonestown last Nov. 18.
The government said the Peoples Temple had an
implied contract with its members to provide them
the necessities of life, including a proper burial.
The Justice Department said President Jimmy
Carter was aware of the suit and approved of it.
Department spokesman Terry Adamson in
Washington said the president was informed of
the probability of the suit about 10 days ago and
wrote back that it should be pursued if legally
feasible.

Peoples Temple officials and attorneys were not
immediately available to comment on the gov
ernment suit.
The suit said the government has spent
$4,298,000 so far on Peoples Temple matters,
mostly to remove the bodies from Guyana and
store them, and to fly survivors back. The suit said
the government undertook the task "for reasons
of public health, safety and decency, with the in
tent of being reimbursed."
Two Ryan aides vie forvacant post
Redwood City — jackie Speier, legislative coun
sel to the late Rep. Leo Ryan, officially announced
her candidacy for Ryan's congressional seat yes
terday and took out nomination papers.
Her candidacy sets into turmoil the previously
unanimous endorsement by Ryan's family of C.W.
"Joe" Holsinger, Ryan's administrative aide.
Three members of the family said the family will
endorse both Holsinger and Speier in the March 6
election.
At a press conference last week, Speier said that
Ryan's dying words were a plea for her to carry on
his work.
Ryan, and four others, were shot and killed in an
airstrip attack in Guyana last Nov. 18, after a visit to
the Peoples Temple jungle settlement. Hours after
the shootings, the Rev. Jim Jones led 900 cult fol
lowers in a mass murder-suicide ritual.
Speier, 28, who accompanied Ryan on the trip,
was wounded in the attack. She has scars on her
arms and legs, wears a cast on her right arm and
has a bullet lodged in her pelvis.
Holsinger, who made the family's support a con
tingency of his candidacy, said he will remain in
the race despite the family's equal support of
Speier.
"I made the commitment on the basis of their
commitment," said the 57-year-old aide.

Iran general supports Bakhtiar
Tehran, Iran — Iran's military chief, in an unpre
cedented radio appeal, called on his troops yes
terday to "overcome their sentiments" for Mos
lem religious leaders and defend the government
left behind by the shah.
A serious blow was dealt to the embattled gov
ernment of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar,
when the head of the Regency Council that sup
posedly is acting in the shah's absence, Jalal
Tehrani, resigned under pressure from anti-shah
religious leader Ayatullah Khomeini.
In other developments, new political violence
flared in the provinces. Armored troops in one
western city broke up street battles between pro
and anti-shah gangs in which five persons were
reported killed.
Gen. Abbas Charabaghi, military chief of staff,
made his broadcast speech after telling reporters
the430,000-man armed forces stood firmly behind
the "legal and constitutional" Bakhtiar govern
ment in the face of the challenge by Khomeini,
long-exiled head of Iran's dominant Shiite Moslem
sect.
Khomeini, who orchestrated the movement that
drove Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from Iran,
plans to return to Iran Friday and vows to replace
Bakhtiar and the U.S.-backed constitutional
monarchy with an Islamic republic.
The army, many of whose top commanders re
main loyal to the shah, may hold the key to
whether Khomeini succeeds in toppling the
Pahlavi dynasty. Tehran has been filled with
rumors of a possible military coup to keep Kho
meini from power.
