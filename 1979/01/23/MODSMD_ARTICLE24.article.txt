A story in yesterday's Daily stated
that the Board of Trustees has already
approved a plan for global tuition at
the Medical School. The story should
have read that the trustees have re

ceived the global tuition proposal
and are expected to vote on the issue
sometime next week. The Daily re
grets the error.
