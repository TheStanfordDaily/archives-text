# The 						ERB report: one year later and little change
## 
### SAMUEL HOWE First of two parts 
A year ago October, the ASSU Se
nate elections were plunged into
controversy and the election process
called into question as 19 out of 40
elected senators and alternates were
charged with various campaign ir
regularities.
The punishments ranged from re
primands to disqualification in two
cases.
But another year passed, and this
October saw a relatively quiet elec
tion under an unchanged system,
with little discussion of changing the
election process.

News analysis

Bill Washburn, who served on the
five-member Election Review Board
(ERB) and co-authored its 212-page
final report, said, "I wouldn't say that
anything has directly resulted from
it."
He said the COP (Council of Presi
dents) and senate have put the CRAP
(Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos) proposal to abolish the se
nate and the ERB report "swinging in
the breeze. They took no sides on
anything," he said.
"Substantive recommendations
have been met with almost complete
silence by senators, candidates, the
COP and students in general,"
Washburn said.
Regina Petty, a member of the
COP, said "we tried to get senate
districting and the live petition re
commendations on the fall ballot for
students to consider, but we just
couldn't get the signatures.

"The ERB report is an outstanding
effort with fine recommendations,
but that doesn't mean it has the only
or best recommendations," Petty
said.
Too many votes
Deric Jennings, the co-author and
editor of the ERB report, said that the
number of votes in the system is too
large to make it feasible. "I would say
that, at the very best, a heavily
involved student might know three
candidates," he said.
Proposals for reform have ranged
from lowering the number of votes
allowed per student and a districting
system to a live petition process.
The live petition proposal was
suggested by Jennings and
Washburn in the ERB report. The re
port, a study of the events surround
ing the 1977 senate election con
troversy, concluded with a recom
mendation to completely overhaul
the ASSU Senate and devise a new
method of electing senators.
Live petition
Under the live petition system, the
report explained, "the only thing it
would take to become a full-fledged
member of the ASSU Senate is the
active support of 200 constituents."
Washburn emphasized that the 200
figure was "a ballpark figure," sub
ject to revision.
The number of senators would be
variable and a person could become
a senator at any time during the year,
the report outlined. A student could
only endorse one senator at a given
time, but a student could also switch
or remove his allegiance at any time.
Jennings said that the ERB's prop
osal would "substantially change the

ASSU Senate for the good. The basic
problem has always been one of in
formation to and feedback from the
students."
Active role
By allowing students to take an ac
tive role in student government
rather than anonymously voting for
candidates at the beginning of the
year, the ERB proposal could get the
senate moving again, Jennings said.
Pete Stamos, chairperson of the
senate, said that election reform was
being studied in committee now and
would be addressed by the senate
soon. "Some kind of election reform
will come out of this," he said.
But Stamos said he believed that
final action would come more in the
form of a districting proposal than
anything like the live petition re
commended by jennings and
Washburn. ,
Districting system
Under the districting system,
Stamo? said, senators would be
elected within specific districts,
probably residential for under
graduates and departmental for
graduate students.
"The 10-vote (at large) system now
is ridiculous," he said. "I would re
ally prefer a district system."
Stamos defended the senate
against charges of inaction on the
election issue. He said that one of the
firstthingsdonethisyearwas to insti
tute changes to make the senate
more effective and responsive.
Changes
Among these were a more strin
gent attendance requirement, an in
creased amount of work done in
committee to eliminate needless

"grandstanding and political gar
bage," and a quasi-districting system
now in effect, Stamos said.
Under this system, a senator is re
sponsible for a group of residences
and generally keeping up with stu
dents there. Stamos said that he
thought the system was working
well, although he conceded that
"some of the senators just don't have

the motivation to keep up."
He said he was opposed to the ERB
live petition proposal. "While that's
excellent in terms of student partici
pation, it lacks the close contact with
a specific senator in a residential'dis
trict." A petition senator might have
a constituency spread out all over the
campus, making it harder to serve,
he said.
