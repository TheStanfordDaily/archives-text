# Beirut trap kills PLO mastermind
## 
### 
Beirut, Lebanon (AP) — A booby
trapped automobile packed with
explosives blew up on a Beirut street
yesterday, ripping a passing station
wagon to shreds and killing eight
persons, including Ali Hassan
Salameh, the reputed mastermind of
the 1972 Munich Olumpics mas
sacre, officials said.
The explosion killed four Palesti
nian bodyguards in the station
wagon with him. Shrapnel and flying
glass from the blast killed three
Lebanese pedestrians and wounded
16 others.
The Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion said Salameh, code-named
"Abu Hassan," was mortally injured
when the booby-trapped car, parked
near his heavily-guarded home in
Beirut's Moslem sector, was deto
nated by remote control as Abu Has
san's station wagon passed it.
Abu Hassan, 36, was the top sec
urity guard of PLO guerrilla chieftain
Yassar Arafat and was chief of the
secret service of Al Fata, the largest of
the seven PLO factions.
Arafat and other senior political
leaders of the guerrilla movement
were in Damascus, Syria, attending a
strategy session of the Palestinian
National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile. They are ex
pected to return to Beirut for the
funeral for the funeral, a PLO
spokesman said.
PLO leaders in Damascus ap
peared stunned by the killing, and a
spokesman for Arafat said "Zionist
agents" were responsible.
Arafat, 49, did not comment. He
was said to be too stunned to speak.

"It was done by Zionist agents,"
said Mahmoud Labadi, Arafat's
spokesman. "He (Abu Hassan) is not
the first. He is not the last to die re
sisting Zionist aggression."
Asked why he blamed Israeli
agents for the killing, Labadi said
"they are the only ones to profit.
Who else would profit from such an
attack?"
There was no comment from Is
raeli officials on the bomb attack and
the Israeli media carried reports of
the death with noeditorial comment.
The PLO statement issued in Beirut
did not speculate on a motive for the
assassination or place blame. It de
scribed Abu Hassan, known here as
Arafat's "playboy cop," as a "martyr
of the Palestinian revoluton, the
Palestine Liberation Organization
and Fatah."
Fatah put all its forces in Beirut on
alert after the assassination, but a
Fatah spokesman refused to explain
the action.
The boody-trapped car used in the
assassination was turned into a "pile
of melted metal" by the blast, a wit
ness said. Pieces of the station wagon
were scattered over a 20-yard radius.
Abu Hassan allegedly engineered
the Palestinian terrorist attack on Is
raeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic
Games in Munich, West Germany, in
which 11 Israelis were killed. He was
said to have been involved in several
intra-guerrilla rivalries and repor
tedly was high on Israel's "most
wanted list" of Palestinian guerrilla
leaders.
