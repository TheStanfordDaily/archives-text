# Student raped here Saturday morning

### RANDY DAVID 
A student here was raped in her
University residence early Saturday
morning, according to Police Ser
vices Director Marvin Herrington.
According to police, the incident
was the first reported rape at the
University during this academic year.
An attempted rape near Lake
Lagunita was reported last quarter,
he said. Assistant Dean of Students
Leah Kaplan said she knows of about
eight assaults or rapes that have oc
curred on campus si nee the summer.
Police still are looking for the as
sailant, described as a white male in
his late 20s with brown curly hair and
a stocky build, Herrington said. The
suspect was wearing a brown leather
jacket and blue jeans, had a heavy
smell of cigarette smoke in his
clothes, and had rough hands "pos
sibly from working on automobiles,"
he said.
Police are also searching for a light
green '67-'69 Ford Mustang with
out-of-state license plates, Her

rington said. A car matching this de
scription was seen following another
woman Saturday morning. There is a
"possibility" that the driver was the
suspect, although no description of
the driver was obtained, he said.
The woman requested that neither
her name nor the name of the resi
dence be disclosed.
According to police, the assailant
entered a residence on the west side
of campus about 6 a.m. through a
door that was left propped open. The
door was routinely checked by the
resident assistant (RA) and the house
managerabout 12:30 a.m., and it was
locked at that time, according to
Alice Supton, assistant dean of resi
dential education.
Police have not confirmed
whether the door to the woman's
room was locked or unlocked, but
Herrington said he was "pretty sure"
the door was locked. "It appears to
us as if it was forced," he said.
After entering the room on the
second floor of the house, police
said the assailant's "first demand was
for money." His original intention
was apparently "theft of property,"
Herrington said. The woman was
raped after the assailant went
through the woman's purse, he said.
The assailant did not strike the
woman, Herrington said. "She
wasn't beaten or anything like that,"
he said. After the incident, the
woman was taken to the hospital and
released after being examined.
The woman called police im
mediately after the assault, accord-
ing to Herrington. A professional
counselor, trained to help rape vic
tims, was called in by police to assist
the woman, he said.
Rape victims are given the oppor
tunity to talk to counselors in order
to "help them get through the
trauma of the experience," Her
rington said.
Kaplan said her office tries to assist
rape victims as much as possible.
Herrington said he thinks the as
sailant's decision to enter this wo
man's room was "totally random."
He said the assailant may have
thought that his chances of being
seen would be decreased if he went
to the second floor. There is no

reason to believe the woman knew
the assailant, Herrington said.
Supton said she is hopeful that
people will be more cautious of
safety precautions in their resi
dences. "Apparently there is a habit
of propping open doors," she said.
Supton said she encourages stu
dents to check doors, question un
familiar people in their residence,
and report improperly lighted
places.
A service to escort women back to
their residences in the evening is
now being worked on by the dean of
students' office, Kaplan said.
Police said anyone with informa
tion about the suspected assailant or
the car should notify the police.

raped after the assailant went
through the woman's purse, he said.
The assailant did not strike the
woman, Herrington said. "She
wasn't beaten or anything like that,"
he said. After the incident, the
woman was taken to the hospital and
released after being examined.
The woman called police im
mediately after the assault, accord-
ing to Herrington. A professional
counselor, trained to help rape vic
tims, was called in by police to assist
the woman, he said.
Rape victims are given the oppor
tunity to talk to counselors in order
to "help them get through the
trauma of the experience," Her
rington said.
Kaplan said her office tries to assist
rape victims as much as possible.
Herrington said he thinks the as
sailant's decision to enter this wo
man's room was "totally random."
He said the assailant may have
thought that his chances of being
seen would be decreased if he went
to the second floor. There is no

reason to believe the woman knew
the assailant, Herrington said.
Supton said she is hopeful that
people will be more cautious of
safety precautions in their resi
dences. "Apparently there is a habit
of propping open doors," she said.
Supton said she encourages stu
dents to check doors, question un
familiar people in their residence,
and report improperly lighted
places.
A service to escort women back to
their residences in the evening is
now being worked on by the dean of
students' office, Kaplan said.
Police said anyone with informa
tion about the suspected assailant or
the car should notify the police.
