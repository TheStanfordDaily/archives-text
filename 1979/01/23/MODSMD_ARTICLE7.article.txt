# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Peter Stamos Daily editorial unfair 
### 
Two weeks ago the Daily
editorial board decided to
issue a statement of condem
nation against the ASSU Se
nate. Their opinion was that
the senate was "unfair" in its
deliberations regarding the al
leged policy of "double bil
ling" at the Medical Center.
Simple justice requires a reply
to what was, in my opinion, a
gross misreading of the issue at
hand, a complete ignoring of
the facts, and blatantly "un
fair" process of decision
making on the part of the Daily
itself.
First of all, the issue was not
whether the Medical Center
should be condemned by the
senate or any other legislative
body. It is the Daily's peroga
tive, their right, indeed their
duty, as members of the fourth
estate — the free press — to
openly criticize political, so
cial, economic or any other ac
tions they deem appropriate.
To criticize an action is one
thing; however, to accuse a
legislation body of being unfair
in its deliberations is another,
with far reaching and more
profound implications.
If the Daily chose to question
the senate's decision-making
process, they should have
carefully examined the facts
and researched the specific ac
tions surrounding the issue.
After reading, with much
surprise, the Daily's editorial
("Time for fairness," Daily, Jan.
10) accusing the senate of hav
ing "unfairly," through our
"know-it-all" attitude, and
one-sided analysis decided our
policy, I immediately con
tacted members of the edito
rial board and asked them if
they had known:
— that the resolution was
submitted to the senate over
2Vj months ago;
— that it was open for dis
cussion at three separate regu
lar senate meetings;
— that it was sent to the
Academic Affairs Committee
where it was discussed on
three occasions, at least one
time as the major piece of legis
lation before the committee;
— that the first person ques
tioned on the issue by the se
nate was a representative of
the so-called "other side" —
President Richard Lyman;
— that Sen. Geoff Baskir, act
ing under the authorization of
the senate chairperson, tried
several times over a two-month
period to get representatives
of "both sides" to address the
senate; and
— that Academic Affairs
Committee Chairperson Erik
Thompson, acting under the
authorization of his committee
met with Medical School ad
ministrators, including Acting
Dean Lawrence Crowley, seek
ing information regarding their
"side" of the "double billing"
controversy.
The answer to each question
was an unequivocal no.
Indeed, I was later informed,
the only information the Daily
editorial board acted upon was
. a brief story that appeared in
their own newspaper describ
ing the events of the one se
nate meeting where the final
senate position was taken.
They ignored 2Vi months of
earlier debate and discussion.
Baskir, Thompson and I later

met with the editorial board to
explainwhat really did happen.
Again, to my surprise, the Daily
chose to ignore the facts and to
rather save face by staying with
the main thrust of its original
position (Daily, Jan. 15).
In this light, one must begin
to question the deliberations
of the Daily editorial board it
self. Aside from a basic ignor
ance of the facts, were any
members of the "other side"
regarding the Daily's decision
contacted before publication
of the editorial? Was the
Academic Affairs Committee
chairperson contacted? Were
either of the two co-authors of
the resolution contacted?
Were any questions addressed
to the senate chairperson
about the senate's research on
the issue between regular and
committee meetings?
Again, the answer to each
was an unequivocal no.
Perhaps, the Daily would do
well to heed their own sugges
tion and listen fairly to both
sides.
As to the senate's delibera
tions — the facts, well pre
sented, would allow the stu
dent body, faculty and ad
ministration to decide for
themselves as to the "fairness"
we employed. To this I must
add that for the first time in the
recent history of the ASSU, the
6enate steering committees
(rules, finance and academic
affairs) are meeting on a regu
lar, biweekly basis. Ninety per
cent of all legislation goes to
these open, publicized com
mittee meetings where they
are freely discussed and infor
mation is gathered before pre

sentation to the general ses
sions of the senate.
In addition, each senator
and alternate has been as
signed a residential or de
partmental district where they
can meet with their con
stituents and discuss such is
sues as "doublebilling." In this
particular case, ample oppor
tunity was given for debate
among any senators, students,
faculty or administrators con
cerned with the Medical
School policy.
All meetings of the whole
senate, the senate steering
committees, and residential or
departmental discussion
groups are open and well
publicized. All interested par
ties are encouraged to come
voice their viewson the legisla
tion before us.
In spite of all this, the Daily
accused the senate of being
"unfair" — which by definition
implies that we were biased,
unjust, and failed to consult
both sides of the issue. Such
was clearly not the case, and
thus an apology from the
editorial board on behalf of the
Daily is in order.
The senate has made, does
and will continue to make
every and all effort to be fair in
its deliberations, to consult
openly and thoroughly both
sides of the issues before us, so
that we might be a more rep
resentative and just forum of
student and community con
cerns. It is our hope that in the
future the Daily will do the
same.

where it was discussed on
three occasions, at least one
time as the major piece of legis
lation before the committee;
— that the first person ques
tioned on the issue by the se
nate was a representative of
the so-called "other side" —
President Richard Lyman;
— that Sen. Geoff Baskir, act
ing under the authorization of
the senate chairperson, tried
several times over a two-month
period to get representatives
of "both sides" to address the
senate; and
— that Academic Affairs
Committee Chairperson Erik
Thompson, acting under the
authorization of his committee
met with Medical School ad
ministrators, including Acting
Dean Lawrence Crowley, seek
ing information regarding their
"side" of the "double billing"
controversy.
The answer to each question
was an unequivocal no.
Indeed, I was later informed,
the only information the Daily
editorial board acted upon was
. a brief story that appeared in
their own newspaper describ
ing the events of the one se
nate meeting where the final
senate position was taken.
They ignored 2Vi months of
earlier debate and discussion.
Baskir, Thompson and I later

met with the editorial board to
explainwhat really did happen.
Again, to my surprise, the Daily
chose to ignore the facts and to
rather save face by staying with
the main thrust of its original
position (Daily, Jan. 15).
In this light, one must begin
to question the deliberations
of the Daily editorial board it
self. Aside from a basic ignor
ance of the facts, were any
members of the "other side"
regarding the Daily's decision
contacted before publication
of the editorial? Was the
Academic Affairs Committee
chairperson contacted? Were
either of the two co-authors of
the resolution contacted?
Were any questions addressed
to the senate chairperson
about the senate's research on
the issue between regular and
committee meetings?
Again, the answer to each
was an unequivocal no.
Perhaps, the Daily would do
well to heed their own sugges
tion and listen fairly to both
sides.
As to the senate's delibera
tions — the facts, well pre
sented, would allow the stu
dent body, faculty and ad
ministration to decide for
themselves as to the "fairness"
we employed. To this I must
add that for the first time in the
recent history of the ASSU, the
6enate steering committees
(rules, finance and academic
affairs) are meeting on a regu
lar, biweekly basis. Ninety per
cent of all legislation goes to
these open, publicized com
mittee meetings where they
are freely discussed and infor
mation is gathered before pre

sentation to the general ses
sions of the senate.
In addition, each senator
and alternate has been as
signed a residential or de
partmental district where they
can meet with their con
stituents and discuss such is
sues as "doublebilling." In this
particular case, ample oppor
tunity was given for debate
among any senators, students,
faculty or administrators con
cerned with the Medical
School policy.
All meetings of the whole
senate, the senate steering
committees, and residential or
departmental discussion
groups are open and well
publicized. All interested par
ties are encouraged to come
voice their viewson the legisla
tion before us.
In spite of all this, the Daily
accused the senate of being
"unfair" — which by definition
implies that we were biased,
unjust, and failed to consult
both sides of the issue. Such
was clearly not the case, and
thus an apology from the
editorial board on behalf of the
Daily is in order.
The senate has made, does
and will continue to make
every and all effort to be fair in
its deliberations, to consult
openly and thoroughly both
sides of the issues before us, so
that we might be a more rep
resentative and just forum of
student and community con
cerns. It is our hope that in the
future the Daily will do the
same.

Two weeks ago the Daily
editorial board decided to
issue a statement of condem
nation against the ASSU Se
nate. Their opinion was that
the senate was "unfair" in its
deliberations regarding the al
leged policy of "double bil
ling" at the Medical Center.
Simple justice requires a reply
to what was, in my opinion, a
gross misreading of the issue at
hand, a complete ignoring of
the facts, and blatantly "un
fair" process of decision
making on the part of the Daily
itself.
First of all, the issue was not
whether the Medical Center
should be condemned by the
senate or any other legislative
body. It is the Daily's peroga
tive, their right, indeed their
duty, as members of the fourth
estate — the free press — to
openly criticize political, so
cial, economic or any other ac
tions they deem appropriate.
To criticize an action is one
thing; however, to accuse a
legislation body of being unfair
in its deliberations is another,
with far reaching and more
profound implications.
If the Daily chose to question
the senate's decision-making
process, they should have
carefully examined the facts
and researched the specific ac
tions surrounding the issue.
After reading, with much
surprise, the Daily's editorial
("Time for fairness," Daily, Jan.
10) accusing the senate of hav
ing "unfairly," through our
"know-it-all" attitude, and
one-sided analysis decided our
policy, I immediately con
tacted members of the edito
rial board and asked them if
they had known:
— that the resolution was
submitted to the senate over
2Vj months ago;
— that it was open for dis
cussion at three separate regu
lar senate meetings;
— that it was sent to the
Academic Affairs Committee
where it was discussed on
three occasions, at least one
time as the major piece of legis
lation before the committee;
— that the first person ques
tioned on the issue by the se
nate was a representative of
