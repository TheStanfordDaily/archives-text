1M Sembene has made an historical film that i
I serves as a timeless allegory. In his clear, 7
1 spare style, he depicts the clash between I
French colonialists and a mystical African I
tribe in the closing days of World War II. s
_ Interestingly, it is the women of the village
who provide the true voice of resistance,
Irirai a voice that has nothing to do with the
[] ■ juSjf current notion of women's liberation and
* everything to do with the instinctual know
ledge of how to survive. The myth, ritual,
and history of this Senegalese tribe are |
iwfc'M hauntingly visualized.
