One day, Leland Stanford Sr and his family were
given a lour ol Washington by the President
Never one to be oul-done, Leland asked the
three what each would most like in all the world
Mrs Stanlord requested diamonds, so Leland
invested in So Africa and thus provided her with
a never ending parade of the glittering iewels
The President "requested a united country so Le
land built him the transcontinental railroad Little
Leland requested a Mickey Mouse outfit Walt
