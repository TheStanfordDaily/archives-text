# Laborers' rights need protection, prof says
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
The time has come to develop
international standards to protect
the basic human rights of labor
ers, Law School Prof. William
Gould told the First South African
International Conference on
Human Rights at the University of
Cape Town yesterday.
Gould said that South Africa,
because of "its inhumane apar
theid policies," will likely become
fhe "frontier" for developing
such standards.
He urged that the United States
impose a legally binding code of
conduct on American multina
tionals doing business in South
Africa. Calling such a code the
"next logical and moral step for
ward," he added it would be
"admirably suited" to President
|immy Carter's policy of retaining
American investments in the
country, without approving its
government's racial policy.
Activism contributes
Stanford owns stock in several
corporations doing business in
South Africa. These holdings have
been a matter of great concern to
many students here over the last
few years. Gould pointed to such
student activism, both here and at
othercampuses across the nation,
as, contributing "toward the
evolution of international labor
standards both generally and as
they relate to South Africa."
Gould told his audience that the
rights of laborers is not only a sub
ject that has been given insuffi
cient attention, but one that must
be dealt with on an international
scale.
Some of the rights mentioned
by Gould were freedom of associ
ation, protection of the right to
organize and of collective bar
gaining, and protection against
discrimination and forced labor.
Unions lacking
"What is lacking here in South
Africa are trade unions represent
ing the racially exploited (and for
that matter all workers) which
have the political and economic
muscle to make demands on gov

eminent and employers about un
fair labor conditions. Until there
are free labor organizations, ef
forts directed at other labor prob
lems will fail."
Presently, American corpora
tions doing business abroad are
guided by the voluntary standards
of the Sullivan principles of fair
employment practices, created by
and named for a past director of
General Motors.
Could said the "Sullivan princi
ples are not enough" and called
for the Carter administration and
Congress to impose a more com
prehensive standard that is legally
binding on multinationals char
tered in the United States.
Such standards must eventually
be applied by all countries, Gould
said, for otherwise, companies
"will always be lured to states and
areas which are without basic
standards." â€¢
International standards
There are three reasons the
time for such international stan
dards has come, Gould said. The
first is the compromise needed
between the industrialized na
tions' desire to protect their labor
forces and reduce unemployment
by setting up trade barriers and
the developing countries' need
for unbridled international com
merce.
The second reason is the appa
rent willingness of national labor
unions in many countries to stage
boycotts of those goods coming
from countries with unfair labor
practices, according to Gould.
The third reason is the situation
in South Africa, according to
Gould, which makes it imperative
to find a viable solution.
He called the situation there
"discouraging," but said the West
can play a role in the solution by
applying ' pressure rather than
public relations.'
He expressed hope that a
peaceful solution can still be
reached, saying, "Perhaps it is yet
possible for proponents of racial
equality to dare dream the impos
sible dream. At least you must
try."
