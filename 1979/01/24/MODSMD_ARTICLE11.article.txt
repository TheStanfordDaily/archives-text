# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## David Miller Balance the budget 
### 
In his inaugural speech two
weeks ago, California Gov.
Jerry Brown declared his sup
port for a constitutional
amendment requiring a ba
lanced federal budget.
Brown's action was rather
obviously a first move in the
1980 Presidential competition.
However, the proposal de
serves to be judged on its own
merits without regard to one's
personal opinions of Brown.
Although the balanced
budget proposal is not the
panacea that some of its prop
onents suggest, it is fundamen
tally a sound idea.
A federal budget deficit is
not a direct cause of inflation;
inflation is caused by an expan
sion of the money supply.
However, a large deficit, by
causing a tightening in the cap
ital market, can encourage the
Fed to expand the money sup
ply more rapidly and can
thereby indirectly add to the
rate of inflation. A balanced
budget requirement would
therefore help in reducing the
rate of inflation.
Furthermore, our rulers are
currently able to partially fi
nance many of their pet prog
rams via the "hidden taxation"
of inflation and federal inde
btedness. With a balanced
budget, federal revenues
would have to be obtained
through open taxation, and the
true cost of federal programs
would then be more obvious to
the American people. A
balanced-budget requirement
would therefore increase the
accountability and fiscal hon
esty of the federal govern
ment.
The most common objection
to a balanced-budget amend
ment is that it would destroy
the government's ability to
stabilize the economy through
discretionary fiscal policy (e.g.,
by running a deficit during a
depression). That argument is
a specious one, founded in a
nostalgia for the discredited
economics of Keynesianism.
Unemployment, inflation,
recession and economic stag
nation are not due, as Keyne
sians maintain, to a failure of
government to control "aggre
gate demand." The real causes
of these problems lie in institu
tional flaws in our economic
political system: e.g., the fed
eral government's ability to
expand the money supply, the

capriciousness and unpredic
tability of federal fiscal and
monetary policy, irrational and
arbitrary regulations and con
trols, an intolerable level of ta
xation, grants of special
privilege to certain sectors of
business and labor, etc.
Far from being a factor for
stabilization, the federal gov
ernment is the primary agency
of destabilization in the
economy.
Keynesian "fine-tuning" of
the economy has been tried; it
does not work. Instead of argu
ing against a balanced budget,
liberal Keynesians should have
the courage to face up to the
real causes of our economic
malaise.
It is unlikely that Congress
will propose a constitutional
amendment requiring a ba
lanced budget. The only alter
native means of proposing an
amendment is through a con
stitutional convention called
by the legislatures of two
thirds of the states. Twenty
two legislatures have already
called for such a convention in
order to propose a balanced
budget amendment; only 12
more states are needed.
Once called, a constitutional
convention probably could not
be limited to its original pur
pose. For that reason, many
persons — including promi
nent conservative pundits such
as George Will and J. Kilpatrick
— have opposed the calling of
such a convention.
Their fears are groundless.
Anything proposed by the
convention would have to be
ratified by three-fourths of the
states in order to be adopted
into the Constitution.
Furthermore, the Constitu
tion is not graven in stone; the
men who wrote it were not
gods. The Constitution was
largely the product of political
compromise, logrolling, and
expediency. There are many
possible changes in the Con
stitution which would improve
it.
The truth is that a constitu
tional convention would al
most certainly be overly timid
and restrained. The idea that
such a convention would en
danger American liberties is
nonsense; it is rather when
Congress is in session that
people should be fearful for
their lives, liberties and poc
ketbooks.

Requiring a balanced budget
is only a first step in the Ameri
can people's regaining control
of the federal government.
Even more important — both
for the U.S. economy and for
individual liberty — is a drastic
slashing of federal taxation and
spending.
However, a balanced
budget amendment is a good
beginning toward the neces
sary radical reconstruction of
our political-economic system.
It deserves the unqualified
support of the American
people.

In his inaugural speech two
weeks ago, California Gov.
Jerry Brown declared his sup
port for a constitutional
amendment requiring a ba
lanced federal budget.
Brown's action was rather
obviously a first move in the
1980 Presidential competition.
However, the proposal de
serves to be judged on its own
merits without regard to one's
personal opinions of Brown.
Although the balanced
budget proposal is not the
panacea that some of its prop
onents suggest, it is fundamen
tally a sound idea.
A federal budget deficit is
not a direct cause of inflation;
inflation is caused by an expan
sion of the money supply.
However, a large deficit, by
causing a tightening in the cap
ital market, can encourage the
Fed to expand the money sup
ply more rapidly and can
thereby indirectly add to the
rate of inflation. A balanced
budget requirement would
therefore help in reducing the
rate of inflation.
Furthermore, our rulers are
currently able to partially fi
nance many of their pet prog
rams via the "hidden taxation"
of inflation and federal inde
btedness. With a balanced
budget, federal revenues
would have to be obtained
through open taxation, and the
true cost of federal programs
would then be more obvious to
the American people. A
balanced-budget requirement
would therefore increase the
accountability and fiscal hon
esty of the federal govern
ment.
The most common objection
to a balanced-budget amend
ment is that it would destroy
the government's ability to
stabilize the economy through
discretionary fiscal policy (e.g.,
by running a deficit during a
depression). That argument is
a specious one, founded in a
nostalgia for the discredited
economics of Keynesianism.
Unemployment, inflation,
recession and economic stag
nation are not due, as Keyne
sians maintain, to a failure of
government to control "aggre
gate demand." The real causes
of these problems lie in institu
tional flaws in our economic
political system: e.g., the fed
eral government's ability to
expand the money supply, the

capriciousness and unpredic
tability of federal fiscal and
monetary policy, irrational and
arbitrary regulations and con
trols, an intolerable level of ta
xation, grants of special
privilege to certain sectors of
business and labor, etc.
Far from being a factor for
stabilization, the federal gov
ernment is the primary agency
of destabilization in the
economy.
Keynesian "fine-tuning" of
the economy has been tried; it
does not work. Instead of argu
ing against a balanced budget,
liberal Keynesians should have
the courage to face up to the
real causes of our economic
malaise.
It is unlikely that Congress
will propose a constitutional
amendment requiring a ba
lanced budget. The only alter
native means of proposing an
amendment is through a con
stitutional convention called
by the legislatures of two
thirds of the states. Twenty
two legislatures have already
called for such a convention in
order to propose a balanced
budget amendment; only 12
more states are needed.
Once called, a constitutional
convention probably could not
be limited to its original pur
pose. For that reason, many
persons — including promi
nent conservative pundits such
as George Will and J. Kilpatrick
— have opposed the calling of
such a convention.
Their fears are groundless.
Anything proposed by the
convention would have to be
ratified by three-fourths of the
states in order to be adopted
into the Constitution.
Furthermore, the Constitu
tion is not graven in stone; the
men who wrote it were not
gods. The Constitution was
largely the product of political
compromise, logrolling, and
expediency. There are many
possible changes in the Con
stitution which would improve
