## President Carter's China time bomb 
### 
President Jimmy Carter's China pac
kage was delivered to us as if it were a
surprise Christmas present. He ex
pected us, holding our breath, to un
wrap the beautiful package over the
holidays and admire its content in exul
tation. But having unwrapped it, I
found instead a bomb, a time bomb,
that is.
It was reported that upon receiving
the final imprimatur from Peking, Car
ter gave Zbigniew Brzezinski a look of
gratitude and serenely uttered: "Good
deal." Unfortunately, I have to suppose
he was sincere. Unfortunately — be
cause this sincer ty presupposes a good
deal of naivete. Had he thought of the
deal as a calculated geopolitical risk, I
would probably not be writing this arti
cle.
Though I do not oppose a de facto
recognition of the Peking regime and
do see the need of a limited coopera
tion with it for a prevention of Soviet
"hegemony," I believe we made haste
in bargaining. Whereas they got just
about everything they waited for, we
dragged our feet for seven years only to
accede to their original position and
exchange the bird in the hand for a
hundred in the bush. We now must
tread in the hush with extra caution lest
it turn into an ambush.
The bird in the hand is Taiwan. It has
been our trusted friend and firm ally. As
a showcase of the dynamism of free
enterprise it has been a living reproach
to the miserable failure of the com
munists to create a modern, strong and
prosperous China. It has been a source
of pride to those Chinese on the main
land and elsewhere who are looking for

alternatives to communism.
By consenting to the original Peking
demand to renounce our defense tre
aty with Taiwan we didn't simply leave
the bird bereft of our protection. No,
we found a legal way to put it into the
communists' cage. We did so by yield
ing to their other original demand, that
we recognize them as "the sole legal
government of China," including
Taiwan. It is only "within this context,"
the joint communique says, that "the
people of the U.S. will maintain cul
tural, commercial and other unofficial
relations with the people of Taiwan."
Thus, from now on our relations with
Taiwan will exist only at the mercy of
Peking. It will probably tolerate them
for a while. But, as soon as Peking feels
strong enough, it will simply order the
U.S. "hands off," and we will have no
basis in international law to disobey.
Lest one doubt that Peking will be
come strong enough to overrun
Taiwan, other provisions of the pac
kage deal make sure it will — with U.S.
help, of course. This is the meaning of
the lure of trade with the mainland for
which our own "capitalist-roaders"
seem to have fallen with such elation.
They forget that what they were out for is
buta hundred birds in theendlessbush
of the treacherous mainland. They
forget that if Peking has learned any
thing from Moscow, it is the Leninist
tactics of choking capitalists with their
own rope.
As long as the Peking regime has a
total monopoly on foreign trade, the
odds are that our businessmen will be
played off against each other and we,
consumers, will suffer the consequ

ences of government-subsidized
trade in the tradition of the infamous
"wheat deal" with Moscow. Except that
this time it will involve the strategic and
military related technology. After all,
before we are allowed to begin the hunt
for the lucrative bird of the bush, it will
be necessary to part with something
else in our hand, namely, credits.
We are told that our concessions to
Peking are necessitated by higher
geopolitical considerations aimed at
"enhancing stability in Asia" and thus
"contributing to world peace." Those
are the code expressions for playing the
China card against the "hegemony" of
our arch-rival, the Soviet Union. Al
though the State Department has de
nied it, our foreign policy seems indeed
not far removed from a card game —
but with real stakes.
For one thing, it's very easy to over
play the China card. SALT or not SALT,
our deal with Peking will precipitate a
massive infusion of arms to China, if
not by us then by our allies. This will
most surely result in an acceleration ot
the arms race. Our argument that we
only increase China's defensive capa
bility will not work, for the Soviets are
more afraid of defensive weapons in
Peking's hands than of offensive
weapons in U.S. hands.
But even if we play the card right, the
likelihood is that while checking one
communist threat we will create
another one, still greater. What is
worse, given the precedent of the
Stalin-Hitler pact, we cannot entirely
discount the possibility that our
partners will suddenly turn the tables
on us and ambush us with the resusc'-

tated ghost of a Sino-Soviet alliance.
When unwrapped, Carter's China
bomb contains three messages behind
an outer covering of geopolitical spec il
lations.
One goes to the Chinese. While
abandoning the 17 million people of
Taiwan to the mercy o„f Peking — quite
in style with the Munich betrayal of
Czechoslovakia by Western democ
racies — we are in effect telling the mill
ions on the mainland that they deserve
no better than the present totalitarian
regime. Contrary to our professed c on
cern for human rights, we have confer
red the title of legitimacy on the regime
that has been denying them to the
largest nation on earth.
Another message goes to our friends
and allies. It reads: the strongest
democracy on earth can no longer be
relied on as a military partner. South
Korea and West Germany must now
shudder at the possibility of being ab
sorbed by their other halves, presuma
bly more legitimate than themselves.
Israel and the Philippines must contend
for the legitimacy with their terrorists.
And Japan must wonder why it is less
trusted to be armed than Rod China.
The third message goes to our sworn
enemies. It reads: Mao was right that
the source of power is in the barrel of a
gun. Our enemies now know that, once
legitimized, it they run out of gun pow
der, they can count on the U.S. to
"normalize" its delivery.

President Jimmy Carter's China pac
kage was delivered to us as if it were a
surprise Christmas present. He ex
pected us, holding our breath, to un
wrap the beautiful package over the
holidays and admire its content in exul
tation. But having unwrapped it, I
found instead a bomb, a time bomb,
that is.
It was reported that upon receiving
the final imprimatur from Peking, Car
ter gave Zbigniew Brzezinski a look of
gratitude and serenely uttered: "Good
deal." Unfortunately, I have to suppose
he was sincere. Unfortunately — be
cause this sincer ty presupposes a good
deal of naivete. Had he thought of the
deal as a calculated geopolitical risk, I
would probably not be writing this arti
cle.
Though I do not oppose a de facto
recognition of the Peking regime and
do see the need of a limited coopera
tion with it for a prevention of Soviet
"hegemony," I believe we made haste
in bargaining. Whereas they got just
about everything they waited for, we
dragged our feet for seven years only to
accede to their original position and
exchange the bird in the hand for a
hundred in the bush. We now must
tread in the hush with extra caution lest
it turn into an ambush.
The bird in the hand is Taiwan. It has
been our trusted friend and firm ally. As
a showcase of the dynamism of free
enterprise it has been a living reproach
to the miserable failure of the com
munists to create a modern, strong and
prosperous China. It has been a source
of pride to those Chinese on the main
land and elsewhere who are looking for

alternatives to communism.
By consenting to the original Peking
demand to renounce our defense tre
aty with Taiwan we didn't simply leave
the bird bereft of our protection. No,
we found a legal way to put it into the
communists' cage. We did so by yield
ing to their other original demand, that
we recognize them as "the sole legal
government of China," including
Taiwan. It is only "within this context,"
the joint communique says, that "the
people of the U.S. will maintain cul
tural, commercial and other unofficial
relations with the people of Taiwan."
Thus, from now on our relations with
Taiwan will exist only at the mercy of
Peking. It will probably tolerate them
for a while. But, as soon as Peking feels
strong enough, it will simply order the
U.S. "hands off," and we will have no
basis in international law to disobey.
Lest one doubt that Peking will be
come strong enough to overrun
Taiwan, other provisions of the pac
kage deal make sure it will — with U.S.
help, of course. This is the meaning of
the lure of trade with the mainland for
which our own "capitalist-roaders"
seem to have fallen with such elation.
They forget that what they were out for is
buta hundred birds in theendlessbush
of the treacherous mainland. They
forget that if Peking has learned any
thing from Moscow, it is the Leninist
tactics of choking capitalists with their
own rope.
As long as the Peking regime has a
total monopoly on foreign trade, the
odds are that our businessmen will be
played off against each other and we,
consumers, will suffer the consequ

ences of government-subsidized
trade in the tradition of the infamous
"wheat deal" with Moscow. Except that
this time it will involve the strategic and
military related technology. After all,
before we are allowed to begin the hunt
for the lucrative bird of the bush, it will
be necessary to part with something
else in our hand, namely, credits.
We are told that our concessions to
Peking are necessitated by higher
geopolitical considerations aimed at
"enhancing stability in Asia" and thus
"contributing to world peace." Those
are the code expressions for playing the
China card against the "hegemony" of
our arch-rival, the Soviet Union. Al
though the State Department has de
nied it, our foreign policy seems indeed
not far removed from a card game —
but with real stakes.
For one thing, it's very easy to over
play the China card. SALT or not SALT,
our deal with Peking will precipitate a
massive infusion of arms to China, if
not by us then by our allies. This will
most surely result in an acceleration ot
the arms race. Our argument that we
only increase China's defensive capa
bility will not work, for the Soviets are
more afraid of defensive weapons in
Peking's hands than of offensive
weapons in U.S. hands.
But even if we play the card right, the
likelihood is that while checking one
communist threat we will create
another one, still greater. What is
worse, given the precedent of the
Stalin-Hitler pact, we cannot entirely
discount the possibility that our
partners will suddenly turn the tables
on us and ambush us with the resusc'-

tated ghost of a Sino-Soviet alliance.
When unwrapped, Carter's China
bomb contains three messages behind
an outer covering of geopolitical spec il
lations.
One goes to the Chinese. While
abandoning the 17 million people of
Taiwan to the mercy o„f Peking — quite
in style with the Munich betrayal of
Czechoslovakia by Western democ
racies — we are in effect telling the mill
ions on the mainland that they deserve
no better than the present totalitarian
regime. Contrary to our professed c on
cern for human rights, we have confer
red the title of legitimacy on the regime
that has been denying them to the
largest nation on earth.
Another message goes to our friends
and allies. It reads: the strongest
democracy on earth can no longer be
relied on as a military partner. South
Korea and West Germany must now
shudder at the possibility of being ab
sorbed by their other halves, presuma
bly more legitimate than themselves.
Israel and the Philippines must contend
for the legitimacy with their terrorists.
And Japan must wonder why it is less
trusted to be armed than Rod China.
The third message goes to our sworn
enemies. It reads: Mao was right that
the source of power is in the barrel of a
gun. Our enemies now know that, once
legitimized, it they run out of gun pow
der, they can count on the U.S. to
"normalize" its delivery.
