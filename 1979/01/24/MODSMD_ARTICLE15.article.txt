## Sexism is not dead at Stanford 
### 
Sexism is a form of human
behavior and belief that runs
rampant throughout our soci
ety. And yet, at the University
and elsewhere people will
often dismiss any knowledge
about what is or is not sexist. In
addition, manv people who
might begin to understand
which attitudes or actions are
sexist often believe that the
"problem" has been solved
because a few women are now
able to become corporate
executives. Because there are
so many misconceptions about
sexism, I thought that I would
bring the issue "home" so to
speak.
I will take you on a tour of a
typical Stanford under
graduate's day and I will point
out some or the sexist be
haviors that go on in these hal
lowed halls. Although I am
sure that my conception of
sexism is not definitive —
especially since I am a man and
I do not bear the burden of
sexist oppression — I hope that
this tour will bring up discus
sion about sexism at the Uni
versity.
Our Stanford student wakes
up in the morning and hurries
out of bed so that he or she
might not miss the food ser
vices's extraordinary cuisine.
Most probably he orshe will be
served by a fellow student or
by a woman or Third World
man from the community. For,
the vast majority of low paid
service workers in the United
States — and at the University
— are women or Third World
men.
When figures are spouted to
demonstrate the incredible in
crease in the number of
employed women in our coun
try, it would be wise to deter
mine the type of work and the
kind of pay that these women
get. At the table in the
cafeteria, our student may sit
down to read the Daily while
gobbling down the gruel.
Unfortunately, as has been'
the case several times in this

volume of the Daily, Gil
Morales has taken his preroga
tive to portray women as ob
jects. This is done under the
rubric of "humor" that is sup
posed to characterize the car
toon strip "Dupie." However,
what kind of humor is it when
women helplessly swoon at the
image of "phallic" Hoover To
wer? And worse yet, what kind
of humor is it when Morales
has Dupie raping his sister's
Raggedy Ann doll?
Well, duty calls andourStan
ford student shuffles off to the
Quad to enjoy yet another lec
ture on the contributions of
"great men" to the history of
mankind. Academia has a spe
cial affinity for the "heights" of
culture that seem to have been
defined in terms that speak
only of the works of western
white men. Further, in another
class, our student may be lec
tured about the correct organi
zational behavior for this or
that executive, for this or that
worker. The professor seems
to ignore that a woman could
possibly hold these positions
in our society, for this profes
sor drones on and on about
how he does this or he does
that.
And stop and look at who
that professor is. The chances
are overwhelming that the pro
fessor is a man. And if, per
chance, she is not, then it will
be highly probable that within
the next four years that profes
sor will be denied tenure and
sent packing. It seems that she
was too interested in teaching
and not in publishing in the
journals that are controlled by
the "old boy" network of the
American intelligensia.
As the academic day comes
to a close, and our student de
cides to make a late night trip
to the biology library to do
somecrucial reserve reading, if
our student is a woman, she
may have to take every precau
tion to avoid the possibility of
violence aimed at her in the
shadows of the Quad. Or she

may decide that the reading
was not all that important. Our
woman Stanford student must
shape her life in a way that will
compensate for the violence of
a sexist society.
This little trip around the
University can only begin to
point out the sexist attitudes
and behaviors that charac
terize Stanford. These are blat
ant examples of the disease
that has many subtle manifes
tations. And we must not
forget to recognize that both
men and women at the Univer
sity are privileged individuals
in our society. Sexism may not
have the disastrous effects that

it might have on other people.
Take for example the woman
who must raise her four chil
dren as a single parent. The
opportunities that she may
have in getting work are li
mited. Usually the work is
degrading. And by recent es
timates the woman will be paid
a mere 57 percent of what a
man would earn for the same
work.
Further, if the ASSU Senate
can beany indication, a woman
might have "extra" duties to
perform that would not be in
cluded in her job description.
For at the last senate meeting,

the ASSU Senators requested
that the secretary fetch some
pizza and soft drinks tor the
senators while they continued
their important work.
No, sexism has not disap
peared from the Stanford cam
pus. Norwill it beeradicted un
less each of us takes it as his or
her responsibility to watch for
sexism in action, and then for
him or her to move to expose
and eliminate sexist practices
and beliefs.
