Act now
Is there any truth to the
rumor that the ASSU Senate,
recognizing a choice oppor
tunity to exercise its talent, is
preparing to offer a guest pro
fessorship to the Shah of Iran?
If so, I would recommend to
the senate to act now! The
shah may soon be taken, and
the senate needs plenty of time
for policy reversals. Swivel,
swivel. . . .

No rational solution
Following many years of
reading and occasional discus
sions about the so-called Mid
dle East problem, Arab-|ew re
lations and potential solutions,
I have reached the conclusion
that the subject cannot bear a
logical interpretation. Nor can
any possible denouncement to
the drama fit the regular norms
of solutions to international
problems.
This conclusion incidentally
is shared by a large number of
Jews, "Zionists," neutral and
anti-"Zionists." The inception
of Israel, based on an emo
tional principle to begin with,

accentuated by the horrors of
the holocaust and a centuries
old, justifiable, persecution
syndrome, has given Israel a
unique character.
It is the mentality of the
"state of siege" that prompted
the vicious ad hominem at
tacks by LeVine (Daily, |an. 16)
and Schwartz [Daily, |an. 18)
against David Miller as a result
of his column (Daily, Jan. 10).
The attacks, incidentally, viol
ated the rules of civilized de
bate. It is unnecessary to prove
Miller ignorant or anti-semitic
in order to oppose his view
point. (I do not feel it would be
an attempt towards censorship
if the Opinions Editors pointed
out to the writers before publi
cation some of their libel
bordering statements.)
In fact, Miller's analysis of Is
rael and his suggestions for
solution were brilliant. He
showed a good knowledge of
the subject and its peripheral
projections.
His attempt, though, and the
reactions it evoked are ample
proofs that where logic and
deep rooted emotions collide
so violently, no solution is pos
sible. We have to either aban
don logic as it has been the
case since the creation and
propagation of Israel, or cool

emotions, a feat of no insig
nificant proportions in this is
sue.

Spitz' comments
inappropriate
It is difficult not to be of
fended by the comments attri
buted to History Professor
Lewis Spitz in regard to advis
ers, in an article entitled "En
rollment increases in trial cul
ture series" (Daily, |an. 15).
As a first-time freshman ad
viser, I have lound the rewards
of the job commensurate with
myefforts. But it is unfortunate
that such derogatory and
thoughtless statements be
made by a prominent Univer
sity spokesman and that thev
be given such wide publicity.
Although I happen to agree
with Spitz' views on the need
for a required Western Culture
type of curriculum, his remarks
about dissenting advisors can
only serve to degrade the ad
vising function and to jeopar
dize the good will of all who are
affected by it.
