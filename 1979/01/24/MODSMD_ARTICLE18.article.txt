n,Mahoney graduated from
lino University in 1964. Unlike
many older adminstrators who
started out as secretaries,
Mahoney began her career in
a,n executive capacity. "Sal
ary is a measure of status in our
society," Mahoney said, look
ing around her large sunlit of
fice. "It's a recognition of your
professional worth."

leanne Martin, assistant pro
fessor of English, says that
many women still take jobs
where they can't support
themselves, believing that the
emotional rewards will make
up for the low pay.
"If the world pays you a sal
ary, it means that your work is
worth something," she says.
"No job that doesn't pay gives
you power."
Barbara Bolden, adminis
trator in the registrar's office,
agrees. "They can give you a
big title as a hospital volunteer,
but unless you're paid they
don't have to listen to you."
Registrar Mahoney believes
that wpmen working as volun
teers can also be viewed as pro
fessionals. She points to jane
Lyman, who has volunteered
her work on the Peninsula Fair
Housing Commission.
But such volunteer work is
rarely possibly in today's
economy, women here say.
Given an unlimited source of
income, most women said that
they would still work, but most
said that they would expect to
be paid. Women in lower
paying jobs were more likely to
opt for volunteer work in a
field that interested them. On
the other hand, women in
higher-paid administration and
faculty positions seemed to
view salary as an important as
pect of job satisfaction.
While several secretaries
said that they would like to take
time off work and pursue other
interests, from travel to art,
women in top-level university
positions said that they could
not conceive of remaining out
of the work force. The differ
ence, apparently, lies in being
well paid for what the women
wants to do.
Still, pay is not the major ad
vantage to working here, ac
cording to women at all salary
levels.
All the women interviewed
felt that working in a university
setting held intrinsic reward*.,
whether from intellectual
stimulation or simply a treer,
more relaxed atmosphere than
that of the business world.
Old Union staffer Bolden
feels that th<* University at

mosphere makes up for the
fact that she might be paid
more by working for a corpora
tion. Being in a two-salary mar
riage allows her to take advan
tage of 1 isses and events on
camp without having to
choov her job strictly on the
basis ol salary, she said.
Another important aspect of
working here, women felt, was
a greater sense of acceptance
by male colleagues. Leslie Day,
the first woman ever hired by
Plant Services here, found her
co-workers here more recep
tive than those she worked
with as a gardener for the City
of Palo Alto. "The men here
were really surprised and shy at
first," she recalled. "I felt that I
was being watched, though,
and that I had to constantly
prove myself."
Day feels that the scarcity of
women in her field has created
powerful bonds between
female co-workers. The Uni
versity has recently hired more
women to Plant Services, and
all of these women have a
strong sense of being models
for those who come after
them.
Still, the lack of role models
has created problems for some
women here. When she
finished her degree and began
teaching, Prof. Martin disco
vered that her model in college
had been a male literature pro
fessor, whose patriarchal bear
ing and resonant voice was dif
ficult for a woman in her 20s to
imitate.
"I didn't know any profes
sional women when I was
growing up," Martin said. "It
took a while to discover a
teaching style that fit who I
am."
According to Martin the lack
of role models in the working
world has created an additional
conflict for women as they plan
their careers.
"Men assume they will do
something," she said. "Wo
men say, Do I want to do
something?' and then they try
to discover what it is."
The women felt they were
perceived as role models by
undergraduate women here.
Many, such as Mahoney and

Martin, have spent increasing
amounts of time counseling
seniors who are hesitant about
which career path to follow.
Mahoney says the greatest dif
ference she sees between job
seeking men and women is
that women are more candid in
expressing uncertainties about
their capabilities. The number
of women in many professions
is limited to a few who are par
ticularly outstanding in their
field, she added.
"Women are certain they
have to be the very best at
whatever they do," Martin
said.
When women opt for both a
career and a family, they seem
to feel more ambiguous about
working than do single wo
men. They are more likely to
say that they would like not to
work for a while, to have time
to spend with their children
and husbands. They are more
likely to view working as a
source of needed income, no
matter how much they like
their jobs, than as a role which
is fulfilling by itself.
"I know I'm missing things
by taking my children to a day
care center," said Old Union
staffer Bolden.
Griselda Castro, activities
adviser for campus affairs,
admits that she feels torn bet
ween traditional Chicano val
ues which make the women
the center of the home and
family, and her own family's
need for two sources of in
come.
"It's hard to let my daughter
be raised partly by someone
else," she said. Castro said that
both her mother and grand
mother had worked all their
lives, so that she had strong
role models to follow on how
to balance working and
mothering.
Few women felt that their
mothers were examples of how
to integrate a career and a fam
ily. In fact, many said they were
raisingtheirown daughtersdif
ferently.
"Working was what you did
if you couldn't get married,"
recalls Bolden. "Mv girls know
that they are going to have to
work, no matter what. They go
to school with the idea that
they are going to have to do
well in order to make a good
living."
While many women with
families say that they have
taught their families to help
run the household, the burden
still falls unequally, they feel.
Torn between two respon
sibilities, women cannot al
ways approach their work in the
same way that men do.
"My view of success is quite
different from that of my hus
band," said career planner
Bernfield. "It involves how I
feel about a lot of different as
pects of my life."
Plant Services worker Day
said that there is an unspoken
attitude among men that
women are less serious about
their work or that they have al
ternatives to working full time.
"Perhaps I am less aggres
sive than a man who has to
support a family, but I do my
job just like anyone else," she

said.
Have the attitudes of women
towards their work really
changed as more oppor
tunities open up to them? A re
cent article in Working Woman
magazine slated that the work
habits and behavior patterns of
young women moving into
management positions are
very similar to those of their
male counterparts. These wo
men, the article asserts, are not
confusing the rewards of work
with those of home. The ques
tion remains whether such a
single-minded approach to
working will remain possible
throughout a woman's career,
as the "rewards of home"
evolve from a single apartment
to a home and family.

agrees. "They can give you a
big title as a hospital volunteer,
but unless you're paid they
don't have to listen to you."
Registrar Mahoney believes
that wpmen working as volun
teers can also be viewed as pro
fessionals. She points to jane
Lyman, who has volunteered
her work on the Peninsula Fair
Housing Commission.
But such volunteer work is
rarely possibly in today's
economy, women here say.
Given an unlimited source of
income, most women said that
they would still work, but most
said that they would expect to
be paid. Women in lower
paying jobs were more likely to
opt for volunteer work in a
field that interested them. On
the other hand, women in
higher-paid administration and
faculty positions seemed to
view salary as an important as
pect of job satisfaction.
While several secretaries
said that they would like to take
time off work and pursue other
interests, from travel to art,
women in top-level university
positions said that they could
not conceive of remaining out
of the work force. The differ
ence, apparently, lies in being
well paid for what the women
wants to do.
Still, pay is not the major ad
vantage to working here, ac
cording to women at all salary
levels.
All the women interviewed
felt that working in a university
setting held intrinsic reward*.,
whether from intellectual
stimulation or simply a treer,
more relaxed atmosphere than
that of the business world.
Old Union staffer Bolden
feels that th<* University at

mosphere makes up for the
fact that she might be paid
more by working for a corpora
tion. Being in a two-salary mar
riage allows her to take advan
tage of 1 isses and events on
camp without having to
choov her job strictly on the
basis ol salary, she said.
Another important aspect of
working here, women felt, was
a greater sense of acceptance
by male colleagues. Leslie Day,
the first woman ever hired by
Plant Services here, found her
co-workers here more recep
tive than those she worked
with as a gardener for the City
of Palo Alto. "The men here
were really surprised and shy at
first," she recalled. "I felt that I
was being watched, though,
and that I had to constantly
prove myself."
Day feels that the scarcity of
women in her field has created
powerful bonds between
female co-workers. The Uni
versity has recently hired more
women to Plant Services, and
all of these women have a
strong sense of being models
for those who come after
them.
Still, the lack of role models
has created problems for some
women here. When she
finished her degree and began
teaching, Prof. Martin disco
vered that her model in college
had been a male literature pro
fessor, whose patriarchal bear
ing and resonant voice was dif
ficult for a woman in her 20s to
imitate.
"I didn't know any profes
sional women when I was
growing up," Martin said. "It
took a while to discover a
teaching style that fit who I
am."
According to Martin the lack
of role models in the working
world has created an additional
conflict for women as they plan
their careers.
"Men assume they will do
something," she said. "Wo
men say, Do I want to do
something?' and then they try
to discover what it is."
The women felt they were
perceived as role models by
undergraduate women here.
Many, such as Mahoney and

Martin, have spent increasing
amounts of time counseling
seniors who are hesitant about
which career path to follow.
Mahoney says the greatest dif
ference she sees between job
seeking men and women is
that women are more candid in
expressing uncertainties about
their capabilities. The number
of women in many professions
is limited to a few who are par
ticularly outstanding in their
field, she added.
"Women are certain they
have to be the very best at
whatever they do," Martin
said.
When women opt for both a
career and a family, they seem
to feel more ambiguous about
working than do single wo
men. They are more likely to
say that they would like not to
work for a while, to have time
to spend with their children
and husbands. They are more
likely to view working as a
source of needed income, no
matter how much they like
their jobs, than as a role which
is fulfilling by itself.
"I know I'm missing things
by taking my children to a day
care center," said Old Union
staffer Bolden.
Griselda Castro, activities
adviser for campus affairs,
admits that she feels torn bet
ween traditional Chicano val
ues which make the women
the center of the home and
family, and her own family's
need for two sources of in
come.
"It's hard to let my daughter
be raised partly by someone
else," she said. Castro said that
both her mother and grand
mother had worked all their
lives, so that she had strong
role models to follow on how
to balance working and
mothering.
Few women felt that their
mothers were examples of how
to integrate a career and a fam
ily. In fact, many said they were
raisingtheirown daughtersdif
ferently.
"Working was what you did
if you couldn't get married,"
recalls Bolden. "Mv girls know
that they are going to have to
work, no matter what. They go
to school with the idea that
they are going to have to do
well in order to make a good
living."
While many women with
families say that they have
taught their families to help
run the household, the burden
still falls unequally, they feel.
Torn between two respon
sibilities, women cannot al
ways approach their work in the
same way that men do.
"My view of success is quite
different from that of my hus
band," said career planner
Bernfield. "It involves how I
feel about a lot of different as
pects of my life."
Plant Services worker Day
said that there is an unspoken
attitude among men that
women are less serious about
their work or that they have al
ternatives to working full time.
"Perhaps I am less aggres
sive than a man who has to
support a family, but I do my
job just like anyone else," she

said.
Have the attitudes of women
towards their work really
changed as more oppor
tunities open up to them? A re
cent article in Working Woman
magazine slated that the work
habits and behavior patterns of
young women moving into
management positions are
very similar to those of their
male counterparts. These wo
men, the article asserts, are not
confusing the rewards of work
with those of home. The ques
tion remains whether such a
single-minded approach to
working will remain possible
throughout a woman's career,
as the "rewards of home"
evolve from a single apartment
to a home and family.

strong sense of being models
for those who come after
them.
Still, the lack of role models
has created problems for some
women here. When she
finished her degree and began
teaching, Prof. Martin disco
vered that her model in college
had been a male literature pro
fessor, whose patriarchal bear
ing and resonant voice was dif
ficult for a woman in her 20s to
imitate.
"I didn't know any profes
sional women when I was
growing up," Martin said. "It
took a while to discover a
teaching style that fit who I
am."
According to Martin the lack
of role models in the working
world has created an additional
conflict for women as they plan
their careers.
"Men assume they will do
something," she said. "Wo
men say, Do I want to do
something?' and then they try
to discover what it is."
The women felt they were
perceived as role models by
undergraduate women here.
Many, such as Mahoney and

Martin, have spent increasing
amounts of time counseling
seniors who are hesitant about
which career path to follow.
Mahoney says the greatest dif
ference she sees between job
seeking men and women is
that women are more candid in
expressing uncertainties about
their capabilities. The number
of women in many professions
is limited to a few who are par
ticularly outstanding in their
field, she added.
"Women are certain they
have to be the very best at
whatever they do," Martin
said.
When women opt for both a
career and a family, they seem
to feel more ambiguous about
working than do single wo
men. They are more likely to
say that they would like not to
work for a while, to have time
to spend with their children
and husbands. They are more
likely to view working as a
source of needed income, no
matter how much they like
their jobs, than as a role which
is fulfilling by itself.
"I know I'm missing things
by taking my children to a day
care center," said Old Union
staffer Bolden.
Griselda Castro, activities
adviser for campus affairs,
admits that she feels torn bet
ween traditional Chicano val
ues which make the women
the center of the home and
family, and her own family's
need for two sources of in
come.
"It's hard to let my daughter
be raised partly by someone
else," she said. Castro said that
both her mother and grand
mother had worked all their
lives, so that she had strong
role models to follow on how
to balance working and
mothering.
Few women felt that their
mothers were examples of how
to integrate a career and a fam
ily. In fact, many said they were
raisingtheirown daughtersdif
ferently.
"Working was what you did
if you couldn't get married,"
recalls Bolden. "Mv girls know
that they are going to have to
work, no matter what. They go
to school with the idea that
they are going to have to do
well in order to make a good
living."
While many women with
families say that they have
taught their families to help
run the household, the burden
still falls unequally, they feel.
Torn between two respon
sibilities, women cannot al
ways approach their work in the
same way that men do.
"My view of success is quite
different from that of my hus
band," said career planner
Bernfield. "It involves how I
feel about a lot of different as
pects of my life."
Plant Services worker Day
said that there is an unspoken
attitude among men that
women are less serious about
their work or that they have al
ternatives to working full time.
"Perhaps I am less aggres
sive than a man who has to
support a family, but I do my
job just like anyone else," she

said.
Have the attitudes of women
towards their work really
changed as more oppor
tunities open up to them? A re
cent article in Working Woman
magazine slated that the work
habits and behavior patterns of
young women moving into
management positions are
very similar to those of their
male counterparts. These wo
men, the article asserts, are not
confusing the rewards of work
with those of home. The ques
tion remains whether such a
single-minded approach to
working will remain possible
throughout a woman's career,
as the "rewards of home"
evolve from a single apartment
to a home and family.

ity changed their attitudes to

positions discussed work ex
periences here.

n,Mahoney graduated from
lino University in 1964. Unlike
many older adminstrators who
started out as secretaries,
Mahoney began her career in
a,n executive capacity. "Sal
ary is a measure of status in our
society," Mahoney said, look
ing around her large sunlit of
fice. "It's a recognition of your
professional worth."

leanne Martin, assistant pro
fessor of English, says that
many women still take jobs
where they can't support
themselves, believing that the
emotional rewards will make
up for the low pay.
"If the world pays you a sal
ary, it means that your work is
worth something," she says.
"No job that doesn't pay gives
you power."
Barbara Bolden, adminis
trator in the registrar's office,
agrees. "They can give you a
big title as a hospital volunteer,
but unless you're paid they
don't have to listen to you."
Registrar Mahoney believes
that wpmen working as volun
teers can also be viewed as pro
fessionals. She points to jane
Lyman, who has volunteered
her work on the Peninsula Fair
Housing Commission.
But such volunteer work is
rarely possibly in today's
economy, women here say.
Given an unlimited source of
income, most women said that
they would still work, but most
said that they would expect to
be paid. Women in lower
paying jobs were more likely to
opt for volunteer work in a
field that interested them. On
the other hand, women in
higher-paid administration and
faculty positions seemed to
view salary as an important as
pect of job satisfaction.
While several secretaries
said that they would like to take
time off work and pursue other
interests, from travel to art,
women in top-level university
positions said that they could
not conceive of remaining out
of the work force. The differ
ence, apparently, lies in being
well paid for what the women
wants to do.
Still, pay is not the major ad
vantage to working here, ac
cording to women at all salary
levels.
All the women interviewed
felt that working in a university
setting held intrinsic reward*.,
whether from intellectual
stimulation or simply a treer,
more relaxed atmosphere than
that of the business world.
Old Union staffer Bolden
feels that th<* University at

mosphere makes up for the
fact that she might be paid
more by working for a corpora
tion. Being in a two-salary mar
riage allows her to take advan
tage of 1 isses and events on
camp without having to
choov her job strictly on the
basis ol salary, she said.
Another important aspect of
working here, women felt, was
a greater sense of acceptance
by male colleagues. Leslie Day,
the first woman ever hired by
Plant Services here, found her
co-workers here more recep
tive than those she worked
with as a gardener for the City
of Palo Alto. "The men here
were really surprised and shy at
first," she recalled. "I felt that I
was being watched, though,
and that I had to constantly
prove myself."
Day feels that the scarcity of
women in her field has created
powerful bonds between
female co-workers. The Uni
versity has recently hired more
women to Plant Services, and
all of these women have a
strong sense of being models
for those who come after
them.
Still, the lack of role models
has created problems for some
women here. When she
