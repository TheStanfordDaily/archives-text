# Another look at the ERB report— what now?

### SAMUEL HOWE Last ot two parts 
In the ASSU Senate elections last
year, a number of candidates, includ
ing 16 of 20 elected undergraduates
and six of 20 graduates, were charged
with breaking campaign laws. The in
fractions ranged from illegal distribu
tion of campaign literature to ex
ceeding the $50 campaign spending
limit.
As a result of the controversy, the
LRB was formed to look into the
charges and empowered to make
decisions on campaign violations,
following their actions concerning
individual senators-elect, the ERB
broadened its scope and worked all
year to produce the report complete
with proposals for overall senate re
form.
Two of the elected undergraduate
senators were completely absolved,
while the majority were let off with
eithera reprimand ora censure. Two
senators-elect, the second and third
highest vote getters, were disqual
ified.
A number of those reprimanded
were on the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC) slate, who de
scribed themselves as "a coalition of

Stanford's minority, women's and
progressive groups." All six of the
reprimanded graduate senators were
from the SOC slate.
SOC criticized
The SOC slate was criticized in an
anonymous leaflet on the eve of the
election. The leaflet called the slate
radical and unrepresentative of Uni
versity students' needs. "Their
(SOC's) attempts to have a veto
proof, rubber-stamp senate for pet
left-wing political causes spells
danger for responsible student poli
tics," the flyer said.
The next day, a new leaflet illegally
stuffed in the Daily was distributed
throughout campus. It supported
the SOC slate and charged one of the
"conservative" students with dis
tributing a "leaflet full of out-and-out
lies." Those involved with both
anonymous leaflets were not iden
tified until after the election.
The two leaflets were the subject
of bitterness during the ERB delibera
tions. The major question of the in
vestigation revolved around which
candidates knew of the anonymous
leaflets before they were printed and
the extent of their involvement, )en

nings said.
All members of the SOC slate were
cited for failure to cooperate either
with the ERB or Elections Commis
sioner Sean Murphy, but none were
disqualified, he said.
Dan Livingston, disqualified on
charges of exceeding the campaign
spending limit and of involvement
with the anonymous leaflet attacking
SOC, said he doubted that the whole
controversy had much effect on
either this year's election or this
year's senate.
Livingston said "most students are
just disgusted at the way the ERB
turned out — the disparity of results,
the strange way in which they de
cided the cases. It was a circus in the
name of a public investigation."
Limit questioned
Livingston called the $50 limit "un
realistic," although he said it might
be feasible if a district system were
adopted. He said the limit also un
fairly favored a large slate of candi
dates, who can easily and more effec
tively pool their resources.
Fred Crethel, last year's senate
chairperson and a member of the
SOC slate, said that the effects of last

year's controversy on this year's elec
tion were "to make student govern
ment more cautious and to dull the
campaign." He called this year's se
nate "incredibly dull and defensive,
and therefore inclined to non
action."
Crethel opposed
Crethel is opposed to the district
ing plan because of "the homogene
ous nature of Stanford. We would
see a white, upper-class male elected
all the time," under this system and
little representation of eitherwomen
or minorities, he said.
Sfamosdisagreed withCrethel and
said that "in fact, minorities would
have a better chance in a smaller en
vironment, having the chance to re
ally show their merits as opposed to
just bombarding the campus with
signs. Districts would be small
enough to talk to every individual
person."
Jennings, meanwhile, in defend
ing his live peititon plan, said that
"minorities of interest, culture or
opinion cannot be expected to fare
well in a system dominated by local
majority rule." He said they could be
guaranteed better representation by
the live petition process.
