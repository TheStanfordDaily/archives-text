# Women make modest gains in biz world status recently

Los Angeles (AP) — Ask the
average male who heads a cor
poration about female execu
tives in his firm and he's likely
to recite the names of several
women who have taken on
prestigious titles in recent
years.
But most feminists believe
that if one can still count the
women who hold power in a
company, then there aren't
enough.
In the more than 10 years
since the feminist movement
began, women indeed have
"come a long way," as the
cigarette ads proclaim — espe
cially in California, which has
been at the forefront of the ef
fort.
But raised consciousness
and affirmative action prog
rams notwithstanding, many
women maintain that their
progress has not been what it
should be and in some cases,
not even as great as the public
has been led to believe.
"Most women are still in
low-paying, sex-segregated,
pink-collar jobs," asserts at
torney Gloria Allred, head of
the Los Angeles chapter of the
National Organization for
Women (NOW). "It's still
front-page news when a
woman is promoted in the
aerospace industry or enters
the cockpit of a plane."
The recent findings of an
inter-agency federal task force
ordered by President |immy
Carter to study the country's
female business owners were
similar to Allred's: "Women
are overrepresented in lower
paying jobs."
The report states that . .
the economic impact of . . .
systematic discrimination is
evident in the fact that, in 1976,
the median income of white
men employed full time was
$14,272; of black men, $10,222;
of white women, $8476 and of
black women, $7831."
One interesting finding in
the report was that "college
educated women have lower
incomes than men who have
completed only elementary
school."

NOW's Allred, whose legal
specialty is sex discrimination,
says there are so many such in
equities — both in hiring and
promotion — that government
agencies are now jammed with
sex discrimination suits.
"Some companies set up af
firmative action programs on
paper, but they don't back
them up in reality," she said.
"For example, they may give
a woman the title and not the
salary, or the salary and not the
title . . . The federal Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) does not
have the staff to deal with the
huge numbers of complaints."
Francisco Cancino, director
of the EEOC's Regional Litiga
tion Center in San Francisco,
agreed: "We're very busy. In
the last calendar year . . . we
had approximately 32 cases re
solved for about $5.5 million in
back pay. That's a great deal of
activity."
But he voiced guarded op
timism that sex barriers in the
business world are being bro
ken down. "I think things are
changing — but the material
for our lawsuits still exists."
One thing to keep in mind is
the large number of women
being discussed. Females, ac
cording to the latent census fi
gures, total 51.3 percent of the
country's population. At 109.4
million, they outnumber males
in the U.S. by 5.6 million.
Women in the labor force
number about 36 million com
pared with more than 57 mill
ion men. The Census Bureau
projects that, by 1980, those fi
gures should reflect even more
of a gap between employed
women and men: about 39
million women and more than
62 million men.
Women's business progress,
like that of the proverbial frog
jumping out of the well, has
been characterized as "two
hops forward and one hop
backward."
But in the area of banking —
where women traditionally
have been virtually invisible —
the analogy might go "one hop

forward and two hops hack
ward."
In three recent examples of
women-run financial institu
tions in southern California,
two have been failures and
only one, First Women's Bank
of California (FWBC), after a
year-long struggle, is a suc
cess.
FWBC now offers such
female-directed services as fi
nancial seminars for women
and extensive individual fiscal
counseling. "Being predomin
antly owned and managed by
women, we are unusually sen
sitive to women's financial
needs," says President Lynda
Fluent.
But can even these scattered
successes be considered true
accomplishments in the
feminist movement?
Many women executives feel
they will have genuine equality
only when they make it as
non-partisan businesspeople,
not as labeled and certified
feminists.
"A lot of people think this is a
cause, and it isn't," says one of
the FWBC directors. "It's a bus
iness."
On the opposite end of the
spectrum are women who feel
that when they make it to the
top, they must not forget their
female roots.
An example of sisterly cohe
siveness is a group called
Women in Business (WIB),
formed when several top
businesswomen decided they
needed continued support
from female colleagues in a
business world dominated by
males.
"We found that many
women in business were alien
ated, were loners," said Pat
Wyskocil, a spokeswoman for
the JOO-member WIB, which
began three years ago as an ex
tension of a UCLA seminar.

Women's business progress,
like that of the proverbial frog
jumping out of the well, has
been characterized as "two
hops forward and one hop
backward."
But in the area of banking —
where women traditionally
have been virtually invisible —
the analogy might go "one hop

forward and two hops hack
ward."
In three recent examples of
women-run financial institu
tions in southern California,
two have been failures and
only one, First Women's Bank
of California (FWBC), after a
year-long struggle, is a suc
cess.
FWBC now offers such
female-directed services as fi
nancial seminars for women
and extensive individual fiscal
counseling. "Being predomin
antly owned and managed by
women, we are unusually sen
sitive to women's financial
needs," says President Lynda
Fluent.
But can even these scattered
successes be considered true
accomplishments in the
feminist movement?
Many women executives feel
they will have genuine equality
only when they make it as
non-partisan businesspeople,
not as labeled and certified
feminists.
"A lot of people think this is a
cause, and it isn't," says one of
the FWBC directors. "It's a bus
iness."
On the opposite end of the
spectrum are women who feel
that when they make it to the
top, they must not forget their
female roots.
An example of sisterly cohe
siveness is a group called
Women in Business (WIB),
formed when several top
businesswomen decided they
needed continued support
from female colleagues in a
business world dominated by
males.
"We found that many
women in business were alien
ated, were loners," said Pat
Wyskocil, a spokeswoman for
the JOO-member WIB, which
began three years ago as an ex
tension of a UCLA seminar.
Los Angeles (AP) — Ask the
average male who heads a cor
poration about female execu
tives in his firm and he's likely
to recite the names of several
women who have taken on
prestigious titles in recent
years.
But most feminists believe
that if one can still count the
women who hold power in a
company, then there aren't
enough.
In the more than 10 years
since the feminist movement
began, women indeed have
"come a long way," as the
cigarette ads proclaim — espe
cially in California, which has
been at the forefront of the ef
fort.
But raised consciousness
and affirmative action prog
rams notwithstanding, many
women maintain that their
progress has not been what it
should be and in some cases,
not even as great as the public
has been led to believe.
"Most women are still in
low-paying, sex-segregated,
pink-collar jobs," asserts at
torney Gloria Allred, head of
the Los Angeles chapter of the
National Organization for
Women (NOW). "It's still
front-page news when a
woman is promoted in the
aerospace industry or enters
the cockpit of a plane."
The recent findings of an
inter-agency federal task force
ordered by President |immy
Carter to study the country's
female business owners were
similar to Allred's: "Women
are overrepresented in lower
paying jobs."
The report states that . .
the economic impact of . . .
systematic discrimination is
evident in the fact that, in 1976,
the median income of white
men employed full time was
$14,272; of black men, $10,222;
of white women, $8476 and of
black women, $7831."
One interesting finding in
the report was that "college
educated women have lower
incomes than men who have
completed only elementary
school."

NOW's Allred, whose legal
specialty is sex discrimination,
says there are so many such in
equities — both in hiring and
promotion — that government
agencies are now jammed with
sex discrimination suits.
"Some companies set up af
firmative action programs on
paper, but they don't back
them up in reality," she said.
"For example, they may give
a woman the title and not the
salary, or the salary and not the
title . . . The federal Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) does not
have the staff to deal with the
huge numbers of complaints."
Francisco Cancino, director
of the EEOC's Regional Litiga
tion Center in San Francisco,
agreed: "We're very busy. In
the last calendar year . . . we
had approximately 32 cases re
solved for about $5.5 million in
back pay. That's a great deal of
activity."
But he voiced guarded op
timism that sex barriers in the
business world are being bro
ken down. "I think things are
changing — but the material
for our lawsuits still exists."
One thing to keep in mind is
the large number of women
being discussed. Females, ac
cording to the latent census fi
gures, total 51.3 percent of the
country's population. At 109.4
million, they outnumber males
in the U.S. by 5.6 million.
Women in the labor force
number about 36 million com
pared with more than 57 mill
ion men. The Census Bureau
projects that, by 1980, those fi
gures should reflect even more
of a gap between employed
women and men: about 39
million women and more than
62 million men.
