# Card spikers open tonight

### JOHN DOANE 
Stanford's men's volleyball
team kicks off the 1979 cam
paign tonight when it hosts Cal
State Northridge here at 7:30
pm in Roble Gymnasium.
Although tonight's debut for
the Cardinals will be important
as far as developing necessary
on-court cohesiveness, the
Northridge match will just be a
tune-up tor later matches in
the newly formed CIVA
(California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association), of which
Stanford is a member.
Unlike past years when the
Cards have competed (and
dominated) almost exclusively
with Bay Area weak sisters such
as Chico, Humboldt, Fresno,
and Stanislaus States, this sea
son Stanford will concentrate
its competition with southern
California beach schools, pe
rennial powerhouses as far as
volleyball is concerned.
Indeed, since 1970 when the
NCAA first sanctioned vol
leyball as an official collegiate
sport, the national title has
been won all nine times by
southern California schools.
Of those nine titles, six have
been snagged by UCLA. USC,
San Diego State and Pepper
dine have won the other three
titles.
With such stiff competition,
is Stanford's men's volleyball
team destined for doom? Not
necessarily.
Those nine national titles
were won, more specifically,
by southern Cal iforni a players:
at Stanford, 12 of the 15 players
on the roster as well as both
coaches are from southern
California, the hotbed of com
petitive volleyball at every
level.
Ten of those players, includ
ing all six starters, are returning
from last year's 13-7 squad.
Add to this the fact that there is
only one senior on the 1979
roster and one thing becomes
apparent: the future for men's
volleyball at Stanford appears
to be very bright.
Last year, ex-water polo

turned-volleyball-coach Art
Lambert hired UCLA alumnus
Fred Sturm as assistant coach.
By season's end, Lambert had
retired to private business,
leaving Sturm with the head
coaching job.
Sturm lettered four years as a
hitter-blocker for Bruin coach
Al Scates and played on three
national championship teams.
The 25-year-old Florida native
was subsequently named Ail-
American twice and was also
twice a member of the US Na
tional Team.
Leading the pack of return
ing players is 6'2" setter David
Saeta, who established himself
as the team's premier setter
last vear as a freshman. Princi
pal targets for Saeta's various
sets will include 67" southpaw
Rich "Yard-Arm" Yardley, a
senior, and 6'l" middle
blocker Rod Fletcher.
Fletcher and fellow juniors
Tom Crimes and Kim Lum
played as freshmen when Stan
ford emerged onto the na
tional volleyball scene by ad
vancing to the Western Reg
ional tournament at UCSB in
1977.
Middle blockers Jack Fox
worth and Don Brewster, and
outside hitters Cory
"Downtown" Brown, Dave
Carico, and Frank Anderson
round out the list of returnees.
Offensively, the Cards will
rely on the setting of Saeta and
freshmen Kip Engen (1977
Southern California High
School Player of the Year) and
Bob Dean to get Stanford's 5-1
offense (five hitters, one set
ter) rolling
Says sturm, 'John (Bekins)
has done a super job with the
setters." Sturm ma\ move Saeta
to hitter, as the South Pasadena
native is also one of Stanford's
better hitters. "At this point,"
said Sturm, "I don t know who
will be our setter."
snirm also pointed out the
Cards leam depth as a major
siitoglh. "We have eleven or
so players who can play for us
.it any time. We have a lot of

fine athletes.
"This year's team is way
ahead of last year," said Sturm.
"The men have learned a lot
(since last year) and they all
have super attitudes."
Sturm attributes at least
some of this mental condition
to grueling fall workouts dur
ing which the volleyballers
worked up to 22 sets of stadium
steps (11 running and 11 hop
ping) and 24 70-yd. sprints in a
single session.
"At the very least, the work
outs were physically stimula
ing," said Sturm. "Most impor
tantly, the men got mentally in
shape."
The Cards will need to de
pend a great deal on this men
tal factor if they are to be con
tenders in the CIVA. UCLA will
return 13 lettermen including
All-Everything middle-blocker
Steve Salmons and a host of
outstanding newcomers in
cluding 1978 Southern Califor
nia High School Player of the
Year Kachy Kiraly.
USC, meanwhile, will be di

rected by setter Dusty Dvorak.
Winners of the NCAA crown in
1977, the Trojans will rely on
several inexperienced though
talented underclassmen to up
hold USC's tradition of fine hit
ting left by such cannons as
Celso Kalache and Bob Yoder.
Defending NCAA champ
Pepperdine will depend on hit
ters Mike Blanchard and lay
Anderson and setter Ron Wilde
to keep the title in Malibu.
At UCSB, first year coach Ken
Preston's Gauchos will have a
chance for the national title
only if middle blocker loerg
Lorscheider has an outstand
ing year.
Berkeley, Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo,and Loyola round out
Stanford's CIVA opponents.
As far as team goals are con
cerned, Sturm notes that he
"wants the team to be consis
tent." He admits that a league
championship, for this year at
least, is not likely. "We'll con
centrate on getting a spot at the
(Western) Regionals. That will
be very challenging in itself."

on-court cohesiveness, the
Northridge match will just be a
tune-up tor later matches in
the newly formed CIVA
(California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association), of which
Stanford is a member.
Unlike past years when the
Cards have competed (and
dominated) almost exclusively
with Bay Area weak sisters such
as Chico, Humboldt, Fresno,
and Stanislaus States, this sea
son Stanford will concentrate
its competition with southern
California beach schools, pe
rennial powerhouses as far as
volleyball is concerned.
Indeed, since 1970 when the
NCAA first sanctioned vol
leyball as an official collegiate
sport, the national title has
been won all nine times by
southern California schools.
Of those nine titles, six have
been snagged by UCLA. USC,
San Diego State and Pepper
dine have won the other three
titles.
With such stiff competition,
is Stanford's men's volleyball
team destined for doom? Not
necessarily.
Those nine national titles
were won, more specifically,
by southern Cal iforni a players:
at Stanford, 12 of the 15 players
on the roster as well as both
coaches are from southern
California, the hotbed of com
petitive volleyball at every
level.
Ten of those players, includ
ing all six starters, are returning
from last year's 13-7 squad.
Add to this the fact that there is
only one senior on the 1979
roster and one thing becomes
apparent: the future for men's
volleyball at Stanford appears
to be very bright.
Last year, ex-water polo

turned-volleyball-coach Art
Lambert hired UCLA alumnus
Fred Sturm as assistant coach.
By season's end, Lambert had
retired to private business,
leaving Sturm with the head
coaching job.
Sturm lettered four years as a
hitter-blocker for Bruin coach
Al Scates and played on three
national championship teams.
The 25-year-old Florida native
was subsequently named Ail-
American twice and was also
twice a member of the US Na
tional Team.
Leading the pack of return
ing players is 6'2" setter David
Saeta, who established himself
as the team's premier setter
last vear as a freshman. Princi
pal targets for Saeta's various
sets will include 67" southpaw
Rich "Yard-Arm" Yardley, a
senior, and 6'l" middle
blocker Rod Fletcher.
Fletcher and fellow juniors
Tom Crimes and Kim Lum
played as freshmen when Stan
ford emerged onto the na
tional volleyball scene by ad
vancing to the Western Reg
ional tournament at UCSB in
1977.
Middle blockers Jack Fox
worth and Don Brewster, and
outside hitters Cory
"Downtown" Brown, Dave
Carico, and Frank Anderson
round out the list of returnees.
Offensively, the Cards will
rely on the setting of Saeta and
freshmen Kip Engen (1977
Southern California High
School Player of the Year) and
Bob Dean to get Stanford's 5-1
offense (five hitters, one set
ter) rolling
Says sturm, 'John (Bekins)
has done a super job with the
setters." Sturm ma\ move Saeta
to hitter, as the South Pasadena
native is also one of Stanford's
better hitters. "At this point,"
said Sturm, "I don t know who
will be our setter."
snirm also pointed out the
Cards leam depth as a major
siitoglh. "We have eleven or
so players who can play for us
.it any time. We have a lot of

fine athletes.
"This year's team is way
ahead of last year," said Sturm.
"The men have learned a lot
(since last year) and they all
have super attitudes."
Sturm attributes at least
some of this mental condition
to grueling fall workouts dur
ing which the volleyballers
worked up to 22 sets of stadium
steps (11 running and 11 hop
ping) and 24 70-yd. sprints in a
single session.
"At the very least, the work
outs were physically stimula
ing," said Sturm. "Most impor
tantly, the men got mentally in
shape."
The Cards will need to de
pend a great deal on this men
tal factor if they are to be con
tenders in the CIVA. UCLA will
return 13 lettermen including
All-Everything middle-blocker
Steve Salmons and a host of
outstanding newcomers in
cluding 1978 Southern Califor
nia High School Player of the
Year Kachy Kiraly.
USC, meanwhile, will be di

rected by setter Dusty Dvorak.
Winners of the NCAA crown in
1977, the Trojans will rely on
several inexperienced though
talented underclassmen to up
hold USC's tradition of fine hit
ting left by such cannons as
Celso Kalache and Bob Yoder.
Defending NCAA champ
Pepperdine will depend on hit
ters Mike Blanchard and lay
Anderson and setter Ron Wilde
to keep the title in Malibu.
At UCSB, first year coach Ken
Preston's Gauchos will have a
chance for the national title
only if middle blocker loerg
Lorscheider has an outstand
ing year.
Berkeley, Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo,and Loyola round out
Stanford's CIVA opponents.
As far as team goals are con
cerned, Sturm notes that he
"wants the team to be consis
tent." He admits that a league
championship, for this year at
least, is not likely. "We'll con
centrate on getting a spot at the
(Western) Regionals. That will
be very challenging in itself."
