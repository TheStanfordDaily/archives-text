## Swimmers split meets 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
Stanford swimmers have
waded through the peaks and
the troughs of this season's
waves during the past two
weeks. Although they have not
always emerged victorious,
they have recorded fast times
while maintaining a rigorous
training schedule.
Last Friday, the team traveled
to Arizona for two days of stiff
competition against the Uni
versity of Arizona and Arizona
State University. Under over
cast Tucson skies, both the
men and the women eked past
conscientious Arizona contin
gents the first day.
Tri-captain Mike Bruner
spearheaded the men's drive
by achieving a hat-trick triple
win. His 200 free (1:40.52) was
his best of the year, and he also
touched the wall first in the 200
fly and the 200 free. Ken Shil
ling won the 200 IM and the 200
breast, and distance-man
Hartloff stretched to his fastest
1000 (9:22.01) of the season.
Vet coach Jim Gaughran de
lineated the crucial point of the
meet: the second-place finish
of Joe Jimenez behind Shilling
in the 200 breast. Gaughran de
scribed the freshman's 2:11.7
time as "good unrested and
unshaved" and explained, "It
he had been third, we would
not have won." In the end,
Stanford nipped Arizona 58-55.
The women found the
Arizona waters somewhat
smoother when they beat their
Tucson opponents 77-36. Val

erie Lee reappeared in the
Stanford lineup after a two
week sick leave to take the 200
(1:54.42) and 500 (5:05.32)
honors.
"She was not where she
would normally be," assistant
coach Claudia Thomas said of
Lee, "but she still swam very
well."
Linda Jezek won the 200 IM
and the 200 back, and Libby
Beaudet picked up another 200
fly victory. Noel Moran won
the 200 breast contest with re
lative ease and Jo Clarke em
barrassed her 1000 free com
petitors winning by more than
30 seconds.
However, Saturday's match
at Tempe was "like walking
into a buzz saw," according to
Gaughran. The Cardinals faced
off against a rested ASU team
and were out-swum by a com
bined score of 157-87. The
events were highly contested,
and Thomas emphasized that
"it was really closer than it
looks on paper."
"It's hard to be beaten so
soundly and come away with
good times," Thomas added,
but the Cards accomplished
exactly that feat.
The Sun Devil women's team
won the AIAW national champ
ionship last year and stands to
be the team to beat this year,
also. A group including
talented athletes such as
Melissa Belote, Peggy Tosdal
and Dianne Kutsunai should
merit such a reputation. Unfor
tunately, Stanford's equally

accredited team had not rested
for this meet as had the Arizo
nans.
The women's 400 medley
relay highlighted the intensely
fierce competition. ASU
squeaked by Stanford,
3:51.628t03:51.776. Gaughran
noted that last year's winning
national time in that event was
3:49, a mere 2 seconds faster.
Beaudet's 100 fly split on that
relay was her lifetime best,
56.4.
Moran won the 200 breast in
2:22.0, which Gaughran said is
"I think the fastest time in the
nation now." Jezek was first in
the 200 (2:02.0) and the 50
(27.27) backstrokes, and diver
Lisa Mariana won from both
the one meter and three meter
heights. Depicting the wo
men's overall action, Gaug
hran said that "so many races
were much faster than we will
see all year."
Bruner and Shilling starred
for the men, who were often
relegated to wake swimming.
Bruner placed first in the 200 fly
(1:50.67) and the 200 free, and
Shilling kicked his chlorinated
competitors to win the 200
breast (2:08.6).
"We did very well for the
type of conditioning we have
been doing,'' said Thomas.
Gaughran commented that
"sometimes you get caught not
resting fora duel meet, but the
meet was exciting from both
their and out standpoints. We
were pleased with the swim
ming but not the scores."

events were highly contested,
and Thomas emphasized that
"it was really closer than it
looks on paper."
"It's hard to be beaten so
soundly and come away with
good times," Thomas added,
but the Cards accomplished
exactly that feat.
The Sun Devil women's team
won the AIAW national champ
ionship last year and stands to
be the team to beat this year,
also. A group including
talented athletes such as
Melissa Belote, Peggy Tosdal
and Dianne Kutsunai should
merit such a reputation. Unfor
tunately, Stanford's equally

accredited team had not rested
for this meet as had the Arizo
nans.
The women's 400 medley
relay highlighted the intensely
fierce competition. ASU
squeaked by Stanford,
3:51.628t03:51.776. Gaughran
noted that last year's winning
national time in that event was
3:49, a mere 2 seconds faster.
Beaudet's 100 fly split on that
relay was her lifetime best,
56.4.
Moran won the 200 breast in
2:22.0, which Gaughran said is
"I think the fastest time in the
nation now." Jezek was first in
the 200 (2:02.0) and the 50
(27.27) backstrokes, and diver
Lisa Mariana won from both
the one meter and three meter
heights. Depicting the wo
men's overall action, Gaug
hran said that "so many races
were much faster than we will
see all year."
Bruner and Shilling starred
for the men, who were often
relegated to wake swimming.
Bruner placed first in the 200 fly
(1:50.67) and the 200 free, and
Shilling kicked his chlorinated
competitors to win the 200
breast (2:08.6).
"We did very well for the
type of conditioning we have
been doing,'' said Thomas.
Gaughran commented that
"sometimes you get caught not
resting fora duel meet, but the
meet was exciting from both
their and out standpoints. We
were pleased with the swim
ming but not the scores."
Stanford swimmers have
waded through the peaks and
the troughs of this season's
waves during the past two
weeks. Although they have not
always emerged victorious,
they have recorded fast times
while maintaining a rigorous
training schedule.
Last Friday, the team traveled
to Arizona for two days of stiff
competition against the Uni
versity of Arizona and Arizona
State University. Under over
cast Tucson skies, both the
men and the women eked past
conscientious Arizona contin
gents the first day.
Tri-captain Mike Bruner
spearheaded the men's drive
by achieving a hat-trick triple
win. His 200 free (1:40.52) was
his best of the year, and he also
touched the wall first in the 200
fly and the 200 free. Ken Shil
ling won the 200 IM and the 200
breast, and distance-man
Hartloff stretched to his fastest
1000 (9:22.01) of the season.
Vet coach Jim Gaughran de
lineated the crucial point of the
meet: the second-place finish
of Joe Jimenez behind Shilling
in the 200 breast. Gaughran de
scribed the freshman's 2:11.7
time as "good unrested and
unshaved" and explained, "It
he had been third, we would
not have won." In the end,
Stanford nipped Arizona 58-55.
The women found the
Arizona waters somewhat
smoother when they beat their
Tucson opponents 77-36. Val

erie Lee reappeared in the
Stanford lineup after a two
week sick leave to take the 200
(1:54.42) and 500 (5:05.32)
honors.
"She was not where she
would normally be," assistant
coach Claudia Thomas said of
Lee, "but she still swam very
well."
Linda Jezek won the 200 IM
and the 200 back, and Libby
Beaudet picked up another 200
fly victory. Noel Moran won
the 200 breast contest with re
lative ease and Jo Clarke em
barrassed her 1000 free com
petitors winning by more than
30 seconds.
However, Saturday's match
at Tempe was "like walking
into a buzz saw," according to
Gaughran. The Cardinals faced
off against a rested ASU team
and were out-swum by a com
bined score of 157-87. The
events were highly contested,
and Thomas emphasized that
"it was really closer than it
looks on paper."
