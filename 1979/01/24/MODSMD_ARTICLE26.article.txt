Arab gunners shell Israeli towns
Tel Aviv, Israel — Palestinian gunners shelled Israeli
villages from bases in southern Lebanon again yesterday
and Israel answered with an artillery barrage and a warn
ing that Lebanon will suffer more than Israel if the shoot
ing continues along the volatile border.
Many Israelis living along the 69-mile frontier spent
the day in bomb shelters.
A school in Kiryat Shmona took a direct hit from a
Katyusha rocket moments after 400 pupils and their
teachers descended into shelters.
In Beirut, the Lebanese government summoned the
ambassadors of the five big powers of the U.N. Security
Council and demanded they put pressure on Israel to
stop firing rockets and artillery shells across the border.
The high command of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Libera
tion Organization claimed Israeli forces shelled the port
of Tyre and the inland city of Nabatiyeh in a "major
escalation of hostilities."
In )erusalem, Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan warned
that Israel would not "stay helpless against the PLO.
Defense Minister Ezer Weizman was reported by Israel
Radio to have warned that Lebanese civilian populations
would suffer if the Palestinian attacks against Israeli
towns continue.
Shah retains support of military
Tehran, Iran — Iranian military leaders marched the
elite imperial guard yesterday in a bristling, goose
stepping show of loyalty. They boasted the troops were
ready to "shed their blood" to support the monarchy
and the government of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakht
iar.
One of the chief aides to religious opposition leader
Ayatullah Khomeini, meanwhile, warned that unless
Bakhtiar resigns in favor of the ayatullah's planned Is
lamic republic, strikes will continue to cripple the na
tion's oil-based economy. Khomeini is expected to re
turn Friday from Paris after 15 years in exile.

On the advice of the Iranian military, Britain s Royal
Air Force plans to evacuate more than 200 foreigners
from the oil center of Ahwaz today. About halt of them
are American oil industry workers who will be taken
from the strife-torn area to Bahrain, on the Persian Gulf.
In an unusual show, the military paraded 1000 of Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's imperial soldiers, primarily
for the benefit of foreign reporters.
Referring to Khomeini's plans to replace the monar
chy with an Islamic republic, an authoritative govern
ment source in Tehran said the "army will not tolerate
any action directed against the constitution. If such ac
tion is taken, a bloodbath cannot be ruled out."
Vietnam says 'uprising' complete
Bangkok, Thailand — Vietnam said yesterday that the
"people's uprising that toppled the Cambodian gov
ernment of Premier Pol Pot was complete and irrever
sible." But Thai and Western intelligence officials said
fighting was continuing, some near Phnom Penh, the
capital.
Vietnam's army newspaper, ()uan Doi Nhan Dan, said
China, which supports the Pol Pot government, was
trying to sabotage the Cambodian revolution and that "a
psychological campaign is being whipped up by Peking
to distort" the situation.
Vietnam, which is backed by Moscow, denies that
Vietnamese troops defeated Pol Pot's army and led the
Cambodian rebels into Phnom Penh, which fell on Jan.
7. But Western sources say up to 100,000 Vietnamese
soldiers were involved in the Cambodian invasion,
which began Dec. 25, and that the Cambodian rebels did
little if any of the fighting.
The Vietnam army newspaper said the Chinese had
fabricated reports about continued resistance in Cam
bodia.
The new Phnom Penh official media have not men
tioned the continued fighting in Cambodia. The broad
cast and reports of the news agency SPK claim life is
returning to normal in many areas.

Judge halts Laetrile treatment
Plymouth, Mass. — The parents of 3-year-old Chad
Green, the locus of a court battle over cancer therapy,
were ordered yesterday to stop giving him Laetrile and
large doses of vitamins to treat his leukemia.
ludge Guy Volterra issued the order in Plymouth
Superior Court. Six months ago, he had put the boy in
the control of the state because the parents refused to
give him chemotherapy to treat his cancer.
Last Friday, he ended two weeks o! hearings on a
request by Chad s parents, Diana and Gerald Green of
Scituate, to resume custody of their son.
At those hearings, state officials contended Chad suf
fers from cyanide poisoning caused by the Laetrile and
vitamin A poisoning brought on by high doses of the
vitamin.
The judge said yesterday Chad must remain in the
legal custody of the state, even though he can live with
his parents. The judge also said Massachusetts General
Hospital must be allowed to do periodic tests on Chad to
check for cyanide and vitamin A poisoning.
Panel stops dam to save fish
Washington — A Cabinet-level committee yesterday
barred the Tennessee Valley Authority from completing
the $119 million Tellico Dam in Tennessee, ruling that
possible benefits from the project did not justify killing
off the snail darter.
At the same time, the Endangered Species Committee
voted to permit completion of the $1.6 billion Grayrocks
Dam and Reservoir in Wyoming, provided protective
measures are taken to ensure the project does not im
peril whooping cranes.
Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus, chairman of the
panel, said the unanimous decisions prove the commit
tee can resolve conflicts between the law protecting
endangered species and the public's need for govern
ment projects.
But Senate Republican Leader Floward Baker of Ten

nessee criticized the committee's action on Tellico, say
ing in a statement, "It that's all the good the committee
process can do, to put us right back where we started
from, we might as well save the time and expense.''
Talmadge admitted to hospital
Washington — Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-Ca.) has
been admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment
of alcohol abuse and other complaints, an aide said
yesterday.
Talmadge, 65 years old and a 22-year veteran of the
Senate, entered the Maryland hospital Monday night on
the advice of his physician, according to news secretary
Cordon Roberts.
"7he Georgia senator asked that he be admitted to be
treated for exhaustion, fatigue and alcohol abuse, which
associates said was the result ot prolonged stress and
pressures," Roberts said in a statement.
The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating allega
tions that Talmadge ordered the diversion of $.19,000 in
campaign contributions and expense funds into a secret
Washington bank account. 7he panel is scheduled to
hold a hearing next month.
