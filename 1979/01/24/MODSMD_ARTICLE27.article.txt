# Consulting service to aid TAs being established
## 
### DAVID FRANK 
A consulting service for teaching assistants (TAs) who
would like to improve their instructional skills is being
established now, according to Michele Fisher, the direc
tor of the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) here.
In past years, TAs were given what Fisher called "little
or no preparation before teaching their classes." Now
the CTL sponsors a half-day of orientation activities each
fall to prepare FAs for their classes by giving tips on how
to lecture, lead discussions, and run labs. Last tail's
orientation drew about 160 people, she said.
During the academic year, additional lectures called
"TA Talks," are provided on various subjects such as
"Grading — the Agony and the Equity" and "A Discus
sion on Discussion."
The CTL also has a library of materials on teaching and
teaching improvement that are available to TAs.
"We also want every TA to have a copy of our hand
book," Fisher said. This reference combines listings of
important dates, offices, and telephone numbers
around campus along with a helpful section of teaching
tips.
Already in its third year, the CTL has started expanding
its services further to improve TAs' instructional skills.

Currently, Fisher is assembling a consulting commit
tee of past and present TAs who she said "expressed an
interest in improving their own teaching and who have
shown themselves to be good teachers." This commit
tee receives what she called "instruction in various
evaluative techniques."
Any TA who calls up the CTL requesting evaluation will
be referred to one of the consultants on this committee.
From there, the consultant will visit the TA's class and
make observations. He or she will also arrange for the TA
to be videotaped in class for later review.
"The feedback the consultants will give the TAs is not
at all designed to be intimidating," said Rob Dorit,
human biology core coordinator and member of the
consulting committee. "We have to be supportive. The
whole purpose of a consultant is to be someone who will
show the TA a mutual concern for improving teaching."
Whether or not the CTL's expanded service will en
courage more TAs to seek advice remains to be seen.
Fisher feels the program will work because the system
being set up will reinforce good teaching.
"Before," she said, "no one cared about TAs. Now we
are putting people together so that they can support
each other's efforts."
