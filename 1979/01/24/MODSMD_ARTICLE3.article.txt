# State of Union speech sets philosophical tone
## Carter urges control of inflation 
### 
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter
asked Congress last night to help him build "a new
foundation" for prosperity at home and peace ab
road, dismissing as myths the notions that Ameri
ca's only choices are between inflation and reces
sion, controntation and surrender.
In a televised State of the Union address that
marked the midway point of his four-year term,
Carter ventured no dramatic now proposals, but
bid for enactment of those he already has out
lined.
He said those proposals would be the basis for
the "new foundation" that was both the theme
and the slogan of his message.
"Tonight, I ask you to join me in building that
new foundation — a better foundation — for our
country and our world," he said.
Urges support
The president urged support for his increased
defense budget and said a new strategic arms limi
tation agreement with the Soviet Union will not be
signed unless it advances American safety.
"I will sign no agreement which cannot be ver
ified... I will sign no agreement unless our deter
rent force will remain overwhelming," he said.
Carter said the United States intends to pursue
an activist foreign policy that has among its princi
pal goals a SALT treaty with the Soviet Union and
peace in the Middle East.
No explanation
Carter gave no explanation of what is holding up
completion of the new weapons treaty that 16
months ago he said was within reach.

Concerning inflation, the president declared
once more that the price spiral can be slowed
without a recession or wage and price controls.
Nearly half of his speech was devoted to the
need to control inflation. "Together, we build the
foundation for the a strong economy with lower
inflation without contriving either a recession with
its high unemployment, or unworkable mandat
ory government controls," he said.
Wage insurance
The president urged Congress to enact his
proposed wage insurance progiam for which he
has set aside $2.5 billion in his fiscal 1980 budget.
The money would be paid to workers who restrain
their wage demands if inflation exceeds 7 percent
this year.
In his speech from the Capitol, Carter presented
these legislative proposals:
— A ceiling on hospital price increases, which
he called a clear test of congressional commitment
to fight inflation.
— A measure preparing for national health in
surance, to be phased in during the 1980s.
— Limited public financing of congressional
election campaigns.
— Deregulation of the trucking and rail indus
tries.
— Reorganization programs in education,
economic development and the management of
natural resources.
Sound slate
Carter declared that "the state of the union is
sound." He also said, "The duty of our generation
of Americans is to renew our nation's faith." The

president urged banishment of "selfishness, cyni
cism and apathy."
The president said that problems facing Ameri
cans today "are different in nature from those that
confronted earlier generations...more subtle,
more complex, more interrelated."
"At home, few of these problems can be solved
by government alone. Abroad few of them can be
solved by the United States alone."
Lean budget
The State ot the Union address followed by one
day Carter's unveiling of a "lean and austere"
budget that calls for spending $5\2 billion in fiscal
1980, with a deficit of $29 billion. The new fiscal
year begins Oct. 1.
In tune with an economy-minded Congress and
electorate, Carter decided at the outset of the
speechwriting process that he would emphasize
the urgency of fighting inflation.
Perhaps more philosophical than most such ad
dresses, the Carter text seeks to put in a larger
context the eventual good he expects to flow from
budgetary stringency.
Similarly, White House sources said, the presi
dent decided to depict his quest fora new strategic
arms limitation treaty as yet another move to force
a more prosperous and peaceful world in the years
ahead.
Battle lines on a prospective SALT agreement
with the Soviet Union already are forming in the
Senate, which would have to ratify it. And the new
budget, although widely applauded, is certain to
be challenged in its particulars by interest groups
that would be adversely affec ted.
