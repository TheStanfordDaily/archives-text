# Plans for escort service taking shape
## 
### FRAN MILLER 
Dean of Student Affairs Leah Kaplan
and junior Ron Lepow have begun
planning an escort service for
women in order to combat the grow
ing problem of rape on campus.
Although the final details have not
been worked out, Lepow said he
hopes to have the project started
within a month.
At that time, women who desire
escorts may call a number, give their
name, their present location and de
sired destinaton. The woman will
then be told the name of her male
escort. When he arrives to pick her
up he will then tell her his name for
purposes of identification, in order
to eliminate the possibility of rapists
posing as escorts.
Lepow said, "This kind of project
has been entering my mind fora long
time. The editorial in the Daily from a
girl who had been raped really hit
home. I think it's stupid that this has
been going on."
Real possibilities
Kaplan, who is assisting Lepow
with the organization of the service,
has agreed to finance the cost of a
switchboard operator. Although lo
cation of the switchboard is unde
termined at this point, Kaplan said
she felt that "everything is falling into
place very nicely. I think it (the ser
vice) has real possibilities."
Although Lepow said he realizes
and hopes the service can expand in
many directions, in the beginning it
will be available from 8 p.m. to 12
midnight, Sunday through Thursday.
The service will be provided on cam
pus only.
Lepow plans to have three escorts
"on call" for each two-hour period
and will know the escorts personally.
He said he doesn't think that recruit
ing 30 escorts will be difficult since 10
men have already offered to help
without ever being formally ap
proached.
"It is important," Lepow said,
"tnat guys really want to participate
in the service."

After all the escorts have volun
teered, a "brainstorm meeting" will
be held to "lay the ground ruies and
determine the most logical process"
by which to execute the project, ac
cording to Lepow.
"My main fear and our number
one chance of failure is that the ser
vice won't be used," said Lepow. He
said he believes this could happen if
students don't know the service
exists or if they adopt the attitude
that nothing can happen to them.
To inform the public, Lepow said
he plans to advertise through every
means available. Besides publicizing
information on KZSU, in the Daily
and through the wide distribution of
flyers, Lepow said he hopes to ar
range classroom announcements
and personal talks at each campus
residence.
Excuses made
"People don't realize how many
rapes there are on campus. Although
some are unavoidable, many can be
prevented," Lepow said. He added
that he compares the attitude of sev
eral women to the frequent excuse
made by accident victims: "I was just
going around the corner so I didn't
need to wear my seat belt." Lepow
said he hopes that if women are
aware of the problem, and know that
men are concerned and willing to
help, the service will be used.
Lepcw and Kaplan conferred yes
terday with Police Services Director
Marvin Herrington in order to get
further suggestions and to under
stand more fully the legalities of the
project. According to Kaplan, Her
rington was "very supportive" and
said he wanted to attend the orienta
tion meeting for escorts, as well as
provide them with whistles and iden
tification cards.
"I very much want to see that even
after I leave, this thing keeps going,"
said Lepow. He said he would like to
eventually set up routing and "have
so many escorts and groups of
people walking around on campus
that rapists won't have a chance."

"I want this project to be respected
and people to be glad they have it,"
Lepow said. He added that he would
be "surprised, disappointed and re
bellious" if the University didn't fund
the service in the future.
A "very professional" escort ser
vice is funded by UC-Berkeley, ac
cording to Leah Halper, a resident of
Zapata House. She said that escorts
there are paid, carefully screened,
and trained by the police depart
ment. Halper did some research on
the subject after a representative
from the Rape Education Project gave
a presentation at a house meeting in
the fall.
Men concerned
"The guys were really concerned
after that meeting," Halper said.
Since shortly after that time, a house
escort service organized by two resi
dents — Rich Dvorak and Chris
Ponce — has been operating suc
cessfully.
Dvorak and Ponce printed a list of

people who agreed to serve as es
corts, alone or in pairs, any time a
fellow resident needed them. Ac
cording to Halper, the vast majority
wanted to be included on the list. For
protection, only the tirst names and
first initial ol last names, along with
phone numbers, were on the list
given to each Zapata resident.
Halper said that most of the
women have used the service either
by calling someone or making escort
arrangements beforehand. She said
that the service will continue to op
erate until the campus-wide service
is established.
"This is a good way to encourage a
dorm community spirit," Halper
said. "If other dorms are at all con
cerned about rape, they will start a
similar project." Besides "making
people more educated about rape,"
the project has, according to Halper,
"made everyone feel safer, relieved
some worrying and given people a
sense of security."

tification cards.
"I very much want to see that even
after I leave, this thing keeps going,"
said Lepow. He said he would like to
eventually set up routing and "have
so many escorts and groups of
people walking around on campus
that rapists won't have a chance."

"I want this project to be respected
and people to be glad they have it,"
Lepow said. He added that he would
be "surprised, disappointed and re
bellious" if the University didn't fund
the service in the future.
A "very professional" escort ser
vice is funded by UC-Berkeley, ac
cording to Leah Halper, a resident of
Zapata House. She said that escorts
there are paid, carefully screened,
and trained by the police depart
ment. Halper did some research on
the subject after a representative
from the Rape Education Project gave
a presentation at a house meeting in
the fall.
Men concerned
"The guys were really concerned
after that meeting," Halper said.
Since shortly after that time, a house
escort service organized by two resi
dents — Rich Dvorak and Chris
Ponce — has been operating suc
cessfully.
Dvorak and Ponce printed a list of

people who agreed to serve as es
corts, alone or in pairs, any time a
fellow resident needed them. Ac
cording to Halper, the vast majority
wanted to be included on the list. For
protection, only the tirst names and
first initial ol last names, along with
phone numbers, were on the list
given to each Zapata resident.
Halper said that most of the
women have used the service either
by calling someone or making escort
arrangements beforehand. She said
that the service will continue to op
erate until the campus-wide service
is established.
"This is a good way to encourage a
dorm community spirit," Halper
said. "If other dorms are at all con
cerned about rape, they will start a
similar project." Besides "making
people more educated about rape,"
the project has, according to Halper,
"made everyone feel safer, relieved
some worrying and given people a
sense of security."
Dean of Student Affairs Leah Kaplan
and junior Ron Lepow have begun
planning an escort service for
women in order to combat the grow
ing problem of rape on campus.
Although the final details have not
been worked out, Lepow said he
hopes to have the project started
within a month.
At that time, women who desire
escorts may call a number, give their
name, their present location and de
sired destinaton. The woman will
then be told the name of her male
escort. When he arrives to pick her
up he will then tell her his name for
purposes of identification, in order
to eliminate the possibility of rapists
posing as escorts.
Lepow said, "This kind of project
has been entering my mind fora long
time. The editorial in the Daily from a
girl who had been raped really hit
home. I think it's stupid that this has
been going on."
Real possibilities
Kaplan, who is assisting Lepow
with the organization of the service,
has agreed to finance the cost of a
switchboard operator. Although lo
cation of the switchboard is unde
termined at this point, Kaplan said
she felt that "everything is falling into
place very nicely. I think it (the ser
vice) has real possibilities."
Although Lepow said he realizes
and hopes the service can expand in
many directions, in the beginning it
will be available from 8 p.m. to 12
midnight, Sunday through Thursday.
The service will be provided on cam
pus only.
Lepow plans to have three escorts
"on call" for each two-hour period
and will know the escorts personally.
He said he doesn't think that recruit
ing 30 escorts will be difficult since 10
men have already offered to help
without ever being formally ap
proached.
"It is important," Lepow said,
"tnat guys really want to participate
in the service."

After all the escorts have volun
teered, a "brainstorm meeting" will
be held to "lay the ground ruies and
determine the most logical process"
by which to execute the project, ac
cording to Lepow.
"My main fear and our number
one chance of failure is that the ser
vice won't be used," said Lepow. He
said he believes this could happen if
students don't know the service
exists or if they adopt the attitude
that nothing can happen to them.
To inform the public, Lepow said
he plans to advertise through every
means available. Besides publicizing
information on KZSU, in the Daily
and through the wide distribution of
flyers, Lepow said he hopes to ar
range classroom announcements
and personal talks at each campus
residence.
Excuses made
"People don't realize how many
rapes there are on campus. Although
some are unavoidable, many can be
prevented," Lepow said. He added
that he compares the attitude of sev
eral women to the frequent excuse
made by accident victims: "I was just
going around the corner so I didn't
need to wear my seat belt." Lepow
said he hopes that if women are
aware of the problem, and know that
men are concerned and willing to
help, the service will be used.
Lepcw and Kaplan conferred yes
terday with Police Services Director
Marvin Herrington in order to get
further suggestions and to under
stand more fully the legalities of the
project. According to Kaplan, Her
rington was "very supportive" and
said he wanted to attend the orienta
tion meeting for escorts, as well as
provide them with whistles and iden
tification cards.
"I very much want to see that even
