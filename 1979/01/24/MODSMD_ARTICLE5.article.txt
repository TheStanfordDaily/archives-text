# Albers Wall project delayed until spring
## 
### LIZ SCHERMER 
Further construction of the so
called Albers Wall, the sculpture
being built in front of the Physics
Fank ( will be delayed until early
spring due to problems in obtain
ing construction materials.
According to Roger Cairns,
senior planner of facilities and
properties, Robert Mittelstadt,
project architect, has only given
partial approval for some of the
materials to be used in the pro
ject.
The materials needed for the
wall's construction are white
brick, black granite and stainless
steel bars. Approval of the mate
rials has caused delays because
Albers' design is an exacting,
complicated one, which, accord
ing to Art Prof. Albert Elsen
"leaves no leeway for error."
Steel polygonal
The wall runs east to west so
that both sides, one of white brick
with dark steel bars, the other of
black granite with steel polygonal
designs, will receive light all day
long.

Contractor Delcon Associates
of Hayward has ordered the white
brick but, "it is not scheduled to
be delivered from Arkansas until
mid-February," said Cairns. "I've
asked the contractor to expedite
its delivery. Obviously we can't
get anything done until the brick
is delivered,"he added.
Bruce Beasley, the Oakland
steel-work sculptor for the pro
ject, is doing test samples on the
finish of the sculpture's bars. Mit
telstadt is reviewing these sam
ples, but has not given final ap
proval yet.
Plagued by delays
The wall's construction has
been plagued by delays since ar
tist Joseph Albers donated the de
sign for the sculpture to Stanford
at the request of Elsen in 1971.
Time was needed for private or
ganizations and individuals to
raise the estimated $100,000
needed for the project and there
was much controversy overwhere
the wall should be located. The
site between the Physics Tank and
th Quad was finally chosen by a
group of impartial art experts.
