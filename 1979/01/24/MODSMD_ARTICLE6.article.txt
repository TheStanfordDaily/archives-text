# Students learn of life, the real world, financial independence

### MICHAEL PRINCE 
— The teacher addressed the
class: "This lady here says her
l£iJnds aren't connected to her
brain. Don't worry about it.
Frankly, you'll be better off in
the long run if you bypass the
brain."
Now wait a second! Bypass
the brain?
"Order!" the teacher bel
lowed, "a rocks, a torn, a
screw, and a dirty mother."
The student nodded after
each name. "Okay, I got it." He
placed a row of glasses on the
counter before him and started
pour various colored liquids
from variously labeled bottles.
~Bypass the brain? A dirty
mother? Just what are we talk
ing about here? According to
instructor Marty Weiner, we're
talking about life, the real
world, financial indepen
dence, in short, the 'art' of bar
tending.
Weiner, who graduated
from Stanford in 1973 with a
Ph.D. in philosophy and later
became a professional barten
der, teaches a non-accredited

ASSU Special Programs course
in bartending.
He claims that students who
take his $45 preparatory course
know more about bartending
at the end of the eight week
session than people who take
the $300 professional courses.
Weiner goes out of his way
to create a slangy, barroom at
mosphere in the old organic
chemistry lab where the class
meets.
"Bartending is a high pres
sure job," he pointed out,
"there's a lot of things to do at
once, and a good bartender
knows how to handle the pres
sure."
Weiner sidled up to one of
the two women in the 20 per
son class, leaned over her
'bar,' and asked, "Hey, how
'bout a slow screw?" She stop
ped pouring drinks and said
nothing. "See," continued
Weiner, "you let me mess up
your timing. Women, particu
larly, have to develop ready re
sponses. Everyone's going to
want to come on to you."
Most of the class time is

spent pouring out one ounce
"shots," and preparing "re
cipe" drinks.
Learning how to pour drinks
is only part of the curriculum of
the course, however. Barroom
etiquette, unfamiliar to most
Stanford undergrads, is also
crucial knowledge for future
bartenders.
"You should never embar
rass somebody," Weiner
pointed out. "When I see a
couple walk in, and it's clear
they're not too familiar with
each other, I'll only talk to the
guy, and I'll try to make him
look as good as possible."
"How do you know if they're
familiar?" one student asked.
"Oh, you know,"he replied.
"Now, if I sense they've been
around I may play it a little dif
ferently, and if they're over 50
I'll play it very differently. If
they're over 50 I'll pay attention
to the gal and forget the guy
'cause he gets off on that."
Okay, but isn't there a great
incongruity here? Doesn't the
thought of upstanding young
college students tending bar

rankle our '.'refined sen
sibilities?"
The students themselves
think not. While admitting that
her parents "wouldn't con
done" the scheme, freshman
Dana Wohlsord said bartend
ing will be "a good way to make
money and meet people."
Most students emphasized
the financial advantages of the
job. Junior Beth Robertson,
whose parents are also unac
quainted with their daughter's
aspirations, complained of the
low salaries and long hours
which waitresses receive, and
said she would like to bartend
mostly "to make money."
The money is good and jobs
are plentiful, according to
Weiner. Starting pay in Penin
sula "houses" is about $5.
Good bartenders can work ir
regular shifts and pick up work
wherever they go. Senior Carib
Nelson said he plans to take a
year off to bartend in Sun Val
ley.
"Many of these students will
never become bartenders,"
said Weiner, "but as doctors

and lawyers they will be more
comfortable hosts."
"Students become more
confident as a result of having a
skill," he concluded. "The bar
offers all types of people, a
microcosm of life. Every cus
tomer who walks in gives you a
chance to discover your
limits."
"Order! A torn, a fizz, a sour,
and a sexy Russian."
Glasses clink, colored water
pours and the students start
mixing.
"Hey buddy," the teacher
drawls, "where's the can?"
"Over there," the student
points without taking his atten
tion from the task.
"Who was Nixon's first vice
president?" the teacher de
mands.
"Spiro Agnew," the students
reply, replacing their whiskey
bottles and picking up the
vodka.
