# C-US to explore credit inflation, residential ed
## 
### STEPHANIE POGGI 
Who decided that your ad
viser knows about advising?
Who determined you'd earn
three units for a class you
thought was worth five? Who
picked your resident fellow?
There actually is a tangible au
thority that makes decisions
like these and controls the
tenor of undergraduate educa
tion here.
Most students are aware that
a Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-US) exists,
but it probably comes as a sur
prise to discover that its mem
bers have a finger in nearly
every pie on campus. The
committee's official charge, as
adopted by the Faculty Senate
in 1969, is to formulate policy
concerning undergraduate
education and to review the
operations of the dean of un
dergraduate studies. Theoreti
cally, it functions under the
Academic Council headed by
William Chace, along with
other University committees.
Despite any supposed
guidelines, however, the
broad nature of their responsi
bility and a real commitment to
University education have re
sulted in a group whose au
spices appear boundless. In
other words, C-US influences a
wide spectrum of student af
fairs and determines every
thing from what kind of orien
tation freshmen receive to the
possibility of formal recogni
tion on graduation day to stu
dents completing two majors.
The committee consists of
faculty members selected from
many disciplines, includng
pharmacology, engineering,
and linguistics and three stu
dent members nominated by
the ASSU Nominations Com
mittee on the basis of written
essays and interviews. Full
members serve for three years
along with Dean of Under
graduate Studies Merant
katchadourian, who serves in
an ex-officio, non-voting
capacity. Other co-opted
members such as Registrar
Sally Mahoney and as
sociate dean of Humanities
and Sciences Martin Evans,
also serve.
Despite the impact C-US
makes on campus life, and
specifically on undergraduate
academic satisfaction, it offi
cially has no autonomy or
decision-making powers. Ac
cording to the established
guidelines of the Academic
Council, C-US is merely re

sponsible for the tentative
formulaton of policy. The Fa
culty Senate can approve or re
ject the committee's approval
proposals. Further, the dean of
undergraduate studies has the
final responsibility to carry out
approved policies.
The senate, however, cannot
discuss undergraduate prop
osals unless they are investi
gated first by C-US.
Policies
What kind of policy is C-US
making? Among the commit
tee's many achievements, it
was responsible in large part
for the establishment of
SWOPSI and SCIRE, the prog
rams which are still under
periodic review by C-US. C-US
also reviews special education
programs on campus and the
quality of interdepartmental
majors such as international re
lations, which was re-approved
by the committee for another
five-year period in June 1978.
Perhaps C-US' most con
troversial contribution to cam
pus policy is the proposed
Western Culture requirement.
The committee's concern over
students' common lack of
background in the classics
translated into a two-year in
troductory pilot program for
freshmen, which began last
fall. C-US has also carried out
numerous investigations of the
advising program, though with
disputed results.
According to Jan Triska, cur

rent C-US chairman and pro
fessor of political science, the
committee sees itself as
"something of a watchdog."
He mentioned three specific
issues of crucial importance to
undergraduates that are pre
sently under debate by the
committee.
Distribution requirements
Distribution requirements
probably take precedence as
the single largest topic for con
sideration. Triska described
the existing framework as "so
nebulous, so broad" that it's
impossible to tell if any provi
sion is being made to insure
the breadth of experience the
program is designed to insure.
Senior Andy Brown, a two-year
C-US member, voiced similar
concerns.
"Requirements are presently
so loosely defined that stu
dents probably don't even get
an elementary grasp of the
methdology used in any single
area outside their own field,"
Brown said. Katchadourian, who
originally raised the issue,
noted that there is some ques
tion that "Stanford even offers
the kind of courses that would
measure up" should distribu
tion requirements be revised.
C-US has formed an ad-hoc
subcommittee to investigate
the topic and will receive its
report this spring.
Residential education
The second issue under fire
is residential education. Al-

though this topic would seem
to come under the dean of stu
dent affairs who deals with
dorm life, Katchadourian de
scribed residential education
"as a major part of the overall
educational experience" and
therefore, an issue for C-US.
"Basically the problem is that
residential education tends to
be a highly variable experi
ence,' he said. He mentioned
that residential ed runs the
gamut from freshmen prog
rams like Structured Liberal
Education (SLE), a program
which almost eliminates the
distinction between education
and dormlife to standard hous
ing that provides no required
intellectual atmosphere.
A ma|or part of the problem,
according to both Triska and
Brown, is a lack of adequate
Universiy compensation.
"There is nothing that rewards
faculty resident fellows here.
Housing accomodations for
married residents are poor and
there is little or no status at
tached to the position, said
Brown. In fact, according to
Brown, only 15 of the 27 resi
dent fellows are faculty mem
bers.
Credit evaluation
The last bit of turmoil centers
around credit evaluation.
"There's obviously quite a bit
of discrepancy," said Katch
adourian. Triska also men
tioned a need for "increased
uniformity and perhaps some

kind of guideline for unit
analysis" to eliminate dis
parities. He called the present
credit-evaluation system "a
can of worms."
C-US' concerns are primarily
of importance to under
graduates. Apparently, student
committee members go a long
way toward influencing those
decisions. Brown, forexample,
was the driving force behind
the proposal passed by the Fa
culty Senate just last year to
give formal transcript recogni
tion to students completing
more than one major. Katch
adourian described the role
students play on the commit
tee as "very real and positive."
Forall its impact as the prime
overseer of undergraduate
education, C-US has draw
backs. It can't do everything.
Katchadourian mentioned, for
example, Stanford's lack of a
viable curriculum committee.
"C-US simply doesn't have the
capacity to serve in that func
tion," he said. "Its composi
tion just doesn't allow it."
Another problem is that
C-US is, by nature, a reactio
nary committee. Although it is
involved with the formulation
of new policy, it largely re
sponds rather than innovates.
Be that as it may, there are
enough areas for potential im
provement and change that
C-US should have ample room
for constructive action for a
long time to come.
