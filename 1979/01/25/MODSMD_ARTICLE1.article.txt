Tehran, Iran (AP) — Self-exiled re
ligious leader Ayatullah Ruhollah
Khomeini has agreed to delay his re
turn to Iran for three weeks at the
request of Prime Minister Shahpour
Bakhtiar, a government source said
early today.
Khomeini had planned to end his
14-year exile and return to Tehran
from Paris tomorrow to begin efforts
to replace the Bakhtiar government
with an Islamic republic, his aides in
France said yesterday.
The government source, who
asked not to be identified, said the
need for special security for Kho
meini's arrival and protection in Iran
led Bakhtiar to suggest that he delay
his arrival for at least three weeks.
The source said several million
Iranians could be expected to greet
Khomeini, who led the uprising that
drove the shah from the country,
upon his arrival in Tehran. "The
crowd alone would have been too
dangerous and too difficulj to
handle," he said.
It was early morning in Paris and
there was no immediate comment
from Khomeini or his aides.
Airports closed
Earlier yesterday Gen. Mehdi
Rhimi, the military governor of
Tehran, made no mention of Kho
meini in an announcement that all of
the nation's airports were being
closed, according to a Tehran Radio
broadcast monitored in London. The
military had closed the Tehran air
port for several hours yesterday.
Tehran Radio quoted Rhimi as say
ing the three-day closure was or
dered because of a nationwide strike
by government flight control
employees, and the "failure" of cer
tain companies to operate flights.
Companies named in the broadcast
were the German and French air
lines, Lufthansa and Air France. The
broadcast said the airports would be
shutdown beginning at midnight last
night.
The ayatullah, living in self-exile in
Paris, was planning to fly back to Iran
either tonight or tomorrow, accord
ing to his aides. He is a leader of the
Moslem Shiites who make up the
majority of Iran's population and he
directed the uprising that forced
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to
leave the country on )an. 16. The
shah also is a member of the Shiite
sect.
Envoy
Meanwhile, Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar said he sent a
special envoy to Khomeini to try to
reach a reconciliation with the man
who led the year-long revolt that
forced the shah to leave the country.
In Paris, Khomeini aide Ibrahim
Yazdi told reporters that the 78-
year-old religious leader planned to
leave Paris according to schedule to
night, headed for Tehran to start re
placing the Bakhtiar government
with an Islamic republic.
"If we cannot land in Tehran we
will go to another airport in Iran, and
if we don't find one will come back
here," said Vazdi, who called the
flight "a calculated gamble."
In Tehran, demonstrations
erupted for and against the Bakhtiar
government. Hundreds of pro-
Khomeini demonstrators and about
1000 Bakhtiar backers hurled stones
at each other near the U.S. Embassy.
In Marrakech, the shah and his wife
Empress Farah posed for photo
graphers for 15 minutes in their first
public appearance since they arrived
in Morocco from Aswan, Egypt, two
days ago.
