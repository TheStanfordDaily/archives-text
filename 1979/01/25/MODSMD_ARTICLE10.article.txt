# Student dissatisfaction voiced
## Chicanos want 'cultural center' 
### LEAH HALPER 
"This university can be very
alienating, especially when
you're from a Chicano cul
ture," professes freshman
Rosana Madrid. "For a lot of
people beine apart from the
family is really traumatic, and
it's important to get a sense of
unity and support."
For Madrid and many other
members of the
University'sMexican-American
community, one way to make
an easier transition to college
life has been to participate in
the variety of activities spon
sored by Chicano graduate and
undergraduate organizations.
Until this month, the prog
rams were scattered about
campus. But after six years of

discussion between represen
tatives of the University and
the student groups, more than
a dozen academic and cultural
organizations have moved into
what some call the Chicano
Cultural Cciiitluiuicd in Ihc
renovated Nitery basement.
Some students complain,
however, that the University
has failed to provide adequate
space or funds for the center.
The students question whether
they should accept the reno
vated basement as a complete
"cultural center." The Univer
sity gave $89,000 for improve
ments in plumbing and walls,
according to Griselda Castro,
activities adviser for the Office
of Student Affairs and member
of the policy board which gov
erns the Chicano facility.
"The University seems to
have found an easy way out of
providing the Chicano com
munity with a 'cultural center,'
wrote Carlos Romero, a La
Onda editor, in a recent issue
of the Chicano publication.
"We have a 'cultural center'
which is deficient in more than
one way...most importantly it
lacks the backing of the
Chicano community (so) it...is
just another University
edifice."
Because of criticisms like th
ese, there has been no house
warming and the facilities will
not be formally dubbed until
after a naming contest has
been held to determine the
most appropriate title. Accord
ing to Castro, the Policy Board
will ultimately choose an offi
cial name.
"The community was con
fused at first and a lot of that is
lack of history. "We had to
touch on a lot of things just to
find this space," Castro said,
after explaining several false
starts made since fire dissolved
the Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA)
house in 1972, forcing Chicano
organizations to find a new
meeting place.
"We went through so many
different floor plans" she said.
"You have to learn the Univer
sity system — where to go,
where there's money. Maybe
30 different people have
worked on it."
Because there has been little
year-to-year continuity in
planning and goal formulation,
conflicts have arisen ever,
since the present Nitery prop
osal was submitted by students
in May 1977. At that time, Cas

tro says, the policy board
members debated whether
they should request that the
extra-departmental programs
(EDPs) such as SWOPSI, SCIRE,
and Undergraduate Specials,
aiso in the basement, reiocaie
to make room for their
Chicano center.
"Students at that time felt it
would be satisfactory if
SWOPSI and SCIRE moved out
as one option," Castro says.
"But you can't force them out
— there is no other place that
was acceptable to them at the
time, and the interim policy
board felt that it was more im
portant to retain good relations
with them. This year there was
a different group of people and
we had to go back and retrack
the decision-making process
of the interim board."
"It seems clear that the
group still wants our space,"
says Maria Chacon, SCIRE co
director. "As a student
centered organization we de
pend on being centrally lo
cated so it's important to have
space with easy access to
White Plaza. We did consider
other spare last year, but it
turned out not to be available. I
hope that bad feelings don't
develop between the Chicano
groups and the EDPs. We've
always worked well together,
and share some common go
als."
Romero explains that with
out wanting to "incriminate"
the EDPs, he believes that the
space now allocated won't
support the Barrio Assistance
Program, the Ballet Folklorico,
MEChA, Project Motivation,
Teatro Sin Virguenza, the
Chicano Graduate Studies Or
ganization, and many other
specialized Chicano projects.
"With the EDP space it would
be no problem," he insists.
Paid staffers are also needed to
man the facility, Romero adds.
"We know the facilities we
now have are not sufficient,"
said Director of the Office of
Chicano Affairs Maria Baeza. "I
think we have a basic agree
ment on need — we all want to
maximize the benefits of the
facilities. Now a discussion of
how to put that goal into prac
tice is important."
Baeza hopes that the work
towards a more comprehen
sive center will continue. "Year
after year this idea came up so
various deans realized it was

not a passing whim. Real in
volvement of students and
administrators and staff is what
did it. I think we've completed
the first phase and now we can
move on. Additional space may
be what we'll work for in the
second phase."
Besides housing campus or
ganizations, the Nitery, is
equipped with a kitchen and
darkroom. Baeza says that
programs such as a colloquium
series, poetry readings, and
community meetings will be
held there this year. "It's hard
to negate the fact that the phys
ical facilities are there," she
points out. "This is a good
basis and I don't think a split in
the (Chicano) community over
it is going to be a potentially
troubling issue."
But tor both Castro and
Baeza, other worries just as
troublesome are surfacing. "A
lot of groups have felt that
minority groups get all the
breaks so why doesn't
everyone else get a center like
this?" says Castro. According
to Baeza ethnic groups are also
asking questions, "There are
fears now that the Asian-
American students and the
Jewish students and the Iranian
students will all start making
incredible demands. I think it's
obvious that some students
need a center more than others
for survival on this campus,
and I think that has been rec
ognized by the University."
In fact, Baeza says, the ex
perience of Chicano students
may help other groups. "I
think there is a great solidarity
among students here and
Chicanos can provide an
example or leadership or assis
tance to any students who have
the same kind of needs."
According to one Chicano
student, "Right now it's just sit
ting there. No one's excited
about it — no one's saying
Wow, let's go to the cultural
center!' It doesn't have a heart
or a 50u1..."
Castro disagrees, "The
center is considered a key fac
tor in integrating the commun
ity at all levels, to promote the
welfare of the Chicano com
munity. This will hopefully be a
vehicle of communication
within the community and the
University, a vehicle for de
velopment and education. The
center will be more than a facil
ity where events are housed."
