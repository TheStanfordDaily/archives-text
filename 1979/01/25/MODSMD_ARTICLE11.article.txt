# Prof publishes work on insomniacs
## Sleep problems common, curable 
### ROBERT JAMES 
Insomnia is one of those
universal complaints; most
people have trouble getting to
sleep sometimes. Remedies
ranging from time-honored
warm milk and soothing music
to powerful and dangerous
drugs have been used, gener
ally with little long-term suc
cess.
But the insomniac's problem
is a psychological one, says
Education and Psychology
Prof. Carl Thoresen, and the
key to its solution lies in con
trolling attitudes and behavior.
He and a team of University re
searchers have developed a
self-management program to
help insomniacs help them
selves.
If you frequently have trou
ble gettingtoorgetting back to
sleep, you're in good com
pany, Thoresen says. Insomnia
ranks third (after the common
cold and headaches) of ail
ments for which professional
aid is most often sought.
Thoresen estimates that over
20 million Americans suffer
from chronic insomnia. Sleep
lessness isn't a problem that
concerns only overworked
executives, either: 30 percent
of the students at one Bay Area
high school Thoresen studied
had "sleeping problems" of
one kind or another.
The most common treat
ments administered by the suf
ferers, such as alcohol and
over-the-counter drugs, and
those prescribed by doctors,
such as barbituates and other
hypnotics, lead to depression
and eventual addiction. A to
lerance to sleeping pills de
velops, which leads the in
somniac to take more and
more drugs in order to sleep at
all.
In fact, drugs can actually in
terfere with the quality of
sleep. "Almost without excep
tion," Thoresen said, "chronic
use of drugs to deal with in

somnia will worsen the prob
lem."
The drugs "knock you un
conscious, all right," but they
reduce the amount of deep
sleep the ingester gets, espe
cially the important stage of
sleep characterized by rapid
eye movement (REM). Depriva
tion of REM sleep often leads to
daytime irritability, he added.
Furthermore, there is a
"REM rebound" effect which
makes kicking the sleeping pill
habit difficult. After an insom
niac stops taking a drug which
had deprived him of REM
sleep, he will experience it in
amounts far greater than nor
mal. This stage of sleep is as
sociated with active and vivid
dreams and Thoresen related
that some patients have had
such terrifying nightmares
after they stopped using sleep
ing pills that they went back to
them.
Thoresen and other
psychologists here are study
ing a non-drug program of be
havioral self-management of
insomnia under a grant from
the National Instituteof Mental
Health (NIMH). They work in
cooperation with the Sleep
Disorders Center of the Medi
cal School and members of its
faculty, such as Drs. William
Dement and Vincent Zarcone.
A program developed by
Thoresen and colleague
Thomas J. Coates has been
published in a 1977 book, How
to Sleep Better: A Drug-free
Program for Overcoming In
somnia.
Daytime stress is often as
sociated with insomnia, Thore
sen stated. It is important to
"put insomnia in a 24-hour
perspective," he emphasized.
"We encourage people to un
derstand what influences in
their daily lives may be sources
of stress." These influences
may come from a person's en
vironment and occupation,
Thoresen said, or they may be

products of the individual's
thoughts and actions.
Helping an insomniac get to
sleep is easy compared with
the job of helping that person
get back to sleep in the middle
of the night, Thoresen said. A
full program of muscular ten
sion and relaxation is recom
mended for getting to sleep,
but lots of movement after
waking up at 3 a.m. would only
make the insomniac more
awake. Instead, Thoresen ad
vocates "cognitive focusing"
— immediately telling yourself
to relax and stavcalm.
"Lack of confidence is a
major roadblock to progress"
in a self-management prog
ram, Thoresen added. The in
somniac has to have faith in his
ability to relax. To help the suf
ferer gain this confidence,
Coates and Thoresen suggest
enlisting the support of a
friend in planning and sticking
to his program. "Support like a
friend can give is hard to con
vey in a book," Thoresen said.
Insomnia as a disorder is not
fully understood, and no univ
ersal diagnosis or cure can be
offered. "We still treat every
person on an individual basis,"
Thoresen commented, comp
laining of the lack of "rigorous
studies" dealing with the effect
of daytime activities on night
time sleep.
Thoresen concedes that
there are some sleep disorders
that are not treatable by be
havior control alone. The
causes of some problems lie in
mysterious physical distur
bances, such as sleep apnea
(inability to sleep and breathe
at the same time) and nar
colepsy (unpredictable attacks
of paralysis and REM sleep).
But he doesn't think that
psychological methods are
completely without use in
these cases. If stimulant drugs
are now used to deal with nar
colepsy, he suggested why
not replace them with a prog

ram of stimulant therapy?
"We've had encouraging re
sults with hruxism (grinding of
teeth during sleep) by helping
people identify cues of be
havior" that are associated
with the disorder, Thoresen
said.
The psychologists' further
research plans, pending the
approval of another grant from
the NIMH, include a program
to help current users of sleep
ing pills to kick the habit, and
an intriguing investigation into
the effect of bed partners'
sleeping habits on one
another.
Thoresen and other sleep re
searchers have been greatly
aided by the recent develop
ment of a way to make record
ings of brain waves via tele
phone. The subject can have
his sleep patterns analyzed at
the laboratory while sleeping
in the more natural environ
ment of his own home.
Finally, Thoresen points out
that trouble getting to sleep or
getting enough sleep is truly
insomnia only if the individual
is unhappy about it. "You can
take hours to get to sleep and
only sleep four hours a night,
but if your sleeping problems
don't interfere with your daily
activities, you're not an insom
niac." One man cited by
Coates and Thoresen as per
fectly content with his sleep
habits sleeps only 15 to bO mi
nutes each night.

there are some sleep disorders
that are not treatable by be
havior control alone. The
causes of some problems lie in
mysterious physical distur
bances, such as sleep apnea
(inability to sleep and breathe
at the same time) and nar
colepsy (unpredictable attacks
of paralysis and REM sleep).
But he doesn't think that
psychological methods are
completely without use in
these cases. If stimulant drugs
are now used to deal with nar
colepsy, he suggested why
not replace them with a prog

ram of stimulant therapy?
"We've had encouraging re
sults with hruxism (grinding of
teeth during sleep) by helping
people identify cues of be
havior" that are associated
with the disorder, Thoresen
said.
The psychologists' further
research plans, pending the
approval of another grant from
the NIMH, include a program
to help current users of sleep
ing pills to kick the habit, and
an intriguing investigation into
the effect of bed partners'
sleeping habits on one
another.
Thoresen and other sleep re
searchers have been greatly
aided by the recent develop
ment of a way to make record
ings of brain waves via tele
phone. The subject can have
his sleep patterns analyzed at
the laboratory while sleeping
in the more natural environ
ment of his own home.
Finally, Thoresen points out
that trouble getting to sleep or
getting enough sleep is truly
insomnia only if the individual
is unhappy about it. "You can
take hours to get to sleep and
only sleep four hours a night,
but if your sleeping problems
don't interfere with your daily
activities, you're not an insom
niac." One man cited by
Coates and Thoresen as per
fectly content with his sleep
habits sleeps only 15 to bO mi
nutes each night.
Insomnia is one of those
universal complaints; most
people have trouble getting to
sleep sometimes. Remedies
ranging from time-honored
warm milk and soothing music
to powerful and dangerous
drugs have been used, gener
ally with little long-term suc
cess.
But the insomniac's problem
is a psychological one, says
Education and Psychology
Prof. Carl Thoresen, and the
key to its solution lies in con
trolling attitudes and behavior.
He and a team of University re
searchers have developed a
self-management program to
help insomniacs help them
selves.
If you frequently have trou
ble gettingtoorgetting back to
sleep, you're in good com
pany, Thoresen says. Insomnia
ranks third (after the common
cold and headaches) of ail
ments for which professional
aid is most often sought.
Thoresen estimates that over
20 million Americans suffer
from chronic insomnia. Sleep
lessness isn't a problem that
concerns only overworked
executives, either: 30 percent
of the students at one Bay Area
high school Thoresen studied
had "sleeping problems" of
one kind or another.
The most common treat
ments administered by the suf
ferers, such as alcohol and
over-the-counter drugs, and
those prescribed by doctors,
such as barbituates and other
hypnotics, lead to depression
and eventual addiction. A to
lerance to sleeping pills de
velops, which leads the in
somniac to take more and
more drugs in order to sleep at
all.
In fact, drugs can actually in
terfere with the quality of
sleep. "Almost without excep
tion," Thoresen said, "chronic
use of drugs to deal with in

somnia will worsen the prob
lem."
The drugs "knock you un
conscious, all right," but they
reduce the amount of deep
sleep the ingester gets, espe
cially the important stage of
sleep characterized by rapid
eye movement (REM). Depriva
tion of REM sleep often leads to
daytime irritability, he added.
Furthermore, there is a
"REM rebound" effect which
makes kicking the sleeping pill
habit difficult. After an insom
niac stops taking a drug which
had deprived him of REM
sleep, he will experience it in
amounts far greater than nor
mal. This stage of sleep is as
sociated with active and vivid
dreams and Thoresen related
that some patients have had
such terrifying nightmares
after they stopped using sleep
ing pills that they went back to
them.
Thoresen and other
psychologists here are study
ing a non-drug program of be
havioral self-management of
insomnia under a grant from
the National Instituteof Mental
Health (NIMH). They work in
cooperation with the Sleep
Disorders Center of the Medi
cal School and members of its
faculty, such as Drs. William
Dement and Vincent Zarcone.
A program developed by
Thoresen and colleague
Thomas J. Coates has been
published in a 1977 book, How
to Sleep Better: A Drug-free
Program for Overcoming In
somnia.
Daytime stress is often as
sociated with insomnia, Thore
sen stated. It is important to
"put insomnia in a 24-hour
perspective," he emphasized.
"We encourage people to un
derstand what influences in
their daily lives may be sources
of stress." These influences
may come from a person's en
vironment and occupation,
Thoresen said, or they may be

products of the individual's
thoughts and actions.
Helping an insomniac get to
sleep is easy compared with
the job of helping that person
get back to sleep in the middle
of the night, Thoresen said. A
full program of muscular ten
sion and relaxation is recom
mended for getting to sleep,
but lots of movement after
waking up at 3 a.m. would only
make the insomniac more
awake. Instead, Thoresen ad
vocates "cognitive focusing"
— immediately telling yourself
to relax and stavcalm.
"Lack of confidence is a
major roadblock to progress"
in a self-management prog
ram, Thoresen added. The in
somniac has to have faith in his
ability to relax. To help the suf
ferer gain this confidence,
Coates and Thoresen suggest
enlisting the support of a
friend in planning and sticking
to his program. "Support like a
friend can give is hard to con
vey in a book," Thoresen said.
Insomnia as a disorder is not
fully understood, and no univ
ersal diagnosis or cure can be
offered. "We still treat every
person on an individual basis,"
Thoresen commented, comp
laining of the lack of "rigorous
studies" dealing with the effect
of daytime activities on night
time sleep.
Thoresen concedes that
there are some sleep disorders
that are not treatable by be
