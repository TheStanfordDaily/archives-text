# Editors' perspective
## Sexism and the Daily 
### 
Two weeks ago, the Daily published a
cartoon by Gil Morales which some
members of the community found of
fensive. Since publication, a debate has
ensued about the role of the Daily in
publication of advertising, cartoons and
other editorial material.
At the outset, we regret that any
reader was offended by anything in our
publication. Contrary to public belief,
the editorial staff does review content,
and it is our policy to attempt to be sensi
tive to views of all segments of our com
munity. Unfortunately, despite our best
efforts, we do not believe it will ever be
possible to have a publication which
never offends anyone. We are in fact not
convinced that such is a desirable end.
We do feel it is important to state our
current policy concerning submitted
columns, cartoons and letters. Opinions
expressed in such pieces are the opin
ions solely of the artist or author. It is
simply inaccurate to ascribe any state
ments made in published opinions
material to the Daily as a group, any
member of its staff, any advertiser or any
other contributor. This policy is clearly
stated in our staff box every day.
We grant that some editorial discre
tion is used in choosing the opinions to
be published. Moreover, we grant that
cartoons do have special impact because
they are visual commentaries that run
every day. Still, we do not believe that
running cartoon strips, whether syndi
cated or generated within the commun
ity, implies Daily sanction of the opin
ions stated therein. We also cannot ac
cept that cartoons regarded by some as
sexist are open only to that interpreta
tion.
Nonetheless, we cannot definitively
state that we have been totally sensitive
to female and minority issues. We be
lieve we have come a long way in the past
few years (witness the number of
women in the staff box for volume 175
and the number of articles dealing with
women's issues), but we believe there is
still a long way to go.
Therefore, in response to a recom
mendation from the group of feminists
who spoke with us on these issues last
week, the Daily will organize an advisory
committee, made up of members of the
minority communities here, to advise
editorial personnel on content issues.

We expect this committee to be or
ganized within a week. Its first task will
be to help develop wording for a stated
policy for us to use when dealing with
minority issues in reporting or business
activities It is our belief that many points
of such a policy — such as equal
employment opportunity, equal cover
age or minority-related events, and
placement of news based on its news
value, not on its relationship to minority
issues — will have been standard proce
dure here anyway. The policy will simply
serve to get these procedures on paper.
It should be noted that the advisory
board will be just that — advisory. It is
the Daily editorial staff's firm belief that
every decision regarding content must
ultimately rest with the editor and his
staff.
The Daily continues to maintain the
policy of giving preference on opinions
pages to persons holding views on di
verse subjects, giving special preference
to those presenting opposing view
points on issues presentea in ourpages.
The Daily will continue to publish un
popular, potentially offensive, material
on the opinions page. It is our view that
such a practice is the best way to ensure
that all viewpoints have a vehicle for pre
sentation. By refusing to publish some
opinions, we open ourselves to the po
tential attack that we are deliberately
withholding certain views. Therefore, as
has been our practice in the past, unless
an opinion could be reasonably consi
dered to be libelous or blatantly offen
sive to a substantial segment of the Uni
versity population, we will not withhold
it from publication.
While we recognize the vagueness of
the statement, we find it difficult to ex
press our view in more concrete terms
than these. Let it suffice to say that very
few contributions have been considered
"blatantly offensive" using our "stan
dards."
Nonetheless, we appreciate all com
ments from the community on our oper
ation. After three meetings with a
feminist group, we think it is fair to say
that everyone involved has learned
something valuable from the experi
ence.
