Senate not
constructive
I have refrained until now
from commenting on the dis
pute over whether the ASSU
Senate was fair or unfair, re
sponsible or irresponsible, in
its resolution about Hospital
billing practices. However,
Peter Stamos' column (Daily,
Jan. 23) requires at the very
least a response to one specific
part which Stamos and other
senators have repeatedly cited
in defense of their action,
namely, my own appearance
before the senate earlier in the
year.
Stamos and his colleagues
appear to think that a single
question and answer in the
course of an hour-long discus
sion of a wide-range of sub
jects is important evidence that
the senate took pains to hear
the "other side." I do not. In
deed, the very fact that
senators can suggest that it
does demonstrates the super
ficiality of theirapproach to the
whole matter.
In recent months I have sat in
meetings in which lawyers, ac
countants, medical school fa
culty and hospital adminis
trators have spent hours trying
to puzzle through the thicket
of Medicare and MediCal regu
lations in an effort to under
stand what they require of the
University and how our own
practices may vary from those
requirements.

It is not easy; that the senate
believed that it understood the
issues well enough to legislate
on them speaks volumes about
the senate, but sheds no light
on the matters which it pur
ported to address.
Personally I resent having my
meeting with the senate used
in this way. More importantly, I
do not see the senate's action
as a constructive contribution
to the solution of some very
important and complicated
matters.

No Coors ads
It is ironic that the Daily will
accept advertising from Coors,
a corporation that denies basic
human rights to their
employees, and yet claims to
follow a policy of rejecting ra
cist and sexist stereotypes in
other advertising. The latter is
commendable; however, it still
seems hypocritical that the
Daily accepts Coors ads in light
of the Daily policy against of
fensive ads.
Since the early 1960s, Coors
has required lie detector tests
as a condition of employment.
Workers are put in a "catch 22"
position of answering under a
lie detector the question:
"Have you ever committed an
illegal act which went unde
tected?"
I am sure not any of the Daily
staff can truthfully onswer no
to that question. The use of lie

detectors at Coors is a continu
ing condition of employment
not just part of the hiring pro
cess.
Workers can be fired for
making remarks negative to
their employers or the pro
ducts of Coors off the job. The
lie detector tests can be used to
catch such offenders.
Of course, the wrong
answers to these Orwellian
quizzes need not result in ter
mination. They can and are
used selectively to weed out
union organizers trying to pro
tect human rights.
Advertising from such anti
human firms may not violate
the letter of Daily policy. If not,
a new policy is called for.

Editor's note: The Daily's ad
vertising policy states, "The
Daily will not publish ads
whose content tends to incite
to violence, is obscene or
libelous, or casts aspersions on
individuals or groups because
of race, religion, sex, sexual
preference, national origin,
age or physical disability."
Obviously a picture of a
Coors can does not fall under
this description. This policy
was adopted in 1976 by the Dai
ly's Board of Directors when
the Daily decided to allow
Gallo wines to advertise during
the United Farm Workers strike
against that firm.
The Daily is not prepared to
play watchdog over every firm
that advertises with us. To fol
low up every complaint against
specific firms would be unpro
ductive and take away our val
uable time in publishing a qual
ity product.
It is the readers' right to make
up their own minds whether a
firm is operating in a good or
bad manner, not the Daily's
right to decide that for them. If
the opponents of Coors or any
other firm wish to buy advertis
ing or submit opinions pieces
critical of that firm, they have
that right.
But the Daily believes it
should not be restricting any
advertiser as long as the ad it
self is m good taste. Although
some members of the Daily
staff believe the Daily should
be more socially conscience in
determining who advertises,
most staffers and the Board of
Directors believe the present
advertising policy is a sound
one.

Ethnic theme
houses
How can "ethnic houses
polarize the campus" when, as
Kichard Wohl (Daily, )an. 22)

points out, 90 percent of ethnic
minorities do not live in theme
houses? How can Wohl dismiss
"cultural i nsensitivity" and
"ethnic identity" as
"sanctimony" while making a
fine display of the former and
showing ignorance of the lat
ter? Finally, in researching a
piece on theme houses, how
can he neglect Junipero, the
Asian American theme dorm?
As a "non-ethnic" who lived
in Junipero for two years, I feel
I gained a lot from the experi
ence; I just wish Wohl had cal
led on me. In a University that
is overwhelmingly white, al
ternative viewpoints are valu
able in developing true
perspective. From my two
years in Junipero I gained an
awareness of Asian American
culture and history and a
higher degree of sensitivity to
racism. (Yes, it does exist, even
in this "open-minded" univer
sity.
Wohl considers ethnic sol
idarity a frightening concept;
he patronizingly looks for ways
that minorities can "fit into the
framework" of the Stanford
community. Expression of
ethnicity does not threaten the
University; rather the Univer
sity threatens ethnic identity,
and theme houses offer an av
enue for minorities to assert
the validity of their identity and
culture.
For Wohl, despite his initial
misgivings, I suggest Junipero,
Ujamaa or Casa Zapata would
be a great place to spend his
senior year.

Overactive
imagination
It was with much regret that I
saw James MacNelly's cartoon
"poking fun" at Khomeini
(Daily, Jan. 22). I can only con
clude that MacNelly is ignorant
about Islam. The cartoon
reads: "Lop off his hand and
sew his lips together! It is writ
ten," apparently as a punish
ment for drinking in public.
Cutting hands is a punish
ment for stealing when several
criteria are met, one of which is
that the offender must be
shown to have committed the
act, not because of hunger, but
for the sole purpose of satisfy
ing his lust. Sewing the lips is a
punishment that exists in the
cartoonist's mind only. Where
"it is written" proves MacNel
ly's total ignorance.
The sources for Islamic ordi
nances are well-known, and it
is the opinion of several legis
lators that the Islamic laws are
the best for human beings
when honestly applied. All
heavenly religions — Judaism,

Christianity and Islam — pre
' scribe various punishments for
evil actions such as murder,
theft, drunkiness, etc.
Why is Islam always chosen
to be the subject of ridicule? If
MacNelly wanted to attack Is
lam, let it be based in an accu
rate analysis of Islamic law, not
in fabrications from his overac
tive imagination.

Church and state
James Pinkerton is to be
commended for his column
(Daily, Jan. 17). In it, he states
for the first time, so far as I
know, a doctrinal position for a
religious organization that re
ceives its revenues from re
plies to advertisements offer
ing to send official ministerial
credentials to anyone in ex
change for a dollar. These ad
vertisements, often found in
pulp magazines, encourage
readers to become "ministers"
for the very tax breaks that Pin
kerton decries in his column.
But of course, this does not
address the question of
whether such tax breaks are
justified. Fortunately, I did not
have to search further than
Pinkerton's column to find an
answer.
If it is true, as he states, that
"the power to tax is the power
to destroy," then isn't it obvi
ous that to tax religions would
be to subject them to the col
lective force of the political
machine? Is that the way to
separate more perfectly the
power of church and state, or
would it merely make state the
master? I think the answer is
obvious.
Pinkerton forgets that con
tributions to churches are vol
untary; no one is threatening
with jail for failing to pay their
tithe or offering. Religious
programming is "forced" onto
television by the FCC, because
television stations are keepers
of the jftiblic airwaves, and
people with religious beliefs
are a substantial part of that
public.
Pinkerton raises serious
questions about the trespasses
of organized religion in Ameri
can societies. There indeed
may be an "incestuous rela
tion" between the two; Pinker
ton doesn't convince me,
though. But to subject religion
to government taxation seems
to me to be the quickest way to
create such a relationship bet
ween the two, or the easiest
way to maintain it.

Workers are put in a "catch 22"
position of answering under a

"Have you ever committed an

I am sure not any of the Daily

to that question. The use of lie

detectors at Coors is a continu

not just part of the hiring pro

Workers can be fired for

Editor's note: The Daily's ad
vertising policy states, "The
Daily will not publish ads
whose content tends to incite
to violence, is obscene or
libelous, or casts aspersions on
individuals or groups because
of race, religion, sex, sexual
preference, national origin,
age or physical disability."
Obviously a picture of a
Coors can does not fall under
this description. This policy
was adopted in 1976 by the Dai
ly's Board of Directors when
the Daily decided to allow
Gallo wines to advertise during
the United Farm Workers strike
against that firm.
The Daily is not prepared to
play watchdog over every firm
that advertises with us. To fol
low up every complaint against
specific firms would be unpro
ductive and take away our val
uable time in publishing a qual
ity product.
It is the readers' right to make
up their own minds whether a
firm is operating in a good or
bad manner, not the Daily's
right to decide that for them. If
the opponents of Coors or any
other firm wish to buy advertis
ing or submit opinions pieces
critical of that firm, they have
that right.
But the Daily believes it
should not be restricting any
advertiser as long as the ad it
self is m good taste. Although
some members of the Daily
staff believe the Daily should
be more socially conscience in
determining who advertises,
most staffers and the Board of

Ethnic theme
houses
How can "ethnic houses
polarize the campus" when, as
Kichard Wohl (Daily, )an. 22)

points out, 90 percent of ethnic
minorities do not live in theme
houses? How can Wohl dismiss
"cultural i nsensitivity" and
"ethnic identity" as
"sanctimony" while making a
fine display of the former and
showing ignorance of the lat
ter? Finally, in researching a
piece on theme houses, how
can he neglect Junipero, the
Asian American theme dorm?
As a "non-ethnic" who lived
in Junipero for two years, I feel
I gained a lot from the experi
ence; I just wish Wohl had cal
led on me. In a University that
is overwhelmingly white, al
ternative viewpoints are valu
able in developing true
perspective. From my two
years in Junipero I gained an
awareness of Asian American
culture and history and a
higher degree of sensitivity to
racism. (Yes, it does exist, even
in this "open-minded" univer
sity.
Wohl considers ethnic sol
idarity a frightening concept;
he patronizingly looks for ways
that minorities can "fit into the
framework" of the Stanford
community. Expression of
ethnicity does not threaten the
University; rather the Univer
sity threatens ethnic identity,
and theme houses offer an av
enue for minorities to assert
the validity of their identity and
culture.
For Wohl, despite his initial
misgivings, I suggest Junipero,
Ujamaa or Casa Zapata would
be a great place to spend his
senior year.

Overactive
imagination
It was with much regret that I
saw James MacNelly's cartoon
"poking fun" at Khomeini
(Daily, Jan. 22). I can only con
clude that MacNelly is ignorant
about Islam. The cartoon
reads: "Lop off his hand and
sew his lips together! It is writ
ten," apparently as a punish
ment for drinking in public.
Cutting hands is a punish
ment for stealing when several
criteria are met, one of which is
that the offender must be
shown to have committed the
act, not because of hunger, but
for the sole purpose of satisfy
ing his lust. Sewing the lips is a
punishment that exists in the
cartoonist's mind only. Where
"it is written" proves MacNel
ly's total ignorance.
The sources for Islamic ordi
nances are well-known, and it
is the opinion of several legis
lators that the Islamic laws are
the best for human beings
when honestly applied. All
heavenly religions — Judaism,

Christianity and Islam — pre
' scribe various punishments for
evil actions such as murder,
theft, drunkiness, etc.
Why is Islam always chosen
to be the subject of ridicule? If
MacNelly wanted to attack Is
lam, let it be based in an accu
rate analysis of Islamic law, not
in fabrications from his overac
tive imagination.

Church and state
James Pinkerton is to be
commended for his column
(Daily, Jan. 17). In it, he states
for the first time, so far as I
know, a doctrinal position for a
religious organization that re
ceives its revenues from re
plies to advertisements offer
ing to send official ministerial
credentials to anyone in ex
change for a dollar. These ad
vertisements, often found in
pulp magazines, encourage
readers to become "ministers"
for the very tax breaks that Pin
kerton decries in his column.
But of course, this does not
address the question of
whether such tax breaks are
justified. Fortunately, I did not
have to search further than
Pinkerton's column to find an
answer.
If it is true, as he states, that
"the power to tax is the power
to destroy," then isn't it obvi
ous that to tax religions would
be to subject them to the col
lective force of the political
machine? Is that the way to
separate more perfectly the
power of church and state, or
would it merely make state the
master? I think the answer is
obvious.
Pinkerton forgets that con
tributions to churches are vol
untary; no one is threatening
with jail for failing to pay their
tithe or offering. Religious
programming is "forced" onto
television by the FCC, because
television stations are keepers
of the jftiblic airwaves, and
people with religious beliefs
are a substantial part of that
public.
Pinkerton raises serious
questions about the trespasses
of organized religion in Ameri
can societies. There indeed
may be an "incestuous rela
tion" between the two; Pinker
ton doesn't convince me,
though. But to subject religion
to government taxation seems
to me to be the quickest way to
create such a relationship bet
ween the two, or the easiest
way to maintain it.

Senate not
constructive
I have refrained until now
from commenting on the dis
pute over whether the ASSU
Senate was fair or unfair, re
sponsible or irresponsible, in
its resolution about Hospital
billing practices. However,
Peter Stamos' column (Daily,
Jan. 23) requires at the very
least a response to one specific
part which Stamos and other
senators have repeatedly cited
in defense of their action,
namely, my own appearance
before the senate earlier in the
year.
Stamos and his colleagues
appear to think that a single
question and answer in the
course of an hour-long discus
sion of a wide-range of sub
jects is important evidence that
the senate took pains to hear
the "other side." I do not. In
deed, the very fact that
senators can suggest that it
does demonstrates the super
ficiality of theirapproach to the
whole matter.
In recent months I have sat in
meetings in which lawyers, ac
countants, medical school fa
culty and hospital adminis
trators have spent hours trying
to puzzle through the thicket
of Medicare and MediCal regu
lations in an effort to under
stand what they require of the
University and how our own
practices may vary from those
requirements.

It is not easy; that the senate
believed that it understood the
issues well enough to legislate
on them speaks volumes about
the senate, but sheds no light
on the matters which it pur
ported to address.
Personally I resent having my
meeting with the senate used
in this way. More importantly, I
do not see the senate's action
as a constructive contribution
to the solution of some very
important and complicated
matters.

Ethnic theme
houses
How can "ethnic houses
polarize the campus" when, as
Kichard Wohl (Daily, )an. 22)

points out, 90 percent of ethnic
minorities do not live in theme
houses? How can Wohl dismiss
"cultural i nsensitivity" and
"ethnic identity" as
"sanctimony" while making a
fine display of the former and
showing ignorance of the lat
ter? Finally, in researching a
piece on theme houses, how
can he neglect Junipero, the
Asian American theme dorm?
As a "non-ethnic" who lived
in Junipero for two years, I feel
I gained a lot from the experi
ence; I just wish Wohl had cal
led on me. In a University that
is overwhelmingly white, al
ternative viewpoints are valu
able in developing true
perspective. From my two
years in Junipero I gained an
awareness of Asian American
culture and history and a
higher degree of sensitivity to
racism. (Yes, it does exist, even
in this "open-minded" univer
sity.
Wohl considers ethnic sol
idarity a frightening concept;
he patronizingly looks for ways
that minorities can "fit into the
framework" of the Stanford
community. Expression of
ethnicity does not threaten the
University; rather the Univer
sity threatens ethnic identity,
and theme houses offer an av
enue for minorities to assert
the validity of their identity and
culture.
For Wohl, despite his initial
misgivings, I suggest Junipero,
Ujamaa or Casa Zapata would
be a great place to spend his
senior year.

Overactive
imagination
It was with much regret that I
saw James MacNelly's cartoon
"poking fun" at Khomeini
(Daily, Jan. 22). I can only con
clude that MacNelly is ignorant
about Islam. The cartoon
reads: "Lop off his hand and
sew his lips together! It is writ
ten," apparently as a punish
ment for drinking in public.
Cutting hands is a punish
ment for stealing when several
criteria are met, one of which is
that the offender must be
shown to have committed the
act, not because of hunger, but
for the sole purpose of satisfy
ing his lust. Sewing the lips is a
punishment that exists in the
cartoonist's mind only. Where
"it is written" proves MacNel
ly's total ignorance.
The sources for Islamic ordi
nances are well-known, and it
is the opinion of several legis
lators that the Islamic laws are
the best for human beings
when honestly applied. All
heavenly religions — Judaism,

Christianity and Islam — pre
' scribe various punishments for
evil actions such as murder,
theft, drunkiness, etc.
Why is Islam always chosen
to be the subject of ridicule? If
MacNelly wanted to attack Is
lam, let it be based in an accu
rate analysis of Islamic law, not
in fabrications from his overac
tive imagination.

Church and state
James Pinkerton is to be
commended for his column
(Daily, Jan. 17). In it, he states
for the first time, so far as I
know, a doctrinal position for a
religious organization that re
ceives its revenues from re
plies to advertisements offer
ing to send official ministerial
credentials to anyone in ex
change for a dollar. These ad
vertisements, often found in
pulp magazines, encourage
readers to become "ministers"
for the very tax breaks that Pin
kerton decries in his column.
But of course, this does not
address the question of
whether such tax breaks are
justified. Fortunately, I did not
have to search further than
Pinkerton's column to find an
answer.
If it is true, as he states, that
"the power to tax is the power
to destroy," then isn't it obvi
ous that to tax religions would
be to subject them to the col
lective force of the political
machine? Is that the way to
separate more perfectly the
power of church and state, or
would it merely make state the
master? I think the answer is
obvious.
Pinkerton forgets that con
tributions to churches are vol
untary; no one is threatening
with jail for failing to pay their
tithe or offering. Religious
programming is "forced" onto
television by the FCC, because
television stations are keepers
of the jftiblic airwaves, and
people with religious beliefs
are a substantial part of that
public.
Pinkerton raises serious
questions about the trespasses
of organized religion in Ameri
can societies. There indeed
may be an "incestuous rela
tion" between the two; Pinker
ton doesn't convince me,
though. But to subject religion
to government taxation seems
to me to be the quickest way to
create such a relationship bet
ween the two, or the easiest
way to maintain it.

Senate not
constructive
I have refrained until now
from commenting on the dis
pute over whether the ASSU
Senate was fair or unfair, re
sponsible or irresponsible, in
its resolution about Hospital
billing practices. However,
Peter Stamos' column (Daily,
Jan. 23) requires at the very
least a response to one specific
part which Stamos and other
senators have repeatedly cited
in defense of their action,
namely, my own appearance
before the senate earlier in the
year.
Stamos and his colleagues
appear to think that a single
question and answer in the
course of an hour-long discus
sion of a wide-range of sub
jects is important evidence that
the senate took pains to hear
the "other side." I do not. In
deed, the very fact that
senators can suggest that it
does demonstrates the super
ficiality of theirapproach to the
whole matter.
In recent months I have sat in
meetings in which lawyers, ac
countants, medical school fa
culty and hospital adminis
trators have spent hours trying
to puzzle through the thicket
of Medicare and MediCal regu
lations in an effort to under
stand what they require of the
University and how our own
practices may vary from those
requirements.

It is not easy; that the senate
believed that it understood the
issues well enough to legislate
on them speaks volumes about
the senate, but sheds no light
on the matters which it pur
ported to address.
Personally I resent having my
meeting with the senate used
in this way. More importantly, I
do not see the senate's action
as a constructive contribution
to the solution of some very
important and complicated
matters.

No Coors ads
It is ironic that the Daily will
accept advertising from Coors,
a corporation that denies basic
human rights to their
employees, and yet claims to
follow a policy of rejecting ra
cist and sexist stereotypes in
other advertising. The latter is
commendable; however, it still
seems hypocritical that the
Daily accepts Coors ads in light
of the Daily policy against of
fensive ads.
Since the early 1960s, Coors
has required lie detector tests
as a condition of employment.
Workers are put in a "catch 22"
position of answering under a
lie detector the question:
"Have you ever committed an
illegal act which went unde
tected?"
I am sure not any of the Daily
staff can truthfully onswer no
to that question. The use of lie

detectors at Coors is a continu
ing condition of employment
not just part of the hiring pro
cess.
Workers can be fired for
making remarks negative to
their employers or the pro
ducts of Coors off the job. The
lie detector tests can be used to
catch such offenders.
Of course, the wrong
answers to these Orwellian
quizzes need not result in ter
mination. They can and are
used selectively to weed out
union organizers trying to pro
tect human rights.
Advertising from such anti
human firms may not violate
the letter of Daily policy. If not,
a new policy is called for.
Bob Britton

Editor's note: The Daily's ad
vertising policy states, "The
Daily will not publish ads
whose content tends to incite
to violence, is obscene or
libelous, or casts aspersions on
individuals or groups because
of race, religion, sex, sexual
preference, national origin,
age or physical disability."
Obviously a picture of a
Coors can does not fall under
this description. This policy
was adopted in 1976 by the Dai
ly's Board of Directors when
the Daily decided to allow
Gallo wines to advertise during
the United Farm Workers strike
against that firm.
The Daily is not prepared to
play watchdog over every firm
that advertises with us. To fol
low up every complaint against
specific firms would be unpro
ductive and take away our val
uable time in publishing a qual
ity product.
It is the readers' right to make
up their own minds whether a
firm is operating in a good or
bad manner, not the Daily's
right to decide that for them. If
the opponents of Coors or any
other firm wish to buy advertis
ing or submit opinions pieces
critical of that firm, they have
that right.
But the Daily believes it
should not be restricting any
advertiser as long as the ad it
self is m good taste. Although
some members of the Daily
staff believe the Daily should
be more socially conscience in
determining who advertises,
most staffers and the Board of
Directors believe the present
