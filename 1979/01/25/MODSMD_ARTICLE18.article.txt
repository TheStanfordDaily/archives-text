## Taxation blindly accepted theft 
### 
As April 15 approaches, it is
interesting to see how Ameri
cans have been conditioned to
accept the moral validity of ta
xation without question. Taxa
tion is simply seen as one more
duty owed to one's fellow citi
zens (or as my recent tax final
exam put it: "voluntary con
tributions to the collective");
this most fundamental issue of
whether taxes can indeed be
justified is simply assumed
away.

Taxation is a fundamentally
immoral act — the forcible tak
ing of a person's earnings for
the use of another — and it
must be justified in that con
text. The only difference bet
ween an Internal Revenue Ser
vice (IRS) agent demanding
your money, while threatening
you with jail, and a robber on
the street demanding your
money, while pointing a gun at
you, is the perceived legiti
macy of "government."

But how valid is this distinc
tion? For too long, people have
blindly accepted the mere as
sertion of the legitimacy of
government. Carter, Brown,
et. a!., never have to defend
the moral basis of the be
hemoths which they com
mand; it is simply assumed to
be self-evident. Starting with
one's first lesson in civics class
in a government-operated
school, one is expected to be
lieve in the government as god.
The perversity of this
phenomenon has been high
lighted by the metastasizing
growth in the sheer number of
governmental entities. Federal
and state governments. Reg
ional governments. County
and city governments. School
and water districts. Mosquito
districts. Community college
districts. And so on. All claim to
embody the "will of the
people," and to therefore pos
sess the moral authority to tax,
regulate and "do good."
Is there a principled differ
ence between an agent of one
of these groups taking your
money, and a common thief
doing so? In both cases, the in
dividual finds his rights viol
ated; coercion is applied to
force him to relinquish his
property. Therefore if there is a
difference, it must be on the
other side of the equation —
the thief only represents him
self, while the government
supposedly represents "the
people."
Yet does the mere fact that a
group of people want to limit
your rights shift the moral
equities so? Taxation abrogates
a person's fundamental right to
use his earnings as he wishes,
and also his right to abstain
from the activities of others.
Taxation is in effect a draft —
different only in degree from
mandatory national service: a
draft requires that you turn
your entire life over to the gov
ernment, while taxation
merely requires that you turn
about 42 percent of your life
over to the government.
Such fundamental rights
should not yield easily. If there
is an argument for the legiti
macy of government, it is valid
only where some sort of collec
tive action is absolutely neces
sary — not where people sim
ply want to pass the cost off on
everyone else, lust because a
majority of the people want to
build a civic center, give

everyone a Porsche, or build a
$42 million monument to Frank
Delano Roosevelt (as the In
terior Department is planning),
doesn't give them the right to
force you to help do so, or to
subsidize it.
Vet unfortunately, most
people never give a second
thought to forcibly taking tax
payers' moneytodoall manner
of things which in no way re
quire collective intervention.
The multitude of "legitimate"
governments are therefore re
lentlessly trampling over indi
vidual rights for absolutely in
defensible purposes.
The state government pays
artists to play instruments for
dolphins and builds unneces- "
sary government buildings,
without any principled justifi- „
cation. And local governments «
run services like garbage col
lection, which can even be per
formed more cheaply and effi- -
ciently by private firms. And so
on.
The argument for the legiti
macy of government is
strongest where "collective
goods" are concerned. Since
such goods would theoreti
cally not be produced without
a government, despite the fact
that they "should be," there is
a much stronger justification
for subordinating individual
rights to that need.
However, many of the
"common goods" would
nonetheless be produced in
some degree — witness charit
able giving to schools and pov
erty organizations, despite
high taxation. Moreover, does
every "need" of this sort really
justify forcing people to par
ticipate?
The hardest cases are those
where liberty would most
likely diminish if the goods
were not produced — such as a
judicial system and a national
defense of some sort. At this
juncture, reality probably must
step in to temper idealism.
However, except possibly in
the most extreme cases, there
is no justification for subjugat
ing the individual's personal
rights to the desires of the mas
ses. Taxation is, pure and sim
ple, theft; government has for
too long been unchallenged in
its claim to moral legitimacy. It
is time that the baseness of that
claim be laid bare.
