## Ballet/joan harris AMAN dance coming to Stanford 
### 
The color and excitement of authentic folk dances from around
the world will come to campus tomorrow evening when Lively
Arts presents AMAN, the American International Folk Ballet.
AMAN will give a free workshop from 2 to 4 p.m. in Roble studio,
followed by a performance at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
The evening's program presents an extensive and varied selec
tion of ethnic dances.
Following the performance, from about 10:30 p.m. on, there
will be a party and potluck for the company in Roble gym. There
will be dancing with live music provided by NAMA, AMAN's
band. Anyone interested in attending the party is asked to donate
food for the potluck, and should call Sarah Wright at 327-4408 for
details.
Based in Los Angeles, AMAN started out small at UCLA in 1964,
but has grown into a large and respected professional troupe.
AMAN's repertoire contains dances from the Slavic and Balkan
regions, the Middle East, Africa and the United States. The com
pany travels with more than 70 musical instruments including
such exotic things as the gudulka, the saz, the Ijerica, and the
hemanje, as well as better known instruments.
AMAN's concern for authenticity extencte beyond musical ac

companiment to the company's collection of close to 2000 cos
tumes. The collection includes hundreds of authentic costumes,
and, where originals are not available, copies have been made
exact in every detail. This means that a costume change may be
time consuming if a costume has many pieces. Plus the women
must often change their hairstyles between numbers.
Great care also goes into choreographic research. Barry Class,
one of AMAN's artistic directors, believes that, "It is not enough
to know songs and dances. Customs, beliefs, foodways, folktales
â€” all of these, and more, apply."
Class has been involved in music and dance for many years,
and has pursued graduate studies in classics and folklore. He
joined AMAN in 1968, and was appointed artistic director in 1978,
a position he shares with Leona Wood. Class is a dance teacher
and continues to perform regularly with AMAN. Wood has
danced "command" performances for many notables, and is
primarily responsible for AMAN's Middle Eastern and African
repetoire which she researches, choreographs and costumes.
AMAN is the second group.in this year's Lively Arts dance
series. Be sure to not forget Houle and Wibaux, mimes on Feb
ruary 3 and Pilobolus on March 3.
