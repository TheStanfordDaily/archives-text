## Just a little bit of the '60s 
### 
American Dreams is the
title of (esse Colin Young's
iatest album (Elektra/
Asylum Records), and the
theme is a good one. The
music is also good, clearly a
product of hard work and
creative, professional musi
cianship. A talented writer
and performer, )esse has
surrounded himself with a
group of artists whose dis
cipline and skill produce a
very tight sound.
Loud and clear
"It's the greatest band I
could ever imagine having,"
says Jesse. In concert
|an. 19 at the Keystone
Palo Alto, their music
flowed loud and clear, with
that special, even quality
that reveals every person in
the band to be an excellent
musician.
Jesse's set was preceded
by two vastly inferior
groups, the first of which
was made up of a bassist, a
drummer., a guitarist, and
four (count 'em, four)
female vocalists in matching
spicy outfits. Their music
was a loud and unlikely
combination of punk, pop
and the Pointer Sisters, but
outrageous enough to be
well-received.
The second band was just
plain LOUD, and their hard
rock sound was not quite
what the audience had
come for. The Keystone, it
seemed, wanted Jesse to
come on after 11:30 p.m. to
help boost business at the
bar, and thus this band's
too-long set was followed

by a much-too-long break.
When )esse finally did
appear, and the melody of
"Morning Sun" spread
through the audience, I re
membered what I was doing
there. I was there to hear a
'60s musician who is still
producing quality music,
and who still somewhat val
ues the dreams and spirit of
those times.
All but two of the songs
he plaved were from Song
for uli and American

Dreams. We heard the en
tire "American Dreams
Suite," which comprises
half of his new album, five
songs in sequence, filled
with the imagery of per
sonal and social changes.
A poetical/musical
documentary of hopes and
disappointments, "The
Suite" reaches out to urge
the pursuit of dreams.
In an interview after the
show, I asked Jesse about
dreams and their meaning
to him as illustrated in "The

Suite."
"There's something mag
ical in the sharing of energy,
dreams," says (esse. He en
joys the "intense experi
ence" of performing music
for people who have come
to hear him, although there
is an element of uncertainty
as to what their reaction will
be. However, "there's no
real joy without risk," ac
cording to lesse.
For him, a magical energy
is shared through music.
And for others? "From PTAs
to unions," he says, "unless
we actively pursue our
dreams, we end up with
other people's dreams.
Back seat
"The original American
dream of individualism is
kind of taking a back seat to
consumerism . . . materials
are an end in themselves.
The society we've created is
trying to program us like
computers, but the great
materialistic dream of this
country isn't satisfying — it
doesn't make us feel alive."
A blue-eyed man with a
glass of beer in one hand
and a cigarette in the other,
Jesse Colin Young didn't
seem too different from the
average good guy.
Fie spoke of the '60s
spirit, saying "everyone felt
it come, and felt it go, al
most as if the dream was kil
led, by assassinations and
war. . But in listening to
the music, speaking with
him, and thinking about his
"Suite," I felt a little bit of
the feeling come again.

groups, the first of which
was made up of a bassist, a
drummer., a guitarist, and
four (count 'em, four)
female vocalists in matching
spicy outfits. Their music
was a loud and unlikely
combination of punk, pop
and the Pointer Sisters, but
outrageous enough to be
well-received.
The second band was just
plain LOUD, and their hard
rock sound was not quite
what the audience had
come for. The Keystone, it
seemed, wanted Jesse to
come on after 11:30 p.m. to
help boost business at the
bar, and thus this band's
too-long set was followed

by a much-too-long break.
When )esse finally did
appear, and the melody of
"Morning Sun" spread
through the audience, I re
membered what I was doing
there. I was there to hear a
'60s musician who is still
producing quality music,
and who still somewhat val
ues the dreams and spirit of
those times.
All but two of the songs
he plaved were from Song
for uli and American

Dreams. We heard the en
tire "American Dreams
Suite," which comprises
half of his new album, five
songs in sequence, filled
with the imagery of per
sonal and social changes.
A poetical/musical
documentary of hopes and
disappointments, "The
Suite" reaches out to urge
the pursuit of dreams.
In an interview after the
show, I asked Jesse about
dreams and their meaning
to him as illustrated in "The

Suite."
"There's something mag
ical in the sharing of energy,
dreams," says (esse. He en
joys the "intense experi
ence" of performing music
for people who have come
to hear him, although there
is an element of uncertainty
as to what their reaction will
be. However, "there's no
real joy without risk," ac
cording to lesse.
For him, a magical energy
is shared through music.
And for others? "From PTAs
to unions," he says, "unless
we actively pursue our
dreams, we end up with
other people's dreams.
Back seat
"The original American
dream of individualism is
kind of taking a back seat to
consumerism . . . materials
are an end in themselves.
The society we've created is
trying to program us like
computers, but the great
materialistic dream of this
country isn't satisfying — it
doesn't make us feel alive."
A blue-eyed man with a
glass of beer in one hand
and a cigarette in the other,
Jesse Colin Young didn't
seem too different from the
average good guy.
Fie spoke of the '60s
spirit, saying "everyone felt
it come, and felt it go, al
most as if the dream was kil
led, by assassinations and
war. . But in listening to
the music, speaking with
him, and thinking about his
"Suite," I felt a little bit of
the feeling come again.
