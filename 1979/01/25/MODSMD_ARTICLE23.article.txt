The Best of Sequoia Prose
Sequoia
The publication of the Stan
ford Literary Magazine's 25-
year retrospective issue in
spires me to make three or four
uncontrolled generalizations
about, of all things, America.
First, I would argue that a ten
dency toward acute self
consciousness seems to be a
central factor in most areas of
American life of the last decade
or so, but that this introspec
tion has not outlived its useful
ness. Americans persist in re
evaluating their ideological,
political and social positions
even as the "Me Decade"
winds down, and there is still
no end in sight. Yet, not having
come to any satisfying
answers, the self analysis, rang
ing from est to foreign policy
readjustments, goes on, and
this is all for the best.
These grandiose pro
nouncements come by way of
introduction to a complimen
tary review of Sequoia's 25-
year retrospective issue, pub
lished last quarter and now on
sale in the Bookstore for $2.
The 70 pages of prose exposi
tion, fiction and interviews of
major literary and political fi
gures are a stimulating anthol
ogy which deserves a generally
curious reader's investigation
as well as the attention of those
already converted to the liter
ary scene. The issue derives
'.'much of its value from the
eloquence and shrewd percep
tions of its contributors, who
are mostly natives of the Stan
ford community.
Self-analysis
More importantly, though,
this reviewer was struck by the
extent to which the contem
porary tendency of self
analysis permeated its pages.
Particularly, the challenge
comes from Marxist political
thinkers, highly "moral" re
ligious organizations, and
other camps for whom
"bourgeois literature" has lost
its value. By beginning to ans
wer questions of its own value,
by approaching a definition of
literature on modern terms,
the Sequoia retrospective
merits reading by both literary
cultists and anyone curious
enough to read the 70 pages of
good prose. The editors of

Sequoia have earned my praise
for putting together this con
scientious and thoughtful col
lection.
One of the surprising and
enjoyable aspects of the Re
trospective is that it contains
two pieces which address con
crete political questions. The
anthology greets us with "His
tory is the Man" — an interview
with the late Alexander
Kerensky, provisional Prime
Minister of Russia between the
1917 Revolution and Lenin's
takeover. Kerensky appears in
the interview as a slightly can
tankerous old man with unique
opinions on modern politics.
He addresses a world in "acon
tinual state of crisis with the

atomic bomb as stimulus," and
goes on in his cranky manner
(his dialect is preserved by the
editors) to remind us that in the
illogical currents of human his
tory, the illogical force of
human will still makes all the
difference.
Eugene Burdick, in his "The
Danger of Politics" follows this
idea up with a similarly com
mitted political perspective. In
his youth as in our own, he tells
us that "everyone around con
sidered an interest in politics
on the part of a student to be a
kind of pathology. . ." and ad
vises that "the only thing
dangerous about politics is not
to be in it."
After these pieces, the
Sequoia turns to reflect upon
the literary method of explain
ing the world. Mark Schroer
explains "Why We Really
Read," but in unsatisfying
terms.
The final essay in the anthol
ogy, by Wallace Stegner, is a
similar apology for literature,
done with more verve and wit

than Schroer's piece. Stegner
addresses his thoughts to an
anonymous lady "admirer"
who had sent him a shoe rag,
with which to clean out his
mind, a New Testament, with
which to purify his soul, and a
note advising him to, in es
sence, begin work as soon as
possible, before he teaches
any more impressionable stu
dents the "filth" infesting crea
tive writing classes. It is a dras
tic sort of challenge Stegner
must meet, but he does so with
wisdom and humor. ..If I
attempted to communicate
abominations," he appeals, "I
am pretty sure that within mi
nutes they would be teaching
me."
It is impossible to present
fairly each of the impressive 10
entries which Sequoia has cho
sen to represent its last 25
years. Certainly there are
works which deserve honora
ble mention. J.V. Cunningham
creates a fascinating piece of
fiction in "The Journal of John
Cardan."
Guerard
The collection also contains
good fiction by Albert Guerard
and John L'Heureux, both
Stanford professors, an inter
view with the always interest
ing John Cheever, and a piece
on Ivor Winters by Allen Tate.
One piece which does not at
tempt to define itself in rela
tion to other social considera
tions, as the works above have
done, is an interview with M.
Scott Momaday. This discus
sion dragsa reader into dreamy
and poetic land where only
Momaday and his admittedly
powerful imagination exist in a
neo-primitive narcissism.
While the showing is not ab
solutely overwhelming, it cer
tainly opened up a few doors in
my own stale attic of a mind.
One note of dissatisfaction —
dates of publication, tacked
onto the individual pieces,
would have made reading sim
ply more interesting and pro
vided some sort of historical
perspective. Vet, it is finally a
meritorious and valuable col
lection.
The Sequoia's next issue will
be entirely composed of stu
dent writing, and the desper
ate editors will welcome any
contributions, poetry or prose,
until Feb. 5. There will also bea
"reading" for student poets
about a week before that, and
interested poets should con
tact Michael Prince at the
Sequoia office, upstairs in the
Storke Publications Building..
Staff meetings are Monday
night, 7:30 p.m.
