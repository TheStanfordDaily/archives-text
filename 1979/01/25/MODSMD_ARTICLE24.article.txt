## Entertainment, Entertainment 
### 
All jokes about the re
dundancy in its title aside,
Stanley Donen's Movie,
Movie is a pretty fine piece
of entertainment. Movie,
Movie is the best parody of
old-movie conventions (and
perhaps the only one worth
seeing) since Mel Brooks'
fine Young Frankenstein of
several seasons ago. Not
surprisingly, these movies
share a common approach
to their satire: under a ven
eer of wisecracks and abys
mal puns, the two films re
veal a great deal of affection
for the genre forms they're
spoofing.
Movie, Movie is, in fact,
two movies. One, a boxing
Cinderella story, is called
Dynamite Hands. The
other, a musical, is called
Baxter's Beauties of 1933.
The pair is introduced by a
prologue given by George
Burns, a survivor of chang
ing styles in entertainment if
there ever was one. Burns
reminisces of the days of the
'30s double-feature, when
most movies were in black
and-white, except for the
occasional musical which
wold break out in a rash of
glorious technicolor.
Though the two parodies
share the look of films from

* the '30s, their plots aren't in
terconnected. They do,
however, use the same casts
j. and some of the same sets.
George C. Scott, who turns
out to be an unexpectedly
+ spry comedian, and Trish
+ Van Devere, a little less
* comfortable in her two
* roles, get top billing; the
* other members of Donen's

ensemble include Barbara
Harris, Red Buttons, Art
Carney and the irrepressi
ble Eli Wallach.
Both films on Movie,
Movie's double-bill are re
leased by an imaginary pro
duction company called
Warren Studios. This is a
twist on the distributor of
Movie, Movie, Warner

Brothers, now a gigantic
communications company,
but known in the '30s
primarily for its distinctive
gangster films.
Dynamite Hands effec
tively captures the seamy
feeling of Warner's black
and-white melodramas.
Screenwriters Larry Gelbart
and Sheldon Leonard have

come up with a scenario
about a man who boxes to
get enough money for his
sister's eye operation. The
laughs come from a collec
tion of the most inspired
double-talk since the
Watergate hearings.
Donen
Director Donen made his
reputation in the '40s and

'50s with the musicals he di
rected for producer Arthur
Freed at MCM. Two of his
films — Singing in the Rain
and Seven Bridges for Seven
Brothers — have been cited
as being among the best
musicals Hollywood ever
put out. In Movie, Movie's
second half, Baxter's
Beauties of 1933, it is clear

that Donen relishes the
chance to return to his favo
rite genre. Dynamite Hands
is a fast-paced roast of
movie cliche, but BB of 1933
is more of an evocation of a
genre than a parody of it.
Michael Kidd, who can be
seen in Dynamite Hands as
Pop Popchick, did the
choreography for BB of

1933. Kidd worked on sev
eral of Donen's musicals; it
was he who was responsible
for Seven Brides for Seven
Brothers' dynamic
designed-for-the-camera
choreography. It is clear in
Movie, Movie that the pair
enjoyed their chance to re
establish a working rela
tionship. The result is a
celebration x of the musical
form rather than a satire of
it.

A hit
It's been a long time, but
Stanley Donen finally has a
hit on his hands. The direc
tor tried, but couldn't do it a
few years ago with Lucky
Lady; he failed before that
with 1973's bomb The Little
Prince. Donen hasn't had a
truly successful film since
1961 and a film called
Charade, which had Cary
Grant and Audrey Hepburn
in the leads. Now, with
another film that's doing
great at the box-office, it will
be interesting to see what
Donen does with his new
found popularity. Will he
have another 17-year slump,
or is it just possible that
Donen might revive the
musical as suitable enter
tainment for the '70s and
'80s?


George C. Scott and Trish Van Devere play widely different charac
ters in Movie, Movie. Scott and Devere portray both a Broadway
producer and actress in the film's musical extravaganza section
(above), and an impoverished fighter's jilted sweetheart and manager
in the boxing world story (below). Movie, Movie is now playing at the
Cinema 21 in San Francisco.
