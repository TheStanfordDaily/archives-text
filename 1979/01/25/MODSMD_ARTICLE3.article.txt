# 'Sheer luck' made dark gay
## GPU hears gay psychologist 
### ROBIN MILLINGTON 
"I would have a fit if anyone told
me being gay is just like being nor
mal," Dr. Don Clark said at an infor
mal discussion at the Gay People's
Union last night.
Don Clark, a gay psychologist who
practices both in Menlo Park and San
Francisco, and leads gi oups for gays,
gay parents and gay families in Los
Angeles, spoke to a group of about
30 people about various aspects of
being gay.
Clark said he felt people learn
much more about themselves and
human interactions by going
through the gay experience rather
than by being straight.
Regarding the process of "coming
out" Clark suggested that "If you
can't stand staying in anymore, come
out. If you don't have to come out,
stay in." ,
He explained that because of the
disruption of personal or profes
sional relationships sometimes ex
perienced when a gay person
"comes out" that it is not bad to re
main quiet unless the person is pre
pared to deal with the possible emo
tional strains.
Lose relationship
He also said "You have to be pre
pared to lose a close relationship,"
but if that relationship ends, the
other person never loved the real
you but rather loved the fantasy you
created." He recommended that gay
people in the process of "coming

out" make sure they have a number
of gay friends to support them and to
hold their hands during the period.
Clark said that it is impossible to
know what causes a person to be
homosexual.
"There have got to be a hundred
thousand variables involved before
you are five years old," he explained.
"There are so many of those fac
tors it really is parallel to going and
finding out what makes people
heterosexual."
Factors
Social conditioning and biochemi
cal factors are two of the many
reasons involved, according to
Clark.
"If you want to know what made
me gay, it was sheer luck," Clark
added with a smile.
Turning to San Francisco's Castro
Street, Clark said, "Castro Street is
one playground in the city where
gays can go to enjoy themselves."
The so-called Castro ghetto is a
"wonderful idea. Every immigrant
group needs a ghetto," he said. "To
have a place where you can go to
where you're in the majority is ter
rific."
He added he would like to see San
Francisco attract gays from all over
the country.
Gay parents
The idea of a single gay parent rais
ing children was also discussed.
"One of the things that has
touched me most working with gay

people is those people who want to
be parents," Clark said.
Hands were raised and many in the
group indicated a desire to raise
children. Clark said that it is now
possible for single gay parents to
adopt.
Extending the concept of family
further, Clark said that he sees
groups such as last night's audience
"adopting each other" and creating a
supportive family structure for one
another.
Psychologists
When asked how gay people can
find gay psychologists, Clark re
sponded that "loc ally it's not a prob
lem, almost everyone nowadays
knows one and can give people their
name."
Clark also said, "We
(psychologists) have an informal
network, which I can't believe is still
working because there are so many
of us. I wish there were a national
register for such a thing."
Clark was also asked how to find a
gay doctor in the area. He said that
no doctors in the area are willing to
be listed.
Doctors afraid
"I must know at least 15 physicians
in this area of the peninsula who are
gay and who are afraid that they will
lose their business and lose their
livelihood," Clark added.
He said that groups of gay phvsi
cians are open in San Francisco and
he said he is really surprised that in
this area — close as it is to the city —
physicians are still reluctant to be
"open."'
A new book by Clark, tentatively
titled Gay We Crow, will be pub
lished in September.
Clark is one of five advisers for
Lonnie Nungesser, a senior here

who was recently awarded the Cay
Academic Union's first national scho
larship.
Nungesser, an active member and
organizer of the GPU said that there
are between 30 and 50 people who
actively participate in the organiza
tion but said there are many more
gays on campus.
"Stanford is not a positive envi
ronment for gay people," he said.
