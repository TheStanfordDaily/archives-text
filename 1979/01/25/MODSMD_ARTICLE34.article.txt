Pope will mediate territory dispute
Vatican City — On the eve of a week-long papal trip to
Latin America, the Vatican said yesterday Pope )ohn Paul
II will mediate a Chilean-Argentine dispute that had
raised fears of armed conflict.
Vatican observers agreed the role was a "gamble" for
the new pope.
The Rev. Romeo Panciroli, chief Vatican spokesman,
announced the pope accepted the two South American
countries' request to help settle the dispute over territ
ory at the southern tip of the continent.
Panciroli did not say when the mediation effort would
begin. Italian Cardinal Antonio Samore shuttled bet
ween Chile and Argentina last month laying the
groundwork for the effort. The 73-year-old cardinal has
said representatives might come to Rome for future
talks.
Samore has proposed a demilitarized zone for the
disputed area. Chile would keep three uninhabited is
lands granted by a British arbitration team in 1977 and
Argentina would get enclaves on nearby islands and
Cape Horn.
Church members protest receiver
Pasadena — As hundreds of protesters unknowingly
cheered, the man they had tried to keep out of the
headquarters of their Worldwide Church of Cod for
almost two days was escorted into the building yester
day by one of the church's highest officials.
The nearly 400 men, women and children who had
slept, ate, worshipped and waited in the church offices
did not recognize court-appointed receiver Steven
Weisman when he walked into the building behind

popular church leader Stanley Rader.
Unaware that it was Weisman who had entered the
building with Rader, most of the protestors resumed
listening to a phone hookup speech by founder Herbert
Armstrong from Tucson, Ariz.
Temple got child foster care money
Washington — A congressional panel, opening hear
ings on child abuse, announced yesterday it is investigat
ing whether as many as 150 foster care childen were
placed in the Peoples Temple before the mass murder
suicide last November in Guyana.
'Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said that at his request,
the General Accounting Office (GAO) is examining
county foster care records in California and the list of the
dead from )onestown, the jungle commune founded by
temple leader )im lones.
"If names turn up on both lists,' Cranston said, "it
means the Rev. |im lones may have received hundreds
of thousands of dollars in government child support and
that some of those children died in the lonestown
tragedy."
Cranston said one such death already has been ver
ified. He did not identify the victim.
New snows cripple Midwest again
Wind-swept snows dealt another severe blow to crip
pled Chicago and paralyzed much of the Midwest yes
terday, while gale-force winds and tornadoes wrecked
dozens of homes on Florida's Gulf Coast.
In Nebraska, where cattle are dying of starvation, Gov.
Charles Thone signed an emergency proclamation dis
patching National Guard helicopters and trucks to

evacuate stranded farmers and open roads to get food to
the stricken herds.
Paul Saftig, the mayor of Kenosha, Wis. summed up
the feelings of millions of storm-weary Midwesterners
who awoke to find a heavy blanket of snow on top of that
left by a fierce blizzard a week and a half ago.
"We had it just on the brink of being cleaned up, and
now we have to start over," he said. "The men are tired,
the machinery is tired and I'm tired. I keep praying to St.
jude, the patron ot hopeless cases but he hasn't
helped."
A cold front pushing toward the Great Lakes region
dumped . inches of new snow on Chicago, where 20
inches fell 11 days ago.
Prices 9 percent above last year's
Washington — California's tax-cutting Proposition 13
helped slow inflation in December, but consumer prices
still rose 9 percent during 1978, the second biggest leap
in 30 years, the government reported yesterday.
The Labor Department also reported that a typical
American wage-earner fell behind in the race to keep up
with inflation in 1978, as workers' real buying power
declined 3.4 percent on the average during the year.
The inflation rate for the year, fueled by sharp in
creases for food, housing and medical care, was the
highest since a 12.2 percent rise in 1974, when the
economy was reacting to soaring prices forimported oil.
Food prices were up 1 1.6 percent in 1978, housing
costs 9.9 percent and medical care 8.8 percent. The
year's biggest bargain was clothing, which rose only 2
percent.
Excluding 1974, the last time consumer prices rose as
much as 9 percent in a year was 1947.

Food price increase to slow down
Consumers who stretched their dollars last year to
cover the biggest increase in food prices since 1974
should see some slowdown in the inflation rate in com
ing months.
That is the view of government experts who predict a
1979 food price increase of 6 percent to 10 percent,
compared to 1978's nearly 12 percent rise, announced
yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Government officials and industry spokesmen alike
warn that factors such as the weather and the success or
failure of President Jimmy Carter's anti-inflaton program
could mean increases higher or lower than predicted.
They note that early in 1978, economists were estimating
a food price rise only half as large as the one that actually
occurred.
