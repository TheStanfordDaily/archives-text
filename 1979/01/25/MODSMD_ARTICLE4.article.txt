# Student satisfaction with advising here increases
## 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
"The general advising program
here is really designed to provide
each student with a broad range of
academic information," according to
Elizabeth Meyer, director of the
Academic Information Center (AIC)
and assistant dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
Meyer and Physics Prof. Alexander
Fetter, associate dean of Under
graduate Studies, co-authored a
recently-published report which
analyzed the results of the 1977-78
General Adviser Evaluation Survey.
An entering freshman here is as
signed an adviser based upon his ex
pressed preliminary interest in one
of five major fields: humanities, so
cial science, natural science/
mathematics/technology, engineer
ing or pre-medicine. An advising
team is associated with each dormit
ory containing freshmen residents to
offer counseling until the time the
student declares a major.
According to the study, students
nationwide voice criticism concern
ing advising every year. Despite the
existence of vastly different advising
methods among U.S. universities,
Fetter said that students everywhere
complain. In response, authorities at
the AIC and the office of the Vice
Provost and Dean of Undergraduate
Studies initiated a system designed
to solicit student feedback last year.
All students were asked to com
plete a brief questionnaire when
they declared a majorat the AIC. Fet
ter said the survey will continue for at
least another year.
Several general trends emerged
from the compilation of survey re
sults obtained between Oct. 1, 1977
and )une 30, 1978.
Scores
Of the 1193 students who filled out
the form, 56 percent had a faculty
member adviser and 43 percent had a
staff member. The staff members

scored slightly higher than their fa
culty counterparts on five items mea
sured on a 1 to 5 scale: the adviser's
contribution to the coherence of the
student's program, the adviser's con
tribution to the choice of a major, the
adviser's knowledge of the Universi
ty's program in the student's area of
preliminary academic interest, the
overall quality of the advice received
and the human quality of the
adviser-student relationship.
The Meyer-Fetter report compared
results from the five major academic
areas and discovered that students in
engineering, social science and
humanities were generally more
satisfied with their advisers' perfor
mance than were undergraduates in
the natural science and pre-med
areas.
Fetter and Meyer both noted a
problem inherent in obtaining
natural science advisers. Faculty ad
visers are volunteers recruited by
their respective departments, and
they fulfill these responsibilities in
place of some other department ac
tivity such as departmental advising
or committee membership,
explained Meyer.
Monopolized
One junior physics major said that
much of a natural science adviser's
time is monopolized by research. Re
ferring to his general adviser, a re
searcher at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, the student said, "I
never saw him."
A junior mathematical sciences
major, referring to an adviser not in
the student's field, added "he did
not know specifics and could not
comprehend that my interest had
changed since completing the intro
ductory form in high school."
Most staff advisers are either re
cent University graduates who are
familiar with the undergraduate cur
riculum, or senior administrators in
terested in extensive student con

tact, the report stated.
According to Fetter, pre-medical
advising involves a complex balanc
ing of the opportunities presented
by an on-campus hospital and the
medical experts' unfamiliarity with
the academic community and
events. Meyer said many students
may be discouraged by the Medical
Center's relatively isolated position
on the campus. But she commended
the 60 current pre-med advisers for
their "tremendously willing spirit."
Overall, a majority of the respond
ing students gave average or better
ratings to their advisers in three
areas. Knowledge in the student's
area of preliminary academic interest
received 6.3 percent favorable rat
ings, the overall quality of the advice
had 71 percent and the "human qual
ity" of the relationship took 81 per

cent.
The report juxtaposed these out
comes with the 1977-78 Senior Sur
vey to which 43 percent of the
graduating class replied. Only 30
percent of the seniors classified their
freshman advisers good, very good
or excellent.
Need little advice
Fetter said that he held the "impre
ssion that some students don't need
much advising." Meyer said that it is
difficult to determine the number of
students who come here with defi
nite academic plans.
A senior history major termed his
freshman adviser, a history profes
sor, "a good guy." However, the
student added "I knew what I was
going to do, so I didn't need him."
The report revealed a surprising
dearth of adviser contribution to the

declaration of a major. Adviser help
in this field was considered below
average by 60 percent of the respon
dents.
Felt horrible
A junior French major said she did
not depend upon her general adviser
in choosing her major but "felt hor
rible giving him up for my real ad
viser."
This year an experiment in peer
advising was begun in Trancos. Fet
ter said that he was hopeful to ex
pand this program and noted a
"quantitative improvement in satis
faction" resulting from freshmen
counseling by upperclass volun
teers.
Meyer stressed the importance
"for students to realize the flexibility
of Stanford's official services and in
dividual advising."

The report juxtaposed these out
comes with the 1977-78 Senior Sur
vey to which 43 percent of the
graduating class replied. Only 30
percent of the seniors classified their
freshman advisers good, very good
or excellent.
Need little advice
Fetter said that he held the "impre
ssion that some students don't need
much advising." Meyer said that it is
difficult to determine the number of
students who come here with defi
nite academic plans.
A senior history major termed his
freshman adviser, a history profes
sor, "a good guy." However, the
student added "I knew what I was
going to do, so I didn't need him."
The report revealed a surprising
dearth of adviser contribution to the

declaration of a major. Adviser help
in this field was considered below
average by 60 percent of the respon
dents.
Felt horrible
A junior French major said she did
not depend upon her general adviser
in choosing her major but "felt hor
rible giving him up for my real ad
viser."
This year an experiment in peer
advising was begun in Trancos. Fet
ter said that he was hopeful to ex
pand this program and noted a
"quantitative improvement in satis
faction" resulting from freshmen
counseling by upperclass volun
teers.
Meyer stressed the importance
"for students to realize the flexibility
of Stanford's official services and in
dividual advising."
"The general advising program
here is really designed to provide
each student with a broad range of
academic information," according to
Elizabeth Meyer, director of the
Academic Information Center (AIC)
and assistant dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
Meyer and Physics Prof. Alexander
Fetter, associate dean of Under
graduate Studies, co-authored a
recently-published report which
analyzed the results of the 1977-78
General Adviser Evaluation Survey.
An entering freshman here is as
signed an adviser based upon his ex
pressed preliminary interest in one
of five major fields: humanities, so
cial science, natural science/
mathematics/technology, engineer
ing or pre-medicine. An advising
team is associated with each dormit
ory containing freshmen residents to
offer counseling until the time the
student declares a major.
According to the study, students
nationwide voice criticism concern
ing advising every year. Despite the
existence of vastly different advising
methods among U.S. universities,
Fetter said that students everywhere
complain. In response, authorities at
the AIC and the office of the Vice
Provost and Dean of Undergraduate
Studies initiated a system designed
to solicit student feedback last year.
All students were asked to com
plete a brief questionnaire when
they declared a majorat the AIC. Fet
ter said the survey will continue for at
least another year.
Several general trends emerged
from the compilation of survey re
sults obtained between Oct. 1, 1977
and )une 30, 1978.
Scores
Of the 1193 students who filled out
the form, 56 percent had a faculty
member adviser and 43 percent had a
staff member. The staff members

scored slightly higher than their fa
culty counterparts on five items mea
sured on a 1 to 5 scale: the adviser's
contribution to the coherence of the
student's program, the adviser's con
tribution to the choice of a major, the
adviser's knowledge of the Universi
ty's program in the student's area of
preliminary academic interest, the
overall quality of the advice received
and the human quality of the
adviser-student relationship.
The Meyer-Fetter report compared
results from the five major academic
areas and discovered that students in
engineering, social science and
humanities were generally more
satisfied with their advisers' perfor
mance than were undergraduates in
the natural science and pre-med
areas.
Fetter and Meyer both noted a
problem inherent in obtaining
natural science advisers. Faculty ad
visers are volunteers recruited by
their respective departments, and
they fulfill these responsibilities in
place of some other department ac
tivity such as departmental advising
or committee membership,
explained Meyer.
Monopolized
One junior physics major said that
much of a natural science adviser's
time is monopolized by research. Re
ferring to his general adviser, a re
searcher at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, the student said, "I
never saw him."
A junior mathematical sciences
major, referring to an adviser not in
the student's field, added "he did
not know specifics and could not
comprehend that my interest had
changed since completing the intro
ductory form in high school."
Most staff advisers are either re
cent University graduates who are
familiar with the undergraduate cur
riculum, or senior administrators in
terested in extensive student con

tact, the report stated.
According to Fetter, pre-medical
advising involves a complex balanc
ing of the opportunities presented
by an on-campus hospital and the
medical experts' unfamiliarity with
the academic community and
events. Meyer said many students
may be discouraged by the Medical
Center's relatively isolated position
on the campus. But she commended
the 60 current pre-med advisers for
their "tremendously willing spirit."
Overall, a majority of the respond
ing students gave average or better
ratings to their advisers in three
areas. Knowledge in the student's
area of preliminary academic interest
received 6.3 percent favorable rat
ings, the overall quality of the advice
had 71 percent and the "human qual
ity" of the relationship took 81 per

cent.
