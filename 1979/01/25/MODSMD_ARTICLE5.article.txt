# Doubts cast on surveys' validity

### REBECCA MOSS 
Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard, and
Michigan have the most distin
guished university faculties in the
country according to a recent survey
conducted by Seymour Lipset, polit
ical science and sociology professor
here, and Everret Ladd of the Univer
sity of Connecticut.
In the survey, Stanford faculty
ranked first in business, education,
and psychology, and second in en
gineering and medicine.
Discussing the practicality of sur
veys of this type, Lipset, a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institute, said
"universities havea problem evaluat
ing their faculty. Every department
will attempt to convince the ad
ministration that they are really very
good.
"They need to see what other
people think of the quality of their
faculty â€” which departments are

good and which departments are not
so good," he said.
Sally Daniels, a researcher who
worked on the survey, said, "Of
fhand I can't think of why anyone
else outside of academics would use
it."
Long series
The survey "is one in a long series
of surveys that attempt to make an
estimate of the relative quality of
education. It demonstrates that we
are doing well," said President
Richard Lyman.
"You must take all surveys of this
type with a grain of salt. There is al
ways a time lag. You can never calib
rate something based on opinion,"
he said.
Commenting on the University's
use of the survey, Lyman said, "You
will see it in The Observer which is
sent to faculty trustees and alumni."
But, he said, "I would like to keep the

institutional bragging within limits."
Bob Henkle, an investment banker
for Warburg-Paribas-Becker Inc. and
a former recruiter, said, "There have
been a number of surveys which rank
the schools. They receive a large
amount of publicity.
Funding for surveys like the
Lipset-Ladd survey comes from or
ganizations such as the National Sci
ence Foundation, The Sloan Com
mission, and The Smith-Richardson
Foundation.
Sloan Commission
Linda Vowquiski, of the Sloan
Commission on Government and
FHigher Education, explained why the
Commission gave money to the
Lipset-Ladd project. "We needed
some information and they were the
best source.
"We wanted to look at the at
titudes of academia towards gov
