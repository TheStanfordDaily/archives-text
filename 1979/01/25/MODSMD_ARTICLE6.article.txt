# Marguerite service successful

"It reminds me of being in the city instead of a farm. I ride it a
lot, especially when it's raining, "a young man clad in a business
suit riding Marguerite said recently.
Students and administrators alike have found Margu
erite, an experimental bus service started in January
1976, "quite successful," said Alan Cummings, logistics
operations manager. The fleet, operated through con
tract by Peninsula Charter Lines (PCL) has continually
expanded and now accommodates 50,000 students a
month on three routes.
"The Marguerite permits people to make a mid-day
trip and not move their car," said Bob Hamrdla, chair
man of Committee on Parking and Transportation. He
said he was pleased with the total ridership and "intellig
ible schedule."
The shuttle bus costs the University 33 cents per rider
and is funded both from revenues collected through the
sale of parking stickers and the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Last year the cost per rider ranged from 24 to 41 cents,
fluctuating throughout the year. Approximately 33,000
passengers rode the Marguerite each month last year,
with a total of almost 400,000 for the year.
Originally, the University purchased the small com
pact red and white buses for a limited route that covered
only Serra Street. Once the service was expanded to
include Tresidder and Stanford Shopping Center routes,

three additional vehicles were needed.
Mike Demeter, operator of Peninsula Charter Lines,
cited two problems with the Marguerite buses.
Not suitable
"When the little Marguerite buses were first purch
ased, the University didn'tget any technical advice. They
are not designed for the Stanford campus and won't
stand up to the rigors of a stop and start schedule,"
explained Demeter.
"Secondly, Stanford expanded the service on an ex
perimental basis. Admittedly, the ones I rent them are
old and meant for short duration. If they elected to
continue the expanded service, they ought to buy new
buses," he said.
One of the problems of purchasing new equipment is
time. "You don't just go to a showroom and pick one
out. It takes six to eight months to procure a new bus,''
Demeter said.
New buses
Hamrdla said the University is "looking at buying new
equipment." Demeter would continue to supply the
drivers and furnish mechanics, but Hamrdla stressed the
University was "too dependent" on PCL.
]ohn Pipkin, University Traftic Manager, outlined
some obstacles in the negotiations for new vehicles. He
said his "primary consideration" is to accommodate the
increasing number of handicapped students and faculty
here.
