Hughes is at the center of a virtual explosion of electronic information. It arises from a
combination of data sensing, communications, and data processing and storage We make
sensors that operate on all parts of the electronic spectrum. We make computers and signal
processors that tie all these together —that issue commands, or that store and present data
for a growing number of uses. It is a technological revolution that is only just beginning to
realize its potential to benefit people everywhere. one of the most pivotal, exciting periods
in all human history.
If you're an EE, ME, AE. lE, Physics, Material Science or Computer Science major,
you could become part of all this. Areas of interest include aerospace, ground systems,
industrial electronics, space and communications and pi
research. But don t worry about getting lost; we work in , _ mgm
small groups where individual initiative is valued highly. [ H \9 ■■ EL !
