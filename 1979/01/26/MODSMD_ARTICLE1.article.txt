# Arjay Miller holds post 10 years
## Business School dean resigns 
### JIM TRANQUADA 
In a surprise move yesterday, Arjay
Miller announced he will resign as
Dean of the Graduate School of Bus
iness on July 1, exactly 10 years after
he assumed the post.
Miller, under whose leadership
the Business School has consistently
been rated number one nationally,
told a specially convened faculty
meeting at the school that his 10
years as dean were long enough.
"President Lyman has said some
thing to the effect that a University
should not be a comfortable place,"
he said. "Well.. I was getting a little
too comfortable."
Miller also cited the fact that the
CSB's three top associate deans were
either retiring orgoing back to teach
ing and that his resignation would
allow the school to rebuild its leader
ship "from the top down."
Miller said he does not intend to
leave his home in Woodside and has
no plans to take a full-time job.
Standing ovation
The assembled faculty gave Miller
a standing ovation at the end of the
short meeting.
President Richard Lyman, who first
learned of Miller's intention to resign
last Tuesday, told the meeting of his
surprise when Miller told him of his
plans.
"All my anguished outcry moved

the man not one whit," he said. "He
had decided, and that was that."
In Miller's three-paragraph letter
of resignation, he said simply, "Now
is an appropriate time for new lead
ership, and to facilitate the transi
tion, I am resigning. . .
Lyman praised Miller's record as
dean, citing in particular the large
increase in minority and women stu
dents at the CSB.
Indebted to Miller
"The entire University is indebted
to Arjay Miller for his leadership in
that rise to greatness that can so eas
ily be made to appear inexorable,
part of some natural process, but
which of course could have hap
pened only with inspired direction
and drive from the top,'' Lyman said.
Lyman said Associate Dean Robert
jaedicke has agreed to serve as acting
dean from July 1 until Miller's suc
cessor is chosen. Associate Deans
lames Van Home and Samuel Pond
also will continue in their present
positions through the next year.
Professor of Accounting Charles
Horngren, who will head the search
committee for Miller's successor,
said he was "still in a state of shock"
at Miller's decision. The rest of the
committee will be appointed in "a
matter of days," Lyman said.
Miller came to Stanford in 1969

after a 23-year career with the Ford
Motor Company. A member of the
"whiz kids" group Henry Ford II
hired out of the Pentagon after
World War 11, Miller rose through a
succession of positions to become
president of Ford in 1963. He was
president until 1968, when he was
named vice-chairman of Ford's
Board of Directors.
Miller said at one point during the
meeting that "At no time have I had a
problem keeping busy doing things I

like to do. I don't expect that to
change now."
Miller's retirement will be a busy
one, as he is currently a director of
six majorcompanies, including Ford,
TWA and Wells Fargo, and is active in
several organizations in the public
sector.
Under Miller's leadership the Bus
iness School has been rated as the
best in the country since a 1974
nationwide poll of business school
deans voted it number one.
