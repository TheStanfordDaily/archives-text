## Seeing quaint local villages 
### CLAIRE CHAMBERLAIN 
Football season may be over,
but studying on a Saturday af
ternoon is still out! With little
sun and lots of units this quar
ter, you can give the weekends
special attention.
Nestled against the Santa
Cruz mountains, the neighbor
ing towns of Los Gatos and
Saratoga provide a taste of
things European and a pleasant
break away from campus.
More like quiet country vil
lages than bedroom com
munities for San Jose, just 10
miles to the east, both towns
boast a colorful array of an

tique stores, old-fashioned
bakeries and continental re
staurants.
In Los Gatos the Bread Box
and Bagel Shop features a
tempting, aromatic variety of
homemade bagels, Swedish
egg breads and miniature nut
loaves. For something more
substantial, there's the
Champs Elysees at 27 Santa
Cruz Ave. It's open daily,
Monday through Saturday, for
lunch and dinner.
Also located along Santa
Cruz Avenue are a number of
specialty stores worth check
ing out. The Christmas

Carousel and Fantasy Faire at
11 North Santa Cruz is a kind of
doll-and-miniature museum
where imagination and price
soar uninhibited. Brass cribs,
stuffed polar bears and "vis
ions of sugarplums" can be
found here. If you're looking
for a ceramic pig from Italy,
Perrier water glasses or a Cor
don Bleu souffle dish, try The
Pantry cookware shop at 14
North Santa Cruz. The Habitat
is a variation on Design Re
search in San Francisco and of
fers contemporary European
designer fabrics, furniture and
kitchenware. French Connec
tion Antiques, also on North
Santa Cruz Avenue, is deco
rated with Provencal fabrics,
porcelain bunnies and
generations-old armores. An
tique stores, both here and in
Saratoga, cover the gamut
from Salvation Army cast-offs
to gold-plated cash registers,
dating from the turn of the cen
tury.
After an hour or two in Los
Gatos you might think about
heading over to Saratoga for
some more browsing and an
early dinner. Four European
restaurants along the main
street, Big Basin Way, provide a
good, if not somewhat expen
sive, selection. Le Mouton
Noir is a favorite choice with
pastel flowered wallpaper,
open beams and flawless
French cuisine. The Adriatic
Restaurant and La Mere
Michelle are close by and offer
such specialties as lignje Dub
rovnik (squid) and wiener
schnitzel. If you're here earlier
in the day, visit Vienna Woods,
an Austrian deli where the
owner, Madame Neuhaus,
serves homemade sausages
with cheeses and imported
beer.
To get to the shopping area
in Los Gatos, about 10 miles
southwest of San Jose on State
Highway 17, take the Main
Street exit west, leading to
Santa Cruz Avenue.
To reach Saratoga from Los
Gatos, take State Highway 9
northwest four miles and turn
left on Big Basin Way.
Amid old-glass storefronts
and European menus, a trip to
Los Gatos and Saratoga can be
a welcome step away from
school
