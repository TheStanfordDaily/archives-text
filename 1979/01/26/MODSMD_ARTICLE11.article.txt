# Claims U.S. controlled by small elite
## Chomsky calls for social justice 
### JOHN DEAN 
After presenting his highly
technical theories on linguis
tics in a series of four public
lectures, Noam Chomsky, the
noted M.I.T. linguist and
philosopher, ended his two
week visit here a week ago as
the 1979 Immanuel Kant lec
turer in philosophy.
Chomsky first gained wide
spread reputation through his
book Syntactic Structures, pub
lished in 1957, which outlined
his revolutionary premise that
language is innate. Chomsky
believes not only is the acquisi
tion of language innate but
people have the innate capac
ity to follow the complex rules
of language.
But what many people fail to
realize is that Chomsky has
taken strongly partisan posi
tions for social justice and
against war with the same pas
sion that he has brought to lin
guistics.
During the early 19605,
Chomsky was an outspoken
critic of America's participation
in the Vietnam war, which he
described as a "bloody pro
cess."
He participated in the 1967
protest march on the Pentagon
and wrote numerous articles
and books speaking out
against the war. Among these
books is a new two-volume
book on the war, soon to be
published.
Chomsky said he believes
that because he has been an
outspoken social critic for
many years — voicing his opin
ion on subjects ranging from
his anti-war stance to the exp
losive situation in Iran — cer
tain "forces" block his books

criticizing the U.S. policies
from being reviewed.
In previous speeches here
Chomsky has said that these
forces control the United
States and are comprised of a
small group of people primar
ily concerned with protecting
and expanding their capital
wherever located in the world.
One of the ways this elite
stays in power Is by controlling
the media's coverage of the
developments in Cambodia,
Timor and Iran, he asserted in
his speeches.
Reiterating that the United
States is exploiting and "trying
to use the Third World re
sources to the benefit of the
rich and powerful" in this
country, Chomsky com
mented on major international
developments in a recent Daily
interview.
"The U.S. has maintained
almost total domination of the
chief energy resources of the
world. And it's almost an axiom
of international affairs that the
U.S. will accept no interfer
ence of its domination of the
chief energy resources."
Chomsky said.
The social critic also stated
that the U.S. "is basically run
bya small group of people who
fundamentally have economic
power. And the economic
power is highly concentrated.
And in any society at all, people
who control the basic
economic institutions will have
an inordinate amount of
power over political and spe
cial events."
Chomsky cited Cambodia as
one of the events by saying that
"the current situation is very
complicated and a very tricky

one. First, the countries in In
dochina were left in an abso
lute horrible state at the end of
the war." He stated that while
the United States gave aid to
the war-stricken countries in
Europe after World War 11, no
aid was given to the countries
in Indochina after the Vietnam
war. Because of this policy, he
said, the war "left the countries
in total ruin.
"One of the consequences
that was left was the borderwar
with Cambodia which goes
way back in history and time.
But I think the U.S., and in fact
the West in general, has con
tributed to that situation,"
Chomsky said.
"What happened during the
1960s throughout the industrial
world is that the Vietnam war
became sort of symbolic of the
western attack on the Third
World."
He stated that the United
States is "directly responsible
for creating an eventual peas
ant movement that was really
out for blood. Now Cambodia,
for U.S. propaganda purposes,
becomes the symbol of how
evil communism is or the Third
World is."
As far as the Middle East is
concerned, Chomsky said he
believes "the history of the
Middle East since the second
World War has primarily been
increasing U.S. control over
parts of the world that matter.
The parts that matter are the
parts that have resources and
the parts that don't, the U.S.
doesn't care too much about."
He added that the United
States also "has power in con
trolling the events in the Mid

ences policies there. For
example, the U.S. foreign pol
icy toward Egypt, according to
Chomsky, has been to remove
Egypt from the Middle East and
turn it into a major African
power. Chomsky stated that
the Egyptian army has already
been "re-equipped for jungle
warfare" and ready to be used
as a launching point for U.S.
intervention in the troubled
areas of Africa under the dis
guise of an Egyptian interven
tion.
Chomsky said what has to be
done to stop U.S. exploitation
and intervention is the restruc
turing of the economic and
political institutions. Chomsky
added that these changes can
be done within what hecalleda
"socialist revolution," with the
same popular uprising as the
peace movement in the 19605.
But he added that this uprising
has to be of a wider scope than
the goal of the anti-war move
ment. He called such an upris
ing "democratizing these basic
institutions."
In 1955, after receiving his
bachelor's, master's and doc
toral degrees from the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Chomsky
became a professor of modern
languages at M.I.T. But he has
received additional degrees
from universities such as the
University of Chicago, Swar
thmore College, the University
of London and Delhi (India)
University.
In addition to bei.ng the Fer
rari P. Ward professor of
foreign languages and linguis
tics at M.1.T., he holds numer
ous professorships at other
universities, among them Col
umbia, Harvard and the Uni

versity of California at Ber
keley.
He also serves as a member
on various commissions and
academic organizations such
as the National Academy of
Sciences, Linguistic Society of
America and the American
Philosophical Association.
While a junior fellow at Har
vard from 1951 to 1955,
Chomsky wrote The Logical
Structure of Linguistic Theory,
though it was not published
until 1975. The book contains
many of the important ideas
developed by Chomsky. His
theory of transformational
generative grammar, first out
lined in this book, re
volutionized the study of lin
guistics as an innovative sys
tem of language analysis.
Even though Chomsky re
volutionized the discipline of
linguistics in its goals,
methodologies, and theories,
he also dramatically changed
scholarly concern about lan
guage among those people
working in other disciplines,
such as psychology,
philosophy, education and an
thropology.
Thomas A. Wasow, associate
professor of linguistics and
philosophy here and a former
student of Chomsky's said in
December that "Chomsky's
writings are remarkably di
verse, ranging from highly
technical theorems to passion
ate calls for political action."
Chomsky's many books in
clude Aspects of the Theory of
Syntax (1965), American Power
and the New Mandarins (1969),
Peace in the Middle 5a5f?(1974)
and Reflections on Language
(1975).

ion on subjects ranging from
his anti-war stance to the exp
losive situation in Iran — cer
tain "forces" block his books

criticizing the U.S. policies
from being reviewed.
In previous speeches here
Chomsky has said that these
forces control the United
States and are comprised of a
small group of people primar
ily concerned with protecting
and expanding their capital
wherever located in the world.
One of the ways this elite
stays in power Is by controlling
the media's coverage of the
developments in Cambodia,
Timor and Iran, he asserted in
his speeches.
Reiterating that the United
States is exploiting and "trying
to use the Third World re
sources to the benefit of the
rich and powerful" in this
country, Chomsky com
mented on major international
developments in a recent Daily
interview.
"The U.S. has maintained
almost total domination of the
chief energy resources of the
world. And it's almost an axiom
of international affairs that the
U.S. will accept no interfer
ence of its domination of the
chief energy resources."
Chomsky said.
The social critic also stated
that the U.S. "is basically run
bya small group of people who
fundamentally have economic
power. And the economic
power is highly concentrated.
And in any society at all, people
who control the basic
economic institutions will have
an inordinate amount of
power over political and spe
cial events."
Chomsky cited Cambodia as
one of the events by saying that
"the current situation is very
complicated and a very tricky

one. First, the countries in In
dochina were left in an abso
lute horrible state at the end of
the war." He stated that while
the United States gave aid to
the war-stricken countries in
Europe after World War 11, no
aid was given to the countries
in Indochina after the Vietnam
war. Because of this policy, he
said, the war "left the countries
in total ruin.
"One of the consequences
that was left was the borderwar
with Cambodia which goes
way back in history and time.
But I think the U.S., and in fact
the West in general, has con
tributed to that situation,"
Chomsky said.
"What happened during the
1960s throughout the industrial
world is that the Vietnam war
became sort of symbolic of the
western attack on the Third
World."
He stated that the United
States is "directly responsible
for creating an eventual peas
ant movement that was really
out for blood. Now Cambodia,
for U.S. propaganda purposes,
becomes the symbol of how
evil communism is or the Third
World is."
As far as the Middle East is
concerned, Chomsky said he
believes "the history of the
Middle East since the second
World War has primarily been
increasing U.S. control over
parts of the world that matter.
The parts that matter are the
parts that have resources and
the parts that don't, the U.S.
doesn't care too much about."
He added that the United
States also "has power in con
trolling the events in the Mid

ences policies there. For
example, the U.S. foreign pol
icy toward Egypt, according to
Chomsky, has been to remove
Egypt from the Middle East and
turn it into a major African
power. Chomsky stated that
the Egyptian army has already
been "re-equipped for jungle
warfare" and ready to be used
as a launching point for U.S.
intervention in the troubled
areas of Africa under the dis
guise of an Egyptian interven
tion.
Chomsky said what has to be
done to stop U.S. exploitation
and intervention is the restruc
turing of the economic and
political institutions. Chomsky
added that these changes can
be done within what hecalleda
"socialist revolution," with the
same popular uprising as the
peace movement in the 19605.
But he added that this uprising
has to be of a wider scope than
the goal of the anti-war move
ment. He called such an upris
ing "democratizing these basic
institutions."
In 1955, after receiving his
bachelor's, master's and doc
toral degrees from the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Chomsky
became a professor of modern
languages at M.I.T. But he has
received additional degrees
from universities such as the
University of Chicago, Swar
thmore College, the University
of London and Delhi (India)
University.
In addition to bei.ng the Fer
rari P. Ward professor of
foreign languages and linguis
tics at M.1.T., he holds numer
ous professorships at other
universities, among them Col
umbia, Harvard and the Uni

versity of California at Ber
keley.
He also serves as a member
on various commissions and
academic organizations such
as the National Academy of
Sciences, Linguistic Society of
America and the American
Philosophical Association.
While a junior fellow at Har
vard from 1951 to 1955,
Chomsky wrote The Logical
Structure of Linguistic Theory,
though it was not published
until 1975. The book contains
many of the important ideas
developed by Chomsky. His
theory of transformational
generative grammar, first out
lined in this book, re
volutionized the study of lin
guistics as an innovative sys
tem of language analysis.
Even though Chomsky re
volutionized the discipline of
linguistics in its goals,
methodologies, and theories,
he also dramatically changed
scholarly concern about lan
guage among those people
working in other disciplines,
such as psychology,
philosophy, education and an
thropology.
Thomas A. Wasow, associate
professor of linguistics and
philosophy here and a former
student of Chomsky's said in
December that "Chomsky's
writings are remarkably di
verse, ranging from highly
technical theorems to passion
ate calls for political action."
Chomsky's many books in
clude Aspects of the Theory of
Syntax (1965), American Power
and the New Mandarins (1969),
Peace in the Middle 5a5f?(1974)
and Reflections on Language
(1975).
After presenting his highly
technical theories on linguis
tics in a series of four public
lectures, Noam Chomsky, the
noted M.I.T. linguist and
philosopher, ended his two
week visit here a week ago as
the 1979 Immanuel Kant lec
turer in philosophy.
Chomsky first gained wide
spread reputation through his
book Syntactic Structures, pub
lished in 1957, which outlined
his revolutionary premise that
language is innate. Chomsky
believes not only is the acquisi
tion of language innate but
people have the innate capac
ity to follow the complex rules
of language.
But what many people fail to
realize is that Chomsky has
taken strongly partisan posi
tions for social justice and
against war with the same pas
sion that he has brought to lin
guistics.
During the early 19605,
Chomsky was an outspoken
critic of America's participation
in the Vietnam war, which he
described as a "bloody pro
cess."
He participated in the 1967
protest march on the Pentagon
and wrote numerous articles
and books speaking out
against the war. Among these
books is a new two-volume
book on the war, soon to be
published.

power over political and spe
cial events."
Chomsky cited Cambodia as
one of the events by saying that
"the current situation is very
complicated and a very tricky

one. First, the countries in In
dochina were left in an abso
lute horrible state at the end of
the war." He stated that while
the United States gave aid to
the war-stricken countries in
Europe after World War 11, no
aid was given to the countries
in Indochina after the Vietnam
war. Because of this policy, he
said, the war "left the countries
in total ruin.
"One of the consequences
that was left was the borderwar
with Cambodia which goes
way back in history and time.
But I think the U.S., and in fact
the West in general, has con
tributed to that situation,"
Chomsky said.
"What happened during the
1960s throughout the industrial
world is that the Vietnam war
became sort of symbolic of the
western attack on the Third
World."
He stated that the United
States is "directly responsible
for creating an eventual peas
ant movement that was really
out for blood. Now Cambodia,
for U.S. propaganda purposes,
becomes the symbol of how
evil communism is or the Third
World is."
As far as the Middle East is
concerned, Chomsky said he
believes "the history of the
Middle East since the second
World War has primarily been
increasing U.S. control over
parts of the world that matter.
The parts that matter are the
parts that have resources and
the parts that don't, the U.S.
doesn't care too much about."
He added that the United
States also "has power in con
trolling the events in the Mid

ences policies there. For
example, the U.S. foreign pol
icy toward Egypt, according to
Chomsky, has been to remove
Egypt from the Middle East and
turn it into a major African
power. Chomsky stated that
the Egyptian army has already
been "re-equipped for jungle
warfare" and ready to be used
as a launching point for U.S.
intervention in the troubled
areas of Africa under the dis
guise of an Egyptian interven
tion.
Chomsky said what has to be
done to stop U.S. exploitation
and intervention is the restruc
turing of the economic and
political institutions. Chomsky
added that these changes can
be done within what hecalleda
"socialist revolution," with the
same popular uprising as the
peace movement in the 19605.
But he added that this uprising
has to be of a wider scope than
the goal of the anti-war move
ment. He called such an upris
ing "democratizing these basic
institutions."
In 1955, after receiving his
bachelor's, master's and doc
toral degrees from the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Chomsky
became a professor of modern
languages at M.I.T. But he has
received additional degrees
from universities such as the
University of Chicago, Swar
thmore College, the University
of London and Delhi (India)
University.
In addition to bei.ng the Fer
rari P. Ward professor of
foreign languages and linguis
tics at M.1.T., he holds numer
ous professorships at other
universities, among them Col
umbia, Harvard and the Uni

versity of California at Ber
keley.
He also serves as a member
on various commissions and
academic organizations such
as the National Academy of
Sciences, Linguistic Society of
America and the American
Philosophical Association.
While a junior fellow at Har
vard from 1951 to 1955,
Chomsky wrote The Logical
Structure of Linguistic Theory,
though it was not published
until 1975. The book contains
many of the important ideas
developed by Chomsky. His
theory of transformational
generative grammar, first out
lined in this book, re
volutionized the study of lin
guistics as an innovative sys
tem of language analysis.
Even though Chomsky re
volutionized the discipline of
linguistics in its goals,
methodologies, and theories,
he also dramatically changed
scholarly concern about lan
guage among those people
working in other disciplines,
such as psychology,
philosophy, education and an
thropology.
Thomas A. Wasow, associate
professor of linguistics and
philosophy here and a former
student of Chomsky's said in
December that "Chomsky's
writings are remarkably di
verse, ranging from highly
technical theorems to passion
ate calls for political action."
Chomsky's many books in
clude Aspects of the Theory of
Syntax (1965), American Power
and the New Mandarins (1969),
Peace in the Middle 5a5f?(1974)
and Reflections on Language
(1975).
