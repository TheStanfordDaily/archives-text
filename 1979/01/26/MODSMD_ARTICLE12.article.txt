# Cardin comes to China
## 
### 
Paris (AP) — When China
flung open its doors, among
the Westerners to stride in was
Pierre Cardin, that symbol of
capitalist taste and luxury
spending.
And during his visit, Cardin
staged an impromptu, very
unproletarian fashion parade
— with Chinese mannequins
— fielded questions on how to
make better shoes and collars,
and came away dazzled by
China, both the countryand its
potential as the world's biggest
market.
"It is not a matter of China
awakening," he says."It is
more a case of China explod
ing."
The spectacular end to Car
din's week-long visit last
month was an invitation to
bring his own fashion show to
Peking and Shanghai next
March. Cardin hopes it will be
a telling footnote in China's fu
ture.
Alongside Yves St. Laurent
and Christian Dior, the name
Cardin is synonymous with
fashion. But Cardin was the
pioneer of mass-produced
high fashion for the ordinary
man, woman and child.
It was hardly the Chinese
whom Cardin had in mind 20
years ago when he put fashion
on the conveyor belt. But now,
Cardin says, he thinks Paris

fashion will make the Mao Jac
ket go the way of the pigtail.
Pierre Cardin Co. makes ev
erything from clothes to furni
ture to cigarette lighters in 300
factories worldwide and sells
in 40 countries, including the
Soviet Union. Turnover is $250
million a year.
Landing a market in China —
"there are a billion people out
there who need clothes" —
would be a mighty coup for
Cardin. "I am the first to go
into China," he said in an in
terview. "Much b.etter than
being the last."
Cardin says he signed no
business deals in China but
promised to send consultants
there and bring Chinese
trainees to his factories in
Europe and.Japan.
His long-term view is clear,
however, when he points out
that labor costs in China are
cheaper than even in Singa
pore and Taiwan, and Chinese
cashmere costs a fifth of the
price anywhere else.
He speaks of a barter agree
ment under which he would
trade Cardin expertise for
Chinese silks and cashmere.
The designer is cautious of
painting visions of 900 million
Chinese wearing Cardin out
fits. Chinese are "very proud
but very poor," he says, and
the government thinks in

terms of exporting 90 percent
of its Cardin-linked products
and selling 10 percent at home.
Some observers think that 10
percent will go to the Chinese
upper class. Asked about this,
Cardin replies with conviction:
"There is no upper class in
China. There are no classes at
all."
Over the next five years,
however, he foresees more
and more stylish Western dress
in China.
Cardin first thought of going
to China in 1974. But he never
found the time. And he always
imagined a mere tourist jaunt,
never dreaming that Red China
would be interested in his line
of work.
Between strolls along the
Great Wall of China and
through Peking, Cardin toured
five cities and nine clothing,
leather and textile factories.
His meetings had no political
overtones, says Cardin. "In
China, everything now con
cerns the future," he says, jab
bing the air with his hands.
Though a gaunt 56, he has the
enthusiasm of a teen-ager.
"In five years China will be
completely changed," Cardin
says. "They are looking toward
the American life, the Japanese
life. I think they will become a
Western democracy."

there who need clothes" —
would be a mighty coup for
Cardin. "I am the first to go
into China," he said in an in
terview. "Much b.etter than
being the last."
Cardin says he signed no
business deals in China but
promised to send consultants
there and bring Chinese
trainees to his factories in
Europe and.Japan.
His long-term view is clear,
however, when he points out
that labor costs in China are
cheaper than even in Singa
pore and Taiwan, and Chinese
cashmere costs a fifth of the
price anywhere else.
He speaks of a barter agree
ment under which he would
trade Cardin expertise for
Chinese silks and cashmere.
The designer is cautious of
painting visions of 900 million
Chinese wearing Cardin out
fits. Chinese are "very proud
but very poor," he says, and
the government thinks in

terms of exporting 90 percent
of its Cardin-linked products
and selling 10 percent at home.
Some observers think that 10
percent will go to the Chinese
upper class. Asked about this,
Cardin replies with conviction:
"There is no upper class in
China. There are no classes at
all."
Over the next five years,
however, he foresees more
and more stylish Western dress
in China.
Cardin first thought of going
to China in 1974. But he never
found the time. And he always
imagined a mere tourist jaunt,
never dreaming that Red China
would be interested in his line
of work.
Between strolls along the
Great Wall of China and
through Peking, Cardin toured
five cities and nine clothing,
leather and textile factories.
His meetings had no political
overtones, says Cardin. "In
China, everything now con
cerns the future," he says, jab
bing the air with his hands.
Though a gaunt 56, he has the
enthusiasm of a teen-ager.
"In five years China will be
completely changed," Cardin
says. "They are looking toward
the American life, the Japanese
life. I think they will become a
Western democracy."
