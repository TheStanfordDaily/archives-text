# Carter warned of shah's peril
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — If the
Carter administration has
erred in Iran, the error was
not a failure by intelligence
experts to warn about the
shah's peril but a failure to
heed those warnings, some
administration sources say.
President Jimmy Carter
has upbraided the CIA for
not forecasting the shah's
difficulties more accurately.
Many reports from Iran
were excessively optimistic,
particularly from the CIA
and U.S. Ambassador Wil
liam Sullivan, sources said.
But speaking privately,
knowledgeable officials say
there was adequate warn
ing, at least twice, of prob
lems overtaking the shah.
One warning came from
the State Department's own
intelligence service in
January 1978. Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance was told
the monarchy was in for real
trouble unless the shah ag
reed to fundamental re
forms.
And in March 1978, Dr.
James Bill, an Iranian expert
from the University of
Texas, was hired as a consul
tant to present a paper to a
seminar of administration
Iranian experts.
Bill titled his paper
"Monarchy in Collapse."
He said the shah's oppo
nents were coming from the
growing Iranian middle
class and not merely from
religious fanatics and leftist
students.
"The State Department

was very receptive, but I did
not see my views reflected
in any changes in policy,"
Bill said in an interview re
cently.
At a news conference last
week, Vance acknowledged
that "on the whole, the in
telligence we have received
has been adequate to
foresee events as they de
veloped."
Administration officials,
in reviewing the events of
1978, said there was one ef
fort to induce the shah to
change his ways.
The sources said the Un
ited States tried in mid-1978
to persuade the shah to
allow a team of World Bank
economists to study Iran's
economy and recommend a
program of reduced arms
expenditures and more at
tention to problems in ag
riculture and industry. The
shah refused.
There was no immediate
change in American policy
as a result of that refusal.
The administration con
tinued to sell Iran billions of
dollars in advanced
weaponry.
One middle-level official
said that telling the ad
ministration's policymakers
that the shah was on the way
out "was like telling the
pope that, based on the evi
dence, there probably
wasn't an immaculate con
ception. They just didn't
want to believe it."
