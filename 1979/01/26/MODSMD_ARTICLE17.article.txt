# The 						Stanford Daily OPINIONS
## Editor's perspective Reflecting on the volume 
### 
Today's Daily marks my last issue as editor. This column is a thank-you
note as well as a semi-annual report to the University community on the
status of the Daily.
The past months as editor has been a rewarding challenge. To watch the
Daily grow and participate directly in that process is a dream come true of
any would-be journalist, especially me.
During fall quarter, the Daily grew from an average eight page per issue
newspaper a year ago to more than 10 pages per issue. For individual editors
on my staff, it was a big challenge, but met successfully, and I am thankful to
them for their dedication and hard work.
This increase in issue size allowed the Daily to open up more inside pages
to news and features articles and to keep you, our reader, better informed.
But while I believe the quantity of news stories increased during the past
month, I leave my position as editor concerned there are important stories
that remain unreported. It is a problem inherent when a constant staff
turnover in the reporting ranks occurs.
To give a beginning reporter a challenging story that requires extended
research is an impossibility. But the time commitment of working on the
Daily and taking a full load takes its toll on potential staff members.
The Daily has made attempts to make the office an enjoyable and fun
place. And the Daily constantly attempts to reach out and recruit more
staffers.
What the changeover in volumes and department editors this weekend
does allow is a close look at what the editors consider are our weaknesses
and how we can best make improvements.
In my judgment, new editor Mike Charlson is well aware of where the
Daily needs to grow, and is already taking steps to assure that the Daily will
continue to be a first-rate newsgathering organization.
The Daily has successfully responded to community needs. The previous
example of expanded news coverage stands out, and the Daily's initiative in
sponsoring a publicity workshop is another. During the past year, the Daily
has also made strides forward in responding to the needs of ethnic and
feminist groups on campus.
Financially, the Daily is in the best shape it has ever been. In the near
future, the Daily will be publishing a statement of its financial condition to
let the community better understand our growth.
But some major monetary challenges will face the Daily in the very
future, including the possible computerization of the newsroom. If you
ever have any questions about our growth, Daily editors will be glad to talk
with you.
Primarily, the Daily serves two major purposes â€” to inform the Stanford
community to the best of its ability and act as a training ground for aspiring
journalists.
I believe we are more than adequately meeting these challenges at the
Daily. I will be forever thankful for the response of our readership in making
us more aware of campus events. Without you, our readers, I would never
have had such an enjoyable experience as editor.
