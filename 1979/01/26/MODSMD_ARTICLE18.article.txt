Cold War mentality
Richard Wohl's column "All
facts not told" (Daily, Jan. 9)
gives us no more facts but a lot
of distorted views. Wohl's
comments were grossly insen
sitive, devoid of understanding
of Chinese history and charac
terized by an anachronistic
Cold War mentality.
Forall that MaoTse-tung and
Chiang Kai-shek disagreed,
they both agreed that Taiwan is
part of China. After a century of
painful division and existence
in a semi-colonial state, the
Chinese yearning for unity and
territorial integrity is under
standable and should be re
spected. Wohl obviously has
no feeling for the tragedy of
"two Germanies, two Yemens
and two Koreas."
By characterizing Taiwan as
"the political price for nor
malization," Wohl is implying
that the United States is paying
a price for ties with China. This
harks back to the "Who lost
China"-days of the early 19505.
After all, as Anthony Lewis
wrote in the New York Times
two weeks ago, China was not
America's to lose. It is strictly

China's internal affair.
Moreover, China does
acknowledge the different so
cial and economic systems in
Taiwan. The re-integration
would be gradual. The emerg
ing consensus is that Taiwan
will exist for a time as a Hong
Kong or Macao with trade and
cultural ties, but it will be polit
ically distinct. I believe China's
preoccupation is the preten
sions with the words "Republic
of China." Suzerainty, not so
much sovereignty is at stake.
In a world of free trade and
technological transfer, Wohl's
fear of China's "sophisticated
industrial base" is overdrawn.
His attempt to conjure up an
image of the Chinese as
space-age Huns is almost
funny. Statements like "a po
tentially hostile country whose
human resources so vastly ex
ceed ours," and "squadron of
MiGs," remind one of )ohn
Foster Dulles.
No remark is more insensi
tive and callous than Wohl's
off-hand remark, "After all, the
Chinese might like Coke as
well as they did opium."
Admittedly, Chinese
technology has a lot to catch

up. However, with the exit of
the Soviets in the late 19505,
Chinese technology has con
tinued to develop. Singlehan
dedly, they did develop nuc
lear and extractive (oil)
technologies successfully. At a
time when national interest
rules, Western participation in
Chinese modernization is far
from altruistic. When
Schlesinger visited China in
late spring, he was trying to
solve American energy prob
lems as well as to meet Chinese
needs. I, for one, doubt the
wisdom of the current massive
technology import in China.

History
Other side didn't
show up
With respect to my recent
appearance at the ASSU Senate
meeting, I should like to make
the following points. First, I ac
cepted the invitation with the
express understanding that
both the University administra
tion and the "Medical Center"
administration were to be pre
sent to express their views. It
was my understanding that in
vitations had been issued. No
body on their side showed up.
Second, during the debate,
it was brought out several
times that the Academic Affairs
Committee of the ASSU Senate
had interviewed Dean Crowley
and staff counsel, Carl Hitch
ner, and that contact had been
made with James Stanford of
the Financial Office. Their pos

itions were reported to the
ASSU Senate, but only secon
dhand because they didn't
show up. They didn't decline;
they just didn't show up.
Further, it was brought out that
the ASSU Senate had on occa
sjons already heard from Pres
ident Richard Lyman on this is
sue.
Third, the substance of my
argument dealt not with "dou
ble billing" which for the most
part is a phenomenon limited
to overpayments in state and
federal public assistance prog
rams available only to teaching
institutions. Rather, my discus
sion revolved around the legis
lative and decisional history of
statutes defining the rights
conferred on individuals and
artificial legal entities by the
State of California with respect
to the practice of medicine. I
also discussed the public
policies upon which the sta
tutes are based.
Fourth, I took the invitation
seriously, both as a mere citi
zen engaged in a continuing
debate over public policy and
as a faculty member obligated
to engage in informative
dialogues with interested stu
dents of this University. The
students paid careful attention
to procedural safeguards in
their debate and were serious
in their pursuit of a rational
position. The other side didn't
show up and can't be heard
now to complain of the out
come.
