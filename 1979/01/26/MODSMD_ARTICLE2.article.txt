# Lyman criticizes NCAA Title IX position
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
President Richard Lyman criticized
the NCAA last night for its failure to
accept the idea of equality for
women in athletics mandated by Title
IX.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference, Lyman said, "I oon t like to
see the NCAA acting as it somehow
this were an indecent idea that
women whould have equality of
treatment with men in sports. And
that's what keeps coming through in
the NCAA's official pronouncements
and in the floor debates at the NCAA
meetings."
However, Lyman argued that the
department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW), which has issued
tentative guidelines for Title IX
compliance should give universities
time to adjust to any new regula
tions.
It would be too much of a burden
for schools to adapt their athletic
programs immediately, Lyman said.
He suggested two or three years
might be a good period of time in
which to meet the requirements.
Lyman said the specific programs
that would be instituted here to
comply with Title IX have not been
settled, but he said the cost would be
somewhere in the hundreds of

thousands of dollars. He said the
principal reason for this figure is the
high cost of football scholarships.
There is nothing even remotely
comparable to these on the womens'
side of sports, he added.
Though many issues still need to
be clarified, Lyman said the main in
terpretation of HEW's proposed
guidelines seems to be that "as far as
scholarships are concerned, it's a per
capita equation that has to be ba
lanced." Women must be supported
with athletics at the same relative
level as men, he said.
Lyman rejected the NCAA claim
that football and basketball scholar
ships should be excluded from Title
IX regulations.
Lyman also said on the program he

felt "annoyed" that the ASSU Senate
has claimed his appearance before
them helped to constitute a com
plete inquiry into the issue of the
so-called double-billing at the Med
Center here. The senate recently
passed a resolution condemning that
practice. Lyman said, "They are now
trying to make it look as if they car
ried out a careful investigation of all
sides of the issue, and that is simply
not the case, or even close to being
the case."
He added that it would be possible
for the senate to deal with such is
sues "in a way that was more respon
sible and could be taken more seri
ously by the rest of the community. It
doesn't seem to me one has to take
very seriously resolutions that are

passed on the basis of totally in
adequate investigation."
Commenting on his recent ap
pointment to the IBM Board of Direc
tors.. Lyman said he took the job be
cause IBM is a very interesting com
pany, one working on the forefront
of technology.
"I thought I'd probably learn
something," he said. "Large organi
zations do have some things in
common." He added that he would
like to learn more about how other
kinds of large organizations operate.
He denied there would be any
problem with conflict of interest be
cause what computer system any de
partment here might decide to use is
a question, he said, "I'm not likely to
be involved in."
