## Theme houses benefit residents 
### 
As two Anglo women who
have lived at Casa Zapata for
three years and are now on the
residence staff there, we re
sent Richard Wohl's implica
tions that theme houses are
not valuable made in his col
umn "Ethnic houses polarize
campus" (Daily, Jan. 22). Be
cause Casa Zapata is very im
portant to us, we want to clear
up some of the inaccuracies of
Wohl's article.
One major contradiction
was Wohl's statement that
theme houses are "counter
productive" to the University's
goal of enriching itself with a
variety of ethnic groups, when
he stated later that it is "unfair
to ask minority group mem
bers to bear the burden of an
acculturation process."
We agree with the latter
statement and feel that the
former is based on several
faulty assumptions. Wohl
seems to think that all minority
students come here with a
clear sense of their ethnic iden
tity and how they fit into the
University, that they would be
able and willing to "share"
their culture with the Anglo

students in their living groups
and that the Anglos would be
receptive to that culture.
It is far more likely that an
isolated minority person
would either spend most of his
time outside the dorm with
people of the same ethnic
group, or that he would assimi
late into the dorm and largely
ignore his own culture.
Despite Wohl's view that the
people here are "open
minded," we know minority
students who have been vic
tims of racial prejudice in their
residences and in their classes.
For them, theme houses are
crucial.
This brings us to a second
contradiction. Wohl states that
the "direct beneficiaries (of
theme houses) are few,"
though earlier in the article he
had admitted that theme
houses "provide a supportive,
relaxed atmosphere and a
gathering point for cultural and
political activity."
Apparently Wohl is not sen
sitive to the importance of such
an atmosphere — not only to
the 40 Chicanos living there,
but also to other Chicanos on
campus. Nor are Chicanos the
only beneficiaries of theme
houses.
Another disturbing thing
about Wohl's article was his in
accurate quotes. The Casa
Zapata theme associate with
whom Wohl spoke stated that
livingatZapata had a polarizing
effect on him personally, not
that, in general, "being in a
theme house has a definite
polarizing effect." And he did
not claim that most of the
Chicano activists come out of
Zapata, but rather that many of
them had lived in the house at
some time or another.
We would like to add that
there are plenty of "non
activist" Chicanos, as well as
"activist" Anglos living in
Zapata; it's simply not the case
that there are 40 militant
Chicanos living with 50 reluc
tant Anglos.

Wohl also erred by
generalizing about all theme
houses at all times from a small
bit of evidence about two
theme houses this year. Wohl
has never lived in a theme
house at all, and interviewing
one staff member and a few
other residents of Zapata is
hardly sufficient to learn what
Zapata means to all its resi
dents even for this year.
Furthermore, we wonder
why Wohl did not so much as
mention Junipero, the Asian
theme house, which, from all
reports we've received, is hav
ing an excellent year (Campus
Report, Dec. 6, 1978).
The point that we especially
want to make is that we disag
ree with Wohl's implication
that theme houses are not val
uable to their non-minority (in
our case, non-Chicano) resi
dents.
First, we must stress that
Zapata is a dorm as well as a
theme house and that we do all
those traditional dorm ac
tivities — trips to San Fran
cisco, the beach and Tahoe,
birthday parties, IM sports,
backgammon tournaments,
etc. In addition to all these,
there are also theme activities,
which are open to all residents
— lectures, films, theme
related classes and the like.
A few of these are easier for
bilingual speakers to partici
pate in than for those who do
not speak Spanish (which in
clude some of the Chicanos in
the house), but there are
non-Chicanos who speak
Spanish; furthermore, for
those who are willing to make
the effort, these activities are
not closed to anyone,, what
ever language(s) the person
speaks.
As staff members who en
courage all residents to par
ticipate and plan activities with
both Chicanos and non-
Chicanos in mind, we resent
the contention that "activities
are not really designed to invite
the participation of non-

Chicanos."
There are some people who
are just not interested in theme
activities, but even for those
people who are not active in
them, Zapata is a harmonious
house, as evidenced by much
enthusiastic feedback we have
received by residents here,
whether or not they involve
themselves in the theme.
We do not feel that the
non-Chicanos are isolated
from the campus at large or
from the Chicanos in our
house.
Indeed, as evidenced by our
commitment to Zapata, we
have found the cross-cultural
experience here very reward
ing. It gives us a change to
compensate for the ignorance
which the "separation in the
'real world,' " that Wohl men
tioned, has engendered in us.
There are also some who come
to Zapata so filled with nega
tive expectations that they are
not able to take advantage of
this unique environment.
It is not always the most com
fortable living situation availa
ble on campus. To be involved
in the theme can mean consid
erable personal effort. But
self-satisfied ease is not con
ducive to learning in general,
much less to learning about the
controversial and often
threatening issues of racism,
which are by no means eradi
cated in our society.
Yes, Zapata is an artificial en
vironment, but it has a purpose
and we are "striving for better"
than the world has given us;
we are striving for a special
kind of education which will
give all of Zapata's residents a
new understanding of them
selves, of their ethnic groups,
and of other ethnic groups. For
many of us, Zapata is a unique,
educational opportunity and
an important part of our lives
here.

compensate for the ignorance
which the "separation in the
'real world,' " that Wohl men
tioned, has engendered in us.
There are also some who come
to Zapata so filled with nega
tive expectations that they are
not able to take advantage of
this unique environment.
It is not always the most com
fortable living situation availa
ble on campus. To be involved
in the theme can mean consid
erable personal effort. But
self-satisfied ease is not con
ducive to learning in general,
much less to learning about the
controversial and often
threatening issues of racism,
which are by no means eradi
cated in our society.
Yes, Zapata is an artificial en
vironment, but it has a purpose
and we are "striving for better"
than the world has given us;
we are striving for a special
kind of education which will
give all of Zapata's residents a
new understanding of them
selves, of their ethnic groups,
and of other ethnic groups. For
many of us, Zapata is a unique,
educational opportunity and
an important part of our lives
here.

As two Anglo women who
have lived at Casa Zapata for
three years and are now on the
residence staff there, we re
sent Richard Wohl's implica
tions that theme houses are
not valuable made in his col
umn "Ethnic houses polarize
campus" (Daily, Jan. 22). Be
cause Casa Zapata is very im
portant to us, we want to clear
up some of the inaccuracies of
Wohl's article.
One major contradiction
was Wohl's statement that
theme houses are "counter
productive" to the University's
goal of enriching itself with a
variety of ethnic groups, when
he stated later that it is "unfair
to ask minority group mem
bers to bear the burden of an
acculturation process."
We agree with the latter
statement and feel that the
former is based on several
faulty assumptions. Wohl
seems to think that all minority
students come here with a
clear sense of their ethnic iden
tity and how they fit into the
University, that they would be
able and willing to "share"
their culture with the Anglo

students in their living groups
and that the Anglos would be
receptive to that culture.
It is far more likely that an
isolated minority person
would either spend most of his
time outside the dorm with
people of the same ethnic
group, or that he would assimi
late into the dorm and largely
ignore his own culture.
Despite Wohl's view that the
people here are "open
minded," we know minority
students who have been vic
tims of racial prejudice in their
residences and in their classes.
For them, theme houses are
crucial.
This brings us to a second
contradiction. Wohl states that
the "direct beneficiaries (of
theme houses) are few,"
though earlier in the article he
had admitted that theme
houses "provide a supportive,
relaxed atmosphere and a
gathering point for cultural and
political activity."
Apparently Wohl is not sen
sitive to the importance of such
an atmosphere — not only to
the 40 Chicanos living there,
but also to other Chicanos on
campus. Nor are Chicanos the
only beneficiaries of theme
houses.
Another disturbing thing
about Wohl's article was his in
accurate quotes. The Casa
Zapata theme associate with
whom Wohl spoke stated that
livingatZapata had a polarizing
effect on him personally, not
that, in general, "being in a
theme house has a definite
polarizing effect." And he did
not claim that most of the
Chicano activists come out of
Zapata, but rather that many of
them had lived in the house at
some time or another.
We would like to add that
there are plenty of "non
activist" Chicanos, as well as
"activist" Anglos living in
Zapata; it's simply not the case
that there are 40 militant
Chicanos living with 50 reluc
tant Anglos.

Wohl also erred by
generalizing about all theme
houses at all times from a small
bit of evidence about two
theme houses this year. Wohl
has never lived in a theme
house at all, and interviewing
one staff member and a few
other residents of Zapata is
hardly sufficient to learn what
Zapata means to all its resi
dents even for this year.
Furthermore, we wonder
why Wohl did not so much as
mention Junipero, the Asian
theme house, which, from all
reports we've received, is hav
ing an excellent year (Campus
Report, Dec. 6, 1978).
The point that we especially
want to make is that we disag
ree with Wohl's implication
that theme houses are not val
uable to their non-minority (in
our case, non-Chicano) resi
dents.
First, we must stress that
Zapata is a dorm as well as a
theme house and that we do all
those traditional dorm ac
tivities — trips to San Fran
cisco, the beach and Tahoe,
birthday parties, IM sports,
backgammon tournaments,
etc. In addition to all these,
there are also theme activities,
which are open to all residents
— lectures, films, theme
related classes and the like.
A few of these are easier for
bilingual speakers to partici
pate in than for those who do
not speak Spanish (which in
clude some of the Chicanos in
the house), but there are
non-Chicanos who speak
Spanish; furthermore, for
those who are willing to make
the effort, these activities are
not closed to anyone,, what
ever language(s) the person
speaks.
As staff members who en
courage all residents to par
ticipate and plan activities with
both Chicanos and non-
Chicanos in mind, we resent
the contention that "activities
are not really designed to invite
the participation of non-

Chicanos."
There are some people who
are just not interested in theme
activities, but even for those
people who are not active in
them, Zapata is a harmonious
house, as evidenced by much
enthusiastic feedback we have
received by residents here,
whether or not they involve
themselves in the theme.
We do not feel that the
non-Chicanos are isolated
from the campus at large or
from the Chicanos in our
house.
Indeed, as evidenced by our
commitment to Zapata, we
have found the cross-cultural
experience here very reward
ing. It gives us a change to
compensate for the ignorance
which the "separation in the
'real world,' " that Wohl men
tioned, has engendered in us.
There are also some who come
to Zapata so filled with nega
