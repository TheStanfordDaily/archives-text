## Open discussion needed 
### 
I wish to make a few observations regarding
the responses printed in "Letters to the editor"
regarding my article on abortion (Daily, Jan. 8).
Charles Hoard states (Daily, Jan. 16) that
."abortion is none of our business, neither
Hayes', nor mine, nor any man's." Virginia Pud
defoot states (Daily, Jan. 19) "how can . . . men,
who will never experience the shock of un
wanted pregnancy, deign to sit in judgment?"
If I read these authors correctly, they are
claiming that men have no business participat
ing in discussing the moral implications of abor
tion simply because they themselves can never
know the pain of an unwanted pregnancy.
I cannot understand such reasoning. This
reasoning is similar to concluding that, because
I am not a patient in a hospital for the mentally
ill, and therefore cannot know the psychological
torture of a severely mentally ill person, I have
no business discussing the ethical implications
of certain forms of "treatment" administered in
hospitals for the mentally ill.
Must I know the pain of being mentally ill
before I can be qualified to discuss the ethical
implications of the treatment of mentally ill per
sons? Such reasoning seems fallacious. Surely
both men and women, as fellow members of a
common moral community, are entitled to dis
cuss the ethical questions involved in abortion.
Both Hoard and Puddefoot concentrate their
attention on the woman who is suffering from
an unwanted pregnancy. They seem to focus
their arguments purely on the woman and her
right to attempt to alleviate the terrible suffering
she is experiencing.
It seems to me that we must also consider the
rights of the fetus, not merely the rights of the
mother alone.
Hoard's reasoning seems to imply that, be
cause the woman is suffering "psychological
hell," as he terms it, such suffering justifies tak
ing the life of the fetus in order to stop the

suffering.
I think an analogy will help to expose the
problem with such reasoning. Suppose I had a
close relative who had suffered a series of se
vere strokes that had left him a "living vegeta
ble" with no hope for recovery. Further assume
that for me to see this close relative in such an
inhuman condition caused me tremendous
"psychological hell." Would I then be justified
in ending his life to alleviate my suffering?
Certainly not, for to do so would violate his
right to life. By analogy, the deep suffering of
the mother still does not justify taking the life of
the fetus to alleviate that suffering.
My arguments collapse if it can be shown that
the fetus is not a person and therefore not pos
sessing the natural right to life. My article
gave inadequate treatment to the proof that the
fetus is indeed a person from the moment of
conception.
Such arguments are complex and subtle, and I
could not hope to have presented them fully in
the space limitations of the article. However, I
do believe that compelling arguments can be
given that force us to view the fetus as human
(and therefore possessing the right to life) from
the moment of conception.
I regard the question of abortion as a very
delicate and critical one — one which should be
openly and frequently discussed. It was not my
intent in writing the article to "preach" (to quote
Hoard), but rather to participate in the on-going
forum of discussion regarding abortion.
Simply because I used moral reasoning does
not, I believe, automatically mean I am "preach
ing." If the article sounded like the mere self
righteous preaching of one "who sits in judg
ment," then I have failed in realizing my inten
tions.
