# Beavers, Ducks to test Cards
## 
### PETER FINCH 
Hot off of a 73-50 trouncing
of the California Golden Bears
last Saturday night, Coach Dick
Dißiaso will take his Stanford
Cardinals into Oregon territory
this weekend. Meeting Ore
gon State Friday night and
Oregon Saturday, the Cards
are facing crucial contests.
The Stanford cagers, who
had been slipping since their
early season rampage, are now
apparently back on the win
ning track. Hanging on to a
slim two game winning streak,
the Cardinals desperately need
another victory in their quest
for their first winning season
since 1972-73. However, vic
tories in Oregon do not seem
to come too easily for Stanford.
Oregon State has ripped off
seven straight victories against

the Cards, two of which were
forfeited later because of an
ineligible OSU player (Lonnie
Shelton) in 1975-76.
"Oregon State," said Coach
Dißiaso, "is one of the premier
teams in the league. They have
a dominating center in Steve
)ohnson, and the ball-handling
skills to have offensive execu
tion."
Along with the 6-foot-10'/2
lohnson, OSU derives its scor
ing strength from 6-4 guards
Mark Radford and Ray Blume.
The Beavers, who came back to
beat Washington 68-66 last
Saturday, bring a 4-3 record
into Friday's contest.
The University of Oregon
Ducks, while falling on hard
times so far this season with a
6-10 record and a seat in the
Pac-10 cellar, have neverthe
less managed to snuff the

Cards in 10 out of their last 12
meetings. Six of those losses,
however, were decided by
only one point.
Despite the Ducks' poor re
cord, Dißiaso refuses to take
the game lightly. "People tend
to forget that Oregon lost only
one player from last year, ' he
said. "They have good experi
ence, and they've shown well
against many good teams."
Two close losses at the hands
of UCLA (74-71) and USC (70-
64) attest to the potential of this
Oregon squad. Leading the
Ducks' this year are 6-10 post
man Dan Hartshorne, 6-2
guard Rob Closs, 6-8 forward
Kelvin Small,and6-4swingman
Felton Sealey.
Stanford, which shot 59.3
percent from the field, and
outrebounded the Bears 44-26

in last weekend's game, also
managed to turn the ball over
only nine times, tying a season
low. Another important factor
in the victory at Berkeley was
the outside shooting of Brian
Welch, who hit for 17 points on
the night. Forward Kimberly
Belton also put in an impres
sive performance, scoring a
game high 18 points. Senior
Wolfe Perry regained the lead
in the Pac-10 scoring race by
contributing 13 points.
The Cardinals are in desper
ate need of two consistent out
ings this weekend. A couple of
repeat performances of last
weekend's contest is exactly
what Stanford needs to assure
them a pleasant trip to the
Great Northwest. Both games
may be heard live on KSFO
radio (560 AM) at 8 p.m.

DRIVE AND desire are two attributes, according to Card coach Dick Dißiaso, that have made senior
?;uard Paul Giovacchini (25) a team leader tor the Cardinals this year. Giovacchini and his teammates

only nine times, tying a season
low. Another important factor
in the victory at Berkeley was
the outside shooting of Brian
Welch, who hit for 17 points on
the night. Forward Kimberly
Belton also put in an impres
sive performance, scoring a
game high 18 points. Senior
Wolfe Perry regained the lead
in the Pac-10 scoring race by
contributing 13 points.
The Cardinals are in desper

them a pleasant trip to the
Great Northwest. Both games
may be heard live on KSFO
radio (560 AM) at 8 p.m.
