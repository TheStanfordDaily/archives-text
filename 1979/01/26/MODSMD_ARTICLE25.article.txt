# Card netters notch season opener
## 
### JOHN DOANE 
Ever since the birth of the
men's volleyball program here
three years ago, new freshmen
have annually played a big part
in the success achieved by the
Caidinals.
In the past two years,
freshman classes have contri
buted Rod Fletcher, Tom
Crimes, and Kim Lum in 1977,
and Dave Saeta in 1978, all star
ters in their first year. Not a
year to break with tradition,
1979 has added two more of
these freshman phenoms.
Newcomers Randy Smith
and Kip Engen showed no signs
of inexperience or nerves
Wednesday night in Stanford's
season debut as the two
freshmen led the Cards to a
14-16,15-7,15-8,15-17,15-7 vic
tory over stubborn Cal State-
Northridge.
Engen, a teammate of
Smith's at Laguna Beach High,
started his first college game as
setter. If Wednesday night's
performance was an indication
of things to come, the 5-foot-8
fireplug will certainly play a big
part in the future of Stanford
volleyball. Besides handling
the setting chores, Engen also
held his own at the net. De

spite his size, Engen blocked
effectively, especially in the
second game during which he
continually tormented 6-3
Matador standout Dave
McGrath. "For his first college
game," said assistant coach
John Bekins, "Kip played very
well."
Smith also proved to be a big
factor in the match by virtue of
his all-around play. The 6-0
outside hitter stood up espe
cially on defense where he dug
up nearly all hits pounded at
him, and responded quickly to
off-the-block deflections. Said
Bekins, "Randy's passing and
defense were excellent."
Plagued by crucial errors in
the first game, the Cards fell
behind steady-passing North
ridge and didn't catch up until
sterling defensive work by
Smith and the short-set duo of
Engen and Rod Fletcher tied
the game at 13. Dave Saeta's
roof block brought Stanford to
game point, 14-13, but the
tenacious Matadors ran off
three quick points to lock up
the first game.
"We really didn't know what
to expect from them (North
ridge)," said Bekins.
Led by McCrath and setter
lorge Ostrovsky, Northridge
came out swinging and con
founded Stanford by isolating
McGrath and middle hitter
Brian Lind in one-on-one situa
tions. The blocking combina
tion of Lind and McGrath also
raised problems for Cardinal
hitters.
In the second and third
games, the Cards appeared to
have caught on to Northridge's
tricks. Senior Rich Yardley took
over at the net in game two and

blocked for points, while mid
dle blocker Lum gave the
Matadors a good look at his
patented off-speed hitting. Re
lying on placement rather than
power, the Honolulu native in
variably approached Engen's
short sets with fearsome win
dups, only to softly bat the ball
between cringing defenders.
Just when it seemed as if the
Cards had overcome both
Northridge's feistiness and
first-match jitters, the
Matadors came steaming back.
Down 14-9 (match point),
Northridge went on a rampage
and pulled out the fourth game
17-15, evening the match at 2-2.
Outside hitter McGrath and
setter Ostrovsky combined on
a bone-jarring cross tandem at
15-15, and Northridge's hard
nosed defense then turned
back Stanford for the win.
Smith and Engen combined
once again for the first point of
game five, and from thereon, it
was all downhill for Stanford.
"Kamikaze" saves by Smith

and strong net play by Fletcher
and Yardley propelled the
Cards to a 9-0 lead. They nev>r
looked back.
Played in "rustic" Roble
Gym, the match was attended
by as many fans "as could line
the perimeter of the court. The
low rafters and general barn
like atmosphere at Roble pro
vided an amusing though
perhaps humiliating backdrop
for the 1979 season opener. At
one point, an unknowing stu
dent wandered out of the
Roble dance studio, oblivious
to the match, and walked in
front of a Northridge player in
the process of serving.
Reflecting on the shaky start,
Bekins noted that the first
match of the season is "usually
a little ragged." Bekins added,
"We're a very young team. In
two weeks we'll be a much bet
ter club."
The volleyballers will resume
play next Tuesday as they host
Santa Clara in Maples Pavilion
at 7:30 p.m.
