# Stanford skiers take to slopes
## 
### LIZ SCHERMER 
Believe it or not, Stanford
does have a ski team. An inter
collegiate club sport, the ski
team has strong talent for a
team that lives over 200 miles
from its training hill.
Both the women's alpine and
nordic teams sent racers to the
AIAW National Champion
ships in New Mexico last year,
and the men's alpine team gar
nered a spot in the NCAA Na
tionals in 1975.
This year, the 60-member
team has several skilled vete
rans along with some experi
enced racers new to the team.
Women's co-captain Barb
Lycan stated, "It's the biggest
ski team in Stanford's history.
This is the first year we've had a
waiting list for our member
ship."
Any skier can join the team,
whether or not he or she has
raced before, for one of the
team's objectives is to train
new racers and introduce
people to the sport of ski rac
ing.
The ski team rents a cabin in
North Lake Tahoe and travels
there every weekend during
the winter to race and train.

Stanford is in the Pacific Coast
Conference (PCC), which in
cludes, among others, UC Ber
keley, UC Davis, Alaska-
Fairbanks and Alaska-
Anchorage, Puget Sound and
Nevada-Reno. Nevada-Reno is
traditionally the strongest rival
in the conference because of
its proximity to the ski areas
and extensive training prog
ram.
"One of the main goals of
the ski team," according to
men's alpine captain Howie
Rosen, "is to beat Nevada-
Reno."
This season there are three
conference races in January
and February, beginning with
the Vanderbilt Cup at Heavenly
Valley on January 26-28. The
PCC Championships are Feb.
22-24 and the NCAA and AIAW
Nationals are the first two
weeks in March. Racers may
also race in the Far West Divi
sion of USSA if they wish. Far
West races occur almost every
weekend, are FIS-sanctioned
and more intensely competi
tive races.
The Stanford alpine teams
are coached part-time by
"Wild" Bill Gibson, but they

have no head coach. "We're
really disadvantaged by not
having a full-time coach and
being so far from the snow, but
we do our best to overcome
that by training hard when
we're up at Tahoe for the
weekends," Rosen com
mented.
The men's team, according
to Rosen, "has a lot more
depth than last year." "It's a
stronger team than when we
went to the NCAA s in 1975,"
he said. Returning lettermen
Wally Krengel, who placed fifth
in the slalom at the PCC
championships last year, and
Bill Volk, another strong racer,
will be joined by two experi
enced freshmen, Blake Jorgen
son and Hal Harvey.
The women's alpine and
nordic teams are co-captained
by Barb Lycan and Andrea De
wey. Both raced in the AIAW
championships last year and
also placed at the PCC champ
ionships. Dewey, who races
both cross-country and dow
nhill, placed second in cross
country, third in slalom and
fifth in giant slalom. Lycan skied
to a seventh in giant slalom and
another returning member,
Kate Schapi ro, placed eleventh
in slalom. They will be joined
by Jan Flaherty, an alpine team
veteran, and a few new and ex
perienced racers. Dewey is the
only one returning to the
cross-country team, but she
stated, "We have a really
strong women's nordic team."
Several experienced racers will
be skiing for the team this year.
The men's nordic team, cap
tained by Dave Parker, is
coached in cross-country and
jumping by alumnus Don Du-
Bain and his staff of assistants,
who also coach the women's
team. According to Parker,
"The men's team is going to be
dynamite this year. For the first
time we have some real depth
to work with. There are some
experienced freshmen on the
team and several strong old
racers, and we've finally got
people with decent equip
ment." The team is also "field
ing a full team (five) of en
thusiastic jumpers, which is
the best we've ever had," said
Parker. Returning to cross
country racing will be Parker,
Vic Haverly and Rob Lipton,
with some skilled newcomers
rounding out the team. Parker
is the only veteran jumper but
he has recruited five hard
working members to the sport.
The ski team is funded partly
by the Stanford Club Sports
program and by membership
dues. Club Sports helpspayfor
the cabin rental but most of the
money for equipment, lift tic
kets for racers at races, and the
cabin comes from dues. Team
members must also pay their
own travel and meal expenses
and for lift tickets on training
weekends.
Even with its disadvantages
the team races well and, more
importantly, has fun doing it.
"The ski team," commented
Rosen "besides being com
petitive, at the same time pro
vides for as many people as
ptpssible the thrills of racing."
