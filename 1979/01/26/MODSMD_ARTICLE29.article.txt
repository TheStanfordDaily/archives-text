## Women fall to Spartans, 76-56 
### RICH MARTINEZ 
The women's basketball
team played very generously
Wednesday evening allowing
San Jose State second and third
attempts on many of their
shots as the visitors defeated
Stanford, 76-56. The Spartans
took 20 more shots than the
Cards, now 2-3 in the league,
and any coach will attest that
statistic points to the victory
every time. Not as fine a shoot
ing team as Stanford, State
dominated underneath and
played with enough aggres
siveness to make their
namesakes proud.
The Cards did their best in
trying to offset the vital factors
and remain close in the first
half before the Spartans blitzed
the basket and their hopes.
State charged out to an open
ing lead of 10-2 before Stanford
called a time-out to regroup.
leanne Ruark then came out

and sank three 15-footers as
the freshman sensation
seemed to be the only Cardinal
not contained. Her play in
spired the rest of the team as
Stanford rallied to cut the Spar
tans' lead to 26-20.
The Cards had several
chances to cut the lead further
but the aggressive play of San
Jose made the breaks go to its
advantage as the lead was in
creased to 34-25 at halftime.
The Spartans outrebounded
Stanford 23 to 14 in the first half
and scored 10 points on sec
ond and third efforts.
As the second half com
menced the Cards might as
well have just stayed in the
locker room. In the first four
minutes the Spartans played
inspired, flawless ball as they
ran out to a comfortable 15
point lead, 47-32. Elinor Banks,
San Jose's 6-foot-3 center, fly
swatted Stanford shots at will
while pouring in 23 points,

guard Karen Mason, State's
only outside shooter, added 20
points and freshman forward
Debbi Johnson displayed her
awesome jumping ability while
collecting 10 caroms.
The Cards put themselves
out of the game, though, as
they could not take advantage
of the several errors they
forced San lose into. They
seemed to be bothered by the
large point deficit and the loss
of their intensity and concent
ration led to 19 second half
turnovers of their own. Stan
ford never made any serious
threats to the Spartans' lead
and the game ended with San
Jose on the upper end of a
comfortable 20 point victory.
Thus continues the educa
tion of a gifted but young Stan
ford team. The Cardinals, now
12-3 overall, may be the
deepest team in the league as
far as pure skills are con
cerned. They still are, though,

a bit short in the aggressive
ness department. The team will
no doubt be a respectable
squad as soon as they develop
more of the "killer instinct" on
the court.
Ruark and Louise Smith led
Stanford with 19 and 16 points
apiece. The Cards travel to
Stockton to face Pacific this
Saturday evening.

only outside shooter, added 20
points and freshman forward
Debbi Johnson displayed her
awesome jumping ability while
collecting 10 caroms.
The Cards put themselves
out of the game, though, as
they could not take advantage
of the several errors they
forced San lose into. They
seemed to be bothered by the
large point deficit and the loss
of their intensity and concent
ration led to 19 second half
turnovers of their own. Stan
ford never made any serious
threats to the Spartans' lead
and the game ended with San
Jose on the upper end of a
comfortable 20 point victory.
Thus continues the educa
tion of a gifted but young Stan
ford team. The Cardinals, now
12-3 overall, may be the
deepest team in the league as
far as pure skills are con
cerned. They still are, though,

a bit short in the aggressive
ness department. The team will
no doubt be a respectable
squad as soon as they develop
more of the "killer instinct" on
the court.
Ruark and Louise Smith led
Stanford with 19 and 16 points
apiece. The Cards travel to
Stockton to face Pacific this
Saturday evening.

The women's basketball
team played very generously
Wednesday evening allowing
San Jose State second and third
attempts on many of their
shots as the visitors defeated
Stanford, 76-56. The Spartans
took 20 more shots than the
Cards, now 2-3 in the league,
and any coach will attest that
statistic points to the victory
every time. Not as fine a shoot
ing team as Stanford, State
dominated underneath and
played with enough aggres
siveness to make their
namesakes proud.
The Cards did their best in
trying to offset the vital factors
and remain close in the first
half before the Spartans blitzed
the basket and their hopes.
State charged out to an open
ing lead of 10-2 before Stanford
called a time-out to regroup.
leanne Ruark then came out

and sank three 15-footers as
the freshman sensation
seemed to be the only Cardinal
not contained. Her play in
spired the rest of the team as
Stanford rallied to cut the Spar
tans' lead to 26-20.
The Cards had several
chances to cut the lead further
but the aggressive play of San
Jose made the breaks go to its
advantage as the lead was in
creased to 34-25 at halftime.
The Spartans outrebounded
Stanford 23 to 14 in the first half
and scored 10 points on sec
ond and third efforts.
As the second half com
menced the Cards might as
well have just stayed in the
locker room. In the first four
minutes the Spartans played
inspired, flawless ball as they
ran out to a comfortable 15
point lead, 47-32. Elinor Banks,
San Jose's 6-foot-3 center, fly
swatted Stanford shots at will
while pouring in 23 points,

guard Karen Mason, State's
only outside shooter, added 20
points and freshman forward
Debbi Johnson displayed her
awesome jumping ability while
collecting 10 caroms.
The Cards put themselves
out of the game, though, as
they could not take advantage
of the several errors they
forced San lose into. They
seemed to be bothered by the
large point deficit and the loss
of their intensity and concent
ration led to 19 second half

ford never made any serious
