# Carter proposes $5 million
## First step made to renew draft 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter is asking Congress for
$5 million to beef up the standby
draft system to meet the Pentagon's
"worst case" requirement for
enough men to fight a sudden,
bloody war in Europe.
But White House officials said this
is only a first step and not Carter's
final decision on new efforts to re
surrect draft registration — if not the
draft itself — that are expected to be
taken up early in the new session of
Congress.
The push for reworking the draft
system comes amid studies that
show the present system could not

turn out enough soldiers quickly in
the event of a European war in which
thousands of Cls were killed.
Senate Armed Services Chairman
)ohn C. Stennis (D-Mass.) said the
only answer is to bring back the draft
because the all-volunteer force can
not supply the technicians that the
military needs.
Draft registration
Pentagon officials, including Gen.
David Jones, chairman of the Join
Chiefs of Staff, favor renewal of draft
registration to create a pool of
people who could be drafted fast in a
sudden war.
The latest draft registration advo

cate, Army Secretary Clifford Ale
xander, said last week that women
should also be registered. He would
not say whether he thought women
should be drafted for combat.
Another option would be to draft
people into the military reserves and
create a trained force to send into a
sudden war.
No one knows yet how far Carter
and Congress will go. But the betting
is between improving the present
standby system or bringing back only
draft registration, not the draft itself.
For one thing, Stennis is the only
influential leader calling for renewal
of the peacetime draft. For another,
neither Carter nor most con
gressmen want to antagonize young
voters if they do not have to.
"Uneasy balance"
Defense Secretary Harold Brown
said yesterday there is an "uneasy
balance" of military power with the
Soviet Union.
Brown told the Senate Armed
Sevices Committee the Selective
Service System is not capable of
mobilizing enough manpower fast
enough in a military crisis.
Based on a "worst case" sudden
non-nuclear war in Europe, the Pen
tagon requires that the standby
Selective Service System supply the
first draftees in 30 days, 100,000 draf
tees in two months and 650,000 draf
tees in six months.
The Selective Service, with a skele
ton staff of 92 people, would have to
move that quickly from a standing
start.
Its present plan is to set up draft
offices in three days and within 15
days use state election machinery to
conduct a mass one-day registration
of more than four million young
people. It would conduct a draft lot
tery in 20 days and mail out draft
notices in 28 days.
In his prepared report, Brown de
clared that any Soviet military inter
vention in Iran "could require a U.S.
response." He was not asked about
Iran and did not discuss in any detail
the form of such a response to what
he stressed is a "hypothetical con
tingency."
The secretary said the Soviets have
been "relatively restrained" during
the Iranian turmoil.
