# Gymnasts face fine foes
## 
### DEAN EYRE 
Maples Pavilion will be the site of a pair of dual
gymnastics meets tomorrow night beginning at
7 p.m., the second of three home meets offering
men's and women's gymnastics run concur
rently.
Stanford's men host Cal State Northridge
while the women face visiting cross-bay oppo
nent Cal State Hayward, in what should prove to
be a gymnastics doubleheader as close, if not
more so, as last week's match-ups.
A common problem facing Stanford's gym
nastics coaches for this meet is a shortage of
information concerning the visiting teams. Al
though it can help to know your opponents
abilities, much less of an emphasis is placed on
scouting due to the individual nature of the ac
tual competition.
"I'm not sure how good they are right now
because I haven't received any of their scores,"
men's coach Sadao Hamada said of Northridge.
"But probably they are pretty close to us be
cause Northridge has always been a pretty
strong team. They've had good recruiting years
— there are so many good gymnasts in the Los
Angeles area. I think they will be pretty close to
us, as close as UCLA."
"Hayward is stronger than Pomona from their
scores," caid women's coach Jackie Walker. "I
was fairly confident that we could beat Pomona
unless we had a really bad meet; Hayward, I m
not so positive about. I believe they were strong
on uneven bars and floor exercise, which are
two events that I 'm looking for improvement on
on our team.
"It'll be very close. They have more depth
than Cal Poly and we'll find out if they have more
depth than we do. That's the whole point, she
added.
Besides giving the athletes a chance to display
their skills before the home-court fans, last
week's campus premiere offered the teams and
coaches a more clearly defined feeling tor
where they stand in relation to each other, other
teams and their potential. Each additional meet,
like those adventures known as exams, evalu
ates progress.
"Again we're going to go for consistency,
Walker explained. "This week in practice we're
working on some new skills, but they re not
ready to put them in their routines. Eliminating

the minor errors — the unpointed toes, bent
knees, a little bit of sloppiness — if we eliminate
those things we can easily pick up a few tenths of
a point per person."
"On some of the events li ke floor exercise and
high bar we are lacking difficulty," said Hamada.
"No one did a double back on floor ex and two
guys didn't do good enough dismounts on high
bar, so we're working on those. I think we're
ready to throw those harder tricks.
"If they do those, we should improve a lot
scorewise. It's a little bit of a gamble — whether
or not they can hit (the routines). If they miss
totally, we'll lose some points; on the other
hand it's oursecond meet and they should get a
little more consistency, cleanness. In those
areas they should pick up more points — I pre
dict, pertormancewise, a little better showing
than the last competition," Hamada added.
The men s team, with seven freshmen, far
from being overwhelmed in their first intercol
legiate meet, were understandably nervous, ac
cording to Hamada. He said that the less experi
enced gymnasts will be "a lot less nervous" in
tomorrow's showing.
"They at least now know what a college meet
will be like," he said. "They didn't expect that
kind of a crowd and the events went quickly. In
high school, one person competes at a time and
there's a lot of waiting. This difference was con
fusing, but once they get the idea, they'll be
performing better."
Like their male counterparts, the women look
forward to improved routines tomorrow. "Linda
(Park), Cindy Stevenson and Pilar (Ossorio) have
been improving — that's one reason we did beat
Pomona," Walker said. "If they can perform as
well as they did last Friday, then I'll be happy
whether they win or lose.
"Their goal is for each girl to pick up two
tenths of a point and if you add up four scores
per event, that comes out to 3.2. Last week we
had 111, so the team goal (tomorrow) would be
114 at least. I think they can hit that easily de
pending on whether or not everybody stays
healthy, Karen goes all-around and things like
that," Walker said.
leanette Lacoste, limited to performing on
uneven bars due to a knee injury, received her
doctor's approval to compete on beam and bars,
according to Walker.
