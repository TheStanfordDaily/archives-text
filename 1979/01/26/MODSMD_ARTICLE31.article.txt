A harried little man darts in
and out among the tables, al
ternately smiling and sighing as
he tries to seat al I of the people

now overflowing the small re
staurant. The man is Anan
"Bill" Sonsip, owner of the Vie
tnamese restaurant, Saigon,
and his rushing about is due to
the ebullient praise recently
awarded his restaurant by New
West and Gourmet magazines.
Described by Gourmet's re

viewer as "some of the best
eating in San Francisco" and by
a native of Vietnam as equal to
anything available in Saigon it
self, a visit to the restaurant
Saigon-is a must for oriental
food lovers. Its extensive menu
offers a refreshing change for
the jaded Chinese food addict

and will delight even the Viet
namese culinary connoisseur
with its selection of unusual
dishes. •
Among the soups available a
la carte is a sour soup, an un
usual mixture of pineapple,
tomato, green chiles, bean
sprouts, shrimp and chicken in
a thick chicken stock. Also av
ailable are a thickened crab
chicken-asparagus soup and
pho bo - noodles and onion in
a beef broth, included with
many of the entrees is a Viet
namese soup du jour. I hap
pened upon a thick chicken
and rice mash — a strange
though not unpleasant gruel.
One of the appetizers for
which the restaurant is known
is its "cha gio" or imperial roll,
similar to a Chinese spring roll.
These are made of rice paper
wrapped around minced pork,
mushrooms, carrots, shrimp
and bean sprouts. Unlike the
mustard or plumsauce accom
panying spring rolls, cha gio is
served with a sweet, hot sauce

"nuoc cham." Its base is a salty
fermented fish sauce typical of
Vietnamese cooking.
Shrimp tempura is also dip
ped in this sauce. The large
shrimps are encrusted in deep
fried yam strips which one can
then season with coriander,
mint and "rau ram," (a Viet
namese spice similar to basil).
Then, the whole thing is wrap
ped up in a lettuce leaf and
dipped into the nuoc cham
sauce.
Part of the fun of eating at
Saigon is the elaborate wrap
ping, folding and dipping in
struction provided by the wai
ter when he deposits each dish
at your table; many of the
finest dishes are finger foods
that require the diner to as
semble his own meal.
Some of the recommended
entrees include Five-Spice
Roast Chicken and Ho's Steak
— marinated beef covered
with peanuts and doused in
coconut milk served with an
array of fresh vegetables. The
Caramel Pork, cooked in soy

sauce, garlic, coconut milk and
sugar also sounded enticing.
Although the dish called In
visible Duck was enigmatic
enough that I was anxious to
try it, it turned out to be no
thing more than pieces of duck
"hidden" in a golden fried bat
ter of coconut and rice flour.
While the duck itself was ten
der and tasty, the very crunch
batter demanded more gnaw
ingenergy than I proved up to.
Though their selection of
desserts is not up to par with
the inventiveness of their other
courses, Saigon does make
wonderful tried bananas,
flamed with rum.
The wine list is not extensive,
but adequate. Perhaps a better
choice with Vietnamese
cuisine is particularly ap
preciated along with some of
their spicier dishes.
Part of the charm of Saigon is
its homey, friendly atmos
phere. The decor is not fancy
— kind of tacky, in fact, with its
black velvet paintings and plas
tic table cloths. Yet, at the same

time it manages to be cozy,
perhaps in part due to its dim
lighting but also to the Sonsip
family itself.
Until a year ago the restaur
ant was located on Potrero Av
enue in a neighborhood much
different from its present one
in the heart of San Francisco's
theater district. The move has
not changed the atmosphere
of this still very family
oriented, personal restaurant.
And even more surprisingly
the prices have remained very
reasonable. Entrees ranging
from $2-6.
Sonsip explained that his
family had always prided them
selves for quality not quantity,
but now, he sighed, with all
these people..."l've got to get
some more help now." If Son
sip seemed exhausted when I
talked to him, and unsure just
how delighted he was about
his restaurant's new success,
he certainly sparked up at men
tion of the review in New West.
"Did you see that picture of
me? Funny," he grinned.

desserts is not up to par with
the inventiveness of their other
courses, Saigon does make
wonderful tried bananas,
flamed with rum.
The wine list is not extensive,
but adequate. Perhaps a better
choice with Vietnamese
cuisine is particularly ap
preciated along with some of
their spicier dishes.
Part of the charm of Saigon is
its homey, friendly atmos
phere. The decor is not fancy
— kind of tacky, in fact, with its
black velvet paintings and plas
tic table cloths. Yet, at the same

time it manages to be cozy,
perhaps in part due to its dim
lighting but also to the Sonsip
family itself.
Until a year ago the restaur
ant was located on Potrero Av
enue in a neighborhood much
different from its present one
in the heart of San Francisco's
theater district. The move has
not changed the atmosphere
of this still very family
oriented, personal restaurant.
And even more surprisingly
the prices have remained very
reasonable. Entrees ranging
from $2-6.
Sonsip explained that his
family had always prided them
selves for quality not quantity,
but now, he sighed, with all
these people..."l've got to get
some more help now." If Son
sip seemed exhausted when I
talked to him, and unsure just
how delighted he was about
his restaurant's new success,
he certainly sparked up at men
tion of the review in New West.
"Did you see that picture of
me? Funny," he grinned.

A harried little man darts in
and out among the tables, al
ternately smiling and sighing as
he tries to seat al I of the people

now overflowing the small re
staurant. The man is Anan
"Bill" Sonsip, owner of the Vie
tnamese restaurant, Saigon,
and his rushing about is due to
the ebullient praise recently
awarded his restaurant by New
West and Gourmet magazines.
Described by Gourmet's re

viewer as "some of the best
eating in San Francisco" and by
a native of Vietnam as equal to
anything available in Saigon it
self, a visit to the restaurant
Saigon-is a must for oriental
food lovers. Its extensive menu
offers a refreshing change for
the jaded Chinese food addict

and will delight even the Viet
namese culinary connoisseur
with its selection of unusual
dishes. •
Among the soups available a
la carte is a sour soup, an un
usual mixture of pineapple,
tomato, green chiles, bean
sprouts, shrimp and chicken in
a thick chicken stock. Also av
ailable are a thickened crab
chicken-asparagus soup and
pho bo - noodles and onion in
a beef broth, included with
many of the entrees is a Viet
namese soup du jour. I hap
pened upon a thick chicken
and rice mash — a strange
though not unpleasant gruel.
One of the appetizers for
which the restaurant is known
is its "cha gio" or imperial roll,
similar to a Chinese spring roll.
These are made of rice paper
wrapped around minced pork,
mushrooms, carrots, shrimp
and bean sprouts. Unlike the
mustard or plumsauce accom
panying spring rolls, cha gio is
served with a sweet, hot sauce

"nuoc cham." Its base is a salty
fermented fish sauce typical of
Vietnamese cooking.
Shrimp tempura is also dip
ped in this sauce. The large
shrimps are encrusted in deep
fried yam strips which one can
then season with coriander,
mint and "rau ram," (a Viet
namese spice similar to basil).
Then, the whole thing is wrap
ped up in a lettuce leaf and
dipped into the nuoc cham
sauce.
Part of the fun of eating at
Saigon is the elaborate wrap
ping, folding and dipping in
struction provided by the wai
ter when he deposits each dish
at your table; many of the
finest dishes are finger foods
that require the diner to as
semble his own meal.
Some of the recommended
entrees include Five-Spice
Roast Chicken and Ho's Steak
— marinated beef covered
with peanuts and doused in
coconut milk served with an
array of fresh vegetables. The
Caramel Pork, cooked in soy

sauce, garlic, coconut milk and
sugar also sounded enticing.
Although the dish called In
visible Duck was enigmatic
enough that I was anxious to
try it, it turned out to be no
thing more than pieces of duck
"hidden" in a golden fried bat
ter of coconut and rice flour.
While the duck itself was ten
der and tasty, the very crunch
batter demanded more gnaw
ingenergy than I proved up to.
