HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
You've passed this restaur
ant for months, either heading
for Highway 101 or returning
from the New Varsity. Even
though it is usually crowded,
you have always wondered
how good it really is. The lure
of the Daily Special blackboard
in the window. The attraction
of a New York-style saloon.
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fait" prices, and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are
priced between $5 and $8, and
come with a choice of
homemade soup or house

salad.
The house soup one night
was potato and leek. Peppery
and hearty, but a little musky.
The house salad was crisp,
refreshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on
a bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
My only criticism was that the
spinach leaves were too large
and crunchy, and detracted
from the sole itself. Perfectly
cooked vegetables and better
than-average rice accom
panied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure
bet at Henry's. Both the sole
and the veal dishes were nota
bly not overpowered by salt.
The real character of the ingre

dients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces. Both
oversaving and oversaucing
are frequent faults of even the
best French restaurants.
An excellent cup of coffee
rounds out the meal.
Henry's in Palo Alto is re
miniscent of Perry's on Union
Street in San Francisco. Both
have great bars and a saloon
atmosphere. A major differ
ence between them, however,
is that Henry's is only a
bikeride away.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the backroom.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.

Henry's with its attraction of a New York-style saloon, is only a bike ride away on University Ave. In
addition, Henry's offers fair prices, generous portions and a great atmosphere.
