# Not by bread alone
## Food for thought 
### Harry Killas 
"We sat down at a candle-lit table,
taking time to notice the authenticity
which we sensed in the people and de
cor...After all, if you go on a Saturday
night ypu can try to tip the belly-dancer
by slipping a dollar in her belt as she
switches her hips and shimmies away
while at the same time staring deeply
into your eyes and rhythmically raising
her eyebrows at you."
This is an excerpt from "Favorable
Curry," a restaurant review by a student
here that, happily, was never published
in the Daily. It typifies much of what is
rotten in the state of restaurant reviews:
incorrect word usage, compulsion to
record useless detail, and pretentious
ness. But "Favorable Curry" is a pale
amateur when compared with the follow
ing excerpt from a restaurant column in
a professional, much-revered
"magazine of good living:"
"Although I had worked up a hearty
appetite during the course of a lunch
less day, my zuppa di pesce alia triestina
was more, by at least half, than I could
handle. A sumptuous melange of im
peccably fresh striped bass, shrimp,
mussels, clams and squid in a zesty re
duction of shellfish essence, fish stock,
chopped tomato, and brown sauce, the
dish was vastly satisfying.
"I may have failed to go the route with
my fish stew, but the third member of
our party, a dainty morsel who'd have to
fill her handbag with lead to tip the
scales at a hundred pounds, was simply
wiped out by her veal chops. ..The wai
ter lugged to the table two of the hef
tiest slabs of milkfed veal any of us had
ever laid eyes on, and after sparring with
them for over half an hour, the lady in
question hadmade little discernable
headway."
First, incorrect word usage. How is it
possible to reduce, albeit zestily, the
essence of shellfish. By definition es
sence has been reduced to its most re
duced state. Moreover, the author
seeks to reduce not only the shellfish
essence, which is an impossibility, but
also the fish stock, chopped tomato and
brown sauce. This sentence would have

confused even William Faulkner.
Secondly, a compulsion to record
useless detail. Of what relevance is the
third member of the party to the review?
Picture, if you can, a dainty 80-pound
morsel fighting for her life against a pair
of ravaging veal chops. On her plate. In
an Italian restaurant. In Manhattan.
Likewise, it is difficult to believe that
the reader will benefit from knowing
that the reviewer worked up a hearty
appetite before eating only half his
meal. Did the author have a rough game
of racquetball in the morning, or did he
work up a sweat while preparing Eggs
Benedict for breakfast? Either way,
surely he should have felt compelled to
reveal the cause of his stomach's anxi
ety. And anyway, who gives a damn?
Thirdly, pretentiousness. This is the
most difficult to pin down and the most
subjective. Long titles in foreign lan
guages present problems for the aver
age reader. In fact, although zuppa di
pesce alia triestiria only means fish stew
Trieste-style, the reader is put off by the
time he wades through the lengthy list
of its components.
I consider the "milkfed" description
as an example of the writer's pedantry;
it is irrelevant to the body of the text.
Furthermore, why couldn't the author
have said that the woman could not
finish her meal rather than "made little
discernable headway" into her "slabs of
veal"? Sheer pretentiousness.
Thus one can understand how a Stan
ford'student writing restaurant reviews
is caught up in what seems to be a gen
eral trend in food journalism. This
trend, set by prominent magazines and
newspapers, is exemplified by an arti
cle, "The Cooking Craze," a Time spe
cial feature that represented the zenith
of culinary insipidity.
Is it so difficult to write elegant and
informative yet simple prose on the re
staurant page? Is it necessary to preface
every review by a complex description
of the ambience and decor of the re
staurant? How can we tolerate further
the "natural woods that provide a de
lightful counterpoint to the natural

ferns in the light and airy atmosphere"
of California chic?
Such strained prose is manifested
more grotesquely in the descriptions of
the dishes themselves. Prawns are
either succulent or tough; meat is al
most always succulent; and vegetables
are alwayssucculent and a/ dente (to the
tooth). There are elaborate descriptions
of how the meat lies next to its stuffing,
"smothered in a delectable, creamy
textured sauce."
It is all part of the restaurant reviewing
ritual.
So what does one look for in reading
restaurant reviews? We want to find out
the essentials: the quality of the food;
the service, the atmosphere. Is the re
staurant worth our time and money? It is
the responsibility of the reviewer,
moreover, to present this information
with clarity and simplicity, with relev
ant, interesting and useful information.
We don't wish to hear about the writer's
marital problems or indigestion. How
ever, if the food gave the reviewer indi
gestion,the reviewer should mention it.
If the food really turned the reviewer
on, he should mention that too. But why
mention that the meal left you in a sub
lime, quixotic mood that could only be
satisfied by a bottle of Moulin-a-Vent
and a wheel of brie.
Finally, it may be that writing about
food and restaurants, more than other
journalistic fields, lends itself to verbos
ity, bastardized prose and grotesque
parody. The idea of someone reviewing
restaurants fora living provokes two dif
ferent reactions in us. We are envious
that someone can make a living through
appeals to his hedonistic self and to the
"good life." We are also nauseated, for
the thought of someone eating as much
as possible, writing about his experi
ences forkful by forkful, contravenes
our ideal of the "thin" society.
The final violation made by restaurant
critics goes beyond improper word Us
age, pretentiousness and an inability to
write. It reveals one thing more: an ina
bility to think critically.
