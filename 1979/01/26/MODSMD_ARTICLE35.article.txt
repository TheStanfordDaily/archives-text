### MARK CHONG 
"Good morning Mary. This is
the Call Girls. Better dress
warmly today. It's wet and cold
outside. Have a good day.
Bye!"
This cheery greeting is a
sample of the many, varied
messages used by the Univer
sity's Call Girls.
From 6 to 9 a.m., junior
Suzanne Hennacy and senior
Celia Smith, alias the Call Girls,
wake up students who have
contracted and paid for the
service.
"We'll do just about any
thing to wake someone up,"
Smith said. "We'll hum, whis
tle, sing and wake you up to
any message you want."
"Usually we'll just say 'good
morning' and then give the
person a handy weather tip for
the day," added Hennacy. "It'll
vary from day to day and de
pend on what we feel like say
ing at that time in the morn-

Smith started the fledgling
enterprise two years ago in an
attempt to make money.
"I thought it would be fun,"
she said. "My mom came up
with the name, and Suzanne
and I decided to try it out."
The women went to the
Legal Counseling Office here
and spoke with a lawyer about
the legality and possible liabil
ity of the proposed organiza
tion.
According to the lawyer, the
Call Girls must assume liability
equal only to the subscription
rate of $10 per quarter.
"Now we can't be sued for
$40,000 by someone who mis
sed their grad school exams
because we failed to wake
them up," Smith said.
Moreover, the Call Girls
acknowledge no responsibil
ity beyond one phone call to a
subscriber per day .They let the
phone ring a maximum of eight

times.Refunds are given only if
the subscriber leaves school.
Both Hennacy and Smith be
lieve there is a need for their
service here. According to
Hennacy people do not always
get up when they hear an alarm
clock. Thev ' con
ditio?' . .cralize that the
means they must wake
up and start the day. "Many
people would rather remain in
bed. However, they have to
wake up for a phone call," she
said.
"We'll make sure that they
are functioning and thinking
when we call," Smith said.
The Call Girls offer special
services on grad school exam
mornings, or for other pres
sing engagements like a crucial
romantic rendezvous.
They will wake people up in
foreign languages if told what
to say and how to pronounce
the words, Smith said.
Hennacy said the business

has received subscriptions
from athletes who must rise
early for workouts. Some of
these subscribers want their
wake-up messages based on a
theme mentioning the
athlete's sport.
According to Hennacy, the
Call Girls have also sold gift
subscriptions to students who
want to surprise unsuspecting
friends.
Hennacy said only one per
son has been "tiffed" by their
name. The Call Girls view their
title as "a clever, catchy" name
for their business. "We're not
trying to make any judgments
about anyone," said Smith.
"The name just seemed apt."
Despite initial worries, the
business is doing well finan
cially.
Now that the Call Girls have
enjoyed success, they have en
tertained thoughts of writing
about their experiences and
maybe selling their business
next year.
Hennacy added, "Someday
this business will be a conver
sation piece — a good cocktail
party story."
