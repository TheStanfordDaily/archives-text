# Product liability: a growing concern
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” If you're
injured because your au
tomobile gas tank is in a
dangerous place or because
your food processor blade
spins when your hand is in the
bowl, you want some compen
sation.
But if you're the manufac
turer, you don't want to be
sued by someone who altered
your product to make it
dangerous or who bought the
product 30 years ago.
Those concerns make up
two sides of product liability, a
growing legal and consumer
issue that is the subject of eight
bills in the legislative session
with many more anticipated.
The Assembly judiciary
Committee, where many of last
year's dozen product liability
bills died, is planning to con
sider all the bills together in the
next few months.
This year's committee has
new members and a new
chairman, Assembleyman lack
Fenton (D-Montebello) and
the business industry people
who are backing most of the
bills hope they have a better

chance.
One reason last year's bills
got nowhere was because the
Legislature was awaiting the
report of its joint Committee
on Tort Liability on a two-year
study of the entire area of how
people injured through negli
gence are compensated.
The committee's recom
mendations came out this
month, and suggested that a

law be passed extending the
legal principle of comparative
liability to all such cases, fol
lowing the lead of a 1975 State
Supreme Court ruling.
That ruling said an award for
damages could be reduced by
a judge or a jury by the percen
tage that the person suing was
himself responsible for the ac
cident.
