# 'Nonformal' education helps solve acute worker shortage in Bolivia
## 
### KATHY ANDREWS 
Worker shortages and mod
ern industrialization efforts
have forced Bolivia to develop
a nonformal educational sys
tem to supplement the regular
system, engineer Michael
Goldway told about 60 people
at Bechtel International Center
Tuesday.
Goldway, chief technical ad
viser for the United Nations'
International Labor Organiza
tion (ILO) in Latin America,
explained that under the pre
sent Bolivian formal educa
tional system, only 3 percent of
the students entering first
grade attain a secondary level
education. About one-half of 1
percent will graduate from a
university, he said.
Students often leave school
to find work and contribute to
family income, Goldway said.
"There simply is not enough
trained manpower coming
from the formal education sys
tem to supply the country's in
dustrial needs," he said.
New technology and
methods of production intro
duced by multinational corpo
rations and modernized na
tional industries created the
need for a larger trained labor
force, Goldway said.
Training centers
In an effort to narrow the gap
between the market's de
mands and the supply of work
ers, the ILO asssisted Bolivia in
its development of a
supplementary nonformal
educational system in 1974. In
this system, experienced
workers work in training cen
ters with students of all age*
and educational backgrounds.
According to Goldway, the
training courses are adapted to
specific market demands and
benefit more people than the
formal system.
While the formal academic
system has produced about 150
trained workers in the last four
years, the nonformal system
has produced 4000 workers at a

significantly lower cost, Gold
way said.
Investments for the system's
building, mobile center and
equipment are covered by a
$10 million World Bank loan,
Goldway said. A 1 percent tax
levied on industrial salaries de
frays annual operation costs,
he said.
Program flexibility has al
lowed the nonformal system to
innovate new training systems,
Goldway said. The ILO intro
duced a modular traning sys
tem, which provides students
with about six months of in
struction for a specialized
technical skill, he said.
Since a more broadly trained
student from the formal educa
tional system would require
three to four years of instruc
tion, the modular system
supplies the market with
trained workers more rapidly,
Goldway said.
The system also provides op

tions for workers to continue
their formal education after
completing the initial phase of
the program, he added.
The nonformal education
system encountered resistance
from some sources, Goldway
said.
"The government yields to
pressures from ruling groups
and will spend relatively more
money on universities than on
the lower schools," he said.
The present high attrition rates
for the lower levels has also af
fected this policy, he added.
Goldway cautioned that "no
amount of training will create
jobs and relieve unemploy
ment." The nonformal educa
tional system will only help to
solve the skilled manpower
shortage problem, he said.
"If you want to change the
system, don't start with the
schools. They will always per
petuate the existing system,"
Goldway said.
