Madame Rosa itititir
Sunday, Mem Aud
The performance of Simone
Signoret as Madame Rosa, a Jew
who finds herself in charge of an
Arab boy after his prostitute
mother can not take care of him,
vitalizes this uneven but ulti
matelycompellingfilm. Signoret,
once legendary for her beauty,
allows herself to look haggish
and eccentric here; the way this
woman throws herself into her
role makes it easy to ignore the
film's weaknesses in technique
and structure. A sometimes mov
ing, often amusing film.
—Jim Mattson
Amarcord itititir
Friday, Kresge
Director Federico Fellini re
minisces about his childhood in
this warm, sometimes scatologi
cal, and always funny movie. Fel
lini's memories of a boyhood
spent in Mussolini's Italy are em
bellished by the director's inimit
able style and wit. While he was
making Amarcord, Fellini de
scribed it as a presentation of
"one man's attempt to overcome
the alienation of today by creat
ing another reality out of his past
joyful experiences." Whether
they were his own experiences or
merely those he imagined, Fellini
succeeded here in his goal of
making a new reality.

Citizen Kane itititir
Monday, Cubberley
Citizen Kane's reputation of
being the greatest film ever made
has the effect of making it sound
about as interesting as the Magna
Carta. But, gratifyingly, the
greatest film may also be the one
that is the most engrossing and,
unexpectedly, the most sheer
fun to watch. Herman J. Man
kewicz wrote the script for this
thinly-veiled retelling of the
career of newspaper magnate
William Randolph Hearst. Orson
Welles and his cameraman Gregg
Toland put so much cinematic
virtuosity into Kane that watching
it is like watching a magician
who, because he takes so much
delight in his tricks, makes the
audience take delight in them
too. Welles stars as Kane; also
present are Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead, and Everett
Sloane.

My Fair Lady ★★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
I saw this one on TV, but I do
know that Rex Harrison plays Pro
fessor Higgins like someone
who's played it a million times
(which he has), Audrey Hepburn
does her best Julie Andrews im
pression, and the whole movie
does its best George Bernard
Shaw impression. Great songs.
Loved it.
—Robert Ackley
The Big Sleep ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Howard Hawks once admitted
that neither he nor scriptwriters
William Faulkner, Jules Furthman
and Leigh Bracket ever really
knew how all the clues fit to
gether in this dark, violent, and
very entertaining adaptation of
Raymond Chandler's murder
mystery. Humphrey Bogart stars
as detective Philip Marlowe;
Lauren Bacall and Martha Vickers
play the oddly mismatched sis
ters who complicate his life.
—J.M.
The Maltese Falcon ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
You've probably never heard
of this movie, because it's not the
kind of picture that people would

copy or satirize. Despite that, this
is one of those great movies.
Humphrey Bogart's characteriza
tion of detective Sam Spade takes
Dashiell Hammett's original con
ception to the limit — he's tough,
cynical and perhaps more than a
little bit crazy. Bogart is joined by
some other people you've never
heard of named Astor, Lorre and
Creenstreet. Directed by the
obscure John Huston.
—Ron Lillejord
Silent Running it if it
New Varsity
Douglas Trumbull did the spe
cial effects f0r2007 and Close En
counters; in this 1973 movie, he
got a chance to direct. Trumbull
ends up making a small-scale
2007 clone, but the movie is
never really unpleasant, and
Bruce Dern is interesting to
watch as a man in the year 2008
who is the sole defender of the
last vestige of botanical speci
mens remaining from Earth.
—R.L.
King of the Cypsies "kit
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you're in the right mood, this
silly mock epic about a clan of
gypsies in the big city is surpris
ingly entertaining. Vou could
spend days just trying to figure
out the genetics of this family, in
which the most amazingly di
verse looking people are sup
posed to be closely related. Sterl
ing Hayden and Shelley Winters
get top billing, but the only per
formances worth watching are by
Susan Sarandon as a gutsy, vib
rant gypsy woman, and new
comer Eric Roberts as the son
who realizes that the gypsies
must adapt to the 20th century.
—J.M.
The Wiz if
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical; lots of every
thing — but make sure we don't
offend anybody. In his desire to
energize this sprawling mess,
Sidney Lumet, the director, sim
ply increased the budget, turned
the volume up and enlarged the
sets. Subtlety and individuality
are trampled by all the technol
ogy-
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multicolored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? You can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so huge, so loud in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
board rooms.
—R.L.
Moment by Moment Ml
Guild, Menk) Park
The very talented Lily Tomlin
and the enormously popular
John Travolta combine their ef
forts here; the result is an in
explicably bad movie. The direc
tor, Jane Wagner, is a woman,
but instead of helping Tomlin
give her character unusual
depth, as one would have ex
pected, Wagner allows Tomlin to
give a performance which seems
to have been drawn from her
nightclub laugh. Unfortunately,
all the laughs have been left out,
so Tomlin's character merely
seems excruciatingly flat. As
May-December romances go,
this one should.

Autumn Sonata ★★★ Vi
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Palo Alto Square ★★★★
This nearly flawless thriller,
which deals with an invasion by
aliens who come in the form of
harmless-looking flowers, will
have you looking suspiciously at
every vegetable in your re
frigerator. lOTBS is set in San
Francisco, and seldom has the
city looked more beautiful than
here as the control center for the
take-over of the human race.
Donald Sutherland and Brooke
Adams star as two people who
are desperately trying to keep
their own identities; Leonard
Nimoy is the villain who works to
take them away. Phil Kaufman di
rected, stunningly.
—J.M.
Lord of the Rings ★
Old Mill
One of last year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat and
Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after
more than two hours we are in
formed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—J.M.
No Time For Breakfast ★★★
Aquarius Theatre, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
this is a good movie about a doc
tor who discovers how comfort
less the ministrations of her pro
fession can be when she finds
she is dying of cancer. Annie
Girardot, who gave last year's
Dear Detective any merit it pos
sessed, turns what was poten
tially soap-opera material into a
very moving performance.
—J.M.
Animal House ★★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has a
decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

Movie-Movie ★ ★★
Old Mill
Stanley Donen, who directed
Singing in the Rain, possibly the
greatest musical Hollywood ever
produced, directed this skillful
parody of a '30s double bill.
One is a boxing film, in a concise
black-and-white imitation called
Dynamite Hands. The other is a
musical called Baxter's Beauties of
1033, filmed in superbly gaudy
thirtyish color. George C. Scott
is surprisingly adept with his
comedy roles in each of the two
films within a film. His imperso
nation of a Ziegfield-type Broad
way producer named Spats Bax
ter is very sleek.
—J.M.

Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

Midnight Express
Biograph, Palo Alto
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—|.M.
California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets off
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the Jane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the
ordinary sound witless and
fo reed.
—R.L.

Magic ★★
Old Mill
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's a dummy in the Judy Car
land part and the star-on-the
way-down role is taken by An
thony Hopkins as a ventriloquist.
Director Richard Attenborough
pulls off one or two scary mo
ments, but this pseudo
psychological story about a ven
triloquist who becomes obses
sed with his own mannequin has
been done many times before —
and better.
—|.M.
In Praise of Older Women ★
Palo Alto Square
This is notable only because it
is probably the most sexually
explicit film released under an
"R" rating. Other than that, how
ever, this story of, according to
the press release, "the amorous
adventures of a virile young man,
glorifying in the sexual prowess
of older women," has little to
commend it: the single-minded
plot gets downright boring. Tom
Berenger is featured; Karen Black
is his first "older woman." Hun
garian George Kaczender directs.
