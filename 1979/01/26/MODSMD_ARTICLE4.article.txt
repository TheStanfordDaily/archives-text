### JONATHAN SLATER SAMUEL HOWE 
Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, discussed the strategic im
perative of ratification of the SALT II
accords before an audience of more
than 150 people in Kresge Au
ditorium last night.
Drell spoke of a "balance of ter
ror" between the United States and
the U.S.S.R. resulting from a policy
of deterrence which makes the two
countries "mutual hostages."
He said that today people live in a
time without historical precedent
which is reflected by a "policy of
great and growing risks." He added
that the arms talks represent the "fi
nal effort to reduce these risks and
make deterrence work."
At stake, he said, is the issue of
strategic stability, "The specific task
of SALT is to see that nuclear
weapons deployment meets the
criteria of stability," he added.
Drell listed these criteria as:
— responsive and effective com
mand and control,
— alternatives to massive retalia
tion,
— forces which are survivable
against any single attack, however
massive, and
— a "reasonable balance of
strategic weapons among the two

countries."
The SALT talks were initiated more
than nine years ago, and resulted in
the first SALT treaty signed in 1972 by
Nixon and Brezhnev. It limited the
use and development of anti-ballistic
missiles.
Following that agreement, accord
ing to Drell, Ford and Brezhnev es
tablished a framework for future
SALT accords at their Vladivostak
summit in 1974.
"SALT II recognizes the fact that
the Soviet Union has reached a posi
tion of technical parity with the Un
ited States," Drell said. But he noted
that although the treaty establishes
an overall equivalence between the
two nations, it does not lead to any
specific reduction of arms.
In this regard, he said, "SALT is a
disappointingly modest provision.
It's no big deal."
Drell also said that President
Jimmy Carter stated at the United Na
tions in 1977 that both the United
States and the Soviet Union could cut
theirstrategicarsenals in half with no
effect on our security or our policy.
He said that "this challenge of con
trolling nuclear weapons and avoid
ing nuclear war is the most pressing
problem of our generation; should
we fail in this challenge and nuclear
war occur, the consequences defy
the imagination."
