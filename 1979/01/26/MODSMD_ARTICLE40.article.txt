Gov't bars Khomeini homecoming
Tehran, Iran — The beleaguered iranian gov
ernment yesterday managed to keep its key foe,
Ayatullah Khomeini, out of the country for at least
three more days. But the angry Moslem holy man
rejected an appeal to put off his homecoming for
three weeks or more.
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar's govern
ment also was given its biggest show of public
support yet. Tens of thousands of anti-Khomeini
demonstrators marched in Tehran, and similar
pro-government demonstrations were reported in
several other cities.
There were reports of scattered violence
elsewhere between rival factions. Military au
thorities said 29 armed Afghanis were arrested dur
ing clashes in Tehran yesterday. The Bakhtiar gov
ernment contends Afghani communists have been
fomenting disorders in the capital.
The 78-year-old Khomeini, leader of the move
ment that forced Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
into an indefinite "vacation" abroad, had planned
to end almost 15 years of exile and fly back to Iran
Friday. But the Iranian military shut down the
country's airports, supposedly until midnight
Saturday, in what appeared to be an effort to block
his plans.
Khomeini, patriarch of Iran's 32 million Shiite
Moslems, says he intends to replace the Bakhtiar
government, appointed by the shah, with an Is
lamic republic under his guidance.
It was announced at Khomeini's headquarters
in-exile in France he was postponing his return
until at least Sunday. If the airport shutdowns ex
tend beyond that, said Khomeini aide Ibrahim
Yazdi, there are "alternative plans" for getting to
Iran. He would not elaborate.
Pope makes first whistlestop
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic — Pope
John Paul II knelt to kiss the Dominican soil yes
terday as he started his "mission to spread the
gospel" in a week-long Latin American visit.
At 12:40 p.m. EST, the pope stepped from the
door of the jetliner, smiled and spread his arms

wide as he walked down the steps of the plane
onto this Caribbean island.
"The pope wants his mission to be one of
spreading the gospel. That is why I decided to
arrive here following the route that, at the time of
the discovery of the New World, was established
by the first missionaries," the pontiff said in
Spanish during his airport address.
Parents flee with Laetrile child
Scituate, Mass. — Chad Green's parents have
whisked him into hiding, and the judge who for
bade Laetrile treatments for the 3-year-old
leukemia victim said yesterday they could face
kidnapping charges.
Gerald and Diana Green left behind a note say
ing that "Chad must be protected from any 112 urther
ignorance and pride, greed and violence."
The little blond boy's grandmother, with whom
the family had been living, said the parents were
"distraught" over a Plymouth County Superior
Court order Tuesday prohibiting them from giving
Chad Laetrile and vitamins to fight his cancer. He
had also been receiving chemotherapy, under a
previous order from the same judge.
Judge Guy Volterra, who had issued the orders,
said the couple could face criminal sanctions, in
cluding kidnapping charges. He directed George
Donovan, the couple's lawyer, to try to find his
clients.
Senate OKs convention measure
Sacramento — A resolution backed by Gov. Jerry
Brown calling for a constitutional convention to
force a balanced federal budget cleared the state
Senate yesterday despite warnings it could trigger
a constitutional crisis.

the upper house approved a measure demanding
the convention if Congress fails to adopt a con
stitutional amendment requiring a balanced
budget.
The 24-14 vote, three more than the 21-vote
majority needed for passage, sent the proposal,
SJR 2 by Sen. jerry Smith (D-Saratoga), to the As
sembly, where Speaker Leo McCarthy (D-San

Francisco), has vowed to try to kill it.
Congress must call a convention if 34 states pass
resolutions requesting one. So far, 24 have done
so.
UFW asked to meet with Feds
San Diego — Negotiators for lettuce growers and
the United Farm Workers of America were asked
yesterday to meet with federal mediators after the

A spokesman for lettuce shippers said both
sides would go to Los Angeles today at the sum
mons of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service.
He said, without elaborating: "We are making
progress, in a small way."
But UFW spokesman Marc Grossman said there
was "no progress in the talks. And he denied
growers' claims that union representatives had ag
reed to meet with federal mediators, saying, "I
don't know where they got that. We are not going
to be there.
"We are not deadlocked," Grossman said. "The
federal mediators are not needed. We can reach
an agreement if the growers will just negotiate in
good faith."

the upper house approved a measure demanding
the convention if Congress fails to adopt a con
stitutional amendment requiring a balanced
budget.
The 24-14 vote, three more than the 21-vote
majority needed for passage, sent the proposal,
SJR 2 by Sen. jerry Smith (D-Saratoga), to the As
sembly, where Speaker Leo McCarthy (D-San

Francisco), has vowed to try to kill it.
Congress must call a convention if 34 states pass
resolutions requesting one. So far, 24 have done
so.
UFW asked to meet with Feds
San Diego — Negotiators for lettuce growers and
the United Farm Workers of America were asked
yesterday to meet with federal mediators after the
pickers' strike spread to two more vegetable farms
and more than 60 strikers were arrested for violat
ing a court injunction.
A spokesman for lettuce shippers said both
sides would go to Los Angeles today at the sum
mons of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service.
He said, without elaborating: "We are making
progress, in a small way."
But UFW spokesman Marc Grossman said there
was "no progress in the talks. And he denied
growers' claims that union representatives had ag
reed to meet with federal mediators, saying, "I
don't know where they got that. We are not going
to be there.
"We are not deadlocked," Grossman said. "The
federal mediators are not needed. We can reach
an agreement if the growers will just negotiate in
good faith."

Gov't bars Khomeini homecoming
Tehran, Iran — The beleaguered iranian gov
ernment yesterday managed to keep its key foe,
Ayatullah Khomeini, out of the country for at least
three more days. But the angry Moslem holy man
rejected an appeal to put off his homecoming for
three weeks or more.
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar's govern
ment also was given its biggest show of public
support yet. Tens of thousands of anti-Khomeini
demonstrators marched in Tehran, and similar
pro-government demonstrations were reported in
several other cities.
There were reports of scattered violence
elsewhere between rival factions. Military au
thorities said 29 armed Afghanis were arrested dur
ing clashes in Tehran yesterday. The Bakhtiar gov
ernment contends Afghani communists have been
fomenting disorders in the capital.
The 78-year-old Khomeini, leader of the move
ment that forced Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
into an indefinite "vacation" abroad, had planned
to end almost 15 years of exile and fly back to Iran
Friday. But the Iranian military shut down the
country's airports, supposedly until midnight
Saturday, in what appeared to be an effort to block
his plans.
Khomeini, patriarch of Iran's 32 million Shiite
Moslems, says he intends to replace the Bakhtiar
government, appointed by the shah, with an Is
lamic republic under his guidance.
It was announced at Khomeini's headquarters
in-exile in France he was postponing his return
until at least Sunday. If the airport shutdowns ex
tend beyond that, said Khomeini aide Ibrahim
Yazdi, there are "alternative plans" for getting to
Iran. He would not elaborate.
Pope makes first whistlestop
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic — Pope
John Paul II knelt to kiss the Dominican soil yes
terday as he started his "mission to spread the
gospel" in a week-long Latin American visit.
At 12:40 p.m. EST, the pope stepped from the
door of the jetliner, smiled and spread his arms

wide as he walked down the steps of the plane
onto this Caribbean island.
"The pope wants his mission to be one of
spreading the gospel. That is why I decided to
arrive here following the route that, at the time of
the discovery of the New World, was established
by the first missionaries," the pontiff said in
Spanish during his airport address.
Parents flee with Laetrile child
Scituate, Mass. — Chad Green's parents have
whisked him into hiding, and the judge who for
bade Laetrile treatments for the 3-year-old
leukemia victim said yesterday they could face
kidnapping charges.
Gerald and Diana Green left behind a note say
ing that "Chad must be protected from any 112 urther
ignorance and pride, greed and violence."
The little blond boy's grandmother, with whom
the family had been living, said the parents were
"distraught" over a Plymouth County Superior
Court order Tuesday prohibiting them from giving
Chad Laetrile and vitamins to fight his cancer. He
had also been receiving chemotherapy, under a
previous order from the same judge.
Judge Guy Volterra, who had issued the orders,
said the couple could face criminal sanctions, in
cluding kidnapping charges. He directed George
Donovan, the couple's lawyer, to try to find his
clients.
