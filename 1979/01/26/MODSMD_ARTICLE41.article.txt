# Marshall's portrayal kicks off Black month
## 
### ROBERT REED 
The quarter-long "Black Liberation
Month" holds its first major event
tonight as William Marshall portrays
Frederick Douglass, the famed
abolitionist of the 1800s, in a one
man play at 7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Marshall's performance will be just
one of the many events in the weeks
to come aimed at heightening black
awareness at Stanford.
The purpose of Black Liberation
Month here is two-fold, according to
Sue Ross, assistant to the chairper
son of the African and Afro-American
Studies Department.
"Black Liberation Month has two
purposes. One internal — to give us
(blacks) a time to reflect upon our
history, to celebrate black culture
and to look at strategies for the fu
ture. The other is external — to ex
pose black history and black culture
to the broader Stanford commun
ity."
"Through television"
Ross explained that "most whites
only learn about blacks through tele
vision" and that Black Liberation
Month gives them a chance to, in
effect, "experience" the black ex
perience.
Black Liberation Month here is
put together through the joint efforts
of the various black organizations on
campus. The month began yesterday
and will continue through March 3,
when an all-day symposium on "The
State of Black America 1979 and
Strategies for Liberation" wraps up
the six weeks of activities.
However, related activities, spon
sored by other groups, won't end
until after jazzman Dizzie Gillespie's
performance here on March 16.
Other major events of Black Liber

ation Month, the complete calendar
of which was published in yester
day's Daily, include the performance
of two controversial one-act plays,
"The Owl Killer" and"Day of Ab
sence," February 1-3; a benefit per
formance of the South African play,
"Sizwe Bansi is Dead," February 9;
and a multimedia presentation on
Feb. 22 of "Recent Black History at
Stanford."
The theme of this year's Black Lib
eration Month here is "Our Social
Responsibility to the Black Commun
ity."
While Black Liberation Month ac
tivities at the University have taken
place only in the last decade, the
roots of this time of "awareness"
began in 1926 when Carter G. Wood
son, a noted black historian,
founded a national "Negro Ffistory
Week."
