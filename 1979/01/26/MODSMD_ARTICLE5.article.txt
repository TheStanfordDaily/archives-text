Surprised Business School faculty
members had high praise for depart
ing Business School Dean Arjay Mil
ler who announced his resignation
unexpectedly yesterday afternoon at
a special meeting of the school's fa
culty.
James Freeland, assistant profes
sor of decision sciences, said he was
surprised by the move, though he
added that "we expected him to re
tire in a couple of years."
Associate Dean James Van Home
said he was "absolutely shocked'' by
Miller's decision when he learned of
it two weeks ago. "I was hoping he
would stay on until age 65 (1981)," he
said. "I'm really sorry to see him go."
Miller felt "he had accomplished
the things he set out to do" and that it
was time to leave, Van Home
explained. The dean felt he had a re
sponsibility to allow new leadership
to come to the school, he said.
Best dean
Robert Jaedicke, associate dean
for academic affairs, called Miller
"clearly the best business school
dean in the country." He said Miller
has done so many things for the
school that "when you begin to
enumerate them its easy to leave out
some."
jaedicke said Miller has "a keen
sense of quality" that enabled him to
select a top-flight faculty.
Jaedicke called Miller's fund
raising successes "spectacular."
Under Miller the Business School

endowment rose from $6.4 million to
$23.2 million. Pledges have soared
from less than $50,000 to more than
$5 million. Only last year, Miller ob
tained financial support for a $2.3
million expansion of the school's lib
rary and a new $750,000 computer.
21 chairs
The faculty has grown from 73 to 84
and the number of endowed chairs
has gone from six to 21. Applications
to the MBA program have risen al
most 2Vi times.
Miller was also responsible for es
tablishing the school's public man
agement program in 1971.-jaedicke
said Miller had an "ability to view
private sector management ... as
part of the total society." It would
have been "awfully easy" to teach as
if there were "no interface between
the public sector and the private sec
tor," he added.
jaedicke said that because the
school has developed a sound prog
ram in public management, even
students who are training for jobs in
the private sector are being exposed
to courses and professors whose
primary focus is public.
Van Home said Miller had "a sense
of priorities" combined with a "de
dication to excellence." Instead of
scattering his energies broadly, he
tried to "do a limited number of
things and do them in a first-rate
way."
Van Home emphasized that Miller
constantly worked to maintain a ba
lance at the school between research
