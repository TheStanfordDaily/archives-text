# Marshall has extended interest in Douglass

### TONY RUPERT 
In 1852 Frederick Douglass was asked by the Women's Antislavery
Society of Rochester, N.Y. to deliver a speech on the meaning of the
Fourth of July. Douglass accepted, but focused his speech on the lack
of meaning the celebration held for black people: "This Fourth of July is
yours, not mine."
Tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the Emmy award
winning actor William Marshall will give that speech in a portrayal of
Frederick Douglass.
In a Daily interview, Marshall said he has had an interest in Frederick
Douglass since his high school days in Gary, Indiana. His history
courses there never told the history of prominent black Americans, so
under the direction of his parents, he supplemented his schooling with
outside reading about important black figures, including Frederick
Douglass.
In 1974, the Washington D.C. Department of Parks asked him to
deliver the famous Fourth of July oration at the Kennedy Center.
"I thought I knew the speech," Marshall said, "but apparently I had
only seen excerpted versions, four or five pages long. They sent me a
copy; it was 69 pages long."
