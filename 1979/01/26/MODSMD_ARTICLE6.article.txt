# Marshall has extended interest in Douglass
## 
### TONY RUPERT 
In 1852 Frederick Douglass was asked by the Women's Antislavery
Society of Rochester, N.Y. to deliver a speech on the meaning of the
Fourth of July. Douglass accepted, but focused his speech on the lack
of meaning the celebration held for black people: "This Fourth of July is
yours, not mine."
Tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the Emmy award
winning actor William Marshall will give that speech in a portrayal of
Frederick Douglass.
In a Daily interview, Marshall said he has had an interest in Frederick
Douglass since his high school days in Gary, Indiana. His history
courses there never told the history of prominent black Americans, so
under the direction of his parents, he supplemented his schooling with
outside reading about important black figures, including Frederick
Douglass.
In 1974, the Washington D.C. Department of Parks asked him to
deliver the famous Fourth of July oration at the Kennedy Center.
"I thought I knew the speech," Marshall said, "but apparently I had
only seen excerpted versions, four or five pages long. They sent me a
copy; it was 69 pages long."

The version Marshal! will deliver has been edited by him to a more
presentable length. In an effort to give the audience a more com
prehensive look at Douglass, Marshall said he has also added several
passages from Douglass' other works that tell about his life.
Douglass was born a slave in 1817 on a plantation in eastern Mary
land. Shortly thereafter, he was separated from his mother and at the
age of 21, escaped to freedom in the North.
He married and settled in New Bedford, Mass. and became a
Methodist minister. After becoming associated with the abolitionist
editor William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass soon became an outspoken
proponent of abolition.
He later split with Garrison over whether the North should secede
from the Union. Garrison felt that they should secede, and that the
Constitution was formed by a "brotherhood of thieves."
Douglass disagreed. In his Fourth of July speech he explained his
belief that the Constitution did not condone slavery, and that therefore
slavery should be fought against within the parameters of the Constitu
tion.
Marshall said he was particularly pleased to portray Douglass be
cause of the neglect that has befallen black historical figures.

"A few years ago, I was teaching a course on black theater at San
Fernando State College and I used to ask my students to write about a
black," Marshall recalled. "My students would respond: 'We have so
little to write about. Why didn't you do more; why didn't our ancestors
do more?'
"I simply told them to read history and find these figures and write
.about them. I was inspired by the results," he said.
Marshall then formed the Society for the Development of Black
Heritage Drama. After he finishes his present tour, he said he would
like to put together a tour of a play that was written by one of his
students. The play is based on the life of Henry Christophe, a Haitian
ruler from 1811 to 1820 who defeated the French in their attempt to
colonize the island.
Marshall hopes that with the money from these two productions, he
can start making movies based on the lives of great black figures. He
said he has decided to produce them himself because of his displeasure
with Hollywood's treatment of blacks.
Marshall added that his goal is simply to "bring history to light again."
This evening Marshall will work toward that goal by bringing Frederick
Douglass to life again.
