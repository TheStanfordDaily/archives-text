# Jewish students seek kosher eatery
## 
### MARK NASSUTTI 
The opportunities for Jews to
keep kosher at the University
are limited. According to Rabbi
Mark Cartun of Hillel, the only
alternatives for students who
wish to keep kosher are living
off campus, in Mirrielees,
Manzanita or maintaining a
vegetarian diet and eating at
the Hillel Deli.
"Right now, only about 25
students keep kosher. If we
had a kosher eating club or
co-op, that number would
probably skyrocket."
Asked how many students
would probably be interested
in a kosher kitchen and dining
facility, Cartun replied, "If Hillel
membership is any indication,
I think over 1000 students
would be interested." Hillel

has an active membership of
over 200 students and a mailing
list of more than 1000.
Keeping kosher involves cer-.
tain procedures in the prepara
tion and serving of food. Car
tun explains. "First, the word
kosher means fit or proper. A
kosher kitchen would entail
separate utensils, pans, ovens
and stoves for dairy and meat
products.
"Kashering, the process of
making something kosher, is a
complicated process. It does
not involve any sort of bles
sing."
To kasher an oven, for
example, it must be thoroughly
cleaned and then heated with a
blowtorch. In order for meat to
be kosher, it must be butch
ered in a specific manner. And

a kosher meal cannot contain
both dairy and meat products;
each must be served at sepa
rate meals.
In the past, there have been
efforts to establish a Jewish
theme house on campus. Ac
cording to Deborah Sloss,
program coordinator for the
Hillel, "There isn't really any
thing going on right now.
There have been past efforts,
but those were vetoed due to
difficulties in setting up a
kosher kitchen." According to
Cartun, "The official reason for
refusal was lack of faculty sup
port. But the faculty were
never asked. My feeling was
that they thought it was
dangerous. They felt it would
be a precedent to establishing
a Christian theme house,
which they felt was inapprop
riate."
Norm Robinson, assistant
dean of Residential Education,
said, "The last proposal for a
theme house was submitted a
couple of years ago. Why was it
rejected? There was some feel
ing that the proposal became
too religious in nature and it
was felt that this was not
proper in an academic setting,
"The proposal," he added,
"tried to focus on cultural
historical aspects of ludaism,
but at the meetings that were
held, people kept saying things

like 'And besides, we need a
kosher kitchen' and 'We need
a place for regular services.' I
think the whole idea is some
thing that people ought to pur
sue and think about and dis
cuss, but in terms of an
academic experience."
Law and Psychology Prof.
David Rosenhan has held a
meeting to discuss the possibil
ity of a Semitic theme house.
According to Rosenhan,
"The idea would be to have a
place where people whose
civilizations arose in the Mid
dle East, Jews, Arabs and
Middle-Eastern Christians,
could live togetherand learn to
appreciate each other. There is
no formal proposal in the
works; this was just a meeting
to see what people thought.
The feeling was that it would be
lovely if we could."
Alternatives to setting up an
eating club would be kashering
the kitchen currently used by
the Hillel.
According to Cartun, "We
would like to do that, and plan
to. The problem is lack of
funds. The University gave us
access to the kitchen with the
understanding that we would
renovate it."
Presently, the Hillel Deli only
serves purchased kosher
foods. There is no preparation
involved except for heating
water for tea and coffee.

renovate it."

The opportunities for Jews to
keep kosher at the University
are limited. According to Rabbi
Mark Cartun of Hillel, the only
alternatives for students who
wish to keep kosher are living
off campus, in Mirrielees,
Manzanita or maintaining a
vegetarian diet and eating at
the Hillel Deli.
"Right now, only about 25
students keep kosher. If we
had a kosher eating club or
co-op, that number would
probably skyrocket."
Asked how many students
would probably be interested
in a kosher kitchen and dining
facility, Cartun replied, "If Hillel
membership is any indication,
I think over 1000 students
would be interested." Hillel

has an active membership of
over 200 students and a mailing
list of more than 1000.
Keeping kosher involves cer-.
tain procedures in the prepara
tion and serving of food. Car
tun explains. "First, the word
kosher means fit or proper. A
kosher kitchen would entail
separate utensils, pans, ovens
and stoves for dairy and meat
products.
"Kashering, the process of
making something kosher, is a
complicated process. It does
not involve any sort of bles
sing."
To kasher an oven, for
example, it must be thoroughly
cleaned and then heated with a
blowtorch. In order for meat to
be kosher, it must be butch
ered in a specific manner. And

a kosher meal cannot contain
both dairy and meat products;
each must be served at sepa
rate meals.
In the past, there have been
efforts to establish a Jewish
theme house on campus. Ac
cording to Deborah Sloss,
program coordinator for the
Hillel, "There isn't really any
thing going on right now.
There have been past efforts,
but those were vetoed due to
difficulties in setting up a
kosher kitchen." According to
Cartun, "The official reason for
refusal was lack of faculty sup
port. But the faculty were
never asked. My feeling was
that they thought it was
dangerous. They felt it would
be a precedent to establishing
a Christian theme house,
which they felt was inapprop
riate."
Norm Robinson, assistant
dean of Residential Education,
said, "The last proposal for a
theme house was submitted a
couple of years ago. Why was it
rejected? There was some feel
ing that the proposal became
too religious in nature and it
was felt that this was not
proper in an academic setting,
"The proposal," he added,
"tried to focus on cultural
historical aspects of ludaism,
but at the meetings that were
held, people kept saying things

like 'And besides, we need a
kosher kitchen' and 'We need
a place for regular services.' I
think the whole idea is some
thing that people ought to pur
sue and think about and dis
cuss, but in terms of an
academic experience."
Law and Psychology Prof.
David Rosenhan has held a
meeting to discuss the possibil
ity of a Semitic theme house.
According to Rosenhan,
"The idea would be to have a
place where people whose
civilizations arose in the Mid
dle East, Jews, Arabs and
Middle-Eastern Christians,
could live togetherand learn to
appreciate each other. There is
no formal proposal in the
works; this was just a meeting
to see what people thought.
The feeling was that it would be
lovely if we could."
