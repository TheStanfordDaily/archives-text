# For memorizing, studying, note-taking
## Author explains learning methods 
### NANCY KOEHN 
Do you have trouble study
ing? Does note-taking get you
down? Is memorizing getting
to be a drag? If you've encoun
tered any of these problems
with the 'Stanford experience,'
perhaps Tony Buzan can help.
Buzan, founder and director
of Learning Methods Croup of
London, England, spoke at a
reception Wednesday evening
at the Stanford Faculty Club.
Author of several books on
learning methods, Buzan is in
California to present a three
day seminar on the creative po
tential of the brain in various
areas including reading, mem

ory and studying.
A graduate of the University
of British Columbia, Buzan first
became seriously interested in
the functioning of the human
brain when he was in college.
As Buzan explained, "I didn't
like the way information was
pushed at me. I was taught no
thing on how to use my brain."
After college, Buzan traveled
extensively, held various jobs,
and pursued his interest in the
human mind â€” how it learns,
develops and changes. In 1971,
Buzan founded the Learning
Methods Croup of London, an
independent organization de
signed to study and improve a
person's ability to learn.
A growing organization, the
Learning Methods Croup is
comprised of people from all
professions. Psychologists,
writers, educators and
businesspersons teach courses
at the Learning Methods
Center in London. Using the
latest research on the brain and
its capacities, these men and
women train teachers, per
sonnel managers and others to
teach effectively.
A university professor hav
ing problems communicating
with his students can attend
various classes and seminars at
the Learning Methods Center.
Personnel managers and cor

porate executives also utilize
the Learning Methods Croup
in order to learn to deal more
effectively with their
employees. As Buzan noted,
"We teach mind-management
for big companies."
Learning Methods' staff
members also teach courses at
several universities in England,
including Oxford and the Uni
versity of Sussex where the
group devised an introductory
class in learning. The Learning
Methods Group is establishing
a similar organization in the
United States. The new group,
Learning Methods Croup of
California, is affiliated with
American Preferred, a San lose
corporation, that deals chiefly
with real estate firms.
Buzan and Vernon Rudd,
president of American Prefer
red, seem excited about pros
pects for the new organization.
According to Rudd, Learning
Methods of California will have
a three-fold thrust. The group
is attempting to involve
teachers from all levels of edu
cation, businesspersons and
the general public in their
programs and seminars.
Both Buzan and Rudd are
aware of the large responsibil
ity the new group carries as the
first organization of its kind in
the United States. As Rudd

stated, "We're the first. We
have to be very careful to set up
a successful model."
This weekend, Buzan will of
ficially open the organization's
first function, a three-day
seminar. Approximately 35
people from various profes
sions will spend more than 30
hours learning better reading
and note-taking skills, effective
memory use, comprehensive
speed reading and problem
solving skills.
The study of the brain is a
relatively new field. As a result,
much of the research in this
area has never before been at
tempted. Buzan said, "In a new
field, you're not contradicting
what's been done before. You
are building up knowledge."
Thus, the Learning Methods
Group serves as an information
source for much of the dis
coveries and research in the
field.
Originally from England,
Buzan enjoys the United States
and spends increasing
amounts of time here. He has
been involved in projects for
International Business
Machines Inc. (IBM) and
British Petroleum. Buzan is
currently researching various
aspects of creativity and is
completing two additional
books on the brain.
