# Iranian crisis hits impasse, 27 killed in mass rioting
## 
### 
Tehran, Iran (AP) — Troops firing
machine guns and anti-government
rioters armed with firebombs turned
central Tehran into a bloody, flaming
battlefront yesterday in the city's
worst violence in months. At least 27
persons were reported killed and
more than 300 wounded.
The street warfare exploded as
Iran's political crisis reached a new
and dangerous impasse.
Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini,
spiritual leader of the anti-shah
movement, rejected a proposal by
Iran's Prime Minister Shahpour
Bakhtiar for a meeting at Khomeini's
exile headquarters in France.
Resignation demanded
The Moslem holy man demanded
that the prime minister resign to
prove he is "on the side of the
angels" and not of the shah.
But official French sources said
Bakhtiar would travel to Paris Mon
day morning anyway, and this led to
speculation that the prime minister,
under increasing pressure from
Khomeini's legions of militant sup
porters here, might be going to Paris
to resign.
A French weekly, Journal de Di
manche, reported yesterday Jhere
may be a deal afoot for Bakhtiar to
step down and then be reappointed
prime minister. This would circum
vent a key Khomeini objection to
Bakhtiar's government — that it is "il
legal" because it was appointed by
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Return plans blocked
The tension and violence here had
been mounting for days as the Bakht
iar government continued to block
Khomeini's plans to return to Iran
and transform the country into an Is
lamic republic.
Thousands of pro-Khomeini pro
testers flooded Tehran streets yes
terday chanting "Death to Bakhtiar!"
and one large group tried to storm a
police headquarters, flinging
gasoline-filled bottles against the
building.
Troops rushed to the scene and
opened fire with 30-caliber machine
guns mounted on the backs of
trucks. Military officials later said the
rioters were armed with machine
guns and grenades, but reporters
who witnessed the grisly three-hour
battle said they saw none.
Screaming rioters
Associated Press correspondent
Thomas Kent reported from Esfand
Square, site of the battle, that
screaming rioters dived for cover as
bullets slammed into walls above
their heads. Some were hit by
ricochets. Ambulances raced back
and forth through the area.
Snipers opened up with pistols
from rooftops. Their identities were
unclear but at one point they were
firing at demonstrators.
AP correspondent Robert Reid re
ported seeing five demonstrators hit
by bullets in the Esfand area. Each
time one was shot, the cry of "Death
to Bakhtiar!" rose from his com
rades, cowering in doorways.
The official Pars news agency said
27 persons were killed and more than
300 were wounded. Hospital officials
said about half the wounded were
seriously hurt.
It was Tehran's bloodiest day since
Sept. 8, when 121 persons died in
political violence. Gunfire continued
sporadically after nightfall.
Bakhtiar announced Saturday he
intended to fly to Paris to meet with
Khomeini and seek his advice on
Iran's future.
At first, Khomeini's aides issued
conflicting statements about
whether the religious leader would
receive Bakhtiar. Then Khomeini told
reporters yesterday he would not,
unless he resigned as prime minister.
The 78-year-old Khomeini reiter
ated his stand that Bakhtiar's gov
ernment is "illegal" because it was
appointed by the "illegal" shah,
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was
forced into an indefinite trip abroad
by the mass movement of strikes and
demonstrations orchestrated by
Khomeini.

gasoline-filled bottles against the
building.
Troops rushed to the scene and
opened fire with 30-caliber machine
guns mounted on the backs of
trucks. Military officials later said the
rioters were armed with machine
guns and grenades, but reporters
who witnessed the grisly three-hour
battle said they saw none.
Screaming rioters
Associated Press correspondent
Thomas Kent reported from Esfand
Square, site of the battle, that
screaming rioters dived for cover as
bullets slammed into walls above
their heads. Some were hit by
ricochets. Ambulances raced back
and forth through the area.
Snipers opened up with pistols
from rooftops. Their identities were
unclear but at one point they were
firing at demonstrators.
AP correspondent Robert Reid re
ported seeing five demonstrators hit
by bullets in the Esfand area. Each
time one was shot, the cry of "Death
to Bakhtiar!" rose from his com
rades, cowering in doorways.
The official Pars news agency said
27 persons were killed and more than
300 were wounded. Hospital officials
said about half the wounded were
seriously hurt.
It was Tehran's bloodiest day since
Sept. 8, when 121 persons died in
political violence. Gunfire continued
sporadically after nightfall.
Bakhtiar announced Saturday he
intended to fly to Paris to meet with
Khomeini and seek his advice on
Iran's future.
At first, Khomeini's aides issued
conflicting statements about
whether the religious leader would
receive Bakhtiar. Then Khomeini told
reporters yesterday he would not,
unless he resigned as prime minister.
The 78-year-old Khomeini reiter
ated his stand that Bakhtiar's gov
ernment is "illegal" because it was
appointed by the "illegal" shah,
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was
forced into an indefinite trip abroad
by the mass movement of strikes and
demonstrations orchestrated by
Khomeini.
