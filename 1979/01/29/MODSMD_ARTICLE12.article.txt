# Smoking linked to infant deaths

Hilton Head Island, S.C.
(AP) — New evidence indi
cates the negative effects of
smoking continue even if
women quit before preg
nancy, according to a major
new study.
Data released this month
for the U.S. Collaborative
Perinatal Project, which
examined more than 50,000
pregnancies at 12 hospital
centers, confirmed previ
ous studies showing smok
ing during pregnancy in
creases disorders that kill
the unborn and the new
born.
Past smoking
But Dr. Richard N.ieye of
Pennsylvania State Univer
sity told the American Heart
Association's annual sci
ence writers' forum he was
particularly disturbed by the
first data to indicate past
smoking had an effect on
later pregnancy.
He said placenta praevia
and the presence of abnor
mally large areas ol dead tis
sue on the placenta were

more common for smoking
mothers and were related to
past smoking, measured as
cigarettes per year over a
period of time.
Placenta praevia is a con
dition in which the placenta
js attached abnormally low
in the womb, leading to
dangerous complications
during labor and birth.
Naeye said it is uncertain
how long the effects of
smoking continue after a
woman quits, but he ad
vised women contemplat
ing pregnancy to give up
smoking as early as possible
before conception.
Crib death
Previous studies linked
sudden infant death syn
drome — also called crib
death — to smoking during
pregnancy. But Naeye said
this study is the first to show
smoking as an independent
risk factor of the condition,
a problem of unknown ori
gin which kills one ot every
400 children born in the Un
ited States.
