# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editor's perspective Looking to the future 
### 
Going into Volume 175, I have one wish
— and it probably isn't the wish you might
imagine.
I don't wish everything runs smoothly
every night. It will not; I know that. There is
little reason to wish for it. Besides, learning
to deal with the problems inherent in pro
duction of a newspaper is one of the most
important aspects of this job.
I don't wish the Daily could break top
national stories every morning. That is
equally unrealistic. We do not have the staf
fing or experience to handle a huge influx
of big stories. Indeed it is hard enough to
handle the little things at home.
What I wish is that come June, the cam
pus will recognize the Daily as a news
gathering organization with integrity. I
want people to think of the Daily as credi
ble and complete, objective and accurate.
It's not that I think people feel otherwise
now — at least not all the time. But we still
have a long way to go.
But I assure you, achieving this end is my
primary goal for the volume. We are exa
mining every possible way to ensure accu
racy and completeness in our copy. /
Perhaps the biggest thing we could do to
ensure a top-quality product has already
been done. New Managing Editor Sara
Lessley and I, with the help of top editors
from last volume, looked long and hard at
the people we placed in the staff box for the
coming volume.
I believe we have produced the best ba
lance possible between accurate writing
and efficient production. I have every con
fidence in each new editor'sability to do his
or her job.
Our editorial positions will be the result
of a majority opinion within the editorial

board. The board is comprised of Lessley
and me plus the news editors, opinions
editors and "at-large" staffers Craig De
nnis, Ron Lillejord and Rob Lempert.
It is our belief that the Daily has the re
sponsibility to keep the public informed on
all issues on campus. Vet, despite qualified
and enthusiastic personnel, we must
acknowledge the limitations inherent in
the operation of a student newspaper.
We have a perennial staffing problem.
And just when the problem seems to be
clearing up, midterm time comes, and no
one is available. And even if we had the
world at our disposal, staffers must be
trained before important stories can be as
signed or layout accomplished.
So we are faced with an amazing variety
of stories to publish but a limited number
of qualified people to write, edit, headline,
proofread and layout these stories.
You can help us accomplish this end. Just
come in and join us.
And if you can't find the time to help out,
keep the limitations in mind the next time
you cuss our "rag." We think we do a fairly
good job, and we are trying to do better all
the time.
No, the problems are not meant as an
excuse. There is no excuse for inaccuracy. I
just think that people also should consider
that we are an educational institution.
Inourefforttodoabetterjob, I hope you
will keep us advised of your concerns,
either through letters or phone calls. Your
input does make a difference.
Finally, I hope you enjoy reading Volume
175, a volume of integrity.
