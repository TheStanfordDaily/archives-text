## Support the Coors boycott 
### 
(First of two parts)
Be a man. Sell out! . . .
everyone does.

This column started out to
support the Coors boycott,
but it is now much more than
that. As those participating in
the boycott prepared for the
classic confrontation between
blue denim and blue pin
stripes in front of the senate
last week, similarities between
the situation here and in Gol
den, Colorado emerged.
The Golden, Colorado area
is a poor one, with a high un
employment rate which is even
higher among the many
minorities in the area. Set in
this scene is the single largest
brewery in America, the
Adolph Coors brewery. A
Coors job offers one of the few
possibilities available to escape
the surrounding poverty.
But the escape comes at a
tremendous social cost. A
prospective employee at Coors
must submit to a polygraph
test, with questions such as
"Did you have relations with
your husband/wife last night?"
The company claims it no
longer asks questions about
sex, but freely admits it still
asks "Are you concealing any
information about subversive,
revolutionary or communistic
activities?"
Questions such as these are
a definite invasion of privacy
and are of questionable rele
vance to making beer. But
rather than letting their
families go hungry, the work
ers submit.
The worker is then notified
of the grounds for which he or
she may be fired. Among
grounds for immediate dis
charge are "refusal to permit
inspection by plant guards of
objects brought into or taken
out of the employer's prop
erty."
Another reason for dis
charge is making disparaging
remarks about the employer.
Search and seizure? Free
speech? Violation of constitu
tional rights? As Coors Chair
man Bill Coors said, you have
the constitutional right not to
work at Coors. But still the
workers come. Fear of poverty
makes people do strange
things.
What is at the base of this? It
is the Coors' family conviction
that the organization of work
ers into unions has no place at
present. Bill Coors is fond of
saying that unions are only
necessary for unenlightened
workers. I suppose that in
cludes workers who feel that
the only way to resist unde
mocratic tactics is to resist col
lectively, instead of individu
ally.

Unions have all sorts of
negative characteristics from a
company standpoint. They can
obtain higher wages and be
nefits for employees and pro
tect them from corporate bully
ing tactics.
Although the company
states that they are not "anti
union," President |oe Coors
said, "I honestly see very little
appropriate role for unions in
this day and age." Brother Bill
states, "For 42 years we've re
luctantly granted a union shop
here but philosophically we've
always been opposed to it."
Both men are contributors to
The Committee for the Survival
of a Free Congress, the John
Birch Society and other organi
zations which are committed
to eliminating unions that pro
tect workers from abuse.
A favorite claim of the com
pany is that brewery workers
voted tooust their union. What
the company doesn't have its
P.R. men reveal is that the
company, not the workers, re
quested the decertification
election after a year-long strike
by workers protesting dignity
issues that you and I take for
granted.
The voters were workers
lured from the large pool of
unemployed in the area and
given jobs to break the strike.
In spite of a management
circulated document stating
that these strikebreakers
would lose their jobs if the
union were retained almost 40
percent voted to do just that. If
unions are so evil, and the
company so benevolent,
would this happen?
Many of the strikers lost their
cars, homes and families.
Many had to find employment
elsewhere. Others, desper
ately fearing the poverty which
they had escaped, reluctantly
crossed the picket lines.
The Coors boycott was or
ganized to support these
workers. It is their last hope.
Boycotts are not easy to or
ganize, but it is the only lan
guage the company under
stands.
Coors claims that the
boycott hurts only the inde
pendent distributors of Coors,
not the Coors' brothers. This is
ridiculous. Most, if not all, of
Coors' stock is family-owned.
If beer sales drop, so does the
money in the Coors brothers'
pockets.
The company claims that the
boycott has been ineffective.
They admit, however, to a 10
percent drop in sales and have
sent teams of P.R. people into
the field to ply university stu
dents with free beer and novel
ties in exchange for listening to
"the truth." Such a team, ac
companied by their corporate
lawyer from San Francisco, re

cently confronted us in front of
the senate, where the issue
currently lies.

your husband/wife last night?"
The company claims it no
longer asks questions about
sex, but freely admits it still
asks "Are you concealing any
information about subversive,
revolutionary or communistic
activities?"
Questions such as these are
a definite invasion of privacy
and are of questionable rele
vance to making beer. But
rather than letting their
families go hungry, the work
ers submit.
The worker is then notified
of the grounds for which he or
she may be fired. Among
grounds for immediate dis
charge are "refusal to permit
inspection by plant guards of
objects brought into or taken
out of the employer's prop
erty."
Another reason for dis
charge is making disparaging
remarks about the employer.
Search and seizure? Free
speech? Violation of constitu
tional rights? As Coors Chair
man Bill Coors said, you have
the constitutional right not to
work at Coors. But still the
workers come. Fear of poverty
makes people do strange
things.
What is at the base of this? It
is the Coors' family conviction
that the organization of work
ers into unions has no place at
present. Bill Coors is fond of
saying that unions are only
necessary for unenlightened
workers. I suppose that in
cludes workers who feel that
the only way to resist unde
mocratic tactics is to resist col
lectively, instead of individu
ally.

Unions have all sorts of
negative characteristics from a
company standpoint. They can
obtain higher wages and be
nefits for employees and pro
tect them from corporate bully
ing tactics.
Although the company
states that they are not "anti
union," President |oe Coors
said, "I honestly see very little
appropriate role for unions in
this day and age." Brother Bill
states, "For 42 years we've re
luctantly granted a union shop
here but philosophically we've
always been opposed to it."
Both men are contributors to
The Committee for the Survival
of a Free Congress, the John
Birch Society and other organi
zations which are committed
to eliminating unions that pro
tect workers from abuse.
A favorite claim of the com
pany is that brewery workers
voted tooust their union. What
the company doesn't have its
P.R. men reveal is that the
company, not the workers, re
quested the decertification
election after a year-long strike
by workers protesting dignity
issues that you and I take for
granted.
The voters were workers
lured from the large pool of
unemployed in the area and
given jobs to break the strike.
In spite of a management
circulated document stating
that these strikebreakers
would lose their jobs if the
union were retained almost 40
percent voted to do just that. If
unions are so evil, and the
company so benevolent,
would this happen?
Many of the strikers lost their
cars, homes and families.
Many had to find employment
elsewhere. Others, desper
ately fearing the poverty which
they had escaped, reluctantly
crossed the picket lines.
The Coors boycott was or
ganized to support these
workers. It is their last hope.
Boycotts are not easy to or
ganize, but it is the only lan
guage the company under
stands.
Coors claims that the
boycott hurts only the inde
pendent distributors of Coors,
not the Coors' brothers. This is
ridiculous. Most, if not all, of
Coors' stock is family-owned.
If beer sales drop, so does the
money in the Coors brothers'
pockets.
The company claims that the
boycott has been ineffective.
They admit, however, to a 10
percent drop in sales and have
sent teams of P.R. people into
the field to ply university stu
dents with free beer and novel
ties in exchange for listening to
"the truth." Such a team, ac
companied by their corporate
lawyer from San Francisco, re

cently confronted us in front of
the senate, where the issue
currently lies.

This column started out to
support the Coors boycott,
but it is now much more than
that. As those participating in
the boycott prepared for the
classic confrontation between
blue denim and blue pin
stripes in front of the senate
last week, similarities between
the situation here and in Gol
den, Colorado emerged.
The Golden, Colorado area
is a poor one, with a high un
employment rate which is even
higher among the many
minorities in the area. Set in
this scene is the single largest
brewery in America, the
Adolph Coors brewery. A
Coors job offers one of the few
possibilities available to escape
the surrounding poverty.
But the escape comes at a
tremendous social cost. A
prospective employee at Coors
must submit to a polygraph
test, with questions such as
"Did you have relations with
your husband/wife last night?"
