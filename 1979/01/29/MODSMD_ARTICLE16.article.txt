## U.S. foreign policy oppressive 
### 
A conservative might be surprised to
find Ronald Reagan in bed with Noam
Chomsky, but he shouldn't be. Unfortu
nately, conservatives in Chomsky's recent
audience here probably left early, before
Chomsky had a chance to show how con
servative premises, consistently applied,
lead to radical conclusions.
According to Chomsky, U.S. foreign
policy is not fundamentally benevolent.
The fact that it frequently results in other
peoples' oppression should be accepted
as an integral and unsurprising consequ
ence of well-understood causes, rather
than as an inexplicable "mistake."
Foremost among the causes, he contends,
is the pursuit of special interests, espe
cially those of business and the military.
Anyone minimally acquainted with
domestic politics recognizes such charges
against the federal government as the daily
meat and potatoes of conservative politi
cians across the land. Since the New Deal,
conservatives cry, we have learned that
Washington is neither all-good
nor all-powerful. It requires constant pub
lic surveillance or it can turn against even
its own constituents.
Can it be that Washington's conduct in
foreign affairs is any more reliable â€” par
ticularly from the viewpoint of other coun
tries?
Chomsky accuses the American intellec
tual elite which dominates the media of a

susceptibility to group mentality ap
proaching faddishness, of pandering to
popular ignorance and prejudice, and of a
general inability to take an ethically in
formed, critically independent opinion.
He blames this on American society's
need to make its members feel comforta
ble with their society and with themselves,
especially in the wake of the bitter self
knowledge gained during the '60s, in
inner-city ghettoes and Indochina.
Conservative thinkers and moralists
have held a similarly low opinion of most
of the dominant intelligentsia fordecades,
for essentially the same reasons.
After all, this liberal elite produced the
touted "we" generation. Do we have any
reason to trust this same elite to instruct us
in the values and needs of other societies?
Clearly, what is sauce for the domestic
goose is also sauce for the foreign gander.
If anything distinguishes foreign policy
from domestic policy, it is that the gov
ernment officials and intellectuals in
volved have even greater license to im
pose themselves arrogantly, act pater
nalistically, and be disastrously wrong.
Fortunately for them, those they affect
overseas cannot easily tell their side of the
story in Washington or in the American
owned, English-speaking media.
Conservatism teaches that the right to
decide on the welfare of others is
legitimized only by accountability and
consent. Abroad, as at home, government

must continually be subjected to search
ing examination and feedback from the
people whose good it purportedly prom
otes.
If the legitimacy of authority is taken for
granted, abuse inevitably follows. One of
the most valuable insights of U.S. political
theory is the warning to expect power to
corrupt wherever checks and balances on
it are missing.
Chomsky's critique of foreign policy
would merely extend this conservative
realism beyond U.S. borders, turning its
skeptical light upon the alleged benevo
lence of the American political elite ab
road. Why should the elite's objective be
to other nations' good when the elite is in
no way accountable to those nations?
Assuring the American elite's accounta
bility to the American people is difficult
enough, given the personal, bureaucratic
and economic interests competing for
their attention.
Next time Chomsky visits, conservatives
should be sure to stay to listen. Would-be
hard-headed skeptics in domestic politics
can ill afford to believe the self-serving
foreign-policy myths which their own
policymakers find convenient to put over
on foreigners.
If together we cannot agree on what our
foreign policy should be, at least we
should know what it really is.
