Cartoon censored
I am outraged by the Daily's
refusal to publish two Dupie
cartoons. How dare the Daily
decree that in its imperial
"judgment" the cartoons
"would offend some members
of the Stanford community,"
and therefore are not fit (for
printing.
This is the essence of cen
sorship. It stems from the Daily
staff's nauseating preoccupa
tion with trying to act like
trendy liberals and curry favor
with similarly inclined groups.
The Daily's craven capitulation
to the shrill demands of vocal
minorities does a lasting dis
service to itself, the principle
of journalistic integrity and the
community.
If you don't like what Gil
Morales is saying, then the
proper place for rebuttal is the
editoiial column! The attemp
ted clarification by editors only
makes matters worse.
It raises the specter of
journalism-by-committee: first
the raw news will be gathered,
then all minority interest
groups (who often are self
appointed spokesmen) will fil
ter it for anything objectiona
ble, and finally the resultant
bland pabulum will be printed
for our consumption.
Their assertions to the con
trary are not convicing in light
of their evident predisposition
to censorship. This high
handed and paternalistic at
titude towards the Daily's
readers deserves the strongest
rebuke.
I am sick and tired of the in
cessant and often patently ab
surd charges of "this is racist"
or "that is sexist." Let me give
you a blunt example of the
rampant hypocrisy of those
who make such charges.
Stanford has organizations
such as the Chicano Pre-Law
Students, Feminist Union,
Black Literary Guild, Hillel and
the Asian American Students
Association. All well and good.
Arbitrarily picking an example,
let's suppose the Black Student
Union were to say to you or
me, 'Hey, we're black Ameri-
and we've got rights!"
Surely none of us would dis
agree or feel uncomfortable
with that statement. But if I
were to stand in front of Tre
sidder and say, "Hey, I'm a
white American and I've got

rights!" we'd all assume I'm a
racist monster.
The point is not that these
organizations are inherently
evil; it is simply that there is a
pervasive double standard. I
must bean anachronism in that
I think we are all in this collec
tive enterprise we call life to
gether, and I am disturbed by
the insular factionalism that is
ripping this country apart, iron
ically all too often under the
guise of liberalism.
By the way, if the editors are
as desperately at a loss for
standards of publication as
they suggest, I recommend
they read Cox v. Louisiana,
Certz v. Robert Welch and New
York Times v. Sullivan.

Editor's note: I hope the day
will never come when people
outside the Daily have any con
trol on content. It certainly will
not happen within the next 78
issues of the Daily which will
constitute Volume 175.
You misconstrue the role of
the advisory board. It will not
be "journalism-by
committee." Far from it. The
committee will not serve to re
strict content.
Rather, the board will serve
to advise the Daily on broad
policy issues, not to individu
ally consider each case as it
arises, which would be both
unwieldly and unrealistic.
Moreover, it is hoped the
board will keep us aware of im
portant stories we are missing
which involve women or
minorities.
The specific decision to pull
the Morales cartoons last week
was made after two weeks of
dealing with a group of
feminists angry over other al
legedly sexist material previ
ously published.
In our final meeting with the
feminists we asked their opin
ion of the cartoons, and, as you
might expect, they found them
offensive.
After much deliberation,
then-Editor Craig Dennis de
cided to pull the cartoons after
Managing Editor Sara Lessley,
News Editors Lee Tien and
Emily Sachar, Copy Editor Jim
Tranquada and I urged him to
do so.
The major reason I urged pul
ling the cartoons was that I
wanted to know just how the

community felt on the issue of
censoring potentially offensive
material. My inclination has
been, and I believe always will
be, to oppose attempts at prior
restraint.
But personally, I found the
publication of two cartoons to
be relatively inconsequential
when it comes to the overall
integrity of the paper; there
fore, I considered pulling the
cartoons to be an excellent op
portunity to experiment with
the public. Dennis felt the
same way.
So far, the sentiment has
been unanimously opposed to
the decision. Though we have
heard nothing from the
feminists who urged the move,
the overwhelming response to
the action convinces me it was
wrong.
The community response
tells me that students here
would rather be given the
chance to make up their own
minds on an issue, given all the
evidence on all sides, than
have their minds made up for
them based on the one-sided
release of information.
This has always been my feel
ing on the issue of who has the
right to space in the news
paper. I feel that the only way
to ensure that everyone has a
fair opportunity to express vie
wpoints is to allow everyone
access to the opinions page.
I stated this policy to the
feminists last week. It will be
the governing policy of Volume
175.

The neo
cola-nization of
China?
The recent developments in
the Peoples Republic of China
are a combination of the pre
dictable, surprising and bewil
dering. The situation has to be
complex if it makes many lef
tists upset, captains of industry
smile and Barry Coldwater an
gry-
One of the most amazing
symbolic actions was the rather
peculiar attempt of the
Chinese leadership to disco to
Saturday Night Fever. It is
perplexing to consider that the
country that brought us
barefoot doctors and
acupuncture is now going to

start drinking Coca-Cola;
equally strange is the thought
of a leader of the country that
pioneered the concept of self
reliance driving in an agribusi
ness wheat harvester in the
Midwest.
Some of the scenarios are
enough to boggle the mind:
communes watching Kojak,
drinking Coke and eating pre
tzels; John Travolta going to
China as an exchange student;
Robert Redford, Dustin
Hoffman and Richard Burton
doing a re-enactment of the
Great March; the Readers' Di
gest putting out an abbreviated
version of Mao's little red
book; and Werner Erhard start
ing acupuncture weekends.
These visions are not to deny
the inevitable and strategic im
peratives behind the decision
to open diplomatic relations
between the United States and
China.
Some of these develop
ments are so recent, that in the
absence of sufficient clear in
formation and analysis, it is dif

ficult to make a satisfactory
judgment of what might hap
pen in China, through what
ever ideological lense we
might be looking.
Suffice to say that I nervously
await the day when Howard K.
Smith tells us that "it might
take 30 years to make a good
socialist, but only a few weeks
to make a good capitalist."

Arbitrarily picking an example,
let's suppose the Black Student
Union were to say to you or

Surely none of us would dis
agree or feel uncomfortable

The point is not that these

I think we are all in this collec

the insular factionalism that is
ripping this country apart, iron
ically all too often under the

they read Cox v. Louisiana,
Certz v. Robert Welch and New

Editor's note: I hope the day
will never come when people
outside the Daily have any con
trol on content. It certainly will
not happen within the next 78
issues of the Daily which will
constitute Volume 175.
You misconstrue the role of
the advisory board. It will not
be "journalism-by
committee." Far from it. The
committee will not serve to re
strict content.
Rather, the board will serve
to advise the Daily on broad
policy issues, not to individu
ally consider each case as it
arises, which would be both
unwieldly and unrealistic.
Moreover, it is hoped the
board will keep us aware of im
portant stories we are missing
which involve women or
minorities.
The specific decision to pull
the Morales cartoons last week
was made after two weeks of
dealing with a group of
feminists angry over other al
legedly sexist material previ
ously published.
In our final meeting with the
feminists we asked their opin
ion of the cartoons, and, as you
might expect, they found them
offensive.
After much deliberation,
then-Editor Craig Dennis de
cided to pull the cartoons after
Managing Editor Sara Lessley,
News Editors Lee Tien and
Emily Sachar, Copy Editor Jim
Tranquada and I urged him to
do so.
The major reason I urged pul
ling the cartoons was that I
wanted to know just how the

community felt on the issue of
censoring potentially offensive
material. My inclination has
been, and I believe always will
be, to oppose attempts at prior
restraint.
But personally, I found the
publication of two cartoons to
be relatively inconsequential
when it comes to the overall
integrity of the paper; there
fore, I considered pulling the
cartoons to be an excellent op
portunity to experiment with
the public. Dennis felt the
same way.
So far, the sentiment has
been unanimously opposed to
the decision. Though we have
heard nothing from the
feminists who urged the move,
the overwhelming response to
the action convinces me it was
wrong.
The community response
tells me that students here
would rather be given the
chance to make up their own
minds on an issue, given all the
evidence on all sides, than
have their minds made up for
them based on the one-sided
release of information.
This has always been my feel
ing on the issue of who has the
right to space in the news
paper. I feel that the only way
to ensure that everyone has a
fair opportunity to express vie
wpoints is to allow everyone
access to the opinions page.
I stated this policy to the
feminists last week. It will be
the governing policy of Volume
175.

The neo
cola-nization of
China?
The recent developments in
the Peoples Republic of China
are a combination of the pre
dictable, surprising and bewil
dering. The situation has to be
complex if it makes many lef
tists upset, captains of industry
smile and Barry Coldwater an
gry-
One of the most amazing
symbolic actions was the rather
peculiar attempt of the
Chinese leadership to disco to
Saturday Night Fever. It is
perplexing to consider that the
country that brought us
barefoot doctors and
acupuncture is now going to

start drinking Coca-Cola;
equally strange is the thought
of a leader of the country that
pioneered the concept of self
reliance driving in an agribusi
ness wheat harvester in the
Midwest.
Some of the scenarios are
enough to boggle the mind:
communes watching Kojak,
drinking Coke and eating pre
tzels; John Travolta going to
China as an exchange student;
Robert Redford, Dustin
Hoffman and Richard Burton
doing a re-enactment of the
Great March; the Readers' Di
gest putting out an abbreviated
version of Mao's little red
book; and Werner Erhard start
ing acupuncture weekends.
These visions are not to deny
the inevitable and strategic im
peratives behind the decision
to open diplomatic relations
between the United States and
China.
Some of these develop
ments are so recent, that in the
absence of sufficient clear in
formation and analysis, it is dif

ficult to make a satisfactory
judgment of what might hap
pen in China, through what
ever ideological lense we
might be looking.
Suffice to say that I nervously
await the day when Howard K.
Smith tells us that "it might
take 30 years to make a good
socialist, but only a few weeks
to make a good capitalist."

I am outraged by the Daily's
refusal to publish two Dupie
cartoons. How dare the Daily
decree that in its imperial
"judgment" the cartoons
"would offend some members
of the Stanford community,"
and therefore are not fit (for
printing.
This is the essence of cen
sorship. It stems from the Daily
staff's nauseating preoccupa
tion with trying to act like
trendy liberals and curry favor
with similarly inclined groups.
The Daily's craven capitulation
to the shrill demands of vocal
minorities does a lasting dis
service to itself, the principle
of journalistic integrity and the
community.
If you don't like what Gil
Morales is saying, then the
proper place for rebuttal is the
editoiial column! The attemp
ted clarification by editors only
makes matters worse.
It raises the specter of
journalism-by-committee: first
the raw news will be gathered,
then all minority interest
groups (who often are self
appointed spokesmen) will fil
ter it for anything objectiona
ble, and finally the resultant
bland pabulum will be printed
for our consumption.
Their assertions to the con
trary are not convicing in light
of their evident predisposition
to censorship. This high
handed and paternalistic at
titude towards the Daily's
readers deserves the strongest
rebuke.
I am sick and tired of the in
cessant and often patently ab
surd charges of "this is racist"
or "that is sexist." Let me give
you a blunt example of the
rampant hypocrisy of those
who make such charges.

policy issues, not to individu
ally consider each case as it
arises, which would be both
unwieldly and unrealistic.
Moreover, it is hoped the
board will keep us aware of im
portant stories we are missing
which involve women or
minorities.
The specific decision to pull
the Morales cartoons last week
was made after two weeks of
dealing with a group of
feminists angry over other al
legedly sexist material previ
ously published.
In our final meeting with the
feminists we asked their opin
ion of the cartoons, and, as you
might expect, they found them
offensive.
After much deliberation,
then-Editor Craig Dennis de
cided to pull the cartoons after
Managing Editor Sara Lessley,
News Editors Lee Tien and
Emily Sachar, Copy Editor Jim
Tranquada and I urged him to
do so.
The major reason I urged pul
ling the cartoons was that I
wanted to know just how the

community felt on the issue of
censoring potentially offensive
material. My inclination has
been, and I believe always will
be, to oppose attempts at prior
restraint.
But personally, I found the
publication of two cartoons to
be relatively inconsequential
when it comes to the overall
integrity of the paper; there
fore, I considered pulling the
cartoons to be an excellent op
portunity to experiment with
the public. Dennis felt the
same way.
So far, the sentiment has
been unanimously opposed to
the decision. Though we have
heard nothing from the
feminists who urged the move,
the overwhelming response to
the action convinces me it was
wrong.
The community response
tells me that students here
would rather be given the
chance to make up their own
minds on an issue, given all the
evidence on all sides, than
have their minds made up for
them based on the one-sided
release of information.
This has always been my feel
ing on the issue of who has the
right to space in the news
paper. I feel that the only way
to ensure that everyone has a
fair opportunity to express vie
wpoints is to allow everyone
access to the opinions page.
I stated this policy to the
feminists last week. It will be
the governing policy of Volume
175.

The neo
cola-nization of
China?
The recent developments in
the Peoples Republic of China
are a combination of the pre
dictable, surprising and bewil
dering. The situation has to be
complex if it makes many lef
tists upset, captains of industry
smile and Barry Coldwater an
gry-
One of the most amazing
symbolic actions was the rather
peculiar attempt of the
Chinese leadership to disco to
Saturday Night Fever. It is
perplexing to consider that the
country that brought us
barefoot doctors and
acupuncture is now going to

start drinking Coca-Cola;
equally strange is the thought
of a leader of the country that
pioneered the concept of self
reliance driving in an agribusi
ness wheat harvester in the
Midwest.
Some of the scenarios are
enough to boggle the mind:
communes watching Kojak,
drinking Coke and eating pre
tzels; John Travolta going to
China as an exchange student;
Robert Redford, Dustin
Hoffman and Richard Burton
doing a re-enactment of the
Great March; the Readers' Di
gest putting out an abbreviated
version of Mao's little red
book; and Werner Erhard start
ing acupuncture weekends.
These visions are not to deny
the inevitable and strategic im
peratives behind the decision
to open diplomatic relations
between the United States and
China.
Some of these develop
ments are so recent, that in the
absence of sufficient clear in
formation and analysis, it is dif

ficult to make a satisfactory
judgment of what might hap
pen in China, through what
ever ideological lense we
might be looking.
Suffice to say that I nervously
await the day when Howard K.
Smith tells us that "it might
take 30 years to make a good
socialist, but only a few weeks
to make a good capitalist."
