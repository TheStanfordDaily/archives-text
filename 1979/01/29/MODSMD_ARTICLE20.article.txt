# State of Union doesn't vary

Washington (AP) — Presiden
tial reports on the state of the
union are like super bowls —
there's always a big buildup
and it's usually a dull show.
Pittsburgh and Dallas broke
the Super Bowl pattern when
the Steelers won the profes
sional football championship
in a wide-open, high-scoring
game.
But President Jimmy Carter's
State of the Union address last
week ran to form. No fancy
plays, more defense than of
fense.
As always, the government
establishment crowded be
neath the political superdome
of the Capitol for the Big Event.
As usual, it wasn't very event
ful.
"They never vary," said
Speaker of the House Thomas
O'Neill Jr., who has been
around for 25 State of the
Unicfn addresses now.
"They're all the same. . . .
"I've heard it so many times,
I know it all by heart."
The Constitution instructs

the president to give Congress
"information of the state of the
union" from time to time. It
doesn't say when, and it
doesn't tell him to do so in per
son.
Almost invariably, presi
dents report that the state of
the union is just fine, and cer
tainly is a lot better than it
would be if they weren't in the
White House.
A glance at the record vali
dates O'Neill's appraisal.
Gerald Ford holds the record
for reporting that the state of
the union is not good. He did it
once. And he'd only been in
office five months at the time,
succeeding the resigned
Richard Nixon. In successive
)anuarys, he found things get
ting better and better.
State of the Union messages
have certain interchangeable
paragraphs.
"We are engaged in a long
and hard fight against infla
tion. ... If this Congress
cooperates in our efforts to
hold down the cost of govern

ment, we shall win our fight to
hold down the cost of livingfor
the American people."
That wasn't Carter talking. It
was Nixon, in 1974.
"I now ask this 96th Con
gress to continue our partner
ship in holding the line on ex
cess federal spending," Carter
said this year. "It will not be
easy. We must be strong and
persistent. This budget is a
clear message that, with the
help of you and the American
people, I am determined to
bring inflation under control."
Or check foreign policy.
"Our relationship with the
People's Republic of China is
proving its importance and its
durability. We are finding
more and more common
ground."
That's Ford, 1977.
"We are entering a hopeful
era in our relations with one
fourth of the world's people
who live in China," said Carter,
who established diplomatic re
lations with Peking.
