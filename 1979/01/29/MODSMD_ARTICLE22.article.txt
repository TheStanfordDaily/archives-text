# Expansion of peer advising approved
## 
### Brad Crystal 
"I have this sinking feeling
that if my adviser moved I 'd get
no forwarding address."
Excerpted from a quotation
in Approaching Stanford, the
above statement reflects the
views of many freshmen.
To complement the faculty/
staff freshman advising prog
ram with student advisers, the
University recently approved
expansion of a pilot Advising
Associate program in Trancos,
an all-freshman dorm in the
Wilbur complex.
The reaction'to the upper
class peer-advising program
has been "very positive," ac
cording to Elizabeth Meyer, di
rector of the Academic Infor
mation Center (AIC). As a re
sult, the program will be ex
tended to include at least three
other undetermined freshman
dorms next year.
The Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies is fund
ing the expansion, which will
include a salaried student
coordinator program. This ex
pansion will raise the cost of
the program from about $1000
to approximately $3500, said
Dan Lessler, an advising as
sociate.
The advising associates,
who are all upperclass stu
dents, work in conjunction
with the faculty/staff advisers in
groups of from five to 15
freshmen. The freshmen are
assigned according to primary
academic interest.
Alison Ross, another advis
ing associate, says the prog
ram's purpose is to provide
academic information and ad
vice rather than psychological
or personal counseling. The
advising associates are re
quired to dine with their ad
visees in Trancos once a week.
Interaction also occurs infor
mally through phone calls and
meetings in the up
perclassmen's residences.

Noting the scarcity of up
perclassmen in an all-freshman
dorm, Ross said she believes
the program gives "students
the, opportunity to use upper
class knowledge." Because
freshmen interact daily with
upperclassmen in the four
class dorms, advising as
sociates are not as essential in
the four-class dorms, she said.
Training of future advisers
will be accomplished through a
SWOPSI or SCIRE course to be
offered to 40 upperclassmen
this spring. The course will
teach counseling skills, give
general information and
background concerning Uni
versity resources, and help
clarify the education goals of
students in the class.
Ross's enthusiasm for the

program is mirrored by advis
ers and freshmen alike.
According to Lessler, who
works with freshmen in
terested in human biology,
"we are incredibly impressed
with how well it has worked."
An official evaluation of the
program will be released in the
near future.
Lessler noted that while ad
vising associates and faculty/
staff advisers sometimes offer
conflicting advice, their rela
tionship is "not antagonistic."
The role and function of the
general adviser is not usurped
but complemented by the pre
senceof peeradvisers, he said.
Another advising associate,
senior Steve Grossman says he
believes the expansion of the
program should be continued.
"I definitely think it should be

available to all freshmen," he
said.
Trancos freshman Val Vaden
said he would concur. Calling
the program "invaluable," he
pointed out "it's given me an
automatic upperclass friend as
well as a sounding board for
ideas." Although the house as
sociates are "very helpful" he
has found that in an all
freshman dorm "they can only
be spread so thin."
Trancos freshmen, while not
questioning the importance of
faculty/staff advising, say they
feel more comfortable interact
ing with fellow students.
'There's less of a generation
gap," said Val. "They're help
ful not only in deciding what
classes to take but also what
parties to go to."
"I have this sinking feeling
that if my adviser moved I 'd get
no forwarding address."

or personal counseling. The
advising associates are re
quired to dine with their ad
visees in Trancos once a week.
Interaction also occurs infor
mally through phone calls and
meetings in the up
perclassmen's residences.

Noting the scarcity of up
perclassmen in an all-freshman
dorm, Ross said she believes
the program gives "students
the, opportunity to use upper
class knowledge." Because
freshmen interact daily with
upperclassmen in the four
class dorms, advising as
sociates are not as essential in
the four-class dorms, she said.
Training of future advisers
will be accomplished through a
SWOPSI or SCIRE course to be
offered to 40 upperclassmen
this spring. The course will
teach counseling skills, give
general information and
background concerning Uni
versity resources, and help
clarify the education goals of
students in the class.
Ross's enthusiasm for the

program is mirrored by advis
ers and freshmen alike.
According to Lessler, who
works with freshmen in
terested in human biology,
"we are incredibly impressed
with how well it has worked."
An official evaluation of the
program will be released in the
near future.
Lessler noted that while ad
vising associates and faculty/
staff advisers sometimes offer
conflicting advice, their rela
tionship is "not antagonistic."
The role and function of the
general adviser is not usurped
but complemented by the pre
senceof peeradvisers, he said.
Another advising associate,
senior Steve Grossman says he
believes the expansion of the
program should be continued.
"I definitely think it should be

available to all freshmen," he
said.
Trancos freshman Val Vaden
said he would concur. Calling
the program "invaluable," he
pointed out "it's given me an
automatic upperclass friend as
well as a sounding board for
ideas." Although the house as
sociates are "very helpful" he
has found that in an all
freshman dorm "they can only
be spread so thin."
Trancos freshmen, while not
questioning the importance of
faculty/staff advising, say they
feel more comfortable interact
ing with fellow students.
'There's less of a generation
gap," said Val. "They're help
ful not only in deciding what
classes to take but also what
parties to go to."
