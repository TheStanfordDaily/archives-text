# Square tomato in wide use

Los Angeles (AP) — Being square is very "in"
these days with California's processing tomato
growers.
They have switched to a special breed of to
matoes that consumers would be shocked to
find in the supermarket produce department.
They're square.
The homely, thick-skinned fruit was de
veloped to withstand the rigors of mechanical
harvesting and is primarily used in processed
foods such as ketchup, tomato soup and pizza
sauce.
Comments on the taste range from "like rub
ber" to "just like ordinary."
Bigger growers say the new tomato allows
them to stay in business when farm labor be
comes scarce because they're able to use newly
developed machinery to pick the bruise
resistant fruit. But, ironically, the square tomato
also has helped to squash the economic liveli
hood of many smaller growers, as well as field
workers.
The square tomato was the result of research,
begun in the 1950s at UC-Davis aimed at produc
ing a tomato strong enough to survive mechani
cal picking.
In 1962, a tough new plant emerged from the

Davis labs that grew evenly and blossomed and
ripened in unison. Additional developments
improved yield and allowed a longer harvest
time.
Mechanical harvesters pluck the tomatoes
from the vine with automated arms. From there
they go to conveyor belts feeding into 900-
pound containers which are later dumped into
giant 12-ton tanks — a rough-and-tumble jour
ney that used to batter even the strongest con
ventional tomato.
But the new square tomatoes can take it and as
a result, more and more use is being made of
mechanical harvesting — a trend that has
prompted mounting criticism over the social
and economic changes introduced by the new
technology.
A study by William Friedland and Amy Barton
at Davis blames mechanical harvesting in part
for reducing the number of growers in the state
by more than 85 percent and eliminating 32,000
farm worker jobs.
But despite the controversy, researchers see
the day when all tomatoes will be mechanically
harvested. And they'll have a new improved
flavor, too. Now if they could only make them
round.
