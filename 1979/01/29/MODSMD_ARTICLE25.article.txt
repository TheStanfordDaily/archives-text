# Cardinals bow to Oregonians; drop to sixth-place tie in Pac-10

### Chris Haft 
Eugene — Running into an overabundance of bas
ketball talent one night and an earful of referees'
whistles the second, Stanford fell to Oregon State
73-48 Friday night and to Oregon 68-55 Saturday even
ing.
The double defeats pushed the Cardinals' overall
record back to 9-9 overall and i-b in the Pacific-10
Conference. Moreover, the Cards own a dreary 2-6
road mark.
In most of its defeats this season, Stanford has
entered the locker room at halftime either holding a
slim lead or trailing by a small margin, only to slump
in one aspect or another during the second half. This
past weekend was no exception.
The road trip's highlight — if you could call it that —
occurred Friday, when Oregon State shot a school
record 71.1 percent (32-for-45), eclipsing the 65.5 fi
gure achieved against USC Jan. 13, 1978.
During pre-game warmups OSU toward Julius
Allen repeated the phrase "Sellouts and blowouts"
several times to his teammates.
The first term referred to the fact that this was the
Beavers' 15th consecutive home sellout crowd; the
second portended what would take place in the sec
ond half.
With 6:10 remaining in the first half Jeff Ryan grab
bed his own missed shot and followed it in, giving the
Cards a 19-18 lead — their last of the game.
Minutes later Dwayne Allen's whirling left-handed
jump hook caused insanity among the 10,109 Beaver
backers and climaxed a 12-2 streak that helped OSU
to a 30-23 advantage.
Kimberly Belton's windmilling reverse lay-up and
Ryan's short baseline jumper put Stanford within
34-31 early in the second half, suggesting that a close
finish lay ahead.
However, Lady Fortune's scales soon tipped in
OSU's favor.
Trailing 38-33, Stanford failed twice to cut the mar
gin to three. The Beavers capitalized by extending
their lead t042-33 on Mark Radford's bomb and Tony
Martin's lay-in.
The Cards were then forced to switch from a zone
to a man-to-man defense in an attempt to apply more
pressure.
It was the right move for Stanford, but a futile one,
as OSU's superior quickness and once-in-a-lifetime
shooting thoroughly overpowered the Cards.
Led by Steve Johnson's five-for-five, the Beavers

sank 15 of 18 second-half shots as their lead multip
lied like amoeba from 42-34 to 60-40.
The tremendous din released from the throats of
Gill Coliseum's multitude at that point meant one
thing — Stanford was through.
"The big difference was that we took care of the
basketball," said OSU coach Ralph Miller, who
should have added that it's a whole hell of a lot easier
to take care of the ball when you're shooting 71 per
cent. "We ran our back-door play close to perfec
tion," he went on.
Meanwhile, Stanford had severe problems offen
sively, as OSU's zone was big enough to hinder the
Cards' passing and mobile enough to cut off the
openings for good shots.
"They played three guys out front who were 6-4,
6-5,6-4 (Radford, D. Allen, Ray Blume) — that makes it
difficult to pass over or around them," Card coach
Dick Dißiaso explained.
"Success comes when you play consistently close
to what your strengths are," Dißiaso theorized,
evaluating the Beavers. "Theirs are speed, agility,
ballhandling ability . . . that's what basketball is all
about, and that enables them to be quicker offen
sively and defensively."
Displayinga nicearrayof hooks, short jumpersand
follows, the smooth 6-10 Johnson finished with a
perfect nine-for-nine from the floor and a season
high 26 points in just 24 minutes. Dwayne Ailen (five
for-five) and Martin (four-for-four) also shot flaw
lessly.
The Cards had a much better chance to win the next
night against Oregon, which played without starting
guard Felton Sealey (injured foot) and 6-10 center
Dan Hartshorne (strained knee ligament), the Ducks'
leading scorer.
Indeed, Stanford sank 23 field goals to the Ducks'
22. The decisive disparity, however, was at the free
throw line, where Oregon made 24 of 33 attempts to
Stanford's 9 of 12.
Dißiaso initially commented, "I don't think the foul
situation was a factor," but upon looking at the statis
tics sheet, he said, "I'll tell you what — it's hard to
believe."
Oregon held the lead for most ol the first half while
being spurred towards glory by the vociferous gather
ing at tiny, rickety McArthur Court, the Fenway Park
of college basketball.
Significantly aided by 55 percent first-halt shooting,
the Cards stayed close enough and took a 33-31 lead
on Wolfe Perry's foul-line jumper with 17:43 remain
ing to play.
That lead was short-lived, as the Ducks ripped off

nine straight points in less than 2Vi minutes on Mike
Clark's tree throw, Phil Barner's baseline jumper,
Clark's short turn-around jumper, Barner's 17-footer
and Kelvin Small's two free throws.
Stanford was hampered by its inability to get more
than one shot each trip downcourt. The Cards col
lected just two offensive rebounds all night, a shock
ingly low figure.
"We didn't give them a lot of garbage around the
basket," said Oregon coach )im Haney. "That was
important."
Another Clark charity toss gave Oregon a 49- i9
cushion with 1:20 to go. Seconds later the Ducks still
had a substantial 50-41 lead, but then Stanford began
its first aborted comeback, closing to within 50-47 on
Ryan's turn-around jumper, Paul Giovacchini's 10-
foot bank shot and Steve Crandell's foul-line jumper.
Rob Closs' driving layin past five Cardinal jerseys
with 2:41 remaining caught the Cards asleep at a most
inopportune time and gave the Ducks a 58-51 lead.
Vet Stanford did its best to deny the Ducks the
bread crumbs of victory. Ryan sank a 10-footer, and
Perry hit a breakaway lay-in following Daryle Mor
gan's steal on the full-court press to make it 58-55 with
1:57 to go.
That's when Oregon's parade to the free-throw line
became a veritable stampede, as the Ducks scored
the game's final 10 points from the security of the
charity stripe.
Dißiaso felt that the Cards' comeback attempts
never fully culminated. "Each time we made a run we
combined that with a tu mover and a couple of missed
shots," he said.
Another factor was Belton's surprising lack of scor
ing and Stu Lyon's equally unexpected cornucopia of
points.
Small, whose muscular 6-8, 209-lb. stature belies
his surname, paid Belton close defensive attention all
evening. As a result, Belton received few passes while
in shooting position; some that were meant for him
went awry. He took just three shots, and his tour
point total was a season low.
Lyon had scored just 26 points all season before
Saturday, but with Sealey out of the lineup, the 6-4
sophomore filled in well at guard, tallying a career
high 16 points to lead all scorers.
The last minute of the first half was particularly
active for Lyon. He made one free throw and missed
the second, but rebounded his own miss and hit a
20-footer. As Stanford worked for one shot Lyon stole
a pass and sped for a breakaway lay-up four seconds
before the half ended.
