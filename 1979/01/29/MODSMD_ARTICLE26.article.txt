# Stanford swimmers douse UOP in a splash
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Mike Bruner swimming the
sprint races? Linda lezek
dominating not the backstroke
but the freestyle events? Hold
it a second. Something appears
to be amiss here.
No, coach |im Gaughran was
not playing 52-card pick-up
with his entry cards. The Cards
purposely competed in their
off-events and still routed the
University of Pacific in a low
pressure dual meet at de-
Guerre Saturday.
The men pummelled their
opponents, 88-19, in allowing
only one Pacific victory to slip
through their fingers. In an at
mosphere marked by casual
camaraderie, they displayed an
amazing versatility.
Tom O'Brien, coming back
from a broken arm, was "just
starting to look like his old
self," according to Gaughran.
He threshed to a strong tirst
place finish in his specialty, the
200 yard butterfly, in 1:54.3and
pulled through an equally im
pressive third-place 500 free
(4:45.4).
Sam Franklin, usually a

sprinter, moved up in distance
to claim a third in the same 200
fly competition. Gaughran
touted Franklin's 1:56.8 as his
"best 200 fly in a long time."
John Kingery normally sticks

to backstroke and short
distance freestyle but rallied to
his lifetime-best 500 free
(4:42.3) to "win by an eyelash/'
in the words of announcer
swimmer Jim Belardi.

A few swimmers participated
in their more traditional
events. Boh Hagberg exploded
off the blocks to annihilate the
50 yard free field in a
lightening-quick 21.2. Wade

Flemons cruised to a 10-second
victory in the 200 backstroke
(1:55.6).
Announcer Belardi warned
the crowd to "be prepared" for
the final race of the day, the
men's 400 freestyle relay, with
proper justification. The Stan
ford unofficial "C" relay, com
prised of Paul Hartloff, Monte
Brown, Kingery and a fatigued
O'Brien, threatened to "thrash
these guys" in reference to the
A team of Flemons, Bruner,
Kevin Reel and Mike Ander
son. Trailing until the last lap,
the "A' "s inched by the "C"
relay to redeem their near
drowned pride with a 3:16.4
win.
On the women's side of the
deck, the Cardinals pillaged
Pacific, 87-26. Although the
women's performances were
not so astounding, several
noteworthy swims ensued.
Zena Herrmann opened the
meet with a 100 back split of
1:01.7 on the 400 medley relay
and culminated the women's
events with one of her best
ever 100 free times, a 53.8 split

for her triumphant 400 free
relay team. In between, she
captured the 200 backstroke
crown in 2:12.3.
Tri-captain Jo Clark, another
ailing swimmer, swam a nega
tive split 1000 free to win in
10:22.8 while teammate kelley
Cough touched second to the
accompaniment of encourag
ing cheers. Cough achieved
her best 500 time on her way to
her fastest 1000 (11:05.8) and
what assistant coach Claudia
Thomas guessed was her high
est finish ever for Stanford.
Libby Beaudet persisted in
her crusade for increasingly
faster swims with an evenly
paced 200 fly victory (2:04.5).
Thomas explained the rela
tive lack of good sprints. "The
sprinters are at their low point
as far as tiredness," she said.
They begin their taper for im
portant meets today.
The men will swim against
UCLA at deGuerre Friday and
take on the Texas A&M Aggies
Saturday. The women will see
tri-meet competition Saturday
against the Texans and Ore
eon.

amazing versatility.
Tom O'Brien, coming back
from a broken arm, was "just
starting to look like his old
self," according to Gaughran.
He threshed to a strong tirst
place finish in his specialty, the
200 yard butterfly, in 1:54.3and
pulled through an equally im
pressive third-place 500 free
(4:45.4).
Sam Franklin, usually a

sprinter, moved up in distance
to claim a third in the same 200
fly competition. Gaughran
touted Franklin's 1:56.8 as his
"best 200 fly in a long time."
John Kingery normally sticks

to backstroke and short
distance freestyle but rallied to
his lifetime-best 500 free
(4:42.3) to "win by an eyelash/'
in the words of announcer
swimmer Jim Belardi.

A few swimmers participated
in their more traditional
events. Boh Hagberg exploded
off the blocks to annihilate the
50 yard free field in a
lightening-quick 21.2. Wade

Flemons cruised to a 10-second
victory in the 200 backstroke
(1:55.6).
Announcer Belardi warned
the crowd to "be prepared" for
the final race of the day, the
men's 400 freestyle relay, with
proper justification. The Stan
ford unofficial "C" relay, com
prised of Paul Hartloff, Monte
Brown, Kingery and a fatigued
O'Brien, threatened to "thrash
these guys" in reference to the
A team of Flemons, Bruner,
Kevin Reel and Mike Ander
son. Trailing until the last lap,
the "A' "s inched by the "C"
relay to redeem their near
drowned pride with a 3:16.4
win.
On the women's side of the
deck, the Cardinals pillaged
Pacific, 87-26. Although the
women's performances were
not so astounding, several
noteworthy swims ensued.
Zena Herrmann opened the
meet with a 100 back split of
1:01.7 on the 400 medley relay
and culminated the women's
events with one of her best
ever 100 free times, a 53.8 split

for her triumphant 400 free
relay team. In between, she
captured the 200 backstroke
crown in 2:12.3.
Tri-captain Jo Clark, another
ailing swimmer, swam a nega
tive split 1000 free to win in
10:22.8 while teammate kelley
Cough touched second to the
accompaniment of encourag
ing cheers. Cough achieved
her best 500 time on her way to
her fastest 1000 (11:05.8) and
what assistant coach Claudia
Thomas guessed was her high
est finish ever for Stanford.
Libby Beaudet persisted in
her crusade for increasingly
faster swims with an evenly
paced 200 fly victory (2:04.5).
Thomas explained the rela
tive lack of good sprints. "The
sprinters are at their low point
as far as tiredness," she said.
They begin their taper for im
portant meets today.
The men will swim against
UCLA at deGuerre Friday and
take on the Texas A&M Aggies
Saturday. The women will see
tri-meet competition Saturday
against the Texans and Ore
eon.

808 HAGBERG explodes off the block to annihilate the 50 yard free field in a lightening quick 21.2
seconds. Hagberg was one of the few swimmers to compete in his traditional event in the meet against
UOP here Saturday.
Mike Bruner swimming the
sprint races? Linda lezek
dominating not the backstroke
but the freestyle events? Hold
it a second. Something appears
to be amiss here.
No, coach |im Gaughran was
not playing 52-card pick-up
with his entry cards. The Cards
purposely competed in their
off-events and still routed the
University of Pacific in a low
pressure dual meet at de-
Guerre Saturday.
The men pummelled their
opponents, 88-19, in allowing
only one Pacific victory to slip
through their fingers. In an at
mosphere marked by casual
camaraderie, they displayed an
amazing versatility.
