# Card nine breaks out bats and balls
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The sun may be shining and the birds singing, but the chill in
the air and the heading on the calendar page remind us that it's
not yet spring.
The start of baseball season, however — a telling sign of spring
to the sports enthusiast — is upon us. The Stanford varsity
baseball team takes to the tield tomorrow afternoon in Stockton
against University of the Pacific for its first contest of the 1979
preseason.
An earlier and somewhat shorter preseason forthe '79 Cardinal
nine is the result of both Arizona and Arizona State being added
to the company of USC, UCLA, Cal-Berkeley and Stanford in the
Southern Division of the new Pacific-10 league.
With five opponents instead of the usual three, Stanford will
begin a 30-game, instead of 18-game, league schedule the first
weekend of March in what is regarded as the toughest league in
the nation.
"I don't think anyone knows what to expect from this new
league," commented Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"From our standpoint it makes things just that much tougher, but
it makes it tougher on everyone in the division. At least this way,
one bad weekend won't knock you out."
According to Marquess, the years of total domination by one
team (USC, in particular) are over. But the Cardinals are really
going to have to fight if they are going to be the ones looking
down on the rest of the pack when the season ends. It's going to
be a scramble.
Stanford will be scrambling for the top this year unaided by last
year's big guns. But new faces and new positions for some old
faces will give this year's team an exciting new look and a promis
ing outlook.
Mike Codiroli, veteran centerfielder who may also pitch in
relief this year, spoke positively about the upcoming season.
Codiroli said, "We've got a lot of team speed ... all through the
lineup. Out on the field we'll be tough: it's just a matter of getting
the pitching."
Teammate Larry Reynolds, who started practicing less than one
month ago after playing in the Bluebonnet Bowl, agreed with
Codiroli on the good overall team speed, but said "our biggest
asset will be the defense." Reynolds further explained how, at the
plate, the 1979 Cards will hit for an average. "We're not going to
be a big power team," he said.
If the pitching comes through this year, Stanford won't have to

worry about big bats. With last year's entire pitching staff having
returned, and the addition of two freshman hurlers, chances are
that the mound will be a focal point for this team.
Larry kuhn< hard-throwing righthander who picked up Stan
ford's only victory against the awesome (JSC Trojans last year, will
return as a iunior. Kuhn comes back strong this year after spend
ing the summer playing semi-pro ball in Northern California.
Mark Abbondola, Bruce Fiala, Brian Harrison, Rob Irwin and
Joe LoPresti, who all made league starts last year, return as
seniors. Paul Crame, freshman "phenom" who earned a varsity
start against Berkeley late last season, is a likely starter as a
sophomore.
LoPresti, who will be used primarily in relief again this year,
said "this is as good as we've looked in winter since I've been
here. I'm really encouraged about the team.''
New faces on the field this year include a sophomore junior
college transfer who will fill Dave Perez' shoes at shortstop. David
Meier, who was recruited but wasn't admitted to the University
last fall, joins coach Marquess and the Cardinals after one season
at Fresno City College near his home.
Meier said, "I really I ike going against tough competition." And
he'll get plenty of that in the Pac-10.
Elsewhere in the infield, John Pyle, a part-time outfielder and
designated hitter on last year's team, will play first base — the
position vacated by homerun king Tom Guardino.
Paul Zuvella has moved from third base to second where Todd
Ervin played last year. Phil Wilson, an outstanding all-position
player who worked behind the plate last year, will take over in the
hot corner as a sophomore.
Senior Bruce Walters will start at catcher this year with Mike
Freitas sharing those duties during the season.
Codiroli and Reynolds will cover two of the three fields for
Stanford this season, with Pat Crow, Mike Zboralske and Mike
Toothman vyingforthe third outfield spot which Marquesssaid is
"up for grabs."
Marquess said he plans to "experiment" with players and posi
tions, as usual, in preseason play. "But we're still going to try to
win," he added.
Rain has hampered practices off and on this past month, and
has set the team back somewhat. According to Marquess, Stan
ford s not far behind if they're behind at all. "It (the rain) has put
us back,' said Marquess, "but everyone's in the same boat."
That boat — the USS College Baseball — sets sail tomorrow.


CARDINAL LEFTHANDER Rob Irwin sends a pitch towards the plate during last year's baseball
action. Irwin, a senior, is counted on along with the other hurlers to propel Stanford to the
Pacific-10 Conference stratosphere.
