# Men gymnasts break 200 points

### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's gymnastics teams split with
the opposition again at Maples, the net
result equalling the previous home meet,
but with the roles reversed Saturday night.
A week ago Jackie Walker's women re
corded their first victory, while Sadao
Hamada's men came up short against
California and beat UCLA. This weekend
the men logged a decisive win over Cal
State-Northridge, 201.35 to 168.5, raising
their record to 2-1 and the women drop
ped to 1-3 after getting outscored by Cal
State-Hayward, 121.75 to 116.45.
In outdistancing Northridge, the men
surpassed the elusive 200 point total, giv
ing an encouraging indication of im
provement and consistency, especially in
all-around performances.
"I think on the whole the team did very
well," said co-captain Chris Takimoto. The
senior pommel horse specialist added, "It
was exciting — it was the first time since
I've been on the team that we scored
above 200. That's one of the goals we set."
"I think we all did better just because
there was less pressure in our second
meet," said Tad Bostick, winner of the all
around competition. "People were lots
looser — that's what meets are for — to get

you to loosen up so you can concentrate
on your event.
Results in the men's competition in
cluded particularly strong team showings
in vaulting and pommel horse. Bob Daniel
won vaulting, followed by a two-way tie for
second by Bostick and Dan Margulies. On
horse, although perennial standout
Takimoto literally fell to fourth place, the
Cardinals had enough depth with
freshman Mike Lee winning the event,
Bostick placing third and Brodie Lockard
taking sixth.
Craig Goldman and co-captain Dan
Wessner tied for second on rings, fol
lowed by Bob Daniel at fourth. In the floor
exercise, Bostick finished first while Bob
Maganini earned third and Lee placed
sixth. Bostick won the parallel bars event,
with Lee and Lockard tying for third and
Paul Nemcek placing sixth. Bostick also
took first on the high bar followed by
Maganini and Lee in third and John Marra
taking fifth.
In rolling up his third, second and three
firsts, Bostick won the all-around title with
a 51.4 total, his collegiate best. Lee placed
second only 1.55 points behind and Daniel
and Mara finished fifth and sixth.
"Definitely the team is improving con

sistently," Hamada observed. "Even some
of the mistakes we had today, I know why
they're missing, so it's all under control.''
Against a Hayward team characterized
not so much by overall strength and skill,
but by team consistency and depth, Stan
ford's women put on a bittersweet per
formance.
Sweet was Jeanette Lacoste being heal
thy enough to compete on beam and bars.
Sweet was also having Karen Hall able to
perform all-around for only the second
time this season and in so doing, putting
together one of her best optional beam
routines ever.
Bitter was a variety of maladies hamper
ing valuable practice time — an injured
foot for Cindy Sedlund, keeping her out of
floor exercise altogether, a bad ankle limit
ing Hall's workouts and a cold slowing
down captain Linda Park. Bitter too, were
falls and breaks in routines afflicting even
the most experienced athletes.
Unfortunately, bitter prevailed.
Individually, many bright moments
shone through for the Cards — Annie
Smith placed fourth in vaulting and floor
exercise and second on beam and bars to
wind up third in all-around. Hall finished
fourth on bars and won the vaulting, beam

and floor events for a 33.05 all-around to
tal, good for first place.
"I made it all the way through — I love
it," Hall said of her all-around showing. "I
usually hate beam but I wanted to do it
today," she added.
"I expected they would have a chance of
beating us because of our (lack of) depth,"
Walker explained. "We had a few more
falls on beam this week than last week — I
would like to get rid of that problem. On
bars, we had some disappointing mistakes
— major breaks on Annie's and Karen's
routines. Overall the whole team effort
was pretty good; I wasn't disappointed."
"Basically the worst thing holding them
back is the injuries that don't allow them to
work out hard enough during the week.
They weren't as psyched up for this
weekend as they were for last — last week
being their first home meet plus they had a
bigger crowd last weekend which helped
them a little," Walker added.
"I think that each of us had our own area
which we were very disappointed with and
will work hard at," Park said. "If we had hit
the way we have been, it would have been
much closer — we still might not have
beaten them, but it would have been
closer."
