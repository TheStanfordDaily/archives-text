### Emily Sachar Copyright 1979, The Stanford Daily 
President Richard Lyman, in New
York City this past weekend on busi
ness, may have been interviewed by
the Board of Trustees of the prestigi
ous Ford Foundation at its headquar
ters in New York.
The foundation is currently search
ingfora successorto retiring founda
tion President McCeorge Bundy. The
New York Times has reported that
Lyman is "being considered seri
ously" for the post. Several sources
close to Lyman refused to either con
firm or deny that the interview took
place.
Family members of two foundation
trustees reported the board mem
bers were en route home from a
meeting of the trustees in New York.
One of the family members said the
purpose of the meeting was to
choose a successor to Bundy.
According to )ean Fetter, assistant
to the president, Lyman is in New
York to attend a meeting of the IBM
Board of Directors on Tuesday.
Lyman will be in Washington, D.C.
later in the week on University busi
ness, Fetter added.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president

for public affairs, said he spoke with
Lyman at his New York hotel.
Rosenzweig would not release the
hotel's name. Efforts by the Daily to
locate Lyman yesterday proved fruit
less.
Other individuals mentioned to
succeed Bundy include Thomas
Ehrlich, president of the Legal Ser
vices Corporation, and a former
dean of the Stanford Law School and
Daniel Evans, former governor of
Washington and president of Everg
reen State College in Washington.
When asked whether Lyman was
being interviewed for the position,
Rosenzweig said, "If they (Ford
Foundation Board of Trustees) don't
want to say anything and Mr. Lyman
doesn't want to say anything, I'm not
going to say anything."
Alexander Heard, chairman of the
foundation's Board of Trustees and
head of the foundation's search
committee to find Bundy's successor
was also "in transit and has been in
New York City" over the weekend,
according to his wife.
Richard Magat, spokesman for the
foundation, said, "I have no informa
tion on this now. Call the Ford Foun
dation tomorrow.

"I don't know that it's (the new
president) been announced. I can't
comment at all. The trustees took the
position that they were not going to
comment on the selection process
long ago," Magat continued.
Three other foundation trustees
refused to comment on whether a
meeting had taken place in New York
over the weekend.
Speculation that a Ford Founda
tion decision was nearing and that
Lyman was a top prospect for the
presidency position heightened last
week when Food and Drug Administ
ration (FDA) Commissioner Donald
Kennedy was seen here.
Kennedy, an on-leave biology pro
fessor and former director of the
Human Biology Program here is vie
wed by many as a top candidate for
Lyman's position should he leave the
University.
According to Robert Beyers, direc
tor of the University News and Publi
cations Service, Kennedy was in the
area to give a lecture for a human
biology ( nurse and to st>e his daugh
ter who live; in »he area.
Beyer> quoted Kennedy as saying,
"No tine has talked with me about (a
position at) Stanford."
