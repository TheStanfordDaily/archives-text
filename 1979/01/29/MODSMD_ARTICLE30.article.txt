Stockton — The women's
basketball team needed a big
game after its tough experi
ence with San Jose State last
week. The Cardinals needed to
regain that physical and emo
tional edge they seemed to be
lacking during their past two
outings. The women could
have been singing "Just What I
Needed" to the University of
the Pacific's team Saturday
evening as they put it all to
gether in a 77-49 romp.
It took the Cards, now 3-3 in
league and 13-3 overall, almost
eight minutes to tame the Ti
gers of UOP, though, as they
spotted the hosts an early 8-2
lead.
Coach McCrea then moved
Jeanne Ruark to the wing posi
tion and brought in Louise
Smith to play the post. This var
iation worked like a charm as
Smith became the dominating
force under the boards and the
Cards never looked back after
pulling ahead 19-16.
Stanford played its most ag

gressive half of the season as
the women controlled both the
offensive and defensive boards
and ignited an impressive run
ning with quick outlet passes.
Louise Smith, after coming
off a fibular stress fracture
that sidelined her for a good
portion of the early season,
seemed to be improving with
every minute she played.
Smith drove to the basket
with dynamic aggressiveness
in route to a 14 point game. She
skied for seven rebounds and
rejected two shots.
The Cards went to the loc
kers with a comfortable 38-24
halftime lead and the domesti
cated Tigers thoroughly sub
dued. Stanford hauled in a
hefty 23 rebounds and limited
their turnovers to a relatively
frugal eight. Most importantly,
the women were controlling
the tempo of the game and
creating the breaks for them
selves.
Stanford resumed its zone
press with the second half's
commencement and im

mediately ran up a 20-point
lead with several outstanding
contributions. Kathy Schultz
turned in an impressive per
formance in reserve as she
maintained the team's aggres
sive style with scrappy play re
sulting in four rebounds and
Tiger troubles under the
boards.
The Cards then briefly lost
their concentration and con
trol of the game as a marathon
of miscues ensued between
the two teams. Coach McCrea
maintained order, though,
with a time-out and an ani
mated lecture.
Stanford returned to its ear
lier level of performance and
the Cats again were put out
doors. The Cardinals seemed
to gain much-needed confi

dencein theiroutside shooting
as a barrage of bombs com
plemented the inside game
and further perplexed UOP.
Renee Steiner and Beth
Boylan added six points apiece
to the Cardinal cause with
long-range accuracy.
High scorer Ruark continued
to hit from the floor with amaz
ing accuracy as she connected
on 78 percent (seven-for-nine)
of her shots for 17 points while
also grabbing 11 rebounds.
The floor leader, Angie Pac
cione, added 1? points and
dished off seven assists. Shelly
Chapman contributed her
usual stalwart yet vulpine
performance as she pulled in
four rebounds and caused sev
eral Tiger turnovers.
