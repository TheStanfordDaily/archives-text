Vice Premier Teng in Capitol
Washington — Teng Hsiao-ping, the driving
force in China's outward reach to the West, ar
rived in Washington yesterday for talks with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and a coast-to-coast tour that
will draw the world's most advanced nation and its
most populous nation closer together.
Teng's silver and gray Boeing 707 jet touched
down at Andrews Air Force Base outside the na
tion's capital at 3:30 p.m. EST, more than an hour
behind schedule, apparently because of fog in
Shanghai.
The Chinese vice premier, (he first of Peking's
Communist leaders to visit this country, was wel
comed by Vice President Walter Mondale, Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance and several members of
Congress.
After the ceremonies, members of Teng's dele
gation climbed into limousines for the 15-mile ride
to Blair House, across the street from the White
House. It will be Teng's home during his four-day
Washington stay.
Also in Washington, amid tight security and little
fanfare, former President Richard Nixon arrived by
commercial airline last night, the eve of his first
return to the White House since he left in disgrace
four years ago.
No government officials and only a few Secret
Service agents were at the runway to meet Nixon
as he descended the airplane ramp alone before
the other passengers disembarked. Nixon
climbed into a tan White House limousine that met
him on the runway, and the motorcade with police
escorts whisked him to a private Middleburg, Va.,
estate where he is staying.
Pope asks for social justice
Puebla, Mexico— Pope John Paul 11, cheered by
millions as he traveled to Puebla, repudiated
church militants in a majoraddress to Latin Ameri
can bishops yesterday, saying social justice must
be sought spiritually and not politically.
The pope encountered immediate opposition
from a group of rebel priests who organized a
"dissidents' conference" to demand that the
Roman Catholic church take a more active role
against oppression.

His speech opened the working session of the
third Latin American bishops' conference, which
is expected to determine the church's future role
in the social and political life of turbulent Latin
America.
In his address, the Polish-born pontiff cautioned
the bishops against depicting Christ as a political
figure involved in class struggle.
Rockefeller's body is cremated
Tarrytown, N.Y. — The body of former Vice Pres
ident Nelson Rockefeller was cremated yesterday,
family spokesmen said, a day before a private
memorial service was scheduled at the Rockefeller
estate overlooking the Hudson River.
Rockefeller's ashes will be buried today at the
family cemetery at the Pocantico Hills estate,
where he and his brother and sister spent much of
their childhood.
Rockefeller, who died Friday night at the age of
70, was cremated at the Ferndale Crematory in the
Westchester County town of Hartsdale, said a
spokeswoman who asked not to be identified.
A separate memorial service for family, friends
and national and international leaders was
scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday at the Riverside
Church on Manhattan's Upper West Side, which
was financed with the help of donations by Roc
kefeller's father, |ohn D. Rockefeller Jr.
Rockefeller served 15 years as governor of New
York and two years as vice president under Gerald
Ford.
Muskie assails Carter's budget
New York — Sen. Edmund Muskie (D-Maine),
said yesterday that $4 billion to $5 billion in Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's proposed budget might be
shifted to social programs to ensure congressional
approval.
Although reiterating his doubts about the ad
ministration's economic projections, Muskie said
he thought Carter's $29 billion deficit would hold
up if the projections were accurate.
However, Muskie, chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, said the projected rises of 6.2
percent in unemployment and 7.4 percent in infla
tion possibly were too optimistic.

He was interviewed on CBS-TV's Face the Nation
program.
He called Carter's 3 percent real-growth in
crease in defense spending "an elusive thing."
He also said he believed some of the proposed
cuts in Social Security benefits, including a prop
osal to eliminate lump-sum death payments,
would not be approved.
Hearst may get total clemency
San Francisco — Patricia Hearst was "smiling
very widely" yesterday after she was told of re
ports that President Jimmy Carter may soon com
mute her seven-year bank robbery sentence, her
jailers said.
Two newspapers reported yesterday that a
Justice Department recommendation to commute
Hearst's sentence had reached the White House
over the weekend.
There was no confirmation from the Justice De
partment or the White House.
Hearst, who will be 25 on Feb. 20, has served 22
months of her sentence for helping to rob a San
Francisco bank with her former Symbionese Lib
eration Army captors about nine weeks after she
was kidnapped from her Berkeley apartment five
years ago.
The San Francisco Examiner said the recom
mendation reached the desk of White House
counsel Robert Lipshutz on Friday. The newspaper
quoted an unnamed White House source as saying
presidential action on the recommendation was
expected "soon."
The Los Angeles Times, in a copyright story
quoting an unnamed administration source, said
the clemency recommendation was already on
Carter's desk awaiting his return from Camp
David. The newspaper said Carter was expected to
commute Hearst's sentence in "a few days."

said yesterday that $4 billion to $5 billion in Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's proposed budget might be
shifted to social programs to ensure congressional
approval.
Although reiterating his doubts about the ad
ministration's economic projections, Muskie said
he thought Carter's $29 billion deficit would hold
up if the projections were accurate.
However, Muskie, chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, said the projected rises of 6.2
percent in unemployment and 7.4 percent in infla
tion possibly were too optimistic.

He was interviewed on CBS-TV's Face the Nation
program.
He called Carter's 3 percent real-growth in
crease in defense spending "an elusive thing."
He also said he believed some of the proposed
cuts in Social Security benefits, including a prop
osal to eliminate lump-sum death payments,
would not be approved.
Hearst may get total clemency
San Francisco — Patricia Hearst was "smiling
very widely" yesterday after she was told of re
ports that President Jimmy Carter may soon com
mute her seven-year bank robbery sentence, her
jailers said.
Two newspapers reported yesterday that a
Justice Department recommendation to commute
Hearst's sentence had reached the White House
over the weekend.
There was no confirmation from the Justice De
partment or the White House.
Hearst, who will be 25 on Feb. 20, has served 22
months of her sentence for helping to rob a San
Francisco bank with her former Symbionese Lib
eration Army captors about nine weeks after she
was kidnapped from her Berkeley apartment five
years ago.
The San Francisco Examiner said the recom
mendation reached the desk of White House
counsel Robert Lipshutz on Friday. The newspaper
quoted an unnamed White House source as saying
presidential action on the recommendation was
expected "soon."
The Los Angeles Times, in a copyright story
quoting an unnamed administration source, said
the clemency recommendation was already on
Carter's desk awaiting his return from Camp
David. The newspaper said Carter was expected to
commute Hearst's sentence in "a few days."

Vice Premier Teng in Capitol
Washington — Teng Hsiao-ping, the driving
force in China's outward reach to the West, ar
rived in Washington yesterday for talks with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and a coast-to-coast tour that
will draw the world's most advanced nation and its
most populous nation closer together.
Teng's silver and gray Boeing 707 jet touched
down at Andrews Air Force Base outside the na
tion's capital at 3:30 p.m. EST, more than an hour
behind schedule, apparently because of fog in
Shanghai.
The Chinese vice premier, (he first of Peking's
Communist leaders to visit this country, was wel
comed by Vice President Walter Mondale, Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance and several members of
Congress.
After the ceremonies, members of Teng's dele
gation climbed into limousines for the 15-mile ride
to Blair House, across the street from the White
House. It will be Teng's home during his four-day
Washington stay.
Also in Washington, amid tight security and little
fanfare, former President Richard Nixon arrived by
commercial airline last night, the eve of his first
return to the White House since he left in disgrace
four years ago.
No government officials and only a few Secret
Service agents were at the runway to meet Nixon
as he descended the airplane ramp alone before
the other passengers disembarked. Nixon
climbed into a tan White House limousine that met
him on the runway, and the motorcade with police
escorts whisked him to a private Middleburg, Va.,
estate where he is staying.
Pope asks for social justice
Puebla, Mexico— Pope John Paul 11, cheered by
millions as he traveled to Puebla, repudiated
church militants in a majoraddress to Latin Ameri
can bishops yesterday, saying social justice must
be sought spiritually and not politically.

from a group of rebel priests who organized a
"dissidents' conference" to demand that the
Roman Catholic church take a more active role
against oppression.

His speech opened the working session of the
third Latin American bishops' conference, which
is expected to determine the church's future role
in the social and political life of turbulent Latin
America.
In his address, the Polish-born pontiff cautioned
the bishops against depicting Christ as a political
figure involved in class struggle.
