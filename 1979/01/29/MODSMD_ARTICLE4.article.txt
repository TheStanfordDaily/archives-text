# Rape Education Project: a broadreaching organization
## 
### Fran Miller 
"The image of REP (Rape Education
Project) as strictly an outreach is not
quite what we'd like it to be. It is real
important but there's a lot more that
needs to be done. We'd like to com
bine forces with other services, to be
sort of an umbrella organization."
This attitude was expressed by Lori
Parmer, a recent graduate and one of
the original coordinators of REP on
campus.
The pioject grew out of concern
on the part of Leah Kaplan, assistant
dean of student affairs, and a handful
of students who began last February
holding educational workshops on
the issues surrounding rape.
According to Parmer, the work
shops have served two purposes: to
present information and get feed
back from students, and to uncover
safety concerns on campus such as
dimly lit areas, so that REP members
can pass this information on to the
appropriate people.
Expansion
Since last spring, REP has ex
panded to include between 20 and 30
people, about one-fifth of whom are
men. The group is composed of stu
dents, alumni and staff members.
Parmer discussed the continual
problem of funding and volunteer
energy, which is "notoriously
sporadic." She said, "I've gone up
and down in my view of REP's survi
val. Now I think it's a real viable, ex
citing group."
Besides doing its own fundraising
last summer, REP receives money
from other =.ourros such as the Of
fice of the Oean of Student Affairs,
the YWCA, Memorial Church, ASSU,
the Stanford Mothers' Club, Resi
dential Education, Cowell Health
Center and the Women's Center.
"People are very supportive," said
Parmer.
Expenses
The group's main expense is the
printing of the booklet "Working
Against Rape," the result of a
SWOPSI research project, which is
distributed at each workshop. REP
must also pay for printing and pac
kaging material for members to re

ceive at all-day training sessions
which occur once a quarter. In addi
tion to these expenses, REP rented
two films dealing with rape, which
were shown at the Coffee House last
fall.
Paula Leca, who is responsible for
REP's bookkeeping, is also involved
in setting up a crisis counseling ser
vice, with the helpofWomen Against
Rape, a Bay Area organization whose
members plan to train 10or12 volun
teers to be victim assistants..She said
she hopes to have this center run
ning by next fall.
Leca said she also plans to set up a
large-scale open workshop at Trp
sidder in the spring in order to
"reach off-campus and grad students
whom you normally couldn't reach
by just going to different dorms."
Ultimate goal
Leca's ultimate goal, she admits,
"is to be able to pick a student at
random in White Plaza a,id have that
person know about REP. Half the bat
tle," she said, "is just getting people
to come to workshops."
Leca said she would like to see the
University provide funds for a paid
coordinator of women's activities
(which would include REP). She,
along with Sara Buxton, would also
like to set up a SWOPSI course deal
ing with the factual, social and politi
cal aspects of rape.
Buxton, however, said she sees
this project as a long-range goal. Hav
ing dealt with a rape victim in her
dorm, she is immediately involved in
the education of all RAs with regard
to "crisis counseling."
RA education
According to Buxton, "Most RAs
aren't clear on medical procedures
and police services, and don't know
what is normal' in the aftermath of a
rape." Her personal goal is to see
that RA orientation in the future in
cludes a discussion of sex roles and
information on all sorts of "crisis
counseling" including rape and se
vere depression and when and
where to refer a person for help.
Now, however, in order to expe
dite and facilitate knowledge of this
kind, a meeting will be held with sev

eral administrators, 12 or 13 RAs and
representatives from REP, Aurora
(the women's newspaper here) and
the Center for Research on Women
(CROW).
Randi Greenwald, another original
REP coordinator said, "I think it's re
ally getting there. I particularly regret
the fact that I didn't get to know sev
eral administrators earlier."
Discussion topics
Discussing the workshops,
Greenwald said that "although we
don't give a list of do's and don'ts,

there are a lot of different topics we
can touch on. These include: defini
tions of rape; personal, legal and so
cial myths about rapists and victims;
prevention and resistance; coping
with rape; medical care and
legalities."
Greenwald said she believes that
the laws are a "reflection of our own
social attitudes, and that often our
attitudes about rape and sex roles
perpetuate" the crime.
These views correlate with four of
the men involved in the program.

Bryan Coleman, Paul Helliker, Ed
Russell and Fred Spielberg all said
they believed that there were many
"subtle discriminations" here and
that "macho attitudes are really en
trenched."
"We've been exposed to a locker
room mentality," said Coleman. "As
a male you have to establish a
psychology about yourseli as a
man." He said he believes that rape is
a result of sex roles in society, and
that these roles where "the body is a
machine" degrades members of
both sexes.
Self-defense courses
The men were in favor of self
defense courses for women, and ex
pressed skepticism about the pros
pect of an escort service. "It's impor
tant for men to see how this is a ban
daid over a bigger problem," said
Coleman.
According to Spielberg, there are
three reasons why men should at
tend REP workshops: "It is a basic
human problem and people should
be aware; it is a male act; chances are
great that a woman they know will
get raped."
Helliker is interested in the aspect
of campus safety and is in the process
of drawing up a map of illuminated
routes, fireboxes, open buildings
women can run to, etc.
Russell said he hopes to become
more involved with the issue of the
"acquaintance rape." He said that "a
lot of men see what they're doing as
natural and expected in certain dat

ing situations."
In order to give a broader perspec
tive of those kinds of situations,
workshops are usually done by a
male and a female. Coleman, for
example, said he feels he has more
credibility with other men when dis
cussing the nature and potential
harm of sexist attitudes.
Helliker said he believes that "un
less people become progressively
blind, REP is a project that won't lose
concerned people."

(the women's newspaper here) and
the Center for Research on Women
(CROW).
Randi Greenwald, another original
REP coordinator said, "I think it's re
ally getting there. I particularly regret
the fact that I didn't get to know sev
eral administrators earlier."
Discussion topics
Discussing the workshops,
Greenwald said that "although we
don't give a list of do's and don'ts,

there are a lot of different topics we
can touch on. These include: defini
tions of rape; personal, legal and so
cial myths about rapists and victims;
prevention and resistance; coping
with rape; medical care and
legalities."
Greenwald said she believes that
the laws are a "reflection of our own
social attitudes, and that often our
attitudes about rape and sex roles
perpetuate" the crime.
These views correlate with four of
the men involved in the program.

Bryan Coleman, Paul Helliker, Ed
Russell and Fred Spielberg all said
they believed that there were many
"subtle discriminations" here and
that "macho attitudes are really en
trenched."
"We've been exposed to a locker
room mentality," said Coleman. "As
a male you have to establish a
psychology about yourseli as a
man." He said he believes that rape is
a result of sex roles in society, and
that these roles where "the body is a
machine" degrades members of
both sexes.
Self-defense courses
The men were in favor of self
defense courses for women, and ex
pressed skepticism about the pros
pect of an escort service. "It's impor
tant for men to see how this is a ban
daid over a bigger problem," said
Coleman.
According to Spielberg, there are
three reasons why men should at
tend REP workshops: "It is a basic
human problem and people should
be aware; it is a male act; chances are
great that a woman they know will
get raped."
Helliker is interested in the aspect
of campus safety and is in the process
of drawing up a map of illuminated
routes, fireboxes, open buildings
women can run to, etc.
Russell said he hopes to become
more involved with the issue of the
"acquaintance rape." He said that "a
lot of men see what they're doing as
natural and expected in certain dat

ing situations."
In order to give a broader perspec
tive of those kinds of situations,
workshops are usually done by a
male and a female. Coleman, for
example, said he feels he has more
credibility with other men when dis
cussing the nature and potential
harm of sexist attitudes.
Helliker said he believes that "un
less people become progressively
blind, REP is a project that won't lose
concerned people."
"The image of REP (Rape Education
Project) as strictly an outreach is not
quite what we'd like it to be. It is real
important but there's a lot more that
needs to be done. We'd like to com
bine forces with other services, to be
sort of an umbrella organization."
This attitude was expressed by Lori
Parmer, a recent graduate and one of
the original coordinators of REP on
campus.
The pioject grew out of concern
on the part of Leah Kaplan, assistant
dean of student affairs, and a handful
of students who began last February
holding educational workshops on
the issues surrounding rape.
According to Parmer, the work
shops have served two purposes: to
present information and get feed
back from students, and to uncover
safety concerns on campus such as
dimly lit areas, so that REP members
can pass this information on to the
appropriate people.
Expansion
Since last spring, REP has ex
panded to include between 20 and 30
people, about one-fifth of whom are
men. The group is composed of stu
dents, alumni and staff members.
Parmer discussed the continual
problem of funding and volunteer
energy, which is "notoriously
sporadic." She said, "I've gone up
and down in my view of REP's survi
val. Now I think it's a real viable, ex
citing group."
Besides doing its own fundraising
last summer, REP receives money
from other =.ourros such as the Of
fice of the Oean of Student Affairs,
the YWCA, Memorial Church, ASSU,
the Stanford Mothers' Club, Resi
dential Education, Cowell Health
Center and the Women's Center.
"People are very supportive," said
Parmer.
Expenses
The group's main expense is the
printing of the booklet "Working
Against Rape," the result of a
SWOPSI research project, which is
distributed at each workshop. REP
must also pay for printing and pac
kaging material for members to re

ceive at all-day training sessions
which occur once a quarter. In addi
tion to these expenses, REP rented
two films dealing with rape, which
were shown at the Coffee House last
fall.
Paula Leca, who is responsible for
REP's bookkeeping, is also involved
in setting up a crisis counseling ser
vice, with the helpofWomen Against
Rape, a Bay Area organization whose
members plan to train 10or12 volun
teers to be victim assistants..She said
she hopes to have this center run
ning by next fall.
Leca said she also plans to set up a
large-scale open workshop at Trp
sidder in the spring in order to
"reach off-campus and grad students
whom you normally couldn't reach
by just going to different dorms."
Ultimate goal
Leca's ultimate goal, she admits,
"is to be able to pick a student at
random in White Plaza a,id have that
person know about REP. Half the bat
tle," she said, "is just getting people
to come to workshops."
Leca said she would like to see the
University provide funds for a paid
coordinator of women's activities
(which would include REP). She,
along with Sara Buxton, would also
like to set up a SWOPSI course deal
ing with the factual, social and politi
cal aspects of rape.
Buxton, however, said she sees
this project as a long-range goal. Hav
ing dealt with a rape victim in her
dorm, she is immediately involved in
the education of all RAs with regard
to "crisis counseling."
RA education
According to Buxton, "Most RAs
aren't clear on medical procedures
and police services, and don't know
what is normal' in the aftermath of a
rape." Her personal goal is to see
that RA orientation in the future in
cludes a discussion of sex roles and
information on all sorts of "crisis
counseling" including rape and se
vere depression and when and
where to refer a person for help.
Now, however, in order to expe
dite and facilitate knowledge of this
kind, a meeting will be held with sev

eral administrators, 12 or 13 RAs and
representatives from REP, Aurora
(the women's newspaper here) and
the Center for Research on Women
(CROW).
