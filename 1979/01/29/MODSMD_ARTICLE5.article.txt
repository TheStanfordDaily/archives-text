"The rich American government is
in a political and economic crisis.
They are losing much of their money
which they were pumping out of Vie
tnam, Africa and all over the world.
They can't atford to have minorities
living at a high economic level," said
Carlos Montes, a former member of
the Brown Berets, in a speech here.
Montes spoke last Thursday even
ing about the "Past, Present, and Fu
ture of the Chicano Movement." A
large part of the talk centered on the
short but turbulent career of the
Brown Berets, an East Los Angeles
based Chicano organization.
The Berets, he said, were or
ganized in 1967, primarily to "protect
(Chicano youths) against unfair, ra
cist teachers" in the Los Angeles
school system, and to "demand clas
ses in Chicano history and culture,
bilingual education, and (the hiring
of) more Chicano teachers "
Demands
To effect these demands, tne Be
rets organized the massive Chicano
high school walk-outs of 1968, in
which thousands of studer ts partici
pated to protest the "racist" condi
tions prevalent in the school system.
From 196? on, the movement
gained nationwide momentum as
Chicanos throughout the United
States realized that the "Chicano as a
people of the United States didn't
have any control over their political
and economic lives. We wanted

self-determination as a people," he
said.
A major battle which the Brown
Berets fought, and which Montes
said is still continuing, is the one
against police brutality. He cited sev
eral cases which he said were "blat
ant examples" of police abuse,
among them spying, infiltration of
Chicano organizations, beatings,
"frame-ups" and murder. He
pointed to a recent case where a
policeman was convicted of first
degree murder for the shooting of a
13-year-old Chicano youth.
Demonstration
Montes is currently facing charges
which date back to a 1969 demonstra
tion against Ronald Reagan. Montes
said the charges are anotherexample
of police and government harass
ment.
The incident which led to the cur
rent charges was, he said, the result
of a deliberate attempt by the police
?nd FBI to frame him and disband the
Brown Berets. The charges stem
from a demonstration against the
presence of Reagan as the keynote
speaker at the Biltmore Hotel con
ference on Mexican-American Edu
cation.
Montes said that weeks before the
conference, Reagan had cut back on
Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP)
funds, which were a 'lirect source of
money for minority education. He
said that Reagan had come to "tell
everyone how nice everything was,"

and his presence was hypocritical.
They demonstrated to expose
Reagan as "the racist he really is,"
Montes said.
During the demonstration,
Montes said a policeman who had
gone undercover as a member of the
Brown Berets left and set several fires
throughout the hotel. The primary
charge faced by Montes is conspiracy
to commit arson.
Lack of evidence
Nine other people who were ar
rested on the same charges as
Montes have been released because
of lack of evidence. Montes said they
are pursuing his case because he has
remained active in the Chicano
movement.
"I'm being used as a scapegoat, an
example to anyone else who wants to
organize Chicano movements," he
said.
Montes jumped bail in 19b8 and
went to live in Texas with hiswifeand
family under a different name, he
said. He did so because of the con
stant harassment he and family
members were facing from the
police. While in Texas, he helped or
ganize Chicano factory workers in
order to gain both union representa
tion and race recognition.
Upon his return to Los Angeles for
a tamily reunion he was arrested and
a trial date was set for lanuary 31.
Montes said that hundreds of com
munity members will attend in pro
test of his unjust treatment.
