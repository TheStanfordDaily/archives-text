# Jonestown survivors talk of concentration camp existence
## 
### Robert James 
Two members of the Peoples Temple who es
caped the Jonestown camp last November addres
sed a psychology class here last Tuesday.
Both Diane Louie, 26, and Richard Clark, 42,
made their first public presentation as part of Prof.
Philip Zimbardo's class, "The Human Connec
tion." Louie and Clark have been active members
of the Temple for over six years, they said.
They fled the settlement into the Guyana jungle
November 17, the day of the arrival of the late Rep.
Leo Ryan (D-San Mateo). The following day, Ryan
and his party were ambushed and the mass
suicides occurred.
The speakers attributed psychic powers to the
group's leader, the Rev. |im lones, including the
ability to raise people from the dead and to cure
cancer. Louie, a San Francisco surgical technician,
said, "I know as a nurse that there are powers of
the mind that cannot be explained, and )ones did
things which may seem to us to be miracles. '' Clark
testified that Jones cured a man of blindness dur
ing a church service.
When Jones came with his followers to the
Jonestown camp, however, many of the members
became disenchanted.
Clark, a laborer and former farmhand in the
South, said, "It was a concentration camp he ran.
Everybody was treated with the utmost cruelty. We
had been told that we would have the best of

everything. In fact we were fed on rice and gravy,
we had to work in 100-degree heat with high
humidity. Fourteen of us were jammed into a hut
12 feet by 12."
Louie described the punishment that faced the
members: "When people broke any of the rules
they would be put into boxes and left in the
ground. Some of the boxes were made of
aluminum. In that heat this was almost a death
sentence."
In a Daily interview Friday, Zimbardo said that
he would label as "cases of misreporting" articles
reported by Campus Report and the Associated
Press that claimed Louie and Clark had stated that
Jones forced the members into homosexual acts.
Zimbardo asserted that Louie and Clark said
"Jones made them admit that they were homosex
ual, not engage in homosexual acts themselves.
Fie discouraged sex in general, except with him
self." The escapees said that Jones had sexual rela
tions with males and females, Zimbardo added.
In the final days, when Rep. Ryan came to the
settlement, "Jones went insane, there's no doubt
about it," Clark said. "He made us all sing
'America the Beautiful.' For the first time in years,
we were given proper food to eat."
The Jonestown speakers shared the platform
with Alex Armour, an undergraduate here who
underwent indoctrination with the Unification
Church of Sun Myung Moon as a research project.
Zimbardo arranged the program to give students

in the class opportunities to relate to "the experi
ences of normal, average people who became in
volved in these organizations," ha said.
Zimbardo's research interest is in the psychol
ogy of evil and authority, studied in the context of
the systems in which they occur. "The media focus
on the people, not the system," Zimbardo said.
"They talk about 'Jones the hypnotist' and his
'weak-willed people.' But ]ones had power be
cause he was able to create a system."
While Jones maintained his organization in San
Francisco, he acquired "a very powerful influence
on members and politicians," Zimbardo con
tinued. Members were controlled by intimida
tion; Jones "managed to redefine reality for
them."
"He used his power over his congregation of
followers so that he could, in turn, exploit the
politicians. Theyin turn thought they were exploit
ing him."
By offering block votes and donations to various
public figures, Zimbardo said, "he got political
power himself, for the politicians repaid him with
political plums, such as a seat on the San Francisco
Housing Board, and a letter of thanks from
Rosalynn Carter."
Zimbardo, a San Francisco resident, said he had
friends with connections with the Temple organi
zation and he was aware of its political activities.
He did not realize or anticipate, however, the ex
tent of the power which Jones held over his group.

ences of normal, average people who became in
volved in these organizations," ha said.
Zimbardo's research interest is in the psychol
ogy of evil and authority, studied in the context of
the systems in which they occur. "The media focus
on the people, not the system," Zimbardo said.
"They talk about 'Jones the hypnotist' and his
'weak-willed people.' But ]ones had power be
cause he was able to create a system."
While Jones maintained his organization in San
Francisco, he acquired "a very powerful influence
on members and politicians," Zimbardo con
tinued. Members were controlled by intimida
tion; Jones "managed to redefine reality for
them."
"He used his power over his congregation of
followers so that he could, in turn, exploit the
politicians. Theyin turn thought they were exploit
ing him."
By offering block votes and donations to various
public figures, Zimbardo said, "he got political
power himself, for the politicians repaid him with
political plums, such as a seat on the San Francisco
Housing Board, and a letter of thanks from
Rosalynn Carter."
Zimbardo, a San Francisco resident, said he had
friends with connections with the Temple organi
zation and he was aware of its political activities.
He did not realize or anticipate, however, the ex
tent of the power which Jones held over his group.
Two members of the Peoples Temple who es
caped the Jonestown camp last November addres
sed a psychology class here last Tuesday.
Both Diane Louie, 26, and Richard Clark, 42,
made their first public presentation as part of Prof.
Philip Zimbardo's class, "The Human Connec
tion." Louie and Clark have been active members
of the Temple for over six years, they said.
They fled the settlement into the Guyana jungle
November 17, the day of the arrival of the late Rep.
Leo Ryan (D-San Mateo). The following day, Ryan
and his party were ambushed and the mass
suicides occurred.
The speakers attributed psychic powers to the
group's leader, the Rev. |im lones, including the
ability to raise people from the dead and to cure
cancer. Louie, a San Francisco surgical technician,
said, "I know as a nurse that there are powers of
the mind that cannot be explained, and )ones did
things which may seem to us to be miracles. '' Clark
testified that Jones cured a man of blindness dur
ing a church service.
When Jones came with his followers to the
Jonestown camp, however, many of the members
became disenchanted.
Clark, a laborer and former farmhand in the
South, said, "It was a concentration camp he ran.
Everybody was treated with the utmost cruelty. We
had been told that we would have the best of

everything. In fact we were fed on rice and gravy,
we had to work in 100-degree heat with high
humidity. Fourteen of us were jammed into a hut
12 feet by 12."
Louie described the punishment that faced the
members: "When people broke any of the rules
they would be put into boxes and left in the
ground. Some of the boxes were made of
aluminum. In that heat this was almost a death
sentence."
In a Daily interview Friday, Zimbardo said that
he would label as "cases of misreporting" articles
reported by Campus Report and the Associated
Press that claimed Louie and Clark had stated that
Jones forced the members into homosexual acts.
Zimbardo asserted that Louie and Clark said
"Jones made them admit that they were homosex
ual, not engage in homosexual acts themselves.
Fie discouraged sex in general, except with him
self." The escapees said that Jones had sexual rela
tions with males and females, Zimbardo added.
In the final days, when Rep. Ryan came to the
settlement, "Jones went insane, there's no doubt
about it," Clark said. "He made us all sing
'America the Beautiful.' For the first time in years,
we were given proper food to eat."
The Jonestown speakers shared the platform
with Alex Armour, an undergraduate here who
underwent indoctrination with the Unification
Church of Sun Myung Moon as a research project.
Zimbardo arranged the program to give students

in the class opportunities to relate to "the experi
ences of normal, average people who became in
volved in these organizations," ha said.
