Drinking is nothing new
here, but the administration's
growing concern over
alcohol-related problems has
raised some difficult ques
tions. Why do people drink?
What are the consequences of
drinking? And what can the
University do to both educate
and treat alcohol abusers?

of residential education, is one

"Some people drink for psychological
reasons. They begin treating all their
tensions with alcohol
-Dr. Vincent D'Andrea

administrator who has expres
sed concern over increasing
alcohol abuse on campus. Her
worry stems from the large
number of reported drunken
incidents here and at other
schools, from complaints from
nondrinkers and from growing
damage costs to residences
because of "destructive ac
tivities" of some heavy drin
kers.
In an attempt to gauge the
apparent increase in drinking
problems, Dr. )ohn Dorman
analyzed the number of stu
dents admitted to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center for serious
drug abuse problems over the
past 10 years. Comparing the
years 1968-70 and 1973-75, he
found a large increase in
alcohol-related drug abuse.
"The problem is probably con
tinuing," he said.
Assessment difficult
Dorman cited the difficulty

involved in accurately asses
sing alcohol abuse. Among
these were a reluctance to
admit to an alcohol problem;
the fact that wealthier students
can go to private physicians;
and the difficulty in determin
ing when an accident or injury
was really caused by alcohol
(Monday morning sprained
ankles).
Nonetheless, an increase in
alcohol abuse was evident.
Dorman said this is caused by a
combination of many things,
including "a wariness of the il
legality of other drugs." His
concern is not that alcohol will
lead to other drugs, but rather
that persons will change from
drinking to be social to drink
ing to achieve the "altered
state."
Many of the cases Dorman

has dealt with have involved
people who drink regularly
and heavily — what he calls
"the six-pack-a-day syndrome"
— yet don't consider them
selves to be in trouble. This
kind of drinking c an cause liver
abnormalities and can lead to
continued heavy drinking in
later life.
Alcohol poisoning
Another case that Cowell
often handles is alcohol
poisoning, which results from
drinking large quantities of
hard liquor in a short amount
of time. This is a seasonal prob
lem tending to occur around
the time of fraternity rushes
and initiations, Dorman said,
but added that "usually the
people who do this are not the
chronic offenders."
Treatment of alcohol abuse
varies with the level of the
abuse problem. Counseling is
often encouraged, in which

case the patient is likely to
meet Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, a
psychiatrist working with
Cowell.
"Mostly, what I do is help pa
tients make a plan," he
explained. This may involve
medical analysis, conscious
ness raising or referrals to Al
coholics Anonymous.
A disease
Alcoholism is not heavy
drinking, D'Andrea stressed.
The difference, he said, is that
"alcoholism is a disease. It's a
physical addiction with with
drawal symptoms.
"Now, there's a lot of people
who drink to be social, and a
lot who drink to get wasted —
these are the ones you hear
about," he said. "When they
come to Stanford they get in
troduced to alcohol, and find
themselves liking it."
According to D'Andrea, all
the various types of alcohol
abusers have one thing in
common: "No realization . . .
no awareness of what they're
doing. Some people drink for
psychological reasons. They
begin treating all their tensions
with alcohol." Others,
D'Andrea said, find that they
have a particularly high toler
ance because their bodies
metabolize alcohol differently.
Dependent
'•'They think that's really
neat, so they drink a lot and
more often, until they're de
pendent," D'Andrea
explained. "After years of so
cial drinking the liver gradually
becomes affected, and it be
comes a medical problem." He
points out that there were
"serious alcohol poisonings
last year, and serious accidents
caused by drunkenness."
Compared to drugs, "the
drinking has a lot more visabil
ity," D'Andrea said. "It'spublic
knowledge that the frats spend
an awful lot of money on
spirits," he explained.
Most houses, in fact, spend a
good proportion of their dues
on liquor. For this reason
D'Andrea is working on a

campus-wide consciousness
raising program with help from
the Residential Education Of
fice.
Social activities
Supton said, "one of the
things we are concerned with
are social activities accom
panied by alcoholic beverages.
Our interest is that people be
have responsibly, that they
know the possible effect of al
cohol on themselves and the
effect their behavior has on the
people they live with. I think
some people have to learn
their capacity."
In an effort to make students
more aware of the problems
that heavy drinking can cause,
the REO is encouraging resi
dent fellows and house as
sociates (RAs) to raise these is
sues in each house and to en
courage non-alcoholic altern
tives at parties and house func
tions.
Said Supton, "We're not
coming on puritanical; we just
want people to be able to make
informed choices. There are

always peer pressures." And
by encouraging alternative ac
tivities, there is a hope that
these pressures will be les
sened.
Fun without liquor
Dorman, too, believes that
fun doesn't have to include
liquor and points to football
games to support this idea.
Outlawing liquor at the
stadium has seemed to reduce
the occurrences of heat prost
ration, a common effect of al
cohol over-consumption com
bined with overexposure to
the sun, Dorman said.
But one bad side effect of
this rule, explained Dorman, is
the frequent tendency of gate
guards to tell spectators to
"drink it now because you
can't bring it in," a dangerously
self-destructive practice.
"In meetings with other
schools, alcohol has been com
ing up as a topic on its own,"
said Dean of Student Affairs
lames Lyons. He expressed a
concern over the "excessive
amounts of alcohol consumed
at social events in the last few

years and cited such new
events as the "Mega-nooners"
and "Splendor on the Crass."
However, he pointed out that
there is "a difference between
use and abuse. Because there's
a rise in one, we can't assume
there's a rise in the other.
Abuse might be up — we don't
really know."
Lyons said a "fairly extensive
survey" is being planned
which will "get feedback on
the adequacy of student health
services, and measure student
needs in certain areas."
When asked about
D'Andrea's upcoming
consciousness-raising prog
ram, Lyons brought up some
interesting problems. "The
program," he said, "operates
on two assumptions that may
or may not work: one —
people will pay attention to in
formation if it is made available
to them; two — assuming
people pay attention, they will
change their behavior approp
riately." But, Lyons added, the
1960s showed us that "it takes

more than just the informa
tion" to change people's
habits.
Drugs to alcohol
Lyons suspects that "the
percentage of students who
use mood-altering drugs is
fairly constant, hut has shifted
from other drugs to alcohol."
So the problem that must be
considered, he feels, is not
why students are turning to
drink, but why there is a need
to alter one's mood at all. He
suggests looking into causes of
stress, and means of reducing
that stress, as a basis for reduc
ing alcohol abuse.
"There has been what seems
to be a substantial change in
behavior since the '60s, and
nobody's paid attention to it,"
he said.
There are many unknowns,
then, surrounding alcohol
abuse: why it happens, how it
happens, and who it happens
to. For now, University ad
ministrators hope that by in
forming, they can help al
leviate the problem.

with alcohol." Others,
D'Andrea said, find that they
have a particularly high toler
ance because their bodies
metabolize alcohol differently.
Dependent
'•'They think that's really
neat, so they drink a lot and
more often, until they're de
pendent," D'Andrea
explained. "After years of so
cial drinking the liver gradually
becomes affected, and it be
comes a medical problem." He
points out that there were
"serious alcohol poisonings
last year, and serious accidents
caused by drunkenness."
Compared to drugs, "the
drinking has a lot more visabil
ity," D'Andrea said. "It'spublic
knowledge that the frats spend
an awful lot of money on
spirits," he explained.
Most houses, in fact, spend a
good proportion of their dues
on liquor. For this reason
D'Andrea is working on a

campus-wide consciousness
raising program with help from
the Residential Education Of
fice.
Social activities
Supton said, "one of the
things we are concerned with
are social activities accom
panied by alcoholic beverages.
Our interest is that people be
have responsibly, that they
know the possible effect of al
cohol on themselves and the
effect their behavior has on the
people they live with. I think
some people have to learn
their capacity."
In an effort to make students
more aware of the problems
that heavy drinking can cause,
the REO is encouraging resi
dent fellows and house as
sociates (RAs) to raise these is
sues in each house and to en
courage non-alcoholic altern
tives at parties and house func
tions.
Said Supton, "We're not
coming on puritanical; we just
want people to be able to make
informed choices. There are

always peer pressures." And
by encouraging alternative ac
tivities, there is a hope that
these pressures will be les
sened.
Fun without liquor
Dorman, too, believes that
fun doesn't have to include
liquor and points to football
games to support this idea.
Outlawing liquor at the
stadium has seemed to reduce
the occurrences of heat prost
ration, a common effect of al
cohol over-consumption com
bined with overexposure to
the sun, Dorman said.
But one bad side effect of
this rule, explained Dorman, is
the frequent tendency of gate
guards to tell spectators to
"drink it now because you
can't bring it in," a dangerously
self-destructive practice.
"In meetings with other
schools, alcohol has been com
ing up as a topic on its own,"
said Dean of Student Affairs
lames Lyons. He expressed a
concern over the "excessive
amounts of alcohol consumed
at social events in the last few

years and cited such new
events as the "Mega-nooners"
and "Splendor on the Crass."
However, he pointed out that
there is "a difference between
use and abuse. Because there's
a rise in one, we can't assume
there's a rise in the other.
Abuse might be up — we don't
really know."
Lyons said a "fairly extensive
survey" is being planned
which will "get feedback on
the adequacy of student health
services, and measure student
needs in certain areas."
When asked about
D'Andrea's upcoming
consciousness-raising prog
ram, Lyons brought up some
interesting problems. "The
program," he said, "operates
on two assumptions that may
or may not work: one —
people will pay attention to in
formation if it is made available
to them; two — assuming
people pay attention, they will
change their behavior approp
riately." But, Lyons added, the
1960s showed us that "it takes

more than just the informa
tion" to change people's
habits.
Drugs to alcohol
Lyons suspects that "the
percentage of students who
use mood-altering drugs is
fairly constant, hut has shifted
from other drugs to alcohol."
So the problem that must be
considered, he feels, is not
why students are turning to
drink, but why there is a need
to alter one's mood at all. He
suggests looking into causes of
stress, and means of reducing
that stress, as a basis for reduc
ing alcohol abuse.
"There has been what seems
to be a substantial change in
behavior since the '60s, and
nobody's paid attention to it,"
he said.
There are many unknowns,
then, surrounding alcohol
abuse: why it happens, how it
happens, and who it happens
to. For now, University ad
ministrators hope that by in
forming, they can help al
leviate the problem.


Drinking is a favorite pastime of many students on campus, and
administrators and doc tors have become worried that alcohol abuse

is growing both here and at other colleges. "Teach-ins" to discuss the
dangers of alcohol are being planned by University officials.
Check the appropriate re
sponse: A party without al
cohol is ... (a) a contradiction
in terms, (b) boring, (c) like a
day without orange juice.
If you chose (a) or (b), you
share a common opinion with
the majority of students here.
If you chose (c), you're obvi
ously still recovering from last
weekend's parties.
Drinking is nothing new
here, but the administration's
growing concern over
alcohol-related problems has
raised some difficult ques
tions. Why do people drink?
What are the consequences of
drinking? And what can the
University do to both educate
and treat alcohol abusers?
Alice Supton, assistant dean
of residential education, is one

"Some people drink for psychological
reasons. They begin treating all their
tensions with alcohol
-Dr. Vincent D'Andrea

administrator who has expres
sed concern over increasing
alcohol abuse on campus. Her
worry stems from the large
number of reported drunken
incidents here and at other
schools, from complaints from
nondrinkers and from growing
damage costs to residences
because of "destructive ac
tivities" of some heavy drin
kers.
In an attempt to gauge the
apparent increase in drinking
problems, Dr. )ohn Dorman
analyzed the number of stu
dents admitted to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center for serious
drug abuse problems over the
past 10 years. Comparing the
years 1968-70 and 1973-75, he
found a large increase in
alcohol-related drug abuse.
"The problem is probably con
tinuing," he said.
Assessment difficult
Dorman cited the difficulty

involved in accurately asses
sing alcohol abuse. Among
these were a reluctance to
admit to an alcohol problem;
the fact that wealthier students
can go to private physicians;
and the difficulty in determin
ing when an accident or injury
was really caused by alcohol
(Monday morning sprained
ankles).
Nonetheless, an increase in
alcohol abuse was evident.
Dorman said this is caused by a
combination of many things,
including "a wariness of the il
legality of other drugs." His
concern is not that alcohol will
lead to other drugs, but rather
that persons will change from
drinking to be social to drink
ing to achieve the "altered
state."
Many of the cases Dorman

has dealt with have involved
people who drink regularly
and heavily — what he calls
"the six-pack-a-day syndrome"
— yet don't consider them
selves to be in trouble. This
kind of drinking c an cause liver
abnormalities and can lead to
continued heavy drinking in
later life.
Alcohol poisoning
Another case that Cowell
often handles is alcohol
poisoning, which results from
drinking large quantities of
hard liquor in a short amount
of time. This is a seasonal prob
lem tending to occur around
the time of fraternity rushes
and initiations, Dorman said,
but added that "usually the
people who do this are not the
chronic offenders."
Treatment of alcohol abuse
varies with the level of the
abuse problem. Counseling is
often encouraged, in which

case the patient is likely to
meet Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, a
psychiatrist working with
Cowell.
"Mostly, what I do is help pa
tients make a plan," he
explained. This may involve
medical analysis, conscious
ness raising or referrals to Al
coholics Anonymous.
A disease
Alcoholism is not heavy
drinking, D'Andrea stressed.
The difference, he said, is that
"alcoholism is a disease. It's a
physical addiction with with
drawal symptoms.
"Now, there's a lot of people
who drink to be social, and a
lot who drink to get wasted —
these are the ones you hear
about," he said. "When they
come to Stanford they get in
troduced to alcohol, and find
themselves liking it."
According to D'Andrea, all
the various types of alcohol
abusers have one thing in
common: "No realization . . .
no awareness of what they're
doing. Some people drink for
psychological reasons. They
begin treating all their tensions
with alcohol." Others,
D'Andrea said, find that they
have a particularly high toler
ance because their bodies
metabolize alcohol differently.

'•'They think that's really

suggests looking into causes of
stress, and means of reducing
that stress, as a basis for reduc
ing alcohol abuse.
"There has been what seems
to be a substantial change in
behavior since the '60s, and
nobody's paid attention to it,"
he said.
There are many unknowns,
then, surrounding alcohol
abuse: why it happens, how it
happens, and who it happens
to. For now, University ad
ministrators hope that by in
forming, they can help al
leviate the problem.

is growing both here and at other colleges. "Teach-ins" to discuss the
dangers of alcohol are being planned by University officials.

Drinking is nothing new
here, but the administration's
growing concern over
alcohol-related problems has
raised some difficult ques
tions. Why do people drink?
What are the consequences of
drinking? And what can the
University do to both educate
and treat alcohol abusers?
Alice Supton, assistant dean
of residential education, is one

"Some people drink for psychological
reasons. They begin treating all their
tensions with alcohol
-Dr. Vincent D'Andrea

administrator who has expres
sed concern over increasing
alcohol abuse on campus. Her
worry stems from the large
number of reported drunken
incidents here and at other
schools, from complaints from
nondrinkers and from growing
damage costs to residences
because of "destructive ac
tivities" of some heavy drin
kers.
In an attempt to gauge the
apparent increase in drinking
problems, Dr. )ohn Dorman
analyzed the number of stu
dents admitted to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center for serious
drug abuse problems over the
past 10 years. Comparing the
years 1968-70 and 1973-75, he
found a large increase in
alcohol-related drug abuse.
"The problem is probably con
tinuing," he said.
Assessment difficult
Dorman cited the difficulty

involved in accurately asses
sing alcohol abuse. Among
these were a reluctance to
admit to an alcohol problem;
the fact that wealthier students
can go to private physicians;
and the difficulty in determin
ing when an accident or injury
was really caused by alcohol
(Monday morning sprained
ankles).
Nonetheless, an increase in
alcohol abuse was evident.
Dorman said this is caused by a
combination of many things,
including "a wariness of the il
legality of other drugs." His
concern is not that alcohol will
lead to other drugs, but rather
that persons will change from
drinking to be social to drink
ing to achieve the "altered
state."
Many of the cases Dorman

has dealt with have involved
people who drink regularly
and heavily — what he calls
"the six-pack-a-day syndrome"
— yet don't consider them
selves to be in trouble. This
kind of drinking c an cause liver
abnormalities and can lead to
continued heavy drinking in
later life.
Alcohol poisoning
Another case that Cowell
often handles is alcohol
poisoning, which results from
drinking large quantities of
hard liquor in a short amount
of time. This is a seasonal prob
lem tending to occur around
the time of fraternity rushes
and initiations, Dorman said,
but added that "usually the
people who do this are not the
chronic offenders."
Treatment of alcohol abuse
varies with the level of the
abuse problem. Counseling is
often encouraged, in which

case the patient is likely to
meet Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, a
psychiatrist working with
Cowell.
"Mostly, what I do is help pa
tients make a plan," he
explained. This may involve
medical analysis, conscious
ness raising or referrals to Al
coholics Anonymous.
A disease
Alcoholism is not heavy
drinking, D'Andrea stressed.
The difference, he said, is that
"alcoholism is a disease. It's a
physical addiction with with
drawal symptoms.
"Now, there's a lot of people
who drink to be social, and a
lot who drink to get wasted —
these are the ones you hear
about," he said. "When they
come to Stanford they get in
troduced to alcohol, and find
themselves liking it."
According to D'Andrea, all
the various types of alcohol
abusers have one thing in
common: "No realization . . .
no awareness of what they're
doing. Some people drink for
psychological reasons. They
begin treating all their tensions
with alcohol." Others,
D'Andrea said, find that they
have a particularly high toler
ance because their bodies
metabolize alcohol differently.
Dependent
'•'They think that's really
neat, so they drink a lot and
more often, until they're de
pendent," D'Andrea
explained. "After years of so
cial drinking the liver gradually
becomes affected, and it be
comes a medical problem." He
points out that there were
"serious alcohol poisonings
last year, and serious accidents
caused by drunkenness."
Compared to drugs, "the
drinking has a lot more visabil
ity," D'Andrea said. "It'spublic
knowledge that the frats spend
an awful lot of money on
spirits," he explained.
Most houses, in fact, spend a
good proportion of their dues
on liquor. For this reason
D'Andrea is working on a

campus-wide consciousness
raising program with help from
the Residential Education Of
fice.
Social activities
Supton said, "one of the
things we are concerned with
are social activities accom
panied by alcoholic beverages.
Our interest is that people be
have responsibly, that they
know the possible effect of al
cohol on themselves and the
effect their behavior has on the
people they live with. I think
some people have to learn
their capacity."
In an effort to make students
more aware of the problems
that heavy drinking can cause,
the REO is encouraging resi
dent fellows and house as
sociates (RAs) to raise these is
sues in each house and to en
courage non-alcoholic altern
tives at parties and house func
tions.
Said Supton, "We're not
coming on puritanical; we just
want people to be able to make
informed choices. There are

always peer pressures." And
by encouraging alternative ac
tivities, there is a hope that
these pressures will be les
sened.
Fun without liquor
Dorman, too, believes that
fun doesn't have to include
liquor and points to football
games to support this idea.
Outlawing liquor at the
stadium has seemed to reduce
the occurrences of heat prost
ration, a common effect of al
cohol over-consumption com
bined with overexposure to
the sun, Dorman said.
But one bad side effect of
this rule, explained Dorman, is
the frequent tendency of gate
guards to tell spectators to
"drink it now because you
can't bring it in," a dangerously
self-destructive practice.
"In meetings with other
schools, alcohol has been com
ing up as a topic on its own,"
said Dean of Student Affairs
lames Lyons. He expressed a
concern over the "excessive
amounts of alcohol consumed
at social events in the last few

years and cited such new
events as the "Mega-nooners"
and "Splendor on the Crass."
However, he pointed out that
there is "a difference between
use and abuse. Because there's
a rise in one, we can't assume
there's a rise in the other.
Abuse might be up — we don't
really know."
Lyons said a "fairly extensive
survey" is being planned
which will "get feedback on
the adequacy of student health
services, and measure student
needs in certain areas."
When asked about
D'Andrea's upcoming
consciousness-raising prog
ram, Lyons brought up some
interesting problems. "The
program," he said, "operates
on two assumptions that may
or may not work: one —
people will pay attention to in
formation if it is made available
to them; two — assuming
people pay attention, they will
change their behavior approp
riately." But, Lyons added, the
1960s showed us that "it takes

more than just the informa
tion" to change people's
habits.
Drugs to alcohol
Lyons suspects that "the
percentage of students who
use mood-altering drugs is
fairly constant, hut has shifted
from other drugs to alcohol."
So the problem that must be
considered, he feels, is not
why students are turning to
drink, but why there is a need
to alter one's mood at all. He
suggests looking into causes of
stress, and means of reducing
that stress, as a basis for reduc
ing alcohol abuse.
"There has been what seems
to be a substantial change in
behavior since the '60s, and
nobody's paid attention to it,"
he said.
There are many unknowns,
then, surrounding alcohol
abuse: why it happens, how it
happens, and who it happens
to. For now, University ad
ministrators hope that by in
forming, they can help al
leviate the problem.
