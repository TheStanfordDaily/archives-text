# College guide books vary on opinions of life here

Remember those fat catalogs
filled with glorious information
about every college campus (or
at least the major ones) in the
United States? Remember how
you pored over them in search
of the college that was "right
for you?"
Now that you're a Stanford
student, complete with ID and
meal card, take a look at what
some of those infamous col
lege guides have to say about
"The Farm."
Although it enjoys a "good
academic" reputation, Stan
ford has acquired several other
reputations, according to
those guides. The Insider's
Guide to the Colleges, com
piled and edited by the Yale
Daily News, reported: "Intel
lectual, political and cultural
activities (at Stanford) take a
back seat to volleyball."
Meanwhile, The Under
ground Guide to the College of
your Choice said: "Stanford is
a campus of concerned intel
lectuals." This guide was pub
lished in 1971 by staff members
"who live, learn and work in
Berkeley."
The study habits of students
here are frequently mentioned
in these catalogs. The Insider's
Guide said "There are a huge
number of students who only
care about getting good grades
. . . and another equally large
percentage who aren't in
terested in doing anything."
But Tom Pratt, a junior
psychology and communica
tion major here, disagreed.
"The atmosphere here is re

ally relaxed. There's not as
much cutthroat competition
and that could be mistaken for
intellectual laziness."
Baron's Profiles of American
Colleges gave a somewhat dif
ferent picture. "After spending
some time at the University,
students usually find them
selves primarily interested in
their studies, close interper
sonal relationships and dor
mitory social life."
Helen Hayase, a junior and a
residential adviser for a
freshman dorm, agreed with
this statement.
"Those three things are
pretty important, especially
freshman year," she said.
Steve Westbrook, a
freshman and band member,
added, "What else is there? I
mean that's life."
But the preoccupation with
studies is greater here than
"close interpersonal rela
tions," according to The Un
derground Guide. "The rumor
is that Stanford men don't
date, they study," the book
stated.
Hayase added that dating
does occur, but seems to be
"more group oriented." Gen
erally, students interviewed
agreed that while "formal" dat
ing was rare, "informal" dating
happened "all the time" and
was generally "spontaneous."
Perhaps the most controver
sial issue raised by these
guides appeared in The In
sider's Cuide. "Perhaps the
worst thing we can say about
Stanford is that it is boring,"
the book stated.

Students interviewed disag
reed, citing diversity as the
main argument.
"Anything and everything
you want to do, you can find
here," Westbrook said. "Fri
days and Saturdays, even
Mondays and Tuesdays, if you
want to find something to do
there is something."
Pratt called the idea that
Stanford is boring "absurd."
He said he was "amazed" at
students' ability to go out and
explore opportunities.
Hayase, noting that the Yale
Daily News edited the book,
said her two brothers went to
Yale and "disliked it. They
thought Yale was boring." But,
she added, "Yale people tend
to think of Stanford as a party
school."
Eric Dyce, a freshman from
Puerto Rico, hit it on the head.
"Boring in comparison to
what?" he asked.
Bob Beyers, director of Uni
versity News and Publications,
called the college rating system
a "big phony game."
"As far as I know, there is no
good rating system. Nor is
there likely to be, because
there are so many colleges,"
he said.
However, the staff of The
Underground Guide wrote in
their introduction to the book:
"This is the whole truth and no
thing but the truth, but once
you get to college — don't be
lieve everything you read."
Once you get to high school
and start researching colleges,
don't believe everything you
read.

Steve Westbrook, a
freshman and band member,
added, "What else is there? I
mean that's life."
But the preoccupation with
studies is greater here than
"close interpersonal rela
tions," according to The Un
derground Guide. "The rumor
is that Stanford men don't
date, they study," the book
stated.
Hayase added that dating
does occur, but seems to be
"more group oriented." Gen
erally, students interviewed
agreed that while "formal" dat
ing was rare, "informal" dating
happened "all the time" and
was generally "spontaneous."
Perhaps the most controver
sial issue raised by these
guides appeared in The In
sider's Cuide. "Perhaps the
worst thing we can say about
Stanford is that it is boring,"
the book stated.

Students interviewed disag
reed, citing diversity as the
main argument.
"Anything and everything
you want to do, you can find
here," Westbrook said. "Fri
days and Saturdays, even
Mondays and Tuesdays, if you
want to find something to do
there is something."
Pratt called the idea that
Stanford is boring "absurd."
He said he was "amazed" at
students' ability to go out and
explore opportunities.
Hayase, noting that the Yale
Daily News edited the book,
said her two brothers went to
Yale and "disliked it. They
thought Yale was boring." But,
she added, "Yale people tend
to think of Stanford as a party
school."
Eric Dyce, a freshman from
Puerto Rico, hit it on the head.
"Boring in comparison to
what?" he asked.
Bob Beyers, director of Uni
versity News and Publications,
called the college rating system
a "big phony game."
"As far as I know, there is no
good rating system. Nor is
there likely to be, because
there are so many colleges,"
he said.
However, the staff of The
Underground Guide wrote in
their introduction to the book:
"This is the whole truth and no
thing but the truth, but once
you get to college — don't be
lieve everything you read."
Once you get to high school
and start researching colleges,
don't believe everything you
read.
Remember those fat catalogs
filled with glorious information
about every college campus (or
at least the major ones) in the
United States? Remember how
you pored over them in search
of the college that was "right
for you?"
Now that you're a Stanford
student, complete with ID and
meal card, take a look at what
some of those infamous col
lege guides have to say about
"The Farm."
Although it enjoys a "good
academic" reputation, Stan
ford has acquired several other
reputations, according to
those guides. The Insider's
Guide to the Colleges, com
piled and edited by the Yale
Daily News, reported: "Intel
lectual, political and cultural
activities (at Stanford) take a
back seat to volleyball."
Meanwhile, The Under
ground Guide to the College of
your Choice said: "Stanford is
a campus of concerned intel
lectuals." This guide was pub
lished in 1971 by staff members
"who live, learn and work in
Berkeley."
The study habits of students
here are frequently mentioned
in these catalogs. The Insider's
Guide said "There are a huge
number of students who only
care about getting good grades
. . . and another equally large
percentage who aren't in
terested in doing anything."
But Tom Pratt, a junior
psychology and communica
tion major here, disagreed.
"The atmosphere here is re

ally relaxed. There's not as
much cutthroat competition
and that could be mistaken for
intellectual laziness."
Baron's Profiles of American
Colleges gave a somewhat dif
ferent picture. "After spending
some time at the University,
students usually find them
selves primarily interested in
their studies, close interper
sonal relationships and dor
mitory social life."
Helen Hayase, a junior and a
residential adviser for a
freshman dorm, agreed with
this statement.
"Those three things are
pretty important, especially
freshman year," she said.
Steve Westbrook, a
freshman and band member,
added, "What else is there? I
mean that's life."
But the preoccupation with
studies is greater here than

tions," according to The Un
