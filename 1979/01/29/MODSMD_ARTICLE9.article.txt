# Unwed teen abandons baby
## Soviets ambivalent on moral issue 
### 
Moscow (AP) â€” On an icy New Year's
Day, Lara, an unwed teen-age mother,
stood in the corridor of apartment build
ing No. 25, weeping as she clutched her
10-day-old son close to her.
Suddenly, the infant's father grabbed
the bundle and placed it at the doorway of
a stranger's apartment and the couple ran
away.
The case of the abandoned baby at
building No. 25 drew outraged comment
in a Soviet newspaper Wednesday, which
railed at the parents' cruelty, the callous
ness of school and city advisers, and the
fact that such a crime could happen in the
Soviet Union.
Candid
But the extraordinarily candid article in
Komsomolskaya Pravda also showed how
little help is available to troubled young
people here, especially when they violate
standards of morality.
The parents ultimately were found and
brought to trial. But, the newspaper said, a
sympathetic judge acquitted them of crim
inal wrongdoing after hearing the facts.

Now the two teenagers are married and
Lara is taking care of her son while Mitya
has been drafted into the Soviet army.
According to the article, Lara found out
she was pregnant two months before
graduating from the middle school in the
small town where she lived with her pa
rents. She and Mitya were planning to
enter technical school in a nearby city next
fall.
Marriageable age
Because they were younger than the
marriageable age of 18, the teenagers
could only live together. Afraid to tell their
parents about the coming child, they
moved to the city.
During a medical exam needed for en
rolling at the technical school, Lara broke
down and revealed everything to the doc
tor's assistant, who notified school au
thorities about her pregnancy.
"The director of the technical school
shrugged his shoulders. The girl has de
cided to become a mother, he said, then
she should know what to do," the news
paper reported. "But imagine yourself in
the place of these two teenagers, who

found themselves in a strange city and in
such a complicated situation."
Leave or write
The director contacted the city's com
mission on teen-agers which gave the
couple two choices: either Lara left
school, or the director would have to
"write the truth" to her parents. She left
school.
The teen-agers were threatened with
expulsion from their apartment because
they had trouble paying the rent and the
landlord warned that he would not toler
ate "even a minute" of a baby's crying.
After Lara had her son, the couple was
supposed to go home for Mitya's school
vacation, but they were afraid to take the
baby.
"At a critical moment at the entrance to
building No. 25, Lara started to cry.
'Untypical'
"It's an untypical case," the newspaper
concluded. "But even Lara's and Mitya's
cruelty is nothing compared to the cold
viciousnessof those responsible for advis
ing the young couple."
