The Inflatable Doll Story
There were once these 2 guys who wanted to
play a practical |oke on one of their friends who
was kind ol a dumb sort of fellow They threw a
party for a bunch of people and went out and
bought an inflatable doll of a woman, blew it up
and put it in a bed in one of the bedrooms They
went up to their friend, during Ihe party, and
whispered. Hey there s this cute chick ,n bed in
that room and she s hot to go Their friend said
that sounded good to him and went into the room
Every one listened at the door, but couldn t hear
anything
Finally he came out with a blank look on his
lace One of his friends went up and asked him
how it went in there He said, It was real weird I
went in there, got into bed. bit her on the neck,
and she larted and flew out the window
