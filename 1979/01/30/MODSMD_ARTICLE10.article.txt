## Proposed amendment inadequate 
### 
A new public mentality cur
rently dominates the national
financial scene. This ideology
derives from two contradictory
realities: (1) that the public
demands "welfare-state" gov
ernment services and benefits
(such as social security and un
employment compensation),
but (2) that it nevertheless re
jects the prominent means of
implementing and funding
these services (bureaucratic al
location), because it detects
misuse of public funds and in
efficient administration.
Last week Governor Brown
played off" the fiscally con
servative side of this coin when
he proposed his amendment
to the United States Constitu
tion prohibiting Federal
budget deficits. Now that
Brown dreams about residing
on Pennsylvania Avenue, he

begins to assume a "Jarvis"-
like national stance. He tries to
become nationally visible by
calling for a national Constitu
tional convention.
Brown's publicly
acknowledged "lesson" from
Proposition 13 was really no
more than a political warning:
"heed the public mandate lest
they not you inaugurate." With
the knowledge that 22 states
have already proposed a con
stitutional amendment similar
to his, and the memory of
Proposition 13's overwhelming
victory still fresh, Brown
realizes that he has discovered
a potential political gold mine.
The people want limitations on
government spending, and
they will not hesitate to resort
to revenue-slashing measures
to get «hem.
Yet Brown's proposal for an
amendment requiring a ba
lanced federal budget has sev
eral drawbacks. On further
examination, it proves to be in
appropriate, unnecessary, and
unfeasible.
First, the proposed amend
ment would contain no provi
sion indicating from what
source other monies could be
generated so as to replace the
revenue losses sustained by
the absence of the deficit. The
country has grown dependent
on the multi-billion dollar an
nual influx of extra money pro
vided by the deficit. It could
not withstand the strain on its
economy if this money flow
was halted.
Because an alternative
source of funding is un
specified in Brown's plan, the
choice would rest with the
bureaucracy as to which prog
rams would be cut. And do not
doubt that bureaucrats will not
hesitate to slash essential ser
vices. They will not eliminate
the excessive and unnecessary
bureaucratic "fat" the public
believes causes the deficit.
Which programs will take
the first cuts? Social services or
defense? The public will stand
for neither.

After all, what bureaucrat
would risk losing his job?
Bureaucrats dependent upon
the revenues generated by the
deficit will surely not formulate
policy designed to phase out
their unneeded departments.
Rather, they will propose — if
they feel the people can
stomach if — an increase in in
come and social security taxes.
Second, this amendment
would severely cripple the
freedom of the President to
choose his own economic pol
icy by pre-determining and
limiting his options. It would
institutionalize fiscal conser
vatism, and limit the
election-time choices between
candidates for high offices.
During a national campaign,
fhe voters are made aware of a
candidate's economic orienta
tion: whether the candidate is
liberal or conservative assists
the voter in his or her evalua
tion and choice. Limiting the
candidate, once elected, to a
policy of conservatism — even
in just the area of deficit spend
ing — will further blur the al
ready indistinct ideological dif
ferences between national
candidates that assist the
American voter in choosing the
best person.
Third, how can it ever be
feasible for the national gov
ernment to be able to make ac
curate enough predictions so
as to assure that the nation's
accounts will always be in the
black? Since 1970, four Presi
dents (even after extensive
consultation with economic
experts) have consistently
erred in their annual forecasts
by at least the margin of $IVi
billion per year. Occasionally
this difference has risen to $20
billion! Further, even were
the President or Congress con
stitutionally bestowed the right
to waive these limitations on
the deficit in times of "national
emergency," such a right
would render the amendment
meaningless. It a President
possesses the discretion to
forego the Constitution
whenever he deems fit, the in

tegrity and significance of the
document is lost.
Finally, passing an amend
ment proscribing deficits
would render the Supreme
Court the ultimate framer of
ernnnmir policy. A budgetary
limitation, if adopted in the
form oi an amendment, would
subject the President to
economic jurisdiction by the
Supreme Court. Economic
policies would have to meet
the test of judicial review, and
thus would have to be deter
mined by the mandate of con
stitutional precedent. And
were the amendment to in
clude a provision for the sus
pension of the deficit ban in
the case of a "national
emergency," the courts will
become hopelessly entangled
in attempting to define the
term "national emergency."
What if the Court should de
clare a certain economic policy
unconstitutional during a de
signated "national
emergency?" Would the Un
ited States government be ob
liged to immediately revise its
operating budget in order to
meet the demands of the
judiciary? And what sanctions
would be applied to the Presi
dent and Congress if, even
with the best planning, they
failed to avoid a deficit? The
consequent confusions boggle
the mind.
Brown's advocacy of a fis
cally conservative doctrine
should well assist him in his fu
ture national election plans.
After all, adopting a popular
platform in order to win an
election is the essence of
American politics. However,
when Brown endeavors to
amend the Constitution in
order to meet his needs for na
tional publicity, then he should
be held re
sponsible for an abuse of influ
ence.

First, the proposed amend
ment would contain no provi
sion indicating from what
source other monies could be
generated so as to replace the
revenue losses sustained by
the absence of the deficit. The
country has grown dependent
on the multi-billion dollar an
nual influx of extra money pro
vided by the deficit. It could
not withstand the strain on its
economy if this money flow
was halted.
Because an alternative
source of funding is un
specified in Brown's plan, the
choice would rest with the
bureaucracy as to which prog
rams would be cut. And do not
doubt that bureaucrats will not
hesitate to slash essential ser
vices. They will not eliminate
the excessive and unnecessary
bureaucratic "fat" the public
believes causes the deficit.
Which programs will take
the first cuts? Social services or
defense? The public will stand
for neither.

After all, what bureaucrat
would risk losing his job?
Bureaucrats dependent upon
the revenues generated by the
deficit will surely not formulate
policy designed to phase out
their unneeded departments.
Rather, they will propose — if
they feel the people can
stomach if — an increase in in
come and social security taxes.
Second, this amendment
would severely cripple the
freedom of the President to
choose his own economic pol
icy by pre-determining and
limiting his options. It would
institutionalize fiscal conser
vatism, and limit the
election-time choices between
candidates for high offices.
During a national campaign,
fhe voters are made aware of a
candidate's economic orienta
tion: whether the candidate is
liberal or conservative assists
the voter in his or her evalua
tion and choice. Limiting the
candidate, once elected, to a
policy of conservatism — even
in just the area of deficit spend
ing — will further blur the al
ready indistinct ideological dif
ferences between national
candidates that assist the
American voter in choosing the
best person.
Third, how can it ever be
feasible for the national gov
ernment to be able to make ac
curate enough predictions so
as to assure that the nation's
accounts will always be in the
black? Since 1970, four Presi
dents (even after extensive
consultation with economic
experts) have consistently
erred in their annual forecasts
by at least the margin of $IVi
billion per year. Occasionally
this difference has risen to $20
billion! Further, even were
the President or Congress con
stitutionally bestowed the right
to waive these limitations on
the deficit in times of "national
emergency," such a right
would render the amendment
meaningless. It a President
possesses the discretion to
forego the Constitution
whenever he deems fit, the in

tegrity and significance of the
document is lost.
Finally, passing an amend
ment proscribing deficits
would render the Supreme
Court the ultimate framer of
ernnnmir policy. A budgetary
limitation, if adopted in the
form oi an amendment, would
subject the President to
economic jurisdiction by the
Supreme Court. Economic
policies would have to meet
the test of judicial review, and
thus would have to be deter
mined by the mandate of con
stitutional precedent. And
were the amendment to in
clude a provision for the sus
pension of the deficit ban in
the case of a "national
emergency," the courts will
become hopelessly entangled
in attempting to define the
term "national emergency."
What if the Court should de
clare a certain economic policy
unconstitutional during a de
signated "national
emergency?" Would the Un
ited States government be ob
liged to immediately revise its
operating budget in order to
meet the demands of the
judiciary? And what sanctions
would be applied to the Presi
dent and Congress if, even
with the best planning, they
failed to avoid a deficit? The
consequent confusions boggle
the mind.
Brown's advocacy of a fis
cally conservative doctrine
should well assist him in his fu
ture national election plans.
After all, adopting a popular
platform in order to win an
election is the essence of
American politics. However,
when Brown endeavors to
amend the Constitution in
order to meet his needs for na
tional publicity, then he should
be held re
sponsible for an abuse of influ
ence.

A new public mentality cur
rently dominates the national
financial scene. This ideology
derives from two contradictory
realities: (1) that the public
demands "welfare-state" gov
ernment services and benefits
(such as social security and un
employment compensation),
but (2) that it nevertheless re
jects the prominent means of
implementing and funding
these services (bureaucratic al
location), because it detects
misuse of public funds and in
efficient administration.
Last week Governor Brown
played off" the fiscally con
servative side of this coin when
he proposed his amendment
to the United States Constitu

budget deficits. Now that

become nationally visible by
calling for a national Constitu

Brown's publicly

Proposition 13's overwhelming

realizes that he has discovered
