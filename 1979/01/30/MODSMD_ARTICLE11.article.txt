Bandow challenged
Readprs of the Daily have
once again been subjected to a
rambling harangue on the
topic of "taxation is theft," this
time in the column by Doug
Bandow (Daily, )an. 25). I am
disappointed that neither Ban
dow nor any other Daily col
umnists who have written on
this subject have advanced de
finitive proposals on how this
society should be restruc
tured, in conformance with
their philosophy.
The "taxation is theft" idea is
an essential part of libertarian
philosophy, which basically
calls fora revolutionary change
in our society. Revolution, in
itself, is not evil; such judg
ment must be based on the re
sults. I would like to play the
role of devil's advocate and
challenge Bandow or anyone
else to describe the sorts of
changes that they would like to
see in ourgovernment and soc
iety.
In particular, I would like to
know how a libertarian system
will provide citizens with the
following: national defense;
consumer protection; roads;
police and fire protection;
schools; aid for the disabled. I
use the word "system" here in
the broadest possible sense,
not to mean a specific cen
tralized government.
Libertarianism remains to
me a pie-in-the-sky

philosophy, but a reasoned
reply to this letter could cer
tainly change my opinion. I am
anxious to read such a reply

Research planned
A Daily reporter asserted in a
front page article {Daily, Jan.
19) that "no research is plan
ned at the University
here. . . I wish the Daily staf
fers did their research a bit
more thoroughly before issu
ing sweeping statements like
that.
At the Radio Astronomy In
stitute we certainly are plan
ning to observe the eclipse
using our 5-element 10.7 GHz
telescope. This array of anten
nas has high instantaneous re
solution in the East-West direc
tion, and to get good North-
South resolution normally
takes eight to 10 hours of ob
servation making use of the
earth's rotation. But during the
eclipse, the moon can provide
the North-South resolution
because it covers up succes
sive parts of (he sun's disk in a
relatively short time. Thus,
even a varying feature — such
as an active region — can be
mapped in two dimensions.
High resolution limb brighten
ing observations are also pos
sible using the moon's edge as
it covers (or uncovers) the
sun's limb. The research at

SRAI is funded under grants
from the National Science
Foundation.

Editor's note: When the re
porter spoke with the secretary
to the chairman of the As
tronomy Department and with
an astronomy graduate stu
dent, they said they had no
knowledge of solar research
being conducted at the Univer
sity. The reporter regrets the
error of not fully investigating
all departments of the Univer
sity connected with astronomi
cal research.
White ethnics
Why does Richard Wohl
complain about Chicano and
black theme houses?
I look around the campus
and note at least 23 white
ethnic theme houses, not to
mention the frats and row
houses.
