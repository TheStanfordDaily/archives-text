# Big Brothers provide adult companionship
## 
### Karen Eustis 
Men, who taught you to throw a
football or swing a baseball bat? Who
was it that first explained those puzzl
ing differences between boysand girls?
Chances are it was either Dad or an
older brother. But for some fatherless
boys, this adult male companionship
was provided by a Big Brother.
Big Brothers of the Peninsula, Inc., is
a non-profit, privately funded agency
composed of professionals and volun
teers. "It is a preventive program that
helps fatherless boys in their personal
and social growth through a long-term
relationship with a volunteer man," so
cial worker )im Gorman explained.
"Often a fatherless boy's contact is
almost entirely with women: his
mother, sisters and teachers in school.
The mother finds out that there are
things the boy is missing out on, like
learning to kick a football or swing a
bat," Gorman said. "Especially with an
older boy, when he starts asking ques
tions about sex, the mother wants him
to have someone to talk to," he said.
The Little Brothers are between 6 and
14 years old and are interviewed before
being accepted to the program. "The
boy has to be ready for it," Gorman
said. "If the boy has severe problems,
we don't take him. Big Brothers are not
a panacea.
"Some of the kids are model stu
dents, others are starting to act out.
Some are in counseling," Gorman said.
"But on the whole, they're fairly nor

mal, well-adjusted kids.
"Basically, anyone over 18, married
or single, is eligible to be a Big
Brother," Gorman said. "There are no
special qualifications, just that you can
relate to kids. We're not looking for
saints or child psychologists, just aver
age type guys," he said.
The application process usually takes
about a month, Gorman said. In addi
tion to the usual informational material,
three personal references and an inter
view are required.
The hobbies, interests and personal
characteristics of the Big Brothers are
matched to a Little Brother by a social
worker. "We show the prospective Big
Brother the Little Brother's picture and
tell him the pertinent information,"
Gorman said. "There's no rush in mak
ing a decision. The Big Brother can take
his time."
Big Brothers are discouraged from
planning weekly special events for their
Little Brothers. "We encourage them to
include their Little Brother in their
weekly routine, whether it's going to a
football game, washing their car, fixing
their bike or going shopping," Gorman
said.
During the first year the Big Brother is
expected to spend at least 12 hours a
month with his Little Brother. The
Peninsula agency also provides
monthly activities for the Big and Little
Brothers. Monthly meetings with vete
ran Big Brothers provide support and
advice for the new Big Brothers.

"After two months the honeymoon is
over and most Big Brothers are wonder
ing, 'what do I do with this kid?' " Gor
man said. "The veterans say relax and
do whatever happens."
Being a Big Brother is not always easy
and immediately rewarding, Gorman
said. "It's important to keep an open
mind. In the beginning don't expect
too much from the Little Brother."
The depth of the relationship varies,
Gorman added. "Sometimes it remains
shallow, other times the Little Brother
spills his guts the first time he sees his
Big Brother."
John Lamb, a sophomore, has been a
Big Brother since September. "I
thought it would be a neat thing to do,
Lamb said. "Some of my friends don't
have dads. You see things they do, and
you know they wouldn't do them if they
had an older male model.
"We play football and basketball, and
Drew Norris (Lamb's Little Brother, age
8) had dinner with me at Roble," Lamb
said. "You can really do anything and
include him in it — even things like
watching you shave, things he normally
doesn't see."
Lamb emphasized that it takes time to
develop a close relationship. "You re
ally can't expect big changes in the kid
overnight," he said. "Don't expect him
to come to you right away, but don't get
discouraged. You really are helping the
guy out."
Being a Big Brother is rewarding,
Lamb said. "I feel good about helping

him out. When a Little Brother says Big
Brothers are great, it makes you feel
great!"
Richard Schupbach, assoc. Prot. of
Slavic languages, described Alex )ones,
his Little Brother for four years as "a
IJ-year-old kid with Battlestar Calactica
and girls on his mind.
"Being a Big Brother involves an
energy commitment and shifting
gears," Schupbach said. "It sort of dis
rupts your rhythm, disrupts what you
do. But the best thing I've gotten out of
it was having my life disrupted and get
ting out of my rut," he said.
Schupbach described his relation
ship with Jones as "not very Big
Brotherish. He's more like a nephew.
We've kind of been absorbed into his
family and he into ours. Alex has dinner
with us. He babysits tor us. We've gone
fishing and hiking in the Sierras and
cross-country skiing," he said.
Schupbach had had no previous ex
perience with children. "I can't plan
something to amuse a kid,'' he said.
"So I take him along on things I do.
"Alex and I have alwa\ gotten along
well," Schupbach said t\e always
been able to talk to him
The relationship has been very re
warding, Schupbach said Its likt> dis
covering another human being from
another planet. What the hell can a man
born in 1940 expect to know about
people born in 1964?''
Being a Big Brother is a good way to
find out.
