## rock/ron lillejord Swagger and brashness 
### 
Greg Kihn is a good-time
rocker, and happily, those
kinds of people are starting to
get less hard to find. Kihn
probably doesn't fit in the
latest "future of rock" theory,
but in his show at the Keystone
in Palo Alto last Friday, he and
his band proved that a little
swagger and brashness can go
a long way.
Kihn's songs certainly aren't
weighty, but he's got a boyish
charm hardened by a cool
toughness that's enough to
make his stuff work, and work
well. Playing with a controlled
intensity that immediately
picked the crowd up (after
being mostly indifferent to the
opening act, )ules and the
Polar Bears), Kihn opened with
"Mystic Eyes," which rushed
quickly into Buddy Holly's
"Love's Made a Fool of You."
The ballad "Remember" off
his latest album, Next of Kihn,
followed and he shifted easily
back into straight rock with a
strong version of the Bruce
Springsteen song "Rendezv
ous," one of the many late '60s
English pop songs that Bruce
has written but never released.
Kihn finished his short first
set with an energized
"Chinatown," feigning to
smash his guitar at the end.

Atter a long break, kihn and
band reappeared and made
good on their promise to rock
the place with a powerful sec
ond set that, including en
cores, lasted tor nearly two
hours.
With guitarist Dave Car
penter blowing out outstand
ing guitar work throughout,
Kihn exploded through "Hurt
So Bad"; "All the Right
Reasons" came later, and the
regular portion ot the set

finished in appropriately de
structive fashion with "Secret
Meetings" and "Museum."
The show ended with Lou
Reed's "Sweet Jane," a song
that put a cap on the evening
with its tale of a girl who used
to listen to "disco bullshit"
(spontaneous lyrics added by
kihn) but who is "saved by rock
and roll" in the end.
Now this is usually the place
where critics complain about
all the junk on AM radio and
make some outlandish state
ment about how certain they
are that such-and-such act
simply has to be a smash — that
pretty soon, they'll "make it."
Well. Co see the Greg Kihn
Band before they make it, be
fore they get too much press,
or, alternatively, before they
fade into oblivion, since in the
crazed rock megabusiness,
being talented doesn't neces
sarily lead to success and leads
even less often to happiness.
After the show, someone in
the crowd put this uncertainty
simply, saying "you know, this
guy is starting to get foo good."
Exactly.
(The Creg Kihn Band will play
the Old Waldorf in San Fran
cisco this Friday and Saturday at
8 and 11 p.m. Tickets are avail
able at all BASS outlets.)
