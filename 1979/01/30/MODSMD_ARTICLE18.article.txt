## That kind of show

Stop Diablo Canyon; No More Nuclear Power; Jackson
Browne and Graham Nash, short talk by Dr. Helen Caldicott. In
Support of the Abalone Alliance. Oakland Coliseum, January
27, 7979.
First things first. One of these days somebody will issue a
major statement on the subject of benefit concerts, and on
drugs and sex and rock and roll. The relationship there
between. The differences between mine workers and the
upper middle class adolescent; the need to excite and the
need to inform and the problems with doing both; when and
how to criticize people who work all night lor free. How you
relate "I am a Simple Man" to third-level leakage possibilities;
whether and why you would hate Jackson Browne's music if he
sang at a pro-life rally.
But to the point. Not tonight. The issue can be almost wholly
avoided by virtue of the nature of Browne's performance, and
occasionally by the nature of Nash's performance as well.
Nash, it appeared, had trouble distinguishing between his
bad songs and his good ones — it meant that on occasion he
sang some very strange things (something something some
thing/ "magical baby we made with our souls").
But he does sing beautifully, and he does harmonize beauti
fully, and he has written much that allows him to show his
strengths. And he did, sporadically, unless he was singingwith
Browne — at those times he was exceptionally good and ex
ceptionally effective. They sang together three or four times
with particular success — to open the show, and after Nash's
set, and during a few of the encores (Browne stopped at one
point to tell us how much easier it was to get things done with
Nash around — "when you sing you just hold still and he does
all the work").
And Browne played a stomper; We screamed and waved our
arms; woe unto those poor dumb fools who denigrate his
music. ("The Fuse," "Fountain of Sorrow," ' Here Come
Those Tears Again," "Song for Adam," "Running on Empty,"
"Pretender," "Doctor My Eyes." Also "The Load Out," with
out a doubt among the finest encores ever in history.)

And in concert, on stage, there are few sights as enjoyable as
that of Browne and his band — few performers enjoy them
selves as much as Browne and his band. Take David Lindley for
instance, apparently capable of playing anything with strings,
and imagine him sitting in the middle oi the stage playing
maniac riffs on a guitar (a slide guitar; its sitting in his lap; he
wears a Mickey Mouse T-shirt).
Imagine everyone else on stage contorting and twisting and
jumping up and down, and try to picture Lindley at the center
of it all moving little more than his fingers. And Jackson
Browne is laughing as he plays, and trying to get him to move,
and Lindley feigns horror and terror and loathing when
Browne gets the spotlight put on him. And all of this while he
plays a solo that takes the roof off the building.
It was that kind of concert, for the most part. Very very good.
Good enough to preclude an attempt at a major statement or
two — perhaps enough to answer those questions in and ot
themselves.
But we'll let that pass.
