## Marceau: exhausting energy 
### 
Two hours have passed and I am exhausted,
yet the man with whom I've been sharing some
very personal emotional feelings is showing no
signs of weariness. In fact, he's bounding across
the stage, scooping up bouquets of flowers and
blowing kisses to me — and the other 2900 per
sons I've been sitting with in the Marin Veterans'
Memorial Auditorium.
The man is Marcel Marceau and his energy
seems as boundless as his talent. Marceau is the
standard by which all other mimes are mea
sured. He is the undisputed master of mimes in
the world and for his current three-month tour
of U.S. cities he has prepared a repertoire of
pantomimes to prove and verify his mastery of
this oldest of theatrical arts.
Marceau is in his mid-50s, and yet he moved
through skit after skit, displaying the vitality and
enthusiasm more akin to the voungest in his
opening pantomime — "The Amusement Park."
He seemed to be drawing from a boundless
source of energy — perhaps he drew from the
audience's.
Energy
Whatever its source, this energy served Mar
ceau well — especially in "The Angel." Mar
ceau's angel was a live'and supple being with a
sensual and mischevious essence missing from
the common Christmas stamp cherub. In its few
moments onstage, the angel manuevered
through storms of sound and light as it made its
way from heaven to earth. Once on earth the
angel fought again — against the beckoning
sensuality of earth and against Cod's call to re
turn to heaven.
"The Angel" pantomime begins with Marceau
slowly revolving onstage to celestial music. He
exhibited such excellent body control that he
appeared to be standing on a part of the stage
that was actually revolving — he gave no indica
tion that any footwork was involved.

A similar exhibition of minescule muscle
movements came in "Youth, Maturity, Old Age
and Death" — my favorite from the evening's
selection. In this pantomime, almost the entire
story came from Marceau's hands. The birth in
the beginning and the death in the end were
represented by the furling and unfurling of Mar
ceau's body, but it was in his expressive hands
that youth was like a flower unfurling — reach
ing toward the sun and reaching out to discover
the extent of its environment. In the end, death
came as one hand dropped and swung loosely.
The essence and strength that life represented
was gone.
lust as Marceau's limitless energy onstage left
me physically drained, even so his pantomiming
of my emotions left me surprised at the depth of
his perceptive abilities. Much of the audience's
emotional identification with Marceau comes
when the master mime brings BIP onstage.
BIP
BIP, Marceau has said, is a character that was
born in the imagination of Marceau's child
hood. BIP provides an emotional handhold for
all of us, as we travel through Marceau's per
formance and through life — both of which may
be exceedingly complex and sometimes convo
luted.
We laugh with recognition through the rest of
Marceau's pantomimes, but in the BIP pan
tomimes, we laugh at ourselves. BlP's fear of
heights as he climbs a very tall ladder in "BIP as a
China Salesman" is our fear too. And BlP's faux
pas in "BIP at a Society Party" are the same ones
we fear that we, too, might some day commit.
Marceau, through his style pantomimes and
through his BIP pantomimes, shows us ourse
lves and our world — without words, but in a
language much more convincing — the lan
guage of oneness. What happens to Marceau
onstage, happens to us in real life.

enthusiasm more akin to the voungest in his
opening pantomime — "The Amusement Park."
He seemed to be drawing from a boundless
source of energy — perhaps he drew from the
audience's.
Energy
Whatever its source, this energy served Mar
ceau well — especially in "The Angel." Mar
ceau's angel was a live'and supple being with a
sensual and mischevious essence missing from
the common Christmas stamp cherub. In its few
moments onstage, the angel manuevered
through storms of sound and light as it made its
way from heaven to earth. Once on earth the
angel fought again — against the beckoning
sensuality of earth and against Cod's call to re
turn to heaven.
"The Angel" pantomime begins with Marceau
slowly revolving onstage to celestial music. He
exhibited such excellent body control that he
appeared to be standing on a part of the stage
that was actually revolving — he gave no indica
tion that any footwork was involved.

A similar exhibition of minescule muscle
movements came in "Youth, Maturity, Old Age
and Death" — my favorite from the evening's
selection. In this pantomime, almost the entire
story came from Marceau's hands. The birth in
the beginning and the death in the end were
represented by the furling and unfurling of Mar
ceau's body, but it was in his expressive hands
that youth was like a flower unfurling — reach
ing toward the sun and reaching out to discover
the extent of its environment. In the end, death
came as one hand dropped and swung loosely.
The essence and strength that life represented
was gone.
lust as Marceau's limitless energy onstage left
me physically drained, even so his pantomiming
of my emotions left me surprised at the depth of
his perceptive abilities. Much of the audience's
emotional identification with Marceau comes
when the master mime brings BIP onstage.
BIP
BIP, Marceau has said, is a character that was
born in the imagination of Marceau's child
hood. BIP provides an emotional handhold for
all of us, as we travel through Marceau's per
formance and through life — both of which may
be exceedingly complex and sometimes convo
luted.
We laugh with recognition through the rest of
Marceau's pantomimes, but in the BIP pan
tomimes, we laugh at ourselves. BlP's fear of
heights as he climbs a very tall ladder in "BIP as a
China Salesman" is our fear too. And BlP's faux
pas in "BIP at a Society Party" are the same ones
we fear that we, too, might some day commit.
Marceau, through his style pantomimes and
through his BIP pantomimes, shows us ourse
lves and our world — without words, but in a
language much more convincing — the lan
guage of oneness. What happens to Marceau
onstage, happens to us in real life.
