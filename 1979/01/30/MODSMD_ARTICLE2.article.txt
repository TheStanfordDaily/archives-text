# Teenage sniper kills principal, custodian
## 
### 
San Diego (AP) — A freckle-faced,
teen-aged girl who said she wanted
to "liven up the day" sprayed a
crowded elementary school with au
tomatic rifle fire yesterday, killing the
principal and a custodian and
wounding a police officer and eight
students — two critically.
The girl, identified by police as 16-
year-old Brenda Spencer, barricaded
herself inside the family's modest
home across the street from Cleve
land Elementary School for bVi hours
before she surrendered peacefully.
Spencer's parents, friends,
teachers and police experts had at
tempted to negotiate with the girl
throughout the day-long ordeal
using the telephone and a bullhorn.
A policeman on the scene, Sgt.
Dave Kelly, said Spencer quietly
emerged from the house on her own
and was grabbed by heavily armed
officers who whisked her away in a
patrol car.
The girl, who police described as a
"pretty good shot," began firing at
the school's parking lot at 8:40 a.m.
when students and staff members
were arriving for the day, officers
said.
500 rounds
The fusillade lasted about 15 mi
nutes, but Spencer — a junior at Pat
rick Henry High School — remained
holed up in the house with an esti
mated 500 to 600 rounds of ammuni
tion until 3:07 p.m. when she gave
up.
One of the officers who captured
Spencer, Mike Hendrickson, de
scribed the girl as an avid hunter and
said she had "fantasized in the past
about being a sniper."

"She knew a lot about our opera
tion from watching SWAT on TV," he
added.
Chaos broke out in the schoolyard
when the shooting started, with in
jured students screaming as they fell
and dozens of others scrambling to
find hiding places.
Shortly after the gunfire began,
Spencer told the San Diego Evening
Tribune by telephone she allegedly
began firing because "I don't like
Mondays — this livens up the day."
"I just wanted to," she said. "It just
popped into my head, about last
Wednesday, I think." Before hang
ing up, she said, "I have to go now. I
shof pig, I think, and I want to shoot
some more."
Indiscriminate
Asked if she was shooting at ran
dom, Spencer said she had no target.
"No one in particular."
Killed were principal Burton
Wragg, 53, and head custodian,
Michael Suchar, 56, said San Diego
Superintendent of Schools Tom
Goodwin.
School spokesman Fred Jeffries
said Wragg and Suchar were appa
rently "just walking into the school
like everybody else" when the girl
opened fire from her house across
the street.
Kept inside
School officials kept about 300
students — about 90 percent of the
student body — huddled in a clas
sroom and the school auditorium
until midday, and teachers warned
them to stay away from windows.
"The teachers were just trying to
keep the students quiet," one wit
ness said.

About 3% hours after the shooting
began, five buses were quietly
brought to the back of the school and
the students were evacuated to a
junior high school half a mile away
where their parents picked them up.
Two critical
At Alvarado Hospital, a spokesman
said two of the children were in criti
cal condition after undergoing
surgery for stomach wounds. The
other children were reported in fair
to stable condition with a variety of
wounds. Officer Robb was reported
in fair condition.
Don Berk, a hospital spokesman,
said the facility's switchboard was

jammed for hours as anxious parents
called to find out if their children had
been hurt.
"Fortunately, no one who called us
had children in the tragedy," Berk
said.
Police said Spencer had a prior
juvenile record, including an inci
dent last year when several windows
were broken at Cleveland Elemen
tary. Neighborhood children told a
reporter that Spencer had bragged to
them about being in a knife fight and
they said she seemed "proud of it."
The children described Spencer as
having red hair, freckles and a slen
der build.

"No one in particular."
Killed were principal Burton
Wragg, 53, and head custodian,
Michael Suchar, 56, said San Diego
Superintendent of Schools Tom
Goodwin.
School spokesman Fred Jeffries
said Wragg and Suchar were appa
rently "just walking into the school
like everybody else" when the girl
opened fire from her house across
the street.
Kept inside
School officials kept about 300
students — about 90 percent of the
student body — huddled in a clas
sroom and the school auditorium
until midday, and teachers warned
them to stay away from windows.
"The teachers were just trying to
keep the students quiet," one wit
ness said.

About 3% hours after the shooting
began, five buses were quietly
brought to the back of the school and
the students were evacuated to a
junior high school half a mile away
where their parents picked them up.
Two critical
At Alvarado Hospital, a spokesman
said two of the children were in criti
cal condition after undergoing
surgery for stomach wounds. The
other children were reported in fair
to stable condition with a variety of
wounds. Officer Robb was reported
in fair condition.
Don Berk, a hospital spokesman,
said the facility's switchboard was

jammed for hours as anxious parents
called to find out if their children had
been hurt.
"Fortunately, no one who called us
had children in the tragedy," Berk
said.
Police said Spencer had a prior
juvenile record, including an inci
dent last year when several windows
were broken at Cleveland Elemen
tary. Neighborhood children told a
reporter that Spencer had bragged to
them about being in a knife fight and
they said she seemed "proud of it."
The children described Spencer as
having red hair, freckles and a slen
der build.
San Diego (AP) — A freckle-faced,
teen-aged girl who said she wanted
to "liven up the day" sprayed a
crowded elementary school with au
tomatic rifle fire yesterday, killing the
principal and a custodian and
wounding a police officer and eight
students — two critically.
The girl, identified by police as 16-
year-old Brenda Spencer, barricaded
herself inside the family's modest
home across the street from Cleve
land Elementary School for bVi hours
before she surrendered peacefully.
Spencer's parents, friends,
teachers and police experts had at
tempted to negotiate with the girl
throughout the day-long ordeal
using the telephone and a bullhorn.
A policeman on the scene, Sgt.
Dave Kelly, said Spencer quietly
emerged from the house on her own
and was grabbed by heavily armed
officers who whisked her away in a
patrol car.
The girl, who police described as a
"pretty good shot," began firing at
the school's parking lot at 8:40 a.m.
when students and staff members
were arriving for the day, officers
said.
500 rounds
The fusillade lasted about 15 mi
nutes, but Spencer — a junior at Pat
rick Henry High School — remained
holed up in the house with an esti
mated 500 to 600 rounds of ammuni
tion until 3:07 p.m. when she gave
up.
One of the officers who captured
Spencer, Mike Hendrickson, de
scribed the girl as an avid hunter and
said she had "fantasized in the past
about being a sniper."

"She knew a lot about our opera
tion from watching SWAT on TV," he
added.
Chaos broke out in the schoolyard
when the shooting started, with in
jured students screaming as they fell
and dozens of others scrambling to
find hiding places.
Shortly after the gunfire began,
Spencer told the San Diego Evening
Tribune by telephone she allegedly
began firing because "I don't like
Mondays — this livens up the day."
"I just wanted to," she said. "It just
popped into my head, about last
Wednesday, I think." Before hang
ing up, she said, "I have to go now. I
shof pig, I think, and I want to shoot
some more."
Indiscriminate
Asked if she was shooting at ran
dom, Spencer said she had no target.
"No one in particular."
Killed were principal Burton
Wragg, 53, and head custodian,
Michael Suchar, 56, said San Diego
Superintendent of Schools Tom
