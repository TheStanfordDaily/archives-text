Iran airports to open despite protests
Tehran, Iran — Moslem rioters furious over the gov
ernment's refusal to bow to Ayatullah Ruhollah Kho
meini's leadership went on a vengeful rampage of arson
in Tehran yesterday. Later it was announced Iran's air
ports would reopen, allowing Khomeini to return from
his long exile.
As fires raged in southern Tehran, troops opened fire
to scatter the angry mobs of protesters, and at least three
were reported killed.
The rioters, bent on ridding their country of "sinful '
Western influences, set fire to a nightclub, a brewery,
liquor stores and a cork-processing plant and attacked
brothels.
The rioting was centered in the poor district of south
Tehran, where mobs chanted "Death to Bakhtiar!"
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar scrapped plans to
go on a peacemaking mission to Khomeini's exile head
quarters in France because of Khomeini's "unac
ceptable" condition that Bakhtiar first resign as prime
minister.
It appeared that Khomeini, architect of the anti-shah
movement, might fly from France to Iran as early as
tomorrow.
Bakhtiar, who has hinted of plots by the Iranian milit
ary against Khomeini, said the 78-year-old Moslem cler
gyman could return to Iran as soon as his security could
be ensured.
But Khomeini himself declared in a statement yester
day, "We don't ask any security from Bakhtiar or any
one. Cod is the best protector of my safety."
Teng arrives for American tour
Washington — Teng Hsiao-ping, the driving force in
China's outward reach to the West, came to the United
States on Sunday tor talks with President jimmy Carter
and a coast-to-coast tour that will draw the world's most
advanced nation closer to its most populous one.
The first of China's communist leaders to visit this
country, Teng is at the center of a nine-day whirl of
meetings and ceremonies trumpeting a new era in the

relationship between China and the United States. The
new era began Jan. 1 with full diplomatic recognition
between the two nations.
Noting the start of the Chinese New Year as well as
Teng's historic mission — the first state visit by a leader
of the People's Republic of China — the president de
clared at the welcoming ceremony: "It is a time when
family quarrels are forgotten ... a time of reunion and
reconciliation."
The Chinese vice premier had lunch with Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance. After the lunch, Teng said of his
morning meeting with the president: "There were no
boundaries to the number of questions we discussed,
from the earth to the heavens."
White House press secretary Jody Powell said Carter
had accepted Teng's invitation to China and had ex
tended his own invitation to Chairman Hua Kuo-feng to
visit the United States.
Chinese leader's welcome disrupted
Washington — Two Maoists disrupted official welcom
ing ceremonies for Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao
ping yesterday and their colleagues clashed violently
with police in the streets outside the White House.
The two, Sonia Ransom, 26, of Seattle, and Keith
Kojimoto, 28, of New York City, used press credentials
to gain admission to the White House grounds. They
were released on $100 bail after pleading innocent in
District of Columbia Superior Court to charges of disor
derly conduct.
Witnesses said about 500 members of the leftist
Committee fora Fitting Welcome rushed a policelineon
the sidewalk in front of the White House after dark,
hurling rocks, bottles, bags filled with fishhooks and
nails and at least one firebomb.
The police countercharged, driving the de
monstrators back and forcing them to scatter. The Na
tional Park Service said 45 people were arrested.
The Maoist group, an offshoot of the Revolutionary
Communist Party, also claimed responsibility for the
incident at the White House earlier in the day.

Fighting continues in Cambodia
Bangkok, Thailand — The forces of fallen Premier Pol
Pot claimed yesterday to be closing in on the Viet
namese- and rebel-held Cambodian capital of Phnom
Penh and listed other gains, some of which were con
firmed by Indochina analysts here.
Sources within the Thai and Western diplomatic and
military community, monitoring the six-week war from
this Thai capital, said highway four leading from Phnom
Penh to the sea had been cut.
Phnom Penh was seized Jan. 7 when Vietnamese
troops and pro-Vietnam Cambodians found the city
abandoned by Pol Pot and others who had fled to set up
resistance in the countryside.
The sources also said the ports of Kompong Som and
Kampot were still immobilized by heavy fighting and that
the ancient temples of Angkor, symbols of Cambodian
nationalism, may have been recaptured.
Pope advocates nonviolent change
Cuilapan, Mexico — Pope John Paul II made his
strongest plea for improving the lot of Latin America's
downtrodden yesterday, criticizing rich landowners
who "hide the bread needed by so many families."
In his speech, the pontiff laid down strict limits on the
political activities of clergymen, rebutted militant prog
ressives who advocate a "theology of liberation," and
ruled out violence as vehicle for change.
The pope, who traveled to Cuilapan by helicopter,
returned to Mexico City yesterday evening. The purpose
of his trip was to meet common people after two days of
discussions with someof Latin America's leading clergy.
The pope's directive to abstain from violence drew
immediate fire from a group of militant priests and
laymen at a "dissidents' conference" in Puebla, who
charged he "didn't consult with priests who know the
poor."
The source, who refused to be named, was referring
to the pontiff's years in Poland where the church has
battled for survival under the pressure of the communist
government.

States challenge 55-mph speed limit
Lawmakers in several western and rnidwestern states
have joined their Wyoming colleagues to campaign tor
an increase in the 55-mph speed limit, risking the loss of
millions of dollars in federal money.
"Everybody's tired of driving 55 miles per hour," said
Washington State Rep. Al Henry, who introduced a bill
last week raising the limit to 65 mph. Similar measures
have been introduced in Colorado, Nebraska and Texas,
and a bill boosting the limit to 65 mph already has been
approved by the Wyoming Senate.
An Associated Press spot check showed legislators in
Oklahoma, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada and North
Dakota also are talking about raising the speed limit, or
as an alternative, cutting penalties for drivers who go
faster than 55.
