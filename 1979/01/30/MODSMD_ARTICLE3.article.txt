# Carter grants Hearst clemency

### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter, agreeing that news
paper heiress Patricia Hearst "needs
no further rehabilitation" or
punishment, acted yesterday to set
her free this week.
Carter granted executiveclemency
to Hearst, perhaps the nation's most
celebrated federal prisoner, and
commuted her seven-year sentence
for bank robbery.
An announcement of the presi
dent's action, taken on the recom
mendation of the justice Depart
ment, said Hearst will be freed
Thursday from the federal prison at
Pleasanton, Calif. She has served 22
months of her sentence.
The White House said Hearst, who
will be 25 next month, "has been
punished substantially" for her part
in the holdup of a San Francisco bank
two months after she was kidnapped
by the Symbionese Liberation Army

in 1974.
Interviewed by ABC News, she
said after hearing of Carter's action:
"I'm really grateful that he was so
courageous. It would have been so
simple for him to just leave every
thing the way it was. I think it was...a
very courageous decision for him to
make.
Surprise
"I'm so happy," she said, adding
that the news was a surprise.
"I'm going to my mother's house,
and my sisters are there. We're going
to have a big reunion."
Hearst said in the telephone inter
view, "I was really happy. I was so
surprised it happened today. I just
didn't expect it...1 thought I'd be
spending another Feb. 4 in prison.
Feb. 4 would have been the fifth
anniversary of her kidnapping.
She was kidnapped from her Ber
keley apartment on Feb. 4, 1974.

Three days later, her parents re
ceived the first taped message from
the SLA, proclaiming their daughter
"a prisoner of war."
Hearst, born to wealth and raised
in luxury, spent 19 months on the run
in the terrorist underground after
her kidnapping. She was arrested
with artist Wendy Yoshimura in
September 1975 in the San Francisco
apartment they shared.
Hearst, in the space of a few
months, was transformed from an
obscure student at UC-Berkeley into
a revolutionary terrorist who iden
tified herself as "Tania" in tape
recorded messages.
Disowned parents
In the tapes, she reviled her pa
rents and said she had willingly
joined her captors. William Ran
dolph Hearst is president of the San
Francisco Examiner.
Mr. Hearst said Carter had "given
Patty back her life and made her fam
ily very happy."
He called Carter's decision to cut
short Hearst's time in prison '"a polit
ically courageous move because
there are people in this country who
continue to believe the only reason
she is being set free is because of her
name.
Victimised by name
"Thetruth of the matter, of course,
is that she was kidnapped because of
her name and her name was respon
sible for her severe sentence," he
said.
Patricia Hearst's mother said yes
terday she was "just the happiest
person in the world" after learning
that Carter had decided to commute
her daughter's prison sentence.
"Are you sure?" she asked. "My

Cod in heaven. I can't believe it. I'm
just the happiest person in the world.
She has suffered for five years. I can't
believe that it's going to be over."
Brainwashing
Pardon supporters — including
dozens of congressmen, prominent
Americans and even the federal pro
secutor who tried her — said she was
never a criminal, but a kidnap victim
who succumbed to weeks of brain
washing, physical deprivation and
sexual violations inflicted by her SLA
captors.
Her relatives and friends launched
a campaign for presidential cle
mency. It caught on. Soon, politi
cians, movie stars, lawyers groups,
the FBI agent who led the hunt for
her — and even six of the 12 jurors
who convicted her — agreed Hearst
had suffered enough and should be
released.
Among other supporters of release
for Hearst were actor John Wayne
and singer Glen Campbell, suppor
ters said.
"It seems that the majority of
American people are beginning to
understand what she went through,"
her father said recently.
Cultists, Hearst
The mass murder-suicide of more
than 900 Peoples Temple members in
the Guyana jungle last November
lent fuel to her supporters' argu
ment. They said she had been brain
washed by the SLA as certainly as
Temple cultists had been brain
washed by the Rev. Jim Jones.
Ryan, killed in Guyana in
November on a visit to the Peoples
Temple, had led the fight to free
Hearst.
