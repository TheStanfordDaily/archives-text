# Power to shut down for computer move
## 
### David Frank 
Electrical power will be shut down here on Sun
day, Feb. 11 from 8 a.m. to 12 noon in order to
make modifications for new computer facilities in
Jordan Quad.
With the exception of the Medical Center and
Faculty/Staff housing area, the shutdown will
mean no electricity for the entire campus north of
Medical Way. This includes all of Escondido Vil
lage and Manzanita Park.
All building services in that area, including venti
lation, heating, air-conditioning, elevators, light
ing and plumbing will be affected. Electricians and
plumbers will be on campus in case of problems
during the outage or after power is restored. .
Telephone service will not be affected.
In addition, Sunday brunch will be served on
schedule by the University Food Services.
The reason for the shutdown is that the Stanford
Center for Information Processing (SCIP) will
move from its old quarters in Encina Hall to a new
two-story building in ]ordan Quad.

Robert McKnight, supervisor of the Utilities Dis
tribution System, explained, "There has to be ad
ditional switchgear in the Stanford substation to
provide for the new computer center." The addi
tional switchgear includes a new circuit breaker,
and a switch to establish and feed power to that
new circuit.
"In order to add the new switchgear, we have to
shut down the entire 12,000 volt power source. We
can't convert the switchgear with the electricity
on," McKnight explained.
Oley Christensen, the project manager,
explained that the Westinghouse Corporation has
been doing all the preliminary work. "The power
shutdown is just to make final electrical connec
tions," he said.
Labs unaffected
Christensen also noted that laboratory experi
ments would not be affected by the shutdown.
"On a Sunday morning, there will be a minimum
of traffic going in and out of buildings; we don't
anticipate any real problems."
Arrangements have been made for areas that

need power during the outage, such as the Medi
cal Microbiology Center, Christensen said.
Maxine Anderson, director of University Food
Services said, "We're obviously going to be li
mited by the shutdown, but we're preparing."
Without the use of any electric ovens or steamers,
Food Services plans to use their gas grilis. "We will
definitely have some kind of hot items such as
scrambled eggs and hash browns," she said.
Generator ready
Ed Cannon, a supervisor for building mainte
nance, said, "We will be on the watch for any
backups in plumbing. We will have an emergency
generator on hand to use."
The University receives its electrical power from
the Pacific Gas and Electric Company through the
Via Palou substation located on Panama Street ac
ross from the Roble tennis courts.
The Faculty/Staff housing area on the southeast
ern corner of campus and the Stanford Medical
Center do not receive their power from the Via
Palou substation.
