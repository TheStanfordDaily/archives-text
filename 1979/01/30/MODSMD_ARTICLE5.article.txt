# Resident fellows juggle student needs, careers, personal lives

Upstairs, a stereo pounds out vibrant beats of bass
and treble, as a few students sing along in melodic
intoxication. On the floor below, one student studies
for his first chemistry midterm while another tries to
sleep in preparation tor her second try at the LSATs.
Meanwhile, just outside the residence, the resident
fellow (RF) must negotiate the time-consuming re
sponsibilities of dorm, career and personal life.
The Stanford University Bulletin defines the resi
dent fellow as "assisting the house in providing direc
tion to its activities." The actual duties of the resident
fellow go far beyond that, however. The details of
their responsibility, degree of presence, and style of
interaction differ according to the particular fellow
and the structure of the residence.
Each year 16 families and 9 bachelors commit them
selves to three quarters in 44 undergraduate resi
dences. What makes them do it?
Contact
Resident fellows say they enjoy contact with un
dergraduates. They also mentioned the extra money
they receive, but this was only of secondary impor
tance. Many said interaction with students enhances
their effectiveness as professors or administrators,
promotes a greater understanding of students' needs
and concerns, and allows undergraduates to view
professors in an environment other than the clas
sroom. Resident fellows receive room and board for
nine months of the year and free room over the sum
mer, all exempt from federal income tax.
Behind these basic incentives, however, are addi
tional motivations, a wide range of individual
backgrounds, and an assortment of perceived roles.
Unify
The duties of Orrin "Rob" Robinson, associate pro
fessor of German studies, and his wife Linda, a Uni
versity law student, fellows for Lagunita Court West
(Adelfa, Eucalypto and Granada), feel their role is to
serve as the unifying force behind these dorms. The
Robinsons said this results in students feeling more
like Lagunita residents than residents of a particular
house.
Rob, a department and freshman adviser before his
appointment to Lagunita West, said he and his wife
are "not here to be in loco parentisyet admit that it
is "their responsibility to exercise authority when
things reach acertain point." It is equally necessary to
maintain good relations with the maintenance crew
and administration, and to be available as an "RA's

RA" — a counselor-friend for resident assistants, they
said.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the president and resi
dent fellow at Larkin House in Stern Hall, also de
scribed his role as being an "RA's RA." He explained
that RAs have their own problems, and need some
one to talk with.
Basic tone
Hamrdla said "Resident fellows have to set the
basic tone of what is happening in the residence." It
is important to have someone responsible for the
cultural, social and educational activities in the
dorm," he said. There must be "a place where the
buck stops," Hamrdla added. Hamrdla said he feels
obligated to show the potential of University resi
dences as educational and intellectual experiences.
Bill and Kathy Durham, resident fellows at Arroyo
House in Wilbur Hall, also stressed the importance of
education in the residence. The Durhams have regu
lar sherry hours and extended dinners in their cot
tage. Members of the dorm prepare the meal to
gether and play host to their guest.
Kathy, a lecturer in human biology and Bill, assis
tant professor of human biology and anthropology,
conclude that the "dorm should be not just a place
where you turn off your brain, but a place where
using your brain is more enjoyable."
Michel and Pat Nabti, resident fellows in Trancos,
appreciate "being in the heart of things" and see their
role as twofold: coordinating the staff and offering a
different perspective on what goes on in the dorm.
The Nabtis, although intent on becoming involved
with the students, feel that peers can handle dorm
problems most effectively, and consequently rely on
their staff to solve problems.
Cooperative dinners
The Nabtis consider residential education very im
portant in making students comfortable with faculty
members and in making them aware that education
need not occur "only in the Quad."
Scott Pearson, associate director of the Food Re
search Institute, and his wife Sandra, a drama instruc
tor for the Palo Alto schools system are resident fel
lows in Madera. They stress availability and consis
tency as the major rules for the resident fellow. They
attempt to be extremely active in the dorm by attend
ing virtually all meals and parties.
'Little things'
They are available for students interested in
"deep" conversation or ones merely wishing to "bor
row the egg beater." Pearson explains, "Just doing

little things, offering a little help here and there, is
tremendously appreciated." As they stated in a re
cent article in Campus Report, "the most damning
indictment of a resident fellow is to be the subject of
the phrase, 'He's never there when you need him.' "
Pearson notes that the task of resident fellow has
changed over the past 10 years. Since much of the
time then was filled with talking politics and dealing
with more emotional problems, it was a greater chal
lenge to attain a "balanced" program, he said. It was a
period of the draft and broken windows, he explains,
but "now it is much more like 20 years ago when I was
an undergraduate, where concerns seem more on
where one is going in their own career and in classes
for their own sake."
Mark Mancall, director of Overseas Studies, is the
resident fellow in Florence Moore Hall. He concurs
with the idea that the position's nature has changed.
"The job had a certain frenzy about it in the late '60s
and early 705," Mancall recalled. Mancall organized
the first coeducational dormitory on the Stanford
campus in 1967.
Dorm-based
He also developed the University's first
dormitory-based educational program, known as
Structured Liberal Education (SLE). Some years ago,
seeking a "change in scenery," Mancall moved to
Florence Moore from Wilbur, bringing the SLE prog

ram with him. Although he works for all his students,
Mancall continues his "direction of, and participation
in, the teaching of the SLE program."
Bob Maddix, professor of chemical engineering,
became the resident fellow in Toyon Hall because of
his desires for both close contact with under
graduates and the opportunity to effect their lives
outside the classroom. Maddix was instrumental in
forming SCIRE and developing Ecology House, an
experimental theme house (now Terra).
Comfortable place
He wants to make "Toyon a comfortable place in
which to live. I would probably view my role diffe
rently if Toyon were a smaller house," he explains.
But due to the dormitory's size "my most important
responsibility as resident fellow is to get a good RA
staff."
Jim and Margaret Fox were fellows in Arroyo last
year and ate presently in Rinconada. Margaret said
there are "lots of roles, some dictated by the Univer
sity and some which we do just because we want to
do them." jim, an assistant professor of linguistics
and anthropology, states that one of his largest roles
is coordinating the advising program, whicb involves
keeping in contact with advisors and serving as a link
between them and the students. |im and Margaret
host study breaks where residents and fellows have
the opportunity to get acquainted.

Michel and Pat Nabti, resident fellows in Trancos,
appreciate "being in the heart of things" and see their
role as twofold: coordinating the staff and offering a
different perspective on what goes on in the dorm.
The Nabtis, although intent on becoming involved
with the students, feel that peers can handle dorm
problems most effectively, and consequently rely on
their staff to solve problems.

The Nabtis consider residential education very im
portant in making students comfortable with faculty
members and in making them aware that education
need not occur "only in the Quad."
Scott Pearson, associate director of the Food Re
search Institute, and his wife Sandra, a drama instruc
tor for the Palo Alto schools system are resident fel
lows in Madera. They stress availability and consis
tency as the major rules for the resident fellow. They
attempt to be extremely active in the dorm by attend
ing virtually all meals and parties.
'Little things'
They are available for students interested in
"deep" conversation or ones merely wishing to "bor
row the egg beater." Pearson explains, "Just doing

little things, offering a little help here and there, is
tremendously appreciated." As they stated in a re
cent article in Campus Report, "the most damning
indictment of a resident fellow is to be the subject of
the phrase, 'He's never there when you need him.' "
Pearson notes that the task of resident fellow has
changed over the past 10 years. Since much of the
time then was filled with talking politics and dealing
with more emotional problems, it was a greater chal
lenge to attain a "balanced" program, he said. It was a
period of the draft and broken windows, he explains,
but "now it is much more like 20 years ago when I was
an undergraduate, where concerns seem more on
where one is going in their own career and in classes
for their own sake."
Mark Mancall, director of Overseas Studies, is the
resident fellow in Florence Moore Hall. He concurs
with the idea that the position's nature has changed.
"The job had a certain frenzy about it in the late '60s
and early 705," Mancall recalled. Mancall organized
the first coeducational dormitory on the Stanford
campus in 1967.
Dorm-based
He also developed the University's first
dormitory-based educational program, known as
Structured Liberal Education (SLE). Some years ago,
seeking a "change in scenery," Mancall moved to
Florence Moore from Wilbur, bringing the SLE prog

ram with him. Although he works for all his students,
Mancall continues his "direction of, and participation
in, the teaching of the SLE program."
Bob Maddix, professor of chemical engineering,
became the resident fellow in Toyon Hall because of
his desires for both close contact with under
graduates and the opportunity to effect their lives
outside the classroom. Maddix was instrumental in
forming SCIRE and developing Ecology House, an
experimental theme house (now Terra).
Comfortable place
He wants to make "Toyon a comfortable place in
which to live. I would probably view my role diffe
rently if Toyon were a smaller house," he explains.
But due to the dormitory's size "my most important
responsibility as resident fellow is to get a good RA
staff."
Jim and Margaret Fox were fellows in Arroyo last

Upstairs, a stereo pounds out vibrant beats of bass
and treble, as a few students sing along in melodic
intoxication. On the floor below, one student studies
for his first chemistry midterm while another tries to
sleep in preparation tor her second try at the LSATs.
Meanwhile, just outside the residence, the resident
fellow (RF) must negotiate the time-consuming re
sponsibilities of dorm, career and personal life.
The Stanford University Bulletin defines the resi
dent fellow as "assisting the house in providing direc
tion to its activities." The actual duties of the resident
fellow go far beyond that, however. The details of
their responsibility, degree of presence, and style of
interaction differ according to the particular fellow
and the structure of the residence.
Each year 16 families and 9 bachelors commit them
selves to three quarters in 44 undergraduate resi
dences. What makes them do it?
Contact
Resident fellows say they enjoy contact with un
dergraduates. They also mentioned the extra money
they receive, but this was only of secondary impor
tance. Many said interaction with students enhances
their effectiveness as professors or administrators,
promotes a greater understanding of students' needs
and concerns, and allows undergraduates to view
professors in an environment other than the clas
sroom. Resident fellows receive room and board for
nine months of the year and free room over the sum
mer, all exempt from federal income tax.
Behind these basic incentives, however, are addi
tional motivations, a wide range of individual
backgrounds, and an assortment of perceived roles.
Unify
The duties of Orrin "Rob" Robinson, associate pro
fessor of German studies, and his wife Linda, a Uni
versity law student, fellows for Lagunita Court West
(Adelfa, Eucalypto and Granada), feel their role is to
serve as the unifying force behind these dorms. The
Robinsons said this results in students feeling more
like Lagunita residents than residents of a particular
house.
Rob, a department and freshman adviser before his
appointment to Lagunita West, said he and his wife
are "not here to be in loco parentisyet admit that it
is "their responsibility to exercise authority when
things reach acertain point." It is equally necessary to
maintain good relations with the maintenance crew
and administration, and to be available as an "RA's

RA" — a counselor-friend for resident assistants, they
said.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the president and resi
dent fellow at Larkin House in Stern Hall, also de
scribed his role as being an "RA's RA." He explained
that RAs have their own problems, and need some
one to talk with.
Basic tone
Hamrdla said "Resident fellows have to set the
basic tone of what is happening in the residence." It
is important to have someone responsible for the
cultural, social and educational activities in the
dorm," he said. There must be "a place where the
buck stops," Hamrdla added. Hamrdla said he feels
obligated to show the potential of University resi
dences as educational and intellectual experiences.
Bill and Kathy Durham, resident fellows at Arroyo
House in Wilbur Hall, also stressed the importance of
education in the residence. The Durhams have regu
lar sherry hours and extended dinners in their cot
tage. Members of the dorm prepare the meal to
gether and play host to their guest.
