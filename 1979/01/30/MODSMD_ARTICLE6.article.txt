The man who fights for his ideals

In the process of learning about the struggle
in Golden, Colorado I have also learned about a
similar struggle here at the University. It is not
talked about directly, yet it is just as much a part
of our lives as the fear of poverty that haunts
Coors' employees.
The university community is feeling the im
pact of 10 years of recession and inflation. Col
lege graduates are finding it tougher to find any
job at all, let alone anything connected with
their field of study. We have emerged from the
'60s, and a feeling of confidence in our ability to
change things, into the '70s and a severe doubt
in our abilities to survive in an increasingly hos
tile world. We cannot even agree on causes of
inflation and recession and find our hopes of
solving these problems collapse into an abyss of
despair.
When this economic crisis developed, the
same phenomena that happened in Colorado
happened here. We have let our fear of adver
sity alterour principlesand priorities. Suddenly,
social consciousness became the "me" genera
tion. The pervasive influence of the pernicious
first person singular has turned our sights away
from larger social goals towards individual per
sonal goals.
We have succumbed to the all-too-human in
clination to turn in despair to the slogans and
nostrums of a simpler time. "Rugged indi
vidualism," "Looking out for Number One" and
"Anyone can make it on their own" have re
placed "Help your neighbor" as the new moral
ity. Before, we camped in front of Old Union to
protest exploitation of black workers in South
Africa. Now, just two years later, we are reduced
and degraded to the point of camping in front of
the Career Planning and Placement Center to
ask Bank of America (one of South Africa's inves
tors) for a job, while exploited and intimidated
workers at Coors and in South Africa are forgot
ten. Where are our principles, our values and
our pride? Have we exchanged these for 30
pieces of silver and a company car?
I worry about our lack of dedication to causes.
The cynicism of today, coupled with our grossly
distorted individualism, has created a situation

in which we are incapable of imagining the self
lessly disinterested hero. Where is the voice
calling us to action, to do what is socially and
morally right, and where are the voices calling
back in support? The silence is deafening.
Yes, fear of poverty does make people do
strange things. It is important to understand that
it is the same fear that drives a brewery worker
across a picket line that drives a student to sleep
in front of the CPPC. But what is the social cost
we are willing to bear for such fear, in terms of
lost morals and human dignity? Are all of our
morals now reduced to dollars and cents?
We can react to our fears in two ways. We can
continue to struggle against one another,
scrambling over the bodies of our fellow stu
dents in an effort to reach security. We may also,
however, follow the example of the striking
Coors workers and cooperate, unite and extend
a hand of support.
It starts with having a sense of purpose greater
than ourselves, an idea of working togetherwith
others to achieve some overall social good —
and perhaps even attain some individual good in
the process. Whether it is working to support
striking brewer> workers, or working for a re
sponsible investment policy for the University,
we need the causes as much as the causes need
us.
The decision is ours. We may be so hopelessly
entangled in a morass of midterms, finals, GPAs,
LSATs, MCATs, CMATs and GREs that we fail to
notice the world we're attempting to master
slowly decay into poverty and injustice, leaving
Muzak to muffle the poor's cries of anguish.
The Coors issue has made many things clearer
to me, but it also has thrown doubt into my
future. Perhaps our community will come alive
to the challenge, and walk in unified confidence
rather than cower in fear. Perhaps I am waiting
in vain. Maybe we are doomed to an academic
atmosphere devoid of moral content, an atmos
phere in which exploitation and dignity are the
subject of a political science seminar and where
poverty is reduced to an economist's graph.
Maybe what I'm searching for cannot be
found here. Perhaps it is found on a picket line
in Colorado, or in a tin shack in Soweto. Maybe I
should phone in . . . not sick, but well.
