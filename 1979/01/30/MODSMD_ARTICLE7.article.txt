## Palestinian history clarified 
### 
I am writing this in connec
tion with thecolumn written by
David LeVine (Daily, )an. 16).
Stanford is the fourth Ameri
can university I have visited in
connection with some re
search I am doing on the Mid
east conflict. However, as at
Harvard, >ale and Berkeley,
most ot the opinions expres
sed in the campus newspaper,
are mostly pro-Israel and anti-
Arab. The Palestinians are sel
dom mentioned. And when
mentioned, they are often pic
tured as gangs of villains and
terrorists.
As both a history professor
whose specialty is the Middle
East and as a person who has
been to Israel a number of
times, I find that LeVine's
article does not do anybody
any good; not himself; not the
Daily; not even Israel and, cer
tainly, not the truth.
I wili not advocate either
poi nt of view here but I want to
cored some of the historical
as well as logical mistakes
LeVine has made for the be
nefit of those who are in
terested in this emotionally
charged subject (particularly
since LeVine seems to be su

concerned with accuracy and
with intellectual honesty!). I
will follow LeVine's arguments
in their original order.
First, he says, "All the territ
ory occupied by modern Israel
was obtained in one of three
ways: purchase, mandate or
war." However, it does not fol
low from this historical fact that
purchase, mandate or war
makes Israel legitimate — not
logically, not morally and not
legally. Today, thousands of
foreigners (oil-rich Arabs, Ira
nians, Japanese, Germans,
etc.) buy land in the United
States. Does this give them
the right to kick Americans out
of their homeland and set up a
different political order?
LeVine mentions the man
date Britain had over Palestine,
the details of which he appa
rently knows nothing about.
That mandate was given by the
League of Nations which was
scandalously controlled by the
European colonial powers of
the time. As illegitimate as the
mandate was, it was always
clearly stated that a colonial
power that had mandate over
another state had no right
whatsoever to modify the lat

ter's borders or to surrender its
sovereignty to another power
against the wishes of its na
tives.
LeVine says that Palestine
was under British control in the
1880s. This is completely
wrong. From 1517 until 1918
Palestine was part of Greater
Syria which was an Ottoman
state. The Ottoman Empire,
which collapsed in 1924 by the
establishment of the Republic
of Turkey, was a continuation
of the Islamic caliphate which
had started early in the seventh
century in Arabia and control
led most of what is known
today as the Islamic World.
Palestine remained part of the
Ottoman Empire up to 1918.
In 1916 the Arab nationalists
in Greater Syria and the Hijaz
decided to revolt against the
Ottoman caliph and establish a
united Arab state. The British,
who needed any help to fight
the Ottomans (and their Ger
man allies) agreed to recognize
the proposed united Arab state
(which was to include a Pales
tine! in exchange for Arab
military action against the Ot
tomans. At the same time, the
British needed money for their
war efforts and in 1917 they
made an almost secret promise
to the lewish French million
aire Rothschild to support the
establishment of a "homeland
for the Jewish people in Pales
tine" in exchange for financial
support by Furopean Jewish
millionaires. That promise,
known as I he "Balfour Declara
tion" became the legal basis
for the establishment of the
State of Israel in 1948.
LeVine makes an analogy be
tween the lands which Israel
annexed in its wars with the
Arabs and the lands which
were liberated from British rule
in the American Revolution. It
is too poor an analogy to refute
here; he could have compared
Israeli expansion with French
expansion in Europe under
Napoleon or even German ex
pansion under Hitler with
equal success at persuasion.
Put simply enough, military
victory does not legitimize ex
pansion.
LeVine says, "there are no
rightful Arab owners to whom
the property should be re
turned." Well, how about two
million Palestinian refugees?
What gives a Russian Jew or an
American Jew the right to
emigrate to Israel and settle in
a state-supported colony in the
West Bank or elsewhere in
Palestine while, at the same

time, the Palestinians have to
be born, live and die in refugee
camps in Lebanon and other
places where the threat of
death looms on their heads
everytime Israeli planes appear
in the sky or every time an Arab
head of state has the impulse to
get rid of them?
LeVine says that the Palesti
nians who have remained
under Israeli rule "have full
citizenship and are protected
under the law.'' For an Arab to
have "full citizenship" and
"full protection" in Israel does
not mean any more than for a
native American to have "full
citizenship'' and "full protec
tion" in the United States; it is
citizenship in a state that was
set up on his own territory at
the expense of his own people.
And, then, "protection" from
what? From his own fellow
Arabs or from more European
lewish settlers?
LeVine says that Hebrew
"was and is the majority lan
guage in the territorv nt krael.
If by 1900 only five percent of
the population w.is Jc-vvi>h,
how can anyone say that Heb
rew "was" the majority lan
guage? Besides, most lewish
immigrants, including Begin,
Meir, Ben Curion, never really
spoke Hebrew properly. They
spoke their own national Euro
pean languages.
says that "Arabs are
Semites because Arabic, like
Hebrew, is a Semitic language."
This statement is both logically
and factually wrong. English is
the language of lamaica, does
this make the Jamaican people
Anglo-Saxon? Furthermore,
Afrikaans does not make the
black majority in South Africa
Boers, or does it? The Arabs are
a very heterogeneous nation.
Arabism is more of a spiritual,
cultural or historical ap
pelation than an ethnic one.
The Arabs range, in their
ethnicity, from blacks in the
Sudan and the Sahara to
Caucasians in Greater Syria, to
a mixture of these two groups
and many other racial groups
in most other parts of the Arab
World.
Ironically enough, LeVine
says that he is "appalled by the
fact that a graduate student at
Stanford could make an argu
ment with such faulty historical
research." I hope he learns
from his own advice.

here; he could have compared
Israeli expansion with French
expansion in Europe under
Napoleon or even German ex
pansion under Hitler with
equal success at persuasion.
Put simply enough, military
victory does not legitimize ex
pansion.
LeVine says, "there are no
rightful Arab owners to whom
the property should be re
turned." Well, how about two
million Palestinian refugees?
What gives a Russian Jew or an
American Jew the right to
emigrate to Israel and settle in
a state-supported colony in the
West Bank or elsewhere in
Palestine while, at the same

time, the Palestinians have to
be born, live and die in refugee
camps in Lebanon and other
places where the threat of
death looms on their heads
everytime Israeli planes appear
in the sky or every time an Arab
head of state has the impulse to
get rid of them?
LeVine says that the Palesti
nians who have remained
under Israeli rule "have full
citizenship and are protected
under the law.'' For an Arab to
have "full citizenship" and
"full protection" in Israel does
not mean any more than for a
native American to have "full
citizenship'' and "full protec
tion" in the United States; it is
citizenship in a state that was
set up on his own territory at
the expense of his own people.
And, then, "protection" from
what? From his own fellow
Arabs or from more European
lewish settlers?
LeVine says that Hebrew
"was and is the majority lan
guage in the territorv nt krael.
If by 1900 only five percent of
the population w.is Jc-vvi>h,
how can anyone say that Heb
rew "was" the majority lan
guage? Besides, most lewish
immigrants, including Begin,
Meir, Ben Curion, never really
spoke Hebrew properly. They
spoke their own national Euro
pean languages.
says that "Arabs are
Semites because Arabic, like
Hebrew, is a Semitic language."
This statement is both logically
and factually wrong. English is
the language of lamaica, does
this make the Jamaican people
Anglo-Saxon? Furthermore,
Afrikaans does not make the
black majority in South Africa
Boers, or does it? The Arabs are
a very heterogeneous nation.
Arabism is more of a spiritual,
cultural or historical ap
pelation than an ethnic one.
The Arabs range, in their
ethnicity, from blacks in the
Sudan and the Sahara to
Caucasians in Greater Syria, to
a mixture of these two groups
and many other racial groups
in most other parts of the Arab
World.
Ironically enough, LeVine
says that he is "appalled by the
fact that a graduate student at
Stanford could make an argu
ment with such faulty historical
research." I hope he learns
from his own advice.

I am writing this in connec
tion with thecolumn written by
David LeVine (Daily, )an. 16).
Stanford is the fourth Ameri
can university I have visited in
connection with some re
search I am doing on the Mid
east conflict. However, as at
Harvard, >ale and Berkeley,
most ot the opinions expres
sed in the campus newspaper,
are mostly pro-Israel and anti-
Arab. The Palestinians are sel
dom mentioned. And when
mentioned, they are often pic
tured as gangs of villains and
terrorists.
As both a history professor
whose specialty is the Middle
East and as a person who has
been to Israel a number of
times, I find that LeVine's
article does not do anybody
any good; not himself; not the
Daily; not even Israel and, cer
tainly, not the truth.
I wili not advocate either
poi nt of view here but I want to
cored some of the historical
as well as logical mistakes
LeVine has made for the be
nefit of those who are in
terested in this emotionally
charged subject (particularly
since LeVine seems to be su

concerned with accuracy and
with intellectual honesty!). I
will follow LeVine's arguments
in their original order.
First, he says, "All the territ
ory occupied by modern Israel
was obtained in one of three
ways: purchase, mandate or
war." However, it does not fol
low from this historical fact that
purchase, mandate or war
makes Israel legitimate — not
logically, not morally and not
legally. Today, thousands of
foreigners (oil-rich Arabs, Ira
nians, Japanese, Germans,
etc.) buy land in the United
States. Does this give them
the right to kick Americans out
of their homeland and set up a
different political order?
LeVine mentions the man
date Britain had over Palestine,
the details of which he appa
rently knows nothing about.
That mandate was given by the
League of Nations which was
scandalously controlled by the
European colonial powers of
the time. As illegitimate as the
mandate was, it was always
clearly stated that a colonial
power that had mandate over
another state had no right
whatsoever to modify the lat

ter's borders or to surrender its
sovereignty to another power
against the wishes of its na
tives.
LeVine says that Palestine
was under British control in the
1880s. This is completely
wrong. From 1517 until 1918
Palestine was part of Greater
Syria which was an Ottoman
state. The Ottoman Empire,
which collapsed in 1924 by the
establishment of the Republic
of Turkey, was a continuation
of the Islamic caliphate which
had started early in the seventh
century in Arabia and control
led most of what is known
today as the Islamic World.
Palestine remained part of the
Ottoman Empire up to 1918.
In 1916 the Arab nationalists
in Greater Syria and the Hijaz
decided to revolt against the
Ottoman caliph and establish a
united Arab state. The British,
who needed any help to fight
the Ottomans (and their Ger
man allies) agreed to recognize
the proposed united Arab state
(which was to include a Pales
tine! in exchange for Arab
military action against the Ot
tomans. At the same time, the
British needed money for their
war efforts and in 1917 they
made an almost secret promise
to the lewish French million
aire Rothschild to support the
establishment of a "homeland
for the Jewish people in Pales
tine" in exchange for financial
support by Furopean Jewish
millionaires. That promise,
known as I he "Balfour Declara
tion" became the legal basis
for the establishment of the
State of Israel in 1948.
LeVine makes an analogy be
tween the lands which Israel
annexed in its wars with the
Arabs and the lands which
were liberated from British rule
in the American Revolution. It
is too poor an analogy to refute
here; he could have compared
Israeli expansion with French
expansion in Europe under
Napoleon or even German ex
pansion under Hitler with
equal success at persuasion.
