# Ford post goes to NY lawyer
## 
### Emily Sachar 
The prestigious New York-based
Ford Foundation has named Franklin
Thomas, a prominent black lawyer,
to succeed McGeorge Bundy as its
president.
Thomas, 44, previously served as
deputy New York City police com
missioner for legal affairs and as as
sistant U.S. attorney for the southern
district of New York.
President Richard Lyman, in
Washington, D.C. on business,
admitted yesterday that he was inter
viewed for the presidency post by
the foundation's Board of Trustees
over the weekend.
"I was expecting I might be offered
the position," Lyman said. "Of
course, I hadn't decided whether I'd
accept. That's a decision one can
make only after a position is of
fered."
'Excellent selection'
"I think it (the foundation) made
an excellent selection. I have met
him (Thomas) a little over a month
ago, unrelated to this (the Ford
foundation presidency). He's intelli
gent, articulate and a delightful per
son."
Several publications, including the
New York Times, had listed Lyman
and Thomas among seven candi
dates "being seriously considered"
for the post.
Richard Magat, spokesman for the
foundation, would not release the
names of candidates interviewed by
the foundation's trustees. Nor would
he disclose how many candidates
were interviewed.
"It (the number of candidates in
terviewed) was a very small
number," Lyman said yesterday.
Relief here
Reaction among administrators
here was one of relief.
"I'm delighted he's staying at Stan
ford," Associate Provost Ed Shaw
said.
Dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences Richard )ahns commented,
"My reaction is immense relief. It
would represent, at the very least, a
loss in momentum, if Mr. Lyman left.
For my money, he has been an ex
traordinary leader."
