## Inflation and dollar decline plague nation 
### 
Inflation and the decline of
the dollar are undoubtedly the
worst problems in America to
day. The threat of recession
and even depression looms in
the future. And yet, the
analyses of the causes of infla
tion and the dollar's decline, as
well as the search forsolutions,
seem half-hearted and unim
aginative. While efforts to man
ipulate interest rates, buy dol
lars from abroad and so on, are
useful, they are definitely not
enough.
A careful analysis of the
causes of these serious prob
lems will suggest many work
able measures for their con
trol. One of the causes is the
ever-rising price of energy.
Another is the increasing cost
of materials, as concentrated
reserves are being depleted.
The price of land is rising and
the need for imports is increas
ing.
Imports of energy and other
resources hurt the U.S. ba
lance of trade and the value of
the dollar, and put people to
work inothercountries instead
of in the United States.
Also adding to the problem
is the large amount of govern
ment spending, which is not
balanced by tax revenues.
There is also population
growth which increases the
demand for goods, land and
resources.
Let's look at energy. There
has been much debate about
whether solar energy and con
servation measures are feasi
ble or economical, and how
much of our energy needs they
can supply. The debate has
been fraught with confusion
and a lack of up-to-date infor

mation. For instance, solar sys
tems are often claimed to be
three to 10 times as expensive
as conventional systems. This
may be true at the time they are
purchased, but most solar sys
tems pay for themselves in
energy cost savings (in three to
20 years), and therefore are
cheaper in the long run. The
same is true of conservation
measures such as insulation
and energy-efficient machines,
only these usually have shorter
"payback periods."
According to the American
Institute of Architects, payback
periods for conservation and
solar and wind systems are
often half those of conven
tional, large-scale utility sys
tems. They calculate that a
large-scale program for
energy-efficiency in buildings
over the next 15 years would
give the United States a net sav
ings of $450 billion in energy
costs — and would save as
much energy as two-thirds of
our 1990 projected oil imports!
Through conservation and
use of renewable energy
sources, the drain of dollars to
OPEC countries could be dras
tically slowed, the dollar
strengthened and Americans
(instead of Arabs) put to work.
Strangely, President jimmy
Carter's energy plan claims far
smaller benefits from conser
vation.
Few people know that there
are several solar technologies
that are already far cheaper
than fossil fuels and nuclear
power, which are ready to be
put into worldwide use. For in
stance, Southern California
Edison has bought a three
megawatt wind turbine for

s3s6/kwh (in an area of
fairly high wind), which is only
one-third to one-fourth the
capital cost of a new nuclear
reactor, and one-half the cost
per kilowatt-hour! And, ac
cording to a study by the De
partment of Energy and
George Washington Univer
sity, the Thomason "Solaris"
trickle-type solar heating/air
conditioning/hot water system
costs no more than conven
tional systems when installed
in a new house, including bac
kup power, storage and instal
lation costs. In other words,
the paybat k is immediate.
When installed in an older
house, it will often pay for itself
in only eight years In 20 years,
the savings can be as great as
the value of the house!
We could economically sup
ply all of our utility require
ments by the year 2000 through
"co-generation," or genera
tion of electricity from indust
rial process heat.
There is also great potential
for conserving and recycling
other resources. Conserving
and recycling are cheaper than
our present wastefulness —
and would also reduce our
need for foreign imports. Con
servation, solar and wind
power, and recycling would
also put many more people to
work than our present policies
do — according to several gov
ernment studies — and so
would help to reduce poverty
and the need for government
welfare spending.
Government deficit spend
ing is indeed a major con
tributor to inflation, and 'here
is much waste that could be cut
out. just ask Sen. Proxmire, the

watchdog of government
wasteful spending in the area
of science research. The gov
ernment also wastes our
money forsuch things as spray
ing poisonous herbicides on
our national forests to increase
the profitable softwood trees
for lumbermen!
But we should not cut impor
tant programs like health, edu
cation and job training. It
would make more sense to ask
that the upper-middle class
and rich in this country pay
their fair share of taxes. In
some cases they do, but in
other cases they pay a smaller
percentage of their income as
taxes than the poor do!
Instead of cutting welfare
payments, or not allowing
them to increase to keep up
with inflation, we should ask
that recipients work for their
benefits if they can. For exam
ple, welfare recipients could
be given useful work to do,
while their children could go to
quality, government
supported day-care centers.
There are many things that wel
fare recipients could be doing
which would help the country
a lot — urban renewal, health
care, energy conservation and
solar projects, building pollu
tion control devices and mass
transit systems, etc.
Another inflationary pres
sure is population growth. If
present trends continue, the
U.S. population will grow from
215 to 300 million before
stabilizing, bringing with it a
growth in inflationary con
sumer demands and energy
and resource use.
The United States needs, for
its own good, to have an offi

cial policy encouraging the
achievement of zero popula
tion growth as soon as is feasi
ble. There should be tax incen
tives and welfare bonuses to
smaller families.
Thus, there are many things
which we could be doing to
help alleviate the problems of
inflation and the declining dol
lar— and at the same time help
other problems such as pollu
tion, poverty, unemployment,
shortages, solid waste; crowd
ing and so on. With all the in
telligent scientists and
economists in this country, we
should be demanding more
imaginative programs to attack
these problems before they
plunge us into a new depres
sion or, worse, a new war. We
all need to realize the serious
ness of these problems, and to
work wholeheartedly on solu
tions.
