Senate
defended
I feel a need to even the
score in the ongoing debate
regarding the effectiveness
and wisdom of the ASSU Se
nate's actions th|is year. The
senate appears to be losing
badly. As a student personally
acquainted with several
senators, and therefore the se
nate's activities, I am disturbed
at this one-sidedness.
Admittedly, I bring some
bias to this fracas, instilled in
me by these senator friends.
But for the same reason I also
bring information which has
not seen the light of print all
year.
Yes, thp senate spent an un
fortunate amount of time on
the Bhutto guest professorship
issue. It also overstepped the
bounds of its investigatory
capabilties by commenting,
even to a limited extent, on the
University Med Center billing
problem.
However, the senate has also
expended a large amount of
energy "getting back to the
basics," as promised in one of
its member's campaign. For
example, within the last week,
the Academic Organizations
Board has been shaken off its
complacent behind and com
pletely reorganized to provide
earlierand moreorganized dis
tribution of funds. A subcom
mittee has moved to investi
gate the feasibility of supplying
this campus with one of its
most pressing recreational
needs — lighted tennis courts.
The districting program, at
least in some cases, has finally
forged a communication link
between students and their
representatives. The senate
will soon begin publishing a
newsletter to supplement

these contacts. A Consumer
Affairs Task Force meets
weekly now under the au
spices of the senate in its bid to
make sure that we aren't pay
ing too much or getting too lit
tle at the retail outlets on this
campus.
I commend the senate on
these actions and recommend
that it move faster toward the
completion of these projects
and the initiation of new ones.
At the same time, it should
keep in perspective its position
in the cosmos.
I also commend the Daily for
accurate reporting and re
commend that it move to accu
rately report all the news as
well as investigate carefully
prior to writing editorials. This
will ensure that its significant
influence on student opinion is
exercised with the equity that
I'm sure each of the editors
values.

Eliminate taxation
Doug Bandow's generally il
luminating discussion of the
immorality of taxation (Daily,
)an. 25) unfortunately suffers
from a serious flaw.
Bandow argues persuasively
against allowing government
the unique privilege of obtain
ing its revenues through
legalized theft. But he under
cuts his own argument by
suggesting that taxation is jus
tified for the purpose of na
tional defense.
If Bandow is willing to make
an exception of national dp
fense, by what principle can h?
reject the various other excep
tions — agricultural subsidies,
federal grants for research,
government loans and bailouts

for large and inefficient corpo
rations (e.g., the Lockheed
loan of several years ago), etc.
— which are inevitably de
manded by a myriad of special
interests?
As a practical matter, the
Pentagon's ability to obtain
funds via taxation has in fact
had disastrous consequences.
It was only the power of obtain
ing revenue through legalized
theft that made possible the
American adventure in Viet
nam. The American people
would never have given
enough in voluntary contribu
tions to finance that horrible
debacle.
The current military estab
lishment of this country bears
little resemblance to a military
force devised solely to defend
the lives and liberties of the
American people. Americans
have repeatedly shown them
selves willing to make volun
tary sacrifices when necessary
todefend theirown homes and
country. Surely they would
freely support a minimal de
fense force. Taxation is neces
sary only to support the non
defensive, interventionist
military policy which has
plagued this country in recent
decades.
In short, it would be a good
thing if the Department of De
fense were forced to beg for its
money.
The pruning of government
advocated by intelligent con
servatives such as Bandow is
not enough. What is needed is
a radically libertarian attack on
the roots of coercive govern
ment power. Government
must be stripped of the power
to tax for any purpose what
soever.

Turning point
We salute the Iranian people
for having succeeded in driv
ing from power the Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
The friendship between the
American people and the Ira
nian people will grow only if
our government refrains from
condoning a military coup as a
solution to popular opposition
to the Bakhtiar government. In
this regard, the American gov
ernment should publicly state
that such an alternative, requir
ing as it would the use of
American supplied arms and
aircraft, is unacceptable and
not in the interest of either our
own or the Iranian people. It
should state further that such a
government could not and
would not receive recognition
by this country.
We believe that the fall*of the
shah is a turning point in the
long history of the Iranian
struggle for self
determination, and we believe
further that its lesson for our
government is clear: don't in
terfere in such struggles, be
they in Iran, Chile, the Phil
lipines, South Africa or
elsewhere. Only then will
Americans be regarded as
friends by the people of these
countries.
