## Nelle Byrne Solving abortion naturally 
### 
I don't like seeing the abor
tion issue used repeatedly as
an exercise of the mind or as a
platform of moral indignation
— it stinks as unsympathetic to
the woman with an unwanted
child.
If I, a female undergrad, 22,
withering womb in nature's
eye, budding professional in
my parents' eyes, choose to
scrape my womb dry because I
am pregnant from a voluntary
spurt of another under
graduate's sperm, do I kill?
Yes, in absolute moral terms,
yes. I am responsible for the
killing of a zygote of life. Given
that I was not raped, I am con

scious and responsible for
what an evening with a well
liked friend can conceive. I
know, as any American and
certainly any student here past
the age of 12 knows, that
heterosexual sex can make
babies.
But is the American consci
ence so clean that it can righte
ously pose the question of
whether a woman should have
the right to choose an abor
tion? Can a society that allows
at least 15 percent of its popula
tion to live in poverty seriously
talk about the sanctity of a
human life and label a woman
immoral when she chooses her
own functioning life over the
two handicapped lives of an
unwilling mother with an un
wanted child?
I doubt anyone could seri
ously suggest that a woman
gets pregnant for the sheer
want to kill a life. Abortion is
not the result of premeditated
murder. Instead, when a
woman chooses to abort, at
least symbolically, she's exer
cised a judgment that the cir
cumstances for life are not
good.
This is not an unfamiliar
exercise in nature. The body of
a pregnant, healthy, young
rabbit will call back a con
ceived life when the stress in
her environment is uncom
fortable, when for instance,
her status is low in the group's
social hierarchy.
When I came across this ob
servation in R.M. Lockley's
The Private Life of the Rabbit, I
was fascinated. The cir
cumstances of the rabbit
seemed analogous to a woman
financially unable to support a
child with an otherwise healthy
body. When talking about a
womb, it seemed more decent
to derive a social policy taken
from an example in nature than

from the cerebral dictates of a
rigid, "moral" mind.
Whether we feel that we
have the divine right to termi
nate a life is not a practical
question in this age. We exer
cise that authority regularly —
dramatically in a bomb drop
ped in a war or less consciously
with the "Morning-After" Pill.
Yes, that is a gross analogy, but
no more gross than the argu
ment made by some cerebral
human being that an abortion
is an immoral act and hence
should not be allowed by our
laws.
Do we hack over and over
whether the young man back
from Vietnam is personally
culpable for murder, with him
sitting in class? I think the dis
cussion would be in poor taste,
but is it less callous to hold bat
tle over a woman's womb?
A womb is hardly a
battlefield left overseas, and
certainly it is not unimaginable
to have a woman in a class on
this campus that's faced an
unwanted pregnancy — per
sonally or through a friend.
Obviously, the question of
abortion is usually a tougher
issue for a woman in terms of
gut feelings than in terms of a
cerebral exercise in morality.
Personally, I consider abor
tion a killing — in absolute
terms, a moral wrong. But at
this stage of my life, I cannot
say I would be above the act.
Odd, isn't it? The Bible is right;
to participate in life as a sexual
being, one gets to relinquish
any pretense of innocence.
Vet, when circumstances for
life at certain times are not
good, nature does not intro
duce life. Why can't we allow a
woman the same grace?
