## ERB live petition supported 
### 
The articulate review of the
ERB Report (Daily, Jan. 23-24)
was a welcome change from
the complacent silence it has
suffered so far.
The chronic inadequacies of
the University's student gov
ernment are well
documented. Current discus
sionsof senate reform differ lit
tle from those in previous
years. But they could . . . And
they should.
Last May, after a year of study
and debate, the ASSU Election
Review Board (ERB) presented
to the senate an important
package of reforms. Among
other things, we recom
mended the replacement of
our "one-shot-and-be
damned" election process
with an innovative system of
ongoing representative sup
port.
Yet our report has been put
in the closet, and our "live peti
tion" proposal is being widely
misunderstood, and mostly ig
nored. Thus, we are taking this
opportunity to give it another
push.
The basic problem with our
student government is simple:
it fails to represent. Each Oc
tober, when we cast our votes
we're out of the game. Stu
dents have no ongoing influ
ence on the voicing of their
concerns, and everybody
knows it. Most pay no atten
tion to the process.
We all have a right to vote,
but what is the basis on which
we do so? What do we do if we
don't know any of the candi
dates? What if those we liked
weren't elected? What about if
we're sick that day? Do you feel
it would make any difference?
Elections place little em
phasis on informed choice —
precisely because the informa
tion is unavailable (if not ac
tively misconstrued) at the
time we have to choose. Yet it
is with this system that we
award an effectively irrevoca
ble "tenure" to those who then
(supposedly) represent our
views and spend our money!
How often have you been
approached for an opinion by
one of these "representa
tives," after the election? How
much reliance do you place on
them to forward your con
cerns? Are your senators in
formed of (or even concerned
with) your needs? Do you have
confidence in their intentions?
Have you ever found their

"representation" of "your" in
terests downright embarras
sing?
Almost exactly a year ago,
the ERB decided to call for a
change. Aftera long discussion
of alternatives, we voted
unanimously to propose a new
method for selecting represen
tatives. Rather than getting
"tenure," they should be
ceded only a "power of attor
ney," which would continue
only so long as it is exercised to
their constituents' satisfaction.
How would you like to
choose your most-preferred
senator, and to know that your
choice continues to make a dif
ference? How would you like
to have a say in student's affairs,
through whatever representa
tive most capably expresses
your own concerns? How
would you like to be able to
"fire" your senator in favor of
someone with more promise,
at any time?
Get the basic idea? "Live pet
itions" would be simple, effi
cient and effective. It would
make for a lively political

scene. It would positively
guarantee a balanced rep
resentation of student opin
ion. And it would produce a
most influential senate!
But it takes some perspective
to appreciate the untried
charm of this idea — perspec
tive which is sadly lacking on
the part of our current student
leadership. They still toy with
the same old stuff, apparently
unaware that their "new" idea
of residential districting was
abandoned in failure several
years ago.
So we students must once
again provide the impetus; the
ERB Report was placed in the
Bookstore (at cost) for that
reason.
Read it. Think about it, and
its historical content. Note the
appendices on enactment.
And consider the possibilities
for yourself. We can have, a
voice, if we care enough. "
The alternative is probably
more CRAP.
