# Hospital restrictions on mentally retarded relaxed
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Virtually
all 6058 patients who were
being held against their will in
state hospitals for the mentally
retarded are free to check out
now as the result of a new sur
vey, state officials said Mon
day.
Under strict new standards
limiting involuntary commit
ment to the hospitals, only 66
patients have been kept in that
status, said Paul Carleton, as
sistant manager for regional
centers in the state Develop
mental Services Department.
Most of the others are still in
the hospitals but could choose
to leave at any time, Carleton
said in an interview. So far, 711
have been released.
He said the announcement
doesn't mean a wholesale
exodus from state hospitals,
but it signals a change in direc-

tion for state treatment of the
retarded.
"A few years ago, everybody
thought the mentally retarded
should be committed. But
those people have as many
rights as anybody else," he
said.
The survey was begun two
years ago after a state appeals
court said the state's rules for
involuntary commitment of the
developmentally disabled
were too broad. The court said
only those persons who were
dangerous to themselves or
others should be held against
their will.
At the direction of the Legis
lature, the state's 21 regional
centers evaluated every state
hospital patient who was
committed involuntarily as de
velopmentally disabled.
Nine state hospitals now

house about 10,000 develop
mentally disabled persons, a
category that includes the se
verely retarded, the autistic,
and some who suffer from
cerebral palsy or epilepsy.
As a result of the survey,
Carleton said:
— 711 patients have been
placed in the community by
the regional centers.
— 5129 patients have been
reclassified from involuntary to
voluntary commitment. Of th
ose, 243 have been recom
mended for community
placement.
— 66 have been retained,
with court approval, as in
voluntary commitments, a
status that will be reviewed an
nually.
The other 152 patients died
during the two years, Carleton
said.
