The new Lagunita Court parking lot on the
west end of Santa Teresa Street has recently
been activated, according to John Lerry, project
manager here.
Construction was completed during January
after four months of work, replacing the soft dirt
area that was used previously, Lerry said. He
added that the new $250,000 lot should provide
ample parking for the residents of Lagunita
Court.
Out of the 228 parking spaces, 105 have been
assigned to Lagunita Court residents, according
to Oscar Nelson, master planner for the Univer
sity. This figure is based on the number of regis
tered permits within Lagunita Court and should
meet the resident demand for parking, Nelson
said. The remaining spaces will be allocated for
"C" sticker permits with an additional four

spaces reserved for disabled drivers.
The landscaped area to the west of the new lot
is currently being parked on illegally, Nelson
said. Cars are not being ticketed, however, be
cause there are no signs posted prohibiting the
action. Steve Schmidt, associate planner for the
new lot, said the situation will be remedied
temporarily by a row of logs placed along Santa
Teresa Street, preventing cars from parking on
the landscaped area. There is also a proposal to
extend the curbing along this area, Schmidt
said.
There are over 13,000 parking spaces on cam
pus, according to Nelson.
The lots that have been constructed in recent
years are part of a continued plan to provide
parking around the periphery of the campus, he
added.
