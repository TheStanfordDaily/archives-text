# Orlando Ward
## Freshman eager a team asset 
### Robert Reed 
One of the problems with
basketball, or with sports in
general, is that only so many
people can play at a time. Of
ten, very capable players just
can't seem to get in because
those that are playing are also
capable. But if a player is good
enough, coaches will find a
way to get him in the game.
Freshman forward Orlando
Ward has been good enough.
For most of the season, Ward

and sophomore Jeff Ryan have
been the two frontline subs for
the Cards, each of them sub
bing in and out in a somewhat
modified five big man rotation
along with the usual frontcourt
starters center Tom Schmal
zried and forwards Kimberly
Belton and Brian Welch.
But after two strong games
against Washington State and
Washington, the 6'7" Ward
was given a new role. The
young forward started against

California — at center.
"He had been improving
with each game...had been re
bounding well the past couple
of games (against the
Washington schools)," said
Head Coach Dick Dißiaso, exp
laining his decision to start
Ward. Said Dißiaso, "His time
was increasing. He had been
gaining confidence — it was
time to give him a shot."
Ward's strong rebounding,
tough defense, and aggressive
play have proved instrumental
in the Cards' effort this year.
The young forward's 79 re
bounds and nine blocked
shots ranks him third on the
team in both of these
categories — not too bad for a
person who's only started
three games.
"He's very active around the
glass — at both ends of the
court," said Dißiaso.
But is he active enough to
play center?
"He only plays center when
we're on defense," Dißiaso
said, explaining that Stanford's
passing offense doesn't really
require a center per se, and
that they just go with three
forwards on offense.
On defense, Dißiaso
explained, Stanford often uses
a variety of zones, which
should make Ward's job less
difficult than one might im
agine.
But still, a 6-7 center?
"It's really more of a label
that others put on it," said the
coach, explaining that in Stan
ford's offense any of the big
men could be "called" a
center.
"Orlando played a lot
against Arizona State, and
they're as big as you need to be
to play basketball," said
Ward's coach, discussing the
forward's ability to play against
bigger centers.
But Dißiaso hasn't set his
lineup card yet.
Though Ward has started the
last three games, Dißiaso had
this to say on Ward's future
starting assignments. "I think
the rest of this year it will de
pend on how he's playing and
who we're playing against
(among other things). He
might start a few more games.

It might be Tom Schmalzried.
It's all flexible."
Ward also will continue play
ing forward.
"He (Ward) has given us in
creased flexibility. We can put
him in the game as a forward or
center," said Dißiaso on one ot
Ward's contributions to the
team.
On another of his contribu
tions, Dißiaso said, "Orlando's
a good player, and he's made
the players in front of him a
little better — because he
works so hard in practice."
Speaking of players in front
of him, Ward's style of play (in
side power game) is very simi
lar to that of Cardinal star for
ward Kimberly Belton, and one
might think that these two
could get in each other's way.
Dißiaso responded to this by
saying that, while there have
been problems, "as the season
has progressed, they've begun
to play better together."
Belton apparently is happy
with Ward.
"He's a tough player...lt's
good to have him in there —
you're sure something's going
to happen."
"He's good to have around,"
Belton said.
Ward, who didn't begin play
ing seriously until the ninth
grade, blossomed as a top
player at Los Amigos high
school in Orange County after
being moved (ironically) from
center to forward midway
through his junior year. In his
senior year, he led his team to
the C.I.F. quarter-finals, and
was named first-team All-
Orange County and All-C.I.F.
3A, having single game bests of
33 points and 21 rebounds. The
seventeen-year-old ran track as
a hurdler in high school. He
sanginacampusvocal groupat
the same time. Although he
does not plan to sing at Stan
ford, Ward does enjoy listen
ing to music. But basically, the
young athlete just enjoys hav
ing a good time and goofing
around.
But he never does this in
games.
"When I go out there I'm
going to make things happen,"
said Ward, speaking on his
personal philosophy about the

game. "I go out under the im
pression that I'm going to do
something," Ward said.
Any coach will tell you that
that's a great attitude for a
player to have — particularly
when he's a freshman.
Many freshman ballplayers
are intimidated by the older,
stronger, and often more
talented players they face.
Ward is not.
"They put on the shorts the
same way I do," said the big
man, explaining that while he
himself hasn't been intimi
dated he has employed some
intimidation tactics of his own.
"I try to get the first shot...or
the first check — to show I'm
not intimidated," said Ward, "I
try to go out aggressive so I can
get a bit of an advantage."
Of his first start, Ward said
that, though he was a little
more nervous than usual, he
was "just confident."
"I knew I could do the job,"
he said.
On his induction at center,
Ward said, "I'm fairly comfort
able at the center spot," but,
he conceded, "I don't like it as
much as the forward spot."
While Ward is a likeable fel
low with a great sense of
humor and a great attitude, he
is somewhat sensitive.
Ward wants people to re
member that, while he is a bas
ketball player (and a good
one), he is Orlando Ward.
"I'm a person, not just a bas
ketball player," said Ward.
"People sometimes forget
that."
When asked of his goals,
Ward responded, "The only
goals I have right now are to
play up to my potential and to
improve as much as I can."
Ward isn't always as serious
as his goals would imply.
"I like to haveagood time...l
like to laugh...l like fun," said
Ward, "I trips a little bit."
When an outstanding bas
ketball player combines
Ward's light heart with Ward's
strong mind, the combination
produces a remarkable person
as well as a pretty good athlete.
That all sheds some light on
Kimberly Belton's earlier
statement, "(Orlando Ward) is
good to have around."

A HAND in the fare is one of the best weapons a defensive player can
use, and here Orlando Ward uses this tactic well against Santa Clara's
Kurt Rambis in a game earlier this year. Moments like this are com
mon for Ward, who enjoys intimidating the opposition.
One of the problems with
basketball, or with sports in
general, is that only so many
people can play at a time. Of
ten, very capable players just
can't seem to get in because
those that are playing are also
capable. But if a player is good
enough, coaches will find a
way to get him in the game.
Freshman forward Orlando
Ward has been good enough.
For most of the season, Ward

and sophomore Jeff Ryan have
been the two frontline subs for
the Cards, each of them sub
bing in and out in a somewhat
modified five big man rotation
along with the usual frontcourt
starters center Tom Schmal
zried and forwards Kimberly
Belton and Brian Welch.
But after two strong games
against Washington State and
Washington, the 6'7" Ward
was given a new role. The
young forward started against

California — at center.
"He had been improving
with each game...had been re
bounding well the past couple
of games (against the
Washington schools)," said
Head Coach Dick Dißiaso, exp
laining his decision to start
Ward. Said Dißiaso, "His time
was increasing. He had been
gaining confidence — it was
time to give him a shot."
Ward's strong rebounding,
tough defense, and aggressive
play have proved instrumental
in the Cards' effort this year.
The young forward's 79 re
bounds and nine blocked
shots ranks him third on the
team in both of these
categories — not too bad for a
person who's only started
three games.
"He's very active around the
glass — at both ends of the
court," said Dißiaso.
But is he active enough to
play center?
"He only plays center when
we're on defense," Dißiaso
said, explaining that Stanford's
passing offense doesn't really
require a center per se, and
that they just go with three
forwards on offense.
On defense, Dißiaso
explained, Stanford often uses
a variety of zones, which
should make Ward's job less
difficult than one might im
agine.
But still, a 6-7 center?
"It's really more of a label
that others put on it," said the
coach, explaining that in Stan
ford's offense any of the big
men could be "called" a
center.
"Orlando played a lot
against Arizona State, and
they're as big as you need to be
to play basketball," said
Ward's coach, discussing the
forward's ability to play against
bigger centers.
But Dißiaso hasn't set his
lineup card yet.
Though Ward has started the
last three games, Dißiaso had
this to say on Ward's future
starting assignments. "I think
the rest of this year it will de
pend on how he's playing and
who we're playing against
(among other things). He
might start a few more games.

It might be Tom Schmalzried.
It's all flexible."
Ward also will continue play
ing forward.
"He (Ward) has given us in
creased flexibility. We can put
him in the game as a forward or
center," said Dißiaso on one ot
Ward's contributions to the
team.
On another of his contribu
tions, Dißiaso said, "Orlando's
a good player, and he's made
the players in front of him a
little better — because he
works so hard in practice."
Speaking of players in front
of him, Ward's style of play (in
side power game) is very simi
lar to that of Cardinal star for
ward Kimberly Belton, and one
might think that these two
could get in each other's way.
Dißiaso responded to this by
saying that, while there have
been problems, "as the season
has progressed, they've begun
to play better together."
Belton apparently is happy
with Ward.
"He's a tough player...lt's
good to have him in there —
you're sure something's going
to happen."
"He's good to have around,"
Belton said.
Ward, who didn't begin play
ing seriously until the ninth
grade, blossomed as a top
player at Los Amigos high
school in Orange County after
being moved (ironically) from
center to forward midway
through his junior year. In his
senior year, he led his team to
the C.I.F. quarter-finals, and
was named first-team All-
Orange County and All-C.I.F.
3A, having single game bests of
33 points and 21 rebounds. The
seventeen-year-old ran track as
a hurdler in high school. He
sanginacampusvocal groupat
the same time. Although he
does not plan to sing at Stan
ford, Ward does enjoy listen
ing to music. But basically, the
young athlete just enjoys hav
ing a good time and goofing
around.
But he never does this in
games.
"When I go out there I'm
going to make things happen,"
said Ward, speaking on his
personal philosophy about the

game. "I go out under the im
pression that I'm going to do
something," Ward said.
Any coach will tell you that
that's a great attitude for a
player to have — particularly
when he's a freshman.
Many freshman ballplayers
are intimidated by the older,
stronger, and often more
talented players they face.
Ward is not.
"They put on the shorts the
same way I do," said the big
man, explaining that while he
himself hasn't been intimi
dated he has employed some
intimidation tactics of his own.
"I try to get the first shot...or
the first check — to show I'm
not intimidated," said Ward, "I
try to go out aggressive so I can
get a bit of an advantage."
Of his first start, Ward said
that, though he was a little
more nervous than usual, he
was "just confident."
"I knew I could do the job,"
he said.
On his induction at center,
Ward said, "I'm fairly comfort
able at the center spot," but,
he conceded, "I don't like it as
much as the forward spot."
While Ward is a likeable fel
low with a great sense of
humor and a great attitude, he
is somewhat sensitive.
Ward wants people to re
member that, while he is a bas
ketball player (and a good
one), he is Orlando Ward.
"I'm a person, not just a bas
ketball player," said Ward.
"People sometimes forget
that."
When asked of his goals,
Ward responded, "The only
goals I have right now are to
play up to my potential and to
improve as much as I can."
Ward isn't always as serious
as his goals would imply.
"I like to haveagood time...l
like to laugh...l like fun," said
Ward, "I trips a little bit."
When an outstanding bas
ketball player combines
Ward's light heart with Ward's
strong mind, the combination
produces a remarkable person
as well as a pretty good athlete.
That all sheds some light on
Kimberly Belton's earlier
statement, "(Orlando Ward) is
good to have around."

A HAND in the fare is one of the best weapons a defensive player can
use, and here Orlando Ward uses this tactic well against Santa Clara's
Kurt Rambis in a game earlier this year. Moments like this are com
mon for Ward, who enjoys intimidating the opposition.
One of the problems with
basketball, or with sports in
general, is that only so many
people can play at a time. Of
ten, very capable players just
can't seem to get in because
those that are playing are also
capable. But if a player is good
enough, coaches will find a
way to get him in the game.
Freshman forward Orlando
Ward has been good enough.
For most of the season, Ward

and sophomore Jeff Ryan have
been the two frontline subs for
the Cards, each of them sub
bing in and out in a somewhat
modified five big man rotation
along with the usual frontcourt
starters center Tom Schmal
zried and forwards Kimberly
Belton and Brian Welch.
But after two strong games
against Washington State and
Washington, the 6'7" Ward
was given a new role. The
young forward started against

California — at center.
"He had been improving
with each game...had been re
bounding well the past couple
of games (against the
Washington schools)," said
Head Coach Dick Dißiaso, exp
laining his decision to start
Ward. Said Dißiaso, "His time
was increasing. He had been
gaining confidence — it was
time to give him a shot."
Ward's strong rebounding,
tough defense, and aggressive
play have proved instrumental
in the Cards' effort this year.
The young forward's 79 re
bounds and nine blocked
shots ranks him third on the
team in both of these
categories — not too bad for a
person who's only started
three games.
"He's very active around the
glass — at both ends of the
court," said Dißiaso.
But is he active enough to
play center?
"He only plays center when
we're on defense," Dißiaso
said, explaining that Stanford's
passing offense doesn't really
require a center per se, and
that they just go with three
forwards on offense.
On defense, Dißiaso
explained, Stanford often uses
a variety of zones, which
should make Ward's job less
difficult than one might im
agine.
But still, a 6-7 center?
"It's really more of a label
that others put on it," said the
coach, explaining that in Stan
ford's offense any of the big
men could be "called" a
center.
"Orlando played a lot
against Arizona State, and
they're as big as you need to be
to play basketball," said
Ward's coach, discussing the
forward's ability to play against
bigger centers.
But Dißiaso hasn't set his
lineup card yet.
Though Ward has started the
last three games, Dißiaso had
this to say on Ward's future
starting assignments. "I think
the rest of this year it will de
pend on how he's playing and
who we're playing against
(among other things). He
might start a few more games.

It might be Tom Schmalzried.
It's all flexible."
Ward also will continue play
ing forward.
"He (Ward) has given us in
creased flexibility. We can put
him in the game as a forward or
center," said Dißiaso on one ot
Ward's contributions to the
team.
On another of his contribu
tions, Dißiaso said, "Orlando's
a good player, and he's made
the players in front of him a
little better — because he
works so hard in practice."
Speaking of players in front
of him, Ward's style of play (in
side power game) is very simi
lar to that of Cardinal star for
ward Kimberly Belton, and one
might think that these two
could get in each other's way.
Dißiaso responded to this by
saying that, while there have
been problems, "as the season
has progressed, they've begun
to play better together."
Belton apparently is happy
with Ward.
"He's a tough player...lt's
good to have him in there —
you're sure something's going
to happen."
"He's good to have around,"
Belton said.
Ward, who didn't begin play
ing seriously until the ninth
grade, blossomed as a top
player at Los Amigos high
school in Orange County after
being moved (ironically) from
center to forward midway
through his junior year. In his
senior year, he led his team to
the C.I.F. quarter-finals, and
was named first-team All-
Orange County and All-C.I.F.
3A, having single game bests of
33 points and 21 rebounds. The
seventeen-year-old ran track as
a hurdler in high school. He
sanginacampusvocal groupat
the same time. Although he
does not plan to sing at Stan
ford, Ward does enjoy listen
ing to music. But basically, the
young athlete just enjoys hav
ing a good time and goofing
around.
But he never does this in
games.
"When I go out there I'm
going to make things happen,"
said Ward, speaking on his
personal philosophy about the

game. "I go out under the im
pression that I'm going to do
something," Ward said.
Any coach will tell you that
that's a great attitude for a
player to have — particularly
when he's a freshman.
Many freshman ballplayers
are intimidated by the older,
stronger, and often more
talented players they face.
Ward is not.
"They put on the shorts the
same way I do," said the big
man, explaining that while he
himself hasn't been intimi
dated he has employed some
intimidation tactics of his own.
"I try to get the first shot...or
the first check — to show I'm
not intimidated," said Ward, "I
try to go out aggressive so I can
get a bit of an advantage."
Of his first start, Ward said
that, though he was a little
more nervous than usual, he
was "just confident."
"I knew I could do the job,"
he said.
On his induction at center,
Ward said, "I'm fairly comfort
able at the center spot," but,
he conceded, "I don't like it as
much as the forward spot."
While Ward is a likeable fel
low with a great sense of
humor and a great attitude, he
is somewhat sensitive.
Ward wants people to re
member that, while he is a bas
ketball player (and a good
one), he is Orlando Ward.
"I'm a person, not just a bas
ketball player," said Ward.
"People sometimes forget
that."
When asked of his goals,
Ward responded, "The only
goals I have right now are to
play up to my potential and to
improve as much as I can."
Ward isn't always as serious
as his goals would imply.
"I like to haveagood time...l
like to laugh...l like fun," said
Ward, "I trips a little bit."
When an outstanding bas
ketball player combines
Ward's light heart with Ward's
strong mind, the combination
produces a remarkable person
as well as a pretty good athlete.
That all sheds some light on
Kimberly Belton's earlier
statement, "(Orlando Ward) is
good to have around."
