# Fellows mold family life, work and dorm together

"There are times," Jim Fox, resi
dent fellow in Rinconada, states, "in
every resident fellow's life that are
trying to your professional life and
family life." Bob Maddix, resident
fellow in Toyon Hall, categorizes the
problem as a "time conflict." Bob
Hamrdla, of Larkin House, concurs,
saying, "One could spend 24 hours a
day as a resident fellow and probably
not do enough." And Orrin "Rob"
Robinson (the RF in Lagunita West
Court), muses that the "official re
sponsibilities don't take the time;
what takes the time is the fun part."
In some ways, the responsibilities
fit in together well: not having to
cook, shop, or do yard work saves
time, and, as Kathy Durham, resident
fellow in Arroyo House with her hus
band Bill, points out, "It's enjoyable
for both of us to share that time with
the students." A considerable
number of resident fellows have
young children living with them in
the dormitory. All report the experi
ence to be a good influence gener
ally on their children.
The resident fellow contends with
various problems. Hamrdla says it is
difficult to strike a balance between
allowing students to go their own
way while achieving broader goals of
establishing educational and intel
lectual possibilities in University re
sidences. He adds that dealing with
some students is difficult â€” while
some are considerate, others are
not. Similarly, Robinson asserts the
difficulty of dealing with people who
don't care about property or other
people in the community. Resident
fellows must also sacrifice a degree
of their privacy.
Larger dorms
There is the difficulty of tending
the larger dorms. The student
resident fellow interaction is to a cer
tain extent replaced, or at least al
tered, by a greater reliance on the
resident staff to serve as inter
mediaries between student and resi
dent fellow.
Maddix explains that he "ends up
working through them (house as

sociates, RAs) most of the time," and
interacts with them as an RA usually
interacts with the students. This or
ganization is utilized by many of the
fellows in the larger residences.
Resident fellows must adopt diffe
rent roles, depending on the type of
dorm they live in. Freshman houses,
for example, require extra emphasis
in certain areas, such as advising.
Hamrdla suggests that it's necessary
to be "watching out for the person
who's gotten into perceived
academic problems," who needs en
couragement and "help finding his
own academic pace."
Higher energy level
Additionally, the resident fellow in
freshman dorms must adjust his role
to meet the more energetic level of
activity among students, yet at the
same time usually has less trouble
bringing the residents into a close
knit group. The Durhams remark that
they particularly enjoy the energy
emanating from a freshman dorm.
However, Robinson points out
that freshmen in a four-class dorm
tend to become "integrated in the
Stanford community instead of in
tegration in their freshman dorm."
Theme houses further alter the
role of the resident fellow. Art
Pacheco, assistant professor at the
School of Education, and resident
fellow in Casa Zapata, for example,
notes that, "As much as you can
generalize about the role of resident
fellows, the fellow in a theme house
must perform all of the duties of any
other fellow," and in addition be
concerned with theme-related ac
tivities: additional counseling, edu
cational programming which takes
into account the cultural aspects of
the residence, and connecting the
house and its activities to the larger
minority community.
Pacheco implements this role by
teaching a class with some of the staff
members on the significance of race
and class in the University and soci
ety in general. Pacheco also says that
"there is often too quick a tendency
to analyze a problem as the result of
the fact that it occurs in a theme
house."

The rewards from the resident fel
low experience appear to "outweigh
the aggravations," as Mark Mancall,
a resident fellow in Florence Moore
Hall asserts. Interacting with stu
dents, participating in dorm and
campus activities, and making con
siderable friendships with students
and staff are frequently cited by the
resident fellows as justifications for
continuing in their positions.
Fox believes that "to get to know
that many students is really a
privilege." Michel and Pat Nabti of
Trancos, say that it's "nice to have 90
friendly neighbors." Durham adds
that "contact with undergraduates
with very different perspectives, di
versity of interests and energy," is a
motivating and rewarding consequ
ence of the job.
Scott Pearson, fellow in Madera,
believes that "if people knew the re
wards," they would be more in
terested in the job. He sums up the
feeling of many resident fellows: "If
you're going to make your career in
an academic community, you should
get a good understanding of all parts
of that community."
