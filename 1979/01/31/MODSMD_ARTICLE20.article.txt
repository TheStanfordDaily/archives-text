# Skiers plagued by pre-season injuries

### Liz Schermer 
Though plagued by injuries to several top racers, the Stanford
ski team managed a fairly strong showing in the season's first
race. The team competed in the Vanderbilt Cup, held at Heavenly
Valley and Squaw Valley last weekend.
The women's alpine and nordic teams placed second in the
overall competition behind the University of Nevada-Reno. In the
giant slalom on Friday, team co-captain Andrea Dewey skii'ed to a
fifth place after breaking her thumb in training earlier that day.
Teammate Liz Schermer placed seventh, with co-captain Barb
Lycan only .8 seconds behind in eighth position. With Dewey
unable to race in Saturday's slalom, the women garnered third
place on the icy couse, with Lycan, Schermer and Jane Ratchye
placing seventh, ninth and eleventh, respectively.
The women's cross country team had a strong race at Squaw
Valley on Saturday. Despite snow storm conditions, the team
raced close behind top racers from Nevada-Reno and Berkeley.
On the five kilometer course, Clare Phillips came in fifth, fol
lowed by Ann Gail in sixth and Adele Ho in eighth place.
Accodring to captain Howard Rosen, part of the reason for the
team's weakness is the lack of training time on snow. This makes
it difficult for then to keep up with teams such as Nevada.
The men's alpine team had to ski hard to overcome the loss of
number one racer Wally Krengel who suffered a separated shoul
der in an accident last week. The team placed fifth in the competi
tion, behind Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) powerhouse
Nevada-Reno, with Berkeley, Sierra College and Davis rounding
out the top four.
Top finishers for the Cards in the giant slalom were senior Dave
Kelble in the eleventh spot and freshman Blake Jorgenson in
fifteenth. On the more difficult slalom course, first-seed Kelble
disqualified by missing a gate, but Jorgenson finished eight,
freshman Hal Harvey was eleventh and co-captain Howie Rosen
placed fifteenth. With Krengel out for the rest of the season, the
team will be depending on top-seeded Kelble for consistent high
place finishes.
Hampered by a heavy snowstorm on Saturday at Squaw Valley,
the men's nordic team skiied to a fifth place in the ten kilometer
race. Official individual results were unavailable at publication
time, but top three finishers for Stanford were Curtis Bonlm,
Kelley Foster and Bill Fox. The cross country racers are also hurt
by the temporary loss of Rob Lipton, who is out with a broken
thumb incurred in training.
The jumping team fared well on Sunday at Squaw Valley's 35
meter jump, despite the absence of captain Dave Parker. Mike
Grace placed fifth and Vic Haverly was tenth in their first col
legiate jumping competition.
The ski team's next race is the NCII at Donner Ski Ranch on Feb.
2, 3, 4.
