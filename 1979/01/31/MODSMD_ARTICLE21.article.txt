Had the first game of last night's men's vol
leyball match against Santa Clara been any indi
cation of what the next two games would be like,
the Cardinals might very well have set a new
record for the shortest volleyball match in his
tory. They didn't.
Although it was hardly a "squeaker," it ap
peared at first that it would be a "blow-out." The
Cards did walk away with a convincing 15-5,
15-12,15-8 victory which Coach Fred Sturm cal
led "a good group effort for this early in the
season," but it looked at first like it might have
come a little easier than it did.
"The line-up we had in the first game played
very well together," Sturm said. Junior Rod
Fletcher and freshman Kip Engen came up with
several key blocks and junior Tom Grimes
added a few devastating spikes to bury the
Broncos in the initial game.
In the second game Sturm replaced Grimes
and middle blocker Kim Lum with senior hitter
Rich Vardley and junior middle blocker Jack
Foxworth.
"The total output in the second game wasn't
as good as it was in the first," Sturm said. "It
wasn't necessarily the players, the team just
wasn't working together as well. Plus Santa
Clara did play better in the second game. You

have to remember that."
The third game brought even more lineup
changes which yielded what appeared to be a
more efficient unit. This final game saw no long
scoring sprees by either team. Rather, the Cards
slowly plugged away at the Bronco defense,
finding its weaknesses and gaining momentum.
"We will be better organized and more effi
cient in time," Sturm said. "Right now we are
working very hard and I think tonight's match
was a good effort."
Sturm was especially pleased with the play of
Engen, who he indicated was "coming along
fine." Sturm also noted that Fletcher and the
rest of the middle attack were doing very well.
"The team is improving," he said, "and is be
ginning to do things more intentionally, which is
good."
The Cardinals, now 2-0, will open their con
ference schedule against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo Feb. 9. Both Stanford and Cal Poly are
newcomers in the California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association, the toughest college con
ference in the country.
According to Sturm, Cal Poly will be the same
team the Cards faced last year. They were first in
their league last year, and just missed a spot in
the regionals to San Diego State in a playoff
match.
