# Cards doused
## 
### 
Freezing rain put a freeze
on the start of the 1979 pre
season for the Stanford
baseball team yesterday af
ternoon.
After a two hour bus ride
and an hour of batting prac
tice in the cruel tempera
tures and driving rain of
Stockton, the Cardinals'
first game of '79 to be played
against the University of the
Pacific, was postponed.
The Cards have re
scheduled the game with
the Tigers of UOP for April
18 — well after league play
begins — at Oak Park in
Stockton.

With yesterday's wash
out, Sunken Diamond be
comes the site of Stanford's
pre-season opener this year.
This Friday, the Cards will
take on the University of
Nevada-Reno at home in the
renovated Sunken
Diamond at 2:30 p.m.
Sophomore Paul Grame
and senior Bruce Fiala, the
two right handers who were
slated to pitch yesterday,
will split the mound duties
on Friday.
Saturday, Cal State Uni
versity at Humboldt comes
to Stanford for a doub
leheader beginning at
noon.
