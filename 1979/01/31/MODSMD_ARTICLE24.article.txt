Teng urges peaceful resolution
Washington — Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping
was reported yesterday to have declared that
China wants a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan
issue, but "cannot commit herself not to resort" to
the use of force.
The account of Teng's remarks at a Senate lunc
heon came from a senator who took notes.
Another senator, Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), quoted
the Chinese leader as saying, "You can rely on our
assurance that we don't intend to use force," and
that "there has been no discussion of boycott"
against Taiwan.
The senator who made notes declined the use of
his name. His notes quoted Teng as saying:
"We will permit the present system on Taiwan
and way of life to remain unchanged. We will allow
the local government of Taiwan to maintain
people-to-people relations with other people, like
Japan and the United States.
"With this policy, we believe we can achieve
peaceful reunification, like you, we want to re
solve the issue by peaceful means. We (Chinese)
have patience. However, China cannot commit
herself not to resort to other means because if we
did it would not be beneficial to peaceful reunifi
cation."
Iran accepts Khomeini's return
Tehran, Iran — The government said yesterday
that Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini, the architect of
the Iranian uprising, could return to Iran, and gave
Air France permission to fly him from his Parisian
exile to an expected triumphant reentry in his
homeland.
The American Embassy meanwhile ordered U.S.
government dependents out of Iran "at the ear
liest feasible date" after attacks on three Ameri
cans.
Millions are expected to greet the 78-year-old
Khomeini when he returns, possibly tomorrow, to
press his campaign to oust the constitutional
monarchy headed by Prime Minister Shahpour
Bakhtiar and set up an Islamic republic. Khomeini
led the uprising that forced Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi to leave the country for what many feel is
permanent exile.
There was scattered violence in Tehran yester
day but no reports of casualties.
Khomeini is expected to name an Islamic re
volutionary count il upon arrival, and to outline his
proposals for an Islamic state during a speech at
the cemetery where many victims of the past year
of anti-shah rioting are buried.
Pope calls tor war on illiteracy
Guadalajara, Mexico — Pope John Paul II ap
pealed for a war on illiteracy yesterday, and asked
the wealthy to forsake "some of what is theirs" to
promote social justice and help the poor live a
little better.
"It is impossible to remain indifferent to the

serious problem of illiteracy and semi-illiteracy,"
he said.
"With all my might, I invite all those who feel
Christian to renew themselves in their minds and
hearts and — even forsaking some of what is theirs
— promote greater justice so that none can lack
adequate nourishment, clothing, housing, culture
and employment," the pope said. He spoke to
workers in one of the poorer districts of Guadalaj
ara, Mexico's second largest city, 290 miles north
west of Mexico City.
The pontiff came to Mexico to open the Third
Conference of Latin American Bishops in Puebla,
75 miles south of the capital.
In his address, the pope rejected the so-called
"theology of liberation" widely supported by the
Latin clergy who seek a greater role in promoting
social justice and human rights in Latin America.
The pope advised against political and social
activism for the clergy, but has repeatedly expres
sed sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden.
Students return after killings
San Diego — A few minutes before the children
started filing back 'nto Cleveland Elementary
School yesterday, a playground supervisor knelt
on the sidewalk to ciean away the bloodstains.
The flag was flying at half mast.
Twenty-four hours earlier, Brenda Spencer, a
16-year-old sniper, holed up in a house across the
street had opened tire with a .22 caliber rifle, kil
ling the principal and the janitor and wounding
nine others, including eight children.
Six of the eight wounded students were treated
and released, but two 9-year-old girls remained in
serious condition.
Last summer Spencer was arrested tor shooting
out the Cleveland school's windows with a B-B
gun.
Spencer, described by a girlfriend as "crazy
about guns," was being held at Juvenile Hall while
law enforcement officials decided what charges to
file and whether she will be prosecuted as an adult
or a juvenile. It may be several days before a deci
sion is made.
Teachers went ahead with their regular class
plans Tuesday, but much of the time was spent
trying to explain the violence of the day before.
Hearst to leave prison tomorrow
San Francisco — After nearly five years of terror,
flight, legal battles and millions of dollars in ex
penses, Patricia Hearst's family is preparing a
happy welcome for the kidnap victim turned bank
robber.
Hearst, whose prison sentence was commuted
Monday by President Jimmy Carter after she had
served 23 months on a bank robbery conviction, is
set to leave the Federal Correctional Institution at
Pleasanton tomorrow, four days before the fifth
anniversary of her kidnapping by members of the
Symbionese Liberation Army.
After her release from prison, Hearst plans to do

volunteer work for a feminist group, educating
women about their legal rights, says Gloria Allred,
president ot Women's Equal Rights Legal Defense
and Education Fund.
Snow falls on Bay Area hills
As much as two inches of snow fell on the moun
tains and hills in Northern California yesterday,
closing a number ot roads and Mt. Diablo State
Park near San Francisco.
The snow came as part of a cold, moist unstable
air mass which drifted down from the Pacific
Northwest.
In the San Francisco Bay Area, snow was re
ported on Mt. Tamalpais in Marin County and in
Oakland's Tilden Park. Among the other areas
which had snow were Skyline Ridge south of San
Francisco, the Santa Cruz Mountains and all of the
coastal mountains around the Bay Area.
Record trade deficit reported
Washington — The United States ended 1978
with a record foreign trade deficit of $28.45 billion,
a mass of red ink that undermined the dollar dur
ing most of the year.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday
that the detic it in December was $2.04 billion, up
slightly from $ 1.95 billion in November. The deficit
for all of 1978 tupped the previous high of $26.5
billion in 1977. And the buy-and-sell ledger
finished on the minus side despite a reduction in
U.S. imports of foreign oil.
As a consequence of the relatively poor U.S.
position in the international marketplace — the
huge imbalance of imports over exports — the
dollar was sent into a tailspin last year.
A major cause of the huge trade deficits of the
past two years, officials said, was that the U.S.
economy grew faster than economies of other
major trading nations, so fhe United States sucked
up foreign goods like a vacuum cleaner.
Market falls; interest rates ease
New York — The stock market declined for the
second straight session yesterday, failing to re
spond to new signs of a slight easing in interest
rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials posted a
$.99 loss at 851.78, to go with Monday's 3.98-point
drop. The daily tally on the New York Stock Ex
change showed about four declines for every
three stocks that gained ground.
Volume on the Big Board came to 25.91 million
shares, up from 24.17 million Monday.
Cold, rainy weather predicted
Showers likely today. Partly cloudy with a
chance of showers tonight. Partly cloudy tomor
row. Continued cool. Lows 30s to low 40s. Highs
low to mid-50s. Chance of rain 60 percent today
and 30 percent tonight.
