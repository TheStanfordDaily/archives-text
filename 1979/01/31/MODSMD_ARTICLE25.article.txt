# Thief takes terminals from computer center
## 
### Matt Mettler 
Two computer terminals were sto
len Thursday from the Stanford
Center for Information Processing
(SCIP) in Pine Hall, according to
Peter Vesanovic, manager ot net
work services for SCIP.
The thief apparently disconnected
the terminals and simply carried the
equipment out ot the building. The
terminals were probably stolen in the
early hours ot the morning, but the
theft was not discovered until after
noon, when it became clear that the
terminals had not simply been
moved, Vesanovic said.
The last theft of this type occurred
about six months ago, Vesanovic
said.
Mike Roberts, deputy director of
SCIP, said he felt the center "should
consider limiting user access only as
a last resort."
He said that if SCIP were a private
business, its facilities would proba
bly be closed at night and patrolled
by security guards. "I he community
here, however, likes to have access
to the computers at all hours, he
said.
"We try to be as flexible as possible
in arranging for user access,"
Roberts said. SCIP and the Low
Overhead Time-Sharing computer

facility (LOTS) are both under pres
sure to have terminals in more areas
such as dormitories, he said. But this
would add to the problem of theft,
he added.
A few years ago theft of computer
terminals wasn't much of a problem,
Roberts said, because almost no one
would buy stolen terminals for re
sale. The tremendous growth in the
retail market for home computers,
however, has meant a parallel
growth in the number of retailers
who are willing to deal in stolen
computer ware, he explained.
One solution to the problem,
Roberts said, would be to bolt the
terminals to their tables, so they can
not easily be carried off.
