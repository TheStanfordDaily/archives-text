# Professor advises caution in U.S.-Chinese relations
## 
### Susan Essoyan 
Harry Harding, assistant professor
of political science here, urged
Americans to be cautious in their
new relationship with the People's
Republic of China in a luncheon
speech at the Bechtel International
Center yesterday.
Maoist supporters delayed the
speech, condemning Chinese Vice
Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, as a "mur
derer" and a traitor to Mao Tse
tung's revolutionary ideals. Teng is
now visiting the United States.
Harding did not comment on
Teng's alleged betrayal, concentrat
ing instead on the impact of normali
zation on future U.S.-China rela
tions.
Opportunities, risks
Harding encouraged Americans to
make the most of the "enormous
opportunities" available to

strengthen the relationship but
stressed the risks involved.
He emphasized the need for more
than an "arm's length" relationship.
Americans should welcome China's
emergence into international affairs
as a "long-term stabilizing force," be
cause without China's active partici
pation, global problems such as arms
control and the world economy can
not be solved, he said.
However, Harding advised against
overt alliance with China.
The "Sino-Japanese-American en
tente" directed against the Soviet
Union, which Teng apparently pro
motes, is not in the American in
terest, according to Harding.
Citing cyclical swings by China to
and from the West in the past, Hard
ing cautioned against too close a re
lationship.
Wholesale importation of foreign

technology of the kind China re
ceived from the Soviet Union in the
1950s often leads to domestic reac
tion against the foreign values that
inevitably enter with foreign exper
tise, Harding said.
The United States must prevent an
Iran-type situation by avoiding overly
close ties to a government that may
be found to be unstable later, he
said.
Harding also warned that the Un
ited States must be sure it knows
what it is doing with respect to the
Soviet Union.
U.S.-Soviet relations
Although American policy toward
the two nations is now "evenhanded
in theory," Harding said that there
have been instances where the Un
ited States gave China civilian
technology which might not have
been approved for the Soviet Union.
China wants to purchase weapons
from West Germany and the United
States but "our relationship is much
too young and fragile" to allow this,
Harding said. He warned that it
would be naive to assume that
American and Chinese interests are
identical.
Taiwan issue
"Our interests do compete, if not
conflict," he said, citing Korea and
Taiwan as examples. Normalization
has not solved the Taiwan issue,
Harding said. The legal foundation
for future Taiwan-American relations
and sale of arms to Taiwan pose prob
lems, he added.
The United States bases ;ts policy
toward China on the expectation of
peace and stability in the Taiwan
Straits, Harding said. But the possi
bility of disruption of the "loose
equilibrium" remains.
Harding said the United States
should do nothing with regard to
Taiwan beyond reiterating the
American desire for a peaceful solu
tion. The history of American media
tion in China has not been success
ful, according to Harding.
Trade with the People's Republic
may be another source of friction,
Harding said. Economic relations be
tween the United States and China
are "not normal," according to Hard
ing.
