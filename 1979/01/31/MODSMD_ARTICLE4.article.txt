# Shcharansky to mail moves from jail
## Soviet dissident may play postal chess 
### Nancy Koehn 
Stanford Hillel, in conjunction with the Bay Area
Council on Soviet Jewry, is recruiting chess Pias
ters to play postal chess with imprisoned Russian
dissident Anatoly Shcharansky.
According to Brian Rosman, chairman of the
Stanford Committee on Oppressed Jewry and di
rector of the campus recruiting effort, the purpose
of the chess games is "to let Shcharansky know
that there are people outside who care about
him." Hillel members also hope to attract publicity
about Shcharansky's imprisonment.
Originally conceived by staffers at the Bay Area
council, the idea of establishing postal chess
games with Shcharansky is gaining momentum,
and Jewish organizations nationwide are search
ing for interested and competent chess players,
said Rossman. The United Chess Federation has
also been contacted and is aware of the council's
search.
Longer moves
Postal chess games can take a long time to com
plete as moves must be mailed individually bet
ween opponents. Each move in the proposed
game with Shcharansky will take several weeks or
longer.
According to Regina Waldman, director of the
Bay Area council, Shcharansky's U.S. opponent
will begin the game by mailing the first move to

Avital Shcharansky, the prisoner's wife, in Israel.
She will then relay the move to her husband in a
letter. The move will be sent to Shcharansky's
mother, Ida Milgram, in Moscow, who will also
attempt to send the move to her son.
There is no assurance that Shcharansky, impris
oned in Chistopol Prison in the Tatar Republic, will
actually receive the letters his mother and wife
send him. Located approximately 800 miles east of
Moscow, the prison is well-known for its strict
censorship of prisoners' mail. As Rosman
explained, "Lots of mail doesn't go through at all."
'Humanitarian'
Although several of Avital Shcharansky's letters
to her husband have been confiscated by prison
officials, Hillel members are optimistic about the
planned games with Shcharansky.
Rosman stated, "I think they (the letters) have a
good chance of going through since they are
humanitarian, not political, in nature."
Arrested on March 15, 1977, Shcharansky is a
chess master who reportedly can play five games
of chess simultaneously and win them all. Prior to
his trial in July 1978, Shcharansky devised and
played simulated computer games. He also has
two chess books with him in prison which he reads
avidly, Rosman said.
These two books were not confiscated by prison

officials leading Hi I lei and Bay Area council mem
bers to believe that postal chess moves may also
get through to Shcharansky.
One or more postal chess games would give
Shcharansky something to do "and help him keep
from going insane," said Rosman. Waldman re
ported that many prisoners pla\ chess to keep
their minds occupied.
Public attention
Hillel and Bay Area council members also hope
to draw public attention to Shcharansky and his
incarceration through the chess games.
Several Jewish organizations are actively pro
testing Shcharansky's imprisonment. Hillel and
the Stanford Committee on Oppressed )ewry are
sponsoring a large rally on March 15, the second
anniversary of Shcharansky's arrest. The Union of
Councils for Soviet Jewry, a national organization,
has elicited support from various Congressmen.
Several of these legislators have written letters to
Soviet officials protesting the dissident's incarcer
ation.
Avital Shcharansky has been active in opposing
her husband's imprisonment. According to
Waldman, "She is very enthusiastic about the
proposed chess games." Mrs. Shcharansky is ten
tatively planning a trip to Northern California next
month.
