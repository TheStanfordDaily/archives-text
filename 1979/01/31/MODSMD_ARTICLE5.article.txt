# Membership doubles in three years
## Asian women's group expanding projects 
### Liz Schermer 
From its beginning here three
years ago as a small group of women
writing a journal for Asian American
women, the Asian American Wo
men's Croup (AAWG) has more than
doubled in membership, and
broadened its focus to include com
munity service projects.
According to Kathy Ko, a member
of the group, AAWG is on its way to
becoming an important source of
support and communication for
Asian American women in the Uni
versity community.
In the spring of 1976 a group of
women based in lunipero, the Asian
American theme house, published a
journal, Asian American Women.
The journal contained fiction,

poetry, interviews and articles by and
about Asian American women. The
next year, three undergraduates of
the journal's staff, Julie Hatta,
Dorothy Munehiro and Alice Ito, cal
led a meeting to organize publication
of another issue.
According to Ko, there was such a
large response that they decided to
hold discussions and reading groups
in order to get better acquainted.
"The journal project went by the
wayside," said Ko.
Membership larger
Though attendance at the first year
of meetings ranged from as few as
three to nearly 15 members, the
membership has grown in the past
two years to over 40 women, nearly
20 percent of the 242 Asian American

undergraduate and graduate women
enrolled here. According to Ko, at
least a dozen women consistently at
tend the weekly meetings in the
lunipero lounge.
Rotating chair
AAWG has a rotating chairwoman
position for its meetings and all
members share responsibilities for
activities, Ko said. The group is sepa
rate from the Asian American Stu
dents Association (AASA). It formally
registered with the ASSU in the
spring of 1977. Since then its mem
bers have been formulating goals
and a constitution.
Symposium
As its first project, AAWG co
sponsored a symposium entitled
"Sexual Violence Against Minority

Women" in the spring of 1977. Since
then the group has published a spe
cial women's issue of Winds, the
Asian American newsmagazine,
conducted a series of sherry hours
for the Asian community, and co
sponsored an assertiveness training
workshop.
Currently, the organization helps
to run the Asian American Resource
Center, and holds monthly potluck
dinners in addition to weekly meet
ings, reading and discussion groups.
Last quarter AAWG conducted a
well-attended trip to Angel Island,
the immigration center of the early
1900s where many Asians were de
tained and interrogated before being
allowed to enter the United States.
