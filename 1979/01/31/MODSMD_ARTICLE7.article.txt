u
Sacramento (AP) — Legis
lation to bolster the "use a
gun, go to prison" law was
shelved for 30 days by an As
sembly committee Monday
because of the possibility
the state Supreme Court
will reconsider its Tanner
decision.
That ruling said a 1975
mandatory-prison law
didn't prevent judges from
granting probation to gun
using felons in exceptional
cases.
"Testimony may be pre
mature," Assemblyman Bill
McVittie (D-Chino), chair
man of the Assembly Crimi
nal (ustice Committee, told
witnesses waiting to testify

at a hearing. "The Tanner
decision may be modified,
may be reversed."
The decision was
scheduled to become final
Jan. 22, but the court, in an
unusual move, has ex
tended the deadline for pet
itions for rehearing until
Feb. 20. Last week, 68 of the
119 legislators asked the
court to reconsider its rul
ing.
The Tanner decision was
reached on a 4-3 vote. Th ree
justices said the law didn't
prohibit judges from grant
ing probation, and a fourth,
Chief justice Rose Bird, said
the law unconstitutionally
intruded onto judges' au
thority to grant probation.
