# Gospel Choir brings students together
## 
### Wanda Ravernell 
Sitting by her desk, Easter
Renay Miller, was
thump...thump...thumping
with her foot, while that alto
moan deep in her throat came
forth making itself known.
"Making it real," Miller
said...
Carol Bussey spoke softly,
but sang out to be heard. An
enthusiastic alto, she sat for
ward in the easy chair in Mil
ler's room, losing her place in
the book on her lap, the pencil
in her hand hanging loose.
"God has...smiled on me."
"Making it real," Miller
said...
While the others sang once
through the chorus, Kathleen
Saunders listened for her note.
"Okay, I've got it," she said.
"Do it again: Her soprano
swung high over the altos, then
the voices blended harmoni
cally. What the song was saying
in words didn't matter. Listen
ing to the voices, to the music,
was enough.
"Making it real," Miller
said...

"I finally got to prove I could
sing, just a little bit," Miller, a
Stanford gospel choir member
said. "Maybe, back home you
wanted to sing, but you didn't
think you had the ability...or
you had somebody turn
around and say to you, 'You're
flat, Renay.' Well, here a lot of
us sing flat. We (the Gospel
Choir) came together out of a
desire to do something to
gether, came together looking
for something that had been in
our pasts."
In trying to coordinate the
choir last fall, the biggest prob
lem was in finding an accom
panist and a director. "There
were people who had
background in Bach, Schubert
and Brahms, but not in gos
pel," Miller said.
Then Saunders heard of a
freshman named Janice O'Neil
who could play piano. The
daughter of a Methodist minis
ter, O'Neil grew up in the tradi
tion of gospel music. She
won a $1000 cash prize, which
was shared with her sister and
two friends when their group,

The Revelations, entered the
California State Fair Black Ta
lent Contest. She has played
the keyboards since child
hood.
Before the Gospel Choir,
O'Neil said, "I didn't have an
opportunity to express myself
through gospel music as I'd
been used to doing every Sun
day morning."
Singing the gospel is very
important to Bussey. "The best
way I communicate to people
is through singing. I love the
harmony. It's uplifting to hear
all the voices blend together.
Sometimes I feel better just by
having been there."
Spending her childhood in
the "Bible Belt" in Texas,
where going to church every
Sunday was a must, Miller said
she often got her "message"
through the gospel music in
stead of the pastor's sermon.
Finding that she missed
church and gospel music when
her family moved to California,
Miller said she looked for a way
to fill the void. "Being at Stan
ford is not real. The gospel as

something from our past is a
step toward making it real.
Singing together is true fellow
ship."
"The choir is mostly black
folks," Bussey said, "but origi
nally white students were in it,
too. And there were Baptists
and Catholics — anybody who
could relate to the music."
"The most basic characteris
tic of gospel music is that there
are no restrictions. One can
add a touch of jazz here, a bit of
blues here, and a bit of ragtime
there, all in one gospel selec
tion," O'Neil said.
Saunders said she liked the
traveling. "It keeps me in
touch with what's going on
with black people. Older
people give you advice and in
vite you over to dinner. It's like
a big embrace. Vou get beyond
all that intellectualism on cam
pus. It's a feeling of love. That's
what makes it real."
There are 25-40 students in
the choir, "but it varies on
when the performance comes
in relation to midterms," Miller
said. "That's reality, also."

The Stanford Gospel Choir performed last night in the Donner dining room in Stern Hall. According to
choir member Renay Miller, the choir "came together out of a desire to do something together." The

While the others sang once
through the chorus, Kathleen
Saunders listened for her note.
"Okay, I've got it," she said.
"Do it again: Her soprano
swung high over the altos, then
the voices blended harmoni
cally. What the song was saying
in words didn't matter. Listen
ing to the voices, to the music,
was enough.
"Making it real," Miller
said...

"I finally got to prove I could
sing, just a little bit," Miller, a
Stanford gospel choir member
said. "Maybe, back home you
wanted to sing, but you didn't
think you had the ability...or
you had somebody turn
around and say to you, 'You're
flat, Renay.' Well, here a lot of
us sing flat. We (the Gospel
Choir) came together out of a
desire to do something to
gether, came together looking
for something that had been in
our pasts."
In trying to coordinate the
choir last fall, the biggest prob
lem was in finding an accom
panist and a director. "There
were people who had
background in Bach, Schubert
and Brahms, but not in gos
pel," Miller said.
Then Saunders heard of a
freshman named Janice O'Neil
who could play piano. The
daughter of a Methodist minis
ter, O'Neil grew up in the tradi
tion of gospel music. She
won a $1000 cash prize, which
was shared with her sister and
two friends when their group,

The Revelations, entered the
California State Fair Black Ta
lent Contest. She has played
the keyboards since child
hood.
Before the Gospel Choir,
O'Neil said, "I didn't have an
opportunity to express myself
through gospel music as I'd
been used to doing every Sun
day morning."
Singing the gospel is very
important to Bussey. "The best
way I communicate to people
is through singing. I love the
harmony. It's uplifting to hear
all the voices blend together.
Sometimes I feel better just by
having been there."
Spending her childhood in
the "Bible Belt" in Texas,
where going to church every
Sunday was a must, Miller said
she often got her "message"
through the gospel music in
stead of the pastor's sermon.
Finding that she missed
church and gospel music when
her family moved to California,
Miller said she looked for a way
to fill the void. "Being at Stan
ford is not real. The gospel as

something from our past is a
step toward making it real.
Singing together is true fellow
ship."
"The choir is mostly black
folks," Bussey said, "but origi
nally white students were in it,
too. And there were Baptists
and Catholics — anybody who
could relate to the music."
"The most basic characteris
tic of gospel music is that there
are no restrictions. One can
add a touch of jazz here, a bit of
blues here, and a bit of ragtime
there, all in one gospel selec
tion," O'Neil said.
Saunders said she liked the
traveling. "It keeps me in
touch with what's going on
with black people. Older
people give you advice and in
vite you over to dinner. It's like
a big embrace. Vou get beyond
all that intellectualism on cam
pus. It's a feeling of love. That's
what makes it real."
There are 25-40 students in
the choir, "but it varies on
when the performance comes
in relation to midterms," Miller
said. "That's reality, also."

The Stanford Gospel Choir performed last night in the Donner dining room in Stern Hall. According to
choir member Renay Miller, the choir "came together out of a desire to do something together." The
group has made numerous appearances since its creation last year.
Sitting by her desk, Easter
Renay Miller, was
thump...thump...thumping
with her foot, while that alto
moan deep in her throat came
forth making itself known.
"Making it real," Miller
said...
Carol Bussey spoke softly,
but sang out to be heard. An
enthusiastic alto, she sat for
ward in the easy chair in Mil
ler's room, losing her place in
the book on her lap, the pencil
in her hand hanging loose.
"God has...smiled on me."
"Making it real," Miller
said...
