## Editorial No action appropriate 
### 
It is likely that tonight the ASSU Senate
will again address the question of whether
to participate in a nation-wide boycott
against the Adolph Coors Company pro
testing the company's alleged unfair labor
practices. In the senate's last meeting two
weeks ago, a proposal submitted by ASSU
Co-President Andrew Goldenkrantz to
place a moratorium on ASSU dealings with
Coors was defeated by a substantial mar
gin.
Any such step by the senate would have
an immediate and serious impact on the
ASSU. The Recycling Center is heavily de
pendent on dealings with Coors. Special
Events, the Course Guide and the Publica
tions Board are either contemplating re
ceiving or have already received substantial
revenues from the company. Both the Es
condido Village Fair and the Viennese Ball
have received free Coors beer and promo
tional products.
A senate resolution to support the
boycott might be justifiable, whatever such
action entailed, if the facts of the case were
clear. But the allegations, charges and
counter-charges that have been made in
the two years since the strike began in April
1977 have provided no clear-cut answers.
For example, Coors is charged with inva
sion of privacy because it requires lie
detector tests of all prospective employees
which include questions about "com
munistic activities." Coors does not deny
that it requires the tests, but retorts that the
constitution of the AFL-CIO, of which the
striking Coors Local 366 is a member, speci

fically bars communists from holding
executive offices in the organization.
Another charge frequently made against
Coors is that it discriminates against gays
and minorities. Coors responds it has been
certified by the federal government as an
equal opportunity employer since 1972.
Even the support of the members of Local
366 for the strike has been called into ques
tion. Coors claims that two weeks after the
first walk-out, 53 percent of the 1472 work
ers who walked out had returned to their
jobs, and that in a recent election the work
ers voted out the union. Boycott suppor
ters reply that Coors is one of few employ
ment opportunities in an area of high un
employment and that the majority of work
ers who voted were strikebreakers
threatened with the loss of their jobs if they
supported the union.
The senate has already been criticized by
some, including President Richard Lyman,
for acting on problems of equal complexity
— as when it voted last month to condemn
the practice of "double-billing" by the
Medical Center — without a full under
standing of the issues involved.
Tonight, because of the lack of conclu
sive evidence and the potential impact on
the ASSU, it is imperative that the senate
deliberate coolly and be sure of the facts
before they vote on any motion either to
support or abstain from the Coors boycott.
Indeed, in light of the issue's complexity
and the lack of conclusive evidence, we
believe the appropriate ASSU action is no
action.
