## Draft proposal unsound 
### 
I think it is high time the
youth of America stand up and
inform all the Pentagon moguls
that one of their basic premises
is wrong.
Those men in Washington,
D.C. apparently believe that, at
their command, hundreds of
thousands of young men and
women across the nation will
willingly throw themselves at
their feet and plead to be
committed to "a sudden,
bloody war in Europe."
I think we ought to let the
generals know exactly where
they can go. But before we do,
let's tell them why.
The recent initiatives to rein
stitute the draft are based on
the unsound premise that a
person's birth within certain
territorial limits entitles the
government of that territory
control over that person's
body.
While I question my ability to
effect constant and repetitive
mayhem against other men,
under certain circumstances I
could see myself willingly join
ing an effort to defend our
country against armed attack.
But my decision to do so
predicates my free choice in
deciding. I refuse to acknow
ledge the authority of govern
ment to force me against my
will to throw myself against a
Soviet tank.
First, of what use would it
be? Many analysts have pre
dicted the Soviet Union's
capability of driving straight
through to the Atlantic and

Mediterranean before the Un
ited States could mobilize,
much less train and equip, a
single division. Even if we
could mobilize and succeeded
in halting a Soviet offensive,
any conventional war would
doubtlessly escalate and void
the efforts and the sacrifices of
the average G.I.
Second, the likelihood of the
Soviets undertaking such an
offensive is minimal. It would
be suicidal; such action could
result in nothing but a net loss.
At the first sign of disaster,
NATO forces would not hesi
tate to step up the war first with
tactical then strategic nuclear
weapons.
Third, the draft is, in effect,
involuntary servitude and
therefore a violation of the
founding document of our
legal system, the Constitution.
While I would pledge to up
hold the Constitution and ev
erything it implies, I would
only do so freely, not under the
threat of a jail term for non
compliance with an uncon
stitutional directive from
Washington.
Finally, armed force is a
worst case, last resort instru
ment of foreign policy. There
are much more effective and
much "cleaner" instruments
with which to affect the actions
of other world actors. If we are
committed to avoiding war, we
should do all possible to
strengthen the non-military in
struments of foreign policy at
our disposal and use them
wisely and effectively to ensure

world peace.
Perhaps we could learn
something from Soviet foreign
policy makers and start acting
with a bit more determination
and coordination. Congress
and its pseudo-moralistic stand
on corporate payoffs and Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's human
rights policy have antagonized
unnecessarily both allies and
"enemies" alike, weakening
the economic and political in
struments of control and influ
ence the United States can use
in keeping the peace.
In the past, our use of such
instruments as the CIA has
been questionable. However,
this does not detract from their
effectiveness and utility in
foreign policy when judici
ously applied. But our most ef
fective instruments lie in the
economic and political realms,
in the forms of extensive
economic investments over
seas, political ties through aid
in development and judicious
applications of these.
So what is the solution? How
can we work toward avoiding
turning to that worst case,
military action? Begin by
strengthening our non-military
instruments of foreign policy;
a good injection of "real
politik" into our foreign
policy-making system should
help. Even Gen. Bismarck con
sidered war a bloody mess; he
was much more effective in at
taining his objectives through
non-military means.
Strengthening our political
and economic influence with
the objective of creating suffi
cient incentives to avoid milit
ary aggression anywhere in the
world would minimize the
need to reinstitute the draft
and thereby avoid the neces
sity of antagonizing Carter's
young voters and possibly set
ting off a constitutional crisis.
The Selective Service is now
only a skeleton. Let us hope
that its bones will turn to ashes
and blow away.
