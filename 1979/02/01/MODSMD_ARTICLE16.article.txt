Lights out tonight
trouble in the heartland . . .
I don't give a damn for the same old played
out scenes
I don't give a damn for just the in
betweens
I want the heart, I want the soul I want
control right now . . .
-Bruce Springsteen
Do you feel it too? My whole life feels
constrained, almost distant. As if a sheet of
pexiglass stands between me and what is
real — oppressive, like dark clouds that
won't bring rain.
The horrors of the fall — Jonestown, the
shootings and the rest — haven't faded so
much as they've blended into our lives.
Convulsions wrack the world. There is war
in Southeast Asia, revolution in Iran and
here, at the center of our lives, the system
sounds its hollow notes.
Our toothsome president plays politics
with human rights and natters useless
platitudes against inflation. His real
enough fear is that it may cost him four
more years of power. The fabric of the
whole American system is lies. Lies about
anything and everything — the CIA, the
safety of nuclear power, the nature of the
Cambodian government, the fighting in
East Timor, the causes of inflation, the
Korea bribes, Firestone tires and Pinto
cars.
And Stanford itself staggers on, preach
ing the quest for knowledge and selling
itself to the highest bidder, praising teach
ing yet giving tenure to those who bring in
lucrative research, culling itself a commun
ity but it is acting actually as a corporation
to its core.
Maybe you don't agree. Your privilege.
But for me it seems more than obvious.
Things are falling apart. Many, many

people feel it, but most just blame them
selves. A shot of Synanon or EST or a
swing with the Moonies might do the trick
they think. But of course, all this is looking
less attractive since the Peoples Temple
incident. Maybe one should settle for the
disco beat and a shot at law school.
In my opinion, the whole cult trip repre
sents an extreme example of a fundamen
tal problem of our age: the abrogation of
individual responsibility. People blame
themselves for unsatisfactory lives but ask
the "master" to make it stop hurting. It
won't do.
People are going to have to start taking
personal responsibility for finding out the
truth and acting on it, or we shall end up a
cheap mixture of 1984, the second coming
and the "Towering Inferno."
I heard Noam Chomsky speak a number
of times during his two weeks here. If you
didn't hear him, suffice it to say that he
spoke at great length about lies: official,
übiquitous lies.
Chomsky is a leftist of course — an
anarchist, actually, as am I. So some
people reject his sources as "biased." But
Chomsky doesn't apply an ideological test
to facts; it's simpler than that. Can it be
proved? Does it tollow logically?
And then conclusions are drawn and lo
and behold, you stand outside the official
reality (the one with the popular shah, the
honest president, the enlightened corpo
rations seeking a better world), and find a
world of exploitation, death, suffering and
great profits. And lies. Lies in the New York
Times and in the glossy ads of the
magazines. Enough lies to choke a world
on — which is what is happening.
Some of you will say "well, yes, there are
problems but it isn't so simple. It is all so
complicated blah, blah, blah." Not to me.
It is simple. Will we have a society based

on human values or on corporate profits?
Are women objects or as real as any man?
Will we have democracy in our lives or the
cheap imitation we have now, with "Big
Government," "Big Business" and little
enough for us?
Get hold of some "alternative" data and
use it to challenge every assumption
they've been cramming into your head
from kindergarten to your third Ph.D. And
then act. Act on your own or with others.
Look around you, there are plenty of
others who've made their choice.
Here at Stanford you can work with
anarchists, feminists, democratic
socialists, Iranians, ecologists or all at
once. Your apathy is no excuse and, unfor
tunately, it is its own reward as well.
To many readers of this it may seem
slightly hysterical. What is he running on
about? The question to ask is what are you
running on for? Where are you going with
your life? •
For me, life is the struggle for freedom.
Freedom from an oppressive system and
its ideology that we have internalized,
turning us into oppressors as well as op
pressed. To act toward liberation is the
only way to get through the thick glass of
the bell jar that pins us in specimen status.
It is the only way to get through to the
bright colors and emotions and truths on
the other side.
For the ones who had a notion
a notion deep inside
that it ain't no sin to he glad you're alive.
I wanna find one fact that ain't looking
through me
I wanna find one place, I wanna spit in the
face of these badlands.

much as they've blended into our lives.
Convulsions wrack the world. There is war
in Southeast Asia, revolution in Iran and
here, at the center of our lives, the system
sounds its hollow notes.
Our toothsome president plays politics
with human rights and natters useless
platitudes against inflation. His real
enough fear is that it may cost him four
more years of power. The fabric of the
whole American system is lies. Lies about
anything and everything — the CIA, the
safety of nuclear power, the nature of the
Cambodian government, the fighting in
East Timor, the causes of inflation, the
Korea bribes, Firestone tires and Pinto
cars.
And Stanford itself staggers on, preach
ing the quest for knowledge and selling
itself to the highest bidder, praising teach
ing yet giving tenure to those who bring in
lucrative research, culling itself a commun
ity but it is acting actually as a corporation
to its core.
Maybe you don't agree. Your privilege.
But for me it seems more than obvious.
Things are falling apart. Many, many

people feel it, but most just blame them
selves. A shot of Synanon or EST or a
swing with the Moonies might do the trick
they think. But of course, all this is looking
less attractive since the Peoples Temple
incident. Maybe one should settle for the
disco beat and a shot at law school.
In my opinion, the whole cult trip repre
sents an extreme example of a fundamen
tal problem of our age: the abrogation of
individual responsibility. People blame
themselves for unsatisfactory lives but ask
the "master" to make it stop hurting. It
won't do.
People are going to have to start taking
personal responsibility for finding out the
truth and acting on it, or we shall end up a
cheap mixture of 1984, the second coming
and the "Towering Inferno."
I heard Noam Chomsky speak a number
of times during his two weeks here. If you
didn't hear him, suffice it to say that he
spoke at great length about lies: official,
übiquitous lies.
Chomsky is a leftist of course — an
anarchist, actually, as am I. So some
people reject his sources as "biased." But
Chomsky doesn't apply an ideological test
to facts; it's simpler than that. Can it be
proved? Does it tollow logically?
And then conclusions are drawn and lo
and behold, you stand outside the official
reality (the one with the popular shah, the
honest president, the enlightened corpo
rations seeking a better world), and find a
world of exploitation, death, suffering and
great profits. And lies. Lies in the New York
Times and in the glossy ads of the
magazines. Enough lies to choke a world
on — which is what is happening.
Some of you will say "well, yes, there are
problems but it isn't so simple. It is all so
complicated blah, blah, blah." Not to me.
It is simple. Will we have a society based

on human values or on corporate profits?
Are women objects or as real as any man?
Will we have democracy in our lives or the
cheap imitation we have now, with "Big
Government," "Big Business" and little
enough for us?
Get hold of some "alternative" data and
use it to challenge every assumption
they've been cramming into your head
from kindergarten to your third Ph.D. And
then act. Act on your own or with others.
Look around you, there are plenty of
others who've made their choice.
Here at Stanford you can work with
anarchists, feminists, democratic
socialists, Iranians, ecologists or all at
once. Your apathy is no excuse and, unfor
tunately, it is its own reward as well.
To many readers of this it may seem
slightly hysterical. What is he running on
about? The question to ask is what are you
running on for? Where are you going with
your life? •
For me, life is the struggle for freedom.
Freedom from an oppressive system and
its ideology that we have internalized,
turning us into oppressors as well as op
pressed. To act toward liberation is the
only way to get through the thick glass of
the bell jar that pins us in specimen status.
It is the only way to get through to the
bright colors and emotions and truths on
the other side.
For the ones who had a notion
a notion deep inside
that it ain't no sin to he glad you're alive.
I wanna find one fact that ain't looking
through me
I wanna find one place, I wanna spit in the
face of these badlands.

Alto. His column appears biweekly.)
Lights out tonight
trouble in the heartland . . .
I don't give a damn for the same old played
out scenes
I don't give a damn for just the in
betweens
I want the heart, I want the soul I want
control right now . . .
-Bruce Springsteen
Do you feel it too? My whole life feels
constrained, almost distant. As if a sheet of
pexiglass stands between me and what is
real — oppressive, like dark clouds that
won't bring rain.
