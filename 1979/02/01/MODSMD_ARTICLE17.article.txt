## Law School discrimination charged 
### 
Recently, the officers of the
Black and La Raza Student As
sociations here met with Prof.
William Cohen, chairman of
the Law School Admissions
Committee, to discuss the
state of minority admissions at
the Law School.
Also present at the meeting
was Asst. Dean Ladoris Cor
ded. What the group disco
vered after talking with Cohen
was the not-too-surprising fact
that admissions at the Law
School is a numbers game.
Not once were the personal
statements which law school
applicants carefully work and
rework or the recommenda
tions which they diligently
pester personal friends and fa
culty members to write men
tioned as factors which play a

role in the admissions process.
The Law School admissions
process is governed by a rather
complex formula which has as
its inputs an applicant's LSAT
score, his or her grade point
average (CPA), and a proxy for
the quality of his or her under
graduate institution.
When all is said and done,
however, the formula proves
simple enough. In 1978, it pro
duced a pool of minority ad
mittees with a median GPA of
3.56 and a median LSAT score
of 660. As for quality of under
graduate school, note that of
the 16 black students at the Law
School here, there are three
from Harvard and one each
from Princeton, Yale, Williams
College, Northwestern, Stan
ford and Notre Dame. All these
institutions are private, all are

old, all traditional and sup
posedly rigorous, and all are
overwhelmingly white.
The most disconcerting
thing to come out of the meet
ing with Cohen, however, was
finding out that the Law
School's 16 black students —
with LSAT's averaging near 660,
GPA's of approximately 3.56,
and Ivy League or comparable
alma maters — are the product
of an Affirmative Action Prog
ram.
The Law School's idea of af
firmative action is admitting
black students who probably
could have gotten into all but
four or five schools in the
countryif they had beenwhite!
This "Affirmative Action" Prog
ram has resulted in a law
school which has 16 black stu

dents out of a total enrollment
of approximately 525 students,
or about 3 percent.
At the meeting, Cohen re
peatedly stressed that he is
seeking to have an "integ
rated" law school here. He de
fines "integrated" as a law
school in which minority stu
dents are not bunched in the
lowest 20 percent of their class
when it comes to grades, but
are spread along the grade
spectrum. Cohen feels that
currently, Stanford is an "in
tegrated" law school. Three
percent black — integrated.
One of the pet arguments of
those who might be consi
dered numerologists in admis
sions is that if they let in minor
ity students with significantly
lower numbers (LSAT scores,
GPA's), those students might
be stigmatized and feel they
are inferior to the general stu
dent population.
The wise men who run the
Law School here need not
worry about that occurring
here. Given the LSAT score of
black students at the Law
School (despite the fact that
the LSAT is almost certainly
biased against black people
and the bias is probably worth
a substantial number of points)
and given their CPA's, in spite
of coming from predominantly
white schools and, therefore,
receiving grades from at least a
few racist professors (most had
areas of concentration which
were very subjective), we are
probably the most select group
at the Law School.
In the new lingo of the late
70s this might be called "affir
mative action" or even "integ
ration." It sounds to me, how
ever, like plain old racial dis
crimination. It's about time we
called the phenomenon what it
is and it's about time we did
something about it.

those who might be consi
dered numerologists in admis
sions is that if they let in minor
ity students with significantly
lower numbers (LSAT scores,
GPA's), those students might
be stigmatized and feel they
are inferior to the general stu
dent population.
The wise men who run the
Law School here need not
worry about that occurring
here. Given the LSAT score of
black students at the Law
School (despite the fact that
the LSAT is almost certainly
biased against black people
and the bias is probably worth
a substantial number of points)
and given their CPA's, in spite
of coming from predominantly
white schools and, therefore,
receiving grades from at least a
few racist professors (most had
areas of concentration which
were very subjective), we are
probably the most select group
at the Law School.
In the new lingo of the late
70s this might be called "affir
mative action" or even "integ
ration." It sounds to me, how
ever, like plain old racial dis
crimination. It's about time we
called the phenomenon what it
is and it's about time we did
something about it.

Recently, the officers of the
Black and La Raza Student As
sociations here met with Prof.
William Cohen, chairman of
the Law School Admissions
Committee, to discuss the
state of minority admissions at
the Law School.
Also present at the meeting
was Asst. Dean Ladoris Cor
ded. What the group disco
vered after talking with Cohen
was the not-too-surprising fact
that admissions at the Law
School is a numbers game.
Not once were the personal
statements which law school
applicants carefully work and
rework or the recommenda
tions which they diligently
pester personal friends and fa
culty members to write men
tioned as factors which play a

role in the admissions process.
The Law School admissions
process is governed by a rather
complex formula which has as
its inputs an applicant's LSAT
score, his or her grade point
average (CPA), and a proxy for
the quality of his or her under
graduate institution.
When all is said and done,
however, the formula proves
simple enough. In 1978, it pro
duced a pool of minority ad
mittees with a median GPA of
3.56 and a median LSAT score
of 660. As for quality of under
graduate school, note that of
the 16 black students at the Law
School here, there are three
from Harvard and one each
from Princeton, Yale, Williams
College, Northwestern, Stan
ford and Notre Dame. All these
institutions are private, all are

old, all traditional and sup
posedly rigorous, and all are
overwhelmingly white.
The most disconcerting
thing to come out of the meet
ing with Cohen, however, was
finding out that the Law
School's 16 black students —
with LSAT's averaging near 660,
GPA's of approximately 3.56,
and Ivy League or comparable
alma maters — are the product
of an Affirmative Action Prog
ram.
The Law School's idea of af
firmative action is admitting
black students who probably
could have gotten into all but
four or five schools in the
countryif they had beenwhite!
This "Affirmative Action" Prog
ram has resulted in a law
school which has 16 black stu

dents out of a total enrollment
of approximately 525 students,
or about 3 percent.
At the meeting, Cohen re
peatedly stressed that he is
seeking to have an "integ
rated" law school here. He de
fines "integrated" as a law
school in which minority stu
dents are not bunched in the
lowest 20 percent of their class
when it comes to grades, but
are spread along the grade
spectrum. Cohen feels that
currently, Stanford is an "in
tegrated" law school. Three
percent black — integrated.
One of the pet arguments of
those who might be consi
dered numerologists in admis
sions is that if they let in minor
ity students with significantly
lower numbers (LSAT scores,
GPA's), those students might
be stigmatized and feel they
are inferior to the general stu
dent population.
The wise men who run the
Law School here need not
worry about that occurring
here. Given the LSAT score of
black students at the Law
School (despite the fact that
the LSAT is almost certainly

and the bias is probably worth
