Blame the bullet
Recently in a parking lot I en
countered the bumper sticker,
"Guns don't kill people,
people kill people." It is cer
tainly a catchy phrase.
Groups like the National
Rifle Association (NRA) com
pose blinding social commen
tary superbly. Blame not the
bullet, but the man who pulls
the trigger; a gun is only a tool
for which any other weapon
could be substituted.
Of course "people kill
people." No one would argue
the tact that a gun cannot fire
itself. But to suggest, as the
NRA does, that the same crimes
might be committed by other
means is to ignore both the
power of firearms and the na
ture of men.
Guns are designed to kill.
Regardless of any justification
for protection, security or
sport, one cannot deny that
this is their purpose. A gun is
not, like a knife or chain, a tool
used as a weapon; rather, it is a
weapon used as a criminal tool,

a source of power and
psychological advantage.
Armed with a baseball bat,
one might hesitate to rob a
bank, but a gun inspires cour
age and confidence. It is in fact
a formidable ally.
Lee Harvey Oswald changed
the course of history with a
6.5-millimeter rifle; he could
not have achieved his purpose
by throwing stones, any more
than Dan White would have
walked into George Moscone's
office carrying a tire iron. No
other weapon is as effective or
as threatening as a pistol.
Another catchy phrase is "if
guns are outlawed, only out
laws will have guns." Non
sense. The suggestion that we
balance the forces of good and
evil by distributing arms
equally among civilians and
criminals — indeed, that we
fight crime with guns — is man
ifestly absurd.
Arming the citizenry leads
not to security but to anarchy,
to an increase rather than a re
duction in crime. In the hand
of the average grocery clerk,

truck driver or student, a gun is
a greater danger to innocent
people than is the crime he
might prevent.
By disarming citizens one
also can disarm criminals. The
professional, knowing the
risks as he does, prefers to act
unarmed; it is the amateur
criminal, the disgruntled hus
band who shoots his wife, or
the addict who holds up a
liquor store, that the gun aids.
The argument that another
weapon could replace the gun
used in murder, suicide, rob
bery or other crimes of passion
is ludicrous at this jincture.
Guns are effective and availa
ble. As long as they remain so,
they will continue to kill.
To render guns less effective
is hardly a logical alternative,
but to make them less available
might very well be. Federal
legislation designed to register
ownership and to restrict the
sale of firearms is no longer
just feasible — it is vital.
