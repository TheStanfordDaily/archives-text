## movies/jim mattson Great movie... ...but is it sexist? 
### 
Cet Out Your Handker
chiefs isn't exactly the kind
of French comedy American
audiences have grown ac
customed to. Director Ber
trand Blier's new film has as
little to do with Cousin
Cousine or Pardon Mon Af
faire, both big hits for the
cause of the French movie
in the U.S., as it has to do
with such American produc
tions as Crease or Sargeant
Pepper. This is not to denig
rate the American
moviegoer, however; I have
a feeling that French audi
ences were equally sur
prised by Blier's joyously
malicious sense of humor.
Blier wrote and directed
this deliberately outrageous
story about Solange, a
woman who is unhappy be
cause, her husband Raoul
thinks, she cannot have
children. To restore his
wife's good humor, Raoul
approaches a total stranger,
Stephane, in a restaurant.
Raoul's offer is simple: he
will make a gift of his wife if
Stephane can make her
laugh. When Stephane has
as little success as Raoul, the
two men become bosom
companions in their at
tempt to pry under Sol
ange's stony facade. To the
consternation of both men,
Solange isn't happy until
she meets a 13-year-old
genius who satisfies first her
wish to have a child to care
for and, finally, her need to
be loved.
With a plot as bizarre as
this, Blier would have found
himself up the proverbial

creek had his performers
been less than excellent. As
his two male characters,
therefore, the director cast
two actors who he describes
as being "the two best ac
tors of this generation in Fr
ance," Gerard Depardieu
and Patrick Dewaere. For
the enigmatic Solange, Blier
wisely chose the elfin
French-Canadian actress,
Carol Laure. And for Christ
ian, the child prodigy with a
self-tested IQ of 158, Blier
found a young unknown bil
led only as Riton.
The acting styles of De
pardieu and Dewaere don't
just clash; to great comic ef
fect, they annihilate each
other. The two may be the
greatest mutually destruc
tive team since Abbottand
Costello. Depardieu, who
was probably miscast as the
dedicated young socialist in
1900, is a big man who can't
helpacf/ng big— he has the
sort of open-mouthed
slowness of a man who has
never had to worry about
being intimidated.
Dewaere, conversely, is
quicker in his reactions
exactly because he is the
type of man who is always
intimidated. His character
in the film makes a hobby of
Mozart (he daydreams of
having the composer as a
pal) and, as a last-ditch ef
fort to impress women, one
suspects, he has collected
every pocket book ever
published. When, at the
end of the film, the two men
literally find themselves on
the outside of Solange's life

looking in, this is more a re
sult of them driving each
other away from their goals
instead of any conscious ac
tion on her part.
Get Out Your Handker
chiefs, beautifully photo
graphed by lean Penzer,
uses locations in France and
Belgium. Though the film is
a comedy, the mood
created by the low-key
photography and by
Georges Delerue's music is
often a dark one. Someone
once said that there's a
cloud behind every .silver
lining, and it is this twisted
maxim that one remembers
when it becomes clear that

every joke in COYH is
tinged with pain.
Is GOYH a sexist film? It
would be easy to think so.
The woman character is
used as a bartering device
by men through most of the
movie. But, by the end of
the film, it is she who has
begun to improve her situa
tion, not the men. Blier, in
Get Out Your Handker
chiefs, has made less of a
slur on women than a slur
on the feasibility of all
human relationships. The
ironicpart is thatGOVH, un
like most such sideswipes
on humanity, is ludicrously
funny.

Cet Out Your Handker
chiefs has aroused criticism
from feminists because of
the way it depicts its charac
ters from within a primarily
male viewpoint. In a )anuary
29 press conference in San
Francisco, Director Ber
trand Blier commented on
his goals in making the film.
"I do not consider Get
Out Your Handkerchiefs to
be an anti-feminist or sexist
film," Blier said through his
interprete.. "This film is a
comedy and I am laughing
at all the characters, male as
well as female.
"Of course this film is
seen through the eyes of the
two male characters. But I
think I have not been espe
cially nice with them." Even

though the story has the
point of view of a man, Blier
said, "it's essentially the
story of Solange," the film's
main female character.
When asked whether he
had other than personal
motivations to make Get
Out Your Handkerchiefs,
Blier replied, "I invented
the story; it's totally untrue.
I wrote the film to amuse
only myself; I wasn't trying
to make a political state
ment or any other
philosophy.
"I must admit that I am a
little bit surprised by the
characters I created," Blier,
who wrote the screenplay aS
well as directed it, noted. "I
have a little trouble analyz
ing it deeply. When I look at

the film now, I receive it dif
ferently each tim (
times I see it as being just a
comedv; other times, as a
tragedy."
Blier comented that while
he was satisfied with the
film's fair success in France,
he was very pleased with its
tremendously positive re
ception by the New York
press. Blier is on the West
Coast for the first time for
the film's openings in San
Francisco and Los Angeles.
Whatever the public reac
tion to his controversial sub
ject matter, Blier seems con
tented with it. When asked
whether he would change
anything in Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs. Blier shook
his head. "No," he said, "it
is finished."

Gerard Depardieu


Patrick Deware and Carol Laure in Betrand Blier's new movie, Get Out Your Handkerchiefs.
Cet Out Your Handker
chiefs isn't exactly the kind
of French comedy American
audiences have grown ac
customed to. Director Ber
trand Blier's new film has as
little to do with Cousin
Cousine or Pardon Mon Af
faire, both big hits for the
cause of the French movie
in the U.S., as it has to do
with such American produc
tions as Crease or Sargeant
Pepper. This is not to denig
rate the American
moviegoer, however; I have
a feeling that French audi
ences were equally sur
prised by Blier's joyously
malicious sense of humor.
Blier wrote and directed
this deliberately outrageous
story about Solange, a
woman who is unhappy be
cause, her husband Raoul
thinks, she cannot have
children. To restore his
wife's good humor, Raoul
approaches a total stranger,
Stephane, in a restaurant.
Raoul's offer is simple: he
will make a gift of his wife if
Stephane can make her
laugh. When Stephane has
as little success as Raoul, the
two men become bosom
companions in their at
tempt to pry under Sol
ange's stony facade. To the
consternation of both men,
Solange isn't happy until
she meets a 13-year-old
genius who satisfies first her
wish to have a child to care
for and, finally, her need to
be loved.
With a plot as bizarre as
this, Blier would have found
himself up the proverbial

creek had his performers
been less than excellent. As
his two male characters,
therefore, the director cast
two actors who he describes
as being "the two best ac
tors of this generation in Fr
ance," Gerard Depardieu
and Patrick Dewaere. For
the enigmatic Solange, Blier
wisely chose the elfin
French-Canadian actress,
Carol Laure. And for Christ
ian, the child prodigy with a
self-tested IQ of 158, Blier
found a young unknown bil
led only as Riton.
The acting styles of De
pardieu and Dewaere don't
just clash; to great comic ef
fect, they annihilate each
other. The two may be the
greatest mutually destruc
tive team since Abbottand
Costello. Depardieu, who
was probably miscast as the
dedicated young socialist in
1900, is a big man who can't
helpacf/ng big— he has the
sort of open-mouthed
slowness of a man who has
never had to worry about
being intimidated.
Dewaere, conversely, is
quicker in his reactions
exactly because he is the
type of man who is always
intimidated. His character
in the film makes a hobby of
Mozart (he daydreams of
having the composer as a
pal) and, as a last-ditch ef
fort to impress women, one
suspects, he has collected
every pocket book ever
published. When, at the
end of the film, the two men
literally find themselves on
the outside of Solange's life

looking in, this is more a re
sult of them driving each
other away from their goals
instead of any conscious ac
tion on her part.
Get Out Your Handker
chiefs, beautifully photo
graphed by lean Penzer,
uses locations in France and
Belgium. Though the film is
a comedy, the mood
created by the low-key
photography and by
Georges Delerue's music is
often a dark one. Someone
once said that there's a
cloud behind every .silver
lining, and it is this twisted
maxim that one remembers
when it becomes clear that

every joke in COYH is
tinged with pain.
Is GOYH a sexist film? It
would be easy to think so.
The woman character is
used as a bartering device
by men through most of the
movie. But, by the end of
the film, it is she who has
begun to improve her situa
tion, not the men. Blier, in
Get Out Your Handker
chiefs, has made less of a
slur on women than a slur
on the feasibility of all
human relationships. The
ironicpart is thatGOVH, un
like most such sideswipes
on humanity, is ludicrously
funny.

Cet Out Your Handker
chiefs has aroused criticism
from feminists because of
the way it depicts its charac
ters from within a primarily
male viewpoint. In a )anuary
29 press conference in San
Francisco, Director Ber
trand Blier commented on
his goals in making the film.
"I do not consider Get
Out Your Handkerchiefs to

"Of course this film is

think I have not been espe
cially nice with them." Even

point of view of a man, Blier
said, "it's essentially the

main female character.
