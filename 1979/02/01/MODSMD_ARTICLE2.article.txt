Tehran, Iran (AP) â€” Ayatullah
Ruhollah Khomeini returned home
this morning after more than 14 years
of exile to pursue his dream of re
placing Iran's 2500-year-old monar
chy with an Islamic republic.
As the chartered Air France jetliner
landed the bearded, 78-year-old re
ligious leader of the revolution
against Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, a million excited followers
lined the 11-mile route he was to take
from the airport to Tehran's largest
cemetery where he was to speak.
Six tanks guarded the entrance to
the airport, and the crowd made no
attempt to get on to the field. But the
army was keeping a low profile, leav
ing the policing of the airport to the
normal security force there, while
SO,OOO "Islamic police" designated
by the welcoming committee main
tained order along the route to the
cemetery.
Khomeini's Boeing jumbo jet
landed on schedule at 9 a.m. (9:30
p.m. PST) but 40 minutes passed be
fore the Shiite Moslem patriarch
made his appearance at the door of
the plane.
When he did, white-capped milit

ary policemen rushed forward and
shoved back photographers and a
small group of well wishers waiting at
the bottom of the steps.
The white-bearded old man de
scended the ramp slowly, assisted by
anaideandan Air France steward. He
was escorted to a waiting Mercedes
limousine which took him to the
newly refurbished terminal building
where a selected group of 1000 faith
ful followers waited.
However, in advance of Kho
meini's arrival, leaders of the armed
forces paraded tanks and troops
through Tehran yesterday to show
that the decision to allow him to re
turn did not signal surrender by the
government of Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar.
Khomeini issued a brief statement
before leaving Paris, thanking the
French government and saying, "I
leave your country to go and serve
my country."
A spokesman for Khomeini con
ceded that, after reports reached
Paris of troops taking up new posi
tions near Tehran's airport, some fol
lowers urged him to postpone his re
turn.

"But the ayatullah has made his
decision and that is it,"the spokes
man, Sadegh Ghotbzadegh, told re
porters earlier yesterday in Paris.
Before it was announced that the
ayatullah had left, Bakhtiar said Iran
was in a "very critical and dangerous
period." He told Iranians in a radio
and television broadcast that the
government would "resist chaos and
doubtful elements."
He said: "The government will not
permit the reins of the country to be
held by anyone except the central
government."
Three anti-government de
monstrators were killed yesterday,
including two shot by troops near
volatile Tehran University,
Gunfire echoed near Tehran Uni
versity and Jaleh Square. Officials at
Jorjani Hospital near |aleh Square
said one person had died of gunshot
wounds received at a demonstration.
Witnesses said they saw at least
five ambulances speed away from
the university area, and a spokesman
at Pahlavi Hospital said two other
persons were dead from rubber bul
lets fired by troops. Three more were
wounded, the sources said.

The witnesses said troops in ar
mored vehicles opened fire after
crowds near the university accused
them of supporting the shah. More
than 40 people have been killed in
the university area in the past week.
Gen. Abbas Gharabaghi, who
heads Iran's 430,000-man army, said
the military display was a routine
troop movement, but soldiers told
bystanders it was intended to im
press the populace with the army's
strength.
Bakhtiar has warned of "agents
and enemies" posing a threat to the
ayatullah's life. In his broadcast, he
said "every drop of bloodshed...will
rest on the shoulders of those who
plot and plan a confrontation bet
ween the army and the people who
are trained to misuse the peaceful
spirit of this government."
Most military leaders say they back
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who
left Iran on an indefinite "vacation"
in mid-January. He is in Morocco and
has not made his future plans
known. Protests to his Westernizing
reforms and a lack of political free
dom in Iran forced him from the
country.
