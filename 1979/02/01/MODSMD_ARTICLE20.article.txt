Mozart: Quartets Nos. 13, 19
Alban Berg Quartet
Telefunken
Vienna's Berg Quartet is only
nine years old, yet it is proba
bly the finest such group since
the Budapest. The Berg, un
usually, plays a contemporary
work in each concert, but it has
also enjoyed rare success in
something even more difficult
— Mozart.
Like the Budapest did in its
time, the Berg plays Mozart
with unusual discretion in
phrasing and choice of tempi.
The result here is the most*
emotionally-involving record
ing of these, the last two of
Mozart's "Haydn" quartets, to

have appeared in some time.
The sound of the record is
good, but a pre-recorded cas
sette was so muffled it had to
be returned.
Unforgetldbles, Vol. 2
Concordia Trio: Albert Mar
kov, vln. Albert Catell, 'cello,
Milton Kaye, pf.
Musical Heritage Society
A special type of salon music
dominated string recordings
through the 78 age: violin
miniatures, neither bastard nor
legitimate, which were all short
and made no extreme de
mands on the recording en
gineers.
Heifetz, Elman, Kreisler, and

many others recorded things
over and over again like
Rubinstein's "Melody," "Es
trellita" by Ponce, and Fibich's
"Poeme," yet who remembers
these pieces today?
Well, the Russians do, and
violinist Albert Markov, a
Tchaikovsky competition win
ner who emigrated from Mos
cow in 1975, has compiled an
album of these and other trifles
for his first western recording.
In excellent stereo, this is
one of the few modern record
ings to capture the musical
spirit of another age, (hough it
would have been even more
authentic in scratchy mono!
