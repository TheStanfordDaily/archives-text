## Blakey: extremely sensitive jazz 
### 
Art Blakey has been frequently
praised for his considerable abilities as
a drummer; yet just as remarkable has
been his success in finding and promot
ing younger musicians. Over the past
Vh decades his groups have featured
such budding luminaries as Freddie
Hubbard, Keith Jarrett, Chuck Man
gione, Wayne Shorter, Clifford Brown,
Cedar Walton and Bobby Timmons.
The latest edition of Blakey's group,
known for decades as the Jazz Messen
gers, is no exception to the rule. Once
again Blakey has gathered together
some of the most promising young
musicians in the business. This amazing
group has been featured in a recent
album on the Concord label, entitled In
the Korner.
Keystone Korner
The album was recorded last year at
the Keystone Korner, a club which has
gained the reputation of being the
finest center for jazz on the West Coast,
and possibly the best club in the nation.
The Keystone Korner has been condu

cive to fantastic live albums (Roland
Kirk's Bright Moments and McCoy
Tyner's Atlantis come immediately to
mind), and Blakey's album is no excep
tion.
Blakey's drumming is the perfect foil
for other musicians. Not only does he
propel the song but he also pushes the
soloist. Blakey is extremely sensitive to
what his musicians are playing at any
given moment, and his playing reflects
this concern. He is truly a group musi
cian.
Soloists
Blakey, however, is ably assisted in
this regard by a formidable array of sol
oists. Alto saxophonist Robert Watson
is a skilled technician who builds fas
cinating superstructures on the princi
ples set down by Charlie Parker. James
Williams is a fluent pianist who has
adopted a persuasive modal approach
to the instrument and is heavily inde
bted to McCoy Tyner. Valery
Ponomarev is a true anomaly — a Rus
sian jazz musician — and features a
warm, attractive tone in the style of Clif
ford Brown. Tenor saxophonist David
Schnitter and bassist Dennis Irwin
round out the group.
The album swings strong through
out, but particularly impressive is the
group's rendition of Jerome Kern's
"The Song is You." One can feel the
audience's excitement, and rightly so;
the audience that night had a good deal
to be excited about. A long introduc
tion leads into a solid solo statement by
pianist Williams and exceptional solos
by Watson and Ponomarev. George
Cables' composition "Dark Side, Light
Side" follows and is the perfect vehicle
for the group members, particularly

Blakey, to show off their rhythmic
finesse.
The album is a real gem. It swings
more than any album I have heard in
quite a while. It is reassuring to know
that bebop is alive and well — and still
being practiced by one of the original
masters such as Blakey — as we ap
proach the '80s.
Another album Live Messengers
documents the considerable talents of
two previous groups of "Jazz Messen
gers." This reissue from the Blue Note
label is primarily noteworthy for featur
ing a previously unknown recording of
Clifford Brown with the Jazz Messen
gers. This live performance, taped at
Birdland in 1954, features Brown at the
height of his relatively brief career. He
plays extremely well on "The Way You
Look Tonight," and on an untitled
blues which sounds to me like
"Parker's Mood."
Hubbard
The other session on the re-issue is
another live date (this time from the slid
existing New York club, The Village
Gate) and displays Blakey's group of the
early '60s. This is the famous band
which featured the front line of Wayne
Shorter, Freddie Hubbard and Curtis
Fuller. Hubbard, in particular, displays
an amazing technical prowess and the
highlight of the session is an alternate
take of Hubbard's composition "Up
Jumped Spring."
Taken together, the two Jazz Mes
senger albums showcase some of the
finer moments of Blakey's career. The
message of the Jazz Messengers has al
ways been good music and plenty of it,
and hopefully this is a message which
will never become extinct.
