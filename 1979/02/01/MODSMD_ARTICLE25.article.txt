## Cooper loses the concept 
### 
From the Inside
Alice Cooper
Warner Brothers
This album was a potential masterpiece. Alice
Cooper, formerly one of rock's premier meat
rockers, and graduate of the Frank Zappa school
of gross, paired with one of rock's better
lyricist/poets, Bernie Taupin (ex-lyricist for Elton
John). The subject was a natural: Cooper's ob
servations and experiences in the rehabilitation
ward he had attended to combat his alcoholism.
That Cooper has the musical talent to pull it off is
unquestioned. Such pseudo-classic ballads as
"Only Women Bleed" have established the
Cooper of late as a songwriter of adequate di
versity, the sentimentality of such ballads
poised rather effectively against Cooper's burn
out numbers and machismo image.
Taken individually, some of the songs live up
to their high potential, which is a pleasant sur
prise. "From the Inside" is an introspective
rocking number which leads us to believe that
Cooper's stage show of old was more than a
gimmick. When Cooper sings "where's my
makeup where's my face on the inside (of the
clinic)" we must ask ourselves whether these
shows were in actuality Cooper's way of escap
ing his own reality.
Bite
A seeming non sequitur is the album's next
song, "Wish I Were Born in Beverly Hills," a
fast-moving song featuring a catchy chorus.
With bite Cooper fires on the Beverly Hills party
life of infidelity, a life which probably exists
more in Cooper's imagination than in fact,
though it possibly finds its basis in reality in the
mixed-up world of rock musicians. It's hard to
take Cooper seriously, though, when he sings
disdainfully of the song's subject "see the teen
age mess with the burned-out Gucci heart." In
deed, a younger Cooper seemed to work at
promoting the "teenage mess" image. The only
difference, alas, was Cooper's seeming interest
in life's minor obsessions, such as Coors, rather
than the rich girl's obsession with status.
"The Quiet Room" offers one of the album's
quieter (and prettier) moments, and conveys a
much more humbled attitude than most of the
album. Cooper, in fact, sounds as if he com
posed this song while in the institute. It smacks
of realism and true emotion, and that's a rarity
on this record. This is the full realization of the
potential of the album.
Assuming
Leaving the serious outlook on rehabilitation,
Cooper offers "Nurse Rosetta," a humorous
piece of lustful commentary through the eyes of
a hospitalised man of the cloth. If we are to
assume, though, that the song has a coherent
connection to the album's theme, we must as
sume some relation between Cooper and the
"man of God."
Even the longest stretch of the imagination
cannot yield an association, based on Cooper's
past actions, except, perhaps, for the fact that
Cooper's father is a preacher in Hnoenix. This
song would be well placed on a Flo and Eddie
album; Flo and Eddie emphasize the coherence
of theme by the lack of it. But on Cooper's
album it merely comes close to being approp
riate. And that, as they say, doesn't merit a cigar.
Inspired
Nor does "Millie and Billie." The idea is in
spired: a tongue in cheek duet (Marcy Levy
complements Cooper well) about two crazy (lit
erally) lovers, who reminisce about killing Mil
lie's former husband ("all sliced up and sealed
tight in baggies"). Indeed, by itself, this song
works well, the swelling orchestral sounds and
balladic tones accompanying Cooper and Levy's

vocals, and accentuating the vocals' crazy non
balladic subject. What is wrong here is that the
vocals are a little too good. We have no trouble
believing Cooper is making a mockery of mental
illness, which is decidedly not what this album
sets out to do.
"Serious" is a hard-rocking attempt to outline
the factors which caused Cooper to attempt re
habilitation. And, while it is one of the musical
lulls on the album, it makes a good attempt at
being consistent with the album's theme, as
does "How You Gonna See Me Now," the hit
single from this album. "How You Gonna See
Me Now" is a pleasant ballad with, unfortu
nately, lyrics and delivery to match. Which is a
shame, since the subject, the strain on Cooper's
(marital?) relations after rehabilitation should
offer much room for truly empathetic appeals.
Instead, Cooper delivers it like your run of the
mill love ballad.
Not realized
The true low point of this album, though, is
not realized until "For Veronica's Sake." This is
Cooper's throwback to his earlier, pre-ballad,
droll rock days (which essentially ended with
the abysmal Muscle of Love). Of course, this era
produced a few songs with proven longevity
("School's Out," "I'm Eighteen," "Elected,"
etc.), but much more of it was trash like this. The
lyrics give some indication of the irrationality
which can accompany a stay in a "psycho ward,"
as Cooper calls it. But the irrationality is better
indicated by placing this song on the album.
Shrewdly placed after "For Veronica's Sake"
is the musically pleasant and catchy "Jacknife
Johnny." Unless Cooper was having hallucina
tions of war in the hospital, this one is not very
introspective. Which is not to say that it is not
very good lyrically, just that its complete ap
propriateness for this album is questionable.
Cooper offers a literate protest against the draft
and the ill-effects of war on participants:
From the tone deaf hearing of the draft board
game
You were washing cars down in Dallas when the
holocaust came
Dear johnny your excuse was lame
All your friends sleep in boxes while you sleep in
chains.
Later, Johnny, "shell-shocked and dazed," is
"strung out at night on morphine and meth." If
Bob Dylan sang this song you'd probably find
yourself in accordance with the point of view
and angered. In the context of this album you
find yourself unmoved and asking what the
point of the song is.
Overtly facetious
Cooper closes the album with the overtly
facetious sounding "Inmates (We're All Crazy)."
Which simply leaves us wondering whether
Cooper has taken any of this seriously, or if,
rather, it's simply a charade. In a nutshell, we
don't know what to think or what Cooper's
point of view is. The songs range from the seri
ous and introspective to the mocking (to those
which don't seem to have any connection what
soever). Which is the primary fault of the album.
Taken as a collection of songs, it's a good al
bum; most of the songs are enjoyable, some
quite catchy. But this is supposed to be a con
cept album. And an introspective concept
album such as this should make a point (other
wise, why utilize the concept). This album fails
to either stick to its concept or make a point.
Or perhaps it makes a very good point:
Cooper needs to either try harder to meet the
demands of the concepts he chooses, or else
use broad semi-concepts, such as that of Wel
come to My Nightmare, where almost any song
will fit and little point is implied. Hopefully,
Cooper's next will be a more sobering effort.

of theme by the lack of it. But on Cooper's
album it merely comes close to being approp
riate. And that, as they say, doesn't merit a cigar.
Inspired
Nor does "Millie and Billie." The idea is in
spired: a tongue in cheek duet (Marcy Levy
complements Cooper well) about two crazy (lit
erally) lovers, who reminisce about killing Mil
lie's former husband ("all sliced up and sealed
tight in baggies"). Indeed, by itself, this song
works well, the swelling orchestral sounds and
balladic tones accompanying Cooper and Levy's

vocals, and accentuating the vocals' crazy non
balladic subject. What is wrong here is that the
vocals are a little too good. We have no trouble
believing Cooper is making a mockery of mental
illness, which is decidedly not what this album
sets out to do.
"Serious" is a hard-rocking attempt to outline
the factors which caused Cooper to attempt re
habilitation. And, while it is one of the musical
lulls on the album, it makes a good attempt at
being consistent with the album's theme, as
does "How You Gonna See Me Now," the hit
single from this album. "How You Gonna See
Me Now" is a pleasant ballad with, unfortu
nately, lyrics and delivery to match. Which is a
shame, since the subject, the strain on Cooper's
(marital?) relations after rehabilitation should
offer much room for truly empathetic appeals.
Instead, Cooper delivers it like your run of the
mill love ballad.
Not realized
The true low point of this album, though, is
not realized until "For Veronica's Sake." This is
Cooper's throwback to his earlier, pre-ballad,
droll rock days (which essentially ended with
the abysmal Muscle of Love). Of course, this era
produced a few songs with proven longevity
("School's Out," "I'm Eighteen," "Elected,"
etc.), but much more of it was trash like this. The
lyrics give some indication of the irrationality
which can accompany a stay in a "psycho ward,"
as Cooper calls it. But the irrationality is better
indicated by placing this song on the album.
Shrewdly placed after "For Veronica's Sake"
is the musically pleasant and catchy "Jacknife
Johnny." Unless Cooper was having hallucina
tions of war in the hospital, this one is not very
introspective. Which is not to say that it is not
very good lyrically, just that its complete ap
propriateness for this album is questionable.
Cooper offers a literate protest against the draft
and the ill-effects of war on participants:
From the tone deaf hearing of the draft board
game
You were washing cars down in Dallas when the
holocaust came
Dear johnny your excuse was lame
All your friends sleep in boxes while you sleep in
chains.
Later, Johnny, "shell-shocked and dazed," is
"strung out at night on morphine and meth." If
Bob Dylan sang this song you'd probably find
yourself in accordance with the point of view
and angered. In the context of this album you
find yourself unmoved and asking what the
point of the song is.
Overtly facetious
Cooper closes the album with the overtly
facetious sounding "Inmates (We're All Crazy)."
Which simply leaves us wondering whether
Cooper has taken any of this seriously, or if,
rather, it's simply a charade. In a nutshell, we
don't know what to think or what Cooper's
point of view is. The songs range from the seri
ous and introspective to the mocking (to those
which don't seem to have any connection what
soever). Which is the primary fault of the album.
Taken as a collection of songs, it's a good al
bum; most of the songs are enjoyable, some
quite catchy. But this is supposed to be a con
cept album. And an introspective concept
album such as this should make a point (other
wise, why utilize the concept). This album fails
to either stick to its concept or make a point.
Or perhaps it makes a very good point:
Cooper needs to either try harder to meet the
demands of the concepts he chooses, or else
use broad semi-concepts, such as that of Wel
come to My Nightmare, where almost any song
will fit and little point is implied. Hopefully,
Cooper's next will be a more sobering effort.
From the Inside
Alice Cooper
Warner Brothers
This album was a potential masterpiece. Alice
Cooper, formerly one of rock's premier meat
rockers, and graduate of the Frank Zappa school
of gross, paired with one of rock's better
lyricist/poets, Bernie Taupin (ex-lyricist for Elton
John). The subject was a natural: Cooper's ob
servations and experiences in the rehabilitation
ward he had attended to combat his alcoholism.
That Cooper has the musical talent to pull it off is
unquestioned. Such pseudo-classic ballads as
"Only Women Bleed" have established the
Cooper of late as a songwriter of adequate di
versity, the sentimentality of such ballads
poised rather effectively against Cooper's burn
out numbers and machismo image.
Taken individually, some of the songs live up
to their high potential, which is a pleasant sur
prise. "From the Inside" is an introspective
rocking number which leads us to believe that
Cooper's stage show of old was more than a
gimmick. When Cooper sings "where's my
makeup where's my face on the inside (of the
clinic)" we must ask ourselves whether these
shows were in actuality Cooper's way of escap
ing his own reality.
Bite
A seeming non sequitur is the album's next
song, "Wish I Were Born in Beverly Hills," a
fast-moving song featuring a catchy chorus.
With bite Cooper fires on the Beverly Hills party
life of infidelity, a life which probably exists
more in Cooper's imagination than in fact,
though it possibly finds its basis in reality in the
mixed-up world of rock musicians. It's hard to
take Cooper seriously, though, when he sings
disdainfully of the song's subject "see the teen
age mess with the burned-out Gucci heart." In
deed, a younger Cooper seemed to work at
promoting the "teenage mess" image. The only
difference, alas, was Cooper's seeming interest
in life's minor obsessions, such as Coors, rather
than the rich girl's obsession with status.
"The Quiet Room" offers one of the album's
quieter (and prettier) moments, and conveys a
much more humbled attitude than most of the
album. Cooper, in fact, sounds as if he com
posed this song while in the institute. It smacks
of realism and true emotion, and that's a rarity
on this record. This is the full realization of the
potential of the album.
Assuming
Leaving the serious outlook on rehabilitation,
Cooper offers "Nurse Rosetta," a humorous
piece of lustful commentary through the eyes of
a hospitalised man of the cloth. If we are to
assume, though, that the song has a coherent
connection to the album's theme, we must as
sume some relation between Cooper and the
"man of God."
Even the longest stretch of the imagination
cannot yield an association, based on Cooper's
past actions, except, perhaps, for the fact that
Cooper's father is a preacher in Hnoenix. This
song would be well placed on a Flo and Eddie
album; Flo and Eddie emphasize the coherence
of theme by the lack of it. But on Cooper's

riate. And that, as they say, doesn't merit a cigar.

and angered. In the context of this album you
find yourself unmoved and asking what the
point of the song is.
Overtly facetious
Cooper closes the album with the overtly
facetious sounding "Inmates (We're All Crazy)."
Which simply leaves us wondering whether
Cooper has taken any of this seriously, or if,
rather, it's simply a charade. In a nutshell, we
don't know what to think or what Cooper's
point of view is. The songs range from the seri
ous and introspective to the mocking (to those
which don't seem to have any connection what
soever). Which is the primary fault of the album.
Taken as a collection of songs, it's a good al
bum; most of the songs are enjoyable, some
quite catchy. But this is supposed to be a con
cept album. And an introspective concept
album such as this should make a point (other
wise, why utilize the concept). This album fails
to either stick to its concept or make a point.
Or perhaps it makes a very good point:
Cooper needs to either try harder to meet the
demands of the concepts he chooses, or else
use broad semi-concepts, such as that of Wel
come to My Nightmare, where almost any song
will fit and little point is implied. Hopefully,
Cooper's next will be a more sobering effort.
