## Diverse and exhausting 
### 
Hidden away in Old Union's
The Nitery is a production that
should not be missed; a pro
duction that grabs you up, car
ries you at a breakneck speed,
then throws you down drained
and exhausted.
The Black Committee for the
Performing Arts is presenting
The Owl Killer this Thursday,
Friday and Saturday night at 8
p.m. The one-act play by Phillip
Hayes Dean, begins with the
angry entrance of Noah Hamil
ton, a working-class, black
man, who's decided not to go
to the plant night.
Intensity
This scene, which intro
duces his calm and intimidated
wife Emma, is so tense that one
doubts the rest of the play will
be able to match its intensity.
But as the show progresses,
the passion increases. Conver
sation reveals that an unseen
son, Lamont, is wanted for the
murder and mutilation of a
shopkeeper.
Stella Mae, thrown out of the

house when 16 and pregnant,
visits home against her father's
orders. Her presence results in
a series of cruelly honest con
fessions. Noah, Emma, and
Stella Mae voice all the bitter
ness and hatred for each other
that they've concealed through
the years.
Effective
Clarence Otis Jr., the direc
tor, sets an effective pace for
the show: the audience relaxes
one moment, only to be star
tled the next. He approaches
the play as painfully honest as
Noah's family during their con
frontations. Denni Hawkin's
costumes, common working
class attire, and Robert
Graham's simple living room
set emphasize this realism.
Anthony Haney portrays
Noah, a man who accepts
hated responsibilities while
growing more and more frus
trated and furious. Without a
doubt, his performance is one
of the most powerful and con
vincing to be found in Bay Area

theater. A strong statement,
true, but Haney's acting jus
tifies it.
Selita Mills and Cheryl Gof
frey, as Emma and Stella re
spectively, warm to their roles
and contribute to the energy of
the production.
In addition to The Owl Killer,
the Black Committee for the
Performing Arts presents
another one-act, Day of Ab
sence, by Douglas Turner
Ward. The satire illustrates the
activities of a Southern com
munity when all the town's
blacks mysteriously disappear
for one day.
Suddenly all life in the town
falls apart. Factories shut
down, babies are "forced to
endure the embraces of
strange parents," and the Na
tional Guard is called in.
Humor
Directors Carlyle Kinnison
and Gary Watson treat the
show and its topic of prejudice
with humor, not rancor. One
suspects that the actors enjoy
their mimicry of Southern
drawls as much as their
whiteface make-up.
The large cast acts lighthear
tedly and well. Notable are
Jacquilyn Boykin as the mayor,
Gregory Wright as a gangly as
sistant, and Rachelle Johnson
as the vision of white, South
ern femininity.
Comic
While Day of Absence dims
next to its potent companion,
one feels the necessity for its
comic buoyancy to balance the
productions.
While the Black Committee
for the Performing Arts could
strengthen its technical
abilities, it reveals an admira
ble range of acting and greet
ing talent. It is indeed a misfor
tune that The Owl Killer must
limit itself to a 70-person audi
ence.
