# Council of Presidents works on own projects
## 
### Rob Lempert Senior staff writer 
The Council of Presidents has few
official duties, according to the ASSU
Constitution. Much of their time is
involved with projects of their own
creation.
"We work on what's important to
us," said COP member Andrew Gol
denkranz.
This year's COP members are Gol
denkranz, Regina Petty and Mary
Morimoto, all seniors, and Fred
Estes, a graduate student in educa
tion.
Petty said that one of her projects
has been organizing and supervising
a student task force on financial aids.
She said she became involved with
the issue when a group of students
approached her about researching
the topic. She helped them form a
task force that plans to present the
University with a list of recommenda
tions and publish a guide on financial
aids procedures and policies for stu
dents.
Petty described this type of activity
as being one of the primary focuses
of the COP. The council can direct
students to the proper University

channels (administrators or commit
tees) to deal with their concerns, or
can help them organize their own
student groups to deal with their
problems.
Petty said she favors the latter
course, adding that she thinks every
facet of the University should at one
time or another be investigated by
some student group.
Goldenkranz said he is involved
with organizing Stanford's participa
tion in the Little 11 Conference, a
meeting of student delegates from 11
major universities to be held in
Philadelphia later this month.
He is also working with a Univer
sity committee on teaching to help
devise methods of sharpen ng the
teaching skills of professors.
Morimoto is involved with an
honor code committee and the Rape
Education Project. Estes is involved
with graduate student affairs.
Among the COP's official duties
are chairing the ASSU Nominations
Committee (which appoints students
to various University committees),
and serving as observers in the stu
dent senate, the Faculty Senate and
the Board of Trustees.

Working with the University has its
own peculiar problems, according to
Goldenkranz.
"By definition, a University ad
ministration is conservative. They are
always looking at things in the long
run, looking at the 20 year plan," he
said.
Commenting on the powers and
limitations of his office, Goldenkranz
said that the administration always
seems interested in preserving the
status quo and is always looking for
the least dramatic solution to a prob
lem.
"Change is a last resort for them,"
he added.
On the other hand, Goldenkranz
said that students, who are only here
fora short time, "like to try new ways
of doing things."
Goldenkranz said that sometimes
the administration exploits the short
tenure of student officials, stalling on

programs it doesn't like until those
students favoring it are no longer in
office. But by and large, Golden
kranz said, he hasn't had too much
problem dealing with the University.
Petty, speaking in the same inter
view, added that the administration
is slow in responding, but moves
more quickly when the COP makes
the effort to pressure them.
Petty said that one problem the
COP has is getting students to volun
teer their concerns and desires for
campus improvements. She said at
the beginning of their term, the COP
members spent a great deal of time
talking to RAs, trying to get invita
tions to attend sherry hours and din
ners at dorms.
The door to the COP office is often
left open so the public can "wande,
in," Petty said. She added the stu
dent who stops by usually has a
specific concern, wants to know
what can be done about it, but is
reluctant to spend any time following
through on the issue.
Goldenkranz added that the COP,
with a staff of only one person, has
difficulty keeping track of all that
happens on campus and letting the
campus keep track of what the COP
is doing. He said the COPoften finds
itself engaged in "reactionary poli
tics," responding to the decisions of
others, rather than initiating any
thing on its own.
Goldenkranz suggested the COP
needs a research-press person, to ar
range meetings in dorms and keep
the campus and COP informed of
each other's activities.

fora short time, "like to try new ways
of doing things."
Goldenkranz said that sometimes
the administration exploits the short
tenure of student officials, stalling on

programs it doesn't like until those
students favoring it are no longer in
office. But by and large, Golden
kranz said, he hasn't had too much
problem dealing with the University.
Petty, speaking in the same inter
view, added that the administration
is slow in responding, but moves
more quickly when the COP makes
the effort to pressure them.
Petty said that one problem the
COP has is getting students to volun
teer their concerns and desires for
campus improvements. She said at
the beginning of their term, the COP
members spent a great deal of time
talking to RAs, trying to get invita
tions to attend sherry hours and din
ners at dorms.
The door to the COP office is often
left open so the public can "wande,
in," Petty said. She added the stu
dent who stops by usually has a
specific concern, wants to know
what can be done about it, but is
reluctant to spend any time following
through on the issue.
Goldenkranz added that the COP,
with a staff of only one person, has
difficulty keeping track of all that
happens on campus and letting the
campus keep track of what the COP
is doing. He said the COPoften finds
itself engaged in "reactionary poli
tics," responding to the decisions of
others, rather than initiating any
thing on its own.
Goldenkranz suggested the COP
needs a research-press person, to ar
range meetings in dorms and keep
the campus and COP informed of
each other's activities.
The Council of Presidents has few
official duties, according to the ASSU
Constitution. Much of their time is
involved with projects of their own
creation.
"We work on what's important to
us," said COP member Andrew Gol
denkranz.
This year's COP members are Gol
denkranz, Regina Petty and Mary
Morimoto, all seniors, and Fred
Estes, a graduate student in educa
tion.
Petty said that one of her projects
has been organizing and supervising
a student task force on financial aids.
She said she became involved with
the issue when a group of students
approached her about researching
the topic. She helped them form a
task force that plans to present the
University with a list of recommenda
tions and publish a guide on financial
aids procedures and policies for stu
dents.
Petty described this type of activity
as being one of the primary focuses
of the COP. The council can direct
students to the proper University

channels (administrators or commit
tees) to deal with their concerns, or
can help them organize their own
student groups to deal with their
problems.
Petty said she favors the latter
course, adding that she thinks every
facet of the University should at one
time or another be investigated by
some student group.
Goldenkranz said he is involved
with organizing Stanford's participa
tion in the Little 11 Conference, a
meeting of student delegates from 11
major universities to be held in
Philadelphia later this month.
He is also working with a Univer
sity committee on teaching to help
devise methods of sharpen ng the
teaching skills of professors.
Morimoto is involved with an
honor code committee and the Rape
Education Project. Estes is involved
with graduate student affairs.
Among the COP's official duties
are chairing the ASSU Nominations
Committee (which appoints students
to various University committees),
and serving as observers in the stu
dent senate, the Faculty Senate and
the Board of Trustees.

Working with the University has its
own peculiar problems, according to
Goldenkranz.
"By definition, a University ad
ministration is conservative. They are
always looking at things in the long
run, looking at the 20 year plan," he
said.
Commenting on the powers and
limitations of his office, Goldenkranz
said that the administration always
seems interested in preserving the
status quo and is always looking for
the least dramatic solution to a prob
lem.
"Change is a last resort for them,"
he added.
On the other hand, Goldenkranz
said that students, who are only here
fora short time, "like to try new ways
of doing things."
Goldenkranz said that sometimes
the administration exploits the short
tenure of student officials, stalling on

programs it doesn't like until those
