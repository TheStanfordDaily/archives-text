### 
Carter, Teng sign agreements
Washington — President Jimmy Carter and Teng
Hsiao-ping, declaring "the honeymoon will con
tinue," signed scientific and cultural exchange ag
reements yesterday marking the state of a new era
of cooperation between the United States and
China.
Shortly before the signing ceremony in the
White House East Room, climaxing the Chinese
vice premier's three-day official visit to
Washington, Teng blasted the Soviet Union in a
nationally televised interview as "the main hotbed
of war" in the world today.
Two of the accords signed yesterday were
negotiated since Teng arrived here Sunday. One
would allow China to buy a giant atomic particle
accelerator for high-energy physics experiments,
at a cost of $100 million to $200 million. American
officials said the accelerator, to be built in Peking,
would have no direct military application.
Under the second agreement, China would
open consulates in San Francisco and Houston,
and the United States would have consulates in
Shanghai and Canton. These would be in addition
to embassies opening in Peking and Washington
about March 1.
Other agreements signed by the two leaders
called for U.S. assistance in establishing a domes
tic Chinese satellite communications system,
cooperation in agricultural and energy research,
exchanges of students and scholars, and ex
panded flow of cultural programs, the arts, publi
cations, films and other information between the
two countries.
National 'Healthcare' planned
Washington — The Carter administration's tenta
tive national health insurance plan would guaran
tee every American basic protection against ill
ness, either through a private insurance policy or a
government-run program along the lines of Medi
care.
The plan would require everyone to carry a
standard benefit package that would pay at least 75
percent of the cost of all hospital bills, physicians'
fees, prescription drugs, outpatient, laboratory
and X-ray services and treatment for alcoholics,
drug addicts and the mentally ill.

Full implementation of the plan might take years
under the proposed phase-in schedule beginning
in 1983.
Sources familiar with the plan said even after it is
fully implemented, families able to would be re
quired to pay 25 percent of all expenses up to a
limit of $1500 a year.
The poor, unemployed, uninsurable and elderly
would be guaranteed insurance through Heal
thcare, even if they couldn't afford to pay a pre
mium, and the cost of that coverage would be paid
from general tax funds.
To finance the plan, employers would pay a
minimum of 75 percent of the premium for each
employee.
Pope ends week-long pilgrimmage
Mexico City — Pope John Paul II bade an emo
tional farewell to Mexico City yesterday, the final
day of his week-long "pilgrimage of faith."
He told a gathering of students to "work for a
better future . . . for Mexico and other Latin
American countries."
The pope, sunburned after speaking for days in
the broiling sun, addressed the students shaded
by an umbrella.
The Polish-born pontiff drew long and loud
applause when he departed from his prepared text
and in almost faultless Spanish told the crowd, "I
lack the words to explain what I feel deeply in my
heart. I lack words ... I just lack words."
Police estimate the pope's appearances have
drawn nearly 20 million people during his travels
in Mexico.
The pope's remarks were interrupted time and
again with the cheer, "Viva el Papa!" and "Long
live Poland." Many in the crowd, estimated by
police at 250,000, waved white and yellow hand
kerchiefs — the Vatican colors.
More farmworkers aid strike
Imperial Valley — About 1200 farmworkers at six
Imperial Valley lettuce growers walked off their
jobs today in response to an effort by growers to
break a strike at other fields with volunteer lettuce
harvesters, a United Farm Workers Union
spokesman reported.
The six companies were not among the eight

Imperial Valley lettuce growers that were struck by
the UFW Jan. 19, said Marc Grossman, who added
that the walkout did not necessarily mean the 1200
farmworkers had joined the strike.
Earlier, a dozen buses of volunteers, mostly
women and children, showed up at one struck
lettuce grower's field, buttherewere no reports of
trouble between the strikebreakers and the pic
keters.
Teenage sniper could get life
San Diego — A petition was filed yesterday in
Juvenile Court charging a 16-year-old girl with two
counts of murder and 10 other criminal charges in
an elementary school sniper attack.
The petition filed by Deputy District Attorney
Charles Patrick also alleges "special cir
cumstances" in the case against Brenda Ann
Spencer which could bring her life in prison with
out parole if she is convicted of murder.
Burton Wragg, 53, principal of Cleveland
Elementary School, and chief custodian Michael
Suchar, 56, were killed and eight children and a
police officer were wounded.
Spencer was arrested Monday following a bVi
hour siege at her home across the street from the
school. Police say she sprayed at least 40 bullets at
Cleveland Elementary from a .22-caliber rifle she
received for Christmas.

heart. I lack words ... I just lack words."
Police estimate the pope's appearances have
drawn nearly 20 million people during his travels
in Mexico.
The pope's remarks were interrupted time and
again with the cheer, "Viva el Papa!" and "Long
live Poland." Many in the crowd, estimated by
police at 250,000, waved white and yellow hand
kerchiefs — the Vatican colors.
More farmworkers aid strike
Imperial Valley — About 1200 farmworkers at six
Imperial Valley lettuce growers walked off their
jobs today in response to an effort by growers to
break a strike at other fields with volunteer lettuce
harvesters, a United Farm Workers Union
spokesman reported.
The six companies were not among the eight

Imperial Valley lettuce growers that were struck by
the UFW Jan. 19, said Marc Grossman, who added
that the walkout did not necessarily mean the 1200
farmworkers had joined the strike.
Earlier, a dozen buses of volunteers, mostly
women and children, showed up at one struck
lettuce grower's field, buttherewere no reports of
trouble between the strikebreakers and the pic
keters.
Teenage sniper could get life
San Diego — A petition was filed yesterday in
Juvenile Court charging a 16-year-old girl with two
counts of murder and 10 other criminal charges in
an elementary school sniper attack.
The petition filed by Deputy District Attorney
Charles Patrick also alleges "special cir
cumstances" in the case against Brenda Ann
Spencer which could bring her life in prison with
out parole if she is convicted of murder.
Burton Wragg, 53, principal of Cleveland
Elementary School, and chief custodian Michael
Suchar, 56, were killed and eight children and a
police officer were wounded.
Spencer was arrested Monday following a bVi
hour siege at her home across the street from the
school. Police say she sprayed at least 40 bullets at
Cleveland Elementary from a .22-caliber rifle she
received for Christmas.

Carter, Teng sign agreements
Washington — President Jimmy Carter and Teng
Hsiao-ping, declaring "the honeymoon will con
tinue," signed scientific and cultural exchange ag
reements yesterday marking the state of a new era
of cooperation between the United States and
China.
Shortly before the signing ceremony in the
White House East Room, climaxing the Chinese
vice premier's three-day official visit to
Washington, Teng blasted the Soviet Union in a
nationally televised interview as "the main hotbed
of war" in the world today.
Two of the accords signed yesterday were
negotiated since Teng arrived here Sunday. One
would allow China to buy a giant atomic particle
accelerator for high-energy physics experiments,
at a cost of $100 million to $200 million. American
officials said the accelerator, to be built in Peking,
would have no direct military application.
Under the second agreement, China would
open consulates in San Francisco and Houston,
and the United States would have consulates in
Shanghai and Canton. These would be in addition
to embassies opening in Peking and Washington
about March 1.
Other agreements signed by the two leaders
called for U.S. assistance in establishing a domes
tic Chinese satellite communications system,
cooperation in agricultural and energy research,
exchanges of students and scholars, and ex
panded flow of cultural programs, the arts, publi
cations, films and other information between the
two countries.
National 'Healthcare' planned
Washington — The Carter administration's tenta
tive national health insurance plan would guaran
tee every American basic protection against ill
ness, either through a private insurance policy or a
government-run program along the lines of Medi
care.
The plan would require everyone to carry a
standard benefit package that would pay at least 75
percent of the cost of all hospital bills, physicians'
fees, prescription drugs, outpatient, laboratory
and X-ray services and treatment for alcoholics,
drug addicts and the mentally ill.

Full implementation of the plan might take years
under the proposed phase-in schedule beginning
in 1983.
Sources familiar with the plan said even after it is
fully implemented, families able to would be re
quired to pay 25 percent of all expenses up to a
limit of $1500 a year.
The poor, unemployed, uninsurable and elderly
would be guaranteed insurance through Heal
thcare, even if they couldn't afford to pay a pre
mium, and the cost of that coverage would be paid
from general tax funds.
To finance the plan, employers would pay a
minimum of 75 percent of the premium for each
employee.
Pope ends week-long pilgrimmage
Mexico City — Pope John Paul II bade an emo
tional farewell to Mexico City yesterday, the final
day of his week-long "pilgrimage of faith."
He told a gathering of students to "work for a
better future . . . for Mexico and other Latin
American countries."
The pope, sunburned after speaking for days in
the broiling sun, addressed the students shaded
by an umbrella.
The Polish-born pontiff drew long and loud
applause when he departed from his prepared text
and in almost faultless Spanish told the crowd, "I
lack the words to explain what I feel deeply in my
heart. I lack words ... I just lack words."
Police estimate the pope's appearances have
drawn nearly 20 million people during his travels
in Mexico.
