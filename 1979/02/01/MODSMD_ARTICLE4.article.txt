## 
### Seth Zuckerman 
A survey of 114 medical schools ac
ross the nation shows that the Medi
cal School here ranks seventh in the
percentage of minority students en
rolled. According to the study, cited
by Acting Dean Lawrence Crowley at
a recent faculty senate meeting, 26
percent of Stanford medical students
are non-Caucasian.
Assistant Dean for Administration
David Hopkins said the study, spon
sored by the Association of American
Medical Colleges, was conducted in
1976-77. The figures were only re
leased last October because of the
time it takes a nationwide organiza
tion to process the large amount of
data it gathered, Hopkins said.
The survey is prepared annually
and is circulated to the deans of the
participating medical schools, he
said. Hopkins would not release a
full copy of the report because it is
"not a public report" but rather an
"internal document." The study in
cludes most if not all of the accre
dited medical schools in America, he
said.

The study also showed that Stan
ford medical students have an aver
age MCAT (Medical College Aptitude
Test)' score of 662. This average is the
sixth highest in America, Hopkins
said. The survey does not list the
rankings other medical schools
achieved, however.
According to the report, all Stan
ford medical students who need fi
nancial aid do, in fact, receive it.
Hopkins said there were no sig
nificant differences between this
year's study and the last one. No
changes in medical school policy are
planned as a result of the survey, he
said. »
Commenting on the survey, Eric
Hutchinson, academic secretary of
the Faculty Senate, said it was the
kind of report that said Stanford
ranked "umpty-umpth in this, fifth in
that, and first in overhead."
Out of the 114 schools participat
ing in the survey, Stanford ranked
79th in the total number of medical
students and 36th in the number of
full-time faculty.
