# SLAC selected for research on Chinese proton synchotron

### Lee Tien 
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) has been selected as one of
five research facilities in the United
States to help the People's Republic
of China design and>construct a pro
ton synchotron, a type of elementary
particle accelerator, a spokesman for
SLAC said yesterday.
The scientific and cultural ex
change agreements signed in
Washington yesterday by President
Jimmy Carter and Chinese Vice Pre
mier Teng Hsiao-ping provided for a
set of accords or "sub-agreements"
between the two nations.
The first of these accords, signed
by Energy Secretary lames'*
Schlesinger, allows China to build
the synchotron with American scien
tific advice, according to SLAC Per
sonnel Director Douglas Dupen.
Besides SLAC, the other American
scientific facilities named in the ag
reement are Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory, Fermi National Laborat
ory in Batavia, 111., Argonne National
Laboratory in Argonne, 111. and

Brookhaven National Laboratory in
Long Island, New York.
Dupen said that a delegation of
eight Chinese scientists and en
gineers met here from jan. 15 to Jan.
22 before moving on to the other
four laboratories.
Planning for the agreement "be
gan very shortly" after diplomatic re
lations between China and the Un
ited States were established, Dupen
said.
Under the terms of the agreement,
each of the five American facilities
will work on a separate part of the
accelerator system. SLAC will be
primarily concerned with focusing
magnets and other magnetic de
vices, while Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory will work on the synchot
ron's control system.
The accelerator which the Chinese
plan on building is scheduled to be
completed in 1982, which Dupen
termed an "ambitious" timetable.

Dupen said the proton synchotron
they are planning accelerates pro
tons in a circle as do the accelerators
at Fermi, Argonne and Brookhaven
labs. The original SLAC accelerator
accelerates electrons in a straight
line.
According to Dupen, the Chinese
synchotron will be a mid-size ac
celerator, with an energy of up to 50
billion electron volts. The Fermi ac
celerator has an energy of 500 billion
electron volts, while the Brookhaven
device reaches only 30 billion elec
tron volts.
Dupen said the purpose of the ac
celerator program is "basic research,
not applied" research. He added that
the research the Chinese plan is simi
lar to the research done at SLAC.
The cost of the project is estimated
at somewhere between $100 million
and $200 million, according to the
Associated Press.
