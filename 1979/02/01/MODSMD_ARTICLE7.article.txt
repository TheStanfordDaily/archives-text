# Early-bird Coladarci stepping down in '79
## 
### Jonathan Slater 
At four in the morning, hours
before the sun has risen, while
most of the world is in a deep
slumber, School of Education
Dean Arthur Coladarci arrives at
his office in the Cubberley build
ing.
It is not until 12 or 15 hours later
— when the sun is setting — that
he is ready to go home.
"Strangely enough the hours
are not tiring — it's exhilarating. I
work with interesting people, in
teresting people are exhilarating.
If it were dull, I would quit," Col
adarci said.
Strangely enough that is just
what he is about to do — quit.
Coladarci has announced that he
will retire from his position as
dean, effective Sept. 1, 1979. But
his resignation has nothing to do
with his long hours, he says.
"An institution is helped by a
periodic change of adminis
trators, they should turn over
once in a while," he said. "I havea
suspicion that an administrator at
one point stops listening to new
views, becomes comfortable in
authority, and the problem is that
the administrator does not know
when that's happening."
Coladarci has headed the
number one ranked School of
Education for nine years. He plans
to return to teaching at the school
following his resignation.
During his tenure as dean, Col
adarci said, he has missed the op
portunity to teach. It is clear that
teaching is one of his primary
loves.
"I like teaching and I like ad
ministrating," he said. "But while
I was dean, I just couldn't honor
the commitment to be in class."
Part of his inability to honor that
commitment stems from time
consuming budgetary problems
which plagued the entire Univer
sity over the last 10 years, prob
lems to which Coladarci said he
has had to devote much energy.
"It has been a period with a
great deal of problems in society
and the University. A less frantic
time in the University, probably
would have allowed more time to
do things like think and teach," he
said.

Both Associate Dean Richard
Still and Acting Provost Gerald
Leiberman pointed to Coladarci's
ability to handle these financial
problems.
"In a very difficult time, with
various budget cutting programs,
he managed very well and in
volved the faculty in the hard de
cisions that have been required,"
said Still.
"He has been an excellent dean
at a time when the University was
in a very tight budgetary situation.
I think that his leadership and di
rection of the school was first
class," added Leiberman.
Since the first national surveys
of education schools in the early
19705, the School of Education
here has always come out number
one.
Coladarci did say the school
was probably the best of its kind in
the nation under his predecessor
H. Thomas James, and his job has
been to maintain its top posiion.
And that he has done. In the
latest survey of morp than 4000
university faculty members
throughout the C( "ntrv con
ducted by Everett L tdd |rand
Seymour Lipset, th< x.nool of
Education received top honors.
Coladarci said he is rather skep
tical of the reliability of these
polls, but added, "If you have to
have them, it's a good idea to be
on top."
Coladarci modestly does not
see himself as particularly instru
mental in directing the school to
its present position, an attitude
which stems from his conception
of an administrator.
Coladarci sees two types of ad
ministrators: one who does
things as an executive, and one
with more of a catalytic function,
who motivates others to get
things done.
He puts himself in the latter
category.
"I'm not even trained as an ad
ministrator, but as a psychologist.
I see my function as trying hard to
support the kinds of things that
people here wanted to do on th'e
assumption that Stanford is very
different from most schools," he
said, referring to the quality of


Arthur Coladarci
people at the school.
He said that he tries to encour
age a community by "making it
possible for people to communi
cate more often." "For there is a
lot of cross-talk going on here be
tween a lot of prima donnas. We
are dealing with very strong
people."
Chairman Hans Weiler of the
Department of International De
velopment Education cited Col
adarci's contribution in mediating
conflict and providing for com
munication.
"He has been a superb manager
of conflict. When you have a high
powered faculty, you get terrible
prima donnas. He has been abso
lutely masterful in smoothing
conflicts," said Weiler.
One major change that has oc
curred under Coladarci is a sig
nificant increase in the percen
tage of minority students and fa
culty. Minority students now
comprise approximately 20 per
cent of the student body, up from
a mere handful when he became
dean.
Weiler also credited Coladarci
with successfully following up on
an initiative of his predecessor
James. Weiler said that by open
ing the School of Education to the
social sciences, it has distin
guished itself from virtually every
school of education in the coun
try, and allowed it to concentrate
on research — its trademark.
But one trait which distin
guishes this tireless teacher and
administrator is his sense of
humor, which he uses so effec
tively to put people at ease and
lighten up difficult situations.
Still said he will miss this humor
more than anything else when
Coladarci leaves. "He can make
situations that might be difficult,
easier," he said.
