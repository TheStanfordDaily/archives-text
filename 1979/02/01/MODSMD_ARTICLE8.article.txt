# BART fire details released

### 
Oakland (AP) — An
aluminum switch box cover
which fell from an earlier
train and short-circuited a
1000-volt rail caused the Bay
Area Rapid Transit fire
which killed one man and
left more than 40 other
people overcome by
smoke, a board of inquiry
said Tuesday.
The cover, which protects
electrical components on
the undercarriage of BART
cars, was "improperly sec
ured" and not adequately
checked at the Hayward
maintenance yard before
the fatal fire Jan. 17, the
BART inquiry board said.
The blaze broke out in the
tunnel which runs for more
than three miles under San
Francisco Bay. It trapped 40
passengers amid black,
toxic smoke which frus
trated firefighters' rescue
attempts. One firefighter
died.
The fire has forced the
shutdown of the transbay
tube until BART manage
ment can guarantee that
conditions in the tunnel and
on the trains are safe.
Here is the board's ver
sion of what caused the ac

cident:
The trouble began when a
Daly City-bound train pas
sed through the tube at
about 4:30 p.m. The switch
box cover, normally hung
by two hinges and secured
with a bolt, broke loose.
It bounced off the speed
ing train as it fell, damaging
not only the car but also a
third rail which runs beside
the tracks and carries 1000
volts of electrical current to
drive train motors.
Flashes of light
The 4:30 p.m. train stop
ped momentarily, then con
tinued. Passengers later re
ported seeing flashes of
light as it stopped. It was
taken out of service when it
reached the end of its run.
A sweep train detected
nothing wrong with the
tunnel track and apparently
did not see the fallen
aluminum cover.
The report said that the
22V2-by-15 , /j-by-'/2 inch
cover had damaged the
1000-volt third rail, in
sulators and other track
equipment.
Ten trains passed without
incident in the next Vh

hours before the ill-fated
6:05 p.m. train sped
through the damaged area.
Repeated strikes
Either the damaged third
rail, track parts or the fallen
aluminum cover struck the
train repeatedly, said Oak
land Fire Chief William
Moore, chairman of the
six-member board. He said
the train's contact shoe,
which slides alopg the third
rail drawing power, snap
ped.
The shoe, dangling from
its cable, began sparking to
the third rail and to train
parts, he added, and the
train automatically halted.
Air suspension bags that
keep trains raised off the
track burst, lowering the
cars and allowing the fire to
enter the cars through the
floor around the wheels,
the report said.
Moore said the major
conclusions of the board
were authored by Thomas
Pope, superintendent of in
spections for New York Ci
ty's Metropolitan Transit
Authority.
