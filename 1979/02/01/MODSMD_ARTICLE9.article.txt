# Remson disturbed about environment
## 
### Roger Batchelor 
"When I was about 50 years
old I went through a period of
reappraisal. I wanted to have
more impact."
After a few months of decid
ing how to reach this goal,
Irwin Remson, professor of
geology and chairman of
applied earth sciences here,
became involved in a field
where decision-making is an
everyday occurrence. Today,
as consultant to various groups
dealing with nuclear wastes,
Remson has found a way to fill
his need for "making an im

pact" and for bringing his sci
entific knowledge to society.
"I am terribly disturbed
about the environment," he
explained. "We've got this
radioactive waste from World
War II bombs and it's got to be
stored safely and perma
nently."
Remson is currently consult
ing with the National Academy
of Sciences (NAS) to devise
geological criteria for the per
manent storage of radioactive
waste. In addition, he serves as
consultant for the nuclear
waste repository at Hanford,
Wash., which is temporarily
storing radioactive plutonium
until the permanent repository
is built.
Three years
"Consulting for the NAS has
required three full years of
work so far," Remson said.
"More time is required this
year, with trips to Washington,
D.C."
And Remson's motivation is
not spurred on by financial at
tractions. Neither the NAS nor
Hanford pays the professor for
his consulting duties.
Although he is satisifed with
his present positions, Remson
has often suffered frustration
in consulting jobs. For one
thing, he has had no control
over the implementation of his
advice.
"Once I consulted for a land
development company," he
explained. "I saw ecological
damage about to be done and
no way for them to get around
it, so my report was negative.
After giving my report, I was
immediately replaced."
Slow to act
And when his ideas were im
plemented, action was often
slow. This problem has not
ended with his new positions.
"The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) tried to
bulldoze local public opinion
as they attempted to put a re
pository in Lawrence, Kansas,"
Remson explained. "Public
anger stopped the plans there.
Ever since, the NRC has been
extremely cautious about pub
lic opinion. There are now trip
licate reports, and panels
working for the NRC."
As a result, "the waste re
pository will be the most over
designed thing in the history of
human construction," Remson
said.
Public interest in this case
was justified, but was also a
source of frustration, Remson
admitted. Scientists, he said,
have to judge the values of
human lives and laymen can't
understand this principle.
"For example, in designing a
road, engineers must assign a
reasonable value to each life,"
he explained. "It seems crude,
but it is essential. When ex
tended to the nuclear issue,
people get upset. Some de
mand so high a value assign
ment that it would be impossi
ble to build anything, let alone
a nuclear waste repository.
"People feel this risk, no
matter how minimal, is unac
ceptable. But the quicker we
get the waste materials into a
permanent repository, the
safer they'll be."
