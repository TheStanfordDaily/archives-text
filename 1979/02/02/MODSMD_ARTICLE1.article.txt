# Senate listens to Coors accusers
## 
### Rob Lempert Senior staff writer 
The Adolph Coors Company was
accused of "gross, wholesale viola
tions of human rights" last night at
the ASSU Senate meeting by Na
tional AFL-CIO Coors boycott direc
tor David Sickler.
The senate voted after Sickler's
presentation to send an invitation to
John Sees, director of civic affairs for
Coors, to address the senate at their
next meeting. Sen. Tom Gart said he
had spoken to Sees and said he
would come if asked.
Sen. Ron Johnson will meet Mon
day with representatives from Coors
West, the local, independent dis
tributor of Coors beer, who has of
fered to finance an ASSU task force
to fly to Colorado to investigate the
situation at Coors' Golden plant.
A nationwide boycott has been or
ganized against Coors in support of
striking workers, who are protesting
the alleged degrading working con

ditions in the Coors plant, according
to Sickler.
Sickler, an employee in the Coors
brewery for 10 years beginning in
1963, said the symbol of the attitude
of the Coors management towards
its workers is the lie detector test the
company requires of all prospective
employees.
Sickler said he was "strapped" in a
chair anu asked questions about his
sexual life and political views before
he was hired by Coors. Though he
admitted he did not know exactly
what the questions on the test are
currently, he said he is worried be
cause management refuses to write
any of its reforms into a new con
tract.
Though no specific proposals have
been discussed by the senate, they
have debated supporting the boycott
by forbidding all ASSU business con
cerns from dealing with the company
or its product. Currently, Coors'
local distributor donates free beer to
groups on campus, financially sup

ports concerts organized by Special
Events, and is instrumental in the op
eration of the recycling center.
In other action, the senate elected
three new members to the Nomina
tions Committee to replace those
whose terms have expired. Michael
Werner, Keri Ostrofsky and Kamal
Elias were elected to the seven
member board which interviews and
appoints students to serve on Uni
versity committees.
The senate also passed a resolu
tion urging the Athletic Department
to reconsider its decision to prohibit
alcoholic beverages within Stanford
Stadium. Sen. Jim Esserman, co
author of the resolution, said Athle
tic Director Andy Geiger has assured
him that the matter would be recon
sidered sometime within the next
few months, as soon as Geiger has an
opportunity to acquaint himself with
the issues involved.
Geiger only recently assumed the
job of athletic director after the re
tirement of )oe Ruetz.

Johnson said members of his
committee for lighted tennis courts
has met with Geiger, who told them
funding for the project is available if
the senate can prove there is suffi
cient student interest. Johnson said
he plans to circulate a questionnaire
to this end.
The committee is investigating the
placing of lights on one or more of
the three groups of courts on cam
pus and possibly on some of the out
door basketball courts.
The senate approved the finance
committee's allocation of $200 to the
Stanford-in-Business group, $200 to
New Directions, and committed $50
to a new group, the Stanford Journal
of Political Economy, pending a list of
receipts and an estimate of printing
costs.
The senate also give $100
toward the Chicano Underground
Winter Onda, a program of Chicano
poetry readings, movies and music
to be held at Tresidder today.
