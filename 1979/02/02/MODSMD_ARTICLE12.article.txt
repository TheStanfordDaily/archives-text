# Moscone dies in heavy debt
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” Mayor
George Moscone, slain in City
Hall last November, was nearly
broke, heavily in debt and left
no will despite a $55,000 a year
salary.
When the 49-year-old mayor
was shot to death Nov. 27, he
had a few hundred dollars in a
savings account and about
$2000 in his checking account,
most from the $1*68.82
paycheck he received tive days
before he was killed, attorney
Tom Minder said Wednesday.
Minder, who is winding up
Moscone's financial affairs,
said Moscone had nearly
$200,000 in outstanding debts,
including bills that came in
after he died.
About $80,000 of that debt is
money still owed by the Mos

cone family on a luxurious new
home the mayor bought in
1976 for a reported $175,000.
Moscone also had taken out
a $50,000 home improvement
loan and owed another $35,000
for further improvements on
the house, including roof re
pairs, kitchen remodeling and
painting, Minder said.
Other miscellaneous bills,
consisting of "lots of odds and
ends" amount to as much as
$25,000, according to the at
torney.
He apparently had no in
come or investments beyond
bis mayor's salary, associates
said.
Moscone was fatally shot in
his office moments before city
Supervisor Harvey Milk also
was gunned down. Charged in
the case is former city Super

visor Dan White, who allegedly
was begging to be reappointed
to his job.
San Francisco court records
show Moscone, who was a
lawyer, left rio will for his wife,
Cina, and four children.
Friends who asked not to be
named attributed that to Mos
cone's inclination to "always
get involved in other people's
affairs and never get around to
his own."
Moscone's widow is eligible
for a total of about $126,490 in
state worker's compensation,
death benefits from his service
as a state senator and a pay
ment under city retirement sys
tem rules.
In addition, a memorial fund
for the education of his chil
dren has collected about
$260,000 so far, officials said.
