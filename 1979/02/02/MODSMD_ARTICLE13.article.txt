# Legalized gambling in Maine – it's more than just nickels and dimes now
## 
### 
Augusta, Maine (AP) —
Maine's nickel-and-dime
gambling law was passed to
benefit cub scouts, churches
and other charities. Six years
later, it has opened the door to
a multi-million dollar opera
tion with salesmen for Nevada
companies pushing slot
machines in bars, hotels and
bowling alleys.
Today, more than 700
"non-profit organizations" are
licensed to run one-armed
bandits, wheels of fortune,
poker games, beano, craps.
And of about 400 licensed
slot machines-, about 150 are
set up in bars and hotels —
even though they are spon
sored by "charities."
Slot-machine proliferation
has been especially heavy in
the last six months, helping
gambling to become a $17-
million business in Maine last
year, according to state police
records.
Of that total, slot-machine
distributors from as far away as
Nevada took $4.2 million out of
the state, according to State
Sen. Richard H. Pierce, who
wants the one-armed bandits
restricted.
Maine's new Commissioner
of Public Safety, Arthur Stil

phen, says he has no evidence
that organized crime is behind
the expansion, though he con
cedes that gambling "may have
burgeoned beyond what the
Legislature thought it ought to
become."
Stilphen jokes about it:"It
may be that we have to put
gambling in this state back into
the country fairs and churches
where it has always been."
But to Pierce, it is no joke. He
thinks organized crime is in
volved, and he wants a law pas
sed to sharply restrict the one
armed bandits.
But even Pierce is pessimistic
about the chances for his bill.
"How are you going to fight
the Elks, the American Leg
ion..." he says. "It's politically
impossible to wipe the thing
out."
The law says gambling is
permissible only to benefit
charity. It restricts bets to a
quarter and the return on a bet
to $150.
It also was written to bar slot
machines — "any machine
which operates by inserting a
coin, token or similar object."
But machine distributors got
around that with "remote con
trol gambling devices" — with
the whirling symbols of slot
machines but no slot for coins.

These, the bartender trig
gers electronically, after a cus
tomer pays at the bar for "cre
dits" equivalent to
dimes.
No change pours out when a
gambler wins — those, too, are
toted up as "credits" — but
lights flash, bells ring and cus
tomers warm to the thrill. A
gambler may drop $5 or $10 a
night before ambling back to
his seat at the bar for another
drink.
At first, these "slots"
sprouted up in Elks clubs,
American Legion Halls and re
creational clubs with names
like the Montagnard Snow
shoe Club and the Kitty Cat
Club in Lewiston.
It soon became clear that a
private lodge could average
$150 a night from each slot
machine. Many clubs have
two. Then, six months ago,
mini-casinos began popping
up in hotels and taverns in vir
tually every large city.
Now salesmen for dis
tributors actively recruit
"charities" to sponsor the slot
machines, says State Police
Corporal Robert McLaughlin,
who licenses games of chance
for the state. He adds that
charities are being "founded

overnight and applying for
gambling licenses the next
day."
Many of the charities are
legitimate. The Band Boosters
in the coastal resort of Old Or
chard Beach, for example, say
they earned $17,000 last year
from their casino and bought
new band uniforms.
But McLaughlin says he gets
five to ten applications a week
trom organizations he terms
"pretty shaky."
And a non-profit sponsor
generally earns only 25 percent
of the take from slots placed in
bars, after prize money is sub
tracted. The bar gets 25 per
cent, the distributor 50 per
cent.
Sometimes, McLaughlin
says, the bartenders who
handle the cash from the slot
machines are routinely handed
membership cards by the
non-profit sponsor. On the
Canadian border in Caribou,
for example, bartenders at the
Hotel Caribou had to join the
)aycees to keep their jobs.
"It's not any big deal," said
one. "You pay the Jaycees a
couple of dollars a year and go
to a couple of meetings. It's for
the purpose of running the slot
machines."

five to ten applications a week

"pretty shaky."

generally earns only 25 percent

bars, after prize money is sub

non-profit sponsor. On the

Augusta, Maine (AP) —
Maine's nickel-and-dime
gambling law was passed to
benefit cub scouts, churches
and other charities. Six years
later, it has opened the door to
a multi-million dollar opera
tion with salesmen for Nevada
companies pushing slot
machines in bars, hotels and
bowling alleys.
Today, more than 700
"non-profit organizations" are
licensed to run one-armed
bandits, wheels of fortune,
poker games, beano, craps.
And of about 400 licensed
slot machines-, about 150 are
set up in bars and hotels —
even though they are spon
sored by "charities."
Slot-machine proliferation
has been especially heavy in
the last six months, helping
gambling to become a $17-
million business in Maine last
year, according to state police
records.
Of that total, slot-machine
distributors from as far away as
Nevada took $4.2 million out of
the state, according to State
Sen. Richard H. Pierce, who
wants the one-armed bandits
restricted.
Maine's new Commissioner
of Public Safety, Arthur Stil

phen, says he has no evidence
that organized crime is behind
the expansion, though he con
cedes that gambling "may have
burgeoned beyond what the
Legislature thought it ought to
become."
Stilphen jokes about it:"It
may be that we have to put
gambling in this state back into
the country fairs and churches
where it has always been."
But to Pierce, it is no joke. He
thinks organized crime is in
volved, and he wants a law pas
sed to sharply restrict the one
armed bandits.
But even Pierce is pessimistic
about the chances for his bill.
"How are you going to fight
the Elks, the American Leg
ion..." he says. "It's politically
impossible to wipe the thing
out."
The law says gambling is
permissible only to benefit
charity. It restricts bets to a
quarter and the return on a bet
to $150.
It also was written to bar slot
machines — "any machine
which operates by inserting a
coin, token or similar object."
But machine distributors got
around that with "remote con
trol gambling devices" — with
the whirling symbols of slot
machines but no slot for coins.

These, the bartender trig
gers electronically, after a cus
tomer pays at the bar for "cre
dits" equivalent to
dimes.
No change pours out when a
gambler wins — those, too, are
toted up as "credits" — but
lights flash, bells ring and cus
tomers warm to the thrill. A
gambler may drop $5 or $10 a
night before ambling back to
his seat at the bar for another
drink.
At first, these "slots"
sprouted up in Elks clubs,
American Legion Halls and re
creational clubs with names
like the Montagnard Snow
shoe Club and the Kitty Cat
Club in Lewiston.
It soon became clear that a
private lodge could average
$150 a night from each slot
machine. Many clubs have
two. Then, six months ago,
mini-casinos began popping
up in hotels and taverns in vir
tually every large city.
Now salesmen for dis
tributors actively recruit
"charities" to sponsor the slot
machines, says State Police
Corporal Robert McLaughlin,
who licenses games of chance
for the state. He adds that
charities are being "founded

overnight and applying for
gambling licenses the next
day."
Many of the charities are
legitimate. The Band Boosters
in the coastal resort of Old Or
chard Beach, for example, say
they earned $17,000 last year
