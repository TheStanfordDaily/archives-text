# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Jay Martel The 						fabled premium cow 
### 
Lester was a good cow and
had good cow friends in the
pasture where he grazed. For
the first few years of his life, he
grazed happily in clover. After
these content years, he was
told lhat it was time to further
his career by moving to the en
closed farm corral.
"Do I have to go?" he asked
his cow friends.
"Of course," one friend
said, swatting flies with his tail.
"Anyone who has become a
premium cow has spent time in
the corral," another mumbled
through a mouthful of clover.
"Of course," Lester said.
Like all cows, he wanted very
much to be a premium cow of
all-around quality. He did not
argue at all when the owner of
the farm, Mr. Goodman, led
him to the corral and showed
him his trough.
Mr. Goodman's farm was
well-known for its premium
cows and, for the next few
years, Lester ate quite well and
everyone was proud of him.
He clearly saw that growing
large and fat was definitely
what he should be doing. Mr.
Goodman assured him of this

when he dropped corn into his
trough every morning. They
were both pleased when Lester
won high honors at fairs for his
impressive expanse.
After some time, Lester was
told that his years of prepara
tion were over, and that it was
timetoputtogood use what he
had accumulated during his
time in the farm corral.
"Do I have to go?" Lester
asked.
"Of course," one cow said.
"Your time is up," another
snapped.
"It's time you go out into the
big world, Lester," Mr. Good
man said.
"But what of my career?"
Lester asked, slightly distres
sed.
"All I really know how to do
is eat and . . . well . . . drop it
on the corral ground after I'm
through with it."
He was getting a little em
barassed. It seemed to him he
knew rather little for having
studied so long.
"Oh, there's nothing to
worry about," Mr Goodman
said soothingly. 'You're a
premium cow. Your future is
cut out for you."

He led Lester onto a truck.
The truck drove away from
the farm, and Lester could not
help but feel proud. Yes, he
certainly was a premium cow,
and that's what he had always
wanted, wasn't it? He. sniffed
cheerfully at the air rushing by
the back of the truck.
The truck drove straight to a
slaughterhouse where Lester
was made into many different
cuts of steak.
Moral: Before you decide
you want to be premium, make
sure it has nothing to do with
A-1 sauce.
