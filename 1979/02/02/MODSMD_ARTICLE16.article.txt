# Harrington and Goldenkranz
## Little Eleven 
### 
We have, at last count, at
least 100 people actively work
ing to prepare for Stanford's
participation on the Little Ele
ven Conference. The question
of what exactly the Little Eleven
is and why it is worth our time
inevitably arises.
Representatives from Stan
ford, University of Chicago and
the eight Ivy League Schools
began meeting last September
to develop plans for the con
ference, to be held in Philadel
phia during the last week of
February.
The conference is designed
to enable undergraduates from
schools which compete for
students and faculty, and look
to each other for guidance in
developing policy, to meet in an
attempt to develop a cohesive
student viewpoint on a wide
collection of issues.
Stanford has a great deal to
benefit from this conference.
Simple exchange of informa
tion on issues of common con
cern, as well as establishment
of channels of communication
with other universities are two
main goals.
New working solutions to
old problems learned from the
conference may be applied
here.
The conference is organized
around eight committees: Role
of the University in Social and
Political Problems; Extracur
ricular Activities and Athletics;
Student Government, Tuition,
Financial Aids and Admissions;
Academics and Advising;
Minority Affairs; Women's Is
sues; and Student Life. (The
content of each committee will
be discussed more fully in sub
sequent articles.)
Each committee will have
two to four representatives
from each school. Subcommit
tees will further specialize dis

cussion, with the average
working group consisting of
about 10 people.
Clearly, much of the confer
ence's success will rest on the
delegates' ability to reintegrate
information gained back into
the Stanford community.
Delegates accepted their
positions with the clear under
standing that their respon
sibilities will not end upon re
turning to Stanford from
Philadelphia. Upon their re
turn, delegates are responsible
for implementing the follow
ing methods of communica
tion:
—Writingand publishingthe
"Stanford Report" — a journal
of information gained from the
conference holding particular
relevance to Stanford policy
development.
—Making presentations to
appropriate University com
mittees.
—Briefing student organiza
tions through meetings or writ
ten communication.
—Making presentations to
the trustees, Faculty Senate,
and ASSU Senate.
—Organizing open forums
or speaking in dorms.
—Preparing reports and arti
cles for campus media.
There is still much to be
done. Though the delegation
has already been selected,
membership on each of the
committees is open to any in
terested student. We need the
support of the entire student
community in order to ensure
a successful convention.

majoring in psychology, and
Andrew Goldenkranz is a
senior majoring in human biol

coordinators for the Little Ele
