## Administration harasses sororities here 
### 
It has become all too familiar the past
couple of years to read in the Daily of
the University's latest harassment of
the sororities here on campus.
Last year the University was mag
nanimous enough to let women on
campus affiliate with national
sororities. Since then the University has
put forth a list of non-negotiable de
mands to be met before the sororities
are officially designated as the on
campus student groups that they are.
These demands include the prohibi
tion of letters of recommendation, and
other "outside" influences such as
sorority advisers. Until the sororities on
campus meet these demands, which di
rectly oppose long-held sorority tradi
tion of the nationals, they are barred
from using any campus facility, such as
Tresidder, dorm lounges or even
fraternities.
To justify such treatment of Stanford
students, Norm Robinson, head of Re
sidential Education, referred to the
"white upper-middle-class

background" of sororities in the past.
He said he thought the outside influ
ence of the nationals or letters of re
commendation might work against
some students here.
What is this?! First, Robinson makes a
sneering comment about the alleged
make-up of sororities. He then strongly
implies that A) women in sororities
have neither the judgment or the cour
age to make their own decisions de
spite influence from the nationals, or
that B) women in scorities now are
themselves of questionable moral
character and intent, and therefore not
to be trusted.
Indeed, Robinson would lead one to
believe that Stanford students in
sororities now are merely a bunch of
elitist racist pigs would conspire with
alumnae cohorts to snoop in the per
sonal affairs of rushees and gleefully
eliminate any girl whose parents' an
nual income is below $50,000, or is in
eligible for the Daughters of the Ameri
can Revolution.

Such an attitude is inaccurate, but
worse than that, it directly opposes the
University's philosophy that students
here are to be trusted to act in a respon
sible and mature manner.
In University literature we read end
less accolades to the general "wonder
fullness" of Stanford students, how
they abound in intelligence, maturity,
and wisdom. The Honor Code is de
scribed, and is claimed to be evidence
that the students here are treated as
responsible and "honorable" adults.
The University's treatment of those
women in sororities, however, belies
any such claims. Put succinctly, the
University does not trust its students in
sororities to conduct a rush, or run af
fairs with help from the sorority nation
als without "oppressing" their fellow
students not of "white upper-middle
class background."
Is this what the University thinks of its
women students?
The issue of sororities may seem in
consequential to some, but the Univer

sity's handling of the matter holds im
plications for every member of the
Stanford community.
It does not matter if you personally
have no interest in sororities, or even if
you would prefer that Stanford did not
have any. The issue is that a group of
students on this campus are not being
treated with the respect and the trust
that each of us expects as individuals in
this "community of scholars."
The University, if it really believes
that its students are worthy of trust and
respect, has no choice but to cease and
desist its harassment of women in
sororities here.
It must recognize officially what
exists in fact. The sororities are on
campus student organizations.
And it also owes these women, and
every Stanford student, an apology for
not treating them as people to be
trusted in their own decisions and af
filiations.

believe that Stanford students in
sororities now are merely a bunch of
elitist racist pigs would conspire with
alumnae cohorts to snoop in the per
sonal affairs of rushees and gleefully
eliminate any girl whose parents' an
nual income is below $50,000, or is in
eligible for the Daughters of the Ameri
can Revolution.

Such an attitude is inaccurate, but
worse than that, it directly opposes the
University's philosophy that students
here are to be trusted to act in a respon
sible and mature manner.
In University literature we read end
less accolades to the general "wonder
fullness" of Stanford students, how
they abound in intelligence, maturity,
and wisdom. The Honor Code is de
scribed, and is claimed to be evidence
that the students here are treated as
responsible and "honorable" adults.
The University's treatment of those
women in sororities, however, belies
any such claims. Put succinctly, the
University does not trust its students in
sororities to conduct a rush, or run af
fairs with help from the sorority nation
als without "oppressing" their fellow
students not of "white upper-middle
class background."
Is this what the University thinks of its
women students?
The issue of sororities may seem in
consequential to some, but the Univer

sity's handling of the matter holds im
plications for every member of the
Stanford community.
It does not matter if you personally
have no interest in sororities, or even if
you would prefer that Stanford did not
have any. The issue is that a group of
students on this campus are not being
treated with the respect and the trust
that each of us expects as individuals in
this "community of scholars."
The University, if it really believes
that its students are worthy of trust and
respect, has no choice but to cease and
desist its harassment of women in
sororities here.
It must recognize officially what
exists in fact. The sororities are on
campus student organizations.
And it also owes these women, and
every Stanford student, an apology for
not treating them as people to be
trusted in their own decisions and af
filiations.
