### Emily Sachar 
' Chanting "TengHsaio-ping's from the capitalist class; he's going to kiss
Jimmy Carter's ass," approximately 20 members of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade marched in formation through White Plaza
and Tresidder Union yesterday.
Dressed in red jackets and wearing "Down with U.S. imperialism"
buttons, brigade members marched to protest Teng's visit to the United
States to sign agreements establishing formal ties between the United
States and the People's Republic of China.
"We're going to spoil the garden party wherever Teng gets such a fitting
welcome," said one member.
"Teng's selling out the revolution in China. So now the Chinese are
going to be wage slaves under the veil of communism. This is not com
munism. They're turning into one big Taiwan," Dick Reffei, spokesman
for the brigade, added.
Passing students
Brigade members gathered before noon and marched in two single-file
lines from the Graduate School of Business to the engineering corner of
the Outer Quad. They stopped to distribute literature and collect money
from passing students.
"Teng is saying he needs to live under the wings of the United States to
get weapons so he can have a little modernized China," said Reffei.
"But China was meeting the needs of the people without this. Well,
now the rich can drive their Toyotas and wear their Pierre Cardin suits.
There will be a handful on top and the masses in poverty, and they call it
modernization?"
The brigade was also protesting the arrest of 69 youth brigade members
Monday night after a march in Washington D.C. to protest Teng's arrival
there.
"Bunch of crazies"
"They say this is a democracy. Then we're out chanting there and they
have to arrest us. The press is making us look like a bunch of crazies when
we're just trying to get a political message across. We're not trying to
disrupt anything," Reffei said about the Washington incident.
"Our members just continued to chant, even from (behind) the bars of
their jail cells. They're not giving in," he continued.
After marching through White Plaza, members stopped at Tresidder
Union to address patrons eating in the dining area.
"We are the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade," members yel
led. "What do we want? Communism. How are we going to get it?
Revolution."
The brigade staged protests Wednesday at UC-Berkeley and yesterday
at San )ose State University.
Brigade members who marched yesterday are students and citizens of
the Bay Area. Several are students here.
