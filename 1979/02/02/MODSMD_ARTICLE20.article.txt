Vicious turban
Your caricature portraying a
cobra snake-turbaned Kho
meini (Daily, )an. 29) was mis
leading, erroneous, vicious,
and provocative.
Not only were Iranian stu
dents hurt by such stupid and
unnecessary provocation by
the Daily, but those of us from
the Muslim and Third World
countries were.
We may or may not sub
scribe to Khomeini's ideologi
cal convictions but we all re
spect his courage and, most of
all, his independence of both
thought and action.
Needless to say, Khomeini is
not and cannot be a "favorite"
of either Americans or Soviets.
He serves neither camp and,
furthermore, he perplexes
both camps.
Neither capitalists nor Mar
xists can understand him or
appreciate his teachings.
Neither Americans nor the
Soviets can understand how a
Third World person would
dare be independent of them
and be acting on principles.
Khomeini, along with other
Third World leaders who prac
tice independence of mind and
action, such as Bu Medienne,
Allende, Gathafi, and Nasser,
perplex the lay and even the
educated Western observer.
Furthermore, such leaders
worry both the Western and
Soviet power-holders simply
because they are independent
and will not allow their nations
to be mere h jppets.
For what does the snake
stand? Why portray Khomeini
as a wicked man? Who mas
sacred thousands of Iranians,
Khomeini or the U.S.-puppet
shah? Who impoverished the
Iranian masses, Khomeini or
the U.S.-supported shah? Who
created SAVAC to torture and
horrify the Iranian people,
Khomeini or the shah?
It would be preferable if the
American media understood
the Iranian Revolution.

Rabbit analogy
Byrne's pregnant rabbit
analogy (Daily, |an. 31) should
be carried to its logical conclu
sion.

Besides being able to reab
sorb a zygote, rabbits also eat
unwanted young. I suggest
that instead of having an abor
tion, which is an "unnatural"
process, women should cook
and eat unwanted young. This
would be a more "natural"
thing for a human.
Moral arguments based on
examples from nature are
worthless. The positions of a
pregnant low-status rabbit and
a pregnant woman are in no
way comparable.
Natural abortion and
young-killing by rabbits illus
trate the practicality of abor
tion. But practicality cannot
justify it in humans.

New cartoon
Ah, another fine stride for
ward for the rights of America's
oppressed minorities. In
honor of the achievements
here, I am coming out and fi
nally using the creativity and
imagination that got me in
here.
I am proposing a new comic
strip. One that I promise will
offend no one, not one single
person. My cartoon strip will
consist of four completely
blank panels! That's right,
completely blank! How per
fect, how magnificently neut
ral. It couldn't possibly offend
anyone. Then the feminists,
blacks, Chicanos, gays, pre
meds, WASPs, democrats,
third-world, second-world, and
even first-world peoples,
would be safe from the op
pression of the comic strip.
And no one would be offended
. . . oops ... I just thought of
one group that might object.
Those poor, misguided people
who enjoy cartoons, and are
willing to risk being offended
to be able to read them, sigh.
Well, no one's perfect.

Real education
Have you ever thought why
you are attending Stanford
rather than any other school?
Perhaps your parents went
here, or you knew it was fam
ous. But now that you are here,
can you answer this question,
"Why should I beat Stanford?"
I just returned here after
spending three quarters study
ing at Humboldt State. I left
Stanford to find out why I
should be here, or whether I
should be here at all.
I realize now that the Stan

ford environment provides the
opportunity for someone to
obtain a valuable education. It
remains up to the individual to
profit from the wisdom of the
professors, the possibilities in
research, and the diversity of
the students.
There are many praise
worthy aspects of Stanford, but
I'd be best to point out a possi
ble weakness, in hopes you
might look for it and perhaps
correct it.
When I came here I was self
ish. The time demands my
freshman year at Stanford
made me ask constantly
whether something would be
nefit me or whether I would
have time to do it.
I met a recent Stanford grad
who told me that at Stanford
you have to choose your
friends. That scared me be
cause he was saying that there
was only time fora few people.
That's not right.
In our own self
centeredness we hide in our
homework, and turn away
from what really matters, our
relationships with people. I'm

not saying you should neglect
homework, but "be human."
Give time to someone who
wants to talk, take time to read,
discuss your views with some
one, volunteer some time to
kids, get away from your major
just once.
At Humboldt State there was
time to give to others, not be
cause there was necessarily
less work, but because people
had decided that others were
more important.
If you don't get away from
self-centeredness, you'll miss
out on a real education.

Lelanders
In the search for a new sym
bol for Stanford, let's look at
the university's roots.
Leland Stanford, a railroad
pioneer, founded it in memory
of Leland Stanford, Jr., who is
buried on the grounds.
I suggest the symbol of the
University should be an old

time locomotive and the team
should be called the "Lelan
ders."
To those who say that the
public does not know what that
means, I answer, "It's time that
they did."
