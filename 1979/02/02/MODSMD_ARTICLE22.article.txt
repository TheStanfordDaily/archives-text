## Hilton analysis faulty 
### 
Prof. Ronald Hilton told us
(Daily, Jan. 22) that West Euro
pean universities are declin
ing. There is no doubt that
Europe's colleges are declin
ing, but not for the reasons he
mentioned.
His explanations were rather
simplistic and sweeping.
Beyond being misinformed,
Hilton demonstrated an unwil
lingness to understand.
Admittedly, European uni
versities are currently in a great
mess. They lack funds, lack
contact between professors
and students, promise reforms
which never materialize, and
are corrupt. Quite a few highly
qualified graduate students
must give up dreams of
academic careers because they
cannot make a stable, decent
salary working as assistants.
But the Red Brigades, I am
afraid, have nothing to do with
it. They merely serve as a scape
goat.
Whatever is wrong always
seems to be connected with
the Red Brigades who, by the
way, are not even interested in
doing political work on cam
pus.
Hilton's article states
that protesters "covered the
walls (of universities) with
puerile paintings." I do not

know what he regards as
puerile but he seems to be re
ferring to drawings concerning
current political issues. Can
they be called "puerile"?
And later he writes: "In such
a city (Amiens) it is impossible
to believe in the inevitability of
progress."
I would like the author to
specify what he means by
progress and, by implication,
what it means to be progres
sive.
I passed by the University of
Milano during Christmas vaca
tion and happened to see on
the walls the slogan "Down
with the shah" and a drawing
of the Shah of Iran with a swas
tika. I am sure students (Ira
nians or Italians) who drew it
would not like their drawing to
be called "puerile."
In Hilton's opinion, how
ever, fighting against a feudal
monarch such as the shah is
not progressive.
In Â»hp eyes of a foreign scho
lar, even one who has "been
connected with European uni
versities for half a century,"
things can be oversimplified
and misinterpreted if not seen
in the contex of an entire soci
ety.
Hilton's argument seems to
be: if things go wrong in uni

versifies why not blame the
students who spend their time
in political meetings rather
than studying.
Yet Hilton is impervious to
the fact that European society
as a whole is more sensitive
than others to political issues,
both domestic and interna
tional, and that campuses
there are not ivory towers. Of
all Western Europe, only in
Switzerland did Hilton find that
"people live by a civilized ex
change of opinions." Again, I
do not know what he means by
"civilized," unless he thinks
that a country where until re
cently there was no women's
suffrage in national elections is
to be commended.
What impression one gets
depends on what one is look
ing for: a tranquil environment
for study, or information?
Perhaps misinformation?
In closing, Hilton mentioned
that after being interviewd by
the Tribune de Geneve, all that
was printed were his com
ments on the Peoples Temple.
Why should Hilton be sur
prised? After all, a bizarre
event like that is not supposed
to occur in a "civilized'' soci
ety.
