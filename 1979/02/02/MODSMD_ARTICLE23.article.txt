Kinß of Hearts ★ ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This very popular anti-war
comedy is probably over-rated; it
often gets a little too wrapped up
in its own whimsy for comfort.
But it's really very hard to resist
Alan Bates as the World War I
soldierwhoentersa small French
village to disarm a bomb and dis
covers that the town's only in
habitants are residents of the in
sane asylum. Bates falls in love
with the completely looney but
still very charming Genevieve
Bujold, and they all live madly
ever after. Director Philippe De-
Broca manages to maintain a
pleasantly light tone throughout.

Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipw/ccked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.

Semi-Tough ★★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
If you liked the book by Sports
Illustrated writer-god Dan Jen
kins, you may wonder what the
hell happened to it on the way to
this Michael Ritchie (Smile)
movie. Ritchie is interested in
about 10 too many things, and
this movie often appears to be
falling apart, but Burt Reynolds
does an amazing fake Cary Grant
impression and camps his way
through — saving the movie.
With |ill Clayburgh and Kris Kris
tofferson.
—Ron Lillejord
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
This movie now seems a little
dated by the slickness ot its love
story and by the inclusion of sup
remely yechy Burt Bacharach
tunes. But BCATSK is, above all, a
very entertaining movie: William
Goldman's script gives Paul
Newman and Robert Redford
some pretty funny things to say to
each other; Director George Roy
Hill keeps the action moving
along briskly, for once; and the
ending, though certainly not
precedent-shattering, is agree
ably anti-heroic.
—J.M.
Open City ★★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Director Roberto Rossellini
and his crew of Italian patriots
made this near-documentary of
occupied Italy while the Germans
were still entrenched on Italian
soil. Rossellini handles his poten
tially melodramatic subject mat
ter so well that it becomes ex
tremely moving. This was Anna
Magnani's first major role; Sergei
Amidei and Federico Fellini
wrote the script.

Que la Fete Commence ★★
Wednesday, Bishop
The title translates as "let joy
reign supreme," but this movie
could've used a lot more joy and
quite a bit less running length. Its
glossy production deals with the
decadence in the lives of the aris
tocracy in pre-revolutionary Fr
ance. Que La Fete Commence is
appealing to the eye and man
ages to be sporadically interest
ing. Phillipe Noiret, Christine
Pascal and jean Rochefort star;
Bertrand Tavernier, better
known for The Clockmaker, di
rected.
—J.M.
Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Clay Theater, San Francisco
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy withan IQof 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has a
decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Palo Alio Square -kikifk
This nearly flawless thriller,
which deals with an invasion by
aliens who come in the form of
harmless-looking flowers, will
have you looking suspiciously at
every vegetable in your re
frigerator. lOTBS is set in San
Francisco, and seldom has the
city looked more beautiful than
here as the control center for the
take-over of the human race.
Donald Sutherland and Brooke
Adams star as two people who
are desperately trying to keep
their own identities; Leonard
Nimoy is the villain who works to
take them away. Phil Kaufman di
rected, stunningly.
—J.M.
Autumn Sonata "k°k-k
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.
In Praise of Older Women ★
Palo Alto Square
This i> notable only because it
is probably the most sexually
explicit film released under an
"R" rating. Other than that, how
ever, this story of, according to
the press release, "the amorous
adventures of a virile young man,
glorifying in the sexual prowess
of older women," has little to
commend it: the single-minded
plot gets downright boring. Tom
Berenger is featured; karen Black
is his first "older woman." Hun
garian George kaczender directs.
—J.M.
Movie-Movie ★ ★★
Old Mill
Stanley Donen, who directed
Singing in the Rain, possibly the
greatest musical Hollywood ever
produced, directed this skillful
parody ol a 'JOs double bill.
One r ,i boxing film, in a concise
black-and-white imitation called
Dynamite Hands. The other is a
mu-ical called Baxter's Beauties of
T> < < filrrvd in superblv gaudv
thirtvish color. George C. Scott
U suipn-ingly adept with his
comedy roles in each of the two
tilms within a film. His imperso
nation ot a Ziegfield-type Broad
way producer named Spats Bax
ter is very sleek.
—J.M.
The Wiz ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical; lots of every
thing — but make sure we don't
offend anybody. In his desire to
energize this sprawling mess,
Sidney Lumet, the director, sim
ply increased the budget, turned
the volume up and enlarged the
sets. Subtlety and individuality
are trampled by all the technol
ogv.
The movie has huge sets, hun

dreds of dancers and an awe
some array of multicolored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? You can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at.
—R.L.
I ord of the Rings ★
Old Mill
One of last year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi 11nti the Cat and
Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
c rudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after
more than two hours we are in
formed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—J.M.
Mo Time For Breakfast
Aquarius Theatre, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
this is a good movie about a doc
tor who discovers how comfort
less the ministrations of her pro
fession can be when she finds
she is dying of cancer. Annie
Girardot, who gave last year's
Dear Detective any merit it pos
sessed, turns what was poten
tially soap-opera material into a
very moving performance.
—J.M.
Magic ★★
Old Mill
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's a dummy in the |udy Gar
land part and the star-on-the
way-down role is taken by An
thony Hopkins as a ventriloquist.
Director Richard Attenborough
pulls off one or two scary mo
ments, but this pseudo
psychological story about a ven
triloquist who becomes obses
sed with his own mannequin has
been done many times before —
and better.
—J.M.
California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets off
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the Jane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant tor making the
ordinary sound witless and
forced.
—R.L.
Bre.td <>•<'' r horolate itifir
Bijou, Palo Alto
Fins story ot an .lalian immig
lant who is b„!!cred by the sys
tem when he tries to make a go of
it in Switzerland's promised land
doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this movie
has a wit and warmth which make
it eminently watchable. Nino
Manfredi, as the immigrant, has
one of those faces which can
make nearly anything seem
either funny or tragic. Anna
karina is fine as an immigrant
from Greece; Franco Brusati di
rected.
