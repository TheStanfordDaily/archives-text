War and Remembrance

Herman Wouk obviously
wants a lot of people to read
War and Remembrance ; he
exploits the most funda
mental mass market tools,
but through pure force of
will, honesty and evident
compassion, Wouk avoids
many of the typical bestsel
ler traps and comes up with
something huge, accessible
and sometimes very great.
In 1962, Wouk began the
massive project that has
culminated in War and Re
membrance. Speaking just a
little too broadly, the sub
ject of the novel is the Sec
ond World War.
Having taken the central
figures in the novel, an
American family named
Henry, up to Pearl Harbor in
the 885-page "prologue,"
The Winds of War (pub
lished in 1971), Wouk now
throws them into the vortex
of the war, ending the book
in the days just after the
atomic bombing of Japan.
Improbable
Victor Henry, very much a
naval man, is the head of the
Henry family and is the
major c haracter in the book.
Wouk has Victor do an im
probable number of things
in an improbable number of
places. From Tehran to Oak
Ridge he ranges. Through
the course of both novels,
Victor meets Mussolini, Hi
tler, Churchill, Stalin,
Roosevelt and Truman, as
well as Eisenhower, Halsey
and Nimitz; he has flown in
a bomber over Germany
and rode in a tank on a
Soviet battlefield; and fi
nally (and more plausibly),
he commands a heavy
cruiser at Midway and loses
the ship in combat off
Guadalcanal.
Enormous landscape
Such globe-trotting is a
necessary compromise tor

the storyteller; WWII is an
enormous landscape to try
to fit into a workable
framework, and Wouk is
not entirely successful in
overcoming this problem.
Improbabilities aside,
Wouk deals with things like
the American internment of
Japanese-Americans with
the barest reference; it's an
important subject, but
Wouk can't fit it into his
narrative. There's simply
too much to control.
Wouk's other bestselling
compromise, the seemingly
required series of love tang
les, is a major weakness
here. The reason for this is
thatWouk has trouble creat
ing women who are more
than mere accessories to
the men in the novel.
Wouk's heart simply isn't in
it, and the book's portrayal
of men-women relation
ships is thus far from satisfy

ing.
Wouk's heart is with his
hatred of war; the major
purpose of the novel is to
make people remember the
horror of the war in such a
way as to emphasize the
point that, as Wouk puts it,
"either war is finished, or
we are."
Wouk's hatred of war
often mixes uneasily with
his love of the heroism of
the people — specifically,
for Wouk, the men — who
fight it. Author and reader
both get caught up in the
excitement of a battle such
as Midway or Leyte Gulf;
Wouk brings the reader full
force into his narrative at
such points. The battles are
portrayed, like most of the
history in the novel, with
lucidity and sharpness, but
you often lose sight of the
main theme.

Where Wouk's hatred of
war shows itself most clearly
and effectively is in his de
scription of the Nazi "Final
Solution'' and the fictional
experience of two Jews with
it.
Wouk, a Jew, wisely
realizes that the truth about
the camps, presented sim
ply, will be more than effec
tive enough for his pur
poses, and he avoids the
sensationalistic and bom
bastic writing others often
employ. In one 13-page
passage in particular, Wouk,
with stark, harsh prose,
writes of the ride of a train
load of Jewish prisoners
bound for Oswiecim — Au
schwitz.
Suspense
As the train moves on, the
suspense of pure horror
grips you; the present
tense narrative heightens
your frustration at not being
able to stop what is happen
ing. At the end,your vague
feeling that such an atrocity
can never be allowed to
happen again is given real
form.
But the process is inexor
able for the older |ew in the
narrative: "his face is less
contorted than others,
though nobody notices one
old thin dead body among
thousands ... his body on
an iron cradle, with two
children's bodies piled on
top of him because he is so
small, goes into an oven.
The iron door with a glass
peephole slams shut. The
bodies rapidly swell and
burst, and the flames burn
the fragments like coal. Not
until the next day are his
ashes carted to the Vistula in
a big truck loaded with
human ash and bone frag
ments, and dumped into
the river."
It is the terrifying vivid
ness of passages like these
that give War and Remem
brance its flashes of great
ness. There are too many
tensions here to sustain this
greatness, however;
bestseller values can only
take you so far. But even the
humblest, least talented
writer, and Wouk is cer
tainly more than that,
should be given high praise
for such an ambitious and
honest effort. If Wouk
shakes one person up with
his big book, then he has
done more than enough,
and with the path Wouk has
taken, he will probably
shake many.
