Now and Then

An overwhelming concern with defining
one's existence is not merely a function of
old age. I'm hit with it all the time. Robert
Penn Warren considers the problem of defin
ition ir\ Now and Then: Poems 7976-7978; this
concern is the central "impulse" of the vol
ume.
Warren continues with the same basic
form and style of his earlier work — the ideas
and images are tightly constructed, and he
does not always keep to a strict line length or
rhythm pattern. He still draws heavily from

his past (in the South) with a stress on sharing
it rather than becoming absorbed in it. His
attitude toward the people he describes
(creates) is never cynical. So whether he
seems to be on the outside looking in or the
inside looking out, we're right there beside
him. In these most recent poems, Warren is
somewhat more straight forward and direct.
The interplay of many factors, including
the "then" and the "now" define the whole.
While examining these parts and their rela
tionships is one way of attempting to assem
ble meaning; the parts, by their nature, are
often fleeting or imperceivable. In his poem
"Picnic Remembered," from Selected
Poems: 1923-1945, Warren described this dif
ficulty:
The then, the now: each cenotaph
Of the other, and proclaims it dead.
Or is the soul a hawk that, fled
On glimmering wings past vision's path,
Reflects the last gleam to us here
Though sun is sunk and darkness near
-Uncharted Truth's high heliograph?
The gleams of truth are what give definition
to life; trying to catch them (in poetry) is a
way of breaking its bleakness.
Once again, Warren concentrates on sol
itude, nature, the South, memories and
dreams in the individual poems. But now
more than ever, he is obsessed with the need
to arrive at something — he questions more
desperately. This new volume is divided into
two sections, Nostalgic and Speculative.
One of the longer poems in the volume,
"American Portrait: Old Style," combines
most of these themes in its shifting patterns
of thought. Warren recalls details from his
boyhood in the South (Kentucky), centering
on the grave-shaped trench where he and his
friend "K" used to invent games during the
summer. As they grew older, he and K went
different ways, Warren going out into the

world, and K remaining behind to join the
"Big Leagues." Warren goes back to visit k,
and walks to the trench, trying to make some
sense of their lives.
The other poems in the Nostalgic section
are also rich in their descriptions of the land,
the people and the life of the South. Warren
shows how a boy interprets the tragic tale of a
"dirt-farmer" who must shoot his sick wife,
and describes an old flame ("Sausage legs,
maybe some kind of braids . . The most
satisfying of all is "Red-Tail Hawk and Pyre of
Youth." It is remarkable in its construction,
moving subtly from a concrete experience of
Warren's past to a stunning universal
"gleam" of truth.
In the Speculative section, the poems are
more varied. "First Dawn Light" captures its
moment with alarming simplicity:
By lines faintei gray than the faintest
geometry
Of chalk, on a wall like a blackboard, day's
first light
[Defines the window edges. Last dream, last
owl-cry
Now past, now is the true emptiness of
night . . .
A more conversational tone helps many of
the poems become tragically funny, as a few
lines of "Little Black Heart of the Telephone"
indicate:
That telephone keeps screaming its little
black heart out:
Nobody there? Oh, nobody's there!-and the
blank room bleeds
for the poor little black bleeding bean of the
telephone . . .
Tell the goddam thing to shut up! Only
It's not ringing now at all, but I
Can scrutinize it and tell that it's thinking
about
Ringing, . . .
Warren also uses a conversational tone in
"Love Recognized" to create a love poem
that is witty, not flowery or sickeningly
gushy.
Some of the poems deal more directly with
the central theme of this volume. "Heart of
the Backlog" is one of the best of these (. . .
How wide is the world! How fleeting and
thin/ Its mark of identity . . .). But "When the
Tooth Cracks — Zing!", "Sister Water" and
"Memory Forgotten" work too. "Sister Wa
ter" is perhaps more harsh than the others. In
it, Warren talks about lying alone in bed, and
finally being able to distinguish something —
the sound of the garbage truck in the next
block:
. . ."Cod-"
You think, with a stab of joy, "He loves us all.
He will not
Let all distinction perish." You cannot pray.
But
You can wash your face in cold water.
And with the same urgency, in "Memory For
gotten," Warren asks, "How much do we
forget that is ourselves—. .."
A sense of mortality pervades "Heart of
Autumn," the last poem of the volume.
Watching the wild geese, Warren notes:
"How tirelessly V and V arrows the seasons
logic." While the geese fulfill their destiny by
their nature, he does not know why he is
here. But he knows that he will complete his
destiny: "And (His) heart is impacted with a
fierce impulse/ To unwordable utterance —/
Toward Sunset, at a great height."
