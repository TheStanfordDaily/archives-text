## Updike and 'The Coup': the great white writer goes to Africa 
### 
The Coup
John Updike
Alfred A. Knopf
299 pp. $8.95
In a general attempt to
keep up with the Times, the
national best-seller list and
the books forwarded by pub
lishers, the Daily asked me to
review Updike's The Coup.
To dispense with the
necessary details, a descrip
tion — ripped off verbatim
from the dust jacket (might as
well get the horse's version
from the horse's mouth) —
follows:
")ohn Updike's new novel
describes violent events in
the imaginary African nation
of Kush — a large, land
locked, drought-ridden,
sub-Saharan territory ruled
by Colonel Hakim Felix Ellel
lou. Colonel Ellellou has four
wives, a silver Mercedes and
a fanatic aversion — cultural,
ideological and personal — to
the United States. But the
U.S. keeps creeping into
Kush; the repercussions of
this subversion constitute the
events of The Coup. The time
of the novel is more or less
that of the last year of Richard
Nixon's presidency, with
flashbacks to the Eisenhower
era. Colonel Ellellou tells his
own story, sometimes in the
third person."
The book is selling quite
well these days. Updike is
considered one of America's
better novelists; the New
York Time s (and most
everyone else) liked it, and the
Times' Magazine section jlist
happened to run a major arti
cle on the author the same

week the book was reviewed.
(Convenient coincidence or
strange politicking going on
here — perhaps the Times felt
they owed him one, since his
last couple of books didn't
get raves, in spite of his repu
tation?)
The article on Updike
lauded him for finally moving
out of the realms of suburbia
(mentally; fictionally) and
thinly-veiled autobiography,
and on to new vistas (in this
case "Africa" and his first
ho nest-to-goodness,
created-from-scratch charac
ters). Still, to this reader, the
Congrats seem a bit over
blown — outside of a change
of sets and costumes, and
smatterings of Arabic-ef. al.
dialects thrown in, perhaps
we might as well be in the
burbs?
While Updike lays havoc to
American "imperialism'' ab
road (using hvperbolic
worst-of-the-'6os Peace
Corps and CARE boffos — a
little stale by now — and
under-sophisticated and
wornout McDonalds and
Coca Cola metaphors) one
must wonder if there aren't
overtones of an "imperialism
of the mind, of the creative
spirit" going on here?
Potential
The premise of the book
holds potential — coups and
counter coups in a drought
wasted Moslem country
which is also a point of inter
national intrigue as the
"super paranoids" infiltrate
and vie for control. And Up
dike does manage to occa
sionally hit |ust the right
note: are the Soviet-built and

manned arms installations
real or paper-mache props in
some greatei game? Ellellou
reflecting with the disposed
king on the nature of ruler
ship and Kush; the Colonel
wondering which — if any —
of "his" children are really
his.
Still, the slowly dying coun
try is too swathed in lush ver
biage to even seem drought
ridden; the Colonel's marital
hassles and extra-marital af
fairs seem to have more to do
with the "politics" of the
country than much of any
thing else does; mirages of
Golden Arches floating over
the desert and a U.S. foreign
service agent toasting to

death inabonfireof "Trix, Kix
and Pops," seem a little too
cute. Is that Peter Sellers in
burnoose and dark glasses
loping over the desert for a
camel?
Malcolm X
Updike confesses to using
Malcolm Vs autobiography
to gather his portrait of
"blacks - at - predominately
white-colleges"; one can
only presume that Malcolm is
turning over in his grave at
this one.
And somehow, while Africa
does have its ironies and
paradoxes, this book of ver
bal glitter, arch archetype,
and — may I say it? — cliches
— fails to really plumb them,

and certainly never captures
the terror or sorrow that lie
underneath.
♦ * *
Updike is coy and clever,
perhaps "a writer's writer":
master of the extended, tor
tured metaphor, self
conscious, slathering his
prose with adjectives, con
volutions, adverbs and ar
cane terms, the same way
Baskin-Robbins can doctor its
vanilla ice cream beyond rec
ognition. Still, in the end —
or rather underneath — it's
vanilla and maybe ice milk, at
that.
If you enjoy reading things
like, "Directly overhead, an

advance scout of the starry
armies trembled like a pearl
suspended in a gigantic crys
talline goblet of heavenly
nectar," or . . when the
nomad does not understand,
he moves on, his mental nar
rowness complementing the
width of his wandering life,
which might derange more
open minds" (which sounds
great, until you think about it)
— you're welcome to read all
299 pages, and will probably
love it.
Otherwise, leave the pre
cocious authorand his critics,
who, embarrassed at having
created a monster, have been
forced to uphold Updike's
name rather than admit an
error in judgment, and are
now passing out brownie
points because Updike has
finally moved out of a territ
ory they've all grown bored
with long ago.

Good reads and better
bets:
The Bass Saxaphone, by
Josef Skvorecky, Knopf,
$8.95.
Two novellas and a nice in
tro. Music as the language
beyond words and political
ideology. Life, love and jazz
behind the Iron Curtain, with
all of the love and bitter
sweetness an emigre can re
nder to the sub|ec t
fangs out and makes you
bleed a little for your laugh
ter. What Heller did for
WWII, Coover does for the
McCarthy era. Perhaps no

one else has so revealed the
language of the Great Ameri
can Dream and played with
variations of the "civil relig
ion," so successfully.
The Origin of the Brunists,
by Robert Coover, Bantam.
(Reprint from 1966).
Somewhere between Gore
Vidal's Messiah, Herbert's
Dune and Jonestown — cults
and revivalism in a middle-
American minetown. Funny
sometimes, with some
scenes that will make your
heart break, and a lot to make
you think once or twice,
especially in light of recent
events. Excellent command
of his various characters' var
ious worlds. The novel's seer
is a Giovanni Bruno; Gior
dano Bruno was a 16th cen
tury philosopher of the her
metical persuasion. One
wonders. . . .
The Magic journey, by John
Nichols, Holt paperback,
$7.95.
By the author of The
Milagro Beanfield War. A
favorite of the reviewer's
friends these days. "Progress
and Betterment" come to a
sleepy Southwestern town,
starting with an hysterical
premise, and leaving tears
and laughter and a cast of un
forgettable characters (and a
stuffed whale) along the way.
In the end, a serious political
nqv«Lp«rhaps revolutio
gra< to
of
inherem virtue and impossi
ble reconciliation that can
occupy the same place and
time. A must for unwilling
cynics and flagging idealists.
