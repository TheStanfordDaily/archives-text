# Cheated by the '60s

### 
Within the covers of Sec
rets and Surprises exists a
cheated and disillusioned
middle-class America. The
characters in Ann Beattie's
collection of 15 short stories
have experienced the 1960s
only to find themselves con
fused as to what they want
anymore and why. They
travel from one lover to the
next, from one home to the
next, acquiring children
and gray hair in the process.
Beattie's concise and
graceful style carries the
reader smoothly through
each story. In a few sen
tences she can create very
real, contemporary charac
ters and their environ
ments. Most of the stories
are written in intimate third
person: the detachment of
reader from action counters
any possibility of sentimen
tality in the collection.
"I often write about the
people who, if anything,
know too much," Beattie
said. For the most part her
people jadedly accept the
destruction and renewal of
interpersonal relationships.
Does this sound depres
sing? Not at all, for the
stories leave one contemp
lative rather* than morose.
The ironic touches of
humorand delicately beaut
iful descriptions make for
pleasurable reading:
I raise the Octoscope to eye
level, and in floods the pic
ture: the fields spread white
with snow, the plakest rip
ple of pink at the horizon -
eight triangles of the same
image, as still as a painted

picture when my hand is
steady on the Octoscope.
Bat the Cat darts from under
a juniper bush to crouch be
tween my legs. It will rain or
snow. Pink blurs to pearly
gray. This is the dead of
winter.
-("Octoscope," p. 108)
While other stories have
"happy" endings, "La Petite
Danseuse" ends most posi
tively. The protagonist,
Diana, actively refuses the
distorted vision of life that
her lover tries to force on
her. Although she also must
reject him, one cannot help
but feel relief at her escape
from a bitter existence.
The longest story,
"Friends," exemplifies the
lives of '60s graduates who
are stumbling into the '70s.
A large group of friends
readily trades loyalties and
lovers, neglecting the re
sponsibilities of parent
hood and marriage in favor
of immediate pleasures.
Beattie says that her
characters recognize "the
artificial ordinary." Their ac
tions lead them nowhere.
We often leave them exactly
where we found them, al
though the things around
them have shifted.
Beattie's clean, terse
prose alone makes Secrets
and Surprises worthwhile
reading. Her well-formed
stories are like "shells and
some acorn caps, a polished
stone or two . . . objects to
run through" your fingers
slowly, then turn over and
ponder.
