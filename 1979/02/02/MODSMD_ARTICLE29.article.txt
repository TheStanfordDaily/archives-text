A Lover's Discourse
Roland Barthes
Hill and Wang
188 pp. $10.00
Roland Barthes has been
considered primarily as a struc
turalist and a literary critic. Ac
tually he is both and neither.
Barthes would probably de
scribe himself as a
"semioiogist" — a field of in
quiry which Barthes developed
from a mere passing comment
in the writings of Sassure.
Semiology, ostensibly, is the
study of signs and their mean
ings, but in practice it is an at
tempt to view the actions of life
as if they were scenes in a
novel. Life, like Moby Dick,
contains a series of highly de
veloped symbols; and our
morning meal may, perhaps,
be as full of hidden meanings
as the great white whale —
maybe even more so according
to Barthes. Thus Roland
Barthes has run rampant over
the foundations of society with
all of the vigor of an academi
cian let loose on the real world.
Intriguing ond unusual

The results of this field of in
quiry can be both intriguing
and unusual. In Mythologies,
my favorite of Barthes' books,
he writes not only of writers
and philosophies, but of the
striptease, the new Citroen, TV
wrestling, Greta Garbo and
Einstein's brain. Each of these,
for Barthes, is a semiological
gold mine waiting to be tapped
— often with enlightenment,
occasionally with absurdity,
but always with profundity.
It would seem natural, there
fore, that Barthes should even
tually turn his attention to the
subject of love, and the
semiological aspects of ro
mance and courtship. This is
precisely what Barthes has
done in his latest book to reach
America, A Lover's Discourse.
The 'lover's discourse'
The best works on this
amorous subject — books I
cherish >»uch as Stendhal's On
Love and Fielding's Tom Jones
— show that this seemingly in
explicable emotion is, in fact,
full of the most precise and
understandable logic. Barthes
addresses himself to the quirks
of the lover's thoughts and
language, what he calls the
"lover's discourse," and
searches each phrase for even
the most minute contour of
meaning. To assist in this expli
cation Barthes draws freely
from his own favorite authors
and sources — Goethe,
Baudelaire, Nietzsche, even
friends and acquaintances —
who are given credit by a nota
tion in the margin of the page.
Alphabetical order
Barthes' method of organiza
tion betrays his structuralist

roots. Barthes defies the sig
nificance of time by writing
many of his books, not in
chronological order, but in al
phabetical order. Even his au
tobiography — the highly en
tertaining Roland Barthes, is ar
ranged from A to Z rather than
from childhood to old age.
Vet where does this avoi
dance of chronology lead? I re
call reading about a novelist
who wrote a long book without
once using the letter e; I am
sure it became pointedly obvi
ous to this author, even after
just a few paragraphs, that by
freeing himself from a letter he
was placing himself under the
most severe of restrictions. If
chronology is an impediment
to clear thinking, as many
structuralists claim, is an al
phabetical system any less con
fining' Doubtless more so, I
would argue.
Game of blindfold chess
Sartre has argued that no au
thor chooses his form; he sim
ply writes and later determines
form from what he has written.
Barthes opposes this view in
Writing Degree Zero, his first
major work; and his alphabeti
cal exercises seem to be of
fered as evidence for the pro
secution. Arbitrary form is, in
itself, a highly structured type
of form, Barthes would argue,
and it is this that gives A Lover's
Discourse its unusual brand of
resonance. Each item, or chap
ter, does not really relate to the
preceding or succeeding
item; Barthes tries to force his
reader to comprehend the
work as a whole, but ultimately
the attempt to do so collapses
to an elaborate game of

blindfold chess. Is it really pos
sible to keep all of that in one's
mind at once? Obviously
Barthes thinks it is.
Morbid curiosity
Ultimately we excuse
Barthes his eccentricities be
cause of the strength ot his
writing. He seems to delight in
advocating the untenable posi
tion and making it ultimately
plausible and even probable.
The more absurd the position
is, the more vigorous and in

tenso is Barthes' approach. His
joint essay 011 Loyola and de
Sade seems motivated by the
same typ£ ot morbid curiosity
which would inspire a scientist
to breed a fish and an ape. Yet
by the time we have finished
Barthes' exposition wfc are in
clined to look with favor on his
experiment. A Lover's Dis
course is perhaps, difficult to
agree with but extremely easy
to enjoy.
