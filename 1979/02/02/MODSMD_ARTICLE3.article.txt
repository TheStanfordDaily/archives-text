# Students devise group to obtain freedom of Soviet Jewish family
## 
### David Frank 
Two students here have formed a student-taculty
committee in order to mount what they hope will be a
massive letter-writing campaign that will enable a lewish
family to leave the Soviet Union.
"The most effective way to help members of a Soviet
lewish family refused exit visas is to write them letters to
let them know that someone cares they exist," said
senior Leesa Fields, one of the committee organizers.
The ultimate goal af both Fields and co-founder
sophomore Susan Coskey is to get the entire University
community involved in writing letters to the four
member Rosenstein family in Moscow.
Dr. Grigori Rosenstein, a specialist in cybernetics —
the comparative study of the human nervous system and
mechanical devices including computers — was dismis
sed from his job in 1973 when he applied for an exit visa
for himself and his family, according to Fields.
Repeated demands
Every six to eight months since then Rosenstein has
repeated his demands, but has been refused because of
the "secret nature" of his job, she said.
All letters sent to the Rosensteins will be sent air mail,
registered, and with a return receipt requested, Coskey
said. If the receipt is returned, the writer will know that
his or her letter has been received by the Rosensteins. If
not, he or she can fill out a tracer form "which puts
additional pressure on the Soviet government to deliver
the letter," she said.
According to Coskey, the Rosensteins mail is often

censored or not delivered. This means that many letters
have to be sent to get a few through the censors.
"There are many Soviet Jewish families in a similar
situaton," said fields, "but one past example has shown
that it's better to concentrate on one family."
Explained success
She explained the success of Columbia University's
drive to obtain the release of Soviet )ew Vitali Rubin
in the early 19705. "A committee at Columbia got the
entire university to focus on the release of that one
man," said Fields.
"It got to the point where the president of the univer
sity said that he wouldn't allow any more Soviet visitors
on campus until Rubin was released, she added.
Eventually, Columbia invited Rubin to lecture and the
Soviet government let him leave the country, she said.
Similarly, what the two women hope to do here is
generate enough interest in the family to have Rosens
tein or his wife invited to speak.
If the Soviet Union refuses to let either of the two
leave to lecture here, it "will just re-emphasize the fact
that there is an oppression of human rights, especially
those of lews, in the country," said Coskey.
Conducting seminars
Rosenstein and his wife have tried to keep active in
social affairs by conducting Seminars on Judaism and
Jewish culture, Coskey said. As a result of these "dissi
dent" activities, the Rosensteins have been threatened
and arrested by the KGB, the Soviet secret police.
