# Women face USC, Fresno
## Cards try to turn it around SPORTS 
### Chris Haft 
A season, for most sports
teams, often tends to resemble
a novel. The beginning may be
slow and tentative, or fast and
action-packed.
Towards the middle of the
season certain patterns begin
to emerge. The front-line
players establish themselves
with heroic deeds, and the
team itself endures one of
three fates: great success,
dreary failure, or fretful incon
sistency.
As a 9-9 team that has experi
enced brilliant victories and
ignominious defeats, Stan
ford's basketball squad falls
into the last category.
Time remains
Yet with nine games remain
ing, the Cardinals still have
time to make this campaign a
winning one. Stanford faces
Arizona State tonight in Maples
Pavilion at 8 p.m. and Arizona
tomorrow, games which could
determine what the rest of the
season will be like for coach
Dick Dißiaso's men.
Each team possesses un

questionably fine talent.
Arizona State, which defeated
Stanford 80-68 at Tempe Jan. 6,
is 4-5 in Pacific-10 Conference
action and 13-8 overall.
ASU starters
Seniors Tony Zeno and Bill
Kucharsky will probably be the
starting forwards for the Sun
Devils. Zeno, a strong player
inside, is averaging 12.5 points
and 9.4 rebounds a game.
Kurt Nimphius, a 6-10 junior,
had been the starting center
for ASU earlier this year, but he
has yielded the pivot spot to
6-11 sophomore Alton Lister.
Lister enjoyed a fine game
against Stanford, scoring 12
points and grabbing 11 re
bounds. He is now averaging
10.2 points and 7.8 boards per
outing.
Roy Joshua, a smooth
shooting San Jose native, oc
cupies one guard spot. The
other backcourt position be
longs to Blake Taylor, the Sun
Devils' leading scorer with a
12.9 per-game figure. Taylor's
talent can be explained by the
fact that his brother Bruce

played cornerback for several
years with the San Francisco
49ers while sibling Brian was a
starting guard in the NBA.
ASU coach Ned Wulk likes
what he sees when he gazes
down his bench, for it is
stocked with competent sub
stitutes such as Nimphius, 6-8
forward Sam Williams, 6-7 for
ward Johnny Nash and 6-2
guard Greg Goorjian.
The Cards hope they can
handle the ball better against
Arizona than they did the last
time they met. Benefitting
from Stanford's generous 17
first-half turnovers, the
Wildcats defeated the Cards
74-64 January 4.
Wildcats hot
The top scorer for 10-7
Arizona — and for the entire
Pac-10 — is 6-4 guard-forward
Joe Nehls. Nehls succeeded
Stanford's Wolfe Perry as the
conference's leading point
producer a couple of weeks
ago, and boasts a 19.6 average.
Against the Cards Nehls put
forth a particularly gutty effort,
scoring 20 points despite suf

fering a broken nose early in
the game.
Complementing Nehls sup
erbly is 5-10 guard Russell
Brown, the league's assist
leader with an 8.9 average.
Brown also is scoring 9.6 points
a game.
Dangerous Larry Demic
roams the middle for the
Wildcats. Sporting a 16.2 scor
ing average and an 11.0 re
bounding figure, the 6-9 Demic
ranks as one of the Pac-10's top
centers.
George Hawthorne and John
Belobraydic will probably start
at forward for the Wildcats,
though Robbie Dosty and
Donald Mellon should receive
substantial playing time in re
serve roles.
Among coach Fred "The
Fox" Snowden's top subs at
guard is John Smith, whose
free throw in the waning sec
onds made the difference in
Arizona's 70-69 shaving of
UCLA.
Defense is key
"We will have to shore up
ourdefenseand reboundingto
be successful," said Dißiaso in
anticipation of this weekend.
"Arizona State will give us
many matchup problems. They
have great quickness at the
guards, and good size and
depth on the front line.
"And Arizona comes in with
the conference's leading
scorer (Nehls)," Dißiaso went
on. "They also have the bal-
Ihandling wizardry of Brown
and inside strength up front."
The Cards will stick with
seniors Perry and Paul Giovac
chini in the backcourt. Perry

ranks second in Pac-10 scoring
with an 18.6 average, one point
behind Nehls. Giovacchini's
4.7 assist average places him
seventh in the league.
Freshman Orlando Ward will
likely get the nod at center;
though Jeff Ryan, who played
strongly in Oregon last
weekend, should get his licks
in. Tom Schmalzried is also a
good bet to play considerably;
indeed, Schmalzried started
both of the January games.
Brian Welch, averaging 12.7
points, mans one forward posi
tion, while Kimberly Belton oc
cupies the other.
Belton is having an outstand
ing year: 13.8 points per game,
9.0 rebounds and a .590 shoot
ing percentage (third-best in
the league). He needs just 10
more points to reacn the 1,000
plateau for his career.
Women play
Stanford's women also hit
the hardwood, as they face
formidable USC tonight at 5:45
p.m. and Fresno State tomor
row at the same time.
USC's attack is spearheaded
by 6-0 forward Kathy Ham
mond, 6-2 center Anna Maria
Lopez and 5-7 playmaker Thera
Smith.
However, coach Dottie
McCrea's 13-3 Cards have
firepower personified in
Jeanne Ruark (22.7 ppg., 8.9
rpg.) and Angie Paccione (12.8
PPB-)
That's four basketball games
in two nights at Maples. Even
Mitch Miller would have trou
ble following all those bounc
ing balls.
