# BATS beat ruggers, 15-10

### John Sargent 
The Bay Area Touring Side
(8.A.T.5.) have long been one
of the best rugby teams in the
nation. The last time Stanford
took the field against them was
in the tournament for the na
tional championship. The
game ended in a tie and the
B.A.T.S. won in a kick off.
Wednesday the B.A.T.S. came
to Stanford and once again
handed the Cardinals a bitter
defeat, (15-10).
The B.A.T.S. scored in the
early minutes of play, and
seemed to spend most of the
first half in the Stanford end.
Although the set scrum was
dominated by Stanford, the
swift backfield play of the op

ponents proved to be practi
cally unstoppable. The Cardi
nals remained tough near their
own goal line, however, and
the B.A.T.S. could only push
over one more score before
Stanford uncured a costly in
jury-
When Jimmy Dodd left the
field with a bloody nose, cut
eye, and sprained ankle, Stan
ford was forced to play a man
down until an already injured
Frank Hicks could put on a un
iform. During this interlude
the B.A.T.S. scored easily,
making the tally 12-oat the half.
The game continued in
much the same fashion, with
the B.A.T.S. scoring once more
on a drop kick (15-0) until only

ten minutes remained in the
game. In these final minutes
Stanford's offense exploded.
Young Jamie Turner scored in
the corner and kicked an al
most impossible conversion,
something the B.A.T.S. failed
to do all day.
After the ensuing kickoff,
Stanford controlled the play as
the B.A.T.S. began to look tired
and sluggish. With time close
to running out, Redmond
Burke burst into the end zone
making the score 15-10.
After the missed conversion
Stanford refused to let up and
moved the ball into the
B.A.T.S. territory. With only
seconds remaining, Stanford
once again gained an overlap.
A desperation tackle stopped
the Cardinals inside the one
yard line and time expired as
the ball bounced out of
bounds.
For intensity, one could not
have asked for a better game.
Stanford, facing a vastly more
experienced team, made it
close with hustle and determi
nation alone. The physical con
tact was brutal, yet many
players stayed in the game de
spite their injuries.
It will be a battered team that
faces the San Francisco Rugby
Club this Saturday at 1 p.m. but
if Wednesday was any indica
tion, that won't figure in the
outcome.
The Stanford li s also fell to
the B.A.T.S. by a score of 16-3.
Though the game wasn't as
close in score, the ll's played
most of the game in the
B.A.T.S. end. Both scrum and
backs played well, but they
were never quite able to put
the points they deserved on
the board.
