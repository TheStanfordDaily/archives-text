# Swimmers will splash against UCLA

### Dianne Cahoon 
Stanford swimmers, fresh from last weekend's bombardment
of the University of Pacific, will confront more potent adversaries
today and tomorrow.
World-renowned coach George Haines, former Santa Clara
mentor brings his explosive men's team to deCuerre this after
noon for dual meet action, scheduled to begin at 2 p.m.
The Bruins, pre-picked earlier this year by Swimming World
magazine as third-place NCAA finishers, should be picked as
definite favorites, according to Stanford coach )im Caughran.
"Their times in almost every event are faster than our best shaved
times," he explained.
Nonetheless, Caughran added that he "expects good match
ups" throughout the competition, which "should be exciting
from the spectators' point of view."
UCLA recently accosted the University of' Tennessee, NCAA
victors last season and presaged to retain that title this March.
"From the 200 freestyle on up and possibly the 200 individual
medley, they have a very strong team," Caughran said of today's
opponents.
Olympic champion Brian Coodell leads this array of talent
when he hits the water in possession of the 1000 yard freestyle
American record. Coodell also owns the top 200 and 500 freestyle
times yet recorded this season.
He is joined by breaststroker Matt Rye, whom Caughran de
noted as one of the only competitors to shave down for this meet.
Chris Woo, who stroked to eighth place in the 100 meter
breaststroke at the Montreal Olympics, will give the Cards' Ken
Shilling formidable opposition as well.
Caughran emphasized that his team has not rested or shaved in
preparation for today's events, but "they (UCLA) have not neces
sarily either." Most Pac-10 swimmers are heading for the NCAA
Championships at Cleveland in late March and will, therefore,
not begin to taper until later.
All the same, Gaughran said that he anticipates fast swims and
will alter the format of several events in hopes of record attain

ments and further challenges. The 800 free relay will oust the
usual 400 free relay to provide Stanford with a chance to match
the NCAA qualifying standard. The 100 yard breaststroker,
backstroke and butterfly events will replace the 400 medley relay.
Gaughran concluded that "we are ready to «-wim well. We are
not predicting an upset. We are just looking for good times."
Tomorrow's competition against Texas A&M will not offer the
same impetus to improvement as the Bruins but will be another
chance for the Cards to swim off-events.
The women, still minus a recuperating Kim Peyton, will dive
into a low-pressure tri-meet with the Aggies and the Oregon
Ducks tomorrow.
The gun will then sound for both the men and women at 1 p.m.
