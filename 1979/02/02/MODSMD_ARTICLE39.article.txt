# Gymnasts tumble at Davis
## 
### Dean Eyre 
About 20 people from The
Farm will take a bus to meet
their counterparts at UC Davis,
but the only livestock involved
in tonight's match-up with the
Aggies will be the horses used
in vaulting and of course the
pommel horse. A rodeo or
gymkhana it's not, but rather a
gymnastics meet in which Stan
ford's men hope to keep a
winning streak alive and the
women hope to start one.
Both Cardinal coaches are
optimistic about the 7 p.m.
meet, although they again
point out that the outcome
could be close.
Predicting the comparison of
the women gymnasts, Stanford
head coach Jackie Walker said,
"Davis scored 115.35 on the
26th (of January) while beating
San Francisco State, so that's
even more proof that we have a
chance to beat them — it will
be a close meet. Also, I'm glad
to get out of this area again to
compare judges' scores from a
different area of California."
A serious problem so far in
the young season for Walker's
team has been injuries; cauti
ous routines in competition
and careful workouts have
minimized this problem for to
night's performance.

"Gradually the kids are get
ting healthy, so hopefully we
can beat Davis," Walker said.
"I'm pretty confident that we
can. They scored 118 this sea
son (compared to Stanford's
season-high of 116.65) but I
think that's a minor difference
in the judging scale — if they
(the judges) start up a little
higher, then the whole teams'
scores are going to be raised,"
she explained.
Uneven parallel bars con
tinue to be the weak point for
the women, while in the other
events, particularly vaulting,
the Cards are highly competi
tive.
"On bars we're still a little
weak with regard to falls and
mistakes, so I'm looking for
ward every week to improve
ment," said Walker.
"If we lose the meet it will be
due to bars. This week we
don't have that room for falls
and breaks or we may lose a
meet that we shouldn't have,"
she added.
Men's head coach Sadao
Hamada described the Aggies
squad as "not too strong, an up
and coming, young team with a
lack of consistency." Even
though he felt the meet would
be pretty close, Hamada said
he is not one to dwell on the

opposition. *
"It depends on the nature of
the competition," Hamada
said.
"If it were boxing, judo,
aikido or whatever, you have to
know your opponent better
because he may have
rent style. But in gymnastics,
they don't compete against
others, they compete against
themselves. Some coaches
want to know all the players on
the opposing team, but I'm not
too concerned about them,"
he added.
Although the men weren't as
hampered by injuries as the
women, a few team members
were held back from their
normal level of performance.
Regarding injuries and the
Davis meet, Hamada said there
wasn't anything major.
"Chris (Takimoto) is getting
back in pretty good shape,
doing better routines and look
ing more consistent now," he
said. "No one really l as any
major injuries. Maybe they
have to go easy in practice for a
few days."
Brian Nelson, forced out of
last week's meet with pulled
muscles in his back is the only
exception and will be unable to
compete tonight.

Aggies will be the horses used
in vaulting and of course the
pommel horse. A rodeo or
gymkhana it's not, but rather a
gymnastics meet in which Stan
ford's men hope to keep a
winning streak alive and the
women hope to start one.
Both Cardinal coaches are
optimistic about the 7 p.m.
meet, although they again
point out that the outcome
could be close.
Predicting the comparison of
the women gymnasts, Stanford
head coach Jackie Walker said,
"Davis scored 115.35 on the
26th (of January) while beating
San Francisco State, so that's
even more proof that we have a
chance to beat them — it will
be a close meet. Also, I'm glad
to get out of this area again to
compare judges' scores from a
different area of California."
A serious problem so far in
the young season for Walker's
team has been injuries; cauti
ous routines in competition
and careful workouts have
minimized this problem for to
night's performance.

"Gradually the kids are get
ting healthy, so hopefully we
can beat Davis," Walker said.
"I'm pretty confident that we
can. They scored 118 this sea
son (compared to Stanford's
season-high of 116.65) but I
think that's a minor difference
in the judging scale — if they
(the judges) start up a little
higher, then the whole teams'
scores are going to be raised,"
she explained.
Uneven parallel bars con
tinue to be the weak point for
the women, while in the other
events, particularly vaulting,
the Cards are highly competi
tive.
"On bars we're still a little
weak with regard to falls and
mistakes, so I'm looking for
ward every week to improve
ment," said Walker.
"If we lose the meet it will be
due to bars. This week we
don't have that room for falls
and breaks or we may lose a
meet that we shouldn't have,"
she added.
Men's head coach Sadao
Hamada described the Aggies
squad as "not too strong, an up
and coming, young team with a
lack of consistency." Even
though he felt the meet would
be pretty close, Hamada said
he is not one to dwell on the

opposition. *
"It depends on the nature of
the competition," Hamada
said.
"If it were boxing, judo,
aikido or whatever, you have to
know your opponent better
because he may have
rent style. But in gymnastics,
they don't compete against
others, they compete against
themselves. Some coaches
want to know all the players on
the opposing team, but I'm not
too concerned about them,"
he added.
Although the men weren't as
hampered by injuries as the
women, a few team members
were held back from their
normal level of performance.
Regarding injuries and the
Davis meet, Hamada said there
wasn't anything major.
"Chris (Takimoto) is getting
back in pretty good shape,
doing better routines and look
ing more consistent now," he
said. "No one really l as any
major injuries. Maybe they
have to go easy in practice for a
few days."
Brian Nelson, forced out of
last week's meet with pulled
muscles in his back is the only
exception and will be unable to
compete tonight.
