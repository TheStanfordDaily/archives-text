# Miller calls for more women, minorities

Despite large gains made in the last decade,
there are still not enough women and minority
students enrolled in the Graduate School of Busi
ness, GSB Dean Arjay Miller said yesterday.
Miller, who suddenly announced last Thursday
he will resign as dean on July 1, told KZSU's Cam
pus Conference, "I think more improvements are
necessary" in the Business School's -ecruitment
process.
During Miller's 10-year tenure as dean, the
number of women and minority masters of busi
ness administration (MBA) candidates has risen
substantially, with the number of black students
increasing from 5 to 26, Spanish surname students
from zero to 24, Asian Americans from four to 27
and women from 10 to 146.
"But I am not satisfied," Miller said. "We are
going to try to do a better job in the recruitment
process...l would like to see more (women and
minorities), and I think that in time we will have
more."
"It wasn't an easy decision" to resign, he said,
but because several other top Business School
faculty were either retiring or returning to teach
ing "it became clear that it would be easier to pick

the number one dean before picking the associate
deans" and ensure a cohesive administration.
"The things I wanted to do 10 years ago are
largely accomplished and it's time now for fresh
leadership and new ideas, and I mean that," he
continued.
Miller stressed that faculty "are the key in de
termining the direction of the school," and that he
doesn't think there will be any "revolutionary
change" at the GSB in the wake of his departure.
Looking back over his 10 years as dean, Miller
cited the public management program he created
as his proudest achievement.
"If there is any single thing I'm proud of and
think will have long-run significance, it's in the
establishment of the public management prog
ram," he said.
The publication of Ralph Nader's book Unsafe at
Any Speed in 1966, a highly critical account of the
automotive industry, ultimately demonstrated the
need for such training, Miller said. Because of the
charges made in the book, Miller, then president
of Ford Motor Co., and the presidents of three
other automotive companies were called to

Washington, D.C. to testify before a Senate com
mittee.
"We didn't do well at all," he recalled. "We just
didn't know how to respond to these new ques
tions;we didn't understand the political process."
This experience prompted Miller to recognize
the need for new programs for business execu
tives "so that future business people would be
trained in a way that I was not trained, understand
ing the political process, and learning how to cope
with the demands being made for minority hiring,
women in management, environmental relation
ships, consumerism and the whole set of new
problems business was confronted with in the late
'605."
Thus one of the conditions he set that was fulfil
led when he accepted the post ot dean here in 1969
was the authority to broaden the curriculum to
include a new pubic management program, he
said.
"The thing that makes me really happy is that
other schools are copying the public management
(program) now," he said. "The prestige that the
Business School has received is in part due to our
public management program."
