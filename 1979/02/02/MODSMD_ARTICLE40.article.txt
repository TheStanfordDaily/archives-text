# Fencers duel here
## 
### Jeff Powell 
Nothing athletic to do to
morrow orSunday besides lying
in the sack, contemplating
massive throbbing in the
cranium region? Why not ven
ture over to the intimate con
fines of Roble gym to check out
the Nor-Cal Conference Fenc
ing Championships, instead.
That's right, fencing. Satur
day and Sunday morning and
afternoon the Stanford squad,
along with four other area
schools, will battle it out to de
termine both the conference
team champions and indi
vidual champions. San Jose
State, UC-Santa Cruz, Berkeley
and Sacramento State round
out the field. Although seven
teams were eligible, only these
five managed to qualify.
Team competition, accord
ing to coach )ean Helliwell, is
scheduled for Saturday while
individual play is slated for
Sunday. Starting time both
days is 9 a.m. Championship
matt hes in each bracket, team
and individual, are scheduled
for 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
The tourney is split into four
divisions â€” women's foil,
men's foil, men's epee and
men's saber. Winners are to be
determined by round-robin

play in each weapon, and the
Cardinal fencers, holding an
8-4 record overall, are entered
in all but one. The lone missing
category is that of the saber
competition.
Top hopefuls for Stanford
are John Burgess and Ted Bar
tell for the men. The women
place their aspirations on Amy
Fiske, Stephanie Knott, Beth
Turner and Donna Helliwell,
daughter of the coach.
Senior Burgess, proud pos
sessor of the best won-lost re
cord on the squad, qualified
first in the men's foil division.
In addition, Bartell,
another senior, was the second
qualifier in the epee competi
tion. Vet he has his work cut
out for him as the first qualifier,
San lose State's Peter Schifrin,
placed third in the Nationals
last year.
Berkeley led all preliminary
qualifiers and should thus be
considered the pre
tournament favorite. How
ever, San lose State, three-time
defending national champion
in the women's foil, will also
pose serious threats. Tough *
competition this weekend
truly spells "en guarde" for the
Card fencers.
