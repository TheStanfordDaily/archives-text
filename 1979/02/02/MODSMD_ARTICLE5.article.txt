### Kevin Cox 
It was a question of sweaters and
steel instead of guns and butter last
night during a New Directions sym
posium on multilateral trade negotia
tions in Skilling Auditorium.
Rep. Charles Vanik (D-Ohio), be
lieves that a "trigger-price" duty
should be imposed on imported
steel during the next few years so
that relatively more expensive U.S.
steel can be competitive with the
foreign product.
But while allowing that the gar
ment industry also can't compete
with foreign manufacturers and their
lower-priced clothing imports, Vanik
said that the approval by Congress of
the outcome of current Geneva mul
tilateral trade negotiations depends
on whether "overall, it's a good or
bad thing."
"Some people will be hurt by the
agreement," Vanik said.

The Geneva negotiations are the
seventh in a series of meetings of
world powers that have taken place
since World War 11. The U.S., the
European Economic Community,
japan and larger Third World nations
are involved in the current confer
ence, which is intended to liberalize
world trade restrictions and reduce
tariffs.
Mat tie Jackson, International
Vice President of the International
Ladies' Garment Workers Union,
disagreed with Vanik.
"The existing bilateral trade ag
reements on textiles and apparel are
unduly liberal," said jackson. "We
are in trouble where unemployment
is concerned."
While Vanik admitted that "the
garment industry, more than any
other industry, has suffered from in
trusion from foreign products," he
said that 7000 to 10,000 steel workers
who lost their jobs a few years ago
were "absorbed" into other
employment.
"It wasn't as bad as we thought,"
Vanik said.
Jackson said that one-third of the
unemployed garment workers
hadn't received benefits guaranteed
to them by the federal Adjustment
Assistance Act.
Vanik blamed the problem on
"bureaucrats" and faulty administra
tion of the program, butalso said that
Congress "can't get a commitment
from President (Jimmy) Carter as to
how much money to set aside for the
program."
Robert Gomperts, a former presi
dent of the California Council on In
ternational Trade, said that he was
"pessimistic about temporary (tariff)
supports for industry," but agreed
with Vanik when the congressman
said that the U.S. was "dependent"
on steel production because of
"strategic needs."
Gomperts, who is currently in
volved in exporting agricultural
commodities, was not as optimistic
as Vanik about Congress' ability to
please various industries when it re
views and approves the upcoming
Geneva trade agreement.
"Congress will have to balance out
the national interest and the interests
of their districts (or constituency),"
he said.
