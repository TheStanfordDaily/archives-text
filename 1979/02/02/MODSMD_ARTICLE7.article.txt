Last Monday, when students here
were riding home from their 2:15
p.m. classes, first-year law student
Steve Miller was trapped, clutching a
lone tree on the side of Hawaii's
Diamond Head, 1000 feet off the
ground. By the time students here sat
down to dinner, Miller had been
«-.* ed, after a two-hour ordeal was
ended by professional safety rescur
ers in helicopters.
Like many ambitious people, Mil
ler stared at the inactive Oahu vol
cano, and determined to reach its
apex Monday afternoon.
Miller ascended the approximately
1000-foot mountain in less than an
hour. Paths with gradual inclines
lead to the top.
"It's illegal to climb up it, but
people do it all the time," Miller said.

After surveying then( ene trom the
mountain's crest, Miller began to de
scend. But after climbing down
about one-quarter of the way, Miller
slipped and slid another 20 teetdown
the mountainside < oming to a stop
near a tree.
"I reached a point where I couldn't
go up and I couldn't go down. It was
just a vertical drop," Miller recalled.
"Hey, you know, I was wearing a
pair of Stanford shorts and sneakers,
your standard mountain-climbing
material; somehow I didn't want to
try to get down.
"So I started waving frantically. A
guy from the highway below waved
back. I waved torahout 15 minutes,"
Miller said.
