# Colin Higgins discusses his career
## Producer of Harold and Maude was freshman star of Gaieties 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
His name is recognized by
few, but his works Harold and
Maude, Silver Streak, and Foul
Play, are world-famous. He is
Colin Higgins, 37, a screenwri
ter and director and a graduate
of both the University of Califor
nia Los Angeles film school
and Stanford. Born on the
French isle of New Caledonia
to an American father and an
Australian mother, Higgins was

raised in both California and
Australia before coming here
in 1959.
Daily: What did you do at
Stanford that influenced your
career?
Higgins: I tried out for
Gaieties my freshman year and
surprisingly, I got the lead. I
played Chappie, the jester
mascot of Chapparal, who was
sort of an emcee for the whole
production. It turned out to be

funny, which was pleasing
since I had done my own writ
ing. Being the freshman star in
the Gaieties was intoxicating. It
was my first heady taste of mak
ing people laugh.
So initially you wanted to be
an actor?
Higgins. I liked both writing
and acting. During my
freshman year my grades were
so bad I was put on academic
probation and then I lost my

scholarship after my freshman
year. So the next year I hitch
hiked to New York and studied
acting at Actor's Studio. About
the only thing I did there was
carry a spear in a mime produc
tion of Macbeth. The spearwas
imaginary. I also worked at Ma
cy's, as an usher in a theatre,
and passed out free tickets on
Broadway for the johnny Car
son show while working as a
page at ABC-TV. After those
nine months in New York, I de
cided to go back to Stanford
and I think I lasted two quarters
of my sophomore year before I
volunteered for the Ar
my.
What did you do in the Army?
Higgins: First I went to Geor
gia and reported on )ames
Meredith's first days at college.
I was a journalist for the Stars
and Stripes for a while before
going to Germany for two years
to cover sports for the Bth Divi
sion Arrow. When I was dis
charged from the Army, I went
to Paris to the Sorbonne for six
months and learned French.
Then after hitchhiking through
England and Italy, I came back
to Stanford in the fall.
How did your stopping out
affect what you wanted to do?
Higgins: I found Stanford
much more interesting after I
had returned. I didn't have that
feeling that there were courses
that I had to take. When I was a
freshman, I was interested in
theatre and having a good
time. But, after I had traveled
and worked for a while I was
anxious to study for the sake of
studying. I took courses for
what they were, not so that I
could sleep in. I took a course
on Chaucer, for example, be
cause I had hitchhiked from
London to Canterbury.
I majored in creative writing
under Wallace Stegner and
when I graduated in 1967, I got
an award for the best critical
paper for something I had
done on Chaucer, and I also
got some other award for a
short story I'd written.
Were you still acting and writ
ing for the theatre during your
later years at Stanford?
Higgins: I got into a play in

San Francisco and joined Ac
tor's Equity, the actor's union. I
also helped earn my tuition by
working nights with the Com
edia Repertory Company in
Palo Alto. In 1966 a profes
sional repertory company
came to Stanford to help stu
dents put on plays. I tried out
for Anthony & Cleopatra and
when I got the part I told them I
was in Equity and they had to
pay me! I started to write a stu
dent show called Once Around
the Quad and after I left I be
lieve it was finished and pro
duced by Ram's Head.
Can you say what was most
beneficial to you at Stanford?
Higgins: The creative writing
department was always very
prestigious at Stanford. I'd
write a short story and it would
be criticized by other students.
By making you do it over and
over, the professors allowed
you to grow.
When did you decide you
wanted to be a filmmaker?
Higgins: After graduating
from Stanford I signed on as an
able-bodied seaman because I
wanted to see the Orient. It
didn't take me long to realize
that the days of Conrad and
Eugene O'Neill were over.
There was no work and too
many people to do it. When I
returned from the Orient, I
went to Expo '67 in Montreal
which was largely an exhibition
of multifarious (diverse) types
of film. I remember it as being
literally whole buildings full of
film and projectors.
So now that I had my degree
as — to use that immortal
phrase — "something to fall
back on," I decided to go to
UCLA to use my acting and
theatre talents to learn about
films. There I wrote
screenplays like I had written
short stories at Stanford. They
were read and criticized by
other students. For my thesis I
wrote a feature-length film,
Harold and Maude, which I
sold to producer Bob Evans.
And the rest is history?
Higgins: And the rest is his
tory.
Where did the inspiration for
your big successes come from?

Higgins: All screenwriters
draw on autobiographical
material to some extent. In my
case Harold and Maude was an
autobiographical introvert try
ing to be an extrovert. I wrote
Silver Streak because I had al
ways wanted to get on a train
and meet .ome blonde. It
never happened, so I wrote a
script.
The idea behind Foul Play
was to take an innocent and
see what happened to her in a
crazy situation.
Which film is the most suc
cessful?
Higgins: Harold and Maude
is the most well-respected and
loved. People go and see it
numerous times. But in terms
of the industry it was a failure,
whereas Silver Sreak and Foul
Play were huge successes.
What are you working on
now?
Higgins: I'm writing another
comedy-thrillercalled The Man
Who Lost Tuesday.
Who were your mentors?
Higgins: Hitchcock, of
course, who wrote the book on
the grammar of film. There was
also H.twkes, and Renoir, the

painter's son who made a great
movie called The Grand Illu
sion. That was part of the
beauty of UCLA; you could see
all thpse older films.
Hal Ashby, who directed
Harold and Maude was a big
influence. So was Peter Brook,
director ot an internatonal
theatre group I wrote for in
Paris after I got out of UCLA.
Most college students are
anxious about their future.
Were you and are you still?
Higgins: I was very anxious
since I had no real idea of what
I wanted. People would ask me
what I wanted to do and I'd say
I wanted to be an actor or a
writer. Then they'd say, "Yes,
but what are you going to do?"
Alter I got my English degree I
had a very anxious time won
dering what the hell to do until
I went to Expo '67 and decided I
wanted to be a filmmaker.
Now I worry that endings
should be better, but the es
sential problem of what to do
with my life is solved. I'm in
terested in other things like ar
cheology and would like to go
on a dig. I guess my philosophy
is hang-loose.

freshman year my grades were
so bad I was put on academic
probation and then I lost my

scholarship after my freshman
year. So the next year I hitch
hiked to New York and studied
acting at Actor's Studio. About
the only thing I did there was
carry a spear in a mime produc
tion of Macbeth. The spearwas
imaginary. I also worked at Ma
cy's, as an usher in a theatre,
and passed out free tickets on
Broadway for the johnny Car
son show while working as a
page at ABC-TV. After those
nine months in New York, I de
cided to go back to Stanford
and I think I lasted two quarters
of my sophomore year before I
volunteered for the Ar
my.
What did you do in the Army?
Higgins: First I went to Geor
gia and reported on )ames
Meredith's first days at college.
I was a journalist for the Stars
and Stripes for a while before
going to Germany for two years
to cover sports for the Bth Divi
sion Arrow. When I was dis
charged from the Army, I went
to Paris to the Sorbonne for six
months and learned French.
Then after hitchhiking through
England and Italy, I came back
to Stanford in the fall.
How did your stopping out
affect what you wanted to do?
Higgins: I found Stanford
much more interesting after I
had returned. I didn't have that
feeling that there were courses
that I had to take. When I was a
freshman, I was interested in
theatre and having a good
time. But, after I had traveled
and worked for a while I was
anxious to study for the sake of
studying. I took courses for
what they were, not so that I
could sleep in. I took a course
on Chaucer, for example, be
cause I had hitchhiked from
London to Canterbury.
I majored in creative writing
under Wallace Stegner and
when I graduated in 1967, I got
an award for the best critical
paper for something I had
done on Chaucer, and I also
got some other award for a
short story I'd written.
Were you still acting and writ
ing for the theatre during your
later years at Stanford?
Higgins: I got into a play in

San Francisco and joined Ac
tor's Equity, the actor's union. I
also helped earn my tuition by
working nights with the Com
edia Repertory Company in
Palo Alto. In 1966 a profes
sional repertory company
came to Stanford to help stu
dents put on plays. I tried out
for Anthony & Cleopatra and
when I got the part I told them I
was in Equity and they had to
pay me! I started to write a stu
dent show called Once Around
the Quad and after I left I be
lieve it was finished and pro
duced by Ram's Head.
Can you say what was most
beneficial to you at Stanford?
Higgins: The creative writing
department was always very
prestigious at Stanford. I'd
write a short story and it would
be criticized by other students.
By making you do it over and
over, the professors allowed
you to grow.
When did you decide you
wanted to be a filmmaker?
Higgins: After graduating
from Stanford I signed on as an
able-bodied seaman because I
wanted to see the Orient. It
didn't take me long to realize
that the days of Conrad and
Eugene O'Neill were over.
There was no work and too
many people to do it. When I
returned from the Orient, I
went to Expo '67 in Montreal
which was largely an exhibition
of multifarious (diverse) types
of film. I remember it as being
literally whole buildings full of
film and projectors.
So now that I had my degree
as — to use that immortal
phrase — "something to fall
back on," I decided to go to
UCLA to use my acting and
theatre talents to learn about
films. There I wrote
screenplays like I had written
short stories at Stanford. They
were read and criticized by
other students. For my thesis I
wrote a feature-length film,
Harold and Maude, which I
sold to producer Bob Evans.
And the rest is history?
Higgins: And the rest is his
tory.
Where did the inspiration for
your big successes come from?

Higgins: All screenwriters
draw on autobiographical
material to some extent. In my
case Harold and Maude was an
autobiographical introvert try
ing to be an extrovert. I wrote
Silver Streak because I had al
ways wanted to get on a train
and meet .ome blonde. It
never happened, so I wrote a
script.
The idea behind Foul Play
was to take an innocent and
see what happened to her in a
crazy situation.
Which film is the most suc
cessful?
Higgins: Harold and Maude
is the most well-respected and
loved. People go and see it
numerous times. But in terms
of the industry it was a failure,
whereas Silver Sreak and Foul
Play were huge successes.
What are you working on
now?
Higgins: I'm writing another
comedy-thrillercalled The Man
Who Lost Tuesday.
Who were your mentors?
Higgins: Hitchcock, of
course, who wrote the book on
the grammar of film. There was
also H.twkes, and Renoir, the

painter's son who made a great
movie called The Grand Illu
sion. That was part of the
beauty of UCLA; you could see
all thpse older films.
Hal Ashby, who directed
Harold and Maude was a big
influence. So was Peter Brook,
director ot an internatonal
theatre group I wrote for in
Paris after I got out of UCLA.
Most college students are
anxious about their future.
Were you and are you still?
Higgins: I was very anxious
since I had no real idea of what
I wanted. People would ask me
what I wanted to do and I'd say
I wanted to be an actor or a
writer. Then they'd say, "Yes,
but what are you going to do?"
Alter I got my English degree I
had a very anxious time won
dering what the hell to do until
I went to Expo '67 and decided I
wanted to be a filmmaker.
Now I worry that endings
should be better, but the es
sential problem of what to do
with my life is solved. I'm in
terested in other things like ar
cheology and would like to go
on a dig. I guess my philosophy
is hang-loose.


Colin Higgins
His name is recognized by
few, but his works Harold and
Maude, Silver Streak, and Foul
Play, are world-famous. He is
Colin Higgins, 37, a screenwri
ter and director and a graduate
of both the University of Califor
nia Los Angeles film school
and Stanford. Born on the
French isle of New Caledonia
to an American father and an
Australian mother, Higgins was

raised in both California and
Australia before coming here
in 1959.
Daily: What did you do at
Stanford that influenced your
career?
Higgins: I tried out for
Gaieties my freshman year and
surprisingly, I got the lead. I
played Chappie, the jester
mascot of Chapparal, who was
sort of an emcee for the whole
production. It turned out to be

funny, which was pleasing
since I had done my own writ

the Gaieties was intoxicating. It
was my first heady taste of mak

England and Italy, I came back
to Stanford in the fall.
How did your stopping out
affect what you wanted to do?
Higgins: I found Stanford
much more interesting after I
had returned. I didn't have that
feeling that there were courses
that I had to take. When I was a
freshman, I was interested in
theatre and having a good
time. But, after I had traveled
and worked for a while I was
anxious to study for the sake of
studying. I took courses for
what they were, not so that I
could sleep in. I took a course
on Chaucer, for example, be
cause I had hitchhiked from
London to Canterbury.
I majored in creative writing
under Wallace Stegner and
when I graduated in 1967, I got
an award for the best critical
paper for something I had
done on Chaucer, and I also
got some other award for a
short story I'd written.
Were you still acting and writ
ing for the theatre during your
later years at Stanford?
Higgins: I got into a play in

San Francisco and joined Ac
tor's Equity, the actor's union. I
also helped earn my tuition by
working nights with the Com
edia Repertory Company in
Palo Alto. In 1966 a profes
sional repertory company
came to Stanford to help stu
dents put on plays. I tried out
for Anthony & Cleopatra and
when I got the part I told them I
was in Equity and they had to
pay me! I started to write a stu
dent show called Once Around
the Quad and after I left I be
lieve it was finished and pro
duced by Ram's Head.
Can you say what was most
beneficial to you at Stanford?
Higgins: The creative writing
department was always very
prestigious at Stanford. I'd
write a short story and it would
be criticized by other students.
By making you do it over and
over, the professors allowed
you to grow.
When did you decide you
wanted to be a filmmaker?
Higgins: After graduating
from Stanford I signed on as an
able-bodied seaman because I
wanted to see the Orient. It
didn't take me long to realize
that the days of Conrad and
Eugene O'Neill were over.
There was no work and too
many people to do it. When I
returned from the Orient, I
went to Expo '67 in Montreal
which was largely an exhibition
of multifarious (diverse) types
of film. I remember it as being
literally whole buildings full of
film and projectors.
So now that I had my degree
as — to use that immortal
phrase — "something to fall
back on," I decided to go to
UCLA to use my acting and
theatre talents to learn about
films. There I wrote
screenplays like I had written
short stories at Stanford. They
were read and criticized by
other students. For my thesis I
wrote a feature-length film,
Harold and Maude, which I
sold to producer Bob Evans.
And the rest is history?
Higgins: And the rest is his
tory.
Where did the inspiration for
your big successes come from?

Higgins: All screenwriters
draw on autobiographical
material to some extent. In my
case Harold and Maude was an
autobiographical introvert try
ing to be an extrovert. I wrote
Silver Streak because I had al
ways wanted to get on a train
and meet .ome blonde. It
never happened, so I wrote a
script.
The idea behind Foul Play
was to take an innocent and
see what happened to her in a
crazy situation.
Which film is the most suc
cessful?
Higgins: Harold and Maude
is the most well-respected and
loved. People go and see it
numerous times. But in terms
of the industry it was a failure,
whereas Silver Sreak and Foul
Play were huge successes.
What are you working on
now?
Higgins: I'm writing another
comedy-thrillercalled The Man
Who Lost Tuesday.
Who were your mentors?
Higgins: Hitchcock, of
course, who wrote the book on
the grammar of film. There was
also H.twkes, and Renoir, the

painter's son who made a great
movie called The Grand Illu
sion. That was part of the
beauty of UCLA; you could see
all thpse older films.
Hal Ashby, who directed
Harold and Maude was a big
influence. So was Peter Brook,
director ot an internatonal
theatre group I wrote for in
Paris after I got out of UCLA.
Most college students are
anxious about their future.
Were you and are you still?
Higgins: I was very anxious
since I had no real idea of what
I wanted. People would ask me
what I wanted to do and I'd say
I wanted to be an actor or a
writer. Then they'd say, "Yes,
but what are you going to do?"
Alter I got my English degree I
had a very anxious time won
dering what the hell to do until
I went to Expo '67 and decided I
wanted to be a filmmaker.
Now I worry that endings
should be better, but the es
sential problem of what to do
with my life is solved. I'm in
terested in other things like ar
cheology and would like to go
on a dig. I guess my philosophy
is hang-loose.
