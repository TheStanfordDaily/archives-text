Dear Bug Me:
Recently I noticed a small sign in the Encina
weight room warning not to kick the pipes under
the benches. The sign said the insulation (which
was flaking off) was asbestos, a suspected car
cinogen. What is the University doing about
this?
-A.S.
"Nothing is being done right now," said Bob
Young, associate director of the Athletic De
partment. "This is the first time I've heard about
it."
Young said no laws prevent the use of asbes
tos as insulation if it was installed before the
present laws went into effect, although codes
do limit the number of fibers floating in the air.
Anthony Sidlow, manager of health and
safety, said he was also unaware of the problem,
but added he will "check it out."

Dear Bug Me:
Many local merchants will accept a Stanford
I.D. in lieu of a driver's license and two other
I.D.s. The Stanford Post Office won't. Why?
-A.K.
A Stanford I.D. will get you your letters and
packages, but it can't be used on checks since
it's no guarantee of good credit, said Ron Sod
link, Post Office manager. He said the demand
for at least one major credit card when you pay
by check is a national, not a local policy.

Dear Bug Me:
An early graduate of the University told me
there was once a graveyard for Sen. ieland Stan
ford's racehorses. Does any graveyard or re
mnant of it still exist?
-V.M.
A bronze statue was placed near the present

riding stables in 1926 as a "monument to the
departed horses," according to Peggy Coesfeld,
library specialist at the University achives. The
"departed horses" are buried beneath it and
their names are inscribed on the pedestal.
Dear Bug Me:
The lune 7977 Stanford Observer had ar; arti
cle touting a program called Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities (URO). Does it still exist?
-R.S.
"Indeed it does," said Laura Selznick, director
of the program, which operates from Room
590 A of Old Union. URO connects professors
who want research assistants with interested
students. A bulletin board there specifies the
nature of the work, qualifications needed and
credit or compensation for each project.
Dear Bug Me:
As a department secretary on the Inner Quad I
get a lot of requests from visitors and students
asking for the location of the nearest pay phone.
Safety and security are two important reasons
why there should be outdoor phones some
where in the Inner Quad. Why aren't there any?
-E.H.
There is a pay phone located to the left of the
Memorial Arch, according to Phil Rector
of building maintenance operations. Rector
said he intends to try to get lighting to make it
visible at night. Marv Herrington, chief of the
Department of Public Safety, advises people in
trouble to pull one of the fire boxes, equipped
with red lights for easy view. There are nine on
the Quad perimeter and two within the Quad.
