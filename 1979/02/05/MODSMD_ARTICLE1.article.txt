# Bakhtiar says he will allow shadow gov't

Tehran, Iran (AP) — Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar said yesterday he
would not oppose the creation of a
"shadow" government by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, but he warned
he was prepared to "answer Molotov
cocktails with Molotov cocktails" if
his foes resort to force.
Opposition sources said they ex
pect Khomeini, who returned to Iran
last Thursday after forcing Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from the
country, to designate the head of a
"provisional government" within a
week.
The problems facing Bakhtiar,
struggling to avoid a bloody show
down with Khomeini's forces, were
dramatized by troubles within his
own office. Some 400 civil servants
who work for the prime minister
went on strike to protest the army's
slaying of more than 30 people last
week in violent Tehran protests.
A spokesman for the strikers said
only Bakhtiar's chief of staff and per
sonal secretary remained on the job.
Shadow cabinet
In an interview with the Tehran
daily newspaper Ettelaat, Bakhtiar
likened a Khomeini-appointed gov
ernment to a European "shadow
cabinet named by opposition parties
waiting in the wings to take power.
"Many opposition political parties
in progressive, democratic countries
designate their own prime minister,"
Bakhtiar said. "But if this prime
minister-designate starts creating
disorders and riots and wants to in
terfere with the legal order of the
country, I will arrest him."
The prime minister told the As
sociated Press in a telephone inter
view: "I will keep the door open for
negotiations with Khomeini and a
peaceful solution."
Intensive negotiations are under
way between Bakhtiar's shah
appointed government and Kho
meini in an effort to steer the country
away from civil war.
Tux of war
Opposition sources described the
contacts to some extent as a "tug of
war" for the allegiance of the coun
try's 430,000-man armed forces, the
key factor in the political struggle.
"Bakhtiar is nothing now," one
opposition member said. "It's the
army, or the top command of the
army, and if we can convince them to
join the people, we will have a solu
tion."
Bakhtiar said he was "pleased with
the negotiations so far," but he did
not elaborate.
The chief mediator is believed to
be Mehdi Bazargan, 73, a retired oil
engineer and human-rights activist
who is a long-time friend of Bakhtiar.
He also acted as Khomeini's personal
envoy in negotiations with striking
oil workers.
There is speculation Bazargan may
be tapped by Khomeini as the prime
minister of the provisional govern
ment, which, if Bakhtiar steps aside,
would run the country until a re
ferendum is held on the establish
ment of the Islamic republic.
Informed sources said Bazargan
has met with Khomeini, Bakhtiar and
at least two senior military leaders
within the past few days. Khomeini
refuses to meet with Bakhtiar unless
he resigns as prime minister.
