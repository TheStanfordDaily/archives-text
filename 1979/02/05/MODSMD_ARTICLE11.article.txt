# Teachers may strike due to Prop. 13 cuts

Sacramento (AP) â€” California
teachers warned Thursday of a
"massive financial crisis" and
possible statewide strike due
to Proposition 13 cuts unless
the state gives local schools an
extra $400 million.
One leader of the 157,000-
member California Teachers
Association (CTA), which
sponsored rallies and news
conferences Thursday in 40
cities, warned ot a statewide
teachers strike if legislation in
creasing state funds is not ap
proved.
"At this time we are not dis
cussing negotiating the bill
downward. We are not ready
to negotiate. There has been
discussion of a statewide
strike" if the governor and
Legislature do not approve the
extra funds, CTA Vice Presi
dent Marilyn Bittle said at a
Sacramento news conference.
Bittle said the pay freeze im
posed after passage of Proposi-

tion 13 has created a teacher
shortage in southern Califor
nia, and that teachers must get
"at least a cost-of-living in
crease" this year to stop the
flow of teachers to other jobs
and prevent a strike in the fall.
"Teachers should not have
to subsidize education," she
said. "It we alert the public, it
they know what's happen
ing in the schools, they will
support us."
Gov. Jerry Brown has prop
osed increasing total state aid
to local schools from $7.4 bill
ion to $7.8 billion, a 5.4 percent
hike that is half the increase
sought by CTA.
lack Turner, president of the
California Higher Education
Association, said community
colleges, as well as grade
schools, face "a massive finan
cial crisis, with 7000 part-time
faculty already dismissed and
50 to 55 percent of adult educa
tion terminated."
