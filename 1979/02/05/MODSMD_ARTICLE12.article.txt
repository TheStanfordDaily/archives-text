## Draft not the answer 
### 
On Jan. 25, President Jimmy Carterasked
Congress for a $5 million budget increase
for the Selective Service System. According
to White House officials, this is only a first
step toward the resurrection of mandatory
draft registration, if not the draft itself. Cer
tainly it is the most ominous indicator yet
that the reactivation of registration for
men, and now women, is an issue that will
be taken up early in this session of
Congress.
As early as last October, Congressman
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) told stu
dents here of his intention to introduce
legislation that would create a "national
service plan." The plan would require all
18-year-olds to choose either one year of
military service or two years in civilian gov
ernment service.
In November, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
announced their recommendation that re
gistration be revived. Three separate
studies commissioned by Congress and re
leased jointly in December all supported
renewal of registration. And most recently,
Rep. Charles Bennett (D-Fla.) has an
nounced his intention to put legislation
reinstating registration before the new
Congress.
The last inductions of the Vietnam era
took place in 1972, but the draft itself was
never abolished; it was only suspended, or
put into "deep freeze" by executive order
of then-President Gerald Ford in 1975.
Most of the arguments for the reinstate
ment of registration have been based on
the generally acknowledged failure of the
volunteerarmy, which has relied heavily on
recruits from among the poor, the undere
ducated and minorities. Plagued by a high
desertion rate, the army does not contain
the broad spectrum of skills and education
deemed necessary for an effective fighting
force.
But there is another grim, little
mentioned reason for renewed calls for the
draft. Because of recent advances in non
nuclear technology — the development of
more effective ways to kill more people
more quickly — Pentagon casualty esti
mates for conventional warfare are now far
higher than ever before. Instead of requir
ing 100,000 soldiers in 150 days after mobili

zation, Pentagon plans now call for 100,000
inductees to be delivered in 60 days, and
650,000 within six months.
Because of these revised estimates, De
fense Secretary Harold Brown has said the
Selective Service System now is not capable
of mobilizing enough soldiers fast enough
in a military crisis. The Senate Armed
Forces Committee ruled this situation an
"unacceptable risk to national security."
Whether or not the draft will actually be
reinstated at this point is difficult to ascer
tain. But even the minimal act of reactivat
ing mandatory registration is wrong.
Wrong because the consensus on U.S.
foreign policy — the cornerstone of which
is military intervention, threatened or ac
tual — was destroyed by Vietnam. Foreign
intervention, which requires an effective
draft mechanism, is no longer a case of the
United States donning its white hat and rid
ing off to give the bad guys a sound thrash
ing. Washington insults every intelligent
person by expecting them to put his or her
life on the line in blind allegiance to what
the government chooses to define as a
"military crisis."
A chilling example of what we may expect
in the future came in a report which Brown
recently presented to the Senate Armed
Services Committee, who declared that any
Soviet military intervention in Iran "would
require a U.S. response."
Ironically, President Carter's request for
an additional $5 million — on top of $10
billion more earmarked for the Pentagon —
for the Selective Service is an act which can
only serve to exacerbate the inflation that
forces the poor, undereducated and
minorities into the volunteer army.
McCloskey's national service proposal
was an effort — however misguided — to
deal with this serious problem. Although
final judgment on his plan should be re
served until a bill is submitted to Congress,
McCloskey should be commended for at
tempting to address the problem in a con
crete way.
The poorand disadvantaged of this coun
try should not be forced through indirect
means to fight this nation's wars, any more
than its youth should be forced into un
thinking participation in military interven
tion overseas.

intervention, which requires an effective
draft mechanism, is no longer a case of the
United States donning its white hat and rid
ing off to give the bad guys a sound thrash
ing. Washington insults every intelligent
person by expecting them to put his or her
life on the line in blind allegiance to what
the government chooses to define as a
"military crisis."
A chilling example of what we may expect
in the future came in a report which Brown
recently presented to the Senate Armed
Services Committee, who declared that any
Soviet military intervention in Iran "would
require a U.S. response."
Ironically, President Carter's request for
an additional $5 million — on top of $10
billion more earmarked for the Pentagon —
for the Selective Service is an act which can
only serve to exacerbate the inflation that
forces the poor, undereducated and
minorities into the volunteer army.
McCloskey's national service proposal
was an effort — however misguided — to
deal with this serious problem. Although
final judgment on his plan should be re
served until a bill is submitted to Congress,
McCloskey should be commended for at
tempting to address the problem in a con
crete way.
The poorand disadvantaged of this coun

tion overseas.
On Jan. 25, President Jimmy Carterasked
Congress for a $5 million budget increase
for the Selective Service System. According
to White House officials, this is only a first
step toward the resurrection of mandatory
draft registration, if not the draft itself. Cer
tainly it is the most ominous indicator yet
that the reactivation of registration for
men, and now women, is an issue that will
be taken up early in this session of
Congress.
As early as last October, Congressman
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) told stu
dents here of his intention to introduce
legislation that would create a "national
service plan." The plan would require all
18-year-olds to choose either one year of
military service or two years in civilian gov
ernment service.
In November, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
announced their recommendation that re
gistration be revived. Three separate
studies commissioned by Congress and re
leased jointly in December all supported
renewal of registration. And most recently,
Rep. Charles Bennett (D-Fla.) has an
nounced his intention to put legislation
reinstating registration before the new
Congress.
The last inductions of the Vietnam era
took place in 1972, but the draft itself was
never abolished; it was only suspended, or
put into "deep freeze" by executive order
of then-President Gerald Ford in 1975.
Most of the arguments for the reinstate
ment of registration have been based on
the generally acknowledged failure of the
volunteerarmy, which has relied heavily on
recruits from among the poor, the undere
ducated and minorities. Plagued by a high
desertion rate, the army does not contain
the broad spectrum of skills and education
deemed necessary for an effective fighting
force.
But there is another grim, little
mentioned reason for renewed calls for the
draft. Because of recent advances in non
nuclear technology — the development of
more effective ways to kill more people
more quickly — Pentagon casualty esti
mates for conventional warfare are now far
higher than ever before. Instead of requir
ing 100,000 soldiers in 150 days after mobili

zation, Pentagon plans now call for 100,000
inductees to be delivered in 60 days, and
650,000 within six months.
Because of these revised estimates, De
fense Secretary Harold Brown has said the
Selective Service System now is not capable
of mobilizing enough soldiers fast enough
in a military crisis. The Senate Armed
Forces Committee ruled this situation an
"unacceptable risk to national security."
Whether or not the draft will actually be
reinstated at this point is difficult to ascer
tain. But even the minimal act of reactivat
ing mandatory registration is wrong.
Wrong because the consensus on U.S.
foreign policy — the cornerstone of which
is military intervention, threatened or ac
tual — was destroyed by Vietnam. Foreign
intervention, which requires an effective
draft mechanism, is no longer a case of the
United States donning its white hat and rid
ing off to give the bad guys a sound thrash
ing. Washington insults every intelligent
person by expecting them to put his or her
life on the line in blind allegiance to what
the government chooses to define as a
"military crisis."
