## Carter clan incomparable 
### 
While munching on food
service breakfast the other day,
I nearly choked when a nitwit
sitting on my right remarked:
"It's good to see the Carter
family make mistakes; it just
goes to show you that they are
just like any other American
family."
I don't know about you
folks, but a quick check of the
record makes me think other
wise.
1) In your families, do you
have anyone comparable to
Billy Carter, who urinates with
gusto on airport runways?
2) Do any of your families
have a Rosalynn Carter who
hob-nobs with the likes of
Chicago mass-murderer John
Gacy? Or a President Jimmy
who recently signed a docu
ment endorsing the mission of
Jim Jones?
It should be noted that the
Carters have disassociated
themselves from Jones and
Gacy, presumably because it
would be politically unpopular
to remain friends with them.
If anyone suggests that this
analysis is mere cynicism, con
sider the following. The Carter
administration is presently
supporting the Pol Pot regime
of Cambodia â€” a regimewhich
has slaughtered over two mill
ion people in the past five
years, making Jim Jones in
comparison come off as a
champion of human rights.
Jimmy does not hesitate to
back Pol Pot's murderous re
gime because the People's Re
public of China desires it. If
another world power said that
its support of U.S. policy
would depend partly on our
endorsement of Jim Jones,
Carter would gladly support
the hero of Guyana posthum
ously.
3) To continue our list of mis
fits in the Carter clan, how
about Ruth Carter Stapleton?
How many of you have a sister
whose close friend is crippled
porn-king Larry Flynt of Hustler
fame?
The Carters proudly proc
laim that they have converted
Flynt to Christianity. As evi
dence of his recent conver
sion, Larry's magazine con
tinues to salute the raised Phal
lis rather than the risen Christ
as the cornerstone of Christian
life in the modern world.
4) And then there's Amy.
Would you feel wanted if your
parents insisted that you have a
murderess for a baby-sitter?
5) How about Mama Lillian

who confesses that "Billy is the
brains of the family?" Since
Billy is quite openly a beer
guzzling neanderthal, one
must seriously question our
president's intelligence.
6) And then there is the Car
ters' dishonorable discharge,
Chip. A few years after being
kicked out of the Navy, Chip
has come close to the edge of
divorce. Things have settled
down, however, since his wife
apparently developed a toler
ance for her oddbird husband.
7) Finally, we must mention
the self-admitted "black sheep
of the family," William Carter
Spann, who is presently serv
ing a jail term for armed rob
bery at San Quentin.
Ironically, those of us who
care enough to demand higher
standards of conduct from our
"First Family" are denounced
by populists as "elitist." And
yet, there is an even higher
immorality in the Carter clan
that transcends the issue of
public conduct.
Georgia legislator Julian
Bond, long associated with
Carter, touched on this in a
1976 speech when he said that
jimmy Carter was the biggest
liar he had ever encountered.

At the other end of the political
spectrum from Bond, former
Georgia Governor Lester Mad
dox affirmed that Jimmy Carter
was indeed the biggest liar he
had ever met.
When Bond and Maddox
made their statements, they
were written off as the grumbl
ings of frustrated politicos.
Alas, the proof is in i!.e prover
bial pudding.
A look at the record indicates
to me that Carter has broken
practically every campaign
promise he made to the Ameri
can public in 1976. This is from
a Presidential candidate who
once solemnly declared "I will
never lie to you."
For those who still insist that
the Carters are just like any
other family, ! ask: How many
of you have a father who says
that he will never lie, but is
acknowledged to be a liar by
two colleagues plus anyone
else who looks at the record?
If this is the case with your
father, let me know; he'll make
a dandy Presidential candidate.
