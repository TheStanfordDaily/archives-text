## Open the gates to illegal aliens 
### 
The issue of illegal aliens is of growing
importance to California and the nation.
More than a year ago, the Carter administ
ration offered a plan which proposed am
nesty for illegal aliens long resident in this
country combined with firmer actions
against new entrants.
Proposed methods for dealing with il
legal aliens have included compulsory na
tional identity cards. Recently, Con
gressman Pete McCloskey suggested in
essence that the agricultural labor of il
legal aliens be replaced by the conscripted
slave labor of young Americans.
The issue therefore affects the liberties
of American citizens as well as the rights of
undocumented aliens.
Support for an exclusionary immigra
tion policy appears to rest on a vague feel
ing that the entire territory of the United
States is the collective birthright of those
who happen to be American citizens. Op
ponents of free immigration evidently be
lieve that, as a reward for having been
born in the right place, Cod has given the
American people collective ownership of
more than a third of the North American
continent.
This peculiar semifeudal, semisocialist
idea is wrong.
Particular buildings and pieces of land in
the United States are owned by various
individuals and private groups. Those
owners have a right to exclude from their
property whomever they wish.
But no one — neither the government
nor any mysterious collectivity, such as
"the nation," "society" or "the people" —
rightfully owns the United States as a
whole.
No one has a moral right to exclude per
sons from the entire territory of the United
States. If certain Americans choose to
offer food, a job or lodging to a foreigner
in the United States, the rest of us have no
right to interfere.
The moral argument for free immigra
tion is a compelling one for proponents of
human rights. Furthermore, practical ar
guments commonly presented against
free immigration do not hold up under
inspection.
For example, the fear that free immigra
tion will result in foreigners overrunning
America is unwarranted; it is easy to over
estimate the attraction which our country
exerts on persons living elsewhere.
Those people who wish to escape their

native lands are precisely those people
whose governments will not let them out.
In most countries which do allow free
emigration, few people possess either the
means or the will to emigrate to the United
States. Ties to one's native country and
culture are not easily or casually broken.
Those people who can easily afford the
costs of travelling to America are, in most
countries, those whose comfortable situa
tion at home provides a strong incentive to
stay.
It is worth remembering that prior to the
Immigration Act of 1965 there were no
numerical quotas on immigration into the
United States from nearly all nations in the
Western hemipshere. Vet the United
States was not inundated by a flood of
immigrants from other nations in the
Americas.
It is not true that resident foreigners
take jobs from Americans. The fallacy that

"The system of restricting
immigration to this
country was born nearly a
century ago of racist fears
of the 'yellow peril/ That
system must be ended."

there exists only a tixed number of jobs
has been repeatedly rejected by
economists.
Indeed, it is not even true that competit
ition from resident aliens would necessar
ily drive down American wages. Labor is
not a homogeneous commodity. Ameri
can workers possess training, skills and
experience (including long experience
with the English language) not possessed
by most foreigners.
New immigrants would largely com
plement rather than compete with Ameri
can labor, by providing agricultural labor
or domestic services which American citi
zens decline to provide.
Nor is ittruethat resident aliens placean
increased burden on American taxpayers.
Two 1976 studies (one by the Labor De
partment and one by the County of San
Diego) showed that government takes far

more in taxes from illegal aliens than it
gives.
The people most likely to make the ef
fort to emigrate to the United States are
young, industrious, intelligent, ambitious
people eager for greater opportunities. If
we open the gates to free immigration, a
natural process of selection will bring use
ful and productive persons to this country.
Lest it be thought that this would impose
a "brain drain" on the rest of the world, it
must be remembered that many aliens
would remit much of their earnings to
their native land. Furthermore, many
would eventually return home, taking with
them skills, experience and wealth that
can contribute to their home country's de
velopment.
While the development of the Third
World is ultimately dependent on social
revolutions that end the reign of
feudalism, socialism and kleptocracy
which currently oppresses most people on
the planet, America can indirectly contri
bute to the goal of world development by
allowing free immigration.
Perhaps the most compelling argument
against the restriction of immigration is
that it simply does not work. Despite cur
rent restrictions, there may be as many as
12 million undocumented aliens in this
country.
Short of employing the methods of a
totalitarian police state, the government
simply cannot halt the influx of illegal
aliens. Attempts to do so waste taxpayers'
money, threaten the liberties of American
citizens and impose on undocumented
aliens subhuman status founded in uncer
tainty and terror.
The system of restricting immigration
into this country was born nearly a century
ago of racist fears of the "yellow peril."
That system must be ended.
Laws restricting immigration of any per
son into the United States of America
should be repealed. The Border Patrol and
the Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice should be abolished.
People who take human rights seriously
and organizations concerned with Third
World peoples must unite toward these
ends.
It is time that we take seriously the famil
iar words engraved on the Statue of Lib
erty: ''Give me your tired, your poor. .

Indeed, it is not even true that competit
ition from resident aliens would necessar
ily drive down American wages. Labor is
not a homogeneous commodity. Ameri
can workers possess training, skills and
experience (including long experience
with the English language) not possessed
by most foreigners.
New immigrants would largely com
plement rather than compete with Ameri
can labor, by providing agricultural labor
or domestic services which American citi
zens decline to provide.
Nor is ittruethat resident aliens placean
increased burden on American taxpayers.
Two 1976 studies (one by the Labor De
partment and one by the County of San
Diego) showed that government takes far

more in taxes from illegal aliens than it
gives.
The people most likely to make the ef
fort to emigrate to the United States are
young, industrious, intelligent, ambitious
people eager for greater opportunities. If
we open the gates to free immigration, a
natural process of selection will bring use
ful and productive persons to this country.
Lest it be thought that this would impose
a "brain drain" on the rest of the world, it
must be remembered that many aliens
would remit much of their earnings to
their native land. Furthermore, many
would eventually return home, taking with
them skills, experience and wealth that
can contribute to their home country's de
velopment.
While the development of the Third
World is ultimately dependent on social
revolutions that end the reign of
feudalism, socialism and kleptocracy
which currently oppresses most people on
the planet, America can indirectly contri
bute to the goal of world development by
allowing free immigration.
Perhaps the most compelling argument
against the restriction of immigration is
that it simply does not work. Despite cur
rent restrictions, there may be as many as
12 million undocumented aliens in this
country.
Short of employing the methods of a
totalitarian police state, the government
simply cannot halt the influx of illegal
aliens. Attempts to do so waste taxpayers'
money, threaten the liberties of American
citizens and impose on undocumented
aliens subhuman status founded in uncer
tainty and terror.
The system of restricting immigration
into this country was born nearly a century
ago of racist fears of the "yellow peril."
That system must be ended.
Laws restricting immigration of any per
son into the United States of America
should be repealed. The Border Patrol and
the Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice should be abolished.
People who take human rights seriously
and organizations concerned with Third
World peoples must unite toward these
ends.

The issue of illegal aliens is of growing
importance to California and the nation.
More than a year ago, the Carter administ
ration offered a plan which proposed am
nesty for illegal aliens long resident in this
country combined with firmer actions
against new entrants.
Proposed methods for dealing with il
legal aliens have included compulsory na
tional identity cards. Recently, Con
gressman Pete McCloskey suggested in
essence that the agricultural labor of il
legal aliens be replaced by the conscripted
slave labor of young Americans.
The issue therefore affects the liberties
of American citizens as well as the rights of
undocumented aliens.
Support for an exclusionary immigra
tion policy appears to rest on a vague feel
ing that the entire territory of the United
States is the collective birthright of those
who happen to be American citizens. Op
ponents of free immigration evidently be
lieve that, as a reward for having been
born in the right place, Cod has given the
American people collective ownership of
more than a third of the North American
continent.
This peculiar semifeudal, semisocialist
idea is wrong.
Particular buildings and pieces of land in
the United States are owned by various
individuals and private groups. Those
owners have a right to exclude from their
property whomever they wish.
But no one — neither the government
nor any mysterious collectivity, such as
"the nation," "society" or "the people" —
rightfully owns the United States as a
whole.
No one has a moral right to exclude per
sons from the entire territory of the United
States. If certain Americans choose to
offer food, a job or lodging to a foreigner
in the United States, the rest of us have no
right to interfere.
The moral argument for free immigra
tion is a compelling one for proponents of
human rights. Furthermore, practical ar
guments commonly presented against
free immigration do not hold up under
inspection.
For example, the fear that free immigra
tion will result in foreigners overrunning
America is unwarranted; it is easy to over
estimate the attraction which our country
exerts on persons living elsewhere.
Those people who wish to escape their

native lands are precisely those people
whose governments will not let them out.
In most countries which do allow free
emigration, few people possess either the
means or the will to emigrate to the United
States. Ties to one's native country and
culture are not easily or casually broken.
Those people who can easily afford the
costs of travelling to America are, in most
countries, those whose comfortable situa
tion at home provides a strong incentive to
stay.
It is worth remembering that prior to the
Immigration Act of 1965 there were no
numerical quotas on immigration into the
United States from nearly all nations in the
Western hemipshere. Vet the United
States was not inundated by a flood of
immigrants from other nations in the
Americas.
It is not true that resident foreigners
take jobs from Americans. The fallacy that
