Not 'mindless
and callous'
Prof. Robert Packenham
calls me "mindless and call
ous" (Daily, )an. 23) for having
cited in my column defending
anti-shah protesters (Daily,
)an. 17), a remark that "some of
the things the shah has done
make Hitler seem like Mary
Poppins."
I am afraid Packenham's sen
sibilities were not quite
matched by his grasp of the
implications of that remark,
which was made by the U.S.
Consul in Tehran.
It clearly signifies that the
U.S. government was willingto
shore up a dictator whose ex
cesses are considered by its
own diplomatic representa
tives to exceed those of the
man who has come to
exemplify the greatest evil of
all history, Adolf Hitler.
I had quoted that remark
without comment, on the as
sumption that its meaning
need not be spelled out, espe
cially to a professor of political
science. But apparently my
lack of comment led Pac
kenham to conclude that I was
quoting it with "approval" and

he kindly instructs me in the
enormity of the evils Hitler has
committed.
I am obliged to him, but sus
pect that my knowledge of
them may be more intimate
than his. I was a refugee from
Hitler's Austria, with all that
that entailed in loss of home,
roots, property and upheaval
of existence.
A member of my immediate
family was murdered in a con
centration camp. I spent the
impressionable 14th year of my
life as a )ew in Hitler's Vienna
and have seared on my con
sciousness the memory of
enough human vileness to last
a lifetime.
It took me 26 years to over
come the loathing I felt for Au
strians and Germans who,
through approval or silent ac
quiescence, allowed Hitler to
happen.
But it's me Packenham
dumps on, in a perfect illustra
tion of my original letter. It is
the protester, not the cause of
the protest, that gets the heat.
Where is his roaring wrath
against the torturers of Iran?
Or those of Brazil, where Pac
kenham, a former Agency for
International Development
(AID) employee, spent a lot of

time and which has a "human
rights" record to match Iran's?
They too use Hitler methods,
taught them by the CIA, which,
incidentally, operates freely on
the Stanford campus. Where is
his outcry against them?
Hitler did not spring full
blown from the head of Satan.
It took a lot of people doing
nothing to make him what he
was. Hitler, the man, is now
dead. But many aspects of the
complex phenomenon that Hi
tler was are very much alive.
It would more suitably be
hoove Packenham to direct his
paroxysms against them.

Live petitions
urged
Deric Jennings reaffirmed
his support (Daily, )an. 31) for
the "live petitions" proposal
put forward by the Election Re
view Board last year.
As author of one of the two
alternate senate-reform prop
osals designed to eliminate
dominant slates, and member
of the senate committee which
put forward districting as a re
form proposal last year, I have

given the matter of senate re
form some thought.
The conclusion I have
reached is that the "live petiti
tions" proposal is by far the
best option available.
While the other two compet
ing proposals would represent
improvements on the present
system, neither could as reli
ably assure that a senate retain
its vigor and responsiveness in
the second half of a year. That
time is the crucial period to
follow-up legislation.
I urge the Associated Stu
dents to adopt the ERB reforms
this year.

Live petitions
urged
Deric Jennings reaffirmed
his support (Daily, )an. 31) for
the "live petitions" proposal
put forward by the Election Re
view Board last year.
As author of one of the two
alternate senate-reform prop
osals designed to eliminate
dominant slates, and member
of the senate committee which
put forward districting as a re
form proposal last year, I have

given the matter of senate re
form some thought.
The conclusion I have
reached is that the "live petiti
tions" proposal is by far the
best option available.
While the other two compet
ing proposals would represent
improvements on the present
system, neither could as reli
ably assure that a senate retain
its vigor and responsiveness in
the second half of a year. That
time is the crucial period to
follow-up legislation.
I urge the Associated Stu
dents to adopt the ERB reforms
this year.

Not 'mindless
and callous'
Prof. Robert Packenham
calls me "mindless and call
ous" (Daily, )an. 23) for having
cited in my column defending
anti-shah protesters (Daily,
)an. 17), a remark that "some of
the things the shah has done
make Hitler seem like Mary
Poppins."
I am afraid Packenham's sen
sibilities were not quite
matched by his grasp of the
implications of that remark,
which was made by the U.S.
Consul in Tehran.
It clearly signifies that the
U.S. government was willingto
shore up a dictator whose ex
cesses are considered by its
own diplomatic representa
tives to exceed those of the
man who has come to
exemplify the greatest evil of
all history, Adolf Hitler.
I had quoted that remark
without comment, on the as
sumption that its meaning
need not be spelled out, espe
cially to a professor of political
science. But apparently my
lack of comment led Pac
kenham to conclude that I was
quoting it with "approval" and

he kindly instructs me in the
enormity of the evils Hitler has
committed.
I am obliged to him, but sus
pect that my knowledge of
them may be more intimate
than his. I was a refugee from
Hitler's Austria, with all that
that entailed in loss of home,
roots, property and upheaval
of existence.
A member of my immediate
family was murdered in a con
centration camp. I spent the
impressionable 14th year of my
life as a )ew in Hitler's Vienna
and have seared on my con
sciousness the memory of
enough human vileness to last
a lifetime.
It took me 26 years to over
come the loathing I felt for Au
strians and Germans who,
through approval or silent ac
quiescence, allowed Hitler to
happen.
But it's me Packenham
dumps on, in a perfect illustra
tion of my original letter. It is
the protester, not the cause of
the protest, that gets the heat.
