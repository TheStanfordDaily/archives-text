## Cagers win laugher, lose squeaker 
### Chris Haft 
After doing so much to try to
win Saturday night's Pacific-10
Conference basketball game
against the University of
Arizona, the Stanford Cardi
nals had it lost for them by
something the referees didn't
do.
Russell Brown's 15-foot
jumper at the buzzer ended
several seconds of chaos and
gave Arizona a 63-62 victory
over Stanford.
The weekend wasn't a total
loss for the Cards, now 10-10
overall and 4-7 in Pac-10, as
they whipped Arizona State
75-61 Friday evening. Vet after
Saturday's gutbuster, it's im
possible to feel at all satisfied.
Doubtful basket
With 35 seconds left, no time
outs remaining for either team
and Arizona leading 61-60,
Brian Welch fouled Wildcat
forward )ohn Belobraydic.
Stanford received a break as
Belobraydic missed the first of
a one-and-one. The Cards got
the rebound, and scrambled
erratically while trying to find
an open man.
Surrounded by two
Wildcats, Wolfe Perry looked
up ?ind hit Welch standing
alone underneath the basket.
Welch's lay-in gave Stanford a
62-61 lead with just 10 ticks re
maining.
Belobraydic alertly grabbed
the ball and inbounded it to
Brown, the Wildcats' ball
handline wizard.

Brown weaved downcourt
and pulled up near the free
throw line with Cardinals and
Wildcats churningaround him.
Smith was wide open on the
right side, and Brown tried to
pass to him. Vet Brown was un
able to release the pass after
apparently being tied up by a
Stanford player.
Ordinarily, the rules suggest
that a jump ball should be cal
led. Brown could also have
been charged for traveling. But
no official blew a whistle, and
Brown went up for the game
winner.
"No, time was not out when
he (Brown) scored, definitely,"
said Stanford coach Dick Di-
Biaso. "I have other rather
strong opinions about what
happened in the final nine sec
onds, but Par-10 rules don't
permit me to talk about them.
There was definitely a mistake
made in the final nine seconds
by the officials."
Arizona coach Fred Snow
den, of course, saw matters dif
ferently. "Smith had an uncon
tested lay-up, and Brown was
giving it to him," said Snow
den. "But the ball was de
flected, and Russell caught it
back off the deflection while
he was in the air and shot it."
Neat and close
The two teams committed
just 25 fouls and 21 turnovers in
this neat, well-played game.
Competition was fierce in the
first half as nine ties and five
lead changes punctuated the

action.
At the start of the second half
the Cards were particularly de
vastating, outscoring Arizona
19-8 to take a 49-i8 lead with
14:45 to go. Perry's four bas
kets — three of them soaring
14-foot jumpers — highlighted
the surge.
Perry's 20-foot fadeaway
jumper made it 51-42, but
Arizona followed with six con
secutive points on Smith's two
baskets and ]ohn Hutcherson's
one. Joe Nehls' left-corner
jumper with 4:29 left tied the
score and set up the exciting,
disgusting finish.
ASU helpless
On Friday, ASU entered
Maples as the Pac-10's leading
rebounding team and with a
previous 80-68 triumph over
Stanford )an. 4 in its pocket.
However, neither Stanford
nor history could help the Sun
Devils on this night, as Stan
ford scored the first eight
points and remained unchal
lenged thereafter.
Nobody was more dominant
than Card forward kimberly
Belton. Atter opening the scor
ing against ASU with a three
point play, Belton never stop
ped providing excitement until
the end of the Arizona game.
Power and determination
was evident in Belton's every
move. With Stantord leading
the Sun Devils 8-0, he dove
headlong lor a loose ball that
ordinary players would have
given up on. Minutes later Bel

ton leaped high to grab a Perry
miss and monstrously slam the
rebound home.
Belton's 9th and 10th points
of the game, a fabulous
double-pump follow of his
own missed free throw with
10:14 left in the half, gave him
1000 points for his career.
As for his unfortunate 5-for
-17 free-throwing, Belton as
serted that fatigue was the
problem. "My arms were just
weary," he said. "Not to make

excuses, but I just couldn't fol
low through."
Belton did follow through
with another magnificent out
ing against Arizona: a game
high 25 points on 12-tor-15
shooting, nine rebounds and
six assists. According to Di-
Biaso, Belton did all this de
spite playing while sick to his
stomach in the second half.
"Belton had an incredible
weekend," said Dißiaso.
"Awesome . . . overpowering.
But I know Kim well enough to
know that he won't be happy."
"I said it down in Tucson and
I'll say it again — Belton is just
one great basketball player,"
praised Snowden.

Arizona coach Fred Snow
den, of course, saw matters dif
ferently. "Smith had an uncon
tested lay-up, and Brown was
giving it to him," said Snow
den. "But the ball was de
flected, and Russell caught it
back off the deflection while
he was in the air and shot it."
Neat and close
The two teams committed
just 25 fouls and 21 turnovers in
this neat, well-played game.
Competition was fierce in the
first half as nine ties and five
lead changes punctuated the

action.
At the start of the second half
the Cards were particularly de
vastating, outscoring Arizona
19-8 to take a 49-i8 lead with
14:45 to go. Perry's four bas
kets — three of them soaring
14-foot jumpers — highlighted
the surge.
Perry's 20-foot fadeaway
jumper made it 51-42, but
Arizona followed with six con
secutive points on Smith's two
baskets and ]ohn Hutcherson's
one. Joe Nehls' left-corner
jumper with 4:29 left tied the
score and set up the exciting,
disgusting finish.
ASU helpless
On Friday, ASU entered
Maples as the Pac-10's leading
rebounding team and with a
previous 80-68 triumph over
Stanford )an. 4 in its pocket.
However, neither Stanford
nor history could help the Sun
Devils on this night, as Stan
ford scored the first eight
points and remained unchal
lenged thereafter.
Nobody was more dominant
than Card forward kimberly
Belton. Atter opening the scor
ing against ASU with a three
point play, Belton never stop
ped providing excitement until
the end of the Arizona game.
Power and determination
was evident in Belton's every
move. With Stantord leading
the Sun Devils 8-0, he dove
headlong lor a loose ball that
ordinary players would have
given up on. Minutes later Bel

ton leaped high to grab a Perry
miss and monstrously slam the
rebound home.
Belton's 9th and 10th points
of the game, a fabulous
double-pump follow of his
own missed free throw with
10:14 left in the half, gave him
1000 points for his career.
As for his unfortunate 5-for
-17 free-throwing, Belton as
serted that fatigue was the
problem. "My arms were just
weary," he said. "Not to make

excuses, but I just couldn't fol
low through."
Belton did follow through
with another magnificent out
ing against Arizona: a game
high 25 points on 12-tor-15
shooting, nine rebounds and
six assists. According to Di-
Biaso, Belton did all this de
spite playing while sick to his
stomach in the second half.
"Belton had an incredible
weekend," said Dißiaso.
"Awesome . . . overpowering.
But I know Kim well enough to
know that he won't be happy."
"I said it down in Tucson and
I'll say it again — Belton is just
one great basketball player,"
praised Snowden.

A TYPICAL scene this past weekend in Maples Pavilion was kimberly
Belton making an unstoppable move to the basket. Here he stuffs
through two of his 25 points against Arizona in the Cards' tough
63-62 last-second loss.
After doing so much to try to
win Saturday night's Pacific-10
Conference basketball game
against the University of
Arizona, the Stanford Cardi
nals had it lost for them by
something the referees didn't
do.
Russell Brown's 15-foot
jumper at the buzzer ended
several seconds of chaos and
gave Arizona a 63-62 victory
over Stanford.
The weekend wasn't a total
loss for the Cards, now 10-10
overall and 4-7 in Pac-10, as
they whipped Arizona State
75-61 Friday evening. Vet after
Saturday's gutbuster, it's im
possible to feel at all satisfied.
Doubtful basket
With 35 seconds left, no time
outs remaining for either team
and Arizona leading 61-60,
Brian Welch fouled Wildcat
forward )ohn Belobraydic.
Stanford received a break as
Belobraydic missed the first of
a one-and-one. The Cards got
the rebound, and scrambled
erratically while trying to find
an open man.
Surrounded by two
Wildcats, Wolfe Perry looked
up ?ind hit Welch standing
alone underneath the basket.
Welch's lay-in gave Stanford a
62-61 lead with just 10 ticks re
maining.
Belobraydic alertly grabbed
the ball and inbounded it to
Brown, the Wildcats' ball
handline wizard.

Brown weaved downcourt
and pulled up near the free
throw line with Cardinals and
Wildcats churningaround him.
Smith was wide open on the
right side, and Brown tried to
pass to him. Vet Brown was un
able to release the pass after
apparently being tied up by a
Stanford player.
Ordinarily, the rules suggest
that a jump ball should be cal
led. Brown could also have
been charged for traveling. But
no official blew a whistle, and
Brown went up for the game
winner.
"No, time was not out when
he (Brown) scored, definitely,"
said Stanford coach Dick Di-
Biaso. "I have other rather
strong opinions about what
happened in the final nine sec
onds, but Par-10 rules don't
permit me to talk about them.
There was definitely a mistake
made in the final nine seconds
by the officials."
Arizona coach Fred Snow
den, of course, saw matters dif
ferently. "Smith had an uncon
tested lay-up, and Brown was
