Dave Meier and senior pow
erhouse )ohn Pyle, the Stan
ford baseball team roared past
the Humboldt State Lumber
jacks Saturday 14-5 and 11-4 at
home in Sunken Diamond.
The sweep of Saturday's
doubleheader concluded a
perfect opening weekend tor
the Cardinals who posted their
first victory of 1979 on Friday
with a 4-2 win over the Univer

sity of Nevada-Reno.
Meier, a sophomore transfer
trom Fresno City College, went
one-for-three Friday in a rather
humble beginning of his Stan
ford career. Saturday, how
ever, he sparked the team with
five hits in his eight trips to the
plate — including one triple
and one home run — while rol
ling up four RBIs.
Pyle, who mans first base for
the Cards this year, impressed
the sunny Saturday afternoon

crowd by jacking his first
homerun of the year off Lum
ber jack starter Dan Isaacson in
the second inning of the sec
ond game.
Stanford headcoach Mark
Marquess said, "Right now he
(Pyle) is swinging the bat really
well. He's probably got the
most power on the team He s
going to have to till that
(power) role."
Coach Marquess, who was
generally satisfied with the
outcome of the Cardinals'
opening weekend, pointed to
certain rough spots that will
have to be worked on during
the pre-season.
"The pitching was
adequate," Marquess said,
"but we're going to have to do

a lot better than that. I think
this is a team that is going to
improve," he added. "We're a
very young team."
Youth appeared to be an
asset on Friday when sopho
more righthander Paul Grame
pitched live innings against
Nevada-Reno, collecting five
strikeouts and allowing only
three walks. Senior Bruce Fiala
was accredited with Friday's
win, however, after the Wolt
Pack tied the game in the sixth
and Stanford went ahead in the
seventh while Fiala was on the
mound.
|oe LoPresti picked up his
tirst win of 1979 in the tirst
game of Saturday's twinbill.
The second game Saturday,
which was called after six in

nings on account of darkness,
featured larry kuhn and Rob
Irwin in performances that
were not their record best.
Nevertheless, the visitors from
rain-drenched northern
California, still squinting at the
bright sunlight ot the Bay Area,
tailed to take advantage of any
Cardinal weaknesses.
