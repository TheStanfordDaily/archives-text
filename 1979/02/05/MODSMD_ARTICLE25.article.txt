# Cards play best weekend ever
## 
### Rich Martinez 
The women's basketball
team played its finest basket
ball of the season this
weekend, defeating USC 68-61
and crushing Fresno State
68-43. There were several
reasons for the Cards' vic
tories, not the least of which
was a bet with Coach McCrea
that unless they won both
games, 32 series of "sidewin
der" would be awaiting their
completion at Monday's prac
tice.
This bit of incentive coupled
with a must-win situation
against USC resulted in the
women's most intense game of
the year.

"I told the girls before the
game," said McCrea, "that be
sides the league games we had
to beat the Trojans if we
wanted a playoff berth."
The Cardinals obviously
want to visit Santa Barbara, site
of the Western Regional
Playoffs, as they clearly out
played the women of Troy. The
two teams were knotted at 8-8
five minutes into the game be
fore USC pulled out to 14-8
lead with 11 minutes remaining
in the first half.
Stanford assumed the role of
the aggressor and immediately
controlled the breaks of the
game. A Debbie Gore steal, au
thoritative board play by

Jeanne Ruark, Louise Smith
and Kathy Murphy, and Angie
Paccione aerials put the Cards
ahead 18-16 with 8:40 remain
ing. Crisp outlets sparked a
good winning game and kept
the game at the Cards' pace.
The contest remained tight,
though, as USC employed an
equally strong defense.
Stanford's aggressive inside
game caused a major break as
Anna Maria Lopez, the Trojans'
freshman sensation, drew her
fourth foul with two minutes
remaining. The Cards then ac
cumulated a seven-point lead
35-28, as effective screening,
quick movement and sharp
passing made the Stanford set
offensive irrepressible.
USC retaliated with their
quick baskets, though, as the
season's finest half ended with
the Cards owning a slim 37-34
lead.
As the final twenty minutes
began it looked as if USC
would quickly change the
complexion of the game. The
Trojans ran off a quick six
points to lead 40-37 and an irate
Dotty McCrea called a time
out.
She must have said some
thing about sidewinders as
Stanford broke out of its brief
slump. The Cards went ahead
43-42 with 13.41 remaining and
never again did they relinquish

the lead.
The outstanding perfor
mances by Sally Chapman,
Kathy Schultz and Renee
Steiner kept the Cards at equal
strength while the starters re
ceived some rest.
"One of the most positive
aspects of this game," stated
McCrea, "was the play of our
reserves. I can confidently use
those three in a tight game
situation and that is a key factor
for a team's success."
Stanford maintained its level
of concentration at its apex as
USC unsuccessfully tried to
muster a comeback. Their in
side game was completely shut
down which left the burden on
the long range shooters.
The lead was increased to a
comfortable 66-53 margin with
two minutes left and Dotty
McCrea unsuccessfully tried to
hide a smile of pleasure.
Before Saturday evening's
game against Fresno State, the
public address system omin
ously failed to work. Stanford
took the cue and immediately
unplugged its opponents.
Keeping the emotional level
consistent with Friday evening,
the Cards blew the Bulldogs
out of the game early in the one
sided 68-43 affair.
Stanford jumped out to a
20-7 lead and that's the closest
the game ever was. Louise

Smith and Jeanne Ruark com
pletely stifled Fresno's star
center, Connie Gooch. Almost
indefensible in their first meet
ing, Gooch made only one of
twelve shots while being held
to a five point game
After leading at halftime
*8-17, the reserves saw plenty
of second half action while
breezing to a ronvincing, but
uneventful 25-point victory.

ing of the Bulldogs. The Cards also beat USC, 68-61, and now own a
glittering 15-3 overall record.
The women's basketball
team played its finest basket
ball of the season this
weekend, defeating USC 68-61
and crushing Fresno State
68-43. There were several
reasons for the Cards' vic
tories, not the least of which
was a bet with Coach McCrea
that unless they won both
games, 32 series of "sidewin
der" would be awaiting their
completion at Monday's prac
tice.
This bit of incentive coupled
with a must-win situation
against USC resulted in the
women's most intense game of
the year.

"I told the girls before the
game," said McCrea, "that be
sides the league games we had
to beat the Trojans if we
wanted a playoff berth."
The Cardinals obviously
want to visit Santa Barbara, site
of the Western Regional
Playoffs, as they clearly out
played the women of Troy. The
two teams were knotted at 8-8
five minutes into the game be
fore USC pulled out to 14-8
lead with 11 minutes remaining
in the first half.
Stanford assumed the role of
the aggressor and immediately
controlled the breaks of the
game. A Debbie Gore steal, au
thoritative board play by

Jeanne Ruark, Louise Smith
and Kathy Murphy, and Angie
Paccione aerials put the Cards
ahead 18-16 with 8:40 remain
ing. Crisp outlets sparked a
good winning game and kept
the game at the Cards' pace.
The contest remained tight,
though, as USC employed an
equally strong defense.
Stanford's aggressive inside
game caused a major break as
Anna Maria Lopez, the Trojans'
freshman sensation, drew her
fourth foul with two minutes
remaining. The Cards then ac
cumulated a seven-point lead
35-28, as effective screening,
quick movement and sharp
passing made the Stanford set
offensive irrepressible.
USC retaliated with their
quick baskets, though, as the
season's finest half ended with
the Cards owning a slim 37-34
lead.
As the final twenty minutes
began it looked as if USC
would quickly change the
complexion of the game. The
Trojans ran off a quick six
points to lead 40-37 and an irate
Dotty McCrea called a time
out.
She must have said some
thing about sidewinders as
Stanford broke out of its brief
slump. The Cards went ahead
43-42 with 13.41 remaining and
never again did they relinquish

the lead.
The outstanding perfor
mances by Sally Chapman,
Kathy Schultz and Renee
Steiner kept the Cards at equal
strength while the starters re
ceived some rest.
"One of the most positive
aspects of this game," stated
McCrea, "was the play of our
reserves. I can confidently use
those three in a tight game
situation and that is a key factor
for a team's success."
Stanford maintained its level
of concentration at its apex as
USC unsuccessfully tried to
muster a comeback. Their in
side game was completely shut
down which left the burden on
the long range shooters.
The lead was increased to a
comfortable 66-53 margin with
two minutes left and Dotty
McCrea unsuccessfully tried to
hide a smile of pleasure.
Before Saturday evening's
game against Fresno State, the
public address system omin
ously failed to work. Stanford
took the cue and immediately
unplugged its opponents.
Keeping the emotional level
consistent with Friday evening,
the Cards blew the Bulldogs
out of the game early in the one
sided 68-43 affair.
Stanford jumped out to a
20-7 lead and that's the closest
the game ever was. Louise

Smith and Jeanne Ruark com
pletely stifled Fresno's star
center, Connie Gooch. Almost
indefensible in their first meet
ing, Gooch made only one of
twelve shots while being held
to a five point game
After leading at halftime

of second half action while

uneventful 25-point victory.
