# Gymnasts sweep events at Davis

### Dean Eyre 
Davis — The itinerary for Stanford's gymnastics teams' trip to
the UC-Davis campus included departure and arrival times for the
chartered bus and the meet itself. The schedule might just as well
have listed a Cardinal victory celebration to follow the competi
tion, forthe Stanford men and women swept all but one of the ten
events.
Don't get the impression that the Cards could merely go
through the motions and come out as winners — they couldn't
and didn't; but a powerful combination of depth coupled with
stellar individual performances proved to be too much for the
Aggies.
In compiling a school record of 125.55 points, the Stanford
women won every event and Karen Hall captured the all-around
title with firsts in uneven parallel bars, floor exercise and balance
beam and a second in vaulting; her 9.0 in floor ex was the highest
mark of the women's meet.
Annie Smith placed second in all-around with seconds in bars
and floor. Her 8.8, first-place mark in vaulting set another school
record.
Other top finishers for the Cards included leanette Lacoste,
who earned third place on bars and fourth on beam, while team
captain Linda Park placed fourth in floor ex.
"From the scores the Davis team turned in (earlier in the sea
son) it seemed like they were going to have an edge over us," said
Card coach Jackie Walker. "This (win) makes me m&ch more
confident ot ou chance to go to regionals, not that we will
necessarily. It we had lost to Davis, I would have said there was no
chance for us to go to regionals, but this gives us a glimmer of
hope."
In the men's competition, Stanford outscored the Aardvarks
200.2 to 190.9 and won all but one event — vaulting. Tad Bostick
took the all-around title by tying for fourth with Brodie Lockard
on bars, placing third in vaulting and pommel horse and winning
the floor ex and high bar events.
Mike Lee finished second in all-around with a fourth on high
bar and firsts on bars and rings. Bob Daniel placed fourth in
all-around and earned a third on rings. Taking sixth in all-around
was John Marra, who also came in third on bars.
Other top performances included a fourth place finish in floor
ex by Corey Takimoto, a third on rings by Craig Goldman, fourth
in vaulting for Dan Margulies and Bob Magnini with thirds in floor
and high bar. Not least and certainly not last was co-captain Chris
Takimoto who was a runaway winner on pommel horse by almost
a point; his 9.6 was his season high performance.
