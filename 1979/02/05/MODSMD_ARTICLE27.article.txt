# Swimmers washed ashore by Bruin barrage

"GO FOR IT," screeched the Leland Stanford
Junior University swimming team, led by leaping co
captain Kevin Reel in a cheer that would have made
the yell leaders green with envy Saturday. The Cards
did indeed "go for it" in two action-packed meets
over the weekend.
The UCLA Bruins dove into deGuerre Friday after
noon and never stopped rocking the pool, as they
overwhelmed the Cardinal men, 72-59.
The air was notably tense with anticipation, but the
Bruins quickly dispelled any Stanford hopes for an
upset. They claimed convincing victories in the first
seven events before co-captain Mike Bruner broke
through the intangible yet pervasive barrier with a
new meet record in the 200 yard butterfly (1:49.0).
Although UCLA, an up-and-coming contender for
the NCAA title, clearly possessed a more dynamic
team, the Cards did not succumb easily and proved
themselves also deserving of national ranking.
Bob Hagberg and Sam Franklin pushed eventual
victor Bob Placek of UCLA with rapid second and
third-place times of 50.7 and 50.8 seconds respec
tively in the 100 yard fly.
UCLA's Brian Goodell, Olympic and NCAA champ
ion and American record holder, predictably sparked
his team in two winning distance swims. Famous for
his never-say-die finishes, he pulled ahead of Stan

ford's Paul Hartloff, another Olympic veteran, at the
halfway mark of the grueling 1000 freestyle and with
stood the pursuing Cardinal's final charge to win in
9:20.0. Hartloff, suffering from sprained ligaments
which hindered his flip turn push-offs from the wall,
bravely clocked a closing 9:21.6.
Coodell also triumphed in the 500 free to lead
UCLA to a 1-2-3 finish in that event and an insur
mountable team point compilation.
On the shorter side of the competition, Stanford
fared somewhat better. Junior John kingery sprayed
his opponents to capture the 100 free (47.0) with a
dead-heat lunge at the wall. Coach Jim Caughran
remarked that Kingery's startling performance must
have surprised the oppressive Bruins.
Stalwart Ken Shilling, a frequent catalyst for his
team's accomplishments, and freshman Steve
Soderberg shone individually for the Cards. New
comer Soderberg swam his best 100 backstroke ever
for a fifth place in the afternoon's opening event.
Shilling was locked out of victory but battled his
competitors persistently in three courageous losses.
Olympian Chris Woo (57.4) and Matt Rye (59.0) de
feated him (59.1) in an extra event, the 100
breaststroke, while the shaved-down Rye eclipsed
the meet record and achieved the NCAA standard in
the 200 breast (2:05.4). Rye's superior underwater
recoveries on each turn deprived Shilling of the satis

faction of a win to complement his outstanding 2:08.5
time.
Shilling edged ahead on his specialty breaststroke
leg of the 200 individual medley, only to be nipped in
the bud in the last five yards by Mike Saphir. Saphir
turned in a 1:54.8 to Shilling's 1:54.9.
Even though the meet's outcome had already been
determined, Stanford refused to relax in the meet's
culminating race, the 800 freestyle relay.
Bruner, gold medal winner on the U.S. 800 free
relay at Montreal, led oft the relay in a flat-start time of
1:39.0, which qualifies him for the NCAA 200 free.
Other relay members, Hartloff, Mike Anderson and
kingery lengthened Bruner's one-half pool-length
lead over UCLA to win resoundedly but narrowly miss
the standard.
Saturday's sunshine instilled the Cards with a re
turning confidence and provided them with much
less competition. The men submerged Texas A&M,
89-16, and the women toyed with the University of
Oregon and Texas A&M, whipping them, 91 l /i-}9 1 /2
and 106-26 respectively.
Linda Jezek continued to amaze the crowd with the
top time in the 100 backstroke yet to be recorded this
year. Five minutes after that feat, she came back to
win the 100 individual medley in another AIAW stan
dard time of 1:00.8.

his team in two winning distance swims. Famous for
his never-say-die finishes, he pulled ahead of Stan

ford's Paul Hartloff, another Olympic veteran, at the
halfway mark of the grueling 1000 freestyle and with
stood the pursuing Cardinal's final charge to win in
9:20.0. Hartloff, suffering from sprained ligaments
which hindered his flip turn push-offs from the wall,
bravely clocked a closing 9:21.6.
Coodell also triumphed in the 500 free to lead
UCLA to a 1-2-3 finish in that event and an insur
mountable team point compilation.
On the shorter side of the competition, Stanford
fared somewhat better. Junior John kingery sprayed
his opponents to capture the 100 free (47.0) with a
dead-heat lunge at the wall. Coach Jim Caughran
remarked that Kingery's startling performance must
have surprised the oppressive Bruins.
Stalwart Ken Shilling, a frequent catalyst for his
team's accomplishments, and freshman Steve
Soderberg shone individually for the Cards. New
comer Soderberg swam his best 100 backstroke ever
for a fifth place in the afternoon's opening event.
Shilling was locked out of victory but battled his
competitors persistently in three courageous losses.
Olympian Chris Woo (57.4) and Matt Rye (59.0) de
feated him (59.1) in an extra event, the 100
breaststroke, while the shaved-down Rye eclipsed
the meet record and achieved the NCAA standard in
the 200 breast (2:05.4). Rye's superior underwater
recoveries on each turn deprived Shilling of the satis

faction of a win to complement his outstanding 2:08.5
time.
Shilling edged ahead on his specialty breaststroke
leg of the 200 individual medley, only to be nipped in
the bud in the last five yards by Mike Saphir. Saphir
turned in a 1:54.8 to Shilling's 1:54.9.
Even though the meet's outcome had already been
determined, Stanford refused to relax in the meet's
culminating race, the 800 freestyle relay.
Bruner, gold medal winner on the U.S. 800 free
relay at Montreal, led oft the relay in a flat-start time of
1:39.0, which qualifies him for the NCAA 200 free.
Other relay members, Hartloff, Mike Anderson and
kingery lengthened Bruner's one-half pool-length
lead over UCLA to win resoundedly but narrowly miss
the standard.
Saturday's sunshine instilled the Cards with a re
turning confidence and provided them with much
less competition. The men submerged Texas A&M,
89-16, and the women toyed with the University of
Oregon and Texas A&M, whipping them, 91 l /i-}9 1 /2
and 106-26 respectively.
Linda Jezek continued to amaze the crowd with the
top time in the 100 backstroke yet to be recorded this
year. Five minutes after that feat, she came back to
win the 100 individual medley in another AIAW stan
dard time of 1:00.8.
"GO FOR IT," screeched the Leland Stanford
Junior University swimming team, led by leaping co
captain Kevin Reel in a cheer that would have made
the yell leaders green with envy Saturday. The Cards
did indeed "go for it" in two action-packed meets
over the weekend.
The UCLA Bruins dove into deGuerre Friday after
noon and never stopped rocking the pool, as they
overwhelmed the Cardinal men, 72-59.
The air was notably tense with anticipation, but the
Bruins quickly dispelled any Stanford hopes for an
upset. They claimed convincing victories in the first
seven events before co-captain Mike Bruner broke
through the intangible yet pervasive barrier with a
new meet record in the 200 yard butterfly (1:49.0).
Although UCLA, an up-and-coming contender for
the NCAA title, clearly possessed a more dynamic
team, the Cards did not succumb easily and proved
themselves also deserving of national ranking.
Bob Hagberg and Sam Franklin pushed eventual
victor Bob Placek of UCLA with rapid second and
third-place times of 50.7 and 50.8 seconds respec
tively in the 100 yard fly.
UCLA's Brian Goodell, Olympic and NCAA champ
ion and American record holder, predictably sparked
his team in two winning distance swims. Famous for
his never-say-die finishes, he pulled ahead of Stan

ford's Paul Hartloff, another Olympic veteran, at the
halfway mark of the grueling 1000 freestyle and with
stood the pursuing Cardinal's final charge to win in
9:20.0. Hartloff, suffering from sprained ligaments
