Iran adviser urges oil cutback
Tehran, Iran — An adviser to Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, providing clues to the possible future
of this oil-rich nation's economy, said yesterday
that Iran should cut its oil production by as much
as 60 percent and world petroleum prices should
be higher.
Such moves by a Khomeini-guided government
in Iran — now the world's second-largest exporter
of oil — could precipitate oil-supply problems
among industrialized nations.
Fazullah Bani-Sadr, a key economics adviser to
Khomeini, said he favors a new economic system
for Iran that would be "neither capitalist nor Mar
xist, nor a combination of the two."
He also said a new Iranian government would
have the right to cancel foreign debts incurred by
previous governments.
Khomeini has not yet indicated who would de
sign the economic system of the "Islamic repub
lic" he wants to create in Iran, and Bani-Sadr stres
sed that he is not sure he will get the job.
Teng assures free emigration
Seattle — Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping
neared the end of his U.S. tour yesterday and gave
assurances his nation would meet the require
ments needed to get American financial help in
modernizing.
After meeting with Teng, Sen. Henry lackson
(D-Wash.), said the Chinese leader maintained his
country would give public assurances that it would
fulfill the free emigration requirements of the
)ackson-Vanik amendment, which are needed to
give it most-favored nation trade status and allow it
lower tariffs and loans from the U.S. Export-Import
Bank.
"They are going to give public assurances,"
Jackson said after accompanying Teng on a tour of
the Boeing plant that will build the 747 jumbo jets
Teng's country has ordered.
lackson is the co-author — along with Rep.
Charles Vanik (D-Ohio) — of the amendment to
U.S. trade law that prohibits granting the favorable
tariff rates and credits to communist countries that
do not allow free emigration.

Postmaster predicts surplus
Washington — The Postal Service may finally be
headed for its first year in the black after failing
throughout the 1970s to achieve its goal of
eliminating deficits.
"This year, we have our best shot to accomplish
the major purpose of living within our income,"
Postmaster General William Bolger said in an in
terview.
Bolger said the current projection is for a $180
million surplus for the fiscal year that ends Sept.
30.
"Inflation is giving us the same problem that
everyone else has, but I still think we can have the
surplus because the volume of mail continues to
go up," Bolger said.
Genetic damage overlooked
Kittery, Maine — A scientist investigating
radiation-induced cancer deaths at Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard said yesterday the government ig
nored the possibility of genetic damage to the
workers' children for fear of opening a "Pandora's
box."
"I was amazed that nowhere in the govern
ment's guidelines was a mention of a genetic
study," said Dr. John Cobb, one of nine civilian
scientists assigned by Congress to check on the
investigation.
"It's a Pandora's box which no one in the gov
ernment wants to open," Cobb said.
But Dr. Anthony Robbins, who is heading the
investigation, said yesterday his health inves
tigators are well aware of the potential genetic
harm which may stem from radiation exposure.
Flood case ends in mistrial
Washington — Rep. Daniel Hood (D-Penn.), say
ing he is innocent, has expressed regret that his
bribery and perjury trial ended in a mistrial, appa
rently caused by one holdout among the jurors.
"I maintain my innocence of any wrongdoing in
the charges that were considered against me,"
75-year-old Hood said Saturday night after the
deadlocked federal jury of eight men and four
women was dismissed, ending nearly three days of

deliberations.
Juror Johnnie Lyles said the panel was 11 to 1 for
conviction on six of the seven bribery counts and
that "it was just a contrary old man who held out
on everything ... he didn't want evidence, he
wouldn't hear anything we had to say."
Flood was charged with one count of conspiracy
in a scheme to collect payoffs for political favors,
seven counts of bribery in receiving about $50,000
in a six-year period and three counts of lying under
oath that he ever got any such illegal cash.
Jobless rate dips slightly
Washington — The nation's unemployment rate
crept down from 5.9 percent to 5.8 percent in
lanuary, a sign that an economic slowdown fore
cast for 1979 has not yet surfaced, the government
reported Friday.
The Labor Department said employment during
the last month increased by a robust 450,000 as the
lobless rate fluttered between 5.8 percent and fa
percent for a sixth consecutive month.
Arson suspected in temple fire
Redwood City — Fire investigators combing the
ruins of a.Jewish synagogue found traces of a
flammable liquid yesterday as they looked for the
cause of a three-alarm Saturday night blaze which
injured two tirefighters and caused Si .5 million in
damage.
"It's under investigation right now, and arson is
strongly suspected," Alfred Hunt, a tire depart
ment battalion chief, said of the fire which de
stroyed the Temple Beth Jacob-Conservative.
Fire officials set damage to the building at $1
million. But they said dated scrolls, vestments and
silver altar materials destroyed by the fire could
