# Meyer flood books to be dried
## 
### Lee Tien 
Starting today, the same vacuum
chamber in which the Apollo moon
rover was tested will be used to
freeze-dry the first batch of the
40,00(1 books damaged by a water
main which burst Nov. 4 in the base
ment of Meyer Undergraduate Lib
rary.
Since the flood, the water-soaked
books have been kept frozen at the
Modern Ice and Storage Co. in San
lose, said book restoration project
assistant Sally Buchanan. The books
will be moved by two rented freezer
trucks to the Lockheed Missiles and
Space Company's vacuum chamber
in Sunnyvale in weekly shipments of
5000.
Buchanan said she estimated the
process of freeze-drying each batch
would take "about three or four
days." According to the library
timetable, all the books should be
completely dried in about two
months, she said.
Freezing slows any degeneration
of the printed matter which might
occur as a result ot the soaking. It
also retards mildew growth. By
freeze-drying the wet books, water
can be removed with a minimum of
physical damage to the books.
At Lockheed, the books will be
placed in the vacuum chamber and
the internal pressure decreased until
it approximates the atmospheric
pressure at an altitude of 200,000
feet.
The books will then be heated and
the moisture drawn out of the books
by the low pressure condensing on a
panel at the side of the chamber.
David Weber, director of Univer
sity libraries, said he hopes it will be

possible to have most of the hooks
back on the Meyer shelves by the
beginning of autumn quarter.
A test run with a sample batch of 82
frozen books was made in late
January, according to Weber. He re
ported that 90 percent of the books
were completely dry within three
days.
Once the batch of books has been
treeze-dried at Lockheed, it will be
taken to the now-closed Terman
Middle School in Palo Alto, where
the books will be kept until they re
gain their normal moisture content,
Buchanan said.
When the books first emerge from
the vacuum chamber, they are dessi
cated and "about as fragile as potato
chips," Buchanan said.
"We needed a place where we
could have an enormous amount of
shelf space," she said. Buchanan
added that the Palo Alto school dis
trict gave the University permission
to use Terman about two weeks ago.
After the books become stable,
they will be handled individually and
examined for traces of any lingering
damage.
Many of the necessary services in
volved in the restoration have been
donated by private firms. Buchanan
said "Lockheed has agreed to un
derwrite their part of the cost, which
will be approximately $110,000."
Other firms which donated services
were Modern Ice and Storage Co.,
Peninsula Creamery, Piers Dairy and
Kodak Processing Labs.
As a result of such donations, the
University's costs will mostly be con
fined to labor and transportation, ac
cording to Buchanan. She added,

however, that the University has not
yet approved the budget.
At the time ot the flood, the Uni
versity had a contingency plan for
treeze-drying, according to Bucha
nan. At first they were considering
using commercial freeze-dry
facilities, but Lockheed offered its
services and "Lockheed seemed to
have the best facilities for what we
needed," Buchanan said.
Buchanan said "the way Lockheed
is going to do it is totally new."
Buchanan and other library
employees are taking advantage of
the opportunity to conduct a small
scale research project. She said they
"hope to provide information to the
library community nationwide" in
case of similar disasters elsewhere.

examined for traces of any lingering
damage.
Many of the necessary services in
volved in the restoration have been
donated by private firms. Buchanan
said "Lockheed has agreed to un
derwrite their part of the cost, which
will be approximately $110,000."
Other firms which donated services
were Modern Ice and Storage Co.,
Peninsula Creamery, Piers Dairy and
Kodak Processing Labs.
As a result of such donations, the
University's costs will mostly be con
fined to labor and transportation, ac
cording to Buchanan. She added,

however, that the University has not
yet approved the budget.
At the time ot the flood, the Uni
versity had a contingency plan for
treeze-drying, according to Bucha
nan. At first they were considering
using commercial freeze-dry
facilities, but Lockheed offered its
services and "Lockheed seemed to
have the best facilities for what we
needed," Buchanan said.
Buchanan said "the way Lockheed
is going to do it is totally new."
Buchanan and other library
employees are taking advantage of
the opportunity to conduct a small
scale research project. She said they
"hope to provide information to the
library community nationwide" in
case of similar disasters elsewhere.
