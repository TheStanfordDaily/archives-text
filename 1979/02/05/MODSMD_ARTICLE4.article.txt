# Students rap new shower heads

### Carla Neasel 
Anyone who thinks student ac
tivism is dead has never installed
energy saving shower heads in stu
dent dormitories.
An on-going move by the Energy
Conservation Center (ECC) to re
place all shower heads in under
graduate housing complexes with
energy-saving heads that use less
water has aroused a storm of con
troversy among students.
According to ECC director Karl
lohnson, the new shower heads
seemed like a good idea when their
installation was approved last year by
University Housing Management
Services as part of a general energy
conservation program.
The new heads, which use two to
four gallons of water per minute less
than the old heads, will save an esti
mated 43 million gallons of water per
year. This represents an annual sav
ings of over $100,000 to the Univer
sity, according to Johnson.
Johnson said that before the deci
sion was made to install the new
shower heads he had talked at length
with administrators at the University
of Massachusetts, where the heads
have been in use for four years.
"They said that they had undere
stimated the amount of their sav
ings," he said, "and they didn't men

tion any student dissatisfaction."
But soon after the installation of
the new heads had begun here,
phones in the ECC office began to
ring, lohnson said he has received
over JO calls since the installation
process began at the beginning of
winter quarter.
"About five or so were really sup
portive and positive about them," he
said. "Others were really vehement.
One woman called and said that it
was the hottest topic in her dorm."
People who have called the center
have had differing complaints, said
lohnson. "One person called up and
said the showers were too hard.
Then someone called to tell us they
were too misty." Another complaint
from students is that the radius of the
flow is so great that the outer spray is
much cooler than the inner jet.
Does Johnson like the new
shower head?
"I used it and I liked it,"he said. "A
lot of other people have used it and
thought it was fine."
Junior Linda Dogue is not one of
those people, however. "I hate
them," she said flatly.
Freshman Edmund Gonzalez, who
said he misses the relaxing qualities
of a forceful spray, put forth a more
refined argument for the old
showerheads. "There's more to tak

ing a shower than just washing," he
said. "When I take a shower, I want
to have a good time."
Others feel their rights are being
infringed upon. "We're old enough
to be able to choose our own ways in
which we want to save energy, and
not have them forced upon us," said
|ohn Eberts, a sophomore.
Whatever their complaints, some
of those who are staunchly opposed
to the new shower heads have come
up with several alternatives, some of
which could get them into hot water
with University officials.
Many students report that they or
people they know make a practice of
turning two showers on at once and
directing the stream inward.
Another method reportedly
employed by some is to drill out the
existing holes in the heads to make
them larger.
Then there are the individuals who
turn tne showers on at night and let
them run to increase the reading on
the meters in order to make it appear
as if there had been no significant
water savings. "We'll show them"
seems to be the attitude here.
Some isolated facilities have not
been fitted with the new shower
heads, and the secret of these iso
lated enclaves is being jealously
guarded.
"Every floor in my dorm has the
new ones except mine. I think they
forgot us," said one student who
pleaded for anonymity. "If you tell
anyone where I live, I'll be killed,"
she said.
Other students have responded to
the crisis in a less clandestine man
ner.
Roble Hall residents have or
ganized a small committee, consist
ing of two students and two house
associates (RAs), to evaluate the reac
tions of house members to the new
shower heads.
Committee member Lenny Saltz,
an RA, said, "Basically, we're trying
to find out what the people in the
dorm want to do. We gave question
naires to everyone in the house, but
haven't evaluated them yet."
Saltz pointed out that in most cases
students were not notified before
the new shower heads were installed.
"I think more people were upset
about that than the actual
shower heads," he said.
Johnson acknowledged this fact,
and called the lack of notification

"tragic." He said that people had
"every right to know ahead of time.
They weren't told, and there is no
reason why they shouldn't be angry.
I'm really sorry it happened."
He said that prior to the installa
tion, he called up every housing
complex and gave word to someone
in charge. Apparently, that is as far as
the information got.
"Next time, I'll do it myself," he
said.
With the exception of the Cowell
cluster houses and areas where the
shower heads are bolted to the wall
in such a way that replacement is not
possible at tbis stage, the installation
of the new shower heads throughout
campus should be completed within
the next two weeks, according to Ed
Scoles, director of Housing Man
agement Services.
There is some small glimmering of
hope for all dedicated opponents to
the new plumbing technology.
Johnson said that "it's possible" that
one old shower head per shower
area may be returned.
But that event, he said, depends
on the outcome of tests, meter read
ings and the long-range student reac
tion to the new devices.
