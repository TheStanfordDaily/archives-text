# Senate to hold emergency meeting
## Little 11 funding inadequate 
### Brad Crystal 
The Council of Presidents has cal
led a special meeting of the ASSU
Senate tomorrow night to try and
find a way of raising an additional
$700 needed by Wednesday to send
20 student delegates to the Little Ele
ven Conference scheduled to take
place in Philadelphia this month.
Round-trip plane tickets must be
purchased by Wednesday to take ad
vantage of low-cost air fares. Thus
far, only $2300 of the $3000 necessary
to send the delegates has been raised
through donations from the Office of
Undergraduate Studies, the School
of Humanities and Sciences, the se
nate and COP discretionary funds,
and the other 10 schools participat
ing in the student conference, ac
cording to ASSU Co-President An
drew Goldenkranz.
Despite ihe little time remaining,
members ot the COP and the senate
contacted by Ihe Daily remain confi
dent that the necessary $700 will be
raised.
Goldenkranz said the student de
legates — five seniors, six juniors, six
sophomores, and three freshmen —
may be asked to pay $20 each for
food expenses. Senate chairperson
Peter Stamos suggested taking out a
loan from the ASSU reserve fund as
another possibility. "Where there's a
will there's a way," he said.
But according to SCIRE Co
director loan Harrington the chances
are "pretty slight" that the money
will be raised by the Wednesday

deadline. Harrington said the dele
gates might have to pay more than
$20 in the hope that their money
would be reimbursed by other
sources.
She said one possibility might be
the direct wiring of funds to Stanford
from the other participating institu
tions. She also suggested that each
delegate could go door-to-door in
his residence to raise the necessary
funds.
Contacted by the Daily last night,
Little Eleven coordinator Leonard
Ginsburg of the University of
Pennsylvania said he has personally
raised between $500 and $1000 and
that "every dime we have will go to
Stanford" in an emergency. "We're
not going to let Stanford fall by the
wayside," he said.
He added that the delegates and
coordinators from Stanford have
been exceptionally diligent in plan
ning for the conference. "The stu
dents at Stanford are just about the
best in the country," he said.
Although plans to send student de
legates were confirmed by the first
week of December, it was not until
)an. 26 that the ASSU issued a let
ter to administrators and trustees sol
iciting funds.
The letter co-signed by Golden
kranz and Harrington called the con
ference "the most exciting plan to hit
Stanford students in several years."
The letter requested financial assis
tance in the form of a loan which
would be paid back through a possi
ble Spring fee assessment.
Although Goldenkranz now claims
the fee assessment will only be
employed as a "last resort," the letter
stated "we are very confident of its
passage so the risk of loss is quite
small."
Stamos says he questions the via
bility of such a fee assessment. "It is
ethically amiss to fund things ex post
facto," he said.
Since fee assessments are set at a
minimum of one dollar per student,
the money raised would amount to
over twice the cost of sending dele
gates to the conference. Golden
kranz claims that the money could be
used for future Little Eleven confer
ences if this year's proves successful.
One week prior to the letter from
Goldenkranz and Harrington, Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons sent a
letter to Goldenkranz which said
Lyons did not believe it necessary for
the ASSU to seek outside funding for

the delegates "when there are
adequate funds at the disposal of the
association.''
"Allocating available monies to a
program is an important measure of
support," the letter said in part.
"Since the supply of money is li
mited here, it is almost always the
case that allocating funds for one
program' means that there are fewer
funds for other programs. Thus
judgments must be made not about
this program alone, but how impor
tant it is relative to other activities of
the ASSU.
"Seeking funds outside of the
ASSU should not be a way of avoid
ing such admittedly tough judg
ments," the letter concluded.
Goldenkranz called the idea of
complete ASSU financial support "a
ludicrous notion. If we want to pay
for it all it will be the only thing we do
all year," he said.
Stamos averred that exclusive
ASSU subsidization would result in
"bankruptcy." *
Although Lyons' letter questioned
the ASSU's efforts to seek outside
funding, it also pointed out that the
Office of Student Affairs had already
spent several hundred dollars to pay
for Goldenkranz to go East last fall to
plan the conference. "We did not
want the association to miss the op
portunity of participating," said
Lyons.
Goldenkranz acknowledged
Lyons' initial support last year: "I
have to give Lyons credit — he
jumped at the idea."
Stanford and the LJniversity of
Chicago are the only two schools
whose transportation costs present a
serious problem.
The total cost of transportation for
all the schools comes to $8150, with
Stanford's total cost amounting to
$5100. However, the other schools
involved reached a compromise
whereby Stanford would have to pay
just $3000.
The COP and the senate have con
tributed $200 and $300 respectively
out of their discretionary funds to the
project.
Some $1000 of the money raised
was donated by the Office of Under
graduate Studies, according to Assis
tant Dean Ruth Sloan. She said this
sum is an outright grant for which the
Office does not expect to be ;epaid.
Sloan said although it was unusual
for the Office to grant such a large
sum of money, the decision was
based on the COP's "full assurance
that the conference would affect the
entire undergraduate population."
The four day student symposium
on undergraduate education to be
held Feb. 22 to 25, will deal with such
topics as advising, women's issues,
minority affairs, student govern
ment, tuition, financial aids and ad
missions, student life, athletics and
the role of the university in social and
political problems.
The major emphasis of the confer

ence will be on the exchange of
ideas, information and programs.
Following the conference, dele
gates are required to submit commit
tee reports explaining what they dis
cussed and learned to various groups
here, including the trustees, Faculty
Senate and ASSU Senate.
According to Stamos, the Univer
sity "has little familiarity with what
goes on back East." He said one of
the primary goals will be to learn
ways of solving University problems
by investigating how schools of simi
lar size, cost and prestige cope.
