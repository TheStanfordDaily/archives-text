# McClenahan urges early action to reduce heart attack chances
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
Americans were urged to "do something now" to help
prevent heart attacks by Dr. James McClenahan, direc
tor of the Cowell Student Health Center, at a speech
here Thursday.
Speaking to an audience of approximately 60 people,
McClenahan stressed the importance of "'•isk factors" in
causing heart attacks. These "risk factors' incluae high
cholesterol intake, diabetes, obesity, high blood pres
sure, lack of exercise and heavy smoking.
McClenahan's lecture, the second of a series of four
health lectures sponsored by the Tresidder Program
Board, was titled, "To Keep Your Heart Healthy, You'd
Better Start Now" and emphasized ways of reducing
coronary risk factors.
According to McClenahan, "One can do something
about each of these risk factors."
He advocated "trying to maintain a lean weight," by
reducing fats, salts and high cholesterol foods, such as
dairy products, in one's diet. Citing research done with
monkeys, McCienahan explained that cholesterol
build-up in human arteries may be reversible, given the
proper diet.
"There's no guarantee that this (dissipation of choles
terol build-up) will happen in humans, but monkeys are
an animal very close to humans," he said.
McClenahan also stressed the importance of smoking

as a cause of heart attacks. According to McClenahan,
heavy smoking doubles the chances of heart attack. As
he explained, "I have one word to say about smoking —
don't."
Proper exercise is a significant preventive measure
against hpart disease, according to McClenahan. Repeti
tive motion ior2o minutes, three or four times a week, is
adequate conditioning. "It (physical fitness) is an ac
complishable task. You don't have to be a super jock."
Stress redu( tion is also important in preventing heart
attack, he said Although not an obvious cause of heart
attack, constant stress seems to lead to high blood pres
sure, which is ti direct cause of heart failure, McClena
han explained. "Stress is probably a risk factor but not as
much is known about it as the rest of the factors," he
said.
A physical fitness program, aimed at reducing these
risk factors can significantly reduce the chance of heart
disease or failure, he said. "The heart is a remarkable
organ. Once you appreciate it, maybe you'll do some
thing about it."
McClenahan noted the difficulty in getting college
students involved in preventative health care, saying,
"It's hard to get 20-year-old people interested in what's
going to happen to them when they're 65."
But "heart disease (in the United States) accounts for
more deaths than all other diseases combined," he ad
ded.
