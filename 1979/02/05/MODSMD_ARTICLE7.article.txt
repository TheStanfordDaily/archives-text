# Center mobilizes physically limited
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
There was little chance that
20-year-old Arthur Ahlberg
could attend UC-Berkeley, de
spite his admittance to the uni
versity in 1976. A victim of
cerebral palsy and curvature of
the spine, Ahlberg had no bod
ily sensation from the waist
down. He was confined to his
bed, except for occasional trips
in a manually-operated wheel
chair. A college life, indepen
dent of doctors and parents,
posed a major challenge.
Yet Ahlberg will graduate
this june with a bachelor's de
gree in mechanical engineer
ing after three successful years
at Cal. He met the challenge
with the help of the Rehabilita
tion Engineering Center (REC)
at the Children's Hospital at
Stanford, where staff designed
an electric wheelchair and a
suspension system that gives
him both mobility on the Ber
keley terrain and a means of
getting in and out of the chair.
Helping people like Ahlberg
gain greater control over their

environment is one of the
central objectives of the REC.
As Maurice Leßlanc, technical
head of the center, stated,
"Our business is making spe
cial devices for people with
special needs."
Affiliated with the or
thopedic division at Children's
Hospital, the center opened in
1974 with a staff of six. Cur
rently, there are 14 staff mem
bers, including engineers,
brace and limb support
specialists and artificial limb
specialists. These experts in
vent, modify and perfect vari
ous devices for the physically
limited.
Rehabilitation engineering is
a relatively new field, and the
center here is one of 15 similar
facilities across the country.
Thus, the REC provides ser
vices and information to chil
dren and adults from across
the nation, Leßlanc said
Since its opening, the REC
has admitted more than 1200
patients, many of whom visit
the center on a continuing
basis. Most of these patients
are children who are referred
to the center by doctors and
hospitals, because for many, it
is a last chance for help — the
place to turn to when other
possibilities are exhausted. As
Leßlanc noted, "Usually, the
buck stops here."
Because of this, center staff
members are often called upon
to solve rare problems. For
example, if a child with no arms
or legs needs mobility, en
gineers at the center can devise
an electric wheelchair with a
chin switch — a viable alterna
tive to the standard chair with
controls at arm level.
In another case, a girl who

cannot use her hands and arms
is alsounable to speak orwrite.
Center staff members provide
a "board of words" for com
munication. Leßlanc said that
by using a long pointer at
tached to a head brace, the
child can now communicate by
indicating specific words on
the board. When she points to
the word "cold," the square
lights up, letting others know
her needs.
Although some of the de
vices at the center are com
pletely novel, some designs
are modified versions of exist
ing mechanisms. If a device is
commercially available, staff
members usually know how
and where to obtain it, and in
this way, REC serves as an in
formation source for patients.
"We are currently doing a
survey of the commercial field,
trying to discover the unmet
needs of physically limited
people," explained John Pre
ston, an educational trainer at
REC.
The center and its staff now
handle over 100 patients a
month, with each patient visit
ing the REC an average of four
times.
]oe Wilkins, 17, of San lose
has kyphosis, backward curva
ture of the spine. Referred to
the center by doctors at Stan
ford Hospital, Wilkins spent
his first visit to the REC being
measured for a back brace. On
the second visit, the specially
designed brace, fashioned
from a plaster cast mold, was
checked for comfortable fit.
Between Wilkins' second
and third visits, prosthetists ad
justed the brace in one of the
center's workshops. The third
and fourth visits were reserved
for last-minute refinements in

the device and for showing
Wilkins how to use and care for
the brace.
Wilkins was lucky. Although
he did not anticipate problems
with his new brace, many pa
tients have trouble adjusting to
a strange and often frightening
device. Many parents can't ac
cept the thought of an artificial
limb on theirchild. A newarm,
an electronic word board, a
technologically complicated
wheelchair can be shocking
reminders of a malady many
people can't and won't accept.
As Preston noted, "Some de
vices you know are never going
to be used," although center
counselors can often help a pa
tient's family realize the impor
tance of the new device.
Despite counseling efforts,
the center's inventions are not
always beneficial, with some
patients never adjusting. Yet
despite failures and the severe
physical limitations of many of
the center's patients, both staff
and patient morale is high.
"Kids are great fun to work
with because they always want
to charge ahead," Leßlanc
said.
"The work can be frustrating
but it can also be rewarding
when one puts in a lot of time
and creativity and sees the suc
cess of his work," explained
Lee Strakbein of the center's
mobility center.
Wilkins, a former football
player at his high school, is ex
pected to have a straighter
spine and less pain a year from
now when he can stop wearing
the brace. Ahlberg enjoys a
kind of life he could not ex
perience without his special
chair.
These are the results of the
REC staff efforts.

patients, many of whom visit
the center on a continuing
basis. Most of these patients
are children who are referred
to the center by doctors and
hospitals, because for many, it
is a last chance for help — the
place to turn to when other
possibilities are exhausted. As
Leßlanc noted, "Usually, the
buck stops here."
Because of this, center staff
members are often called upon
to solve rare problems. For
example, if a child with no arms
or legs needs mobility, en
gineers at the center can devise
an electric wheelchair with a
chin switch — a viable alterna
tive to the standard chair with
controls at arm level.
In another case, a girl who

cannot use her hands and arms
is alsounable to speak orwrite.
Center staff members provide
a "board of words" for com
munication. Leßlanc said that
by using a long pointer at
tached to a head brace, the
child can now communicate by
indicating specific words on
the board. When she points to
the word "cold," the square
lights up, letting others know
her needs.
Although some of the de
vices at the center are com
pletely novel, some designs
are modified versions of exist
ing mechanisms. If a device is
commercially available, staff
members usually know how
and where to obtain it, and in
this way, REC serves as an in
formation source for patients.
"We are currently doing a
survey of the commercial field,
trying to discover the unmet
needs of physically limited
people," explained John Pre
ston, an educational trainer at
REC.
The center and its staff now
handle over 100 patients a
month, with each patient visit
ing the REC an average of four
times.
]oe Wilkins, 17, of San lose
has kyphosis, backward curva
ture of the spine. Referred to
the center by doctors at Stan
ford Hospital, Wilkins spent
his first visit to the REC being
measured for a back brace. On
the second visit, the specially
designed brace, fashioned
from a plaster cast mold, was
checked for comfortable fit.
Between Wilkins' second
and third visits, prosthetists ad
justed the brace in one of the
center's workshops. The third
and fourth visits were reserved
for last-minute refinements in

the device and for showing
Wilkins how to use and care for
the brace.
Wilkins was lucky. Although
he did not anticipate problems
with his new brace, many pa
tients have trouble adjusting to
a strange and often frightening
device. Many parents can't ac
cept the thought of an artificial
limb on theirchild. A newarm,
an electronic word board, a
technologically complicated
wheelchair can be shocking
reminders of a malady many
people can't and won't accept.
As Preston noted, "Some de
vices you know are never going
to be used," although center
counselors can often help a pa
tient's family realize the impor
tance of the new device.
Despite counseling efforts,
the center's inventions are not
always beneficial, with some
patients never adjusting. Yet
despite failures and the severe
physical limitations of many of
the center's patients, both staff
and patient morale is high.
"Kids are great fun to work
with because they always want
to charge ahead," Leßlanc
said.
"The work can be frustrating
but it can also be rewarding
when one puts in a lot of time
and creativity and sees the suc
cess of his work," explained
Lee Strakbein of the center's
mobility center.
Wilkins, a former football
player at his high school, is ex
pected to have a straighter
spine and less pain a year from
now when he can stop wearing
the brace. Ahlberg enjoys a
kind of life he could not ex
perience without his special
chair.
These are the results of the
REC staff efforts.

For Stacy Mariyama, two legs designed by staff members at the Rehabilitation Engineering Center in the
Children's Hospital mean the difference between life in a confining wheelchair and freedom to walk.
There was little chance that
20-year-old Arthur Ahlberg
could attend UC-Berkeley, de
spite his admittance to the uni
versity in 1976. A victim of
cerebral palsy and curvature of
the spine, Ahlberg had no bod
ily sensation from the waist
down. He was confined to his
bed, except for occasional trips
in a manually-operated wheel
chair. A college life, indepen
dent of doctors and parents,
posed a major challenge.
Yet Ahlberg will graduate
this june with a bachelor's de
gree in mechanical engineer
ing after three successful years
at Cal. He met the challenge
with the help of the Rehabilita
tion Engineering Center (REC)
at the Children's Hospital at
Stanford, where staff designed
an electric wheelchair and a
suspension system that gives
him both mobility on the Ber
keley terrain and a means of
getting in and out of the chair.
Helping people like Ahlberg
gain greater control over their

environment is one of the
central objectives of the REC.
As Maurice Leßlanc, technical
head of the center, stated,
"Our business is making spe
cial devices for people with
special needs."
Affiliated with the or
thopedic division at Children's
Hospital, the center opened in
1974 with a staff of six. Cur
rently, there are 14 staff mem
bers, including engineers,
brace and limb support
specialists and artificial limb
specialists. These experts in
vent, modify and perfect vari
ous devices for the physically
limited.
Rehabilitation engineering is
a relatively new field, and the
center here is one of 15 similar
facilities across the country.
Thus, the REC provides ser
vices and information to chil
dren and adults from across
the nation, Leßlanc said
Since its opening, the REC
