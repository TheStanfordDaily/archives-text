# Grouchy clerks, long lines
## Post Office scrutinized 
### Andrew Kich 
One of the major annoyances of campus life,
judging from recent complaints, is having to
deal with the Post Office. The gripes have
ranged from charges of rudeness and incompe
tency to exasperation over the length of the
seemingly endless line.

News analysis

Some general complaints are summed up by
sophomore )anet Scoutten. "There seems to be
a lack of willingness to give service there. It's
mostly just personal attitudes. They're not con
cerned with processing people through and it's
reflected in the long lines."
Post Office Manager Ron Sodlink admitted
that employee courtesy and attitude is a big
complaint. "I periodically have to remind them
(the employees)," he said.
But from his point of view, it's not a one-si Jed
problem. "The students and others aren't happy
standing in line for 20 minutes, so they're an
noyed when they get to the window. This affects
the clerks."
Only between classes
But Sodlink added that "the lines are long for
about 20 minutes each hour, primarily between
classes. The rest of the time there's no trouble."
The Post Office employs 16 clerks altogether,
which Sodlink said he considers to be quite
adequate.
"You can't have more people than you need
just in case a crowd comes in," he explained.
"We try to keep at least three clerks at the win
dows at all times, by rotating lunches and such."
And some of the current "problems" are tem
porary, Sodlink said. Within the next few weeks,
five of the 12 routes the Stanford branch cur
rently services will be transferred to another

branch. "This will relieve some of the line in that
you won't have these people anymore," he
explained.
Stamps only
A frequent suggestion made to Post Office
officials is to institute a stamps-only line and
maybe a package pick-up line as well. Said Sod
link: "We used to have stamps-only and pick
ups-only windows, but when the Post Office
switched to the bank-style single line, we
switched to this policy."
He said he feels that the all-services system
has worked out better.
The problem with stamp machines stems from
foreign coins, Sodlink said. "We have a pile of
foreign coins in the office; they jam the
machines," he explained. The problem is com
pounded by higher-than-normal stamp demand
caused by the removal of a stamp kiosk which
used to sit in the parking lot of Stanford Shop
ping Center.
Cost prohibitive
"I imagine it will be replaced as soon as con
struction is through there," Sodlink said. "But
the cost would be prohibitive to have a kiosk out
here."
Unlike some places, there are no complaints
here of a shortage of Post Office boxes. In fact,
Sodlink said that "almost half have never been
used."
And mail delivery receives compliments. Said
junior Sue Schelley, "They're really good about
delivery to the boxes. I've received mail twice a
day."
Perhaps the return of the kiosk and the trans
fer of extra routes will alleviate some of the
burden on the Post Office. But in the meantime,
the complaints, such as Bruce Heiman's "I don't
like them; they take too long'" and the sugges
tions, such as Scoutten's "They should get a new
staff" will probably continue.
