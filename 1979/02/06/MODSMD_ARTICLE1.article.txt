# Committee selected to name dean
## 
### Samuel Howe 
President Richard Lyman an
nounced Friday the names of those
selected to serve on the search
committee to find a successor to
Arjay Miller, dean of the Graduate
School of Business, who announced
that he plans to retire July 1.
Business School Prof. Charles
Horngren was named chairman of
the search committee the day Miller
resigned, Jan. 25. Lyman announced
Friday that Business School Prof.
George Bach will serve as vice chair
man. Bach served on the original
search committee 10 years ago that
brought Miller to the Business
School.
Included on the committee are
Business School Professors William
Miller, David Montgomery, Jerry
Porras, William Sharp, James Van
Home and Robert Wilson. Ann Marie
Scotney, a first-year student at the
Business School, will be the student
representative.
Other members
Also included are Walter Haas Jr.,
chairman of the board of the Levi
Strauss Co. and a member of the Bus
iness School Advisory Council, and
Mary Lanigar, a former advisory
council member who recently re
tired from Arthur Young and Co.,
where she was the first woman part
ner in the accounting firm's history.
Horngren said that the committee
met Friday and will meet again to
morrow with Lyman and Dean Miller.
Lyman made the appointments
based on consultation with the "ap
propriate deans" in the Business
School and with the Committee on
Committees (the body of the Faculty
Senate responsible for making vari
ous nominations and appointments),
according to Jean Fetter, assistant to
the president.
Fetter said that the student ap
pointment came from a selection
made by the executive committee of
the M.B.A. Student Association.
'Full speed ahead'
Horngren said that although his
committee will go "full speed ahead''
in its search, it will be "a question of
several months" before a new dean
is named.
Under Miller's leadership the
Graduate School of Business has
been rated as the best in the country
since a 1974 nationwide poll of busi
ness school deans voted it number
one.
Miller came to the University after
serving for 23 years with Ford Motor
Co. He was president of Ford from
1963 to 1968.
Associate Dean Robert Jaedicke
will serve as acting dean from July 1
until Miller's successor is chosen,
Lyman said.
The Business School endowment
rose from $6.4 million to $23.2 mill
ion under Miller's direction. Pledges
soared from less than $50,000 to
more than $5 million.
The faculty at the Business School
has grown from 73 to 84 and the
number of endowed chairs has gone
from six to 21.
