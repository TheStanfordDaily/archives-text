J Morales fondly calls "cartoons

• "I'm like the satirizing car
-1 toonist, watching the world go
J by and raving about it, but with
• a sense of humor," says
• Forbes, a junior majoring in
Z creative writing. "I especially
" like social deviants. I have this
• philosophy that everyone is a
• deviant but no one wants to
« admit it. It's a theme in my car
-2 toons; I look at the absurdity of
life and there's really too much
• to occupy myself with."
• Though UC-Berkeley
J would probably be "more ab
•surdthan here," Forbes finds
• ample material here for her
:cartoons. "Stanford has its
.own quirks, its own reputation
J to play on," she says.
• Morales also says he seldom
»runs out of inspiration, but
I admits that sometimes it hits at
JJawkward moments. "Ideas
"come in rushes — groups of
• five or six at a time. It happens a
Hot in class, particularly in Rus
*sian class and it's embarras
sing."
• Often the actual drawing
"plan is the most time

consuming process, some
times taking hours.
"It's not easy to translate
things into four-panel draw
ings with characters acting out
life. Dupie is kind of innocent,
just like i was. You expose
yourself to the world," he
muses.
Still, Morales, who says he's
an economics major although
"I don't know why," manages
to compose five strips a week.
And he insists that he'd draw
for free if he had to.
"I've really gotten into it this
year," he says."I would take
$150 a week in a cheap apart
ment somewhere because I
like it so much. I don't have any
aspirations with a dollar sign
popping out. Some agents at
the Business School offered to
syndicate 'Dupie' to college
newspapers, but I'm not ready
to do things like that — I don't
want to turn it into a money
making scheme."
Does it say something?
Instead, "Cartooning has
got to be an art form. It says
something, and the definition
of art is whether or not it really
says something. Vou can judge
it by what it tells people of fu
ture generations who are try
ing to get a glimpse of what this
life is like."
Morales says that before his
sophomore year in high school
he thought he couldn't draw.
Then, forced to fill in for his
high school newspaper's car
toonist, he was christened the
school cartoonist somewhat
against his will, in spite of the
fact that his first work was "Aw
ful, like a four-year-old's.''
Handy, a sophomore who
says he's drawn for "a long
time," became interested in
comics in part because he
loved 'Peanuts" when he was
young. But now his face sours
at the mention of Charlie
Brown, and he explains that
newspaper comics disappoint
him.
Likes undergrounds
"Most of them are real
stupid jokes and puns," Handy
explains. "There'salwayssome
buffoon with bad things hap
pening to him. I like under
grounds now — they're bizarre
but they're pretty funny."
His own work reflects the in
fluence of personal favorites
like Robert Crumb, who
created X-rated Fritz the Cat.
"I like being controversial,

because if you're not, you're
banal. It's not like I have a list of
favorite topics, but Stanford is
pretty rich, and there's a lot of
pretentiousness here, and a lot
of sex. I think I have an intelli
gent audience, but any audi
ence needs to be shaken up."
Some of his work, he says,
has been pulled from Chaparral
publication out of deference to
advertisers, but Handy says
that sexually graphic cartoons
are not necessarily offensive.
"A lot of college stuff is still
censored, but explicit sex isn't
necessarily pornographic or
bad if there's an idea, a point
behind it." Still, meaningless
vulgarity tries his patience, he
says, as well as his liberal views
on censorship.
"You wouldn't believe some
of the stuff submitted here. I
think I have a pretty good
senseof humor, and it's impor
tant to be able to distinguish
between what's funny and
what's not. We get stupid bat
hroom humor from people
who think that 'shit' or 'fuck'
will get them a laugh. I con
sider that pornography."
Forbes agrees that good car
tooning requires controversy,
because satire means "tramp
ing on someone's toes. It's not
like you're trying to make
someone mad, you're just try
ing to get them to take some
thing lighter. It takes a good
sense of humor, although
some people think mine is
warped." She laughs, and says
that her sense of humor and
her drawing change to reflect
her changing outlook.
Morales, too, says his style is
always improving. "My charac
ters in Dupie have evolved a lot
since the beginning of the
year," he points out. "I still
hate drawing people parts like
heads and hands, but I decided
I had to learn how to do them.
"It's part of my nature," he
continues slowly, "to blast, to
be cynical about everything.
But I try to learn from criticism
when it's constructive.
"Who doesn't like cartoons?
People like to laugh. If you
make them laugh they like you.
When you make them laugh
and see themselves — when it
hits them in the gut — that's
what makes a cartoon."

fluence of personal favorites
like Robert Crumb, who
created X-rated Fritz the Cat.
"I like being controversial,

because if you're not, you're
banal. It's not like I have a list of
favorite topics, but Stanford is
pretty rich, and there's a lot of
pretentiousness here, and a lot
of sex. I think I have an intelli
gent audience, but any audi
ence needs to be shaken up."
Some of his work, he says,
has been pulled from Chaparral
publication out of deference to
advertisers, but Handy says
that sexually graphic cartoons
are not necessarily offensive.
"A lot of college stuff is still
censored, but explicit sex isn't
necessarily pornographic or
bad if there's an idea, a point
behind it." Still, meaningless
vulgarity tries his patience, he
says, as well as his liberal views
on censorship.
"You wouldn't believe some
of the stuff submitted here. I
think I have a pretty good
senseof humor, and it's impor
tant to be able to distinguish
between what's funny and
what's not. We get stupid bat
hroom humor from people
who think that 'shit' or 'fuck'
will get them a laugh. I con
sider that pornography."
Forbes agrees that good car
tooning requires controversy,
because satire means "tramp
ing on someone's toes. It's not
like you're trying to make
someone mad, you're just try
ing to get them to take some
thing lighter. It takes a good
sense of humor, although
some people think mine is
warped." She laughs, and says
that her sense of humor and
her drawing change to reflect
her changing outlook.
Morales, too, says his style is
always improving. "My charac
ters in Dupie have evolved a lot
since the beginning of the
year," he points out. "I still
hate drawing people parts like
heads and hands, but I decided
I had to learn how to do them.
"It's part of my nature," he
continues slowly, "to blast, to
be cynical about everything.
But I try to learn from criticism
when it's constructive.
"Who doesn't like cartoons?
People like to laugh. If you
make them laugh they like you.
When you make them laugh
and see themselves — when it
hits them in the gut — that's
what makes a cartoon."
