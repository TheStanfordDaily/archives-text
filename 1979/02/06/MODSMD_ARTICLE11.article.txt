# Asian likes American openness
## Exchange student adjusts 
### Susan Essoyan 
Takayoshi Yano has ad
justed to almost all aspects
of American life. Except
slow dancing.
"Taka," as he is called
here, is a one-year ex
change student from Keio
University in Japan. He said
he tried slow dancing dur
ing Christmas break but
found it "very strange."
"In Western culture,
physical contact between
men and women in public is
not so unusual, but in Ja
pan, we never..." His voice
trailed off.
Led Zeppelin blasted on
the stereo in Taka's Junip
ero room while he pored
over an economics book.
He seemed little different
from other students.
But when he arrived here
in September on his first trip
to the United States, the
22-year-old said he went
through "heavy culture
shock" for a few days.
The wide-open space on
campus surprised him, as
did the "hi's" from girls he
barely knew. At home he

wouldn't say hello to
women unless he knew
them well, he said, but
added that now he likes it.
"It's a good custom for
human relations," he said.
A junior majoring in in
ternational relations, Taka
finds his classes here harder
than at home because of the
language barrier. But he
said he felt "very lucky to be
here." /
He commended the Uni
versity for its small class dis
cussions and mandatory of
fice hours for professors.
Most Japanese professors
don't have office hours,
Taka said. "I envy the
American educational sys
tem," he added.
Because campus life
shows Taka only a segment
of American society, he
took a Greyhound bus to
the East Coast in December.
"I wanted to see raw
America,"he said. But to his
surprise, one of the "aver
age" Americans that sat next
to him on the trip conversed
with him in Japanese. Ironi
cally, the 22-year-old mis

sionary's son had lived in
Japan during high school.
Other Americans were
less responsive. In New
York many ignored his re
quests for directions. In a
subway he witnessed a
mugging. But, on the
whole, he said the trip was a
"good experience."
Taka encouraged stu
dents, here to join the Keio
Exchange Committee which
sponsors a two-month cul
tural exchange between
Japan and the United States
during spring and summer.
Eight of Taka's classmates
will arrive here on Feb. 23.
Unlike Taka, they will only
audit classes, first living
with American families in
the area, then moving into
dorms.
Stanford students com
plete the exchange by going
to Japan during the sum
mer.
"It's one of the best ways
to see Japan," Taka said.
American students live with
Japanese families, attend
lectures at Keio University
and go sightseeing.
