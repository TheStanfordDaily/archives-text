Hollywood (AP) — What's this — the Disney
organization releasing a PC-rated movie?
Parents of America need not fear that stan
dards are crumbling in that Burbank bastion of
purity, Walt Disney Productions. The company's
subsidiary, Buena Vista Distribution Co., plans
to release Take Down, a movie about high
school wrestling made by the American Film
Consortium.
The new film stars Edward Herrmann, Kath
leen Lloyd and Fernando Lamas. An outside
production, it will not bear the Disney name.
Bathroom scene
The PG parental guidance rating apparently
stems from a fairly harmless bathroom scene.
For the last two decades, Buena Vista has de
voted its efforts strictly to distributing the

C-rated Disney films in this country.
Buena Vista president Irving Ludwig
explained the policy change:
Expanding
"Our own production has reached heights we
have never before achieved. Besides our usual
fine family entertainment, we are expanding
into new areas. We are aiming for wider areas
and using bigger names.
"To keep pace with that development, we
thought it would be a good idea to pick up
outside films and add to our program. Take
Down is not exactly our kind of film; it has a
different kind of appeal. Ours generally attract
the young audience; we're not strong with the
15-24 group
