## Deliver mail to student residences 
### 
The 15 cent stamp stuck on a one-ounce
letter is supposed to pay for its delivery to
the addressee. If your address is Toyon,
Florence Moore, Branner, Roble, Wilbur,
Lagunita Court or Donner, however, it
doesn't.
In order to receive mail you are required
to rent a post office box for $20 per year.
Most people in this country receive their
mail free of charge — the postage affixed
by the sender pays for delivery direct to
the recipient's home.
Letters addressed to you, 2300 residents
of the above halls, carry the same amount
of postage as anyone else's. But the U.S.
Postal Service has decreed that as a resi
dent of a school or university dormitory it
is not your right to receive mail there, at
least not if the mailman has to sort it into
individual boxes.
This 1972 ruling was made in order to
help "maintain an efficient system of col
lecting, sorting, and delivery of the mail
nationwide."
The Postal Manual tells us that mail to
prisons, hospitals, hotels, and similar in
stitutions, including school dormitories,
will be delivered in bulk to the offices of
the organization. Mail is then sorted and
given to the inmates or guests by
employees of the institution.
Hospitals and prisons certainly have an
interest in handling inmates' mail, and
hotels obviously must handle mail for trans
ients. But it is not clear why students have
been included in this list (other than the
fact that the postal service saves money)..

Nine months is greater than the average
turn-over time in some apartment com
plexes, the residents of which receive
their mail individually delivered by the
postal service. The University housing sys
tem has no legal reason to monitor resi
dents' mail, nor(likely) any desire todo so.
The government of the United States,
via the Postal Service, is currently denying
equal treatment in the delivery of mails to
persons living in student dormitories.
Student status and the lack of kitchen
facilities in one's place of residence is not a
legitimate basis for discrimination in gov
ernmental services.
Students across the country are forced
to pay extra (through tuition) because
their schools incur the cost of doing the
post office's job. Here, we have the dubi
ous distinction of paying five times as
much as it costs UC-Berkeley, for exam
ple, to provide mail set vice to its students.
Because Stanford refuses to handle stu
dent mail, approximately 2300 students
must spend roughly $46,000 per year on
post office boxes to receive mail.
Figures obtained from Judy Miller, unit
manager of Berkeley housing Unit 1 show
that UC pays $12.50 per day for the four
hours of labor involved in sorting and de
livering mail for 1000 students in that unit.
That's about $4000 per year for six-day
a-week delivery, including summer. For
2300 students the figure would be about
$9200, or about one fifth what we are pay
ing now.
In 1973 it was estimated that individual

regulation mail boxes could be installed in
dormitories at a cost of $10 per student.
Allowing for a doubling due to inflation,
the cost today for 2300 students would be
about $46,000 — the same amount we pay
in one year to rent post office boxes.
If the University charged an additional
$3 per quarter in room rates, postal service
could be provided at a great savings to the
student and no net expense to the Univer
sity.
If our costs followed those at Berkeley,
the cost of installing the boxes ($46,000)
would be amortized after four years
($20,700 per year new receipts, minus
$9200 per year additional costs).
After four years, the University would be
making $11,500 a year from the operation.
Talking to Ron Sodlink, manager of Stan
ford's branch post office, I found out that
the Postal Service won't be sorry to lose
our business.
Even without the figures, doesn'ta land
lord (Stanford) have an obligation to pro
vide essential services to tenants? Stanford
saves money (its own — not ours), and
bother by not handling student residents'
mail. But it is shirking one of its respon
sibilities just as if it were refusing to pro
vide heat or electricity in the dorms.
If this column doesn't suffice to get the
ball rolling, students will have to use their
imaginations to overcome administrative
inertia and stop this wrongful waste of
their own money.

the Postal Service won't be sorry to lose
our business.
Even without the figures, doesn'ta land
lord (Stanford) have an obligation to pro
vide essential services to tenants? Stanford
saves money (its own — not ours), and
bother by not handling student residents'
mail. But it is shirking one of its respon
sibilities just as if it were refusing to pro
vide heat or electricity in the dorms.
If this column doesn't suffice to get the
ball rolling, students will have to use their
imaginations to overcome administrative
inertia and stop this wrongful waste of
their own money.

The 15 cent stamp stuck on a one-ounce
letter is supposed to pay for its delivery to
the addressee. If your address is Toyon,
Florence Moore, Branner, Roble, Wilbur,
Lagunita Court or Donner, however, it
doesn't.
In order to receive mail you are required
to rent a post office box for $20 per year.
Most people in this country receive their
mail free of charge — the postage affixed
by the sender pays for delivery direct to
the recipient's home.
Letters addressed to you, 2300 residents
of the above halls, carry the same amount
of postage as anyone else's. But the U.S.
Postal Service has decreed that as a resi
dent of a school or university dormitory it
is not your right to receive mail there, at
least not if the mailman has to sort it into
individual boxes.
This 1972 ruling was made in order to
help "maintain an efficient system of col
lecting, sorting, and delivery of the mail
nationwide."
The Postal Manual tells us that mail to
prisons, hospitals, hotels, and similar in
stitutions, including school dormitories,
will be delivered in bulk to the offices of
the organization. Mail is then sorted and
given to the inmates or guests by
employees of the institution.
Hospitals and prisons certainly have an
interest in handling inmates' mail, and
hotels obviously must handle mail for trans
ients. But it is not clear why students have
been included in this list (other than the
fact that the postal service saves money)..

Nine months is greater than the average
turn-over time in some apartment com
plexes, the residents of which receive
their mail individually delivered by the
postal service. The University housing sys
tem has no legal reason to monitor resi
dents' mail, nor(likely) any desire todo so.
The government of the United States,
via the Postal Service, is currently denying
equal treatment in the delivery of mails to
persons living in student dormitories.
Student status and the lack of kitchen
facilities in one's place of residence is not a
legitimate basis for discrimination in gov
ernmental services.
Students across the country are forced
to pay extra (through tuition) because
their schools incur the cost of doing the
post office's job. Here, we have the dubi
ous distinction of paying five times as
much as it costs UC-Berkeley, for exam
ple, to provide mail set vice to its students.
Because Stanford refuses to handle stu
dent mail, approximately 2300 students
must spend roughly $46,000 per year on
post office boxes to receive mail.
Figures obtained from Judy Miller, unit
manager of Berkeley housing Unit 1 show
that UC pays $12.50 per day for the four
hours of labor involved in sorting and de
livering mail for 1000 students in that unit.
That's about $4000 per year for six-day
a-week delivery, including summer. For
2300 students the figure would be about
$9200, or about one fifth what we are pay
ing now.
In 1973 it was estimated that individual

regulation mail boxes could be installed in
dormitories at a cost of $10 per student.
Allowing for a doubling due to inflation,
the cost today for 2300 students would be
about $46,000 — the same amount we pay
in one year to rent post office boxes.
If the University charged an additional
$3 per quarter in room rates, postal service
could be provided at a great savings to the
student and no net expense to the Univer
sity.
If our costs followed those at Berkeley,
the cost of installing the boxes ($46,000)
would be amortized after four years
($20,700 per year new receipts, minus
$9200 per year additional costs).
After four years, the University would be
making $11,500 a year from the operation.
Talking to Ron Sodlink, manager of Stan
ford's branch post office, I found out that
the Postal Service won't be sorry to lose
our business.
