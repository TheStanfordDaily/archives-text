## Law School admissions don't discriminate 
### 
Clarence Otis' letter (Daily,
Feb. 1) accused the Stanford
Law School of racial discrimi
nation in its admission
policies.
The specifics of his charge
are that for black students to be
admitted to the Law School
they must have high LSAT
scores and strong grades from
good undergraduate institu
tions. He also charged that
personal statements and let
ters of recommendation do not
control decisions whether or
not to admit them.
What Otis failed to mention
is that all of these things are
true of all students enrolled in
the Law School. For non
minority persons admitted to
the Law School last year, the
average LSAT scores and un
dergraduate CPAs were very
high indeed — 742 and 3.80 re
spectively.
If Otis' statement that blacks
are "the most select group at
the Law School" suggests to

readers that the Law School re
quires higher grade averages
and LSAT scores for black
applicants, that is clearly not
true.
Last year, there were 173
non-minority applicants (out of
3177 total) who had a combina
tion of LSAT scores between
650 and 699, with CPAs bet
ween 3.25 and 3.49. None were
admitted.
Otis argues that Stanford
discriminates against black
applicants by applying the
same GPA and LSAT cutoff
points to black applicants as
are applied to all other applic
ants. This, he says, discrimi
nates against blacks because
the LSAT is biased against
blacks, and because predo
minantly white schools dis
criminate against blacks in
grading.
Even if the Law School's pol
icy were to be "colorblind" in
setting LSAT and CPA cutoff
points in its admission policies,

I would be prepared to argue
that neither of Otis' statements
is true.
There is no evidence that the
LSAT is less predictive of law
school performance or profes
sional success for blacks or
other minorities. Indeed, the
slim empirical evidence we
have available suggests that the
opposite may be true with re
spect to predicted grade per
formance.
I know of no evidence that
blacks' grade averages at pre
stigous undergraduate institu
tions are deflated by grades
given by racist professors.
These arguments are, how
ever, beside the point. In fact,
the Law School has admitted
blacks and other minorities
with grades or LSAT scores, or
both, which would have prac
tically disqualified non
minority applicants.
If Otis argues that blacks
should be considered for ad
mission despite lower grades
and LSAT scores than non
minority applicants, the Law
School does that. However,
this is done not for the reasons

suggested by him.
Otis' argument is either that
the numerical "discount" is
too small, or that to base law
school admission primarily on
"numerology" is wrong. Since
I had much o the burden of
choosing which of our 3500
applicants last year were to fill
the 164 places in our first-year
class, I question Otis' argu
ment that more attention
should be paid to all applic
ants' gamesmanship in obtain
ing letters of recommendation
and writing personal state
ments.
And if the question is
whether the numerical "dis
count" for minorities is too
small, I am at a loss to under
stand how one is to arrive at the
appropriate discount for
blacks and other minorities.
I disagree that what has hap
pened is the result of racial dis
crimination. The Law School
faculty has consistently re
quired that all admissions to
the Law School be based on the
same criteria.
Stanford is an elite law
school, whose entrance re

quirements are probably
higher than all but one other
law school in the United States,
and we make no apologies for
that policy.
Otis concludes that "it's
about time that we did some
thing about" the small number
of blacks enrolled at the Law
School. Again, I agree, al
though I expect that we disag
ree about what that "some
thing" is.
The Law School could com
mit itself to adjusting the num
erical entrance criteria for
blacks and other minorities so
that a particular percentage of
minorities was admitted in the
first-year class.
The faculty has always re
jected that approach — long
before the Bakke decision
raised serious questions as to
its legality.
Another solution is to do a
better job in attracting and re
cruiting those minority applic
ants who do meet Stanford's
entrance requirements. Har
vard Law School, for example,
enrolls more than 90 percent of
the black students it admits on
criteria not substantially dis
similar to ours, while we enroll
about one-third of those we
admit.
We believe that Stanford Law
School, with its small size, ex
cellent national reputation,
strong faculty committed to
teaching and strong student
body, has real advantages
often not well-understood by
law school applicants.
We have not done all we
could do to make those advan
tages known. Last year, in
creased efforts to recruit
minority students produced
modest improvement, with the
percentage of minorities in our
first-year class rising from 7.5
to 11.6 percent. This year,
under Dean LaDoris Cordell,
we are increasing those efforts.
I invite Otis and the Stanford
Black Law Student Association
to help us.
