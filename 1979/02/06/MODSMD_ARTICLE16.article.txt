## Tuition examined 
### 
(One of several parts.)
The Little Eleven Confer
ence's Tuition, Financial Aid
and Admissions Committee
delegates are examining the
University's operating and
current policy-making pro
cedures on those subjects,
as well as soliciting student
opinion.
We are presently inves
tigating the potential for
procedural change and the
degree of student input in
policy-making review.
We are considering the
following issues in depth:
— the tuition price in
crease, what is causing it
and what the University can
do about it;
— the University's criteria
for awarding scholarships,
grants, loans and jobs;
— national issues such as
tax credit feasibility, the tui
tion advance fund proposal
and federal loan programs;
and

— how class size affects
the quality of education,
what the University's ad
missions criteria are and the
selection and orientation
process for transfer stu
dents.
At the conference, we will
evaluate viable alternative
policies and procedures
presented by other schools.
Then we will decide if the
University can benefit from
any of these.
If you have any com
ments, complaints or ques
tions, a survey will be ran
domly administered today
and tomorrow. A forum will
be held Friday, Feb. 9 at 4
p.m. in the ASSU lounge.
A comment box will also
be available in the financial
aid office. Your cooperation
and input will be greatly ap
preciated.
(Kathy Dobler is a freshman
and Cheryl Coffney is a
junior.)
