Due to an unforeseen emergency within our
typesetting operation, The Stanford Daily will be
forced immediately to tighten our deadlines sig
nificantly for the remainder of the quarter.
It is my belief that these operational changes
will not significantly affect our coverage of news
and events on campus. However, there are in
stances in which reporting of late-evening and
minor news events will be delayed in order to
make deadlines.
Moreover, community cooperation is re
quested in submission of announcements for
Once Around the Quad and Bay Area Fvents.
Absolutely no deadline extensions can be ac
cepted.
We apologize for any inconvenience this situ
ation may cause. Believe us, we like it far less
than you. But your indulgence is requested dur
ing this difficult period. You and I both look
forward to the return to normalcy at the Daily.
