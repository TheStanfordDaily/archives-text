# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Porter, et al Need responsible press

A recent editorial (Daily, )an. 25) discussed
sexism and the absence of,two Dupie cartoons
which the Daily felt certain mem
bers of the communitv.
A lot of confusing and fear-provoking rhetoric
has been thrown around about this issue lately.
As a group of those offended, we would like to
explain our position on this issue, while keeping
in mind that feminists were not the only com
munity members offended by these cartoons
and other material.
We do not advocate censorship in any form.
Anyone who has an editorial comment to make
should be allowed to do so freely.
The problem is the other forms that racist,
sexist and classist attitudes have taken. When
these attitudes appear as stated opinions, even
in cartoons, it may serve as a healthy inter
change, allowing people to confront their own
feelings and compare viewpoints presented
with their own.
However, a strong distinction must be made
between {heimplicit sexism sometimes found in
articles, ads and cartoons versus editorial com
ment. Implicit sexism or racism arises when the
values of a sexist and racist society are mirrored
in the media without challenge.
Material which presents women as submis
sive sexual objects to be had or raped — or
which presents a lazy or submissive black — is
not an editorial comment. It represents a more
insidious threat.
By merely reflecting the society's majority at
titudes, a newspaper raises those attitudes
above the status of "personal opinion" to an
acceptable definition of the society itself.

Stereotypes which are merely "slipped in," are
not challengeable.
Humor is an especially delicate issue. When a
joke is stated in one manner, the butt may be an
archaic attitude. When stated another way, the
butt of the joke may be an entire group of
people whom the author stereotypes.
Unfortunately, it takes a lot of skill and subtle
wit to be able to handle this kind of humor
correctly. If you fail, you find yourself making an
outrageously offensive, even if unintentional,
mistake.
Moreover, we must make the distinction bet
ween racist or sexist humor and humor that
stereotypes or pokes fun at "dumb athletes,"
"red-hot pre-meds" or other groups which are
not oppressed in the real world.
When dealing with the real power relation
ships between men and women, rich and poor,
majority and minority, there can be no such easy
playfulness. The author must confront his or her
own attitudes and the attitudes of society at
large. It's rarely funny to pick on people who
really are picked on.
Stereotypes must never be merely "slipped
in." Implicit sexism, racism or classism is not
excusable. We are not calling for censorship,
but responsibility.
The Daily must realize that it helps shape all
our definitions of society. And in a society which
is not "neutral," a press which passively mirrors
the majority values is not neutral either.
