## Greeting with a warning 
### 
We welcome the 30 mem
bers of the Friendship Ambas
sadors exchange program from
the Soviet Union to the Univer
sity and hope that you enjoy
your visit today.
As you tour our campus,
however, we ask you to think
of the Jews inyourcountry. We
are concerned about Soviet
lews, and we hope that you will
share our concerns and relay
them to the proper authorities
when you return to the Soviet
Union.
While you visit our educa
tional facilities, think of the re
strictive quotas placed on Jews
in your universities. Last year
not one Jew was allowed entr

ance into prestigious Moscow
State University. Jews are dis
criminated against in all as
pects of Soviet academic and
public life.
As you pass the Post Office
and notice people applying for
passports, consider the tragic
situation of the thousands of
refuseniks, denied the basic
right of emigration.
After applying for an exit
visa, Soviet Jews lose their jobs
and then live in constant fear of
being arrested for
"parisitism." If they protest the
arbitrary and illegal refusals,
they are branded "hooligans"
and thrown into prison. Last
year the number of refuseniks
was double the 1977 level.
When you pass the Law
School and see students study
ing our system of justice, re
flect on the injustice of the
Soviet court which sentenced
Anatoly Shcharansky to 13
years of harsh imprisonment.
While his wife, Avital, lives in
Israel, he suffers for his desire
to join her.
Last year over 300 Stanford
faculty, including President
Richard Lyman, sent a letter to
Secretary Leonid Brezhnev ask
ing that Shcharansky be freed.
Now we repeat that request
and ask you to take it to your
leaders.
When you see the various
ethnic and cultural organiza
tions on campus, compare
them to the denial of all Jewish
cultural expression in the
Soviet Union. Tne destruction
of Yiddish theater, the prohibi
tion of Hebrew and the
harassment of all Jewish cul
tural activity is part of a policy
of forced assimilation.
One family, Grigory and
Natalia Rosenstein ot Moscow,

is continually harassed for v
leading a seminar on Jewish
culture.
And when you pass Memo
rial Church, remember that
there are only some 60
synagogues to serve the 3 mill
ion Soviet Jews, that essential
religious items are prohibited
and that the government for
bids the training of rabbis and
other religious leaders.
While touring our libraries,
think of the vicious anti
semetic publications widely
distributed in the Soviet Un
ion.
For example, a recent book
let of hate entitled Enemies of
Peace and Progress was pub
lished last year that purports to
show the "unity of Zionists and
Nazis." The author, Lev Kor
neyev, claims that "the Zionists
acted as a fifth column for Hi
tler." One chapter is headed
"Adolph Hitler: Founder of Is
rael."
You come to us as "Ambas
sadors of Friendship." Vet the
friendship of the American and
Soviet peoples will be strained
while your government con
tinues its anti-)ewish policies.
We ask only that your govern
ment honor its constitution
and international agreements
it has signed.
Return to your homeland as
'Ambassadors of Humanity and
present to your leaders a mes
sage of concern and a demand
for action. You could not bet
ter serve the cause of interna
tional friendship.

One family, Grigory and
Natalia Rosenstein ot Moscow,

is continually harassed for v
leading a seminar on Jewish
culture.
And when you pass Memo
rial Church, remember that
there are only some 60
synagogues to serve the 3 mill
ion Soviet Jews, that essential
religious items are prohibited
and that the government for
bids the training of rabbis and
other religious leaders.
While touring our libraries,
think of the vicious anti
semetic publications widely
distributed in the Soviet Un
ion.
For example, a recent book
let of hate entitled Enemies of
Peace and Progress was pub
lished last year that purports to
show the "unity of Zionists and
Nazis." The author, Lev Kor
neyev, claims that "the Zionists
acted as a fifth column for Hi
tler." One chapter is headed
"Adolph Hitler: Founder of Is
rael."
You come to us as "Ambas
sadors of Friendship." Vet the
friendship of the American and
Soviet peoples will be strained
while your government con
tinues its anti-)ewish policies.
We ask only that your govern
ment honor its constitution
and international agreements
it has signed.
Return to your homeland as
'Ambassadors of Humanity and
present to your leaders a mes
sage of concern and a demand
for action. You could not bet
ter serve the cause of interna
tional friendship.
