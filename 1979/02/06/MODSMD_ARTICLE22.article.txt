# Intelligence standards for military set 'too high'
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Rep.
Les Aspin (D-Wisc.) said last
weekend that military ser
vices have set their intelli
gence standards so high
that "Sgt. York wouldn't be
welcome in the army any
more."
"The services ought to
consider lowering, not rais
ing, their intelligence stan
dards for recruits," the Wis
consin Democrat said in a
study.
Aspin said he strongly
opposes renewing the draft.
He said one way for the
military to avoid conscrip
tion is effective use of

people with lower intelli
gence.
Aspin said York prob
ably would be classified
today as "Category IV" in
telligence— in the lowest 10
to 30 percent of the popula
tion on intelligence tests.
Aspin said York "was gener
ally considered semi
literate and of limited intel
ligence."
Between 1974 and 1977,
Aspin said, none of the ser
vices filled the quotas they
allow themselves for Categ
ory IV people — and he said
the quotas are unrealisti
cally low.
