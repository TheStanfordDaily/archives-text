## theater/martha manqueros Contemplative, not complacent 
### 
One simply cannot sit back and complacently
enjoy The Red Snake, now playing at the Magic
Theatre in San Francisco. The violent play,
Michael McClure's latest and most realistic, re
volves around the manipulations of political,
sexual, and economic power; and the corrup
tion of those who strive for absolute control.
The two-act drama, based on James Shirley's
Elizabethan tragedy The Cardinal, attempts to
create a "world of power where no one grows
old." A ruthless Cardinal controls an immature
king, and tries to force a marriage between the
wealthy and beautiful Countess and his
nephew, General Collum, in order to gain com
plete control over their country.
The Duchess, who wants to retain her prop
erty and freedom, leads the lascivious Cardinal
on in a dangerous sexual game.
Adolescents
McClure says that his characters, at times,
"seem like adolescents with their nobility and
cruelty, exaggeration and stiffness, warmness
and sexual bravado." Their dialogue combines
formal verse with modern profanities. But, on
stage, a little profanity goes a long way. The
frequent obscenities lose their shock value early
in the play.

And, while their actions and motivations are
plausible, they lack even a adolescent's sub
tlety in trying to manipulate each other. The
audience occasionally laughed nervously at, not
with, the lines.
The director, John Lion, is faithful to
McClure's interpretation of the characters and
portrays them as stiff, exaggerated, cruel, yet
naive. He conveys their ruthless ambition and
convenient loyalties as easily as he handles the
play's many entrances and exits.
The acting, as a whole, is strong. Particularly
notable are Peter Coyote as the cruel Cardinal,
ranting about power one moment and kneeling
for prayer the next; Matthew Locricchio as the
dangerous General Collum; and John Vickeryas
the pouting king who coolly turns from the
bodies of newly murdered friends to exercise
his new power. While Howard Swain acts well as
Daly, the Countess' lover, he simply does not
look like a man for whom the countess will do
anything.
Cave-like
Very potent in imparting the feeling of
timelessness is John Wilson's cave-like set.
Neither day nor night exists in the rounded
cavern.
Thomas Mourant's lighting complements
Wilson's work. Especially effective was the
technique of lighting the set through the trans
lucent walls of the cave.
Niama Weiss' costumes, white in the first
movement of the play, then black, then red, are
striking in their simplicity of design and solid
starkness against the beige and white set.
After the play is over, one realizes that, yes,
the Magic Theatre succeeds in creating a
timelessness in their production. The characters
do not die with the applause and one leaves The
Red Snake more contemplative than compla
cent.
(Special Note: The Magic Theatre, the West
Coast's top producer of new plays, should not
be confused with the disreputable Theatre of All
Possibilities and their production of The Magi
cian.)
