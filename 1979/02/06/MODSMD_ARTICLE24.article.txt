## Kaczender: hard-selling banality 
### 
The ads for In Praise of
Older Women feature a shot
of neophyte Tom Berenger
and "older woman" Karen
Black lovingly sharing a bath
tub. Oddly enough, even
though (according to the
same ad) it "turned on mill
ions of Playboy magazine
readers in October," the bath
tub scene in the photograph
never appears in the movie.
Perhaps it is wrong to cast
doubt on the merit of a
movie by looking at its ad
copy. We could
hypothesize that the artistic
pretensions of director
George Kaczender were
rent asunder by the work of
a single, cynical advertiser.
Unfortunately, this
hypothesis turns out to be
an incorrect one: it isn't
only the ads which look as
though they're the work of
some arch-cynic. Kaczender
carries the hard-sell motif
found in the ads throughout
the entire movie.
Synopsis
The studio, Avco Em
bassy, was nice enough to
supply this description of
the plot of In Praise of Older
Women: it's a "new film
about the amorous adven
tures of a young man,
glorifying in the sexual pro
wess of mature women."
That, I suppose, is a pretty
accurate synopsis. It's an
accurate description of the
main character's experi

ences with his first older
woman. It's an accurate de
scription of his experiences
with his second, and /nis
third, and however many
women come after that.
With the narrow-

mindedness of any good
soft-core porn film, IPOOW
manages to reduce its
R-rated subject matter to ut
ter, unredeemed banality.
The main chaiacter is
played by newcomer Tom
Berenger. He is required to
age in the film from 16
(when he first meets older
woman-next-door, Karen
Black), to 28, when, he de
cides he enters middle age.
Berenger's aging is about as

believable as his acting,
which isn't.
' Sighs and groans
I'd like to see the ads In
Praise of Older Women's
casting director must have
used — they probably ran

something like, "Wanted:
virile young man who
glories in the sexual pro
wess of older women whose
skin won't peel under the
hot lights required for ex
tensive nude scenes." Be
renger also managed to
memorize an extensive re
pertoire of in-bed sighs and
groans, although, judging
from the rest of his perfor
mance, I suspect that he
might have been prompted

by cue cards.
Every film needs some
thing to give it redeeming
social value. IPOOW's at
tempt at redemption comes
through the addition of
World War II and the Hun
garian revolution to the
plot. Both wars make cameo
appearances; the Hunga
rian revolution, especially,
should win awards for the
best performance by an un
billed revolt.
The great leveler
After the wars, Berenger
moves to Montreal and be
comes a lecturer on
philosophy, allowing him to
zero in on uptight women
with an intellectual bent.
His character seems gifted
at picking up languages as
well as women, because no
mention is made of his hav
ing any difficulties in his
new country. Sex, the great
leveler, is able to level all
differences in national ori
gin in addition to class.
All intellectual delusions
aside, In Praise of Older
Women will probably be
successful because of the
unprecedented length and
duration of its sex scenes —
it's possibly the most
explicit film ever released
without an "X" rating- Avco
Embassy may well be ready
ing a sequel: but whether it
will be titled In Praise of
Even Older Women remains
to be seen.
