Khomeini names 'new' P.M.
Tehran, Iran — Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
took a fateful step in his fight for power yes
terday, naming a veteran anti-shah politician to
head a "revolutionary" regime rivaling Iran's
shaky government and warning the military
they risk God's wrath if they try to stop him.
The Moslem holy man called on the people
of Iran to obey the new "transitional govern
ment" of 70-year-old Mehdi Bazargan, which
is to pave the way for an Islamic republic. He
urged them to show their support through
peaceful marches nationwide.
Khomeini declared the U.S.-endorsed gov
ernment of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar
"must go" and that "all those who were iden
tified with this regime must go," including
Bakhtiar himself, who was appointed by Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi before the monarch
left Iran Jan. 16.
Reacting to Khomeini's challenge, the army
sent troops into the offices of government
ministries, apparently to maintain discipline
among workers and head off a possible
takeover by the rival group. For the th-rd day in
a row no political violence was reported in
Iran.
The new "prime minister," reportedly the
key intermediary in secret contacts between
the two camps, said he did not intend to try to
physically move into the Bakhtiar government
offices.
The embattled Bakhtiar told Iranian televi
sion that as long as the new "government" was
a "matter of words, it's possible."
"But if it comes to action, it's a different
thing. I will have no objection to the an
nouncement of a temporary government pro
vided this government plays the role of a
shadow government or future govern
ment . . . There is one Iran and one govern
ment," he said.
Teng calls visit successful
Seattle — China's Vice-Premier Teng Hsiao
ping concluded his visit to the United States
yesterday, calling it "smooth and successful"
and leaving behind an invitation for U.S. lead
ers to forsake detente with the Soviet Union
and join China in an informal alliance against

the Russians.
Nursing a cold and slight fever, the Chinese
leader said he is returning home "laden with
the warm sentiments of the American people."
He called "most unforgettable" the friendship
shown him in his eight-day visit.
Ambassador-designate Leonard Woodcock
told Teng: "And so has ended a historic and
very successful visit. You have brought us a
message of friendship which you have said,
and we agree, will last from generation to gen
eration. We are proud that we may have part in
the new long march to China's destiny."
Despite the euphoria, Teng's visit leaves the
Carter administration with many problems.
In Teng's repeated warnings about
hegemonism and about the Russian "polar
bear," he is asking the United States to join
China against the Soviet Union — and asking at
a time when Carter is trying to conclude the
SALT II agreement with the Soviets.
Anti-Amin sabotage in Uganda
Nairobi, Kenya — An underground Ugandan
movement opposed to President Idi Amin
claimed responsibility yesterday for sabotage
attacks that damaged a fuel depot and sharply
curtailed electricity and water supplies in the
Ugandan capital, Kampala.
A spokesman for the Save Uganda Move
ment said here that the Saturday night bomb
ing of three steel towers carrying a 132-kilowatt
power line from generators at Jinja, near Kam
pala, also cut electricity to a large part of west
ern Uganda.
The spokesman also claimed responsibility
for bombings at the French-controlled Total
Uganda Ltd. facility Saturday night.
Oil company officials reported two bombs
exploded at Total's diesel fuel storage tank and
pumps near downtown Kampala. They said the
blasts damaged a partly filled 60,000-gallon
tank and a fire that burned for two hours, offi
cials said.
The Save Uganda Movement spokesman, a
reliable source on Ugandan developments in
recent months, said the movement was a rela
tively new one formed by Ugandans living
within the country, and that it had widespread
support.
Amin aides have accused former Ugandan
President Milton Obote of sending comman

does from exile in Tanzania to assassinate
Amin. Obote has called for a general revolt
against Amin, who has survived repeated as
sassination attempts since he ousted Obote
eight years ago.
Farmers, police clash in D.C.
Washington — Thousands of farmers turned
their tractors and plowshares into weapons of
street politics yesterday, jamming capital traf
fic and triggering sporadic violence despite a
total mobilization of police.
Meanwhile, President Jimmy Carter prom
ised to do more to help farmers, but his chief
inflation fighter, Alfred kahn, said farmer de
monstrations are a waste of fuel and may
foreshadow higherfood prices forconsumers.
Kahn, who is chairman of the Council on
Wage and Price Stability, also disagreed with a
statement by Carter that farmers suffer more
than other groups from inflation.
All told, police estimated at the end of the
day, 1950 vehicles had crept into the
city in the demonstration. Police arrested at
least 19 farmers and impounded at least 17
vehicles, many of which had been abandoned
in key intersections.
Companies cut wage increases
New York — President jimmy Carter's wage
and price guidelines have caused about
three-quarters of the nation's major com
panies to cut back on wage increases from the
assembly line to the executive suite, according
to a survey released yesterday.
"The survey indicates the cutbacks are being
felt across the board in employee paychecks,
bonuses and benefit plans," said Ronald Goet
tinger, president of Sibson & Co., a Princeton,
N.J., management consulting firm that con
ducted the survey of 600 large companies.
Most of the attention given the guidelines
has dealt with their effect on blue-collar work
ers, many of whom might have to stretch a 7
percent increase to cope with 9 percent infla
tion — the rate recorded in 1978.
But increases in executive compensation
also have been reduced, the survey showed, in
part because many corporate executives feel
they are more visible and should set an exam
ple.

Moore escapes, recaptured
Alderson, W.Va. — Sara Jane Moore, who
pleaded guilty to trying to kill then-President
Gerald Ford in 1975, escaped from a
minimum-security federal prison here Mon
day night, and was recaptured about four
hours after she was discovered missing, police
said.
State police said Moore and another inmate,
who were found to be missfng during a count
of inmates conducted at about 9:20 p.m., were
taken into custody near White Sulphur
Springs, about 10 miles from the prison near
here.
Moore was serving a life sentence and would
have become eligible for parole in 1985.
