# In wake of Proposition 13
## Public colleges' future in doubt 
### Dianne Cahoon (First of a series) 
Almost one year after California
voters overwhelmingly supported a
sizeable reduction in property taxes
in the form of the now-infamous
Proposition 13, the future of state
community colleges tenuously
hangs upon the whims of an uncer
tain political-economic process.
James Fitzgerald, president of
Foothill College, a community col
lege in los Altos Hills, said that he
viewed the public's mandate as a
judgment that community colleges
were "de-servicing" or providing an
overabundance of services to soci
ety. Thus, he concluded, "as a public
servant, my job was to try to satisfy
the people's demands. Unfortu
nately, I could only guess as to what
the voters' real wishes were."
While administrators like
Fitzgerald were forced to re-evaluate
their institutions' purposes and goals
in the wake of Prop. 13, Stanford
education professor Gregory
Jackson embarked upon a study
aimed at determining the immediate
reactions of community college di
rectors to Prop. 13 and, hence, their
perceptions of its implications and of
the desires of their constituencies.
Jackson also maintained that "the
message of Prop. 13 is ambiguous,"
but ultimately attempted to assess its
impact upon the California commun
ity college system as it compares to
similar programs in other states
faced by financial crises.
Jackson's report on his research
findings, published last November,
briefly outlined the history of
California's "exceptional" commun
ity college organization.
Originating in the early part of the
20th century as high school exten
sions, these "postgraduate" divi

sions became "junior colleges," of
fering introductory, two-year college
programs.
WW II expansion
Vocational and community pro
jects were added to the schools' ac
tivities around World War II to en
compass a "concept of community
rather than junior colleges," accord
ing to Fitzgerald.
Before the public's seeming re
buke of passage of Prop. 13, commun
ity colleges in California had grown
to over 100 in number enrolling
about 72 percent of all under
graduate degree-credit college stu
dents in the state.
California's system, the largest of
its kind in the United States, was also
the only one to traditionally and leg
ally disassociate itself from tuition
charges, according to Fitzgerald.
Then, last spring, Howard Jarvis,
Paul Cann and the taxpayers of
California "sent 'em a message" and,
essentially, cut property taxes to ap
proximately 40 percent of previously
anticipated levels with inherent rigid
increase regulations.
Community colleges had up to that
point received roughly 55 percent of
their income from local tax sources
and the remainder from state appor
tionment. Proposition 13 shrunk
local revenues to 20 percent and
threw community college fiscal
prospects into limbo.
In late )une, the state legislature,
aware of the subsequent monetary
woes of public schools, enacted SB
154, a one-year "bailout" bill in
tended to furnish community col
leges with additional state funds,
contingent upon specific require
ments.
The colleges would receive $260
million from state surplus funds
provided that each college adhered

to Jarvis-Gann tax collection limita
tions and spent at least one-third of
its reserves beyond five percent of its
operating budget.
Additionally, state employees'
salaries were frozen. Meanwhile,
Jackson said that colleges were in
formed, "if you want the money, you
can't raise salaries over the govern
ment level." In this way, faculty
cost-of-living increases were suc
cessfully blocked.
Basically, community colleges
were presented with 85 to 90 percent
of their formerly expected total for
fiscal year 1979.
Jackson, in his words "curious"
about the effect on college opera
tions and the apparent rejection of
the possibility of legally-instituted
tuition fees, began interviews at six
nearby colleges of varying represen-
tation, size, age and affluence in Au
gust, when only projections were av
ailable.
Jackson had first composed four
general categories of actions that col
leges might have considered in com
bating the potential debacle created
by Prop. 13: reductions in activities,
reductions in costs, increased in
come and temporary fund re
allocation.
Assummg that "the major impetus
for IProposition 13 came from
taxpayer-clients. . Jackson specu
lated that "such a situation would
favor cost cutting." In fact, that was
the predominant process that he ob
served along with several cases of
temporary fund re-allocations
amounting to expenditure deferral
and often dangerous levels of re
serve spending.
