# No interest conflict in P.A. school issue
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Two University administrators will
not be acting in a conflict of interest
when they vote tonight on whether
to close Cubberley High School in
Palo Alto, according to an informal
opinion from a staff lawyer of the
State Fair Political Practices Commis
sion (FPPC) in a letter to Palo Alto
Unified School District officials.
The FPPC will hand down an offi
cial ruling today.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice-provost
for budget and planning and Joan
Johnston, director of alumni rela
tions at the Law School, are two of
five members of the PAUSD Board of
Trustees.
Peter Giamalis, a member of the
Cubberley High School Ad Hoc
Committee, has charged that Bac
chetti and Johnson will violate the
PAUSD conflict of interest code and
state statutes if they vote on the is
sue.
1956 transaction
Giamalis said when the University
sold a 50-acre site for Gunn High
School to PAUSD for $358,000 in
1956, the contract contained a "re
version clause" that stipulated the
land would revert to the University if
it ceased to be used for "educational
purposes."
At a Jan. 2 meeting, the PAUSD
trustees voted to close one of the
Palo Alto high schools. Giamalis said
that since the board could possibly
reject the motion tonight to close
Cubberley High School, the board
would then necessarily have to con
sider closing Gunn High School.
This predicament would place
Bacchetti and Johnston in a conflict
of interest, Giamalis said, since if
Gunn High School were closed, the
land might return to the University
under the reversion clause. Thus,
tonight's vote and the Jan. 2 vote
could "foreseeably have a material
financial effect" on the University,
he asserted.
Giamalis said that before the board
takes any other action, it should
adopt a policy stating that the land
will always be used for educational
purposes, thus precluding any rever
sion to the University. He feels this
will eliminate any conflict of interest.

However, according to Pat Ein
fault, assistant to PAUSD Superin
tendent Newman Walker, land at any
school that might be closed would
probably continue "to be used for
educational purposes.
"If the land is used for some edu
cational purpose at all, it does not go
back to Stanford,'' Einfault con
tinued. "What to do with the school
property, were we to close a school
under the clause, is a decision quite a
ways down the road."
Closing only
She said the decision slated for to
night's board meeting deals only
with the closing of Cubberley High
School, which is not covered by the
reversion clause since the University
has never owned the Cubberley site
The clause permits the PAUSD to use
the facilities for "educational pur
poses." Only if the property is aban
doned would the land revert to the
University,Einfault said.
She added that the FPPC said Bac
chetti and Johnston may vote on any
issue that does not specifically deal
with reversion of iand to the Univer
sity.
"Only if they (the PAUSD Board ol
Trustees) decided not to use the land
foranything related to the school dis
trict would there be a possible con
flict of interest. That's simply not the
case here."
The FPPC also said there would
have to be some probability of the
land reverting to the University, "not
just a slight possibility," if Bacchetti
and Johnson were to be disqualified
from voting on this issue, Einfault
said.
Today's action
Today's expected board motior
will be to accept Walker's recom
mendation to close Cubberley.
Walker has been working with Â£
superintendent's advisory commit
tee to determine which school tc
close, according to Johnston.
Declining student enrollment ir
the district and loss of funds due tc
Proposition 13 budget cuts are
frequently-cited reasons for the
necessity of closing a Palo Alto high
school.
