# KZSU needs student engineers
## 
### Gayle Ashton 
Ask them, and KZSU won't say they
lack engineers; they will only say
they would love to have more.
According to Station Manager Tom
"Tuna" Price, the station has "a lot of
potential malfunctions." Once
something breaks down, it takes too
long to get it fixed, complain prog
rammers "Hot Babe" and "Mama
Gina."
But Chief Engineer Mark Lawrence
says the student radio station's dif
ficulties boil down to "the problem
of running a volunteer operation that
requires technical help. The problem
is not severe or sudden, but
chronic."
As a Class "A" 500 watt FM station

(90.1), KZSU has many of the respon
sibilities of a professional station
without having the same kind of
staff, said Price.
The station relies on "part-timers,"
people who are marginally commit
ted and give KZSU what time they can
spare from work or school, said
Price. Any "lack of engineers" is "not
a reflection of numbers, but a func
tion of time commitments," he said.
Staff required
The station requires a minimum of
42 programmers per week, each with
a four-hour show, plus staff for the
news department, sports, public af
fairs, and the business office. The ul
timate success of the efforts of this
staff of over 200, however, finally

rests with the expertise of the en
gineers.
Price said there are about seven 01
eight engineers at KZSU now, but
only three or four are First Class en
gineers, a Federal Communications
Commission rating which allows an
engineer to work on the station's
transmitter.
He described an engineer's job as
"thankless, time-consuming and one
of little recognition. When things are
going right, nobody thinks about you
or the miracle of technology, only
when things are going wrong."
Maintenance suffers
"The station suffers now primarily
in routine maintenance," said Price.
He estimated that another five or six
competent engineers would smooth
out the current difficulties.
"There are a lot of pseudo
engineers like myself," said Price,
"who fill in as best we can."
Sounds 'crummy'
Programmers, primarily con
cerned with performance, have dis
satisfactions that stem from the
maintenance problems. Said "Mama
Gina," a Saturday afternoon D.J.
(disc jockey), "It makes the air sound
crummy if something breaks down."
A D.J. can only make minor adjust
ments, she said.
Lawrence, who first worked at
KZSU in 1963, sees the current situa
tion as part of the station's change of
character since that time.
Since the station went FM in 1964,
he said there has been little problem
getting D.J. s for prime times. But
just as other times of the day are con
sidered "less rewarding," said Lawr
ence, so is engineering.
