# University provides transport system for critically ill patients

All had gone well for the Modesto woman who
checked into Modesto City Hospital for a routine
Caesarean delivery until she suddenly began choking
after she came out of anesthesia. A blood clot in her
lung had caused respiratory arrest and heart failure. In
order to treat the woman, a new transport system from
the Stanford Hospital flew the woman to the hospital
here. She is now fully recovered.
Debbie Avrett was one of the first patients in this
new program, which utilizes ground and air ambu
lance transportation to bring critically ill patients to
Stanford Hospital, according to Dr. Jan Ehrenwerth,
associate director of the dispatch center for the sys
tem. "This is the only adult transport system of its kind
in California," Ehrenwerth said.
According to Dr. Myer Rosenthal, director of inten
sive care medical here, the new adult transport system
was created to "lessen the dangers of moving critically
ill patients."
"Stanford is more equipped to care for more types
of patients. Through this system we're reaching out
the arm of Stanford to help more people," said
Roseanne Muirhead, assistant director of nursing ser
vice at the medical center.
Not only does the system ensure the patient will
receive the best care possible, but it helps cut costs by
reducing other hospitals' need for expensive medical
technology already at Stanford, Rosenthal said.
Muirhead sees an additional benefit in that the sys
tem "gives people a choice as to what type of care"
they want to receive.
Two months old
Inaugurated two months ago, the adult transport
system evolved out of an earlier infant transport sys
tem and now moves approximately one patient a
week, Ehrenwerth said.
Basically a 24-hour answering service, the system's
dispatch center aids physicians in locating a bed for a
critically ill patient. "There's almost always a bed avail

able," Ehrenwerth said. "Finding it is the problem."
Reasons for transport range from "patients needing
care that exceeds hospital capabilities" to "doctors'
not having enough time or staff to provide the best
treatment," he said.
Wide range
The dispatch center handles calls from all of north
ern California, from Santa Barbara to the Oregon bor
der, but most patients the hospital receives through
the system are from the southern Peninsula, accord
ing to Ehrenwerth.
After a physician calls the dispatch center, he con
sults with a doctor here. If there is a "good chance the
patient can be moved safely" and that the patient will
"benefit from the move," a team is sent by air or
ground to move the patient with family and doctor
permission, according to Rosenthal.
Stanford assumes "full responsibility" for the pa
tient once they agree to the move, he said.
"We usually know about the transport one to four
hours in advance and we can get a team mobilized in
about half an hour," Muirhead said.
"Most cases are of an emergent nature," Rosenthal
added. "We try to get there as quickly as possible, but
sometimes there's an extra hour or so."
If the call is within a "75 mile radius," the team will
usually go by ground. "It's a question of distance and
speed." Rosenthal said. "When you travel by air,
there's lots of transferring that takes time.
"One ambulance takes the team to the airport. Ev
erything is transferred to the plane. Another ambu
lance meets them when they land to pick up the
patient and then it's the same process on the way
back."
The team sent out contains a minimum of two and a
maximum of four people, with at least one doctor and
a specially trained nurse.
Seen as reward
Currently there are 25 nurses trained for the teams.
Muirhead said the nurses "perceive it as a reward."

The three-day training they undergo includes "avaia
tion physiology, a review of the basic life support
systems and a ride in the airplane."
"We try to cross-train them, so they have a feel for
all areas and the use of equipment." Ehrenwerth said.
"Also they must be able to work in a small, enclosed
area."
In addition to the confines of space, the team en
counters other problems. "In an intensive care unit
most people rely on their ears," listening to the bleeps
of the equipment that monitors the patient, Ehren
werth explained. "In transfer the ears are useless"

because of the surrounding noise.
When traveling by air, the change in pressure and
oxygen must also be accounted for. Muirhead adds:
"The nurse is working in a totally foreign environment
and must be ready to improvise."
One problem that had to be overcome was the need
for effective ground-air communication. During the
flight the hospital had no way to contact the plane and
vice-versa. However the dispatch center has de
veloped a communications system that leases one of
the aeronautical channels, so they can talk directly
"with the plane from the dispatch center."
