# Sectarian 'myths' keep Ulster's schools divided

Belfast, Northern Ireland (AP) — Legisla
tion to allow Ulster's Protestant and
Catholic schools to integrate was pushed
through more than six months ago — but
little has changed in this province where
religious bigotry is at the root of bloody
sectarian feuding.
Bob Burnett, spokesman for the North
ern Ireland Education Department, re
ported that none of Ulster's 1384 junior
and high schools have yet moved to integ
rate since the new Education Act was pas
sed last June in the British Parliament.
Liberals on both sides of Northern Ire
land's religious barrier maintain the
segregation of schools has been a major
factor in perpetuating the sectarian myths
that have kept the province divided.
But fierce opposition continues from
extremists and churches, especially the
Roman Catholic hierarchy.
The British government, apparently re
luctant to do anything to heat up sectarian
tempers in the volatile province, is staying
officially neutral in the integration cam
paign. However, some officials say they

are discreetly encouraging schools to in
tegrate.
Official statistics show that 98 percent of
Protestant children and 97 percent of
Catholic youngsters attend segregated
schools.
Ulster's school system is unique in Bri
tain. Schools were segregated when the
Protestant-dominated province was par
titioned from the independent Irish Re
public in 1922.
There are no legally designated Protes
tant or Catholic schools. But virtually all
the state-run schools in the province are
controlled by governing bodies domi
nated by Protestant churchmen while the
state-aided Catholic schools are run by
priests or church nominees.
The legislation was the brainchild of All
Children Together, a pressure group of
Protestant and Catholic parents who be
lieve integrated education is crucial for
Ulster's future.
The British government, fearful of stir
ring up a hornet's nest in the turbulent
province and taking on the Catholic

church, did little to help the bill through
Parliament.
The act does not make religiously mixed
schools compulsory, but enables integra
tion to take place in schools where a
majority of parents and school governors
favor it. I
The key to the integrationists' strategy is
gaining control of school management
committees from church nominees who
have stonewalled efforts to integrate in
the past.
Church nominees control between 55
percent and 60 percent of seats on these
committees.
The integrationists admit they face a
long campaign in overcoming the cen
turies of sectarian hostility., But, said
Cecilia Linehan, a founder of All Children
Together: "The new act is a start."
Linehan, a Catholic and mother of
three children, believes integrated
schools are inevitable, despite the bitter
opposition of Catholic clergymen to relin
quishing control of church schools.
One of the most outspoken Catholic cri

tics, Canon Padraig Murphy of Belfast,
commented: "Integrated schooling
would worsen the situation here. The Pro
testant religion has suffered as a result of
handing over the responsibility of religi
ous teaching to the state. We're being in
vited to make the same mistake. But what
we need in Northern Ireland is not less
religion, but more."
Monsignor Patrick Mullally, a promi
nent Catholic educator in Belfast, de
clared hotly: "The real issues here are
housing and jobs, not schools. There's ab
solutely no evidence to support the claim
that segregated education is the cause of
the troubles in Northern Ireland."
"There's massive support among both
communities in Northern Ireland for in
tegrated education," claimed Tony
Spencer, an executive of All Children To
gether and a Catholic.
However, a study conducted a year ago
by the New University of Ulster at Col
eraine was less positive. It concluded after
checking 250 schools that the time was not
yet ripe for full integration.
