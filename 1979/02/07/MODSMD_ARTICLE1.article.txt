ASSU Special Events lost $27,000
last year but will make a profit this
year, according to project manager
Brian Becker. An all-out effort to at
tract big names to campus concerts,
as well as an internal restructuring of
the organization, have made Becker
optimistic. But some senators are
concerned about the future of Spe
cial Events.
Some ASSU projects, such as the
Lecture Notes and the T-shirt service,
are consistent money-m<jkers.
Others, such as the Sunday flicks,
fluctuate from year to year.
Ted Gardenswartz and Brett Kings
tone, senatJrs on the Senate Finance
Committee, see Special Events as an
important service that should not be
disbanded unless it is clear that stu
dents are not using it.

News analysis

"I was very disturbed to see Spe
cial Events lose $10,000 last fall, but
things look promising this quarter,"
said Kingstone.
So far this quarter, the weekly
concerts at the Encina Station have
made a profit.
"The Willie Nelson concert will be
a sbll-out," Becker affirmed. "This
year Special Events is going to make
money for ASSU."
Becker points to student involve
ment as the key to the continuation
of Special Events.
"One of the main reasons we're
here is so that students can learn
about promotion and production,"
he said.
The Special Events staff has been
expanded from three to 13 and the
project manager is now chosen in

February, giving him more time to
organize the program for the follow
ing year, according to Becker. Spe
cial Events is also relying on outside
promoters to help sponsor concerts.
The fact that Adolph Coors Co. is
sponsoring the Joe Pass concert at
the Station has caused concern
among students here, but Becker
said that the deal with Coors was
made before the recent charges
against the company were made.
"Besides, no one knows whether
they are innocent or guilty," Becker
said. "We're giving them the benefit
of the doubt until they are proven
guilty."
The question has been raised
whether Special Events should try to
compete with Bill Graham's Bay Area
monopoly, but Becker sees a clear
purpose for Special Events.
"We want to bring artists to cam
pus," said Becker. He said that the
accessibility of the performers makes
it more likely that students will at
tend the concerts and thus be intro
duced to a wider variety of music.
Becker said that the Station con
certs are comprised of 95 percent
students, and the larger concerts
draw crowds which include 10 to 25
percent Stanford students.
"It's evident that students here
need and want Special Events,"
Becker said.
Discounts which favored students
here have been dropped this year as
a means of saving money, because
the difference of one or two dollars
did not significantly affect ticket
sales, according to Becker.
"We want students getting in
volved and getting educated,"
Becker said. "My job is to see that
Special Events remains a viable stu
dent organization."
