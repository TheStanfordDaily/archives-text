# The 						hell of good intentions
## Prof chides foreign policy 
### Kathy Andrews 
"The hHI of good intentions " is perhaps a
useful way at expressing his feelings about
President Jimmy Carter's foreign polio. said
Alexander George, professor ol political sci
ence, yesterday.
Speaking before a packed room in the
Bechtel l-Center, George explained that
"Carter deserves high marks for the desirabil
ity of the goals and objectives he has set."
George said that "Whether those goals and
policies are well-chosen from the standpoint
of feasibility and then pursued effectively is
another matter."
The president brought a fresh outlook and
new enthusiasm to foreign policy al a time
when Americans were suffering Irom
psychological and political "hangovers"
from the Vietnam War. George said.
But Carter began to talk about human
rights policy before he had realised the com
plexity of the issue or incorporated it into the
rest at his policy program. Thus he embar
rassed Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and
caused a great deal of damage, George said.
Despite his amateurish start, however.
Carter's human rights program "has en
hanced Amerpca's image." according to
George.
He also commended Carter's new em
phasis on the SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty). Rather than conforming to the usual
effort to impose ceilings on arms, the presi
dent has chosen instead to emphasize actual
arms reduction. George said.
In addition, George praised Carter for de
veloping a "world order" policy with coun
tries other than the Soviet Union, such as
"unindustrialized southern countries."
Carter's new African policies also met with
George's approval. He contrasted them with
"the uncanny instinct in previous administra
tions for backing losing reactionaries."
Carter was also credited by George with a
relatively open administration and no Ameri
can military interventions.
"We seem to have given up our eltorts to
assassinate other countries' leaders,"
George added.
He likened Carter's toreign policy to "a
grab bag of individual policies" that create
problems for each other when pursued indi
vidually.
Efforts to limit prolileration of weapons

were one example of the infeasibility oi Car
ter's foreign policv cited b\ George. Such
efforts hjve contradicted U.S. ob|ec fives and
complicated relationships with Brazi
lian and |apanese allies, he said-
George also >aid that America's new rela
tionship with the less industrialized southern
countries represents another poorly
conceived policy. The economic liberalism
mindset, or the desire to change raw material
and trade transactions as little as possible in
order to retain America's advantage, have re
sulted in only "cosmetic improvements" in
transactions.
Certain aspects oi Carter's character have
influenced these policies, according to
George.
The president s human rights program re
flects his evangelical approach to policy. Asa
born-again Christian. Carter has optimism
and faith that he can accomplish much
quickly.
Carter's engineer mindset also reflects in
his policies. George continued.
"Carter seeks comprehensive solutions
and thorough-going forms. He doesn't like to
tinker with the margins of a problem,"
explained George. This attitude leads Carter
to deal with issues on their own merits with
out considering their "messy implications"
in the context ot the situation, he added.
George also called Carter "unusually intel
ligent and hard-working." As he tries to be
come the master of foreign policy questions,
he runs into the danger of overloading him
self. His ability to fulfill the "executive func
tion," or the resolution and integration of
competing interests and values, has also suf
fered, George said.
George also charged Carter with the failure
to establish good political coalitions and
comprise optimal objectives with Congress.
"The old pros in Congress say he's incom
petent and that he hasn't learned the game of
politics in Washington," said George.
Personnel problems have also hindered
Caiter's foreign policy objectives, George
continued. He called Brzezinski "an ex
tremely poor choice" for the National Sec
urity Adviser post.
"Brzezinski and Secretary of Slate Cyrus
Vance has shown poor tactics in pursuing
foreign policy goals," George said.

mindset, or the desire to change raw material
and trade transactions as little as possible in
order to retain America's advantage, have re
sulted in only "cosmetic improvements" in
transactions.
Certain aspects oi Carter's character have
influenced these policies, according to
George.
The president s human rights program re
flects his evangelical approach to policy. Asa
born-again Christian. Carter has optimism
and faith that he can accomplish much
quickly.
Carter's engineer mindset also reflects in
his policies. George continued.
"Carter seeks comprehensive solutions
and thorough-going forms. He doesn't like to
tinker with the margins of a problem,"
explained George. This attitude leads Carter
to deal with issues on their own merits with
out considering their "messy implications"
in the context ot the situation, he added.
George also called Carter "unusually intel
ligent and hard-working." As he tries to be
come the master of foreign policy questions,
he runs into the danger of overloading him
self. His ability to fulfill the "executive func
tion," or the resolution and integration of
competing interests and values, has also suf
fered, George said.
George also charged Carter with the failure
to establish good political coalitions and
comprise optimal objectives with Congress.
"The old pros in Congress say he's incom
petent and that he hasn't learned the game of
politics in Washington," said George.
Personnel problems have also hindered
Caiter's foreign policy objectives, George
continued. He called Brzezinski "an ex
tremely poor choice" for the National Sec
urity Adviser post.
"Brzezinski and Secretary of Slate Cyrus
Vance has shown poor tactics in pursuing
foreign policy goals," George said.

"The hHI of good intentions " is perhaps a
useful way at expressing his feelings about
President Jimmy Carter's foreign polio. said
Alexander George, professor ol political sci
ence, yesterday.
Speaking before a packed room in the
Bechtel l-Center, George explained that
"Carter deserves high marks for the desirabil
ity of the goals and objectives he has set."
George said that "Whether those goals and
policies are well-chosen from the standpoint
of feasibility and then pursued effectively is
another matter."
The president brought a fresh outlook and
new enthusiasm to foreign policy al a time
when Americans were suffering Irom
psychological and political "hangovers"
from the Vietnam War. George said.
But Carter began to talk about human
rights policy before he had realised the com
plexity of the issue or incorporated it into the
rest at his policy program. Thus he embar
rassed Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and
caused a great deal of damage, George said.
Despite his amateurish start, however.
Carter's human rights program "has en
hanced Amerpca's image." according to
George.
He also commended Carter's new em
phasis on the SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty). Rather than conforming to the usual
effort to impose ceilings on arms, the presi
dent has chosen instead to emphasize actual
arms reduction. George said.
In addition, George praised Carter for de
veloping a "world order" policy with coun
tries other than the Soviet Union, such as
"unindustrialized southern countries."
Carter's new African policies also met with
George's approval. He contrasted them with
"the uncanny instinct in previous administra
tions for backing losing reactionaries."
Carter was also credited by George with a
relatively open administration and no Ameri
can military interventions.
"We seem to have given up our eltorts to
assassinate other countries' leaders,"
George added.
He likened Carter's toreign policy to "a
grab bag of individual policies" that create
problems for each other when pursued indi
vidually.
Efforts to limit prolileration of weapons

were one example of the infeasibility oi Car
ter's foreign policv cited b\ George. Such
efforts hjve contradicted U.S. ob|ec fives and
complicated relationships with Brazi
lian and |apanese allies, he said-
George also >aid that America's new rela
tionship with the less industrialized southern
countries represents another poorly
conceived policy. The economic liberalism
mindset, or the desire to change raw material
and trade transactions as little as possible in
order to retain America's advantage, have re
sulted in only "cosmetic improvements" in
transactions.
