## Freshman here appears on 'Jeopardy' 
### Andrea James 
"Fors2oo the answer is: 'This
college is known as the Har
vard of the West or The Farm.'
Peter?"
Smiling, the University
freshman looks at the televi
sion camera. "If I don't get this
one, my friends will kill me.
The question is, 'What is Stan
ford?"'
"Correct," says emcee Art
Fleming, and Peter Laugharn
has won another $200 on the
television game show,
Jeopardy.
Laugharn's three-day ap
pearance on the NBC program
last week earned him $3325
pi us $200 in consolation prizes.
"Assuming the IRS and fi
nancial aids don't take too
much of it, I want to use the
money to go to Florence next
fall and winter and then stop
out for spring," Laugharn said.
Enticed by ad
The Southern California na
tive was led to the NBC studios

over Christmas break by an ad
in the Los Angeles Times.
"The ad was asking for con
testants on a television game
show so I went to the corpora
tion offices in Los Angeles,"
Laugharn recalled. "There
were about JO other people try
ing out."
For the first elimination pro
cess, the 30 candidates were
asked 36 general trivia ques
tions ranging from capital cities
to literature.
First elimination
"If you get a certain percen
tage right, like 30 out of 36 you
come back a second day for a
run-through of the game
show," Laugharn explained.
"They want to see how you
react under pressure, how
sharp you are."
Laugharn's trial runs were
successful. In mid-|anuary,
producers called him and
asked him to return for the
filming.
"They said they'd be taping
for three weeks but they didn't
say when I'd be on or even if I'd
be chosen to play," Laugharn
said. "NBC makes the final de
cisions."
Nevertheless, Laugharn
skipped a day of classes and
went to Los Angeles on Friday,
)an. 26. He was one of the first
to play.
Different clothes
"They film five games in one
day," Laugharn said. "I had to

bring five sets of clothes be
cause they don't want it to ap
pear like you've worn the same
clothes five days in a row."
Laugharn proceeded to win
both the first and second sets
of games but "miserably lost
the third" to a student from
UCLA, he said.
leopardy is divided into
three ten-minute segments. In
the first segment, three contes
tants answer general trivia
questions worth $10 to $100. In
the second round, the two
top-winning players compete
again to answer $20 to $200
questions. Th£ final winner
goes on to play "Bonus
leopardy." Here, the player
must answer five questions in
order to win $10,000.
No bonuses
"I didn't win either of the
bonuses," Laugharn said. "I
got three questions the first
time but none the second
time." He was eliminated from
the first round in the third
game.
"I was in the hole at the end
of the first round," he said.
"There were so many ques
tions I didn't know that I
panicked at the end. It was
maddening because as I
watched the second round, I
knew there were a lot of ques
tions there I could answer. The
ones I missed I'm never likely
to forget." *
One question really

bothered him. "I couldn't be
lieve I missed a question on
Captain Kangaroo," he said.
Several dorm friends from
Junipero piled into one room
to watch Laugharn's perfor
mance last Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday. It was em
barrassing every time I was on
because I knew when I was
going to miss one," he said.
"Most of the people were in
their 20s or iOs, but producers
encouraged me to get Stanford
students on the show,"
Laugharn said. "It was a lot of
fun. And yes, Art Fleming does
smile, even off camera."
