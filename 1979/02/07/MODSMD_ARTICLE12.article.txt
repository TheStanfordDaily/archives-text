# 'Smart product' serves meal in style
## 
### Pete Van Sickel 
Imagine a machine that will understand,
"I'll have a martini straight up with an olive"
and then serve you the drink along with
hors d'oeuvres. This situation is close to
reality for mechanical engineering stu
dents who have programmed a voice
controlled manipulator to "serve a meal in
style" and compete in an automated
cake-baking contest.
These students are enrolled in Assoc.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Larry
Leifer's Smart Product Design course.
Both the course and the specialized
laboratory used in the class were designed
by Leifer two years ago.
"Smart products" use a microproces
sor, a miniaturized computer, in a way that
allows the product to interact with a
human or perform a sophisticated control
function. Common examples of smart
products include the timing systems in
microwave c/ens, automobile ignition
control systenis, and the myriad of elec
tronic video ga Ties in amusement centers.
The laboratc 7 is equipped with three
computer systems used by students to de
sign their projects. "These three systems
are general purpose machines that the
student programs to emulate the special
purpose machine he wants to design,"
Leifer explained. A fourth system can be
tied into any of the other three systems
and used for prototype development.
Leifer said that once the project has
reached the point where it needs to be
tested and debugged, "the student can
cable this machine directly into the other
machine and use it to analyze the prob
lems in his design."
Human interaction
Because much of the design work in
volves computer programming and circuit
development, the course appears to be
more computer science or electrical en
gineering than mechanical engineering.
"The electrical engineer might want to
build a better computer; the computer
scientist is interested in writing better
programs, but we're interested in making
better use of the computer in products

more directly associated with human in
teraction," Leifer said.
"The thing that is exciting to the
mechanical engineer about designs using
microprocessors is the computer adds life
to the design." He said that instead of
building things that either function or
don't function, now the engineer can de
sign a device that can interrogate the user
for further instructions or inform the user
as to why it can't perform a desired task.
Leifer said he is interestd in developing
devices to assist handicapped people. A
project now being developed in the lab by
Jim Sachs, a graduate student, is the
voice-controlled manipulator for persons
who have lost use of their hands. The man
ipulator is a microprocessor-controlled
device that has some of the basic
capabilities of a human arm and hand.

better use of the computer in
products more directly as

The manipulator's movement is deter
mined by voice commands spoken into a
microphone tied to a "voice recognition
unit." While the manipulator may not re
spond to "bake me a cake," it does have
the capability to recognize 44 different
commands like, "move up," "move left"
and "grasp."
The acceptance of the manipulator by
handicapped people is now being
evaluated by behavioral scientists at Boys
Town Center. Sachs stressed the impor
tantce of "designing something around
the needs and likes of the people who will
use it. For example maybe they don't like
the command vocabulary or the type of
tasks the manipulator is able to do. We use
their evaluations to design something that

will be accepted."
Work is continuing on enhancing the
manipulator design with a "smart hand"
being developed by Rickson Sun, another
graduate student. The hand will have a
sense of touch using small sensitive
switches that measure pressure. It will
have the capability to "see" using ultra
sonic sound wave reflections from objects
when they are in the way of the man
ipulator movements.
Life support system
A project designed and built in the
laboratory last year was a life support sys
tem for animal brain tissue. This device
will be used in Medical School lab re
search. A microprocessor controls a
mechanical system used for precise regu
lation of nutrient flow, temperature, and
any experimental conditions in the brain
tissue environment the researcher is in
terested in studying.
Leifer said the projects this quarter in
clude a parts recognition system for au
tomatically sorting different parts as they
come off a conveyor belt and an algorithm
for following a line drawn on a piece of
paper, remembering the line, and redraw
ing it.
The course in smart product design was
first offered last winter qyifclter, Leifer
said,"Even with my
ment and warnings to the students that it
was a totally new course, 27 of them stayed
on. We had some problems and our Tau
Beta Pi course evaluation ratings were the
lowest for any course given that year.
"But we received a lot of suggestions for
improvement from the students and a lot
of encouragement to give the course
again," Leifer said. "This term we're offer
ing the course and 50 students are enrol
led."
Leifer continued that "anyone planning
to take the course should expect to en
counter some rough edges and creative
disorder as we explore and develop our
skills in microprocessor based product
design."
