## Jay Roach Peer advising advocated 
### 
From Richard Armour's Going
Around in Academic Circles:
Student: I'm thinking of
ma/oring in English.
Adviser: Fine.
Student: Or maybe History.
Adviser: History's a good sub
ject too.
Student: My mother thinks I
should major in Art.
Adviser: An excellent idea.
Student: But my father says
Econ would be more practi
cal.
Adviser: Of course.
Student: Then there's Political
Science.
Adviser: Yes, there is.
Student: And Religion, Com
parative Literature and
Philosophy.
Adviser: Quite true.
Student: I appreciate your
helping my clarify my think
ing.
Adviser: Don't mention it.
It's my job. Drop in again in a
few months, when I get back
from Pakistan.
The importance of first-year
academic advising is not over
stated. For an entering student
confronted with decisions as
formidable as choosing a major
and thinking about careers., or
with problems as intimidating
as grade competition, course
shopping or exam preparation,
an unadvised first year can be
pretty traumatic.
Obviously, that does not
mean an advised freshman
year is a piece of problem-free
cake, but well-advised deci
sions do tend to make
academia a little more palata
ble.
This column is about a new
opportunity for current
sophomore and juniors; one
that will enable them to make
real contributions to improv
ing undergraduate education
for next fall's entering
freshmen.
"Is there anything wrong
with the current faculty advis
ing system?" you may query. If
you were assigned a good fa

culty adviser (and there are a
number of them), you are
probably convinced that sound
counseling from a professional
academician has really contri
buted to your "educational ex
perience."
On the other hand, if you
went through freshman year
gaining little more than one
home-cooked meal and three
signatures on study lists from a
busy faculty adviser (there are
some of these, too), you may
claim he or she just wasn't
necessary.
Regardless of the final evalu
ation of the University's advis
ing system, any net improve
ment can't hurt, and one im
portant improvement is on its
way. It's based on a new twist
of the old concept of peer ad
vising, and revolves around the
idea that no matter how helpful
a faculty adviser is, the lessons
of two or three years of a stu
dent's experience with Univer
sity procedures, offices,
policies, faculty and staff can
provide a very valuable
supplementary souce of ad
vice.
Take that experienced stu
dent, team him or her with a
seasoned faculty member who
has similar academic interests
and assign them to a group of
entering freshmen and the
new formula spits out a better
first-year "Stanford experi
ence."
Does it work in real life?
"Yes," says I, as a current advis
ing associate (AA or peer ad
viser) in Trancos' experimental
program, which was designed
according to this formula, in
itiated by students last spring
and backed by the University
for this year.
I work with an adviser who is
in the Office of Development
in Encina Hall, and we were as
signed ten social-science
oriented trosh. We meet with
the advisees each week at din
ner and at other informal
gatherings. We also meet with
them individually for extended

times during registration.
Working as a team, Mason
Blacher (the faculty/staff ad
viser) and I keep in close con
tact. Our advisees usually use
both advising sources, since
we offer different types of in
formation and sometimes di
verging opinions. Together, he
and I have been able to keep
our group meetings fast-paced
and interesting (and hopefully,
of course, intellectually pro
vocative). If one of us can't
make a meeting, the other is
always available. Our advisees
attend meetings faithfully; and
utilize the resources we pro
vide.
The result? Well, it's difficult
to make an objective evalua
tion. One unambiguous indi
cator is the active participation
of the members of the advising
group. When a student comes
to us with a thick quagmire of a
problem, asking for informa
tion to help sort it out, and
then leaves with the basis for a
solution, we are inclined to be
tieve that we have been help
ful.
So what? The poipt is, the
advising associate concept has
worked forothersuch "teams"
as well. The pilot program in
Trancos, consisting of ten ad
vising teams, has proven valu
able enough that the Univer
sity is expanding it to include
three more all-frosh dorms
next year. That is a significant
development.
Forty advising associate posi
tions are now available for next
year to current sophomores
and juniors of any major. To
apply, pick up an application/
information sheet in the
Academic Information Center
soon (deadline is Feb. 14). This
program offers a genuine op
portunity to share what you
know now about Stanford
academic circles with entering
students.
