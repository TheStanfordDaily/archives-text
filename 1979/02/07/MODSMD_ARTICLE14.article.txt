## Judicial criteria needed for FS 
### 
The Fundamental Standard
(FS) has set the standard of
conduct at the University since
1906, and over that time some
inconsistent patterns of penal
ties have developed through
the precedents set by the judi
cial system here.
Two examples might be use
ful to illustrate the unevenness.
A male student assaulted a
female student for a prolonged
period of time in her room, and
received nothing but a sus
pended two-quarter suspen
sion. Another student was
fined and suspended for mis
using a mealcard, and not re
porting an administrative error
that allowed him an "A" (more
extensive) meal plan when he
had only paid for a "B" plan.
My reaction to the penalties
in these (and some other) cases
is that, relative to one another,
the penalties imposed were in
appropriate. Put another way:
my personal sense of fairness
says that the student guilty of

assault should have received a
harsher penalty than the
meal card fiend.
It would be nice if the FS
gave some clear indication of
how seriously various offenses
should be considered, but as it
does not, we are left to infer
some sort of criterion. If one
were able to develop such a
criterion, one could use it as a
yardstick to rank infractions,
and allot fairer penalties. A
criterion might be found in the
FS itself if one could distill its
raison d'etre as a document.
Different people have differ
ing perceptions of the main
point of the FS. I have heard
several rationales put forward
for the FS, including
1) Ignore the future likelihood
hold the qualities of good citi
zenship, and to uphold the
values of the community one
lives in.
2) To guarantee a minimum
moral character of graduates
here.

3) To punish wrong-doers as
it is a moral imperative to
punish those who infringe on
others' rights.
4) To deter others from ac
tions not considered desirable
by the community.
5) To attract attention to dis
tressed behavior in order to
allow targeting of counseling
and help.
6) To serve a police function
tailored to the special needs of
campus living. For instance,
petty thefts or invasions of pri
vacy in a dormitory may be
very disturbing, yet could not
be effectively dealt with by
normal police coverage. How
ever, it might be controlled
more easily through University
intervention. Also under this
particular rationale I would in
clude the Honor Code (which I
view as a specialized clarifica
tion of the FS) and thus add rules
specific to the University's
purpose, such as rules pertain
ing to cheating on examina
tions.
As the above list makes clear,
there is not a highly coherent
consensus concerning the
purpose of the FS. This is not
necessarily bad, as the compo
site quilt of FS precepts have
given the FS more comprehen
siveness and flexibility. Unfor
tunately, these several pre
cepts are not helpful in estab
lishing a ranking of seriousness
of infractions, as they are
either uninformative or mutu
ally contradictory.
To give an incomplete and
simple-minded (for space
reasons) illustration of the latter
problem: Suppose that some
one cheats on an exam. If one's
goal were to help the student,
one might not punish him at
all, assuming that the embar
rassment would prevent future
temptation. If one wished to
deter others from committing
the same offense, one would
punish and publicize the act.
Other goals would demand a
wide range of different reme
dial actions.
Unfortunately, similar con
tradictions appear in synthesiz
ing judgments out of the rather
varied list of criteria mentioned
above. Thus, at first glance,
there does not appear to be an
obvious primary criterion to be
derived from the FS to be used

as a yardstick to minimize the
unevenness of dealing with FS
violations. This, in turn, leaves
us with three options:
1) Ignore the future likelihood
of unfair and inconsistent
judgments and continue with
the present system.
2) Refine one of the above
criteria and use it as a primary
yardstick of severity of viola
tions, in conjunction with the
three existing criteria of de
termining how severe a penalty
is appropriate.
3) Attempt to shape a single
new criterion.
In conclusion, I would like to
make a proposal — largely for
the sake of discussion. I be
lieve the FS to be humanist in
nature, and therefore believe a
humanist approach approp
riate. I suggest that the mea
sure of an offense be the de
gree of human discomfort and
suffering it creates.
What this means, in practice,
is that assaults, for example,
shall be considered the most
serious offense, followed by
intimidation, cheating, disor
der and so on. This represents
a significant change, but it
must not be exaggerated. For
instance, cheating — as the
"theft" of a high grade from a
fellow student — remains seri
ous. Integrated into the exist
ing criteria, I think this
yardstick should serve to im
prove the campus judicial sys
tem.
