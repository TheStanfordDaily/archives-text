## Sociobiologists going too far 
### 
The question of what is
human nature has been consi
dered by philosophers from
Rousseau to Hobbes.
The importance of innate,
inherited characteristics was
assumed by Plato in construct
ing his Republic and permeate
our own culture, in the form of
aphorisms and assumptions:
"He comes from good stock"
or "Those people breed like
flies."
This is obviously an impor
tant and fertile field for scien
tific investigation but, histori
cally, science has often been
used to support existing pre
judices and the social status
quo in this area of thought.
The scientific measurement
of skulls of different geog
raphical groups in the 1800s
confirmed the mental and
moral superiority of Northern
European whites. Social Dar
winists at the turn of the cen
tury, supported by much of the
scientific establishment, jus
tified the existing social in
equalities k»y, "proving" them
to be biologically inevitable.
In the first decades of this

century, the increased under
standing of the genetic inheri
tance of traits was used by
many prominant scientists to
promote racial segregation and
even gradual genocide of "in
ferior" ethnic groups.
True, not all scientists held
such views, and, in fact, sci
ence has contributed to er
adicating many of the simplis
tic and inhumane views of
human nature. But this exam
ple of science's role in support
ing vested interests is too easily
forgotten and is certainly not
unique.
Within the past few years,
another, more sophisticated
scientific approach to under
standing human nature has
been advanced — sociobiol
ogy. While sociobiology must
be understood and evaluated
on its scientific merit, its social
and political origins and con
sequences must be under
stood as well.
Sociobiologists believe that
patterns of social behavior can
be viewed as genetically inher
ited. Such an approach has in
deed been useful in identify
ing, and to some extent exp
laining, certain behavioral pat
terns in animals and insects.
Recently, however,
sociobiology has turned its at
tention to explaining human
behavior and social institu
tions. The claims of its propo
nents have been far-ranging.
Generally, sociobiologists
base their claims of a strong
genetic basis for a particular
human behavior on threg
points: the similarities bet
ween the human behavior and
the behavior of other animals,
the universality of the behavior
throughout human societies
and the existenceofa plausible
explanation for the behavior's
evolutionary adaptiveness.
Thus the greater frequency
of, and less severe punish
ments for, sexual infidelity in
males than in females is
explained by E.O. Wilson, the
leading figure in sociobiology,

as being genetically based.
Similarly, Wilson sees a
strong genetic tendency to
"solve conflict through aggres
sion." Genetic explanations
have been offered for
xenophobia, male dominance,
spite and a long list of other
characteristics as well.
According to sociobiology,
altruism is impossible, except
in a few deviant cases, and all
apparently altruistic acts can
only be motivated by an intent
to further one's relatives, with
whom one shares similar gene
tic traits.
Morality, Wilson claims, is
genetically based and "has no
other demonstrable function"
* than to keep "human genetic
material...intact."
Critics of sociobiology, my
self included, believe that such
claims have little scientific
value. Plausible, if sometimes
convoluted, stories of
evolutionary adaptiveness can
be constructed for any human
behavior. Truly universal
human traits are scarce and
widespread human behaviors
can beexplained by similarities
in the human condition with
out assuming a specific genetic
base.
Moreover, sociobiological
claims are vague — genes only
determine "tendencies." Their
expression in individuals is al
lowed to vary greatly, depend
ing on the environment, and
genes for a particular behavior
may be found in some un
specified proportion of the
individuals in a population. Even
temporary exceptions to the
expected behaviors are al
lowed.
Finally, there is no evidence
for one gene or specific group
of genes causing a particular,
normal human behavior, and
quantitative predictions about
the incidence of genetically
based human behavior is not
possible.
The idea that individual be
havior is the result of some
kind of genetic predisposition

reacting to and being changed
by the environment is widely
accepted. But I believe that
sociobiology's claims about
the strength and specificity of
this genetic basis for human
social behavior are unwar
ranted.
In effect, sociobiology can
explain virtually any observed
human behavior, has virtually
no predictive power and, by
the nature of its claims, cannot
be disproved.
Therefore it proves nothing.
Sociobiology does, how
ever, have one broad message
of great importance: existing
human behavior and institu
tions are on a genetic leash, to
quote Wilson, and cannot stray
too far from the limitations set
by the genes.
Such a "scientific" view of
human nature has obvious sor
cial and political implications,
For example, an article in Busi l
ness Week last year used
sociobiological claims to de
monstrate that socialism i$
"doomed to failure" because
human selfishness is genetic
and therefore unchangeable.
Whether consciously or nof,
sociobiology is saying that it is
not possible to create a stable
society based on such ideals as
justice, genuine mutual caring
and cooperativity. Existing
problems lie not within a
changeable society, but within
our much less changeable
genes.
I don't believe this to be
true. But sociobiologist Robert
Trivers can explain my disbe
lief as well. Trivers claims that
our belief in moral ideals and
our self deceit about our true
selfish motivations are them
selves adaptive behaviors.
Therefore, critics of
sociobiology have a genetic
predisposition to reject the
truth of sociobiology.
It's all in our genes, so why
fight it?
