# Kessler and Wilkins
## Avoiding extermination 
### 
A lot has been written lately
about sexism. And Iran. And
abortion. And Israel. And Ali
Bhutto. And griffins. And
Alber's Wall.
As a matter of fact, a lot has
been written about a lot of
things these days. And that's
good.
But there is one subject that
hasn't been getting a lot of at
tention lately. A subject that is
so shocking, so outrageous,
that most people dare not
think about it — much less
admit that the topic exists.
The subject is the secret ex
termination of students here.
Fact: One-quarter of the un
dergraduate population disap
pears each year, never to be
seen again. Granted, every few
years one of the many missing
shows up at the Big Game
wearing an oversized,red bow
tie, muttering "Give em the
axe, the axe, the axe."
Where have all these stu
dents gone? And how can we,
today, avoid falling victim to
the same fate?
It's not easy. The forces that
would have today's Stanford
student out on the streets,
looking for positiorls of re
sponsibility, are the same ones
that would have us walking
around with draft cards in our
hip pockets, given the chance.
FHere, then, is a set of
guidelines to keep you safe

from the throes of the real
world. It will guarantee you
permanent access to the Roble
Tennis Courts, DeGuerre Pool
and Racquetball Club, as well
as other luxuries here at "The
Farm."
Don't let those units pile up.
Nothing puts a crimp in a long
college career like graduation.
If suddenly the number 180
appears on the bottom of your
transcript, buddy, you're out
on the street, a walking statis
tic.
— Stop out — a lot.
— Delay matriculating as
long as possible. Since your
parents probably don't know
what's really going on "out
there" (less than 5 percent
ask to see the check stubs), you
don't have to enroll.
Take the tuition money and
leave it with a smart investment
banker. In the mean time, you
can live in the Tresidder lounge
or with the roof people at
Synergy. Before long, you'll
have enough money to go to
school for eight years. And
isn't that what you wanted in
the first place?
— Keep deferring your tui
tion. If you don't want the un
its, don't pay for them. There's
nothing that the Registrar s Of
fice likes less than a large, out
standing account.
And if they threaten to keep
you here until you pay, you

know you're doing something
right. Pay only when
threatened with expulsion,
and even then pay only as
much as vou have to.
— If you have paid, get sick
and try for a refund.
— Don't let any dean get to
know you by your first name.
After eight or nine years, they
might catch on to your little
game.
— In the same vein, it is wisej
to switch dorms every few*
years. The worst thing that you
can do is become a fixture. If
you live in the trailers, don't
worry. You could stay there
forever, and no one would
ever come look for vou.
— Audit, audit, audit!
— Don't declare a major.
They can't give you a degree in
a field that you know nothing
about. (It's the law.)
— Don't petition to
graduate. If you do, you're just
asking for trouble.
Sounds easy? Vou bet. If you!
follow these simple steps, you
won't ever have to worry about'
finding a job, buying "ties that
match," or determining whose
turn it is to make club
sandwiches for the bridge
game.

about. (It's the law.)

A lot has been written lately
about sexism. And Iran. And
abortion. And Israel. And Ali
Bhutto. And griffins. And
Alber's Wall.
As a matter of fact, a lot has
been written about a lot of
things these days. And that's
good.
But there is one subject that
hasn't been getting a lot of at
tention lately. A subject that is
so shocking, so outrageous,
that most people dare not
think about it — much less
admit that the topic exists.
The subject is the secret ex
termination of students here.
Fact: One-quarter of the un
dergraduate population disap
pears each year, never to be
seen again. Granted, every few
years one of the many missing
shows up at the Big Game
wearing an oversized,red bow
tie, muttering "Give em the
axe, the axe, the axe."
Where have all these stu
dents gone? And how can we,
today, avoid falling victim to
the same fate?
It's not easy. The forces that
would have today's Stanford
student out on the streets,
looking for positiorls of re
sponsibility, are the same ones
that would have us walking
around with draft cards in our
hip pockets, given the chance.
FHere, then, is a set of
guidelines to keep you safe

from the throes of the real
world. It will guarantee you
permanent access to the Roble
Tennis Courts, DeGuerre Pool
and Racquetball Club, as well
as other luxuries here at "The
Farm."
Don't let those units pile up.
Nothing puts a crimp in a long
college career like graduation.
If suddenly the number 180
appears on the bottom of your
transcript, buddy, you're out
on the street, a walking statis
tic.
— Stop out — a lot.
— Delay matriculating as
long as possible. Since your
parents probably don't know
what's really going on "out
there" (less than 5 percent
ask to see the check stubs), you
don't have to enroll.
Take the tuition money and
leave it with a smart investment
banker. In the mean time, you
can live in the Tresidder lounge
or with the roof people at
Synergy. Before long, you'll
have enough money to go to
school for eight years. And
isn't that what you wanted in
the first place?
— Keep deferring your tui
tion. If you don't want the un
its, don't pay for them. There's
nothing that the Registrar s Of
fice likes less than a large, out
standing account.
And if they threaten to keep
you here until you pay, you

know you're doing something
right. Pay only when
threatened with expulsion,
and even then pay only as
much as vou have to.
— If you have paid, get sick
and try for a refund.
— Don't let any dean get to
know you by your first name.
After eight or nine years, they
might catch on to your little
game.
— In the same vein, it is wisej
to switch dorms every few*
years. The worst thing that you
can do is become a fixture. If
you live in the trailers, don't
worry. You could stay there
forever, and no one would
ever come look for vou.
— Audit, audit, audit!
— Don't declare a major.
They can't give you a degree in
a field that you know nothing
about. (It's the law.)
— Don't petition to
graduate. If you do, you're just
asking for trouble.
Sounds easy? Vou bet. If you!
follow these simple steps, you
won't ever have to worry about'
finding a job, buying "ties that
match," or determining whose
turn it is to make club
sandwiches for the bridge
game.
