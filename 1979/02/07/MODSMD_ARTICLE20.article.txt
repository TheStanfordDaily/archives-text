# Codiroli, Cards win, 11-5
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Cardinal nine added
another victory to their pre
season totals yesterday after
noon when they beat the San
Jose Spartans 11-5 at San Jose.
After the first four games of
1979, Stanford remains unde
feated.
]ohn Pyle, senior slugger for
the Cards, turned in another
awesome performance at the
plate in the game. Coming off a
strong opening weekend, Pyle
boosted his stats with five
more RBIs from a two-run single
in the first inning and a three
run triple in the second.
"He's amazing," was the
comment from Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess when
asked about Pyle's perfor
mance. "With two swings of
the bat, he had collected five
RBIs . . . and both times there
were two men out."
In the second inning, after
Stanford was ahead 2-0, Pyle
led a four run attack that
finished the Spartan's starting
pitcher, freshman Mark
Langston.
With two men down and
Mike Codiroli on first,
shortstop Dave Meier reached
first on an error made by the
San lose third baseman. Larry
Reynolds then loaded the
bases with an infield single.
That set the stage for Pyle's
triple to right center.
Paul Zuvella knocked in the
fourth run of the inning with an
infield hit, before the Cardinals
made their third out.

Codiroli, who went two-for
three on the day and stole two
bases, was also the winning
pitcher for Stanford. The left
hander, who usually covers
centerfield, got the nod from
Marquess, and saw his first
start since high school pitching
days.
Marquess said, "We had ex
perimented with him
(Codiroli) in the fall, and we
thought he deserved a start. He
pitched well," said Marquess,
"we'll pitch him again."
According to Marquess,
Codiroli may pitch throughout
the year — including some
league games.
"We haven't ruled out that
possibility (a league start for
Codiroli)," said Marquess. "If
he continues to pitch well and
the other starters are having
whiffed three batters.
Codiroli gave up only one hit
in his four inning stint, and he
wiffed three batters.
Rob Irwin, who relieved
Codiroli in the fifth, also had a
good day on the mound. And
freshman side-armer Mike Sul
livan, though a little erratic,
was tagged with only two
earned itjns in his late-inning
appearance.
The team travels to Hayward
today for a single game with
Cal State-Hayward beginning
at 2:30 p.m.

pitcher for Stanford. The left
hander, who usually covers
centerfield, got the nod from
Marquess, and saw his first
start since high school pitching
days.
Marquess said, "We had ex
perimented with him
(Codiroli) in the fall, and we
thought he deserved a start. He
pitched well," said Marquess,
"we'll pitch him again."
According to Marquess,
Codiroli may pitch throughout
the year — including some
league games.
"We haven't ruled out that
possibility (a league start for
Codiroli)," said Marquess. "If
he continues to pitch well and
the other starters are having
whiffed three batters.
Codiroli gave up only one hit
in his four inning stint, and he
wiffed three batters.
Rob Irwin, who relieved
Codiroli in the fifth, also had a
good day on the mound. And
freshman side-armer Mike Sul
livan, though a little erratic,
was tagged with only two
earned itjns in his late-inning
appearance.
The team travels to Hayward
today for a single game with
Cal State-Hayward beginning
at 2:30 p.m.

HIGH-SCORING guard Angio Paccione (5) rises for a layin during Stanford's 8()-(>1 loss to USF |an. 9.
Paccione, who led the Cardinals with Ib points in that game, is averaging 12.5 points a game for coach
Dotty McCrea's ! !>-.} cagers. Tonight the Cards will try to avenge the USF defeat as they square off
against the Dons in San Francisco at 8 p.m.


YESTERDAY WAS a complete day for senior slugger Mike Codiroli,
shown here takinganother powerful cut. In the Cards' 11-5 trouncing
of San )ose State, Codiroli collected two hits, two stolen bases and
allowed just one hit in four innings while pk king up the win in his first
start on the mound since high school.
The Cardinal nine added
another victory to their pre
season totals yesterday after
noon when they beat the San
Jose Spartans 11-5 at San Jose.
After the first four games of
1979, Stanford remains unde
feated.
]ohn Pyle, senior slugger for
the Cards, turned in another
awesome performance at the
plate in the game. Coming off a
strong opening weekend, Pyle
boosted his stats with five
more RBIs from a two-run single
in the first inning and a three
run triple in the second.
"He's amazing," was the
comment from Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess when
asked about Pyle's perfor
mance. "With two swings of
the bat, he had collected five
RBIs . . . and both times there
were two men out."
In the second inning, after
Stanford was ahead 2-0, Pyle
led a four run attack that
finished the Spartan's starting
pitcher, freshman Mark
Langston.
With two men down and
Mike Codiroli on first,
shortstop Dave Meier reached
first on an error made by the
San lose third baseman. Larry
Reynolds then loaded the
bases with an infield single.
That set the stage for Pyle's
triple to right center.
Paul Zuvella knocked in the
fourth run of the inning with an
infield hit, before the Cardinals
made their third out.

Codiroli, who went two-for
three on the day and stole two
bases, was also the winning
pitcher for Stanford. The left
