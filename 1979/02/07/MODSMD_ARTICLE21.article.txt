# Bodybuilders find discipline in sport
## 
### Julie Hill 
Body-building, one of the
most misunderstood sports in
this country, has attracted the
interests of two talented men
on campus, junior Paul Butler
and freshman )ohn Carroll. Bu
tler recently won the Mr. Bay
Area Novice title, while Carroll
is currently Mr. Teenage West
Coast and was No. 6 in the last
Mr. Teenage U.S.A. contest.
Butler, who started lifting in
high school to get an injured
knee back into shape, trained
only a year before he won last
month's contest. The stocky
communications major treats
the sport of body-building with
insight and depth. He calls it a
"powerful sport that should be
performed with grace and
drama.
"Those who know how make
it beautiful; the others make it
look stupid," Butler said.
"Body-building is like a
sub-culture in America.
There's a decided split bet
ween those who think it's ter
rible and those who think it's
great," Butler said.
Both Butler and Carroll agree
that many people don't under

stand the sport because
they've never seen a contest.
They're also concerned with
the stereotyped image of
body-builders which comes
through in the conversation of
their peers.
Carroll said, "People are
stuck on stereotypes." He
thinks it's "fun just compet
ing" and isn't out for the
macho reputation. One of the
reasons Carroll likes the sport
so much is because it's easy to
see the results of his efforts
quickly.
One of the psychological as
pects of body-building is that
"it trains you to discipline
yourself," Butler said. "That
carries over into my studies.
My grades actually picked up
remarkably."
Now in a revolutionary train
ing process which emphasizes
intensity, Butler added, "You
can't have a bad day in the
weight room. The main barrier
is in your mind. You have to go
through that pain barrier, too.''
"Actually," he said, "you
have to love pain."
Both Butler and Carroll may
have a few mental hurdles to
get over on their way to win
ning additional body-building
titles, but their relatively quick
successes so far indicate a real
aptitude for tacking on many
more titles in the tuture.
