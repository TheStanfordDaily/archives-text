### 
Ray Handley, a Stanford football veteran, was named
linebackercoach here by now head coach Rod Dowhower Feb. 2.
Handley replaces Norb Hecker, who resigned last week to join
former head coach Bill Walsh with the San Francisco 49ers.
Handley presently holds the distinction of being the second
leading rusher in Stanford football history. He rushed for 1768
yards during his career here from 1961-1965, and he gained 916
yards in 1965. Both of these totals stood as school records until
today's football star, Darrin Nelson, broke the season record in
1977 with 1069 yards and shattered the career record in 1978 with
1061 more yards for a total of 2130.
At 14 years of age, Handley has a long list of coaching creden
tials. He was assistant coach at West Point in 1968 and 1969, and
returned to Stanford from 1971-1973 to assume the position of
assistant coach here. He then coached at Reed High School in
Sparks, Nevada for four years. Last year Handley returned to
coaching collegiate football as offensive backs coach at the Air
Force Academy.
Dowhower said that Handley would be responsible tor un
specified administrative duties as well as coaching the Cardinal
linebackers.
"We're very happy to have him because of his coaching and
recruiting abilities, as well as his familiarity with the University
he added.
