the best teams have risen to the
top-
In the A-league race,, top
ranked FACE has looked espe
cially impressive, winning its
first three games by a total on
237-79. Last quarter, FACE won
the }-on-J basketball crown
and it seems well on its way to
the playolts in live-man. Trving
to prevent FACE trom attaining
this lirst-ever "double cham
pionship are some perennial
hoop powers.
Loss Causation runner-up a
year ago, is undefeated also. It
is expected to keep its untar
nished record intact since ot
met and defeated perhaps its
toughest opponents in the
early weeks ol the season.
Both the Bootables and the
Theta Delts are rich in talent,
bul neither has been able to
put it all together...vet. Bv the
season's end, both will be
ready and seeded highly in the
final plavotfs.
Strong challenges should be
mounted by Madera. Kappa

tauten on lean Humes out are
well on the road to recovery
and will be a team: to watch.

a lot better than manv -V-league
teams and mav stay unchal
lenged throughout the re
mainder of the regular sea

But come playoff time, there
tigure to be manv teams in Ihe
running. The third-ranked
club, the Ghetto, is really
strong. OTWG and the Ghetto
faced each other in last quar
ters B-league football finals.
Such a match-up in basketball
this quarter would indeed
prove interesting.
Ranked fourth and filth,
Pbred's Faces and Phi Delt I
have played good basketball to
date. Rounding out the top ten
are the Woosies, the Asbury

In the A-league race,, top
ranked FACE has looked espe
cially impressive, winning its
first three games by a total on
237-79. Last quarter, FACE won
the }-on-J basketball crown
and it seems well on its way to
the playolts in live-man. Trving
to prevent FACE trom attaining
this lirst-ever "double cham
pionship are some perennial
hoop powers.
Loss Causation runner-up a
year ago, is undefeated also. It
is expected to keep its untar
nished record intact since ot
met and defeated perhaps its
toughest opponents in the
early weeks ol the season.
Both the Bootables and the
Theta Delts are rich in talent,

season's end, both will be
ready and seeded highly in the
final plavotfs.
Strong challenges should be

tauten on lean Humes out are
well on the road to recovery
and will be a team: to watch.

But come playoff time, there
tigure to be manv teams in Ihe
running. The third-ranked
club, the Ghetto, is really
strong. OTWG and the Ghetto
faced each other in last quar
ters B-league football finals.
Such a match-up in basketball
this quarter would indeed
prove interesting.
Ranked fourth and filth,
Pbred's Faces and Phi Delt I
