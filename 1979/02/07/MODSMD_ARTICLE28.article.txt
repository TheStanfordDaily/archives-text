### Mollie McDonald 
This year's class of University
freshmen is politically more conser
vative than last year's, according to a
recently released survey.
Nearly 1000 of the 1600 freshmen
here participated in the survey,
which is part of an institutional re
search program conducted jointly by
the American Council on Education
and UCLA.
In describing their political orien
tation, more respondents were in
clined to say they were "middle of
the road" or "conservative" than in
last year's survey. The tendency of
the freshman class toward conser
vatism is not surprising, according to
John Voelcker, former president of
the Conservative Student Union.
"Most students at Stanford tend to
be classically conservative. Perhaps
this is part of a reaction to the student
apathy of the 19705," said Voelcker.
However, the survey also found
that "self-described" liberals remain
far more prevalent in the freshman
class than in the average national
freshman class.
The survey also revealed an in
creased interest in the "Creek sys
tem." Nearly one-third of ihe par
ticipants said they thought the
chances were very good that they
would join a fraternity or a sorority,
compared to only one in four last
year. Three out of four felt strongly
that their university residences
should reflect a "diversity of student
interests, values, backgrounds and
lifestyles."
More than half of the freshman
class views coming here as an oppor
tunity to "turn over a new leaf and
become a different person." Nearly
95 percent plan to seek out experi
ences that will expose them to cul
tures and lifestyles different from
their own. In fact, asked what
reasons were important in going to
college, freshmen most frequently
cited the opportunities "to learn
more about things, to gain general
education, and to meet new and in
teresting people."
Almost half of the freshmen enrol
ling here reported that they had been
accepted by three or more other in

stitutions; 90 percent of the class
chose Stanford because of its "good
academic reputation." More
freshmen plan to obtain advanced
degrees than last year, with more
hoping to earn a masters degree.
More than half the participants
said their fathers had earned ad
vanced degrees and 18 percent re
ported that their mothers had done
so.
Well over 90 percent of the
freshmen expect that "a Stanford
undergraduate education will pre
pare me for a satisfying job after
graduation." However, only 45 per
cent listed making more money as a
very important reason for going to
college.
The most frequently mentioned
career goals were medicine, en
gineering, law and business.
The majority believe that they can
combine marriage and a career in
their adult lives, with women feeling
more strongly about this than men.
When asked what objectives they
considered "essential or very impor
tant in later life," three-fourths of the
participants mentioned "developing
a philosophy of life" and "becoming
an authority in my field," while ap
proximately 50 percent said "helping
others in difficulty," "keeping up
with political affairs," and "raising a
family."
Two-thirds of the freshman class
believe that the quality of life experi
enced by most Americans will im
prove during their lifetime.
