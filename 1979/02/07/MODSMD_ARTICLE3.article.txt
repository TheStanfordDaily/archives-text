# Community college budgets may escape cuts
## 
### Dianne Cahoon (Second of a series) 
Last August, Education Prof. Gregory Jackson
undertook an investigation of six local but diverse
community colleges to ascertain the immediate
reactions of the California community college sys
tem to Proposition 13. From that basis, heanalyzed
the eventual long-range prospects for California's
community colleges under a prolonged property
tax reduction.
Jackson said that his project was "very explorat
ory in nature" because college administrators had
begun to project policies created by the new fi
nancial constraints thrust upon them by Prop. 13
and the state legislature's ensuing "bailout bill",
SB 154, when his researchers commenced inter
views last summer.
Since programs were in the formative stage,
Jackson's assistants presented the following gen
eral query to college decision makers: "What do
your cutbacks look like, and what will you be do
ing?"
This year, Jackson said he discovered that the
state surplus funding, combined with extensive
reserve spending by the individual colleges, left
most college budgetary levels relatively un
changed from the previous year's marks. He
further noted that colleges received more tax in
come than had been earlier predicted. Therefore,
colleges, on the average, possessed 85 to 90 per
cent of the funds that they had expected before
the enactment of Prop. 13, Jackson said.
Foothill College President James Fitzgerald ex
pressed this dilemma succinctly. "If we get 85 per
cent of our funds from the state, we'll have 85
percent control," he said.
Cost cutting
Jackson said he found that colleges resorted
almost solely to cost-cutting methods to cope with
the diminished monetary supply. "Surprisingly,"

he said, "most of these cuts were marginal."
For the most part, cost trimming involved the
reduction of part-time faculty, the elimination of
certain summer and weekend services, the deple
tion of excess supplies and equipment, the cancel
lation of some community projects, and the an
nulment of superfluous class meetings. Fringe be
nefits, such as telephone conveniences and travel
excursions, were curtailed.
InTiis survey, Jackson argued that these incre
mental responses indicated educators' reluctance
to modify long-term plans in the aftermath of
Prop. 13. Administrators assumed that the state
would not allow community colleges to perma
nently struggle under harsh fiscal limitations.
Current operations
"Rather than ask what sort of institution best fills
the need for community college education under
the constraints of Prop. 13, the colleges in the
sample appear to have asked what changes Prop.
13 required in their current operations," )ackson
theorized.
Jackson acknowledged the fact that the current
California Education Code forbids the adoption of
tuition charges by community colleges for accre
dited courses. However, he said that he was star
tled that "no one's talking about tuition," which
he recommended as a feasible legal alteration to
provide colleges with a vital increase in income.
Tuition, "perhaps the most feared consequence
of Prop. 13," could symbolize a slamming of the
"open door" principle that public education is for
whoever wishes it, Jackson said.
Defer expenditures
Jackson's final observation was one which he
viewed with alarm: The tendency for colleges to
defer expenditures and eradicate reserves.
"Upon reflection, such actions are not surpris
ing; they may represent the easiest way for ad

ministrators tixbuy time before making difficult
decisions," ht\aid.
Unfortunately, deferral of outlays for mainte
nance and legal compliance merely produces the
illusion of a balanced budget. At the same time, it
substantially augments subsequertt budgets with
necessary expenditures, which will then be com
pounded by inflation.
Construction postponed
lackson gave an example of one college that had
postponed the construction of women's locker
room, which had been court-ordered in accor
dance with the provisions of Title IX. The building
must be erected at a later date, when such action
will be undoubtedly more expensive.
lackson admitted that he must now direct his
attention to unavoidable physical plant repairs be
cause Foothill's former concentration on staff be
nefits at the expense of maintenance was "not
responsible" and unrealistic.
After comparing California community college
reactions to Prop. 13 with similar actions in other
state educational systems, lackson reasoned that
"Prop. 13 has moved California community col
leges somewhat closer to their counterparts in
other states, by reducing dependence on the
property tax and increasing dependence on the
state."
Jackson concluded that "community colleges
have a substantial future in California. But they are
moving into a new stage in their development, one
in which the state will assume a new predominant
role and students will eventually pay directly for
services."
Overall, the flexibility of community colleges
will be dimished, but Jackson assessed the impact
of Prop. 1J on the "exemplary role" of the Califor
nia community college system as ultimately mod
est in scope.

Construction postponed
lackson gave an example of one college that had
postponed the construction of women's locker
room, which had been court-ordered in accor
dance with the provisions of Title IX. The building
must be erected at a later date, when such action
will be undoubtedly more expensive.
lackson admitted that he must now direct his
attention to unavoidable physical plant repairs be
cause Foothill's former concentration on staff be
nefits at the expense of maintenance was "not
responsible" and unrealistic.
After comparing California community college
reactions to Prop. 13 with similar actions in other
state educational systems, lackson reasoned that
"Prop. 13 has moved California community col
leges somewhat closer to their counterparts in
other states, by reducing dependence on the
property tax and increasing dependence on the
state."
Jackson concluded that "community colleges
have a substantial future in California. But they are
moving into a new stage in their development, one
in which the state will assume a new predominant
role and students will eventually pay directly for
services."
Overall, the flexibility of community colleges
will be dimished, but Jackson assessed the impact
of Prop. 1J on the "exemplary role" of the Califor
nia community college system as ultimately mod
est in scope.
Last August, Education Prof. Gregory Jackson
undertook an investigation of six local but diverse
community colleges to ascertain the immediate
reactions of the California community college sys
tem to Proposition 13. From that basis, heanalyzed
the eventual long-range prospects for California's
community colleges under a prolonged property
tax reduction.
Jackson said that his project was "very explorat
ory in nature" because college administrators had
begun to project policies created by the new fi
nancial constraints thrust upon them by Prop. 13
and the state legislature's ensuing "bailout bill",
SB 154, when his researchers commenced inter
views last summer.
Since programs were in the formative stage,
Jackson's assistants presented the following gen
eral query to college decision makers: "What do
your cutbacks look like, and what will you be do
ing?"
This year, Jackson said he discovered that the
state surplus funding, combined with extensive
reserve spending by the individual colleges, left
most college budgetary levels relatively un
changed from the previous year's marks. He
further noted that colleges received more tax in
come than had been earlier predicted. Therefore,
colleges, on the average, possessed 85 to 90 per
cent of the funds that they had expected before
the enactment of Prop. 13, Jackson said.
Foothill College President James Fitzgerald ex
pressed this dilemma succinctly. "If we get 85 per
cent of our funds from the state, we'll have 85
percent control," he said.
Cost cutting
Jackson said he found that colleges resorted
almost solely to cost-cutting methods to cope with
the diminished monetary supply. "Surprisingly,"

he said, "most of these cuts were marginal."
For the most part, cost trimming involved the
reduction of part-time faculty, the elimination of
certain summer and weekend services, the deple
tion of excess supplies and equipment, the cancel
lation of some community projects, and the an
nulment of superfluous class meetings. Fringe be
nefits, such as telephone conveniences and travel
excursions, were curtailed.
InTiis survey, Jackson argued that these incre
mental responses indicated educators' reluctance
to modify long-term plans in the aftermath of
Prop. 13. Administrators assumed that the state
would not allow community colleges to perma
nently struggle under harsh fiscal limitations.
Current operations
"Rather than ask what sort of institution best fills
the need for community college education under
the constraints of Prop. 13, the colleges in the
sample appear to have asked what changes Prop.
13 required in their current operations," )ackson
theorized.
Jackson acknowledged the fact that the current
California Education Code forbids the adoption of
tuition charges by community colleges for accre
dited courses. However, he said that he was star
tled that "no one's talking about tuition," which
he recommended as a feasible legal alteration to
provide colleges with a vital increase in income.
Tuition, "perhaps the most feared consequence
of Prop. 13," could symbolize a slamming of the
"open door" principle that public education is for
whoever wishes it, Jackson said.
Defer expenditures
Jackson's final observation was one which he
viewed with alarm: The tendency for colleges to
defer expenditures and eradicate reserves.
"Upon reflection, such actions are not surpris
ing; they may represent the easiest way for ad

ministrators tixbuy time before making difficult
decisions," ht\aid.
Unfortunately, deferral of outlays for mainte
nance and legal compliance merely produces the
illusion of a balanced budget. At the same time, it
substantially augments subsequertt budgets with
necessary expenditures, which will then be com
pounded by inflation.
