Planes, copters fly over Tehran
Tehran, Iran — Waves of jet fighters and helicopters
flew in tight formation over Tehran yesterday in a new
show of government force as supporters of a rival gov
ernment named by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
marched through the city.
The thousands of demonstrators supporting Kho
meini defiantly wavedtheirfistsattheaircraft,shouting
"Allah Akbbar" (Cod is great).
The flyover punctuated the resolve of Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar to stay in power until elections can be
held.
A top aide to Khomeini claimed the threat of a military
coup had passed and that the ayatollah now has some
military support. But he hinted broadly that more vio
lence is likely before Iran's crisis eases.
The aide, Dr. Ibrahim Yazdi, formerly of Houston,
Texas, said many elements of Iran's 430,000-man army
had swung over to Mehdi Bazargan, Khomeini's choice
as prime minister of a provisional revolutionary gov
ernment.
Police limit farmers' demonstrations
Washington — Militant farmers vowed a return to the
streets but most managed to drive in nothing but circles
yesterday as Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland assailed
their demonstration as "an unmitigated disaster."
The farmers were in Washington to demand higher
farm prices.
Police kept hundreds of tractors and other farm vehi
cles penned on the Mall, the usually lush grounds bet
ween the Capitol and Lincolr Memorial.
There was some rock-throwing at police cars and
slashing of tires while other demonstrators took out
their frustrations by setting one tractor ablaze, driving
another into the reflecting pool and furiously churning
up the earth with others.
At midafternoon, authorities did allow 200 tractors out
of the encirclement for a brief, tightly escorted swing
around the White House and back — before the evening
rush hour — as a "triai run" of whether any further
caravans might be allowed.
Agents seize $6.7 million in PCP
San Jose — Seven persons were arrested and PCP —
Angel Dust — with a street value of $6.7 million was
seized at Santa Cruz, Calif, and Bend, Ore. yesterday by
local, state and federal officials.
Agents confiscated upwards of 50 pounds of the drug
in finished and intermediate stages, laboratory equip
ment, four vehicles and six weapons at a remote cabin
six to eight miles from Bend where five of the persons
were taken into custody.
The breakup of the operation — said to be a major
supplier of PCP in the San Francisco Bay area — was
announced by officials from San Jose and the federal
government.

Loans to spur urban investment
Washington — The nation's largest single supplier of
home mortgage tunds said yesterday it will more than
triple its urban loan program to spur investments in
inner cities.
The Federal National Mortgage Association decision
to increase its participation in the loan program by $500
million was made public by Vice President Walter Mon
dale, who called it a "significant...new initiative."
It could make $1.4 billion available for loans to purch
ase or rehabilitate houses and commercial property in
rundown urban settings, without touching government
funds.
Under the program, the federally chartered, privately
owned corporation purchases from commercial lenders
— generally savings and loans associations and banks —
from 60 percent to 90 percent of a pool of housing
mortgages.
The original holder of the mortgage must agree to
reinvest the money it receives from the corporation in
inner city property.
Kahn defends Carter inflation plan
Washington — The Carter administration defended its
right to punish companies which violate voluntary price
and wage guidelines established in the anti-inflation bat
tle.
Questions about enforcing President Jimmv Carter's
anti-inflation program were raised anew as Alfred Kahn,
his chief inflation adviser, disclosed that more than 200
of the Fortune 500 companies — the nation's largest —
have promised compliance with the price standards.
Kahn, chairman of the Council on Wage and Price
Stability, also said that most recently negotiated major
labor contracts have been well within the 7 percent wage
guideline.
Four companies, however, are asking for exceptions
to the guidelines, said lack Triplett, the council's assis
tant director for price monitoring.
Stocks drop slightly
New York — The stock market declined slightly in
subdued trading yesterday, still showing the effects of
uneasiness over inflation and the energy outlook.
The Dow Jones average of JO industrials slipped 1.13 to
822.85, extending its loss since the start of last week to
36.90 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slowed to
23.57 million shares from 26.49 million Monday.

cept low clouds or patchy dense fog nights and morn
ings. Lows in upper 30s and 40s. Highs in upper 50s to

Kahn defends Carter inflation plan
Washington — The Carter administration defended its
right to punish companies which violate voluntary price
and wage guidelines established in the anti-inflation bat
tle.
Questions about enforcing President Jimmv Carter's
anti-inflation program were raised anew as Alfred Kahn,
his chief inflation adviser, disclosed that more than 200
of the Fortune 500 companies — the nation's largest —
have promised compliance with the price standards.
Kahn, chairman of the Council on Wage and Price
Stability, also said that most recently negotiated major
labor contracts have been well within the 7 percent wage
guideline.
Four companies, however, are asking for exceptions
to the guidelines, said lack Triplett, the council's assis
tant director for price monitoring.

Planes, copters fly over Tehran
Tehran, Iran — Waves of jet fighters and helicopters
flew in tight formation over Tehran yesterday in a new
show of government force as supporters of a rival gov
ernment named by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
marched through the city.
The thousands of demonstrators supporting Kho
meini defiantly wavedtheirfistsattheaircraft,shouting
"Allah Akbbar" (Cod is great).
The flyover punctuated the resolve of Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar to stay in power until elections can be
held.
A top aide to Khomeini claimed the threat of a military
coup had passed and that the ayatollah now has some
military support. But he hinted broadly that more vio
lence is likely before Iran's crisis eases.
The aide, Dr. Ibrahim Yazdi, formerly of Houston,
Texas, said many elements of Iran's 430,000-man army
had swung over to Mehdi Bazargan, Khomeini's choice
as prime minister of a provisional revolutionary gov
ernment.
Police limit farmers' demonstrations
Washington — Militant farmers vowed a return to the
streets but most managed to drive in nothing but circles
yesterday as Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland assailed
their demonstration as "an unmitigated disaster."
The farmers were in Washington to demand higher
farm prices.
Police kept hundreds of tractors and other farm vehi
cles penned on the Mall, the usually lush grounds bet
ween the Capitol and Lincolr Memorial.
There was some rock-throwing at police cars and
slashing of tires while other demonstrators took out
their frustrations by setting one tractor ablaze, driving
another into the reflecting pool and furiously churning
up the earth with others.
At midafternoon, authorities did allow 200 tractors out
of the encirclement for a brief, tightly escorted swing
around the White House and back — before the evening
rush hour — as a "triai run" of whether any further
caravans might be allowed.
Agents seize $6.7 million in PCP
San Jose — Seven persons were arrested and PCP —
Angel Dust — with a street value of $6.7 million was
seized at Santa Cruz, Calif, and Bend, Ore. yesterday by
local, state and federal officials.
Agents confiscated upwards of 50 pounds of the drug
in finished and intermediate stages, laboratory equip
ment, four vehicles and six weapons at a remote cabin
six to eight miles from Bend where five of the persons

supplier of PCP in the San Francisco Bay area — was
announced by officials from San Jose and the federal
government.

Loans to spur urban investment
Washington — The nation's largest single supplier of
home mortgage tunds said yesterday it will more than
triple its urban loan program to spur investments in
inner cities.
The Federal National Mortgage Association decision
to increase its participation in the loan program by $500
million was made public by Vice President Walter Mon
dale, who called it a "significant...new initiative."
It could make $1.4 billion available for loans to purch
ase or rehabilitate houses and commercial property in
rundown urban settings, without touching government
funds.
Under the program, the federally chartered, privately
owned corporation purchases from commercial lenders
— generally savings and loans associations and banks —
from 60 percent to 90 percent of a pool of housing
mortgages.
The original holder of the mortgage must agree to
reinvest the money it receives from the corporation in
inner city property.
