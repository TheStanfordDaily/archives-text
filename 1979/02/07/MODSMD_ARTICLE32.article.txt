## Photo Dept.: accent on creativity 
### 
Stepping into the darkroom
of the photography lab, I
strained my eyes to make out
the vague forms of the enlar
gers. The smell of chemicals,
the red lights and the sporadic
flashes of light were puzzling
and slightly alarming. Some
where in the hodgepodge of
this dark, acrid 20-toot by 10-
foot lab, I was supposed to
create an image that was
locked inside my camera and
my head.
The technical side of photo
graphy is the first element that
the Basic Photo student learns.
From developing film to print
ing finished images, I fumbled
and splashed my way to crea
tive expression...or at least
something totally different and
new. Photography demanded

time, hours and hours of even
ings and mornings working
with the same image.
Printing and printing again,
changing exposure time and
light, waiting as the trickle of
water into the washing basin
kept up a continual noise. Until
finally the right image began to
emerge, slowly, from
nowhere, the image that I had
seen days or weeks or years be
fore.
Making students comforta
ble with the technical side of
photography is one of the
goals of introductory photo
classes here, according to
Senior Lecturer in photography
Leo Holub and Lecturer Robert
Parker.
On any given afternoon,
you'll find Parker or Holub

sprawled on a collection of
threadbare but comfortable
antique chairs and benches in a
room adjacent to the photo
lab, talking animatedly with
their students.
"What it comes down to is
trying to get the student past
that feeling of intimidation
with the technical aspect and
getthem to realizethattheyare
working with art," states
Parker, 30, completing his
eighth and final year of teach
ing here.
Holub wants his students to
get the most possible out of the
film and paper, but more im
portantly, "we want the stu
dents to be uniquely them
selves," he says. Holub, 62,
who first came to Stanford in
1960, plans to retire in another

three years.
During the past eight years,
Holub and Parker have worked
together to create a photo
graphy program which in
cludes classes that range from
Basic Art 70 to Photo Silksc
reening and a new course this
year, Non-Silver Processes.
They have also been the
team responsible for the
friendly, supportive atmos
phere of the lab and the de
partment.
' "There is a nice interaction
in Photo Lab...a reciprocal
sharing of ideas without the
competition and rivalry of
some of the other depart
ments," said Marilyn Scoutten,
an anthropology major with an
emphasis in photography.
Suzy Hagey, one of seven Art

majors with an emphasis in
photography, agrees. "There is
an inviting atmosphere,
friendly, at ease," she says.
Holub and Parker both share
the same committment to their
students. "There is a really de
licate balance as a University
teacher involved in art. That is
being able to give your stu
dents enough so that you're
not aloof. It means not giving
so much that you go home un
able to pick up a camera or de
velop a print of vnur own."
explained Parker.
Parker is presently putting
together a show of his work for
this Spring. Scoutten is also
working on a collection of her
prints for a Coffee House
exhibit, at the same time. "I

find myself spending more
time in the photo lab than is
healthy to my academic pur
suits," she said.
Scoutten, a senior is in
terested in documentary
photography, "situations that
vou totally pre-visualize using
models." She takes one idea
and explores it."I want people
to takean interest in what I take
and how I do it," she said.
In an attempt to explain why
she creates, Scoutten said that
humans need to create a part of
themselves outside of their li
mited environment in order to
show other people and them
selves who they are.
Hagey sees the creative im
pulse as something inside of
her "that needs to be expres
sed." She finds working in the
darkroom a relaxing change of
pace from classes and tennis.
"I put a lot of pressure on
myself on the courts to go, go,
go," said the two-time NCAA
doubk tennis champion.
"Working with photography, I
get to explore and do what I
want.
"Ideally, I would like to
travel on the professional ten
nis circuit all over the world
with my camera."
Both Scoutten and Hagey

agree that there is a connection
between sports and art. "I
came to Stanford as a
springboard diver but because
of the time commitment I had
to give it up. My interest in
photograhy was revitalized be
cause I needed another crea
tive and expressive outlet,"
Scoutten said.
Hagey sees a parallel bet
ween the individualism of
sports such as tennis and div
ing and the isolation of the ar
tist.
But at the same time that the
artist needs isolation to create
they also need an audience,
according to Scoutten. "Both
diving and photography re
quire a personal intimate in
volvment. Both require an au
dience for approval and also
for criticism. Feedback for
what I do helps me better un
derstand myself," said Scout
ten.
Reaction is also an important
element to Parker. "The way
people react to it (the photo)
determines whether or not it is
art. It you can elicit an emo
tional response, if you can get
people to think about the
image for as long as the time it
took to complete the image —
you have succeeded in creat
ing art."
