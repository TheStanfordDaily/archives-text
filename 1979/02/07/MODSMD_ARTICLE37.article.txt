If you would like to "get into
the dark," you might want to
know more about the Stanford
Photography Club, a group of
students interested in keeping
a darkroom available to the
Stanford community 24 hours a
day.

The club maintains an air
conditioned darkroom in the
basement of Wilbur Hall with
five enlargers capable of handl
ing negatives up to a four inch
by five inch format. There is
also a separate film-processing
area with a loading booth. For

the more ambitious photo
grapher there are color
facilities including a dichroic
colorhead enlarger.
Former club members who
are now professional photo
graphers return to teach be
ginning and intermediate clas
ses in both black and white and
color techniques. These clas
ses are open to club members
who pay the $16 quarterly
membership fee.
Quarterly dues entitle each
member to up to 24 hours of
darkroom access each quarter
and all chemicals necessary for
standard film and print proces
sing. New members pay an ad
ditional $10 equipment fee,
and those using the color
facilities pay an additional $20
the first quarter and $5 per
quarter thereafter. Members
are also entitled to purchase
supplies through the club at
significant savings.
In addition to the use of the
darkroom and photo classes,
the club sponsors activities in
cluding field trips, exhibits and
public photography programs.
Recently activities have in
cluded visits to the homes of
noted photographers Ansel
Adams and Morley Baer; ex
cursions to Point Lobos' Wes
ton Beach and the fishing port
at Moss Landing for photo tak
ing; a slide lecture by camera
repairman Art Hall entitled,
"How To Keep Your Camera
Out of the Repair Shop;" and
an exhibition of club members'
work at the Coffee House here.
Last May the club invited
famous color photographer
Ernst Haas for a week of lec
tures and presentations. A
matching grant from the Na
tional Endowment for the Arts
"Visual Arts' Photographers in
Residence" program made this
event possible.
Expansion of the club's
facilities is in the offing for the
near future. Planned im
provements include a
classroom/darkroom, an ad
vanced colcfr lab with wheel
chair accessibility, and sheet
film facilities.
The photo club is open to
Stanford staff and students.
Those interested in the club
may visit the darkroom at Wil
bur during business hours
Thursdays between 4 and 5
p.m. or attend the spring quar
ter membership meeting to be
held in Arroyo dining hall Apr.
4.
(Peter Axelson is Ihe presi4l
dent of the Photography Club
and presently has two exhibi
tions at the Coffee House
through March 3 called "Rudi
ments of Expression" and "Ex
pressions of Love.")
