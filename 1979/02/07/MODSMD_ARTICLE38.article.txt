## Criticism of photography as fine art 
### 
When two different people
step back to examine a paint
ing, a piece of sculpture or a
poem, their opinions as to the
merits of the piece may clash
violently. One may consider it
a work of art, and the other
may consider it trash, but both
have common critical stan
dards with which they can jus
tify their claims.
Not so, however, when it
comes to photography. While
cameras have been in exis
tence for 160 years, it is only
during the last two decades
that photography has become
accepted as a fine art form. Lit
tle has been done in the field of
criticism. People simply do not
know how to judge a good
image from a bad one.
This is the problem being
tackled by Ted Hedgepath and
Michael Beard, who are pre
sently teaching a SCIRE course
dealing expressly with the con
cept of the criticism of photo
graphy as fine art.
The project, which includes
lectures and fieldtrips to Bay
Area photo exhibitions, will
culminate this spring when the
students will use their know
ledge to judge prints in a show
which will be presented in the
Coffee House here. Approxi
mately 24 colleges within a
100-mile radius of the Univer
sity will be participating in the
show.
The student initiated project
grew out of an Undergraduate
Special, "Photography in
P-int" taught by Beard and
Hedgepath last fall quarter.
Both feel very good about
the students who are involved
in the project. Only half of the
students are actual photo
graphy buffs. Beard says there
are plenty of engineers and
biology majors who are just
"very interested" in photo
graphy.
Beard and Hedgepath pur
sue a critical appioach to
photography on two levels.
Beard, who is a professional
photographer, looks at the ar
tistic side, at how photography
actually works as an art.
Hedgepath, whose
background is in English and
critical writing, applies his ex
perience in literature to create
a dialogue for critiquing
photography.
"Photography is the art
medium of the twentieth cen
tury," says Beard, "but there's
nothing in writing on how it
works. People don't know
what's good and bad, and this
includes curators and photo
graphers. Photography is so
real that it is taken as a docu
ment of an event or a place but
art is a fiction. To them the
camera is merely a tool to make
the image."
According to Beard, there
have been only two major pub
lications that have dealt with
photography as a tine art: the
out-of-print Camera Work by
Alfred SteiglifV", pubfKhed in

1910, and the 1954 work Aper
ture by Minor White.
It was with this fact in mind
that Beard and Hedgepath
began publishing Latent Image
last May, a journal composed
entirely of critical articles on
photography as fine art.
The two artists are also cur
rently working on a joint exhib
ition entitled "Trip: A Postcard

Novel," a photographic record
in color of a roundtrip the two
men made to Vancouver,
Canada two years ago. The
exhibition, with three 20 inch
by 28 inch photographs from
each day of the trip, will appear
in Seattle in March.
The two artists, both in their
early thirties, have been work
ing together ever since they

met at Foothill College, where
Beard was teaching photo
graphy classes and Hedgepath
was teaching English.
Beard, a former chemistry
major at UC-Berkeley, origi
nally planned to become a de
ntist, but after receiving his
degree in research chemistry
he submitted a folio to the San
Francisco Art Institute where

he was accepted. He finished
up with a MA degree in Fine
Arts at San lose State in 1974
Hedgepath graduated from
Stanford in 1971 with an MA in
English. A specialist in literary
criticism, his experience in
photography has been largely
limited to "dabbling." He is
currently working on a book of
poetry.
