# Lack of interest closes off-campus student center
## 
### Carla Neasel 
Despite the immediate availa
bility of ASSU funds and sponsor
ship, lack of sufficient student in
terest and leadership has cur
tailed the operation of the off
campus student center this year.
Since its inception four years
ago, the center has struggled with
the problem of establishing a core
group of off-campus students
who would be willing to work with
a student intern on the task of sus
taining active interest in the prog
ram among other off-campus stu
dents.
Advertisements for the position
of student intern were left un
answered, both last year and this
year. The job would have paid
roughly $3.50 per hour, but the
few students who were interested
felt that the work load was too
great for one person to handle,
according to Thorn Massey, assis
tant dean of student affairs.
Massey said compromises
could be made to reduce the
number of hours a week per per
son. One alternative would be to
form a committee. This approach

was proposed last year and never
brought to fruition.
Massey said that another plan
was to "sort of split the jobs" and
form one group with two points of
emphasis. One facet of the prog
ram could be directed toward
graduate students, who are
primarily housed off campus. The
other phase of the program would
be aimed toward the off-campus
undergraduates.
By creating two specialized
positions rather than isolating the
job to one, the work load would
have been reduced from approx
imately 20 hours a week to 10, he
said.
But Massey said he wasn't sure
what off-campus students
wanted.
"Most people seemed to want a
social facility rather than a
program-oriented one," said
Massey. "We weren't sure we
wanted to do that." He said if the
primary interest is social, then
there are plenty of opportunities
on campus other than organizing
a center.
"It's easy to get a room at Tre

sidder or elsewhere on campus
for a party...We have people here
(at the Office of Student Ac
tivities) to help organize things
like that."
Massey said that student initia
tive is the key element if a student
center is to be re-opened. "We
won't sustain activity merely for
its own sake. If students are in
terested in an off-campus student
center they have to pursue it,"he
said.
Alice Supton, associate dean of
residential education, questioned
whether the responsibility rested
entirely on the student. The needs
of students living off campus are
definite, she said, and since most
students do "prefer to live on
campus...maybe institutionally
we haven't fostered the interest"
(in a center).
Supton pointed out needs or
problems that nearly every off
campus student experiences,
especially those "living indepen
dently" for the first time.
Needs directly connected to
off-campus housing arrange
ments are: rental arrangements;

how to find available resources in
the community; how to decorate
an apartment cheaply; finding in
expensive markets; energy con
servation; budgeting; and safety
precautions.
All of these problems could be
addressed through a series of in
formational programs arranged
by a student center committee,
she said.
Supton noted that an important
function of the center in the past
was that it served as a "distribu
tion point" of information. Or
ganizations who wanted to con
tact off-campus students could do
so through the center.
Although Supton said she feels
an off-campus student center
would have much to offer, she
said it is possible the majority of
students not living in campus
facilities are satisfied with their liv
ing arrangements.
Another source of student dis
interest in the center could stem
from the unguaranteed-year
housing system. Many students
may consider their situation a
