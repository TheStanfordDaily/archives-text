"The crisis is past," Council of
Presidents (COP) member Andrew
Goldenkranz told members of the
ASSU Senate last night at an
emergency meeting called to discuss
funding for this month's Little Eleven
conference.
According to Goldenkranz, Dean
of the School of Engineering William
Kays gave him $500 to help cover the
cost of plane tickets for the Universi
ty's delegation to the conference.
Goldenkrantz had said Friday that he
needed another $700 by today to
cover ticket costs.
However, the deadline for pur
chasing tickets was postponed one
week. The delegation still needs $200
to meet the total $3000 cost that the
University must raise to send a full
delegation.
The Little Eleven Conference is a
meeting of student representatives
from 10 major universities (11 until
MIT dropped out) convening in
Philadelphia to develop a cohesive
student viewpoint on recurring is
sues.
Goldenkranz, who called the
emergency meeting said he was not
asking the senate for money but only
for suggestions on raising more
funds.
The senate which met as the fi
nance committee because the larger
body had failed to make quorum, in
formally suggested that the ASSU cut
the number of delegates it is sending

to the conference, or that each of the
twenty persons now scheduled to at
tend contribute $10 toward their
travel expenses.
The total cost of the trip will be
$5000, about $4 700 of which will go
to air fare costs. Thirteen hundred
dollars of this sum was contributed
by other schools attending the con
ference which are located closer to
Philadelphia and have lower travel
costs.
In other business, Sen. Ron
lohnson told the assembled senators
that Adolph Coors Co. and Coors
West, the independent distributor in
this area, have agreed to finance a
task force of up to four students to
travel to Colorado to examine condi
tions at the Coors brewery.
lohnson said that Robert Fran
ceshini, owner of Coors West, in
sisted only that the students issue a
disclaimer stating that the fact Coors
was paying for their trip would not
influence their decision, and that
they would approach the problem
with an open mind.
lohnson said Franceshini agreed to
the condition that those students
who go be absolutely free to meet
with anyone they desire or to go
anywhere while there.
Sen. Tom Cart reminded the se
nate that last week the senate voted
to invite John Sees, a Coors spokes
man, to speak before the senate, and
that after that meeting the senate
could decide whether it wanted to
authorize such a task force.
