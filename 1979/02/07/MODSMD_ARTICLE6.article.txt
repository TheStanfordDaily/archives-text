# More flexible policy on retirement urged
## 
### Fran Miller 
After a year of extensive research
and discussion, the Administrative
Panel on Retirement, appointed by
President Richard Lyman, has sub
mitted a report containing recom
mendations tor a new University fa
culty and staff retirement policy.
The panel's report provides for
gradual changes consistent with the
recent state and federal legislation
prohibiting mandatory retirement
age requirements.
The panel, composed of profes
sors, administrators, and staff, was
chaired by then-Provost William Mil
ler.
According to Miller, the policy
changes will go into effect as soon as
Lyman approves them.
The panel met 16 times between
lanuary 1978 and January 1979 and
"consulted widely through corres
pondence, interviews, and meetings
with a variety of individuals and
groups," the report said. Discussion
of the mandatory age requirement,
benefits, part-time employment, and
early retirement policies preceded
formal recommendations on these
issues.
Miller said he believes that "flexi
bility is the key theme" of the new
retirement policies. He commented
that changes were made not only be
cause of the law, but to "be consis
tent and meet Stanford's objectives
as well as those of its employees."
The panel suggested that the re
tirement program of the University
continue to be designed around a

"normal retirement age" — namely,
65. A counseling service will be avail
able to help professors and staff
members, beginning at age 58, to
plan ahead financially and
psychologically.
There will, however, be no man
datory retirement age for non
tenured faculty members and non
union staff. In accordance with the
law, no changes will be made in the
present policies with respect to te
nured faculty until July 1, 1982, or for
union staff members until Sept. 1,
1979. After these dates, although
there can still be dismissal for cause,
there will be no mandatory retire
ment age for any university
employee.
Part-time employment and early
retirement options will continue to
be made available. It is hoped that
recent modifications made by the
panel will encourage their use. The
panel recommended that the Uni
versity change its retirement plan to
make it possible for part-time profes
sors age 60 or over to draw upon their
annuity funds.
If the report is approved, profes
sors will also have the option of
going from full-time to part-time
employment and back to full-time if
they so desire, without giving up
their claim to tenure. The only stipu
lation is that professors must give
several months notice and must
maintain their chosen form of
employment for a minimum of one
year.
The panel also recommended rais
ing the minimum salary for tenured
professors who wish to participate in
the early retirement program. The
age for eligibility-is 58. After entering
this program, professors give up
their claim to tenure.
Miller stressed that he hopes pro
fessors will "seek their own plans out
of the various options available. I
think this will make for a better fa
culty,"
A separate group, the Committee
on Faculty and Staff Affairs, re
searched the area of benefits and
presented its findings to the panel.
According to Manager of Benefits
jeannie Thomas, the initial premise
of the committee was to "make be
nefits as much of a neutral issue as
possible."
She said that because ihe univer
sity will be employing more older
professors and staff members, it will
need to pay for the cost of health
services which are utilized more
often in later years.
The committee also recom
mended that anyone retiring before
the "normal retirement age" be
given some health coverage. Accord
ing to Thomas, this is an effort "to
make sure health insurance and cost
isn't a detriment to retirement."
Thomas said that the increase in cost
for the university would be gradual.

The panel met 16 times between
lanuary 1978 and January 1979 and
"consulted widely through corres
pondence, interviews, and meetings
with a variety of individuals and
groups," the report said. Discussion
of the mandatory age requirement,
benefits, part-time employment, and
early retirement policies preceded
formal recommendations on these
issues.
Miller said he believes that "flexi
bility is the key theme" of the new
retirement policies. He commented
that changes were made not only be
cause of the law, but to "be consis
tent and meet Stanford's objectives
as well as those of its employees."
The panel suggested that the re
tirement program of the University
continue to be designed around a

"normal retirement age" — namely,
65. A counseling service will be avail
able to help professors and staff
members, beginning at age 58, to
plan ahead financially and
psychologically.
There will, however, be no man
datory retirement age for non
tenured faculty members and non
union staff. In accordance with the
law, no changes will be made in the
present policies with respect to te
nured faculty until July 1, 1982, or for
union staff members until Sept. 1,
1979. After these dates, although
there can still be dismissal for cause,
there will be no mandatory retire
ment age for any university
employee.
Part-time employment and early
retirement options will continue to
be made available. It is hoped that
recent modifications made by the
panel will encourage their use. The
panel recommended that the Uni
versity change its retirement plan to
make it possible for part-time profes
sors age 60 or over to draw upon their
annuity funds.
If the report is approved, profes
sors will also have the option of
going from full-time to part-time
employment and back to full-time if
they so desire, without giving up
their claim to tenure. The only stipu
lation is that professors must give
several months notice and must
maintain their chosen form of
employment for a minimum of one
year.
The panel also recommended rais
ing the minimum salary for tenured
professors who wish to participate in
the early retirement program. The
age for eligibility-is 58. After entering
this program, professors give up
their claim to tenure.
Miller stressed that he hopes pro
fessors will "seek their own plans out
of the various options available. I
think this will make for a better fa
culty,"
A separate group, the Committee
on Faculty and Staff Affairs, re
searched the area of benefits and
presented its findings to the panel.
According to Manager of Benefits
jeannie Thomas, the initial premise
of the committee was to "make be
nefits as much of a neutral issue as
possible."
She said that because ihe univer
sity will be employing more older
professors and staff members, it will
need to pay for the cost of health
services which are utilized more
often in later years.
The committee also recom
mended that anyone retiring before
the "normal retirement age" be
given some health coverage. Accord
ing to Thomas, this is an effort "to
make sure health insurance and cost
isn't a detriment to retirement."
Thomas said that the increase in cost
for the university would be gradual.
