Rawalpindi. Pakistan — The Supreme Court in a split deci
sion yesterday upheld the conviction of deposed Prime /Minister
/uHtikar All Bhutto on a charge of political murder and the death
sentence gnen Mm.
The court also upheld the convictions and death sentences oi
lour others convicted w«th Bhutto-
Appeals for clemency and further legal moves were certain to
postpone the death by hanging of the 51-year-old politician who
dominated Pakistan trom 1971 until the military overthrew him in
1977.
Bhutto was the subfect ot much controversy here earlier in the
academic year. On INiov. 9, the ASSU Senate passed a resolution
urging the ASSU Guest Professorship Board to offer a guest
professorship to Bhutto.
However, in the face of criticism from many students, particu
larly a number of Pakistani graduate students, the senate voted
Dec. 4 alter much debate to rescind the offer. The senate said that
his conduct while m office would not make him worthy of such an
academic honor, but the appeal in the earlier resolution for
clemency tor Bhutto was retained.

Peler Siamos., dunrprison oi I he senate., expressed regret at
the upholding oi the death sentence. He said that the Pakistani
students here also said at the time ot the debate over Bhutto that
he should not be killed, although they dud urge the rescinding of
the guest professorship otter.
"Our effort dad stir a lot ot international awareness of and
concern for the issue. Perhaps it played some role in providing
some oi the necessary pressure that eventually led the Pakistan
government to allow Bhutto's personal testimony in lacs defense,
which had been denied since the beginning oi the trial." he said.
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, the army commander who
ousted Bhutto and now heads a military government, said eoriier
he would not change the court's ruling. But he was believed to be
under pressure from the governments of Untied States. China
and other allies who tear the execution of Bhutto would open a
period of extreme instability in Pakistan.
All colleges and universities were ordered closed until further
notice in populous Pun|ab province and the adjoining Northwest
Frontier province. Pro-Bhutto students in both of the two north
ern provinces had threatened demonstrations if Bhutto was to be
hanged.
