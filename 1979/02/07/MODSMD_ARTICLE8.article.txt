# Few restrictions on departures
## Faculty leaves of absence common 
### Stephanie Poggs 
So far this year, 176 faculty
members have left or are plan
ning lo leave the University,
and no one here seems wor
ried or even sees this as un
usual.
In fact, if this year is anything
like the last two. the number of
faculty that will have left by the
end of the year will probably be
closer to 200.
But these faculty — about
one-sixth of the 1100 members
of the Academic Council leave
every year — aren"! leaving be
cause they are unhappy here.
They have requested and re
ceived permission for leaves of
absence without pay or sabbat

icals.
The University doesn't dis
courage such departures. In
fact, not onlv does the provost,
who has final authority to grant
leaves, allow for ordinary sab
baticals. leaves to take gov
ernment positions and special
research opportunities, leaves
for maternity or health
reasons, and nearly any com
bination of the above, but it
has also recently arranged a
junior faculty leave program,
which gives new options to fa
culty without tenured status.
Does this mean faculty are
exiting in hordes and possibly
never coming back? Actually,
attending to Nloel Kolak. assis

tant to the provost, despite
specific University policy
which states that a leave of ab
sence may not exceed 24
months in a ■seven-year period,
a special clause provides for
virtually anv arrangement with
department approval.
Department chairpersons
must review the leave request
before it reaches the provost.
Because applications are
cleared at the department level
first, "seldom does the pro
vost's office deny a leave on
the basis of the worth of the
project, said Kolak.
Psychology Prot. Richard At
kinson. for example, re
quested a leave of absence

which began on Sept. 1, 1975
and is not expected to return
until Aug. 31 of this year. He is
currently serving as director of
the National Science Founda
tion. Prof. Donald Kennedy is
in Washington D.C. serving as
Commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration. His leave
period runs only from spring
1977 to this August, but exten
sions are not uncommon, ac
cording to Kolak.
Technically, a person could
be on leave indefinitely, as
long as he or she cleared the
move with his or her depart
ment chairperson and has the
approval of the provost, he
said.
