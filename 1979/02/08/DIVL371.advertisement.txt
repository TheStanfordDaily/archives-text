WAITLIST SPACES AVAILABLE FOR
CLIVEDEN SUMMER FOCUS PROGRAM
Since there were fewer applicants than anticipated, no
waitlist exists for the Cliveden summer focus program on
"THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE NEW EUROPE".
We expect that some of those accepted for the program will
not choose to attend, so we are reopening the competition
for waitlist spaces.
Waitlist candidates must turn in their completed applica
tions by Friday, February 16 at 5:00 p.m. The prerequis
ites for the program are ECON 1 and either IR/HIST/POLS
35 or some other comparative politics/international rela
tions coursework. Both the Economics and Political Sci
ence course prerequisites must be completed by the end of
spring quarter, and preference may be given to those who
have completed these courses at the time of the application.
For more information, and applications, contact:
OVERSEAS STUDIES, 112 Old Union, Stanford. 497-
3555.
