Quality of Product/ Quality of Life
The TOTAL Fluke Package
Engineering design excellence at John Fluke Company
means more to us than providing an environment of recog
nized professionalism. Our major asset is our people, like
you, that want and get immediate "hands-on" design respon
sibility — people that are expected to make significant con
tributions to our continued rapid growth. To us, engineering
excellence comes not only from providing our people an
opportunity for accelerated growth and recognition but also
from an environment that offers the outstanding recreational
opportunities found only in the Pacific Northwest.
Quality of Product/Quality of Life — The Total Fluke Package
that has nurtured our design excellence. A John Fluke Com
pany Representative will be on campus Friday, February 9,
1979. Graduating BSEE's and MSEE's, spend a few minutes
with us to discuss your TOTAL career needs. Contact your
placement center to schedule interview times.
