## 
### Seth Zuckerman 
Thomas Merigan, professor of
medicine here, will head the com
mittee to select a new dean for the
Medical School, according lo Presi
dent Richard Lyman.
The previous dean, Clayton Rich,
resigned last November amid con
troversy over the so-called "double
billing" issue and student dissatisfac
tion with a tuition hike. Lawrence
Crowley, professor of surgery, has
been acting dean since Rich left at
the beginning of last month.
Merigan said the committee will
hold its next meeting within the next
two weeks. He declined to predict
the amount of time it would take to
select a new dean. He said he would
rather "make those projections to
gether" with the other members of
the committee.
The committee will conduct a
"nationwide search" for a new dean.
"We are looking for the best
qualified person," he said.
The committee's formal charge —

Jean Fetter, assistant to Lyman. The
final statement was delayed because
of Lyman's recent visit to the East
Coast, she said.
