# Peer counselors at Cowell give birth control advice

A young woman walks up to the main desk
at Cowell Student Health Center, starts to fill
out the white appointment slip and halts —
"Reason for visit?"
"Excuse me, I, uh, had sex yesterday after
noon without any birth control. What do I put
down?"
"Unprotected intercourse," the older
woman snaps back.
There were 531 pregnancv tests adminis
tered at Cowell during 1977-78. From 1975 to
1976, only 34 of the 227 reported pregnancies
were planned, according to John Dorman, a
staff physician at Cowell.
While the average rate of unwanted pre
gnancies on college campuses in the United
States runs from 5 to 10 percent, the rate here
is only 1.4 percent. Dorman said he suspects
that the figure is low because many pregnan
cies are never reported to Cowell. Dorman
said students are here do not want the men
tion of a pregnancy on their permanent med
ical records.
Human error
It's not that birth control doesn't work. The
usual cause of an unwanted pregnancy is
human error, according to Connie Starr, first
nurse practitioner at Cowell. Starr specializes
in obstetric and gynecological work.
Starr said that combining condom and foam
is as effective as birth control pills
99 percent effective. But, she said, it takes
motivation on the part of both partners to
prevent pregnancy. The human element is
critical and often accounts for the difference
in statistics between the theoretical and ac
tual effectiveness of any method of birth con
trol, Starr said.
Even in the wake of the sexual revolution, a
student might be timid when dealing with his
or her body. If a student doesn't feel com
fortable with his physician, he should switch,
said Dr. lames McClenahan, director of
Cowell.

McClenahan sponsors a three-unit con
traceptive peer counseling course offered
winter and spring quarters. From 15 to 20
students enroll in the course each quarter.
The class grounds students with information
about birth control and the basics of sexual
ity.
Students are also taught basic listening
skills in the 12-session, six-week course. In
return for the training, students are expected
to volunteer two quarters of counseling ser
vice, McClenahan said.
"There's no best method of birth control,"
said peer counselor Lisa Podell. "They all
have their disadvantages. It really depends
on the person. If the woman has sex often
and doesn't want to be bothered with
mechanical methods every time, then the Pill
or lUD (intrauterine device) is a good op
tion.
"If, on the other hand, she only has sex
once or twice a month, then the side effects
of the Pill or lUD don't seem worth it," Podell
said.
"A diaphragm is a good idea. So many
people come in here ready to use whatever
birth control their best friend uses. But it's a
private decision and that's one thing we
stress."
'Well-trained' counselors
McClenahan said he believes the student
counselors are well-trained. They can talk
about problems or sexualtiy in general, dis
pense information on birth control and re
commend books on sexuality, he said. They
can also recommend professionals to deal
with more serious gynecological or sexual
problems.
The contraceptive counselors are an
under-used source of good information, one
counselor said. The problem, some coun
selors assert, is getting people to take the
"sometimes self-conscious trip" through the
Cowell doors to find the peer counselors.
