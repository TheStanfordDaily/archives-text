# Exotic birds bring pleasure ...and disease

Washington (AP) — Exotic
birds are becoming more and
more popularas pets in the Un
ited States, bringing pleasure
to many. But the Agriculture
Department says the bird pet
boom also increases the threat
of importing bird diseases.
The department has prop
osed strict new rules governing
importing privately-owned pet
birds.
Department officials recall
the epidemic of exotic Newcas
tle disease that erupted in
Southern California in 1971-73.
The disease, which affects
most bird species, was intro
duced by pet birds from South
America.
Before the plague was eradi
cated by the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service,
more than 12 million birds —
mostly chickens — had died or
been destroyed. The total cost
came to $56 million.
Currently importing of per
sonally owned birds operates
under a gentleman's agree
ment, under which the owner
promises to keep the bird in
isolation at home for 30 days.
But George Pierson of the
animal health service says this
just isn't working.
"Too often the address given
as the bird's final destination
turns out to bean empty lot. Or
the owner has sold the bird or
reports it has literally 'flown
the coop.' The worst thing we
hear is that the bird has died
and been disposed of," Pier
son said.
If a disease like Newcastle
struck today the cost could
amount to $280 million, Pier
son said, and the price of chic
ken and eggs would skyrocket.
Attempting to reduce this
threat, the new rules will re
quire travelers bringing in a
bird to leave it with a depart
ment inspector at one of nine
ports of entry for a 30-day
quarantine.
They will have to make re
servations in advance for
quarantine space and obtain a
veterinary health certificate
from the country of origin.
The import limit would re
main at two birds per family,
and there would be a fee of $80
for one bird, $100 for two, to
cover costs of transport, feed,
health inspection and laborat
ory work.
