# Arthur Wolf eats fish eyes, studies incest
## 
### Meg Lundstrom 
Assoc. Anthropology
Prof. Arthur Wolf has a
shock of dark blond hair,
long tapering fingers, and
the lanky elegance of Peter
O' Toole. It's hard to im
agine him eating whole fish
eyes in a gulp.
Yet that's what is required
of an anthropologist trying
to fit into the life of a village
in northern Taiwan.
"Chinese food is rela
tively easy to adjust to,
compared to food in the
New Guinea highlands," he
said laughingly. "But fish
eyes are considered a real
delicacy. When you're in
the position of an honored
guest, the people are insis
tent on serving you this de
licacy, after a point it's im
politic to refuse.
"Besides," he shrugged,
"fish eyes don't taste like
much, really. They can be
swallowed whole,"
Wolf did work in
Taiwan during three sepa
rate visits between 1957 and
1970, staying a total of five
years. He was collecting
data and conducting inter
views to test the "familiarity
breeds contempt" theory of
the incest taboo.
Incest
The prohibition against
incest, he said, exists in

some form in all cultures
with the exception of Egyp
tian royalty from late dynas
tic to early Roman times.
"They've even found a
wedding invitation from pa
rents inviting guests to the
marriage of their son and
daughter," he said.
One man who tried to
explain the taboo was
Swedish anthropologist
Edward Westermarck, who
said it had its origins in aver
sion stemming from inti
mate childhood associa
tions. The theory, Wolf said,
never received much ag
reement, and in fact was
ridiculed by Sigmund Freud
and others. Opponents ar
gued that if an aversion al
ready existed, there would
be no need for the existence
of a taboo.
Brides adopted
Wolf said he became in
terested in Westermarck's
theory in Taiwan when he
found that about 40 percent
of the marriages there in
volved women who had
been adopted as infants by
their future husbands'
families and raised with the
boys, for instance, one
mother of 12 exchanged her
six daughters for six other
female babies, and when
they were grown, married
them to her six sons.

The practice existed be
cause it saved the boy's fam
ily from having to pay bride
prices, and gave mothers a
more secure future by bind
ing their daughers-in-law to
them closely, he said.
On the surface, Wolf said,
this practice disproved
Westermark's theory.
"But looking closer, one
finds that people who marry
in this fashion don't like it.
'It's likea movieyou've seen
four or five times before."
'Minor marriages'
Wolf collected demog
raphic information which
showed that in those ar
rangements, which Wolf
termed "minor marriages,"
the fertility rate was 25 per
cent lower and the divorce
rate three times higher than
in "major marriages," those
in which the wife entered
the husband's household as
an adult.
Early adoptions for the
purpose of family marriages
no longer occur, he said.
"As parental authority de
teriorated, children rebel
led against that form of mar
riage."
Conducting field work in
a small village, was not al
ways a comfortable experi
ence, Wolf said.
"You can become part of
the village community, but

in a sense you never can,
he said. "Thechildren in the
village would call my wife
and me 'people with long
hooked noses.' But if we
met the children at a nearby
market town, they would
say respectfully, 'Hello, Mr.
Wu',and walk hand-in-hand
with us back home.
"The biggest strain in
field work," he reflected,
"is the exhaustion of being
at work all the time. You
never behave entirely
naturally because you're
always monitoring be
havior. Everything happen
ing to you is data. You're al
ways both interacting and
observing the interaction.
"In a sense it's like lectur
ing, where you're always
playing at two levels, trying
to succeed as a performer
and also to succeed as a
teacher," Wolf said.
Teaching award
On both counts as a
teacher, Wolf gets high re
views. In 1976 he received
the Dean's Award for Teac
hing in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
This quarter he is teach
ing "Problems in An
thropology," a large intro
ductory class. He lectures in
a soft, rapid voice, wrapping
the lavaliere microphone
cord around his hands, pac

ing up and down in front of
the room.
An anthropology
graduate student, Steve
Sangren, called Wolf "the
best lecturer in the depart
ment. He has the talent of
communicating very com
plex ideas very effectively;
he simplifies them so well
that people don't always
realize the penetrating
analysis that underlies
them. He has a very engag
ing manner, and puts a lot of
thought into every lecture.
"He's one of the best
teachers I've ever met,"
Sangren said.
Ranch family
Wolf grew up in Santa
Rosa in a family of ranchers
and loggers. Neither of his
parents graduated from
primary school. He picked
prunes in grade school and
high school, worked as a
logger when a teenager,
and worked in the gold
fields in Alaska 10 degrees
south of the Arctic Circle
during a college summer.
His wife Margery grew up
with him in Santa Rosa.
"Her mother was my grade
school teacher, and she
claims her mother manipu
lated the marriage. I tell her
it's not really a minor mar
riage, though," he said
laughingly.

During their first trip to
Taiwan, Mrs. Wolf wrote
The House of Lim, a book
widely used in college an
thropology and Asian
studies classes. She also
wrote Woman and the Fam
ily in Rural Taiwan, and
edited an anthology on
women in China which re
sulted from a conference
she organized.
The Wolfs were married
when he was a student at
Santa Rosa Junior College,
and soon moved to Cornell,
where he received his B.A.
in English literature and
Ph.D. in anthropology.
Wolf came here in 1968.
Two of the highlights of

his career, he said, were the
year he spent in England lec
turing at the London School
of Economics and Political
Science and the year he
spent as a visiting fellow at
All Souls College at Oxford
University, "a college so
elitist it doesn't even have
students."
It was at the London
School of Economics that
Wolf met Maurice Freed
man, one of the foremost
anthropologists on China,
whom Wolf said he consid
ers his mentor. A photo
graph of Freedman hangs
on the wall of Wolf's office,
along with delicate Chinese
paintings.

'It's likea movieyou've seen
four or five times before."
'Minor marriages'
Wolf collected demog
raphic information which
showed that in those ar
rangements, which Wolf
termed "minor marriages,"
the fertility rate was 25 per
cent lower and the divorce
rate three times higher than
in "major marriages," those
in which the wife entered
the husband's household as
an adult.
Early adoptions for the
purpose of family marriages
no longer occur, he said.
"As parental authority de
teriorated, children rebel
led against that form of mar
riage."
Conducting field work in
a small village, was not al
ways a comfortable experi
ence, Wolf said.
"You can become part of
the village community, but

in a sense you never can,
he said. "Thechildren in the
village would call my wife
and me 'people with long
hooked noses.' But if we
met the children at a nearby
market town, they would
say respectfully, 'Hello, Mr.
Wu',and walk hand-in-hand
with us back home.
"The biggest strain in
field work," he reflected,
"is the exhaustion of being
at work all the time. You
never behave entirely
naturally because you're
always monitoring be
havior. Everything happen
ing to you is data. You're al
ways both interacting and
observing the interaction.
"In a sense it's like lectur
ing, where you're always
playing at two levels, trying
to succeed as a performer
and also to succeed as a
teacher," Wolf said.
Teaching award
On both counts as a
teacher, Wolf gets high re
views. In 1976 he received
the Dean's Award for Teac
hing in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
This quarter he is teach
ing "Problems in An
thropology," a large intro
ductory class. He lectures in
a soft, rapid voice, wrapping
the lavaliere microphone
cord around his hands, pac

ing up and down in front of
the room.
An anthropology
graduate student, Steve
Sangren, called Wolf "the
best lecturer in the depart
ment. He has the talent of
communicating very com
plex ideas very effectively;
he simplifies them so well
that people don't always
realize the penetrating
analysis that underlies
them. He has a very engag
ing manner, and puts a lot of
thought into every lecture.
"He's one of the best
teachers I've ever met,"
Sangren said.
Ranch family
Wolf grew up in Santa
Rosa in a family of ranchers
and loggers. Neither of his
parents graduated from
primary school. He picked
prunes in grade school and
high school, worked as a
logger when a teenager,
and worked in the gold
fields in Alaska 10 degrees
south of the Arctic Circle
during a college summer.
His wife Margery grew up
with him in Santa Rosa.
"Her mother was my grade
school teacher, and she
claims her mother manipu
lated the marriage. I tell her
it's not really a minor mar
riage, though," he said
laughingly.

During their first trip to
Taiwan, Mrs. Wolf wrote
The House of Lim, a book
widely used in college an
thropology and Asian
studies classes. She also
wrote Woman and the Fam
ily in Rural Taiwan, and
edited an anthology on
women in China which re
sulted from a conference
she organized.
The Wolfs were married
when he was a student at
Santa Rosa Junior College,
and soon moved to Cornell,
where he received his B.A.
in English literature and
Ph.D. in anthropology.
Wolf came here in 1968.
Two of the highlights of

his career, he said, were the
year he spent in England lec
turing at the London School
of Economics and Political
Science and the year he
spent as a visiting fellow at
All Souls College at Oxford
University, "a college so
elitist it doesn't even have
students."
It was at the London
School of Economics that
Wolf met Maurice Freed
man, one of the foremost
anthropologists on China,
whom Wolf said he consid
ers his mentor. A photo
graph of Freedman hangs
on the wall of Wolf's office,
along with delicate Chinese
paintings.


Arthur Wolf
Assoc. Anthropology
Prof. Arthur Wolf has a
shock of dark blond hair,
long tapering fingers, and
the lanky elegance of Peter
O' Toole. It's hard to im
agine him eating whole fish
eyes in a gulp.
Yet that's what is required
of an anthropologist trying
to fit into the life of a village
in northern Taiwan.
"Chinese food is rela
tively easy to adjust to,
compared to food in the
New Guinea highlands," he
said laughingly. "But fish
eyes are considered a real
delicacy. When you're in
the position of an honored
guest, the people are insis
tent on serving you this de
licacy, after a point it's im
politic to refuse.
"Besides," he shrugged,
"fish eyes don't taste like
much, really. They can be
swallowed whole,"
Wolf did work in
Taiwan during three sepa
rate visits between 1957 and
1970, staying a total of five
years. He was collecting
data and conducting inter
views to test the "familiarity
breeds contempt" theory of
the incest taboo.
Incest
The prohibition against
incest, he said, exists in

some form in all cultures
with the exception of Egyp
tian royalty from late dynas
tic to early Roman times.
"They've even found a
wedding invitation from pa
rents inviting guests to the
marriage of their son and
daughter," he said.
One man who tried to
explain the taboo was
Swedish anthropologist
Edward Westermarck, who
said it had its origins in aver
sion stemming from inti
mate childhood associa
tions. The theory, Wolf said,
never received much ag
reement, and in fact was
ridiculed by Sigmund Freud
and others. Opponents ar
gued that if an aversion al
ready existed, there would
be no need for the existence
of a taboo.
Brides adopted
Wolf said he became in
terested in Westermarck's
theory in Taiwan when he
found that about 40 percent
of the marriages there in
volved women who had
been adopted as infants by
their future husbands'
families and raised with the
boys, for instance, one
mother of 12 exchanged her
six daughters for six other
female babies, and when
they were grown, married
them to her six sons.

The practice existed be
cause it saved the boy's fam
ily from having to pay bride
prices, and gave mothers a
more secure future by bind
ing their daughers-in-law to
them closely, he said.
On the surface, Wolf said,
this practice disproved
Westermark's theory.
"But looking closer, one
finds that people who marry
in this fashion don't like it.
'It's likea movieyou've seen

and worked in the gold
fields in Alaska 10 degrees
south of the Arctic Circle
during a college summer.
His wife Margery grew up
with him in Santa Rosa.
"Her mother was my grade
school teacher, and she
claims her mother manipu
lated the marriage. I tell her
it's not really a minor mar
riage, though," he said
laughingly.

During their first trip to
Taiwan, Mrs. Wolf wrote
The House of Lim, a book
widely used in college an
thropology and Asian
studies classes. She also
wrote Woman and the Fam
ily in Rural Taiwan, and
edited an anthology on
women in China which re
sulted from a conference
she organized.
The Wolfs were married
when he was a student at
Santa Rosa Junior College,
and soon moved to Cornell,
where he received his B.A.
in English literature and
Ph.D. in anthropology.
Wolf came here in 1968.
Two of the highlights of

his career, he said, were the
year he spent in England lec
turing at the London School
of Economics and Political
Science and the year he
spent as a visiting fellow at
All Souls College at Oxford
University, "a college so
elitist it doesn't even have
students."
It was at the London
School of Economics that
Wolf met Maurice Freed
man, one of the foremost
anthropologists on China,
whom Wolf said he consid
ers his mentor. A photo
graph of Freedman hangs
on the wall of Wolf's office,
along with delicate Chinese
paintings.
