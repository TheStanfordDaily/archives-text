# Berkeley theater ensemble works with institutionalized
## 
### Catherine Chey 
One sector of oppressed
humanity that does not get
much attention from the news
media is the institutionalized.
There is one group in the Bay
Area that is actively interested in
the problems of institutionali
zation and its effects on human
beings. This group is the Ber
keleylights Theater Ensemble.
A non-profit organization, it is
directed by Arthur Feinsoid, a
graduate of the Harvard and
Berkeley drama departments.
The group trains acting work
shop leaders and sends them
to hospitals, homes for the
aged or handicapped, mental
institutions, and prisons, in
cludint; San Quentin.

News Analysis

The ensemble began in 1976
with about 12 Berkeley grad
students and alumni who
shared a common goal. Fein
soid said, "We wanted to bring
theater to the community,
especially to those segments of
society which would benefit
the most from the artistic as
well as therapeutic elements of
drama."
Feinsoid said the group went
to prisons in the Bay Area and
taught inmates to act and put
on their own productions.
They also went to a juvenile
hall in Alameda County. Fein
soid said the group got a "very
positive response" from the
young people who helped
create their own skits and im
provisations for the acting
workshops.
The group hasn't always met
with success. Feinsoid said
there were too many distrac
tions during many workshops.
He said that often "people
were sunk in such a low energy
level that they never showed
interest." When a group first
gets there we try to generate
interest by talking with the
people, telling jokes, asking
them to help us with props,
moving chairs around — any
thing to get their energy level
up and not ours down."
Tailor to needs
Another key to the group's
success, according to Feinsoid,
is that they tailor the acting ex
ercises to the specific needs
of each group of people. Fein
soid said he has developed a
different set of exercises and a
way to approach each work
shop.
"We find a tremendous

source of untapped talent once
we are able to stimulate imagi
nations that have been some
what deadened by the institu
tional setting," Feinsoid said.
"A lot of people have gone
through some unusual lives,
providing them with an expe
riential base that was just wait
ing to be explored through the
acting medium. The work
shops tried to draw out all that
is stifled in institutions."
These people have the po
tential to be effective tale
bearers for their own peer
groups, Feinsoid said. "Try to
imagine, the impact of a play
put on by actors in wheelchairs
for an audience composed of
people also in wheelchairs. Or
imagine the response of a deaf
audience to a play about deaf
people dor\e in mime and sign
language. The possibilities are
endless."
Actors gain
Perhaps even more than the
audiences, the actors them
selves have a lot to gain. They
develop self-confidence and
increase their ability to com
municate both verbally and
non-verbally, Feinsoid said.
"The workshops sharpen im
aginations, give people better

concentration. Not only do the
workshops give people some
enjoyment away from their
self-centered worries and
cares, they teach social skills
that enable the in
stitutionalized to interact with
their neighbors and peers in
positive ways."
Feinsoid said he has found a
great deal of negative patterns
of behavior in institutions. He
said the workshops help to
break the patterns of isolation
and maladjustment that de
velop. Institutions can be a
waste of human energy and
creativity. He said that once
boredom sets in, it is very dif
ficult to break people out of
institutional depression.
Feinsoid said he dreams of
expanding his program. He
said he would like to publish
his teaching methods and
techniques so that the people
who staff institutions will have
information on acting work
shops available to them. He is
currently training those in
terested in acting as workshop
leaders. These workshop lead
ers combine artistic achieve
ment with social responsibility
and bring theater within the
walls of an institution.

way to approach each work
shop.
"We find a tremendous

source of untapped talent once
we are able to stimulate imagi
nations that have been some
what deadened by the institu
tional setting," Feinsoid said.
"A lot of people have gone
through some unusual lives,
providing them with an expe
riential base that was just wait
ing to be explored through the
acting medium. The work
shops tried to draw out all that
is stifled in institutions."
These people have the po
tential to be effective tale
bearers for their own peer
groups, Feinsoid said. "Try to
imagine, the impact of a play
put on by actors in wheelchairs
for an audience composed of
people also in wheelchairs. Or
imagine the response of a deaf
audience to a play about deaf
people dor\e in mime and sign
language. The possibilities are
endless."
Actors gain
Perhaps even more than the
audiences, the actors them
selves have a lot to gain. They
develop self-confidence and
increase their ability to com
municate both verbally and
non-verbally, Feinsoid said.
"The workshops sharpen im
aginations, give people better

concentration. Not only do the
workshops give people some
enjoyment away from their
self-centered worries and
cares, they teach social skills
that enable the in
stitutionalized to interact with
their neighbors and peers in
positive ways."
Feinsoid said he has found a
great deal of negative patterns
of behavior in institutions. He
said the workshops help to
break the patterns of isolation
and maladjustment that de
velop. Institutions can be a
waste of human energy and
creativity. He said that once
boredom sets in, it is very dif
ficult to break people out of
institutional depression.
Feinsoid said he dreams of
expanding his program. He
said he would like to publish
his teaching methods and
techniques so that the people
who staff institutions will have
information on acting work
shops available to them. He is
currently training those in
terested in acting as workshop
leaders. These workshop lead
ers combine artistic achieve
ment with social responsibility
and bring theater within the
walls of an institution.
One sector of oppressed
humanity that does not get
much attention from the news
media is the institutionalized.
There is one group in the Bay
Area that is actively interested in
the problems of institutionali
zation and its effects on human
beings. This group is the Ber
keleylights Theater Ensemble.
A non-profit organization, it is
directed by Arthur Feinsoid, a
graduate of the Harvard and
Berkeley drama departments.
The group trains acting work
shop leaders and sends them
to hospitals, homes for the
aged or handicapped, mental
institutions, and prisons, in
cludint; San Quentin.

News Analysis

The ensemble began in 1976
with about 12 Berkeley grad
students and alumni who
shared a common goal. Fein
soid said, "We wanted to bring
theater to the community,
especially to those segments of
society which would benefit
the most from the artistic as
well as therapeutic elements of
drama."
Feinsoid said the group went
to prisons in the Bay Area and
taught inmates to act and put
on their own productions.
They also went to a juvenile
hall in Alameda County. Fein
soid said the group got a "very
positive response" from the
young people who helped
create their own skits and im
provisations for the acting
workshops.
The group hasn't always met
with success. Feinsoid said
there were too many distrac
tions during many workshops.
He said that often "people
were sunk in such a low energy
level that they never showed
interest." When a group first
gets there we try to generate
interest by talking with the
people, telling jokes, asking
them to help us with props,
moving chairs around — any
thing to get their energy level
up and not ours down."
Tailor to needs
Another key to the group's
success, according to Feinsoid,
is that they tailor the acting ex
ercises to the specific needs
of each group of people. Fein
soid said he has developed a
different set of exercises and a
way to approach each work
shop.
"We find a tremendous

source of untapped talent once
we are able to stimulate imagi
nations that have been some
what deadened by the institu
tional setting," Feinsoid said.
"A lot of people have gone
