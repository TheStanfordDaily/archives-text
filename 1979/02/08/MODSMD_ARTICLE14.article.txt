## Editorial Senate reform needed 
### 
That it is time for a fundamental
change in student government here is a
fact that is widely recognized. The
events of last year — more than half of
the elected or alternate undergraduate
senators cited for campaign infractions
after an election which almost 75 percent
of the student body ignored, the failure
of the ASSU boycott of the Committee
for Investment Responsibility (CIR) and
the ultimately unsuccessful campaign to
abolish the senate waged by the Com
mittee to Retire Aspiring Politicos
(CRAP) — demonstrated this conclu
sively.
The senate Rules Committee which
meets today is now considering various
reform proposals in an effort to change a
student senate which was characterized
by the Election Review Board (ERB) last
year as "weak, petty, ineffectual, irres
ponsible and increasingly ignored."
In a burst of enthusiasm
senators and a COP member have even
expressed a desire to rewrite the ASSU
constitution, last revised 10 years ago.
Such a serious step as rewriting the con
stitution would be a major undertaking
requiring a great commitment of time
and energy; but no compelling reasons
to do so have yet emerged, as they must
before any action is taken.
We believe the Rules Committee and
the senate as a whole should instead
concentrate their efforts on senate re
form, which is so desperately needed if
the senate is to be a viable body that can
command even a modicum of respect
from the administration and the stu
dents it is supposed to represent.
It is this, what the ERB called the "de
sperate need...for more and better in
formation, communication and feed
back" between the senate and its consti
tuency that almost all of the current re
form proposals address. At this point,
there are five major recommendations:
— residential districting. Under this
system, the University would be divided
into districts, geographical or otherwise,
with one senator representing each dis
trict.
— staggered elections. Instead of the

current practice of holding a single elec
tion in the fall, two or more elections
would be held at different times of the
year, with a certain proportion of seats
open for each election.
— limitation of slates. This proposal
would put an absolute limit on the
number of candidates that can join
forces and run as a single slate.
— an annually-appointed ERB. Instead
of convening an ERB only when con
troversy demands it, an ERB would
routinely be appointed each year to cer
tify election results.
— "live petitions." Under this prop
osal, the senate would be composed of
all individuals who had successfully ob
tained the signatures of 200 students in
support of their candidacy. A senator
could be unseated at any time by the
withdrawal of a certain number of the
signatures.
Each of these proposals addresses a
different aspect of the problems that
face our present system of student gov
ernment. It is possible that all. none or a
combination of these measures might
ultimately be adopted. As the period of
serious deliberation continues these
proposals will be better defined and
explored. All have serious problems that
become immediately apparent on closer
examination.
However, the live petition proposal —
certainly the most radical and far
reaching — seems to raise more ques
tions than it answers. Besides the sub
stantial logistical problems that the ad
ministration of such a system would
create, and the constant turnover it en
courages that would make committee
work slow, if not impossible, it raises the
old and unanswered question of
whether a legislator is responsible solely
to his constituents or to his principles
and ideology.
Adoption of the live petition proposal
thus seems ill-advised. All other reform
proposals deserve serious considera
tion, however, and the senate should be
urged to make all efforts to provide the
ASSU with concrete proposals for mean
ingful change as quickly as possible.

system, the University would be divided
into districts, geographical or otherwise,
with one senator representing each dis
trict.
— staggered elections. Instead of the

current practice of holding a single elec
tion in the fall, two or more elections
would be held at different times of the
year, with a certain proportion of seats
open for each election.
— limitation of slates. This proposal
would put an absolute limit on the
number of candidates that can join
forces and run as a single slate.
— an annually-appointed ERB. Instead
of convening an ERB only when con
troversy demands it, an ERB would
routinely be appointed each year to cer
tify election results.
— "live petitions." Under this prop
osal, the senate would be composed of
all individuals who had successfully ob
tained the signatures of 200 students in
support of their candidacy. A senator
could be unseated at any time by the
withdrawal of a certain number of the
signatures.
Each of these proposals addresses a
different aspect of the problems that
face our present system of student gov
ernment. It is possible that all. none or a
combination of these measures might
ultimately be adopted. As the period of
serious deliberation continues these
proposals will be better defined and
explored. All have serious problems that
become immediately apparent on closer
examination.
However, the live petition proposal —
certainly the most radical and far
reaching — seems to raise more ques
tions than it answers. Besides the sub
stantial logistical problems that the ad
ministration of such a system would
create, and the constant turnover it en
courages that would make committee
work slow, if not impossible, it raises the
old and unanswered question of
whether a legislator is responsible solely
to his constituents or to his principles
and ideology.
Adoption of the live petition proposal
thus seems ill-advised. All other reform
proposals deserve serious considera
tion, however, and the senate should be
urged to make all efforts to provide the
ASSU with concrete proposals for mean
ingful change as quickly as possible.
