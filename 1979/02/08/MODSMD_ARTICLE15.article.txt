## Dissent: consider petition 
### 
We believe the live petition proposal is a plan
with considerable merit. After careful study, its
faults may prove to outweigh its advantages, but
we think this idea has too much potential to
discard lightly.
Under the live petition plan, elections as we
know them would not exist. Instead, a person
would earn a senate seat by collecting the signa
tures of 200 students on a petition and would
remain a senator only as long as he or she could
retain their support.
Each student would only be allowed to sign
one petition, but if at any time during the year a
student were dissatisfied with his or her senator,
he or she would be free to shift allegiance to
another senator or an aspiring candidate.
Though there would be no upper limit on signa
tures, any senator who does not maintain the
minimal number would lose his or her seat.
We believe a senate assembled under such a
system could better represent the students than
the other proposed plans. It could open com
munication between senator and student and
allow any group on campus — grad students,
minorities oreven freshmen — to band together
and make their voice heard.
At the same time, students could be more
interested in their senate because they would
have a continual say as to its membership, un
like the present once-a-year election.
The senate could be stronger because 200
students would stand behind each vote on its
floor. On especially important issues, a majority
of such a senate could carry far greater weight
than it does now.
We do recognize the difficulties involved.
Keeping track of the petitions could prove a
logistical nightmare. The senate could lose its
ability to compromise by becoming "too rep
resentative," filled with single-issue senators
picked solely for their ability to adhere stead

fastly to their positions.
But the other proposals are not without their
own problems. Since no one on this campus
carries proof of where they live, the districted
elections that have been proposed would be
expensive and prone to fraud. Also, many stu
dents live off campus or change residences dur
ing the year.
If staggered elections were combined with a
districting system, we could have the absurdity
of electing half of the districted senators two
months before everyone moves out of their
dorms for the summer.
Also recall that the ASSU had districted elec
tions 10 years ago, but abandoned them be
cause of their inadequacies.
Cynics abound when it comes to the senate,
and we really don't blame them. But we don't
want the cynics to assert superciliously that
students here don't and will never care about
what their senate might do.
Perhaps the senate's problems are not solely
with the students. Maybe the system itself is part
of the problem. Maybe the proper change could
boost student interest and involvement in ASSU
politics.
We aren't sure about live petitions. But we
aren't sure about the other proposals either. In
that spirit we would like to encourage debate,
both pro and con, on live petitions in the com
munity.
We think the senate should definitely discuss
the proposal. If the idea proves fruitless, no
thing has been lost. But if the live petitions
proposal proves worthy, this year's senate will
have given the community something more val
uable than an entire flock of deposed prime
ministers.
