Less government
I would like to open this let
ter by saying that I admire the
work of the Stanford Coors
Boycott Committee. I find it re
freshing to see persons in
volved in an effort to effect
change in a peaceful, legal
manner.
If more persons in the Un
ited States would get involved
instead of merely complaining,
much more could be ac
complished and a return of
government to the people
might well be accomplished.
However, the purpose of this
letter is not to praise but to
warn.
The Adolph Coors Company
is privately owned and oper
ated, and they have the right to
establish rules concerning the
hiring and firing of their

employees, without the
meddling of government
agencies. When a movement
such as the boycott is initiated
here at the University, and if
enough publicity is given to it,
the federal government invari
ably feels that it has to become
involved.
As a result, a new plethora of
laws is passed and a precious
segment of the private domain
of this country is usurped. This
results -in higher taxes, more
bureaucracy, higher prices and
less-efficient service from the
private producer. Obviously,
this is not a desirable consequ
ence, as we, the citizens, pay
the price.
The controversy over hiring
practices is therefore between
the company, its employees,
and those consumers which
buy the Coors product. Any
changes in the Coors policy

should come from pressure
supplied through this interac
tion, and nowhere else.
After reading about the hir
ing controversy, I am in ag
reement with the boycott
committee as I find some of the
Coors policy unnecessary and
inappropriate. However, if the
great, snarling mass of
bureaucractic injustice worms
its way into the matter, I think
we are obliged as citizens to
protect the right of private in
dividuals to conduct their own
business without having to
fight the federal government
snake any more than is abso
lutely necessary.
For the sake of the country,
let's keep justice and power in
the hands of the private citi
zen.
