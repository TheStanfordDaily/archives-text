## Exposing University secrets 
### 
There is an incredible fraud going on
right under our noses, yet no one seems to
be noticing.
First, take the ASSU Course Guide for
winter quarter. In the Classics section it
lists a course called "Greek Mythology and
Religion." It was written that one student
commented that this is a good course to
take if you are interested in "knowledge
for knowledge's sake."
Second, some of the male students here
are being led astray by an inscription on
the wall of the third floor men's restroom
in Meyer Library which reads: "SLE (Struc
tured Liberal Education) is pre-reg (sic) to
good country club living. You learn a lot of
good stuff to talk about while sailing and
snorting coke."
Each quarter thousands of unsuspecting
students (including some from theapplied
sciences who should know better) enroll
in notorious liberal arts courses such as
these mentioned above. The students are
expecting to escape into a fairy land of
flighty poetry and obscure philosophy.
They have been convinced that they are
paying to receive "knowledge for know
ledge's sake." But they have been malici
ously deceived.
What they are learning is not utterly
without application.
Before I go on I must admit that I, too,
have been taken by unscrupulous
educators. And I am one of those "fuzzy
studies" students who must be careful
about maintaining my anti-practical im
age. In the past I have signed up for such
courses without hesitation. But now that
some new information has come to light, I
feel obliged to warn the rest of you.
When it was discovered (via informants I
suspect) that I was planning to spill the
beans, the dean's office here contacted
the one man they knew could keep me

silent: Phil. His full name is Philo the Av
enger, but everyone calls him Phil for
short.
Phil startled me the other day as I walked
into my room. He had climbed in through
the window and was sitting, waiting for me
to return. Phil is tall and muscular and has
one of those pock-marked faces. In short,
he's not the kind of guy you say no to. I
prepared for battle.
"Sit down," he said. "I have a serious
matter to discuss with you." My courage
held fast.
"Let's get to the point," he continued.
"You know and I know that these liberal
arts courses actually do teach students
something they can use."
"Yes. I know," I said.
"But we can't let anyone else know that
or the entire program will collapse. No
one will take liberal arts classes any more,"
he said.
"You're right. But this sham cannot go
on any longer, Phil. The public must know
that they're not getting what they paid
for," I protested.
Then he got rough.
"You still have some time here, don't
you? I could make it very miserable for
you. I can make sure that you never get
into another genuinely useless liberal arts
course. We still have some of those, you
know. But it won t be hard to exclude you.
It'll ruin your whole image. And then what
will happen to your good country club liv
ing?" he said, glowering at me.
I screwed up my courage. "Just admit
that you're teaching these poor helpless
students something useful and get it over
with. You may strike me down, Phil, but
there will beothersafterme," I said firmly.
He looked frustrated. He knew that if
something happened to me, it would only
draw attention to the scandal; he might
even be risking making a martyr out of me.

Brute force was out. He tried to evoke my
pity.
"What do you think is going to happen
to the libera! arts if people find out our
secret," he asked with tears rolling down
his cheeks. "Do you want students to find
out that studying Greek or Roman or
European history will give them a clearer
understanding of today's world? That they
can make use of the lessons of our ances
tors in religion, science, art, politics and
economics? That they can study the virtues
and vices of great men and apply what
they've learned to their very own lives?"
Now he was down on his knees, shak
ing. "Do you really want them to know that
we are actually teaching some people how
to think clearly and creatively?" He
paused, almost breathless now. Then he
forced it out. "How to solve
even . . . practical problems of life."
I could see he was suffering. I tried to
comfort him. "Don't worry old boy. It's
not the end of the world. In fact, now that I
think about it, I'll bet the decline in en
rollment will probably be very small. After
all, who's going to believe me? Years and
years of constant drilling by parents,
friends, guidance counselors, teachers
and employers have convinced most of
your students that what you are teaching is
totally worthless.
"I don't see how I'm going to blot all that
out with one measly article," I said.
"They'll probably just keep right on sign
ing up for those classes like lambs being
led to slaughter." '
It was no good. Phil couldn't stop sob
bing. He refused to believe that his bubble
wouldn't burst under the scrutiny of the
press as those of Nixon and Wayne Hays
had before him.
