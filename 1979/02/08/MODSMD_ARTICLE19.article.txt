## Extracurriculars popular here

(Third of a series.)
What role do extracurricular
activities play in the life of an
undergraduate here?
The Extracurricular Commit
tee of the Little Eleven Confer
ence is seeking to respond to
that question. Clearly, there is
an immense number of organi
zations at the University which
are run primarily by students
and which exist separately
from "academic life" here.
They include political groups,
women's groups, ethnic or
ganizations, ministries, media
and publications, production
groups, pre-professional
groups, as well as athletics,
hobbies and recreational
groups.
On the average, extracur
ricular activities play an integ
ral part in a student's life here;
in fact, judging from the
number and percentage of par
ticipants, these activities may
play a larger role here than at
other campuses.
Many students at the Univer
sity spend as much, if not
more, time involved in some
form of extracurricular activity
as in academic activities. This is
illustrated by the fact that, in
the athletic and recreational
area (including intercollegiate
sports, club sports, I.M. s,

conditioning, P.E. instruction
and dance), over 12,000 stu
dents participate each year.
Since the Little Eleven Con
ference was first proposed
here during fall quarter, stu
dents interested in extracur
ricular activities have formed a
committee to research and
compile information regarding
this facet of undergraduate
life.
To begin this task, a ques
tionnaire was sent to over 150
extracurricular organizations
on campus, posing the follow
ing questions: How is this or
ganization funded? Specifi
cally, how is it run? What kind
of membership does it in
clude? What are its main pur
poses and goals? What prob
lems does it have? And, how
does it relate to University life
as a whole?
Members of the committee
have also been interviewing
key organizations within each
category of interest. In doing
so, the committee hopes to not
only gather information for the
conference, but also to com
pile a complete list and accom
panying handbook of extracur
ricular activities and organiza
tions here.
While the Office of Student
Affairs (OSA) has published a
list of voluntary organizations
at the University, this list is in
complete and fragmented.
One of the reasons for this is
that the OSA list only encom
passes those organizations
which have officially registered
with the office. Thus, many of
the major organizations on
campus have been over
looked, such as the Daily,
KZSU and Hillel. Furthermore,
there is no centralized re
source providing cohesion
among the various groups.
In response to this problem,
the Extracurricular Committee
plans not only to make use of

its report at the conference it
self, but to submit a copy to the
Council of Presidents, as a
basis for a general handbook
for students. In this way, enter
ing students will be able to
choose their activities with full
knowledge of all of their op
tions here.
Therefore, this committee's
work will not end after the con
ference; we hope to encour
age general student support in
restructuring the role of ex
tracurricular organizations
here into a more comprehen
sible and cohesive whole.

It is hoped that the perspec
tives gained by attending the
conference will stimulate un
dergraduates here to become
involved in shaping extra
curricular policy. Anyone who
is interested in working on any
aspect of these issues is en
couraged to contact us
through the Extracurricular
Committee of the Little Eleven
Conference in the ASSU Of
fice.
