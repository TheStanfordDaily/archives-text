Burn Baby Burn
Students in Mirreelees' second floor were forced to evacuate their rooms early last night as a stove-top grease fire
sent smoke billowing through the halls. After two attempts to locate a workable fire extinguisher, Department of
Public Safety firemen did extinguish the fire. No one was injured except one fireman who was cut on the
forehead.
