# California environmentalists search for legislative victories
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — The California environ
mental movement, which piled up several sig
nificant legislative victories in the early 19705, is
finding success harder to come by these days.
Environmentalists have had victories in the
Legislature in the last few years, but often they
have been defensive ones warding off chal
lenges to existing programs.
In most cases, the major gains sought by en
vironmentalists — in particular, protection of
prime agricultural land — have eluded them.
Environmental lobbyists cite several reasons
for the slump, including Proposition 13, political
clout of business and labor and the preoccupa
tion of many voters with inflation, taxes and
government spending.
But Proposition 13, by cutting the property
taxes which local governments may collect from
new developments, may itself become a major
force against projects which environmentalists
oppose.
Some critics blame the environmental move
ment's troubles on a public backlash caused by
environmental overkill.
John Zierold, dean of environmental lobbyists
in Sacramento: "There's no question we've
been on the defensive for the last several years.
"That is due more than anything else to a
different kind of legislature. Today almost any
thing that bears the label Proposition 13 has
become tremendously popular. In 1970 or 1971,
almost everyone had some sort of ecology bill."
Carl Pope of the League of Conservation Vot
ers: "Things have gotten much tougher in the
Legislature. The things we want now bite deeper

into other interests."
David Abelson of the Planning and Conserva
tion League: "I don't think there has been a
complete drought. It's more a question of fight
ing a defensive battle with some successes less
ballyhooed than earlier ones."
In the late 1960s and early to mid-19705, pubic
concern over the environment helped produce
a series of major ecology laws, some enacted
only after initiative had reached the ballot or was
approved by voters.
They included measures setting up a coastal
protection system, placing a moratorium on
new nuclear power plants, banning additional
dams on several Northern California rivers and
raising air quality standards.
But in the last two or three years, things have
changed. Repeated attempts to push through a
bill to protect prime farm land from develop
ment have failed.
So have efforts to ban no-desposit beer and
soft-drink containers, ban dams on two sections
of the Stanislaus River, toughen penalties for oil
spills, ban aerial spraying of some herbicides
and forbid development of an on-shore
liquefied natural gas terminal.
Two of the most notable victories have been
defensive ones: successful defenses of the nuc
lear moratorium and the defeat of bills abolish
ing the state Energy Commission.
The Legislature has approved bills to toughen
environmental controls at LakeTahoe, but so far
most of those moves have been futile because
California and Nevada failed to agree on how
strong controls should be.
