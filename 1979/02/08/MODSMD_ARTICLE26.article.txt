# ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT
## Rock/richard guante Great extracurricular talents 
### 
In searching for live en
tertainment we too often
fail to look beyond our own
backyard. Unfortunate, but
true. Ostensibly, Stanford
students are admitted to
this university for extra
curricular talents as well as
intellectual ability. If this is,
in fact, the case, then we
should hear great talent
emanating from our hal-

lowed halls, right? Abso
lutely right. And great Stan
ford talent is just what a
crowded Junipero lounge
was treated to last Friday
evening.
Fred Hargadon knew
what he was doing when he
admitted the nine musicians
who entertained an ap
preciative audience of fel
low students in a three-hour
showcase. Opening the

show were John Triska and
Bert Keely as J&B: A Rare
Blend. Beginning with an
America tune and running
through a delightful pair of
originals (including "The
Ballad of J&B" —a song bely
ing their claim to be hard
working students), John
and Bert displayed fine
adaptations of songs by Neil
Young and Bowie, among

others. Both utilized in
teresting echo touches and
perfect harmonies to great
musical effect.
Rapport
An impo r tant part of J&B's
appeal was their rapport
with the audience and with
each other. They traded
jokes back and forth and
acted as if the audience was
actually a group of friends in
their own living room. John

summed up the mood best,
numerous times, as he
commented "This is a
blast."
This talented and enter
taining duo can be heard at
the Black Horse in Burlin
game for the next few Friday
nights, and at The Station on
March 10. Pastel, featuring
Mike Sternberg, David
Hwang, Harmon Wang,

Dave Newmark, Jeff Fraas,
and Ed Manning, then took
the stage and proceeded to
electrify the crowd with
their brand of pop/jazz fu
sion.
Playing in styles ranging
from mellow Kenny Rankin
to Latin-flavored James
Taylor and a funkified ver
sion of the Talking Heads'
hit "Take Me To The River,"
filled the lounge with crisp,

clear rhythms and
arrangements — showing
great versatility. David
Hwang highlighted the per
formance with soaring vio
lin solos.
Ending their too-brief set
with a brilliant version of
Deodato's "Superstrut,"
the band was called back
and encored with a strong
original by Mike Sternberg.
This group can be heard on
March 10 at The Station.
Electric blend
Adlai Alexander,
guitarist/singer/songwriter,
closed the show with his un
ique, eclectic blend of folk
and funk influenced bal
lads. A combination of orig
inals and creative arrange
ments of Kenny Rankin and
The Beatles made for a
pleasant, entertaining set.
Although Adlai was not
supported by a back-up
band, he was able to weave
intricate and full sounds
with acoustic guitar and
masterful vocal control and
range. The only question
regarding Adlai's musical
future seems to be whether
his vocal talents, guitar vir
tuosity, or songwriting abil
ity will be his claim to fame.
The show, which was
produced by a student
ov> 'led promotion firm, was
a success. In addition to
providing a good time forall
and a chance for students to
display their ample talents,
this show also points to a
need for such shows in the
future.
