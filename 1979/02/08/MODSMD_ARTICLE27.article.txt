## Jazz guitarist to appear tonight 
### 
Noted jazz guitarist Joe Pass will appear at the Encina Station
(formerly the Commons) tonight. Pass will perform two
shows, at 8:30 and 10:30.
Pass has long been noted as one of the foremost solo
guitarists in jazz. While most jazz guitarists need a rhythm
section for support, Pass can and does play amazingly intricate
solo guitar. To date he has released three solo albums on the
Pablo label, each of which has been heralded as a majoralbum
by jazz guitar fans. His technique, in my opinion, is un
matched by any other guitarist in jazz.
This year critics and fans have agreed with me, as Pass was
named winner of both the Down Beat reader's poll and critic's
poll as best guitarist of the year. The reader's poll victory was
particularly impressive when one considers that Pass was
competing against much more popular and commerical artists
such as George Benson, Al DiMeola and others.
Pass, unlike many contemporary jazz guitarists, works
primarily with standard tunes. Songs such as "Summertime,"

"Sweet Georgia Brown," and "Satin Doll," form the greater
part of his repertoire. The sheer number of which Pass
knows is in itself impressive. When I saw him at a Small solo
club date in Los Angeles, several years back, he played a great
number of audience requests, spanning from "Rhapsody in
Blue," to "You are the Sunshine of My Life."
The past few years has seen Pass working with some of the
most important names in jazz. His collaborations with Oscar
Peterson, Ella Dizzy Gillespie and others have been
particularly exciting. In addition Pass recorded with Duke El
lington in one of the last albums the Duke made before his
death. Still Pass's most rewarding work, for me, has been his
solo playing.
John Handy brings his group to the Encina Station next week
and will also give a free clinic at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Yusef
Lateef comes to Stanford the following week with his new
fusion band.
