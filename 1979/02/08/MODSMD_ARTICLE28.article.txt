## Innovative women in jazz 
### 
The past several years
have seen the emergence of
several influential women
on the jazz scene. Three re
cent releases by female jazz
pianists serve to document
the increasing importance
of women in this largely
male-dominated field.
Mary Lou Williams is, of
course, no newcomer to the
jazz world. She has been
one of the most consistently
innovative musicians in jazz
since her early work with

Andy Kirk. She was one of
the first swing pianists to
embrace be-bop, while her
work in the '50s
foreshadowed, in many
ways, later work by the
avant-garde.
Mary Lou Williams' latest
release is a highly listenable
collection of songs entitled
My Mama Pinned a Rose on
Me. Recent years have been
Mary Lou become more and
more dependent on the
blues in her music, and this
recent album is no excep
tion. Roughly half of the
numbers on the album are
blues — some fast, some
slow — and demonstrate
William's remarkable
rhythmic control.
Blues, potentially, can be
a very limited form, but in
the hands of a master such
as Mary Lou Williams they
can be evocative of infinite
variety of moods. Duke El
lington once remarked that
the blues are not a song of
sorrow, but rather a song of
romantic failure. For Wil
liams the blues can just as

well be a shout of jubilation
as a mournful lament.
Mary Lou is ably assisted
by the bassist Buster Wil
liams, a jazz veteran who is
becoming more and more
acclaimed as time goes on.
Buster Williams (no relation
to Mary Lou) has been an
integral part of the Ron Car
ter Quartet during the past
several years in addition to
his yeoman work with such
disparate luminaries of the
jazz world as Miles Davis
and Jimmy Rowles. Oneof
the most touching moments
on the album is Mary Lou's
rendition of Buster Wil
liams' composition
"Prism."
Another stalwart of the
jazz piano — Toshiko
Akiyoshi — has released a
very attractive album on the
Concord label. Finesse is
the album's title, and is also
a very accurate description
of Akiyoshi's talents as a
pianist. Her work with the
Akiyoshi-Tabackin big band
has often forced her to neg
lect her solo playing during
the past several years. Vet
when she wants to (and I re
call a memorable solo
number she did during her
appearance at Berkeley Last
year) she can demonstrate
her multifaceted talents on
the piano. The songs on her
latest album are mostly slow
and medium tempo; she
does a gorgeously medita
tive version of an old Billie
Holiday song "You Go to
My Head," and dips even
fartherback into jazz history
to do a stately version of
Jelly Roll Morton's song
"Mr. Jelly Lord."
Akiyoshi's playing has
mellowed with the years.
Her early idol was Bud Pow
ell and her first albums
often display the manic in
tensity with which Powell
approached the keyboard.
Her work of the Finesse
album is more controlled
and supple. Part of the cre
dit for this belongs to
drummer Jake Hanna who is

the foremost expert on re
fined swing. Hanna is a reg
ular member of Concord
recording sessions, and I
never cease to be amazed at
his tasteful and energetic
playing. There are so few
drummers of this brand still
around — I can think of Mel
Lewis and )o Jones — that
his appearance on any
album is something to be
grateful for.
The youngest member of
the pianists I am discussing
is also a recent addition to
the Bay Area music scene
(so I am told). Her name is
Jessica Williams (no relation
to either Mary Lou or Bus
ter)and she is one of the
best kept secrets in the jazz
world. Her technique is
completely flawless and the
range of her music is equally
remarkable. Her album Por
traits is from the small Adel
phi label, and is one of the
most powerful demonstra
tions of solo piano I have

heard in quite a while. The
album is a tape of a live con
cert in which Williams im
provised musical portraits
of various people in her life
(some of whom were in the
audience). The music
ranges from the harmoni
cally daring to the melodi
cally expressive; while the
encore rendition of the
standard "My Romance" is
worth the price of the album
alone. This album is difficult
to find in record stores
(even by jazz standards),
but still, I cannot imagine
that (essica Williams will
remain a secret for long.

around — I can think of Mel
Lewis and )o Jones — that
his appearance on any
album is something to be
grateful for.
The youngest member of
the pianists I am discussing
is also a recent addition to
the Bay Area music scene
(so I am told). Her name is
Jessica Williams (no relation
to either Mary Lou or Bus
ter)and she is one of the
best kept secrets in the jazz
world. Her technique is
completely flawless and the
range of her music is equally
remarkable. Her album Por
traits is from the small Adel
phi label, and is one of the
most powerful demonstra
tions of solo piano I have

heard in quite a while. The
album is a tape of a live con
cert in which Williams im
provised musical portraits
of various people in her life
(some of whom were in the
audience). The music
ranges from the harmoni
cally daring to the melodi
cally expressive; while the
encore rendition of the
standard "My Romance" is
worth the price of the album
alone. This album is difficult
to find in record stores
(even by jazz standards),
but still, I cannot imagine
that (essica Williams will
remain a secret for long.


The past several years
have seen the emergence of
several influential women
on the jazz scene. Three re
cent releases by female jazz
pianists serve to document
the increasing importance
of women in this largely
male-dominated field.
Mary Lou Williams is, of
course, no newcomer to the
jazz world. She has been
one of the most consistently
innovative musicians in jazz
since her early work with

Andy Kirk. She was one of
the first swing pianists to
embrace be-bop, while her
work in the '50s
foreshadowed, in many
ways, later work by the
avant-garde.
Mary Lou Williams' latest
release is a highly listenable
collection of songs entitled
My Mama Pinned a Rose on
Me. Recent years have been
Mary Lou become more and
more dependent on the
blues in her music, and this
recent album is no excep
tion. Roughly half of the
numbers on the album are
blues — some fast, some
slow — and demonstrate
William's remarkable
rhythmic control.
Blues, potentially, can be
a very limited form, but in
the hands of a master such
as Mary Lou Williams they
can be evocative of infinite
variety of moods. Duke El
lington once remarked that
the blues are not a song of
sorrow, but rather a song of
romantic failure. For Wil
liams the blues can just as

well be a shout of jubilation
as a mournful lament.
Mary Lou is ably assisted
by the bassist Buster Wil
liams, a jazz veteran who is
becoming more and more
acclaimed as time goes on.
Buster Williams (no relation
to Mary Lou) has been an
integral part of the Ron Car
ter Quartet during the past
several years in addition to
his yeoman work with such
disparate luminaries of the
jazz world as Miles Davis
and Jimmy Rowles. Oneof
the most touching moments
on the album is Mary Lou's
rendition of Buster Wil
liams' composition
"Prism."
Another stalwart of the
jazz piano — Toshiko
Akiyoshi — has released a
very attractive album on the
Concord label. Finesse is
the album's title, and is also
a very accurate description
of Akiyoshi's talents as a
pianist. Her work with the
Akiyoshi-Tabackin big band
has often forced her to neg
lect her solo playing during
the past several years. Vet
when she wants to (and I re
call a memorable solo
number she did during her
appearance at Berkeley Last
year) she can demonstrate
her multifaceted talents on
the piano. The songs on her
latest album are mostly slow
and medium tempo; she
does a gorgeously medita
tive version of an old Billie
Holiday song "You Go to
My Head," and dips even
fartherback into jazz history
to do a stately version of
Jelly Roll Morton's song
"Mr. Jelly Lord."
Akiyoshi's playing has
mellowed with the years.
Her early idol was Bud Pow
ell and her first albums
often display the manic in
tensity with which Powell
approached the keyboard.
Her work of the Finesse
album is more controlled
and supple. Part of the cre
dit for this belongs to
drummer Jake Hanna who is

the foremost expert on re
fined swing. Hanna is a reg
ular member of Concord
recording sessions, and I
never cease to be amazed at
his tasteful and energetic
playing. There are so few
drummers of this brand still
around — I can think of Mel
Lewis and )o Jones — that
his appearance on any
album is something to be
grateful for.
