## Cindy Bullens shakes things up 
### 
At what point do you stop calling a girl a girl and start calling
her a woman?
No, this /s a record review, not a human sexuality discourse.
But, consider a case in point — Cindy Bullens, teenage rock
star, whose debut album offers ample proof of this woman's
ability to express feelings and stories an unassuming listener
might expect to come from someone a decade older.
You- I've had my fill
The way you make me fit
Into your life
And I don't need to be
An obligation
A bill for useless phone calls
In the night
Clearly, this lady's been around. Her songs evoke memories
of anxiousness, strained relationships, and female assertive
ness. Pretty strong stuff for any rock'n'roll album, making this
debut even more surprising and enjoyable.
Her voice embodies all the contradictions of her persona —
the sound is ever so young, yet there is a knowingly tough
quality here, giving her vocals a raw edge on the grittier rock
tunes on the disk.
The album, Desire Wire, produced by Tony Bongiovi and
Lance Quinn, allows Bullens to show her tough and tender
sides.
"Survivor," which opens the album, explodes with sweet
anger at a failed lover. "Anxious Heart" and "Desire Wire"
shows Bullens at her most vulnerable — her need for men that
aren't, or can't or won't be there. Vet the music's strength
provides a backdrop of determination reminiscent of the horn

and string crescendos on Boz Scaggs' blues classic, "Loan Me
A Dime."
"Knee Deep In Love" has Bullens' tenderness minus the
strength of a powerful rock arrangement. The soft Cindy Bul
lens is a very attractive side, yet the fact that it is just one side of
her, is proof of the range of her talents-and feelings.
At a recent concert at the Old Waldorf, Bullens showed
she's learned well from some of rock's best live performers.
She strutted and pouted like vintage Jagger, jumped around
like Springsteen, and crooned like Carly Simon.
But this was clearly an "X" rated act. What Bullens has done,
is to go beyond her peer/mentors and ventured into uninhi
bited expressive sexual acting, surpassing even Tina Turner at
her raunchiest. And through it all, her smile, her goading wit,
indicated she was having a blast.
Vicki, a Berkeley student and friend, said after the show,
"part of me really loved her, but another part said, 'what right
does she have to be that good so young?' I never was like that.
But I guess it's okay to have both feelings at once."
Exactly.
It wasn't that long ago, when you could have tit the number
of female rock stars into a telephone booth comfortably. But
Heart, Valery Carter, Dyan Diamond, and now Cindy Bullens
offer encouraging evidence women may be shaking rock out
of its sexist doldrums.
And if Bullens is any example of what's coming along, the
next few years should be very interesting. Vet everi if she's the
exception and not the rule, her surprising arrival is certainly
welcome, and long overdue.
