On Friday, Feb. 9, the Commit
tee on Black Performing Arts at
Stanford will sponsor a one-time
benefit performance in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium of Sizwe Bansi is
Dead. The proceeds of the perfor
mance will benefit Big Sisters of
East Palo Alto.
Sizwe Bansi is Dead is a modern
masterpiece which brings to the
American stage, via Capetown,
South Africa, a unique, incisive,
and sensitive examination of the
psychological destruction of
human beings which is all-too
characteristic of the oppressive
apartheid system. The two-man
drama will be performed by
Carl Lumbly (on left) and Danny
Glover (on right) of the Oakland
Ensemble Theater.
Sizwe Bansi is Dead is a mul
tidimensional tour de force that
should be missed by no one. The
curtain goes up at 8:00 p.m. Admis
sion is $3.00 for students, $5.00 for
the public.
