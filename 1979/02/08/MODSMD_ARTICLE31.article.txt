## Once more with meaning? 
### 
The most positive thing I
can say about Ice Castles is
that it could have been
worse. The film advertises
itself as an adolescent ro
mance in which love con
quers all, even blindness.
There are many examples of
how low this genre can sink,
and Ice Castles avoids the
worst of this fate. But in
sidestepping this trap it
steps into a much deeper
and more dangerous pit: it
tries to be a high drama but
only succeeds in tripping it
self on its own stilted ideas.
The romantic core of the
film is the story of a farm girl
from Waverley, lowa with a
gift for skating who is spot
ted by an Olympic coach;
she is blinded at the peak of
her success and is taught to
skate and compete again by
her true love. The first
dramatic twist added to the
story is showing how the
girl's natural gift is distorted
by the pressure of interna
tional competition. The
second twist lies in making
her boyfriend unsure of his
own future and finding the
answer by helping the one
he loves.
Unfortunately these de
velopments unfold in an a
confusing and half
explained way. Skater Lexie
(Lynn-Holly lohnson) and
boyfriend (Robby Benson)
never show their love
beyond the level of open
mouth kissing. The unreal
ity of their relationship
makes it hard to accept the
tense moments generated
as Lexie rises to national
fame while her boyfriend
struggles with uncertainty.
Lexie's own battles with the
stresses of success are
weakly, if at all, portrayed
with acting, dialogue or
cinematic devices. The most
telling clue to the changes
within her is the over

wrought contrast between
the elegant music used in
her first competition and
the glossy pop music used
to choreograph her net
work TV appearance.
The portrayals of the indi
vidual characters only add
to the confusion. Lexie and
those near to herare not the
small-town people they are
implied to be. The con
stantly step out of line to as
sert uncharacteristic ideas
in uncharacteristic ways.
And what about Robby
Benson? Though he has top
billing in the film, he is ab
sent for a good part of its
action, He appears in the
scenes depicting Lexie's rise
to stardom only long
enough to call her on the
phone and see her win the
regionals. When he does fi
nally step into the story after
Lexie's blinding his pre
sence does nothing to re
solve the movie's problems.
He is unbelievable as a farm
boy. His presence is too
animalistic to fit in with his
surroundings or into the
character he is to portray.
He comes off merely as
Robby Benson.
To make matters worse he
takes advantage of his star
dom to become the most
flagrant violator of character
in the film. He insists on
playing up the two themes
of his earlier films, and they
fit no better here than
elsewhere. He has to be the
lost youth who doesn't want
to be like everybody else
but doesn't know what to
do with himself.
Even more obnoxious is
his "you gotta try"
philosophy. The idea isn't
very deep to begin with and
the dialogue used to pre
sent it only puts it in a worse
light. When trying to con
vince his girlfriend to skate
again he says,"I don't know

if she can do it, but she's got
to try." Why? "For both of
us." Heavy-handed scenes
like this are common. Ben
son, throughout the movie,
insists on being himself —
he has not yet learned to
step back, observe and
learn about others, and be-,
come an actor in portraying
characters as they are.
Little else in the film is
worthwhile. The acting is
uniformly stereotyped and
thoughtless. Johnson's skat
ing is excellent, but the best
she can do to portray a blind
girl is to keep a totally blank
expression.
The cinematography and
editing are stock to trite.
There was much wonderful
skating in the film but it is
never portrayed in a beauti
ful way for those of us not
familiar with skating's
nuances. Marvin Hamlisch's
score was disappointing.
Some of the skating accom
paniment was thoughtful
but other pieces were abso
lutely melodramatic, and
the score was overworked
and more fitting for The
Other Side of Midnight.
Seen more superficially
the film does have its
strong points. The adoles
cent girls in the audience
seemed to enjoy them
selves, particularly during
the making-out scenes, and
the older males appreciated
Lynn-Holly Johnson's strik
ing good looks. Ice Castles
will probably give a hand
some, if not astounding, re
turn on its investment. But
the film might have been
better had it attempted only
to be an adolescent ro
mance. In its abortive at
tempt to be meaningful, Ice
Castles has both confused
its younger viewers and dis
appointed those of us who
appreciate an occasional
good drama.

her true love. The first
dramatic twist added to the
story is showing how the
girl's natural gift is distorted
by the pressure of interna
tional competition. The
second twist lies in making
her boyfriend unsure of his
own future and finding the
answer by helping the one
he loves.
Unfortunately these de
velopments unfold in an a
confusing and half
explained way. Skater Lexie
(Lynn-Holly lohnson) and
boyfriend (Robby Benson)
never show their love
beyond the level of open
mouth kissing. The unreal
ity of their relationship
makes it hard to accept the
tense moments generated
as Lexie rises to national
fame while her boyfriend
struggles with uncertainty.
Lexie's own battles with the
stresses of success are
weakly, if at all, portrayed
with acting, dialogue or
cinematic devices. The most
telling clue to the changes
within her is the over

wrought contrast between
the elegant music used in
her first competition and
the glossy pop music used
to choreograph her net
work TV appearance.
The portrayals of the indi
vidual characters only add
to the confusion. Lexie and
those near to herare not the
small-town people they are
implied to be. The con
stantly step out of line to as
sert uncharacteristic ideas
in uncharacteristic ways.
And what about Robby
Benson? Though he has top
billing in the film, he is ab
sent for a good part of its
action, He appears in the
scenes depicting Lexie's rise
to stardom only long
enough to call her on the
phone and see her win the
regionals. When he does fi
nally step into the story after
Lexie's blinding his pre
sence does nothing to re
solve the movie's problems.
He is unbelievable as a farm
boy. His presence is too
animalistic to fit in with his
surroundings or into the
character he is to portray.
He comes off merely as
Robby Benson.
To make matters worse he
takes advantage of his star
dom to become the most
flagrant violator of character
in the film. He insists on
playing up the two themes
of his earlier films, and they
fit no better here than
elsewhere. He has to be the
lost youth who doesn't want
to be like everybody else
but doesn't know what to
do with himself.
Even more obnoxious is
his "you gotta try"
philosophy. The idea isn't
very deep to begin with and
the dialogue used to pre
sent it only puts it in a worse
light. When trying to con
vince his girlfriend to skate
again he says,"I don't know

if she can do it, but she's got
to try." Why? "For both of
us." Heavy-handed scenes
like this are common. Ben
son, throughout the movie,
insists on being himself —
he has not yet learned to
step back, observe and
learn about others, and be-,
come an actor in portraying
characters as they are.
Little else in the film is
worthwhile. The acting is
uniformly stereotyped and
thoughtless. Johnson's skat
ing is excellent, but the best
she can do to portray a blind
girl is to keep a totally blank
expression.
The cinematography and
editing are stock to trite.
There was much wonderful
skating in the film but it is
never portrayed in a beauti
ful way for those of us not
familiar with skating's
nuances. Marvin Hamlisch's
score was disappointing.
Some of the skating accom
paniment was thoughtful
but other pieces were abso
lutely melodramatic, and
the score was overworked
and more fitting for The
Other Side of Midnight.
Seen more superficially
the film does have its
strong points. The adoles
cent girls in the audience
seemed to enjoy them
selves, particularly during
the making-out scenes, and
the older males appreciated
Lynn-Holly Johnson's strik
ing good looks. Ice Castles
will probably give a hand
some, if not astounding, re
turn on its investment. But
the film might have been
better had it attempted only
to be an adolescent ro
mance. In its abortive at
tempt to be meaningful, Ice
Castles has both confused
its younger viewers and dis
appointed those of us who
appreciate an occasional
good drama.
The most positive thing I
can say about Ice Castles is
that it could have been
worse. The film advertises
itself as an adolescent ro
mance in which love con
quers all, even blindness.
There are many examples of
how low this genre can sink,
and Ice Castles avoids the
worst of this fate. But in
sidestepping this trap it
steps into a much deeper
and more dangerous pit: it
tries to be a high drama but
only succeeds in tripping it
self on its own stilted ideas.
The romantic core of the
film is the story of a farm girl
from Waverley, lowa with a
gift for skating who is spot
ted by an Olympic coach;
she is blinded at the peak of
her success and is taught to
skate and compete again by
her true love. The first
dramatic twist added to the
story is showing how the
girl's natural gift is distorted
by the pressure of interna
tional competition. The
