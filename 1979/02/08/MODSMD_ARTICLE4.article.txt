Despite a 300-student sleep-in at
Cubberley High School in Palo Alto
Tuesday night, trustees decided by a
3-2 vote to ignore student protest
and close the 24-year-old high school
in |une.
More than 600 concerned parents
and students packed the Palo Alto
High School auditorium Tuesday
night to hear the Palo Alto Unified
School District Board of Trustees
make its decision.
Because of Proposition 13 and de
clining enrollment in the district, a
school closure was "inevitable," said
one administrator. But controversy
had surrounded which of three high
schools to close.
Stanford lands
One of the main reasons for clos
ing Cubberley was because the other
two high schools — Cunn and Palo

Alto High — are on Stanford lands. If
those buildings were sold and used
for non-educational purposes, the
land would revert to Stanford,
explained Cubberley principal Frank
Seeley.
Closure of Cubberley will result in
about an $800,000 savings per year,
even before the land is sold, adminis
trators estimate. Cubberley and its
lands havea market value of $9tosll
million.
"There's been a lot of emotion sur
rounding this issue," Seeley said.
"We think our kids will be fine once
they are integrated into the other
schools'. This year's juniors are going
to suffer the most, however, so we're
considering having two persons in
every senior leadership position —
two student body presidents, two
yearbook editors, and so on."

Administrators have not yet
worked out the redistricting for the
schools, but it appears that no matter
what new distribution of students is
used, one high school will be over
crowded.
"We've been losing about 50 to 75
students each yearbecauseof declin
ing enrollment and it doesn't look
like this is going to let up," Seeley
said. "The overcrowded situations
next year may only be temporary,"
he explained.
Although most of the debate had
centered around whether to close
Cubberley or Gunn, one woman
spoke in favor of closing Palo Alto
High at the meeting Tuesday night.
"It's the worst school I've ever
been in and the third worst public
institution I've been in," she said.
"The other two were jail and (Santa
Clara) Valley Medical Center."
