Teng says U.S. bungled in Iran
Tokyo — Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping,
fresh from a trip to America, told Japanese leaders
yesterday the United States showed a lack of direc
tion on Iran and mishandled the crisis there, a
spokesman reported.
Teng told former Premier Takeo Fukuda that the
United States has shown indecision and that "the
United States' handling of the crisis lacks direc
tion," Fukuda's secretary Yoshiro Mori told repor
ters.
Teng stopped in Japan for two days of talks with
Japanese leaders after his four-city tour of the Un
ited States. He called on the former Premier be
cause Fukuda was in office when the Chinese-
Japanse peace and friendship treaty was signed
last year.
The Chinese official told Fukuda he thought the
Russians were already in Iran and that they would
surely become a destabilizing influence on the
area, Mori said.
The secretary quoted Teng as saying the United
States "is allowing the Soviet Union to place a lot
of pawns on the world's chessboard" and "things
cannot be allowed to go on this way."
Teng called for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from
South Korea, but also urged Washington to check
Soviet expansionism in other parts of the world,
Mori said.
"Should the U.S. troops leave South Korea, they
will still be near by, so it will not affect the stability
of the region...But it would be better for both
Taiwan and South Korea if the troops were with
drawn," Teng was quoted as saying.
Teng also criticized Vietnam and Cuba, saying
that the United States cannot simply allow Cuba to
increase its influence in Africa, and that some re
straint must be exercised over the activities of Vie
tnam.
Farmers stoke heat of battle
Washington — Jeered and booed by about 300
angry farmers, Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland
softly apologized yesterday to anyone insulted by
his suggestion that some farmers demonstrating
for more government aid are "driven by just old
fashioned greed."
Bergland, speaking before a packed House Ag
riculture Committee hearing, did not withdraw his
remark, however. He reiterated his opposition to
increasing crop price supports and insisted that
1978 "in virtually every respect...was a good year"
for rural America.

The farmers cheered, meanwhile, as several
members of the panel praised their role in the
economy. Rep. Keith Sebelius, (R-Kan)., for exam
ple, declared that "Farmers are the greatest infla
tion fighters we have."
Outside, the city's worst snowfall in years made
conditions even rougher for those of the 3500
American Agriculture movement farmers who
were sleeping by their tractors in their compound
on the Mall, west of the Capitol.
Mandatory gas controls studied
Washington — The Carter administration is con
sidering forcing gasoline stations to close on Sun
days as part of a program to reduce oil consump
tion and build public awareness of the energy
crisis prompted by instability in Iran.
Energy Secretary James Schlesinger told the Se
nate Energy Committee yesterday the administra
tion still hopes voluntary measures will be
enough, but a package of mandatory controls is
being studied.
He ruled out the possibility that gasoline ration
ing would be part of a mandatory conservation
program.
Saying he has seen no indication "that the slide
of Iran toward chaos has been arrested,"
Schlesinger said the cutoff of oil from that Mideast
country is forcing the United States to draw on
reserves to make up part of the 900,000 barrels a
day once imported from Iran.
"Unless we are able to restock for next winter,
our inventories could be dangerously low," he
said.
The secretary said oil consumption could be
reduced by more effective use of new supplies of
natural gas, elimination of unnecessary driving
and adherence to the 55-miles-per-hour speed
limit.
Beyond that, he said several mandatory mea
sures are being considered.
Snowstorm blankets Northeast
A major snowstorm socked the big cities of the
industrial Northeast yesterday, snarling rush-hour
traffic, closing schools and disrupting air travel.
The storm, which blanketed much of Dixie and
the mid-Atlantic states with up to 10 inches of
snow, moved into the Northeast almost a year to
the day after the disastrous Blizzard of '78
paralyzed much of the region.
On its way north, the storm dumped up to 10
inches of snow in Tennessee, 8 inches in some
parts of Virginia, and similar accumulations in

Maryland and Delaware.
An ice storm knocked out power in much of
South Carolina and north Georgia.
Washington's National Airport was closed with 8
inches of snow expected in downtown areas and
10 inches in the suburbs.
Schools were closed throughout the region and
road crews were busy in Pennsylvania, New Jer
sey and New York City.
More Prop 13 relief awarded
Sacramento — An Assembly committee ap
proved a $150 million Proposition 13 relief bill yes
terday to fund hundreds of special districts
through mid-year, but the committee chairman
predicted the measure would be scaled down.
The bill is "wide open. The people said, 'Cut,'"
Assemblyman Eugene Chappie (R-Roseville) told
reporters after abstaining from a 6-0 vote of his
Assembly Local Government Committee.
The measure, SB 31 by Sen. John Nejedly (R-
Walnut Creek) would nearly double the Proposi
tion 13 relief provided last year to the thousands of
districts that run services like sewers, libraries,
parks and pest control.
Many special districts depended almost com
pletely on property tax funds and thus were
among the biggest losers in Proposition 13's 57
percent property tax cut.
The districts were given $162 million from the
$4.1 billion Proposition 13 rescue bill enacted last
summer by the Legislature, compared with an es
timated $292 million reduction in their property
tax revenue.
The situation was aggravated by a provision in
last year's bill giving police and fire services first
call on state funds.

ped 6.84 to 816.01, extending its decline to 43.74.
