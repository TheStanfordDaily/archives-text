Tehran, Iran (AP) — Backers of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini were
reported in control of several city
governments yesterday on the eve of
demonstrations intended to drive
home the religious leader's claim to
the reins of this troubled nation.
In Washington, Energy Secretary
James Schlesinger told the Senate
Energy Committee the Iranian crisis
could leave American oil inventories
"dangerously low" next winter and
force controls, but he said he does
not anticipate gasoline rationing.
Large production
Iran sold about 900,000 barrels of
oil a day to the United States before
strikes hobbled production last fall.
Oil engineer Mehdi Bazargan,
named by Khomeini to form a provi
sional government, announced he
will outline his program and possibly
name ministers tomorrow.
Khomeini's rival government to
the shah-appointed administration
of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar
got support from striking civil ser
vants in the Justice Ministry and in
Bakhtiar's own office and from the
staff of the official Paris news agency
yesterday.
Constitutional referendum
Khomeini aide Ibrahim Yazdi said
the provisional government will try

to operate with civil servants loyal to
Khomeini. The provisional govern
ment is to arrange a referendum on a
constitution that would make Iran an
Islamic republic.
Cities where administrative and
some police functions now are run
by Khomeini backers included Isfa
han, Qom, Shiraz and others espe
cially in southern Iran, reports from
those cities said.
In the western city of Sanandaj, an
armed group attacked a television
station Tuesday night, killing a guard
and destroying cars in the pa king
lot, state radio said.
Bakhtiar's supporters
Yesterday, 8000 supporters of
Bakhtiar's shah-appointed govern
ment gathered at a Tehran sports
stadium to give him backing.
The rally was attended mainly by
middle-and upper-class Iranians,
and was punctuated by slogans back
ing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,
who was forced to leave Iran Jan. 16
by the Khomeini-led masses op
posed to his rule.
Men and women with tears in their
eyes chanted "Long live the shah"
and knelt in homage to the monarch.
Said one woman: "I love my kingand
if I had a little blood in my body I
would give it for my king."
