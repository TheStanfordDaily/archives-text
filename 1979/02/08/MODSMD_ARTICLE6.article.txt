# Foothill College faces cutbacks

### Dianne Cahoon 
"Taken to the ultimate, it's self
destruct," lamented Foothill College
President lames Fitzgerald on the
debilitating effect of Proposition 13
on California community colleges.
Foothill, located in Los Altos Hills,
and DeAnza Community College in
Mountain View have established one
of California's most prosperous
community college districts over the
past decade. Since the state imposed
the large tax reductions encased in
Prop. 13 last June, however, the out
look at Foothill has become bleak.
"We took our pre-13 fiscal rules
and threw them out the window,"
Fitzgerald said.
Planned for growth
Foothill's formerly proposed
budget of $15 million for the current
year had planned for growth and the
expansion of programs and facilities.
The government's formula stipulated
a return to the previous year's $13
million standard, according to
Fitzgerald.
To overcome this substantial cut
back in funding without a flagrant
sacrifice in services, Fitzgerald said
that he "bought a little time."
Foothill authorities chose to invest
their scarce resources in jobs rather
than physical maintenance while de
pleting reserve accounts of $3.3 mill
ion, an 8 percent adjustment of the
entire budget. Forbidden by law to
charge tuition, officials enstated the
maximum 17 student fees allowable.
These single-purpose and a
stringently-limited fees included
items such as a $10 annual health in
surance policy and a chemistry dam
age fee.
Fitzgerald explained that "the
easiest courses to drop are the least

'collegiate' courses," which, ironi
cally, comprise the very backbone of
the idea of community colleges.
Therefore, all of Foothill's adult
education programs were elimi
nated, as well as a popular evening
enrichment series. Several athletic
classes were spared a similar fate,
because they could be changed from
credit to recreational status, wherein
fees could be legitimately collected.
Enrollment fell
Foothill's total fall enrollment fell
to 16,347, an 8.6 percent loss from
autumn 1977. Fitzgerald noted in an
informational memo that the day
time student population plunged
almost 20 percent.
in light of these changes, Foothill
administrators must begin projec
tions forthe next fiscal year now. Yet,
community college executives are
stymied in this role by the lack of
long-term, definitive legislative mea
sures.
Dr. Thomas Fryer, the chancellor
of the Foothill DeAnza Community
College District said in a speech last
October, "The situation is not
growth, steady state or decline, but
total uncertainty ... All I know is
that our funding authorization ex
pires in nine months, and I have no
idea of what comes next. To develop
a rational plan under those condi
tions is insane."
Fitzgerald said that his preliminary
budgetary notice is due Mar. 15, and
the final budget deadline is May 15.
He added that the delay of actual fi
nancial details from the state legisla
ture until July 1 places community
colleges in an "awkward, tight box."
Fitzgerald estimated next year's
decline in spending would be bet

ween 10 and 20 percent, but admit
ted that "underlying the whole thing
is the great unknown."
He said that he has developed a
method of deductive foresight,
which he termed "contingency
planning." More precisely, he will
"assume the worst" eventuality,
which means no more state money,
and instigate a strategy aimed at that
and more moderate levels of in
come. "We are in the process now of
trying to come to grips with that
possibility," he said.
Fitzgerald guessed that "for a vari
ety of reasons we will be smaller next
year. I am notyetat all abletograpple
with how much smaller or in what
way we will be smaller. But, with
fewer dollars, I can only assume we
will have fewer sections of classes,
fewer members of faculty, fewer ad
ministrators, fewer classified
employees and fewer students."
Fitzgerald explained that the real
cost of operating is always more than
predicted costs. Each year money
must be taken from next year's
budget causing future budget prob
lems.
He said that soon savings will
probably be exhausted. Meanwhile,
funds will have to be appropriated
for pressing maintenance problems,
such as leaks, and deteriorating walls
and parking lots. The college's small
emergency fund for these purposes
has not been adequate this year.
Salary improvement
Salary improvements must also be
considered. The present 19-month
interim since the last employee raise
is "unrealistic," according to
Fitzgerald. To assure that technical
classes do not fall behind the rapid
advancements in 20th century
technology, Foothill must purchase
modern equipment, Fitzgerald said.
If enrollment continues to drop,
state aid may decline as well. This
year, the legislature gave community
colleges a lump sum income in the
form of a "bailout bill." Next year,
however, the state may decide to
reinstate its former procedure by
which colleges were alloted gov
ernment funds based upon expected
enrollment.
Fitzgerald said that he believes that
community colleges in California will
continue to face the current down
ward trend for income and enroll

ment for the next three to five years
at which time tuition may be insti
tuted. "I would not think tuition to
be in the best interest of California,"
he added.
Fitzgerald said that he hopes that
"the current trend of conservatism
will plateau out" when the public be
comes aware of its destructive qual
ities. "If we believe in an educated
society, where do we put our
priorities?" he asked.

Fitzgerald guessed that "for a vari
ety of reasons we will be smaller next
year. I am notyetat all abletograpple
with how much smaller or in what
way we will be smaller. But, with
fewer dollars, I can only assume we
will have fewer sections of classes,
fewer members of faculty, fewer ad
ministrators, fewer classified
employees and fewer students."
Fitzgerald explained that the real
cost of operating is always more than
predicted costs. Each year money
must be taken from next year's
budget causing future budget prob
lems.
He said that soon savings will
probably be exhausted. Meanwhile,
funds will have to be appropriated
for pressing maintenance problems,
such as leaks, and deteriorating walls
and parking lots. The college's small
emergency fund for these purposes
has not been adequate this year.
Salary improvement
Salary improvements must also be
considered. The present 19-month
interim since the last employee raise
is "unrealistic," according to
Fitzgerald. To assure that technical
classes do not fall behind the rapid
advancements in 20th century
technology, Foothill must purchase
modern equipment, Fitzgerald said.
If enrollment continues to drop,
state aid may decline as well. This
year, the legislature gave community
colleges a lump sum income in the
form of a "bailout bill." Next year,
however, the state may decide to
reinstate its former procedure by
which colleges were alloted gov
ernment funds based upon expected
enrollment.
Fitzgerald said that he believes that
community colleges in California will
continue to face the current down
ward trend for income and enroll

ment for the next three to five years
at which time tuition may be insti
tuted. "I would not think tuition to
be in the best interest of California,"
he added.
Fitzgerald said that he hopes that
"the current trend of conservatism
will plateau out" when the public be
comes aware of its destructive qual
ities. "If we believe in an educated
society, where do we put our
priorities?" he asked.
"Taken to the ultimate, it's self
destruct," lamented Foothill College
President lames Fitzgerald on the
debilitating effect of Proposition 13
on California community colleges.
Foothill, located in Los Altos Hills,
and DeAnza Community College in
Mountain View have established one
of California's most prosperous
community college districts over the
past decade. Since the state imposed
the large tax reductions encased in
Prop. 13 last June, however, the out
look at Foothill has become bleak.
"We took our pre-13 fiscal rules
and threw them out the window,"
Fitzgerald said.
Planned for growth
Foothill's formerly proposed
budget of $15 million for the current
year had planned for growth and the
expansion of programs and facilities.
The government's formula stipulated
a return to the previous year's $13
million standard, according to
Fitzgerald.
To overcome this substantial cut
back in funding without a flagrant
sacrifice in services, Fitzgerald said
that he "bought a little time."
Foothill authorities chose to invest
their scarce resources in jobs rather
than physical maintenance while de
pleting reserve accounts of $3.3 mill
ion, an 8 percent adjustment of the
entire budget. Forbidden by law to
charge tuition, officials enstated the
maximum 17 student fees allowable.
These single-purpose and a
stringently-limited fees included
items such as a $10 annual health in
surance policy and a chemistry dam
age fee.
Fitzgerald explained that "the
easiest courses to drop are the least

'collegiate' courses," which, ironi
cally, comprise the very backbone of
the idea of community colleges.
Therefore, all of Foothill's adult
education programs were elimi
nated, as well as a popular evening
enrichment series. Several athletic
classes were spared a similar fate,
because they could be changed from
credit to recreational status, wherein
fees could be legitimately collected.
Enrollment fell
Foothill's total fall enrollment fell
to 16,347, an 8.6 percent loss from
autumn 1977. Fitzgerald noted in an
informational memo that the day
time student population plunged
almost 20 percent.
in light of these changes, Foothill
administrators must begin projec
tions forthe next fiscal year now. Yet,
community college executives are
stymied in this role by the lack of
long-term, definitive legislative mea
sures.
Dr. Thomas Fryer, the chancellor
of the Foothill DeAnza Community
College District said in a speech last
October, "The situation is not
growth, steady state or decline, but
total uncertainty ... All I know is
that our funding authorization ex
pires in nine months, and I have no
idea of what comes next. To develop
a rational plan under those condi
tions is insane."
Fitzgerald said that his preliminary
budgetary notice is due Mar. 15, and
the final budget deadline is May 15.
He added that the delay of actual fi
nancial details from the state legisla
ture until July 1 places community
colleges in an "awkward, tight box."
Fitzgerald estimated next year's
decline in spending would be bet

ween 10 and 20 percent, but admit
ted that "underlying the whole thing
is the great unknown."
He said that he has developed a
method of deductive foresight,
which he termed "contingency
planning." More precisely, he will
"assume the worst" eventuality,
which means no more state money,
and instigate a strategy aimed at that
and more moderate levels of in
come. "We are in the process now of
trying to come to grips with that
possibility," he said.
Fitzgerald guessed that "for a vari
