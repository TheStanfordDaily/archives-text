# University develops quake plan
## 
### Laurie Bennett 
The University may have a for
mal earthquake policy by the end
of this academic year, according
to Director of Public Safety Marvin
Herrington.
There are currently no specific
procedures for students, staff or
service departments in the event
of a major earthquake, although
Dean Richard )ahns of the School
of Earth Sciences warned recently
that a quake hitting as far away as
San Francisco would cause exten
sive damage.
Herrington said he met last fall
with representatives from areas of
the University having resources
that would be needed in an ear
thquake. The committee is com
posed of staff from service opera
tions, public affairs, business and
finance, risk management, stu
dent affairs, the Medical Center
and the fire department.
Herrington is compiling lists of
resources available in these de
partments. The committee will
meet again "probably in late Feb
ruary," Herrington said, in order
to formulate an earthquake plan
that will eventually be posted in
about six locations around cam
pus.
He said the major priorities of
the plan will be communications,
medical aid, fire control, inspec

tion and shutdown of utilities.
"The problem is not coming up
with a plan, it's having a plan we
can use under any cir
cumstances," he said. Procedures
must be updated when key
people leave the University. "It's
the kind of thing we'll be working
on to some degree continually,"
he added.
Herrington said procedures
must not be too specific. "If you
get too detailed, it probably won't
work," he said. The absence of a
key person can cause such a plan
to fall through. "Your plan has to
be very flexible. You may wind up
having to do everything with vol
unteers," he explained.
The University of California at
Santa Barbara showed in a recent
earthquake there that specific ear
thquake procedures and prepara
tion can prove invaluable.
Generators were swiftly trans
ported to areas requiring power,
staff reported to pre-determined
stations, and automatic sprinklers
deluged specially-supported
propane tanks to prevent fire.
Museum
Meanwhile, in UC-Santa Barba
ra's museum, badminton nets rig
ged along shelves saved delicate
pottery from destruction.
UC-Santa Barbara had earlier
practiced a drill involving all cam

pus emergency and health units
as well as Santa Barbara city and
county agencies, local hospitals,
and a U.S. Coast Guard helicop
ter.
Stanford lacks such updated
earthquakp preparations, al
though a museum secretary,
Marti Drickey, reported that all
display items in the museum are
securely fastened to their stands.
Herrington said majorconcerns
in an earthquake would be to save
the lives of injured people and
then to control damaged utilities
such as gas lines.
Stanford's police and fire de
partments have emergency power
systems and would be able to op
erate as a communications center
where search crews could be or
ganized.
Med Center critical
According to Director of Plant
Services Jason Mavis, "the most
critical aspect is the Med Center
Hospital." The hospital has its
own earthquake plan and a sepa
rate emergency power supply to
keep vital systems operating.
The first five or six hours after
an earthquake are the most cru
cial, said Herrington, and are the
period during which guidelines
would be most valuable. "By the
end of five or six hours, even in a

dents and police in case of a quake in the future.
bad earthquake, you should be
able to get outside contact and as
sistance."
Students would play an impor
tant role if volunteers were neces
sary. They would function as
"runners" on bicycles or motor
cycles. "Once you assume the
loss of telephones and power, the
only communication is by word
of-mouth," he said.
Doorways strongest
Should an earthquake occur,
Herrington's advice to students
who are in buildings is to stand in
a doorway (the strongest part of
any building), get under a sturdy
desk, or get out of the building
quickly. Associate Director of En

gineering Tony Bowles warned,
however, that falling masonry and
glass outside of buildings can be
just as dangerous as being trap
ped inside.
Herrington said he doesn't
know where students and others
would be sheltered if a major ear
thquake leveled dormitories and
houses on campus. Supplies of
canned water and crackers,
placed in basement fallout shel
ters in 1962 when the threat of
nuclear attack was a major con
cern, are being phased out.
Coordination of shelters and
medical care would begin at the
state level and filter through the
county before reaching the Uni
versity, he said.

though a museum secretary,
Marti Drickey, reported that all
display items in the museum are
securely fastened to their stands.
Herrington said majorconcerns
in an earthquake would be to save
the lives of injured people and
then to control damaged utilities
such as gas lines.
Stanford's police and fire de
partments have emergency power
systems and would be able to op
erate as a communications center
where search crews could be or
ganized.
Med Center critical
According to Director of Plant
Services Jason Mavis, "the most
critical aspect is the Med Center
Hospital." The hospital has its
own earthquake plan and a sepa
rate emergency power supply to
keep vital systems operating.
The first five or six hours after
an earthquake are the most cru
cial, said Herrington, and are the
period during which guidelines
would be most valuable. "By the
end of five or six hours, even in a

bad earthquake, you should be
able to get outside contact and as
sistance."
Students would play an impor
tant role if volunteers were neces
sary. They would function as
"runners" on bicycles or motor
cycles. "Once you assume the
loss of telephones and power, the
only communication is by word
of-mouth," he said.
Doorways strongest
Should an earthquake occur,
Herrington's advice to students
who are in buildings is to stand in
a doorway (the strongest part of
any building), get under a sturdy
desk, or get out of the building
quickly. Associate Director of En

gineering Tony Bowles warned,
however, that falling masonry and
glass outside of buildings can be
just as dangerous as being trap
ped inside.
Herrington said he doesn't
know where students and others
would be sheltered if a major ear
thquake leveled dormitories and
houses on campus. Supplies of
canned water and crackers,
placed in basement fallout shel
ters in 1962 when the threat of
nuclear attack was a major con
cern, are being phased out.
Coordination of shelters and
medical care would begin at the
state level and filter through the
county before reaching the Uni
versity, he said.
The University may have a for
mal earthquake policy by the end
of this academic year, according
to Director of Public Safety Marvin
Herrington.
There are currently no specific
procedures for students, staff or
service departments in the event
of a major earthquake, although
Dean Richard )ahns of the School
of Earth Sciences warned recently
that a quake hitting as far away as
San Francisco would cause exten
sive damage.
Herrington said he met last fall
with representatives from areas of
the University having resources
that would be needed in an ear
thquake. The committee is com
posed of staff from service opera
tions, public affairs, business and
finance, risk management, stu
dent affairs, the Medical Center
and the fire department.
Herrington is compiling lists of
resources available in these de
partments. The committee will
meet again "probably in late Feb
ruary," Herrington said, in order
to formulate an earthquake plan
that will eventually be posted in
about six locations around cam
pus.
He said the major priorities of
the plan will be communications,
medical aid, fire control, inspec

tion and shutdown of utilities.
"The problem is not coming up
with a plan, it's having a plan we
can use under any cir
cumstances," he said. Procedures
must be updated when key
people leave the University. "It's
the kind of thing we'll be working
on to some degree continually,"
he added.
Herrington said procedures
must not be too specific. "If you
get too detailed, it probably won't
work," he said. The absence of a
key person can cause such a plan
to fall through. "Your plan has to
be very flexible. You may wind up
having to do everything with vol
unteers," he explained.
The University of California at
Santa Barbara showed in a recent
earthquake there that specific ear
thquake procedures and prepara
tion can prove invaluable.
Generators were swiftly trans
ported to areas requiring power,
staff reported to pre-determined
stations, and automatic sprinklers
deluged specially-supported
propane tanks to prevent fire.
