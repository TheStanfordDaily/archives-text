# Black hole suspected

### 
Pasadena (AP) — Astronom
ers have found evidence of
mysterious processes — pos
sibly a black hole — at the
center of our galaxy, a
spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology says.
Astronomers at Cal Tech's
Hale Observatories said a black
hole could account for intense
radio waves seen in a new pic
ture of the core of the Milky
Way.
But astronomer Thomas
Geballe said evidence for the
possible black hole is still only
"indirect."
Black holes are objects pre
dicted by Einstein's Theory of
Relativity. They would occur
when a collapsed star or stars
became so dense that the
combined gravity prevented
the escape of light.
No black hole has been posi
tively identified, but as
tronomers believe they exist
and have identified several
likely candidates.
Astronomers studying the
new picture of the galactic
center identified the radio
waves coming from the core,
which they said contains
enough mass to make 8 million
suns.
The area covers about three
light years, nearly 18 trillion
miles, and seems to contain
millions of stars, the scientists
said.
