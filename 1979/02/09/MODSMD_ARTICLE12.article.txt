### 
Washington (AP) — Univer
sity of California management
of federal nuclear weapons
laboratories promotes national
security and arms limitation,
says UC President David Sa
xon.
In a written statement last
week to a study group of the
U.S. Energy Research Advisory
Board, Saxon said the nation
benefits more than the univer
sity from UC'ss3.s million con
tract to manage the Lawrence
Livermore and Los Alamos
laboratories.
"I start with the assumption
that the security of this nation
would be endangered if the
laboratories were not truly ex
cellent scientifically," Saxon
said.
"So long as the nation is in a
strategic position that is de
pendent on a nuclear strategy
of deterrence and is seeking a
step-by-step limitation and, we
hope, reduction of nuclear
weapons...the vitality of the
work on weapons develop
ment and associated technical
means to monitor and control
weapons is absolutely neces
sary."
The bulk of the nation's re
search and development of
new nuclear weapons is done
at the laboratories.
Demonstrators at UC re
gents' meetings have de
manded conversion of the labs
to non-weapons work, but Sa
xon, a former nuclear physi
cist, has defended the ar
rangement and recently re
newed the federal contract.
