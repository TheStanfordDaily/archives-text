# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Alben and Nesbitt New theme houses needed 
### 
Residential education seems to be at a
standstill on this campus. Current theme houses
may satisfy their residents, but a growing
number of groups, deserving of their own spe
cial residences, are left out in the cold. They are
forced to live off campus, in fraternities and in
the housing system itself.
What can be done for these deprived ethnic,
national and occupational groups? A special
panel, organized to study this pressing prob
lem, came up with the following suggestions for
new theme houses.
The Texas Theme House: Since several resi
dences on campus already make study of the
native language a condition of residency, there
should be no problem in gaining acceptance for
the establishment of a Texas Theme House at
Stanford.
Instructors, imported from the Lone Star
State, will teach ignorant New Yorkers and
Californians how to use the "d" sound in the
third person past and present form of the verb
"to be," i.e., "Idn't it a cute horse?" "Wadn't
that a fine rodeo?" Students will also be taught
how to use the word"y'all" as a noun, adjective
and verb.
But being Texan means much more than
speaking a foreign tongue, and the Texas Theme
House will have to embrace all things Texan in
order to truly represent the state's "culture."
Building specifications will be designed to take
style of dress into account. Doorways will be
raised six inches in order to accommodate
height and hat requirements. Carpets will be
constructed to be especially heel-mark and spur
resistant.
Other special features will include an outdoor
feedlot, barbecue pit for longhorns, hitching
post and a "hoedown room," for sing-alongs
and square dances. Height requirements will be
relaxed for the first few quarters of the Texas
House program. Extra building materials
will be supplied to facilitate unlimited growth of
the Houston wing.
Suggested themes: "Great Texan Presidents
of the United States," "The State of the Arts in
Texas," and "Famous Texan Authors that you
can think of."
Prospective Resident Fellows: Lady Bird
lohnson, Bum Phillips, Leslie Crozier.
The Iranian Student Theme House: This new
residence will be distinguished primarily by its
innovative and durable construction. For
reasons that should be apparent to those of us
who watch the nightly news, there will be no
windows in the house. The infrastructure of the
houe will be made of granite and steel, impervi
ous to attack by neutron bombs and chemical
weapons that may still exist in Iranian military
stockpiles.
Architects will also have to be sensitive to the
need for anonymity of many residents. Each
mailbox in the entryway will be labeled "Mr. X."
In addition, the address of the house will be
changed on a weekly basis.
Special rooms for social activities will also be
constructed. "The Effigy Room" will come com
plete with gallows, rope, and flamethrowers. Of
course, an elaborate sprinkler system similar to
the ones in the new row houses will have to be
built in.
The seminar room will hold only the most
luxurious furniture. Guest speakers will be in
vited to dine here. A long-playing tape will be

broadcast over the room's sound system to
drown out after-dinner remarks when the
speaker takes the podium.
Rumor has it that the shah will be invited to be
a Hoover Fellow by late May. The "Shah Guest
Cottage" will be built adjacent to the theme
house. Security arrangements will be made by
the Corleone family.
The Los Angeles Theme House: It's hard to
believe that the 25 percent of our student body
that comes from that masterpiece of suburban
sprawl, Los Angeles, has survived so long with
out a house.
The Southern Californian environment caters
to humans, and there's no reason why students
should have to brave the elements of a real-life
climate just to get an education.
The Los Angeles house would feature a cli
mate control system, keeping the building at an
even 80 degrees. A brown, smog-like film would
be applied to all windows, lest the inhabitants
get depressed by daily exposure to blue skies.
Residents of the house would be expected to
observe a well-defined dress code. Guys would
wear Hawaiian shirts and down vests. Forspecial
occasions leisure suits, silky printed shirts and
golf shoes would be expected. Girls could wear
anything white.
Luaus, disco lessons, volleyball and tanning
clinics would be offered. Flying home for the
weekend would always be encouraged.
Mastery of such vocabulary as "laid back,"
"mellow," "intense," "awesome" and "to the
max" would be prerequisites for all residents.
No meals would be served in the Los Angeles
house. Instead, station wagons would be pro
vided to run an all-night shuttle serve to Taco
Bell.
The Preppie Theme House There is a definite
need lor a gathering spot for the alienated group
from the East Coast, who experience a funda
mental culture shock when they first land at San
Francisco International. The following sugges
tions will help simulate that Ivy League atmos
phere so lacking at Stanford.
The Eastern theme house would be a three
story, white frame Victorian home, complete
with turrets and bay windows. It would be sur
rounded by pine trees and fake snow. Fireplaces
in each room and a well-equipped bar would
insulate residents from the drafty, all-pervadi.ig
chill.
The house would have no need for a dress
code, since Easterners are notoriously scrupulous
about apparel.
A theme house would allow those from "back
East" to create the cliques and competitive so
cial climate of a small prep school. They could
establish a rigid social hierarchy oblivious to the
tranquil, mellow campus at their doorstep.
Activites would include yachting parties,
squash tournaments, lacrosse, trips to the sym
phony, discussing California tackiness, polo
and excluding others.
These are just a few of the oppressed groups
at Stanford who deserve to have theme houses.
Unrecognized factions, stand up and be
noticed! On a campus which provides for faux
francais and Florentine pizza freaks, it's worth a
try.
