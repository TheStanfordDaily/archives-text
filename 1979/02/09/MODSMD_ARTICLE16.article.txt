Pro new showers
We are disgusted and dis
heartened with students' reac
tions to the new shower heads
IDaily Feb. 5).
Ihese new devices are the
first long-term effort the
Energy Conservation Center
has been able to make on a
campus-wide basis to conserve
water. Other attempts have in
cluded public campaigns to
save water by flushing toilets
less often and taking shorter
showers, yet these usually re
sult in short-term savings since
most people are only conscien
tious during drought years.
Water does not just come
from the tap. Unfortunately,
many students seem to think
that money can buy every
thing, and if one water source
runs out, dams will be built to
create new sources.
This irresponsibility and dis
regard for the environment is
characteristic of the social
world in which privileged

people are raised.
Although students are "old"
enough to choose how to con
serve energy, the Daily article
proved that they are not ma
ture enough. Considering
showers as a source of amuse
ment, drilling holes in shower
heads, turning on two showers
at once, and letting showers
run at night just "to show
them" demonstrates the ex
cessive consumption and de
structive attitude of these stu
dents.
It further amazes us to hear
that the shower heads are the
"hottest topic" in dorms when
there are so many problems in
the world.
Whenever something new is
implemented, people opposed
to it are usually the ones to
write or call in. I hope those in
favor of the new shower heads
will let the Energy Conserva
tion Center know so they will
not reinsert the old shower
heads.

In addition to conserving
energy, the new shower heads
are a step toward raising the
awareness and initiating a
trend toward a less consump
tive lifestyle.
