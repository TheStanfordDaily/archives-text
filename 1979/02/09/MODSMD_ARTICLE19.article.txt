## Hearst's wealth triggers pardon 
### 
Who is Jimmy Carter and
what is he doing? )ust last week
this shining knight took it upon
himself to gallop through
Pleasanton, sweep Patricia
Hearst up onto his white horse
and convey her to freedom.
His actions have been hailed
by many as courageous, bene
ficent and highly moral. How
ever we shed the feudal epoch
long ago. More than the
glamor of an armored knight
now must be taken into con
sideration.
Many people maintain that
Hearst indeed broke the law
but that she has suffered
enough and thus it is a
courageous and kind gesture
of Carter to pardon her.
They assume Hearst's cir
cumstances Were unusual; she
underwent physical and
psychological agony at the
hands of her captors, which
was compounded by the.orde
als of her trial and imprison
ment.
Certainly Hearst endured
months of incredible stress.
However many prison inmates
have surely undergone similar
abuse. Because of their lack of
access to the kind of pressure
the Hearst name can muster,
they are forced to remain in
prison, to endure further mis
treatment at the hands of the
penal system itself.

Other people feel that
Hearst's conviction was wrong
and that her release reverses a
judicial mistake and therefore
is just. These people question
whether she participated will
fully in the robbery and other
SLA activities.
Indeed, we might never be
sure whether Hearst engaged
in illegal activities willingly or
whether she was "brain
washed." Doubts such as these
of course complicate and even
dismiss trials.
The fact remains, however,
.hat the jury which tried and
convicted Patty Hearst appa
rentlv felt the evidence was
convincing enough. Based on
this la< t t arlei â€¢> pardon is no
thing less than .1 graceful de
tour of justice.
Those who feel Hearst's
conviction was wrong in the
first place probably feel the
trial should have been dismis
sed for lack of conclusive evi
dence. Perhaps it should have
been. But since it wasn't, the
proper route for opponents of
her conviction was to appeal.
This they did, and theirappeals
were repeatedly denied.
Perhapsthe judicial system is
inherently flawed and Hearst
was a victim of it; indeed, that
is a possibilit\ But others have
been victimized by it, too, and
have had to endure the con

sequences.
If (he system is centrally
flawed, the correct route is
either to reform it or abandon
it completely, not to tap-dance
around it as Carter has done.
If Carter was righting a mis
carriage of justice by pardon
ing Hearst, does it mean he is
personally responsible for re
trying all mistrials? Carried
further, is the president re
sponsible for righting all
wrongs in the country? Is he
even capable of doing so? The
notion is insane.
Equally incredible, however,
is the contention that Carter
pardoned Hearst because the
circumstances surrounding
her trial and conviction were so
unusual that they caused her
an inordinate amount of suffer
ing
M,inv citizens suffer at the
hands of "justice." It is not
the executives duly to split
hairs to decide who sudors
more than whom. That is ir
relevant.
Surely all prisoners wronged
by the system should be re
leased. But all such prisoners
aren't released. Only Patty
Hearst gets justice "the way it
should be." The Hearst case is
an illustration of the fact that
money talks. It's that simple.
Supposedly, Carter released
Hearst to ease her suffering. If

Carter really wants to ease suf
fering in this country, he can
begin by reworking the welfare
system. He can take a crack at
eliminating sexism.
He can take a clear look at
our country and perhaps see
that the problems that manifest
themselves as "issues" are not
disparate problems separate
from one another. They are re
lated symptoms of one cancer
ous disease.
The system in which Carter is
trying to function is fundamen
tally flawed and ailing. Many of
the tenets upon which it is
based are, as we now see, po
tentials dangerous.
The state of affairs in which
we are now choking is a logical
outcome of a society which pits'
person against person and
dangles monetary rewards
carrot-like above them. In the!
competition, those with mate
rial influence trample those
without.
In this light, notions of
equality and liberty to which
our country clings are vacuous.
Patty Hearst's release clearly il
lustrates that it is the poor who
must bear the burden of the
system's ills, while the rich can
always find a route to freedom.
