# Wallet theft problem worsens
## 
### Laurie Bennett 
Six wallets were reported stolen
Wednesday, according to Detective
Donald Lillie of the Dept. of Public
Safety here.
Four of the wallets were taken
from offices and two from dor
mitories. All but one of the thefts oc
curred on the west side of campus,
Lillie said.
Reports of wallet the/ts have been
averaging2o per month, although Lil
lie estimated that at least three times
as many thefts occur as are reported.
Three of the wallets taken Wed
nesday were later discovered in re
strooms. Very seldom will a thief take
a chance on carrying it somewhere
else," Lillie said.
Theft spurts
The wallet thefts are not always iso
lated incidents, he said. The thefts
seem to come in spurts separated by
a monthortwo. "You knowthat'sthe
professional," he said.
Office buildings such as those in
lordan Quad are particularly suscep
tible to thefts because only one or
two people occupy an office, doors
are left open and staff are in and out
of rooms during the day, Lillie said.

The lunch hour is a particularly luc
rative time for wallet thieves to oper
ate, both in office buildings and in
dormitories. "Students come into
their room and throw their wallet on
the desk or dresser. Then they leave
the room to eat and the wallet is lying
out in plain sight," he said.
Recurring problem
Meyer Undergraduate Library
(UGLY) Secretary Kathy Fehrn said
that wallet stealing as been a recur
ring problem. "People have the mis
taken idea that packs won't be rifled"
when they leave their books momen
tarily, Fehrn said.
Fehrn said '.hat last year a wallet
thief was working UGLY, Cubberley,
and the CERAS building in a regular
pattern.
Students sometimes report stolen
wallets to the lost-and-found in Tre
sidder Union. "Once in a while I'll
get a number of reports in a day, and
I'll think somebody's working the
campus," saidTresidder Information
Coordinator Portia Holmes.
Unlocked rooms
Lillie estimated that 99 percent of
the wallet thefts could be prevented
by locking doors. He said that thieves
can easily find an unlocked dorm

room or office, enter the room, find a
wallet or purse, and leave without
being noticed. "All this can be done
in 35 or 40 seconds, he said.
Lillie feels that the biggest step to
ward overcoming the theft problem
is to make people aware that it exists.
Students and staff should be suspici
ous of strangers who ask to use
phones, ask for restrooms, or say
they are looking for a particular per
son in an office building, he
explained. Thieves who are caught in
empty offices will frequently say that
they were looking fora placetoapply
for a job.
The Dept. of Public Safety is cur
rently showing a videotape entitled
"Easy Money" to various groups on
campus. Made at UC-Berkeley two
years ago, the tape features
"George," a professional wallet thief
who regularly worked the UC-
Berkeley campus.
"George" describes the methods
he used in entering empty offices
while the occupants were away. He
found that people would frequently
lock their wallet in a desk, but then
leave the key in the top drawer. File
cabinets were also used to "hide"
wallets, purses or cash boxes.
