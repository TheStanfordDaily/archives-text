## Coercion minimized in libertarian society 
### 
In a letter to the Daily on Jan. 30, Joseph Walder
challenged libertarians to advance "definitive prop
osals on how this society should be restructured"
according to their principles.
This is certainly a tall order. I will attempt to re
spond to this challenge in an article which will be too
short to be definitive.
To begin with, the central theme in libertarian
philosophy is that the law should minimize physical
coercion among people. This idea is expressed in the
non-aggression principle which says, "Every person
is the owner of his own life, and that no one is the
owner of anyone else's life; and that consequently
every human being has the right to act in accordance
with his own choices, unless those choices infringe
on the equal liberty of other human beings to act in
accordance with their choices."
There are specific references by reputable
philosophers, lawyers and economists detailing how
this principle leads directly to a cogent theory of
rights and contract law. The idea that "taxation is
theft" derives from this principle.
Walder asked how citizens will be provided with
national defense, consumer protection, police and
fire protection, schools and aid for the disabled in a
libertarian society. Surely these are services that
many people desire. The question is whether coer
cion will be used to provide them.
Libertarians feel they are in much the same position
as the man who toured the Soviet Union some years
ago and asked the people there how they would get
shoes if the government didn't make them. Almost
unanimously they were bewildered and decided no
shoes would be available.
In America, we realize that entrepreneurs would be
falling all over themselves trying to provide enough
shoes unless, of course, the government forbade
them with the threat of violence or confiscated the
fruits of their labor.
We must realize that the services listed are cur
rently provided by entrenched bureaucracies. These
institutions continually reinforce self-propagating
myths justifying the use of coercion to provide ser
vices and to maintain state monopolies of these ser
vices. Very often the desire of legislatures and ad
ministrative bureaucracies to impose a state
mandated solution stems from their own self
exaggerated expertise and a lack of imagination to
see broader solutions.

Because of space limitations, I can deal only briefly
with the specific issues. Police and fire protection are
probably the easiest to handle. We are currently
faced with a situation that almost everyone agrees is
inadequate.
Police coverage is scant in most communities and
homes usually burn to the ground before the fire
department arrives. In addition, police are rarely held
accountable for specific violations of an individual's
rights. Even when the police are found guilty, the
victim can't obtain damages.
A system in which police are hired by neighbor
hood associations and subject to the same laws as
citizens is not unreasonable. Similarly, fire protection
can be handled by private organizations (either vol
unteer, as in many small communities, or for profit as
in Scottsdale, Arizona).
Schools are under attack from the left, right and
center. Currently, many schools are little more than
prisons that impose WASPvalues on adolescents and
keep them off the street. Schools are billed as
"socializing institutions," but how can subjecting a
child (or adult) to arbitrary coercive power teach him
to live in a community of self-respecting adults?
Currently, many private schools charge tuition
lower than it costs the state per pupil to run public
schools. Alternative schools have sprung up even in
very poor communities. Privately operated schools
are an attractive option; yet even suggesting them
brings a torrent of hate from teachers' unions, state
bureaucracies and politicians.
Can anyone seriously believe that the disabled will
not be cared for in any civilized society? Our govern
ment helps a great many needy people not because it
points guns at people demanding they give money
but in spite of it. Most people want to help others.
Witness the billions of dollars donated every year to
CARE, Red Cross, United Way and religious organiza
tions. Tithing was once a nearly obligatory fact of life
if a person wished to be socially accepted.
Today, people look at the government taking 40
percent of income instead of 10 percent and say, "The
government will do it." It is certainly fair to ask how
much waste and human suffering is caused by this
attitude.
When the words "consumer protection" are ban
died about, we have to ask who is really being pro
tected. More often than not, it is the large drug com

panies, large dairy interests, large unions (including
the American Medical Association and, of course, the
bureaucracy itself. This is because they have the
economic wealth to buy political power.
The solution is to cut political power, not to destroy
wealth. Wealth is the source of all our well-being, not
just that of the wealthy. We need not fear economic
power but only political power purchased by
economic interests. Devices such as warranties and
information sources like the Consumers' Union can
provide far more specific and beneficial protection to
consumers.
National detense is an emotionally charged issue.
We are so used to thinking of nation-states as sac
rosanct beings that we rarely question the actions
taken in their name. In fact, states are only collections
of human beings and ought to be subject to the same
moral constraints.
Failure to recognize this in the past has led to re
ligious leaders blessing a soldier bent on some un
holy carnage, a blessing that would never be given to
sanctify an individual's purpose.
If a burglar breaks into your house, it is considered
wrong for you to rush to a neighbor's house exhort
ing him at gunpoint to come to your aid. Yet this is
exactly what we do to each other in the sacred name
of national defense.
Libertarians are not agreed about now national de
fense should ultimately be provided. At least it needs
to be altered to a truly defense establishment rather
than a huge imperialistic force designed to protect
every economic transaction carried on by an Ameri
can in any portion of the world. The dangers of such
an organization are all too clear.
This article has been far too short to convey the
depth of thought that has been given these issues. I
have not touched on civil liberties or on transition
issues (how do we get from here to a libertarian
society?).
A course entitled "Coercion and Freedom'' (EES
410) is being offered this quarter to explore these and
other issues in depth. There is a large quantity of
reading material on reserve in the Engineering Lib
rary. Anyone desiring a reading list and course out
line should write to me in care of the Engineering-
Economic Systems Department.
