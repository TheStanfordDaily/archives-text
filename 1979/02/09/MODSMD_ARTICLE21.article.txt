MODESTO U\NZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone
specializes in Italian cuisine of
central and of northern Italy.
The owner, Modesto Lanzone,
is of Genovese origin, and the
menu reflects many traditional
Genovese specialties not
known, even to the most avid
connoisseurs of the Italian
kitchen. But the genuine cos
mopolitan nature of Modesto
is underscored by thewide var
ieties of dishes which though
not of Italian origin are suffi
ciently Latinized.
Seven antipasti dishes range
in price from $3.95 to $5.50.
Two little known dishes,
Caportadda al tonno (tuna, to
matoes and onions) and In
salata di mare (marinated
squids with shrimps) reflect
the important influence of the
sea in the Italian kitchen.
When in season, prosciutto e
melone (ham and melon) is a
classic opener for any memor
able Italian dinner. But the
pasta, the foundation of the Ita
lian diet, will provide a solid
grounding for any meal at
Modesto's.
The qualty of the food not
withstanding, it is still not pos
sible to dine at Modesto's as an
Italian would. In Italy the or
ganization of a meal is an art
almost as complicated as the
preparation of the meal. The
pasta is only the primo or first
course. It is then followed by a
meat dish, thesecondo, and an
appropriate selection of side
dishes. The effect is to sample a
wide variety of the foods of
Italy. But most importantly, it
avoids giving the impression
that most Italians rely only on
the starch carbohydrate diet
which would be provided by a
meal of only pasta.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modes

to's pasta dishes are designed
to be complete meals. In this
case, the waiter's advice is
worth heeding: split the pasta
dish. Typical of the cuisine ot
Northern Italy, the pasta dishes
de-emphasize the omnipre
sent tomato sauce. The Ag
nolotti alia crema (round disks
of pasta stuffed with chicken,
cheese, and ham), Gnocchi
Verdi al sugo (small potato
flower dumplings), Guanciali
al Funghi (pillows of pasta with
ricotta and mushrooms) are
among the more exotic pasta
offerings. Our top recommen
dation is panzotti alia crema di
noci stile manuelina (stuffed
pasta with ricotta and walnut
sauce). The key, says Lanzone
"is the twist of lemon, milk,
and walnuts. In fact, this dish
was invented by the Genovese
to get rid of all their walnuts."
Too much salt marred this
otherwise superior dish.
Of the four salads, the In
salata di spinaci alia fiamma
(for two — spinach salad with
bacon, flambed wih Brandy) is
overpriced at $6.75. Excellent,
though it is, it should only be
ordered by the most self
indulgent. The regular mixed
green salad, a la carte, is $1 .95.
A wide variet/ of main
courses fill out Modesto's
menu Gamberi ilia pescatora
$7.50 <prawns sauteed with
shallots) is a standout entree.
Nocciola di abacchio alia
Romana (lamb roasted Roman
style) arrived more broiled
than roasted. Still, the meat
was exceptional. Polio
gerusalemme, (for two — chic
ken stuffed with artichoke
hearts, mushrooms and sour
cream) at $17.00 is the house
specialty. All entrees are noted
for their generous portions.
The deserts included the
standard fare of ice cream,
zabagHone, sherberts and
creme caramel. Of note is the
sacripantma, a light combina

tion of cake and zabaghone
which avoided the heavy
sweetness ot Italian deserts.
A fine espresso rounds out
the meal.
Modesto Lanzone's is an es
tablished San Francisco re
staurant with a loyal clientele.
The waiters, many of whom are
Italians, add a touch of the old
country. Lanzone runs a tight
ship. But there is still ample
room for improvement. The
restaurant has more than the
lived-in look. It is well worn.
There were bread crumbs on
our table even after we were
seated: the napkins were
dog-eared After all these years
the charm of Ghirardelli square
has worn off. Still, hearty por
tions, soft candle light, and the
quiet charm of the lights of the
Bay make Modesto's well
worth returning to.

PAPRIKAS FONO
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
441-1223
His accent is heavy, his man
ner European. An immigrant
from Hungary, Laszlo Fono is a
delightfully real example of the
American Dream come true.
Once a member of the Hunga
rian Olympic Ski Team, Mr.
Fono and his wife, Paulette, are
owners of Paprika's Fono, one
of San Francisco's most ac
complished moderately-priced
restaurants, located in Ghirar
delli Square.
The Fonos left Hungary (and
the security of a professional
athlete's salary), for the United
States in 1956. Ten years later,
with no formal training and
only a few business courses at

the University of Denver be
hind them, they moved to San
Francisco and opened the first
Magic Pan. Capitalizing on a
machine of Fono's invention to
make palacsmtas (Hungarian
crepes), the restaurant estab
lished itself as a brilliant suc
cess. In 1969 they sold the en
terprise to Quaker Oats and in
1972 opened Paprika's
Fono.
Today, originality and un
compromising standards have
again reaped rewards for the
Fono's. With faithfulness toold
family recipes, Paprika's Fono
provides the diner with a taste
of things different.
In the center of the large din
ing room suspended over hot
coals hangs a wide cast iron
pot, full of the traditional Hun

garian Culyas soup (goulash).
I ndividual portions of the
smooth paprikas broth are
served directly from this com
munal hearth. The Fonos run
the show both in and out of the
kitchen. Besides testing re
cipes daily, they give careful at
tention to the waiters. As a re
sult, preparation and service
are of the caliber one expects
to find in a higher-priced re
staurant.
The menu narrates the his
tory behind some of Hungary's
characteristic dishev From the
nomadic herdsman of the (.reat
Plains comes the most expen
sive item on the list, the Hor
tobagyi Mixed Grill ($11.95), a
hearty array of beef fillet, ske
wered lamb, homemade saus
age, and tender pork steak.
Chicken Paprikas ($7.95), the
national dish, is made with a
rich paprikas sauce some may
find a little too different — the
Egri Beef Tokany or Veal To
kany ($6.95 and $8.25 respec
tively), incorporating more
subtle tastes of red wine and
mushrooms, are recom
mended for those who are
looking for a less exotic dish.
An entree originally intro
duced at the Magic Pan,
Mother's Palacsintas ($6.95),
also appears on the menu. A
too-creamy mushroom-herb
sauce in the Veal Palacsinta is
an unfortunate drawback here.
The accompanying asparagus
souffle palacsinta, prepared
with light cream and delicate
seasonings, is delicious.
All but two of the dinner of
ferings are served with Magyar
sour salads (tomato, cucumber
or fresh red beet), and/or side

dishes. The bread is langos
($1.50), a lightly fried peasant
cake you rub with garlic. Be
sure and try it.
In addition to a few Califor
nia labels, the Fono's carry a
modest selection ot Hungarian
wines, including a nutty fla
vored mountain white, Badac
sonyi Keknyelu. Also available
is the famous dessert wine To
kaji, which is ranked by the
number of puttonyos, or bas
kets of unripe grapes, added to
a fixed quantity of ordinary
grapes. As puttonyos are
added the Tokaji becomes
sweeter and more expensive.
Paprika's Fono serves two: To
kaji Szamorodni (no put
tonyos), and Tokaji Aszu "4
Puttonyos" ($15.00 a bottle).
Named the "nectar of the
Cods" by Hungarian peasants
centuries ago tor its full, sweet
flavor, any Tokaji, including
the Szamorodni, is an in
dulgence worth enjoying.
The fabuously rich dessert
tortes and strudels are baked
every day under the strict
supervision of Mrs. Fono.
Sweet palacsintas are also pre
pared on the premises. Prices
are reasonable and range from
$1.85 for the Apple Strudel to
$2.75 lor the Walnut Palacsinta.
After spending two months
in Italy last summer sampling
Italian ices (gelati), the Fonos
have plans to open an "ice"
store of their own in Stanford
Shopping Center within the
next year.
Paprika's Fono is open daily
11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday
to 9 p.m. Reservations are not
required.
