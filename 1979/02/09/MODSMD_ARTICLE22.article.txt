The bright lights of Ghirardelli Square attract almost every first-time visitor to San Fran
cisco. The collection of noteworthy restaurants and specialty shops keep the visitor coming
back again and again.
Early in the 20th-century Ghirardelli Stone Ground Chocolate, Eagle Brand Baking Bars
and a tube candy named flicks were manufactured on the waterfront site by the Ghirardelli
family. Today all Ghirardelli products are made in a large complex on the eastern shore of
the Bay.
The aroma of chocolate, however, still pervades the brick factory buildings now trans
formed into a handsome multi-leveled complex. Ghirardelli maintains a soda fountain and
candy shop which offers a rich chocolate experience.
