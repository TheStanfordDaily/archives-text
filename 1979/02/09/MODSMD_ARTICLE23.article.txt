PACIFIC CAFE
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
775-1173
Fresh seafood naturally
comes to mind on an excursion
to the City particularly in the
waterfront quarter stretching
from Fisherman s Wharf to
Ghirardelli Square
If you are looking for a quiet,
friendly place tucked away
from the bright lights of the
Wharf, the two-vear-old Pacific
Cafe is a restaurant to con
sider Located on the third
floorof the Mustard Building in
Ghirardelli Square, it can be a
little difficult to find but worth
the effort.
The long, gleaming wooden
bar stretches the length of the
restaurant with a small cocktail
area. A ten minute wait for a

table without reservations on a
weeknight can be easily pas
sed, over a drink. "After a few
clear days, we get busy for din
ner," explained Asst. Manager
Lee Soule. The 102 seating
capacity turns over frequently
during the course of the even
ing.
The menu offers a wide
selection of fresh seafood as
well as an equally long selec
tion of wines. The shrimp
cocktail appetizer offers a
good amount of shrimp, which
is not lost in the sauce. Half
dozen oysters on the half shell
are another appetizer selec
tion.
The seafood entree tomes
with fresh bread and country
tried potatoes. Specials for this
evening were a halibut fillet,
Belle-Dore ($7.95) and a pan
broiled tilet of fresh sturgeon
($7.25). Skillet fried Abalone
($8.95) is in the top price range
with pan fried Sand Dabs
($5.25) roundingout the menu.
The Fillet of Sole Newburg
($5.84) is one of the most popu
lar dishes on menu, according
to Soule. >erved in a casserole,
the sole is stuffed with shrimp
and crab. For someone who
isn't a bit: fH lover, the New
burg white sauce masks any
fishy taste Although the crab
was a little hard to find, the
smoothness and delicate taste
of the dish are probably reason

for its success combined with
the reasonable price.
Fried Prawns ($6.48) were
lightly battered with a nice
crunchy, non-greasy taste. The
cottage potatoes accompany
ing all the dishes were on the
dry side, however. Snapper,
salmon, shrimp and scallops
were all offered as well as two
steak entrees. "We're working
on more non-fish alterna
tives," Soule said.
One of the house wines, Vin-
Iner's Choice ($5.50 per bottle)
is a pleasant white chablis and
well worth including in your
meal. A good selection from
Calitornia vinyards as well as
imported wines is offered.
One of the three waiters,
lack, made the evening a
pleasant one with careful at
tention to the table as well as
making helpful suggestions.
"The shrimp sauteed is messy
but really tasty in a wine and
garlic sauce so if you aren't in
the mood, the fried prawns is a
better bet," he explained.
The Pacific Cafe is one of
three in the Bay Area. Owner
and manager Bob Colombo
will be opening a fourth soon
in South San Francisco. "The
original Cafe on C.eary Street
now four years old, seats only
78, maintaining the smallness
and quality that is important to
Columbo, commented Soule.
