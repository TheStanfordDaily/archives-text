## Bruner, Hartloff lead Cards Tough Trojans swim here 
### Oianne Cahoon 
The travelling Trojans of USC will take the
plunge into deCuerre pool against the Cardinal
men this afternoon at 2 p.m.
Following last week's dunking at the hands of
UCLA, the Cards hope to reclaim their winning
edge. Yet a victory today will require a supreme
effort because USC has "a very strong and deep
team," in the words of Stanford coach )im
Gaughran.
USC has traditionally amassed one of the na
tion's most vibrant swimming powers, under
the expert tutelage of Peter Daland. Although
standouts John Naber and )oe Bottom have
graduated since the bygone days of Southern
Cal aquatic dominance, the Trojans have been
picked for the runner-up spot in this year's
NCAA competition, according to Gaughran.
Perhaps their most potent weapon is their
versatility. Freshman Jeff Float, winner of the 400
meter freestyle at last summer's national long
course championships, sophomore backstroker
Jamie Fowler and individual medley stalwart Kirt
Fredericks possess prowess in almost every
event. "We could run into them anywhere,"
Gaughran said of this imposing triple.
Olympian Bruce Furniss tops the list of Trojan
freestylers. Breaststroker Danny Rosenthal, who
earlier this season clocked a shaved 2:05.8 in the
200 yard breast, will allow the Cards' Ken Shilling

little breathing room.
Gaughran said that the 400 medley relay will
again be replaced by the 100 yard backstroke,
breaststroke and butterfly events to possibly
give the Cardinals a slight advantage over the
more distance-oriented Trojan squad. Gaug
hran remarked that "USC has so far not done
well in the sprints." â€¢
Therefore, Stanford will be counting on an
early lead through the first three races to be
upheld by stellar performances from co-captain
Mike Bruner. Bruner recorded NCAA qualifying
times in the 200 fly and the 200 free (on the 800
free relay) in last week's losing cause.
Depending on the injured status of junior Paul
Hartloff, Gaughran said that he expects a strong
1000 free from him.
USC is also on the comeback trail after a loss
to SMU last week. Gaughran discounted the
apparent trend of upsets throughout collegiate
swimming nationwide as "not too indicative" of
NCAA actualities. Dual meet results "seem to
depend on how much a particular team is rested
on a particular day,"he explained.
In that sense, the Cards will anticipate a very
competitive and highly motivated confrontation
this afternoon. Will the walls of Troy be
demolished by a tidal wave of Stanford aspira
tions, or will they simply float out to sea to
drown in their own shallow graves?
