# Netters face title threats
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
Three years ago Stanford's
varsity tennis team finished
second in the NCAA champ
ionships, losing by only one
point.
The last two years the Cardi
nals rebounded and won the
title, knocking off Trinity and
UCLA in the finals while run
ning their current winning
streak to 37.
This year, however, the
Cards are without Ail-
Americans Bill Maze, Perry
Wright and the NCAA singles
champion, Davis Cup hero,
etc. etc. John McEnroe.
Three-year letterman and star
ter John Rast is out indefinitely
with a slipped disc.
So with the Cards losing four
of their top five starters, one
would expect that they would
suffer an agonizing rebuilding
year in 1979, right?
Wrong. When the Intercol
legiate Tennis Coaches' poll
came out last week, guess who
was holding down the top
spot? Vou guessed it, the
Cards are the pre-season favo
rite to take it all one more time.
"We deserve the top rank
ing," boasted coach Dick
Could. "We're No. 1 until
we're beaten. However, this
year, since we've lost four of
our top five starters, we're
going to have to prove ourse
lves. Trinity and Southern

Methodist University have
their entire teams back and are
going to be teams to reckon
with."
Trinity, the No. 2 ranked
team, brings back the same
team that defeated the Cards
two years ago enroute to win
ning the National Indoor
Championships.
The Cards gained revenge,
dumping the Tigers in the
NCAA finals. But Trinity's Eric
Ishersky is hot, recently win
ning the intercollegiate All -
American tournament and es
tablishing himself as one of the
favorites for the NCAA singles
title. All-Americans Tony
Ciamaba and Larry Gottfried
will back up Ishersky.
SMU also is a threat to Stan
ford's reign. The Mustangs'
only casualty to graduation is
No. 3 man Haroom Ismad. Ad
ditions could more than make
up for Ismad as Junior Wimb
ledon finalist Jeff Turpin and
UCLA transfer Drew Gitlin join
the squad. Add them to the al
ready solid group which in
cludes Jai DiLouie, Mark Fur
pin and Chris Delaney, and you
have a definite challenger.
"They (Trinity and SMU) are
both more experienced than
us," points out Gould, "but we
have a better chance than any
body to beat them. Potentially
we have a really good team. We
have a good blend of experi

enced and young players. I'm
expecting a lot from them this
year."
The biggest test for the net
ters will come in the period of
March 10-15. The Cards must
put their No. 1 ranking on the
line against both SMU (Match
10) and Trinity (March 15) at

Stanford, where the Cards
have not lost a match in two
years. Sandwiched in between,
Stanford hosts No. 9 Texas.
All in all Stanford promises
to be an exciting team with an
exciting schedule including
seven of the nation's top 10
schools.
