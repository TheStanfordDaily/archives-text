White named
Junior Nancy White has been
honored as Stanford Athlete of
the Month for January by the
Stickney Sports Foundation.
Besides being named to the U.S.
National Field Hockey Squad,
White was also one of 11
nominees for the Broderick
Award, given annually to the
nation's top field hockey
player.
A McLean, Va., native,
White led Stanford to a
second-place finish in the 1978
Region 8 Tournament.
Spikers open CIVA
Led by middle blocker Rod
Fletcher, hitter Randy Smith
and setter Kip Engen, Stan
ford's volleyball team makes its
1979 California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association debut
tonight at Roble Gymnasium at
7:30 p.m. against Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo.

The Cards have been idle
since defeating Santa Clara Jan.
30, but should be motivated
toward revenge tonight, as it
was Cal Poly-SLO which
knocked Stanford out of NCAA
west regional contention in
1978.

Championship tennis team
begins its 1979 slate tomorrow

All-Americans: seniors Susie
Hagey and Diane Morrison and
sophomore Kathy Jordan.
Other participants include
freshmen Sue Rasmussen,
Julie Leighton and Lisa Gor
don, sophomores Donna
Rubin and Corinne Nevinny
and senior Marianne Ingard.
