# Gymnasts host Spartans, Trojans
## 
### Dean Eyre 
In the final combined gym
nastics meet of the season,
Stanford's men host San Jose
State and USC while the
women take on the Northern
California Athletic Conference
defending champ Spartans to
night at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavil
ion.
Jackie Walker's women, now
2-3, are underdogs in their
match-up with San Jose, but
don't count them out. "I still
think that they should beat us,
but there's a chance that we
could beat them, "Walker said.
"It's kind of like the Hayward
meet — if they have an
average-type meet, they'll beat
us. But if they were to have a
bad night while we have a good
night, then there's the possibil
ity of winning," she added.
Stanford's best team total
ever was earned in last Friday's
competition at Davis — a
school mark of 125.55. The
Spartans posted a 122.85 total
while hosting the Aggies last
week, but due to the very na
ture of judging, such indirect
comparisons aren't necessarily
accurate.
Walker noted progressive
improvement in the team
members' routines and a very
positive attitude for the up

coming meet. Tonight's line
up consists of Karen Hall,
Annie Smith, Linda Park and
Pilar Ossorio going all-around,
Cindy Stevenson performing
in all events except beam,
Cindy Sedlund in all events ex
cept bars, Jeanette Lacoste on
beam and bars and Julie Love in
floor exercise.
"Karen practiced tumbling
for the first time since January
(due to an injured ankle) and
will hopefully practice vault
ing," Walker said. "She's im
proving steadily on beam and
bars. Gradually, the girls are
working harder and harder as
they get into the season. I think
they really have a strong feel
ing about wanting to win this
meet," Walker asserted.
The change from small
crowds of relatives and friends
in club meets to larger audi

ences in college is something
the gymnasts have "learned to
appreciate. If we have a good
audience, it will help inspire
the girls," Walker added.
Carrying a 3-1 record into
this evening's three-way meet,
the men's team also competes
tomorrow night at Berkeley's
Harmon gym against host
California, Davis and Long
Beach City College.
"We are going to have very
light warmups," Coach Sadao
Hamada explained. "We're not
going to spend too much time
because two days of competi
tion is a lot of a workout for
those guys and if they do too
much there's always a higher
chance of injuries. They've got
to prepare themselves men
tally more than physically.

"San Jose State has been
scoring right around 200
points, so according to their
score they should be pretty
close to us," Hamada said.
"USC has been getting about
206 so they are a little ahead of
us. But you never know — the
judging may balance out and
(the results) be different. One
thing I know about USC is that
they have very good
all-around gymnasts — one
who can score 54 and maybe a
couple 52s or 535."
As for tomorrow's oppo
nents, Stanford has already
hosted Cal and visited Davis,
coming up short against the
Golden Bears while recording
a win over the Aggies.
"Long Beach has one of the
best junior college programs in
the country," Hamada said.
"Most of the kids who can't get

into a four-year college go
there and train and bring their
grade point average up so they
can transfer. They always have
a very good team. I don't have
any results from them but
probably they are doing about
200 points plus."
Unfortunately for the Cards,
Cal will be even stronger than
in their previous meeting.
"Their best guy is back,"
Hamada said. "He cleared
eligibility problems and is
competing at about 56 points in
all-around. They scored 218
(compared to Stanford's sea
son best of 201.35) so they're
going way over a 9.0 average
(per person per event). We are
a good year or two behind Cal
right now. Next year I can give
them a pretty good challenge
and the year after probably I
can be a little ahead of them."
