# A.P. SUMMARY

### 
Pro-Khomeini marches persist
Tehran, Iran — Hundreds of soldiers marched
along with a million other Iranians in Tehran yes
terday in a show of support for an anti-shah re
volutionary government. But Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar held his ground, vowing he will
not surrender power to a "mob."
The leader of the "transitional government" try
ing to oust Bakhtiar was quoted as saying
Washington has "indirectly" expressed a desire to
establish good relations with a future revolutio
nary regime.
Marches here and in other Iranian cities were
generally peaceful, but new political violence
flared in the provincial towns of Gorgan and Koi.
State radio said more than one million people
took part in the Tehran march in support of Ayatul
lah Ruhollah Khomeini's designation of a rival
government headed by Moslem nationalist Mehdi
Bazargan.
Khomeini, who returned to Iran last week after
leading the anti-shah movement from exile, wants
the Bakhtiar government to resign, the monarchy
to be abolished and a religiously oriented Islamic
republic to be established.
Peace talks may reconvene
Egypt accepted an American invitation yesterday
to take part in ministerial-level peace talks aimed
at breaking the deadlock with Israel.
Israel also is expected to agree to attend the
talks, which probably will be at Camp David, Md.,
later this month.
The likely participants are Egyptian Foreign
Minister Mustafa Khalil, Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat accepted the
invitation delivered in Cairo by U.S. Ambassador
Hermann Eilts. The Israeli Cabinet met to consider
the invitation, but put off a decision until its regu
lar meeting Sunday.
Israeli officials said Dayan almost certainly
would attend the talks. Eilts said the date and place
of the meeting will not be disclosed until Israel
announces whether it will attend.
The Israeli-Egyptian negotiations have been stal
led since November. Shuttle diplomacy by roving
Ambassador Alfred Atherton last month failed to
get them going again.

High court to rehear Tanner case
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court
voted yesterday to reconsider its Dec. 22 Tanner
decision which weakened the "use a gun, go to
prison" law, the case that cast a cloud over the
high court.
The court set March 7 at Sacramento for the
rehearing. Its action leaves the status of numerous
state laws uncertain, including those requiring
prison terms for heroin sale, attacks on the elderly
and violent crimes by parolees.
The court's decision in the case of armed robber
Harold Tanner declared that a 1975 mandatory
prison law did not prevent a judge from granting
probation in exceptional cases.
The ruling prompted a flurry of legislation to
restore the gun law and other mandatory-prison
laws endangered by the decision.
Confidence in Carter drops
New York — The public's rating of President
Jimmy Carter's work has sunk almost to the lowest
levels of his administration in the wake of the
turmoil in Iran and the lack of a peace pact in the
Mideast, a new Associated Press-NBC News poll
shows.
A significant part of the drop for Carter — which
totaled eight points since December — came
among Democrats, an important group for him,
just a year before the start of the 1980 presidential
primaries.
Twenty-eight percent of those questioned
nationwide Monday and Tuesday said the presi
dent is doing a good or excellent job. That's down
from the ib percent found by the December
AP-NBC News poll.
The major source for the drop in Carter's rating
was foreign policy, the area where successes last
year gave his standing such a boost.
Gov't to push alcohol education
Washington — Almost two years after warning
pregnant women that drinking increases the risk
of birth defects, the government said yesterday it
will push a national education program before
considering a requirement for warning labels on
alcoholic beverages.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms

said itwould use warning labels on beer, wine and
liquor bottles as a last resort if the education prog
ram fails to arouse the public to the problem.
Even though the Food and Drug Administration
and others have called for warning labels, Assis
tant Treasury Secretary Richard Davis said labels
may be premature because the problem is not fully
understood.
The program coordinated by the Treasury De
partment will include public service announce
ments on television and radio, education efforts in
schools and distributing brochures to the public
and medical profession.
Future tax cuts to be considered
Washington — Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal said yesterday the Carter administration
intends to rely in the future on income tax cuts,
rather than higher spending, to stimulate the
economy.
Although itwould be dangerous to reduce taxes
in 1980, he told the Senate Budget Committee, the
economy may require a tax cut in 1981. Blumenthal
conceded the necessity of such a reduction would
further delay Carter's goal of balancing the
budget.
In the recent past, Congress has used a mixture
of tax cuts and spending increases, such as for
public works and job creation, to fight recession.
In the future, Blumenthal said, "This administra
tion is determined to restrain the growth of federal
expenditures and to rely principally on the private
sector as the source of economic growth."
Market rises slightly
New York — The stock market recorded its first
gain in a week yesterday in a mild upswing led by
coal and independent oil and gas issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
had lost 24.86 points over the past four sessions,
eked out a 2.86 gain to 818.87.
Volume on the Big Board slowed t023.36 million
shares from 28.45 million the day before.
Today's weather
Overcast clearing Friday. Increasing clouds Fri
day night becoming cloudy Saturday, little temp
erature change. Lows in upper 30s and 40s. Highs
in mid to upper 50s. Westerly winds to 15 mph in
the afternoons.

Jimmy Carter's work has sunk almost to the lowest
levels of his administration in the wake of the
turmoil in Iran and the lack of a peace pact in the
Mideast, a new Associated Press-NBC News poll
shows.
A significant part of the drop for Carter — which
totaled eight points since December — came
among Democrats, an important group for him,
just a year before the start of the 1980 presidential
primaries.
Twenty-eight percent of those questioned
nationwide Monday and Tuesday said the presi
dent is doing a good or excellent job. That's down
from the ib percent found by the December
AP-NBC News poll.
The major source for the drop in Carter's rating
was foreign policy, the area where successes last
year gave his standing such a boost.
Gov't to push alcohol education
Washington — Almost two years after warning
pregnant women that drinking increases the risk
of birth defects, the government said yesterday it
will push a national education program before
considering a requirement for warning labels on
alcoholic beverages.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms

said itwould use warning labels on beer, wine and
liquor bottles as a last resort if the education prog
ram fails to arouse the public to the problem.
Even though the Food and Drug Administration
and others have called for warning labels, Assis
tant Treasury Secretary Richard Davis said labels
may be premature because the problem is not fully
understood.
The program coordinated by the Treasury De
partment will include public service announce
ments on television and radio, education efforts in
schools and distributing brochures to the public
and medical profession.
Future tax cuts to be considered
Washington — Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal said yesterday the Carter administration
intends to rely in the future on income tax cuts,
rather than higher spending, to stimulate the
economy.
Although itwould be dangerous to reduce taxes
in 1980, he told the Senate Budget Committee, the
economy may require a tax cut in 1981. Blumenthal
conceded the necessity of such a reduction would
further delay Carter's goal of balancing the
budget.
In the recent past, Congress has used a mixture
of tax cuts and spending increases, such as for
public works and job creation, to fight recession.
In the future, Blumenthal said, "This administra
tion is determined to restrain the growth of federal
expenditures and to rely principally on the private
sector as the source of economic growth."
Market rises slightly
New York — The stock market recorded its first
gain in a week yesterday in a mild upswing led by
coal and independent oil and gas issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
had lost 24.86 points over the past four sessions,
eked out a 2.86 gain to 818.87.
Volume on the Big Board slowed t023.36 million
shares from 28.45 million the day before.
Today's weather
Overcast clearing Friday. Increasing clouds Fri
day night becoming cloudy Saturday, little temp
erature change. Lows in upper 30s and 40s. Highs
in mid to upper 50s. Westerly winds to 15 mph in
the afternoons.
Pro-Khomeini marches persist
Tehran, Iran — Hundreds of soldiers marched
along with a million other Iranians in Tehran yes
terday in a show of support for an anti-shah re
volutionary government. But Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar held his ground, vowing he will
not surrender power to a "mob."
The leader of the "transitional government" try
ing to oust Bakhtiar was quoted as saying
Washington has "indirectly" expressed a desire to
establish good relations with a future revolutio
nary regime.
Marches here and in other Iranian cities were
generally peaceful, but new political violence
flared in the provincial towns of Gorgan and Koi.
State radio said more than one million people
took part in the Tehran march in support of Ayatul
lah Ruhollah Khomeini's designation of a rival
government headed by Moslem nationalist Mehdi
Bazargan.
Khomeini, who returned to Iran last week after
leading the anti-shah movement from exile, wants
the Bakhtiar government to resign, the monarchy
to be abolished and a religiously oriented Islamic
republic to be established.
Peace talks may reconvene
Egypt accepted an American invitation yesterday
to take part in ministerial-level peace talks aimed
at breaking the deadlock with Israel.
Israel also is expected to agree to attend the
talks, which probably will be at Camp David, Md.,
later this month.
The likely participants are Egyptian Foreign
Minister Mustafa Khalil, Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat accepted the
invitation delivered in Cairo by U.S. Ambassador
Hermann Eilts. The Israeli Cabinet met to consider
the invitation, but put off a decision until its regu
lar meeting Sunday.
Israeli officials said Dayan almost certainly
would attend the talks. Eilts said the date and place
of the meeting will not be disclosed until Israel
announces whether it will attend.
The Israeli-Egyptian negotiations have been stal
led since November. Shuttle diplomacy by roving
Ambassador Alfred Atherton last month failed to
get them going again.

High court to rehear Tanner case
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court
voted yesterday to reconsider its Dec. 22 Tanner
decision which weakened the "use a gun, go to
prison" law, the case that cast a cloud over the
high court.
The court set March 7 at Sacramento for the
rehearing. Its action leaves the status of numerous
state laws uncertain, including those requiring
prison terms for heroin sale, attacks on the elderly
and violent crimes by parolees.
The court's decision in the case of armed robber
Harold Tanner declared that a 1975 mandatory
prison law did not prevent a judge from granting
probation in exceptional cases.
The ruling prompted a flurry of legislation to
restore the gun law and other mandatory-prison
laws endangered by the decision.
