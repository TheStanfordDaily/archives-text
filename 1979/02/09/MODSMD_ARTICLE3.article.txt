# Senate districting suggestion strongly supported by Stamos
## 
### Rob Lempert Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate should come out with an election
reform proposal intended for the spring ballot within
three weeks, according to senate chairperson Peter
Stamos.
Speaking on K/SU's Campus Conference, Stamos said
his best guess is that the senate's proposal will be some
thing along the lines of a districting plan combined with
some means of staggering elections.
He said that after the senate announces its plan, it will
be brought forward to as many constituents as possible,
brought back to the senate, debated, and put forward
with a strong recommendation hy the senate."
Rules committee
However, Sen. John Struthers, chairman of the Senate
Rules committee, said that last night his group divided
itself into three sub-committees to consider various as
pects of senate and constitutional reform. He said he
expects the reform legislation to be in committee for at
least several weeks.
Stamos also predicted the senate will come up with at
least one other election reform proposal to put on the
ballot, one which it favors less strongly than its other
recommendation.
"Overall the senate districting proposal i* perhaps the
best," Stamos said. This proposal would divide the cam
pus into districts along residential and departmental
lines and have each district elect one or two senators.
Stamos said these divisions could be similar to the dis
tricts this year's senate has created.

This year each senator was assigned a district to repre
sent after the election and is supposedly responsible for
soliciting opinions from students in that district and for
keeping them informed of the senate's activities.
Stamos said that the districting plan would make
senators responsible for maintaining "constant contact"
with the students in their district. He added that
"coupled with something like staggered elections," the
senate would bee ome more responsible under the plan.
Attacking the present system of electing senators at
large, Stamos said students feel they are voting for "a
posterand a face." There is "very little contact" between
students and candidates, he said, and while voters are

allowed to vote for 10 candidates, they hardly know
more than two or three.
More personal
Under the districting system, where each set of candi
dates would be vying for the approval of only a lew
hundred voters, every candidate would have the oppor
tunity to meet "every single one" of his potential con
stituents, according to Stamos.
He added that minorities would be well represented
under such a system because "it would provide all indi
viduals the right to show their merits as human beings,
not as black or white, male or female."
Stamos said that districting would put more minorities
on the senate than there are now. He described the
present makeup of the senate as "pretty sad." There is
only one black and one woman.
'Structural problems'
Stamos said that the live-petition proposal was an "in
teresting idea" deserving of consideration, but that
there are "structural problems involved in sue h .1 proce
dure." He said it would be difficult to keep track of the
constantly changing roster of the senate < aused by such
a system.
The live-petition plan, described in the r ppnn of last
year's election review board, would eliminate traditional
elections and allow any person with the support of 200
students a seat in the senate for as long as he 01 she
maintained that support.
Stamos also claimed that the live-petition plan would
not allow a senator to fulfill his "double responsibility"
of serving as both a delegate ot his constituency and a
trustee expressing his own convictions.
Stamos praised his colleagues in the senate for their
performance so far this year. He cited their hard work in
writing legislation, attending committee meetings, ap
pearing before their constituents in their districts.
Describing this year's senate as "encouraging,"
Stamos said he hopes next year's will be even "more
encouraging." He said that the efforts of the present
senators on projects such as lighted tennis courts, mail
boxes in dorms, and reorganizing the Academic Organi
zations Board should attract more voters in the upcom
ing spring and fall elections, which will in turn impart a
larger sense of responsibility to the new batch of
senators.

encouraging." He said that the efforts of the present
senators on projects such as lighted tennis courts, mail
boxes in dorms, and reorganizing the Academic Organi
zations Board should attract more voters in the upcom
ing spring and fall elections, which will in turn impart a
larger sense of responsibility to the new batch of
senators.
The ASSU Senate should come out with an election
reform proposal intended for the spring ballot within
three weeks, according to senate chairperson Peter
Stamos.
Speaking on K/SU's Campus Conference, Stamos said
his best guess is that the senate's proposal will be some
thing along the lines of a districting plan combined with
some means of staggering elections.
He said that after the senate announces its plan, it will
be brought forward to as many constituents as possible,
brought back to the senate, debated, and put forward
with a strong recommendation hy the senate."
Rules committee
However, Sen. John Struthers, chairman of the Senate
Rules committee, said that last night his group divided
itself into three sub-committees to consider various as
pects of senate and constitutional reform. He said he
expects the reform legislation to be in committee for at
least several weeks.
Stamos also predicted the senate will come up with at
least one other election reform proposal to put on the
ballot, one which it favors less strongly than its other
recommendation.
"Overall the senate districting proposal i* perhaps the
best," Stamos said. This proposal would divide the cam
pus into districts along residential and departmental
lines and have each district elect one or two senators.
Stamos said these divisions could be similar to the dis
tricts this year's senate has created.
Liaison
This year each senator was assigned a district to repre
sent after the election and is supposedly responsible for
soliciting opinions from students in that district and for
keeping them informed of the senate's activities.
Stamos said that the districting plan would make
senators responsible for maintaining "constant contact"
with the students in their district. He added that
"coupled with something like staggered elections," the
senate would bee ome more responsible under the plan.
Attacking the present system of electing senators at
large, Stamos said students feel they are voting for "a
posterand a face." There is "very little contact" between
students and candidates, he said, and while voters are

allowed to vote for 10 candidates, they hardly know
more than two or three.
More personal
Under the districting system, where each set of candi
dates would be vying for the approval of only a lew
hundred voters, every candidate would have the oppor
tunity to meet "every single one" of his potential con
stituents, according to Stamos.
He added that minorities would be well represented
under such a system because "it would provide all indi
viduals the right to show their merits as human beings,
not as black or white, male or female."
Stamos said that districting would put more minorities
on the senate than there are now. He described the
present makeup of the senate as "pretty sad." There is
only one black and one woman.
'Structural problems'
Stamos said that the live-petition proposal was an "in
teresting idea" deserving of consideration, but that
there are "structural problems involved in sue h .1 proce
dure." He said it would be difficult to keep track of the
constantly changing roster of the senate < aused by such
a system.
The live-petition plan, described in the r ppnn of last
year's election review board, would eliminate traditional
elections and allow any person with the support of 200
students a seat in the senate for as long as he 01 she
maintained that support.
Stamos also claimed that the live-petition plan would
not allow a senator to fulfill his "double responsibility"
of serving as both a delegate ot his constituency and a
trustee expressing his own convictions.
Stamos praised his colleagues in the senate for their
performance so far this year. He cited their hard work in
writing legislation, attending committee meetings, ap
pearing before their constituents in their districts.
Describing this year's senate as "encouraging,"
Stamos said he hopes next year's will be even "more
encouraging." He said that the efforts of the present
senators on projects such as lighted tennis courts, mail
boxes in dorms, and reorganizing the Academic Organi
zations Board should attract more voters in the upcom
ing spring and fall elections, which will in turn impart a
larger sense of responsibility to the new batch of
senators.
