# Year-long investigation ends
## Med Center billed for Medi-Cal errors 
### Seth Zuckerman 
The University will have to pay
Medi-Cal approximately $300,000
which it "did not deliberately" over
charge the state organization over
the past three years, Lawrence Crow
ley, acting dean of the Medical
School, said yesterday at a press con
ference.
This readjustment comes as a re
sult of a year-long investigation into
Medical Center billing practices
conducted by the State Department
of Health Services.
The investigators concluded that
the Medical Center had overesti
mated its medical-related expenses
because its recQrds of the time fa
culty physicians spent on Medi-Cal
patients were not accurate enough.
However, the Department of
Health will still permit the Med
Center to charge for indirect services
provided Medi-Cal patients.
The exact amount to be returned
to Medi-Cal will be determined
within the next three months when
an audit of the Med Center's Medi-
Cal expenses for 1976 and 1977 is
completed. The University has also
agreed to reopen the books for re
evaluation of the amount it should
have received from Medi-Cal in 1975.
Two parts to reimbursement
Medi-Cal reimbursement of the
Med Center is composed of two
parts â€” professional fees and indi
rect expenses. Professional fees are
the standard rates charged for
"hands-on" treatment by a faculty

physician, one who actually sees the
patient. Indirect expenses include
compensation of the Med Center
tor the time physicians spend on ad
ministrative tasks and supervision of
interns treating Medi-Cal patients.
Indirect expenses make up a sub
stantial portion of the total reim
bursement.
Controversy has revolved around
two issues.at the Med Center. The
first is whether the University may
charge for the time its faculty physi
cians spend advising interns on the
therapy to be administered. Crowley
said the recent settlement allows the
Med Center to do so.
The other point under discussion,
still being investigated by the State
Board of Medical Quality Assurance,
is whether the Med Center may col
lect money from Medi-Cal for the

treatment its faculty physicians pro
vide. It is alleged that the regulations
of the Medi-Cal program prohibit en
tities such as the Med Center from
being reimbursed by Medi-Cal with
out a "fictitious name permit" which
the Med Center does not have.
'Closes investigation'
According to Crowley, this settle
ment marks the end of the so-called
"double-billing" controversy, since
the State Department of Health has
told the University that it "formally
closes the Medi-Cal investigation of
the Medical Center's billing prac
tices."
However, Eugene Dong, associate
professor of cardiovascular surgery,
said he sees continued difficulties
since it appears that Medi-Cal has not
thoroughly investigated its own reg
ulations." Medi-Cal has "ducked"

the issue of whether payment for in
direct treatment is legal in the first
place, he added.
"What this (the decision) says is
that there apparently was double bil
ling" and that the University over
charged Medi-Cal, Dong said.
Adjustment not uncommon
On the other hand, Crowley
claimed that "adjustments are not
uncommon in claims of that size in
an extremely complex two-part
reimbursement system." The Uni
versity receives approximately $9
million from Medi-Cal every year.
Medi-Cal patients comprise 15 per
cent of the in-patient traffic at the
Med Center, C said.

Bureau, said the Med Center charges
