# Alumnus donates fine minerals
## 
### Mark Wharry 
A mineral collection containing
some 1000 specimens is being do
nated to the University. Howard
Piatt, a retired engineer and an
alumnus, is presenting the collec
tion, which contains many spec
tacular examples of naturally
formed crystals, to the School of
Earth Sciences.
The value of the Piatt collection
has been set at approximately
$110,000 by professional apprais
ers, according to Prof. Cordon
Brown of the Geology Dept., who
is the curator of the University's
mineralogy collection.
About half of the Piatt collection
is from areas outside the United
States. "The gift contains a
number of very fine specimens
which we will put on permanent
display," said Brown. "His gift will
fill many gaps in Stanford's pre
sent collections, particularly in
the quartz family. We now have
60-70,000 specimens, most of
which are used for teaching and
research." Piatt also has made a
gift of $10,000 for the display case,
which will include sophisticated
security devices, added Brown.
The minerals will soon be on dis
play in the lobby of the Mitchell
Earth Sciences Building.
Interest sparked
Piatt graduated from the Uni
versity in 19<f* w'th a degree in
civil engineering. His interest in
minerals was .paiked by an un
dergraduate geology course.
"I've been pursuing an interest in
minerals for the last 35 years,"
said Piatt.
Throughout his life, he col
lected specimens from all over the
world, supplementing his hobby
with reading and study.
In 1953, Piatt joined the El
Dorado County Mineral Society,
and later became its president. He
has displayed specimens at min
eral shows and has served as a
judge of competitive exhibits.
Crystal mine
Piatt's family joined in his
hobby, accompanying him on
field trips and probing a crystal
mine he purchased. The mine,
noted for quartz of fine quality
and varieties of colors, produced
many of the specimens included

in the Piatt collection.
Piatt said his main intent is to
benefit the University with the
donation. "My wish is to encour
age other people to give similar
donations. I don't want the pub
licity for myself, but rather to help
the University."
The engineer worked for water
departments in San Francisco and

Marin County after graduation,
and fpr the Federal Water Com
mission. Later he worked for
Bechtel Corp. of San Francisco
and with the Pacific Bridge Co.
Piatt turned to ranching in El
Dorado County in 1946, and re
cently retired with his wife to
Cameron Park, east of Sac
ramento.
