# Durham analyzes 'Soccer War'
## 
### Mark Townsend 
In 1969, El Salvador and Honduras
went to war. The brief but bloody fight
occurred soon after the two countries
had met each other in the playoffs for
the 1969 World Cup soccer match, and
♦he Western press quickly dubbed the
conflict the "Soccer War." It came to be
known as the first of a new breed — an
international assault caused by the
pressures of overpopulation.
William Durham, assistant professor
in both the Department of Anthropol
ogy and the Human Biology Program
here, has spent much of the last four
years researching the causes and con
sequences of the so-called Soccer War.
His project was funded in part by the
National Science Foundation, and what
he has compiled will by early summer
appear as a new book Scarcity and Sur
vival in Central America (Stanford Univ.
Press).
Durham began the study, as he puts
it, "because there had never been a
thorough analysis of the causes of the

war, despite its importance as an im
puted population problem.' "
Population dense
Little El Salvador is a country with a
population more dense than India's,
and it continues to grow at a record
breaking rate, Durham points out in his
book. In the course of several decades
before 1969 some 300,000 Salvadoreans
had migrated to less populated Hon
duras. That year, Durham says, the
Honduran government began to uproot
these people to send them home. El Sal
vador immediately closed its borders to
the immigrants, hoping tha» Honduras
would relocate them. This, however,
did not happen and El Salvador at
tacked, charging "genocide" against its
neighbor, Durham says. The 100-hour
war was stopped by the intervention of
the Organization of American States.
The thrust of Durham's research
explores not only why the Salvadoreans
migrated to Honduras, but also at
tempts to answer the following ques
tions: "Why did the Honduras govern

ment . . . remove many of them from
the countryside?" and "Why did the
government of El Salvador . . . see their
expulsion as a reason to invade Hon
duras?"
'Controversial'
The answers to these questions will
make the published book, Durham
says, "quite controversial." For instead
of the explanation offered by most
human ecologists — that overpopula
tion was the chief force behind the con
flict — Durham demonstrates that it was
not the crush of people but the uneven
distribution of the land among them
that caused the 300,000 to leave.
The turmoil within El Salvador today
shows that the country's problems are
still mounting. With no land reform
measure in sight, radical terrorists since
1976 have claimed the lives of the
nation's top officials, Durham said.
"El Salvador is forgoing the chance for
a peaceful change," Durham says." This
will be a rough decade for Central
America."
