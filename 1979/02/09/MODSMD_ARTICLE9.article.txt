### Rod Stevens 
Dear Bug Me:
I am a tour guide at Hoover and have been
asked many times if there was ever an incident in
which a sniper went up to the top of the tower
and shot at people. Was there?
-T.C. (Tour Guide)
The University archivists say no.

Dear Bug Me: ,
I noticed some rock artists are well rep
resented in the Meyer Audio Services, but to my
dismay I found no recording by Led Zeppelin, or
Deep Purple, and only one by the Doors. Why?
-R.N.
Two hundred more rock albums have been
ordered in an attempt to build a representative
collection, according to Tesse Santoro, as
sociate librarian at Meyer. Santoro, a self
proclaimed "rock fanatic," said she tries to get
at least one album of artists with some promise
of permanent popularity. "We even have the
Sex Pistols," she said. Major groups like the
Stones and Beatles have complete listings. San
toro said if you drop your rock selections, as
well as those for jazz, country-western, and
classical, in the box on the second floor of
Meyer she will usually send a personal reply.
Dear Bug Me:
I heard that lane Stanford once commissioned
a painter to represent her and Little.Leland as the
Madonna and Child. Is there any truth to this?
-E.M.
No such painting exists, according to Lorenz
Eitner, director of the University Museum.
However he said there is a work in the Museum
painted in 1876, which has been sarcastically
termed "the Holy Family." It shows the Stanford
family, friends and relatives in a bucolic Palo

Alto setting.

Dear Bug Me:
About two months ago the University planted
a new lawn, complete with fertilizer and
sprinklers, on Mayfield Ave. across from Durand
and Hurlburt houses. Nothing appears to have
been done since and the field is still pretty bare.
Why?
-D.F.
Crass on the "Mayfield Playfield" won't be
fully green until spring returns to this fair cam
pus in late March or April, according to Larry
Atwater, grounds supervisor. "Three's nothing
we can do at this time of year to make it grow,
since the frosts send the grass into dormancy."
Some row residents have complained that
people playing on the field now will ruin it later.
Atwater commented that these people "aren't
helping the grass grow," but that they can still
expect a fairly lush carpet later this year.

Dear Bug Me:
To whom should complaints about the Mar
guerite shuttle buses be addressed? The green
and white buses regularly leave trails of as
phyxiated cyclists behind them on Serra Street.
-L.N.
)ohn Pipkin, traffic manager, is responsible
for their service and handles complaints. Pipkin
said he called Peninsula Charter Lines, which
rents the buses to the University, and found
they will fine-tune the engines. He said this
should eliminate most of the exhaust, but until
the new buses arrive in November to replace
them, we'll have to live with some smoke.
