## God calls Stanford 'the greatest' 
### 
Stanford is one of the five greatest uni
versities in the history of civilization, ac
cording to the creator of the universe.
A survey covering three millennia of re
corded history may appear in a future
issue of Change magazine. According to
the survey, the top five universities, in al
phabetical order, are University of
Alexandria, Oxford, Peking University, the
Sorbonne and Stanford.
University President Richard Lyman said
of the soon-to-be released divine procla
mation, "This is certainly a great honor,
although I can't honestly say I'm sur
prised. This is the sort of recognition our
school deserves."
The Lord and two of his aides, Christ and
Moses, offered their praises and criticisms
of the University on KZSU's Campus Con
ference last night.
The Lord gave top marks to Stanford's
strength in the sciences. He lauded the
tremendous strides researchers are mak
ing in recombinant DNA research and in
nuclear physics, because "I am very busy,
and these folks are taking a lot of my own
work off my hands."
His view of the humanities was more
guarded, however. He spoke highly of the
History Dept., calling Professor Lewis
Spitz "a true friend and the man who
knows me best."
But God admitted he was dismayed at
the ever-shrinking budget and faculty of

the Religious Studies Dept., "for personal
reasons."
The Lord rated Stanford's academic
strengths and weaknesses, but He en
trusted the evaluation of social life here to
His aides. Christ and Moses spent several
days on campus, often completely un
noticed. They visited the Church ("sincere
but overdone," was the Savior's opinion)
and audited "Human Sexuality."
lesus paid special attention to the dining
halls, as he is an expert at feeding large
groups of people on a budget. "We all
have our crosses to bear," he quipped
while struggling with a Wilbur veal cutlet.
The only unpleasantness during their
visit occurred at the CPPC, where a career
counselor berated them for their long hair
and shabby dress. "You'll never get an in
terview looking like that," she said mourn
fully.
Moses was happy with the success of
ethnic theme houses on campus but did
not understand why Jews were the only
ethnic group not to be so favored. )esus
was happy with the spiritual condition of
the students, noting that "what Stanford
students lack in understanding and toler
ance, they sure make up for with zeal."
Political Science Prof. Seymour Martin
Lipset was critical of the Lord's finding be
cause "cultural and chronological differ
ences make comparisons between Stan
ford and the Sorbonne implausible,

though flattering." The Lord, however,
staunchly defended the results of the sur
vey. Though Stanford's library system is
not particularly large, God felt that the
comfortable chairs in UGLY more than
made up for the unavailability of one
fourth of the library collection.
(The recent deluge in Meyer Basement,
now revealed to be an intentional "act of
God," has led librarians to experiment
with freeze-dried books. Folgers has al
ready contracted with the library to de
velop caffeine-coated "information crys
tals" which will make studying as easy as
brewing a cup of coffee.)
Stanford was far and away the best uni
versity in the history of civilization in many
fields including: number of shade trees,
size of campus, friendliness of squirrels
and engineering. And, as Athletic Director
Andy Geiger wafi proud to point out, Stan
ford has made more Rose Bowl appear
ances than Oxford and the University of
Alexrndria combined.
1 he Lord expressed satisfaction with the
completion of the survey. The time
consuming work was made much more
difficult by the sudden departure of the
Lord's brightest aide, Mephistopheles.
After being fired for his "shameless lack of
concern for morals, decency and higher
education," Mephisto left the Lord's ser
vice and went to work at USC.
