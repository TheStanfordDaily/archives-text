## Female escorts advocated 
### 
The male escort service de
signed to "combat the growing
problem of rape on campus"
(Daily, )an. 24) is clearly well
intentioned. The apparent wil
lingness of a handful of male
students to acknowledge that
rape is a real and immediate
problem here is encouraging.
However, providing male
escorts forwomen is a frighten
ingly ironic strategy. It pre
sumes that men hold power
that controls or determines the
destiny of women. As escorts,
they generously offer this
power as a means of protec
tion. This attitude overlooks
the fact that women are quite
capable of protecting them
selves. j
Rape is a man's violent at
tempt to subjugate, degrade
and conquer another person.
Most often, the victim of that
violence is a woman; the rapist
is always a man. In the most
neutral terms possible, rape is
an exercise of power by a man
who is trying to assert superior
ity over another individual.
The attitude underlying the

idea of a male escort service is
that one man can (and should?)
protect a woman from another
man. That is undoubtedly true
in many situations, thanks to a
culture that has linked female
nessto weakness forcenturies.
But women need not be
weak. Nor should we have to
rely on other people to protect
us. Certainly, when protection
is available to us, we should
take advantage of it.
Once we acknowledge our
own vulnerability, we must
learn how to protect ourselves.
If we don't, we will either con
tinue to pretend that rape is an
improbability in our lives, or
we will find ourselves crippled
with fear that there is a rapist
waiting behind every tree and
in every dark doorway.
There are numerous publica
tions on protecting oneself
from rape, including the Rape
Education Project booklet
Working Against Rape Th?re is
a women's self-defense collec
tive here that meets Mondays
ats: <op.m Roble Gym. The

YWCA is offering a series of
Thursday noon meetings
featuring both discussion and
practice of self-defense
techniques.
It is not always possible to
avoid potentially dangerous
situations, such as walking
alone at night. However, de
pending on a male escort ser
vice is far from the only solu
tion, nor is it a comfortable op
tion for many women.
As pointed out earlier, its
implicit paternalism disregards
that women have, within and
among ourselves, the strength,
self-confidence and intelli
gence to avoid or escape
dangerous situations.
An escort service that pro
vides people for protection is
an excellent idea. But until
women here realize that the
campus is not a safe place to be
alone after dark (and, at times,
in broad daylight); and until we
decide that we can prot3Ct our
selves, it is unlikely that any es
cort service will be used.
We strongly urge Ron Lepow
to recruit both women and

men for his escort service, and
to allow each woman who uses
the service to choose a female
or male escort. There have
been instances, at other uni
versities, of male escorts rap
ing the women they were
asked to protect.
Any woman who fears for
her safety should have the op
tion of choosing her means of
protection. If not, she may opt
instead to enter a dangerous
situation with no protection at
al!
And to any woman who
thinks that rape "can't happen
to her:" don't be a fool. Face
the realities of rape now. Rec
ognize and accept your own
vulnerability; then learn how
to protect yourself. A rapist
doesn't care what you think,
but what (sic) you are.
Wouldn't you rather face the
reality on your own than to be
brutally confronted with it at
the hands of another?
