## Liberalism in Italy's communists 
### 
Only one thing is certain fol
lowing the fall of the thirty
fourth postwar Italian govern
ment: for the thirty-third time,
American newspapers will cull
their files to offer their readers
the same account.
That account will express
fear of the possible growth of
communist participation in
government, and concern that
state control of the economy
will accelerate.
There is good reason to de
sire a change in the focus of
press coverage. To be sure,
unquestioning acceptance of
Italian Communist Party (PCI)
vows to slash the size of the
bureaucracy is no answer.
But the American press is de
relict to mention these pledges
only to question the "sincer
ity" of the PCl's general polti
cal commitments, especially to

democracy. This only accuses
the 34 percent of Italians who
voted for the PCi in the last
general election of being
either dupes or partners in
duplicity.
Worse still, by confirming
American Cold War pre
judices, it obscures the real is
sues at stake in Italy today.
The plain fact is that succes
sive Christian Democratic gov
ernments have been primarily
responsible for the past de
cades' cancerous growth of
state organs. This process is so
advanced that, even now, state
agencies dominate most major
economic activities and the PCI
could hardly go farther in this
direction if it so decided.
But powerful political ten
dencies militate against such a
decision, and simultaneously
relegate "sincerity" to minor
relevance.
There was a time when the
Christian Democrats retained
power on the basis of a guiding
vision, patronage and the pub
lic's fear of communism.
However, gradually both the
vision and the fear waned as
decisive political influences.
When Italians voted over
whelmingly in favor of permit
ting divorce in 1975, they un
expectedly revealed that, of
the familiar triad, only patron
age retained its potency.
It is not difficult to see how
such circumstances gradually
caused Communists to identify
their political interests with a
reduction of the oppressive
dimensions of government
power. There is nothing like
being in a political minority to
teach virtues of tolerance and

democracy.
Much of the secret of PCI
electoral success lies in the fact
that decades of domestic
"mutual coexistence" showed
ever-growing numbers of Ita
lians that their native Com
munists were becoming — by
force of circumstances that
forced them into the defensive
— tenacious defenders of civil
liberties.
These paradoxical tenden
cies toward liberalism in the
history of the PCI might still be
dismissed as mere expediency,
but for one thing. To a great
extent, they prefigured in the
political theory bequeathed
the party by its founder, An
tonio Gramsci.
Gramsci rejected the BoU
shevik model of revolution, in
which the transformation of
society is supposed to follow
from the sudden seizure of
state power. Instead he fa
vored working "within the sys
tem."
In Gramsci's view, true
socialism would arrive in Italy
following its propagation
throughout society via non
state institutions. Only in the
end, after the passage of gen
erations, would it envelop the
state.
However, in order to reach
this final stage, society would
already be, to all intents and
purposes, socialist. Hence the
acquisition of state power at
this point could not have re
pressive consequences.
Subsequent PCI theorists
have naturally inferred that, for
their long-term strategy to bear
fruit, society must be pro
tected against encroachment of

the state. Of course, by "soci
ety" they mean no* just busi
ness firms, the preis and re
ligious institutions, but also
unions, cooperatives, volun
tary associations andcommun
ity governments.
Like all other social
phenomena, the PCI is com
p'ex and ambiguous. Anti
liberal tendencies are em
bodied not just by a minority
with classical Leninist tenden
cies but also by certain organi
zational norms.
Conceivably, some chain of
svents could arrest their de
fine, or even reverse it. To
arevent this is one of the main
tasks of defenders of freedom
in Italy.
Here in the United States, it
is important to recognize the
positive forces at work even in
so seemingly unlikely a place
as a communist party. The
world has come a long way
since Stalin, and greater com
plexity brings with it new op
oortunities. These are closed,
lowever, to those whose view
s obstructed by ideological
enses.
To fail to recognize the
democratic potential with the
'CI is not only to engage in
ielf-fulfilling prophecy, it is
ilso to belittle the power of
Iberal ideals to force their rec
ognition even on those origi
rally blind to them. Past U.S.
experience with other com
mjnisms suggests caution in
as?essing this one. However,
thie conservatism should have
no fart of illiberal prejudice.

either dupes or partners in
duplicity.
Worse still, by confirming
American Cold War pre
judices, it obscures the real is
sues at stake in Italy today.
The plain fact is that succes
sive Christian Democratic gov
ernments have been primarily
responsible for the past de
cades' cancerous growth of
state organs. This process is so
advanced that, even now, state
agencies dominate most major
economic activities and the PCI
could hardly go farther in this
direction if it so decided.
But powerful political ten
dencies militate against such a
decision, and simultaneously
relegate "sincerity" to minor
relevance.
There was a time when the
Christian Democrats retained
power on the basis of a guiding
vision, patronage and the pub
lic's fear of communism.
However, gradually both the
vision and the fear waned as
decisive political influences.
When Italians voted over
whelmingly in favor of permit
ting divorce in 1975, they un
expectedly revealed that, of
the familiar triad, only patron
age retained its potency.
It is not difficult to see how
such circumstances gradually
caused Communists to identify
their political interests with a
reduction of the oppressive
dimensions of government
power. There is nothing like
being in a political minority to
teach virtues of tolerance and

democracy.
Much of the secret of PCI
electoral success lies in the fact
that decades of domestic
"mutual coexistence" showed
ever-growing numbers of Ita
lians that their native Com
munists were becoming — by
force of circumstances that
forced them into the defensive
— tenacious defenders of civil
liberties.
These paradoxical tenden
cies toward liberalism in the
history of the PCI might still be
dismissed as mere expediency,
but for one thing. To a great
extent, they prefigured in the
political theory bequeathed
the party by its founder, An
tonio Gramsci.
Gramsci rejected the BoU
shevik model of revolution, in
which the transformation of
society is supposed to follow
from the sudden seizure of
state power. Instead he fa
vored working "within the sys
tem."
In Gramsci's view, true
socialism would arrive in Italy
following its propagation
throughout society via non
state institutions. Only in the
end, after the passage of gen
erations, would it envelop the
state.
However, in order to reach
this final stage, society would
already be, to all intents and
purposes, socialist. Hence the
acquisition of state power at
this point could not have re
pressive consequences.
Subsequent PCI theorists
have naturally inferred that, for
their long-term strategy to bear
fruit, society must be pro
tected against encroachment of

the state. Of course, by "soci
ety" they mean no* just busi
ness firms, the preis and re
ligious institutions, but also
unions, cooperatives, volun
tary associations andcommun
ity governments.
Like all other social
phenomena, the PCI is com
p'ex and ambiguous. Anti
liberal tendencies are em
bodied not just by a minority
with classical Leninist tenden
cies but also by certain organi
zational norms.
Conceivably, some chain of
svents could arrest their de
fine, or even reverse it. To
arevent this is one of the main
tasks of defenders of freedom
in Italy.
Here in the United States, it
is important to recognize the
positive forces at work even in
so seemingly unlikely a place
as a communist party. The
world has come a long way
since Stalin, and greater com
plexity brings with it new op
oortunities. These are closed,
lowever, to those whose view
s obstructed by ideological
enses.
To fail to recognize the
democratic potential with the
'CI is not only to engage in
ielf-fulfilling prophecy, it is
ilso to belittle the power of
Iberal ideals to force their rec
ognition even on those origi
rally blind to them. Past U.S.
experience with other com
mjnisms suggests caution in
as?essing this one. However,
thie conservatism should have
no fart of illiberal prejudice.

Only one thing is certain fol
lowing the fall of the thirty
fourth postwar Italian govern
ment: for the thirty-third time,
American newspapers will cull
their files to offer their readers
the same account.
That account will express
fear of the possible growth of
communist participation in
government, and concern that
state control of the economy
will accelerate.
There is good reason to de
sire a change in the focus of
press coverage. To be sure,
unquestioning acceptance of
Italian Communist Party (PCI)
vows to slash the size of the
bureaucracy is no answer.
But the American press is de
relict to mention these pledges
only to question the "sincer
ity" of the PCl's general polti
cal commitments, especially to

democracy. This only accuses
the 34 percent of Italians who
voted for the PCi in the last
general election of being
either dupes or partners in
duplicity.
