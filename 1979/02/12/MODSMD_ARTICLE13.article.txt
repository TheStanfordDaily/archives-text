## Student government gains 
### 
(Fourth of a series.)
Student government here
will gain from attending the Lit
tle Eleven conference.
By meeting with schools
similar to Stanford, the student
government committee for the
conference hopes to see solu
tions that they have to prob
lems similar to those here. We
think other schools may be in
terested in student reaction to
the senate's new districting
procedure here. Stanford's
program of putting interns on
University committees as a
means of increasing student
input on University decisions
likewise may be of interest.
The student government
committee has already bene
fited from the Little Eleven
Conference. We have just
finished our written presenta
tion to the other schools. To
prepare for this, we analyzed
concisely the roles and duties
of the Council of Presidents,
the ASSU Senate and its as
sociated services, and the
committee system.
We have also had a chance to
think over such issues as the
move to pass the Committee to
Retire Aspiring Politicos
(CRAP) amendment and the
problem of voter apathy. Pre
paring for this report required
us to explain how decisions are
made at Stanford and how stu
dents currently affect those
decisions. Explaining this to
students at other schools
forced us to understand it well
ourselves.
But the Little Eleven Confer
ence will be no benefit to Stan
ford if we cannot bring what we
learn back onto campus in a
practical manner. To facilitate
this the student government

committee will writea report of
its proceedings and recom
mendations. It, along with
other committee reports and
an overall conference state
ment, will be available to any
one interested.
Other plans include holding
meetings to answer questions
about the conference, and talk
ing with senators and commit
tee members.

If you hive any questions or
suggestions, feel free to con
tact us. Wetre looking forward
to an interring and produc
tive weekeni.
