# Holman shoots down Med School
## 
### Martin Lasden 
Stanford Medical School.
A recent national survey
confirms that it is one of the
finest medical schools in the
country. World-renowned
doctors, ultra-modern
equipment and productive
research. Stanford appa
rently has it all. Or does it?
As the chairman of the
Department of Medicine
here from 1960 to 1971, Dr.
Halsted Holman saw it all.
He wasn't impressed.
"Stanford," he said,
"spends an awful lot of time
telling itself how excellent it
is. . . . But as an overall
medical entity, Stanford is
not only not excellent — in
some respects it has trouble
qualifying as mediocre. . . .
Backward
"The notion that we have
an excellent school is non
sense. The teaching prog
rams, the research prog
rams, the character of the
faculty, the ability to inno
vate, the ability to recognize
the relationship between
medicine and the commun
ity in which health must be
maintained — in all those
realms Stanford Medical
School has been backward
and remains backward."
Today Holman is a Med
School professor specializ
ing in internal medicine.
But despite his continu
ing connection with the
University, Holman remains

blunt — a bluntness that is
ail the more surprising
given his appearance. At 54,
he appears to be a relaxed,
gentle man who better fits
the stereotype o( a distin
guished physician rather
than subversive intellectual.
In manner and style he has
the makings of a TV doctor
— a doctor who, you would
expect, still makes house
calls.
"When I use the word ex
cellent," he said in his de
scription of the school, "I
mean doing what we're
capable of doing given the
present problems. Now
that doesn't mean that we
aren't excellent in certain
aspects of biological sci
ences, that we don't have
superior kinds of medical,
pediatric, psychiatric .md
surgical treatments. But
those programs and the
people who head them do
not make a medical school.
A medical school and a med
ical center has to address a
series of problems. . . .
Medical crisis
"One has to be very
dense to be involved in
medicine, and not realize
that there's a medical crisis
going on," he added.
As a practicing physician
and professor, Holman lives
in two distinct worlds. And
these worlds, he suggests,
will end up in chaos unless
decisive action is taken.

For example, at the Med
Center, dire predictions of
huge deficits obliged
the school's administration
to recommend a 27 percent
tuition rate hike for next
year's entering students
(from the current $5388 to
$6873 for the academic year)
and 15 percent for those
curren ly enrolled (up to
$6174) Though the hike
proposal was rejected, med
ical students are angry. So
are a group of community
physicians who say they are
being denied access to the
University's sophisticated
medical equipment.
Meanwhile, fewer pa
tients are coming here,
causing even more prob
lems. Figures released by

the Hospital show that only
167,000 patient days were
counted for in 1977-78,
when 180,000 were antici
pated.
Holman cites sloppy ac
counting practices and bad
leadership as part of the fi
nancial problems. But, ac
cording to Holman, what's
really ailing the Med Center
is a severe case of elitism.
"This fiscal crisis," he
said, "may offer some op
portunity to bring about
change which would simul
taneously make the institu
tion more effective in meet
ing social needs and make it
fiscally sound. But that
means going out and work
ing with the community.
And that's going to create

apprehension among the
elitist?.
"Elitism is a bad disease,"
he added, a disease tha! not
only afflicts Stanford but the
entire medical profession as
well. As professionals, all
physicians are dangerously
vulnerable, he suggested.
It was in search of a better
way that Holman in the early
1970s began organizing a
health service in Palb Alto
with o distinctly non-elitist
bent. Mid-Peninsula Health
Service (MHS) is now three
years old. The program's
board of directors, of which
Holman is president, con
sists mostly of consumers
rather than doctors, and
that board helps determine
health service policy.
Consumer democracy
While cautiously expres
sing satisfaction with the
progress of. MHS, Holman
conceded that consumer
democracy is not always
easy.
"Professionals are used to
being dominating and
dgmin<\tpd lay persons are
u§ed to being submissive,"
he said, "tven at MHS we
still have residual elements
of those behaviors on the
part of both sides."
Nevertheless, Holman in
sists that it iS'the patient
rather than the doctor who
has a "more accurate and"
profound understanding of
his or her own health prob

lems." So at MHS the pa
tient is given more control.
Health education and
methods of self-help are
stressed; expensive tests
and prescriptions are kept
at a minimum.
For Holman, good medi
cal care means just being
there when the patients feel
they need help. The so
called "executive's annual
physical" that can cost over
$300, he calls "useless." It is
very thorough, he agreed,
"but it is thoroughness
without purpose."
The paradox in this doc
tor's life is that while he is
essentially a hard-core
populist, he has always
maintained connections
with the elite. Born and
raised in San Francisco,
both his mother and father
were physicians. He was an
undergraduate here and in
the 1940s he attended Vale
Medical School. He went on
to attain stature as a
biomedical researcher at
the Rockefeller Institute
and then came back here in
1%0 to become the chair
man of the medical depart
ment.
Holman does admit to
having been vulnerable in
the past to the "bad influ
ences" of his environment.
"I've been just as guilty as
anyone else of employing
needless medical practices,
and of teaching students

that a number of inefficient
practices were desirable.
( "But about 10 years ago,"
added, "some of us
started, analyzing our own
practices here and were
able tp convince ourselves
that we were overtreating
and overtesting patients."
,'Never static'
"What's uniqueabout Dr.
Holman," said Stanley
Shore, ,a medical student
who has worked with him
for the last six years, "is that
his thinking is never static.
He is constantly resynth
esizing his thoughts about
various issues. He never
stops. He's the kind of guy
who you want to touch base
with at least two to three
minutes every day because
if you don'{, you'll miss
something."
And Holman is not the
kind of man who enjoys
small talk. While being in
terviewed, hef tended to
brush off personal ques
tions with the l most per
functory of answers and at
times, he even appeared
annoyed. When asked
about his future, he said
quickly, "I really enjoy what
I'm doing and I don't expect
to be doing much else." But
then in response to another
question, a trace Of a smile
was evident. "I giiess you
can never predict what I'll
be doing 10 years from
now," he said.
