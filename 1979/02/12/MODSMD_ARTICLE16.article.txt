# Doctoral student principal, counselor
## 
### Barbara Schoetzau 
It is not very difficult to find
David Katz at the Willow Oak
School in Menlo Park. Ask any
student and you'll be led di- '
rectly to him.
I found him at the end of
lunch period in the schoolyard
surrounded by a dozen eighth
graders demanding his im
mediate attention. They jostle
him, grab at his hands, |ab at ;
his arms, slap his shoulders
with affection. A student ex
presses amazement at the fact
that he knows them all by '
name, and Katz just shrugs it
off as an odd ability.
Katz, 28, is a doctoral student
in the administration and pol
icy analysis program at the
School of Education. His ad-»
ministrative internship at Wil
low Oaks began in September
and one of his first projects was.
to instigate a new series of
elective courses at the school.
The new classes are met with
both compliments and com-,
plaints, and on the second day
of the quarter, Katz is beseiged
by youngsters demanding a
change in classes.
When he tells them they,
cannot transfer until they have
attended their currently"
scheduled class at least four
times, reactions are unanimous.
Calming
"I hate this school. I hate this
school. I hate this school," one
girl says, stomping off in de
feat. Another complains about
a mean teacher, but Katz only;
laughs, for he knows that while
that particular teacher is a strict
disciplinarian, she is also one
of the most sympathetic in
structors in the school.
Walking back to his office
after lunch period, Katz is
trailed by several students who
have been scheduled for the;
new computer programming.,
elective when they would'] 1
rather be in tennis. Katz asks
them to give the programming
elective a chance.
"I did. I was already over
there," a boy pouts.

"But this is different. You're
going to do some program
ming. Give it a try; you'll like
it."
Diplomatic
Five years of teaching in
Chicago's Inner City has taught
Katz how to deal with children.
He addresses them individu
ally, never raising his voice,
handling their clever manipu
lations with wry amusement.
As an undergraduate major
ing in psychology at the Uni
versity of Chicago, Katz had
never considered teaching
until he became involved with
that university's prestigious
Lab School during his senior
year.
"It was just everything that
education ought to be," he
says of the Lab School. "I was
very excited about it. I
substitute-taught until I got my
credentials. Then I got a full
time position in the Inner
City."
Teaching in that tough dis
trict where students never
hesitate to challenge teachers
caught Katz off guard. He ad
mits that he did not feel com
fortable until his second or
third year, and by that time it
was the system, not the stu
dents, that disturbed him. He
says that all the progress he
had made with students was
undone two years after they
left the classroom.
Hopeful
Katz concluded that the way
to make a lasting impact with
students was through ad
ministration. He therefore
came to Stanford in the hopes of
learning skills which would land
him an influential position in the
educational system.
Katz says he had mixed emo
tions of taking the internship at
Willow Oaks. Aware of the
negative experiences many
student-interns have, he was af
raid his job would entail no
thing more than correcting
tests.
But instead, the school pro

vides the ideal working condi- •
tions for him. Economically
troubled because of Proposi
tion 13, Willow Oaks was,
forced to cut back both ad
ministrators and counselors so
Katz was thrown into this dual
role.

independence in most mat
ters, Katz judges.his positionto ■

school district and perhaps
heading a state board of educa

school in Menlo Park. An administrative intern, Katz has taught five years in Chicago's Inner City. He
majored in psychology as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.
It is not very difficult to find
David Katz at the Willow Oak
School in Menlo Park. Ask any
student and you'll be led di- '
rectly to him.
I found him at the end of
lunch period in the schoolyard
surrounded by a dozen eighth
graders demanding his im
mediate attention. They jostle
him, grab at his hands, |ab at ;
his arms, slap his shoulders
with affection. A student ex
presses amazement at the fact
that he knows them all by '
name, and Katz just shrugs it
off as an odd ability.
Katz, 28, is a doctoral student
in the administration and pol
icy analysis program at the
School of Education. His ad-»
ministrative internship at Wil
low Oaks began in September
and one of his first projects was.
to instigate a new series of
elective courses at the school.
The new classes are met with
both compliments and com-,
plaints, and on the second day
of the quarter, Katz is beseiged
by youngsters demanding a
change in classes.
When he tells them they,
cannot transfer until they have
attended their currently"
scheduled class at least four
times, reactions are unanimous.
Calming
"I hate this school. I hate this
school. I hate this school," one
girl says, stomping off in de
feat. Another complains about
a mean teacher, but Katz only;
laughs, for he knows that while
that particular teacher is a strict
disciplinarian, she is also one
of the most sympathetic in
structors in the school.
Walking back to his office
after lunch period, Katz is
trailed by several students who
have been scheduled for the;
new computer programming.,
elective when they would'] 1
rather be in tennis. Katz asks
them to give the programming
elective a chance.
"I did. I was already over
there," a boy pouts.

"But this is different. You're
going to do some program
ming. Give it a try; you'll like
it."
Diplomatic
Five years of teaching in
Chicago's Inner City has taught
Katz how to deal with children.
He addresses them individu
ally, never raising his voice,
handling their clever manipu
lations with wry amusement.
As an undergraduate major
ing in psychology at the Uni
versity of Chicago, Katz had
never considered teaching
until he became involved with
that university's prestigious
Lab School during his senior
year.
"It was just everything that
education ought to be," he
says of the Lab School. "I was
very excited about it. I
substitute-taught until I got my
credentials. Then I got a full
time position in the Inner
City."
Teaching in that tough dis
trict where students never
hesitate to challenge teachers
caught Katz off guard. He ad
mits that he did not feel com
fortable until his second or
third year, and by that time it
was the system, not the stu
dents, that disturbed him. He
says that all the progress he
had made with students was
undone two years after they
left the classroom.
Hopeful
Katz concluded that the way
to make a lasting impact with
students was through ad
ministration. He therefore
came to Stanford in the hopes of
learning skills which would land
him an influential position in the
educational system.
Katz says he had mixed emo
tions of taking the internship at
Willow Oaks. Aware of the
negative experiences many
student-interns have, he was af
raid his job would entail no
thing more than correcting
tests.
But instead, the school pro

vides the ideal working condi- •
tions for him. Economically
troubled because of Proposi
tion 13, Willow Oaks was,
forced to cut back both ad
ministrators and counselors so
Katz was thrown into this dual
