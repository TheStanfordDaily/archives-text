A well-known architectural
gadfly once wrote, "Domes
made by man have probably
been used by man for hun
dreds of millennia." Yet it has
only been in the last half cen
tury that domes, especially
geodesic domes, have found
their way into the realm of day
to day conversation. Why are
they suddenly so popular and
what is the mystery of the
geodesic dome?
The geodesic, or tensegric,
dome is a semi-spherical struc
ture made from light, straight
elements such as strips of
aluminum or planks of wood.

The elements are attached in
tension so no beams or col
umns are needed to support
the building.
In contrast to its appearance,
the geodesic structure is re
markably strong. A dome with
a diameter of 225 ft. (about the
same size as a 40,000 sq. ft.
house) can resist winds in ex
cess of 120 miles per hour.
Self-supporting
But while size and strength
are important, the popularity
of domes can be attributed to
two other factors: low cost and
ease of construction. Since the
geodesic structure is self
supporting, conventional brac
ing, which is expensive and
hard to construct, is not
needed.
Buckminster Fuller, known
to students here for his con
cepts of Synergy, is responsi
ble for the "Dome Renais
sance." Today he lives in a
"comfortable" geodesic dome
and claims it cost less than
$2000 to build in 1949.
One might expect that the
two factors of low cost and easy
construction, combined with
the dome's unique appear
ance, would make a geodesic
structure a favorite with per
sons needing off-campus

housing. Bill Leland at Stan
ford's Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) is such a person.
Since' December 1973, he and
four to five others have lived in
a complex of three geodesic
domes on Skyline Blvd.
'Crackerbox' comforts
"We completed the first two
in 1973 and the third in 1974,"
Leland said. All the comforts of
the typical "crackerbox" home
are present in the domes, in
cluding a kitchen, two full
baths, sleeping lofts and a
sauna.
Leland calls his geodesic
dome an "aesthetically and
psychologically pleasing place
to live." When asked about
problems he has had living in a
tensegric structure, Leland re
plied that problems have been
minimal.
"The mythology surround
ing domes is that they are leaky
and cold. But by using standard
double-wall insulation princi
ples and a skilled rooter, those
problems can be avoided/' he
said.
Survival dome
It's too bad no one told
sophomore transfer student
Ned Mertz about double-wall
insulation. "I almost froze my
you-now-what off," quipped
Mertz, who built a dome as

part of a trial survival course
sponsored by West Texas State
University.
"I guess it was kind of like
Outward Bound," he said.
"The directors gave us the
parts tor a geodesic dome,
some fishing hooks and line,
matches, a lot of freeze-dried
stutf and as many clothes as we
could throw into a pack. Then
they split us up, put me on a
mountain in Colorado and
said, 'Well, we'll be back to
pick you up in a month.' I must
have done something wrong
though, because I was cold at
night, wet when it rained and
in constant fear of being blown
away. I must admit, though, it
did stand up to some pretty
heavy winds."
While Mertz could not
comment on the aesthetics of
his dome, Leland said he liked
the sense of intinite space that
his dome affords him. The un
limited space was caused by a
combination of three things,
said Leland.
Gentle lines
The gentle lines of the dome
combine with the lighting from
our windows and the natural
setting to give us a shelter
without separation from the
environment," he said.
Mertz agreed that his shelter
didn't separate him from the
environment, although at
times he wished it had. But
Mertz and Leland are at two dif
ferent ends of the geodesic
spectrum. While Leland said
construction of his domes cost
him about $8000 each in mate
rials, Mertz's structure cost
less than $500. And while Mertz
threw his dome up in "about a
day,'' Leland said he spent a lot
of time with a structural en
gineer making sure the domes
complied with residential
housing codes. It seems that
geodesic domes, like just
about anything in life, are a re
sult ot the effort one puts into
them.
The American Geodesic
Dome Society in Carbondale,
Illinois answers questions per
taining to dome construction
and has a large collection of
plans available for the aspiring
tensegric carpenter.
But as Fuller once wrote,
"The most important fact
about Spaceship Earth is that it
didn't come with an instruction
manual."

Geodesic domes have been increasing in popularity since the middle
of the century. A semi-spherical structure, the domes are made from
light, straight elements such as aluminum and wood.
