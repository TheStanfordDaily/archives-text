## USC dampens Cards 
### Dianne Cahoon 
"Rats," a prominent Card swimmer was heard
to mutter Friday afternoon. Somehow, at that
moment, a term commonly associated with
verminous creatures seemed to appropriately
convey Stanford sentiment toward a 67Vi to 65'/,!
loss to USC.
Minutes earlier, the deCuerre pool deck had
shaken with reverberating cheers, boisterous
bravado and wildly-flung towels. The outcome
of two hours of splashingly brilliant competi
tion rested upon the powerful shoulders ot the
eight competitors in the meet's final event, the
400 yard freestyle relay.
Not to be intimidated nor in any way impeded
by such a display of Stanford esprit de corps, the
Trojan foursome slithered past Cardinals John
kingery, Bob Hagberg, Mike Anderson and Sam
Franklin by a three-second margin to steal the
seven points necessary to propel their team to
victory.
Although they failed to cast off their eight
year legacy of defeats at the webbed hands and
feet of USC, the Cards surfaced as a well
rounded and forceful team in their finest hour of
the season.
Coach )im Caughran had correctly foreseen a
"very competitive" match-up, but even he un
derrated his swimmers' determined ability to
pursue and overrun an aggressor. Caughran
frankly admitted that when the visitors sprang to
one-two finishes in the first two events (the 100
backstroke and the 100 breaststroke), "I thought
the meet was all over."
Franklin, however, immediately turned the
tide with a crushing triumph (50.5) in the 100
yard butterfly over the Trojans' bespectacled
Bruce Furniss. Furniss, gold medalist in the 200
meter freestyle at the 1976 Montreal Olympics
and current NCAA 200 yard individual medley
champion, spurned his usual events and was
subsequently held winless throughout the af
ternoon.
Paul Hartloff, hampered by a strained liga
ment, gamely stroked to second in the HXX) tree
behind the record-breaking performance ot
Brain Roney of Southern Cal. Roney's 9:14.0
shattered John Naber's school record, set a new
meet standard and gave him the third-fastest

collegiate time in the nation for this year.
Co-captain Mike Bruner then began his merci
less barrage on his Trojan opponents with a
meet-record victory in the 200 free (1:39.5).
After Franklin pummelled to his second win of
the day in the 50 free (21.4), USC maintained a
slight il-23 edge on the dogged Cards.
Gaughran substituted the demanding 400 in
dividual medley for the traditional 200 yard dis
tance to provide his swimmers with their first
shot of the year at the NCAA qualifying time in
that punishing event. Freshman sensation )eff
Stiling and veteran Tom O'Brien responded by
touching first and second respectively, but their
clockings of 4:0b.8 and 4:08.2 missed the mark.
Following the 3-meter diving, which USC's
Kevin Wilson handily swept from the lithe figure
of Stanford freshman Brian McCleve, Bruner
battered a rapidly succumbing USC contingent
once again.
Furniss greedily grabbed the bait to assume
the role of pack leader in the 200 fly, but his last
50 yards were as sluggish as his team's weak
attempts at cheerleading. Fie capitulated to
Bruner's evenly paced 1:49.6, and Stanford
moved up to tie the Trojans at 45 points apiece.
Kingery captured the 100 free honors for the
second week in a row by hitting the wall in 47.1
seconds. To the accompaniment of ear-piercing
catcalls, glass-shattering whistles, and
psychedelically-swirling pieces of material,
Wade Flemons hammered USC's heralded Jeff
Float and Steve Pickell with his best time ever in
the 200 back, 1:53.0.
Bruner climaxed what Caughran described as
"a fantastic meet tor him" with a 4:26.8 win in
the 500 free, his third fatiguing race of the after
noon. Hartloff hung on to beat the Trojans' Kurt
McGowan for third place in an event which
surely must have sent USC coach Peter Daland
reeling with mild heart failure. Only two events
remained, and Stanford was in control of a six
point advantage.
Ken Shilling swam his fastest unshaved 200
breaststroke of the season (2:07.4) but still
yielded to USC sculler Danny Rosenthal
(2:06.1). Thus, the meet hinged upon that last
heartbreaking event, which the Trojans man
aged to conquer.

Co-captain Mike Bruner then began his merci
less barrage on his Trojan opponents with a
meet-record victory in the 200 free (1:39.5).
After Franklin pummelled to his second win of
the day in the 50 free (21.4), USC maintained a
slight il-23 edge on the dogged Cards.
Gaughran substituted the demanding 400 in
dividual medley for the traditional 200 yard dis
tance to provide his swimmers with their first
shot of the year at the NCAA qualifying time in
that punishing event. Freshman sensation )eff
Stiling and veteran Tom O'Brien responded by
touching first and second respectively, but their
clockings of 4:0b.8 and 4:08.2 missed the mark.
Following the 3-meter diving, which USC's
Kevin Wilson handily swept from the lithe figure
of Stanford freshman Brian McCleve, Bruner
battered a rapidly succumbing USC contingent
once again.
Furniss greedily grabbed the bait to assume
the role of pack leader in the 200 fly, but his last
50 yards were as sluggish as his team's weak
attempts at cheerleading. Fie capitulated to
Bruner's evenly paced 1:49.6, and Stanford
moved up to tie the Trojans at 45 points apiece.
Kingery captured the 100 free honors for the
second week in a row by hitting the wall in 47.1
seconds. To the accompaniment of ear-piercing
catcalls, glass-shattering whistles, and
psychedelically-swirling pieces of material,
Wade Flemons hammered USC's heralded Jeff
Float and Steve Pickell with his best time ever in
the 200 back, 1:53.0.
Bruner climaxed what Caughran described as
"a fantastic meet tor him" with a 4:26.8 win in
the 500 free, his third fatiguing race of the after
noon. Hartloff hung on to beat the Trojans' Kurt
McGowan for third place in an event which
surely must have sent USC coach Peter Daland
reeling with mild heart failure. Only two events
remained, and Stanford was in control of a six
point advantage.
Ken Shilling swam his fastest unshaved 200
breaststroke of the season (2:07.4) but still
yielded to USC sculler Danny Rosenthal
(2:06.1). Thus, the meet hinged upon that last
heartbreaking event, which the Trojans man
aged to conquer.

CARDINAL RELIEVER Mike Sullivan burns one past .1 Chico State batter during the first game of
Stanford's 6-4, 3-1 doubleheader sweep of the Wildcats Saturday. Sullivan's performances out of the
bullpen have been vital so far in Stanford's 7-0 season.
"Rats," a prominent Card swimmer was heard
to mutter Friday afternoon. Somehow, at that
moment, a term commonly associated with
verminous creatures seemed to appropriately
convey Stanford sentiment toward a 67Vi to 65'/,!
loss to USC.
Minutes earlier, the deCuerre pool deck had
shaken with reverberating cheers, boisterous
bravado and wildly-flung towels. The outcome
of two hours of splashingly brilliant competi
tion rested upon the powerful shoulders ot the
eight competitors in the meet's final event, the
400 yard freestyle relay.
Not to be intimidated nor in any way impeded
by such a display of Stanford esprit de corps, the
Trojan foursome slithered past Cardinals John
kingery, Bob Hagberg, Mike Anderson and Sam
Franklin by a three-second margin to steal the
seven points necessary to propel their team to
victory.
Although they failed to cast off their eight
year legacy of defeats at the webbed hands and
feet of USC, the Cards surfaced as a well
rounded and forceful team in their finest hour of
the season.
Coach )im Caughran had correctly foreseen a
"very competitive" match-up, but even he un
derrated his swimmers' determined ability to
pursue and overrun an aggressor. Caughran
frankly admitted that when the visitors sprang to
one-two finishes in the first two events (the 100
backstroke and the 100 breaststroke), "I thought
the meet was all over."
Franklin, however, immediately turned the
tide with a crushing triumph (50.5) in the 100
yard butterfly over the Trojans' bespectacled
Bruce Furniss. Furniss, gold medalist in the 200
meter freestyle at the 1976 Montreal Olympics
and current NCAA 200 yard individual medley
champion, spurned his usual events and was
subsequently held winless throughout the af
ternoon.
Paul Hartloff, hampered by a strained liga
ment, gamely stroked to second in the HXX) tree
behind the record-breaking performance ot
Brain Roney of Southern Cal. Roney's 9:14.0
shattered John Naber's school record, set a new
meet standard and gave him the third-fastest

collegiate time in the nation for this year.
