# McCloskey outlines service bill
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
"The all-volunteer army is not
working and is not combat-ready.
That is the basic reason I am submit
ting this legislation."
In a talk at the Palo Alto Senior
Center yesterday afternoon, Rep.
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) out
lined his reasons for submitting his
National Youth Service Bill
Asked why he feels it is necessary
to maintain an effective fighting
force in Europe rather than simply a
defensive force, McCloskey replied,
"I don't trust the Russian generals
any more than our own. I am not
willing to test our nation's reluctance
to use nuclear force by reducing our
conventional forces anywhere. I feel
a strong conventional force is the
most effective deterrent to attack
from anywhere."
Stated reluctance
McCloskey explained that if the
United States allowed its conven
tional forces to deteriorate, the
Soviets might be tempted to effect a
rapid invasion of a country such as
Norway or West Germany, especially
since our government has stated its
reluctance to use nuclear force.
He said, "If you were President of
the United States right now, today,
what would you do if you were faced
with an invasion of one of our NATO
allies by conventional Soviet forces?
If our conventional forces there were
overrun, the only remaining alterna
tive would be nuclear weapons," he
said.
Four options
McCloskey has proposed the fol
lowing: At age 17, all men and wo
men, approximately 4.3 million per
year, would be required to register.
Once registered, an individual
would have four service options.
The first option would be to volun
teer for two years' military service,
with a guarantee of four years' col
lege benefits.
The second would be to volunteer
for six months of military service,
with 5Vi years reserve obligation.
The third option would be to serve
one year's civilian service in a Peace
Corps, VISTA, community or en
vironmental capacity.
The fourth option would be to be
placed in a lottery pool, subject to
being drafted for two years between
the ages of 18 and 24, with a year's
college benefits for each year served.
Another provision of the program

is that the military pay scale for the
two years' service would be reduced
to subsistence levels.
No problem
McCloskey sees no problem in
getting America's young people to
give their country one year of their
lives in any capacity they choose.
Another advantage to his program,
McCloskey pointed out, is that it is
not as restrictive as other proposals
such as the one presented by Sen.
John Stennis (D-Miss.), which would
mean the reinstatement of the draft.
In terms of preventing war,
McCloskey said his program would
introduce young men and women to
what he calls "the military mind." He
said, "I would much rather have an
army of reluctant conscripts than an
army of professional soldiers. Those
conscripts would bring with them a
reluctance to fight, which I think
would do much to help prevent our
involvement in future conflicts."
'The military mind'
According to McCloskey, an un
derstanding of "the military mind"
would prevent future generations of
leaders who did not witness the hor
rors of World War 11, Korea or Viet
nam from ever considering war as
anything but a last resort. "A new
leadership with no experience with

the horror of war might be more
tempted to resort to it," McCloskey
said.
There was little evidence of any
protest outside the building, jack
Klinger, one of two picketers waiting
to meet McCloskey, said "It (the
proposal) is unconstitutional. It viol
ates the 13th amendment against in
voluntary servitude."
Court preparations underway
"If it does pass," Klinger said, "it
will probably go to court." According
to Klinger, preparations are under
way at the United Church of Christ in
Washington, D.C. to initiate court
proceedings should the legislation
be approved.
Asked why there were not more
people picketing, Klinger said that
there had not been enough time to
organize any demonstration. "The
next time he (McCloskey) comes
here, we'll have mass picketing and
mass demonstrations."
Asked what would happen if
young people did not choose the ac
tive duty options in his proposals,
McCloskey replied "We'll face that
problem when it comes."
One element of the proposal that
McCloskey clarified was that no one
who volunteers for the community


Pete McCloskey
service option of his program would
ever he subjected to actual conscrip
tion into the armed forces.
As evidence of the lack of readi
ness of U.S. forces, McCloskey cited
the failure of the Air Force, the most
popular branch of the service, to
meet their minimum recruitment
quota last year. He also pointed to
high drug use as evidence of the un
fitness of U.S. troops.
Spending limits
The meeting did not cover just
McCloskey's service proposal. Most
of the crowd of about 400 were
senior citizens who had come to ask
questions about social security and
balancing the budget.
McCloskey favors a constitutional
amendment initiated by Congress to
set limits on government spending.

Asked why he feels it is necessary
to maintain an effective fighting
force in Europe rather than simply a
defensive force, McCloskey replied,
"I don't trust the Russian generals
any more than our own. I am not
willing to test our nation's reluctance
to use nuclear force by reducing our
conventional forces anywhere. I feel
a strong conventional force is the
most effective deterrent to attack
from anywhere."
Stated reluctance
McCloskey explained that if the
United States allowed its conven
tional forces to deteriorate, the
Soviets might be tempted to effect a
rapid invasion of a country such as
Norway or West Germany, especially
since our government has stated its
reluctance to use nuclear force.
He said, "If you were President of
the United States right now, today,
what would you do if you were faced
with an invasion of one of our NATO
allies by conventional Soviet forces?
If our conventional forces there were
overrun, the only remaining alterna
tive would be nuclear weapons," he
said.
Four options
McCloskey has proposed the fol
lowing: At age 17, all men and wo
men, approximately 4.3 million per
year, would be required to register.
Once registered, an individual
would have four service options.
The first option would be to volun
teer for two years' military service,
with a guarantee of four years' col
lege benefits.
The second would be to volunteer
for six months of military service,
with 5Vi years reserve obligation.
The third option would be to serve
one year's civilian service in a Peace
Corps, VISTA, community or en
vironmental capacity.
The fourth option would be to be
placed in a lottery pool, subject to
being drafted for two years between
the ages of 18 and 24, with a year's
college benefits for each year served.
Another provision of the program

is that the military pay scale for the
two years' service would be reduced
to subsistence levels.
No problem
McCloskey sees no problem in
getting America's young people to
give their country one year of their
lives in any capacity they choose.
Another advantage to his program,
McCloskey pointed out, is that it is
not as restrictive as other proposals
such as the one presented by Sen.
John Stennis (D-Miss.), which would
mean the reinstatement of the draft.
In terms of preventing war,
McCloskey said his program would
introduce young men and women to
what he calls "the military mind." He
said, "I would much rather have an
army of reluctant conscripts than an
army of professional soldiers. Those
conscripts would bring with them a
reluctance to fight, which I think
would do much to help prevent our
involvement in future conflicts."
'The military mind'
According to McCloskey, an un
derstanding of "the military mind"
would prevent future generations of
leaders who did not witness the hor
rors of World War 11, Korea or Viet
nam from ever considering war as
anything but a last resort. "A new
leadership with no experience with

the horror of war might be more
tempted to resort to it," McCloskey
said.
There was little evidence of any
protest outside the building, jack
Klinger, one of two picketers waiting
to meet McCloskey, said "It (the
proposal) is unconstitutional. It viol
ates the 13th amendment against in
voluntary servitude."
Court preparations underway
"If it does pass," Klinger said, "it
will probably go to court." According
to Klinger, preparations are under
way at the United Church of Christ in
Washington, D.C. to initiate court
proceedings should the legislation
be approved.
Asked why there were not more
people picketing, Klinger said that
there had not been enough time to
organize any demonstration. "The
next time he (McCloskey) comes
here, we'll have mass picketing and
mass demonstrations."
Asked what would happen if
young people did not choose the ac
tive duty options in his proposals,
McCloskey replied "We'll face that
problem when it comes."
One element of the proposal that
McCloskey clarified was that no one
who volunteers for the community


Pete McCloskey
service option of his program would
ever he subjected to actual conscrip
tion into the armed forces.
As evidence of the lack of readi
ness of U.S. forces, McCloskey cited
the failure of the Air Force, the most
popular branch of the service, to
meet their minimum recruitment
quota last year. He also pointed to
high drug use as evidence of the un
fitness of U.S. troops.
Spending limits
The meeting did not cover just
McCloskey's service proposal. Most
of the crowd of about 400 were
senior citizens who had come to ask
questions about social security and
balancing the budget.
McCloskey favors a constitutional
amendment initiated by Congress to
set limits on government spending.
"The all-volunteer army is not
working and is not combat-ready.
That is the basic reason I am submit
ting this legislation."
