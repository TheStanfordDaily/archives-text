# LoPresti, Kuhn pace Card sweep
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Two outstanding pitching
performances propelled the
Stanford baseball team past the
Chico State Wildcats 6-4 and
3-1 Saturday at Stanford's Sun
ken Diamond.
A steady diet of sliders and
fastballs delivered by Cardinal
starters Joe LoPresti and Larry
Kuhn stymied the Chico St. of
fensive efforts. LoPresti
pitched all but 1-1/3 innings of
the first contest and Kuhn went
the distance in the shorter,
seven-inning second game of
the twinbill. Stanford's
sweep of the doubleheader
brings its pre-season record to
an impressive 7-0 mark.
"I haven't seen either of
those guys look sharper/' said
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess about the perfor
mances of LoPresti and Kuhn.
"I'd have to say that in the last
four games the pitching has
been excellent."
LoPresti effortlessly pitched
the first five innings, collecting
five strikeouts while scattering
three harmless Chico singles.
An unearned run in the sixth

inning, however, ruined any
shutout hopes.
In the top of the sixth,
Wildcat shortstop Rick Berry
reached first on an error. He
advanced to second on a wild
pitch and from there he scored
on Kevin Callahan's weak
single that dropped in halfway
between third base and the
left field fence.
After pitching a one-two
three seventh inning, LoPresti
was again plagued by the Chico
shortstop. Berry led off the
eighth inning by lacing a line
drive off LoPresti's legs. Two
outs later, LoPresti walked his
first batter in the game, and got
the hook from Marquess.
"I wasn't angry," said LoP
resti, "I was disappointed. I de
finitely felt strong enough to
finish the game ... I could
have at least retired the next
batter."
Freshman Mike Sullivan re
lieved LoPresti and allowed
both of the runners LoPresti
had left on base to score. Sulli
van gave up one run of his own
in the ninth inning, but pre
served the victory for Stanford.
In the second game Satur

day, Kuhn faced only 24 batters
in his seven-inning stint, retir
ing six of those on strikeouts.
The hard-throwing right
hander settled down to his
rhythm after the first inning
when he gave up two of
Chico's three hits and their
only run of the game.
Stanford waited until the
bottom of the fifth inning to
rally and go of the
Wildcats who led the game 1-0
from its start. The Cards had
been hitting the ball hard —
but right at someone — for the
first four innings.
Pyle led off the fifth with a
walk and was replaced by
pinch runner Bill Casey who
promptly stole second base.
Casey sped home on Phil Wil
son's single to center for Stan
ford's first run.
Freshman outfielder Mike
Toothman knocked Wilson
home with his first hit in 15 var
sity at bats — a triple wacked to
the fence in the right-field
power alley.
Pat Crow, the designated hit
ter in the game, was credited
with Stanford's last run of the
inning with a single to left that

scored Tooth man.
Though Marquess has relied
on the same tew starters for the
early pre-season games, win
ning results make it hard to
fault his decision. Stanford
pitchers who have had very few
innings of work on the mound
thus far — Mark Abbondola,
jerry Battenberg, Rob Irwin
and Brian Harrison — will get
their chance this coming week.
The Cards play seven games
in seven days this week, and ail
hurlers except injured Brian
Harrison and Bruce Fiala will
see some action.
