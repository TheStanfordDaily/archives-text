Stanford's varsity golt team
had a disappointing showing in
a match at Davis Friday, finish
ing fifth with a *85 team score
behind San Jose State (373),
Nevada-Reno (373), University
of the Pacific (378) and UC-
Davis (383).
The Cardinals' weak showing
can be mostly explained by the
fact that three of their top
players missed the match:
David Gaines, Kim Cater and
Steve Schader, the numbers
two, three and four men re
spectiely for Stanford.
"With those three we prob

ably would have won quite eas
ily," said Card coach Bruce
Summerhays.
Stanford's no. 1 man, Doug
Clarke, distinguished himself
well, firing a par 72 on the El
Macero CC course to tie for the
best individual score. Other
wise, Summerhays was not so
pleased, commenting that his
men, though mostly second
teamers, still should have fared
better.
Today the Cards return to
the links in San Francisco
against USF and St. Mary's in a
12 noon match.
