# Gymnasts enjoy active weekend

Berkeley — Although their
records won't fully reflect it,
Stanford's gymnastics teams
performed well in a busy but
promising weekend of action.
Friday night at Maples Pavil
ion, the women dropped a
heartbreaker to defending
conference champion San Jose
State. Making progress by
leaps and flips since last year,
the 125.55 to 124.90 loss, a
mere .65 difference, neverthe
less goes down in the record
books.
The Cardinal men fared well
in outscoring USC and San
lose, with 204.15 to the Trojans'
202.4 and the Spartans' 196.65.
Saturday night at California's
Harmon Gym, the Stanford
men finished third in a field of
four tough teams. The Golden
Bears, favorites to capture the
Pacific-10 championships, rol
led up 216.40 points, followed
by a surprisingly talented Long
Beach City College squad at
208.40. The Cards compiled a
205.60 total, a season best, and
UC-Davis out together a 190.85
tally.
Despite putting on their sec
ond best showing of the sea
son against one of the region's
top teams, the Stanford
women have only a 2-4 record
and inspired determination to
show for it.
The Spartan team score of
125.55 equalled Stanford's
school mark set last week at
Davis. The most encouraging
part of the mathematics is that
last season the Cards trailed
San Jose by a margin ranging
from almost 15 to 18 points.
In Friday's meet, Stanford ec
lipsed the Spartans in uneven
parallel bars and balance
beam, setting a school event
record in the former.
Now that they've passed
their "bar exam," the Cards
need to conduct intensified
practice in vaulting if they are

goingtowin theircase with San
lose in the conference meet
next month.
"It was obviously our best
performance of the year on
bars," head coach Jackie
Walker said. "The judges even
commented after the meet
how much improved everyone
was on bars. Vaulting was not
up to par — there's always 'if
this' and 'if that' — if vaulting
had been on — and if there had
been one less fall on beam we
would've won the meet. But
you can't expect everything to
go right."
Individually, Karen Hall
swept all-around honors with a
third in vaulting, personal
bests of 8.9 on bars and 9.05 on
balance beam for firsts and a
first in floor exercise. Her score
of 34.80 is a season best and
set a school mark.
Card Annie Smith earned
third in all-around by finishing
fourth in vaulting, third in floor
and beam and second on bars.
Jeanette Lacoste placed fourth
in both bar and beam competi
tion.
In the men's competition
Friday night, Stanford's Tad
Bostick earned second in all
around with 50.45, placing fifth
on pommel horse, third in high
bar and floor and second in
valuting. Mike Lee placed third
in all-around with a sixth on
bars and a fourth on borse. Bob
Daniel finished fifth, coming in
sixth on bars, third in vaulting,
fifth on high bar and fourth in
floor.
Other top performances in
cluded Dan Wessner's sixth on
rings, Craig Goldman's fifth on
rings, Jeff Chung's sixth in vau
lting, John Marra's sixth on
bars and Bob Maganini's fifth
in floor. Brian Nelson placed
third on high bar and fifth on
bars and Chris Takimoto again
outdistanced the opposition,
winning pommel horse by .55
points.

In Saturday's competition,
the men's record went to 6-3
and was noteworthy because
of the overall improvement
and consistency of the
routines.
The high-degree of experi
ence and talent on the Cal and
Long Beach teams prevented
Card gymnasts from breaking
through to the top four places,
except for Takimoto who won
his specialty again with a 9.5,
improving his score by a point
over Friday. Stanford's improv
ing depth was evident as Bos

tick placed fourth in all-around
with a 51.85.
"Definitely we have no weak
events now," coach Sadao
Hamada said. "We're getting
pretty consistent — about a
34-point average (per event).
Last night we missed on paral
lel bars and high bar, but the
other events were good. To
night, the same thing, a little
off in bars but we still got 205.6
which is a record so far, so
things are going along pretty
well. We have to get a little
more consistency."
