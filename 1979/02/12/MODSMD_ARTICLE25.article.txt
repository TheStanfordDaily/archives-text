# Netters triumph

The Stanford women's tennis team opened its season without
most of its big guns but nevertheless displayed a lot of power,
defeating host Fresno State Friday 6-3.
All-Americans Susie Hagey, Diane Morrison and Kathy Jordan
did not participate in the match, but their absences made no
difference. Led by sophomore Donna Rubin, the Cardinals won
five of the six singles matches. Freshmen Sue Rasmussen, Lisa
Cordon and Julia Leighton also won their singles matches hand
ily.
Rubin and Rasmussen also teamed up to give Stanford its only
doubles win, 7-5, 6-0 over Shauna Goedhard and Mary Ellen
Dunn.
"I'm very pleased with our play," said coach Anne Gould. "It
shows what kind of depth we have. Our three freshmen in the
lineup came through very well, though I know they were nerv
ous."
Tuesday the Cards travel to Santa Clara to face the Bronco
women. Gould said that her All-American trio will not perform
then, either, though they will probably see action this Saturday
when Stanford has its initial home match against the University of
Colorado.
