# Cards face WSU on TV tonight
## Soggy cagers fall to Washington 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Seattle — It was a cold, wet
climate that greeted the bas
ketball Cardinals as they
traveled to Seattle to face the
Washington Huskies Saturday
night. The weather must have
affected the Cards' play, be
cause their cold shooting and
sloppy ballhandling drowned
them out of the game, 84-63.
Washington's victory breaks
Stanford's four-game winning
streak in Card-Husky competi
tion. The loss puts the Cards at
4-8 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence and 10-11 overall.
Both Washington and Stan
ford displayed weak offense in
the first half. Washington shot
47 percent (14-for-30) from the
field and 60 percent from the
line. Stanford scored on a mere
43 percent (10-for-23) of its
field goals attempts and 38 per
cent of its free throws.
Torn Schmalzried was Stan
ford's only ray of sunshine in
the first half, scoring 11 of his
15 points in the first 10 mi
nutes. Guarded by 6-foot-8
James Woods in a man-to-man

defense, Schmalzried shot an
amazing 100 percent from the
field and the line in the first
half. Card coach Dick Dißiaso
said, "It was Tom's best game
since Santa Clara."
Dißiaso cited Schmalzried's
good performance against the
challenge of 7-2 Petur Gud
mundsson and said he'd have
to follow up at Washington
State tonight against 7-2, 280-
Ib. James Donaldson.
But in the second half
Schmalzried's performance
proved detrimental to the
Cards. The four points he
scored hardly equaled the
damage he did by committing
fouls, and with 6:30 remaining
to play he picked up his fifth
foul, ending his participation
for the night.
Both teams played good de
fense, keeping the first-half
score low at 34-25 Washington.
Still, Husky guard Don Vaughn
seemed to rule the floor, scor
ing 13 of his 17 points in the
first half.
Vaughn was all over the
court, shooting through Stan

ford's man-to-man and zone
defenses. There was no stop
ping Vaughn, the first-half's
high scorer.
"Vaughn just played his tail
off," Husky coach Marv Har
shman said. "We played that
way with everybody. We came
to play."
Center Gudmundsson was
a definite threat, considering
his 37-point total in Thursday's
contest against California. But
the Cards were on top of him
and held him to only nine
points.
With 5:42 remaining, Gud
mundsson fouled out. Marty
Mattila saw his first court ac
tion of the season at that point,
substituting for Gud
mundsson. He displayed good
form, scoring seven points in
six minutes.
"It just goes to show that the
coach doesn't know very
much, or he would have been
playing more," Harshman
commented.
Perhaps the Cards' biggest
disappointment was forward

kimberly Belton. He just
couldn't seem to turn it on,
shooting only one-for-four
from the field and a shocking
four-for-16 from the line.
In the second half Wolfe
Perry really tried to pour it on,
rebounding, speeding down
the court and scoring. Al
though his efforts earned him
high-scoring honors with 20
points, it wasn't enough, for
Washington's lead continued
to grow to a 23-point spread.
Coach Harshman said that
the Huskies had changed their
strategy from the Jan. 13 con
test at Stanford, won by the
Cards 80-69.
"Perry and (Brian) Welch are
good shooters, so we tried to
hold them up on the screens.
That was our whole plan," he
said.
A terse Dißiaso simply
stated, "Washington played an
outstanding game, and we
didn't."
More team play is expected
as the Cards try to turn it
around against Washington

State tonight at 8 p.m. The
game will be televised on
KBHK-TV, channel 44.

fouled out Schmalzried. Gudmundsson.
Seattle — It was a cold, wet
climate that greeted the bas
ketball Cardinals as they
traveled to Seattle to face the
Washington Huskies Saturday
night. The weather must have
affected the Cards' play, be
cause their cold shooting and
sloppy ballhandling drowned
them out of the game, 84-63.
Washington's victory breaks
Stanford's four-game winning
streak in Card-Husky competi
tion. The loss puts the Cards at
4-8 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence and 10-11 overall.
Both Washington and Stan
ford displayed weak offense in
the first half. Washington shot
47 percent (14-for-30) from the
field and 60 percent from the
line. Stanford scored on a mere
43 percent (10-for-23) of its
field goals attempts and 38 per
cent of its free throws.
Torn Schmalzried was Stan
ford's only ray of sunshine in
the first half, scoring 11 of his
15 points in the first 10 mi
nutes. Guarded by 6-foot-8
James Woods in a man-to-man

defense, Schmalzried shot an
amazing 100 percent from the
field and the line in the first
half. Card coach Dick Dißiaso
said, "It was Tom's best game
since Santa Clara."
Dißiaso cited Schmalzried's
good performance against the
challenge of 7-2 Petur Gud
mundsson and said he'd have
to follow up at Washington
State tonight against 7-2, 280-
Ib. James Donaldson.
But in the second half
Schmalzried's performance
proved detrimental to the
Cards. The four points he
scored hardly equaled the
damage he did by committing
fouls, and with 6:30 remaining
to play he picked up his fifth
foul, ending his participation
for the night.
Both teams played good de
fense, keeping the first-half
score low at 34-25 Washington.
Still, Husky guard Don Vaughn
seemed to rule the floor, scor
ing 13 of his 17 points in the
first half.
Vaughn was all over the
court, shooting through Stan

ford's man-to-man and zone
defenses. There was no stop
ping Vaughn, the first-half's
high scorer.
"Vaughn just played his tail
off," Husky coach Marv Har
shman said. "We played that
way with everybody. We came
to play."
Center Gudmundsson was
a definite threat, considering
his 37-point total in Thursday's
contest against California. But
the Cards were on top of him
and held him to only nine
points.
With 5:42 remaining, Gud
mundsson fouled out. Marty
Mattila saw his first court ac
tion of the season at that point,
substituting for Gud
mundsson. He displayed good
form, scoring seven points in
six minutes.
"It just goes to show that the
coach doesn't know very
much, or he would have been
playing more," Harshman
commented.
Perhaps the Cards' biggest
disappointment was forward

kimberly Belton. He just
couldn't seem to turn it on,
shooting only one-for-four
from the field and a shocking
four-for-16 from the line.
In the second half Wolfe
Perry really tried to pour it on,
rebounding, speeding down
the court and scoring. Al
though his efforts earned him
high-scoring honors with 20
points, it wasn't enough, for
Washington's lead continued
to grow to a 23-point spread.
Coach Harshman said that
the Huskies had changed their
strategy from the Jan. 13 con
test at Stanford, won by the
Cards 80-69.
"Perry and (Brian) Welch are
good shooters, so we tried to
hold them up on the screens.
That was our whole plan," he
said.
A terse Dißiaso simply
stated, "Washington played an
outstanding game, and we
didn't."
More team play is expected
as the Cards try to turn it
around against Washington

State tonight at 8 p.m. The
game will be televised on
KBHK-TV, channel 44.
