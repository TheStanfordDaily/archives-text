# Card spikers drop league opener
## 
### John Doane 
"They were strong, quick,
and played super defense,"
said assistant volleyball coach
John Bekins. "They were too
consistent for us tonight."
"They" were Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo, Stanford's first
CIVA (California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association)
opponent Friday night, and un
fortunately for the Cardinals,
"they" were extremely tough
in posting a 15-9, 15-13, 15-9
sweep over Stanford at Roble
Gymnasium.
Steady overall
Not especially tall with hit
ters averaging 6-foot-1, the
Mustangs relied on their
steady passing and excellent
overall court sense to wear
down the talented though
young Cards.
Santa Barbara native Chuck
"Dieter" Hayes sparked Cal
Poly defensively, picking up
balls with reckless abandon
and passing flawlessly. Team
mate Rick Flauser gave the
Stanford blockers a lesson in
hitting off the block as the 6-0
strong-side attacker consis

tently "tooled" the ball off
Cardinal hands for Cal Poly
points and side-outs.
Seniors Lindon Crow and
Paul Draper provided the Mus
tangs with powerful net-play as
they took turns pounding the
ball near the 10-foot line and
also combined on several de
vastating roof blocks.
In the first game, Stanford
kept close to Cal Poly with con
sistent passing, and Bekins
noted that Stanford "executed
reasonably well."
Junior Dave Carico and junior
back-row specialist Tom
Grimes kept Stanford close until
the Mustangs pulled ahead to
stay with the aid of the tenaci
ous, scrappy defense. Middle
blocker Draper dominated the
net with his blocking, shutting
off the Cardinal attack to end
game one.
Card standout Dave Saeta
missed Friday's match with the
flu, but replacement Carico
was more than adequate. The
6-1 sophomore was especially
valuable at the serving line, as
his dipping top-spin serve was
Stanford's most effective

weapon against the unwaver
ing Cal Poly passing machine.
The Cards appeared to be
headed for a comeback in the
second game as they overcame
early-game passing blunders to
pull ahead of the Mustangs at
7-6.
Cal Poly then rattled off five
straight points enroute to a
12-8 lead, but Randy Smith
singlehandedly won three
straight points with clutch hit
ting and blocking to bring Stan
ford to within one.
Smith nailed down the first
of those points with aferocious
solo stuff off the Draper, but
Cal Poly's Hayes took over and
won the game with another
one-on-one block.
Hayes and Co. continued
business in the final game by
doggedly refusing to let up,
even when the Mustangs
opened up large leads. This
third and decisive game was
also the most exciting despite
its unfortunate outcome for
Stanford.
Hauser and Crow pounded
away at Gregg Kelly's various
quick sets, and Hayes flung his

body around the backcourt to
pick up stray balls. At one
point, the 6-2 junior served the
ball, sprinted cross-court and

dove under the body of an air
borne teammate to pick up a
dink. Said Bekins, "He (Hayes)
hurt us."
