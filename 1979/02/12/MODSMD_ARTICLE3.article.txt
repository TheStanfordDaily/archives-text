# ASSU grounds charter service

ASSUTravel Service charters won't
get off the ground this year. In fact,
the charter service, which existed for
14 years, technically closed shop
after the Christmas break, according
to Bill Lape, ASSU financial manager.
However, the Travel Service itself
still exists.
Pursuant to CAB regulations that
permit groups to book entire flights,
the Travel Service chartered planes
from domestic airlines and operated
the charters to New York, Boston,
Chicago and Washington, D.C. dur
ing school recesses at approximately
50 percent off regular coach fares.
Such savings were realized be
cause ASSU charter fares reflected
little more than was necessary to
cover overhead costs. "The idea is
that all projects break even," Lape
said.
But with CAB deregulation of air
lines, ASSU couldn't get charter

prices good enough to enable them
to charge a fare lower than commer
cial discount fares. The typical dis
count affords air travelers up to 50
percent of regular coach fares. Thus,
there ceased to be a need for the
ASSU Travel Service to act as a mid
dleman, Lape said.
Since these discounts can be had
on any flight — provided one books
the flight and buys the ticket at least
30 days in advance — they afford stu
dents more flexibility in travel ar
rangements than ASSU's charters,
Lape explained. The requirement
that the discount traveller stay at
least seven days but not more than 45
days at his destination poses no
problem for students because it is
ideal for those who go home during
school recesses.
As a result, the Travel Service suf
fered a marked decrease in the
number of students using its charters
last Christmas. "We used to fill eight

to nine charters," Lape said. "This
year we only filled four."
Therefore ASSU decided to dis
continue its charters, including the
annual Hawaii charter for spring
break. Sequoia Travel Center here
will handle much of this business.
Ellie Friar, manager of Sequoia, said
she neither anticipates any difficulty
in handling the increased business
nor plans to take special steps to ac
commodate it.
Anne Schechter, ASSU student
travel adviser, will provide other ser
vices of the Travel Service in the
Overseas Resource Center in the
Bechtel International Center.
"The domestic charters comprised
90 percent of the Travel Service's
business," Lape explained. "Ten
percent of our business was the sel
ling of international student char
ters, student discount passes and
I.D.'s and burail passes. We will con
tinue doing this."
