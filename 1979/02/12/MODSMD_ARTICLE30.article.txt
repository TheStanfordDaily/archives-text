Israel to resume peace talks
Jerusalem — Israel yesterday accepted an Ameri
can invitation to resume peace talks with Egypt at
Camp David, Md., later this month but announced
no softening of its stand on unresolved issues.
Egypt accepted the invitation last week.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin said there
would be a break in the Camp David talks so
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Egyptian Prime
Minister Mustafa Khalil could consult with their
governments, an indication that the talks may go
beyond the three or four days originally planned.
The meeting is expected to start in about 10
days, but no time has been officially announced.
Begin rejected criticism in the annual U.S. State
Department human rights report alleging that Is
rael suspended human rights protection in some
security cases in the occupied West Bank of )ordan
and the Gaza Strip.
The human rights report accused Israel of "in
stances of mistreatment" of Palestinian prisoners,
but gave Israel good marks for conduct in territory
captured in the 1967 war.
House prepares first bill action
Washington — While the Seriate takes the week
off, the House prepares to pass its first bill of the
year and to hear from demonstrating farmers.
A House panel will consider whether Iranian oil
cutbacks mean Americans may soon be faced with
long lines at the gasoline pump.
Neither chamber planned a session for today
because of Lincoln's birthday observances.
But the House returns tomorrow with a full slate
of committee hearings — including the first in a
series of sessions by the House Agriculture Com
mittee on the economic plight of the U.S. farmer.
Members of Congress are due to testify tomor
row while protesting farmers, in town lobbying for
increased federal price supports for their pro
ducts, go before the panel Wednesday and Thurs
day.
House passage of the first bill to reach the floor
in the 96th Congress is expected tomorrow. It sets
terms for the sale of approximately one million
rare "Carson City" silver dollars.
The Senate is in recess until Feb. 19.
Poll shows support for SALT pact
New York — Public support for a new SALT ag
reement with the Soviet LJnion is now the highest
it has been in three years, an Associated Press-

NBC News poll shows.
The increased backing for a new treaty limiting
nuclear weapons is based on the growing percep
tion that such a pact will enhance U.S. security and
that it will reduce the chances of a nuclear
holocaust.
The burgeoning support for a new pact comes as
Soviet and American negotiators work out the de
tails of a new treaty, although no date has been set
for signing a new agreement.
Eighty-one percent of those interviewed across
the country Feb. 5 and 6 said they favor a new SALT
treaty. That is the highest level of support since the
question was first asked in 1976.
Asked why they support a SALT pact, the over
whelming reason given was to reduce the chance
of a nuclear war.
BART tunnel needs more testing
San Francisco — Bay Area Rapid Transit officials
dropped plans yesterday to reopen a transbay
tunnel between San Francisco and Oakland this
week, citing the need for more tests to prove that
the system is now safe.
A hearing on the tunnel — ordered shut after a
fatal fire last month — ended abruptly yesterday
after two key witnesses told BART officials during a
recess that they weren't ready to testify in favor of
resuming operations.
"BART proceeded too swiftly," said San Fran
cisco Fire Chief Aridrew Casper, one of the key
witnesses. "Nothing in the plans shows how the
handicapped would be taken care of in a disaster.
We need to evaluate the ventilation system and
conduct more smoke tests.
"Where we should have been stepping, we
were bounding," said Casper, adding that further
tests were planned this week.
The state Public Utilities Commission, which
conducted the hearing, adjourned the meeting
after five hours of testimony. The commission said
it would wait until BART has proof that the system
is safe and evacuation plans are tested.
Chavez orders end to picketing
El Centro — In the wake of a fatal shooting,
union leader Cesar Chavez ordered an end to pic
keting yesterday in an effort to ease explosive ten
sions and said farm workers would stage a general
work stoppage throughout the Imperial Valley on
the day of the burial.
In a meeting of the farm owners' Committee for
Fair Negotiations Between Growers and Workers

yesterday, the eight struck growers voted to sus
pend harvesting efforts on the day of Rufino
Contreras-Mijangos' funeral, which has yet to be
scheduled.
Meanwhile, Imperial County Sheriff's Lt.
Richard Wilson said three men — two foremen
and a strikebreaker — have been booked for in
vestigation of murder in the death Saturday of the
28-year-old Contreras-Mijangos, who lived in the
Mexican border town of Mexicali. Names of the
three men were not released, but Wilson said the
two foremen had been freed on $7000 bail each.
"We should not take revenge. We will leave that
up to the courts," Chavez told about 1000 strikers
at a memorial mass yesterday morning on the out
skirts of Calexico.
White pleads innocent again
San Francisco — Dan White pleaded innocent
last Friday to the City Hall murders of Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk last
November.
Superior Court Judge Claude Perasso revoked
White's $1 million bail, saying he considered the
murders "an unbailable offense." He set the trial
to begin March 26, with a pretrial hearing for
March 21.
White, 32, entered the same plea as he had last
month when he was bound over to Superior Court
at a Municipal Court arraignment. Attorney Doug
las Schmidt, as he did at the earlier appearance,
reserved the right to change the plea later to inno
cent by reason of insanity.
Clad in a bright orange city jail jump suit, White
stared impassively at the court clerk's desk during
the 20-minute arraignment. White never looked at
his wife, Mary Ann, who was seated in the front
row.
He spoke three times, once to affirm his name
and twice to mumble, "Not guilty," when asked
how he pleaded to the two murder charges.
Schmidt told )udge Perasso he did not think he
could be ready by the trial date, but the judge told
him to be prepared to show "good cause" on
March 21 if he asked for a delay.

Israel to resume peace talks
Jerusalem — Israel yesterday accepted an Ameri
can invitation to resume peace talks with Egypt at
Camp David, Md., later this month but announced
no softening of its stand on unresolved issues.
Egypt accepted the invitation last week.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin said there
would be a break in the Camp David talks so
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Egyptian Prime
Minister Mustafa Khalil could consult with their
governments, an indication that the talks may go
beyond the three or four days originally planned.
The meeting is expected to start in about 10
days, but no time has been officially announced.
Begin rejected criticism in the annual U.S. State
Department human rights report alleging that Is
rael suspended human rights protection in some
security cases in the occupied West Bank of )ordan
and the Gaza Strip.
The human rights report accused Israel of "in
stances of mistreatment" of Palestinian prisoners,
but gave Israel good marks for conduct in territory
captured in the 1967 war.
House prepares first bill action
Washington — While the Seriate takes the week
off, the House prepares to pass its first bill of the
year and to hear from demonstrating farmers.
A House panel will consider whether Iranian oil
cutbacks mean Americans may soon be faced with
long lines at the gasoline pump.
Neither chamber planned a session for today
because of Lincoln's birthday observances.
But the House returns tomorrow with a full slate
of committee hearings — including the first in a
series of sessions by the House Agriculture Com
mittee on the economic plight of the U.S. farmer.
Members of Congress are due to testify tomor
row while protesting farmers, in town lobbying for
increased federal price supports for their pro
ducts, go before the panel Wednesday and Thurs
day.
House passage of the first bill to reach the floor
in the 96th Congress is expected tomorrow. It sets
terms for the sale of approximately one million
rare "Carson City" silver dollars.
The Senate is in recess until Feb. 19.
Poll shows support for SALT pact
New York — Public support for a new SALT ag
reement with the Soviet LJnion is now the highest
it has been in three years, an Associated Press-

NBC News poll shows.
The increased backing for a new treaty limiting
nuclear weapons is based on the growing percep
tion that such a pact will enhance U.S. security and
that it will reduce the chances of a nuclear
holocaust.
The burgeoning support for a new pact comes as
Soviet and American negotiators work out the de
tails of a new treaty, although no date has been set
for signing a new agreement.
Eighty-one percent of those interviewed across
the country Feb. 5 and 6 said they favor a new SALT
treaty. That is the highest level of support since the
question was first asked in 1976.
Asked why they support a SALT pact, the over
whelming reason given was to reduce the chance
of a nuclear war.
BART tunnel needs more testing
San Francisco — Bay Area Rapid Transit officials
dropped plans yesterday to reopen a transbay
tunnel between San Francisco and Oakland this
week, citing the need for more tests to prove that
the system is now safe.
A hearing on the tunnel — ordered shut after a
fatal fire last month — ended abruptly yesterday
after two key witnesses told BART officials during a
recess that they weren't ready to testify in favor of
resuming operations.
"BART proceeded too swiftly," said San Fran
cisco Fire Chief Aridrew Casper, one of the key
witnesses. "Nothing in the plans shows how the
handicapped would be taken care of in a disaster.
We need to evaluate the ventilation system and
conduct more smoke tests.
"Where we should have been stepping, we
were bounding," said Casper, adding that further
tests were planned this week.
The state Public Utilities Commission, which
conducted the hearing, adjourned the meeting
after five hours of testimony. The commission said
it would wait until BART has proof that the system
is safe and evacuation plans are tested.
Chavez orders end to picketing
El Centro — In the wake of a fatal shooting,
union leader Cesar Chavez ordered an end to pic
keting yesterday in an effort to ease explosive ten
sions and said farm workers would stage a general
work stoppage throughout the Imperial Valley on
the day of the burial.
In a meeting of the farm owners' Committee for
Fair Negotiations Between Growers and Workers

yesterday, the eight struck growers voted to sus
pend harvesting efforts on the day of Rufino
Contreras-Mijangos' funeral, which has yet to be
scheduled.
Meanwhile, Imperial County Sheriff's Lt.
Richard Wilson said three men — two foremen
and a strikebreaker — have been booked for in
vestigation of murder in the death Saturday of the
28-year-old Contreras-Mijangos, who lived in the
Mexican border town of Mexicali. Names of the
three men were not released, but Wilson said the
two foremen had been freed on $7000 bail each.
"We should not take revenge. We will leave that
up to the courts," Chavez told about 1000 strikers
at a memorial mass yesterday morning on the out
skirts of Calexico.
White pleads innocent again
San Francisco — Dan White pleaded innocent
