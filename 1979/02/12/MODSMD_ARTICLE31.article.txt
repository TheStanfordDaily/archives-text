# Dolby new at KZSU

KZSU has installed the Dolby noise
reduction system which cuts down
on "hiss," or high frequency sound,
according to Mark Lawrence, chief
engineer.
Lawrence said that the "Christmas
present" from Dolby Laboratories ar
rived at KZSU "about a month ago,"
and became operative )an. 28.
The benefit to the listener is "bet
ter reception of material with quiet
passages," said Lawrence. The Dolby
system also provides cleaner sound,
said Station Manager Tom Price.
However, the system will make lit
tle or no difference to listeners with
out Dolby in their home receivers,

said Price.
There is a debate whether a station
should go to the Dolby system at a
time when most people don't have
the system in their home receivers,
Price said.
Price explained that he feels the
Dolby is a "wave of the future." Sta
tions will go to the Dolby system for
the same reason that stations
switched to stereo before most
people had a stereo in their homes,
he said.
Hiss is heard on an FM station or
tape recorder when the volume is
turned way up. The Dolby system
separates the signal into high and
low frequencies, leaving the low fre
quencies unchanged. The high fre
quency signal is passed through a
high pass filter and "boosted" (in
creased in sound), while the noise
system level is constant. The sound is
then played back at that signal-to
noise ratio, and the effect for the lis
tener is reduced hiss, Lawrence
explained.
