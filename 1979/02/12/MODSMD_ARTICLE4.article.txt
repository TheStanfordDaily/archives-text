Tehran, Iran (AP) â€” Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar reportedly res
igned yesterday after Iran's military
chief declared support for Ayatollah
RuhoMah Khomeini. The 2500-year
old Iranian monarchy appeared to be
in its final hours.
The government news agency
placed the death toll in Tehran at
more than 200 with scores killed in
other cities during two days of
bloody street fighting.
Khomeini's followers took over
Tehran Radio and issued a series of
directives from the Provisional Re
volutionary Government. The
broadcasts said the shah-backed
Bakhtiar government had fallen and
all members of Parliament had res
igned.
The Khomeini followers also re
ported fighting continued in some
cities but urged Tehran residents "to
refrain from attacks on the armed
forces now that the revolution has

triumphed and the armed forces
have surrendered."
Among many rumors circulating in
Tehran were that Bakhtiar had fled
the country and that he committed
suicide.
Military support
Gen. Abbas Gharabaghi, chief of
staff of the armed forces, met with
70-year-old Mehdi Bazargan, named
by Khomeini to be his prime minis
ter, and said he would support the
government set up by Khomeini to
establish a "revolutionary" Islamic
replublic. The military chief ordered
troops to stay in their barracks.
The withdrawal of troops appeared
to break the back of the constitu
tional monarchy that depended
heavily on a loyal united military.
Khomeini, the 78-year-old religi
ous leader who returned to Iran
Feb.l after 14 years of exile, declared
in a statement that "victory is near."
Insurgent control
Insurgents took over Tehran, loot
ing military posts of weapons and
ammunition, occupying government
buildings and police stations and rac
ing through the streets flashing "V"
for victory signs. They raided several
prisons and released hundreds of
"political" detainees jailed by the
shah as common criminals.
Early today, huge explosions
shook the western side of the city
near Mehrabad International Air
port. Tehran Radio said Jay barracks,
one of Iran's largest tank garrisons,
was in flames. The radio reported
heavy shooting there, in Majlis
Square and two other areas of the
capital.
A source close to Bakhtiar told The
Associated Press the prime minister
submitted his resignation in the af
ternoon to Bazargan, a friend of over
30 years.
No comment from Bakhtiar
Ibrahim Yazdi, Khomeini's chief
aide, said Bakhtiar, 54, had quit.
There was no comment from Bakht
iar, and his whereabouts were un
known. Sources said the prime
minister, appointed Jan. 4, wrote his
resignation because he could not
continue without military support.
Tehran Radio, overtaken by insur
gents, said the speaker of the Majlis,
the parliament, announced that all
members of Parliament had res
igned.
Tehran Radio said some military
personnel were resisting

Charabaghi's statement, but it
quoted the commander of the shah's
elite Imperial Guard as saying "I wish
to state with much pride that the Im
perial Guard is on the side of the
nation."
Borders closed
In one of its first acts, the provi
sional operational staff of the Islamic
Revolutionary Movement closed
Iran's borders and all airports for 24
hours beginning today, Tehran Radio
said.
In Washington, the Pentagon or
dered a detachment of 69 Marines
sent from the United States toTurkey
in case they were needed to help 19
Marines protect the U.S. Embassy in
Iran. Six Air Force helicopters were
being flown to Turkey in case Ameri
cans had to be evacuated from
Tehran, Defense Dept. spokesman
Thomas Lambert said.
State Dept. spokesman Kenneth
Brown said the 7000 Americans in
Iran were safe "to the best of our
knowledge."
'Anguished expectation'
In Marrakech, Morocco, sources
close to Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, 59, said he was in a state of
"anguished expectation" as he fol
lowed events from his "vacation"
seclusion there. He left Iran in mid-
January. The sources said he was fol
lowingthe events through Iran's U.S.
and European embassies.
In a radio and television address,
Bazargan said he was pleased to hear
"the army will not interfere in politi

cal affairs and that they have sup
ported the will of the people."
The military decision to follow
"the will of the people" came after
two days of bloody rioting in which
many soldiers joined the opposition,
exploding the notion that the
430,000-man armed forces were un
ited behind the Bakhtiar govern
ment.
"The armed forces with all its
power supports the wishes of the
people," said a statement broadcast
by Iranian state radio.
Pars, the government news
agency, said 211 people were killed
and 870 wounded in Tehran. In the
southern city of Shiraz, officials re
ported 34 killed and 310 wounded in
fighting between loyalists and insur
gents. Peaceful demonstrations were
reported in Isfahan, the country's
second-largest city.
Tomb attacked
The shah's Imperial Guard said six
officers were slain in Rey, south of
Tehran, when insurgents attacked
the tomb of Reza Shah, the shah's
father and founder of the 54-year-old
Pahlavi dynasty.
In a recorded radio message,
Khomeini asked his followers to
"prevent any anarchy and chaos and
not to allow ill-intentioned troub
lemakers to engage in plunder, ar
son, punishing the accused and de
struction of private or public prop
erty . . . and make our movement
look barbaric and reactionary."
Khomeini said the enemy "still has
resources for all manner of intrigues
and plots."
Yazdi said the former chief of the
shah's feared secret police force
SAVAK, Gen. Nematullah Nassiri,
had been taken prisoner along with
former Prime Minister Emir Abbas
Hoveida. Also arrested was Tehran's
military governor, Lt. Mehdi Rahimi.

The ayatollah, spiritual head of
Iran's 32 million Shiite Moslems,
demanded Bakhtiar resign so Iran
could be transformed into a non
aligned Islamic republic. Khomeini
leads the religious opposition that
feels the shah's "Westernization" of
Iran has eroded Islamic values. Also
opposing the monarch is a rising
middle class that wants more say in
the government.
