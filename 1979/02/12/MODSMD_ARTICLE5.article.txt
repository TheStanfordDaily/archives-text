### Tony Rupert 
The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) has
begun a campaign to catch and de
port foreign students in the United
States who have violated their status
as foreign students, according to
Monica Bell, deputy director of the
San Francisco district of the INS.
Mary Clark, assistant director of
the Bechtel International Center,
said that the steps to be taken by the
INS could have serious affects on the
1701 foreign students here.
Clark said that the INS contacted
her on Jan. 11, asking to find out the
number of foreign students at the
University. Since the request was for
the number of foreign students,
which is a matter of public informa
tion, she provided the information,
Clark said.
Status violations
Bell said that foreign students viol
ate their status if they:
—work without the INS's author
ity;
—stay in the United States beyond
their termination date;
—drop out of school; or
—transfer schools without the
INS's permission.
Additionally, their status can be
terminated for "cause," a discretio
nary term subject to the interpreta
tion of the INS.
Clark said she is outraged over this
last provision, which she feels could
be used to deport foreign students
for extremely trivial items, such as
"irresponsible behavior."
Irresponsible behavior
"I went to a meeting at the INS last
Thursday," said Clark," to ask what
that phrase 'irresponsible behavior'

meant. The things that they told us
included: writing bad checks, not
paying rent, being drunk or getting
in a brawl. These are things that
could happen to any student on oc
casion. The situation is particuarly
difficult for Iranian students since
they have not been able to receive
money out of their country lately."
Clark said that at the INS meeting
Bell said that the INS's specific plans
were to not approve any foreign stu
dent's request for extension of stay
until a personal interview had been
conducted to determine whether the
student had violated his or her
status.
Chance for rescinding
Clark also said that she felt there
was a good chance that the INS
would rescind the entire action. "We
argued over every point with them,"
she said. "We were uncooperative,
and we plan to put more pressure on
them in the future."
The move to increase supervision
of foreign students was begun last
month by Attorney General Griffin
Bell when he saw news reports of
Iranian students confronting the
police and setting a car afire outside
the home of the sister of Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in Beverly
Hills.
INS Deputy Director Bell denied
that the move was directed solely
toward Iranian students. However,
when the INS made a request of all
American universities, including
Stanford, for the number of their
foreign students, the request did not
ask forthe students' names, but it did
ask that the total be broken down by
country.
