# Howard U. exchange provides black campus environment
## 
### Robert Reed 
Have you ever wondered what it
would be like to go to school at another
university? Of course. Have you ever
wondered what it would be like to go to
school at a black university? Maybe not.
But if you have, you may be able to find
out this fall.
A new student exchange program is
underway here with Howard University.
Howard, in Washington, D.C., is the na
tion's leading predominantly black uni
versity.
"(Students) will get a different perspec
tive," according to Melanie Reeves, assis
tant dean of undergraduate studies.
Reeves was instrumental in formulating
the program.
Reeves said that not only "the fact that
it is a different environment, both
academically and socially," but that stu
dents will be taught by black faculty
should interest them in this program.
"It sounds like a worthwhile thing to try
to do," said President Richard Lyman,
about the program. Lyman also said the
exchange idea sounded "interesting."
But while the idea is interesting, it is not
novel.

A similar program, involving an ex
change with an all-black university, was
tried in the early 1970's with Atlanta's
Morehouse/Spelman University. Due, in
part at least, to what Reeves described as
"culture shock," as well as administra
tional problems, the program fizzled out
after only a couple of years. However,
student interest never died.
Two years ago, a group of interested
students approached Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Harold Boyd with the idea
about the Howard exchange. By April of
last year, Boyd, in conjunction with
Reeves and the students, had placed a
final proposal on the desk of then-
Provost William Miller last April. Final ap
proval from Miller came in May.
However, this approval came too late
to generate much interest here. Thus, no
University students were able to partici
pate in the exchange planned for this
year.
However, one Howard student was.
Some exchange now
"It was critical that some exchange
went on last fall," said Reeves, pointing
out that in order to "keep up the momen
tum," she and Boyd asked Miller to allow

one Howard student, Myron Williams, to
participate in the program, without an
even exchange.
"Everyone cooperated ... to make
sure that Myron could come," said
Reeves, explaining that once Williams
was accepted into the program, all the
University departments involved in the
program, such as admissions, under
graduate studies and housing, worked
quickly and in cooperation to make the
effort work.
Williams, who has gone back east now,
was interested not only in the University's
prestige, but also in the fact that it is pre
dominantly white, said Reeves.
"I always wanted to see what it was like
to go to an all-black university," said
Kym Lew, a black senior here who stop
ped out for a year to go to Howard. Lew
was one of the undergraduates involved
in getting the Howard program started
here.
Social aspect
"To me, Stanford is lacking in the
amount of black people it has," said Lew.
This social aspect of the Howard experi
ence was one of the factors involved in

Lew's transfer to Howard, but she was
able to find something more.
"I had a lot of black professors . . . that
made it more conducive to learning,"
said Lew, who had gone to predomin
antly white schools (taught mainly by
white professors) throughout much of
her life. "It's really enjoyable to (be
taught by) all black professors," said Lew,
"It's a different experience."
Lew called being able to go to both a
prestigious and predominantly white
school like Stanford and a prestigious and
predominantly black school like Howard
the "ultimate (academic) experience."
'Cross-fertilization'
What the program hopes to bring
about is a "cross-fertilization of ideas,"
said Laura Selznick, an assistant to
Reeves. Selznick said that the sharing of
each student's experiences with his peers
will be as important as the student's ex
perience itself.
Although it has always been open to
people of all races, Howard, since its be
ginning in 1867, has also always been
predominantly black.
Though privately controlled, Howard is

almost wholly supported by federal
funds. The co-ed university usually has an
enrollment of a little more than 5800 stu
dents operating under the school's
semester system,
Open to all
Though the Howard exchange program
may seem more interesting to black stu
dents, the program is open to all stu
dents. Application opens Feb. 15, with a
final due date of April 6, and final decision
coming on April 20.
An advisory committee to Herant
Katchadourian, dean of undergraduate
studies (which directs this program), will
be making the selections of students
qualified for the program. The commit
tee, composed of Reeves, Boyd, Fred
Hargadon, dean of undergraduate ad
mission, Mary Roberts, assistant financial
aids director, and Bob Houghton, as
sociate registrar, will only be making re
commendations of students to Howard.
The committee's counterpart at Howard
will be making the final selection.
Four students, preferably entering
their junior vear, will be chosen to enter
Howard this fall.

Reeves said that not only "the fact that
it is a different environment, both
academically and socially," but that stu
dents will be taught by black faculty
should interest them in this program.
"It sounds like a worthwhile thing to try
to do," said President Richard Lyman,
about the program. Lyman also said the
exchange idea sounded "interesting."
But while the idea is interesting, it is not
novel.

A similar program, involving an ex
change with an all-black university, was
tried in the early 1970's with Atlanta's
Morehouse/Spelman University. Due, in
part at least, to what Reeves described as
"culture shock," as well as administra
tional problems, the program fizzled out
after only a couple of years. However,
student interest never died.
Two years ago, a group of interested
students approached Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Harold Boyd with the idea
about the Howard exchange. By April of
last year, Boyd, in conjunction with
Reeves and the students, had placed a
final proposal on the desk of then-
Provost William Miller last April. Final ap
proval from Miller came in May.
However, this approval came too late
to generate much interest here. Thus, no
University students were able to partici
pate in the exchange planned for this
year.
However, one Howard student was.
Some exchange now
"It was critical that some exchange
went on last fall," said Reeves, pointing
out that in order to "keep up the momen
tum," she and Boyd asked Miller to allow

one Howard student, Myron Williams, to
participate in the program, without an
even exchange.
"Everyone cooperated ... to make
sure that Myron could come," said
Reeves, explaining that once Williams
was accepted into the program, all the
University departments involved in the
program, such as admissions, under
graduate studies and housing, worked
quickly and in cooperation to make the
effort work.
Williams, who has gone back east now,
was interested not only in the University's
prestige, but also in the fact that it is pre
dominantly white, said Reeves.
"I always wanted to see what it was like
to go to an all-black university," said
Kym Lew, a black senior here who stop
ped out for a year to go to Howard. Lew
was one of the undergraduates involved
in getting the Howard program started
here.
Social aspect
"To me, Stanford is lacking in the
amount of black people it has," said Lew.
This social aspect of the Howard experi
ence was one of the factors involved in

Lew's transfer to Howard, but she was
able to find something more.
"I had a lot of black professors . . . that
made it more conducive to learning,"
said Lew, who had gone to predomin
antly white schools (taught mainly by
white professors) throughout much of
her life. "It's really enjoyable to (be
taught by) all black professors," said Lew,
"It's a different experience."
Lew called being able to go to both a
prestigious and predominantly white
school like Stanford and a prestigious and
predominantly black school like Howard
the "ultimate (academic) experience."
'Cross-fertilization'
What the program hopes to bring
about is a "cross-fertilization of ideas,"
said Laura Selznick, an assistant to
Reeves. Selznick said that the sharing of
each student's experiences with his peers
will be as important as the student's ex
perience itself.
Although it has always been open to
people of all races, Howard, since its be
ginning in 1867, has also always been
predominantly black.
Though privately controlled, Howard is

almost wholly supported by federal
funds. The co-ed university usually has an
enrollment of a little more than 5800 stu
dents operating under the school's
semester system,
Open to all
Though the Howard exchange program
may seem more interesting to black stu
dents, the program is open to all stu
dents. Application opens Feb. 15, with a
final due date of April 6, and final decision
coming on April 20.
An advisory committee to Herant
Katchadourian, dean of undergraduate
studies (which directs this program), will
be making the selections of students
qualified for the program. The commit
tee, composed of Reeves, Boyd, Fred
Hargadon, dean of undergraduate ad
mission, Mary Roberts, assistant financial
aids director, and Bob Houghton, as
sociate registrar, will only be making re
commendations of students to Howard.
The committee's counterpart at Howard
will be making the final selection.
Four students, preferably entering
their junior vear, will be chosen to enter
Howard this fall.
Have you ever wondered what it
would be like to go to school at another
university? Of course. Have you ever
wondered what it would be like to go to
school at a black university? Maybe not.
But if you have, you may be able to find
out this fall.
A new student exchange program is
underway here with Howard University.
Howard, in Washington, D.C., is the na
tion's leading predominantly black uni
versity.

tive," according to Melanie Reeves, assis
tant dean of undergraduate studies.
