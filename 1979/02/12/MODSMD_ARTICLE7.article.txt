Kung Hay Fat Choy! Emblazoned across store
fronts, on banners and billboards, pasted on
trucks, cars and hot dog stands, "Kung Hay Fat
Choy," Chinese for "Happy New Year,"
exhorted more than four hundred thousand
spectators of the Chinese New Year's parade to
celebrate and forget their troubles.
The Year of the Ram, the 4677 th on the
Chinese calendar, brought a new and unceratin
future to the relationship ol the People's Repub
lic of China and Taiwan.
But Saturday night, San Francisco's Chinese
population left their gripes at home. In the
words ot a San Franc isco police officer who has
been on duty for the last fifteen parades, "This is
always a family affair. People come out tonight
with their families and celebrate together."
The officer said that problems only occur after
the parade, usually caused by small groups of
troublemakers. Asked it any demonstrations
were anticipated during the parade, the officer
replied, "We have no intelligence to support
that notion at all. All we expect is maybe a few
bottles thrown, a burglary or two and thousands
and thousands of people having a good time."
The significance ol the incoming year of the
Ram is difficult to determine due to the am
biguity of the original Chinese character sym
bolizing this year; it < an be read as ram, sheep,
goat or lamb.
According to the wisemen of Chinatown,
however, it can be said that due to the docile
naturesof the sheep, this year is likely to be a
peaceful one; protest movements will be mini
mal .
The parade is actually the < ulmination of the
New Year's celebrations. The tirst few days of
the year are spent among family members in
quiet contemplation. Only later do the fes
tivities begin, ending with the parade ol the
Golden Dragon.

Tin' dragon himsell is the most important part
of the parade. His purpose is to ward off evil
spirits and assure happiness and prosperity; the
millions of firecrackers are designed to assist
him.
Ihe lamb was a sacrificial animal in China as
far back as 22 B.C. Inasmuch as it is said to accept
death submissively, it is a symbol of acquies
(ence and self-denial.
Agrarian prosperity is forecast as well because
the sheep has long been considered one of the
most important of the domesticated creatures.
1 he Year of the Ram is also considered the most
propitious for marriage.
Individuals born under the sign of the ram are
sensitive, refined and altruistic. Though pas
sionate by nature, they are shy and prefer to lose
themselves in the flock. Sheep people dip proli
fically into the arts and have a flair for money
making.
Prominent members of this group include
Thomas Edison, James Michener, lohn Wayne,
and Amy Carter.
Fhe Year of the Ram is one of twelve years in
the Chinese cycle, which began in 2637 B.C.
The Chinatown parade attracted a variety of
spectators and participants. Over four hundred
thousand people are estimated to have seen the
parade as it wound its way through the streets of
San Francisco.
Along with the usual retinue of dragons, in
cluding the city's ISO foot monster imported
espet lally from Hong Kong, the parade featured
various San Francisco personalities including
Mayor Diane Feinstein, a marching band formed
by San Francisco's gay community, as well as
several Scot Bag and Drum formations. The con
testants for the Miss Chinatown U.S.A. contest
were presented, as well as various cultural and
social groups such as martial arts clubs and
schools.
