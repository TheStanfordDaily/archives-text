In theory the 500,000 foreign students in this
country are a major medium for technology
transfer. A large percentage of this burgeoning
number of students is supported either by their
own countries or receives grants offered by var
ious agencies of the U.S. government. The in
vestment is considerable both in terms of funds
and manpower involved.
Yet, according to Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service estimates, more than half of the
foreign graduates will stay in the United States
legally or illegally. Those that would like to stay
constitute an even larger percentage.
Foreign students concentrate on engineering
and the hard sciences. Of 20 major universities
polled, foreign engineering students on the av
erage constitute more than half of all graduate
students.
The numbers are obviously significant, and the
subject cannot be ignored. The issue affects the
economies of many countries, personal prob
lems of foreign students and the U.S. institu
tions' responsibilities (if any) towards their
growing foreign student population.
In a global sense, the needs of the economies
of Third World countries are significantly diffe
rent from those of the U.S. economy. When a
foreign student leaves his country, the inherent
assumption is that he will, upon graduation, re
turn home, presumably carrying along with him
the technological wonders of America.
S;nce many countries have neither the capac
ity nor the means to develop technology from
"scratch," this means of transfer would have
some merit if it were successful. The staggering
number of "no returns" points, however, to the
fallacy of the original assumptions.
Those foreign graduates that return face di
verse expectations, substantially different from
U.S. industrial job opportunities, and almost in
variably a higher level of responsibility. We pol
led overlso recent alumni of 20 U.S. universities
currently employed in 26 different countries.
Over 70 percent stated that their job is either all
management or almost all management with lit
tle technology.
In contrast, the career path of the U.S. coun
terpart consists of a much smoother transition
from academia into industry. Normally an en
gineer here will take a job with a major industrial
concern, work within a group and ease his way
either towards management or high expertise
on facets of technology.

It is clear that American universities do not
prepare foreign students for careers in their re
spective countries. It is doubtful that would
even be feasible. The needs of various countries
differ. To expect U.S. universities to fulfill all
these needs would be unrealistic.
One, of course, would expect U.S. engineering
departments to be sensitive to foreign students'
needs since the latter fill chairs otherwise vac
ated due to high demands of U.S. graduates by
the industry.
Many engineering departments, however,
have lost touch with reality. Pragmatism and re
levance do not count among the "vices" of
some of the most famous institutions. American
academia in general is not the best medium to
acquaint one's self with American technology.
As a consequence, a U.S.-educated student
faces problems. While in school he is acutely
aware of the shortcomings of his education.
Upon graduation he either has to go home in
adequately prepared or attempt to stay here.
While the needs of additional manpower in
the U.S. industry have not peaked yet, projec
tions point to saturation in the near future.
I suggest that the mode of technology transfer
by educating foreign students in the United
States has performed less than adequately. The
ratio of "no returns" alone is sufficient proof
that the system is not working. Further,
whenever a need for U.S. expertise arises in a
foreign country, the traditional method of
technology transfer is via experienced person
nel of American companies, not the U.S.-
educated natives.
A much more efficient form of technology
transfer would be direct training of foreign en
gineers by U.S. companies after graduation
from foreign universities. The system can be
developed either under the auspices of an in
ternational organization such as UNESCO or
with direct bilateral arrangements between the
foreign concerns and U.S. companies.
Whatever the cost to the foreign country, it
will undoubtedly be smaller than the irreversi
ble loss of funds and manpower now ex
perienced. For American companies it may be a
source of additional income (this time on an
equitable basis). The foreign student with the
unresolved dilemma may become a phenome
non of the past.

verse expectations, substantially different from
U.S. industrial job opportunities, and almost in
variably a higher level of responsibility. We pol
led overlso recent alumni of 20 U.S. universities
currently employed in 26 different countries.
Over 70 percent stated that their job is either all
management or almost all management with lit
tle technology.
In contrast, the career path of the U.S. coun
terpart consists of a much smoother transition
from academia into industry. Normally an en
gineer here will take a job with a major industrial
concern, work within a group and ease his way
either towards management or high expertise
on facets of technology.

It is clear that American universities do not
prepare foreign students for careers in their re
spective countries. It is doubtful that would
even be feasible. The needs of various countries
differ. To expect U.S. universities to fulfill all
these needs would be unrealistic.
One, of course, would expect U.S. engineering
departments to be sensitive to foreign students'
needs since the latter fill chairs otherwise vac
ated due to high demands of U.S. graduates by
the industry.
Many engineering departments, however,
have lost touch with reality. Pragmatism and re
levance do not count among the "vices" of
some of the most famous institutions. American
academia in general is not the best medium to
acquaint one's self with American technology.
As a consequence, a U.S.-educated student
faces problems. While in school he is acutely
aware of the shortcomings of his education.
Upon graduation he either has to go home in
adequately prepared or attempt to stay here.
While the needs of additional manpower in
the U.S. industry have not peaked yet, projec
tions point to saturation in the near future.
I suggest that the mode of technology transfer
by educating foreign students in the United
States has performed less than adequately. The
ratio of "no returns" alone is sufficient proof
that the system is not working. Further,
whenever a need for U.S. expertise arises in a
foreign country, the traditional method of
technology transfer is via experienced person
nel of American companies, not the U.S.-
educated natives.
A much more efficient form of technology
transfer would be direct training of foreign en
gineers by U.S. companies after graduation
from foreign universities. The system can be
developed either under the auspices of an in
ternational organization such as UNESCO or
with direct bilateral arrangements between the
foreign concerns and U.S. companies.
Whatever the cost to the foreign country, it
will undoubtedly be smaller than the irreversi
ble loss of funds and manpower now ex
perienced. For American companies it may be a
source of additional income (this time on an
equitable basis). The foreign student with the
unresolved dilemma may become a phenome
non of the past.

In theory the 500,000 foreign students in this
country are a major medium for technology
transfer. A large percentage of this burgeoning
number of students is supported either by their
own countries or receives grants offered by var
ious agencies of the U.S. government. The in
vestment is considerable both in terms of funds
and manpower involved.
Yet, according to Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service estimates, more than half of the
foreign graduates will stay in the United States
legally or illegally. Those that would like to stay
constitute an even larger percentage.
Foreign students concentrate on engineering
and the hard sciences. Of 20 major universities
polled, foreign engineering students on the av
erage constitute more than half of all graduate
students.
The numbers are obviously significant, and the
subject cannot be ignored. The issue affects the
economies of many countries, personal prob
lems of foreign students and the U.S. institu
tions' responsibilities (if any) towards their
growing foreign student population.
In a global sense, the needs of the economies
of Third World countries are significantly diffe
rent from those of the U.S. economy. When a
foreign student leaves his country, the inherent
assumption is that he will, upon graduation, re
turn home, presumably carrying along with him
the technological wonders of America.
S;nce many countries have neither the capac
ity nor the means to develop technology from
"scratch," this means of transfer would have
some merit if it were successful. The staggering
number of "no returns" points, however, to the
fallacy of the original assumptions.
