# Reputation of Stanford pre-med ill-founded

Question: How many pre-meds
does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Answer: Two. One to hold the
light bulb and the other to pull the
chair out from under him.
Do pre-meds deserve the "chair
pulling" reputation that many
people give them? Are the horror
stories of sabotaged labs, lost re
serve reading and disappearing
notes true?
Mary Jean Luczak, president of the
Stanford Pre-medical Society and a
sophomore majoring in biological
sciences, said, "There is no need to
pull thechairouton someone. Many
pull the chair out on themselves."
One senior here said that during
her three years as a pre-med, some
one sabotaged her work once.
Jon Fujita, freshman pre-med,
said, "I've heard of stories about get
ting screwed over. I haven't had any
problems of getting shafted, but
then I haven't had any labs yet. I
really don't worry about it."
R'-.iiul Naidu, another freshman
pre-med said,"a few demented
pre-meds are giving a crummy repu
tation to the entire group." How
ever, he added, "it would be foolish
not to watch out for the other guy."
Luczak said, "I have never experi
enced it (sabotage). I've never heard
any case here and I don't worry
about it."
The occurences of sabot
age and stealing seem almost
foreign here, with the only known
cases usually being overblown
rumors.
So what is the cause of the pre
med's foreboding reputation? The
answer, said Luczak, is pressure.
"Life as a pre-med is like a long
distance run with lots of hardships
along the way. If I can just make it to
the end, I know I'll make it to medi

cal school. Pre-meds must believe in
delayed satisfaction. I love being a
pre-med," she said.
There is a general feeling on cam
pus that a large percentage of un
dergraduates are pre-medical stu
dents. However, according to Ann
Coxan, assistant director of the
Academic Information Center (AIC),
the true figure is closer to 18 percent
and has remained so for about the
last six years.
The fact that about 70 percent of
the University's undergraduates ap
plying to medical school are ac-

cepted perhaps eases the pressure
upon the Stanford pre-med. The ac
ceptance rate at UC-Berkeley is 46
percent. In comparison the national
average is 33 percent.
Peter Van Houten, director of the
Office of Student Advising and As
sistance at Berkeley explained the
lower figures.
"Our success is depressed by the
general situation in California,
where there is a consistently low ac
ceptance rate of 32 percent," he
said. "The reason is because so
many Californians are trying to get
into California public medical
schools.
"Sabotage â€” you hear about that
sort of thing, but I can't say I recall
any actual cases. I was involved with
the Dean of Student Affairs Office
for a number of years and I don't
remember a case. It can happen, it
may happen, but I think it's a lot of

rumors," Van Houten said.
Regardless of the 70 percent ad
missions figures, pre-meds here still
feel pressure.
Pre-med life is intense but a lot of
it is self-imposed. It's a question of
attitude. If you want it to be intense,
it will be," said Rowland Reyna,
pre-medical adviser at the AIC and a
first year medical student here.
Reyna, a former undergraduate
here, retlected on his life as a Stan
ford pre-med, "I stopped worrying
about competition after a while. If
you do well, you have a good chance
of getting into med school. Get de
cent grades and become involved in
some extracurricular activities.
Some people really go for the big
name schools and that in itself adds
pressure. Looking back at it all, I'll
have to say it was worth it," Reyna
said.
Reyna said he realized that the
pressure on the pre-med was a result
of the medical school admissions
system. "There's not a lot anyone
can do. The mentalities of the
chemistry professors could change.
They feel that they have a moral ob
ligation to weed out the undesira
bles. They need to change their at
titudes. Instead of worrying about
weeding out, they should be wor
ried about learning," Reyna said.
Chemistry Prof. James Collman
disagreed. "I don't believe our fa
culty find it their job to weed out
students. The chemistry course
material is comprehensive, objec
tive, and difficult, and as a result
most undergraduates don't do as
well as they did in high school
courses. Chemistry becomes a hur
dle they have to get over for medical
school," Collmun said.
Assoc. Prof, of Biology Ward Watt
gave his own solutions to the prob
lem of pressure.

"The essence of the problem is
that people are coming here from
high school and they have to adjust
to the social and intellectual atmos
phere. Many freshmen find that
their academic performance doesn't
satisfy their expectations. Students
have to realize that a shaky start is
very frequent. It is very possible to
compensate later. Any medical
school admissions committee with
any salt will look more at the present
state of a person," Watt said.
"It is my personal view that the
entire freshman year should be de
clared pass/no credit. The student

should still receive grades for feed
back on his performance but only
pass/no credit grades would appear
on the transcript," Watt said "This
still leaves plenty of time for admis
sions committees to formulate grade
point averages."
"One argument against this is that
as a result of such a grading system,
Stanford students will not be as
good. To that I say organic fertilizer.
The primary reason why Stanford
students are good is because bolh
the people and the fundamental
quality of education here are good,"
Watt said.
"My experience with pre-med
students at Stanford says that they are
neat people. I don't think the pre
med label is just. It deals with a
stereotype. To characterize people
in such a stereotype is...loath
some."
