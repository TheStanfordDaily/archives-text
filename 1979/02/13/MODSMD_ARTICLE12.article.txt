# Minimal background required
## Luce Scholars work at institutions in Asia 
### Shirley Gines 
It is puzzling at first to un
derstand why an organization
would send 15 people each
year to Asia who are "inhe
rently naive" about the cul
ture. Yet, one of the qualifica
tions for a Luce Scholar is to
have as little in-depth know
ledge as possible about an
Asian country, its language, or
its history. Six University stu
dents have been selected as
scholars in this program since
its inception five years ago.
Why is someone who is basi
cally unknowledgeable about
Asia chosen rather than an ex
pert? A 1973 University
graduate assigned to Korea,
Anne West, explained,
"People who go with a
background have no previous
conceptions; they can explore
more on their own."
Ron Herring, program
liaison here, explained that a
person with substantial
background "already has a
commitment and warmth to
ward Asia and will probably
continue to have the opportun
ity possible. We take those
who would not otherwise have

the chance except through the
program," he said.
The qualifications for a Luce
Scholar are formidable. Ac
cording to Herring, one has to
have excellent academic
abilities, strong leadership po
tential and capabilities, con
crete plans on how one's
career is going to develop and
be less than 30 years old when
the program begins. Recent
graduates from college are ac
cepted, Herring said, but they
have to be exceptional.
Herring said the Luce Scho
lars committee seeks those
"who have gone out and tried
their wings." The committee
wants potential leaders who
"will have an impact and will
carry over their knowledge to
the ways that they deal with
co-workers, colleagues and
friends," he said.
Tough competition
The competition is stiff. Sixty
colleges each recommend
three students and 15 are cho
sen. This year, the University
did not recommend any stu
dents, Herring said.
The scholars are placed in an

Asian institution, usually one
that deals with their careers,
such as a newspaper agency, a
research institute, or an art
studio. Unlike the Volunteers
in Asia Program, they do not
necessarily teach English.
West, an artist who recently
opened an art show in San
Francisco, taught Western art
to 37 sophomores at Ewha
Women's University in Seoul.
The Westerners, she
explained, value "honesty" in
painting, whereas the Easter
ners value "beauty." For
example, she said, when the
students painted a model, they
emphasized her beauty and
idealized her figure. West said
she had to emphasize to them
that the "space around the
model was an equal compo
nent, worthy of attention as the
model was."
Singapore
Bill Wilka, a lawyer in Palo
Alto, and his wife Theresa, a
law student here, recently re
turned from their stay in Sin
gapore, which they call "virtu
ally the cleanest city in the
world." Bill Wilka taught law at

the University of Singapore, a
school modeled after Cam
bridge and Oxford.
Bill and Theresa Wilka
travelled a great deal in
Malaysia and Asia. They recal
led one incident when a man
offered them breakfast and a
place to stay. "Our initial re
sponse was to say, like any
American, 'Thank you, but we
don't need any help'," Bill
Wilka said. He said the man
brought them to his home in a
kampong, a village outside of
town with houses on stilts and
chickens and pigs milling ab
out. The man's hospitality
"typified their generosity.
They didn't ask for anything in
return, except for us to re
member them," Bill Wilka said.
Adjustments
The scholars had to deal with
a variety of adjustments. "I be
came more gregarious by
necessity," West said. "The
way of thinking was quite diffe
rent from the way I was ex
posed to." She said that the
priorities of the people were of

"frankness, honesty and forth
rightness." West said she was
offered a studio space at the
university although there really
wasn't space. "They offered it
out of politeness, not out of
deception,"
West said the people in
Korea were much more "hu
man oriented. They would
rather be with friends than with
one's self and projects. I con
tinually thought, 'I've got to go
to my studio and paint!' " But
West said she soon realized
that the "spontaneous experi
ences were worth more and of
fered more than schedules."
West also talked of a Korean
woman she befriended who
was about to marry. As with ail
brides-to-be, this woman had
to consult a fortune teller for
the suitable wedding date, she
said. The bride-to-be refused
to be married on that day —
literally breaking a custom —
because it was West's birthday.
Finally, the woman's mother
gave in, and she consulted the
fortune teller foranother date.

ences were worth more and of
fered more than schedules."
West also talked of a Korean
woman she befriended who
was about to marry. As with ail
brides-to-be, this woman had
to consult a fortune teller for
the suitable wedding date, she
said. The bride-to-be refused
to be married on that day —
literally breaking a custom —
because it was West's birthday.
Finally, the woman's mother
gave in, and she consulted the
fortune teller foranother date.

It is puzzling at first to un
derstand why an organization
would send 15 people each
year to Asia who are "inhe
rently naive" about the cul
ture. Yet, one of the qualifica
tions for a Luce Scholar is to
have as little in-depth know
ledge as possible about an
Asian country, its language, or
its history. Six University stu
dents have been selected as
scholars in this program since
its inception five years ago.
Why is someone who is basi
cally unknowledgeable about
Asia chosen rather than an ex
pert? A 1973 University
graduate assigned to Korea,
Anne West, explained,
"People who go with a
background have no previous
conceptions; they can explore
more on their own."
Ron Herring, program
liaison here, explained that a
person with substantial
background "already has a
commitment and warmth to
ward Asia and will probably
continue to have the opportun
ity possible. We take those
who would not otherwise have

the chance except through the
program," he said.
The qualifications for a Luce
Scholar are formidable. Ac
cording to Herring, one has to
have excellent academic
abilities, strong leadership po
tential and capabilities, con
crete plans on how one's
career is going to develop and
be less than 30 years old when
the program begins. Recent
graduates from college are ac
cepted, Herring said, but they
have to be exceptional.
Herring said the Luce Scho
lars committee seeks those
"who have gone out and tried
their wings." The committee
wants potential leaders who
"will have an impact and will
carry over their knowledge to
the ways that they deal with
co-workers, colleagues and
friends," he said.
Tough competition
The competition is stiff. Sixty
colleges each recommend
three students and 15 are cho
sen. This year, the University
did not recommend any stu
dents, Herring said.
The scholars are placed in an

Asian institution, usually one
that deals with their careers,
such as a newspaper agency, a
research institute, or an art
studio. Unlike the Volunteers
in Asia Program, they do not
necessarily teach English.
West, an artist who recently
opened an art show in San
Francisco, taught Western art
to 37 sophomores at Ewha
Women's University in Seoul.
The Westerners, she
explained, value "honesty" in
painting, whereas the Easter
ners value "beauty." For
example, she said, when the
students painted a model, they
emphasized her beauty and
idealized her figure. West said
she had to emphasize to them
that the "space around the
model was an equal compo
nent, worthy of attention as the
model was."
Singapore
Bill Wilka, a lawyer in Palo
Alto, and his wife Theresa, a
law student here, recently re
turned from their stay in Sin
gapore, which they call "virtu
ally the cleanest city in the
world." Bill Wilka taught law at

the University of Singapore, a
school modeled after Cam
bridge and Oxford.
Bill and Theresa Wilka
travelled a great deal in
Malaysia and Asia. They recal
led one incident when a man
offered them breakfast and a
place to stay. "Our initial re
sponse was to say, like any
American, 'Thank you, but we
don't need any help'," Bill
Wilka said. He said the man
brought them to his home in a
kampong, a village outside of
town with houses on stilts and
chickens and pigs milling ab
out. The man's hospitality
"typified their generosity.
They didn't ask for anything in
return, except for us to re
member them," Bill Wilka said.
Adjustments
The scholars had to deal with
a variety of adjustments. "I be
came more gregarious by
necessity," West said. "The
way of thinking was quite diffe
rent from the way I was ex
posed to." She said that the
priorities of the people were of

"frankness, honesty and forth
rightness." West said she was
offered a studio space at the
university although there really
wasn't space. "They offered it
out of politeness, not out of
deception,"
West said the people in
Korea were much more "hu
man oriented. They would
rather be with friends than with
one's self and projects. I con
tinually thought, 'I've got to go
to my studio and paint!' " But
West said she soon realized
that the "spontaneous experi
ences were worth more and of
fered more than schedules."
West also talked of a Korean
woman she befriended who
