## Kaky McTigue RANE falls on nukes 
### 
Life persists in the midst of destruction; and,
therefore, there must be a higher law than that of
destruction.
-Ghandi
Nuclear power and weapons are the most
immediate and deadly threats to the continued
existence of the human race that have ever been
faced.
For many years now, information has been
raining down on us about the odds and con
sequences of a nuclear accident, the entirely
unsolved problems of waste storage and the
growing probability of nuclear weapons being
used as their proliferation proceeds unchecked.
Counter-information, generally provided by the
power companies developing nuclear reactors,
has also been widely distributed, particularly as
these companies find more and more people
asking the worrisome questions that have, as
yet, no reassuring answers.
For most people, the result of the debate is
still confusion. The complexities of the nuclear
question often intimidate non-experts, a
situation the utility companies and the govern
ment are willing to encourage. ("Leave it to us —
we know what we're doing".)
But there are ways to overcome such intimida
tion. We all have the ability, and the obligation,
to investigate seemingly abstract aspects of the
nuclear age such as hydrogen bombs, en
hanced radiation devices, plutonium proces
sing, waste storage, radiation tolerance,
weapons proliferation, first-strike nuclear sub
marines, blowdowns, breakdowns, burnouts
and death.
Following are some questions you might be
interested in finding answers to:
— What is going to happen to the nuclear
waste? In the United States there are already 71
million gallons of high-level waste being stored
temporarily, as well as 3 000 metric tons of spent
fuel rods being stored "on site." Some of this
waste will be extremely dangerous for hundreds
of thousands of years. Government officials
have promised to guard it "for 500,000 years."
This isn't particularly reassuring.
— Is there any motive other than profit and
the desire to centralize energy that compels the
utility companies to build nuclear plants that are
dangerous, capital-intensive, technologically
unreliable and economically marginal?
— With more and more countries obtaining
nuclear weapons capability and "cleaner" and
smallerweapons being developed by the United
States, what is going to prevent the eventual use
of nuclear weapons? (It might sharpen the de
bate to add that the United States has strongly
considered using nuclear weapons seven times
since 1945 — once the United States offered
three nuclear bombs to France for the defense
of French troops trapped at Dienßienphu in In
dochina).
— What are the reasons behind the strong
Pentagon support for the Trident submarines
now being developed — a weapon specifically
designed as a "first-strike" (that is, attacking
rather than defending) weapon?
— What is the relationship between the de
velopment of nuclear power and the develop
ment of nuclear weapons?
— Why are so many of the decisions to build
nuclear plants and develop nuclear weapons
being made outside of the power spheres that
people like us can — however marginally —
affect?

— What security measures will be necessary
to safeguard nuclear materials and nuclear
facilities from sabotage and theft? Is the au
thoritarian nuclear state the answer? Is it the
answer you want?
All over the world, people are organizing to
meet the dangers of nuclear power and
weapons. In Germany and France, massive oc
cupations have stopped the construction of
several power plants and reprocessing facilities.
In Austria, and in the states of Montana and
Vermont, the decision to build nuclear power
plants now must be made through general re
ferendum. In Sweden, the question of nuclear
power played a major role in bringing down two
governments. In New Hampshire, it cost the
governor re-election, and continued protests
against the Seabrook plant have once again
brought construction to a halt.
In California the focus is the Diablo Canyon
plant in San Luis Obisbo, which is located al
most on top of an earthquake fault and is near
completion. Also under fire are the nuclear re
search activities at the University of California,
the Livermore Labs, the Vallicitas Research
Reactor and the labs of Lockheed in Sunnyvale.
A number of workers, students, and commun
ity members here have begun meeting with the
hope of doing something to stop the nuclear
threat. We intend to affiliate with the Abalone
Alliance, the statewide coalition of anti-nuclear
groups. Along with Abalone, we will take part in
upcoming anti-nuclear actions such as the
March demonstration against the Trident Sub
marine in Sunnyvale, the mid-April mass rally in
San Francisco and future direct actions against
the Diablo Power Plant and PG&E, who is build
ing it.
We are also affiliated with the Black Rose Col
lective here at the University and share its prin
ciples of non-hierarchical structure, feminist
process and democratic decision-making (our
ties to the Black Rose explain our otherwise
obscure reasons for our name, RANE: Roses
Against a Nuclear Environment).
As members of the Abalone Alliance, we ac
cept the importance of non-violent direct ac
tion, of putting forward workable energy and
job alternatives to nuclear power, and of de
veloping an analysis of nuclear proliferation that
goes beyond the technology to the roots of the
economic and ideological forces that drive it.
The Abalone Alliance pledges to use nonvio
lent, direct action to:
— stop the construction and operation of all
nuclear power plants in California;
— promote the realistic alternatives of safe,
clean and renewable sources of energy;
— support efforts to eliminate nuclear
weapons;
— inspire people to change energy policies
which hold their lives in precarious balance and
— build a more loving and responsible world
for ourselves, for our children, and for future
generations of all living things on this planet.
We join with the Abalone Alliance in this
pledge. All people interested in becoming in
volved in anti-nuclear work, and all who are
interested in knowing some of the answers to
the nuclear questions, are invited to come to a
free showing of "Lovejoy's Nuclear War" and an
organizational meeting tonight in Tresidder.

— Is there any motive other than profit and
the desire to centralize energy that compels the
utility companies to build nuclear plants that are
dangerous, capital-intensive, technologically

All over the world, people are organizing to
meet the dangers of nuclear power and
weapons. In Germany and France, massive oc
cupations have stopped the construction of
several power plants and reprocessing facilities.
In Austria, and in the states of Montana and
Vermont, the decision to build nuclear power
plants now must be made through general re
ferendum. In Sweden, the question of nuclear
power played a major role in bringing down two
governments. In New Hampshire, it cost the
governor re-election, and continued protests
against the Seabrook plant have once again
brought construction to a halt.
In California the focus is the Diablo Canyon
plant in San Luis Obisbo, which is located al
most on top of an earthquake fault and is near
completion. Also under fire are the nuclear re
search activities at the University of California,
the Livermore Labs, the Vallicitas Research
Reactor and the labs of Lockheed in Sunnyvale.
A number of workers, students, and commun
ity members here have begun meeting with the
hope of doing something to stop the nuclear
threat. We intend to affiliate with the Abalone
Alliance, the statewide coalition of anti-nuclear
groups. Along with Abalone, we will take part in
upcoming anti-nuclear actions such as the
March demonstration against the Trident Sub
marine in Sunnyvale, the mid-April mass rally in
San Francisco and future direct actions against
the Diablo Power Plant and PG&E, who is build
ing it.
We are also affiliated with the Black Rose Col
lective here at the University and share its prin
ciples of non-hierarchical structure, feminist
process and democratic decision-making (our
ties to the Black Rose explain our otherwise
obscure reasons for our name, RANE: Roses
Against a Nuclear Environment).
As members of the Abalone Alliance, we ac
cept the importance of non-violent direct ac
tion, of putting forward workable energy and
job alternatives to nuclear power, and of de
veloping an analysis of nuclear proliferation that
goes beyond the technology to the roots of the
economic and ideological forces that drive it.
The Abalone Alliance pledges to use nonvio
lent, direct action to:
— stop the construction and operation of all
nuclear power plants in California;
— promote the realistic alternatives of safe,
clean and renewable sources of energy;
— support efforts to eliminate nuclear
weapons;
— inspire people to change energy policies
which hold their lives in precarious balance and
— build a more loving and responsible world
for ourselves, for our children, and for future
generations of all living things on this planet.
We join with the Abalone Alliance in this
pledge. All people interested in becoming in
volved in anti-nuclear work, and all who are
interested in knowing some of the answers to
the nuclear questions, are invited to come to a
free showing of "Lovejoy's Nuclear War" and an
organizational meeting tonight in Tresidder.

Nuclear power and weapons are the most
immediate and deadly threats to the continued
existence of the human race that have ever been
faced.
For many years now, information has been
raining down on us about the odds and con
sequences of a nuclear accident, the entirely
unsolved problems of waste storage and the
growing probability of nuclear weapons being
used as their proliferation proceeds unchecked.
Counter-information, generally provided by the
power companies developing nuclear reactors,
has also been widely distributed, particularly as
these companies find more and more people
asking the worrisome questions that have, as
yet, no reassuring answers.
For most people, the result of the debate is
still confusion. The complexities of the nuclear
question often intimidate non-experts, a
situation the utility companies and the govern
ment are willing to encourage. ("Leave it to us —
we know what we're doing".)
But there are ways to overcome such intimida
tion. We all have the ability, and the obligation,
to investigate seemingly abstract aspects of the
nuclear age such as hydrogen bombs, en
hanced radiation devices, plutonium proces
sing, waste storage, radiation tolerance,
weapons proliferation, first-strike nuclear sub
marines, blowdowns, breakdowns, burnouts
and death.
Following are some questions you might be
interested in finding answers to:
— What is going to happen to the nuclear
waste? In the United States there are already 71
million gallons of high-level waste being stored
temporarily, as well as 3 000 metric tons of spent
fuel rods being stored "on site." Some of this
waste will be extremely dangerous for hundreds
of thousands of years. Government officials
have promised to guard it "for 500,000 years."
This isn't particularly reassuring.
— Is there any motive other than profit and
the desire to centralize energy that compels the
utility companies to build nuclear plants that are
dangerous, capital-intensive, technologically
unreliable and economically marginal?
