## Rape awareness increases 
### 
Do you know how many
rapes occurred last quarter on
campus? Two were reported in
the Daily, but there were 11 at
tempted and eight actual rapes
reported to the Rape Crisis
Center. No one knows how
many really occurred because
at least one-half of the women
raped do not report it, and fi
gures show one in ten women
will be raped in their lifetime.
This problem affects us all.

Although the women go
through the physical trauma, a
male friend can suffer from the
emotional repercussions too.
This information shows a
marked lack of awareness on
the campus here and points
out the importance of report
ing a rape when it occurs. The
quicker you report the rape,
the greater the chance of the
police catching the rapist.
Although we still have a long

way to go, reporting a rape is
less traumatic than it used to
be. There are women officers
available to question you, and
the questions have changed
from the "were you wearing
anything provocative at the
time you were raped?" variety
of five years ago.
Of course, a woman should
not feel guilty if she is unable to
report the rape for personal
reasons. If she wants to discuss
the problem, professional help
is available at the Rape Crisis
Center. But, by reporting the
rape to the police, she makes it
possible for them to track
down the rapist, whereas
otherwise he remains free to
rape others. The woman need
not reveal her name publicly or
press charges.
Most of you women out
there are probably saying, "It
won't happen to me," but 57
percent of all rape victims are
students. We need to be aware
of the prevalence of rape and
of at least some of the preven
tative measures, such as: carry
a light at night and a whistle at
all times; let your roommates
know where you're going and
when you'll be back; when you
leave a friend's house, arrange
to call when you get home;
take advantage of oppor
tunities open to you here such
as self-defense classes and
Rape Education meetings.
Naturally, we realize this
isn't the answer to rape. We're
dealing with the situation at
hand; we must accept rape as a
possibility.
