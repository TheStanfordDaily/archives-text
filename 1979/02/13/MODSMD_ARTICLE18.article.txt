## China 'card' played prematurely 
### 
"We do not want to become a tool of
China in its anti-Russian policy."
Adam Ulam.
A recent cartoon by Oliphant depicts
two gamblers engaged in a game of poker.
One sits casually on a wooden chair beside
a table, naked but for a single sock dangl
ing from a foot, the clothes he has wa
gered away strewn carelessly on the floor
around him. Flashing a fatuous grin, he
gazes complacently down at the table,
looking at the card he has just played.
His opponent stands directly across the
table, chair overturned behind him, chips
stacked neatly on his side, cards sneakily
tucked into his back pocket and vest. He
stands aghast, his visage drawn taut in as
tonishment, his eyes bulging in disbelief.
The card is an ace.
In this cartoon entitled "The China
Card," the incredulous loser is none other
than Communist Party Chief Brezhnev;
the smug victor is President Jimmy Carter.
Carter's announcement of normaliza
tion of relations with China had been ex
pected to produce serious repercussions.
But with the advantage of hindsight, Car
ter would have been well advised to keep
that ace hidden in his sock until the chips
had been more evenly divided between
himself and his opponent—or rather, until
SALT II had been fully negotiated, ratified
and signed. Recent diplomatic roadblocks
in the arms limitation talks are the direct
result of Carter's China policy.
Although the Soviet Union has been
long awaiting a U.S.-China rapproche
ment (indeed, long regarding it as inevita
ble), they understandably were startled by
Carter's inept timing. The inherent poten
tiality for instability in this triangular rela
tionship between the leading world pow
ers of China, the United States and them
selves, worries Russia. The Soviet Union
incessantly fears diplomatic and political
isolation through the formation of an op
posing two-power coalition. Russia dreads
the contigency of being "the odd man
out."
How can Russia help but feel like the
"odd man out" when Teng H'siao-Ping, in
his visit to the United States, publicly calls
for a dual Sino-American defensive front
against the "hegemonic" Soviet Union?

Some even speculate that the overriding
purpose of Teng's trip was not his "glori
ous quest" for modernization, but rather
his endeavor to coerce the United States
into establishing a joint anti-Soviet align
ment.
How can Russia accept a Sino-American
communique which condemns the efforts
of any global power in seeking world
domination? Only one nation in the world
save the United States occupies so impor
tant a position as to be able to exert that
much global political and military influ
ence — Russia. The joint declaration
plainly is directed toward the Soviets.
How can Russia help but be concerned
when, despite U.S. assurances that
America will never export strategic arms to
China (which are dubious in themselves),
the United States nonetheless will provide
China with all the technology requisite for
improvement of theirown extant systems?
How can Russia help but question our
sincerity when continual American sup
port of the sovereign rights of the defunct
China-backed Cambodian regime implies
the existence of another Sino-American,
anti-Soviet alignment?
How can Russia avoid the paranoiac
sense that it is being "ganged up" on when
there exists the prospect of Japan (whose
military arsenals are being secretly but
steadily built up) joining the Sino-
American entente as well; and when the
United States consolidates its air and sea
power in the Pacific and delays its prom
ised withdrawal of troops from South
Korea, ostensibly to emphasize American
military presence in Southeast Asia?
Furthermore, Russia ignores the possi
bility that we might just be expressing
support for our allies when we attempt to
reinforce conventional NATO forces in
Western Europe through a 3.1 percent real
increase in defense spending. Russia
nervously interprets this buildup as rear
mament for the purpose of future aggres
sion.
The United States should be careful not
to back Russia into a corner from which it
cannot retreat without a loss of prestige or
massive strategic retaliation. The exis
tence of Russian military and strategic
global superiority is a stark reality which

cannot easily be discounted or circum
vented.
China may be big, but she is feeble. Rus
sia is a robust superpower. A defensive
alliance of China and the United States
against Russia will furnish no appreciably
greater capability for deterrent or coercive
capability vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.
We must recall the doctrine of the Athe
nians at Melos in the Sixth century B.C.
that: "...right, as the world goes, is only in
question between equals in power, while
the strong do what they can and the weak
suffer what they must." It would be pre
cipitous, to say the least, to construct a
ramshackle alliance with China when the
potential benefits are at best tenuous.
Several policy options are available to
Carter to remedy this situation.
First, Carter must make it clear to China
that the United States is determined to
pursue a non-preferential foreign policy
towards Moscow and Peking. If the
Chinese desire to obtain American assis
tance in achieving their goal of moderniza
tion, they should refrain from issuing
anti-Soviet statements (particularly on
American soil) which could be in some
way associated with U.S. intentions or pol
icy. Given the Chinese needs for American
technology, the possibility that they will
ignore this request is slim.
Second, Carter should withdraw South
Korean troops as planned, and withdraw
support for the Cambodian regime that
has already been vanquished. He should
de-link our desire to preserve the right of
states to sovereignty in Indochina with our
ideologically contradictory support of a
repressive regime under Pol Pot.
Finally, the United States should be un
equivocal in assuring Russia that the pur
pose of increased military spending for
NATO is merely to achieve a situation of
approximate parity in conventional forces
in Western Europe, for pure defensive
purposes.
Thus with reason and foresight, America
may avoid an impending conflict between
Russia and the United States/China which
would prove disastrous for the world.

Carter's inept timing. The inherent poten
tiality for instability in this triangular rela
tionship between the leading world pow
ers of China, the United States and them
selves, worries Russia. The Soviet Union
incessantly fears diplomatic and political
isolation through the formation of an op
posing two-power coalition. Russia dreads
the contigency of being "the odd man
out."
How can Russia help but feel like the
"odd man out" when Teng H'siao-Ping, in
his visit to the United States, publicly calls
for a dual Sino-American defensive front
against the "hegemonic" Soviet Union?

Some even speculate that the overriding
purpose of Teng's trip was not his "glori
ous quest" for modernization, but rather
his endeavor to coerce the United States
into establishing a joint anti-Soviet align
ment.
How can Russia accept a Sino-American
communique which condemns the efforts
of any global power in seeking world
domination? Only one nation in the world
save the United States occupies so impor
tant a position as to be able to exert that
much global political and military influ
ence — Russia. The joint declaration
plainly is directed toward the Soviets.
How can Russia help but be concerned
when, despite U.S. assurances that
America will never export strategic arms to
China (which are dubious in themselves),
the United States nonetheless will provide
China with all the technology requisite for
improvement of theirown extant systems?
How can Russia help but question our
sincerity when continual American sup
port of the sovereign rights of the defunct
China-backed Cambodian regime implies
the existence of another Sino-American,
anti-Soviet alignment?
How can Russia avoid the paranoiac
sense that it is being "ganged up" on when
there exists the prospect of Japan (whose
military arsenals are being secretly but
steadily built up) joining the Sino-
American entente as well; and when the
United States consolidates its air and sea
power in the Pacific and delays its prom
ised withdrawal of troops from South
Korea, ostensibly to emphasize American
military presence in Southeast Asia?
Furthermore, Russia ignores the possi
bility that we might just be expressing
support for our allies when we attempt to
reinforce conventional NATO forces in
Western Europe through a 3.1 percent real
increase in defense spending. Russia
nervously interprets this buildup as rear
mament for the purpose of future aggres
sion.
The United States should be careful not
to back Russia into a corner from which it
cannot retreat without a loss of prestige or
massive strategic retaliation. The exis
tence of Russian military and strategic
global superiority is a stark reality which

cannot easily be discounted or circum
vented.
China may be big, but she is feeble. Rus
sia is a robust superpower. A defensive
alliance of China and the United States
against Russia will furnish no appreciably
greater capability for deterrent or coercive
capability vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.
We must recall the doctrine of the Athe
nians at Melos in the Sixth century B.C.
that: "...right, as the world goes, is only in
question between equals in power, while
the strong do what they can and the weak
suffer what they must." It would be pre
cipitous, to say the least, to construct a
ramshackle alliance with China when the
potential benefits are at best tenuous.
Several policy options are available to
Carter to remedy this situation.
First, Carter must make it clear to China
that the United States is determined to
pursue a non-preferential foreign policy
towards Moscow and Peking. If the
Chinese desire to obtain American assis
tance in achieving their goal of moderniza
tion, they should refrain from issuing
anti-Soviet statements (particularly on
American soil) which could be in some
way associated with U.S. intentions or pol
icy. Given the Chinese needs for American
technology, the possibility that they will
ignore this request is slim.
Second, Carter should withdraw South
Korean troops as planned, and withdraw
support for the Cambodian regime that
has already been vanquished. He should
de-link our desire to preserve the right of
states to sovereignty in Indochina with our
ideologically contradictory support of a
repressive regime under Pol Pot.
Finally, the United States should be un
equivocal in assuring Russia that the pur
pose of increased military spending for
NATO is merely to achieve a situation of
approximate parity in conventional forces
in Western Europe, for pure defensive
purposes.
Thus with reason and foresight, America
may avoid an impending conflict between
Russia and the United States/China which
would prove disastrous for the world.

A recent cartoon by Oliphant depicts
two gamblers engaged in a game of poker.
One sits casually on a wooden chair beside
a table, naked but for a single sock dangl
ing from a foot, the clothes he has wa
gered away strewn carelessly on the floor
around him. Flashing a fatuous grin, he
gazes complacently down at the table,
looking at the card he has just played.
His opponent stands directly across the
table, chair overturned behind him, chips
stacked neatly on his side, cards sneakily
tucked into his back pocket and vest. He
stands aghast, his visage drawn taut in as
tonishment, his eyes bulging in disbelief.
The card is an ace.
In this cartoon entitled "The China
Card," the incredulous loser is none other
than Communist Party Chief Brezhnev;
the smug victor is President Jimmy Carter.
Carter's announcement of normaliza
tion of relations with China had been ex
pected to produce serious repercussions.
But with the advantage of hindsight, Car
ter would have been well advised to keep
that ace hidden in his sock until the chips
had been more evenly divided between
himself and his opponent—or rather, until
SALT II had been fully negotiated, ratified
and signed. Recent diplomatic roadblocks
in the arms limitation talks are the direct
result of Carter's China policy.
Although the Soviet Union has been
long awaiting a U.S.-China rapproche
ment (indeed, long regarding it as inevita
ble), they understandably were startled by
