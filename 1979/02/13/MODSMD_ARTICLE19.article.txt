that the Daily and the entire
campus community will join
with them in supporting the
nationwide boycott of Coors
beer.
The struggle by the Brewery
Workers is a basic struggle for
human dignity. And the
boycott of Coors products, like
the farm workers' boycotts of
years past, is a nonviolent ap
peal by working men and
women whose courage and
sacrifice have been a source of
inspiration to us all.
Coors' notorious violations
of human rights is unpre
cedented in U.S. labor history:
its use of polygraph tests to pry
into the personal lives of its
employees; its unreasonable
searches and seizures of work
ers at the plant; its support for
the most extreme right-wing
causes, including the John
Birch Society, STOP ERA, the
Right-to-Work Committee
and other groups.
So many at Stanford gave
their unselfish support to the
farm workers; we ask that you
also support the Coors boycott
until justice is done.

Just decision
Congratulations to the
Honor Code Committee for
their recent decision concern
ing medical excuses (Daily,
Jan. 22). The professors were
taking "unusual and un
reasonable" precautions to
prevent a student from evading

an exam. In effect, the profes
sors were saying "We don't
trust you," an attitude which is
inconsistent with the princi
ples of the Honor Code.
This decision will probably
engender some new attitudes
within the student body. In
stead of looking at exams as a
requirement, students will
look at them as a responsibil
ity.
Now, if a student wants to
unjustly avoid a test, he will
have to lie to the face of the
professor, which for almost
anybody is a hard thing to do.
I predict that the number of
absences from exams due to
health reasons will fall consid
erably because instead of fak
ing an illness, which is easy,
students must lie, which for
most people is hard. The old
requirement for medical ex
cuses did not discourage irres
ponsible behavior.
Outside of college, we will
all face many responsibilities
which are both distasteful and
unavoidable. If the University
is a place for training leaders
and teaching responsibility,
the Honor Code Committee
decision is a step towards that
goal.

Carter clan
defended
I find it impossible not to re
spond to Jack Trumpbour's
column "Carter clan incom
parable" (Daily, Feb. 5).
Trumpbour has committed the
worst sin of political analysis —
accepting the superficial as a
measure of the real.
In his column, Trumpbour

dismisses the president be
cause of his choice of a baby
sitter for Amy. This does vio
lence to the principles of ob
jective and rigorous analysis
for which every political com
mentator is responsible.
Trumpbour would have his
readers believe that )immy Car
ter is unfit for office for the fol
lowing reasons:
— Rosalynn Carter once
shook hands with a Chicago
ward leader, later discovered
to be a mass-murderer.
— Jimmy's sister, Ruth Car
ter Stapleton, associates with
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt.
Trumpbour has forgotten
Christ's rejoinder to the
Pharisees who questioned the
moral standing of His as
sociates: "I have come not to
save the virtuous, but the sin
ners.")
— The president's brother
Billy is a "beer-chugging nean
derthal." (Why does America
take Billy Carter so seriously?
He was not elected president,
Jimmy was.)
— The president opposes
the Soviet-backed invasion of
Cambodia, therefore tacitly
supporting the Pol Pot regime.
(While Cambodians slaughter
ing Cambodians is despicable,
Vietnamese slaughtering
Cambodians is worse.)
— Carter is a liar because
Lester Maddox says so. (Slan
der from axe-handle Maddox
does not represent effective
character assassination.)
Trumpbour's naive concerns
about superficial conduct have
blinded him to the realities of
American politics. Meaning
less revelations about the
habits and associations of our
public heroes should encour
age us to look behind the sup

erficial, and not reduce us to
sloppy breakfast-table cyni
cism.
While Trumpbour so care
fully studies the sensational
quirks of the First Family, Car
ter is keeping most of his cam
paign promises:
— defending human rights;
— launching a comprehen
sive energy plan;
— signing a Panama Canal
treaty;
— seeking government
reorganization;
— giving broader represen
tation to women and
minorities in the Executive
Branch and
— bringing the Middle East
closer to peace.
Unfortunately, most news
papers neglect the issues and
focus attention on the shock
ing and bizarre in the Carter
administration. Therefore, the
political analyst should redou
ble his efforts to understand
and accept the direction and
circumstances of Washington
affairs. We should not dismiss
our leaders as Trumpbour
does for their surface incon
sistencies. They are not pure
heroes of a mythical age, but
human beings of varied vision
and ability.

that the Daily and the entire
campus community will join
with them in supporting the
nationwide boycott of Coors
beer.
The struggle by the Brewery
Workers is a basic struggle for
human dignity. And the
boycott of Coors products, like
the farm workers' boycotts of
years past, is a nonviolent ap
peal by working men and
women whose courage and
sacrifice have been a source of
inspiration to us all.
Coors' notorious violations
of human rights is unpre
cedented in U.S. labor history:
its use of polygraph tests to pry
into the personal lives of its
employees; its unreasonable
searches and seizures of work
ers at the plant; its support for
the most extreme right-wing
causes, including the John
Birch Society, STOP ERA, the
Right-to-Work Committee
and other groups.
So many at Stanford gave
their unselfish support to the
farm workers; we ask that you
also support the Coors boycott
until justice is done.

Just decision
Congratulations to the
Honor Code Committee for
their recent decision concern
ing medical excuses (Daily,
Jan. 22). The professors were
taking "unusual and un
reasonable" precautions to
prevent a student from evading

an exam. In effect, the profes
sors were saying "We don't
trust you," an attitude which is
inconsistent with the princi
ples of the Honor Code.
This decision will probably
engender some new attitudes
within the student body. In
stead of looking at exams as a
requirement, students will
look at them as a responsibil
ity.
Now, if a student wants to
unjustly avoid a test, he will
have to lie to the face of the
professor, which for almost
anybody is a hard thing to do.
I predict that the number of
absences from exams due to
health reasons will fall consid
erably because instead of fak
ing an illness, which is easy,
students must lie, which for
most people is hard. The old
requirement for medical ex
cuses did not discourage irres
ponsible behavior.
Outside of college, we will
all face many responsibilities
which are both distasteful and
unavoidable. If the University
is a place for training leaders
and teaching responsibility,
the Honor Code Committee
decision is a step towards that
goal.

Carter clan

I find it impossible not to re
spond to Jack Trumpbour's
column "Carter clan incom
parable" (Daily, Feb. 5).
Trumpbour has committed the
worst sin of political analysis —
accepting the superficial as a
measure of the real.
In his column, Trumpbour

dismisses the president be
cause of his choice of a baby
sitter for Amy. This does vio
lence to the principles of ob
jective and rigorous analysis
for which every political com
mentator is responsible.
Trumpbour would have his
readers believe that )immy Car
ter is unfit for office for the fol
lowing reasons:
— Rosalynn Carter once
shook hands with a Chicago
ward leader, later discovered
to be a mass-murderer.
— Jimmy's sister, Ruth Car
ter Stapleton, associates with
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt.
Trumpbour has forgotten
Christ's rejoinder to the
Pharisees who questioned the
moral standing of His as
sociates: "I have come not to
save the virtuous, but the sin
ners.")
— The president's brother
Billy is a "beer-chugging nean
derthal." (Why does America
take Billy Carter so seriously?
He was not elected president,
Jimmy was.)
— The president opposes
the Soviet-backed invasion of
Cambodia, therefore tacitly
supporting the Pol Pot regime.
(While Cambodians slaughter
ing Cambodians is despicable,
Vietnamese slaughtering
Cambodians is worse.)
— Carter is a liar because
Lester Maddox says so. (Slan
der from axe-handle Maddox
does not represent effective
character assassination.)
Trumpbour's naive concerns
about superficial conduct have
blinded him to the realities of
American politics. Meaning
less revelations about the
habits and associations of our
public heroes should encour
age us to look behind the sup

erficial, and not reduce us to
sloppy breakfast-table cyni
cism.
While Trumpbour so care
fully studies the sensational
quirks of the First Family, Car
ter is keeping most of his cam
paign promises:
— defending human rights;
— launching a comprehen
sive energy plan;
— signing a Panama Canal
treaty;
— seeking government
reorganization;
— giving broader represen
tation to women and
minorities in the Executive
Branch and
— bringing the Middle East
closer to peace.
Unfortunately, most news
papers neglect the issues and
focus attention on the shock
ing and bizarre in the Carter
administration. Therefore, the
political analyst should redou
ble his efforts to understand
and accept the direction and
circumstances of Washington
affairs. We should not dismiss
