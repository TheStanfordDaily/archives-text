# Lyman letter answers Title IX query
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
Colleges with major football prog
rams should be allowed three years
to comply with the financial aid pro
visions of Title IX regulations, Presi
dent Richard Lyman said in a letter
last Thursday to Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW) Joseph
Califano.
The financial aid provisions, as in
terpreted by the Office of Civil Rights
(OCR), require equal expenditures
per athletic participant in order to be
in compliance with Title IX. The OCR
decision also included a requirement
that compliance be reached by Sep
tember, 1979.
In the letter, which Lyman wrote in
response to an HEW request for
feedback on the Title IX issue, Lyman
disagreed with the view held by the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion (NCAA). The NCAA argues that
the federal government should have
no jurisdiction over programs such
as intercollegiate sports that it does
not fund directly.
The suggestions put forth in Ly
man's letter were agreed upon after
Lyman met with a committee consist
ing of Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
Vice President for Public Affairs Bob
Rosenzweig, Registrar Sally
Mahoney and Assoc.. University
Counsel Iris Brest, Geiger con
firmed.
Geiger stressed, however, that
Lyman's letter was merely a response
to the HEW request and "has no
bearing on Stanford athletic policy."

Lyman noted in the letter that "this
issue has already been so clouded
with ideological disputes that we are
in great danger of losing sight of the
twin facts that women have rights
and universities have problems and
that both must be accommodated in
a world that is only too full of reality."
In the letter, Lyman said that for
the University to be in compliance
with the provisions, additional finan
cial aid for women amounting to be
tween $300,000 and $350,000 would
have to be found.
According to Lyman, there are only
two places in the Athletic Dept.
budget in which cuts could be made
to provide the necessary funds. The
first area is in the support given to
men's sports other than football; the
second is in what Lyman termed "the
expensive but deferrable provisions
of the (Title IX) Guidelines that are
designed to bring the substance of
women's programs up to the level of
men's.
"There is no other possibility, and
both of these strike us as self
defeating whether viewed in terms of
education or sex equity," Lyman
stated.
Two reasons
Lyman gave two reasons why foot
ball should be treated separately: the
large size of the squad required to
compete and"the universal practice
by major colleges of offering virtually
all participants full scholarships.
Lyman emphasized that Stanford
has argued, unsuccessfully, to the

NCAA that football scholarships — as
well as all athletic scholarships — be
based upon need. But, he said in the
letter, "the fact is that football re
mains as described, and it apparently
will remain that way for the forsee
able future. We must try to deal intel
ligently with that fact...
"It is not Stanford's position that
football, or any other sport, should
be beyond the reach of Title IX,"
Lyman said. "We see no basis for
such a contention in law or as a mat
ter of policy. However, we do see,
and urge the OCR to recognize, that
the way in which intercollegiate
football is conducted in America
makes it different in two key respects
from any other sport."
Football's uniqueness
Lyman offered two possible solu
tions for dealing with the problems
raised by the Title IX financial aid
provisions and the related problem
of football's uniqueness in college
athletics.
Emphasizing that "reasonable
people might differ (on the precise
figures)," Lyman suggested that a 25
percent cut in expenditures for foot
ball might offer universities a "cush
ion" which could be used for neces
sary adjustments in other parts of the
institution's athletic program.
Dealing with a more short-term
problem — specifically, the sudden
ness with which institutions must
make adjustments ; n order tocomply
with Title IX — Lyman proposed that
compliance with the financial aid
provisions be spread over a three
year period.
"We propose that each institution
determine the amount required (in
current dollars) to reach compliance
and that in the first year, de facto
compliance will consist of reaching
40 percent of that incremental
amount, Lyman said.
Three years for compliance
Lyman noted that in the second
year, an additional 30 percent of the
total would be required and by the
third year, all institutions would be
required to be in full compliance.
"In our view," Lyman concluded,
"the debate over Title IX has suffered
from what has seemed at times to be
virtually a war between competing
ideologies. Stanford does not wish to

be a combatant. Instead, we prefer to
devote our energies and resources
to building the best athletic programs
of which we are capable, for women
and for men.
"The government can make it har
der for us to do that, or easier. The
suggestions we have made are de
signed to make it easier. They are
practical, not theoretical or ideologi
cal . That seems by far the best way to
deal with these thorny issues, and we
hope that OCR will agree."
