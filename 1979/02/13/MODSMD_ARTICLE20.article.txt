## classical music/john angel Some classic "grab bags" 
### 
Bach: Selections from the Anna Magdalena
Notebook
Elly Ameling, soprano. Gustav Leonhardt,
harpsichord.
Quintessence
Schubert: Songs and Piano Music
Elly Ameling. Jorg Demus, piano.
Quintessence
These Ameling recordings, on a "budget"
reissue label here, were among the first in the
pioneering Harmonia Mundi series; they
created quite a stir, especially the Schubert,
which garnered the Grand Prix du Disque and
Edison awards.
Both records are "grab bags" showing the
kind of music the composers liked to have
performed in their own homes. The Bach col
lection is a mixture of serious and light
hearted works, but it hangs together pretty
well. Even the simple keyboard solos come
across so gracefully in Leonhardt's hands as to
dispell memories of beginning piano study —
well, almost completely at least.
My admiration for the Schubert record is
unreserved. It's almost all songs, the most
striking of which is "Shepherd on the Rock,"
the last the composer wrote before his death.
Demus accompanies all beautifully on a
Rausch hammerflugel made in 1835 (the ear
soon adjusts). Since this disc even comes with
English translations this time around, you
miss it at your own peril!

Baroque Violin Concertos.
Pinchas Zukerman, violin and conductor.
Members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
Columbia
As he did a few years back with a record of
viola concertos, Zukerman again sets out to
plug some gaps in the catalog. Some of these
pieces have been neglected on LP because
they won't fill up a record or even a side;
Zukerman's dodge is to gather them all to
gether, and so we have four so-called baroque
concertos here.
This offers the only current recording of
Nardini's concerto in E minor, beloved of the
Elman — Zimbalist — Kreisler generation. It's
really a classical work, with Zukerman's beaut
ifully romantic playing stressing the forward
looking elements here.
Then we have Leclair's C major concerto,
which puts us in an older world stylistically
but is more difficult technically. It too is well
worth having on record, and Zukerman is just
the man for the job.
The other two concertos are by Vivaldi and
have already been included in other sets
(though with Vivaldi few of us would notice if
they hadn't). Even so, I would set these per
formances up against any. Both recording and
pressing of this record are a distinct cut above
the usual U.S. production too.
