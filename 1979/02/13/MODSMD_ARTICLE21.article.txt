## Crichton leaves a fake gloss 
### 
It's easy enough to call
The Great Train Robbery a
"classy entertainment,"
much like Herb Ross' The
Seven-Per-Cent Solution or
Sidney Lumet's Murder on
the Orient Express, where
our love of old movie values
began to show up as the
starting point of new
movies. While there's a lot
to sustain us in all three
films, we aren't taken all the
way because nothing is
added to the nostalgia — it's
just exploited.
Michael Crichton wrote
and directed The Great Train
Robbery; he also wrote the
novel upon which it is
based. Crichton gained his
initial success with his
science-related books (The
Andromeda Strain) and
movies (Westworld, Coma);
he creates sketches, not
characters, and he knows a
lot about tight pacing and
narrative drive. That's why
he's so good with science
thrillers, but he slows every
thing down here because
he's got a story line set in
1855 England and produc

tion values to worry about.
But Crichton is nothing if
not ingenious, and he hides
often awkward pacing with
a well constructed plot.
Sean Connery, joined by
Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down, is out to
rob Britain's gold shipment
to the soldiers in the Crimea
—from a moving train,
never before attempted. To
accomplish this feat, the
group must make copies of
each of the four keys
needed to open the safe
containing the gold.
Crichton stages his small
thefts leading the big theft
with assurance and skill;
he's an effective director in
the sense that he can keep
juggling the three or four
things he does well indefi
nitely. And he's not too
overtabout it, which is wise,
because suspense of the
"will he make it?" variety —
which the movie relies heav
ily on — can lose its tension
early on if you're too loud
about it.
But in the end, the classi
ness Crichton tries for ends

up as fake gloss rather than
real sparkle. And techni
cally, it's a mixed bag; the
late cinematographer Geof
frey Unsworth (who also did
Orient Express) adds to the
gloss with impeccable cam
era work — he could shoot
trains in his sleep, I think —
and Jerry Goldsmith de
tracts from it with his typi
cally empty high style music
that the Dolby stereo blasts
out in futility.
The style of writing
Crichton employs limits
what his actors can do, but
sometimes they'll save him
through sheer force of per
sonality, as Genevieve
Bujold did in Coma. Vou
cared about Bujold in
stantly, and she was the
emotional center of what
could have been an ex
tremely cold thriller.
Here, the focus is blur
red; only Sean Connery
rises above the outline he
plays, even if it is only with a
grin and a few leers.
Crichton has made Con
nery's character deliber
ately mysterious, but it's

more of a front than any
thing else; the movie never
has much fun with the Con
nery character's extremely
ambiguous background.
Donald Sutherland never
really gets past his attempts
at an accent, and Lesley-
Anne Down plays the same
old lovely accessory she al
ways plays, but with more
lines this time (which is ap
parently enough to con
vince some people that
Down is a scene stealer).
But the fake gloss of this
movie is vaguely familiar:
it's stuck hazily in many
people's minds as the way
those "great old movies"
used to be like. And the feel
ing the movie gives you is
pleasant enough, but it
doesn't give you anything
else. The flash, the pure
movie enjoyment, is missed
here. It's as if all Crichton
worked for was photo
graphy, plot, and a beautiful
woman.
And while I'd like to think
that Michael Crichton is not
a hack, that's essentially a
hack's mentality.
