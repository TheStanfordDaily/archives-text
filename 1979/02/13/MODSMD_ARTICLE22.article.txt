## Good-time without the twang: 
### 
Every Texan in the Bay
Area must have been in at
tendance at Saturday's
sold-out Willie Nelson-|erry
Jeff Walker concert at
Maple's Pavilion for what
was certainly a unique type
of concert.
In presentation and style,
the concert left the 8500
concertgoers completely
pleased with the very suc
cessful show sponsored by
ASSU Special Events.

Nelson in recent months
has been playing the smal
ler, but very protitable and
older audiences in Las
Vegas and Reno-Lake
Tahoe.
Saturday, though, a mix
ture of middle aged adults
down to young teenagers
crammed Maples to cheer
on this overnight sensation
of country and popular
music.
Nelson, 45, traces his
home back to Austin, Texas
and that was certainly evi

dent by pre-concert crowd
antics. There was the wav
ing of the Texas State and
Confederate flags, the
cheering of a stuffed ar
madillo and the banner
reading, "Long Live Willie
Nelson, Texas Chillie and
Lone Star Beer."
Saturday's audience was
lacking in one surprising re
spect — very few Stanford
students were ticket buyers.
Instead, the crowd was

primarily Bay Area
country-western fans out
fora fun-loving evening that
Nelson and Walker pro
vided.
Apparently very few stu
dents were aware of the
wide ranging appeal that
both artists have developed
in the past couple of years.
Their music is the type that
can be enjoyed by country
as well as rock fans.
Lacking in their music is
the famous country twang.
Instead, both artists provide

a variety of fast-moving *
songs and ballads. Yet what *
is their distinguishing fea- *
ture is the good-time and +
thoughtful lyrics. *
Nelson performed a re- *
pertoireof songs that can be *
found on the Willieand fam- *
ily album Live released last *
year as well as ballads from
his acclaimed Stardust al
bum.
Such hits as "Whisky
River," "Mommas Don't Let +
Your Babies Crow Up to Be *
Cowboys," "Blue Eyes Cry- *
ing in the Rain," and "Ceor- »
gia on My Mind" brought *
the crowd to their feet in *
well-deserved cheers for *
the 1% hour performance. *
Willie's style of thought- *
ful expression and crisp, *
clear voice made his first *
encore, a solo of "Singin' *
My Song for You" perfect. *
The concert was off toa .
fast start with the warm re- +
ception Walker received in
his 70-minute performance.
On just the second song, *
"Red Neck Mother," the *
basketball floor was bounc- +
ing away from the respon- *
sive crowd. And that inten- *
sitv continued throughout *
his set. The lyrics "I wanna *
go home baby armadillo" *
brought immediate yells of *
approval from Texas fans. *
Walker was brought back *
for an encore, but it lacked *
the force his earlier songs *
had. Maybe it was the dis- *
appointment that a former
Walker hit, "Pissin' in the
Wind" was not presented +
during the evening. *
