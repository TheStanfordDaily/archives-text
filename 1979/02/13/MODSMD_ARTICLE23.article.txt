Greatest Hits
Barry Manilow
Arista
I wouldn't be surprised if, say, 10 years from now, Barry
Manilow is regarded as an inconsequential exponent of 70s
pop, much the sameas such '60s emissaries asTheTurtles, the
Partridge Family and Three Dog Night are regarded today.
W! ich is not to attack Barry Manilow. He has never claimed
to be more than what he is: a passably talented musician with a
knack for pleasant, sometimes overblown, songs. Leave anger
and protest to Springsteen, experimentalism to Eno, and prog
ressiveness to Yes. Barry Manilow willcontinue to crank out
the hits, thank you.
On Barry Manilow's Greatest Hits, we get a large sampling of
Manilow's more popular material, from his first hit, "Mandy,
to his most recent, "Somewhere in the Night." judging by the
songwriting credits, we must attribute Manilow's success
more to his abilities as an arranger and producer than as a
writer. Most of Manilow's biggest hits, inciuding "I Write the
Songs," "Weekend in New England," and "Tryin' to Get the
Feeling," as well as the two previously mentioned, are not self
penned. Which is as much an attribute of Manilow's as a
discredit. Manilow is one of the few people in pop music who
knows his limitations, due both to style and vocal abilities, and
can thus wisely choose material.
It is when Manilow sings his own songs that he sounds
weakest. His innocuous writing may have been fine for com
mercial jingles, but it quickly shows its weaknesses in Man
ilow's'real'songs. "This One's for You,' "It's a Miracle, and
"Beautiful Music" all typify Manilow's bland style of writing.
That Manilow can shine on his self-written songs is occa
sionally demonstrated, though, most notably (on this album)
on "All the Time" and, to a lesser extent, "Even Now." On
these songs, Manilow seems to penetrate the barrier to emo
tion which appears to attach itself to many of Manilow's songs.
These songs could be done better (Helen Schneider does an
excellent version of "All the Time" on her first album), but
make pleasant, enjoyable pop listening, all the same.
Now don't get me wrong. I wouldn't buy this album. It reeks
of the overplayed commercialism of most artists who have
become AM mainstays. From the standpoint of true merit, few
of the songs bear repeated listenings over a long period of
time. These songs extend the position of recent Billy )oel to an
even more commercial extreme, bringing them to a position
where they exist entirely for the purpose of mass appeal.
So maybe Manilow is an artist without a soul; a craftsman
who has sold his integrity for appeal. But more possibly he is
the necessary product of the tastes of mass America. And, if
this is so, he's as good as he can be at what he does.
