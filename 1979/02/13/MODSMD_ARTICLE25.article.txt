## The 						Juilliard sound: cool and focused 
### 
Stanford audiences im
mediately compare any visiting
string quartet to the Lively Arts'
"Quartet-in-Residence," the
Cuarneri; so my comments on
the recent visit of the Juilliard
Quartet begin there. The com
parison is, however, more dif
ficult to make than it seems,
because these two groups strive
for dissimilar goals.
These differences have his
torical roots. The Juilliard was
founded in 1946, 21 years be
fore the Cuarneri. In those
days, the era of Toscanini,
American quartets styled
themselves in a certain man
ner. Fast, crisp, electric playing
was the norm, with the
Budapest Quartet the out
standing example. A slower,
broader and warmer style was
left to European quartets.
While European groups like
the Melos and Amadeus Quar
tets maintain this tradition, in
recent years some American
ensembles have acquired
"European" tendencies; the
Cuarneri — with a large dose of
extroverted '70s America,
superadded — is a prime
example. Among new Ameri
can groups, the Cleveland
Quartet comes closest to the
old style.
This fundamental dichotomy
— dividing, from another
perspective, Classic from
Romantic interpretations — is
mirrored in the distinctive

conducting styles of Arturo
Toscanini and Carlo Maria
Ciulini. The Cuarneri and the
Juilliard strive for different
goals and must be judged on
different scales. The criticism
voiced by several audience
members last weekend — that
the Juilliard sound wasn't big
enough — is thus misapplied.
The Guarneri sound is ex
pansive and full, the Juilliard's
sharp, cool, and focused. In
fast sections, the Juilliard st
rives for taut excitement and
vital momentum, the Cuarneri
seeks the power of overwhelm
ing sound. In slower sections,
the Guarneri tends toward the
dramatic, while the Juilliard
seems to prefer the lyric. Al
though the Juilliard sound has
warmed some in the past de
cade, both groups have re
mained largely consistent
throughout their careers.
As listeners, we should ask
ourselves: to what extent did
the group realize its goals? To
what extent did it fulfill its na
ture? The differences between
the two styles, though interest
ing, are eternal and unresolva
ble.
The Juilliard, in order to at
tain these goals, had to fight
two endemic weaknesses.
First, violinist Robert Mann
periodically experienced trou
ble producing a clear firm
tone, especially toward the
dynamic extremes. A heavy

vibrato-combined with light
bowing that skated over the
strings rather than digging into
them — occasionally sounded
a weak, scratchy or wobbly
tone or eliminated a note to
tally. This was especially preva
lent on the e-string, and was
combined with periodic into
nation problems there.
Perhaps this was related to his
unorthodox method of hold
ing the bow: three inches up
from the end rather than at the
end. The problem was most
obvious during the Schubert
program (the fourth variation
on the "Tod und das Mad
chen" was a mess) disappear
ing almost totally as Mann
warmed up to the Beethoven
program.
Guarneri fans should not
gloat, however; Steinhardt
faced the same problem during
that group's latest visit. And
Mann, as the emotional
catalyst of the Juilliard, takes
risks in his dashing style, and it
is to be expected that some will
not pay off. Also the acoustics
of Dinkelspiel Auditorium
have never been kind to vio
linists.
The second problem was a
slight roughness of blend and
laxity in rhythm. This was also
most noticeable Friday, early in
the concert, and was gone for
good by the Beethoven prog
ram Sunday. These weaknes
ses were manifest in a lack of

intensity most noticeable in the
Quartetsatz (a rough piece to
open a concert with, as the
Cuarneri found out on their
recent visit) and the opening
Allegro of Schubert's D minor
(Quartet. Earl Carlyss's weak
tone and Joel Krosnick's
rhythmic laxity were the most
persistent offenses. Only
Mann is an original member of
the group, and although all are
at the Juilliard School of Music,
Rhodes and krosnick have
played with the quartet for only
a few years. It is perhaps unfair
to compare records with live
performances, but I found that
in the earlier recordings of
these Schubert works, the en
semble was tighter.
But when these problems
were overcome, as they were
for some of the Schubert prog
ram and all of the Beethoven,
the results were magnificent.
These are extremely intelligent
musicians. They are constantly
aware of every facet of their
playing, varying the warmth,
volume and bowing of each
note to create exactly the effect
they seek. This total musician
ship allows them a flexibility
and subtlety of phrasing that
amazed and moved the audi
ence. They tune up their in
struments at every opportun
ity. These two concerts, one of
Schubert and one of Beeth
oven, exhibited the myriad
facets of the Julliard's genius.

The first statement of the
Death and the Maiden theme,
for example, began as a feath
eryand/egafo pianissimo, built
to a lyric climax of both volume
and warmth (vibrato) and then
returned for an even softer re
peat. Deeply moving. In
Schubert's A minor Quartet
they moved from a quick and
light interpretation of the
opening Allegro to a silky
sweet Andante enhanced by
gentle slides, rather than a
clean and dry shift of position.
The black and humorless
scherzo achieved the perfect
Juilliard effect: poignancy
without overt emotionality,
aptly conveying the ambiguity
of the youthful depression that
plagued Schubert as he wrote
the work.
I felt that the first and third
movements of the Schubert
Death and the Maiden Quartet
were weak, without the ac
cented sound that the score

demands. The final Presto was
clean and exciting.
But the Beethoven afternoon
was the highlight of the Juil
liard's visit. They played the
Quartet Op. 18, No. 7 with just
the relaxed intensity it needed.
The ensemble, after the first
exposition, was perfect, and
Mann, with the exception of
three measures in the Scherzo,
never lost his concentration.
The Beethoven Quartet Op.
132 was simply magnificent.
The Juilliard's rendition of the
constantly unfolding, even
building tension of the open
ing Allegro climaxing in the
shattering coda left the audi
ence breathless. The second
movement was slightly rushed,
encouraging the quartet to
skim over important phrasing,
dynamic, and rhythmic mark
ings. The entire work abounds
with the conflicting emotions
that characterize late Beeth

oven quartets, each reflected
in constantly variable tempo,
dynamic and key. The juilliard
expressed each nuance of this
great work, playing with every
last bit of energy they had.
Perhaps the most amazing
thing about the Juilliard is first
violinist Robert Mann. A chair
and suit can hardly constrain
his expressive motions and
playing, which energize and
direct the entire group. I asked
him after the concert how long
he'd been with the group.
"Thirty-three years," he
answered, "since 1946 when
the Juilliard was founded. I
suppose most people retire
after so long," but he added
with a laugh, "I guess I have at
least a few more years left."
The Juilliard had not been to
Stanford in six years, due to
politics within Lively Arts. They
would like to return and de
serve a return invitation as
soon as possible.
