Iranian consulate occupied
San Francisco— Student supporters of the new
government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took
over the offices of the Iranian Consulate yesterday
and replaced pictures of the shah with those of the
78-year-old Shiite Moslem patriarch.
"We are here to supervise the affairs of the con
sulate in the transitional period," said Motjabe
Mahzoon on the first day after the fall of the shah
appointed government in Iran. "This consulate
officially belongs to the people of the Islamic Re
public of Iran," he said.
The turning point in the 13-month-old Iranian
crisis came Sunday when Khomeini forces crushed
the last st«nd of Iran's constitutional monarchy
headed by Shahpour Bakhtiar.
"We are very happy that finally the struggle of
the people has come to a success and the Ayatol
lah's government has been established in the
country. This is a government that has been
elected by the people," Mahzoon said.
Mahzoon said he and Mohammad Ayatollabi
were designated by Dr. jalil Zarrabi, chief of the
Khomeini delegation in the United States, to over
see consular affairs. He said about eight or nine
other students, all part of a Moslem student as
sociation, will assist.
Mahzoon, a University of California graduate
student in mechanical engineering, said the group
of about 50 Iranian students arrived at the consu
late and were welcomed by the Consul-General
Manootchehr Ardalan.
Mahzoon said Ardalan had been recalled to
Iran.
"They, the consulate, have not shown any major
objection to our cause," Mahzoon said. He said
the new consular group was awaiting further word
from Medhi Bazargan, prime minister of Kho
meini's provisional government.
Rhodesian airliner shot down
Salisbury, Rhodesia — A Rhodesian airliner that
crashed on takeoff yesterday, killing all 59 persons
aboard, probably was shot down by black
nationalist guerrillas, military and airline sources
said.
"We haven't gathered exact evidence yet, but
everything points to this being another strike by
terrorist ground fire," one airline source said.
Last Sept. 3, guerrillas claimed responsibility for
shooting down another Air Rhodesia plane with a
Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air, heat-seeking
missile. That plane also went down shortly after
taking off from Kariba and 48 persons were killed,
including 10 survivors slain on the ground by guer
rillas. Eight persons escaped alive.
Both planes were four-engine turboprop Vis
counts.
The blue-and-white airliner took off smoothly
yesterday from Kariba, on the border with Zambia,
bound for Salisbury, 200 miles to the Southeast.
But some six minutes later a distress call was

made and it crashed. Air Rhodesia later issued this
terse announcement:
"Air Rhodesia regrets to announce the loss of a
Viscount aircraft operating flight RHB27 between
Kariba and Salisbury."
Army troops reached the site of the wreckage
and found no survivors, airline officials said.
The first indication at Kariba airport that Flight
827 was missing came when passengers, on an Air
Rhodesia Viscount that took off 15 minutes later
for Salisbury saw three camouflaged soldiers rush
ing toward a police spotter plane.
The downed airliner carried men, women and
children, mostly people on holiday who had spent
the weekend at Kariba, which features a casino
and excellent fishing on Kariba Lake.
Farm worker walkout grows
El Centro — Harvesting of nearly all of the na
tion's winter lettuce was halted yesterday as an
estimated 7000 farm workers staged an unex
pected one-day work stoppage to mourn a United
Farm Worker's (UFW) union member slain during
a bitter 3'/2-week-old strike.
The one-day walkout, which affected 30 grow
ers, came in the midst of a strike by 4200 UFW
members against 10 majorgrowers and shippers in
California and Arizona who account for about 40
percent of the nation's winter lettuce.
The work stoppage occurred two days after
UFW striker Rufino Contreras, 28, was shot to
death during a confrontation at a farm outside
Holtville. To defuse tensions, Chavez on Sunday
ordered an end to all picketing until Contreras is
buried and called for a general work stoppage on
the day of the funeral, probably tomorrow or
Thursday.
Chavez said he urged the workers to return to
their jobs today at farms that are not targets of the
strike.
Contreras was among 15 striking workers who
entered a field where replacement workers are
picking lettuce. Three men — two farm fore
men and a replacement worker — have been
booked for investigation of murder.
Acting Gov. Mike Curb said there were no plans
to act on the growers' request to call in the
California National Guard to keep order in the
24-day-old strike.
Grower Tom Hubbard said the growers not only
plan to shut down all operations on the day of the
funeral, but have requested that the nation's let
tuce industry call a halt to honor the worker.
Gov't budget amendment urged
New York — Americans overwhelmingly favor a
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced
federal budget because they don't trust politicians
to put a lid on government spending, an As
sociated Press-NBC News poll shows.

The public, weary of continuing inflation which
they blame in part on deficit spending, says cutting
waste in the federal bureaucracy would save
enough money to balance the half-trillion-dollar
budget.
But Americans' distrust of politicians is so deep
that they don't believe their elected officials will
act. Thus, they are split over whether the deficit
actually could be wiped out in the next few years.
The AP-NBC News poll found 70 percent of
those interviewed Feb. 5 and 6 favor a budget
balancing amendment. Eighteen percent opposed
such a move, and 12 percent were not sure.
Despite the high level of support, Americans
don't think their elected officials will actually ac
complish the balancing act.
Only one in four said politicians will work to
balance the budget. Seventy percent said politi
cians will not work to wipe out the deficit. Six
percent of the 1600 adults interviewed were not
sure.
Study criticizes Peace Corps
Washington — The Peace Corps fails to
adequately screen volunteers, with some candi
dates being interviewed by telephone and others
not at all, according to a new study by the General
Accounting Office (GAO).
The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, also
said the overseas volunteer service fails to give
adequate information to volunteers about the
conditions under which they are expected to live.
One costly result has been that "many volun
teers are terminating service before scheduled
completion —frequently within the first months of
service," said the report.
And the Peace Corps' personnel turnover rate
was three times as high as that of other federal
agencies, the study noted, in part because the
corps limits the time its staff members can serve.
The study was conducted of the Peace Corps
office in Washington and its operations in Colom
bia, Honduras, Malaysia, Afghanistan and Kenya.
Responses were sought from volunteers in those
countries from July to September 1977.
Stocks climb 2.51
New York — The Dow Jones average of 30 in
dustrials, off more than 3 points at the outset,
showed a 2.51 gain at 824.84 by the close yester
day.
Losers just barely nosed out gainers in the
over-all count on the New York Stock Exchange.
Today's weather
Rain today, heavy at times. Showers likely to
night. Partly cloudy tomorrow with chance of
showers. Cooler today with lows in the upper 40s
to mid 50s, highs in the 50s. Gale warning for
southerly winds 25 to 40 mph decreasing today.
Chance of rain 80 percent today and 60 percent
tonight.

country. This is a government that has been
elected by the people," Mahzoon said.
Mahzoon said he and Mohammad Ayatollabi
were designated by Dr. jalil Zarrabi, chief of the
Khomeini delegation in the United States, to over
see consular affairs. He said about eight or nine
other students, all part of a Moslem student as
sociation, will assist.
Mahzoon, a University of California graduate
student in mechanical engineering, said the group
of about 50 Iranian students arrived at the consu
late and were welcomed by the Consul-General
Manootchehr Ardalan.
Mahzoon said Ardalan had been recalled to
Iran.
"They, the consulate, have not shown any major
objection to our cause," Mahzoon said. He said
the new consular group was awaiting further word
from Medhi Bazargan, prime minister of Kho
meini's provisional government.
Rhodesian airliner shot down
Salisbury, Rhodesia — A Rhodesian airliner that
crashed on takeoff yesterday, killing all 59 persons
aboard, probably was shot down by black
nationalist guerrillas, military and airline sources
said.
"We haven't gathered exact evidence yet, but
everything points to this being another strike by
terrorist ground fire," one airline source said.
Last Sept. 3, guerrillas claimed responsibility for
shooting down another Air Rhodesia plane with a
Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air, heat-seeking
missile. That plane also went down shortly after
taking off from Kariba and 48 persons were killed,
including 10 survivors slain on the ground by guer
rillas. Eight persons escaped alive.
Both planes were four-engine turboprop Vis
counts.
The blue-and-white airliner took off smoothly
yesterday from Kariba, on the border with Zambia,
bound for Salisbury, 200 miles to the Southeast.
But some six minutes later a distress call was

made and it crashed. Air Rhodesia later issued this
terse announcement:
"Air Rhodesia regrets to announce the loss of a
Viscount aircraft operating flight RHB27 between
Kariba and Salisbury."
Army troops reached the site of the wreckage
and found no survivors, airline officials said.
The first indication at Kariba airport that Flight
827 was missing came when passengers, on an Air
Rhodesia Viscount that took off 15 minutes later
for Salisbury saw three camouflaged soldiers rush
ing toward a police spotter plane.
The downed airliner carried men, women and
children, mostly people on holiday who had spent
the weekend at Kariba, which features a casino
and excellent fishing on Kariba Lake.
Farm worker walkout grows
El Centro — Harvesting of nearly all of the na
tion's winter lettuce was halted yesterday as an
estimated 7000 farm workers staged an unex
pected one-day work stoppage to mourn a United
Farm Worker's (UFW) union member slain during
a bitter 3'/2-week-old strike.
The one-day walkout, which affected 30 grow
ers, came in the midst of a strike by 4200 UFW
members against 10 majorgrowers and shippers in
California and Arizona who account for about 40
percent of the nation's winter lettuce.
The work stoppage occurred two days after
UFW striker Rufino Contreras, 28, was shot to
death during a confrontation at a farm outside
Holtville. To defuse tensions, Chavez on Sunday
ordered an end to all picketing until Contreras is
buried and called for a general work stoppage on
the day of the funeral, probably tomorrow or
Thursday.
Chavez said he urged the workers to return to
their jobs today at farms that are not targets of the
strike.
Contreras was among 15 striking workers who
entered a field where replacement workers are
picking lettuce. Three men — two farm fore
men and a replacement worker — have been
booked for investigation of murder.
Acting Gov. Mike Curb said there were no plans
to act on the growers' request to call in the
California National Guard to keep order in the
24-day-old strike.
Grower Tom Hubbard said the growers not only
plan to shut down all operations on the day of the
funeral, but have requested that the nation's let
tuce industry call a halt to honor the worker.
Gov't budget amendment urged
New York — Americans overwhelmingly favor a
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced
federal budget because they don't trust politicians
to put a lid on government spending, an As
sociated Press-NBC News poll shows.

The public, weary of continuing inflation which
they blame in part on deficit spending, says cutting
waste in the federal bureaucracy would save
enough money to balance the half-trillion-dollar
budget.
But Americans' distrust of politicians is so deep
that they don't believe their elected officials will
act. Thus, they are split over whether the deficit
actually could be wiped out in the next few years.
The AP-NBC News poll found 70 percent of
those interviewed Feb. 5 and 6 favor a budget
balancing amendment. Eighteen percent opposed
such a move, and 12 percent were not sure.
Despite the high level of support, Americans
don't think their elected officials will actually ac
complish the balancing act.
Only one in four said politicians will work to
balance the budget. Seventy percent said politi
cians will not work to wipe out the deficit. Six
percent of the 1600 adults interviewed were not
sure.
Study criticizes Peace Corps
Washington — The Peace Corps fails to
adequately screen volunteers, with some candi
dates being interviewed by telephone and others
not at all, according to a new study by the General
Accounting Office (GAO).
The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, also
said the overseas volunteer service fails to give
adequate information to volunteers about the
conditions under which they are expected to live.
One costly result has been that "many volun
teers are terminating service before scheduled
completion —frequently within the first months of
service," said the report.
And the Peace Corps' personnel turnover rate
was three times as high as that of other federal
agencies, the study noted, in part because the
corps limits the time its staff members can serve.
The study was conducted of the Peace Corps
office in Washington and its operations in Colom
bia, Honduras, Malaysia, Afghanistan and Kenya.
Responses were sought from volunteers in those
countries from July to September 1977.

Iranian consulate occupied
San Francisco— Student supporters of the new
government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took
over the offices of the Iranian Consulate yesterday
and replaced pictures of the shah with those of the
78-year-old Shiite Moslem patriarch.
"We are here to supervise the affairs of the con

Mahzoon on the first day after the fall of the shah
appointed government in Iran. "This consulate
officially belongs to the people of the Islamic Re
public of Iran," he said.
The turning point in the 13-month-old Iranian
crisis came Sunday when Khomeini forces crushed
the last st«nd of Iran's constitutional monarchy

Rhodesian airliner shot down
Salisbury, Rhodesia — A Rhodesian airliner that
crashed on takeoff yesterday, killing all 59 persons
aboard, probably was shot down by black
nationalist guerrillas, military and airline sources
said.
"We haven't gathered exact evidence yet, but
everything points to this being another strike by
terrorist ground fire," one airline source said.
Last Sept. 3, guerrillas claimed responsibility for
shooting down another Air Rhodesia plane with a
Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air, heat-seeking
missile. That plane also went down shortly after
taking off from Kariba and 48 persons were killed,
including 10 survivors slain on the ground by guer
rillas. Eight persons escaped alive.
Both planes were four-engine turboprop Vis
counts.
The blue-and-white airliner took off smoothly
yesterday from Kariba, on the border with Zambia,
bound for Salisbury, 200 miles to the Southeast.
But some six minutes later a distress call was

made and it crashed. Air Rhodesia later issued this
terse announcement:
"Air Rhodesia regrets to announce the loss of a
Viscount aircraft operating flight RHB27 between
Kariba and Salisbury."
Army troops reached the site of the wreckage
and found no survivors, airline officials said.
The first indication at Kariba airport that Flight
827 was missing came when passengers, on an Air
Rhodesia Viscount that took off 15 minutes later
for Salisbury saw three camouflaged soldiers rush
ing toward a police spotter plane.
The downed airliner carried men, women and
children, mostly people on holiday who had spent
the weekend at Kariba, which features a casino
and excellent fishing on Kariba Lake.
Farm worker walkout grows
El Centro — Harvesting of nearly all of the na
tion's winter lettuce was halted yesterday as an
estimated 7000 farm workers staged an unex
pected one-day work stoppage to mourn a United
Farm Worker's (UFW) union member slain during
a bitter 3'/2-week-old strike.
The one-day walkout, which affected 30 grow
ers, came in the midst of a strike by 4200 UFW
members against 10 majorgrowers and shippers in
California and Arizona who account for about 40
percent of the nation's winter lettuce.
The work stoppage occurred two days after
UFW striker Rufino Contreras, 28, was shot to
death during a confrontation at a farm outside
Holtville. To defuse tensions, Chavez on Sunday
ordered an end to all picketing until Contreras is
buried and called for a general work stoppage on
the day of the funeral, probably tomorrow or
Thursday.
Chavez said he urged the workers to return to
their jobs today at farms that are not targets of the
strike.
Contreras was among 15 striking workers who
entered a field where replacement workers are
picking lettuce. Three men — two farm fore
men and a replacement worker — have been
booked for investigation of murder.
Acting Gov. Mike Curb said there were no plans
to act on the growers' request to call in the
California National Guard to keep order in the
24-day-old strike.
Grower Tom Hubbard said the growers not only
plan to shut down all operations on the day of the
funeral, but have requested that the nation's let
tuce industry call a halt to honor the worker.
Gov't budget amendment urged
New York — Americans overwhelmingly favor a
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced
federal budget because they don't trust politicians
to put a lid on government spending, an As
sociated Press-NBC News poll shows.

The public, weary of continuing inflation which
they blame in part on deficit spending, says cutting
waste in the federal bureaucracy would save
enough money to balance the half-trillion-dollar
budget.
But Americans' distrust of politicians is so deep
that they don't believe their elected officials will
act. Thus, they are split over whether the deficit
actually could be wiped out in the next few years.
The AP-NBC News poll found 70 percent of
those interviewed Feb. 5 and 6 favor a budget
balancing amendment. Eighteen percent opposed
such a move, and 12 percent were not sure.
Despite the high level of support, Americans
don't think their elected officials will actually ac
complish the balancing act.
Only one in four said politicians will work to
balance the budget. Seventy percent said politi
cians will not work to wipe out the deficit. Six
percent of the 1600 adults interviewed were not
sure.
Study criticizes Peace Corps
Washington — The Peace Corps fails to
adequately screen volunteers, with some candi
dates being interviewed by telephone and others
not at all, according to a new study by the General
Accounting Office (GAO).
The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, also
said the overseas volunteer service fails to give
adequate information to volunteers about the
conditions under which they are expected to live.
One costly result has been that "many volun
teers are terminating service before scheduled
completion —frequently within the first months of
service," said the report.
And the Peace Corps' personnel turnover rate
was three times as high as that of other federal
agencies, the study noted, in part because the
corps limits the time its staff members can serve.
The study was conducted of the Peace Corps
office in Washington and its operations in Colom
bia, Honduras, Malaysia, Afghanistan and Kenya.
Responses were sought from volunteers in those
countries from July to September 1977.
