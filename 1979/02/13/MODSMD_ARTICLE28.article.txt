# Activist orientation stressed
## Half-the-Sky renamed 
### Robin Millington 
Women are still holding up "half
the sky" this year, only under a diffe
rent name. Last year's feminist
group, Half-the-Sky, is known this
year as the Feminist Union.
"Most of the women that were ac
tive in Half-the-Sky graduated and
others just got burned out," said
Cinny Puddefoot, a member of the
Feminist Union.
Laura Carlsen, another member of
the group, said that many people
thought part of the trouble with
Half-the-Sky was that it tried to ac
complish too much.
"It tried to be both a group to sup
port women and a group to act on
issues on campus" Carlsen said.
Activist interests
Over the summer, members of the
old Half-the-Sky group decided that
the Women's Center at the Bridge
adequately supplied support group
programs. The Feminist Union was
created so that "people with more
activist interests could get together,"
Carlsen explained.
"There's a commitment to collec
tives and there is no central hierar
chy. There are no officers oranything
and people trade off chairing com
mittees weekly," she said.

The Feminist Union is made up of
many smaller collectives.
One collective is working on a
woman's guide for the University
which will include resource informa
tion and essays on "being a woman at
Stanford," said Carlsen.
Mentor program
The Womentorship program,
another collective will allow under
graduates who want to do research
to get help from graduate students as
"mentors" on their projects, accord
ing to Carlsen. The group has just
applied for grants from private foun
dations for the mentor program,
Carlsen said.
Carlsen said this program was de
signed because the women faculty
"are already overburdened."
Carlsen also discussed sororities
and their relation to the general wo
men's community. "It's something
we've all thought about — so many
women are finding this (joining a
sorority) an attractive alternative.
Sororities are viewed as being tradi
tionally exclusive and aren't seen as
being open to all women." She said
that the Feminist Union was formed
as an organization open to all wo
men.
