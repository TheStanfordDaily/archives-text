# Med School tuition hike 13.5 percent this year
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Medical School tuition tor the
coming year will rise 13.5 percent to
$2038 per quarter for all M.D. stu
dents as a result of a compromise
reached between administrators and
trustees. The full board will be in
formed of the decision at their meet
ing today.
All M.D. students will pay $6114 for
a regular three-quarter year, an in
crease of $726.
The compromise came after the
Board of Trustees rejected the ad
ministration proposal for a differen
tial tuition hike for new and continu
ing students at its December meet
ing.
Underthat proposal, new students
would have paid a 27.6 percent tui
tion increase, while returning stu
dents would have paid a 14.6 percent
increase.
Increase too large
Besides objecting to the dual pric
ing, many trustees thought the in

creases were too large, especially in
light of the wage and price guidelines
imposed by President Jimmy Carter
last fall.
As a result, the trustees appointed
four of their members to work on a
compromise rate.
In addition, to the 13.5 percent
hike next fall, the four trustees "ten
tatively suggested" a similar 13.5
percent for the academic years
1980-81 and 1981-82.
Reasons for increase
The reason for the dramatic tuition
increases at the Medical School
stems from an eroding income base,
according to David Hopkins, assis
tant dean for administration at the
Medical School.
According to Hopkins, in 1972,
Medical School tuition covered
some 21 percent of the cost of
educating the student. Since that
time, the tuition assessments have
comprised smaller percentages of
cost every year so that the present
rate, $5388, pays only 17.9 percent of
the cost of education.
Until recently, other income
sources have made up the differ
ence, Hopkins said, but those
sources are no longer keeping up
with cost increases.
Need to meet cost of living hike
As a result, the decision was made
to increase medical school tuition
enough each year to maintain the
21-percent-of-cost figure. This
necessitated a large hike the first
year.
The idea for differential assess
ments for new and continuing stu
dents came when administrators felt
that such a large increase would be
unfair to continuing students.
In a surprise move, the trustees in
December rejected the tuition plan
and asked administrators to formu
late an alternative tuition increase
proposal.
