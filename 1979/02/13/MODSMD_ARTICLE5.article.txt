Tehran, Iran — Backers of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini struggled to
keep their revolutionary victory from
dissolving into anarchy yesterday.
Bands of trigger-happy civilians ram
paged jubilantly through Tehran's
streets firing weapons into the air.
Khomeini urged followers to avoid
"arson, destruction and cruelty." He
proclaimed that those indulging in
such acts disobeyed "Allah's orders
and are traitors to the Islamic move
ment."
But many bands of armed Iranians,
euphoric with their new power, ap
peared out of control on the first day
after the fall of the shah-appointed
government.
Khomeini aides asked civilians to
turn in unauthorized weapons at
local mosques.
Hospital toll
State radio, quoting hospital
spokesmen, said Sunday's fighting in
Tehran killed 417 people and

wounded 989. At least 200 others
died in earlier weekend violence.
It was reported that 150 persons
were killed in the northeastern city of
Tabriz and 44 in the southern city of
Shiraz.
Newspapers said 3 500 felons es
caped from the country's largest
prison, 65 miles west of Tehran, after
insurgents opened the gates Sun
day.
Airport sealed
Supporters of Khomeini sealed off
Tehran's airport, reportedly to pre
vent officials of the shah's regime
from leaving the country.
There was no firm word on Bakht
iar's fate, but a highly placed source
told The Associated Press he was
under the protection of his old friend
Mehdi Bazargan, prime minister of
Khomeini's provisional government.
Bakhtiar reportedly handed his res
ignation to Bazargan Sunday after the
military said it would no longer sup
port him.
Americans fate
There were no reports of violence
against the estimated 7 000 Ameri
cans still in Iran.
A contingent of 69 U.S. Marines
left the United States and six Air
Force helicopters left bases in
Europe in case they are needed to
bolster the guard at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran.
At Tehran's Intercontinental
Hotel, base for the Western news
media, Khomeini supporters protect
ing the hotel fought a gunbattle with
insurgents who tried to force their
way in. Nobody was reported hurt.
After months of support for the

"constitutional government in Iran,"
the Carter administration said yes
terday there was no question it
would recognize the new, revolutio
nary Islamic government in Tehran.
"We have been in touch with those
in control of the government of Iran
and we stand ready to work with
them," President |immy Carter told a
news conference.
State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter said afterward that
"the question of recognitioi does
not arise. We now have seen the pro
cess evolve as it has in many other
places in the world at times, and we
are now having to deal with the real
ity which is on the ground."
Hodding Carter said the administ
ration has begun talking with the
new government of Prime Minister
designate Mehdi Bazargan. But the
State Department spokesman had no
information on the Bazargan gov
ernment's attitude toward American
intelligence outposts in Iran, future
oil shipments or contracts with
American firms.
Oil supply
The developments in Iran could
damage the administration's anti
inflation efforts by reducing oil
supplies and driving up the domestic
price of petroleum products. In an
earlier news conference yesterday,
Carter had said the cutoff of Iranian
oil underscores U.S. vulnerability.
To offset the net loss of 500,000
barrels of Iranian oil daily because of
that country's year of political up
heavals, the president urged volun
tary conservation measures by
Americans, including adherence to
the 55-mph speed limit.

vent officials of the shah's regime
from leaving the country.
There was no firm word on Bakht
iar's fate, but a highly placed source
told The Associated Press he was
under the protection of his old friend
Mehdi Bazargan, prime minister of
Khomeini's provisional government.
Bakhtiar reportedly handed his res
ignation to Bazargan Sunday after the
military said it would no longer sup
port him.
Americans fate
There were no reports of violence
against the estimated 7 000 Ameri
cans still in Iran.
A contingent of 69 U.S. Marines
left the United States and six Air
Force helicopters left bases in
Europe in case they are needed to
bolster the guard at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran.
At Tehran's Intercontinental
Hotel, base for the Western news
media, Khomeini supporters protect
ing the hotel fought a gunbattle with
insurgents who tried to force their
way in. Nobody was reported hurt.
After months of support for the

"constitutional government in Iran,"
the Carter administration said yes
terday there was no question it
would recognize the new, revolutio
nary Islamic government in Tehran.
"We have been in touch with those
in control of the government of Iran
and we stand ready to work with
them," President |immy Carter told a
news conference.
State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter said afterward that
"the question of recognitioi does
not arise. We now have seen the pro
cess evolve as it has in many other
places in the world at times, and we
are now having to deal with the real
ity which is on the ground."
Hodding Carter said the administ
ration has begun talking with the
new government of Prime Minister
designate Mehdi Bazargan. But the
State Department spokesman had no
information on the Bazargan gov
ernment's attitude toward American
intelligence outposts in Iran, future
oil shipments or contracts with
American firms.
Oil supply
The developments in Iran could
damage the administration's anti
inflation efforts by reducing oil
supplies and driving up the domestic
price of petroleum products. In an
earlier news conference yesterday,
Carter had said the cutoff of Iranian
oil underscores U.S. vulnerability.
To offset the net loss of 500,000
barrels of Iranian oil daily because of
that country's year of political up
heavals, the president urged volun
tary conservation measures by
Americans, including adherence to
the 55-mph speed limit.
