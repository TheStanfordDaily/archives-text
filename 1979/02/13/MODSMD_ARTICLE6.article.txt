# Investment policy, Med. School problems to top trustee agenda
## 
### Mike Charlson 
While few action items are expected, key reports on
investment policy and problems at the Medical Center
will top the agenda when the Board of Trustees meets
today.
The trustees' ad hoc Subcommittee on Investment
Responsibility (SIR) met with the University Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR) informally Sunday
evening.
At the Sunday meeting, various procedural questions
were discussed and plans were made for the two groups
to communicate more directly during the months of
consideration of proxy issues this spring.
Among controversial proxy issues expected to come
before the two bodies are issues of divestment from and
nonexpansion in South Africa by corporations doing
business there.
For the past two years, trustees have had to face such
resolutions involving a number of corporations in which
the University has invested part of its $500 million en
dowment.
Reasons for differences
Sources said members ot the CIR and SIR discussed
reasons for differences in some of the CI R recommenda
tions and ultimate SIR proxy actions taken last year.
The year-old CIR, composed of students, faculty, staff
and alumni, submits recommendations regarding Uni
versity investment policies to the Board of Trustees.
Proxy resolutions to be voted on by the University
which deal with social issues are first referred to the CIR.
That group then reviews each issue and makes a recom
mendation to the Board of Trustees' SIR.
Deliberations
Following its deliberations, the SIR decides how to
vote a proxy. At times these decisions are made between
regular board meetings because of time constraints.
However, all decisions are reported to the full board.
At the Medical Center, several problems have promp

ted "a good deal of discussion" about the possibility of
splitting the jobs of dean of the Medical School and vice
president for medical affairs, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public affairs.
The last holder of the positions, Clayton Rich, res
igned effective Jan. 1, and a search committee for his
replacement was formed recently.
Med Center administrative duties
Rosenzweig said he will make a report today to the
trustees' ad hoc Committee on the Medical Center
about how other universities split top administrative
duties in their hospitals and health service schools.
Rosenzweig said the types of administration vary, but
he said that most universities with a vice president for
medical affairs have several health service schools, such
as medicine, nursing, etc., each school having its own
dean. The vice president then oversees the deans.
The University, however, has only one health service
school, making the situation here unique, he said.
The question trustees have to face, Rosenzweig said,
is whether it is advisable for the vice president to also be
dean of the Medical School.
No formal action
No formal action by the board is expected today;
however, Rosenzweig said he thinks the meeting will
give the search committee some direction.
"What we want to do is to tell the committee what it is
they are looking for," Rosenzweig said.
Other business of the Medical School committee will
include a discussion of the budget there, projected to
include the first deficit this decade, and Medical Center
relations with the community.
In recent years, the Medical Center has been plagued
with controversies involving billing practices, relations
with community physicians and accreditation of
facilities.
The management problems reportedly led to a forced
resignation by Rich during autumn quafter.
