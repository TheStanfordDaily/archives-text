# Arms advocates home birth

"Why does a society that pretends to be
pluralistic in other ways declare that there is
only one way to have a baby?" asked Suzanne
Arms, a Bay Area photojournalist and author.
A crowd of more than 100 men and women
listened to Arms at Tresidder last Thursday as
she presented a lecture entitled "Midwifery
and Home Birth — Controversial New Ways to
Have Your Baby."
Arms also illustrated her presentation of the
issue of home birth with slides depicting vari
ous "progressive" childbirth methods and a
film, Five Women, Five Births, which she pro
duced, directed and photographed.
Mother of an eight-year-old daughter and a
former nursery school teacher, Arms' per
sonal involvement began with her own pre
gnancy. "I was raised to be afraid of the process
of birth and tried to educate myself by taking
the kinds of classes that were available," she
said.
Arms admitted that she had "a very typical
birth. I labored for 28 hours. The result of my
experience was bewilderment, grief, guilt and
a lot of resentment. I felt I'd failed."
Arms then spent several years researching
childbirth. She read doctors' journals in med
ical school libraries and spent time sneaking
into hospitals begging women in childbirth to
let her interview and photograph them.
"What I saw was shocking," she said. "The
way we've treated women and children has
been very inhumane." Without any medical
training whatsoever, and with "nothing but a
lot of chutzpah," Arms said she "took on the
American way of birth and challenged it." The
result of her research was her book Immacu
late Deception, which has sold over 150,000
copies since it was published in 1975.
Arms said she found that childbirth in the
United States was "a completely closed sys
tem, allowing no choices, dangerous and full
of myths with many dangerous side effects."
She said that a woman was "totally isolated
from the rest of her life in the hospital, strip
ped of her identity, mate, clothes and even
jewelry."
Arms said the most significant change in
childbirth that has occurred in the last century
has been the presence of men in the delivery
room. "Suddenly there was another witness.
Before this fellow women turned their backs
on other women," she said.
"I am not an opponent of hospitals," Arms
said, but "I like to expose what are lies. I am a
watchdog forabuse." Arms said she refuses to
believe that technology is essential for all
women, and she rejects defense or "just in
case" medical practices which are used as
protection against lawsuits.
Arms cited four major points about the pro
cess of childbirth:
—it is above all a personal and social event,
not a physiological, medical event;
—culture plays a large part
—it is a political issue; and
—birth, as part of medicine, must fit the
needs of people.
Arms said alternatives to conventional birth
methods exist. Several hospitals, such as Stan
ford, have opened alternative birthing rooms
where rules are more relaxed. She added that
home births and non-certified lay midwives

(to be certified, one must be a nurse) are also
on the rise.
Arms said that the issue of safety of these
alternatives is not "black and white." She said,
"safety has more to do with prenatal care than
with labor and delivery. Education is the
greatest need of people today."
Arms said she doesn't advocate one
method of childbirth for everyone, and she
sees midwifery as a "protection of the nor
mal."
She said that she hopes "to see the trend in
the American way of birth reversed from ag
gressive intervention to watchful support,
from doing everything mechanical we can
possibly do to keeping the process normal
through the judicious use of modern
technology."
The 35-year-old Arms admits she is "very
cautious about having more children" be
cause of her career. But as a founder of The
Birthplace, a resource, referral and advocacy
center in Palo Alto dealing with childbirth al
ternatives, Arms would also like to continue
speaking publicly on birth.
She said she feels that "pressure does a lot,
and a few physicians have already responded
to the growing demand for changes."
Some of her other goals are transformation
of the maternity care system, more prenatal
care and more home care systems using mid
wives.
Arms said she would like to see the family
structure strengthened — whatever that
structure is — and she wants to see medicine
go back to the community. Ideally, she said,
"we see some changes in the way we train our
physicians."
Arms was born and raised on the East Coast
and attended the University of Rochester in
New York. She has lived in the Bay Area for 16
years.
She was heavily involved with the anti-war
movement of the '60s and sees a "direct corre
lation between the peace movement of the
'60s and the environmental movement of the
'70s — that is, the interest in the humanistic
principle."
