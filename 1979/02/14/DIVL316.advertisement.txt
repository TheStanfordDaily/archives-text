XEROX
Xerox Advanced Systems Department has several openings for systems
programmers. If you are graduating this year, if you desire to develop highly
advanced software systems, if you want to work in a challenging development
and marketing organization; then you should consider working for Xerox
Advanced Systems Department (ASD).
ASD is a young (less than one year old), fast-paced Department, with a unique
charter to develop advanced computer science technologies into finished
prototype systems and then to selectively place these systems in market
probes. For years Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center has performed
fundamental computer science research. ASD has been created to transfer
many of the resulting new technologies into the marketplace. ASD's focus is
Office Information Systems. Development work and our staff openings are in
the areas of database, text processing, and administrative aid systems.
ASD is placing its office information systems with selected customers to gain
experience on just what the real needs and capabilities of the "Office of the
Future" are. We are currently working with test installations in the Executive
Office of the President, the Sena's, the House, and several large corporations.
Our openings are for entry-level systems programmers. We are looking for
Bachelor's or Masters graduates with training in computer science and some
systems programming experience. Your field of study is not as important as is
your demonstrated excellence in your computer science skills and your
enthusiasm.
ASD is located next to the Stanford campus (on California Avenue in Palo
Alto), and I urge you, if you are interested, *o send your resume to me at:
Bob Carr
Xerox Advanced Systems Department
2400 Hanover Street
Palo Alto, CA. 94304
As a recent Stanford graduate in computer science, ♦ have found ASD a
challenging and satisfying environment to begin my career in. I think you may
too. If you have any questions, please call me at (415) 494-4621.
We are an affirmative action employer (m/f/h).
