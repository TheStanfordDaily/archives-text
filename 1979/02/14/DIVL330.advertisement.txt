It was on a dark night that Moishe Bloom was
walking home through the streets of London
derry Suddenly he felt a rough arm sieze him
about the neck, and the cold barrel of a pistol was
clapped to his temple
Catholic or Protestant 7 growled a voice
But I'm Jewish, laughed Moishe nerv

Two Italian Carabimeri (police) were driving
through some typically atrocious Roman traffic
After two near misses from side-swiping Fiats.

signal was functioning properly, whv else would
dnvers give them so much trouble?
