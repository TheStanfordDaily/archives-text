### Tony Rupert 
Mohammad Reaz Arei and Ali Doos
thoseini, both students here, were
among the 50 students who seized con
trol of the San Francisco Iranian consulate
Monday at 10 a.m. Aref said the students
were acting under the direction of jalil
Zarrabi, chief of a delegation represent
ing Ayatollah Rohollah Khomeini in the
United States.
Aref said he was overjoyed at Kho
meini's assumption of power in Iran and
that he felt his own reaction was typical of
Iranian students.
He expressed the belief that Khomeini
was not just a religious leader in Iran who
merely solidified opposition to the Shah.
"Khomeini is a leader of the people both
politically and religiously. All the people
are backing him."
When asked what an Islamic republic

would mean for Iran, Aref responded,
"The country will be governed according
to the Holy Rule in the Koran. This will
result in a great turn away from Westerni
zation."
Aref said that the new government
would be the best one possible for the
people of Iran. "If you obey the Koran, all
the people will be free," he said.
Aref said that under Islamic rule, a free
press will return to Iran, while women
will continue to have the freedoms they
now enjoy. Women will not be required
to return to traditional dress, but those
thatwant todosowill not bepreventedas
they were under the shah.
Aref said he expects Iran to continue to
send many students to foreign schools,
but only until Iran's universities are ex
panded. "Iran has sent students overseas

in the past because the government has
refused to build universities in Iran. The
new government will increase spending
on education," Aref said.
Aref said thatsincethe Khomeini forces
have risen to power, Iranian students are
much more willing to go back to Iran to
work. "I have many friends who have al
ready left and gone back," he said. "In
fact, if I didn't have only six months to go
to finish my Ph.D., I'd be in Iran right
now."
Aref said that about three weeks ago a
delegation representing Khomeini ar
rived in Washington D.C. to claim the
legitimate right to represent the Iranian
people in their diplomatic dealings with
the U.S.
Then Sunday, when the Bakhtiar re
gime fell, the delegation seized control of
the Iranian Embassy in Washington. De

legation chief ]alil Zarrabi, called Motjabe
Mahzoon, a Berkeley graduate student,
and directed him to take control of the
consulate in San Francisco.
Aref said that on Sunday Mahzoon con
tacted the group of students, including
Aref, and asked that they meet him at the
consulate Monday at 10 a.m. Aref said
that he and the other students went to the
office. But when they arrived, it was
locked and deserted, he said.
Aref said that a student called one of
the consuls who was sympathetic to
Khomeini; he came and unlocked the
doors. The students then occupied the
office in the name of the Khomeini provi
sional government.
Mahzoon said yesterday that he along
with eight other students had been asked
by Zarrabi to continue to occupy the of
fice and supervise its affairs. He said he

expects Iranian Prime Minister Bazargan
to appoint a new consul soon allowing
him to return to school.
Mahzoon said he felt that Khomeini
had been swept into power not only be
cause he represented opposition to the
Shah, but primarily because he was the
real leader of the people. "Prime Minister
Bazargan has.promised a free referen
dum in the very near future. I feel certain
that he will be endorsed by the people;
his character is known by all."
Mahzoon also said that most Iranian
students are relieved to know that they
will no longer be persecuted by the
SAVAK (the shah's secret police). "We are
now in the process of identifying mem
bers of the SAVAK," Mahzoon said. "And
we are going to prosecute those who
committed crimes while the shah was in
power."

Mahzoon said yesterday that he along
with eight other students had been asked
by Zarrabi to continue to occupy the of
fice and supervise its affairs. He said he

expects Iranian Prime Minister Bazargan
to appoint a new consul soon allowing
him to return to school.
Mahzoon said he felt that Khomeini
had been swept into power not only be
cause he represented opposition to the
Shah, but primarily because he was the
real leader of the people. "Prime Minister
Bazargan has.promised a free referen
dum in the very near future. I feel certain
that he will be endorsed by the people;
his character is known by all."
Mahzoon also said that most Iranian
students are relieved to know that they
will no longer be persecuted by the
SAVAK (the shah's secret police). "We are
now in the process of identifying mem
bers of the SAVAK," Mahzoon said. "And
we are going to prosecute those who
committed crimes while the shah was in
power."
Mohammad Reaz Arei and Ali Doos
thoseini, both students here, were
among the 50 students who seized con
trol of the San Francisco Iranian consulate
Monday at 10 a.m. Aref said the students
were acting under the direction of jalil
Zarrabi, chief of a delegation represent
ing Ayatollah Rohollah Khomeini in the
United States.
Aref said he was overjoyed at Kho
meini's assumption of power in Iran and
that he felt his own reaction was typical of
Iranian students.
He expressed the belief that Khomeini
was not just a religious leader in Iran who
merely solidified opposition to the Shah.
"Khomeini is a leader of the people both
politically and religiously. All the people
are backing him."
When asked what an Islamic republic

would mean for Iran, Aref responded,
"The country will be governed according
to the Holy Rule in the Koran. This will
result in a great turn away from Westerni
zation."
Aref said that the new government
would be the best one possible for the
people of Iran. "If you obey the Koran, all
the people will be free," he said.
Aref said that under Islamic rule, a free
press will return to Iran, while women
will continue to have the freedoms they
now enjoy. Women will not be required
to return to traditional dress, but those
thatwant todosowill not bepreventedas
they were under the shah.
Aref said he expects Iran to continue to
send many students to foreign schools,
but only until Iran's universities are ex
panded. "Iran has sent students overseas

in the past because the government has
refused to build universities in Iran. The
new government will increase spending
on education," Aref said.
Aref said thatsincethe Khomeini forces
have risen to power, Iranian students are
much more willing to go back to Iran to
work. "I have many friends who have al
ready left and gone back," he said. "In
fact, if I didn't have only six months to go
to finish my Ph.D., I'd be in Iran right
now."
Aref said that about three weeks ago a
delegation representing Khomeini ar
rived in Washington D.C. to claim the
legitimate right to represent the Iranian
people in their diplomatic dealings with
the U.S.
Then Sunday, when the Bakhtiar re
gime fell, the delegation seized control of
the Iranian Embassy in Washington. De

legation chief ]alil Zarrabi, called Motjabe
Mahzoon, a Berkeley graduate student,
and directed him to take control of the
consulate in San Francisco.
Aref said that on Sunday Mahzoon con
tacted the group of students, including
Aref, and asked that they meet him at the
consulate Monday at 10 a.m. Aref said
that he and the other students went to the
office. But when they arrived, it was
locked and deserted, he said.
Aref said that a student called one of
the consuls who was sympathetic to
Khomeini; he came and unlocked the
doors. The students then occupied the
office in the name of the Khomeini provi
sional government.
Mahzoon said yesterday that he along
with eight other students had been asked
by Zarrabi to continue to occupy the of
fice and supervise its affairs. He said he

expects Iranian Prime Minister Bazargan
to appoint a new consul soon allowing
him to return to school.
