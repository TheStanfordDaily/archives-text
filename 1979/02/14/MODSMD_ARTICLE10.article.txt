## American energy concerns foremost 
### 
No other issue is as basic to
our security and survival as
energy. Energy is vital in pro
viding us with food, mobility,
homes, light, water and com
fort. We depend on energy for
so much and without the inter
national cooperation from
other nations in the world to
day, we would fall far short of
meeting all our needs.
Material and energy re
sources are distributed un
equally throughout the world
and are located far from the
areas of greatest use. In order
to avoid the societal paralysis
of a resource cartel or em
bargo, it is imperative that the
United States secure, as
quickly as possible, its full
energy independence.
This is not only important in
so far as maintaining the
economy, improving the ruin
ous balance of trade and stop
ping inflation, but also to avoid
the horrible consequences of
conflict, or even a war, over re
sources and energy supplies.
The United States could re
duce its demand for fuel im
ports through conservation,
cogeneration and waste and
material resource recycling
programs, and by starting im
mediately to ambitiously
employ proven renewable
energy technologies. Such
technologies include solar
heating and passive solar sys
tems, wind generators,
biomass technologies and
small-scale hydro-systems.
Today, Americans use more
energy per capita than any
other nation in the world. The
United States consumes more
energy than West Germany,
Japan, the United Kingdom
and the Soviet Union com
b ned. Fortunately, there is
considerable room for im
provement and American effi
ciency can be increased by as
much as 5 percent through
conservation measures.
Conservation reduces our
dependence on foreign re
sources, and frees scarce re
sources for others who need
them more. This helps reduce
international tensions by keep
ing world prices down because
of decreased demand. In addi
tion, energy derived from con
servation is safer, more reli
able, less expensive and less
polluting than energy from any
other source.
Conservation measures help
avert uncomfortable shortages
and will save energy resources
for future generations so that
they will not have reduced
standards of living. And con
servation is a long-term neces
sity if we are to meet the na
tional goal of energy self

sufficiency.
Almost one-half of the one
million barrels of oil, which the
United States burns every 90
minutes, is imported. At any
time, our foreign supplies may
be cut off or the price may be
raised unfairly. Domestic
sources of renewable energy
could supply much of our pre
sent energy needs, if they are
given the chance.
About 34 percent of all our
end-use energy needs are used
to provide heat at tempera
tures under 100 degrees C. In
expensive, unsophisticated
solar collectors can easily pro
vide this much heat.

'In order to avoid the
societal paralysis of a
resource cartel or em
bargo >, it is imperative
that the United States
secure, as quickly as
possible, its full energy
independence.'

The most inexpensive form
of solar energy is passive solar.
Passive solar systems use the
design of the building and
landscape to trap, store and
transfer the sun's warmth or
nighttime cooling. According
to the American Institute of Ar
chitects, if we built almost all
buildings with passive solar
techniques, by 1990 it would
save as much energy as the pro
jected 1990 usage of nuclear
power or coal.
Renewable energy
technologies are abundant,
dependable, decentralized,
less polluting and are less vul
nerable to acts of sabotage or
terrorism. Decentralized
sources of power lessen the
impact of an attack on or
breakdown in our present
highly centralized U.S. power
grid.
Hydroelectric power and av
ailable wind and sunlight are
dependable because no nation
can deny us our access to these
sources. Finally, renewable
energy investments are sus
tainable. Once operative,
these systems require little
maintenance and the fuel is al
ways free.
Sharing renewable energy
technologies with underde
veloped nations is a perfect
way to encourage their energy
independence and self
sufficiency. We can rest as
sured that these gifts contain
no bombgrade substances or

other materials with prolifera
tion potential.
No other energy source im
perils our survival as directly as
nuclear power. Nuclear wastes
are a permanent disposal prob
lem and can be reprocessed
into nuclear boyibs. Terrorists
could blow up a nuclear power
plant. A large nuclear accident
could kill millions and a nuc
lear war could end life as we
know it.
Weapons proliferation is the
most serious concern and at
least 15 nations now have the
technical competence and the
necessary materials to make
their own bombs. We have no
guarantee that other countries
(not to mention terrorists and
criminals) will always act re
sponsibly in the human in
terest, and not in their own na
tional interest.
At what point are the possi
ble benefits derived from a par
ticular source of energy out
weighed by the dangerous and
immensely destructive possi
bility of abuse, error or acci
dent? The threat of worldwide
nuclear proliferation and ter
rorism is so terrible that we
must not accept it. We should
give alternatives, like solar
energy and conservation, a fair
chance because they are safer
and more reliable.
Energy is such a central issue
internationally that it often be
comes a focal point of tension
and conflict. And we all com
pete for the same petroleum
and material resources and
food supplies. Because energy
is so basic to security and the
survival of our civilization we
must act early and decisively to
ensure that enough energy will
be available for the United
States and other nations in the
future.
Reducing population growth
and distributing wealth and
energy more equitably are
both essential steps in avoiding
a war over energy. If we really
wanted security and peace, we
would stop spending six times
as much money on arms re
search as we do on energy re
search. If nations were more
energy self-sufficient and sus
tainable, there would be less
reason for us to spend so much
money defending ourselves.
The present level of sense
less destructive capacity in the
United States and the Soviet
Union of 30,000 nuclear
weapons each is enough to de
stroy everyone in the world
several times over â€” and yet
we still continue to build three
more hydrogen bombs each
day.
We must realize that no na
tion is safe unto itself in this

highly interdependent world
and our security, more than
ever, depends on the prosper
ity of our neighbors. Ameri
cans must simplify their levels
and patterns of consumption
in a world of increasing scar
city.
It is also in our best interests
to encourage a cooperative
world order where resources
are freely shared. By 1985, the
United States will be depen
dent on poor countries for
over one-half of its supplies for
nine out of 13 basic industrial
raw materials required by a
modern economy.

S. Dillon Ripley has said,
"The fate of all nations has
come to be inexorably in
tertwined with our everyday
needs." Because energy prob
lems are worldwide, the coop
eration of every nation will be
needed.
We can't jog in a race for sur
vival. We are running out of
time and will not have another
chance. As students, consum
ers, homeowners and voters,
we all have a stake and the po
tential to influence our future
energy policies.
