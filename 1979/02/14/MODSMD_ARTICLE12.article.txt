## Democratic Socialists organize 
### 
There are some things in our
society that are very wrong. In
equality, unjustness, and
domination permeate the en
tire structure of American
political, economic and social
life. We, the Stanford branch
of the Democratic Socialist Or
ganizing Committees,
(DSOC), as socialists of the
democratic left, are working
for the full development of
democracy in all spheres of
life.
The DSOC is a national
group of socialists who believe
that the problems facing
America today need democra
tic planning, and thus we work
as a part of the democratic
party. The national organiza

tion works with labor unions,
the women's movement and
minorities in the continual
struggle for democracy and
equality. Some of the things
DSOC is fighting for include:
—income redistribution
through a genuinely progres
sive income tax;
—a shift of resources from
the private sector to the public
sector in areas like medicine
and pensions;
—planned social invest
ments, in energy resources, for
example, to counteract the in
fluence of private wealth;
—a government committed
to full employment and to
progressive social programs.
We champion these changes

in a way so as to make them
attack the structures of injus
tice.
We must realize that
changes such as those of the
New Deal and the Fair Deal
were only cosmetic and that
what is needed are changes on
the structural and institutional
level. Liberalism as the
philosophy of the mainstream
democratic left must, to be
true to its own values, move
beyond its old positions.
The basic institutions and
mechanisms of the American
economy poorly distribute
both wealth and political
power and accept poverty and
racism while encouraging in
equality. There must be growth
of grass roots participation and
decision making. Changes ir?
wealth distribution and man
agement of resources must oc
cur. Increments of change
must, however, be turned to
ward the structural transforma
tion of the society itself.
The DSOC group here is
composed of students, staff,
faculty and community mem
bers interested in combining
socialist vision with practical
politics. We are concerned
with national, local and Uni
versity issues, as well as with
issues of foreign policy, which
should prom6te a just and
egalitarian society. We are con
tinually seeking to learn how
we, as a group, can be most
effective in working for
change.
Many groups working for
change have been strictly

issue-oriented, and have died
out when the immediate prob
lem has been solved. DSOC,
while working on current is
sues, never ceases to keep in
mind its goal of a democratic
Socialist society. We feel it is
important to work and keep in
touch with other social and
political organizations on
campus and in the community.
We believe that coalition poli
tics is the most realistic and
democratic way for us to work
towards our goal.
The DSOC group here is new
and growing. All people in
terested in getting involved in
or simply finding out more
about DSOC are welcome at
our meetings (announced in
OAT 0). Also, for those in
terested in further exploring
socialism and its possibilities, a
socialist study group is being
developed. Of interest both to
DSOC members and any
others curious about socialism
are Michael Harrington's (Na
tional Chair for DSOC) discus
sion on "Socialism in the Uni
versity community" to be held
tomorrow at 4 p.m. at Theta
Chi. Also, Harrington will de
bate Political Science Prof.
Seymour Lipset on "The Past
and Future of Socialist Move
ments in America" tomorrow
atBp.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
