## Little 11: minority affairs relevant 
### 
(Fifth of a series)
Reflecting on the composi
tion of the Little Eleven Con
ference, some minority stu
dents have criticized it as an
elitist gathering with little rele
vance to non-white students.
As black and Chicana wo
men, we have also confronted
this question. Our ultimate
realization is that without
minority participation, there is
a greater chance that the pre
dictions of elitism will be fulfil
led. In addition, there would
be np one to speak out on is
sues affecting minority stu
dents. The Little Eleven Minor
ity Affairs Committee is an op
portunity for minority students
to voice their opinions on is
sues directly concerning them.
Defining exactly what is
meant by "minority" is no easy
task. While we represent only
two ethnic backgrounds, we
are keeping ourselves open to
represent other minority
groups on campus. We have
been meeting with various or
ganizations and individuals to
increase our knowledge of is
sues affecting each commun
ity. Although each group has
its unique concerns, all minor
ity students share common
goals and problems.
Some common issues are
admissions, recruitment, fi
nancial aid, tenure for minority
professors, cultural centers
and declining graduate stu
dent enrollment. There is also
a need to strengthen support
networks for minority students
because the larger political is
sues do not overshadow ra
cism faced by individuals —
subtle or otherwise.
The minority student who
wishes to expand his cultural
awareness can do so, whether
by participating in a theme
house or taking one of the

many courses with a minority
focus offered through prog
rams such as the Chicano Fel
lows. For support or advice,
one is sure to find a welcome
environment through re
sources such as peer coun
selors or in one of the minority
pre-professional groups.
Ethnic groups sponsor a vari
ety of activities designed to
meet the need? of the specific
community. These activities
are also open to the entire
campus (e.g. the spring Pow
wow, sponsored by native
American students, or Black
Liberation Month).
At Little Eleven, we can share
these experiences with other
minority students. The confer
ence provides a forum for dis
cussion from a broader
perspective than usual. We can
discuss common concerns.
Learning what is happening
with minority students on
other campuses can give in
sight into dealing with issues
here and suggest new ap
proaches. As well as providing
information, the conference

should establish communica
tion networks with other
schools.
Although we realize the con
ference is no magic cure for
any minority student prob
lems, its value should not be
underestimated. The informa
tion we have acquired through
meeting with people has in
creased our understanding of
the diverse yet similar minority
communities here.
However, the committee's
task is not completed. More

input is needed to assure an
accurate and useful report
which will benefit the Univer
sity community here as well as
the Little Eleven Conference.
If you or your organization
have any information that
would help us prepare for this
conference, we would ap
preciate your input.
