# Carol Doda projects ’Sensuous feeling'
## 
### Karen Roman 
"My philosophy is: if you're
going to do something, do it
big/' said Carol Doda as she
nestled against the massive
wooden bar at the Condor
Club in the North Beach dis
trict of San Francisco. Doda's
name is legendary, synonym
ous with Broadway and the
Condor, where she ignited the
whole "topless" craze back in
the dim days of the '60s.
At one point a "nice Italian
girl from Napa Valley," Doda
began working at the Condor
as a cocktail waitress when she
was 17. "I had quite a follow
ing," she related. "I used to tell
the guys jokes, you know, and
kid with them. As a gag, I
started to dance on this piano
we had in there. Then one day,
my boss brought in this topless
bathing suit and ..."
Doda was an instant hit on
the "Strip," and a flurry of top
less clubs opened in her wake.
Eager to excel at her new pro
fession, Doda became one of
the first women to undergo a
series of silicone injections.
Three years and $800 later, she
had acquired a 44-inch bust
and lasting notoriety.
In his book, the Pump House
Gang, Tom Wolfe devotes an
entire chapter to Doda, charac
terizing her as "one of San
Francisco's great resources,
along with the cable cars, the
hills, the Bay, the view and the
Golden Gate."
The interior of the Condor
Club is lit only by chandeliers
inset with red light bulbs, just

perceivable through the murk
are the scantily clad cocktail
waitresses who lurch precari
ously through the narrow
aisles on their stacked heels.
Not illegal
Two cops are leaning against
the bar. One of them peered
defensively up, "Naw, there
ain't really nothing that they
can do up there on stage that's
illegal anymore."
Up on stage, a dancer,
black-satin garters biting into
too-white flesh, gyrates slowly
to the rock music that pounds
relentlessly from the speakers.
A rust-colored feather boa
oozes down the length of her
body. The greying
businessmen strain to see the
stage, whistling appreciatively
and nudging their buddies
with an exaggerated show of
male fraternity.
Doda has been at the Con
dor for 15 years. All her dreams
of "making it big, being first
class in some place back East
like New York or Miami" have
fizzled as she still grinds
through five shows a night, five
nights a week.
Labelled
Tired resignation is sparked
by infrequent bursts of re
sentment about her "fate."
"I'm labelled," she muttered
softly, creasing her face into a
flight grimace. "Everybody
thinks that this is all I can
do ... " She makes a sweep
ing gesture around the tired
environs of the club. "It's too
late, and I'm too proud to go
knocking on doors now."

Her strong sense of fatalism
is kept at bay through deter
mined campaigns for self
improvement. She took an act
ing course at the American
Conservatory Theater in 1968,
but she said she was plagued
by deep-set insecurities. "I'm
scared of auditioning," she
said, her low voice bordering
on a husky-throated drawl.
John Huston, the director, of
fered me this part in Fat City,
but I turned him down. He
wanted me to play this heavy
set blond woman, a real bitch.
But I don't think I'm like that at
all.
Surprisingly small-framed
with a massive sweep of
platinum blond hair, she
downs herwhiskey, neat, fend
ing off the attentions of two
customers with a practiced air.
Her features are small and clas
sically pretty, the quirks of age
hidden under skillfully applied
coats of make-up. "I'm 35,"
she says flatly, and decisively.
Gets exercise
A fervent vegetarian, she
also works out daily at the gym
to keep firm, as well as to de
velop her "pecs" (pectoral
muscles). Doda gets off work at
2 a.m., but she said she is not
mentally tired after work.
"Working here isn't prog
ressive enough for my mind,"
Doda said. "I feel like a horse
ready to run a race; I can't stay
in the same place." Full of
pent-up energy, she rises each
morning by 9 a.m., filling her
day with friends, working out,
and her latest hobby — photo

graphy.
Doda speaks in winsome
cliches, a product of countless
small dreary California towns,
"When I was a kid, I used to
think, 'there's gotta be some
thing better than this,' " Doda
reminisced. A victim of the ar
chetypical broken home (her
parents were divorced when
she was 3), she is outspokenly
independent, rejecting any in
terpersonal ties or needs. "I
only know myself. My security
is myself. I don't understand
the whole family scene," she
muses. "What does marriage
mean anyway? A conventional
lifestyle doesn't make sense
anymore."
With a defensive edge to her
voice, Doda related what hap
pened recently when Margo
St. James, a madam turned civil
rights leader and her small
band of prostitutes marches up
and down the Strip in an ironic
crusade against sex and vio
lence.
Exploitation
"St. James accused us of
exploiting ourselves, our
womanhood. But we're all
exploiting ourselves every day
of our lives," Doda said. The
girls here are not being
exploited. Why, they were all
being bored out of their minds
in their old jobs, being sec
retaries or whatever.
"Here, I have a chance to be
creative at least," she con
tinued. "When I dance, I'm
projecting to people a sensu
ous feeling, perhaps stimulat
ing their minds, and thereby in

creasing their sensitivity to
sensual feelings that they have
inside of them that they might
not be aware of."
From the shadows of the
stairwell, the cocktail waitress
peered up fearfully from under
the ripple of soft brown hair
that framed her kittenish face.
"Promise you won't use my
name," she tremored. "I've
only been here a month but I
think that I'm going to quit in a
few weeks. I used to be a
nurse, you know ..." her
squeaky voice tapers off as she
looks around nervously.
"I don't care what Carol or
any other women around here
have been telling you," she
murmured. "Women are really
exploited here. The boss and
the manager keep a tight rein
on their employees— the only
way woman rule here is by
their vaginas."
It was time for Doda's
show." She gulped down the
rest of her drink and bolted
backstage to change. There
was a big build up — the rauc
ous music reached a cres
cendo, as Doda swooped onto
the stage amidst flashing red
lights, her filmy purple robe
with dangling ostrich feathers
trailing after her.

Ribald "strip" music slam
med down from the speakers
as she sauntered out to greet
the audience, microphone in
hand. The people ran the spec
trum |>112 types and nationalities,
including the Japanese
tourists. "Hey, I'm from Japan,
too," joked Doda with a tired

smile that had been teased out
of its brightness from endless
repetition, "from here to
here," her hand moving de
scriptively over her volumin
ous chest. The silicone had
been imported from japan.
' In his book, Tom Wolfe de
scribed Doda's act as "not a
strip tease. It's no kind of
tease; it is an animated car
toon." Swiftly stripping down
to a meager g-string, she gy
rated suggestively on top of a
satin-bound piano that had
been lowered by pulley from a
hole in the ceiling.
As the piano ascended back
up, a disinterested executive
downing numerous scotch and

sodas from his front row seat,
offered his opinion. "You
know, the most sensuous part
of Carol is, of course, her
mouth." He watched as she
pursed her pale rosy lips into a
big 'O'. "But there's one thing,
they're all missing," he re
flected, "the art of seduc
tion ..."
He smiled gently, this
rotund, well-fed, well-kept
man here just fora lark, as were
the hundreds of others that
paraded through the club night
after night. "Carol tries the
hardest," he mused. "But you
know, it's the youngest that
leave you the coldest of all."
