Santa Cruz (AP) — Angry students at the
University of California's Santa Cruz campus
are rallying to the defense of the 10-year-old
school, speaking out on its good qualities.
"The trouble is, people think it's somehow
a hippie school," said sophomore Dan
Greene, a photography major. "Santa Cruz
gives me a chance to develop myself accord
ing to my goals and not the goals that some
body else wants to impose on me."
The students said they fear stringent
budgetary cutbacks, partly because of recent
published reports that the school's academic
standards have fallen off. Enrollment is
down.
Many students design their own majors, in
consultation with counselors. Students re
ceive a written evaluation from their
teachers, instead of the traditional grades.
"It's simply a total misconception that
UC-Santa Cruz is not a place for serious stu
dents," said Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer.
"While there may be some shift in student
emphasis, towards vocational and
specialized professional schools and away
from liberal arts and sciences programs,
there are many, many reasons for the enroll
ment decline."
New campus
Some of the reasons, he said, include the
fact that the campus isn't old enough to be
well-known and that some admissions staff

members have not had good records of keep
ing in touch with high school counselors who
advise students on college choices.
"We also admit that our narrative evalua
tion system is the source of great misun
derstanding," he added. "We believe the
system reduces the harmful aspects of stu
dents competing for grades and produces a
high level of personal motivation."
Some students agree.
Nancy Teller, a junior majoring in theater
arts, said most students are career-oriented.
"Santa Cruz gets people to think for them
selves," she said. "It is self-motivation. When
I graduate, I think I'll have many qualities of
judgment and motivation that plenty of
employers would want in a person."
Small school
Susan Szabo, a sociology major, said she
had "learned to learn and I've been inspired
to learn because this place is small and it is
personal. What could be more practical than
helping a person become a self-motivated
learner?"
Literature Prof. David Swanger noted
the problems on campus, saying, "Everyone
here realizes there's an economic tightening
and that declining enrollment and the budget
situation are like two pincers closing in.
"But ask anyone on this campus and they'll
tell you — we can't afford to not have Santa
Cruz."
