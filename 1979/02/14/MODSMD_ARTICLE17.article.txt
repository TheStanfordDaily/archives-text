## Devils abound in Kaunas 
### 
Kaunas, U.S.S.R. (AP) —
Kaunas is a helluva town.
What else can be said about a
centuries-old Lithuanian city
which houses 4000 "devils," a
collection intended to pre
serve one of the most interest
ing folklores in this Baltic state.
Itall started on June 13,1906,
when a Catholic priest came to
the home of Lithuanian painter
and collector Antonas Zmuid
zinavicius in hopes of persuad
ing the non-believer to begin
attending church.
The artist refused, and the
frustrated priest gave him a
present — a crudely carved
wooden sculpture of the smil
ing face of Satan.
"Then at least you must
make friends with the devil,"
the priest reportedly said, and
Zmuidzinavicius — who al

ready had 22 collections of var
ious stripes — eagerly started a
23rd by gathering likenesses of
the devil from around the
world.
By the time of his death at 90
in 1966, the Kaunas artist had
found some 260 little Satans in
all shapes and sizes.
After the painter's death, the
Lithuanian government took
control of the collection and
put it on display in a tiny
museum, tucked away on one
of the city's narrow, cobble
stoned streets. Outside stands
a stone sculpture of the devil,
smirking at the 2000 daily vis
itors.
Tht„ devil has both pagan and
religious significance in this
country, which is a Catholic
stronghold and the last country
in Europe to be Christianized,

as late as the 16th Century.
Many of even the most re
ligious Lithuanian families
keep a devil or two promi
nently around the house for
old time's sake.
According to Lithuanian
folklore, the devil was not al
ways an evil person. Quite
often he would help the poor,
and in some fairy tales he is
even portrayed as a comic, ab
surd and pitiable creature.
And many Lithuanians still
believe in the old superstition
that anyone who collects devils
will become the richest, most
powerful person — with a little
help from Satan.
And nowadays, Lithuanian
mothers still warn their
daughters to beware of a hand
some man as he may be the
devil in disguise.
