And Houston girls with the way
they talk they knock us out when

And Norwegian girls with the way
they kiss they keep their hoy
friends warm at night.
We're glad you all could be
lathmpian Girls.
Now Room 4 had the sunshine and
they made us Rugby fans
We dig the Dc'ly hoots, and Hono

Love and kisses from the staff-
These Valentines have been a laugh.
With so many wishes, we've no time
To proof-read every single line.
Should your ad be wrong in print,
Don't see us - your quarter's spent
On sustenance to help us through.
Typing all these thoughts for you.
(Our typists' wishes are all right-
Their eyes, however, aren't so bright!)
You II find a greeting here for you;
Take your time and read them through. . .
And through . . . And through . . . And . . ..
