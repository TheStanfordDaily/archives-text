Happy Valentine's Day!
Yesterday at 6 a.m. the Casanovas of La C asa Italiana presented their Third
Annual Valentine's Day Champagne breakfast to their bleary-eyed, but
happy sweethearts. Why Tuesday? "We wanted to keep them on their
toes," replied one of the Italian lovers. Pic tured above is Giovanni Mitchell,
Caterina Coquillard and, in background, Giacomo Moore.
