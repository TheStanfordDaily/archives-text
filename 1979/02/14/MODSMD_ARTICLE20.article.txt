# Israeli Parliament member discusses Mideast controversy
## 
### Michael Prince 
Ehud Olmert, a member of
Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin's Likud party in the Israeli
Parliament, spoke with about
M 'people at a sherry hour in
P&toma lounge in Florence
Moore Hall last week. The 33-
year-old Olmert, in his second
ter'rn and serving on commit
tees for defense budget, fi
nance and education, discus
sed Israel's current position in
the Middle East conflict.
... Daily: What are the issues
currently holding up a treaty

with Egypt?
Olmert: The Camp David ag
reement had two different
frameworks. One was the
framework for peace between
Israel and Egypt, and the other
was the framework for the sol
ution of the Palestinian issue.
The basis of all the agree
ment was that the two
frameworks are separate and
independent without any lin
kage whatsoever. When we re
sumed negotiations in order to
work out the process, the
Egyptians introduced new de

mands.
One was to link between the
two frameworks and to condi
tion the exchange of ambas
sadors between Israel and
Egypt to the implementation of
the autonomy (for Palestinians)
on the West Bank. In other
words, what they said was, we
are ready to get back Sinai, but
when we come to the ex
change of ambassadors we will
consider it according to the
development on the West
Bank. Israel could not agree to
such a linkage.
The second main demand
was the demand of Egypt to
keep priority for the Egyptian
commitment to the respective
Arab countries in the mutual
defense treaties over the ag
reement with Israel. If, tomor
row, one of the Arab countries
will start a war against Israel,
the Egyptians will have an op
tion to join the war against Is
rael without even violating the
agreement with us. This will be
only if Israel will be the aggres
sor.
But you have to realize that,
according to the legal interpre
tation of the present situation
as they hold it, as long as we
hold territories which the Arab
countries claim to be theirs
from their point of view this is a
continuous act of aggression.
If they start a war tomorrow,
from their point of view it is an
act of self-defense. Egypt
shares this position. These are
the main obstacles to the com
pletion of the process.

Daily: What latitude as a
member of Likud do you see
Israel giving in the negotiations
over the status of the Palesti
nians on the West Bank?
Olmert: The compromise
can be worked on the follow
ing principles: First, that there
will not be a sovereign Palesti
nian state, under any cir
cumstances. We can't afford —
for purely security reasons —
the establishment of a Palesti
nian state. No one will be in a
position to control, for in
stance, a demilitarization of
such a state if it will be estab
lished. We are so much con
cerned about a possible penet
ration of the Russians to the
heart of the Middle East.
What we can do is a com
promise between the extreme
demand of the Arabs and the
extreme demand of most of the
Israelis: to try to establish
something which is more or
less in the shape of an au
tonomy and a selfhood, which
is not statehood, but which is
far more than what they have
now.
The essence of the au
tonomy plan that was prop
osed by the Likud government
is that Israel will withdraw its
military rule from Judea and
Sumaria. For the first time the
Gaza Strip, Judea and Sumaria
would be treated as onp unit
with a governing body of 11
people elected in a democratic
process by the people who live
in the territories, without any
kind of intervention by Israel

on the running of their daily
lives.
What we would certainly
have in the territories is the Is
raeli army to protect ourselves.
Israeli citizens who would pre
fer to settle in parts of Judea
and Sumaria which are not in
habited would be allowed to
do so. I believe that this is a
workable solution.
Daily: Given the fact that
Jordan is a Palestinian state and
does not seem to be in danger
of Soviet penetration, would
you object to integration of the
West Bank into Jordan?
Olmert: I think that the state
of Israel is entitled to have
boundaries that will be wider
than 10 miles.
Daily: Aren't there two is
sues here? One, the issue of
borders which are defensible,
and the other, the issue of the
West Bank?
Olmert: You ask whether Is
rael will agree to integration.
We are not prepared to with
draw military forces from the
West Bank under any cir
cumstances. We think that this
territory is essential to the sec
urity of the state of Israel. We
know what is the amount of
credibility that we can give to
commitments that there will
not be armies, that there will
be no Palestinian penetration;
we are ready to do it in Sinai
with all the risks; we are not
ready to do it on the West Bank.
There are certain boundaries
that we are entitled to have.
We are not going to live again

a country the width of which
is less than 10 miles. We need
a certain minimal territory. We
are going to keep it (the West
Bank territory) because this is
what we have, and this is the
minimum that we believe we
need.
Daily: Why do you think the
Begin government has had so
much more trouble than pre
vious Israeli governments in
selling their position to the
world press?
Olmert: Primarily, if you ask
me, prejudices. On the day
that Begin took over in Israel,
before he even said a word, I
believe that most of you re
member what was the reaction
of the world press to the possi
bility that "Begin the killer,"
that's how they called him,
would become Prime Minister
of Israel. I don't remember
such a reaction to a democratic
process in any other country.
Take the issue of the settle
ments that was raised. What
does, with all due respect,
middle America know about
the importance of settlements,
their importance to the peace
process, whether or not they
are an obstacle, etc.?
When it first appeared in the
papers they didn't know what
the whole thing was all about.
Then came the president, and
made this a major issue.
When the President of the
United States says that the set
tlements are an obstacle to
peace, then of course, the
media follows.

Daily: Doesn't a large por
tion of the population in Israel
feel the same way?
Olmert: No, a small percen
tage. A vocal percentage, ob
viously. This is a controversial
issue in Israel. But the over
whelming majority of Israelis
support the government.
Daily: What about the young
people in Israel who object to
new settlements of any sort?
Olmert: It is true that the pro
test movement, which enjoyed
a certain support in the gov
ernment, was against all the
settlements. This does not
mean that they represent the
majority. They represent
themselves; they are a small
and respected minority, but
thank God a minority.
Daily: How does Israel in
tend to make up the loss of
energy reserves from the Sinai
and Iran?
Olmert: In 1975, as part of the
interim agreement between Is
rael and Egypt, we withdrew
from the Abu Rodes oil fields,
but we conditioned it to a writ
ten American commitment that
in the case of some situaton in
Iran which will prevent Israel
from getting the oil supply, we
will get the oil supply from the
United States.
Hopefully, the United States
will keep its commitment un
conditioned to any political
circumstances that might de
velop in the Middle East in the
course of further negotiations
between Israel and any of the
other Arab countries.
