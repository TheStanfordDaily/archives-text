# Hall, Takimoto feel fulfilled

### Dean Eyre 
~, For many student-athletes at
• Stanford, sports is a way of life,
ilhe most fortunate individu
als, however, are those who
allow sports to become a
.spurce of life.
Mj Two gymnasts, Karen Hall
and Chris Takimoto, while tak
ing different paths, have ar
rived at this destination. There
-.have been sacrifices, but the
..net result is that athletics adds
;to their lives, rather than
/merely being a part of them.
Hall, although a freshman, is
the best woman gymnast to
nyvear Cardinal. By scoring bet
ter than a 9.oaverage in a series
/iQf national performances, she
.qualified as an Elite Gymnast.
.Prior to the current season she
was ranked 19th in the country
in all-around. In last Friday's
.rpeet against San Jose, Hall's
all-around total was 34.80, 20th
,jp the nation according to the
Rational Statistics Service for
.Gymnastics.
Watching her polished
routines now, it's hard to im
agine her as anything but a
.gymnast, a possible equestrian
or "neighborhood terror," but
.such were her inauspicious
beginnings.
» "I just got started because
my mom didn't want me hang
ing around terrorizing the
neighborhood," Hall re
minisced. "So, I swam for a
Jong time and got really bored.
T chose — it was between hor

seback riding and gymnastics."
During the past two years,
Hall spent six or seven hours a
day, six days a week working
out on a Newport Beach club
team for the elite meets.
"It's neat at Stanford be
cause I'm not the 'old per
son,'" Hall said. "Before, 18
was over the hill. It was getting
discouraging with all these 12-
year-olds whipping around.
Here you can make closer
friends because they're your
age — 12-year olds and I didn't
make it too well."
Team camaraderie — a sense
of belonging — surfaces as a
distinct advantage over the
club atmosphere of the previ
ous five years. Having team
mates, instead of just com
petitors to associate with,
helped fill a void.
"If something is bugging
you, you can always talk to
them. It gives you something in
common," she said. "I used to
go in (to the club gym) and it
was like me and this beam.
There was no one else because
everyone was so worried about
themselves."
Although academics are her
top priority, Hall believes the
University offers her an oppor
tunity to make up for lost time
in other areas.
"Before, it was getting to the
point where it was so much —
I'd have a bad day in the gym and
then everything was shot," she
said. "Here I figured I'd do a bit

of both (extracurricular and
gymnastic interests).
"I'm glad I did it — there are
so many things I've gotten out
of it that the regular person
couldn't get but there are
things — like you don't go to
parties all the time. If I hadn't
left (the club) this year I would
almost quit — I just don't think
I could have gotten any more
intense than the last couple
years. I think I still have a
chance now to do the things I
didn't do before," she added.
Or her protege, coach Jackie
Walker said, "I look forward to
so much with Karen because
she is physically stronger than
the girl I coached at LSU who
was national champion on
beam. She has better technical
execution of many skills, more
potential and a super attitude
after all she's been through. The
only thing holding her back is
injuries — if she can overcome
that she's going to be outstand
ing."
Unlike Hall, Takimoto's ini
tial turn to gymnastics was a
more direct decision. "Gym
nastics was unique," said the
senior co-captain. "It was the
first sport that I was exposed to
that just being physically large
wasn't really to your advan
tage. It was something that I
really began to excel at."
Getting started in the 10th
grade at Venice High School in
Los Angeles, Takimoto found
gymnasitcs playing a funda

mental role in his growth. "I
think it went far in developing
my whole personality because
it led to being involved in other
activities," he said. "As far as
developing my confidence and
leadership capabilities is con
cerned, it was a very good ex
perience."
Instead of ending in high
school, the importance of ath
letic involvement became the
nucleus for Takimoto's "Stan
ford experience."
"Some of my best friends at
Stanford have been on the
team," he said. "Competing in
college has been really valu
able to me — it's something
I've really enjoyed a lot."
But Takimoto almost went to
UC-Berkeley with his pommel
horse skills. Although Stanford
was his first choice, Cal offered
him a scholarship. After win
ning an NCAA title, Cal's team
decided against allotting a
scholarship to a specialist.
That, plus the chance to study
under three-time NCAA pom
mel horse champ Ted Marcy
and coach Sadao Hamada
steered him to Stanford.
Takimoto found an atmos
phere conducive to the
student-athlete: "I'm grateful
for Sadao's whole attitude —
it's a very balanced outlook.
It's totally an individual deci
sion about what commitments
you want to make. If you really
want to focus on gymnastics
he's going to be there and help
you become the very best
gymnast that you can be."
Finishing third in Pac-8 com
petition and 11th in the NCAA
championships the past two
years, Takimoto has even bet
ter showings in store, accord
ing to Hamada.
"Although being in bad
shape before the season (due
to strained ligaments in his
wrists) he should finish in the
top three at regionals," said
Hamada. "He's weak on com
pulsories — the key is cleaning
them up, but his optionals are
very good; he should finish in
the top six at nationals.
"He's matured over four
years and improved in overall
strength, better tricks and
technique. Mentally he's im
proved a lot," he said.
Again in contrast to Hall,
who hopes to enter the World
University Games, Takimoto's
post-collegiate career is li
mited because of his pommel
horse specialization and the
demands of the Yale M.D./
Ph.D. program in medicine,
which he will begin this fall. He
has a 3.9 academic average in
pre-medicine and has been
elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
Even if not directly, though,
gymnastics has and will con
tinue to be a source of inspira
tion. Judging from his success
in and out of the gym, he has
lived up to his observation:
"You're not really concerned
about beating your competi
tion — you're just concerned
about mastering your body and
doing the very best you can."
