# Skiers endure confusion
## 
### Liz Schermer 
Disorganization seems to be
the name of the game in Pacific
Coast Conference (PCC) ski
racing. For the second
weekend in a row the Stanford
ski team had to overcome the
host team's lack of timing
equipment and mix-up of start
ing orders before they could
compete against them on the
race courses.
Last weekend's University of
Nevada-Reno Winter Carnival
at Squaw Valley began Friday
with confusion. Would women
or men race first on the slalom
course? UNR's electronic tim
ing also broke so stopwatches
had to be used. After much de
lay, the men skied first on one
course and followed the
women for the second run.
Saturday's giant slalom was de
layed so long that the women
were denied a second run and
in the cross-country race on
Sunday. Several women nearly
missed their starts because the
UNR coach changed the start
ing time at the last minute.
Despite all these difficulties,
the women's team managed a
fourth place in the combined
nordic and alpine competi
tions, and the men's team
placed sixth.
Northern division teams
Washington State and Univer
sity of Puget Sound brought
strong competition to Squaw
Valley, sharing most of the top
places in the women's events.
WSU's Gene Young and UPS's
jackie Mahre won the giant
slalom and slalom respectively.
For Stanford, Jan Flaherty
placed ninth in the slalom and

13th in CS. Andrea Dewey was
tenth in slalom and eighth in
CS, and Jane Ratchye skied to
a 16th and 18th. Barb Lycan was
16th in CS.
In the men's slalom,
freshmen Blake Jorgenson and
Hal Harvey were the only two
finishers for the Cards, placing
13th and 16th, respectively. In
the CS Harvey finished 19th,
followed by Bill Volk in 20th
place and Ken Bailey finish'ne
27th.
According to captain Howie
Rosen, "this race was a good
preparation for the PCC
championships because of the
strong competition.
"It pointed out weaknesses
we'll be able to work on in
training this weekend," he
said.
The PCC Championships will

be held Feb. 22-24 at Squaw
Valley.
In Sunday's cross country
race, WSU swept five of the
first six places. Ann Gail
finished eighth and Clare Phil
lips ninth. They were the only
women racers for Stanford in
the five-kilometer race. Nordic
Captain Dave Parker placed
sixth and Kelley Foster was 15th
in the men's 15-kilometer
course. Alpine captain Rosen
filled the empty third spot on
the team and finished 25th in
his first nordic competition.
Parker and teammate Mike
Grace also competed in the 35-
meter jumping event, but re
sults were unavailable at press
time.
The ski team will train and
scrimmage against UC Ber
keley this weekend.
