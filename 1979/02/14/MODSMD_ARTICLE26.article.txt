Pullman — The basketball
Cardinals were plagued by a
game of errors as they fell to
the Washington State Cougars,
69-47 on Monday night.
The loss gives Stanford a 4-9
conference record, and 10-12
overall standing.
Washington State got off to
an escalating start with two
quick steals for a total of four
points. Closing Stanford's 4-2
lead, the Cougars scored three
more field goals in the next
three minutes.
Utilizing a man-to-man de
fense for the entire game, the
Cougars forced many errors.
"Washington State played
great defense against us for the
second straight time," said
Card coach Dick Dißiaso. "It's
the best defense we've faced in
the conference. Again we had
poor passing and much of that
can be attributed to
Washington State. They forced
us into a countless number of
bad passes, which is inexcusa
ble."
The Cards had difficulty even
attempting to shoot against the
Cougars' defense. They got
only 14 shots up against the
Cougars' 31 in the first half,
scoring on 50 percent of the
attempts.
"No question it was the de
fense that got us off early," said
WSU coach George Raveling.
"It started the flow and we
didn't stagnate like we have
some games. The key was also
our transition game in the first
half. Again I was pleased with
the press. Numerous times
the last two ball games we've
been able to force turnovers."
Fouls were another problem
for the Cards. With a definite
lead already, the Cougars
jumped on the extra oppor
tunities to score.
The Cards left the floor at
halftime, trailing 36-20.
"Our goal has been to hold
the other team to less than 60
points," Raveling said. "To
night we changed that to 50 at
halftime, so there was a heavy
burden of threat on the subs."
The Cougars' momentum
continued through the second

half although the Cards
changed their defense from
zone to man-to-man.
Don Collins was high scorer
for the game with 24 points.
"Collins has a way of sniffing
out the ball," Raveling said.
"That's why he leads the con
ference in steals.
Still, the Cards' foul problem
persisted. With 13:11 remain
ing in the game, a technical
foul was called on coach Di-
Biaso. Both Stuart House of
Washington State and Daryle
Morgan fouled out with six mi
nutes remaining, but the sor
rowful outcome had aleady
been determined. The
Cougars held a 60-37 lead.
The last two minutes of the
game dragged on, for the clock

stopped almost every ten sec
onds for foul calls.
Coach Dißiaso said, "Their
press was a good one, but
we've faced comparable pres
ses his year.
"We just had too many
breakdowns. We became very
flustered out there. It's too late
in the season to get flustered,"
he said.
The game concluded a dis
appointing road trip for the
Cardinals, who lost Saturday
night to Washington, 84-63.
The Cardinals host the
California Golden Bears Satur
day night. Cal has a 3-10 record
in the Pac-10 conference, and
the Cards will try to push it
back to 3-11 atB p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.

poor passing and much of that
can be attributed to
Washington State. They forced
us into a countless number of
bad passes, which is inexcusa
ble."
The Cards had difficulty even
attempting to shoot against the
Cougars' defense. They got
only 14 shots up against the
Cougars' 31 in the first half,
scoring on 50 percent of the
attempts.
"No question it was the de
fense that got us off early," said
WSU coach George Raveling.
"It started the flow and we
didn't stagnate like we have
some games. The key was also
our transition game in the first
half. Again I was pleased with
the press. Numerous times
the last two ball games we've
been able to force turnovers."
Fouls were another problem
for the Cards. With a definite
lead already, the Cougars
jumped on the extra oppor
tunities to score.
The Cards left the floor at
halftime, trailing 36-20.
"Our goal has been to hold
the other team to less than 60
points," Raveling said. "To
night we changed that to 50 at
halftime, so there was a heavy
burden of threat on the subs."
The Cougars' momentum
continued through the second

half although the Cards
changed their defense from
zone to man-to-man.
Don Collins was high scorer
for the game with 24 points.
"Collins has a way of sniffing
out the ball," Raveling said.
"That's why he leads the con
ference in steals.
Still, the Cards' foul problem
persisted. With 13:11 remain
ing in the game, a technical
foul was called on coach Di-
Biaso. Both Stuart House of
Washington State and Daryle
Morgan fouled out with six mi
nutes remaining, but the sor
rowful outcome had aleady
been determined. The
Cougars held a 60-37 lead.
The last two minutes of the
game dragged on, for the clock

stopped almost every ten sec
onds for foul calls.
Coach Dißiaso said, "Their
press was a good one, but
we've faced comparable pres
ses his year.
"We just had too many
breakdowns. We became very
flustered out there. It's too late
in the season to get flustered,"
he said.
The game concluded a dis
appointing road trip for the
Cardinals, who lost Saturday
night to Washington, 84-63.
The Cardinals host the
California Golden Bears Satur
day night. Cal has a 3-10 record
in the Pac-10 conference, and
the Cards will try to push it
back to 3-11 atB p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
