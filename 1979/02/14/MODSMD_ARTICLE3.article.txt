# East Asian Studies theme house asked
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
Citing a lack of opportunities for
students and faculty to interact on
the subject of East Asia, several stu
dents and faculty members here
have proposed the establishment of
an East Asian Studies theme house.
Asked why there was a need for
such a house given the existence of
lunipero House, Dan Okimoto, as
sistant professor of political science

and resident fellow in Junipero
explained that Junipero "deals only
tangentially with China and japan; it
focuses on the problems of Asian
Americans in American society."
An East Asian Studies theme house
would concentrate on a particular
geographical area, its history, cul
ture, politics and languages, accord
ing to Ken Kurosv, a student on the
committee which proposed the new
theme house.
American setting
The Asian American theme house
in lunipero examines the experi
ences of a particular group of people
in an American setting, Kurosu said.
lunipero resident Judy Brady said
Junipero "doesn't study the history,
the culture or the politics of China
and Japan, but experiences here,
such as the construction of the rail
roads, problems in Chinatown, and
during World War II."
Along with offering existing
courses through the proposed
house, students hope to sponsorvar
ious in-house courses not in the reg
ular curriculum. They also hope to
have programs such as debates, cul
tural workshops such as flower ar
rangement and martial arts, field
trips, a film series and orientation
programs for students going to Asia.
Surprise expressed
Citing the more than 40 full-time
faculty members in East Asian
Studies, the Hoover Institution's East
Asia collection, and the more than
100 courses taught each year on East
Asia, the proposal expresses surprise
that "an East Asian Studies House is
not among the theme houses cur
rently offered through residential
education."
Susan Essoyan, another student
member of the theme house com
mittee, said, "All the other houses
are Europe-oriented; we think we
should have something on Asia,
especially given the new situation
with China."
There is considerable enthusiasm
for the proposal both among stu
dents and faculty.
Steve Chelberg, a junior majoring
in International Relations, was very
excited about the possibility. "I don't
want to sound like a salesman orany
thing, but I think it's a really good
idea, and I really hope it gets ap
proval."
Faculty supporters of the proposal
include Okimoto, Peter Duus, direc
tor of the Center for East Asian
Studies, and Robert Ward, director
of the Center Research in Interna
tional Studies. A number of faculty
members have indicated an interest
in serving as house fellows, accord
ing to Okimoto.
So far, the proposal has been
evaluated by the subcommittee on
Residences of the Committee on
Student Services (COSS-R). Accord
ing to chairperson Julie Tsoi, the
proposal was found academically
sound and conforming to the princi
ples of residential education.
"We were concerned about the
tendency of theme houses to be
come self-centered, but we were im
pressed with the proposed outreach
programs," she said.
Before the proposal can be im
plemented, it must be approved by
the COSS-R and the Office of Resi
dential Education. The final decision
is expected by March 1.
