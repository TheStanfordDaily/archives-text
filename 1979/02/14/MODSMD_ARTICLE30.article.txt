### Kevin Macgillivray 
Last weekend was bad for
the pugilist in sports. First, the
Notre Dame Fighting Irish took
it on the chin in South Bend.
Then, later Sunday afternoon,
the Fighting Blue Hens lost to
Donner I at Maples Pavilion in
intramural basketball action.
No longer are the Blue Hens
unbeaten and no longer do
they stand atop the B-league
rankings.
The new top-ranked team,
Off-the-Wall Gang (OTWG),
came through with its usual
Thursday night rout and looks
as strong as ever. The remain
der of the top 10 has been
somewhat juggled as the best
teams begin to segregate
themselves from the pack.
Branner II has come on
strong to grab the second
place ranking. The Woosies
have been literally exploding
lately and jump from a no. 6
ranking last week to no. 3 this
week. The Ghetto dropped
one notch to fourth.
The Asbury Jukes, Phred's
Faces, and the Ice Nine all re
main undefeated and fill upthe
five through seven spots.
Rounding out the top ten are
Donner I, the once-plucked
Blue Hens, and Phi Delt I.
In men's A-league competi
tion, there were no upsets. All
the ranked teams won impres
sively and the rankings remain
the same.
Men's C-league has been
dominated by two teams.
Geek's Greeks and Kulos are
both undefeated and have
been clobbering the opposi
tion. One other undefeated
team, Gavilan, has been erratic
but looks to challenge the two
top-ranked teams.
Women's A-league remains
unchanged, with one excep

tion. Along with the two top
ranked teams, Hockey Red and
FYIYCTAJ, a third team has
emerged with an outside
chance to confuse the league
race. The Substituents are 3-1
and play Hockey Red in their
last game of the year. A victory
would tie all three clubs at 4-1
and send the I.M. Office per
sonnel into a quandry.
