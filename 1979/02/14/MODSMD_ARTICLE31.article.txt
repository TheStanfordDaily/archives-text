Khomeini seeks order in Iran
Tehran, Iran — Iran's revolutionary leaders
turned to liberal, Western-oriented politicians
yesterday to bring order to their country and pave
the way for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic
republic. But lynchings were reported in the pro
vinces and mysterious gunmen fired on the
Tehran offices of the new prime minister.
The newspaper Ettelaat reported six people had
been hanged in the northwest city of Tabriz on the
orders of religious leaders. The newspaper also
said insurgents ripped the emblem off the U.S.
Consulate in Tabriz.
The reports could not be confirmed here but, if
true, may signal that the new government still
lacks total control.
Khomeini made his first nationwide television
address yesterday evening and repeated appeals
for the return of weapons stolen from military
bases during the street violence that marked Sun
day's collapse of the shah-appointed government
of Shahpour Bakhtiar.
Bakhtiar was arrested on unannounced charges
yesterday by armed guerrillas. He was taken
blindfolded to Khomeini's headquarters and was
reported to have been under protection of Kho
meini's prime minister, Mehdi Bazargan, after
raiders ransacked his home on the outskirts of
Tehran.
Schlesinger sees oil shrotages
Washington — Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger told Congress yesterday there is "a
high probability" against quick restoration of Ira
nian oil production under the new government of
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Schlesinger testified that if the oil cutoff remains
through June, it could bring about worldwide oil
shortages as serious as the 1973-74 Arab oil em
bargo.
In fact, Khomeini may be powerless to reopen
the valves that had supplied 10 percent of the free
world's oil, even if he wants to, Schlesinger told
the House energy and power subcommittee.
"It is plain that control of the oil fields belongs to
certain radical groups" and political elements not
loyal to Khomeini, he said.
While stressing the seriousness of the situation,
Schlesigner echoed President Jimmy Carter's as
sertion Monday that the predicament had not yet
become critical.
He said that the administration is promoting, in
addition to voluntary conservation measures al
ready announced by Carter, shifts away from oil to
coal and natural gas by industries able to make

such conversions and diversion of large quantities
of natural gas from producing states into the in
terstate market.
Rights panel finds segregation
Washington — Nearly half the minority children
in America go to segregated schools, and Con
gress, the administration and the courts all seem
to have lost interest in doing much about it, the
U.S. Civil Rights Commission said yesterday.
The occasion for the commission's statement
was the 25th anniversary of the 1954 Supreme
Court decision outlawing segregation in the pub
lic schools. The commission report was critical of
Congress, the departments of Justice and Health,
Education and Welfare, and recent Supreme Court
decisions.
The commission has no enforcement power,
but is required by law to evaluate the status of
school desegregation across the nation from time
to time.
The report said the latest figures available indi
cated that 4.9 million minority children in the
country attend schools that are at least "moder
ately" segregated — and more of them are in the
Northeast and the North Central region of the
country than in the Deep South.
For the nation overall, 46 percent of minority
youngsters attend segregated schools, it said. In
the Northeast, 65 percent of minority children do,
and in the North Central region it is 68 percent, the
commission said. No figure was given for the
South alone.
Court stays Bhutto execution
Rawalpindi, Pakistan — The Pakistani Supreme
Court stayed the execution of former Prime Minis
ter Zulfikar Ali Bhutto yesterday for at least 10 days
while it makes a final judicial review of his convic
tion and death sentence on charges of conspiring
to murder a political opponent.
U.S. says CETA jobs unfilled
The Labor Department, which has money to
create more than 250,000.public-service jobs for
the long-term unemployed this year, says 150,000
slots are going unfilled because of tougher gov
ernment rules.
The number of people holding jobs under the
Comprehensive Employment and Training Act
plummeted by more than 200,000 last summer
amid threatened program cutbacks by Congress.
Now that Congress has extended the program for
another four years, the Labor Department says it is

encountering problems building the program up
again.
The department is casting blame for the prob
lems on Congress, citing delays in approval of new
financing for the $10-billion CETA programs and
tighter eligibility requirements ordered by Con
gress in an attempt to reduce fraud and other
abuses that have plagued them.
Winds lash Pacific Northwest
A storm packing winds up to 100 mph lashed the
Pacific Northwest yesterday, washing away a $24.6
million pontoon bridge, leaving tens of thousands
without power and killing at least one person.
In the frozen cities of the Northeast, plumbers
and policemen were kept busy patching broken
water pipes and trying to unscramble a logjam of
abandoned automobiles, the legacy of record
sub-zero temperatures and heavy snows.
But as the sun was peeking out in much of the
urban East, the Pacific Northwest's worst
windstorm in 17 years bore down on western Ore
gon and Washington, felling trees across power
lines and causing widespead flooding.
In Nevada, winds clocked as high as 58 mph at
Reno International Airport also knocked down
trees, damaged homes and touched off a number
of fires.
Elsewhere in the nation, heavy snow warnings
were posted in western Montana and snow was
scattered across North Dakota, the Great Lakes
and much of West Virginia.
Heavy fog disrupted air travel in Southern
California and made driving hazardous in parts of
Texas where visibiliy was less than one quarter of a
mile.
