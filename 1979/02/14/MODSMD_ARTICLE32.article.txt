# Trustees take first step to a new music library
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The first step toward getting a new
music library here was taken yester
day as the Academic Affairs Commit
tee of the Board of Trustees ap
proved a program that will provide
additional, temporary space for the
library until a permanent new facility
can be constructed.
The temporary facility, expected to
cost some $300,000, should be com
pleted this summer if final approval
for the project comes from the Lands
and Buildings and Finance and De
velopment Committees of the board.

Temporary facilities will include a
modular structure to be placed in the
south courtyard of the Knoll.
The 5000-square-foot addition will
include shelving space for 42,000
books and musical scores.
Final approval forthe project could
come next month.
The library, currently housed in
the Knoll, serves 200 faculty and stu
dents associated with the Music
Dept. According to a trustee
background report, the library's 3500
square feet are considered to be
"only 15 percent of the space
deemed necessary for an effective
library ..."
A permanent structure housing
Music Dept. facilities including a
new library, have been a high Uni
versity priority for years, according
to the report.
