Tehran, Iran (AP) â€” Scores of heav
ily armed Iranians stormed the U.S.
Embassy in downtown Tehran this
morning and after a prolonged gun
battle seized control of the com
pound and took 70 Americans pris
oner, a military spokesman said.
Meanwhile late AP report from
New Delhi, India stated that U.S.
Ambassador to Afghanistan Adolph
Dubs was killed in Kabul, Afghanis
tan today after being kidnapped by
members of a Moslem sect, accord
ing to the U.S. Embassy in New De
lhi.
Both early reports were sketchy.
In Tehran, the captured Americans
included the embassy's 20 Marine
guards and possibly Ambassador
William Sullivan, the spokesman
said.
He reported that forces loyal to
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the re
ligious leader of the Iranian revolu
tion, surrounded the embassy com
pound and were trying to negotiate
the release of the Americans, who
were being held inside.
Two Americans were believed
wounded in the attack, the spokes
man said.
Asked who he thought the attac
kers were, he replied: "They are
either the 10 percent that never got
the word or possibly a very leftist or
ganization."
Khomeini had repeatedly exhorted
the revolutionary forces not to attack
foreigners or their embassies.
No other details were available at
deadline.
