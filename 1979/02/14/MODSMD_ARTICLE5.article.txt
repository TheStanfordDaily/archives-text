# Geophysicist named earth sciences dean
## 
### 
Stanford Professor Allan Cox, a geophysicist known
for his research in plate tectonics, has been named dean
of the School of Earth Sciences here.
Cox's appointment was approved by the University
Board of Trustees yesterday.
Cox will replace current Uean Richard )ahns on Sept.
1. Cox was selected after a nationwide search was con
ducted by a faculty committee headed by Acting Provost
Gerald Lieberman.
Cox was a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Sur
vey in Menlo Park before joining the faculty here in 1961.
His research provided the basis fordecoding the magne
tic record of the sea floor, a breakthrough that set off a
revolution in the earth sciences.
The modern theory of geodynamics is that the earth's
crust is made up of plates of solid rock moving along the
earth's surface.
Cox assembled magnetic evidence of this movement
from the magnetic "grain"of rocks formed from lava, in
which certain minerals became magnetized by the

earth's magnetic field as they cooled.
Cox has received several scientific prizes and was
elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Cox has been active here having served as a resident
fellow in Trancos a member of the Associated Students
Task Force on Student Evaluation of Teaching, and fa
culty advisor for the Undergraduate Lights Project which
provides stage lighting for student dramatic perfor
mances.
He is currently president of the American Geophysical
Union. He has been considered in the past for several
other administrative posts in professional organizations
and institutions, according to a University News Service
press release.
last year, )ahns announced his intention to resign
effective Aug. 31 in order to return to teaching and
research.
Jahns will assume the endowed chair of Cook Profes
sor of Geology and Applied Earth Sciences.
