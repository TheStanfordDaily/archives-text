# Computer soon to teach intro Armenian

An Armenian-speaking, electronic
faculty member will join the Univer
sity staff next year. This member will
hold no office hours and will have an
even temperament if it receives ap
propriate commands.
This faculty member is a computer
which will teach "Beginning Arme
nian." The course will be offered for
the first time next fall quarter, Lin
guistics Prof. Clara Bush said. The
computer speaks to students and
also provides visual displays on the
terminal.
Without prior knowledge of a
computer language students will be
able to sit at a video-display terminal
and listen to computer-spoken
Armenian through headphones. The
computer will also display words and
sentences during the self-paced in
struction.
Computerized instruction is not
new here. Several courses in the
Philosophy Dept. including "Logic,"
"Set Theory," and "Foundations of
Probability" use computer instruc
tions. But foreign language instruc
tion has typically been given in a clas
sroom to provide feedback from a
human instructor, according to Larry
Markosian, research fellow here and
originator of the program.
Markosian said, "We can achieve a
tutorial setting that a student
wouldn't necessarily receive in a
classroom setting. For instance, in
the classroom the student is exposed
to the errors of students sitting

around him. This won't happen with
the computer system."
Markosian admits that correct
pronunciation and practice in speak
ing any language is necessary before
a student can begin to master gram
mar and conversation. For this
reason, an Armenian-speaking tutor
will work once a week on a orte-to
one basis with students enrolled in
the course.
"Students will then work with their
tutors on correct pronunciation of

Armenian and the tutorial sessions
will facilitate natural use of the lan
guage," Markosian said.
Armenian, an uncommon lan
guage, is an ideal language for adap
tation to a computer system, said
Markosian. Though he said he ex
pects less than 10 students here to
enroll in the course next fall, he be
lieves the development of com
puterized Armenian lessons is im
portant.
"There are both social and linguis

tic reasons for choosing Armenian,"
Markosian said. There are only a few
Armenian schools scattered
throughout the United States making
it difficult for the one million Ameri
cans of Armenian descent to pre
serve the Armenian language in the
United States, he said. 'A program
that can teach Armenian to these
students, whether they're elemen
tary or high school or college stu
dents will be useful," he said. "Be
