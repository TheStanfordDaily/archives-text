# Computer soon to teach intro Armenian
## 
### Emily Sachar 
An Armenian-speaking, electronic
faculty member will join the Univer
sity staff next year. This member will
hold no office hours and will have an
even temperament if it receives ap
propriate commands.
This faculty member is a computer
which will teach "Beginning Arme
nian." The course will be offered for
the first time next fall quarter, Lin
guistics Prof. Clara Bush said. The
computer speaks to students and
also provides visual displays on the
terminal.
Without prior knowledge of a
computer language students will be
able to sit at a video-display terminal
and listen to computer-spoken
Armenian through headphones. The
computer will also display words and
sentences during the self-paced in
struction.
Computerized instruction is not
new here. Several courses in the
Philosophy Dept. including "Logic,"
"Set Theory," and "Foundations of
Probability" use computer instruc
tions. But foreign language instruc
tion has typically been given in a clas
sroom to provide feedback from a
human instructor, according to Larry
Markosian, research fellow here and
originator of the program.
Markosian said, "We can achieve a
tutorial setting that a student
wouldn't necessarily receive in a
classroom setting. For instance, in
the classroom the student is exposed
to the errors of students sitting

around him. This won't happen with
the computer system."
Markosian admits that correct
pronunciation and practice in speak
ing any language is necessary before
a student can begin to master gram
mar and conversation. For this
reason, an Armenian-speaking tutor
will work once a week on a orte-to
one basis with students enrolled in
the course.
"Students will then work with their
tutors on correct pronunciation of

Armenian and the tutorial sessions
will facilitate natural use of the lan
guage," Markosian said.
Armenian, an uncommon lan
guage, is an ideal language for adap
tation to a computer system, said
Markosian. Though he said he ex
pects less than 10 students here to
enroll in the course next fall, he be
lieves the development of com
puterized Armenian lessons is im
portant.
"There are both social and linguis

tic reasons for choosing Armenian,"
Markosian said. There are only a few
Armenian schools scattered
throughout the United States making
it difficult for the one million Ameri
cans of Armenian descent to pre
serve the Armenian language in the
United States, he said. 'A program
that can teach Armenian to these
students, whether they're elemen
tary or high school or college stu
dents will be useful," he said. "Be
sides, computers are in daily use all
over the country and the price of the
equipment is much less than it used
to be," Markosian added.
"Armenian is simple and regular
enough to program the computer to
accurately check students' errors.
Students can be allowed a wide
range of correct answers without
making the program too dificult,"
Markosian said.
"But machine understanding of
natural language is a very difficult
question. We can solve only a frag
ment now," he added.
Ordinarily, students interested in
learning "esoteric or uncommonly"
taught languages, must indicate their
desire for instruction to Linguistics
Lectureer Gerald Lind, Markosian
said. Lind then tries to find a person
in the community who spoke the
language fluently and was also capa
ble of teaching it.
"But a lack of available tutors has
meant that Stanford has not had an
Armenian program of this type,"
Markosian said.
Funding for the new program is
coming from private sources
throughout the United States. To
date, only $65,000 of the $300,000
needed for developing the program
over the next three years has been
pledged, Markosian said.
