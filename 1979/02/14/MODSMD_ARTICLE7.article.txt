### Kathleen Gilroy 
Shirley Temple Black, former U.S. ambassador to
Ghana, criticized the U.S. government for its failure to
stimulate the economy of Ghana in a talk given yesterday
before an audience of 100 persons at the Bechtel Inter
national Center.
She said the United States failed to clarify certain
commodity trade agreements it had with Ghana, espe
cially with respect to cocoa.
The former child film star said Ghana lacks access to
international capital. She said Ghana needs to have a
healthy market economy in order to counter Soviet in
fluence in Africa.
Black said Soviet personnel in Ghana already number
230, and the Soviets wield considerable influence in the
Ghanaian press.
Black said the People's Republic of China is also gain
ing influence in Ghana. She speculated that "Ghana may
become a pivotal base for the People's Republic in the
area. As the People's Republic captures sympathy, U.S.

interest is eroded."
Black said her appointment to the ambassadorship
brought criticism that she was not qualified. She pointed
to her experience as a U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations in 1%9 and as an administrative assistant under
former President Richard Nixon.
Black said she felt she was well-briefed before she
went to Ghana. One Ghanaian who attended the lecture
attested to her excellent preparation saying that Black
"related to the Ghanaian people in a personal way" and
provided an important link between the two cultures.
Black said her mission in Ghana was to assist U.S.
business there. She said she tried to develop a relation
ship from which the Ghanaian people could benefit.
Black said she had contributed to American policy in
Africa by helping "Ghanaian government officials un
derstand my government's policies."
Black said, "I look forward to the opportunity when
(President) Jimmy (Carter) goes back to the farm. I will
get to serve again."
