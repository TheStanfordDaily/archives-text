# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Nelle Byrne Shower heads matter 
### 
Students are riled about their old shower
heads being replaced. Students are brazenly
saying that they don't like the feel of the things,
and I think that's good.
These students don't like the approach that
someone or thing or system or policy is taking to
their undergraduate life—even if no one knows
exactly where that attitude germinates from—
and they are protesting by letting the water end
lessly run.
It matters that these students are making
themselves heard, and it matters more that they
are heard and not trivialized. They are making a
concrete statement about the approach to un
dergraduate life around here.
Yes, I like the red tile roofs that take slow
flame in the rain and the rhythm the arches keep
with me walking through the corridors of the
Quad. I even like the hip bones that stick up
ridiculously naked out in front of the Art De
partment. Butit'staken mefouryears to feel it —
the University is beautiful and even, at times,
funny. But I also see the University as compla
cent and rude to the concept of student interac
tion in undergraduate life.
Yes, I appreciate the parking lots — they've
noticeably improved in four years. I appreciate
the new Education School, the spiffy Law School
and the better-than-par Terman Engineering
building. The remodeled Bookstore, the three
new Row houses — they're nice. But what about
the approach to undergraduate life in the last
few years?
Along with contending with construction
noise every year, I've been shovelled from Stern
Hall to the tin-can, thin-walled trailers to one
brief quarter in a too-crowded triple in Storey,
back to Stern Hall and then the tin-can trailers
again — contending with a draw system that
looks sort of democratic on paper. But its wheel
is really turned by a priority system or a sort of
privilege based on luck and design.
Forget that I wanted an education and did not
know what it was. Forget that I entered college
picking books out by color, illiterate of the
Dewey decimal system, not knowing how to
punctuate and never having written a term
paper in high school. I did not even know if I was
"pre-law" or "pre-med," if I wanted to focus in
the sciences or the humanities.

Forget my adviser for my first two years here.
Fhat adviser, who made me feel I was some sort
of manipulative femme fatale, was so blind he
could not see that I saw him as older and hand
some and ever so schoolgirl-crushedly idolized.
I was just a gurgling girl terribly confused about
life and school and my place in both. I was in
need of an adviser.
One of the best things about the University is
that it lets you graciously come back after you've
done yourself in.
And I did myself in, but still I wish the Univer
sity had been a little less institution and a little
more college. Because the system does not
check up on you. It really doesn't. And it you
give up on yourself — that's it.
Okay, perhaps I've been too sensitive, but I'c
bet I'm not unique. Perhaps I did not quite know
how toclaim my spot, assert myself against rude
souls, make the system work and extract my due
from an institution.
Last week I turned around grateful to a profes
sor for holding me to the line for not letting me
rip myself off again with another sloppy, half
hearted effort. A bit incredulous, she replied,
"Isn't that what the implicit contract between a
student and a teacher is all about?"
Epiphany — there stood a teacher. And I
laughed. That's what I had given up expecting in
all those classes of hundreds in chemistry, his
tory, physics, human biology and psychology.
And that's the source of the tide of grumbling
resentment surging inside me, grating against
all my efforts here.
I think Stanford, though, seriously owes its
paying undergraduates a little more allegiance.
It matters that one can graduate from Stanford
never proving his or her intellectual integrity.
It matters that this school lacks a thriving so
cial center, that Tresidder Union is more a transi
tion for noon-hour traffic than an interacting
space for people to spill into and chat comforta
bly anytime.
It matters that there is a shortage of housing —
an impending crisis they've been aware of for
years — especially when there is land to be built
on.
Shower heads matter.
