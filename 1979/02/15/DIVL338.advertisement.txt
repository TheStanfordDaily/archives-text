More Quality
Look at our selection. Our inventory of over 60 brands
all carefully chosen from manufacturers with proven
track records. Since our reputation is at stake, every
component has to sell us first —on superb sound and
excellent value.
More Convenience
There's a professional Service Department in every
Pacific Stereo store (except Goleta, California). Our
trained technicians work with over $7000 worth of
advanced testing equipment. They keep a large supply
of replacement parts on hand and receive daily
deliveries from our $1,000,000 parts inventory. That
adds up to fast repairs... in an average of only 3 1 /2 days,
whether you bought your equipment from us or not.
More Service
Each professional Pacific Stereo salesperson has spent
two solid weeks in the classroom... and four weeks
training in the store. They can answer your questions
easily... because they've learned the answers. They'll
show you our Listening Rooms, where you can compare
components side-by-side. And when you buy, they'll
help you with the extras you may need, like easy-to
follow set-up directions and all the speaker wire you
need... Free.
