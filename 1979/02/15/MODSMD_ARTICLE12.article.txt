## Skiing â€“ glamorous myths dashed 
### 
So here comes the big ski weekend.
Even if you can't remember whether we
have Monday off because George
Washington was born or because Leland
Stanford died, it's probably not going to
influence your fun. It's February, mid
terms are over and Tahoe is only four
hours away.
Skiing is a snob sport. Its golden aura is
bright enough to shine on any participant,
from the fledgling weekender to world
class racers. However, I'd like to shatter a
few myths about skiii*g. It is a sport which
can be, at times, as glamorous and exciting
as a flat tire on the New Jersey turnpike.
Part of the aura around skiing is a direct
result of the fact that it costs money, and
lots of it. And, unfortunately, it's not any
cheaper if you're just a beginner. It costs
as much to spend an afternoon falling off
the rope tow on the bunny slope as it does
to ski the fresh powder of the expert runs.
You still must pay for clothes, lift tickets,
equipment, lodging, transportation and
over-priced meals "on the mountain."
If this doesn't phase you, you've proba
bly got enough rocks in your head to have
ski potential. The first thing to make you
feel at home on the slopes is a new ski
outfit. Although truly "cool" skiers tend to
dress down in jeans, down vests and heavy
sweaters, there is a commercially encour
aged "ski chic."
The primary requirement of ski wear is
that it be tacky. Some skiers accomplish
this with a single garment, such as purple

and yellow quilted overalls. Others prefer
to combine several items into a per
sonalized look.
Lift lines bring out a fundamental truth
of skiing today: you can't ski if you don't
like people. Not five or 10, but one or two
hundred everywhere you look. The ski in
dustry is booming. No one ever described
a weekend at Squaw Valley as "getting
away from it all."
The basic objective of skiing is to get
down the hill, but skiers have developed
an infinite variety of methods to achieve
this end. These "styles" are a direct reflec
tion of the skier's ability, arrogance and
nerve.
The most dramatic skiers are those with
nerve and ability. They barrel down the
slopes "free style," with kamikaze en
thusiasm.
At least they are in it for the fun of it. A
more annoying group is made up of
arrogant skiers. Usually characterized by
overworked flair, these skiers cut you off,
then spray snow in your face as you zoom
recklessly into the trees.
The least objectionable types are the
"mom" skiers. Picture the typical 40-
year-old housewife out on the slopes of
the Sierras, and you'll know what I mean.
Overriding caution makes mom skiers the
only people who will devote their entire
skiing careers to perfecting the snow
plow.
The final group is the skiers of tomor
row, those demonic Nastar punks. These

little kids, the product of skiing parents,
are usually racing by age five. It is in the
best interest of your ego to ignore them.
Sometime during your first day on the
slopes, you'll probably realize that you
could ski better if you took a lesson. If you
have a choice of teachers, always pick the
short, scrawny, dark-haired guy over the
tall, blond, Swedish sun god. It's pretty
safe to assume that the short guy got hired
because he can teach.
Private lessons are infinitely better than
group lessons. The typical group lesson
consists of an instructor swishing smooth
turns down the slope with the class, in
line, "following right in his path." It usu
ally takes the line of students a good 15
seconds to disintegrate into a zigzagging
mass of colliding bodies. This type of
nerve-racking experience is not likely to
increase your confidence or your ability.
A final element you must deal with in
skiing is the conditions. Skiers must learn
each condition and the proper complaint
about its adverse effect on your skiing.
If it's icy, you say you are having trouble
with control. If there are rocks, they're
destroying the bottoms of yoUr skis. And
so on. Make sure to mention these prob
lems casually but loudly in the lift line.
People who see you plummeting down the
hill will know that you're just not skiing
your best that day.
