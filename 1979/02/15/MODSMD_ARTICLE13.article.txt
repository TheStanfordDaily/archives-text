'Little Eleven'
farce
Student leaders here re
cently missed a golden oppor
tunity to make a much-needed
statement on elitism. The "Lit
tle Eleven" conference is a
farce — nothing more than a
slumber party for snobs.
But did Stanford name it for
what it was? No. The Ivy League
summoned us, and we came
running just like the mindless
group of beach bums they
think we are.
In their opinion (Daily, Feb.
2), Harrington and Golden
kranz stated that the confer
ence is "designed to enable
undergraduates from schools
which compete for students

and faculty, and look to each
other for guidance in develop
ing policy, to meet in an at
tempt to develop a cohesive
student viewpoint on a wide
collection of issues."
The logic behind this design
escapes me. If it is a discussion
of common interests they're
after, then why don't we meet
with UC-Berkeley, Cal Tech,
UCLA and the Claremont
schools?
Could it possibly be that we
have more in common with
Dartmouth and Brown than we
do with these California
schools? Of course not. We
just couldn't turn down the
opportunity to rub el bows with
the prestigious Ivy Leaguers.
Stanford could have dealt a
sharp blow to the inflated egos

back East by branding this exc
lusive party as the insult to the
rest of the country that it is. But
our leaders failed to recognize
the glaring fact that this get
together, condescendingly ti
tled the "Little Eleven" confer
ence, is a national snub.
And what about Harrington
and Coldenkranz's grand goal
of "developing a cohesive stu
dent viewpoint"? Is this mean
ingless verbiage cause enough
to trapse all the way across the
country at the expense of our
school? Don't we have more
pressing needs right here on
campus?
The "Little Eleven" confer
ence is nothing more than an
opportunity for Stanford's stu
dent politicos to share their
narrow view at a highly rarefied

conclave.
In the future, I would
suggest that they consult the
student body before venturing
out to represent us. If they had
done so this time, they would
have discovered that their ac
tions are not universally con
doned.

A blend of pity and anger
surged through me as I read
Linda Hardesty's column
(Daily, Feb. 6) advocating the
delivery of mail to dormitories
— pity for the twisted nature of

Hardesty's values and anger at
the possibility of her propros
als acceptance by the au
thorities.
Hardesty's argument culmi
nates in the statement that the
University "is shirking one of
its responsibilities (that of de
livering mail at dorms) just as if
it were refusing to provide heat
or electricity in the dorms."
This may be true but what
she has sadly forgotten is the
desirability of a post office box
as a theurapeutic and social en
tity. These two functions in my
opinion far outweigh the sav
ings of a few dollars.
When I lived in a dorm my
P.O. Box was my refuge, my
security away from 59
dormmates. Finding myself dis
gusted with my room, my
roommate and my dormmates
(as I periodically was) I would
plunge into the outside world
heading nowhere in particular.
Invariably my feet would
lead me to the post office. Bre
athing a little fresh air, seeing
the stars, and checking my box
greatly calmed me. It gave me
time to tune myself back into
the social world.
Of course, one can say that
the walk, not the box was re
sponsible for my recovery. This
is true but fails to recognize the
aesthetics of the situation. The
mere existence of the box en
sured a destination.
And which of us, strolling or
cycling across White Plaza at
noon can help but notice, and
at times be sucked into, the
inane but enjoyable social sea
that swirls around the post of
fice.
Yet, with a squirt of the pen,
Hardesty wishes to destroy this
venerable institution and with
it all its intangible by-products
only to save a few dollars.

UCLA and the Claremont
schools?
Could it possibly be that we
have more in common with
Dartmouth and Brown than we
do with these California
schools? Of course not. We
just couldn't turn down the
opportunity to rub el bows with
the prestigious Ivy Leaguers.
Stanford could have dealt a
sharp blow to the inflated egos

back East by branding this exc
lusive party as the insult to the
rest of the country that it is. But
our leaders failed to recognize
the glaring fact that this get
together, condescendingly ti
tled the "Little Eleven" confer
ence, is a national snub.
And what about Harrington
and Coldenkranz's grand goal
of "developing a cohesive stu
dent viewpoint"? Is this mean
ingless verbiage cause enough
to trapse all the way across the
country at the expense of our
school? Don't we have more
pressing needs right here on
campus?
The "Little Eleven" confer
ence is nothing more than an
opportunity for Stanford's stu
dent politicos to share their
narrow view at a highly rarefied

conclave.
In the future, I would
suggest that they consult the
student body before venturing
out to represent us. If they had
done so this time, they would
have discovered that their ac
tions are not universally con
doned.

A blend of pity and anger
surged through me as I read
Linda Hardesty's column
(Daily, Feb. 6) advocating the
delivery of mail to dormitories
— pity for the twisted nature of

Hardesty's values and anger at
the possibility of her propros
als acceptance by the au
thorities.
Hardesty's argument culmi
nates in the statement that the
University "is shirking one of
its responsibilities (that of de
livering mail at dorms) just as if
it were refusing to provide heat
or electricity in the dorms."
This may be true but what
she has sadly forgotten is the
desirability of a post office box
as a theurapeutic and social en
tity. These two functions in my
opinion far outweigh the sav
ings of a few dollars.
When I lived in a dorm my
P.O. Box was my refuge, my
security away from 59
dormmates. Finding myself dis
gusted with my room, my
roommate and my dormmates
(as I periodically was) I would
plunge into the outside world
heading nowhere in particular.
Invariably my feet would
lead me to the post office. Bre
athing a little fresh air, seeing
the stars, and checking my box
greatly calmed me. It gave me
time to tune myself back into
the social world.
Of course, one can say that
the walk, not the box was re
sponsible for my recovery. This
is true but fails to recognize the
aesthetics of the situation. The
mere existence of the box en
sured a destination.
And which of us, strolling or
cycling across White Plaza at
noon can help but notice, and
at times be sucked into, the
inane but enjoyable social sea
that swirls around the post of
fice.
Yet, with a squirt of the pen,
Hardesty wishes to destroy this
venerable institution and with
it all its intangible by-products
only to save a few dollars.

'Little Eleven'
farce
Student leaders here re
cently missed a golden oppor
tunity to make a much-needed
statement on elitism. The "Lit
tle Eleven" conference is a
farce — nothing more than a
slumber party for snobs.
But did Stanford name it for
what it was? No. The Ivy League
summoned us, and we came
running just like the mindless
group of beach bums they
think we are.
In their opinion (Daily, Feb.
2), Harrington and Golden
kranz stated that the confer
ence is "designed to enable
undergraduates from schools
which compete for students

and faculty, and look to each
other for guidance in develop
ing policy, to meet in an at
tempt to develop a cohesive
student viewpoint on a wide
collection of issues."
The logic behind this design
escapes me. If it is a discussion
of common interests they're
after, then why don't we meet
with UC-Berkeley, Cal Tech,
UCLA and the Claremont
schools?
Could it possibly be that we
have more in common with
Dartmouth and Brown than we
do with these California
schools? Of course not. We
just couldn't turn down the
opportunity to rub el bows with
the prestigious Ivy Leaguers.
