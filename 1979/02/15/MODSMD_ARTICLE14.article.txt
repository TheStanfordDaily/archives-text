## Proposed senate reforms unwise 
### 
Reading both the majority and minority
editorials (Daily, Feb. 8), I got the feeling
that both the Daily and the Election Review
Board will grab at any suggestion to "re
form" ASSU senate election procedures.
However there are still doubts in my
mind that any of the proposed solutions is
just and workable. None of them purport
to solve the overwhelming problem of
voter apathy.
Live petition is a patently terrible idea. It
will result in a senate made up of at most
two or three senators being "elected" to
serve. They will be representatives of any
small clique or pressure group that bands
together to promote its own self-interest.
Furthermore, I believe that it will violate
the basic tenet of equal representation for
undergraduates and graduates, since
graduate students will be less inclined to
get involved in such foolishness.
Districting, wiiile altruistic iri its mo
tives, promises a bureaucratic nightmare
that will increase the cost of ASSU elec
tions significantly. Can you imagine ballot
boxes in each of 10 or 20 undergraduate
residential districts and enough people to
watch the polling places? How are elec
tions for graduate senators to be handled?
These problems pale besides the prob
lem of drawing districts to assure "one
man, one vote." There is always the possi
bility of gerry mandering. What will prob
ably happen is that a plethora of candi
dates will wind up in one district with a
dearth of candidates in another. The latter
district will go unrepresented at senate
elections.
Proposals to stagger elections of

senators and to outlaw slates are superfi
cial and cosmetic in nature. The only way
to outlaw slates is to prevent a candidate
from putting any other candidate's name
on his flyers aside from his own.
All of these proposals strike me as being
a knee-jerk reaction to the perceived
abuses that occurred two years ago. Such
abuse is within the jurisdiction of the Elec
tions commissioner. It should not result
in a rewrite of the Constitution. Instead we
need proposals that will rekindle student
interest in the senate.
One suggestion is an anachronism that
very few other student bodies have incor
porated into their election laws. Were it
not for the write-in ban, the senate may
have found enough alternate graduate
senators to fill this year's vacancies.
The only argument against write-ins that
I have heard is that cases like the Caryn
Jacobs nomination would be more preva
lent — candidates might be elected who
would not want to serve. The Caryn Jacobs
case however was a case of election fraud,
not abuse of write-in privileges. A dedi
cated elections commissioner can make
sure that Mickey Mouse doesn't get
elected.
Another suggestion might be to enact a
form of mandatory democracy that is prac
ticed in certain European nations. Require
students to vote in either the fall or spring
elections. If a student fails to vote, a $5
assessment can be levied by the ASSU
against that student, payable at registra
tion. Sure-this might raise the libertarians'
hackles, but a lot more students will turn
out to vote (or the ASSU will get wealthy).

By far the best reform is one that can
occur only in the offices of the Daily. Do
something about your miserable election
coverage. The least I expect from you is a
profile of all the candidates and all issues
on election day. A good newspaper would
have coverage of a candidate's activities
and positions, and would try to encourage
spirited debate. All we got from you last
fall was some cryptic endorsements, your
presence at KZSU's Campus Confer
ence, and a lot of CRAP. You reform your
end and we'll reform ours.

dent in civil engineering. He is an ASSU
senator.)
Editor's note: Our "miserable" coverage
last fall was considerably more extensive
than you allege. Furthermore, those wil
ling may review autumn-quarter Daily is
sues of past years. You will find, I believe, a
number of these profiles" on one or two
full pages, all of which are, in simple lan
guage, nondescript. The reason they are
banal is that senate candidates tradition
ally have had a great deal of nothing to say.
For that reason, the decision was made
to dispense with the waste of space this
year. Extensive profile coverage is given to
Council of President slates every spring as
well as all appeals for fee assessments.
It has and will continue to be the Daily
policy that no profiles or candidate state
ments will run on election days. Such copy
only opens the door to criticism that the
Daily is trying to influence the election by
our choice of placement of such material.

Reading both the majority and minority
editorials (Daily, Feb. 8), I got the feeling
that both the Daily and the Election Review
Board will grab at any suggestion to "re
form" ASSU senate election procedures.
However there are still doubts in my
mind that any of the proposed solutions is
just and workable. None of them purport
to solve the overwhelming problem of
voter apathy.
Live petition is a patently terrible idea. It
will result in a senate made up of at most
two or three senators being "elected" to
serve. They will be representatives of any
small clique or pressure group that bands
together to promote its own self-interest.
Furthermore, I believe that it will violate
the basic tenet of equal representation for
undergraduates and graduates, since
graduate students will be less inclined to
get involved in such foolishness.
Districting, wiiile altruistic iri its mo
tives, promises a bureaucratic nightmare
that will increase the cost of ASSU elec
tions significantly. Can you imagine ballot
boxes in each of 10 or 20 undergraduate
residential districts and enough people to
watch the polling places? How are elec
tions for graduate senators to be handled?
These problems pale besides the prob
lem of drawing districts to assure "one
man, one vote." There is always the possi
bility of gerry mandering. What will prob
ably happen is that a plethora of candi
dates will wind up in one district with a
dearth of candidates in another. The latter
district will go unrepresented at senate
elections.
Proposals to stagger elections of

senators and to outlaw slates are superfi
cial and cosmetic in nature. The only way
to outlaw slates is to prevent a candidate
from putting any other candidate's name
on his flyers aside from his own.
All of these proposals strike me as being
a knee-jerk reaction to the perceived
abuses that occurred two years ago. Such
abuse is within the jurisdiction of the Elec
tions commissioner. It should not result
in a rewrite of the Constitution. Instead we
need proposals that will rekindle student
interest in the senate.
One suggestion is an anachronism that
very few other student bodies have incor
porated into their election laws. Were it
not for the write-in ban, the senate may
have found enough alternate graduate
senators to fill this year's vacancies.
The only argument against write-ins that
I have heard is that cases like the Caryn
Jacobs nomination would be more preva
lent — candidates might be elected who
would not want to serve. The Caryn Jacobs
case however was a case of election fraud,
not abuse of write-in privileges. A dedi
cated elections commissioner can make
sure that Mickey Mouse doesn't get
elected.
Another suggestion might be to enact a
form of mandatory democracy that is prac
ticed in certain European nations. Require
students to vote in either the fall or spring
elections. If a student fails to vote, a $5
assessment can be levied by the ASSU
against that student, payable at registra
tion. Sure-this might raise the libertarians'
hackles, but a lot more students will turn
out to vote (or the ASSU will get wealthy).

By far the best reform is one that can
occur only in the offices of the Daily. Do
something about your miserable election
coverage. The least I expect from you is a
profile of all the candidates and all issues
on election day. A good newspaper would
have coverage of a candidate's activities
and positions, and would try to encourage
spirited debate. All we got from you last
fall was some cryptic endorsements, your
presence at KZSU's Campus Confer
ence, and a lot of CRAP. You reform your
end and we'll reform ours.
(Geoff Baskir is a first-year graduate stu
dent in civil engineering. He is an ASSU
senator.)
Editor's note: Our "miserable" coverage
last fall was considerably more extensive
than you allege. Furthermore, those wil
ling may review autumn-quarter Daily is
sues of past years. You will find, I believe, a
number of these profiles" on one or two
full pages, all of which are, in simple lan
guage, nondescript. The reason they are
banal is that senate candidates tradition
ally have had a great deal of nothing to say.
For that reason, the decision was made
to dispense with the waste of space this
year. Extensive profile coverage is given to
Council of President slates every spring as
well as all appeals for fee assessments.
