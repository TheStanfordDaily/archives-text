# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Chris Gray U.S. foreign policy inept 
### 
Last week, former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger at
tacked the Carter administra
tion for not intervening in Iran.
He went on to complain about
the "emasculation" of U.S.
foreign policy.
We can all be sure that Kis
singer has "balls": there are
thousands of dead Vietnamese
to prove it. Potent or not, U.S.
foreign policy, unfortunately,
is still based on the premises
that led to Vietnam: 1) coun
tries can do what they like in
ternally as long as the United
States approves 2) if we want it
— it's ours.
Iran demonstrates these
premises. The collapse of the
U.S.-sponsored regime of
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi
under waves of popular revolt,
has been continually lamented
by the Carter administration.
It is impossible to explain
this upsurge as a right-wing
reaction to the glorious White
Revolution which left the
country as disease-ridden and
illiterate as before — but with
more guns and less oil. In
stead, the new themes in the
United States are: "They've
stolen our oil" and "Those
Russians have done it again."
Why we should think it is our
oil is beyond reasonable exp
lanation. The United States set
up the shah in 1953 with a CIA
coup and spent the next 25
years selling him sophisticated
weapons to play with. That
Americans can be outraged by
Russian statements that the
Soviet Union has a legitimate
interest in what happens on its
border is a triumph of hypoc
risy.
The United States is now de
sperately trying to stave off a
similar "tragedy" in Nicaragua.
The rule of the Somozas has
reached its logical conclusion
—revolution. Despite recent at
tempts to disassociate itself
from Somoza, the United
States cannot rewrite the last 50
years of history. West Point
educated Somoza is as Ameri
can as apple pie.
Why does the United States

continually foster right-wing
dictators such as the shah and
Somoza? One reason is cold
pragmatism. In light of the U.S.
economic role in the underde
veloped world, only dictators
dependent on U.S. support
will allow it to continue.
Former U.S. President Lyn
don Johnson put it bluntly
when he said "We are out
numbered 15 to one. If might
did make right they would
sweep over the United States
and take what we have. We
have what they want."
Actually, for the United
States, might does make right.
We continually intervene in
other countries' affairs and
maintain military bases around
the world. When Johnson says
"We have what they want," he
is only partially correct. We
"have" Middle East oil,
Jamaican bauxite, most heavy
industry in Latin America,
Mexican vegetables and so on.
We may be outraged that
these foreigners could dare
want what we consume so
well. But such outrage has
made little difference in Iran
and Nicaragua. In fact locals
there have tended to show a
little irritation toward the Un
ited States lately.
Another key component of
present U.S. foreign policy is
stupidity. Kissinger's actions
exemplify this. In 1969, he di
rected the development of a
new Southern Africa policy
that was outlined in National
Security Study Memorandum
39. Five premises led the memo
to conclude that the white re

gimes in Southern Africa were
stable and should receive U.S.
support.
None of the study's five
major assumptions have
proven correct. For example,
the assumption that the Por
tuguese colonies would re
main under white control was
shattered just a few years later.
Kissinger's decision to support
the white regimes of Southern
Africa because they seemed so
stable, was based more on
wishful thinking than on sound
analysis. Carter's Iran policy
looks much the same.
The spreading collapse of
"pax-American" is of more
than academic interest to us
all. The deepening energy
crisis, the return of the draft
and the increasing danger of
nuclear war can all be traced to
the same policy that brought us
to Vietnam.
The greatest danger to world
peace is the collapsing empire
of the United States. No doubt
the United States will intervene
to protect Western civilization.
After all, who has ever admit
ted to invading another coun
try for selfish reasons?
Studying our own imperial
history we find one selfish in
vasion after another, starting
with the genocide of the native
Americans. We can be sure
that our next war will be a
noble one. This may prove a
cold comfort to those who
fight it.

is only partially correct. We
"have" Middle East oil,
Jamaican bauxite, most heavy
industry in Latin America,
Mexican vegetables and so on.
We may be outraged that
these foreigners could dare
want what we consume so
well. But such outrage has
made little difference in Iran
and Nicaragua. In fact locals
there have tended to show a
little irritation toward the Un
ited States lately.
Another key component of
present U.S. foreign policy is
stupidity. Kissinger's actions
exemplify this. In 1969, he di
rected the development of a
new Southern Africa policy
that was outlined in National
Security Study Memorandum
39. Five premises led the memo
to conclude that the white re

gimes in Southern Africa were
stable and should receive U.S.
support.
None of the study's five
major assumptions have
proven correct. For example,
the assumption that the Por
tuguese colonies would re
main under white control was
shattered just a few years later.
Kissinger's decision to support
the white regimes of Southern
Africa because they seemed so
stable, was based more on
wishful thinking than on sound
analysis. Carter's Iran policy
looks much the same.
The spreading collapse of
"pax-American" is of more
than academic interest to us
all. The deepening energy
crisis, the return of the draft
and the increasing danger of
nuclear war can all be traced to
the same policy that brought us
to Vietnam.
The greatest danger to world
peace is the collapsing empire
of the United States. No doubt
the United States will intervene
to protect Western civilization.
After all, who has ever admit
ted to invading another coun
try for selfish reasons?
Studying our own imperial
history we find one selfish in
vasion after another, starting
with the genocide of the native
Americans. We can be sure
that our next war will be a
noble one. This may prove a
cold comfort to those who
fight it.

Last week, former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger at
tacked the Carter administra
tion for not intervening in Iran.
He went on to complain about
the "emasculation" of U.S.
foreign policy.
We can all be sure that Kis
singer has "balls": there are
thousands of dead Vietnamese
to prove it. Potent or not, U.S.
foreign policy, unfortunately,
is still based on the premises
that led to Vietnam: 1) coun
tries can do what they like in
ternally as long as the United
States approves 2) if we want it
— it's ours.
Iran demonstrates these
premises. The collapse of the
U.S.-sponsored regime of
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi
under waves of popular revolt,
has been continually lamented
by the Carter administration.
It is impossible to explain
this upsurge as a right-wing
reaction to the glorious White
Revolution which left the
country as disease-ridden and
illiterate as before — but with
more guns and less oil. In
stead, the new themes in the
United States are: "They've
stolen our oil" and "Those
Russians have done it again."
Why we should think it is our
oil is beyond reasonable exp
lanation. The United States set
up the shah in 1953 with a CIA
coup and spent the next 25
years selling him sophisticated
weapons to play with. That
Americans can be outraged by
Russian statements that the
Soviet Union has a legitimate
interest in what happens on its
border is a triumph of hypoc
risy.
The United States is now de
sperately trying to stave off a
similar "tragedy" in Nicaragua.
The rule of the Somozas has
reached its logical conclusion
—revolution. Despite recent at
tempts to disassociate itself
from Somoza, the United
States cannot rewrite the last 50
years of history. West Point
educated Somoza is as Ameri
can as apple pie.
Why does the United States

continually foster right-wing
dictators such as the shah and
Somoza? One reason is cold
pragmatism. In light of the U.S.
economic role in the underde
veloped world, only dictators
dependent on U.S. support
will allow it to continue.
Former U.S. President Lyn
don Johnson put it bluntly
when he said "We are out
numbered 15 to one. If might
did make right they would
sweep over the United States
and take what we have. We
have what they want."
Actually, for the United
States, might does make right.
We continually intervene in
other countries' affairs and
maintain military bases around
the world. When Johnson says
"We have what they want," he
is only partially correct. We
"have" Middle East oil,
Jamaican bauxite, most heavy
industry in Latin America,
Mexican vegetables and so on.
