## Women's network 
### 
(Sixth of a series)
On October 25, 1978 the
Stanford Committee on Educa
tion and Employment of
Women (CEEW) published an
article in Campus Report
which began, "At Stanford, as
elsewhere, women need more
self-confidence in making
career choices." This news
should be of concern to every
woman student at Stanford, yet
most are unaware of it.
One of the primary respon
sibilities of Stanford's "Little
Eleven" Committee on Wo
men's Affairs is to work to in
form Stanford women about
issues such as those covered in
the CEEW report. The commit
tee has focused on ten basic
issue areas. These are educa
tion employment, support ser
vices, health services, security,
housing, extracurricular ac
tivities, the Equal Rights
Amendment, gay rights and
grievance procedures.
Various women's organiza
tions on campus currently ad
dress one or a number of wo
men's issues. However there is
a severe lack of coordination
and communication between
the groups.
The Women's Affairs Com
mittee hopes to establish a
network between organiza
tions by informing each of the
goals and activities of the
others. In this way, energy and
resources directed toward the

same problem can be consoli
dated for more effective ac
tion.
In addition, the committee
has been compiling informa
tion on all 10 areas. Committee
members are attempting to
highlight innovative and suc
cessful ways Stanford has dealt
with certain women's issues as
well as areas where change and
new approaches are needed.
At the conference we can offer
models from our own experi
ence and gain input from the
experience of other univer
sities.
We also seek to establish a
more permanent communica
tion network between schools.
Women at the Little Eleven
schools face many of the same
problems arising within an
elite academic environment.
We hope to work together to
create a learning environment
more responsive to, and sup
portive of, the needs of wo
men.
In order to gain a fuller un
derstanding of what are the
most important issues facing
women at Stanford, we wel
come input concerning per
sonal experiences or know
ledge of resources available.
