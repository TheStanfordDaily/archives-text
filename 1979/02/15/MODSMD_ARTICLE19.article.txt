# Mono afflicts 200 students yearly
## 
### Sheryl Davis 
Maybe you've heard a friend
say he's got it — the scourge of
college campuses and the de
stroyer of less hardy college
students.
Infectious mononucleosis
will be contracted by 200 stu
dents here this year, according
to Dr. David Torin of Cowell
Sudent Health Center.
Mono is a common disease
— an easy one to catch and an
easy one to recover from. But
it's also one that has developed
a lot of misconceptions.
Its nickname, the kissing
disease, is only partially true,
Torin said. Mono is caused by a
virus and appears to be trans
mitted through saliva. It can
also be transmitted through
other body fluids, such as
blood. The Stanford Red Cross
Blood Center said they require
a six-month period after a per
son contracts mono before he
can donate blood again.

Torin said that it's hard to tell
how long a person remains
contagious. The virus has been
found in a person's mouth for
as long as a year and a half.
"You are most contagious dur
ing the time of active illness,
but the virus has a potential for
lingering," Torin said.
Mild for children
People should not lose sleep
worrying about mono, he said.
Torin estimated that 80 percent
of an entering freshman class
has aleady had mono. He
explained that if a person con
tracts mono as a child, the dis
ease is very mild. A person
might not know he had it, or it
may have seemed just like a
cold, Torin said.
After a person has had it
once, it's virtually impossible
to catch it again. "Second cases
are very, very rare. You get a
solid immunity to mono,"
Torin said.
"But if you're not immune,"

Torin continued, "you've got a
pretty good chance of getting it
during the next four years —
and there's no vaccine."
Two extremes
For those who still have a
chance to catch it, Torih
explained that mono affects
students in a variety of ways.
On one extreme, Torin said,
people do not realize they have
mono. They only find out when
it shows up in a blood test.
"The other extreme are those
who get critically ill. Some
times mono can be very seri
ous, but that's very unusual,"
he said.
Most people who contract
mono do not suffer the severe
symptoms. What they do feel is
tired, sore and feverish, Torin
said. These symptoms usually
last 10 to 12 days.
Torin said that mono has no
specific beginning. However,
after four to six days, the pa
tient develops a sore throat
and swollen lymph nodes at
the back of the neck. At this
point, mono can usually be de
tected in a blood test.
Length of illness
"People begin to get better
after about 10 days and the
length of the whole illness is
usually 25 days," Torin said.
However, it can last as little as
one week or as long as two
months.
Treatment for mono is sim
ple — rest and refrain from any

strenuous activity. Torin said
he recommends his patients to
remain in a prone position 16
hours a day during the height
of the illness.
However, he said he dis
counts the idea that mono has
to completely change a per
son's life by forcing them to
drop out of school and stay in
bed for months. "Tests show
that people who were up and
around as much as they felt like
it are feeling better sooner
than those who stayed in bed."
Activity restricted
Torin explained, "The treat
ment is designed to make the
patient more comfortable. We
restrict their activity so they
won't hurt their liver or sp
leen."
The liver and spleen of all
mono patients becomes swol
len, but in its swollen condi
tion, the spleen fs highly sus
ceptible to injury from a blow.
The bleeding that results from
an injury may require surgical
removal of the spleen. How
ever, Torin said he could only
recall two patients with such
complications out of approxi
mately 2000 cases of mono that
the health center has treated in
the last 10 years.
Torin said that one in five
students here who contract
mono are admitted to the in
firmary. They usually stay two
to four days during the peak of
the illness, he said.
