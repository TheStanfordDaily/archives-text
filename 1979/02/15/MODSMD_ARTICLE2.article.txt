# Sororities want recognition
## 
### Rachel Bagby 
In a continuing quest to reestab
lish themselves on campus,
sororities here recently submitted
proposals to the Office of Residential
Education requesting official Univer
sity recognition.
The proposals were submitted
with a cover letter requesting that the
University recognize "all or none of
the groups," according to Tammy
Ritchey, Inter-Sorority Council pres
ident and member of Alpha Phi.
The eight sororities requested the
"all or nothing" consideration be
cause "we were afraid that some
groups would receive recognition
and some groups wouldn't," Ritchey
said. "This would be divisive to the
Greek system as a whole."
However, the University cannot
honor the cover letter's request and
will review and respond to each
proposal individually, according to
Norman Robinson, associate dean of
residential education.
"The decision on whether the
group (ISC) will act as one can only
be made by members of that coali
tion," Robinson said.
Recognition crucial
Recognition for sororities is cru
cial. Last spring, after the Dec. 1977
decision of the Board of Trustees to
amend the 1944 ban, sororities were
allowed to use campus facilities for
organizational activities and rush,
according to Ritchey. At that time the

University had no written policies
pertaining to residentially-related
selective groups.
But a new, expanded policy state
ment was codified last fall because
"we're moving into an era where the
privilege of being a selective group is
being expanded," Robinson said.
Until sororities are recognized under
the newly clarified policy, any further
activities — including rush this
spring — will have to be held off
campus.
At issue are the bylaws of some of
the eight nationally-affiliated
sororities that require potential
pledges to obtain letters of reference
from sorority alumnae. University
policy states that the sorority selec
tion process "may not in any manner
involve letters of reference or the
gathering or use of information from
any source outside the University."
In order to maintain its national af
filiation each of the sororities must
abide by its national organization's
bylaws.
Traditional
The nationals that require letters
do so because it is a traditional prac
tice and they want to have some say
in selection of members since only a
small percentage of the membership
are presently in college, Ritchey
explained.
But the sororities requiring such
letters "work around" that require
ment, said Michelle Rogers, ISC rep-

resentative for Delta Delta Delta. "If
we want a girl, we find a way to do it."
The University, however, strongly
objects to the requirement. "It's a
question of autonomy," explained
Patricia Brandt, office of student ac
tivities advisor to sororities. "The
University says you can be selective
but students here should do the
selecting. It's not fair that someone a
few thousand miles away can have
power over students here.
"Some people say the idea of local
autonomy is a false issue but I think
it's important," Brandt continued.
She explained that letters of recom
mendation can serve as a "very con-,
servative force" against minorities
and persons not of a particular
economic background.
"Their mothers weren't in
sororities; they don't have friends
that are alumna who can readily write
a recommendation," Brandt said.
She hastened to add that she didn't
think the sororities here would use
the letters, to exclude these groups.
Brandt is presently reviewing the
proposals submitted by the
sororities to determine if they need
University guidelines and should
therefore be recognized. The prop
osals will then go to Robinson and his
recommendations will go the Com
mittee on Services to Students,
Robinson said. He couldn't estimate
how long the process will take or
what its outcome will be.
