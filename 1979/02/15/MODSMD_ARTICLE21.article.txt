## Costello pulls a number 
### 
Well it was good while it lasted. The
weird looking guy with glasses — Elvis
Costello — shook some eardrums and
played hard during his less-than
prolonged assault on a Berkeley Com
munity Theater audience last Friday
night. And though anyone who makes
people start tearing up chairs and trash
ing various loose objects must not be .ill
bad, Costello, at the end, left them limp
and it wasn't from exhaustion.
After a funny set from the opening at t,
the Rubinoos (anyone who plays "Sugar,
Sugar" had better be tunny), Costello
and his band, the Attractions, rushed
through a frantic set of 16 songs, mostly
from Armed Forces, their latest album.
It was very much an anti-show. Cos
tello refused to play any of his more
familiar material, like "Alison" or
"Watching the Detectives," and what he
did play he did faster than the studio
versions — which is pretty astonishing.
Most of the songs were separated only
by a couple of drum beats.
There was no pacing or showmanship
to speak ot here; Costello ran his diverse
songs together in a constant attack. And
undeniably, he and his band played well
— for about 45 minutes, which is how
lony the show lasted.

When Elvis and his band ran off the
stage after a strong version of "Radio,
Radio, the audience |ust said to itself,
"Costello is a very weird guy...hut then
we knew that. And we yelled and clap
ped and stomped, and we booed the
disco tiller being played over the speak
ers to try to get him to come back out.
Finally, after half an hour or so of this,
someone had enough grace to tell the
audience that the show was over.
Then the "rioting" started, but it was
rather s,ul and half-hearted; Costello, in
the end, couldn't even piss people off
properly.
So maybe ( ostello does hate America,
as he h.ts insinuated in the past; he's
been pulling this same number
everywhere on this latest tour.
On his records, Costello, along with
Nic k 1 owe and tew others, is bringing
back (and wih the proper vengeance)
pop that's worth a damn, and he's get
ting better all the time. Yet the road's
where you really have got to prove your
self.
So what are you supposed to do with
this guy?
I his concert made a lot of people care
a lot less about the answer to that ques
tion.
"Loni> live disco!" I uuess.
