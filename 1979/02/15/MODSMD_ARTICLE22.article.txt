## The
						Clash fail to deliver 
### 
I don't know where they
all came from, the hundreds
of punks who converged on
the Berkeley Community
Theater last Wednesday
night. They were there to
see the Clash, England's top
band of young rebels. The
freakish fans milled around
the lobby until the blaring
intro "There's a Kiot Going
On" called them inside to
greet the Biitish outlaws.
The Clash's long-awaited
arrival on Yankee territory is
meant to spread here the
near-heroic popularity they
command in England. Most
Americans still haven't
heard their music, largely
because their hit debut al
bum, The Clash, and sub
sequent singles were never
released here. Unfortu
nately, Wednesday's disap
pointing performance indi
cates that they may fail,
where other British acts
have succeeded, at captur
ing the fancy of American
rock fans.
The problem was sound,
harsh and loud like a buzz
saw in your head. Their
twenty numbers, picked
from The Clash, the new LP
Cive Em Enough Rope and
various singles, assaulted
the audience as a

cacophony ot tuzzy guitars
overbearing drums and in
distinguishable vocals.
Frontman |oe Strummer
sings with a thick working
class at c ent that makes it
nearly impossible for non
Britons to understand him
He and guitarisi Mi< k lones
tried hard to enunciate
Sometimes their chant like
harmonies worked, hut
most ot the words were lost
Feedback and poor mixing
added to the distortion.
A few songs stood out
amidst the raucous rumbl
ing. "Police and thieves,
Junior Murvin's reggae < las
sic, was the lightest and
most articulate song ot the
evening. Opening with ( hil
ling howls and blue lights, it
accelerated into a great
dancing rhythm. Also pleas
antly frantic were Ciunson
the Roof," a Stones-type
rocker about universal ter
rorism, and "Safe European
Home," both from the new
album.
While the band's sounc
shook the building, their
stage presence barely regis
tered. They looked prettv
enough in bright western
shirts with matching ban
danas and neat haire uts, but
their presentation was un-

cxpec tedly tame. Mick
lones and bassist Paul
Simenon slung their guitars
low on their hips, c rout hing
and swinging their instru
ments a s they played.
Strummer < rooned urgently
hut hardly budged from the
mike the most ac tion tame
liom diminutive drummer
I opper Headon who consis
tently hurled drum sticks
into the danc ing c rowd.
I he house made up with
enthusiasm what it la< ked in
si/e. People stood through
out, hopping and cheering
spontaneously. When the
band played their punk an
them White Riot" it was
obvious that the fans had
come to lose themselves in
,i pogo frenzy, fhat was the
only time the atmosphere
approximated the all-out
mania .issoc iated with good
punk shows.
II the ( lash want to break
into the American market
they'd better rethink their
game plan Right now,
they're too controlled for
the punk minority, not
polished enough for the
rock masses. A contused
image and inaccessible
sound won't get them very
far.
