Sizwe Bansi is Dead. Oakland
Theater Ensemble; Dinkelspiel
Auditorium; 9 February 1979.
Tactically speaking, it may
have been a mistake to let on
that this was a play about apar
theid — it probably would have
drawn a capacity crowd if it had
claimed issues closer to the
hearts of students here. Big
Came, for instance. Or speed
reading. As it was there were
only about 400 people around
who managed to work Bansi
into their weekend, which
meant that upwards of 10,000
students, friends of students,
TA's and department chairper
sons missed a very important
production. (Snide, but true,
and pretty pathetic). Sizwe
Bansi was decidedly more than
your basic guerilla theater — it
dramatized an issue forcefully
and at length without leaching
off the theme. And the acting
was hard to fault, though at
times it made you want to lay
down and rest.
Sizwe Bansi is Dead was set
in the South African Township

of New Brighton, Port
Elizabeth — it concerned itself
with the means by which that
government handles what it re
fers to as "surplus appen
dages," or "labor units." The
protagonist in the play is a
passbook that every black man
and woman over 16 must carry
— it effectively determines
whether they live, eat, work, or
move. And Sizwe Bansi's is all
screwed up, and he doesn't
stand a chance, and then he
finds a dead man in an alley
whose documents are in order.
And the dead man bears
enough similarity to make the
danger worthwhile, so Bansi
switches passbooks an be
comes another person, so long
as no one checks Robert
Szwelinzema's fingerprints. In
such a way is Sizwe Bansi dead
if he can keep himself out of
trouble — if all goes well he has
an outside chance of remarry
ing his wife.
There were two actors in the
play, both of whom spoke
freely to themselves and to

each other and to the audi
ence, and most of all it was to
great effect. Danny Glover, as
Bansi, was powerfully naive,
and then desperate and then
ingenious in just as powerful a
manner. He almost appeared
dim-witted at times, but that
was for a purpose — it gave us
time to fully fathom the horrors
of his position. No vote, no
land, $10 a month if you work,
and all of that only if you have a
proper passbook. Very good.
And Carl Lumbly played op
posite Clover in two separate
capacities — as a black South
African who had "made it"and
as another who knew what that
meant. In one role he spoke to
the audience more than to
Sizwe Bansi — he told us
stories that were very funny
and uniformly damning.
Sizwe Bdnsi was, in short, an
excellent production — a polit
ical drama that bastardized
neither the politics nor the
drama. You really should have
been there.
