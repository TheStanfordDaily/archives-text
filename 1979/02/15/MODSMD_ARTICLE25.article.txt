## Altman and the empty apocalypse 
### 
Altman's really done it this
time. Not content with
"small," and very fine, movies
like M*A*S*H andMcCabe and
Mrs. Miller, the director's gone
on to larger conceits in his
latest. Quintet is Robert
Altman's private view of the
apocalypse; his thesis is that
the end comes not with a bang
but with an ice age.
Quintet is also a film singu
larly lacking in humor, except
for what little pleasure can be
squeezed out of lines like this
sober exchange between two
characters: "What a coinci
dence and a surprise," says the
first. "A coincidence but not a
surprise," replies the other,
sagely. "Ah...maybe it's the
other way around." Maybe it
is, maybe it isn't; at this point,
it's doubtful if anyone cares.
Unpleasant
Altman's future society is
distinctly unpleasant; he and
the crew of people he wrote
the story and screenplay with
worked very hard to make it
that way. To begin with, it's
cold - ice doesn't melt even in

the warmest rooms. Quintet
was filmed in Montreal in sets
constructed out-of-doors; it's
no wonder the actors look un
comfortable. A little later in the
movie, we discover that people
have lost the ability (or the in
clination) to bear children.
Early in the film, the last pre
gnant woman is killed; to be
more specific, she is exploded
by a bomb.
So what do people in such a
world do for fun? Altman's
answer is a game called Quin
tet. It's a board game played
with dice and markers, and
people get very excited about it
— excited enough to kill each
other over the outcome of the
game. That's the basis of the
plot: the ice-age stuff is all very
allegorical, but the action is
mainly Paul Newman desper
ately trying not to have his
throat cut because of a game.
Interest?
If Altman was convinced that a
game is enough of a premise to
make a movie, the least he
could have done would have
been to make that game look

interesting. Unfortunately, the
director doesn't see fit to give
the audience even one scene
that might have shown what
makes this very ordinary
looking game so compelling.
The actors try hard to inject
some excitement into their
performances, but it's clear
that even they don't really be
lieve that anyone could be
caught up in a dice game
played on a five-sided board
witb sea-shells and colored
stones.
Altman has summoned upan
impressive cast to play his
game: Paul Newman, Vittorio
Gassman, Fernando Rey, Bibi
Anderson. Most of them are
murdered at some point in the
film. The standard method is a
quick knife-slash through the
throat, but, for variety, one is
crushed by an ice-flow and
another is shish-kabobed
through the head with a long
metal stake. Most of the actors
are wasted in characters not
even as interesting as their
manner of death.

Some of Quintet's imagery is
engrossing. Stark ice-scapes
contrasted with medieval
looking, opulent but still very
chilly interiors; a subway direc
tory made up of huge sheets of
swaying, tinkling glass, and
even the ever-present dog
packs grown sleek by feasting
on dead humans are all visions
that remain in the memory
much longer than the predict
able twists of Quintet's plot.
But Altman ruins the effect of
some of his best scenes by the
use of an artsy technique
which blurs the edges of each
scene: after an hour of this
murkiness a clear lens could
have been extremely effective.
Altman, one of this decade's
most consistently interesting
directors, certainly can do bet
ter than this dead-weight end
of-the-world tale. Perhaps
(juintet is something the direc
tor needed to get out of his sys
tem, like the flu. If so, we can
all wait for a return to smaller,
more manageable, and more
interesting themes.

Altman has summoned upan
impressive cast to play his
game: Paul Newman, Vittorio
Gassman, Fernando Rey, Bibi
Anderson. Most of them are
murdered at some point in the
film. The standard method is a
quick knife-slash through the
throat, but, for variety, one is
crushed by an ice-flow and
another is shish-kabobed
through the head with a long
metal stake. Most of the actors
are wasted in characters not
even as interesting as their
manner of death.

Some of Quintet's imagery is
engrossing. Stark ice-scapes
contrasted with medieval
looking, opulent but still very
chilly interiors; a subway direc
tory made up of huge sheets of
swaying, tinkling glass, and
even the ever-present dog
packs grown sleek by feasting
on dead humans are all visions
that remain in the memory
much longer than the predict
able twists of Quintet's plot.
But Altman ruins the effect of
some of his best scenes by the
use of an artsy technique
which blurs the edges of each
scene: after an hour of this
murkiness a clear lens could
have been extremely effective.
Altman, one of this decade's
most consistently interesting
directors, certainly can do bet
ter than this dead-weight end
of-the-world tale. Perhaps
(juintet is something the direc
tor needed to get out of his sys
tem, like the flu. If so, we can
all wait for a return to smaller,
more manageable, and more
interesting themes.
Altman's really done it this
time. Not content with
"small," and very fine, movies
like M*A*S*H andMcCabe and
Mrs. Miller, the director's gone
on to larger conceits in his
latest. Quintet is Robert
Altman's private view of the
apocalypse; his thesis is that
the end comes not with a bang
but with an ice age.
Quintet is also a film singu
larly lacking in humor, except
for what little pleasure can be
squeezed out of lines like this
sober exchange between two
characters: "What a coinci
dence and a surprise," says the
first. "A coincidence but not a
surprise," replies the other,
sagely. "Ah...maybe it's the
other way around." Maybe it
is, maybe it isn't; at this point,
it's doubtful if anyone cares.
Unpleasant
Altman's future society is
distinctly unpleasant; he and
the crew of people he wrote
the story and screenplay with
worked very hard to make it
that way. To begin with, it's
cold - ice doesn't melt even in

the warmest rooms. Quintet
was filmed in Montreal in sets
constructed out-of-doors; it's
no wonder the actors look un
comfortable. A little later in the
movie, we discover that people
have lost the ability (or the in
clination) to bear children.
Early in the film, the last pre
gnant woman is killed; to be
more specific, she is exploded
by a bomb.
So what do people in such a
world do for fun? Altman's
answer is a game called Quin
tet. It's a board game played
with dice and markers, and
people get very excited about it
— excited enough to kill each
other over the outcome of the
game. That's the basis of the
plot: the ice-age stuff is all very
allegorical, but the action is
mainly Paul Newman desper
ately trying not to have his
throat cut because of a game.
Interest?
If Altman was convinced that a
game is enough of a premise to
make a movie, the least he
could have done would have
been to make that game look

interesting. Unfortunately, the
director doesn't see fit to give
the audience even one scene
that might have shown what
makes this very ordinary
looking game so compelling.
The actors try hard to inject
some excitement into their
performances, but it's clear
that even they don't really be
lieve that anyone could be
caught up in a dice game
played on a five-sided board
witb sea-shells and colored
stones.
