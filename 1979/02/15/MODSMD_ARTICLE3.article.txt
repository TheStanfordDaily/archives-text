# Mass evacuation planned this weekend
## Renegade guerrillas seize U.S. Embassy in Tehran 
### 
Tehran, Iran (AP) â€” Renegade
guerrillas shot their way into the U.S.
Embassy, anti-American gangs were
reported roaming the streets and
bloody factional fighting erupted in a
provincial city yesterday as Iran's
new government struggled to keep
control of this troubled nation.
Fighting in the northwestern city of
Tabriz took hundreds of lives, Ira
nian journalists reported.
Sources in Washington said the
Carter administration planned to
launch a new mass evacuation of
Americans from Iran this weekend.
Attack by communists
At the heart of major new violence
was the refusal by rebellious suppor
ters of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
a widely diverse political group, to
turn in their arms now that Kho
meini's anti-shah movement has
succeeded in gaining power. The
Khomeini camp blamed the embassy
attack on communists.
Scores of unidentified gunmen
mounted the mid-morning assault
on the square-block U.S. Embassy
compound with bursts of heavy
machine-gun fire. They wounded
two Marine guards, charged into the
embassy and.took Ambassador Wil
liam Sullivan and 101 other Ameri
cans hostage.
Armed Pro-Khomeini men then
appeared and drove the insurgents
from the badly damaged compound
in a 316-hour gun battle.
Top-secret center
When the embassy was attacked,
most of the Americans took refuge in
Sullivan's office and a top-secret
communications center while 19
Marine guards fired into the air and
tried unsuccessfully to stop the at
tackers with tear gas, officials said.
An unidentified Iranian employee
of the embassy was reported killed.
Marine Sgt. KenKrauss, 22, was hit by
a metal fragment in the forehead and
another Marine was grazed by a bul
let. Embassy officials said both men
were only slightly wounded.
During the attack, embassy tech
nicians burned or blew up an es
timated $500,000 worth of communi
cations and coding equipment. They
set fire to a number of secret docu
ments. But some classified material
was believed to have been left be
hind in offices penetrated by the at
tackers.
Safeguarded
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Hodding Carter said: "I
have good reason to believe that
sensitive material was safeguaded by
necessary measures and did not fall
into their (the attackers') hands."

Guerrillas loyal to Khomeini said
those who attacked the embassy in
Tehran were communists. One of
the attackers also said communists
took part in the assault.
A reliable source in Washington
who asked not to be identified said
he had received reports that after the
embassy attack "revolutionary
police" were making random
searches of American homes in sev
eral Iranian cities and confiscating
personal property.
Demanding independence
Iranian reporters in Tabriz, 330
miles northwest of the capital, said
several hundred people had been kil
led in the fighting there involving
pro-shah troops, SAVAK secret ser
vice agents, Marxists and separatists
demanding independence for the
province of Azerbaijan, which in
cludes Tabriz.
The reports could not be con
firmed, but Khomeini aides here said

there had been many casualties.
Khomeini's grand coalition of
nationalists, conservative Moslems
and myriad political factions span
ning the ideological spectrum had
banded together to force Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from
power last month. But the reported
factional bloodshed indicated the al
liance may be crumbling.
Both the conservative Moslems
and radical leftists had grown uneasy
with each other in recent weeks as
political victory neared.
Foreigners harassed
The attack on the embassy fol
lowed several days in which foreig
ners were harassed here. Guerrillas
loyal to Khomeini, as well as other
armed bands, have rounded up,
questioned or searched the luggage
of more than 400 Americans and
other foreigners.
Khomeini has ordered all Iranians
who are without special permission
from his organization to turn in their
arms. Some 300,000 guns were dis
tributed or stolen from army and
police armories in recent bloody
fighting.
The renegade bands defying Kho
meini appear to be members ot leftist
underground groups who have
fought for years against the authorita
rian regime of the shah and are now
unwilling to put down the arms they
have seized in the wake of their suc
cessful revolt.
Firing from rooftops
Embassy employees said attackers
started firing from nearby rooftops at
about 10:30 a.m. and then began
climbing the wall into the central
building containing the main em
bassy offices, as staff members inside
rushed for cover.
The embassy's Marine guard tried
to drive the attackers back with tear
gas, but Sullivan ordered them to
cease resistance and to surrender
with the rest of the staff. The Ameri
cans were then herded into the
grounds, searched by the masked
guerrillas and then sent back into the
embassy buildings.
Kraus, a 22-year-old Marine from
Lansdale, Pa., said he rushed to his
battle station at the embassy com
missary when the shooting broke
out.
Demanded weapons
"They shot in all the windows and
were pounding and pounding on the
door," he said. Kraus said theguerril
las broke down the door and struck
him with a rifle butt as they de
manded American weapons. "The
next thing I heard was a 'whang' and I
was on my face and started bleed
ing."
Sullivan said the embassy con
tacted Khomeini's forces to ask for
assistance. He said Khomeini

"policemen" rushed the compound
after firing hundreds of volleys from
rooftops surrounding the complex.
Khomeini's deputy prime minister,
Ibrahim Yazdi, arrived at the em
bassy and told the Americans "we
were all safe," Sullivan said. The am
bassador said the Americans re
turned to their quarters within the
compound and remained inside on
the advice of the Khomeini forces.
