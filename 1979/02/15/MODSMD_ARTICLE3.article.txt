# Mass evacuation planned this weekend
## Renegade guerrillas seize U.S. Embassy in Tehran 
### 
Tehran, Iran (AP) â€” Renegade
guerrillas shot their way into the U.S.
Embassy, anti-American gangs were
reported roaming the streets and
bloody factional fighting erupted in a
provincial city yesterday as Iran's
new government struggled to keep
control of this troubled nation.
Fighting in the northwestern city of
Tabriz took hundreds of lives, Ira
nian journalists reported.
Sources in Washington said the
Carter administration planned to
launch a new mass evacuation of
Americans from Iran this weekend.
Attack by communists
At the heart of major new violence
was the refusal by rebellious suppor
ters of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
a widely diverse political group, to
turn in their arms now that Kho
meini's anti-shah movement has
succeeded in gaining power. The
Khomeini camp blamed the embassy
attack on communists.
Scores of unidentified gunmen
mounted the mid-morning assault
on the square-block U.S. Embassy
compound with bursts of heavy
machine-gun fire. They wounded
two Marine guards, charged into the
embassy and.took Ambassador Wil
liam Sullivan and 101 other Ameri
cans hostage.
Armed Pro-Khomeini men then
appeared and drove the insurgents
from the badly damaged compound
in a 316-hour gun battle.
Top-secret center
When the embassy was attacked,
most of the Americans took refuge in
Sullivan's office and a top-secret
communications center while 19
Marine guards fired into the air and
tried unsuccessfully to stop the at
tackers with tear gas, officials said.
An unidentified Iranian employee
of the embassy was reported killed.
Marine Sgt. KenKrauss, 22, was hit by
a metal fragment in the forehead and
another Marine was grazed by a bul
let. Embassy officials said both men
were only slightly wounded.
During the attack, embassy tech
nicians burned or blew up an es
timated $500,000 worth of communi
cations and coding equipment. They
set fire to a number of secret docu
ments. But some classified material
was believed to have been left be
hind in offices penetrated by the at
tackers.
Safeguarded
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Hodding Carter said: "I
have good reason to believe that
sensitive material was safeguaded by
necessary measures and did not fall
into their (the attackers') hands."

Guerrillas loyal to Khomeini said
those who attacked the embassy in
Tehran were communists. One of
the attackers also said communists
took part in the assault.
A reliable source in Washington
who asked not to be identified said
he had received reports that after the
embassy attack "revolutionary
police" were making random
searches of American homes in sev
eral Iranian cities and confiscating
personal property.
Demanding independence
Iranian reporters in Tabriz, 330
miles northwest of the capital, said
several hundred people had been kil
led in the fighting there involving
pro-shah troops, SAVAK secret ser
vice agents, Marxists and separatists
demanding independence for the
province of Azerbaijan, which in
cludes Tabriz.
The reports could not be con
firmed, but Khomeini aides here said

there had been many casualties.
Khomeini's grand coalition of
nationalists, conservative Moslems
and myriad political factions span
ning the ideological spectrum had
banded together to force Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from
power last month. But the reported
factional bloodshed indicated the al
liance may be crumbling.
Both the conservative Moslems
and radical leftists had grown uneasy
with each other in recent weeks as
political victory neared.
Foreigners harassed
The attack on the embassy fol
lowed several days in which foreig
ners were harassed here. Guerrillas
loyal to Khomeini, as well as other
armed bands, have rounded up,
questioned or searched the luggage
of more than 400 Americans and
other foreigners.
Khomeini has ordered all Iranians
