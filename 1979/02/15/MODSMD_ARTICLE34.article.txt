Evacuations from Iran will resume
Washington — The Carter administration plans to re
sume mass evacuation of Americans from Iran this
weekend with the ultimate goal of airlifting 5000 from
the embattled country, it was learned yesterday.
U.S. officials said 1700 of the nearly 7000 Americans
still in Iran are prepared to leave immediately. The
Tehran airport, kept shut by the new regime of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini as it tries to solidify its control, is
expected to be reopened Saturday after observances of
religious holidays.
The goal of the evacuation is to reduce the American
community in Iran — U.S. officials, businessmen,
teachers and others — to no more than 2000. Last sum
mer there were some 45,000 Americans in Iran.
Chavez warns: "expect the worst."
Calexico — Resisting Gov. Jerry Brown's call for re
straint, United Farm Workers President Cesar Chavez
warned that strike-bound growers can "expect the
worst" when picketing resumes today.
Chavez's remarks came after a funeral yesterday for
slain UFW striker Rufino Contreras.
Speaking before 7000 mourners at this border town,
Brown urged the UFW members to make their protests
nonviolent. He added that the death of Contreras,
"would wake all of us up to the need to live as brothers
and sisters."
Asked if violence was a possibility when the workers
return to the fields after a memorial harvesting halt,
Chavez, after a lengthy pause, said: "What do you ex
pect after they killed one of ours. We're dealing with
subhumans."
Mexico publicly admonishes U.S.
Mexico City — President Carter was challenged yes
terday by Mexican President )ose Lopez Portillo to aban
don the United States' big brother view of Mexico and
establish a relationship based on equality.
The Mexican president, publicly admonishing the
United States to revise its Mexican policies, said during a
toast at a state luncheon honoring Carter: "Our peoples
want definitive agreements, not circumstantial conces
sions."
Carter was greeted on his arrival by 5000 flag-waving
Mexicans. Speaking first in Spanish, then in English, he
said his visit offered a chance to resolve differences "in a

spirit of peace, friendship, and mutual respect. We have
a great deal to accomplish."
But the airport reception was cool by Latin American
standards.
Almost immediately after the ceremonies, Carter and
Lopez Portillo met for 90 minutes at the National Palace
before the luncheon.
There, Carter said the United States recognizes that
Mexico's independent voice is heard "with increasing
strength and persuasiveness." He conceded the two
countries sometimes view each other with "a lack of
understanding."
U.S. could get Iranian oil this year
Washington — The United States has received informal
word that the new government in Iran will increase oil
production by enough to permit a resumption of exports
to other nations this year, a top Energy Department
official said yesterday, testifying before a House Com
merce subcommittee.
Assistant Energy Secretary Harry Bergold cau
tioned, however, that the word came from Iranian
officials below the cabinet level in the emerging gov
ernment of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
In informal contacts with the Iranian government,
he said, U.S. officials have been advised that "a return to
production will be possible sometime in 1979."
Before the shutdown, Iran accounted for 10 percent of
the world's oil and 5 percent of the supply imported by
the United States.
