New Delhi, India (AP) — U.S.
Ambassador to Afghanistan Adolph
Dubs was fatally wounded yesterday
during a shootout between police
and Moslem gunmen holding him
hostage in a hotel room in the Afghan
capital of Kabul.
Official Kabul Radio said the four
kidnappers shot Dubs when police
charged into the room, reportedly
after officers fired automatic
weapons for 60 seconds through the
door and from across the street.
U.S. diplomats in Pakistan said the
kidnappers — who were not iden
tified — sought the release of three
Shiite Moslem clergymen recently
arrested by the leftist Afghan gov
ernment, which has established
close ties with the Soviet Union.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Hodding Carter said
Soviet advisers were at the hotel
when Dubs was killed and "failed to
heed repeated requests" by Ameri
can officials that force not be used
against the kidnappers.
He said acting Secretary of State
Warren Christopher summoned
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobry
nin to "express in the strongest
terms the shock of the U.S. govern
ment" over the alleged Soviet role in
Dubs' death. In Mexico City, officials
traveling with President Carter de

scribed him as "very angry" and said
Dobrynin wai called in by his order.
Kabul Radio said Dubs was in criti
cal condition when police reached
him, and he died in the embassy dis
pensary. The station also said all four
kidnappers were killed, but an
American who witnessed the assault
said one kidnapper was captured.
"He was brought down the stairs
fighting and kept trying to raise a leg
to kick one of his captors in the
groin," said Sandy Stiebel of High
land Park, 111., in an interview.
Stiebel's husband said police fired
into the windows and through the
doorforafull minute before rushing
in.
President Jimmy Carter and his
wife, Rosalynn, en route to Mexico,
telephoned Dubs' widow in
Washington from Air Force One to
express their sympathy. Carter is
sued a statement saying, "The act of
brutality which took his life has dep
rived our nation of one of its most
able public servants."
Kabul Radio said the kidnappers,
disguised as traffic police, pulled
Dubs' chauffeur-driven limousine
over yesterday morning, seized him
and took him to the Kabul Hotel in
the center of the Afghan capital.
Once there, they communicated
their demands to authorities.
Moslem mullahs, or clergymen,
reportedly have played a prominent
role in sporadic outbreaks of in
surgency in eastern Afghanistan
against the pro-Soviet government of
President Noor Mohammad Taraki.
The government has been playing
down the intensity of the fighting,
which Afghan exiles in Pakistan say
involves hundreds of soldiers and vil
lagers, and air force strafing and
napalm attacks.
Kabul Radio said government offi
cials did their best to free Dubs but
the abductors refused and an attack
was ordered. But in Washington a
State Department spokesman shar
ply criticized the Afghans, saying
they had ignored a U.S. appeal that
they negotiate with the kidnappers.
Dubs's kidnap-killing coincided
with an attack on the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran, the capital of neighboring
Iran, although the Iranian revolution
is led by that country's Shiite Moslem
patriarch, there was no apparent
connection between the two attacks.
The Shiites are the majority sect in
Iran, while in Afghanistan they are
greatly outnumbered by the Sunni
Moslems, their traditional enemies.
