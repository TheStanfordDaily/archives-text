# Brainwashing no defense, Hearst case psychologist says
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Slightly more than five years ago,
on Feb. 4, 1974, Patty Hearst was
dragged out of her Berkeley apart
ment and kidnapped by members of
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA).
Two months later, on April 15, she
was a wanted criminal, accused of
aiding the SLA in a San Francisco
bank robbery.
Just what went through Patty
Hearst's mind in those two months
has remained a mystery, though the
case attracted international atten
tion. The remainder of Hearst's
seven-year sentence was commuted
by a presidential action last month,
month.
Arguments will continue to rage
over whether she willingly joined the
SLA following her abduction, or was
coerced into doing so.
Responsible for actions?
And arguments will rage over the
extent to which she should be held
responsible for her actions since she
had no control over being kidnapped
in the first place.
These questions may never be
answered, but if defense lawyer F.
Lee Bailey had handled them diffe
rently during Hearst's trial, "she
would have gotten a light sen
tence...and would have been out in a
year," maintains Dr. Donald Lunde, a
lecturer at the Law School here and
one of three psychologists ap
pointed as consultants to the late
judge Oliver Carter, who presided
over the case.
Lunde claims that Hearst was
found guilty by the jury because her
lawyer, Bailey, presented a de
fense which "contradicted itself."
Hearst tried to claim that she was
subject to both brainwashing and
physical threats during her 20
months with the SLA.
According to Lunde, one of the

questions the jury had to resolve was
"where coerced behavior ends and
truly voluntary action begins for pe
sons who appear to have changed
their loyalties and values while held
in captivity.
"The answer was thought to reside
in a misunderstood, potentially
powerful, and yet quite simple, pro
cess developed by the Chinese
communists called 'brainwashing.'"
Brainwashing no defense
Contrary to popular belief, how
ever, brainwashing cannot (cur
rently) be used as a defense against
criminal responsibility in a court of
law, Lunde says.
That is, no reported case in
Anglo-American law has ever ac
cepted brainwashing as a defense to
criminal liability, he said.
The jury also had to consider
whether Hearst could be found in
nocent if it could be proved that her
life was under physical threat for re
fusing to do as she was told. This is
known as the defense of "duress,"
Lunde explained.
Because it can be used as a com
plete defense to criminal responsibil
ity, the meaning of duress has been
very strictly defined by both military
and civilian courts.
As most courts adopt a standard
that duress must be "present, immi
nent and impending," Lunde says
that the courts "have imposed a
standard of personal courage upon a
defendant who seeks to raise a
duress defense."
Hearst said in her defense that she
would have been gunned down by
her captors had she resisted their or
ders.
Fatal flaw
But Lunde says that the fatal flaw in
that argument is that she failed to
take advantage of many clear oppor
tunities to escape her abductors dur
ing and in the months following

the April 1974 bank robbery.
"The defense in the Hearst case
attempted to combine a strategy
premised upon coercive persuasion,
while simultaneously clinging to the
duress defense. The result was an in
consistent and seemingly contradic
tory presentation of the defendant's
mental state," according to Lunde.
"And you just can't have it both
ways," he added.
So what were her alternatives?
Lunde argues that if she had im
mediately pleaded guilty to the bank
robbery charge, but also pleaded
that several factors involving a relaxa
tion of the the traditional duress rule
be considered for the lessening of
her sentence, she would have been
free long before now.
"She would have gotten a light
sentence, and would have been re
leased much much sooner than this
time. She would have been out
within a year," Lunde says.
Contradictory defense
Instead, she was found guilty both
because of the contradictory nature
of her defense, and the fact that
when speaking in her own defense
she took the Fifth Amendment 42
times and received several contempt
citations from Judge Carter, he said,
ings" about the commutation issued
last month by President Jimmy Car
ter. "I definitely feel she spent more
time in prison than she should
have . . .
"But on the other hand, what
bothers me is that there are an awful
lot of people who are in jail longer for
more minor robberies, but they are
poor people who don't have lawyers
or the wealth...to get that kind of
publicity (that Hearst received).
Many people spend more years in jail
for lesser crimes because there was
no one out there is fighting for
them."
The Hearst case is not without pre

cedent. Prior to her abduction,
brainwashing was most often as
sociated with the experience of
American prisoners of war (POWs) in
the Korean War. Many POWs were
accused of collaboration with their
captors during the conflict. Twenty
one refused to come back to this
country after the war.
Lunde explained that POWs were
subject to an "intensive indoctrina
tional program" as well as
techniques of undermining the so
cial structure of the prisoner group.
Confessions elicited
In this manner, he said, the com
munists elicited confessions or
cooperation from their captives.
Some prisoners went through a
"complete ideological change," ac
cording to Lunde.
But perhaps an even more drama
tic example of a brainwashing con

troversy occurred when the U.S.S.
Pueblo was seized in 1968 by North
Korea after which the ship's captain
signed a full confession of actions
which the entire crew later claimed
never happened.
On Jan. 23, 1968, North Korean
naval forces seized the Pueblo,
claiming that the ship was conduct
ing illegal espionage activities in
their waters. The incident marked
the first time that a U.S. naval ship
was seized intact, and represented a
major crisis at the time.
Though the ship's log and every
single surviving crew member deny
that the ship ever committed the al
leged acts, ship captain Lloyd Bucher
signed a confession, drawn up by the
North Koreans, confirming that it
had. ,
According to Lunde, who spent
several days interviewing Bucher

after the Pueblo incident, Bucher
claims he was never brainwashed,
though some in this country "au
tomatically assumed he had been."
Physical torture
Bucher said that he underwent
much physical torture by the North
Koreans and still refused to sign the
confession. Itwas not until the North
Koreans lined up all the ship mem
bers, from the youngest on up, and
threatened to shoot them one by one
unless Bucher signed the confession
that he relented.
But Bucher denied that he was
brainwashed or was under North Ko
rean influence. Ironically, said
Lunde, Bucher could have used a
duress defense to maintain his inno
cence when his own life was
threatened, but not when the lives of
his crew were. "Duress may only be
used when the danger is to you per
sonally," Lunde said.
Thus a Navy court of inquiry was
prepared to recommend Bucher's
court-martial following his release by
the North Koreans. However, then-
Navy Secretary Paul Ignatius inter
vened to absolve him of any wrong
doing.
The North Koreans released the 82
surviving crew members and re
turned the body of the 83rd on Dec.
22,1968, retaining possession of the
ship itself.
The limits of brainwashing remain
to be debated, but its use as a de
fense in criminal cases has yet to be
deemed admissable by the courts,
Lunde said.
Guyana
The issue won't go away and is in
fact coming to a head, he continued.
The mass murders of members of the
People's Temple in Guyana last
November have focused even more
attention on the issue, he said,
"people were so stunned by Jones-


Donald Lunde
town.
"That might have had even more of
an impart if it had occurred closer to
home, or the trials were occurring in
this country," he said. "A case
like that would have forced every
body to reevaluate their position on
brainwashing, more so than the
Hearst case.
"You're talking about hundreds of
people who were 'ordinary' citizens.
If it were the case that many of those
900 were murdered under the direct
order of Jim Jones (who had been a
respected citizen and leader before
the Guyana incident)...(and) if you
had access to those people, that
would raise the issue in a much more
difficult case."
Slightly more than five years ago,
on Feb. 4, 1974, Patty Hearst was
dragged out of her Berkeley apart

Many people spend more years in jail
for lesser crimes because there was
no one out there is fighting for
them."
The Hearst case is not without pre

cedent. Prior to her abduction,
brainwashing was most often as
sociated with the experience of
American prisoners of war (POWs) in
the Korean War. Many POWs were
accused of collaboration with their
captors during the conflict. Twenty
one refused to come back to this
country after the war.
Lunde explained that POWs were
subject to an "intensive indoctrina
tional program" as well as
techniques of undermining the so
cial structure of the prisoner group.
Confessions elicited
In this manner, he said, the com
munists elicited confessions or
cooperation from their captives.
Some prisoners went through a
"complete ideological change," ac
cording to Lunde.
But perhaps an even more drama
tic example of a brainwashing con

troversy occurred when the U.S.S.
Pueblo was seized in 1968 by North
Korea after which the ship's captain
signed a full confession of actions
which the entire crew later claimed
never happened.
On Jan. 23, 1968, North Korean
naval forces seized the Pueblo,
claiming that the ship was conduct
ing illegal espionage activities in
their waters. The incident marked
the first time that a U.S. naval ship
was seized intact, and represented a
major crisis at the time.
Though the ship's log and every
single surviving crew member deny
that the ship ever committed the al
leged acts, ship captain Lloyd Bucher
signed a confession, drawn up by the
North Koreans, confirming that it
had. ,
According to Lunde, who spent
several days interviewing Bucher

after the Pueblo incident, Bucher
claims he was never brainwashed,
though some in this country "au
tomatically assumed he had been."
Physical torture
Bucher said that he underwent
much physical torture by the North
Koreans and still refused to sign the
confession. Itwas not until the North
Koreans lined up all the ship mem
bers, from the youngest on up, and
threatened to shoot them one by one
unless Bucher signed the confession
that he relented.
But Bucher denied that he was
brainwashed or was under North Ko
rean influence. Ironically, said
Lunde, Bucher could have used a
duress defense to maintain his inno
cence when his own life was
threatened, but not when the lives of
his crew were. "Duress may only be
used when the danger is to you per
sonally," Lunde said.
Thus a Navy court of inquiry was
prepared to recommend Bucher's
court-martial following his release by
the North Koreans. However, then-
Navy Secretary Paul Ignatius inter
vened to absolve him of any wrong
doing.
The North Koreans released the 82
surviving crew members and re
turned the body of the 83rd on Dec.
22,1968, retaining possession of the
ship itself.
The limits of brainwashing remain
to be debated, but its use as a de
fense in criminal cases has yet to be
deemed admissable by the courts,
Lunde said.
Guyana
The issue won't go away and is in
fact coming to a head, he continued.
The mass murders of members of the
People's Temple in Guyana last
November have focused even more
attention on the issue, he said,
"people were so stunned by Jones-


Donald Lunde
town.
"That might have had even more of
an impart if it had occurred closer to
home, or the trials were occurring in
this country," he said. "A case
like that would have forced every
body to reevaluate their position on
brainwashing, more so than the
Hearst case.
"You're talking about hundreds of
people who were 'ordinary' citizens.
If it were the case that many of those
900 were murdered under the direct
order of Jim Jones (who had been a
respected citizen and leader before
the Guyana incident)...(and) if you
had access to those people, that
would raise the issue in a much more
difficult case."
Slightly more than five years ago,
on Feb. 4, 1974, Patty Hearst was
dragged out of her Berkeley apart
ment and kidnapped by members of
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA).
Two months later, on April 15, she
was a wanted criminal, accused of
aiding the SLA in a San Francisco
bank robbery.
Just what went through Patty
Hearst's mind in those two months
has remained a mystery, though the
case attracted international atten
tion. The remainder of Hearst's
seven-year sentence was commuted
by a presidential action last month,
month.
Arguments will continue to rage
over whether she willingly joined the
SLA following her abduction, or was
coerced into doing so.
Responsible for actions?
And arguments will rage over the
extent to which she should be held
responsible for her actions since she
had no control over being kidnapped
in the first place.
These questions may never be
answered, but if defense lawyer F.
Lee Bailey had handled them diffe
rently during Hearst's trial, "she
would have gotten a light sen
tence...and would have been out in a
year," maintains Dr. Donald Lunde, a
lecturer at the Law School here and
one of three psychologists ap
pointed as consultants to the late
judge Oliver Carter, who presided
over the case.
Lunde claims that Hearst was
found guilty by the jury because her
lawyer, Bailey, presented a de
fense which "contradicted itself."
Hearst tried to claim that she was
subject to both brainwashing and
physical threats during her 20
months with the SLA.
According to Lunde, one of the

questions the jury had to resolve was
"where coerced behavior ends and
truly voluntary action begins for pe
sons who appear to have changed
their loyalties and values while held
in captivity.
"The answer was thought to reside
in a misunderstood, potentially
powerful, and yet quite simple, pro
cess developed by the Chinese
communists called 'brainwashing.'"
Brainwashing no defense
Contrary to popular belief, how
ever, brainwashing cannot (cur
rently) be used as a defense against
criminal responsibility in a court of
law, Lunde says.
That is, no reported case in
Anglo-American law has ever ac
cepted brainwashing as a defense to
criminal liability, he said.
The jury also had to consider
whether Hearst could be found in
nocent if it could be proved that her
life was under physical threat for re
fusing to do as she was told. This is
known as the defense of "duress,"
Lunde explained.
Because it can be used as a com
plete defense to criminal responsibil
ity, the meaning of duress has been
very strictly defined by both military
and civilian courts.
As most courts adopt a standard
that duress must be "present, immi
nent and impending," Lunde says
that the courts "have imposed a
standard of personal courage upon a
defendant who seeks to raise a
duress defense."
Hearst said in her defense that she
would have been gunned down by
her captors had she resisted their or
ders.
Fatal flaw
But Lunde says that the fatal flaw in
that argument is that she failed to
take advantage of many clear oppor
tunities to escape her abductors dur
ing and in the months following

the April 1974 bank robbery.
"The defense in the Hearst case
attempted to combine a strategy
premised upon coercive persuasion,
while simultaneously clinging to the
duress defense. The result was an in
consistent and seemingly contradic
tory presentation of the defendant's
mental state," according to Lunde.
"And you just can't have it both
ways," he added.
So what were her alternatives?
Lunde argues that if she had im
mediately pleaded guilty to the bank
robbery charge, but also pleaded
that several factors involving a relaxa
tion of the the traditional duress rule
be considered for the lessening of
her sentence, she would have been
free long before now.
"She would have gotten a light
sentence, and would have been re
leased much much sooner than this
time. She would have been out
within a year," Lunde says.
Contradictory defense
Instead, she was found guilty both
because of the contradictory nature
of her defense, and the fact that
when speaking in her own defense
she took the Fifth Amendment 42
times and received several contempt
citations from Judge Carter, he said,
ings" about the commutation issued
last month by President Jimmy Car
ter. "I definitely feel she spent more
time in prison than she should
have . . .
"But on the other hand, what
bothers me is that there are an awful
lot of people who are in jail longer for
more minor robberies, but they are
poor people who don't have lawyers
or the wealth...to get that kind of
publicity (that Hearst received).
Many people spend more years in jail
for lesser crimes because there was
no one out there is fighting for
them."
The Hearst case is not without pre

Responsible for actions?
And arguments will rage over the
extent to which she should be held
responsible for her actions since she
had no control over being kidnapped
in the first place.
These questions may never be
answered, but if defense lawyer F.
Lee Bailey had handled them diffe
rently during Hearst's trial, "she
would have gotten a light sen
tence...and would have been out in a
year," maintains Dr. Donald Lunde, a
lecturer at the Law School here and
one of three psychologists ap
pointed as consultants to the late
judge Oliver Carter, who presided
over the case.
Lunde claims that Hearst was
found guilty by the jury because her
lawyer, Bailey, presented a de
fense which "contradicted itself."
Hearst tried to claim that she was
subject to both brainwashing and
physical threats during her 20
months with the SLA.
According to Lunde, one of the

questions the jury had to resolve was
"where coerced behavior ends and
truly voluntary action begins for pe
sons who appear to have changed
their loyalties and values while held
in captivity.
"The answer was thought to reside
in a misunderstood, potentially
powerful, and yet quite simple, pro
cess developed by the Chinese
communists called 'brainwashing.'"
Brainwashing no defense
Contrary to popular belief, how
ever, brainwashing cannot (cur
rently) be used as a defense against
criminal responsibility in a court of
law, Lunde says.
That is, no reported case in
Anglo-American law has ever ac
cepted brainwashing as a defense to
criminal liability, he said.
The jury also had to consider
whether Hearst could be found in
nocent if it could be proved that her
life was under physical threat for re
fusing to do as she was told. This is
known as the defense of "duress,"
Lunde explained.
Because it can be used as a com
plete defense to criminal responsibil
ity, the meaning of duress has been
very strictly defined by both military
and civilian courts.
As most courts adopt a standard
that duress must be "present, immi
nent and impending," Lunde says
that the courts "have imposed a
standard of personal courage upon a
defendant who seeks to raise a
duress defense."
Hearst said in her defense that she
would have been gunned down by
her captors had she resisted their or
ders.
Fatal flaw
But Lunde says that the fatal flaw in
that argument is that she failed to
take advantage of many clear oppor
tunities to escape her abductors dur
ing and in the months following

the April 1974 bank robbery.
"The defense in the Hearst case
attempted to combine a strategy
premised upon coercive persuasion,
while simultaneously clinging to the
duress defense. The result was an in
consistent and seemingly contradic
tory presentation of the defendant's
mental state," according to Lunde.
"And you just can't have it both
ways," he added.
So what were her alternatives?
Lunde argues that if she had im
mediately pleaded guilty to the bank
robbery charge, but also pleaded
that several factors involving a relaxa
tion of the the traditional duress rule
be considered for the lessening of
her sentence, she would have been
free long before now.
"She would have gotten a light
sentence, and would have been re
leased much much sooner than this
time. She would have been out
within a year," Lunde says.
Contradictory defense
Instead, she was found guilty both
because of the contradictory nature
of her defense, and the fact that
when speaking in her own defense
she took the Fifth Amendment 42
times and received several contempt
citations from Judge Carter, he said,
ings" about the commutation issued
last month by President Jimmy Car
ter. "I definitely feel she spent more
time in prison than she should
have . . .
"But on the other hand, what
bothers me is that there are an awful
lot of people who are in jail longer for
more minor robberies, but they are
poor people who don't have lawyers
or the wealth...to get that kind of
publicity (that Hearst received).
Many people spend more years in jail
for lesser crimes because there was
no one out there is fighting for
them."
The Hearst case is not without pre

cedent. Prior to her abduction,
brainwashing was most often as
sociated with the experience of
American prisoners of war (POWs) in
the Korean War. Many POWs were
accused of collaboration with their
captors during the conflict. Twenty
one refused to come back to this
country after the war.
Lunde explained that POWs were
subject to an "intensive indoctrina
tional program" as well as
techniques of undermining the so
cial structure of the prisoner group.
Confessions elicited
In this manner, he said, the com
munists elicited confessions or
cooperation from their captives.
Some prisoners went through a
"complete ideological change," ac
cording to Lunde.
But perhaps an even more drama
tic example of a brainwashing con

troversy occurred when the U.S.S.
Pueblo was seized in 1968 by North
Korea after which the ship's captain
signed a full confession of actions
which the entire crew later claimed
never happened.
On Jan. 23, 1968, North Korean
naval forces seized the Pueblo,
claiming that the ship was conduct
ing illegal espionage activities in
their waters. The incident marked
the first time that a U.S. naval ship
was seized intact, and represented a
major crisis at the time.
Though the ship's log and every
single surviving crew member deny
that the ship ever committed the al
leged acts, ship captain Lloyd Bucher
signed a confession, drawn up by the
North Koreans, confirming that it
had. ,
According to Lunde, who spent
several days interviewing Bucher

after the Pueblo incident, Bucher
claims he was never brainwashed,
though some in this country "au
tomatically assumed he had been."
Physical torture
Bucher said that he underwent
much physical torture by the North
Koreans and still refused to sign the
confession. Itwas not until the North
Koreans lined up all the ship mem
bers, from the youngest on up, and
threatened to shoot them one by one
unless Bucher signed the confession
that he relented.
But Bucher denied that he was
brainwashed or was under North Ko
rean influence. Ironically, said
Lunde, Bucher could have used a
duress defense to maintain his inno
cence when his own life was
threatened, but not when the lives of
his crew were. "Duress may only be
used when the danger is to you per
sonally," Lunde said.
Thus a Navy court of inquiry was
prepared to recommend Bucher's
court-martial following his release by
the North Koreans. However, then-
Navy Secretary Paul Ignatius inter
vened to absolve him of any wrong
doing.
The North Koreans released the 82
surviving crew members and re
turned the body of the 83rd on Dec.
22,1968, retaining possession of the
ship itself.
The limits of brainwashing remain
to be debated, but its use as a de
fense in criminal cases has yet to be
deemed admissable by the courts,
Lunde said.
Guyana
The issue won't go away and is in
fact coming to a head, he continued.
The mass murders of members of the
People's Temple in Guyana last
November have focused even more
attention on the issue, he said,
"people were so stunned by Jones-


Donald Lunde
town.
"That might have had even more of
an impart if it had occurred closer to
home, or the trials were occurring in
this country," he said. "A case
like that would have forced every
body to reevaluate their position on
brainwashing, more so than the
Hearst case.
"You're talking about hundreds of
people who were 'ordinary' citizens.
If it were the case that many of those
900 were murdered under the direct
order of Jim Jones (who had been a
respected citizen and leader before
the Guyana incident)...(and) if you
had access to those people, that
would raise the issue in a much more
difficult case."
Slightly more than five years ago,
on Feb. 4, 1974, Patty Hearst was
dragged out of her Berkeley apart
ment and kidnapped by members of
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA).
Two months later, on April 15, she
was a wanted criminal, accused of
aiding the SLA in a San Francisco
bank robbery.
Just what went through Patty
Hearst's mind in those two months
has remained a mystery, though the
case attracted international atten
tion. The remainder of Hearst's
seven-year sentence was commuted
by a presidential action last month,
month.
Arguments will continue to rage
over whether she willingly joined the
SLA following her abduction, or was
coerced into doing so.
Responsible for actions?
And arguments will rage over the
extent to which she should be held
responsible for her actions since she
had no control over being kidnapped
in the first place.
