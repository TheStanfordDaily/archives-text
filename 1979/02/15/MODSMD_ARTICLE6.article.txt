employees were told of the

Millet said the Times Tribune
will be a multi-edition news
paper published Monday

through Saturday.-
Headquarters and all pro
duction will be at the Times
building in Palo Alto. The Red
wood City plant will be re
tained and will house branch
editorial and advertising of
fices.
"Merger is the logical thing
to do from the standpoint of
economic efficiency," Millet
said. "It was apparent that we
could not continue to operate
two separate newspaper plants
seven miles apart, producing
two newspapers with overlap
ping circulation."
He said that merger of the
Times and Tribune was in PNl's

plans long before the com
pany's acquisition ]an. 1, 1978

and with 185,000 households,
dictated creation of an area
newspaper, Millet said.
Frank J. O'Neill, PNI general
manager, said both the Times
and Tribune have increased
circulation in the past year.
The Times Tribune, he said,
hopes to increase the current
combined circulation of 66,200
to 70,000 by the end of the year.
The Times is 86 years old; the
Tribune is 56.

O'Neill said that "newspap
ers throughout the country are
going to be watching to see
how successful we are. They'll
be watching to see if we can
bring out a brand new product
in an area where two papers
have been delivered for more
than half a century and pro
duce something that will satisfy
readers and advertisers."
PNI said the merger would
end duplication of jobs in
editorial and other depart
ments, creating a surplus of
personnel who can be put to
work on new jobs. The firm
said that it also had hired more
editorial employees in antici
pation of the merger and an
ticipated news-gathering
needs for the newspaper.
In addition to Millet and
O'Neill, management of the
Times Tribune will include
David Burgin as editorial direc
tor, David N. Schutz as as
sociate editor, Glenn Brown as
managing editor and Jack Sil
vey as assistant managing
editor.
Ray Dipiazza is director of
sales, Mike Weaver is planning
director, Fred Gross is produc
