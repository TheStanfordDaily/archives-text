# Computer games at LOTS

Stardate 4003,98 â€” The En
terprise is currently in quad
rant 3-5, sector 2-5. Long range
scanners reveal that there are
five Klingons in the next quad
rant. The Enterprise heads off
at warp six to meet her relent
less foes. She is caught in a
long range tractor beam, fires
her photon torpedoes . . .
Star Trek is one of about a
dozen games programmed
into the Low Overhead Time
Sharing (LOTS) computer
which many LJniversity stu
dents use to occupy their lei
sure time.
According to Ralph Corin,
manager of LOTS, Star Trek
and Adventurer are the most
popular games at LOTS. Other
games include Gin, Go, Master
and Monopoly.
The games are either written
by students or come from an
outside source. Some of them
came in the original program
ming of the computer system,
while others have been added
since then. If approved by
LOTS administrators,

student-designed programs
can be entered in the game di
rectory, a collection of files
that lists games available on the
computer.
Gorin noted that there has
been a general increase in the
popularity of the games. The
games are usually obtained
free and most are programmed
by volunteers. Gorin said, "No
computer manager in his right
mind would pay for them."
Some games, such as chess,
are excluded because of their
anticipated impact. While the
programs are relatively inex
pensive to insert into the com
puter, running them can often
be expensive in terms of com
puter time and usage. In chess,
the computer systematically
considers every possible move
that it can make.
Gorin said the games cannot
be played at any time. The gen
eral policy is "thou shalt not if
someone is waiting for a termi
nal." In addition, if the load av
erage, a measure of service
demand on the computer, is
too high, then a student is pro
hibited from using the facilities
to play games.

Enforcement of this regula
tion varies. Gorin said some of
the games are programmed to
self-destruct if the load average
is too high. Generally, how
ever, if the load is too high, the
computer prints a message ac
ross the screen asking the
player to stop. If a student con
tinues to play there are indi
viduals who check the termi
nals and ask the student to
leave.
Peak usage periods on the
computer are generally the
night before projects are due,
dead week and during mid
terms. The best time for stu
dents to play games is at odd
times during the week, Gorin
said. This is usually on Friday
and Saturday nights and Satur
day and Sunday mornings.
One time when games usage
is high is during finals week
because most computer sci
ence classes are finished by the
end of dead week.
Computer games are not dif
ficult to play. They require no
knowledge of programming,
only the rudiments of "logging
in" and opening an account.
Gin anyone?
