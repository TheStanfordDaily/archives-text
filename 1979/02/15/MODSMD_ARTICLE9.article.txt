# University has no money to pay SCIRE teachers

### Sue Goldfarb 
1 Michael Beard and Ted
Hedgpeth are professional
photography critics. They offer
a SCIRE course here in photo
graph critique with an em
phasis on photography as an
art form. They receive no pay.
Hedgpeth received a mas
ters degree in English from the
University and after earning his
degree, he taught Freshman
English here. He received a sal
ary for this position.
i Why the distinction between
teachers of Undergraduate
Special and SCIRE courses, and
Freshman English teachers?
. "On the face it looks like
we're being unfair," said Her
,ant Katchadourian, dean of
[undergraduate studies.
, "The most important reason
why we can't pay these
teachers is lack of money. We
have enough to pay some and
not others, so it is a matter of
choice. But many University
activities do not have fund
ing," he said.
Not enough money
1 "In order to pay all those
teachers we'd have to approp
riate $50,000 more to those
programs, and we simply don't
have it," said Ruth Sloan, assis
tant dean for administration.
However, last year an Un
dergraduate Special in wo
men's studies was taught here,
and funds from ASSU were
used to pay the instructor, ac
cording to Laura Selznick, di
rector of Undergraduate Spe
cials.
"Sometimes outside organi
zations want a course taught

and free money for that pur
pose," she said.
"Last year a visiting profes
sor was hired to teach without
compensation from the Uni
versity, but the ASSU Speakers
Bureau contracted and paid
her. In that sense, she was not
receiving a salary from the Uni
versity, but she did get paid by
the students," Selznick said.
Possibility of pay
According to Beard and
Hedgpeth, they were told
there was always the possibility
of pay when they agreed to
teach here.
"Nobody should tell anyone
there's any possibility of being
paid," Katchadourian said.
He explained that when the
Undergraduate Special Prog
ram and the SCIRE program
were established, no budget
ary provisions were made for
them, but the Freshman En
glish program originated with
the budget.
"Once a situation has an es
tablished position, it is difficult
to change it. When the budget
is made each year, those prog
rams that have had money the
year before get it again,"
Katchadourian said.
Money inadequate
"All the money we have is
proving to be considerably less
adequate to cover the prog
rams we already have," he
said.
According to Katchadourian
and Selznick, the Under
graduate Specials Program
permits the teaching of classes
that otherwise would not be of
fered. Katchadourian said that

his popular class, Human Sex
uality, began as an Under
graduate Special.
"I did not receive any com
pensation for teaching Human
Sex until the Human Biology
department adopted it as part
of their curriculum," Katch
adourian said.
"Someone who is not a regu
lar faculty member can teach
here with a faculty sponsor,"
said Maria Chacon, co-director
of SCIRE.
Fewer grad students
"Graduate students used to
teach on the subjects of their
dissertations but now there is
pressure to graduate as soon as
possible, so the courses aren't
as diverse," Chacon said.
"An instructional budget
might restrict the number of
courses that could be taught,
in the sense that if 60 great
proposals are offered and only
50 courses are budgeted, we'd
have to cut otherwise taught
courses," Selznick said.
All Undergraduate Special
and SCIRE course instructors
are required to write proposals
for their class offerings. They

must have faculty sponsors to
supervise their programs, and
they must be well qualified in
their fields.
Same quality
"We expect the same kind of
quality education from Under
graduate Special teachers as
Freshman Seminar teachers.
We don't expect the Freshman
Seminar teachers to be bet
ter," Sloan said.
"The administration and fa
culty decide where, among the
various claimants to money,
the money will go," Katch
adourian said. According to
him, they find Freshman Semi
nars and the proposed West
ern Culture program more
academically deserving of
money than the Under
graduate Specials.
"We are hired in one sense,

but in another we are not,"
Beard said.
He said that although they
do not get paid, he and
Hedgpeth receive side be
nefits. They have library cards
and faculty cards, and "we get
to use Stanford's reputation to
the full benefit," Hedgpeth
said.
Prop. 13
Beard said that after Proposi
tion 13 passed, he and
Hedgpeth were unable to im
plement their course at Footh
ill College for pay, as they had
in the past.
"Even though we realize
there is no way for us to get
paid right now, we think our
ideas are worth teaching and
we're dedicated to our ideas,"
Beard said.
He said they were working

toward the possibility of get
ting paid, and in the meantime
they enjoyed their interaction
with students.
Beard emphasized that
photography is taught as a
how-to course here, as op
posed to an art. "We must
educate enough people to put
photography into practice as a
foremost art form," he said.
Critical approach
Beard, with a master of fine
arts degree from the Art Insti
tute, said he has developed a
critical approach to photo
graphy. With Hedgpeth he cu
rates art shows and published
Latent Images, an international
quarterly photography
magazine.
Beard complained that
photography here is "rele
gated to the basement, both

literally and figuratively."
Although they are not under
the obligation of monetary
compensation, Beard and
Hedgpeth said they think it is
their professional ethical re
sponsibility to continue teach
ing. They said they are attempt
ing to change attitudes of stu
dents toward photography,
out of their own time, without
compensation.
"These types of programs
have proved very good and I
fight tooth and nail to support
them," Katchadourian said.
Sloan said, "These programs
have never had financial back
ing and they can't expect any
drastic changes within the next
decade. It's likely that they're
having trouble getting people
to teach for nothing, though."

Beard said.
He said they were working

toward the possibility of get
ting paid, and in the meantime
they enjoyed their interaction
with students.
Beard emphasized that
photography is taught as a
how-to course here, as op
posed to an art. "We must
educate enough people to put
photography into practice as a
foremost art form," he said.
Critical approach
Beard, with a master of fine
arts degree from the Art Insti
tute, said he has developed a
critical approach to photo
graphy. With Hedgpeth he cu
rates art shows and published
Latent Images, an international
quarterly photography
magazine.
Beard complained that
photography here is "rele
gated to the basement, both

literally and figuratively."
Although they are not under
the obligation of monetary
compensation, Beard and
Hedgpeth said they think it is
their professional ethical re
sponsibility to continue teach
ing. They said they are attempt
ing to change attitudes of stu
dents toward photography,
out of their own time, without
compensation.
"These types of programs
have proved very good and I
fight tooth and nail to support
them," Katchadourian said.
Sloan said, "These programs
have never had financial back
ing and they can't expect any
drastic changes within the next
decade. It's likely that they're
having trouble getting people
to teach for nothing, though."
1 Michael Beard and Ted
Hedgpeth are professional
photography critics. They offer
a SCIRE course here in photo
graph critique with an em
phasis on photography as an
art form. They receive no pay.
Hedgpeth received a mas
ters degree in English from the
University and after earning his
degree, he taught Freshman
English here. He received a sal
ary for this position.
i Why the distinction between
teachers of Undergraduate
Special and SCIRE courses, and
Freshman English teachers?
. "On the face it looks like
we're being unfair," said Her
,ant Katchadourian, dean of
[undergraduate studies.
, "The most important reason
why we can't pay these
teachers is lack of money. We
have enough to pay some and
not others, so it is a matter of
choice. But many University
activities do not have fund
ing," he said.
Not enough money
1 "In order to pay all those
teachers we'd have to approp
riate $50,000 more to those
programs, and we simply don't
have it," said Ruth Sloan, assis
tant dean for administration.
However, last year an Un
dergraduate Special in wo
men's studies was taught here,
and funds from ASSU were
used to pay the instructor, ac
cording to Laura Selznick, di
rector of Undergraduate Spe
cials.
"Sometimes outside organi
zations want a course taught

and free money for that pur
pose," she said.
"Last year a visiting profes
sor was hired to teach without
compensation from the Uni
versity, but the ASSU Speakers
Bureau contracted and paid
her. In that sense, she was not
receiving a salary from the Uni
versity, but she did get paid by
the students," Selznick said.
Possibility of pay
According to Beard and
Hedgpeth, they were told
there was always the possibility
of pay when they agreed to
teach here.
"Nobody should tell anyone
there's any possibility of being
paid," Katchadourian said.
He explained that when the
Undergraduate Special Prog
ram and the SCIRE program
were established, no budget
ary provisions were made for
them, but the Freshman En
glish program originated with
the budget.
"Once a situation has an es
tablished position, it is difficult
to change it. When the budget
is made each year, those prog
rams that have had money the
year before get it again,"
Katchadourian said.
Money inadequate
"All the money we have is
proving to be considerably less
adequate to cover the prog
rams we already have," he
said.
According to Katchadourian
and Selznick, the Under
graduate Specials Program
permits the teaching of classes
that otherwise would not be of
fered. Katchadourian said that

his popular class, Human Sex
uality, began as an Under
graduate Special.
"I did not receive any com
pensation for teaching Human
Sex until the Human Biology
department adopted it as part
of their curriculum," Katch
adourian said.
"Someone who is not a regu
lar faculty member can teach
here with a faculty sponsor,"
said Maria Chacon, co-director
of SCIRE.
Fewer grad students
"Graduate students used to
teach on the subjects of their
dissertations but now there is
pressure to graduate as soon as
possible, so the courses aren't
as diverse," Chacon said.
"An instructional budget
might restrict the number of
courses that could be taught,
in the sense that if 60 great
proposals are offered and only
50 courses are budgeted, we'd
have to cut otherwise taught
courses," Selznick said.
All Undergraduate Special
and SCIRE course instructors
are required to write proposals
for their class offerings. They

must have faculty sponsors to
supervise their programs, and
they must be well qualified in
their fields.
Same quality
"We expect the same kind of
quality education from Under
graduate Special teachers as
Freshman Seminar teachers.
We don't expect the Freshman
Seminar teachers to be bet
ter," Sloan said.
"The administration and fa
culty decide where, among the
various claimants to money,
the money will go," Katch
adourian said. According to
him, they find Freshman Semi
nars and the proposed West
ern Culture program more
academically deserving of
money than the Under
graduate Specials.
"We are hired in one sense,

but in another we are not,"
Beard said.
He said that although they
do not get paid, he and
Hedgpeth receive side be
nefits. They have library cards
and faculty cards, and "we get
to use Stanford's reputation to
the full benefit," Hedgpeth
said.
Prop. 13
Beard said that after Proposi
tion 13 passed, he and
Hedgpeth were unable to im
plement their course at Footh
ill College for pay, as they had
in the past.
"Even though we realize
there is no way for us to get
