FILM FESTIVAL
THE HISTORIC AND RARE
PERFORMANCES
THE BEATLES To speak of them is to speak of more than
music. They have become musical folklore, a phenome
non, a timeless legend. From the days IWANTTOHOLD
YOUR HAND to HARD DAY'S NIGHT to HEY JUDE to LET
IT BE, they have been pioneers of rock and roll, creators of
and contributors to a cultural upheaval that has forever
altered the lives of entire generations. They defined the
musical demands of an entire era. They were great for
more than their music. The way they dressed, the way they
wore their hair created fads which swept the world. Disband
ed for eight years, their legacy will not die: Any rumors of a
reunion are met with universal interest. Such was their
magic. We present their rarest filmed performances.
