# Hayakawa hits U.S. foreign policy
## 
### Leah Halper 
Complaining that the United States,
has taken a "paper tiger" role in
world affairs, U.S. Sen. S.I.
Hayakawa, criticized U.S. foreign
policy yesterday at a luncheon meet
ing of the South Bay Commonwealth
Club in Palo Alto.
"Ever since the collapse of Viet
nam we've taken a let's-wait-and-see
attitude towards troubles in the
world," the California Republican
senator said. "We're not doing any
thing in the meantime, and that's a
disgraceful situation for a great na
tion to be in."
Hayakawa hailed Mexican Presi
dent lose Portillo for his recent pub
lic admonishment of President
Jimmy Carter and his Mexican
policies, saying, "I'm glad Portillo
gave him hell, because somebody's
got to educate the man."
He saved his angriest criticism,
however, for the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the Un
ited States and the People's Republic
of China.
Calling China the "biggest con
centration camp in the world," he
commented that Carter's recogni
tion of that country "does not jibe
well with the president's emphasis
on human rights." Hayakawa also
complained that the cost of normali
zation will fall to American taxpayers.
"We should not be misled by the
administration's propaganda that the
opening of China will result in huge
financial benefits to us," he told the
audience of several hundred, which
included former ambassador to

Ghana Shirley Temple Black, John
Bunzel, former president of San Jose
State and senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, and Palo Alto Mayor
Scott Carey.
Billions and billions
"We are not told how the Peoples'
Republic will pay for the billions and
billions of dollars that they are plan
ning to get for development. I'm af
raid that our government or the
World Bank will have to pay for it.
What do the Chinese have to offer us
— hog bristles?"
For this reason, Hayakawa called
the treaty "absolutely indefensible."
He also objected to the way the ad
ministration handled negotiations.
"China's government needed our
recognition more than we needed
theirs, so we were in a position to
drive a hard bargain. But we did not
even demand that China not use
force against Taiwan."
Involved in congressional action to
curb what he terms Carter's "used
car salesman" promotion of the tre
aty, Hayakawa said he thoroughly
disapproves of "selling Taiwan short,
and on this issue I fully intend to be a
troublemaker."
Hands Off South Africa
Also criticizing Carter's policy of
hands-off in southern Africa,
Hayakawa said that the United States
is needed to monitor the upcoming
spring elections in Rhodesia. "I'm
ashamed of our government for not
giving a damn about what's happen
ing there," he said.
Suggesting that American busines
ses can bring about social change in

South Africa, he added that he op
poses divestiture of holdings in
American companies that do busi
ness there.
"If you want to produce social
change in South Africa, the way to do
it is to see that South Africa is so
prosperous that they have to train
blacks to go up and up and up in the
hierarchy. American companies are
already setting a good example there
forequality in opportunity, pay, and
employment practices."
At a press conference following
the Commonwealth luncheon,
Hayakawa answered questions about
his position on revoking the visas of
Iranian students and his views on
Rep. Pete McCloskey's (R-Menlo
Park) legislation to create a mandat
ory youth service program.
No position yet
Admitting that he is not familiar
with the specific provisions of
McCloskey's bill, Hayakawa said he
has not yet taken a position on the
issue. However, he added that "I see
no objection to being prepared for
whatever contingencies arise.
Everyone ought to serve this country
fora couple of years of his or her life,
I believe."
"When it's come to a point of de
stroying property or threatening per
sonal liberty, such as in Beverly Hills
recently and at San Francisco Sate,
the police action is necessary," he
said when asked about Iranian stu
dents in this country.
"If students break the law — and I
don't care if it's Japanese, British,
French, or Iranian students, they

break a contract with the United
States. I think that after due process
they should be punished."
Hayakawa added that "much can
be said against the shah, but it must
be admitted that he provided for a
considerable time a degree of stabil
ity." Because of America's reaction
to Iran's internal strife, he speculated
that Soviet intervention is a "real
possibility."
As a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Hayakawa says
he is concerned with rumors about
Saudi Arabia and other Middle East
ern oil producers making overtures
to the USSR.
Pointing out that America's NATO
allies depend heavily on Iranian oil,
and mentioning U.S. need for
continued trade with Arab nations,
Hayakawa lamented that, "in this
part of the world we do not have
many friends left."

Saudi Arabia and other Middle East
ern oil producers making overtures
to the USSR.
Pointing out that America's NATO
allies depend heavily on Iranian oil,
and mentioning U.S. need for
continued trade with Arab nations,
Hayakawa lamented that, "in this
part of the world we do not have
many friends left."

Sen. S.I. Hayakawa lashed out at the United States' "paper tiger" role in foreign
policy yesterday at a luncheon speech in Palo Alto.
Complaining that the United States,
has taken a "paper tiger" role in
world affairs, U.S. Sen. S.I.
Hayakawa, criticized U.S. foreign
policy yesterday at a luncheon meet
ing of the South Bay Commonwealth
Club in Palo Alto.
"Ever since the collapse of Viet
nam we've taken a let's-wait-and-see
attitude towards troubles in the
world," the California Republican
senator said. "We're not doing any
thing in the meantime, and that's a
disgraceful situation for a great na
tion to be in."
Hayakawa hailed Mexican Presi
dent lose Portillo for his recent pub
lic admonishment of President
Jimmy Carter and his Mexican
policies, saying, "I'm glad Portillo
gave him hell, because somebody's
got to educate the man."
He saved his angriest criticism,
however, for the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the Un
ited States and the People's Republic
of China.
Calling China the "biggest con
centration camp in the world," he
commented that Carter's recogni
tion of that country "does not jibe
well with the president's emphasis
on human rights." Hayakawa also
complained that the cost of normali
zation will fall to American taxpayers.
"We should not be misled by the
administration's propaganda that the
opening of China will result in huge
financial benefits to us," he told the
audience of several hundred, which
included former ambassador to

Ghana Shirley Temple Black, John
Bunzel, former president of San Jose
State and senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, and Palo Alto Mayor
Scott Carey.
Billions and billions
"We are not told how the Peoples'
Republic will pay for the billions and
billions of dollars that they are plan
ning to get for development. I'm af
raid that our government or the
World Bank will have to pay for it.
What do the Chinese have to offer us
— hog bristles?"
For this reason, Hayakawa called
the treaty "absolutely indefensible."
He also objected to the way the ad
ministration handled negotiations.
"China's government needed our
recognition more than we needed
theirs, so we were in a position to
drive a hard bargain. But we did not
even demand that China not use
force against Taiwan."
Involved in congressional action to
curb what he terms Carter's "used
car salesman" promotion of the tre
aty, Hayakawa said he thoroughly
disapproves of "selling Taiwan short,
and on this issue I fully intend to be a
troublemaker."
Hands Off South Africa
Also criticizing Carter's policy of
hands-off in southern Africa,
Hayakawa said that the United States
is needed to monitor the upcoming
spring elections in Rhodesia. "I'm
ashamed of our government for not
giving a damn about what's happen
ing there," he said.
Suggesting that American busines
ses can bring about social change in

South Africa, he added that he op
poses divestiture of holdings in
American companies that do busi
ness there.
"If you want to produce social
change in South Africa, the way to do
it is to see that South Africa is so
prosperous that they have to train
blacks to go up and up and up in the
hierarchy. American companies are
already setting a good example there
forequality in opportunity, pay, and
employment practices."
At a press conference following
the Commonwealth luncheon,
Hayakawa answered questions about
his position on revoking the visas of
Iranian students and his views on
Rep. Pete McCloskey's (R-Menlo
Park) legislation to create a mandat
ory youth service program.
No position yet
Admitting that he is not familiar
with the specific provisions of
McCloskey's bill, Hayakawa said he
has not yet taken a position on the
issue. However, he added that "I see
no objection to being prepared for
whatever contingencies arise.
Everyone ought to serve this country
fora couple of years of his or her life,
I believe."
"When it's come to a point of de
stroying property or threatening per
sonal liberty, such as in Beverly Hills
recently and at San Francisco Sate,
the police action is necessary," he
said when asked about Iranian stu
dents in this country.
"If students break the law — and I
don't care if it's Japanese, British,
French, or Iranian students, they

break a contract with the United
States. I think that after due process
they should be punished."
Hayakawa added that "much can
be said against the shah, but it must
be admitted that he provided for a
considerable time a degree of stabil
ity." Because of America's reaction
to Iran's internal strife, he speculated
that Soviet intervention is a "real
possibility."
As a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Hayakawa says
he is concerned with rumors about
Saudi Arabia and other Middle East
ern oil producers making overtures
to the USSR.
Pointing out that America's NATO
allies depend heavily on Iranian oil,
