# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Sororities supported 
### 
When the Board of Trustees decided,
in December 1977, to amend the Univer
sity's 33-year-old ban on sororities, it
acted reluctantly— in large part to con
form with the federal government's Title
IX regulations regarding equal educa
tional opportunity regardless of sex.
Anxious to avoid any repetition of the
conditions which led to the original 1944
ban, the trustees stressed local au
tonomy in sorority operations and made
it clear that national sororities would be
able to return to campus only on the
University's terms.
Proponents of sororities here in turn
emphasized their intention "to make
sure sororities here will be well-suited to
the Stanford environment." But now, a
little more than a year later, the inflexibil
ity of both the University and the nation
als have placed eight new sororities bet
ween the twin oblivions of Scylla and
Charybdis.
The sororities remain officially unre
cognized by the University — which bars
them from the use of any campus facility
— because some of the nationals insist
on the use of letters of recommendation
from sorority alumnae during their
membership selection process, a prac
tice which the University views as "dis
criminatory."
Last year, although the sororities had
not resolved problems concerning the
University's requirement proscribing
letters of recommendation, they were
allowed to rush on campus. Implicit in
this allowance was the hope that within a
year the disagreement between the Uni
versity and the dissenting nationals
would be resolved.
Such has not been the case.
If no compromise can be reached, the
sororities will ultimately be forced to
choose whether or not to retain their
national affiliations or form purely local
organizations. We feel that this is a
choice only individual sorority members
can decide for themselves.
But the immediate impact is far more
damaging. Sororities will be forced to
rush off campus, this spring.

In no way do we intend that the Uni
versity's policies favoring local au
tonomy be ignored. We agree with
Inter-Sorority Council President Tammy
Ritchey that the University policies
which apply to sororities, such as the
prohibition of letters of recommenda
tion, are "good, and in the long run will
prove beneficial to sororities."
Choice for students is the issue here.
The intent of the trustees' amendment of
the ban on sororities was to give women
here the same choice as men. If men can
choose to join fraternities, women
should be able to choose to join
sororities.
Enforcement of the University's policy
in this case would only serve to decrease
the likelihood that this choice will exist
by placing substantial obstacles in the
way of a successful rush by sororities.
For this reason, we strongly urge that
the University allow sororities to hold
rush on campus this year. Not only
would this remove the obstacles of the
off-campus rush and provide more equal
opportunity for all women here to look
into sororities, but it would also add
some continuity to the sororities' efforts
— something which has been difficult to
maintain over the past few years.
An off-campus rush this year — only
the second rush for the new sororities —
could cripple the sororities perma
nently. In their embryonic stage of de
velopment it seems reasonable that they
were unsure of how to resolve the issues
facing them.
There is little doubt that the sororities
delayed in submitting their proposals to
the administration. But we believe the
sororities delayed because of uncer
tainty and a desire to examine all possi
ble compromises and alternatives.
Sororities should not be penalized for
such a delay.
The University has little to lose if an
on-campus rush is permitted this year.
But the sororities — and the women in
terested in participating— have signific
antly more to lose if it is not.
