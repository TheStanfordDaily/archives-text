## Dissent: force the issue 
### 
The continuing dispute over national
sorority requirements of a letter of re
ference for prospective members is at
best disheartening. This is especially
true in light of nearly universal agree
ment that the University policies regard
ing selective organizations are fair and
desirable.
Because the policy has been deemed a
fair one, the University is correct in pro
hibiting local chapters from using on
campus facilities until they abide by the
rules.
Letters of reference are a national re
quirement which serve no purpose.
Every indication is that they are not used
locally and many sorority leaders openly
admit the worthlessness of this national
rule.
We feel that if local sorority chapters
truly believe the requirement to be
foolish, it is time they stand up to their
parent organization.
If locals feel the letters are purposeful,
then they should realize that University
approval of their organization will not
come, and they should make arrange
ments for an off-campus existence.
We do not wish to tell the sororities
what to do. That is the business of the
members. We do not, however, believe
that postponing the issue until rush is
complete this spring will serve any pur
pose.

True, moving rush off campus will
likely hurt the organizations. But the
damage need not occur. By turning
down the sorority applications for rec
ognition, administrators can effectively
force the issuenow. Nationals and locals
will have to make the big decision â€” will
we waive the letter requirement for the
University, or will we be an off-campus
organization?
And if procrastination by the nationals
means that, even with University recog
nition refused, sororities have to have
off-campus rush, all the better. By forc
ing rush off campus, nationals and locals
will recognize what a precarious posi
tion they are placing themselves in with
respect to membership.
And if procrastination from the na
tionals ensues, the locals might note that
this may mean the nationals are not re
ally all that interested in having a Stan
ford chapter. Such a move might just
signal to local members that it may be
time to form a purely local organization,
despite the dubious advantages to hav
ing a national affiliation.
Archaic requirements should not
stand in the way of worthwhile clubs for
students. It is time the University forced
the issue and settled it once and for all.
