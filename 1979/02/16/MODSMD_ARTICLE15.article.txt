## Students being phased out here 
### 
Have you noticed a difference in any of
your friends these last few days? We are all
being phased out. No student here is safe.
You could be next.
It all began when I complained to the
housing office about the new shower
heads. Although they were great for mist
ing plants, I could not get wet. If I was
lucky, I would come out of my morning
shower feeling dank.
The next cause for complaint was my
discovery that the 60-watt light bulbs in the
utility closet had been replaced by4o-watt
bulbs.
Now, I am not what you would call a
rabble-rousing sort. All I want is my degree
and if I have some fun and meaningful
experiences along the way, great. But I'm
not a trouble-maker.
The light bulbs were the last straw. Read
ing circuits by 40 watts is like — well —
reading chemistry by 40 watts. I went back
to the housing office to file a complaint
and was referred to an office in the back of
the building. I entered this office and
found a grey-haired man in a white smock
sitting at a cluttered desk amongst cages of
rats that badly needed cleaning. The
cages, that is. I told him my gripe.

"Don't you believe in energy conserva
tion?" he asked me gruffly.
"Of course," I said, "but my eyes ache
and my unwashed regions are mildew
ing..."
"There are no 'buts'!" he barked, prac
tically squashing the rat he handled. "You
are either for conserving energy or against
it. What are you?"
Well, I had no choice. Like I said, I'm not
a trouble-maker, and the rat's pink eyes
bulged out horribly. I nodded my head
and mumbled, "I'm for it."
"Excellent," he said, shaking my hand.
"My name is Dr. Matson, and you're just
the student we need to test our latest
energy conservation measure."
The next thing I knew I was lying on a
table in the surgery ward of a hospital. Dr.
Matson was looking down at me, smiling.
"You, my friend," he spoke, "will be the
greatest innovation in modern energy
conservation since non-disposable toilet
paper."
I asked him what he meant by that.
"It's a simple operation, really," he
explained. "All we're doing is implanting a
small module in your spinal cord that will
regulate the voltage running up and down

it. Vou see, the average central nervous
system runs wastefully on four volts of
electricity. This operation will make you
run on an efficient two volts, reducing
energy consumption by half..."
His voice trailed off as the anesthetic
took effect. When I came to, I was back in
my dormitory, lying in my own bed. No
one believes me when I tell this tale, and
you should hear the awful things they say
about me having tried marijuana for the
first time. Yet it all happened. I know this
because I have changed.
Because of the operation, most math
problems elude me. My reflexes are so
slow that I've been hit by bikes six times in
the last week. I've had to change my major
to communication. I now like country
western music and cheer outright when
zucchini is served in the food service.
There are, of course, the advantages.
This morning I found four 60-watt bulbs at
my door with a note that read: "Your
worthy sacrifice has given you two volts to
squander elsewhere. Enjoy."
My eyes no longer ache when I read, but
being a true energy conserver, I now pre
fer pretty pictures.

I asked him what he meant by that.
"It's a simple operation, really," he
explained. "All we're doing is implanting a
small module in your spinal cord that will
regulate the voltage running up and down

it. Vou see, the average central nervous
system runs wastefully on four volts of
electricity. This operation will make you
run on an efficient two volts, reducing
energy consumption by half..."
His voice trailed off as the anesthetic
took effect. When I came to, I was back in
my dormitory, lying in my own bed. No
one believes me when I tell this tale, and
you should hear the awful things they say
about me having tried marijuana for the
first time. Yet it all happened. I know this
because I have changed.
Because of the operation, most math
problems elude me. My reflexes are so
slow that I've been hit by bikes six times in
the last week. I've had to change my major
to communication. I now like country
western music and cheer outright when
zucchini is served in the food service.
There are, of course, the advantages.
This morning I found four 60-watt bulbs at
my door with a note that read: "Your
worthy sacrifice has given you two volts to
squander elsewhere. Enjoy."
My eyes no longer ache when I read, but
being a true energy conserver, I now pre
fer pretty pictures.
