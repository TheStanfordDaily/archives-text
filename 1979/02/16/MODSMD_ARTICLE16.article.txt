## Right-to-die legislation needed 
### 
On the medical ward of a
local hospital lies the man with
the alphabet board.
He has disseminated lung
cancer which has destroyed his
ability to speak, and he must
communicate by pointing to
the letters on his board in
sequence. Regularand increas
ing doses of morphine are his
only respite from severe bone
pain resulting from skeletal
spread of his terminal illness.
Each morning, a team of physi
cians visits him, smiles com
fortingly in unison, and asks if
he needs anything. Slowly and
deliberately an emaciated
hand spells out: "I W-A-N-T
T-O D-l-E."
The above scenario is about
a very real individual who
exemplifies a major problem
which modern medicine has
created along with its miracles.
Essentially, man's relentless
assault on disease has created a
new population which might
appropriately be termed "the
living dead."
Thousands of patients suffer
ing from a wide variety of ter
minal afflictions, both young
and old, share a common
dedth wish which will free
them from the artificial pro
longation of an agonizing exis
tence. This fact raises a number

of ethical and legal questions
regarding the right to life, and
suggests the need for legisla
tion to prevent such medical
injustice.
Dalton Trumbo's novel
Johnny Cot His Gun affords a
vivid appreciation of what life
must be like for "the living
dead." It describes a soldier
who has been maimed in com
bat; he can no longer see,
hear, smell ortalk, and his four
extremities are gone. How
ever, his mind has remained
unscathed, alive without sen
sory input or the ability to
communicate feelings. Often,
he cannot distinguish dreams
from reality or past from pre
sent. Worst of all, he cannot
commit suicide and must live
on in the hell of his own
thoughts.
The man with the alphabet
board similarly cannot take his
own life, for he is in restraints
and under supervision. But he
differs in his ability to express
his desire.
However, despite the fact
that his doctors are under oath
to do what is best for him, exist
ing laws do not permit them to
kill him, even in a merciful
manner. Euthanasia is the term
given to such a procedure, and
undeniably this should be

legalized in situations where
the involved patient clearly
asks for it. The individual right
to die is one which no govern
ment, agency or institution
should control.
The issue becomes more
complex when, as is often the
case, the patient's condition
resembles that of Trumbo's
character â€” unable to com
municate inner thoughts even
if present. The Karen Ann
Quinlan case of several years
ago raised the dilemma of
whether relatives, physicians
or the judicial system should
determine the fate of such in
dividuals.
Termination of life-support
systems is pearly indicated in
situations where, in the opin
ion of consulting medical
teams, there is no hope of use
ful recovery. Although in cer
tain instances the patient's "liv
ing" existence may be impor
tant to family structure for
socio-psychological reasons,
society must evaluate the po
tential internal agony which

may bo occurring.
Perhaps a legitimate and
satisfactory compromise
would be a legal document
stating whether medical opin
ion or a particular relative
should be allowed to decide in
favor of euthanasia, much like
a will. However, this system
would clearly not be applicable
in situations where the patient
is a minor.
Although the solution to this
dilemma is not clear-cut, the
indication for new legislation
governing the right to die is
evident. The Hippocratic Oath
states, "above all, harm no
one," but the present situation
is such that physicians cannot
help but violate it in certain in
stances.
It is a moral sin to keep such
individuals as the man with the
alphabet board alive; we ap
preciate the need for mercy
killing of animals, and now
must apply some ot this wis
dom to our own species.
