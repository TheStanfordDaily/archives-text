Recycling centers
threatened
The ASSU Recycling Center
here just applied for $18,666
under California Senate Bill
650, the Anti-Litter Tax bill,
which included a funding pro
vision for recycling centers.
Unfortunately, the State Se
nate hurriedly voted to repeal
58650 on Monday, following a
flood of phone calls from irate
business operators affected by
the tax.
The repeal bill (58373) is ex
pected to reach the State As
sembly floor on Tuesday. If the
repeal passes, the recycling
center here as well as some 140
other centers throughout
California will lose a total of
$4.5 million in funding.
For us at the ASSU Recycling
Center this means we will have
to ask the students for more
fee assessments. However, for
many other recycling centers
(without alternative funding

sources such as we have here)
repeal of 58650 will mean fi
nancial collapse.
Students can demonstrate
their support for recycling, and
the ASSU recycling program in
particular, by calling or writing
their local state assemblyman
and expressing their opposi
tion to the repeal of 58650. The
Palo Alto area assemblyman,
Victor Calvo, can be reached at
941-4640.
Calvo is especially important
because he is chairman of the
Resource, Land Use, and
Energy Committee, which will
vote on the bill before it
reaches the assembly floor.
For further on
the implications and the exact
nature of the bill and the repeal
movement call us at the ASSU
Recycling Center office at 497-
0915.

Editorial
focus questioned
As active members of the
ASSU, we are concerned about
the editorial on senate reform
(Daily, Feb. 8).
That there is a need for se
nate reform begs no repeating.
Many of the past problems of
the senate have been alleviated
But we question the editorial's
focus on the senate.
The senate is only one part of
the ASSU. A complete investi
gation of the problems of the
association cannot be centered
solely on the senate and its
members. We feel that the best
guide for a thorough evalua
tion is the ASSU constitution,
which focuses on the functions
of the senate, Council of Presi
dents, Nom-Com and the fi
nancial manager, as well as the
overall relationship of the
ASSU with the University (fi
nancially and politically).
While reviewing the con

stitution, the senate Rules
Committee will give equal
weight to all of these areas in
order to search out all possible
problems and reforms.
We hope that through the
Little Eleven Conference as
well as contacts with many
other schools and their student
associations that we will gain
some important insights.
We also need input from all
interested students. Indeed,
the senate task forces research
ing the ASSU's problems are
actively soliciting all possible
student involvement.
We are reviewing the con
stitution in hopes of using it as
a basis for a complete evalua
tion of the students' relation
ship with the ASSU and the AS
SU's relationship with the Uni
versity. We hope that we need
only to revise the constitution.
But, should the senate decide
that substantial changes are
needed, we would bewillingto
do just that.

Thus, the comments in the
editorial are well-intended but
incomplete. We urge anyone
concerned about the students'
voice and influence in the Uni
versity to please help us in our
evaluation of the entire ASSU.
We are open to ail comments
and recommendations. The
possibilities of the ASSU's
power are great; we need only
to focus our energies in the
proper directions.
