After hours of discussion, the
ASSU Senate last night by a 5 to Ovote
adopted a resolution ordering an of
ficial ASSU task force sent to Gol
den, Colo, to investigate the al
legedly unfair labor practices of the
Adolph Coors Co.
The senate's decision was reached
after hearing representatives from
both Coors and the Coors boycott
committee.
The task force will consist of a
senator, a Council of Presidents (COP)
member, a Daily reporter and a Public
Interest Research Croup (PIRG) rep
resentative. A second senator will be
sent contingent upon funding.
According to senafe Chairperson
Peter Stamos, the task force will proba
bly leave for Golden Wednesday morn
ing next week and return on Friday
night.
Earlier in the evening, it had been
unclear whether the senate would
reach a decision on the task force. At
that time ASSU Co-President Andrew
Goldenkranz said that "if the senate
doesn't send a task force, we (the
COP) will."
Representatives from Coors ad
dressed the meeting in what one
Coors representative termed an ef
fort to set straight the "twisted and
distorted" reporting of Coors' re
cord of minority treatment.
|oe Benites, community relations
manager for Coors and former
chairman of the Arizona State Civil
Rights Commission, said the "real
issue is one of union vs. corporation,

not human rights, Chicano rights,
women's rights, or civil rights."
According to Benites, seniority
was the main issue in the strike by
AFL-CIO Local 366 against Coors. The
company wanted a clause that would
enable it to override the seniority re
quirement for promotion because
many of the minority workers hadn't
been with the company long enough
to be promoted as swiftly as the
company would like, he said.
Goldenkranz responded that the
controversy involves much more
than the issues raised by Benites. At
issue are allegedly degrading
policies in Coors employment con
tracts, he said.
In other business, the senate also
stressed that March 13 is the deadline
for submitting mascot nominations
to the senate for approval, pursuant
to a resolution adopted by the senate
at its last meeting.
According to this resolution, each
mascot nomination must be accom
panied by a petition with at least 100
student signatures and an artist's
portrayal of the nominee.
Those nominees accepted by the
senate will be placed on the ballot for
the mascot referendum before the
students in the ASSU spring elec
tions.
Nominees rejected by the senate
can still be placed on the ballot if they
are accompanied by a petition with at
least 500 student signatures, accord
ing to Sen. Erik Thompson.
The senate also resolved:
— to appoint Dayna Goldfine as

temporary ASSU Elections Commis
sioner as a replacement for Will Ni
xon, who stopped out of school, and
to direct her to publicize the upcom
ing mascot election;
— to allocate $50 to the Council of
Presidents (COP) task force on un
dergraduate financial aid and $100 to
the travel fund of the Little Eleven
conference out of the COP's dis
cretionary fund;
— to establish, upon the recom
mendation of the chair, a committee
to investigate the duties of the ASSU
secretary, Mary Rich;
— to place the LSJUMB's fee as
sessment proposal on the spring bal
lot.
