The University, in conjunc
tion with several other Ameri
can universities, is coordinat
ing a program which will allow
students to study and work in
Brazil, according to Corb
Smith, associate director of the
overseas studies office.
The inter-university program
is slated to begin in June, Smith
said. Stanford is working in
conjuction with Johns Hopkins
and Indiana Universities, as
well as with the University of
California, University of Wis
consin and the State University
of New York. The program is
open to all qualified under
graduate and graduate stu
dents. Two Stanford students
will be among the 25 students
selected to participate in 1979-
80, Smith said.
The participants will spend
13 months in Brazil. Students
will spend most of their time in
Sao Paulo, a growing city of
more than 8 million, located in
the southeastern section of the

country. Students will attend
the University of Sao Paulo, an
institution which enrolls more
than 35,000 students and offers
a wide range of courses.
According to Smith, "The
University of Sao Paulo is one
of the best universities in Latin
America."
Like other overseas prog
rams, students enrolled at the
Brazilian university receive
Stanford academic credit for
coursework completed while
on tour and pay standard Stan

ford tuition.
Initially, participating stu
dents will live with Brazilian
families but may move out
when they find housing in
apartments or boarding
houses, Smith said.
A student must have
achieved junior status by June
in order to be eligible for the
program. Students must also
have completed some college
level language study, prefera
bly at least two years of Por
tuguese. However, Smith

noted that the language re
quirement was "somewhat
flexible."
Brazil is a large and growing
country, one that deserves
study, according to Smith.
Brazil has the tenth largest
gross national product in the
world. Director of Overseas
Studies Mark Mancall noted,
"Brazil's one of the most im
portant and least studied
societies with the potential of
becoming a major Third World
power."
