# Swimmers visit Cal, SC pool

for the third consecutive
week, the Cardinal men's
swimming team will be locked
in combat with one of the na
tion's foremost strongholds of
aquatic ability. Tomorrow at 1
p.m. the Cards will face off
against the California Bears at
Harmon pool on the Berkeley
campus.
Cal may actually pose a more
consuming and powerful
threat than either UCLA or
USC. According to Stanford
coach )im Gaughran, the Bears
were one of the pre-season's
best bets for a reasonable shot
at the NC AA championship ti
tle. Although they fell by a slim
margin to USC last Saturday,
Gaughran contended that their
depth gives them a walloping
punch for NCAA victory.
Vet, tomorrow's action will
take the form of a dual meet,
where triumph rests almost
solely upon a team's capability
to win individual events. II
Stanford can wrestle down
wins in several races, they
could mold the formerly elu
sive role of underdog-turned
spoiler into a tangible reality.
Since California's 400 med
ley relay will probably capture

the national championship in
that race, according to Gaug
hran, his goal is to narrow that
seven-notch spread through
the first three events.
Cal's national aspirations are
no mere illusions of grandeur
however. Graham Smith and
Peter Rocca, the best
breaststroker and backstroker
respectively in the country to
day, spearhead the Bears' drive
and loom as almost over
whelming obstacles to the
Cards' success.
Butterflyer Par Arviddson,
who has clocked a 1:49.4 200
yard fly this year, could impor
tantly challenge the Cards'
strong man, Mike Bruner, in
the event that he should de
cide to swim it.
While the men journey ac
ross the Bay, the Stanford
women will participate in the
Nor-Cal Championships this
afternoon and all day tomor
row at the Santa Clara Interna
tional Swim Center.
Gaughran confessed that
"We're not worried about it.
It's | ust two days that happen to
be in the middle of our taper."
He said that the women
should win by vast amounts in
this interim meet and are
shooting for next week's Stan
ford Invitationals.
