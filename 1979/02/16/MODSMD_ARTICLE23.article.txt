## Women split, still eye playoffs 
### Rich Martinez 
The Stanford women's basketball team is
growing very weary of stripes. The charity
stripe — or free throw line — and the zebra
striped officials proved to be bigger hindr
ances than the Cards' opponents.
Stanford pulled off an upset win over 15th
ranked Long Beach State Monday evening,
67-66, despite one-sided officiating respon
sible for sending the 49ers to the line for 26
free-throw attempts while Stanford had only
15 tries. The odds caught up with the Cards
Tuesday evening, though, as Cal-State Fuller
ton came out on top, 75-70.
Coming off a demoralizing defeat against
USF, Stanford received the good news that
USC defeated UCLA. This meant that Stan
ford, 4-4 in league, would still have an out
side chance ol receiving an "at-large" berth
for the NCAA Regionals it it played well in
Long Beach and Fullerton.
During the first half Stanford's defense was
easily penetrated, they were outrebounded
23-15, seven ot their shots were blocked, they
were continually beaten down the floor and
the 49ers owned a comfortable 45-30 lead.
Stanford erupted with 15 minutes left to
play. Led by )eanne Ruark's hot hand, the
women outscored Long Beach 15-7, closing
the gap to 59-53 with 7: $0 remaining.
Playing with exceptional maturity, Stanford
kept its cool and began to control the game.

Louise Smith hit a bucket with four minutes
to play and Stanford finally took the lead
Long Beach hit its last basket but Ruark
retaliated with a jumper and the Cards took
the lead for good, 67-66. Ruark led all scorers
with 42 points and Smith pulled down 11 re
bounds.
Stanford's confident play resumed at Ful
lerton but so did the officiating woes. The
Titans played extremely fine ball in the first
half and Stanford was againdownat halftime,
45-36.
Stanford outscored Fullerton 10-4 and the
score read 51-46 with 15:30 to go. The Cards
then kept within a bucket or two ot the Titans
until they finally pulled into the lead with two
Ruark tree throws, 64-63.
The most controversial play of the game
occurred with 5:50 remaining and Fullerton
ahead 67-66. Angie Paccione, Stanford's hot
test player, madea brilliant move underneath
while being triple-teamed. She sank the bas
ket as whistles blew and a three-point play
seemed certain. The official charged Pac
cione with charging, though. Fullerton then
scored and the Cards were down by three
instead of up by two.
Paccione scored 50 points and a member of
the Titans' men's varsity basketball team
complimented her by saying that her perfor
mance was the best he "had ever seen —
male or female."
