# Cards and Cal go to the hoop

Struggling in Pacific-10Conference basketball quicksand, Stan
ford and California meet tomorrow night at Maples Pavilion at 8
p.m. to try and push each other deeper into the sloughs of
despondency.
Misery has become a new teammate for each team during the
past tew weeks. The Cardinals, 10-12 overall and 4-9 in Pac-10
competition, have lost their last three games. Vet they are not to
be outdone by Cal.
The Golden Bears own a wan 5-17 record — 3-10 in conterence
— and they have dropped seven consecutive contests. In fact, the
Cards began Cal's long skein of defeats on Jan. 20 when they
trounced the Bears 73-50 at Berkeley's Harmon Gym.
That night, Stanford stymied the Bears on the backboards,
dazzled them with outside shooting and punished them with
inside muscle. However, cautious Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
warned not to expect too much more of the same Saturday.
"They didn't shoot well over there," Dißiaso said. "It they
improve their shooting, it will be a close game. They're a verv
dangerous team right now, and we expect them to play well
against us."
If Cal does perform effectively, you can be sure that Kevin
Singleton will be a major reason. Sporting a 16.0 per-game stor
ing average, the 6-foot-6 junior forward is one of the top scorers
in the conference.
Cal's tloor leader is senior guard John Caselli, averaging 7.9
points a game. Caselli usually runs the Bear offense from the
point guard spot and guards the opposition's high-scoring guard.
Doug True, scoring 10.0 points a game and leading the Bears in
rebounding with a 7.2 average, rounds out the starting lineup as
the center. The (>-7 junior is a player of the kimberly Belton mold:
strong of limb and fiery of spirit, he never gives less than his best.
No matter who is in the lineup for the Cards, one fact is
inescapable — somebody is going to win this game. "So what else
is new?" you might feel like saying, but tor the victory-starved
teams competing tomorrow night, the mere prospect of a win
looms larye.
