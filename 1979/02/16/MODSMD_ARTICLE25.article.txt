Four of Stanford's most luminous female tennis stars return to
The Farm accompanied by experience, impressive tournament
wins and a 1978 AIAW team cnampionship trophy.
Last year Stanford's women's tennis team captured the col
legiate nationals for the first time, due to what Coach Anne Could
has termed "a real team effort."
Coming off such an impressive season, the team rhight tend to
rest on its laurels, but looking at the level of competition for
Stanford this year, Gould is careful not to let that happen.
"We have our work cut out for us," said Gould. "(JSC is in a
class by itself; they're an excellent team and definitely the favo
rite this year. UCLA, Florida, and this year, BYU are also tough."
Gould cannot help but add Trinity to her list of rivals — a team
Stanford placed second to nationally for two years.
Although Gould is facing threatening competition, she is not
without her share of ammunition.
Playing for her second year for Stanford is Kathy Jordan, easily
the best returning collegiate player in the U.S.
Last year Jordan was the national Doubles Champion with
Barbara Jordan, as well as a singles finalist.
"Kathy's also done well on the pro circuit this winter," com
mented Gould.
Coming back to compete for their last year for Stanford are
seniors Diane Morrison and Susie Hagey. The Morrison-Hagey
duo has been the mainstay of the team for as long as it's been
here, winning the national collegiate doubles on two occasions.
They are both three-time Ail-Americans, and this year co-captains
of the team.
Sophomore Donna Rubin is a player Gould feels "will really
come through for us.
"She's really improved since last year, and during the summer
had a win over Sheila Mclnerny, one of USC's top players,"
Gould said.
Completing the top six roster are two fabulous freshmen: Sue
Rasmussen and Alycia Moulton. Moulton ended her years of
junior competition ranked fifth nationally, while Rasmussen
earned 18th place in the nation.
The tennis promises to be excellent again this year. As Gould
stated, "I have confidence in all the girls. This is a different year
and we're a different team. Anything can happen."
