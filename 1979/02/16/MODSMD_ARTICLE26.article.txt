# Men in LA, women at Fresno and Hayward
## Gymnasts hit the road 
### Dean Eyre 
While the majority of Stan
ford's students enjoy the
three-day vacation of Presi
dent's Day, the Cardinal gym
nastics teams will be hard at
work.
Sadao Hamada's men travel
to Southern California to meet
Cal State-Fullerton tonight at 8
p.m. and then take on UCLA
tomorrow night at 8 p.m. Jackie
Walker's women hit the road
today for a match up with
Fresno State at 4 p.m., then
turn around for the Hayward
Invitational tomorrow night at
7 p.m.
Monday night the women
gymnasts host the final home
meet of the year as Arizona
State visits Maples Pavilion for
a 7 p.m. contest.
Of the Fullerton team,
Hamada said, "They are the Di
vision II champions from last
year, so their team went to the
NCAA's and placed sixth or
seventh. They are scoring way
over 200 points. I have only one
score this year from Fullerton
and that was not with the full
team, but they should be at
about the same level as Ber
keley.
"They may have one or two
all-around guys who can score
about 50 or 51 points, but they
have really good specialists.
Ron Howard is one of the na
tion's leading vaulters — he's

been scoring 9.6 or 9.7," he
added.
The Card men, after two
meets last weekend, found lit
tle or no let-up before the even
busier approaching weekend.
"We were working mostly
on compulsories yesterday and
optionals today," Hamada
said. "There were some sore
shoulders and Mike Lee had
sore elbows, but they are not
really major things. After this
weekend, I have a kind of easy
schedule — I'll give them a lit
tle bit of rest time, then we'll
start training for the Western
Regionals and be doing a lot of
compulsories."
The trip down south will be
in part a learning experience
for the Cards, even though
they have already hosted and
beaten the Bruins earlier in the
season.
Like the men, the women
face a range of talent in the up
coming meets, being favored
over Fresno and being the un
derdogs against Arizona State,
who beat the Cards atTempe in
lanuary.
"Fresno State has been scor
ing 103 to 108 points, so we
should have the advantage in
this contest," Walker said.
"Because of the schedule of
the rough weekend, I'm going
to switch the lineup — Julie
Love's going to go all-around,
Karen Hall's only going to go on

beam and bars because those
don't wear you out as much
physically or mentally espe
cially with her leg injury.
"Annie Smith is going to go
all-around except she's going
to try a different vault that's not
as hard on her ankles and
maybe different tumbling in
her floor exercise. Both Karen
and Annie have to compete
Saturday night (only the top
two individuals compete at the
Hayward meet) so they're
going to be changing for that
reason," she added.
By resting Smith and Hall in
the less critical Fresno meet,
they will be in better shape for
the invitational and for the Sun
Devils.
"Even with the different line
up, I still expect the girls to
score at least 115. Cindy
Stevenson will add a back flip
in floor ex — the increased dif
ficulty will be a good impres
sion on the whole team score
(for the gymnasts following
Stevenson)," she noted.
The Hayward meet is a
change of pace from the usual
string of dual meets.
"There's no pressure and
usually a good crowd," Walker
said. "They (the gymnasts) get
some type of special gift just
for competing. It's a chance
to see the best two girls from a
wide variety of schools in the
West."
