Rebel Without A Cause -fairit
Friday, Kresge
Natalie Wood is a pretty bad
actress; Jim Backus is worse. Sal
Mineo gets by with being neuro
tic. But James Dean is great as a
middle-class boy who goes bad;
he's the real reason for watching
this movie. It'd be interesting to
compare the values expressed in
this film, where youth goes bad
because of ineffectual parents,
with those in The Warriors, a
more recent film where bad kids
don't seem to have any parents at
all. Nicholas Ray directed.
—Jim Mattson
Interiors ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels of
Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly, the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nesf ****
Sunday, Mem Aud
Ken Kesey may not like it, but
this movie is one of the most con
sistently challenging interpreta
tions of a complex novel ever
filmed. Director Milos Forman
goes all the way with the
McMurphy-Nurse Ratched battl
ing and, aided immeasurably by
incredible performances from
both Jack Nicholson and Louise
Fletcher, gets insights that Kesey,
in his novel, didn't come up with.
Fletcher's characterization of a
woman consumed by ice and
Nicholson's portrayal of a man
with a kooky (because he's too
sane?) fire burning within him
power this most basic and kinetic
of conflicts. P.S. For those of you
who wasted your time watching
this movie on TV last weekend,
give the real version a chance
too.
—R.L.
The Thin Man ★ ★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This stylish '30s detective story
was based on the book by
Dashiell Hammett. William Pow
ell and Myrna Loy play Nick and
Nora Charles, a couple who try
not to let Nick's duties as a detec
tive get in the way of their enter
taining. The plot has enough
twists and false leads to keep
everyone guessing; and the de
nouement, with all suspects
gathered together, is a classic.
W.S. Van Dyke directed, and
James Wong Howe is responsible
for the slick photography.
—J.M.

Casablanca ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. It sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung
by the man they've tried to im
itate ever since — Dooley Wil
son — and the services of a pair of
stars it would be hard for anyone
to forget: Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and
the great Claude Rains also add
their talents. For the benefit of
Comm 141 students, the director
was Michael Curtiz (The Adven
tures of Robin Hood, Mildred
Pierce) and the studio was
Warner Brothers.
—J.M.
luliet of the Spirits ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Giulietta Masina, a round
faced, very appealing actress,
was d'iected by her husband
Federico Fellini in this film about
a woman who finds herself
haunted by her strict Catholic
upbringing. She is taught how to
get rid of her inhibitions by an
earth-goddess type who happens
to live next door. This was Fel
lini's first color film; the colors
are so bright that even the actres
ses are painted in rainbow hues.
He gets a little overwrought with
his imagery — a person can take
only so many wild parties where
nothing really significant hap
pens. But there's always enough
movement and color to prevent
this movie from evet failing to
be interesting.
—J.M.

His Girl Friday ★ ★★★
Monday Cubberley
Howard Hawks directed this
curiously amoral comedy about
reporters who harbor an escaped
murderer so they can scoop the
world with the story. This movie
was based on The Front Page; the
twist in this version is that one of
the reporters is played by a wo
man. Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell make a great team; their
characters torture each other
verbally when they're not haras
sing innocent bystanders. His
Cirl Friday is famous for its use of
dialogue: there's enough
backtalk here to make two ordi
nary movies.
—|.M.
Play It Attain Sam ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Herbert Ross directed Woody
Allen and Diane Keaton in this
film version of Allen's stage play.
The director doesn't really keep
things moving fast enough to
match Allen's style, and this re
sults in a couple of dry patches.
But Allen and Keaton are, as al
ways, wonderful together; the
scenes with just the two of them,
where you can tell that they're
having a great time, redeem the
movie. Allen plays a man who,
before making any decision, tries
to figure out what his idol Hum
phrey Bogart would have done.
—J.M.
Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Francisco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed M'A'S'H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsicles; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altman's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, by the end of the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.
—).M.
The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
iful woman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.
— R.L

Harold and Mj ude ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Harold is a young man whose
hobby is attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old wo;rian who believes in free
love and inherent goodness of
humanity. And it's clear from the
beginning that the two are de
stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principles are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Cordon, and Cat
Stevens supplied the tunes.
—).M.
The Warriors ★
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a 70s ver
sion of West Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. I heir task is
to get back across the c ity with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.
—|.M.
Moment h\ Moment
Hyatt Cinema, Millbrae
The very talented Lily Tomlin
and the enormously popular
|ohn Travolta combine their ef
forts here; the result is an in
explicably bad movie. The direc
tor, lane Wagner, is a woman,
but instead of helping Tomlin
give her character unusual
depth, as one would have ex
pected, Wagner allows Tomlin to
give a performance which seems
to have been drawn from her
nightclub laugh. Unfortunately,
all the laughs have been left out,
so Tomlin's character merely
seems excruciatingly flat. As
May-December romances go,
this one should.

Movie-Movie ★ ★★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Stanley Donen, who directed
Singin' in the Rain, possibly the
greatest musical Hollywood ever
produced, directed this skillful
parody of a '50s double bill.
One is a boxing film, in a concise
black-and-white imitation called
Dynamite Hands The other is a
musical called Baxter's Beauties of
1933, filmed in superbly gaudy
thirtyish color. George C. Scott
is surprisingly adept with his
comedy roles in each of the two
tilms within a film. His imperso
nation of a Ziegfield-type Broad
way producer named Spats Bax
ter is very sleek.

Seaview Twin, Pacific
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema, is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—J.M.
Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★ ★★★
Clay Theater, San Francisco
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Gef Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally fipds solace in the arms of a
11-year-old boy with an I() of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to he controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol l.aure star.
—J.M.

California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets off
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the Jane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the
ordinary sound witless and
forced.
—R.L.
Violelle ★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.
—).M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

Herbert Ross directed Woody
Allen and Diane Keaton in this
film version of Allen's stage play.
The director doesn't really keep
things moving fast enough to
match Allen's style, and this re
sults in a couple of dry patches.
But Allen and Keaton are, as al
ways, wonderful together; the
scenes with just the two of them,
where you can tell that they're
having a great time, redeem the
movie. Allen plays a man who,
before making any decision, tries
to figure out what his idol Hum
phrey Bogart would have done.

Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Francisco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed M'A'S'H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsicles; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altman's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, by the end of the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.

The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
iful woman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.

Harold and Mj ude ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Harold is a young man whose
hobby is attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old wo;rian who believes in free
love and inherent goodness of
humanity. And it's clear from the
beginning that the two are de
stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principles are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Cordon, and Cat
Stevens supplied the tunes.
—).M.
The Warriors ★
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a 70s ver
sion of West Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. I heir task is
to get back across the c ity with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.

The very talented Lily Tomlin
and the enormously popular

forts here; the result is an in
explicably bad movie. The direc

but instead of helping Tomlin
give her character unusual
depth, as one would have ex
pected, Wagner allows Tomlin to
give a performance which seems
to have been drawn from her
nightclub laugh. Unfortunately,
all the laughs have been left out,

seems excruciatingly flat. As

Singin' in the Rain, possibly the

One is a boxing film, in a concise
black-and-white imitation called
Dynamite Hands The other is a

1933, filmed in superbly gaudy

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★ ★★★
Clay Theater, San Francisco
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Gef Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally fipds solace in the arms of a
11-year-old boy with an I() of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to he controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol l.aure star.

California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets off
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the Jane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the
ordinary sound witless and
forced.
—R.L.
Violelle ★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.
—).M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

Rebel Without A Cause -fairit
Friday, Kresge
Natalie Wood is a pretty bad

middle-class boy who goes bad;
he's the real reason for watching
this movie. It'd be interesting to
compare the values expressed in
this film, where youth goes bad
because of ineffectual parents,
with those in The Warriors, a
more recent film where bad kids
don't seem to have any parents at
all. Nicholas Ray directed.
—Jim Mattson
Interiors ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels of
Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly, the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nesf ****
Sunday, Mem Aud
Ken Kesey may not like it, but
this movie is one of the most con
sistently challenging interpreta
tions of a complex novel ever
filmed. Director Milos Forman
goes all the way with the
McMurphy-Nurse Ratched battl
ing and, aided immeasurably by
incredible performances from
both Jack Nicholson and Louise
Fletcher, gets insights that Kesey,
in his novel, didn't come up with.
Fletcher's characterization of a
woman consumed by ice and
Nicholson's portrayal of a man
with a kooky (because he's too
sane?) fire burning within him
power this most basic and kinetic
of conflicts. P.S. For those of you
who wasted your time watching
this movie on TV last weekend,
give the real version a chance

The Thin Man ★ ★★★

Nora Charles, a couple who try

taining. The plot has enough

The movie that's represented

stars it would be hard for anyone
to forget: Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and
the great Claude Rains also add

was Michael Curtiz (The Adven

haunted by her strict Catholic
upbringing. She is taught how to
get rid of her inhibitions by an
earth-goddess type who happens
to live next door. This was Fel
lini's first color film; the colors
are so bright that even the actres
ses are painted in rainbow hues.
He gets a little overwrought with

only so many wild parties where
nothing really significant hap

the reporters is played by a wo

story of Billy Hayes, an American

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★ ★★★
Clay Theater, San Francisco
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Gef Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally fipds solace in the arms of a
11-year-old boy with an I() of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to he controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol l.aure star.

California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets off
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the Jane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the
ordinary sound witless and
forced.
—R.L.
Violelle ★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.
—).M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

Friday, Kresge
Natalie Wood is a pretty bad

he's the real reason for watching
this movie. It'd be interesting to

Interiors ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels of
Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly, the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In

there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nesf ****
Sunday, Mem Aud
Ken Kesey may not like it, but
this movie is one of the most con
sistently challenging interpreta
tions of a complex novel ever
filmed. Director Milos Forman
goes all the way with the
McMurphy-Nurse Ratched battl
ing and, aided immeasurably by
incredible performances from
both Jack Nicholson and Louise
Fletcher, gets insights that Kesey,
in his novel, didn't come up with.
Fletcher's characterization of a
woman consumed by ice and
Nicholson's portrayal of a man
with a kooky (because he's too
sane?) fire burning within him
power this most basic and kinetic
of conflicts. P.S. For those of you
who wasted your time watching
this movie on TV last weekend,
give the real version a chance

The Thin Man ★ ★★★

Nora Charles, a couple who try
not to let Nick's duties as a detec

taining. The plot has enough
twists and false leads to keep
everyone guessing; and the de
nouement, with all suspects
gathered together, is a classic.
W.S. Van Dyke directed, and
James Wong Howe is responsible
for the slick photography.

Casablanca ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of

studio luster, a theme song sung
by the man they've tried to im

son — and the services of a pair of
stars it would be hard for anyone
to forget: Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and
the great Claude Rains also add
their talents. For the benefit of
Comm 141 students, the director
was Michael Curtiz (The Adven

Pierce) and the studio was
Warner Brothers.

luliet of the Spirits ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Giulietta Masina, a round
faced, very appealing actress,
was d'iected by her husband
Federico Fellini in this film about
a woman who finds herself
haunted by her strict Catholic
upbringing. She is taught how to
get rid of her inhibitions by an
earth-goddess type who happens
to live next door. This was Fel
lini's first color film; the colors
are so bright that even the actres
ses are painted in rainbow hues.
He gets a little overwrought with
his imagery — a person can take
only so many wild parties where
nothing really significant hap
pens. But there's always enough
movement and color to prevent
this movie from evet failing to
be interesting.
—J.M.

His Girl Friday ★ ★★★
Monday Cubberley
Howard Hawks directed this
curiously amoral comedy about
reporters who harbor an escaped
murderer so they can scoop the
world with the story. This movie
was based on The Front Page; the
twist in this version is that one of
the reporters is played by a wo
man. Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell make a great team; their
characters torture each other
verbally when they're not haras
sing innocent bystanders. His
Cirl Friday is famous for its use of
dialogue: there's enough
backtalk here to make two ordi
nary movies.
—|.M.
Play It Attain Sam ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Herbert Ross directed Woody
Allen and Diane Keaton in this
film version of Allen's stage play.
The director doesn't really keep
things moving fast enough to
match Allen's style, and this re
sults in a couple of dry patches.
But Allen and Keaton are, as al
ways, wonderful together; the
scenes with just the two of them,
where you can tell that they're
having a great time, redeem the
movie. Allen plays a man who,
before making any decision, tries
to figure out what his idol Hum
phrey Bogart would have done.
—J.M.
Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Francisco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed M'A'S'H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsicles; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altman's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, by the end of the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.

The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite

a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
iful woman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.

Harold and Mj ude ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Harold is a young man whose
hobby is attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old wo;rian who believes in free
love and inherent goodness of
humanity. And it's clear from the
beginning that the two are de
stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principles are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Cordon, and Cat
Stevens supplied the tunes.
—).M.
The Warriors ★
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a 70s ver
sion of West Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. I heir task is
to get back across the c ity with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.

The very talented Lily Tomlin

but instead of helping Tomlin
give her character unusual
depth, as one would have ex
pected, Wagner allows Tomlin to
give a performance which seems
to have been drawn from her
nightclub laugh. Unfortunately,
all the laughs have been left out,
so Tomlin's character merely
seems excruciatingly flat. As
May-December romances go,
this one should.

Fletcher, gets insights that Kesey,
in his novel, didn't come up with.
Fletcher's characterization of a
woman consumed by ice and
Nicholson's portrayal of a man
with a kooky (because he's too
sane?) fire burning within him
power this most basic and kinetic
of conflicts. P.S. For those of you
who wasted your time watching
this movie on TV last weekend,
give the real version a chance
too.

The Thin Man ★ ★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This stylish '30s detective story
was based on the book by
Dashiell Hammett. William Pow
ell and Myrna Loy play Nick and
Nora Charles, a couple who try
not to let Nick's duties as a detec
tive get in the way of their enter
taining. The plot has enough
twists and false leads to keep
everyone guessing; and the de
nouement, with all suspects
gathered together, is a classic.
W.S. Van Dyke directed, and
James Wong Howe is responsible
for the slick photography.
—J.M.

Casablanca ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. It sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung
by the man they've tried to im
itate ever since — Dooley Wil
son — and the services of a pair of
stars it would be hard for anyone
to forget: Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and
the great Claude Rains also add
their talents. For the benefit of
Comm 141 students, the director
was Michael Curtiz (The Adven
tures of Robin Hood, Mildred
Pierce) and the studio was
Warner Brothers.
—J.M.
luliet of the Spirits ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Giulietta Masina, a round
faced, very appealing actress,
was d'iected by her husband
Federico Fellini in this film about
a woman who finds herself
haunted by her strict Catholic
upbringing. She is taught how to
get rid of her inhibitions by an
earth-goddess type who happens
to live next door. This was Fel
lini's first color film; the colors
are so bright that even the actres
ses are painted in rainbow hues.
He gets a little overwrought with
his imagery — a person can take
only so many wild parties where
nothing really significant hap
pens. But there's always enough
movement and color to prevent
this movie from evet failing to
be interesting.
—J.M.

His Girl Friday ★ ★★★
Monday Cubberley
Howard Hawks directed this
curiously amoral comedy about
reporters who harbor an escaped
murderer so they can scoop the
world with the story. This movie
was based on The Front Page; the
twist in this version is that one of
the reporters is played by a wo
man. Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell make a great team; their
characters torture each other
verbally when they're not haras
sing innocent bystanders. His
Cirl Friday is famous for its use of
dialogue: there's enough
backtalk here to make two ordi
nary movies.
—|.M.
Play It Attain Sam ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Herbert Ross directed Woody
Allen and Diane Keaton in this
film version of Allen's stage play.
The director doesn't really keep
things moving fast enough to
match Allen's style, and this re
sults in a couple of dry patches.
But Allen and Keaton are, as al
ways, wonderful together; the
scenes with just the two of them,
where you can tell that they're
having a great time, redeem the
movie. Allen plays a man who,
before making any decision, tries
to figure out what his idol Hum
phrey Bogart would have done.
—J.M.
Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Francisco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed M'A'S'H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsicles; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altman's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, by the end of the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.
—).M.
The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
iful woman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.

Harold and Mj ude ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Harold is a young man whose
hobby is attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old wo;rian who believes in free
love and inherent goodness of
humanity. And it's clear from the
beginning that the two are de
stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principles are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Cordon, and Cat
Stevens supplied the tunes.
—).M.
The Warriors ★
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a 70s ver
sion of West Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. I heir task is
to get back across the c ity with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.
—|.M.
Moment h\ Moment
Hyatt Cinema, Millbrae
The very talented Lily Tomlin
and the enormously popular
|ohn Travolta combine their ef
forts here; the result is an in
explicably bad movie. The direc
tor, lane Wagner, is a woman,
but instead of helping Tomlin
give her character unusual
depth, as one would have ex
pected, Wagner allows Tomlin to
give a performance which seems
to have been drawn from her
nightclub laugh. Unfortunately,
all the laughs have been left out,
so Tomlin's character merely
seems excruciatingly flat. As
May-December romances go,
this one should.

Movie-Movie ★ ★★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Stanley Donen, who directed
Singin' in the Rain, possibly the
greatest musical Hollywood ever
produced, directed this skillful
parody of a '50s double bill.
One is a boxing film, in a concise
black-and-white imitation called
Dynamite Hands The other is a
musical called Baxter's Beauties of
1933, filmed in superbly gaudy
thirtyish color. George C. Scott
is surprisingly adept with his
comedy roles in each of the two
tilms within a film. His imperso
nation of a Ziegfield-type Broad

ter is very sleek.

Columbia Pictures proudly

This textbook case of rabid

story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★ ★★★
Clay Theater, San Francisco
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Gef Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally fipds solace in the arms of a
11-year-old boy with an I() of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to he controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol l.aure star.
—J.M.

California Suite ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Four weakly written skits, but
then again I guess it's better to
have too little Neil Simon than
too much. The movie ranges
from the fairly engaging (the
Michael Caine-Maggie Smith
episode, even though it gets off
to a poor beginning) to the abys
mal (the Jane Fonda-Alan Alda
skit). The Fonda-Alda vignette
brings out the worst qualities in
everyone involved — especially
director Herb Ross' tendency to
choose the obvious path and Neil
Simon's penchant for making the
ordinary sound witless and
forced.
—R.L.
Violelle ★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.
—).M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

Jack Nicholson roars through his role in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The movie, which
swept all five major academy awards the year it came out, plays Sunday Night in Mem Aud.


lames Dean stars as a nice boy gone wrong in Rebel Without A Cause. The 1956 melodrama plays

Rebel Without A Cause -fairit
Friday, Kresge
Natalie Wood is a pretty bad
actress; Jim Backus is worse. Sal
Mineo gets by with being neuro
tic. But James Dean is great as a
middle-class boy who goes bad;
he's the real reason for watching
this movie. It'd be interesting to
compare the values expressed in
this film, where youth goes bad
because of ineffectual parents,
with those in The Warriors, a
more recent film where bad kids
don't seem to have any parents at
all. Nicholas Ray directed.
—Jim Mattson
Interiors ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels of
Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly, the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—Ron Lillejord

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nesf ****
Sunday, Mem Aud
Ken Kesey may not like it, but
this movie is one of the most con
sistently challenging interpreta
tions of a complex novel ever
filmed. Director Milos Forman
goes all the way with the
McMurphy-Nurse Ratched battl
ing and, aided immeasurably by
incredible performances from
both Jack Nicholson and Louise
Fletcher, gets insights that Kesey,
in his novel, didn't come up with.
Fletcher's characterization of a
