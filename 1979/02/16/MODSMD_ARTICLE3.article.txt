# Harrington, Lipset debate on future of socialism movement
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
National Chairman of the Democ
ratic Socialist Organizing Committee
(DSOC) Michael Harrington and
Seymour Martin Lipset, professor of
political science and sociology here,
clashed on the need for socialism in
the United States at a debate here last
night.
Speaking to a crowd ot more than
500 in Kresge Auditorium, Har
rington asserted that the United
States "should have been the first
socialist country, given its capitalistic
development."
Lipset, a Senior Fellow at the
Hoover Institution, countered with
three explanations for the absence of
socialism in the United States. He
noted that social and political factors
and socialist strategies help explain
the lack of a socialist party in
America.
Lipset pointed to history as indica
tive of the failure of American
socialist strategies, saying, "They
(American socialists) never under
stood the two-party system. They
should have operated as a faction
within one of the major parties."
Harrington and DSOC have followed
this latter strategy and aligned them
selves with the Democratic party.
Harrington, a professor of political
science at Queen's College in New

York, did not contest Upset's expla
nation for the absence of socialism in
the United States, and instead con
centrated on the future of the
movement in America. "There is a
future for socialism in the United
States," asserted Harrington.
Harrington explained that
socialism is necessary in the United
States because "we are on the eve of,
if not in the midst of, a profound
crisis of liberalism."
Harrington attributed this crisis to
the present breakdown of Keynesian
economics. He explained that
America is currently suffering from a
new economic phenomena — stagf
lation. Stagflation, characterized by
simultaneous high unemployment
and rising prices, cannot be dealt
with adequately under present
Keynesian practices, according to
Harrington.
Harrington explained that Keyne
sian influences on the business cycle
only work when ihe economy is on
an upswing and are "overall, ineffec;
tual against corporate power so
gigantic that it dictates markets."
He emphasized the necessity for
radical change, stating, "The solu
tion to the crisis requires much more
than incremental change; it requires
more radical liberalism."
Harrington cited the present con

dition of U.S. health care as an area
where socialism is greatly needed.
"We should go to a system in which
care is based ori need," he said.
Lipset disagreed with Harrington's
contention that socialized medicine
would be entirely beneficial. He
conceded that the modern American
health care system is inequitable but
noted that socialized systems in
many countries, including Great Bri
tain and Sweden, are inflationary
and manipulated by the system's
doctors.
Harrington ended by saying he did
not expect to see socialism in the
near future.
"I fully expect capitalism to survive
(the present economic slump) but
only on a radically transformed
basis," he said.
Capitalistic collapse
Lipset rebutted Harrington's con
tention that the present economic
crisis is indicative of imminent
capitalistic collapse, noting that
numerous socialists have fallaciously
predicted the end of capitalism in the
last 150 years.
Lipset summarized his arguments
against Harrington's belief that
socialism is necessary in the United
States by stating, "None of the many
different approaches to politics or
economics produce Utopia."
