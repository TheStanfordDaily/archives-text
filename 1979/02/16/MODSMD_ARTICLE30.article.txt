U.S. gov't plans Iran airlift
Tehran, Iran — The United States readied
helicopters and big jets yesterday for a massive
airlift of thousands of Americans from Iran, where
anti-Americanism is running high and the anti
shah revolutionary alliance is splintering into hos
tile factions.
Bloody fighting raged for the thi rd straight day in
the northwest city of Tabriz, where hundreds were
reported killed.
As Ayatollah Khomeini struggled to restore
law and order in Iran, the monarch he forced out
of the country, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,
moved from one guest house in Morocco to
another, a possible sign he is ready for a long stay
abroad.
"We cannot protect American lives in Iran," said
the U.S. Embassy's announcement of the evacua
tion.
The announcement came one day after scores of
guerrillas stormed the embassy compound and
briefly held 102 Americans hostage.
There are believed to be 7000 Americans left in
Iran, down from a peak of about 45,000 one year
ago. U.S. officials hope to reduce the number to
about 2000 with the evacuation.
Those expected to remain include skeletal staffs
at the embassy and at some corporate headquar
ters, about 100 American journalists and many
Americans married to Iranians.
Leftists challenge Khomeini
Tehran, Iran — Well-organized leftists with ties
to radical Arab groups are challenging the author
ity of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini less than a
week after Khomeini's triumph over the shah.
The leftists, including skilled guerrilla fighters of
the "People's Fedayeen," had joined with Moslem
religious leader Khomeini in ending 2500 years of
royal rule in Iran. But now the leftists seek a grea
ter role in the country than the religious leader
apparently plans to give them.
Fedayeen fighters were among the armed civi
lians whose murderous fire from buildings and
rooftops Saturday near Faharabad air base forced
Imperial Guard troops to retreat and led to the
army's capitulation.
Within days of the fall of the shah-appointed
government of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar,
speakers were exhorting crowds at Tehran Univer
sity to oppose members of the Khomeini-backed
provisional government, to refuse Khomeini's call

to turn in arms and to defy the religious leader's
back-to-work order.
Diplomats believe the leftists are probably find
ing many converts among more radical members
of the middle class who are fearful of a loss of
power in a religiously-oriented Islamic state.
Taiwan accepts relations change
Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan will go along
with U.S. plans to handle relations between the
countries through private corporations, officials
announced yesterday. But they stressed their cor
porations will have close government ties.
James Soong, director of Taiwan's information
office, announced that Taiwan was creating the
Coordination Council for North American Affairs
to act as the "counterpart to the American Institute
in Taiwan."
Washington established the Institute to handle
American interests in Taiwan after it broke dip
lomatic relations with Nationalist China and estab
lished ties with Communist China on )an. 1.
Soong said the Taiwan council will have the
"qualities of officiality" and that all treaties and
agreements with the United States "will remain in
full force."
Washington, however, has said it will continue
all pacts except for the 1953 mutual defense treaty
which will be terminated next year.
Soong said the council will have branches in
Washington, New York, San Francisco, Chicago,
Los Angeles, Flonolulu, Seattle, Houston and At
lanta.
More gas price hikes expected
Gasoline prices, already expected to rise by up
to 12 cents a gallon within two years, may go up
faster if other oil-producing nations follow two
Persian Gulf countries in raising crude oil prices
seven percent.
The United Arab Emirates and Qatar took advan
tage of the shutdown of Iran's oil fields by raising
their prices yesterday. Analysts said that should
have no effect on gasoline and heating oil prices in
the United States because the two countries pro
duce only about four percent of the crude oil used
by the non-communist world.
But gasoline and heating oil could go up a penny
a gallon if other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), particu
larly Saudi Arabia, also raise their crude oil prices,
experts added.

OPEC decided in December to raise oil prices in
stages throughout 1979. The first result was a
gasoline price increase of about 1 cent a gallon this
month, bringing the average price in the United
States to about 7Qcents a gallon. An additional rise
of one cent is expected in May and a half-a-cent
each in August and November.
High court rules on pay freeze
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court
ruled unconstitutional yesterday provisions of a
post-Proposition 13 state law which had the effect
of freezing pay raises for local government
employees throughout the state.
The unanimous decision means that raises
granted to any of some 1.1 million local govern
ment employees in contracts for the 1978-79 fiscal
year are valid and can be paid.
The ruling also presumably means that local
governments can freely grant employees any kind
of wage hike, including merit raises.
The California Teachers Association estimated
that from $25 to $50 million would be paid in re
troactive raises to teachers in 133 school districts
with multi-year contracts and another 250 districts
with contract clauses providing for re-opening of
wage negotiations.
But the executive director of the California
School Boards Association, Herb Salinger, said the
ruling could mean more teacher layoffs in districts
that have not been able to set money aside to
finance retroactive raises.
Stocks fall slightly
New York — The stock market fell back slightly
in slow trading yesterday amid concerns over ris
ing oil prices. But analysts said the damage wasn't
as bad as it might have been.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrials, off by
more than three points much of the day, began to
recover in the last few minutes of trading and
closed at 829.09, down .69.
Big Board volume dropped to 22.55 million
shares from Wednesday's 27.22 million.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy through Friday. Fair tonight and to
morrow. A little warmer tomorrow. Lows in the
40s. Highs in the mid 50s to mid 60s.

Tehran, Iran — The United States readied
helicopters and big jets yesterday for a massive
airlift of thousands of Americans from Iran, where
anti-Americanism is running high and the anti
shah revolutionary alliance is splintering into hos
tile factions.
Bloody fighting raged for the thi rd straight day in
the northwest city of Tabriz, where hundreds were
reported killed.
As Ayatollah Khomeini struggled to restore
law and order in Iran, the monarch he forced out
of the country, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,
moved from one guest house in Morocco to
another, a possible sign he is ready for a long stay
abroad.
"We cannot protect American lives in Iran," said
the U.S. Embassy's announcement of the evacua
tion.
The announcement came one day after scores of
guerrillas stormed the embassy compound and
briefly held 102 Americans hostage.
There are believed to be 7000 Americans left in
Iran, down from a peak of about 45,000 one year
ago. U.S. officials hope to reduce the number to
about 2000 with the evacuation.
Those expected to remain include skeletal staffs
at the embassy and at some corporate headquar
ters, about 100 American journalists and many
Americans married to Iranians.
Leftists challenge Khomeini
Tehran, Iran — Well-organized leftists with ties
to radical Arab groups are challenging the author
ity of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini less than a
week after Khomeini's triumph over the shah.
The leftists, including skilled guerrilla fighters of
the "People's Fedayeen," had joined with Moslem
religious leader Khomeini in ending 2500 years of
royal rule in Iran. But now the leftists seek a grea
ter role in the country than the religious leader
apparently plans to give them.
Fedayeen fighters were among the armed civi
lians whose murderous fire from buildings and
rooftops Saturday near Faharabad air base forced
Imperial Guard troops to retreat and led to the
army's capitulation.
Within days of the fall of the shah-appointed
government of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar,
speakers were exhorting crowds at Tehran Univer
sity to oppose members of the Khomeini-backed
provisional government, to refuse Khomeini's call

to turn in arms and to defy the religious leader's
back-to-work order.
Diplomats believe the leftists are probably find
ing many converts among more radical members
of the middle class who are fearful of a loss of
power in a religiously-oriented Islamic state.
Taiwan accepts relations change
Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan will go along
with U.S. plans to handle relations between the
countries through private corporations, officials
announced yesterday. But they stressed their cor
porations will have close government ties.
James Soong, director of Taiwan's information
office, announced that Taiwan was creating the
Coordination Council for North American Affairs
to act as the "counterpart to the American Institute
in Taiwan."
Washington established the Institute to handle
American interests in Taiwan after it broke dip
lomatic relations with Nationalist China and estab
lished ties with Communist China on )an. 1.
Soong said the Taiwan council will have the
"qualities of officiality" and that all treaties and
agreements with the United States "will remain in
full force."
Washington, however, has said it will continue
all pacts except for the 1953 mutual defense treaty
which will be terminated next year.
Soong said the council will have branches in
Washington, New York, San Francisco, Chicago,
Los Angeles, Flonolulu, Seattle, Houston and At
lanta.
More gas price hikes expected
Gasoline prices, already expected to rise by up
to 12 cents a gallon within two years, may go up
faster if other oil-producing nations follow two
Persian Gulf countries in raising crude oil prices
seven percent.
The United Arab Emirates and Qatar took advan
tage of the shutdown of Iran's oil fields by raising
their prices yesterday. Analysts said that should
have no effect on gasoline and heating oil prices in
the United States because the two countries pro
duce only about four percent of the crude oil used
by the non-communist world.
But gasoline and heating oil could go up a penny
a gallon if other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), particu
larly Saudi Arabia, also raise their crude oil prices,
experts added.

OPEC decided in December to raise oil prices in
stages throughout 1979. The first result was a
gasoline price increase of about 1 cent a gallon this
month, bringing the average price in the United
States to about 7Qcents a gallon. An additional rise
of one cent is expected in May and a half-a-cent
each in August and November.
High court rules on pay freeze
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court
ruled unconstitutional yesterday provisions of a
post-Proposition 13 state law which had the effect
of freezing pay raises for local government
employees throughout the state.
The unanimous decision means that raises
granted to any of some 1.1 million local govern
ment employees in contracts for the 1978-79 fiscal
year are valid and can be paid.
The ruling also presumably means that local
governments can freely grant employees any kind
of wage hike, including merit raises.
The California Teachers Association estimated
that from $25 to $50 million would be paid in re
troactive raises to teachers in 133 school districts
with multi-year contracts and another 250 districts
with contract clauses providing for re-opening of
wage negotiations.
But the executive director of the California
School Boards Association, Herb Salinger, said the
ruling could mean more teacher layoffs in districts
that have not been able to set money aside to
finance retroactive raises.
Stocks fall slightly
New York — The stock market fell back slightly
in slow trading yesterday amid concerns over ris
ing oil prices. But analysts said the damage wasn't
as bad as it might have been.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrials, off by
more than three points much of the day, began to
recover in the last few minutes of trading and
closed at 829.09, down .69.
Big Board volume dropped to 22.55 million
shares from Wednesday's 27.22 million.
