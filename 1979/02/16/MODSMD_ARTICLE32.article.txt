# Foreign contracts debated
## 
### Tony Rupert 
The Faculty Senate yesterday re
fused to take action on a committee
recommendation that the University
not contract with foreign govern
ments or agencies that prohibit the
citizens of any other country from
entering.
At issue are contracts between the
University and foreign countries to
do research abroad. If a country pro
hibits the entry of citizens of any
other countries, then the University
would be forced to discriminate
when choosing student-researchers
to go to that country.
The United States itself restricts
the entry of citizens of some foreign
countries, according to the commit
tee report. Additionally, practically
all the countries in the world restrict
or forbid the entry of citizens of
some other country.
Several faculty members said that

when foreign students come here
they already know what countries
prohibit their entry. Thus, the Uni
versity should not be barred from
giving other students the opportun
ity to work in other countries.
Unable to decide what to do about
the proposal, the senate decided to
meet as a Committee of the Whole in
order to take some straw votes indi
cating the Senate's views of various
alternatives.
The results of the non-binding
straw vote was a recommendation to
the original committee to redraft the
proposal to eliminate the blanket
ban on contracts with countries that
discriminate on the basis of citizen
ship, but still indicate the Universi
ty's distaste for such policies. The
vote also asked that the University
keep some sort of review body to
look over these contracts before they
are signed.
