# Panelists predict little change in Taiwan ties

### Brad Crystal 
Despite recent normalization of re
lations with the People's Republic of
China (PRC), cultural and economic
ties between the United States and
Taiwan will stay essentially the same
as before, according to two featured
panelists at a symposium on U.S.-
Chinese relations Wednesday night.
Leonard Unger, former U.S. am
bassador to Taiwan, and Victor Li,
professor of international law at the
Law School here, said at a New Direc
tions symposium titled "U.S.-China
Relations: The Taiwan Question"
that they doubt the PRC will attempt
to absorb Taiwan by military force.
"People in Taiwan who assess the
situation coolly reject the idea that

the PRC is an active military threat,"
said Unger, who served as ambas
sador for 4Vi years, immediately
prior to America's severing of dip
lomatic relations with Taiwan )an. 1.
"We've been assured by (Vice
Premier) Teng H'siao Ping that the
PRC has no intention of military ac
tion," said Li, author of Derecogniz
ing Taiwan: The Legal Problem.
Both speakers also rejected the no
tion that Taiwan will turn to the
Soviet Union to establish close milit
ary and economic ties. The sacrifices
of such a move "considerably exceed
the benefits," said Unger.
Effective communication
Unger, who has also served as am
bassador to Thailand and Laos, said

that effective means of communica
tion between U.S. and Taiwanese au
thorities will continue to be possible
through intermediaries. The only dif
ferences in the U.S.-Taiwanese rela
tionship are the break in formal dip
lomatic links and the abrogation of
the mutual security treaty, he said.
Unger asserted that Taiwan knew
long beforehand that normalization
of relations with Peking was inevita
ble. "The U.S. position (to eventu
ally recognize the PRC) had been
made quite clear since the 1972
Shanghai Communique," he said.
Li agreed saying "they clearly knew
it was coming."
Despite "initial shock and resent
ment" among the Taiwanese people,

Unger says he believes "political and
business leaders want continued
cooperation with the United States."
First shocks
LJnger said it was regrettable that
the Dec. 15 announcement of nor
malization may have resulted in the
suspension of elections scheduled
for the following week.
Unger said that while he expects
an initial period of "observation and
caution" in Taiwan he also foresees
the development of a more open sys
tem with slow improvement in the
area of human rights. He said there
will be a diminishing belief in the "re
turn to the mainland" philosophy.
'Reasonable' defense
Security for Taiwan is "one of the
most tricky and difficult issues," ac
cording to Unger. He said the United
States will continue to consider sel
ling Taiwan military equipment it re
quires for a "reasonable" defense.
Concerning PRC-Taiwan relations,
Unger said that indirect trade "may
take place over time" but that
negotiations for reunification "are
very far down the road."
Opposition elements
Nevertheless, Li noted that oppos
ition elements drew some 38 percent
of the vote in local 1977 elections.
Li said that while the prospect fpr
change in PRC policy is a possibility
given the country's recent his
tory of turmoil, "I believe the mod
erate policy will continue." He
added facetiously, "I like (the policy
of moderation), therefore it must be
natural."
However, the PRC view is that
Taiwan is "as much a part of China as
New lersey is a part of the United
States," he said.
Same substance, different form
Regarding the omnibus legislation
now before the Congress which will
determine the future of U.S.-
Taiwanese relations, Li said it is "re
ally sloppy and obviously done in an
awful hurry," but it will enable the
substance of relations to be the same
even though the form will be diffe
rent.

of the vote in local 1977 elections.
Li said that while the prospect fpr
change in PRC policy is a possibility
given the country's recent his
tory of turmoil, "I believe the mod
erate policy will continue." He
added facetiously, "I like (the policy
of moderation), therefore it must be
natural."
However, the PRC view is that
Taiwan is "as much a part of China as
New lersey is a part of the United
States," he said.
Same substance, different form
Regarding the omnibus legislation
now before the Congress which will
determine the future of U.S.-
Taiwanese relations, Li said it is "re
ally sloppy and obviously done in an
awful hurry," but it will enable the
substance of relations to be the same
even though the form will be diffe
rent.

Despite recent normalization of re
lations with the People's Republic of
China (PRC), cultural and economic
ties between the United States and
Taiwan will stay essentially the same
as before, according to two featured
panelists at a symposium on U.S.-
Chinese relations Wednesday night.
Leonard Unger, former U.S. am
bassador to Taiwan, and Victor Li,
professor of international law at the
Law School here, said at a New Direc
tions symposium titled "U.S.-China
Relations: The Taiwan Question"
that they doubt the PRC will attempt
to absorb Taiwan by military force.
"People in Taiwan who assess the
situation coolly reject the idea that

the PRC is an active military threat,"
said Unger, who served as ambas
sador for 4Vi years, immediately
prior to America's severing of dip
lomatic relations with Taiwan )an. 1.
"We've been assured by (Vice
Premier) Teng H'siao Ping that the
PRC has no intention of military ac
tion," said Li, author of Derecogniz
ing Taiwan: The Legal Problem.
Both speakers also rejected the no
tion that Taiwan will turn to the
Soviet Union to establish close milit
ary and economic ties. The sacrifices
of such a move "considerably exceed
the benefits," said Unger.
Effective communication
Unger, who has also served as am
bassador to Thailand and Laos, said

that effective means of communica
tion between U.S. and Taiwanese au
thorities will continue to be possible
through intermediaries. The only dif
ferences in the U.S.-Taiwanese rela
tionship are the break in formal dip
lomatic links and the abrogation of
the mutual security treaty, he said.
Unger asserted that Taiwan knew
long beforehand that normalization
of relations with Peking was inevita
ble. "The U.S. position (to eventu
ally recognize the PRC) had been
made quite clear since the 1972
Shanghai Communique," he said.
Li agreed saying "they clearly knew
it was coming."
Despite "initial shock and resent
ment" among the Taiwanese people,

Unger says he believes "political and
business leaders want continued
cooperation with the United States."
First shocks
LJnger said it was regrettable that
the Dec. 15 announcement of nor
malization may have resulted in the
suspension of elections scheduled
for the following week.
Unger said that while he expects
an initial period of "observation and
caution" in Taiwan he also foresees
the development of a more open sys
tem with slow improvement in the
area of human rights. He said there
will be a diminishing belief in the "re
turn to the mainland" philosophy.
'Reasonable' defense
Security for Taiwan is "one of the
most tricky and difficult issues," ac
cording to Unger. He said the United
States will continue to consider sel
ling Taiwan military equipment it re
quires for a "reasonable" defense.
Concerning PRC-Taiwan relations,
Unger said that indirect trade "may
take place over time" but that
negotiations for reunification "are
very far down the road."
Opposition elements
Nevertheless, Li noted that oppos
ition elements drew some 38 percent
of the vote in local 1977 elections.
Li said that while the prospect fpr
change in PRC policy is a possibility
given the country's recent his
tory of turmoil, "I believe the mod
erate policy will continue." He
added facetiously, "I like (the policy
of moderation), therefore it must be
natural."
However, the PRC view is that
Taiwan is "as much a part of China as
New lersey is a part of the United
States," he said.
Same substance, different form
Regarding the omnibus legislation
now before the Congress which will
determine the future of U.S.-

ally sloppy and obviously done in an
awful hurry," but it will enable the
substance of relations to be the same
even though the form will be diffe
rent.
