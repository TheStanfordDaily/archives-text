# Fire strikes Deke house

A stovetop grease fire caused ap
proximately $5000 damage to the in
terior walls of the Delta Kappa Epsi
lon house yesterday morning, ac
cording to Alan Rush, Palo Alto Fire
Department fireman.
The fire, caused by a pot of boil
ing butter left unattended on a
kitchen stove, ignited "grit inside
the ventilation system above the
stove," Rush said. The fire then
spread through the flue, setting
wooden walls adjacent to the shaft
on fire. There was no damage to the
contents of the house, only to wall
interiors, Rush said.
The stove fire was extinguished
by a house resident shortly after the
blaze started, but 13 firemen
worked to cut into the ventilation
system and adjacent walls to extin
guish flames which had spread
through the shaft, Rush said.
Though the fire was "small," Rush
said, the fire crew worked for over
Vh hours to make sure the blaze
was extinguished.
Rush said that he had inspected
the house within the past two
months. When inspecting a house,
Rush is "certain to recommend that
the flues be periodically cleaned,"
he said. "It's so easy for grit to ac
cumulate up in there."

But, according to junior Keith
Waggoner, president of the house,
recent recommendations by fire
squad inspectors did not note the
shaft or flue as fire hazards.
Rush also said that previous fire
inspectors had recommended that
house residents install a safer shaft
system that would automatically
shut off the fan inside the flue if a
fire started, making it more difficult
for flames to spread.
"What the University will proba
bly do now is just that," said Wag
goner. "The system used to meet
the University's safety codes, but it
probably wouldn't now. So they're
probably going to put in some type
of automatic alarm system and a
sprinkler system that will turn itself
on in case of fire."
While a new shaft is installed and
walls repaired, the house's kitchen
will remain out of use. According to
Diana Conklin, assistant director of
residential education, house resi
dents will eat at Florence Moore.
"We've worked out a special
deal, a cheap price. Students will be
paying for it for now, at least, but
we're negotiating to find out what
we can do for them to help them
defray the costs."
Waggoner estimates the repair
time will take from two weeks to a
month.

A fire yesterday in the Deke house kitchen worked its way up a shaft next to the stove, forcing firemen to cut
holes in the roof (above) to extinguish the flames.
