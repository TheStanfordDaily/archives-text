# The 						satisfying but time-consuming RA job
## 
### Carl Chamberlin 
"ft's a great opportunity for
personal development; it of
fers a wide variety of tasks and
situations, with chances for
learning in all of them."
Duncan Evered, house as
sociate (RA) in Branner Hall, is
one of about 150 men and
women of diverse
backgrounds and personalities
who each year serve in the ful
filling yet time-consuming
capacity of RA.
A series of recent interviews
with University RAs revealed
the many inspirations for tak
ing on the job. Evered, for
example, said that observing
RAs and recognizing the job as
"one of the few opportunities
for a person at Stanford to con
tribute to other people," moti
vated him to apply and remain
in the position.
Graduate students, such as
Bob Jones at Grove-Mayfield
and Jeff Ellingson in Toyon
Hall, said they wanted a
broader perspective of the
Stanford community than was
provided by the law or busi
ness schools. Ellingson, a
third-year law student,

explained that there is a "self
contained life at the law
school, which is not designed
to be a social institution."
Therefore, he continued, an RA
position in an undergraduate
house "makes life more nor
mal and provides a more mean
ingful perspective of the total
institution."
The RAs agreed that house
residents influence the RAs'
true role. Stephanie Barry, a
second-year RA in Stern's
Twain House, said the RA's role
varies depending upon the
needs of the people in the
house; last year she served
more in an advisory role while
this year she is taking on more
programming responsibilities.
Mike McMartin, RA in Flor
ence Moore's Gavilan, agreed
that his role is changing some
what as the year progresses.
According to him, the RA may
serve initially as a "model
image and outlet for academic
or personal advice," yet as the
year continues, the RA may be
come "just another friend."
The type of house also influ
ences an RA's role, lohn Harris,
a Manzanita RA, said his role is

different from that of RAs in
other living areas. Due to the
residential structure of Man
zanita, he said his role is to
"create a good cohesive com
munity feeling," which com
pensates for the communica
tion problems inherent in a liv
ing group with so many people
spread over such a large area.
Tom Rainey, RA at Zeta Psi,
contended that because of set
leadership roles among the
fraternity residents, his job in
volves less counseling and
guidance and more liaison
work between the frat and the
University. Ongoing traditions
in the frat also permit him to
serve as a source of new ideas
and different perspectives on
the house and its activities.
In addition, RA duties in a
freshman house differ from
those of a four-class dorm RA.
Terry Euyang, a third-year RA
who worked in Wilbur's all
freshman Arroyo last year, is
now an RA in Roble.
"In a four-class dorm every
body more or less knows
everybody else and they know
what they want to do," she
said. Consequently, her duties

in Roble are more administra
tive, serving as a "liaison bet
ween faculty and students."
She agreed with Evered that
in freshman houses RAs deal
more with students' academic
and emotional adjustments to
Stanford.
No single definition
adequately depicts the "typical
RA," nor can one set of criteria
be used to determine who is,
or who could be, a good RA.
According to David Gale, RA in
Wilbur's Cedro, there are "shy
people who, because of their
personality, people feel they
can trust," as well as RAs with
very outgoing personalities,
who add considerably to a
dorm.
This diversity, in turn, affects
the RAs' role and style. Lena
Vesil, an RA in Toyon, for
example, said she feels that her
Turkish background provides
an opportunity for residents to
learn about a different culture
and offers others a perspective
without some of the "precon
ceived assumptions" common
to students with only an Ameri
can up bringing.
All the RAs interviewed men

tioned the great time commit
ment involved in being an RA.
Barry asserts that being an RA is
a "24-hour-a-day, seven-day
a-week job, and there aren't
ways to get around it and still
be a good RA. You don't have
to be doing things, but you still
have to be there."
Another RA described an
ongoing frustration of the RA
job as being "the third floor of
Old Union."
"I'm not implying that they
(administrators in the Office of
Residential Education) don't
understand the job intellectu
ally, but somehow they're on a
different wavelength. They're
dealing with a bureaucracy,
while 150 RAs are dealing with
people," the RA said.
RAs offer words of caution to
students considering applying
for a RA position this spring.
"It's important that people
realize the commitment in
volved and the change in lifes
tyle," Evered explained. "You
must also be aware of the in
fluence you have on freshmen,
and, in turn, realize your own
limitations.
But significant rewards also
emanate from serving as an RA.
Most of those interviewed
mentioned an RA's opportun
ity to work with interesting
people and to acquire good
friendships. McMartin com
mented that he has "grown up
a lot" as a result of the job, and
Evered concluded that the ex
perience "brings out the best
in you."
"I don't have one single re
gret," Gale concluded.

leadership roles among the
fraternity residents, his job in
volves less counseling and
guidance and more liaison
work between the frat and the
University. Ongoing traditions
in the frat also permit him to
serve as a source of new ideas
and different perspectives on
the house and its activities.
In addition, RA duties in a
freshman house differ from
those of a four-class dorm RA.
Terry Euyang, a third-year RA
who worked in Wilbur's all
freshman Arroyo last year, is
now an RA in Roble.
"In a four-class dorm every
body more or less knows
everybody else and they know
what they want to do," she
said. Consequently, her duties

in Roble are more administra
tive, serving as a "liaison bet
ween faculty and students."
She agreed with Evered that
in freshman houses RAs deal
more with students' academic
and emotional adjustments to
Stanford.
No single definition
adequately depicts the "typical
RA," nor can one set of criteria
be used to determine who is,
or who could be, a good RA.
According to David Gale, RA in
Wilbur's Cedro, there are "shy
people who, because of their
personality, people feel they
can trust," as well as RAs with
very outgoing personalities,
who add considerably to a
dorm.
This diversity, in turn, affects
the RAs' role and style. Lena
Vesil, an RA in Toyon, for
example, said she feels that her
Turkish background provides
an opportunity for residents to
learn about a different culture
and offers others a perspective
without some of the "precon
ceived assumptions" common
to students with only an Ameri
can up bringing.
All the RAs interviewed men

tioned the great time commit
ment involved in being an RA.
Barry asserts that being an RA is
a "24-hour-a-day, seven-day
a-week job, and there aren't
ways to get around it and still
be a good RA. You don't have
to be doing things, but you still
have to be there."
Another RA described an
ongoing frustration of the RA
job as being "the third floor of
Old Union."
"I'm not implying that they
(administrators in the Office of
Residential Education) don't
understand the job intellectu
ally, but somehow they're on a
different wavelength. They're
dealing with a bureaucracy,
while 150 RAs are dealing with
people," the RA said.
RAs offer words of caution to
students considering applying
for a RA position this spring.
"It's important that people
realize the commitment in
volved and the change in lifes
tyle," Evered explained. "You
must also be aware of the in
fluence you have on freshmen,
and, in turn, realize your own
limitations.
But significant rewards also
emanate from serving as an RA.
Most of those interviewed
mentioned an RA's opportun
ity to work with interesting
people and to acquire good
friendships. McMartin com
mented that he has "grown up
a lot" as a result of the job, and
Evered concluded that the ex
perience "brings out the best
in you."
"I don't have one single re
gret," Gale concluded.
"ft's a great opportunity for
personal development; it of
fers a wide variety of tasks and
situations, with chances for
learning in all of them."
Duncan Evered, house as
sociate (RA) in Branner Hall, is
one of about 150 men and
women of diverse
backgrounds and personalities
who each year serve in the ful
filling yet time-consuming
capacity of RA.
A series of recent interviews
with University RAs revealed
the many inspirations for tak
ing on the job. Evered, for
example, said that observing
RAs and recognizing the job as
"one of the few opportunities
for a person at Stanford to con
tribute to other people," moti
vated him to apply and remain
in the position.
Graduate students, such as
Bob Jones at Grove-Mayfield
and Jeff Ellingson in Toyon
Hall, said they wanted a
broader perspective of the
Stanford community than was
provided by the law or busi
ness schools. Ellingson, a
third-year law student,

explained that there is a "self
contained life at the law
school, which is not designed
to be a social institution."
Therefore, he continued, an RA
position in an undergraduate
house "makes life more nor
mal and provides a more mean
ingful perspective of the total
institution."
The RAs agreed that house
residents influence the RAs'
true role. Stephanie Barry, a
second-year RA in Stern's
Twain House, said the RA's role
varies depending upon the
needs of the people in the
house; last year she served
more in an advisory role while
this year she is taking on more
programming responsibilities.
Mike McMartin, RA in Flor
ence Moore's Gavilan, agreed
that his role is changing some
what as the year progresses.
According to him, the RA may
serve initially as a "model
image and outlet for academic
or personal advice," yet as the
year continues, the RA may be
come "just another friend."
The type of house also influ
ences an RA's role, lohn Harris,
a Manzanita RA, said his role is

different from that of RAs in
other living areas. Due to the
residential structure of Man
zanita, he said his role is to
"create a good cohesive com
munity feeling," which com
pensates for the communica
tion problems inherent in a liv
ing group with so many people
spread over such a large area.
