# Med School splits two top positions
## 
### Seth Zuckerman 
The positions of vice
president for medical affairs
and dean of the Medical
School will be held by two
people from now on, ac
cording to the formal in
structions issued by the
committee searching for a
replacement for Clayton
Rich, who resigned last
November. Rich, like his
predecessor, held both jobs
simultaneously.
In his charge to the com
mittee, President Richard
Lyman recommended the
move to promote "a greater
degree of separation bet
ween the Hospital and the
Medical School. There are
compelling reasons to be
lieve that both entities will
fare better if each has a
strong, independent lead
ership."
Robert Rosenzweig,
vice-president for public af
fairs, said part of the
philosophy governing this
action is to give the Hospital
what it requires to care ef
fectively for patients.
"It has sometimes been
difficult for the Hospital to
make its needs known as ef
fectively as it should have,"
he said. "The needs of
teaching and the needs of
patient care aren't always
identical. Somehow, they
have to be blended."

Acting Dean of the Medi
cal School Lawrence Crow
ley agreed the two positions
deserved to be separated
because a distinct Hospital
leadership would be able to
safeguard the Hospital's in
terests.
Rosenzweig stressed,
however, that this decision
should not be seen as a
reaction to alleged misman
agement by any previous
deans of the Medical
School. He said that the
complexity of the Hospital
and the Medical School now
makes it advisable to spread
the responsibility out
somewhat.
The search committee
will only be responsible for
finding a vice-president,
and will not concern itself
with filling the position of
Medical School dean, ac
cording to Bob Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president for
trustee affairs. The commit
tee was named last week
and is headed by Thomas
Merigan, chairman of the
Department of Infectious
Diseases.
A new search committee
for the deanship will not be
formed until the vice
president's position is filled
because his input will be
wanted in the search for a
new dean, according to
Rosenzweig.
