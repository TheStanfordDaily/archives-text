Dear Bug Me:
What are thep's andq's in "Mind your p's and
q's?
-/. & M.
From the Oxford English Dictionary, "minding
your p's and q's" means taking care with one's
words or behavior. The dictionary suggests the
expression may stem from children's difficulties
in distinguishing between the tailed letters "p"
and "q." J.S. Farmers' Slang and its Analogues
also notes the old custom of alehouse tallies,
with "p" standing for "pint" and "q" standing
for "quart," and the necessity to avoid over- and
under-charging.

Dear Bug Me:
Plant services is using an herbicide around

Campus Drive that leaves the ground looking
like they're pursuing a burnt earth policy. Is this
permanent for the median stripsf
-Z.Z
After talking with Herb Fong, grounds super
visor, it appears the policy is indeed permanent.
Fong said the use of "Diquat" doesn't perma
nently poison the ground and reduces the labor
costs of mowing. He also said that canrs, rocks
and other debris thrown onto the street during
mowing can be a safety hazard to pedestrians.
The green fields lining Palm Drive are not
mowed because of low-hanging tree branches.
