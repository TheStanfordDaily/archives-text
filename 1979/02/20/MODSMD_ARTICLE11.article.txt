# Libertarian candidates oppose abortion laws

San lose (AP) — The two can
didates for the Libertarian Par
ty's nomination for president
both said Sunday they oppose
laws against abortion, but both
also oppose using any gov
ernment funds to pay for abor
tions.
Candidates Ed Clark and Bill
Hunscher also agreed that
abortion is one of the most dif
ficult issues for Libertarians to
deal with because it puts the
rights of a woman and her un
born child in direct conflict.
That conflict troubles many
Democrats and Republicans
too, but it is especially difficult
for the fledgling Libertarian
Party because a fundamental
principle of that party is repeal
ing laws and regulations that
interfere with individual rights.
Questioned about abortion
at the Libertarian Party state
convention, Clark, of Los

Angeles, and Hunscher, of Mil
ford, N.H., took similar stands.
'Absolutely wrong'
"Any attempt to intention
ally terminate the life of a fetus
that can be preserved is wrong
— absolutely wrong and
should be a crime," Clark said.
"But I really do not have a
position as to whether a wo
man's right to control her body
or whether the rights of the
fetus are overriding. This is an
ethical problem for which I
have no solution. And since I
have no ethical solution, as a
Libertarian I wouldn't make it a
crime," Clark said.
Hunscher said abortion is
"the most difficult question
we're asked. Each interest
group wants to have its view
enacted into law. As a Liberta
rian, I have to object to any
group codifying and imposing
its standards on others who

have different views.
"I think we have to have
more research as to when is the
moment of life. Maybe then we
can draw a line between these
conflicting rights," he added.
The Libertarians — a coali
tion of the far left and far right
— held their state convention
in San Jose over the weekend.
Building party registrations
to win a place on the ballot in
1980 was a major goal of the
convention, but party leaders
said a lawsuit now pending has
more promise of winning that
spot than signing up the re
quired 71,322 persons needed
to qualify in California through
voter registration.
Goals
The seven-year-old party
now has 7980 Californians regis
tered as members. On policy
issues, the convention focused
on Libertarian goals of reduc

ing government activities and
costs — particularly those
which intrude in the private
lives of citizens.
For those recruited from the
political left, the focus was on a
"non-interventionist" foreign
policy and repealing laws
against so-called victimless
crimes such as drug use,
gambling, pornography and
prostitution.
For those attracted from the
right, there were proposals to
cut taxes and government
spending, especially for social
welfare, and reduce business
regulation to the policing of
criminal conduct.
Tom Haslett, of Los Angeles,
attacked California's Coastal
Conservation Commission in a
convention speech as "a blank
check for bureaucracy."
"Through the commission's
strict limits on coastal-region

development, the day of due
process has ground to a halt
. . . and an elaborate network
of ecologists, attorneys, big
business and bureaucrats" has
taken over, he said.
Another speaker, Robert
Poole of Santa Barbara,
criticized Gov. lerry Brown's
proposed $5 million space
satellite, killed by the Legisla
ture and Proposition 13 spend
ing cuts.
Poole said the satellite, in
tended to substitute for more
costly ground communications
equipment, probably could be
justified as a cheaper means of
communications.
But, he said, that ignores the
question of whether the state
should have a system in the
first place or whether it should
leave development of com
munications systems to private
competition.
