# Film Rating Board doesn't censor
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Film ratings exist "not to im
pose censorship, but to ensure
against censorship," according
to Richard Hefner, chairman of
the motion picture industry's
Film Rating Board (FRB).
Hefner made his remarks at a
guest lecture to 250 students
enrolled in Communication
141, History of Film, last week.
The board does not censor
anything, Hefner said. Rather,
"we give an early warning sys
tem" to parents with the G, PG,
Rand X ratings.
He said the idea was to pro
tect children by giving parents
a guide to the movie's content.
The standards employed by the
board are flexible. A movie re
ceiving a G rating means that
"by today's parental standards,
it is the board's 'educated
guess' that nothing in that film
will make the parents regret
that they allowed theirchildren
to see the film," Hefner said.
Children are the board's

concern, he said, adding that
adults should be allowed to see
anything they wish.
Hefner said the 10-year-old
board was formed by coopera
tion within a highly competi
tive industry. He said filmmak
ers were responding to efforts
by "moralizing elements of the
society" to actually censor
films.
Efforts to censor films date
back to the 1930s when the old
Production Code of America
(PCA) guidelines were in force.
According to Hefner, they re
stricted virtually everything.
Local boards
The PCA was overcome, he
said, but an absence of any
guidelines to parents lead to
local and state censor boards.
The industry responded with
the FRB.
Now, Hefner said, the
seven-member board screens
some 500 films annually.
Film exhibitor adherence to
the rating guidelines is volun

tary, Hefner said, but it is al
most universal. He said that for
any film to get a large nation
wide booking in theaters, it
must have a rating by the
board. However, the decision
to ask for a rating is also strictly
voluntary.
Changing views
Hefner said the board re
flects "changing parental
views" in its ratings. Formerly,
board members would, in
somecases, base ratings on the
number of nipples seen in the
movie. Now, he said, much
more sexuality is seen on the
screen with PC ratings than
four years ago, when he took
over as chairman. In addition,
violence is dealt with much
more firmly by the board.
Hefner said his board has
given a number of X ratings for
violence.
I he only "rule" the board
works under concerns foul
language. The rule, imposed
by the industry, requires an R
rating for the sexually oriented
slang words such as "fuck,"
and its "derivatives."
Appeals panel
But even this rule is breaking
down, he said. Starting with/4//
the President's Men, filmmak
ers started to challenge R rat
ings forthe use of language. All
ratings can be appealed to a
special appeals panel. Since it
was successfully argued that
All the President's Men should
be given a PC rating despite
"seven uses of the word 'fuck'
or its derivatives," Hefner said
many films have received simi
lar rating appeal decisions.
The impact of a given rating
over another is purely finan
cial, Hefner said. A certain rat
ing will attract a certain audi
ence, he said, and in some
cases it a filmmaker does not
get the rating he wants, it will
have a big effect at the box of
fice.
But he said no rating deci
sions are the result of industry
pressure. He added that small
filmicompanies are not dis-

Independent of industry
All members of the board are
independent of the industry,
Hefner said. A profes
sor of communications at
Rutgers University, Hefner said
he has restructured the board
to give it continuity from long
term positions plus new blood
annually by replacing certain
members every year.
He said the board costs are
deferred through assessment
of fees for reviewing a film. The
fees are set forth in a uniformly
applied formula set up by the
industry when the board was
created.
Hefner was emphatic in his
distaste for censorship. With
film ratings, he said, "dollars
are affected, but speech is not.
"When we get to the point
that people equate dollars and
speech and people call it cen
sorship, I think we're hearing a
lot of bologna. ,
"Put the power to censor in
anyone's hands today, and you
will find you do not agree with
them tomorrow." That is
where the real danger to soci
ety begins, he said.

works under concerns foul
language. The rule, imposed
by the industry, requires an R
rating for the sexually oriented
slang words such as "fuck,"
and its "derivatives."
Appeals panel
But even this rule is breaking
down, he said. Starting with/4//
the President's Men, filmmak
ers started to challenge R rat
ings forthe use of language. All
ratings can be appealed to a
special appeals panel. Since it
was successfully argued that
All the President's Men should
be given a PC rating despite
"seven uses of the word 'fuck'
or its derivatives," Hefner said
many films have received simi
lar rating appeal decisions.
The impact of a given rating
over another is purely finan
cial, Hefner said. A certain rat
ing will attract a certain audi
ence, he said, and in some
cases it a filmmaker does not
get the rating he wants, it will
have a big effect at the box of
fice.
But he said no rating deci
sions are the result of industry
pressure. He added that small
filmicompanies are not dis-

Independent of industry
All members of the board are
independent of the industry,
Hefner said. A profes
sor of communications at
Rutgers University, Hefner said
he has restructured the board
to give it continuity from long
term positions plus new blood
annually by replacing certain
members every year.
He said the board costs are
deferred through assessment
of fees for reviewing a film. The
fees are set forth in a uniformly
applied formula set up by the
industry when the board was
created.
Hefner was emphatic in his
distaste for censorship. With
film ratings, he said, "dollars
are affected, but speech is not.
"When we get to the point
that people equate dollars and
speech and people call it cen
sorship, I think we're hearing a
lot of bologna. ,
"Put the power to censor in
anyone's hands today, and you
will find you do not agree with
them tomorrow." That is
where the real danger to soci
ety begins, he said.


Richard Hefner
criminated against by the
board.
Film ratings exist "not to im
pose censorship, but to ensure
against censorship," according
to Richard Hefner, chairman of
the motion picture industry's
Film Rating Board (FRB).
Hefner made his remarks at a
guest lecture to 250 students
enrolled in Communication
141, History of Film, last week.
The board does not censor
anything, Hefner said. Rather,
"we give an early warning sys
tem" to parents with the G, PG,
Rand X ratings.
He said the idea was to pro
tect children by giving parents
a guide to the movie's content.
The standards employed by the
board are flexible. A movie re
ceiving a G rating means that
"by today's parental standards,
it is the board's 'educated
guess' that nothing in that film
will make the parents regret
that they allowed theirchildren
to see the film," Hefner said.
Children are the board's

concern, he said, adding that
adults should be allowed to see
anything they wish.
Hefner said the 10-year-old
board was formed by coopera
tion within a highly competi
tive industry. He said filmmak
ers were responding to efforts
by "moralizing elements of the
society" to actually censor
films.
Efforts to censor films date
back to the 1930s when the old
Production Code of America
(PCA) guidelines were in force.
According to Hefner, they re
stricted virtually everything.
Local boards
The PCA was overcome, he
said, but an absence of any
guidelines to parents lead to
local and state censor boards.
The industry responded with
the FRB.
Now, Hefner said, the
seven-member board screens
some 500 films annually.
Film exhibitor adherence to
the rating guidelines is volun

tary, Hefner said, but it is al
most universal. He said that for
any film to get a large nation
wide booking in theaters, it
must have a rating by the
board. However, the decision
to ask for a rating is also strictly
voluntary.
Changing views
Hefner said the board re
flects "changing parental
views" in its ratings. Formerly,
board members would, in
somecases, base ratings on the
number of nipples seen in the
movie. Now, he said, much
more sexuality is seen on the
screen with PC ratings than
four years ago, when he took
over as chairman. In addition,
violence is dealt with much
more firmly by the board.
Hefner said his board has
given a number of X ratings for
violence.
I he only "rule" the board
works under concerns foul
language. The rule, imposed
by the industry, requires an R
rating for the sexually oriented
slang words such as "fuck,"
and its "derivatives."
