And you thought the Invasion of the Body
< Snatchers was only a movie! A growing chorus
of politicians, military men and study groups is
intoning the need for some form of compulsory
national service. The government is staking out
its claim to anywhere from three months to two
years of your life.
U.S. Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and
U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) have proposed
legislation to create a national service system. A
study funded by the Ford Foundation recom
mended that every red-blooded American
youth give at least one year of service — military
or civilian — to the nation. But most ominous of
all was President Jimmy Carter's request for $5
million to rev up the standby draft system. De
fense Secretary Harold Brown told the Senate
Armed Services Committee that what's left of
the Selective Service System is not capable of
mobilizing enough manpower in the event of a
war.
How does it feel to be a "national resource?"
There are serious and deep-seated reasons for
the pressure to revive conscription. The issue is
more than involuntary servitude. The U.S. gov
i ernment is undergoing a major crisis. Foreign
. developments, military spending, the economy,
energy and other parts of our thoroughly
militarized society are in severe disequilibrium.
The crisis affects both civil liberties and domes
tic and foreign policy. It ties them all together
into a major conflict that may determine
whether the United States will take the path of
freedom or state despotism.
The United States has troops in over 100
foreign nations. We sell arms and give millions
in foreign "aid" to practically every country
outside the communist orbit. Moreover our ac
cess to resources in the Third World does not
depend upon the free trade of private entrep
reneurs but upon military alliances, special
government-backed loans, government con
tracts and other non-free market forms of trade.
This neomercantilist global policy must be
backed up by a worldwide U.S. military pre
sence (the stick) and U.S. government aid and
■arms sales (the carrot). Thus the United States,
which is at peace, still maintains a total force
level of 2.1 million men.
The absence of a readily available pool of
manpower and draft machinery is a serious defi
ciency in the armory of any would-be Caesar.
Before the armed forces could plunge into the
fray there would have to be Congressional de
bate and appropriations of money; the policy
would have to be justified to the people.
This irksome drawback of the volunteer milit
ary gives government officials a basic choice:
either give up our vast military commitments
around the world and confine the armed ser
vices to defense, or else junk the volunteer army
and shore up the empire. Is there any doubt
about what choice they will make?
The choice is complicated by economic and
political considerations. There are, first of all,
powerful economic interests which thrive on
our neomercantilist role abroad. The weapons
industry, government contractors, the aeros
pace industry and many, many others exert
powerful pressure in favor of the status quo.
Giving up our global commitments means giv

ing up mercantilism, demilitarizing our economy
and beginning a long readjustment toward a
rational, free-market economy as investments
once again flow to productive ventures.
In the five years since Vietnam, the rulers of
the American-empire have discovered that the
all-volunteer force (AVF) is inherently a
peacetime, defense-oriented army. While per
fectly adequate to defend the United States, the
AVF is not suited for quick mobilizations for
foreign wars and has trouble maintaining the
large troop levels necessary for global domin
ion. Even so, the AVF has proven remarkably
effective at raising volunteers.
There is also the politically troublesome fact
that the government doesn't need everyone in
the army (yet); it only needs a small portion of
the youth population. Yet the very selectivity of
the old Selective Service System was one of the
most vicious and unpopular things about it: rich
kids always managed to get out of the draft,
college students wanted deferments, non
college students resented the deferments, and
so on.
This is where "National Service," as opposed
to the bad old draft, comes in. National Service
allows you to draft everybody, tunneling those
not needed by the military into make-work jobs.
(In one stroke you satisfy both the militarists and
the statist "liberals" who want to crank out die
stamped "good citizens.")
It also neatly "solves" the youth unemploy
ment problem, created by government
minimum wage laws and other regulations, by
rounding up all the little devils into work camps.
National service is a statist's fantasy that defies
all categorization of left and right. It combines
the worst of the Comprehensive Employment
Training Act (CETA),the Army and public
schools into an American version ot the Hitler
Youth.
Efforts to oppose conscription, imperialism
and economic fascism should be a major task ot
all students in the coming months.
As goals, we all should push for:
— total abolition of the remnants of the Selec
tive Service System, which Carter is trying to
revive. This is crucial, because once the
machinery for youth registration is in place, the
draft will become inevitable.
— withdrawal of U.S. troops and bases from
around the world. Students should concentrate
on our presence in Korea, the Middle East and
Europe and advocate the restriction of U.S.
troops to the defense of United States territory.
— total and absolute opposition to any form
of involuntary servitude, whether military or
civilian in form.
Do not expect the government to be so politi
cally inept as to slap the draft on us immediately.
Chances are, we will slide into it gradually. The
establishment of some kind of registration is
likely to come first, followed by a "voluntary"
program of national service which will quickly
be made compulsory when the modern planta
tion owners decide they need us.
