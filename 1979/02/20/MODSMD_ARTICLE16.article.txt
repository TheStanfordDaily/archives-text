## Balanced budget to rein government 
### 
Our master political oppor
tunist, jerry (Chameleon)
Brown, has done us all a favor
while trying to get elected pres
ident. Though philosophically
no more committed to a ba
lanced budget than to anything
else, Brown has managed to
push the issue into the foref
ront of public attention.
Brown's decision to jump on
this issue is perhaps the best
evidence that it is an idea
whose time has come. Sup
ported by 80 percent of the
voters — Democratic as well as
Republican — the merits of a

balanced budget should not be
overlooked merely because of
Brown's cynical support. After
all, there are only two things to
dislike about him — his face.
Unfortunately, one cannot
choose one's allies.
Though a balanced budget
would be no panacea for our
woes, it would be a start. Tradi
tional concerns over an unba
lanced budget, such as fear of a
large national debt, are not ter
ribly important. Simply balanc
ing the budget for the sake of
balancing the budget isn't
worth the effort, unless the

level of government spending
falls. Turning a half-trillion dol
lar budget with a $30 billion de
ficit into a half-trillion dollar
budget with no deficit ac
complishes little, if anything.
Rather, the reason to sup
port a balanced budget is to at
tempt to control the levels of
government taxing and spend
ing. A requirement of a ba
lanced budget would more
likely result in lowered spend
ing, rather than higher taxing,
because it would force all tax
ing into the open. Our half
trillion dollar budget with a $30
billion deficit would probably
become a balanced $470 billion
budget (which is still incom
prehensibly high).
Congress now can over
spend, create deficits and
thereby surreptitiously tax
everyone through inflation, by
pushing them into higher tax
brackets. The requirement of a
balanced budget would force
Congress to explicitly raise
taxes whenever it wanted to in
crease spending, thus allowing
people to clearly and intelli
gently weigh priorities. Deficit
spending appears to give us
something for nothing. Balanc
ing the budget would end this
insidious illusion of a free
lunch.
Opponents of the proposal
wail about the loss of "flexi
blity" for our rulers to bring
about peace and prosperity.
However, after suffering
through years of politicians'
total inability to solve anything,
a little inflexibility would be
welcome.
It is time that politicians
stopped playing games with
our money; all they've man
aged to do is to concoct a half
trillion dollar budget loaded
with waste, fraud and useless
projects. And they have the
unmitigated gall to call this
spectacle of bureaucratic ag

grandizement lean and au
stere. The requirement of a
balanced budget could not but
help put a lid on this by rest
raining our rulers, who are to
tally incapable of restraining
themselves.
However, even some sup
porters of the concept of a ba
lanced budget fear the calling
of a constitutional convention
to propose an amendment.
This procedure has never been
used before, so we would be
leaping into the unknown.
Moreover, there is no guaran
tee that such a convention
could be limited to the issue of
budget reform.
The dangers, though not in
substantial, are far outweigh
ed by the potential benefits.
Among other things, Congress
could avert calling a conven
tion by getting its act together
and proposing an amendment
— just as it did for the direct
election of senators earlier this
century.
The only way the servants of
big government — such as
Birch Bayh, chairman of the
Subcommittee on Constitu
tional Amendments, will ever
accept even a modicum of fis
cal responsibility is to threaten
them with a rampaging con
vention.
If Congress fails to act, we
should force them to do so.
Congressional intransigence
has stifled the movement to
wards fiscal rationality for too
long. A balanced budget is an
important step towards con
trolling a government gone
wild.
Let's not waste this chance to
control the greedy politicians
and bureaucrats. After all,
when have they missed an op
portunity to screw us?

budget with no deficit ac
complishes little, if anything.
Rather, the reason to sup
port a balanced budget is to at
tempt to control the levels of
government taxing and spend
ing. A requirement of a ba
lanced budget would more
likely result in lowered spend
ing, rather than higher taxing,
because it would force all tax
ing into the open. Our half
trillion dollar budget with a $30
billion deficit would probably
become a balanced $470 billion
budget (which is still incom
prehensibly high).
Congress now can over
spend, create deficits and
thereby surreptitiously tax
everyone through inflation, by
pushing them into higher tax
brackets. The requirement of a
balanced budget would force
Congress to explicitly raise
taxes whenever it wanted to in
crease spending, thus allowing
people to clearly and intelli
gently weigh priorities. Deficit
spending appears to give us
something for nothing. Balanc
ing the budget would end this
insidious illusion of a free
lunch.
Opponents of the proposal
wail about the loss of "flexi
blity" for our rulers to bring
about peace and prosperity.
However, after suffering
through years of politicians'
total inability to solve anything,
a little inflexibility would be
welcome.
It is time that politicians
stopped playing games with
our money; all they've man
aged to do is to concoct a half
trillion dollar budget loaded
with waste, fraud and useless
projects. And they have the
unmitigated gall to call this
spectacle of bureaucratic ag

grandizement lean and au
stere. The requirement of a
balanced budget could not but
help put a lid on this by rest
raining our rulers, who are to
tally incapable of restraining
themselves.
However, even some sup
porters of the concept of a ba
lanced budget fear the calling
of a constitutional convention
to propose an amendment.
This procedure has never been
used before, so we would be
leaping into the unknown.
Moreover, there is no guaran
tee that such a convention
could be limited to the issue of
budget reform.
The dangers, though not in
substantial, are far outweigh
ed by the potential benefits.
Among other things, Congress
could avert calling a conven
tion by getting its act together
and proposing an amendment
— just as it did for the direct
election of senators earlier this
century.
The only way the servants of
big government — such as
Birch Bayh, chairman of the
Subcommittee on Constitu
tional Amendments, will ever
accept even a modicum of fis
cal responsibility is to threaten
them with a rampaging con
vention.
If Congress fails to act, we
should force them to do so.
Congressional intransigence
has stifled the movement to
wards fiscal rationality for too
long. A balanced budget is an
important step towards con
trolling a government gone
wild.
Let's not waste this chance to
control the greedy politicians
and bureaucrats. After all,
when have they missed an op
portunity to screw us?

Our master political oppor
tunist, jerry (Chameleon)
Brown, has done us all a favor
while trying to get elected pres
ident. Though philosophically
no more committed to a ba
lanced budget than to anything
else, Brown has managed to
push the issue into the foref
ront of public attention.
Brown's decision to jump on
this issue is perhaps the best
evidence that it is an idea
whose time has come. Sup
ported by 80 percent of the
voters — Democratic as well as
Republican — the merits of a

balanced budget should not be
overlooked merely because of
Brown's cynical support. After
all, there are only two things to
dislike about him — his face.
Unfortunately, one cannot
choose one's allies.
Though a balanced budget
would be no panacea for our
woes, it would be a start. Tradi
tional concerns over an unba
lanced budget, such as fear of a
large national debt, are not ter
ribly important. Simply balanc
ing the budget for the sake of
balancing the budget isn't
worth the effort, unless the

level of government spending
falls. Turning a half-trillion dol
lar budget with a $30 billion de
ficit into a half-trillion dollar
budget with no deficit ac
complishes little, if anything.
