## Japanese-Americans need justice 
### 
The Japanese-American Citi
zens League (JACL) is asking
Congress to appropriate three
billion dollars to partially com
pensate the Japanese-
Americans who were forced
into U.S. concentration
camps during World War 11.
Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Cal.)
has stated that Congress
should not and will not accede
to that request. Hayakawa ar
gued that this is merely
another case of reparations
demands founded on claims of
having been oppressed as a
group in the past.
Hayakawa's reasoning is
specious.
This is not a case of people
demanding recompense for
wrongs done their ancestors
centuries ago: a majority of
those who suffered through
the camps are still alive. It is not
any spurious collective right
of Japanese-Americans as a
group but rather the human
rights of particular individuals
that is at issue.
While there was no systema
tic policy of extermination in
the American concentration
camps, people did die because
of the camp conditions. The
110,000 people interned in the
camps lost approximately
$400,000,000 worth of prop
erty. Everyone forced into the
camps suffered serious and un
justified deprivations of lib
erty.
Futhermore, the rationale
behind the camps was blatantly

racist — why were there no
German-American "relocation
centers"?
To be just, those responsible
for the camps should have
been in the dock at Nuremberg
alongside the German war
criminals.
At a modest interest rate of
six percent per year, the three
billion dollars requested by the
JACL is not full compensation
even for the loss of property
sustained by the internees. It
does not begin to compensate
them for the loss of three years (
of their lives.
Hayakawa's moral judgment
on this issue is wrong; how
ever, his factual prediction of
Congressional inaction is
probably correct.
Despite the disenchantment
over Vietnam, most Americans
still view World War II as a
holy and unblemished great
crusade. If a national debate
were to erupt over the wartime
concentration camps, it might
prove the beginning of the un
raveling of that brilliant but de
ceptive tapestry which hides
the reality of World War 11.
Americans might begin to
realize that Japanese "aggres
sion" was merely the imitation
of policies pursued for cen
turies by America's allies, Fr
ance and England. Some

Americans might begin to un
derstand that the Japanese-
American conflict in the Pacific
was largely the result of previ
ous U.S. imperialism — e.g.,
the conquest of the Philippines
and the brutal suppression of
the Filipino independence
movement.
There might be some who
would remember that before
the"Day of Infamy" at Pearl
Harbor, America had already
taken actions approaching acts
of war against the Axis powers.
Some might even raise the
issue of the vicious and inhu
man Allied policy of saturation
bombing of purely civilian
targets.
The raising of such ghosts
from three decades ago might
seem an idle and harmless di
version. However, the edifice
of current American public life
rests largely on foundations
laid by the Roosevelt Administ
ration during the New Deal and
World War 11.
A serious public questioning
of those foundations would be
a blow against the structure of
the liberal welfare/warfare
state, a structure which houses
both Democrats and Republi
cans, both conservatives and
liberals.

A realistic understanding of
America's role in the second
World War is likely to impel
one towards a critical reapprai
sal of postwar foreign and
domestic policy, the policy of
interventionist globalism ab
road and of liberal economic
interventionism at home.
It is not, presumably, the
purpose of the Japanese-
American Citizens League to
ignite a general historical re
visionism. Their request, in it
self, is hardly likely to bring
down the political system or
incite a libertarian revolution.
However it is clear from the
above discussion why, as
Hayakawa predicts, Congress
is likely to avoid this issue. It
not only revives unpleasant
memories, it also tends to lead
to questions that, if pursued to
their conclusion, severely test
one's faith in the benevolence
of our rulers.
The Japanese-Americans
who were imprisoned in the
concentration camps are not
likely to receive justice. They
are trying to open a door which
our rulers would rather keep
closed.

ignite a general historical re
visionism. Their request, in it
self, is hardly likely to bring
down the political system or
incite a libertarian revolution.
However it is clear from the
above discussion why, as
Hayakawa predicts, Congress
is likely to avoid this issue. It
not only revives unpleasant
memories, it also tends to lead
to questions that, if pursued to
their conclusion, severely test
one's faith in the benevolence
of our rulers.
The Japanese-Americans
who were imprisoned in the
concentration camps are not
likely to receive justice. They
are trying to open a door which
our rulers would rather keep
closed.

The Japanese-American Citi
zens League (JACL) is asking
Congress to appropriate three
billion dollars to partially com
pensate the Japanese-
Americans who were forced
into U.S. concentration
camps during World War 11.
Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Cal.)
has stated that Congress
should not and will not accede
to that request. Hayakawa ar
gued that this is merely
another case of reparations
demands founded on claims of
having been oppressed as a
group in the past.
Hayakawa's reasoning is
specious.
This is not a case of people
demanding recompense for
wrongs done their ancestors
centuries ago: a majority of
those who suffered through
the camps are still alive. It is not
any spurious collective right
of Japanese-Americans as a
group but rather the human
rights of particular individuals
that is at issue.
While there was no systema
tic policy of extermination in
the American concentration
camps, people did die because
of the camp conditions. The
110,000 people interned in the
camps lost approximately
$400,000,000 worth of prop
erty. Everyone forced into the
camps suffered serious and un
justified deprivations of lib
erty.
Futhermore, the rationale
behind the camps was blatantly

racist — why were there no
German-American "relocation
centers"?
To be just, those responsible
for the camps should have
been in the dock at Nuremberg
alongside the German war
criminals.
At a modest interest rate of
six percent per year, the three
billion dollars requested by the
JACL is not full compensation
even for the loss of property
sustained by the internees. It
does not begin to compensate
them for the loss of three years (
of their lives.
Hayakawa's moral judgment
on this issue is wrong; how
ever, his factual prediction of
Congressional inaction is
probably correct.
Despite the disenchantment
over Vietnam, most Americans
still view World War II as a
holy and unblemished great
crusade. If a national debate
were to erupt over the wartime
concentration camps, it might
prove the beginning of the un
raveling of that brilliant but de
ceptive tapestry which hides
the reality of World War 11.
Americans might begin to
realize that Japanese "aggres
sion" was merely the imitation
of policies pursued for cen
turies by America's allies, Fr
ance and England. Some

Americans might begin to un
derstand that the Japanese-
American conflict in the Pacific
was largely the result of previ
ous U.S. imperialism — e.g.,
the conquest of the Philippines
and the brutal suppression of
the Filipino independence
movement.
There might be some who
would remember that before
the"Day of Infamy" at Pearl
Harbor, America had already
taken actions approaching acts
of war against the Axis powers.
Some might even raise the
issue of the vicious and inhu
man Allied policy of saturation
bombing of purely civilian
targets.
The raising of such ghosts
from three decades ago might
seem an idle and harmless di
version. However, the edifice
of current American public life
rests largely on foundations
laid by the Roosevelt Administ
ration during the New Deal and
World War 11.
A serious public questioning
of those foundations would be
a blow against the structure of
the liberal welfare/warfare
state, a structure which houses
both Democrats and Republi
cans, both conservatives and
liberals.

A realistic understanding of
America's role in the second
World War is likely to impel
one towards a critical reapprai
sal of postwar foreign and
domestic policy, the policy of
interventionist globalism ab
road and of liberal economic
interventionism at home.
It is not, presumably, the
purpose of the Japanese-
American Citizens League to
ignite a general historical re
visionism. Their request, in it
self, is hardly likely to bring
down the political system or
incite a libertarian revolution.
