# Trustees vote loan for new SRI facility
## 
### Mike Charlson 
SRI International of Menlo Park will receive a $5
million, 25-year loan from the University to pro
vide partial funding for a new research facility
there. The Board of Trustees approved the loan
last week.
Unanimous approval for the loan came from the
Trustees aftera plan was submitted forapproval by
Vice President for Business and Finance William
Massy.
SRI International, now an independent com
pany, was formerly known as Stanford Research
Institute and was a subsidiary of the University.
million cost
The new SRI facility will cost an estimated $12.5
million. Besides the University's loan, the com
pany plans to secure an additional $5 million in a
loan from a commerical bank. The remaining $2.5
million will be provided from SRI building reserve
funds.
Both the University and bank loan interest rates
will be just under 10 percent annually.
According to Massy, negotiations for the loan
began last spring when SRI approached the Uni
versity.
Massy said the loan will be unsecured (SRI will
offer no collateral), but he said he felt that this
decision was a sound one.
"The unsecured loan does give SRI some addi
tional financial flexibility," Massy said.
He said the bank loan would be secured by the
bank's lien on the property and building, but he
said the University felt it could forego collateral

because:
— it was felt SRl's credit is "more than
adequate," and
— under the separation agreement between the
University and SRI, if the company should go out
of business, all its assets revert to the University.
According to Massy, the only risk is that SRl's as
sets may total less than liabilities if it goes out of
business. That the company's assets will exceed its
liabilities is "a very good assumption" Massy
said.
Defer payment
Under the loan agreement, SRI will defer pay
ment of principle forat least five years, paying only
the approximately $500,000 annual interest, ac
cording to Massy.
Then in the sixth year, SRI would begin repay
ment of the principle at a rate of $250,000 annually
plus the interest on the remaining balance. This
would mean the sixth-year payment would total
nearly $750,000 with the payment total declining
annually as the unpaid balance is reduced.
The new SRI building will house the Physical
Sciences Division of the Center for Resource and
Environment Systems Study and the Energy
Center.
It will be built starting late this spring or early
this summer on the Middlefield Road side of SRI
property in Menlo Park.
The Menlo Park Planning Commission approved
the project earlier this year.
Massy said, "We think it's a good investment for
the University."

Founded in 1946 as Stanford Research Institute,
SRI remained a subsidiary of the University until
1970 when the two separated following pressure
from students and faculty who protested SRl's en
gagement in classified military research.
Because the University had spent the money to
establish the institute, the 1970 agreement pro
vided for a repayment of the investment to the
University.
Under that agreement, SRI pays the University 1
percent of its gross revenues annually, less certain
deductibles until SRI has paid the University $25
million.
For 1978, this will amount to $1 million on re
venues of about $123 million, according to a Uni
versity News Service release.
Prior to 1978, SRI had paid the University over
$5.1 million.
$25 million level in 80s
After SRI has paid the University a total of $25
million, the agreement requires the company to
pay .5 percent of its adjusted gross revenues to the
University as long as it remains in business. Massy
said the University projects that the $25 million
level will be reached in the late 1980s.
The loan will help assure future University in
come under the separation agreement and help
SRI maintain a strong competitive position, Massy
said.
Currently, about 60 percent of SRI research con
tracts come from federal agencies, with the rest
from private firms. According to Massy, some of
the research is classified.

vided for a repayment of the investment to the
University.
Under that agreement, SRI pays the University 1
percent of its gross revenues annually, less certain
deductibles until SRI has paid the University $25
million.
For 1978, this will amount to $1 million on re
venues of about $123 million, according to a Uni
versity News Service release.
Prior to 1978, SRI had paid the University over
$5.1 million.
$25 million level in 80s
After SRI has paid the University a total of $25
million, the agreement requires the company to
pay .5 percent of its adjusted gross revenues to the
University as long as it remains in business. Massy
said the University projects that the $25 million
level will be reached in the late 1980s.
The loan will help assure future University in
come under the separation agreement and help
SRI maintain a strong competitive position, Massy
said.
Currently, about 60 percent of SRI research con
tracts come from federal agencies, with the rest
from private firms. According to Massy, some of
the research is classified.
SRI International of Menlo Park will receive a $5
million, 25-year loan from the University to pro
vide partial funding for a new research facility
there. The Board of Trustees approved the loan
last week.
Unanimous approval for the loan came from the
Trustees aftera plan was submitted forapproval by
Vice President for Business and Finance William
Massy.
SRI International, now an independent com
pany, was formerly known as Stanford Research
Institute and was a subsidiary of the University.
million cost
The new SRI facility will cost an estimated $12.5
million. Besides the University's loan, the com
pany plans to secure an additional $5 million in a
loan from a commerical bank. The remaining $2.5
million will be provided from SRI building reserve
funds.
Both the University and bank loan interest rates
will be just under 10 percent annually.
According to Massy, negotiations for the loan
began last spring when SRI approached the Uni
versity.
Massy said the loan will be unsecured (SRI will
offer no collateral), but he said he felt that this
decision was a sound one.
"The unsecured loan does give SRI some addi
tional financial flexibility," Massy said.
He said the bank loan would be secured by the
bank's lien on the property and building, but he
said the University felt it could forego collateral

because:
— it was felt SRl's credit is "more than
adequate," and
— under the separation agreement between the
University and SRI, if the company should go out
of business, all its assets revert to the University.
According to Massy, the only risk is that SRl's as
sets may total less than liabilities if it goes out of
business. That the company's assets will exceed its
liabilities is "a very good assumption" Massy
said.
Defer payment
Under the loan agreement, SRI will defer pay
ment of principle forat least five years, paying only
the approximately $500,000 annual interest, ac
cording to Massy.
Then in the sixth year, SRI would begin repay
ment of the principle at a rate of $250,000 annually
plus the interest on the remaining balance. This
would mean the sixth-year payment would total
nearly $750,000 with the payment total declining
annually as the unpaid balance is reduced.
The new SRI building will house the Physical
Sciences Division of the Center for Resource and
Environment Systems Study and the Energy
Center.
It will be built starting late this spring or early
this summer on the Middlefield Road side of SRI
property in Menlo Park.
The Menlo Park Planning Commission approved
the project earlier this year.
Massy said, "We think it's a good investment for
the University."

Founded in 1946 as Stanford Research Institute,
SRI remained a subsidiary of the University until
1970 when the two separated following pressure
from students and faculty who protested SRl's en
gagement in classified military research.
Because the University had spent the money to
establish the institute, the 1970 agreement pro
vided for a repayment of the investment to the
University.
Under that agreement, SRI pays the University 1
percent of its gross revenues annually, less certain
deductibles until SRI has paid the University $25
million.
For 1978, this will amount to $1 million on re
venues of about $123 million, according to a Uni
versity News Service release.

$5.1 million.
