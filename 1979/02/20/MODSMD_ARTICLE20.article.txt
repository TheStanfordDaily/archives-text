Abortion issue
misread
I don't appreciate David
Fyhrie's letter to the editor,
(Daily, Feb. 2). Fyhrie obviously
misread or deliberately mis
represented my abortion ar
gument (Daily, ]an. .31). He
used it as an opportunity to
jump on his own platform of
moral indignaton.
My "rabbit analogy" was
used simply as a vehicle for
changing the perspective on
abortion from murder — and
premeditated murder if one
wants to extend the argument
as Fyhrie does — to a difficult
choice a woman has the right
to make as part of her human
nature. That choice is to decide
whether the circumstances for
life are good enough or not to
bring her child into this world.
I was not saying that since
rabbits do it, abortions are
good things as Fyhrie suggests
I was. I explicitly stated that I
consider abortion a killing of a
human life and hence a moral
wrong.
My purpose was choosing
the more appropriate perspec
tive on abortion. I feel a less
tepid and more comfortable at
titude toward abortion might
promote more responsibility in
preventing conception, using
birth control correcf'v and
more seriously.
Unfortunately, some abor
tions result from a casual at
titude towards birth control.
That is something to get indig
nant about, not the act of abor
tion itself. And having the
abortion is not always as simple
as switching off a light switch,
as some of my friends would
have liked to believe.
But unfortunately, people
like Fyhrie focus on abortion
with accusatory passion.
"Is the woman a murderer?"
is a predictably provocative
question. But the near
conventional use of the abor
tion issue in writing classes is
not indicative of an en
lightened conscience. In fact,
it could be seen as indicative of
a pervasive sexist atmosphere.
Yet we tolerate here.
Sometimes, I think we toler

ate it to a callous degree. The
insensitivity of the people rag
ing in the debate disappoints
and irritates me.

Rape trivialized
In response to the essay by
Tork and Slinkard (Daily, Feb.
12), I would like to gasp at what
they present as a "neutral" de
finition of rape. They state,
"Rape is an exercise of power
by a man who is trying to assert

superiority over another indi
vidual."
First the act is generalized to
include interrupting conversa
tions or winning tennis games.
Then these are limited to males
only. I submit this posturing is
sexist, anti-humanist and to
tally unnecessary to their main
points.
It trivializes the serious issue
of rape and condemns by gen
der. For the record, I am
against rape, and I do support
feminism and humanism.
