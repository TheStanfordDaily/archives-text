# Harrington and Ross
## Academics aided 
### 
(Seventh of a series)
Students who have
worked on the Little Eleven
Conference believe that an
ideal university system
would not only allow but
also encourage students to
take an active role in form
ing their own education.
The delegates from the
Committee on Academics
will pursue this goal by
learning of other schools'
solutions to problems that
students here also face.
The Committee on
Academics will focus on
four areas: general educa
tional policy, procedural
concerns, special educa
tional programs and advis
ing. Each of these areas
promises to include topics
of particular relevance and
interest to Stanford.
The subcommittee on
General Education Policy,
for example, will examine
and evaluate such things as
distribution requirements,
the controversial Western
Culture requirement and
the types of learning situa
tions most prevalent and
available.
The Procedural Concerns
subcommittee will discuss
methods and efficacy ot
teaching evaluation, stu
dent input to tenure deci

sions, the quarterversus the
semester system and the
academic grievance proce
dure.
The subcommittee on
Special Educational Prog
rams will review innovative
academic programs and
formulate new policy for in
itiation and growth of such
programs.
Finally, the fourth sub
committee will examine var
ious general and de
partmental advising sys
tems.
There is a tremendous
amount which could be
learned from this confer
ence, and we expect to re
turn with concrete and
workable solutions to
academic problems stu
dents face. We look forward
to sharing information and
working with all interested
students upon our return.
If you have any questions
or comments, please feel
free to contact us. A copy of
the University's academic
report is available at the
SCIRE office.
