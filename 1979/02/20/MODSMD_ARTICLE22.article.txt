# Cardinals axe Bears in basketball sweep
## McCrea's women rejuvenate playoff hopes with 70-62 OT win SPORTS 
### Rich Martinez 
In the better-played, more
exciting of the two basketball
games Saturday evening, the
Stanford women outdueled
Cal in overtime, 70-62.
With this win the Cardinals
improved their record to 5-4 in
league play and 17-5 overall.
The chances for a Stanford
playoff berth now look "very,
very good," according to
Coach Dotty McCrea.
The main difference bet
ween the two teams was the
aggressive board play of Stan
ford. Four of the first six Cardi
nal baskets came on second ef
forts as the Bears were outhus
tled and outmuscled under
neath.
During the first 13 minutes of
the game the lead changed
hands nine times. Stanford was
often slow in its transition after
scoring and Cal took advantage
with some quick hoops. With
seven minutes remaining,
Jeanne Ruark converted a
three-point play and the Cards
went ahead for the remainder
of the first half, 24-20.
Cal was held scoreless for
three and a half minutes as
Stanford's zone press forced
three consecutive turnovers
and resulted in a2B-20 Cardinal
lead.
Behind Laura Loggains'
scrappy play, the Bears rallied to
close the gap to 30-26. But
Ruark then tallied another
three-point play and Stanford
went to the lockers with a 35-28
lead.
The Cards did not shoot par

ticularly well, connecting on
only 16 of 36 shots. They re
bounded extremely well,
though, grabbing 24 caroms
compared to Cal's 11. Kathy
Schultz came off the bench to
lead the team with seven
boards.
The Cards didn't seem to
want to preserve their image as
a second-half team. They came
out flat and Cal pulled to within
one, 35-34, with 17:45 remain
ing.
The final twenty minutes was
played in spurts as the teams
played hide 'n seek with the
lead. Stanford could not seem
to hold onto its lead as the
Bears kept gnawing away at the
score.
Cal finally took the lead,
56-55, with 5 minutes to go and
it looked as if the contest
would be a repeat perfor
mance of the Bears' earlier
last-minute, come-from
behind victory.
"At that point I said to my
self, 'There's no way we're
going to lose this game,"' said
Angie Paccione. "We worked
too hard for it."
Cal went up by two with 2:30
to play and the score remained
the same until under a minute
to go. With 50 seconds left Pac
cione gambled and it paid off.
She succeeded in drawing a
charging foul from her oppo
nent with a brilliant acting per
formance.
Paccione then fed Ruark,
who tied the score at 59 with 28
ticks left on the clock. The
Bears were kept from scoring

and the game was forced into
overtime with Stanford now
confident of victory.
Behind two Betsy Lough ste
als, the Cards held a slim 64-62
lead with 1:30 remaining. Cal
then made a crucial mistake
and Stanford took advantage
with the play of the game.
"I couldn't believe it," said
Paccione," but they ran a
man-on-man against us. As
soon as I saw that I called 'Utah'
(Stanford's special man-on
man offense), Betsy screened
Jeanne's man perfectly and I hit
her underneath for an open
lay-up."
Ruark was fouled, she con
verted her third three-point
play of the game and the con
test was just about wrapped
up. Three Paccione foul shots
secured the Cards' revenge
victory.

"This made our season,"
said McCrea. Ruark led the
team with 19 points and 13 re
bounds. Smith added 17 and
Paccione tallied 13 while pas
sing off for five assists. Again
Schultz and Renee Steiner
turned in superb perfor
mances with eight rebounds
apiece as Stanford outboarded
Cal 47-31. The Cards face
Pacific tonight at 7:30 p.m.

Behind Laura Loggains'
scrappy play, the Bears rallied to
close the gap to 30-26. But
Ruark then tallied another
three-point play and Stanford
went to the lockers with a 35-28
lead.
The Cards did not shoot par

ticularly well, connecting on
only 16 of 36 shots. They re
bounded extremely well,
though, grabbing 24 caroms
compared to Cal's 11. Kathy
Schultz came off the bench to
lead the team with seven
boards.
The Cards didn't seem to
want to preserve their image as
a second-half team. They came
out flat and Cal pulled to within
one, 35-34, with 17:45 remain
ing.
The final twenty minutes was
played in spurts as the teams
played hide 'n seek with the
lead. Stanford could not seem
to hold onto its lead as the
Bears kept gnawing away at the
score.
Cal finally took the lead,
56-55, with 5 minutes to go and
it looked as if the contest
would be a repeat perfor
mance of the Bears' earlier
last-minute, come-from
behind victory.
"At that point I said to my
self, 'There's no way we're
going to lose this game,"' said
Angie Paccione. "We worked
too hard for it."
Cal went up by two with 2:30
to play and the score remained
the same until under a minute
to go. With 50 seconds left Pac
cione gambled and it paid off.
She succeeded in drawing a
charging foul from her oppo
nent with a brilliant acting per
formance.
Paccione then fed Ruark,
who tied the score at 59 with 28
ticks left on the clock. The
Bears were kept from scoring

and the game was forced into
overtime with Stanford now
confident of victory.
Behind two Betsy Lough ste
als, the Cards held a slim 64-62
lead with 1:30 remaining. Cal
then made a crucial mistake
and Stanford took advantage
with the play of the game.
"I couldn't believe it," said
Paccione," but they ran a
man-on-man against us. As
soon as I saw that I called 'Utah'
(Stanford's special man-on
man offense), Betsy screened
Jeanne's man perfectly and I hit
her underneath for an open
lay-up."
Ruark was fouled, she con
verted her third three-point
play of the game and the con
test was just about wrapped
up. Three Paccione foul shots
secured the Cards' revenge
victory.

"This made our season,"
said McCrea. Ruark led the
team with 19 points and 13 re
bounds. Smith added 17 and
Paccione tallied 13 while pas
sing off for five assists. Again
Schultz and Renee Steiner
turned in superb perfor
mances with eight rebounds
apiece as Stanford outboarded
Cal 47-31. The Cards face
Pacific tonight at 7:30 p.m.

AN AIRBORNE Daryle Morgan prepares to stuff the ball through in
first-half action against California Saturday. Starting for injured team
captain Paul Giovacchini, Morgan tallied a career-high 12 points and
helped the Cardinals to a 54-49 triumph over the Golden Bears.
In the better-played, more
exciting of the two basketball
games Saturday evening, the
Stanford women outdueled
Cal in overtime, 70-62.
With this win the Cardinals
improved their record to 5-4 in
league play and 17-5 overall.
The chances for a Stanford
playoff berth now look "very,
very good," according to
Coach Dotty McCrea.
The main difference bet
ween the two teams was the
aggressive board play of Stan
ford. Four of the first six Cardi
nal baskets came on second ef
forts as the Bears were outhus
tled and outmuscled under
neath.
During the first 13 minutes of
the game the lead changed
hands nine times. Stanford was
often slow in its transition after
scoring and Cal took advantage
with some quick hoops. With
seven minutes remaining,
Jeanne Ruark converted a
three-point play and the Cards
went ahead for the remainder
of the first half, 24-20.
Cal was held scoreless for
three and a half minutes as
Stanford's zone press forced
three consecutive turnovers
and resulted in a2B-20 Cardinal
lead.
Behind Laura Loggains'
scrappy play, the Bears rallied to
close the gap to 30-26. But
