# Morgan paces men's 54-49 triumph
## 
### Chris Haft 
No pill, vaccine or drug
could have been more effec
tive than Daryle Morgan was
Saturday night at Maples Pavil
ion. Morgan's career-high 12-
point performance prevented
6049 fans from nausea caused
by an otherwise horrid basket
ball game and saved the
moribund Cardinals from de
feat as Stanford outlasted
California, 54-49.
The outcome improved
Stanford's record to 5-9 in
Pacific-10 Conference play and
11-12 overall. Cal, meanwhile,
dropped its eighth straight
contest and now owns a 5-18
overall mark, 3-11 in league.
Sick shooting
With each team taking turns
at exhibiting offensive impo
tence — Cal in the first half,
Stanford in the second — it
eventually became apparent
that most of the evening's
quota of thrills had been filled
in the hotly-contested wo
men's preliminary.
The intensity of the women's
game yielded to comedy as the
Cards threatened to
thoroughly embarrass Cal in
the early going.
After jumping to a 7-4 lead,
the Bears failed to do much of
anything right for the remain
der of the half. Cal missed
shots short and long, handled
the ball as if it were a greased
pig and lost all knowledge of
how to rebound.

Aided by Cal's helplessness,
Stanford reeled of 18 points in
a row to gain a 22-7 bulge with
9:55 left in the half.
The streak began modestly
as Tom Schneiderjohn goal
tended Kimberly Belton's lay
in. However, the next basket
gave the Cards the lead and the
fans something to cheer about
as Morgan stole a pass and
sped for a breakaway slam
dunk.
Morgan contributed two
more baskets during Stan
ford's romp: a surprising 19-
foot bomb from the right side
angle and another dunk follow
ing a steal.
Given a chance to start be
cause of Paul Giovacchini's in
jured hamstring, Morgan en
joyed the opportunity. "I felt
comfortable," he said. "There
was a problem in the second
half because we were pretty
tired — we weren't moving on
offense, and that means it was
harder to pass."
Of his exuberant, scamper
ing stuffs, Morgan grinned and
said, "That's my favorite shot."
An amazing aspect of Stan
ford's surge was the fact that
Wolfe Perry, the Cards' leading
scorer, did not tally a single
point. Perry's first basket, a
fast-break lay-up on a fine as
sist from Doug Barnes in a
two-on-one situation, put
Stanford on to 31-14, the mar
gin at halftime.
The statistics explained Cal's

dearth of scoring quite clearly.
The Bears made just six of 27
first-half shots for a weak 22.2
percent. Only two Bear starters
— Schneiderjohn and Kevin
Singleton — reached the scor
ing column.
Cal coach Dick Kuchen pre
ferred to dwell on the
shortcomings of his forwards
and centers. "When your front
line goes four-for-22, and you
shoot only 22 percent, you dig
a big hole for yourself," he
said.
Scoring woes
In the second half, however,
Cal's miasma of inaccuracy
spread to the Cards. Stanford
managed just 10 points in the
first nine minutes after inter
mission and watched its lead
dwindle to 41-30.
While the spectators began
to groan as if seasick, the Cards
decided to outdo Cal's six
minute scoreless stretch of the
first half with one of their own.
After Morgan sank a short
bank shot with 10:58 to go,
Stanford failed to drop one
through the hoop for the next
seven minutes and four sec
onds.
During most of Stanford's
dry spell the Bears played
without Singleton, their lead
ing scorer, who was shackled
on the bench with four fouls.
Nevertheless, Cal crept to
within 41-37 on Singleton's two
free throws, John Caselli's 14-
footer, Walt Gillespie's lay-in

and Phil Wilhite's free throw.
Brian Welch roused the
dormant Cards at that point by
hitting a follow shot and a
spinning 12-footer. Carlos Ad
dison's lay-in and Wilhite's
jumper from the left corner re
stored the four-point margin,
but Morgan's four free throws
and Perry's lay-in gave Stanford
an ample 51-41 cushion wih 44
seconds left.
Impressions
"My impressions were that
we played a very good game in
the first half," said Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso. "We had
excellent team defense and
good intensity. In the second
half we lost defensive inten
sity; that put completely too
much stress on our offense and
affected our defense."
Fatigue, said Dißiaso, caused
Stanford's second-half prob
lems. Dißiaso admitted he
might have erred by not sub
stituting enough during the
first half, particularly for Perry
and Morgan, who were more
active than anybody.
"Because they (the Bears)
were in man-to-man and we
were double-teaming a lot, we
should have substituted
more," Dißiaso said.
Belton thought that the
Cards grew somewhat disdain
ful of Cal after the early going.
"It seemed as though we were
a little bit complacent in the
second half," said the muscu
lar forward. "We let the game

control us instead of us con
trolling the game."
A similar lack of control
characterized Cal's miserable
33.3 percent (21-for-63) shoot
ing. Singleton, Doug True and
Kevin Sparks, the Bears' three
top scorers, shot four-for-13,
five-for 15 and four-for 10 re
spectively.
Belton's game-high 13 points
were highlighted by a tempor
ary end to his free-throw shoot
ing woes. Ignoring the raucous
taunts of the Cal band, Belton
made three of four charity tos
ses.
