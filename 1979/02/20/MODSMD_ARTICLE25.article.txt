# Only rain stops Cardinal nine
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team battled the elements over the
weekend and gained a split of its four-game series with Mother
Nature.
The Cardinals were due to play three games against Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo and the Alumni Came here Sunday, but suf
fered washouts Friday and Sunday.
Nevertheless, coach Mark Marquess' nine improved its record
to 9-0 with a 6-2, 6-4 Saturday doubleheader sweep of the host
Mustangs. Last night the Cards traveled to Fresno State for a
twi-night doubleheader.
After the Cards and Cal Poly dueled through five scoreless
innings in the first game, Stanford dented the plate twice in the
sixth frame.
Mike Zboralske singled to left field and stole second base.
Catcher Bruce Walters walked, and Mike Codiroli brought in the
first run with a single. Larry Reynolds then sent in Walters with a
hit through shortshop.
The Cards' final four runs came via the long ball. In the seventh,
Codiroli singled and stole second, but his larceny was unneces
sary as John Pyle mashed a home run for his 11th and 12th RBI of
the young season.
In the following inning Phil Wilson sent one over the wall with
Paul Zuvella aboard.
Sophomore Paul Grame gave a sterling effort on the mound for
Stanford, striking out six and walking four on the way to his first
win and first complete game of 1979.
A four-run sixth inning keyed Stanford's victory in the night
cap. Pyle and Zuvella walked to lead off the inning, and each
moved up on Wilson's perfect sacrifice bunt.
Mike Toothman singled to left field, scoring Pyle. Zboralske
then hit into a fielder's choice, with Zuvella being thrown out but
not before he caused a lengthy rundown allowing Toothman to
go to third and Zboralske to second.
Freshman Loring Davies chased Toothman and Zboralske
home with a single to center. Davies later came in on Codiroli's
base hit.
Larry Kuhn gained credit for the win, with strong relief help
from Rob Irwin.
