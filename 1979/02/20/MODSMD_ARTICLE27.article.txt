# Luckless ruggers lose a squeaker

### John Sargent 
The Stanford rugby team
suffered its fourth straight de
feat Saturday, 9-8 to UC-Santa
Barbara.
The ill-fated Cardinals seem
to be falling into a predictable
pattern. Against the BATS time
ran out with Stanford threaten
ing to score the tying points.
Against the San Francisco
Rugby Club Stanford scored all
its points late in the second
half. Against the Canterbury
Rugby Club from New Zea
land, the game ended with the
ball in Canterbury's end and
Stanford thirty yards away from
the winning try.
Saturday Stanford scored
eight points in the second half,
not quite enough to overcome
Santa Barbara's nine-point
halftime margin.
Early in the second half the
Cardinals' scrum, dominant
from start to finish, forced the
ball downfield. Redmond

Burke finally broke loose and
scored as momentum swung to
Stanford.
With 10 minutes left in the
game, Keith Donald scored in
the corner. "Young" Jamie
Turner could not kick the dif
ficult conversion and Stanford
trailed by one.
The Cardinals controlled the
game until its end, but once
again could not punch over the
winning score. Overall, how
ever, Stanford played excellent
rugby Saturday, as it has all
year. The Cards could have
won this game, as has been the
case in the three preceding
games. Much like the football
team, the ruggers seem to have
much more talent than their
record shows:
The second team also lost a
close game, 13-9 to Santa Bar
bara. Guy Seaton scored for
Stanford with Tim Dewhurst
adding a conversion and a
penalty kick.
