Fresno — The Piesident's
Day weekend found Stanford's
gymnastics teams taking it to
the streets — the streets of
Fresno, Hayward, Fullerton
and L.A. in the busiest days of
the almost-completed season.
Sadao Hamada and his gym
nasts lost to Cal State-Fullerton
Friday night 216.05 to 202.30,
but the loss was obscured by
career-high all-around per
formances by Tad Bostick and
Mike Lee. Bostick placed fifth
on high bar, fourth in vaulting
and parallel bars and third in
floor exercise to finish third in
all-around with a 52.45 total.
Lee earned fourth place in all
around, tallying a career-high
mark of 50.45.
Senior co-captain Chris
Takimoto placed third on
pommel horse with an 8.9
mark.
Saturday night Stanford de
feated UCLA by a 202.90 to
197.90 margin. The Bruins im
proved upon their showing in
Maples Pavilion, but the Car
dinals also fared better, ac
cording to Hamada. "There
were a few key mistakes, but
our overall performance was
better at UCLA (than at Fuller
ton)," he said.
Bostick placed fourth in vau
lting, third on high bar and
won in floor to sweep the all
around title with a 49.65 total.
Lee earned seconds in bar,
rings and horse to finish sec
ond in all-around at 49.60.

Bob Daniel came in fourth
on bars and rings and won vaul
ting with a 9.20 score to wind
up at fourth in all-around with a
46.45 total.
Other top Card perfor
mances included Bob Maga
nini's fourth in bar and floor,
Jeff Chung's fifth-place finish
in vaulting and Brian Nelson's
second on bar. Takimoto
bounced back from Friday's
"off" performance to outdis
tance the competition on
horse, winning the event with a
9.55 score.
"Our consistent score ap
pears to be 202 points,"
Hamada noted.
After the last dual meet of
the season at Chico State Fri
day, Hamada and his team will
focus their efforts towards the
Pacific-10 and regional compet
ition. After a two-day rest, the
team returns to workouts
today to prepare for a home
stretch which will "really test
their desire" and "peak" at the
post-season meets, according
to Hamada.
"We'll see who's really into it
— only 12 guys can go to reg
ional," he added.
Jackie Walker's gymnasts
outpaced Cal State-Fresno
116.55 to 110.45 Friday after
noon, but Kim Sanders of the
Bulldogs ran off with firsts in
each event and the all-around
title with a 34.40 score. Stan
ford's Annie Smith was
runner-up, compiling a 32.75
total with second in all events.

Card captain Linda Park placed
fourth in all-around at 26.30
and recorded a fifth on balance
beam, fourth in vaulting and
third in floor.
Other top Stanford perfor
mers were Jeanette Lacoste,
who placed fourth on bars and
Cindy Sedlund, earning fifth in
floor and third on beam. Karen
Hall, trying to heal injuries,
only entered one event, plac
ing third on bars.
"There were too many mis
takes, but in between the mis
takes they're starting to look
more polished," Walker
explained. "The basic move

ment of their routines is better.
I was pleased with all girls on
beam — they had a few falls but
they looked very strong.
They're becoming more ag
gressive in the routines."
At the Western Hemisphere
Games, a.k.a. the Hayward
Invitational, Hall finished sixth
in all-around with a 34.15 total
and third in floor with an 8.75
mark. Smith tied for third in
vaulting with an 8.60 and
earned fourth on bars with an
8.80, both career-high perfor
mances. Smith's 33.50 all
around total gave her a ninth
place finish.

"Karen and Annie were re
ally glad to have the experience
because they're used to going
against teams with only one or
two girls giving them competi
tion, while here they had 25
girls close to their level,"
Walker said. "Here their mis
takes cost them a great deal —
if you add Annie's two falls on
beam, she would have been
fourth in all-around and adding
Karen's two falls, she would
have been first in all-around.
"Hopefully they'll learn from
this meet and have a more
positive attitude about going to
regionals," Walker added.

lting, third on high bar and
won in floor to sweep the all
around title with a 49.65 total.
Lee earned seconds in bar,
rings and horse to finish sec
ond in all-around at 49.60.

Bob Daniel came in fourth
on bars and rings and won vaul
ting with a 9.20 score to wind
up at fourth in all-around with a
46.45 total.
Other top Card perfor
mances included Bob Maga
nini's fourth in bar and floor,
Jeff Chung's fifth-place finish
in vaulting and Brian Nelson's
second on bar. Takimoto
bounced back from Friday's
"off" performance to outdis
tance the competition on
horse, winning the event with a
9.55 score.
"Our consistent score ap
pears to be 202 points,"
Hamada noted.
After the last dual meet of
the season at Chico State Fri
day, Hamada and his team will
focus their efforts towards the
Pacific-10 and regional compet
ition. After a two-day rest, the
team returns to workouts
today to prepare for a home
stretch which will "really test
their desire" and "peak" at the
post-season meets, according
to Hamada.
"We'll see who's really into it
— only 12 guys can go to reg
ional," he added.
Jackie Walker's gymnasts
outpaced Cal State-Fresno
116.55 to 110.45 Friday after
noon, but Kim Sanders of the
Bulldogs ran off with firsts in
each event and the all-around
title with a 34.40 score. Stan
ford's Annie Smith was
runner-up, compiling a 32.75
total with second in all events.

Card captain Linda Park placed
fourth in all-around at 26.30
and recorded a fifth on balance
beam, fourth in vaulting and
third in floor.
Other top Stanford perfor
mers were Jeanette Lacoste,
who placed fourth on bars and
Cindy Sedlund, earning fifth in
floor and third on beam. Karen
Hall, trying to heal injuries,
only entered one event, plac
ing third on bars.
"There were too many mis
takes, but in between the mis
takes they're starting to look
more polished," Walker
explained. "The basic move

ment of their routines is better.
I was pleased with all girls on
beam — they had a few falls but
they looked very strong.
They're becoming more ag
gressive in the routines."
At the Western Hemisphere
Games, a.k.a. the Hayward
Invitational, Hall finished sixth
in all-around with a 34.15 total
and third in floor with an 8.75
mark. Smith tied for third in
vaulting with an 8.60 and
earned fourth on bars with an
8.80, both career-high perfor
mances. Smith's 33.50 all
around total gave her a ninth
place finish.

"Karen and Annie were re
ally glad to have the experience
because they're used to going
against teams with only one or
two girls giving them competi
tion, while here they had 25
girls close to their level,"
Walker said. "Here their mis
takes cost them a great deal —
if you add Annie's two falls on
beam, she would have been
fourth in all-around and adding
Karen's two falls, she would
have been first in all-around.
"Hopefully they'll learn from
this meet and have a more
positive attitude about going to
regionals," Walker added.
