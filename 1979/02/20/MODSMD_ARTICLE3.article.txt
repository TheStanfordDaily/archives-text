# CIA accused of covertly recruiting students
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
The CIA has refused to admit that it
covertly recruits foreign students on
college campuses in the United
States because, "if the American
public finds out what they are doing,
they will be forced to stop what they
are doing," Morton Halperin, presi
dent of the Center for National Sec
urity Studies, told an audience of
about 150 persons in Terman Au
ditorium Friday afternoon.
Many colleges and universities
prohibit covert recruiting, he said,
but the CIA simply ignores the pro
hibitions.
He said the only way for univer
sities to stop covert CIA campus re
cruitment is to state clearly their op
position to it. He said that such op
position will be heeded by Congress,
which is currently drafting a new char
ter for the CIA.
Congress won't fight
"If the universities remain silent,"
Halperin said, "Congress will take
the attitude that of the 72 issues they
will be fighting the CIA on, they
won't bother to fight this one if the
universities don't want it fought."
In response to complaints from
universities over alleged covert re
cruitment practices, the CIA stated
that it "recruits all staff openly,"
Halperin said. He noted, however,
that by definition, anyone recruited
for covert activities could not be re
cruited openly.
The ClA's response to criticism of
its policies, Halperin said, is that it
"should be able to do anything we
have to in order to fulfill our func
tion."
The process of recruitment is
complex, Halperin said. CIA agents
approach professors known to have
contacts with foreign students posing
as writers for specialized publica
tions, he explained. They say they are
looking for students to write for
those publications.

It is almost impossible fora profes
sor or a student to know they are
being approached by a CIA agent,
Halperin said. If they do realize what
is going on, Halperin said, they usu
ally have difficulty making specific
accusations. "People are ap
proached in such an elliptical way that
you don't know what you've really
refused," he explained.
Halperin said that sometimes pro
fessors are asked openly by CIA
agents to assist in recruiting foreign
students. He said he is opposed to
this because "a university professor
does not have the right to engage in
conversation with a student, when
the purpose is to obtain information
from the student which can be used
to convince the student to go back to
his home country and spy for the
CIA."
Make people aware
The most effective way to fight
covert recruitment, according to
Halperin, is for universities to make
professors and foreign students
aware of it."It is no longer possible
(for universities) to hide in ignor
ance. The CIA has effectively admit
ted what it is doing and it's up to the
universities to say something about
it,"he said.
Halperin pointed out that Stanford
does not explicitly prohibit covert
recruitment. John Schwartz, Univer
sity counsel, explained that "after
the issue received notoriety about a
year ago, the question was put to the
Faculty Senate and discussed. The
Faculty Senate consensus was that
the existing policy of the University
on the secrecy of research was suffi
cient as a general policy to deal with
the CIA recruitment."
No secret research
According to Schwartz, the policy
states that no agency may contract
secret research with University fa
culty.
Halperin said the CIA still contracts

research with faculty members here
but there are no secret contracts. He
added that the CIA is "interested in
students from all countries. There is
an open-ended generalized interest
in recruiting students from all over
the world."
Asked if any foreign intelligence
agencies were known to be operat
ing at Stanford, Halperin said, "Any
country with substantial concentra
tions of students here would be very

likely to have agents on campus."
Halperin cited Taiwan, South
Korea and the now deposed Iranian
government as possibilities.
According to Halperin, there is a
CIA station in the Bay area which is
"secret, undercover, in constant
communication with Washington
and the various universities in the
area. It is very hard to find these
people."

professors and foreign students
aware of it."It is no longer possible
(for universities) to hide in ignor
ance. The CIA has effectively admit
ted what it is doing and it's up to the
universities to say something about
it,"he said.
Halperin pointed out that Stanford
does not explicitly prohibit covert
recruitment. John Schwartz, Univer
sity counsel, explained that "after
the issue received notoriety about a
year ago, the question was put to the
Faculty Senate and discussed. The
Faculty Senate consensus was that
the existing policy of the University
on the secrecy of research was suffi
cient as a general policy to deal with
the CIA recruitment."
No secret research
According to Schwartz, the policy
states that no agency may contract
secret research with University fa
culty.
Halperin said the CIA still contracts

research with faculty members here
but there are no secret contracts. He
added that the CIA is "interested in
students from all countries. There is
an open-ended generalized interest
in recruiting students from all over
the world."
Asked if any foreign intelligence
agencies were known to be operat
ing at Stanford, Halperin said, "Any
country with substantial concentra
tions of students here would be very

likely to have agents on campus."
Halperin cited Taiwan, South
Korea and the now deposed Iranian
government as possibilities.
According to Halperin, there is a
CIA station in the Bay area which is
"secret, undercover, in constant
communication with Washington
and the various universities in the
area. It is very hard to find these
people."
The CIA has refused to admit that it
covertly recruits foreign students on
college campuses in the United
States because, "if the American
public finds out what they are doing,
they will be forced to stop what they
are doing," Morton Halperin, presi
dent of the Center for National Sec
urity Studies, told an audience of
about 150 persons in Terman Au
ditorium Friday afternoon.
Many colleges and universities
prohibit covert recruiting, he said,
but the CIA simply ignores the pro
hibitions.
He said the only way for univer
sities to stop covert CIA campus re
cruitment is to state clearly their op
position to it. He said that such op
position will be heeded by Congress,
which is currently drafting a new char
ter for the CIA.
Congress won't fight
"If the universities remain silent,"
Halperin said, "Congress will take
the attitude that of the 72 issues they
will be fighting the CIA on, they
won't bother to fight this one if the
universities don't want it fought."
In response to complaints from
universities over alleged covert re
cruitment practices, the CIA stated
that it "recruits all staff openly,"
Halperin said. He noted, however,
that by definition, anyone recruited
for covert activities could not be re
cruited openly.
The ClA's response to criticism of
its policies, Halperin said, is that it
"should be able to do anything we
have to in order to fulfill our func
tion."
The process of recruitment is
complex, Halperin said. CIA agents
approach professors known to have
contacts with foreign students posing
as writers for specialized publica
tions, he explained. They say they are
looking for students to write for
those publications.

It is almost impossible fora profes
sor or a student to know they are
being approached by a CIA agent,
Halperin said. If they do realize what
is going on, Halperin said, they usu
ally have difficulty making specific
accusations. "People are ap
proached in such an elliptical way that
you don't know what you've really
refused," he explained.
Halperin said that sometimes pro
fessors are asked openly by CIA
agents to assist in recruiting foreign
students. He said he is opposed to
this because "a university professor
does not have the right to engage in
conversation with a student, when
the purpose is to obtain information
from the student which can be used
to convince the student to go back to
his home country and spy for the
CIA."
Make people aware
The most effective way to fight
covert recruitment, according to
Halperin, is for universities to make
professors and foreign students
aware of it."It is no longer possible
(for universities) to hide in ignor
ance. The CIA has effectively admit
ted what it is doing and it's up to the
universities to say something about
it,"he said.

does not explicitly prohibit covert
