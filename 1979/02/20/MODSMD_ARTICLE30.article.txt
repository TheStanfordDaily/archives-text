# Swimmers sink at Cal, win at Santa Clara
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Imitating holiday study habits and in
anticipation of more important meets
to come, Stanford swimmers per
formed rather listlessly last weekend.
California throttled the Cardinal
men, 85-48, at Berkeley's Harmon Pool
Saturday afternoon. '
Meanwhile, the women cruised to an
effortless 1295 to 819 victory over their
closest challenger, Cal, in the five-team
Nor-Cal Championships, held Friday
and Saturday at the Santa Clara Interna
tional Swimming Center.
The men managed to eke out a paltry
total of five wins out of 15 events against
the Bears' bastions of talent. Coach Jim
Gaughran explained the distinct lack of
fast times in comparison with the pre
vious two weeks' sensational swims
against UCLA and USC when he said
that "our kids were overlooking this

meet. We don't emphasize every meet,
and we had not trained specifically for
Cal.
"It's hard to swim the same event
week after week and expect supreme
efforts," he elaborated. In fact, he con
tinued that "it's a little much to ask of a
limited group of guys like we have.
We're not deep enough to switch
events around like Cal."
The Bears used rested swimmers Ron
Laher and Par Arvidsson advantage
ously to spring from the starting blocks
to an early and subsequently insur
mountable lead. Combined with
Olympian Graham Smith's dominance
of the 100 yard breaststroke, Laher and
Arvidsson's respective victories in the
100 backstroke and butterfly swept the
first three races of the day for Cal and,
according to Gaughran, "put a damper
on any enthusiasm we might have

had."
Pointing to the meet's few highlights,
Gaughran noted that "Tom O'Brien is
getting stronger and stronger in the 200
fly." O'Brien controlled the first heat of
that event with a clocking of 1:52.71.
Pele Holmertz, a Cal freshman hail
ing from Sweden, touched out the
Cards' Mike Bruner in the 200 freestyle,
but Bruner came back to win the 200 fly
(1:51.83) and the 500 free (4:31.8).
Ken Shilling perpetuated his string of
outstanding competition by winning
the 200 breast (2:10.32) and finishing
second in the 200 individual medley
(1:55.78) and the 100 breast (59.69).
Gaughran described the rest of the
team as "kind of flat," although John
Kingery did extend his 100 free victory
streak (47.48).
The women ran away with the honors
in their action against California, Uni

versity of Pacific, San Jose State and
Fresno, but, in Caughran's words,
"their times were not that great." They
also were in the middle of a taper
period and were slow and tired from a
preponderance of sprinting at work
outs last week.
At Santa Clara the women captured
all but a mere seven events in a 22-race
schedule. Maria Pease clipped to a fast
200 fly win in 2:06.24 and also claimed
first place in the 100 fly (59.23). Noel
Moran and Linda Jezek once again
wiped the deck with their competitors
by amassing five triumphs between
them. Of principle consequence was
Kim Peyton's return to the ranks of
swimming champions with a first in the
100 free (53.19). Gaughran called
Peyton's resurgence "encouraging"
and added that "she should be able to
help us a lot."

Cards' Mike Bruner in the 200 freestyle,
but Bruner came back to win the 200 fly
(1:51.83) and the 500 free (4:31.8).
Ken Shilling perpetuated his string of
outstanding competition by winning
the 200 breast (2:10.32) and finishing
second in the 200 individual medley
(1:55.78) and the 100 breast (59.69).
Gaughran described the rest of the
team as "kind of flat," although John
Kingery did extend his 100 free victory
streak (47.48).
The women ran away with the honors
in their action against California, Uni

versity of Pacific, San Jose State and
Fresno, but, in Caughran's words,
"their times were not that great." They
also were in the middle of a taper
period and were slow and tired from a
preponderance of sprinting at work
outs last week.
At Santa Clara the women captured
all but a mere seven events in a 22-race
schedule. Maria Pease clipped to a fast
200 fly win in 2:06.24 and also claimed
first place in the 100 fly (59.23). Noel
Moran and Linda Jezek once again
wiped the deck with their competitors
by amassing five triumphs between
them. Of principle consequence was
Kim Peyton's return to the ranks of
swimming champions with a first in the
100 free (53.19). Gaughran called
Peyton's resurgence "encouraging"
and added that "she should be able to
help us a lot."
