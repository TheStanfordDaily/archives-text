# Spikers lose in five
##

Momentum. It is that unseen
force that controls the out
come of many a sporting event.
Momentum is as unpredictable
and two-faced as any flirtatious
young girl: one minute it is
your ally, then suddenly your
most troublesome foe, turning
leads into deficits, then losses.
Witness, for example, the
men's volleyball match bet
ween Stanford and Long Beach
State last Friday. The Cardinals
overcame a first-game loss to
win the next two with ease, and
appeared to be on their way to
their first California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association
(CIVA) victory this year. Long
Beach had different things in
mind however, and roared
back to beat Stanford 17-15,
10-15, 9-15, 15-10 and 15-12.
The 49ers opened the match
by squeaking out the opening
game, turning back Stanford's
usual late-game charge, junior
Rod Fletcher came through
with two clutch putaways to
even the score at 14-14, but
steady LBS thwarted the come
back attempt with some timely
hitting of its own to pull out the
first game. Disheartened by
this first-game loss, many of
Stanford's fair-weather fans
headed for the Maples Pavilion
exits, assuming that the Cards
would fold.
In the second and third
games, however, the 49ers
were the ones to fold. The usu
ally potent LBS offense turned
flat, hitting many of Jim
Moore's sets into the net. At
the same time, Stanford's all

around play picked up. Rich
Yardley recorded two early
kills and Dave Carico added a
stuff block at 7-3 to push Stan
ford to an insurmountable
lead. Some dubious officiating
kept the 49ers close till Yardley
dodged an errant LBS spike to
give the Cards the second
game, 15-10.
The third game continued in
much the same fashion. Stan
ford could do no wrong, while
Long Beach remained inept.
The 6-foot-7 Yardley forgot that
huge blockers like himself are
supposed to be clumsy on de
fense, and the Newport Beach
native dug nearly everything
pounded at him.
On the other end of the
height spectrum, 5-foot-8 Kip
Engen embarrassed Long
Beach's big gun Curt Hanson
(6-foot-8) with two roof blocks.
Who's to say, then, that the
Cardinals shouldn't have been
smiling (as they were) after that
third game? Nevertheless the
49ers came out of nowhere to
win the last two games in rather
decisive style.
Hanson and Kevin Cote
teamed up to block for three
points early in the fourth game,
and continued to stifle the
Cardinal hitters throughout
the remainder of the match.
A Randy Smith ace and more
defensive wizardry by Yardley
at 8-4 came too late, for the
momentum was now with the
49ers.
The sudden change in the
quality of Long Beach's play
was seen most clearly in the
turnabout of setter Moore's
ability to run the 49er offense.

The Long Beach middle attack,
non-existent for most of the
night, made brief though effec
tive appearance in the last two
games.
Middle hitters Hanson and
Mike Brawley, having spent the
first three games mis-hitting
and ineffectively dinking
Moore's one sets, began to put
away more of their middle op
portunities. The improved
middle-hitting then allowed
Moore to run more set plays
designed to confuse the Stan
ford blockers.
Particularly productive for
LBS was its cross-tandem, which
Long Beach executed with
textbook efficiency. On sev
eral occasions, two Cardinals
would go up to block the mid
dle hitter, leaving the crossing
attacker, to his delight, all
alone.
With no one blocking, it
wasn't if the 49ers would win
the point, it was how: after
pounding the ball off the
bodies of various back-row
Cards, Cote and Hanson found
out that there are ways to win
points other than hitting the
ball directly to the floor.
Even defensive standout
Smith was at the mercy of these
uncontested blasts, as one of
Hanson's cannon-shots put the
Smith family jewels in real
danger.
Coach Fred Sturm's Cardi
nals are now 2-2 on the season,
though both losses have come
in C!VA play. Stanford will try
to back on the winning
track this weekend against vis
itors San Diego State and UC-
Santa Barbara.
