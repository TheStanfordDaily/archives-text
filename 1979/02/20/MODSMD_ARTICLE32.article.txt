The Stanford men's tennis
team got off on the right foot
last Friday, defeating UC-lrvine
6%-2V4 on the varsity courts.
"This was one of the best
opening matches I've seen,"
observed coach Dick Could.
"We looked reasonably sharp
for this time of year. The team
really approached this match
well. Our top four players really
took charge and sustained
concentration throughout
their matches."
Matt Mitchell, the Cards' top
singles player, took care of
local product Matt Woolridge
7-6, 6-2. Peter Rennert out
finessed Curt Stalder 6-3, 6-1.
Lloyd Bourne outhit Mike Edles
6-2, 6-2 and )im Hodges
needed but 30 minutes to dis

pose of Bryan Sullivan 6-3,6-1.
"I was also very pleased that
Andy Chase won a long, close,
tough match," pointed out
Gould. Chase defeated Jim
Slaught 6-4, 6-7, 7-6.
The lone singles victory for
Irvine came in a marathon bat
tle of ground strokes as John
Corse, playing his first match
for Stanford, dropped a 1-6,
6-2, 7-6 decision to steady
Lance Good.
The Cards emptied the
bench for the doubles, with
Bourne the only regular in the
lineup. He teamed up with
freshman Jeff Arons for a 6-0,
6-4 drubbing of Edles and Stal
der.
The second doubles team of

Alan Blumberg and Jeff Jones
dropped a 6-2, 7-6 decision to
Woolridge and Sullivan, and
the third doubles squad of Jeff
Brandon and Peter Morris had
to settle for a draw.
The duo dropped the first set
6-4, but lobbed its way to a
second-set win by an identical
score. Darkness made the third
set impossible to play.
"I was very pleased that we
didn't play sloppily," stressed
Could. "Our doubles looked
real good. We're going to
have to play a lot better to beat
SMU and Trinity in two
weeks."
The Cards travel to Berkeley
tomorrow to play the Northern
California Intercollegiates.
California, the No. 7 ranked

team in the nation, and San
Jose State will pose the stiffest
competition.
"I'm looking forward to the
tournament. We've won it the
last nine years in a row," boasts
Could.
Stanford's lineup for the
tourney will be Mitchell, Re
nnert, Bourne, Hodges and
freshmen Tim Mayotte and
Scott Bondurant.
Mayotte and Bondurant mis
sed Friday's match because of
their participation in other
tournments. Mayotte was in
Germany with the United
State's 21-and-under team.
Bondurant used the week to
play in the National Indoor
Amateur Championships in
Salisbury, Md.
