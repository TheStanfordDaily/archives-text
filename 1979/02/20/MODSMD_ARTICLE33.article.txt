## Youth, experience top Colorado 
### 
Displaying the power and ba
lance that brought it the AIAW
National Championship, Stan
ford's women's tennis team
easily handled Colorado,
7%-1%, at the varsity courts
here Saturday.
All-Americans Diane Morri
son and Susie Hagey, par
ticipating for the first time this
year, led the Cardinals'
triumph. In singles play Morri
son defeated Suzanne Green
6-0, 6-1, while Hagey tamed
Carla Wittenberg 6-1, 6-2.
Morrison and Hagey also
teamed up in doubles for a 6-0,
6-4 victory over Kit McPhail and
Frances Chase.
"Diane and Susie did an out
standing job,and they concen
trated well," commented Stan
ford coach Anne Gould. "It
was good to get them going."
Freshman Julia Leighton was

also particularly impressive,
winning her singles match 6-1,
6-4 over Bonnie Benson and
joining teammate Marianne
Ingard for a 6-2, 6-4 doubles
conquest of Benson and Wit
tenberg. "She's looked very,
very good in our first two
matches," Gould said of
Leighton.
On the whole, Gould was
quite pleased with the im
provement shown by the
younger players like Leighton,
freshman Lisa Gordon and
sophomore Caryn Hertel.
"This kind of match gives
them the experience they
need," said Gould. "They have
to learn that in college you
have to play not just for your
self but also for the team."
The team resumes action
Friday against University of
Pacific here at 2:30 p.m.
