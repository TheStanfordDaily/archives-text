Khomeini aims to end strife
Tehran, Iran — Unidentified "counter
revolutionary elements" set fire to the U.S.
consulate yesterday in the northwestern Ira
nian city of Tabriz, the city's state-run radio
reported. The one American assigned to the
post had left Tabriz on Sunday, U.S. officials
said.
Amid other reports of disorder, the Ayatol
lah Ruhollah Khomeini warned he would crush
any "bandits" causing trouble and view their
activities as an uprising against his new Islamic
republic.
Tabriz Radio, now in the hands of supporters
of the ayatollah, appealed to local citizens to
put out the fire at the consulate.
U.S. officials were unable to confirm the re
port of the fire, but said that Michael Metrinko,
the only American assigned to the consulate,
had returned to Tehran on Sunday.
Heavy fighting was reported last week in
Tabriz, 330 miles northwest of Tehran. Up to
700 people were reported killed when army
units joined pro-shah activists in battles
against forces loyal to Khomeini.
The government sent troops to the western
province of Kurdistan amid reports of unrest
and a declaration of "independence" among
Kurdish separatists.
In a statement broadcast over Tehran Radio,
Khomeini ordered his irregulars to aid police
and the army in "maintaining law and order
... a group of bandits and unlawful elements
are taking advantage of the situation and are
making efforts to pursue their evil objectives."
In other developments, visiting Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat formally took control of
the former Israeli trade mission in Tehran and
declared it the world's first "embassy of Pales
tine."
Some 33 persons, including Israeli dip
lomats, staff members of El Al airline and
Jewish Agency representatives, left Tehran
Sunday on a U.S. evacuation flight to
Frankfurt, West Germany, and then flew on to
Israel after Iran's new government ordered

them expelled.
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan said
he regretted that Iran had broken ties with the
Jewish state, but added, "if they cooperate
with the PLO physically in their terrorist ac
tions, it will be another matter and a very seri
ous one for us."
Mideast peace talks resume
Tel Aviv, Israel — The Israeli delegation to
the Israel-Egypt peace talks at Camp David
hopes to hear new American proposals for
reaching a peace treaty, Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan said yesterday before departing
for the United States.
The Americans took the initiative in renew
ing the negotiations between Israel and Egypt,
Dayan told an airport news conference.
"Apparently they do think there is a way to
overcome the gap between the Egyptians and
our side," Dayan said. "We are looking for
ward to hearing the American proposals."
As a result of the overthrow of Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Dayan said he ex
pected Egyptian negotiators to be "less flexi
ble" because "they will have in the back of
their minds what's going on in the area and not
willing to be isolated from the rest of the Arab
world."
Dayan said over the weekend that his dele
gation was authorized only to present posi
tions and clarify proposals, leaving any final
decision on the negotiations for the entire
government.
But he indicated that he believed a summit
meeting with Begin, Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat and President Jimmy Carter would be
required for achieving a peace treaty.
Snowstorm buries Northeast
A blinding holiday snowstorm born in one
of the bitterest winters on record virtually
paralyzed much of the Northeast yesterday,
spoiling George Washington's birthday.
The nation s capital was buried under its

heaviest snowfall in more than half a century,
with accumulations up to two feet, and traffic
was practically at a standstill, except for a few
cross-country skiers.
The normally bustling airports in
Washington, Philadelphia and New York were
shutdown, Amtrak cancelled many of its trains
in the Northeast corridor, and blowing and
drifting snow brought highway travel to a
crawl.
Firemen join police pickets
New Orleans — Off-duty firemen joined
striking police on picket lines yesterday, as
National Guardsmen in jeeps patrolled a city
denied its traditional Mardi Cras parades.
Meanwhile, new talks opened aimed at end
ing the walkout by police, who want their
Teamsters Union bargaining unit to include
ranking officers. They also are demanding that
the mayor agree to binding arbitration.
With the remainder of the Mardi Cras celeb
rations hanging in the balance, the city Civil
Service Commission opened a hearing on the
policemen's wage and benefits demands.
At the same time, a federal mediator called a
meeting of the bargaining teams for Vincent
Bruno, head of the Police Association of
Louisiana, and Mayor Ernest Morial on matters
not dealing with money.
Rhodesia bombs guerrilla post
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Rhodesia said its
warplanes bombed a guerrilla "storage com
plex" in neighboring Mozambique yesterday.
The attack appeared to be the start of a cam
paign to make sure black nationalists do not
sabotage up-coming elections.
The elections, scheduled for April 20, will
give Rhodesia's black majority limited control
of the government after 90 years of rule by the
whites. Black nationalists have vowed to dis
rupt the voting.
A Rhodesian communique yesterday said
the warplanes struck in the morning against a
storage complex of Robert Mugabe's Zim

babwe African National Union located in
Chimoio, about 80 miles east of the Rhodesian
border.
Special OPEC meeting called
Kuwait — Kuwait's oil minister Sheik Ali
Khalifah al-Sabah said yesterday there will be a
special meeting of the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries on March 26 to
discuss oil price confusion resulting from the
cutoff of Iranian supplies.
Iran was OPEC's second-largest producer
after Saudi Arabia until strife there closed
down the oil fields. Iran used to produce some
six million barrels of oil a day.
He made the announcement before leaving
for talks with other Arab oil ministers.
Al-Sabah and Venezuelan oil minister Valen
tine Hernandez were believed headed for Abu
Dhabi to meet Mana Saeed Oteiba of the Un
ited Arab Emirates.
In Kuwait, Hernandez said, "it is of extreme
importance that oil ministers of concerned
countries hold a meeting to discuss the current
chaos in oil prices."
Last December, OPEC decided on phased
price hikes totaling 14.5 percent for this year.
The cartel was to set the price increase for the
second quarter by the end of March.
Abu Dhabi and Qatar have already raised the
price of some lighter crudes by 7 percent over
the OPEC price of $13.34 per 42-gallon barrel.
They said oil companies and middlemen
were making "huge windfall profits," selling
oil for up to $8 a barrel more than the OPEC
price on the spot market because of chaos and
shortages resulting from the Iran cutoff.
