The Daily reported last Friday that
during the Harrington-Lipset debate,
Michael Harrington said that the Un
ited States "should have been the
first socialist country, given its
capitalistic development."
This remark was incorrectly attri
buted; in fact, Seymour Martin Lip
set made the remark. The Daily re
grets the error.
