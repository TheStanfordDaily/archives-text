# 'Punitive measure' against Vietnam
## Chinese advance halts after 6 miles 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) â€” Western
intelligence sources in Bangkok said
China's invasion forces had stopped
about six miles inside northern Viet
nam yesterday and some Chinese
units may be pulling back. They
noted China has said it wanted to
"teach Vietnam a lesson," not oc
cupy Vietnamese territory.
But in Washington, U.S. analysts
said they were unaware of any
Chinese withdrawal or a slackening
of the assault. They said it did appear
that the fighting was concentrated
within six miles of the Chinese bor
der.
Unconfirmed reports
Unconfirmed reports from Mos
cow said all Soviet military leaves had
been cancelled and troops put on
alert. The Soviets warned China on
Sunday to pull out of Vietnam im
mediately.
Vietnam said it inflicted heavy
casualties on the Chinese, killing
3500 troops and destroying more
than 100 tanks since the invasion
started Saturday.
The Voice of Vietnam, monitored
in Bangkok, said the Vietnamese kil
led 1000 Chinese troops and de
stroyed 30 tanks in the rugged moun
tain province of Hoang Lien Son and
reported similar figures in Cao Bang
province.
In Long Son province, Vietnam
claimed 600 Chinese killed and 20

tanks destroyed and said the
strategic "Friendship Gate" border
area was littered with some 60 de
stroyed Chinese tanks.
Fighting was reported in other
northern provinces as well. The re
ports could not be independently
verified.
The Vietnamese Embassy in
Bangkok said the Chinese advanced
no more than six miles into Vietnam.
Retaliation
Peking has said the attack was in
retaliation for "armed incursions" by
Vietnam over the past year.
A quick strike followed by with
drawal would be similar to China's
1962 action in northeast India, when
China invaded to make its point in a
border dispute, then pulled back.
The official Chinese news agency
Hsinhua has carried little about the
invasion and no detailed reports of
the fighting. Japanese news reports
from Peking said China banned all
demonstrations concerning the war.
Reports discounted
Bangkok sorces discounted re
ports of continued Chinese air
strikes deep into Vietnam. Thai intel
ligence said the only Chinese planes
still involved were spotter planes di
recting Chinese artillery fire.
A dispute between China and Vie
tnam has simmered since the com
munists took over Vietnam in 1975. It
has increased over the past year with

China accusing Vietnam of mistreat
ing ethnic Chinese, and with Viet
nam's backing of the overthrow of
the China-backed Cambodian gov
ernment of Pol Pot.
Sunday, Moscow warned China to
withdraw its troops "before it is too
late" and said it would honor a peace
and friendship treaty signed last
November with Vietnam.
No troops
Moscow indicated it would not
send troops, however, saying, "The
heroic Vietnamese people...are cap
able of standing up for themselves
this time again."
The Soviet statement, which came
amid a barrage of anti-Chinese prop
aganda, demonstrations outside the
Chinese Embassy and rallies at insti
tutes and factories around the coun

try, said the Soviet Union will "honor
its treaty obligations" with Vietnam.
'Hands off Vietnam'
As a rallying cry, the Kremlin has
brought out an American protest
slogan from the days of U.S. in
volvement in Southeast Asia;
"Hands off Vietnam."
It was a statement the Kremlin had
to make, just three-and-a-half
months after signing a "treaty of
friendship and cooperation" with
Vietnam. It went no further than the
wording of the treaty, which pro
vides only that "in case either party is
attacked or threatened with attack,
the two parties...shall immediately
consult each other."
The treaty does not bind the two
sides to military aid, and the Soviets
offered none.
