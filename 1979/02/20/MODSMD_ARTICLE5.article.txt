# Profs discuss impact of Chinese invasion

Professors here had mixed reac
tions to China's invasion of Vietnam.
Anthropology Prof. Robert Textor,
who spent six years in Southeast
Asia, termed the Chinese move "very
unfortunate and unwise."
Textor's comment was based on
his belief that the significance of the
invasion of Vietnam is the impact it
will have on normalization of rela
tions between the United States and
China.
The attack indicates a "failure to
understand how the American politi
cal system works," Textor said. Al
though normalization has begun, a
great deal more must happen before
the process is complete.
He pointed to the money which
Congress must appropriate in order
to continue normalization. "One
must separate momentum in the
executive branch and the legislative
branch," he said.
Chinese underestimated
Textor said he thought it was pos
sible that the Chinese leaders might
have underestimated the degree to
which the normalization has support
within the government.
"This could jeopardize normaliza
tion," Textor said. To certain
senators, it raises the question of
China's inclination to use force, an
issue especially pertinent when con
sidering the position of Taiwan, he
said.
Textor said all the years of prepara
tion which went into normalization
could be wasted, if Congress were to
begin limiting Carter's power to act
on normalization, a prospect he con
sidered likely. "This (theattack) gives
the right wing the chance to join the
center," he said.
Textor added that "the Chinese
leaders are not impulsive." He said it
was not as if they had decided to at
tack Vietnam after Chinese Vice
Premier Teng Hsiao Ping returned
from his U.S. visit.
Planning to invade
Textor stressed that Teng had told
Carter during his stay in Washington,
D.C. that China was planning to take
action against Vietnam. Teng re
peated this announcement in Japan a
few days later.
Textor said "I don't doubt that the
Chinese showed foresight in acting
as they did. But it does seem that the

quality of their foresight was a little
myopic."
Peking's actions, Textorsaid, seem
to stem from its fear of the Soviet
Union. "Everything is second to the
threat" of encirclement by Vietnam
and the Soviet Union, Textor said. In
this context, he said, it seems plausi
ble that the Chinese action was a re
sponse to the loss of Cambodia, a
counterbalancing force against
Soviet power which China consi
dered critical.
Threat to normalization
History Prof. Mark Mancall and
Law Prof. Victor Li disagreed with
Textor over the threat the Chinese
invasion may pose to normalization,
but both agreed that Peking's
reasons for attacking seemed clear in
light of the halt to the fighting.
Mancall compared the Vietnam
conflict to China's invasion of India
in 1962. At that time China invaded
northeast India in a border dispute
and then pulled out.
Mancall said the Chinese, as in
1962, have very specific goals in
mind. He said he sees China as hav
ing "clear goals — achieving them —
and then stopping." Mancall added
that he thought China has a "very
conservative foreign policy."
He added that he was sure the in
vasion was directly related to the
downfall of the Chinese-backed re
gime in Cambodia. Former Premier
Pol Pot's regime, which Mancall
labeled "obscene," enjoyed China's
support mainly because "the Soviets
were supporting Vietnam."
Truth to Peking's claims?
Li, a specialist in international
studies, agreed with both Mancall
and Textor on the issue of Peking's
intentions, although he stressed that
there is no way for us to know how
much truth there is to Peking's claims
of Vietnamese incursions into
Chinese territory.
"We know that prior to the attack
(of Cambodia by Vietnam) that there
was some support for Cambodia,"
but the extent of this support is un
known, Li said. However, Li ques
tioned China's methods.
He suggested that there may have
been alternatives to the use of force,
such as bringing the Cambodian
issue to the international scene or
increasing the level of military sup-
port to Cambodia.
Both Mancall and Li said they
thought the move could only worsen
Sino-Soviet relations. But Mancall
added that "relations (between
China and the Soviet Union) are so
bad I don't think they could be any
worse than they are."
Upper hand
What the invasion really shows,
according to Mancall, is that "the
Chinese have the upper hand" in its
dealings with the United States.
"At the very least, the Chinese ac
tion will embarrass Mr. Carter,"
Mancall said. He called Carter's pol
icy a "failure." He said U.S. foreign
policy is "rudderless," comparing
the United States to "a giant crab,
moving sideways."
The Soviets, however, became
more stubborn and "dug their heels
in," said Mancall. "The Soviet Union
is not a little dog that whines and
begs ... it is a major superpower
with military strength equal to or
greater than our own."
Mancall said he considered the
Chinese move to have been "very
carefully calculated." He said he
thought the invasion would not do
much to slow down normalization.
