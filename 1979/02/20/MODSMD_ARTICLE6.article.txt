# Davis urges fight against racism, sexism
## 
### Robert Reed 
The forces against racism and
sexism must be united, according
to noted civil and women's rights
leader, Angela Davis, who spoke
here yesterday.
Davis, speaking before a crowd
of about 150 at the Bechtel Inter
national Center, said, "It is im
possible to struggle for the wo
men's liberation movement with
out also waging a fight for women
of color."
Davis explained that "racism
and sexism always complement
each other (and) always nourish
each other." She concluded that
the fight against one would always
aid in the fight against the other.
Movements intertwined
Davis, now a professor at San
Francisco State, said that though
the civil rights movement and the
women's rights movement may
have different problems and is
sues, they are "nonetheless in
tertwined."
"Racism has a tendency to es
tablish criteria for other crimes of
oppression — sexism included,"
said Davis at a press conference
earlier. "Wherever and whenever

racism becomes more intensified,
sexism follows right on its heels."
Davis cited the Bakke decision
as an example. She said that after
the decision "repercussions were
immediately felt by women."
Davis said many organizations
then began using the "reverse
discrimination" tactic of Bakke to
try to take away what little gains
women have made in the past.
Davis explained that the impos
sibility of separating the civil
rights movement from the
feminist movement could best be
seen through the situation of the
black woman.
"It is difficult, if not impossible,
for a black woman to separate the
fact that she's black from the fact
that she's a woman," said Davis.
Involved from beginning
Davis also called attention to
the fact that black women have
been involved in women's rights
issues from the movement's very
beginnings.
"One of the problems is that we
have not recognized the contribu
tions of women of color," said
Davis. "If we look throughout the
history of this country, we see that

black women in particular have
made enormous contributions to
the struggle for women's rights,
but have made these contribu
tions as black women, not just as
women abstract," she said.
Davis said that the first woman
ever to argue before the Supreme
Court ana the first woman ever to
speak before a mixed public audi
ence were both black. She also
hailed the work of the noted black
leader of the 1800s, Sojourner
Truth, in getting the first women's
movement off the ground.
Davis said, however, that after
the Civil War, the civil rights
movement and the women's
rights movement suffered a "fatal
split." Davis said that because of
this split, which was caused by a
shifting of emphasis in the wo
men's movement, the feminists
"became vulnerable to the penet
ration of racism into their own
lives." .. . -j.
But, Davis said, the new we*
men's liberation movement w»
sparked, much like its predeces
sor, by the civil rights movement
of the '60s.

Davis stressed that, "our most
important task is forging unity.
We're all going to have to get to
gether, or we're going to get pul
led down together."
Davis called debates over
whether the women's liberation
movement or the civil rights
movement is more important
"absurd." She said that women
are more than just women and
that blacks are more than just
blacks.
