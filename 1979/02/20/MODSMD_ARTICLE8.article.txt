# Little-known diseases cause female sterility
## 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — Three little
known venereal diseases often
unreported by public health
agencies are becoming a major
health problem, and one of
them causes sterility in wo
men, the National Center for
Disease Control warned yes
terday.
There are eight venereal dis
eases, of which gonorrhea and
syphilis are by far the best
known. They and three others
— chancroid, lymphog
ranuloma venereum and
granuloma inguinale — must
be reported in most states.
But the remaining three
need not be reported, and as a
result "most people do not
realize that it is a sexually
transmitted disease," said Dr.
Paul Wiesner, director of the
CDC's VD Control Division.
Nor, he said, do they tdke the
antibiotic tetracycline, which
can treat venereal disease.
Of the three little-known
diseases, nongonococcal
urethritis and herpes, are the
most serious Wiesner said.
The third, trichomoniasis, is
mostly uncomfortable, he ad
ded.
Infections from non
gonococcal urethritis that are
occurring now, Wiesner said,
"are creating new groups of
women who will be sterile the

rest of their lives.
"What we are looking at now
are the larger numbers in the
1980s who will be robbed of the
chance of motherhood be
cause of these infections," he
said. "The test-tube baby will
be their only solution.
"Nongonococcal urethritis
affects men the same way the
gonorrhea does, except that it
is caused by a different bacteria
— chlamydia," Wiesner said.
That bacteria, he said, "is the
most common cause of eye in
fection in newborn babies, and
it is the most common cause of
pneumonia in infants."
Wiesner said herpes is seri
ous because it is associated
with cancer of the mouth of the
womb. "Occasionally, it is
transferred to the infant," he
said.
The CDC gave the following
averages tor each 100 cases of
VD among men (nongonococ
cal urethritis and herpes) —
New Haven 29.5 and 2.7; De
troit 25.1 and 0.1; Minneapolis
24.6 and 4.3; Denver 27.6 and
3.0; Atlanta 24.4 and 7.3;
Lexington 4.2 and 1.7.
The following averages were
for 100 cases among women
(herpes and trichomoniasis) —
New Haven 1.9 and 8.7; Detroit
none and 25.3; Minneapolis
2.5 and 8.5; Denver2.l and 9.4.
