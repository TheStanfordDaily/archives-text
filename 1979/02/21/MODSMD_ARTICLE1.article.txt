# Area Iranian students face shortage of funds lately

Iranian students here are having
severe problems paying their bills
and living expenses because they
have not been receiving their scho
larship payments from the Iranian
government, according to Mitch
Hall, foreign student advisor at
Bechtel International Center.
Hall said that many of the 111 Ira
nian students at the University have
been coming to him over the past
few months seeking authorization to
hold part-time jobs as foreign stu
dents.
"This situation has been more dif
ficult lately because of Attorney
General Griffin Bell's crackdown on
foreign students," said Hall. "Out
side employment is one of the areas
that the Immigration and Naturaliza
tin Service(lNS) wants to watch more
closely."
Worsening
Hassan Peerhossaini, an Iranian
student here, said the situation for
the Iranian students is worsening.
"At least 90 percent of all the Iranian
students here are on scholarship
from Iran and we simply can't pay our
bills," he said. "My insurance has
been cancelled, and I haven't been
able to pay my rent for two months.
But I am lucky; my landlady has al
lowed me to stay on even though I
know she needs the money."
Motjabe Mahzoon, of the Iranian
Consulate Office in San Francisco,
said that he had no information
about when the money would start
coming in from Iran again. "The
banks opened last Saturday," Mah
zoon said, "and much of the busi
ness sector is back to normal. We
hope this indicates that the money
will start coming in again very soon."
Unwillingness
Peerhossaini said that the problem
has been created by the unwilling
ness of the Iranian government
under the shah and former Prime
Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar to send
any money to the students for the
past five months. He said that he
suspects that the former govern
ment's failure to send money was
due mostly to corruption and disor
der. "The banks have been on strike;
there has been no postal service for
three months, and our only means of
communication has been by tele
phone," he said.
Peerhossaini said that most of the
normal methods to get money are
unavailable. "It's really too late to get
a job," he said. "Most are gone by
now and you need permission from
the INS anyway and that takes a
month or more."
Many other students have applied
to the University for positions as re
search assistants. Peerhossaini said
that they used to be refusd these pos
itions because of their scholarships
from Iran but that reason is no longer
valid.
Until the Iranian government or
the University provide some funds to
the Iranian students, they will have to
go on skimping on expenses and
leaving debts unpaid. And until
those funds come in, Peerhossaini
said, Iranian students will concern
themselves with "how to get enough
money to live from day to day."
