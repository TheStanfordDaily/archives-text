# Artist displays his work on the walls of downtown Palo Alto
## 
### Dean Eyre 
"I'm not a painter. I'm more
of an entertainer who utilizes a
brush,"said Greg Brown, a
Palo Alto artist.
Brown, a true street artist, is
the creator of nine stationary
residents of Palo Alto's
downtown area. Among his
works on University Ave. are a
garbage man with a space crea
ture peering out from the trash
can, a pair of cat burglars, a spy
and a man pushing a cat in a
baby stroller.
Except for a few years in San
Francisco and London, Brown,

-27, has lived on the lower
Peninsula all his life. Presently
he makes his home in Moun
tain View with his wife Julie and
his son Buster who is almost 2
years old.
Some of Brown's works
adorn his living room, an invit
ing array of moods and
media-airbrush canvases, wax
sculptures, unique record jac
kets and acrylic and oil paint
ings. Eye-catching forms adorn
other rooms including doodl
ings of cartoon figures, giant
blue jeans, and a chesire cat.
Brown's style of art ranges

from realism to the type of sur
realism found in Monty
Python's Flying Circus. A basic
characteristic of all his works is
entertainment.
Wry humor
Brown's wry sense of humor
emerges as a constant
trademark in both his personal
ity and his artwork. When
asked about his background,
he quickly replied, "I don't
have one." While his formal
training consists of only a few
years of off-and-on study dur
ing his early teens, Brown's ex
perience began with cartoon

ing at the age of six.
After discontinuing his for
mal lessons with artist Robert
Lupetti, "because I couldn't
stand the bus ride from Palo
Alto to Burlingame," Brown
joined the Comprehensive
Employment and Training Act
(CETA) program in April 1976.
"There are a lot of CETA posi
tions in L.A. and San Francisco
that are involved in performing
arts and muralists," he
said."But for the most part, the
art positions are in staff
museums and cultural centers.

"I have conflicting feelings
about these CETA jobs because
I like the idea of sponsoring
and supporting the arts. But at
the same time, you're getting a
lot of murals that, had they
gone through a 'jury selection'
would never have gone up.
CETA program
The concept behind CETA,
according to Brown, is that by
providing job training to un
employed people,, they ac
quire the skills to seek full-time
jobs. City art "should be done
project-by-project because the
site dictates what should really
go there," he explained. Such
a review process would stress
"appropriate" art and would
screen out projects that mean
nothing for a specific location.
After doing "a lot of
bureaucratic projects like
coming up with sites on city
owned property that needed
public art," Brown was com
missioned for his first mural —
at a skating rink.
The origin of Brown's most
visible Peninsula project, the
murals in Palo Alto, came when
plans for painting a three-story
building fell through.
Spy character
"The building's owners got
an offer on the building and
didn't want to screw around
with it,"he said. "I was basi
cally sitting around cooling my
heels when I drew the little spy
character and decided to go
out and see if I could find
somebody to let me put it up."
"A city council member
was frightened by the spy and
there was talk about painting it
out," Brown said. "I quickly
did another one which was a
crowd pleaser — the man
pushing a cat in a stroller —
and then I thought 'Hell, I
might as well keep going.'
"After the second one,
there really wasn't much talk
from anybody in the city of
fices. By the third and fourth
ones people realized it was an
on-going thing. I wasn't seen
as a vandal."

Brown's future projects do not
include gallery exhibits.
"Frames around paintings are
like cages," he said. Brown is
currently working on murals
for private homes in Beverly
Hills, designing the decor for a
Concord nightclub, brighten
ing a corporate jet and a factory
in Hayward, and working with
an architect on a nautilus
shaped, solar-powered house
in New Mexico. Long range
plans include a private show
ing of "large environmental
screens," essentially three
dimensional murals.
Describing his most recent
enterprises, Brown explained,
"I let my fantasies pour out a
lot. I like it, it's a lot of fun. It's
more fun than standing in a
hole of a studio constantly try

ing to come up with ideas, play
ing the artiste."
"For the past two years I've
been going on the assumption
that everything that's happen
ing is too good and that I'll go
back to living in the gutter and
sipping Cup-a-Soup. I've fi
nally come to the conclusion
that I'm pretty well estab
lished, so I'll try to slow down
and do more than just work."
Brown has paid his dues to
attain his professional recogni
tion, but the trials of the past
have prepared him for the un
certainties ahead.
"I think that if somebody re
ally wants to do art, the natural
sifting process which occurs is
a good one. If you're dedicated
and have something to offer,
then you'll go someplace."
