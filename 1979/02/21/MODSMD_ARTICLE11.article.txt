# Shipyard worker keeps list of cancer deaths
## 
### 
Kittery, Maine (AP) — Roland
Belhumeur keeps a list of his
friends, Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard workers who have
died. Once a single page, the
grisly catalogue now overflows
several folders of death certifi
cates, autopsy reports, radia
tion data. There are 40 names.
"The government boasts
about its staff studies and in
terim reports and says the
Portsmouth problem is under
control. Well, I can show them
a bunch of new widows, father
less kids and men being eaten
away by cancer who don't ag
ree," says Belhumeur.

Portsmouth is where
Belhumeur worked 20 years
ago, overhauling the atomic
submarine Nautilus and other
vessels in the infancy of the
Navy's nuclear reactor prog
ram. The government is inves
tigating whether radiation
induced cancer is causing the
deaths.
But the probe moves
slowly — and meanwhile, in
homes near the shipyard, more
workers have died. Others suf
fer, knowing they too have
cancer. Even more people live
in fear they may be next.
Throughout, the Navy has

said exposure records indicate
the radiation workers received
was considered well within
safe limits.
Still, Belhumeur keeps his list.
He worked in the yard from
World War II until the 19705.
He was a state legislator briefly,
and now is service officer for
the Disabled American Vete
rans in New Hampshire. He
says he has traced 400 men he
worked with, and is concen
trating on some 75 who were in
his unit of welders and laborers
20 years ago.
Most of the 40 now dead, he
says, were among the 75 in that

unit.
Belhumeur started his list
after Dr. Thomas Najarian, a
Boston hematologist, said in
1977 that nuclear workers at
Portsmouth were contracting
leukemia at a rate six times
higher than non-nuclear work
ers. Belhumeur says he wasn't
surprised.
"I knew something was kil
ling the men,"Belhumeur says.
"Each year men who had
worked with me on the
Nautilus — men only 45 or 50
years old — were dying one after
another.
"I'm not a doctor or a scien
tist but it didn't take genius to
figure out something was
wrong. So I started keeping
a list of my friends and other
shipyard workers who died,
when and why "
Roland Cloutier was the
latest entry. A year ago, he filed
a compensation claim against
the federal government, saying
his cancer was due to long
term exposure to low-level
radiation. But the 51-year-old
welder was pessimistic.
"I doubt if I'll ever live to see
the money," he said. "If they
approve my claim, they'll be
admitting that radiation has kil
led or is killing thousands of
men all over the country."
Cloutier died three weeks
ago. "We still haven't heard
from the government," his
widow told The Associated
Press.
Bitterness and anxiety are
common among such families.
But at the shipyard, on an is
land between Maine and New
Hampshire in the Piscataqua
River fear is more prevalent.
There is some fear of radiation.
But the more evident fear is
unemployment.

Much of coastal Maine and
New Hampshire depends on
the unstable tourist trade. By
contrast, the Navy says the
7,800 shipyard workers earn a
total of $120 million a year - an
average $15,000 per worker.
At the Back-Aft Tavern near
the main shipyard gate, work
ers boast of not being afraid to
step over the red warning lines
that criss-cross the yard, denot
ing radiation work areas. But
some also admit doubts.
"It's the old timers - the men
who worked on the subs when
the nuke program was just
starting who are dying," a 28-
year-old electrician said. "The
safety regulations are much
tougher now."
A 36-year-old who has
worked at the yard 15 years dis
agreed: "Who really knows
how safe the radiation stan
dards are today? It's really a
moot point. Even if they decided
to lower the exposure levels
today it would be too late for
most of us.
Dozens of workers were in
terviewed. Not one said he
would leave his job even if
dangers were proved.
And if the questions raised at
Portsmouth have spread
doubts among workers at the
eight other nuclear shipyards
across the country, most re
main silent. Safety procedures
are tighter now than in
Nautilus days. Workers carry
better monitoring devices.
More lab tests are used to
gauge exposure levels. "
But a federal study is still two
years away from conclusive
findings.

"I knew something was kil
ling the men,"Belhumeur says.
"Each year men who had
worked with me on the
Nautilus — men only 45 or 50
years old — were dying one after
another.
"I'm not a doctor or a scien
tist but it didn't take genius to

shipyard workers who died,

Roland Cloutier was the
latest entry. A year ago, he filed
a compensation claim against
the federal government, saying
his cancer was due to long
term exposure to low-level
radiation. But the 51-year-old
welder was pessimistic.
"I doubt if I'll ever live to see
the money," he said. "If they
approve my claim, they'll be
admitting that radiation has kil
led or is killing thousands of
men all over the country."
Cloutier died three weeks
ago. "We still haven't heard
from the government," his
widow told The Associated
Press.
Bitterness and anxiety are
common among such families.
But at the shipyard, on an is
land between Maine and New
Hampshire in the Piscataqua
River fear is more prevalent.
There is some fear of radiation.
But the more evident fear is
unemployment.

Much of coastal Maine and
New Hampshire depends on
the unstable tourist trade. By
contrast, the Navy says the
7,800 shipyard workers earn a
total of $120 million a year - an
average $15,000 per worker.
At the Back-Aft Tavern near
the main shipyard gate, work
ers boast of not being afraid to
step over the red warning lines
that criss-cross the yard, denot
ing radiation work areas. But
some also admit doubts.
"It's the old timers - the men
who worked on the subs when
the nuke program was just
starting who are dying," a 28-
year-old electrician said. "The
safety regulations are much
tougher now."
A 36-year-old who has
worked at the yard 15 years dis
agreed: "Who really knows
how safe the radiation stan
dards are today? It's really a
moot point. Even if they decided
to lower the exposure levels
today it would be too late for
most of us.
Dozens of workers were in
terviewed. Not one said he
would leave his job even if
dangers were proved.
And if the questions raised at
Portsmouth have spread
doubts among workers at the
eight other nuclear shipyards
across the country, most re
main silent. Safety procedures
are tighter now than in
Nautilus days. Workers carry
better monitoring devices.
More lab tests are used to
gauge exposure levels. "
But a federal study is still two
years away from conclusive
findings.
Kittery, Maine (AP) — Roland
Belhumeur keeps a list of his
friends, Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard workers who have
died. Once a single page, the
grisly catalogue now overflows
several folders of death certifi
cates, autopsy reports, radia
tion data. There are 40 names.
"The government boasts
about its staff studies and in
terim reports and says the
Portsmouth problem is under
control. Well, I can show them
a bunch of new widows, father
less kids and men being eaten
away by cancer who don't ag
ree," says Belhumeur.

Portsmouth is where
Belhumeur worked 20 years
ago, overhauling the atomic
submarine Nautilus and other
vessels in the infancy of the
Navy's nuclear reactor prog
ram. The government is inves
tigating whether radiation
induced cancer is causing the
deaths.
But the probe moves
slowly — and meanwhile, in
homes near the shipyard, more
workers have died. Others suf
fer, knowing they too have
cancer. Even more people live
in fear they may be next.
Throughout, the Navy has

said exposure records indicate
the radiation workers received
was considered well within
safe limits.
Still, Belhumeur keeps his list.
He worked in the yard from
World War II until the 19705.
He was a state legislator briefly,
and now is service officer for
the Disabled American Vete
rans in New Hampshire. He
says he has traced 400 men he
worked with, and is concen
trating on some 75 who were in
his unit of welders and laborers
20 years ago.
Most of the 40 now dead, he
says, were among the 75 in that

unit.
Belhumeur started his list
after Dr. Thomas Najarian, a
Boston hematologist, said in
1977 that nuclear workers at
Portsmouth were contracting
leukemia at a rate six times
higher than non-nuclear work
ers. Belhumeur says he wasn't
surprised.
