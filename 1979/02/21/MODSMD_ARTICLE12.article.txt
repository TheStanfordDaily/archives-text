## 
### 
Bradenton, Fla. (AP) — A white-haired profes
sor with a 50-year teaching career at stake faced
his superiors recently to explain why he
shouldn't be fired for hypnotizing students after
he was ordered not to.
Arlie liniks, an engineering teacher, says he
used hypnosis to improve his students' grades.
Last week he sat on an auditorium stage at Man
atee junior College in this quiet Gulf coast city
facing a five-member Board of Trustees who will
decide his fate.
Applause
More than 100 people attended the hearing,
many of them students applauding the profes
sor until they were quieted by presiding trustee
)ohn Blue.
The school claims Lincks was grossly insubor
dinate for persistently practicing hypnosis dur
ing the last seven years despite warnings and
disciplinary action. School President Wilson
Wetzler, saying hypnosis shouldn't be taught by
unqualified persons, wants Lincks fired.
Did acts
Lincks, who has a master's degree in educa
tion, doesn't deny his actions but maintains that

the orders to stop came only from Wetzler and
were not policy because the trustees hadn't
acted. He says he's studied psychology so as to
be fully qualified as a hypnotist.
"There isn't any college policy. There never
has been and only will be if you decide to make
one," Lincks' attorney, Don Hadsock told the
board.
Floyd Price, Wetzler's attorney, disagreed.
"Evidence will show there was never a doubt in
Mr. Lincks' mind that he was not to use de
monstrations of hypnosis on campus," he told
the board.
"We think the question is simply whether he
is guilty of gross insubordination and if so we
ask for his dismissal . . . despite whether he's a
lovable professor and whether he does a good
job," Price said.
Hypnotists are not licensed by the state but
anyone who performs hypnosis must work
either for a physician or dentist or under their
supervision, said Dr. George Palmer, executive
director of the Florida Board of Medical Examin
ers.
