## Laura Carlsen Feminists misrepresented

To define "feminism" today we have to penet
rate a myriad of myths, misconceptions and
downright lies. Many of these originated in the
press, which has adorned the modern re
surgence of the feminist movement with apoc
ryphal images of bra-burners and overaggres
sive paranoids.
This effort to discredit the women's move
ment by making it appear petty or dictatorial is
certainly nothing new. Caricatures ridiculing
"man-like" women in bloomers and suffraget
tes filled the pages of the newspapers of their
times.
By far the most regrettable consequence of
media misrepresentation is its effect on women
themselves. "Feminism" becomes a buzzword
connoting a slew of socially unacceptable im
ages. We must therefore begin to define
feminism by separating myth from fact.
"I'm not a feminist because I'm glad I was
born a woman." The assumption here is that
feminists decry womanhood itself. The speaker
interprets a feminist analysis of woman as a
human being stripped by society of certain
capacities traditionally ascribed to males. Thus,
woman seems incomplete in terms of what is
really important in society.
Clearly this belief reflects male criteria for
evaluation. Feminists do not see women as his
torically less than men. We recognize the roles
women have played throughout history and the
contributions of their various talents and ener
gies. But we also wonder why women should be
limited to these roles and why, in history, art or
literary criticism, their contributions have been
deemed secondary.
Another misconception is that "all feminists
are lesbians." An age-old ploy for delegitimizing
assertive women has been to call them lesbians.
First, this statement rests on a prejudice which

oppresses people. In fact, the oppression of gay
people and the oppression of women have
much the same source. True, some feminists are
lesbians. So are some telephone operators,
some school teachers and some lawyers.
Nonetheless, heterosexual women should not
feel that there is no place for them in the
feminist movement.
"Feminists hate men." The idea that the sole
basis of feminist solidarity lies in shared anti
male sentiments seems to be an almost "zero
sum" assumption of human relations. If you like
women (as a group), you hate men (as a group).
To gather as sisters offering support, celebrat
ing or commiserating, is often assumed to be an
act inherently hostile toward men. It seems
ridiculous to have to say that supportive rela
tionships with women do not necessarily un
dermine relationships with men.
The one way in which this could be true is if
one finds that spending time with women takes
away time that could be spent with a male lover,
or looking for one. In a society which puts dis
proportional emphasis on romantic love, a more
balanced allocation of time between women
friends and men generally enhances all relation
ships.
Feminists are thought to be man-haters also
because they denounce all aspects of male
supremacy, and men are the agents of male
supremacy. Here we must take care to differen
tiate rejection of ingrained social behavior from
rejection of human beings. Feminists "hate"
sexism, not men. In one sense men are also
victims, for sexism cripples members of both
sexes.
