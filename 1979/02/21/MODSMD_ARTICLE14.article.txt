## Protectionism abused 
### 
Protectionism is an insidious
device by which industries no
longer able to compete in the
international economy make
consumers pay for their ineffi
ciency. It supports industries
which, according to free trade
theory, should cash in their
chips and move to another
game.
The changing international
economic environment alters
what is termed comparative
advantage. Given the rising
costs of labor arid other factors
of production, industries here
can no longer compete effec
tively against countries such as
Taiwan, Hong Kong, South
Korea and Japan in basic pro
ducts such as textiles and steel.
Too many people advocate
and support protectionism
without a clear understanding
of what it is and what it means
to the health of our economy.
Protectionism is simply the es
tablishment of protective trade
barriers, such as tariffs, on im
ported goods which threaten
the market share of domestic
industries.
In order to understand the
adverse tendencies of protec
tionism, an explanation of
what is good about free trade is
called for. Under free trade
each country produces pro
ducts where it has an advan
tage in terms of better
facilities, lower labor, capital
and raw material costs of pro
duction.
For example, a country like
Guatemala specializes in the
production of bananas rather
than computers because its
natural and human resources
are better suited to the produc
tion of bananas; it has an
ample supple of good land and
inexpensive labor.
Japan, on the other hand,
has a comparative advantage in
the production of high
technology goods such as
computers. Its resources — a
highly educated work force and
technological know-how — are
especially suited to such pro
ducts.
According to free trade
theory, each should devote its
resources to what it does best
and not try to preserve its own
industries which are less effi
cient than those of the
foreigner. Free trade assumes
free movement of productive
resources among industries;
this is where the negative as
pects of protectionism come
in.
In a constantly changing
trade environment, various
productive factors shift in rela
tive value as political and
economic forces affect indi
vidual nations. Protectionism
imposes tariffs which push the
price of imports up to the level
of domestic products. This
blocks the natural adjustment
and movement of productive
forces within a country in re
sponse to changes in compara
tive advantage and the costs of
production.
Take the steel industry as an

example. Heavily dependent
on human labor, the American
steel industry faces rising costs
due to labor organization and
rising costs of living. It con
sequently has had to raise
prices in order to meet in
creased costs.
Simultaneously, in countries
such as South Korea and Japan
where wages are lower and
production facilities newer,
steel is produced at a lower
price. When it is exported to
the United States it cuts into
the market share of U.S. pro
ducers.
An unusual alliance of
businessmen and workers
then puts pressure on Con
gress to protect the U.S. pro
ducers from this "unfair"
competition. The Congress
concedes, resulting, in the
short-run, in higher prices for
all steel consumers.
The long-run costs are grea
ter, however. Tariff protection
allows the domestic steel in
dustry to continue to produce
inefficiently, relative to foreign
producers, and prevents capi
tal and labor from adjusting to
new competition. Damages
take the form of political retali
ation in the form of tariffs on
U.S. exports to the affected
country and the undermining
of the productive foundation
of our economy. We produce
products of lesser value than
we could and pay more for
them.
While the arguments against
protectionism are compelling,
the arguments for protec
tionism are more compelling
to Congress which must de
cide whether or not to impose
protectionist measures.
Therein lies the problem.
The situation is especially dif
ficult when viewed in the con
text of removing trade barriers.
The problem is that the be
nefits of removal are diffuse
whereas the costs are
localized.
Costs are limited to the in
dustry and workers affected
and consequently are
screamed about loudly by
those affected. Politicians,
concerned about re-election,
hear only those voices, and
heed them.
Why do the voices scream?
Fear of lost sales, profits and
jobs, results in the unusual co
alition of labor and business
mentioned earlier. What
makes them scream so loud is
that workers and corporations
are not as free to relocate as
free trade theory would have
them be. The prospect of loss
of jobs and homes is likely if
restrictions on steel imports
are suddenly lifted. The power
of those voices is understand
able.
But protectionism can be
used effectively. Recognizing
the political expediency of pro
tectionism, I propose the
gradual removal of trade bar
riers. This would allow pro

tected industries to adjust
slowly to the pressures of
competition and give them an
incentive to move quickly. For
new trade barriers, a definite
time limit and a gradually de
creasing level of protection
would encourage industries to
adjust quickly, butwouldcush
ion the impact of foreign com
petition.
Finally, assistance programs
for those unemployed as a re
sult of competition should be
established. To make freer
trade poltically palatable, it is
necessary to move gradually
and to provide assistance to
those needing it.
