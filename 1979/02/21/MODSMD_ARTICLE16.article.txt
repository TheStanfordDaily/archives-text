## 'Real life' experiments cost lives 
### 
Imagine working in a room where you
frequently feel dizzy or get headaches
from the chemicals you breathe. Some of
the chemicals you work with are known to
be hazardous. Most of them, however,
have simply not been tested.
Unions may not exist where you work,
or may be unable to obtain safer working
conditions. And with a family to support,
you're too dependent on your job to quit.
If you happen to be a lab technician, an
assembly-line worker or a dishwasher in
many areas of industry, or even here, you
might very well be working under such
conditions. The Food and Drug Administ
ration protects us from carcinogens in our
food and drugs, but there is still no sys
tematic screening of chemicals used by
workers in industry, despite cases such as
ethethylene dichloride.
Over 100 billion pounds of this chemical
was produced and used in industry before
it was finally tested and found to be car
cinogenic in the early 1970'5. However, it
was known to be a mutagen as early as
1960.
As of 1976, government standards for
exposure existed for only about 450 of the
myriad of chemicals to which workers are
exposed. This isn't to say that safety stan
dards and monitoring don't exist, but sim
ply that they are inadequate and cannot
compensate for a lack of systematic pre
testing of chemicals to which workers are
exposed. Moreover, the same problems in
occupational health exist for toxic chemi
cals, pathogenic microorganisms, radia
tion and noise as well as for carcinogens.
But carcinogens are a Ã¼biquitous, subtle
and growing danger to industrial workers.
The number and amount of chemicals to
which workers have been exposed has

t
skyrocketted since the 19505. With a typi
cal 20-year lag time, increases in cancer
rates caused by these chemicals can be
expected to start showing up in the 1980s.
A recent federal study has estimated that at
least 20 percent of all cancers, or about
80,000 deaths per year over the next de
cades will be caused by occupational ex
posure, especially to asbestos.
Standards have been set for only 14 car
cinogenic chemicals, though many more
chemicals are known to be carcinogenic in
animals. The issue of occupational expo
sure to carcinogens hits very close to
home. The scientific and industrial in
struments industry and the electrical in
struments industry are, respectively, the
first and third most dangerous for workers
in terms of exposure to carcinogenic sub
stances, according to the National Insti
tute of Occupational Safety and Health.
Both are concentrated in the Mid-
Peninsula area.
Most workers in these industries in the
area have no union to demand a safer
working environment. Workers have re
ported harassment if they complain about
safety conditions. It is difficult to prove
that health problems are job-related.
It is a moral wrong for our society to
tolerate hazardous working conditions for
its workers. Many, if not most, workers are
too dependent on their jobs to leave them
even if they knew about the hazards. And
industry has been notably reluctant to
conform even to the existing government
safety regulations. One company, faced
with the evidence that a substance to
which workers were exposed had detri
mental effects on a fetus, chose to ban
females of childbearing age from work,
rather than change the working condi

tions.
What can be done? Changes must
come, in part at least, through better fed
eral and state legislation in this area. A
minimum step would be to screen all
chemicals to which workers are exposed
before they are exposed, rather than de
pending on current "real life" experi
ments. The 1970 Occupational Health and
Safety Act provides authority for such pre
testing of chemicals. A testing technique
like the Ames test for mutagens could pro
vide a feasible, though minimal, screening
procedure.
Second, the myth of safe levels of expo
sure to carcinogens must be abandoned.
There is no empirical evidence for the exis
tence of such a threshold and several
theoretical reasons to expect that no
threshold exists. Therefore, the goal
should be zero exposure to known or sus
pected carcinogens whenever possible,
rather than the existing "safe" levels of
exposure.
Third, more comprehensive
epidemiological data-gathering and
studies of the impact of chemicals on our
health in general should be undertaken
with government support, and should
examine occupational exposures in par
ticular. This approach is, in fact, being
considered by the California State Legisla
ture.
Finally, workers themselves should be
involved in setting standards of safety for
the environment in which they work. They
have a right to "informed consent" in their
working conditions. Society should rec
ognize and protect this right.
