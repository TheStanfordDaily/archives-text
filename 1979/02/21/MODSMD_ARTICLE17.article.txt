Right-to-die
column old
David Sartoris' column
(Daily, Feb. 16), "Right-to-die
Legislation Needed," is at least
four years out-of-date. Al
though Sartoris presents his
ideas for legislation as if they
were a radical innovation,
California and seven other
states already have enacted
natural death legislation!
Sartoris' suggestions in fact
parallel the present language
of California's Natural Death
Act. He suggests that "termina
tion of life-support systems is
clearly indicated in situations
where, in the opinion of con
sulting medical teams, there is
no hope of useful recovery."
This highly resembles the act's
provision that allows termina
tion of "artificial life-support
procedures" where, in
"reasonable medical judg
ment," death is "imminent."
Sartoris' proposal that a
document "like a will" be
adopted also has been written
into California law already. Pa
tients in California may exe
cute standard written direc
tives, provided witnessing and
other requirements are met.
It is distressing that a third
year medical student can re
main unaware of the fact that
some of the major legal innova
tions he favors have already
occurred. True, the Natural
Death Act does not give a blan
ket "right to die" to patients.
But that is because there are
cases in which patients may not
be in the best position to de
cide on the course of their
treatment.
The act does not give precise
enough definitions to key
terms, like "artificial life
support" and "imminent
death," but one can argue that
no definition would
adequately cover all clinical
cases.
In a sense, Sartoris' failure
to mention the Natural Death
Act betrays a more fundamen
tal problem, which makes
legislation for doctors ex
tremely difficult. Law and

medicine are worlds apart.
Lawyers and legislatures lack
sufficient awareness of doc
tors' ethical dilemmas, and
doctors remain unaware of the
law that purports to govern
them. I suggest that doctors
and lawyers make greater ef
forts to understand each
others' business, particularly
when that business touches
one's own.

ASSU ripoff
If the ASSU thinks that it is
performing a vital function for
students by sending four or
five people to Colorado to tour
breweries, may those people
go with my blessings. And may
the ASSU go without my
money — I want it back.

Government
defined
In three recent columns —
that of Doug Bandow on taxa
tion (Daily, Jan. 25), of Amanda
Nguanu on Israeli and Palesti
nian history (Daily, Feb. 1), and
of Mark Nassutti on the draft
(Daily, Feb. 1), the issue of
what makes a government
legitimate and what its legiti
mate powers are, arises.
Each of these columnists
clearly has ideas of what a gov
ernment is and should do
(which they do not choose to
explicitly share with the read
ers). Yet the consequences of
their definitions lead to practi
cal difficulties.
For instance, Nguanu takes
the implicit position that territ
ory acquired by conquest is
not legitimate. Yet most territ
ory in the world — consider
California, Texas and all the
states of Europe — was at one
time or another acquired by
violent means, against the will
of the then-owners.
Why do governments exist at
all?
I will make a simple claim:

governments are tolerated by
the governed because of the
empirical fact that a group
under unified leadership can,
and eventually will, overcome
a similar group without leader
ship.
Nassutti basically wishes to
convince us that war should
not be an instrument of policy,
short of response to actual in
vasion. Yet many poor nations
who envy U.S. wealth would
hardly hesitate to avail them
selves of some of that wealth
were it clear that there would
be no violent response.
Certainly this is unfortunate,
for war in modern times is a
terrible thing. But it is a fact.
For reasons of external survi
val, we must have a govern
ment in order that we may act
in concert (or some vague re
semblance thereof).
Naturally this criterion ig
nores many of the other func
tions of government sCich as
providing internal order and
social services, but I believe
that it expresses the funda
mental nature of this peculiar
institution. It also enables one
to formulate a very simple de
finition of a legitimate gov
ernment: one whose dictates
are obeyed by most of those it
claims to govern.
Governments are always
"elected," if only because the
people refuse to revolt. Or, to
paraphrase James Clavell's
Shogun: Under what cir
cumstances can revolts against
a legitimate government pos
sibly be justified?
If you win.

Premeds insulted
I'm outraged! I cannot be
lieve the Stanford Daily could
hold such abominable double
standards. On Jan. 29 and 30,
the Daily has consented to run
two Dupie cartoons which, if
you hadn't noticed, ruthlessly
degraded one of America's
finest minorities, premeds.

By your actions I see where
your sentiments lie. Your heart
grows soft to others, but to
premeds you don't even hesi
tate to spread and promote
those evil rumors and jarring
generalizations which cause
people to cringe when they
hear the name "premed."
How can you do this?! With
out premeds, do you know
how much the average C.P.A.
of the school would drop? Do
you know how soon the
bookstore would go bankrupt
with the loss of revenue from
200,000 special premed bin
ders, pens, highlighters, etc?
Whether you believe it or
not, premeds have feelings just
like any other minority group.
If we're dumped on too heav
ily, we can unite and retaliate
just like any other group. So

you'd better stop these har
rassments or else you may re
gret it.
Though all we (premeds)
may not be able to burn our
bras, we can take journalism
classes, and if we did, your
C.P.A.'s would drop like bricks
out of a window.
So don't underestimate the
power of premeds. We, like
any other minority group, have
the power to intimidate, too.
