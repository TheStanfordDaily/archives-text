# Doctor urges relaxation for stress

### Kathy Andrews 
"Science is doomed to dis
cover what everyone knows,"
said University Psychiatry Prof.
William Agras before an audi
ence of 100 people at Tresidder
Union last week. The topic of
his address was "Stress: the
Stanford Hassle."
A former fellow in the Center
for Advanced Studies in the
Behavioral Sciences Program
here, Agras explained that "al
though we've made progress
in stress research over the past
10 years, we're still in the infan
tile stage."
According to Agras, stress is
often engendered by inter
personal relationships. Stress
intensity depends on an indi
vidual's perception of disturb
ing life changes, like illness,
death of a loved one or loss of a
job.

Certain learned lifestyle pat
terns, such as work overcom
mitment, are also conducive to
stress, he continued.
"This type of lifestyle may be
related to coronary disease and
hypertension in humans," said
Agras.
"A conglomerate of things
like genetic predisposition and
diet are also implicated in pro
ducing high stress diseases,"
he added.
Agras emphasized the im
portance of early childhood
experience in coping with
stress later in life.
In the case of students, he
said "it is important to distin
guish between challenge and
stress."
"One must get hyped up in
order to perform," he said.
However, Agras also said
that performance and anxiety

are positively correlated only
up to an optimum level. When
anxiety exceeds that level, per
formance suffers.
Mental attitudes toward re
covery play a major role in the
successful treatment of pa
tients under stress, according
to Agras. Merely signing up for
a treatment program or swal
lowing placebo sugar pills have
caused significant and sus
tained drops in many patients'
blood pressures.
But many people under
stress find it difficult to make
the changes in their lifestyles
necessary to eliminate the
source of their stress. For most
of these people, Agras recom
mended iuch learned relaxa
tion techniques as relaxation
therapy, biofeedback and
meditation.
About two-thirds of these

people can easily learn relaxa
tion therapy techniques like
exercises. These techniques
have proven effective in treat
ing high blood pressure, in
somnia and tension
headaches.
Still others experience diffi
culty in learning relaxation
therapy methods, continued
Agras. The biofeedback
method, which allows a patient
to view his blood pressure
graphed on a screen or to listen
to amplified muscle signals,
has enabled patients to regu
late these functions automati
cally.
Significant drops in blood
pressure have been achieved
by means of some meditation
techniques, Agras said. How
ever, he added, these
techniques are even more
complex than the relaxation
therapy methods.
Agras also said that the per
sonal involvement of an expert
therapist with a patient "is ab
solutely essential" in teaching
techniques like relaxation
therapy. He pointed to studies
that showed instruction from a
therapist to be more effective
than a tape-recorded corres
pondence course.
