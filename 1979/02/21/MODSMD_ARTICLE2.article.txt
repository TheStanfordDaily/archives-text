# Guidelines set up in business dean search
## 
### Samuel Howe 
The chairman of the search committee to find a
successor to Graduate School of Business Dean
Arjay Miller says that while he would like to have
the new dean on board by July 1, when Miller
retires, it is unlikely due to the complexity of the
committee's task.
Business School Prof. Charles Horngren, who
heads the search committee, says that the process
is likely to be a long one because at this time few
possibilities are being ruled out. "Between here
and March 8, we're just gathering suggestions
from a variety of sources," he said.
So far, Horngren said yesterday, the committee
has received in excess of 60 written references for
possible candidates.
Miller announced his resignation Jan. 25. He
came to the Business School in 1969.
Associate Dean Robert Jaedicke will serve as
acting dean from July 1 if a successor to Miller is
not named by that time.
Qualities
The search committee has circulated a tentative
list of qualities to be sought in a new dean.
Among the qualities listed were "high-level
energy and 'drive,' " and intelligence "combined
with 'personal toughness' — not necessarily
academic achievement, but ability to discern and
willingness to maintain very high standards."
In line with these qualities, one of the most
important decisions with which the committee will
be faced is whether to look for a dean with experi
ence in the actual business world, or one with

more of a background in academics.
The last two deans, Miller and Ernest Arbuckle,
both came into the job with little academic experi
ence. Miller had been president of the Ford Motor
Company; Arbuckle had served as executive vice
president of W.R. Grace and Co.
Gathering names
Horngren said that the "committee has not
probed the question in any great depth . . .We're
still gathering names." However, he said that if
faculty opinion seemed to lean strongly either
way, the committee would likely be influenced by
its sentiments.
Several qualities on the checklist deal with the
consideration of ethics in business, and the new
dean will be expected to be sensitive to be sensi
tive the issue.
Under Miller, both the Public Management
Program and a course in "Business and the Chang
ing Environment" have been required of all Busi
ness School students.
Another quality sought will be "willingness to
devote substantial time and energy to financial
aspects of the school," according to the checklist.
Under Miller, the Business School endowment
has risen from $6.4 million to $23.2 million.
' Shake-ups
Horngren likened the dean to "a head coach —
he gets to pick his assistants." There will be
shake-ups in the Business School leadership other
than just in the dean's office, as Assoc. Deans
laedicke and James Van Home seek to return to
teaching at the end of this year, and Assoc. Dean
Samuel ("Pete") Pond (who was acting dean be

fore Miller came in 1969) will retire. However,
Horngren said all three would remain in their posi
tions for another academic year if it is necessary.
Horngren said that the first stages of the search
will involve formulating the criteria for the choos
ing of the new dean and soliciting possible
names from sources such as the Business School
faculty, staff and students, the school's Advisory
Council and deans of other business schools.
The list may reach 100 names, Horngren said.
The committee would like to narrow thi& list to
around eight names by the end of the academic
year if all goes well, he added.
Recommendations
Next, the committee will further narrow the list
to approximately three individuals, with a single
person selected as the committee's choice. All
those recommendations will then be submitted to
President Richard Lyman for his approval.
However, Horngren noted that the committee
will be "very open-minded" about the way that the
search will evolve, and is not constrained by the
process outlined above.
The search committee is made up of Horngren,
Vice Chairman George Bach (who chaired the
committee which brought Miller to the school),
Business School Professors William Miller, David
Montgomery, Jerry Porras, William Sharp, Van
Home and Robert Wilson, and student Ann Marie
Scotney.
Also included are Walter Haas, Jr., a member of
the school's Advisory Council, and Mary Lanigar, a
former council member.

Under Miller, both the Public Management
Program and a course in "Business and the Chang
ing Environment" have been required of all Busi
ness School students.
Another quality sought will be "willingness to
devote substantial time and energy to financial
aspects of the school," according to the checklist.
Under Miller, the Business School endowment
has risen from $6.4 million to $23.2 million.
' Shake-ups
Horngren likened the dean to "a head coach —
he gets to pick his assistants." There will be
shake-ups in the Business School leadership other
than just in the dean's office, as Assoc. Deans
laedicke and James Van Home seek to return to
teaching at the end of this year, and Assoc. Dean
Samuel ("Pete") Pond (who was acting dean be

fore Miller came in 1969) will retire. However,
Horngren said all three would remain in their posi
tions for another academic year if it is necessary.
Horngren said that the first stages of the search
will involve formulating the criteria for the choos
ing of the new dean and soliciting possible
names from sources such as the Business School
faculty, staff and students, the school's Advisory
Council and deans of other business schools.
The list may reach 100 names, Horngren said.
The committee would like to narrow thi& list to
around eight names by the end of the academic
year if all goes well, he added.
Recommendations
Next, the committee will further narrow the list
to approximately three individuals, with a single
person selected as the committee's choice. All
those recommendations will then be submitted to
President Richard Lyman for his approval.
However, Horngren noted that the committee
will be "very open-minded" about the way that the
search will evolve, and is not constrained by the
process outlined above.
The search committee is made up of Horngren,
Vice Chairman George Bach (who chaired the
committee which brought Miller to the school),
Business School Professors William Miller, David
Montgomery, Jerry Porras, William Sharp, Van
Home and Robert Wilson, and student Ann Marie
Scotney.
Also included are Walter Haas, Jr., a member of
the school's Advisory Council, and Mary Lanigar, a
former council member.
The chairman of the search committee to find a
successor to Graduate School of Business Dean
Arjay Miller says that while he would like to have
the new dean on board by July 1, when Miller
retires, it is unlikely due to the complexity of the
committee's task.
Business School Prof. Charles Horngren, who
heads the search committee, says that the process
is likely to be a long one because at this time few
possibilities are being ruled out. "Between here
and March 8, we're just gathering suggestions
from a variety of sources," he said.
So far, Horngren said yesterday, the committee
has received in excess of 60 written references for
possible candidates.
Miller announced his resignation Jan. 25. He
came to the Business School in 1969.
Associate Dean Robert Jaedicke will serve as
acting dean from July 1 if a successor to Miller is
not named by that time.
Qualities
The search committee has circulated a tentative
list of qualities to be sought in a new dean.
Among the qualities listed were "high-level
energy and 'drive,' " and intelligence "combined
with 'personal toughness' — not necessarily
academic achievement, but ability to discern and
willingness to maintain very high standards."
In line with these qualities, one of the most
important decisions with which the committee will
be faced is whether to look for a dean with experi
ence in the actual business world, or one with

more of a background in academics.
The last two deans, Miller and Ernest Arbuckle,
both came into the job with little academic experi
ence. Miller had been president of the Ford Motor
Company; Arbuckle had served as executive vice
president of W.R. Grace and Co.
Gathering names
Horngren said that the "committee has not
probed the question in any great depth . . .We're
still gathering names." However, he said that if
faculty opinion seemed to lean strongly either
way, the committee would likely be influenced by
its sentiments.
Several qualities on the checklist deal with the
consideration of ethics in business, and the new
dean will be expected to be sensitive to be sensi
tive the issue.
Under Miller, both the Public Management
Program and a course in "Business and the Chang
ing Environment" have been required of all Busi
ness School students.
Another quality sought will be "willingness to
devote substantial time and energy to financial
aspects of the school," according to the checklist.
