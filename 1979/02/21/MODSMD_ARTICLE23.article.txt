# From 17 to 70 degrees in three years
## IR major faces growing popularity 
### David Frank 
Three years ago, 17 students graduated
from the University with bachelor's de
grees in International Relations (IR). This
year, over 70 people will graduate with a
degree in this major, according to Emily
Hallim, administrative assistant of the IR
program.
David Kennedy, history professor of his
tory and chairman of the IR program attri
butes IR's growing popularity to "the in
terdisciplinary background it provides,
aquainting a student with political,
economic, and cultural problems." This
background, says Kennedy, leaves the
student a number of options following
graduation that include "going to law or
business school, working for the govern
ment, working fora business that operates
on an international scale, or attending a
graduate IR program at another university."
Says Hallim, "Many of the IR graduates
go directly to law or business school, but
several work on their own for a year or so
to decide which way to go in their
careers."
The impetus for the IR major came from
a 1967 Study of Education at Stanford that
recommended "changes in the structure
of undergraduate education" that would
satisfy "the strong demand for interdiscip
linary, problem-oriented courses."
Professors from several departments re

sponded to this recommendation and
formed a Committee on International Re
lations in 1968 to begin developing the
new program. With grants from the Ford
Foundation and the National Endowment
for the Humanities, the committee de
signed courses tailored for an IR program.
Now, a committee, composed of profes
sors from many academic departments,
oversees the program and makes policy
recommendations.
The object of the IR program is for a
student to study a variety of world prob
lems under three areas: a political/
historical cluster, an economic and
policy-oriented cluster, and a humanities
cluster. The major also requires a foreign
language proficiency equivalent to two
years of university-level training.
"The most common misconception
about the IR major," says Kennedy "is that
it al lows a student to spread out among the
three clusters without any focus. All
majors have to submit a 500-1000 word
proposal that concentrates on a specific
theme such as 'the economic policy of East
European countries,' or 'politics in coun
tries of East Asia.' We have breadth in the
program merely so students can choose
what they need to build a tightly
structured framework for a major."
"Advising in the program is taken very
seriously," says junior Katy Burdick, pres
ident of the International Relations Stu

dent Society. "Each proposal for a major
has to be reviewed by one or more of the
IR faculty."
Burdick also notes that the IR Student
Society meets a few times each quarter to
"get students together since there is a lot
of need to spread information about
courses in this major." The students also
sponsor peer advising sessions during
pre-registration to help newly-declared
majors in their course selection.
"Another strength of our program is the
requirement that students do overseas
study," says Kennedy. Students can
choose from a number of campuses
throughout Europe in addition to ones in
Lima, Peru and Nairobi, Kenya.
Senior Jeff Merkley praises another as
pect of the program — the availability of
funds for student research.
"Dr. Kennedy has encouraged various
banks and foundations to supply funds for
a few honors theses." This encourages
students who want to study a particular
problem in depth to apply for research
grants.
"The IR program has a dedicated group
of faculty," adds Burdick. "Majors have
done amazingly well after graduation in
the job market, and the program is well
respected by graduate schools as well as
government and business. It's bound to
keep growing."

of need to spread information about
courses in this major." The students also
sponsor peer advising sessions during
pre-registration to help newly-declared
majors in their course selection.
"Another strength of our program is the
requirement that students do overseas
study," says Kennedy. Students can
choose from a number of campuses
throughout Europe in addition to ones in
Lima, Peru and Nairobi, Kenya.
Senior Jeff Merkley praises another as
pect of the program — the availability of
funds for student research.
"Dr. Kennedy has encouraged various
banks and foundations to supply funds for
a few honors theses." This encourages
students who want to study a particular
problem in depth to apply for research
grants.
"The IR program has a dedicated group
of faculty," adds Burdick. "Majors have
done amazingly well after graduation in
the job market, and the program is well
respected by graduate schools as well as
government and business. It's bound to
keep growing."
