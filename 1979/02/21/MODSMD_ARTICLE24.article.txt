# Student places in California beauty pageant
## 
### Karen Eustis 
Renee Rolle is a senior
majoring in petroleum en
gineering who missed a
week of classes earlier this
month for a reason her pro
fessors had never heard
before — she was compet
ing in the Miss California
Universe Beauty Pageant in
Los Angeles.
Rolle was third runner
up for the Miss California ti
tle, second runner-up for
the Miss Photogenic title,
and won the Miss Personal
ity and Disco Dancing
awards.
Forty-four women par
ticipated in the contest, rep
resenting various California
cities. Rolle was Miss
Richmond.
"People had a hard time
understanding me when I
told them I was relieved I
didn't win," Rolle said. "It
would have conflicted with
my education and probably
would have been more
trouble than it was worth."
Rolle said she competes
in beauty pageants because
of their opportunities for
scholarship money. She
does not know yet how
much she will be awarded
for this pageant.

Rolle said she entered her
first beauty pageant two
years ago. "It was the scho
larship money that attracted
me. I won $300, enough for
books at least," she said.
Since then, Rolle was first
runner-up in the Miss Wal
nut Creek Pageant, and was
named Miss Diablo Valley
and Miss Richmond. She
plans to enter the Miss Bay
Cities International Pageant
in March.
"The main thing in a
beauty contest is personal
ity," Rolle said. "You have
to have charisma and make
contact with the audience
so when you leave the
stage, they'll remember
you."
Some professional train
ing is necessary to learn
"poise and carriage and
how to walk down a ramp"
Rolle said. In 1977 she took a
modeling course at Grim
me's in San Francisco and
did some professional
modeling "until it inter
fered with Stanford."
Rolle admitted that she
was not a typical contestant,
but emphasized that "if you
were looking for
stereotypes, the girls in the
pageant weren't it."

"Most of them weren't
used to thinking about their
bodies all the time," Rolle
said. "Worrying about look
ing your best and wearing
make-up everyday was
something new for almost
everyone."
She added that most of
the women were 21 or 22
years old and many worked
as models or were aspiring
actresses. "Most of the girls
entered it as a way to further
their careers," Rolle said.
"There was only one girl
who made contests her

career — a professional
pageant-hopper."
"They were very nice
girls," Rolle emphasized, "I
had a wonderful time.
"At first, many of the girls
were taken aback that I was
from Stanford," she said.
"They expected me to recite
formulas every minute and
my roommate told me after
she got to know me that she
had been waiting for me to
take out my chemistry
books and thought Oh no,
there's a genius in our
midst.' "
Rolle said she has not re
ceived many comments
from students here. "Not
many people know about it,
although a few people have
congratulated me," she
said.
The week of the pageant
consisted of a career day,
press meetings, rehearsals,
location filming, and visits
to the sponsors of the con
test, Rolle said. "We were
very well chaperoned. No
men were allowed around
us."
The contestants were
judged in evening gowns,
swim suits and in a "parade
of the cities" competition.
There was also a three

minute personal interview
with the judges.
"You go in, state your
name and the city you rep
resent and your ambition as
fast as you can," Rolle said.
"They just asked me how I
managed to be a senior at 20
and about brothers and sis
ters."
The final evening of com
petition, where the 12
semi-finalists are an
nounced, is televised. "By
that time, everyone's de
cided who they want to
win," Rolle said. "I ex
pected to be one of the 12,
but when I was chosen as
one of the five finalists,
that's when I really began to
get nervous."
The remaining contes
tants are interviewed by the
emcee who, Rolle said, "did
push a bit far with the 'Do
you really want to be a pet
roleum engineer' angle."
The pageant provided a
very different experience
from "being an engineer
and studying all the time,"
Rolle said. "A week of that
was interesting for me. My
midterms did suffer, but it
was worth it. Not every girl
could get the kind of ex
perience I've had."
