# Dead Sea scrolls interpreted at Cal

Berkeley (AP) â€” Christian te
nets of celibate priests and
marriage without divorce may
be traceable to a Jewish sect so
strict its members wouldn't re
lieve themselves on the Sab
bath, a professor involved in
interpreting the last of the
Dead Sea scrolls says.
Dr. Jacob Milgrom of the
University of California said
the 28-foot-long scrolls, found
in the caves at the northern tip
of the Dead Sea, show God
speaking in the first person
about the construction of the
Temple, along with a sect
commentary on the Book of
Deuteronomy.
Milgrom said it was almost
certain that John The Baptist had
contact with the sect in the de
sert and that Jesus may have as
well, providing the link to
Christianity.
"Everything in this last set of
scrolls has something new to
say to us," Milgrom said in an
interview Sunday. "It is totally
unanticipated and when it is
revealed to the scholarly
world, it will baffle them."
The scrolls were written, he
said, by a small sect of several
hundred Jews, who cut them
selves off from the rest of their
religion in the middle of the

second century B.C. by living
in the desert and working in
the town of Qumran.
The sect, believed to be al
lied with the monastic Essenes
of Jerusalem, felt that other
Jews were impure and had de
secrated the Holy City.
"The scrolls show that they
envisioned a constitutional
monarchy in Jerusalem, with a
king bound not only by the To
rah, but by a counsel of 36 with
veto power," Milgrom said.
"The group also believed
that those who wanted to live
in Jerusalem must be celibate
since sex was ritually impure.
And they said that defecation
was impure, so there could be
no toilets in Jerusalem.
"'The toilets had to be lo
cated 3000 cubits from the city,
so I guess we are talking about
a community of joggers. On
the Sabbath, they were not al
lowed to walk more than 2000
cubits so the toilets were off
limits then."
The franslation of the an
cient Hebraic scrolls into mod
ern Hebrew was published
more than a year ago, but the
first English interpretation was
done by Milgrom last month in
the magazine Biblical Ar
cheologist.
