## Shaw presented at full force ENTERTAINMENT 
### 
Perhaps George Bernard Shaw goes too far
when he makes a hero out of Andrew Under
shaft, a munitions manufacturer who be
lieves that "there are two things necessary for
salvation...money and gunpowder." The
Stanford Drama Department's Major Barbara
clearly shows that Shaw actually propounds,
not death, but life without poverty.
The play's action begins when Lady
Britomart Undershaft, who kicked her hus
band out of the house years before, asks An
drew to visit so that she may request large
wedding gifts and annual stipends for their
daughters, Sarah and Barbara, and their
fiances, Charles Lomax and Adolphus Cu
sins, respectively.
Saving souls
Andrew, who preached "immorality while
he practiced morality," returns and im
mediately disrupts the household with his
creed of money and gunpowder, that "Thou
shalt starve ere I starve." Only Barbara, a
majorinthe Salvation Army, remains calm: in
Undershaft, she sees another soul to be
saved. Her fiance, Adolphus, a professor of
Greek and a collector of religions, sees An
drew as a Dionysus, a force of life and death.
While the production holds one's interest
throughout its three hours, Act II strikes
deepest. All the Drama Dept.'s ener
gies mesh during this scene outside the salva
tion Army shelter. It argues more eloquently
than any amount of drawing room discourse.
Sets
John Rathman's rather angular parlor set is
replaced by high, dark brick walls and cold
lighting. Lizabeth Rossi's gray-tinged make
up and Douglas Russell's ragged, deteriorat
ing costumes create a tangible, almost infec
tious destitution.
Even Major Barbara's plain Salvation Army
uniform looks luxurious in comparison to the

filthy scraps her "saved souls" wear. When
her father enters with his cynicism and his
checkbook, he shows her that "it is easy work
converting starving men with a Bible in one
hand and a slice of bread in the other." He
crushes all the myths of poverty as a blessing:
"Such passions (love with disease and suffer
ing) are not virtues, butthe most unnatural of
all vices."
Scorching
Director Robert Lane is to be commended
for presenting the full force of Shaw's scorch
ing social criticisms. He directs the parlor
scenes with a lightness of hand that balances
Act 11, as well as imparts a casual spontaneity
to the Shavian witticisms.
Notable among the generally strong cast,
are Martin Curland's excited, ironic, and
gnomic Adolphus Cusins; Al Melinkoff's
confident and compelling Andrew Under
shaft; Debra Skiriba's tight-lipped and disap
proving Lady Britomart; and Kevin Reidy's
simpering clumsy Charles Lomax.
Complementing
Rathman's lighting and three sets, the
sparse and stern parlor, the dank Salvation
Army shelter, and Andrew's glowing muni
tions works, complement Russell's cos
tumes, which run from the stiff, restrained
elegance of Lady Britomart's evening gown,
to the grimy rags of the poor, to the warm,
oversized tweeds of Adolphus Cusins.
Despite the play's serious theme, you leave
feeling slightly optimistic, with something to
mull over. If you like Shaw, Lane's faithful
direction makes the play well worth your
while. If you've never seen Shaw, this pro
duction will educate as well as entertain you.
And if you dislike Shaw, well, Major Barbara
could quite possibly convert you.
(Major Barbara will play from Feb. 21-24 at 8
p.m. at the Little Theater.)
