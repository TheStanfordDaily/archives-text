## Sensitivity and sensuality 
### 
For Colored Cirls Who Have
Considered Suicide When the
Rainbow is Enuf ls a sometimes
shocking, often moving, pro
foundly revealing portrait of
black women. Ntozake
Shange's "choreopoem"
forcefully, yet delicately, treats
their joys and anguish, particu
larly that arising from confron
tations with their men.
By interweaving the personal
anecdotes of seven black wo
men, sometimes acting alone
and other times in unison,
Shange gives shape to her
complicated group of people.
This technique, a panoply of
mime, dance, and song, pre
sents multiple themes, some of
which are specifically related
to black women, while others
are common to us all.
Two of the more general to
pics include a lighthearted
view of women tired of extend
ing themselves to their men
with no return, and a delightful
mimicking of men apologizing
to women. Subjects unique to
black women include the ex
perience of an anxiety-ridden,
disillusioned black woman just
moved into Harlem. A series of
scenes depict black women as
victims of the oppression and
suffering of black men in a
white society. One of these
portrays with shattering inten
sity a black Vietnam war vete
ran pleading with and finally
bribing his wife to take him
back by threatening to kill their
children.
Message
What seems to be Shange's
central message is revealed in
the statement "to be sorry and
colored is redundant in the
modern world. " Shange would
like black women to quit
apologizing for themselves.
And rather than denying them,
Shange exalts black women's
stereotypic qualities. Shange
praises blacks' sensitivity, sen
suality, theirability to feel: "we
are not impervious to feeling."

hor Colored Cirls defies racist
stereotypes by simply not
being ashamed of them.
Shange delves into the com
plexities of black psychology.
All seven women enact an
exhilarating description of
black love, each one charac
terizing one aspect: "compli
cated, beautiful, delicate, un
forgettable, brown and
spicey." The language itself
depicts the diversity of black
experience. Through
metaphors, the vernacular,

and highly sophisticated and
specific description, Shange
expresses a wide range of feel
ings.
An omission
While it is important to
praise black women's sensitiv
ity and sensuality, Shange neg
lects black women's intellec
tual life, an omission all black
women may not be happy with.
It is difficult to agree with all of
what Shange says. That is as it
should be in a play that addres
ses so much so directly. Yet to

Shange's credit, the dramatic
force of each story always de
mands from us a response and
opinion. This is in part due to
Shange's concept, in part to
exceptional individual perfor
mances and choreography.
There is much a white male
reviewer cannot identify with
in a play about black women.
But that it should have such an
impact on a diverse audience is
a mark both of its dramatic ef
fectiveness and the universal-

ity of its messages.
With a fine sensibility for the
tragic and the comic, Shange
blends an affectionate self
ridicule with penetrating in
sights into black woes. Her
lucid expression of an oppres
sed, but not downtrodden,
group of people is poignant
and compelling. For Colored
Girls is about vulnerable yet re
silient black women, who are
experiencing life's elations and
sorrows in their fullest, most
complete way.
