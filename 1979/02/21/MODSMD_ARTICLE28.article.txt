## Getting nowhere with sex 
### 
Hardcore reaches for the
heart of the matter; instead, it
may end up hitting you in the
stomach. It's an "assault the
audience" movie, but you'll
get over it, and that's decidedly
not what Paul Schrader, the
writer-director, wanted.
Schrader (who wrote Taxi
Driver and wrote and directed
Blue Collar) tries to get big, un
forgettable emotions; that's
where he starts from, and the
launching point here — a Cal
vinist businessman from Grand
Rapids loses his daughter to
California's porno underworld
and goes off to get her back —
would seem to promise loads
of emotional theatrics. And
Hardcore delivers, to some ex
tent; but it doesn't tear you up,
because you can see things
coming from miles away — the
movie throws emotions at you
like roundhouse rights.
Right off, with the peaceful
montage of Grand Rapids
scenes — the snowy streets,
the Thanksgiving dinner, the
grumpy grandfather turning
off the "damn TV" — you know
you're just being lulled, that all
this will just make the contrasts
to come later — L.A. and San
Francisco — more brutal. And
Schrader's doing something
else; he's gently exploiting the
elitist smugness of those who,
like Rex Reed, that master of
trash chic, see Midwesterners
as "lobotomized" because
they choose not to "enjoy" the
"pleasures" of the big city. It's
a wonderfully ignorant elitist
fantasy to believe that the
Midwest is the great place
where people insulate them
selves from "reality" — that
their "coke" comes from bot
tles, not spoons — but if the
snobs would quit running away
they'd see that they're insulat
ing themselves, too — and with
warmer clothing.
Schrader really doesn't en
dorse the elitist view — he
doesn't paint California as such
a beautiful alternative — all
he's trying to do is engineer the
biggest shocks possible. He's
trying to move the audience,
but he goes about it the wrong
way. Schrader thinks too much
— he wants to think for the au
dience too.
That's the problem. A movie
like this one should have its
emotions, not its thoughts, up
front. Schrader never gives us
his guts; all we see is his intel
lect.
Even if the movie, as a whole,
doesn't work, its central per
formance — George C. Scott's
— often does. As the Calvinist
father, Scott strips everything
down to one basic emotion —
his love for his daughter,
something that he's never
been able toshowopenly. It'sa
pent-up and in the end, con
vincing, performance; in a
movie that's hardly quiet,
Scott's characterization is a
welcome bit of understate
ment. Scott doesn't go for big
explosions like Schrader does
(even though the famous Scott
rages do surface from time to
time); he connects on a simple
level, and his character stays
believable throughout.
But when the movie hits the
inner city, Scott is cut down to
size by the distance that
Schrader keeps from the
street. As he goes through
adult book stores, massage
parlors and S & M movie show
ings, Scott's reduced, more

than anything else, to the level
of a voyeur. Schrader never
makes the ugly night world he
films real for us.
And because the movie lacks
emotional drive, its ending
doesn't really resolve much.
Scott plucks his daughter away
from the kiddie pornog
raphers, but are we supposed
to feel happy? Or are we sup
posed to feel sad, because
she's been scarred for life, in
fact, was sufficiently damaged

by her Calvinist upringing,
with its overwhelming guilt
complexes? Are we supposed
to feel anything?
Hardcore shares one basic
value with the pornography it
attempts to deal with. All it
gives us is the product, with
most of what makes it (movies
or sex) worth doing — the feel
ing, and, more importantly,
the depth of feeling, behind it
— left out. The movie gives us
that product: the look, the set

tings are readily familiar;
Schrader gets what he wants
there.
But it's too easy to turn your
eyes away from that, to not pay
attention to it. Schrader's good
enough to get you to want to
know more about the world
and the characters he depicts,
but he's not good enough to
give that extra that stays with
you. To get to the heart of the
matter, you've got to use more
than your mind.

Hardcore, writer-director Paul Schrader's new film, now playing at the Palo Alto Square.
