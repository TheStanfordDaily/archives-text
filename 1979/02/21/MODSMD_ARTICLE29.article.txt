Clash continues in Vietnam
Bangkok, Thailand — Chinese troops captured
the big town of Lao Cai on the northwestern end of
the Vietnamese border yesterday, but the Viet
namese struck back and thousands of Hanoi
troops were reported advancing for a showdown
at Lang Son at the eastern end of the frontier.
The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch from
Hanoi, reported the fall of Lao Cai, 175 miles
northwest of the Vietnamese capital.
Thai intelligence sources in Bangkok said the
Chinese had thrust as far as 10 miles into Vietnam,
four miles beyond their deepest penetration re
ported Monday. Vietnam's U.N. ambassador said
in New York the invaders had advanced 12 miles
into Vietnam.
A correspondent for the big Japanese news
paper Asahi Shimbun reported from Lang Son, 12
miles from the Chinese border that Vietnamese
and Chinese forces were bracing fora major battle
in that area.
"Several thousand men of regular and regional
units with heavy arms are advancing toward
Chinese positions," the correspondent, Kazuhisa
Ikawa, reported. "Trucks are hauling 105-
millimeter guns from Dong Mo, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the border."
"Vietnamese 130-millimeter artillery,
positioned south of here Lang Son is firing toward
China," the report said.
The Japanese correspondent said only military
personnel, security men, government officials and
a few civilians were seen in Lang Son, with other
residents already having been evacuated. He re
ported that Vietnamese officials said the number
of people left was between 12,000 and 13,000 from
a normal population of 46,000.
Hanoi claimed Peking's troops were resorting to
chemical warfare, firing shells filled with "toxic
substances."
Iran executes four generals
Tehran, Iran — The revolutionary government
settled more scores with its enemies yesterday by
executing four more generals of the old regime,
but it faced a fresh challenge from Marxists guerril
las who have called a protest march to demand
more say in how to run Iran.
Iran's foreign ministry officials issued a state
ment yesterday vowing to hound exiled Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi until he can be brought
back to Iran for trial. The Tehran newspaper Et
telaat reported a committee had been formed to
kidnap the monarch, in exile in Morocco.

The four generals were executed by a firing squad
five days after four other generals were shot. The
latest victims of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
revolutionary tribunal included Gen. Parvis Amin
Afshar, the former commander of the shah's elite
Imperial Guard.
But new political trouble loomed for the 78-
year-old ayatollah, leader of the year-long anti
shah rebellion and his provisional government
under Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan.
The People's Fedayeen guerrillas, a Marxist
group that lost hundreds of fighters in years of
struggle against the shah, announced it would or
ganize a protest march tomorrow to dramatize its
demand for more participation in the revolutio
nary regime.
Carter pushes SALT accord
Atlanta — President Jimmy Carter declared yes
terday that the turmoil in Iran and Southeast Asia
demonstrates the need for a new U.S.-Soviet arms
treaty, and vowed he will not let peripheral issues
stand in the way of agreement on the pact.
In a major pitch for the nearly complete strategic
arms limitation treaty, Carter again cautioned the
Russians against meddling in Iran's internal strife
or taking actions that would widen the conflict
between China and Vietnam. However, the presi
dent stressed that he will press for agreement on
the new arms pact — SALT II — despite these
trouble spots.
"It is in our national interest to pursue it even as
we continue competition with the Soviet Union
elsewhere in the world," Carter told a friendly
audience at the Georgia Institute of Technology in
his home state.
Carter repeatedly and strongly rejected de
mands by conservatives for a foreign policy that
would link progress on arms negotiations with the
Soviet Union's conduct around the world.
And he told the audience of some 7000 persons
that the emerging SALT II accord "will make the
world safer and more secure."
Mideast talks to resume today
Washington — Egypt and Israel open another
round of secret peace negotiations today at
snow-covered Camp David, with prospects for
completing a Mideast peace treaty complicated by
recent events in Iran.
On the eve of the talks, Egypt warned Israel that
the "situation in the region is dangerously tense"
and urged the Israelis to realize that a comprehen
sive peace settlement is vital.
The shift of Iran from a somewhat neutral ob

server to an ardent supporter of the Palestinians
and opponent of Israel is likely to make Secretary
of State Cyrus Vance's job even more difficult.
Vance will join Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa
Khalil and Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan at
the presidential retreat today after they stay
overnight in the isolated setting in the Maryland
mountains.
The Palestinian issue is the chief stumbling
block to completing the treaty sketched out at
Camp David last September by President Jimmy
Carter in a summit meeting with Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin.
Egypt wants the treaty linked in clear terms to
self-rule for the 1.1 million Palestinians living on
the Israeli-held West Bank of the Jordan River and
in the Gaza Strip.
Strike threatens Mardi Gras
New Orleans — Sponsors pulled all remaining
Mardi Gras and Carnival parades out of the city
yesterday, saying they would not permit the festi
val to remain the hostage of striking police.
There were plans to move some of the 18 re
maining parades to the suburbs, but the biggest —
including the fanciest ones that wouid have rolled
on Feb. 27, Mardi Gras — appeared doomed un
less the strike is settled.
Mardi Gras is a $50 million industry in New Or
leans. Police union spokesmen have called the
festival "our four aces" in seeking to wring con
cessions from the city.
It was only the seventh time that the parades
have been canceled, and the first time since the
Korean War. A parade organizer said the events
could be rescheduled within 24 hours if the strike
ends.
Dow rises 7.54
New York — Blue chip issues led a rally in the
stock market yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
7.54 to 834.55, in its best single-day showing since
it rose 8.23 on Jan. 25.
Volume remained unimpressive, however. Tur
nover on the Big Board came to 22.01 million
shares, up from 21.11 million last Friday.

Showers decreasing today. Partly cloudy tonight
with a chance of showers, becoming mostly sunny
tomorrow. Lows tonight mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs
