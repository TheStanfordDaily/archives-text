# New TV test to check for eye disorders

An eye test, recently developed
and tested at the University Medical
Center, could be instrumental in
checking for eye disease in large
numbers of people, according to Dr.
A. Ralph Rosenthal, one of the re
searchers involved in the project.
The test, which is conducted on an
ordinary television screen, would
also heighten public awareness of
eye health, Rosenthal says.
Along with Jerry Hopkins, op
thamological associate at the Med
Center, Rosenthal, who is head of
the division of opthamology at the
Medical School, began helping Dr.
Milton Flocks conduct research on
an idea proposed by Flocks two years
ago. Flock is a clinical professor and
practicing physician at the Med
Center.
According to Rosenthal, the visual
screening test, which operates via
television, has been found to be
about 90 percent accurate so far. That
means that 10 percent of the people
who fail the test are normal, and 10
percent of the people who pass the
test actually have eye disease.
Rosenthal emphasized the fact that
the test is not a substitute for an eye
examination. "There is no way," he
said, "that you can have a screening
test be 100 percent accurate. The re
sults we've had have been very en
couraging though."
On cable
Last year QUBE Cable TV in Col
umbus, Ohio, contacted the re
search team to ask if it could try out
the test on subscribers. QUBE is the
only television station in the country
which employs instant computerized
audience response. "We jumped at
the chance to do this," stated Ro
senthal.
Research for the test was funded
by a grant from the National Society
for the Prevention of Blindness. The

test lasts 20 to 30 minutes and con
sists of two parts: visual acuity and
visual field.
During the first of these, the vie
wer stands about 12 feet away from
the television set and is asked to read
rows of letters. He should wear his
glasses or contacts if they are nor
mally worn fordistant vision. Accord
ing to the size of the screen (it must
not be under 12 inches or over 24
inches in order to assure any accu
racy) the viewer is told the stipula
tions for passing and failing the test.
Field test
During the visual field test, the
viewer sits the same distance from
the screen as the diagonal size of the
screen. Eight different patterns are
presented to test peripheral vision.
The viewer must be able to count the
number of dots which flash around a
central "X." Rosenthal commented
that since not all eye diseases or med
ical disorders (such as brain tumors)
affect the central vision first, "we
thought the two tests together would
be better than either one alone."
After examining over 150 voluntary
patients at the University clinic, addi
tional funds were provided for field
testing. Using the Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network through
which classes are taught at various
industries in the Bay Area, more
people were tested. Rosenthal said
that although the doctors wanted to
choose subjects randomly in order to
get a cross section, viewers were
chosen on a voluntary basis after
signing consent forms.
The tests were given for six weeks
during August and September dur
ing the workers' lunch hour. No de
mographics except gender were
taken on these volunteers.
Random
The computer chose names ran
domly after letters and consent
forms were written. Demographics

were compiled anonymously and the
test was administered Feb. 6 and 7 of
this year. Opthalmologists at Ohio
State University are currently doing
clinical exams on willing screen test
volunteers. Although the final statis
tics have not yet been tabulated, Ro
senthal said that "the preliminary re
sults were encouraging. We got a
good cross section of people with
different educational backgrounds,"
he said.
According to Rosenthal, even if the
results are not as good as in previous
studies, the screening test could still
be used with supervision in small
communities. He said he feels that

screening is a "useful mechanism of
increasing public awareness, if no
thing else."
The doctors are ultimately in
terested however, in mass applicabil
ity â€” that is, in screening a lot of
people, especially those over 40, in a
short period of time.
He cited advertising and publicity
as necessary ingredients for the pro
ject's overall success. "There will be
a cost burden on people who fail the
test, see an opthamologist, but are
found to be normal. So people must
buy the concept. We want to make
them aware of their own health and
bodies," said Rosenthal.
