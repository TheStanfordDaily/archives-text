Statement
The Stanford Daily will not send a
reporter with the ASSU Task Force
leaving for Golden, Colorado to in
vestigate Adolph Coors Company's
labor practices, Daily editor Mike
Charlson announced yesterday.
The ASSU Senate authorized the
trip at a lengthy meeting last Thurs
day night. Following that meeting,
Senate Chairperson Peter Stamos ex
tended an invitation to a Daily repor
ter to accompany other task force
members, expenses paid.
Charlson said he made the deci
sion Monday evening and made the
announcement yesterday after in
forming Stamos.
"I was disturbed that Coors West
(the local Coors distributor) was
going to pay for the trip," the editor
said. "There is clearly the possible
charge of conflict of interest there."
But that problem could have been
overcome, he said, by the Daily pay
ing for its reporter's trip.
Charlson said he felt senate and
student time could be better spent
on other issues. "By sending our re
porter to Golden, we contradict our
editorial stand that the issue should
be dropped."
