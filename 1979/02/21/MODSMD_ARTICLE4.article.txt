# Hughes Institute, dean differ on cost
## Med Center addition nixed 
### Seth Zuckerman 
Negotiations concerning the addi
tion of a new wing or building to the
Medical Center here appear to have
fallen through, according to Lawr
ence Crowley, acting dean of the
Medical School.
The Howard Hughes Medical Insti
tute, which supports several resear
chers here, and the Med Center were
not able to agree on the cost of the
proposed facility, he said.
The institute's researchers would
move into the new addition if it were
built.
The institute "doesn't have the re
sources we feel are necessary" to
undertake a project of this mag
nitude, Crowley said. "Nothing is
being considered at the moment."
Nationwide
The institute backs research at 12
medical schools across the country,
including Harvard, Johns Hopkins
and UC-San Francisco. It locates its
researchers, or investigators as they
are called, at major medical schools
so their discoveries will have the
greatest possible impact, Assoc.
Prof, of Medicine Lawrence Kedes,
an investigator here, said. It supports
experiments in three areas — im
munology, genetics, and endoc
rinology.
Late industrialist Howard Hughes
proposed the institute in 1926 but it
did not come into being until 1953.

Until recently, the institute's work
ings were kept secret.
However, in a December article in
The New England Journal of
Medicine, one of the institute's chief
officers publicized its operations for
the first time. Though its scientists
publish their findings in professional
journals, much secrecy still sur
rounds the institute. Its 75 inves
tigators held a closed meeting in
Miami last December, according to
The New York Times.
This is an unusual practice among
scientists, who generally leave their
meetings open to other qualified re
searchers, the Times said.
The institute employs four faculty
members here — Asst. Prof, of En
docrinology and Metabolism David
Feldman, Kedes, Asst. Prof, of On
cology Ron Levy and Assoc. Prof, of
Immunology Samuel Strober. They
all have regular faculty duties as well
as their research commitments to the
institute and their labs are not near
one another.
Concentrate
The institute would like to have its
investigators "more centrally lo
cated," according to Kedes. His
laboratory is in the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital, more than
three miles from the Med Center.
The other scientists the institute
supports are scattered through the
Med Center.

The institute wants to make its
progress "geographically identifi
able" by concentrating its inves
tigators near one another, Levy said.
The problem, is that "building costs
(here) are astronomical compared to
the rest of the country" and the insti
tute thinks "Stanford is out of line" in
the amount of money it is asking for
the new addition, he said.
According to Kedes, the institute
also wanted to lease space in the
Med Center, but the University
turned the institute down because it
"doesn't have any space to rent
them."
No representatives of the institute
were available for comment.
S.F. construction
The institute is planning to finance
an addition to the UC-San Francisco
Medical School. According to a
spokesman for the dean's office
there, many alternatives are still
being considered, but there is "no
thing concrete as yet."
The institute owns Hughes Aircraft
Co., which provided it with $18 mill
ion last year, according to The New
York Times. Its status as an institute
allows it to retain its ownership of the
company. If itwereafoundation, like
most research-sponsoring corpora
tions, it would be required to dis
pose of most of its assets in Hughes
Aircraft and give away 6 percent of its
net worth each year. This legal status
requires that it employ the re
searchers it supports, rather than
provide grants through universities
as most foundations do.
While this is a somewhat unusual
practice, according to Levy, he and
Kedes agreed that the Med Center
stands only to benefit from the ar
rangement. All the institute's resear
chers are also faculty members, so
the Med Center, in effect gets free
professors.
No conflict
"There could conceivably be a
conflict between the way the school
views its faculty and the way H ughes
views its employees," Levy said, "but
neither has pushed the issue. That
potential conflict is no different than
that between government-funded
research time and faculty duties."

Kedes asserted that his affiliation
with the institute has made his re
search "more flexible." The institute
has not tried to define specifically
what research heVnust do, he said.
As with most projects sponsored
by sources outside the Med Center,
the scientists who work in each of the
three fields the institute supports
gather once or twice a year to discuss
the progress they are making and to
share the ideas they have, Levy said.
The only way in which the institute
differs from other medical research
institutes is that its scientists are scat

tered across the country, according
to The New York Times.
This is not too much of a problem,
however, because the institute is
planning to link its 12 centers with an
extensive satellite-based telecom
munications system, according to
The Wall Street Journal. Audio, video
and computer hookups will be pro
vided.
Over half of the investigators' re
search is financed by the Institute,
though they also receive funding
from other sources, Kedes and Levy
said.

Kedes agreed that the Med Center
stands only to benefit from the ar
rangement. All the institute's resear
chers are also faculty members, so
the Med Center, in effect gets free
professors.
No conflict
"There could conceivably be a
conflict between the way the school
views its faculty and the way H ughes
views its employees," Levy said, "but
neither has pushed the issue. That
potential conflict is no different than
that between government-funded
research time and faculty duties."

Kedes asserted that his affiliation
with the institute has made his re
search "more flexible." The institute
has not tried to define specifically
what research heVnust do, he said.
As with most projects sponsored
by sources outside the Med Center,
the scientists who work in each of the
three fields the institute supports
gather once or twice a year to discuss
the progress they are making and to
share the ideas they have, Levy said.
The only way in which the institute
differs from other medical research
institutes is that its scientists are scat

tered across the country, according
to The New York Times.
This is not too much of a problem,
however, because the institute is
planning to link its 12 centers with an
extensive satellite-based telecom
munications system, according to
The Wall Street Journal. Audio, video
and computer hookups will be pro
vided.
Over half of the investigators' re
search is financed by the Institute,
though they also receive funding
from other sources, Kedes and Levy
said.
Negotiations concerning the addi
tion of a new wing or building to the
Medical Center here appear to have
fallen through, according to Lawr
ence Crowley, acting dean of the
Medical School.
The Howard Hughes Medical Insti
tute, which supports several resear
chers here, and the Med Center were
not able to agree on the cost of the
proposed facility, he said.
The institute's researchers would
move into the new addition if it were
built.
The institute "doesn't have the re
sources we feel are necessary" to
undertake a project of this mag
nitude, Crowley said. "Nothing is
being considered at the moment."
Nationwide
The institute backs research at 12
medical schools across the country,
including Harvard, Johns Hopkins
and UC-San Francisco. It locates its
researchers, or investigators as they
are called, at major medical schools
so their discoveries will have the
greatest possible impact, Assoc.
Prof, of Medicine Lawrence Kedes,
an investigator here, said. It supports
experiments in three areas — im
munology, genetics, and endoc
rinology.
Late industrialist Howard Hughes
proposed the institute in 1926 but it
did not come into being until 1953.

Until recently, the institute's work
ings were kept secret.
However, in a December article in
The New England Journal of
Medicine, one of the institute's chief
officers publicized its operations for
the first time. Though its scientists
publish their findings in professional
journals, much secrecy still sur
rounds the institute. Its 75 inves
tigators held a closed meeting in
Miami last December, according to
The New York Times.
This is an unusual practice among
scientists, who generally leave their
meetings open to other qualified re
searchers, the Times said.
The institute employs four faculty
members here — Asst. Prof, of En
docrinology and Metabolism David
Feldman, Kedes, Asst. Prof, of On
cology Ron Levy and Assoc. Prof, of
Immunology Samuel Strober. They
all have regular faculty duties as well
as their research commitments to the
institute and their labs are not near
one another.
Concentrate
The institute would like to have its
investigators "more centrally lo
cated," according to Kedes. His
laboratory is in the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital, more than
three miles from the Med Center.
The other scientists the institute
supports are scattered through the
Med Center.

The institute wants to make its
progress "geographically identifi
able" by concentrating its inves
tigators near one another, Levy said.
The problem, is that "building costs
(here) are astronomical compared to
the rest of the country" and the insti
tute thinks "Stanford is out of line" in
the amount of money it is asking for
the new addition, he said.
According to Kedes, the institute
also wanted to lease space in the
Med Center, but the University
turned the institute down because it
"doesn't have any space to rent
them."
No representatives of the institute
were available for comment.
S.F. construction
The institute is planning to finance
an addition to the UC-San Francisco
Medical School. According to a
spokesman for the dean's office
there, many alternatives are still
being considered, but there is "no
thing concrete as yet."
The institute owns Hughes Aircraft
Co., which provided it with $18 mill
ion last year, according to The New
York Times. Its status as an institute
allows it to retain its ownership of the
company. If itwereafoundation, like
most research-sponsoring corpora
tions, it would be required to dis
pose of most of its assets in Hughes
Aircraft and give away 6 percent of its
net worth each year. This legal status
requires that it employ the re
searchers it supports, rather than
provide grants through universities
as most foundations do.
While this is a somewhat unusual
practice, according to Levy, he and
Kedes agreed that the Med Center
stands only to benefit from the ar
rangement. All the institute's resear
chers are also faculty members, so
