# USE members claim union lacks muscle, has ineffective leadership
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
"We're stuck with USE. The union
seems to be doing its own thing. And
how the hell can the union represent
a cook and a carpenter at the same
time? This union is too diversified.
The only union that could really rep
resent us are the teamsters; the
union has no power."
Mike Munson, a maintenance car
penter for Plant Services, and a
member of United Stanford
Employees (USE) since its inception
in 1973, shared these feelings and
added that many other union mem
bers feel the same way.
1400 of the 5000 University staff
employees (e.g. clerical workers,
maintenance personnel and compu
ter operators) are members of USE.
Last April, a new slate of officers
was elected for the union. In his
campaign, current president Bob
Britton, a computer operator for the

Stanford Center for Information Pro
cessing (SCIP) at Encina Hall, called
for "a new, more pragmatic ap
proach" to union affairs.
Promising "all kinds of cleaning
up," more active recruitment efforts
and reform of the employee grie
vance procedure, Britton and his
running mates hoped to heal the split
with the faction led by Jim Berk, who
was secretary at the time and had
been president, and weld the union
into an effective and unified bargain
ing unit.
Contract negotiations
Since April, according to Britton,
there have been significant changes
in the grievance system and other
areas of the union, but much remains
to be done, especially about the up
coming contract negotiations. New
contract representatives must be
elected and demands must be formu
lated. The present union contract
expires Aug. 30, 1979.
Munson was not impressed with
the union leadership's performance.
He said, "He (Britton) hasn't done
anything much. But the president
doesn't make our union, it's the
people in it that make our union."
Jim Self, a maintenance mechanic
for Service Operations, said "We got
too many non-doers in this union."
Streamlining
According to Britton, much has
been done to streamline the union.
Shop stewards are the inter
mediaries between workers and man
agement in each of tho various
workplaces. Formerly acting only as
advisers to union members, they are
now being trained to handle grie
vances and serve as the main link be
tween the leadership and the rank
and file.
"Everyone knows who their ste
ward is, but hardly anybody knew
who their organizers were. This
simplifies things a lot," Britton said.
However, a janitor who has been
working here for two years in the row
residences knows nothing about the
union. Asked if he knew who the
president of USE was, he said that he
does. But he did not know who his
shop steward was; no one from the
union had ever spoken to him about
the union. "I never had any prob
lems. I'm pretty happy working
here," he said.
Self joined Herb Crawert, also a
union member and employed as a

maintenance mechanic in Service
Operations, in agreeing that the Uni
versity staff needs a union.
Self, a union member since 1971,
did say that "we need a modified
shop that will represent all of us. We
also need a dental plan and we need
the vacation rules changed."
Benefits
Asked if he thought the union
could obtain thse benefits, Self said
"I think they can get it, but they ha
ven't."
Munson said "I do think that if the
union doesn't pull through with a
half-decent contract this time,
they're not going to see another
three years."
Munson cited cost of living in
creases in wages and a dental plan as
essential components of a "decent
contract."
Munson, Self and Crawert all
commended the moves to stream
line the grievance procedure.
Crawert said "There is nothing
wrong with the grievance system it
self, you just have to get the two par
ties to work it out."
Crawert did feel that there were
things wrong with the union con
tract. "For example, why do people
have to pay the agency fee when they
aren't interested in the union?" The
agency fee, one percent of wages,
must be paid by all members of the
bargaining unit whether or not they
join the union. According to
Crawert, the fee goes to the union.
"To join, you have to fill out the con
sent card."
Last year's election resulted in a
split between Britton's supporters
and those of then-seoetary Berk. "I
think it's pretty well patched over
now," said Britton. "Differences
now are mostly over issues rather
than on Britton vs. Berk lines; we got
rid of the dictator, and people are
pretty satisfied."
Munson's feeling about Berk as
union president was that "Berk was
the best one we could've had, but
the problem was he had a hard-on
against the University and tried to
run the whole show by himself."
Munson did not know who he
would vote for this spring. "But I do
think it's kind of shitty to have officer
elections with the contract negotia
tions coming up; you don't change
your cards in the middle of the
game."
