# Eclipse to occur Monday
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Next Monday, over North
America, a giant dragon will seize the sun in its
colossal jaws and try to devour it in a mighty
battle across the sky.
That, at least, is what the ancient Chinese
thought was happening in an eclipse of the sun
— a struggle between light and darkness.
They banged gongs, shouted, shot off rockets
and firecrackers, and generally raised a big
commotion to scare the beast away.
And it worked. The dragon always released its
bite on the orb.
Different this time
Although there may not be a lot of gong clang
ing this time, the latest eclipse should attract
some attention as sunlight fades and a subdued
hue settles across the land.
The event takes on added significance be
cause it is the last total eclipse visible in North
America this century. It will be 2017 before the
moon's shadow again totally blocks view of the
sun from this continent.
Solar eclipses occur when the moon lines up
between the earth and the sun on the same
plane. The moon blocks out some sunlight and
casts shadows upon the earth.
Shadow
To those in the deepest shadow, the moon
seems to cover the sun. Actually, the sun's
diameter is 400 times greater than the moon's,
but the moon is far closer — producing the
illusion.
Practically all of North America will experi
ence at least a partial eclipse, with a portion of
the sun's disk covered over. And over parts of
the Northwest and Canada, the whole sun will

be obscured because they lie along the narrow
path the moon's shadow will follow.
The closer a person is to this path of totality,
the greater the portion of the sun that will be
covered at maximum eclipse. For example, in
Bismarck, N.D., 99 percent of the sun will be
hidden, compared with 61 percent in New York
City and 32 percent in Miami.
At sunrise here
The eclipse will begin at about sunrise on the
West Coast and about mid-morning in the East.
It should last about two and one-half hours.
The moon's shadow, about 170 miles wide,
will race eastward at 1700 miles per hour from
northern Oregon and southern Washington ac
ross northern Idaho and central Montana. It
then will swing northeastward across north
western North Dakota, into Canada and onward
through Greenland.
Potential eye damage
A potential hazard posed by this and any ec
lipse is eye damage from staring directly at the
sun. The American Medical Association, the
American Association of Ophthalmology (AAO)
and others concerned with eye problems are
warning people to be careful.
All warn against viewing the eclipse with the
naked eye. And it also is not safe to use sunglas
ses, smoked glass, photographic film or nega
tives, camera filters or other devices, even in
combination.
"Those who have used such things in the past
and escaped injury were just plain lucky," says
AAO President Dr. Whitney Sampson, of Hous
ton.
