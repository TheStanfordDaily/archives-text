In April, Environment Month will de
but, a project aimed at "informing stu
dents on issues relating to the environ
ment," said junior Greg Call, one of the
projects organizers. Speakers, panel
discussions, and possibly a benefit con
cert, powered by solar energy, are some
of the activities planned for the month.
Steve Mentor, another organizer, said
he hopes the month will stimulate
people to think about environmental is
sues. "The politics of the month are that
it's supposed to be even-sided," Mentor
added, "not advocating either side of the
issues presented."

Kitty Boone, instructor for a SWOPSI
course involved with planning activities,
said that one major speaker is David
Brower, president of the Friends of the
Earth, a nation-wide ecology group. A
number of groups here had been work
ing out ideas for an ecology month early
in the academic year.
Call explained that the Speakers
Bureau "had been planning since
November to hold a week on energy pol
icy."
At the same time a SWOPSI class, "The
American Wilderness: Politics of Preser
vation," taught by Boone, elected to
make action projects to host a series of

speakers for a week, according to
Boone.
These groups came together and
combined ideas to produce a month
long program on the environment, with
an "emphasis on student involvement,"
Call said.
The first topic of discussion will be
"The Economy of Environmental Regula
tion;" the second will be "Nuclear
Energy," the third will be "Forest and
Wilderness," and the final topic will be
"California Energy in the 1980s."
Another activity of the week will be a
solar energy demonstration by Pacific
Gas and Electric Company.
