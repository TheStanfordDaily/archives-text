## American people losing courage 
### 
I sense a loss of courage
among most Americans. Ale
xander Solzhenitsyn is not the
only one who has noticed it.
Some people might call it a loss
of nerve.
It shows up in small things.
For example, someone cuts
into line, yet everyone stands
mute. They scold the person in
their minds for having been so
selfish, but they lack the cour
age to tell him that he'd better
go to the back of the line like
everybody else.
It shows up in bigger ways,
too. We are warned not to go
certain places at night because
we may be attacked. So we
avoid these places without
ever testing the hypothesis.
In our paranoia we simply
accept the warnings of others
to stay out of the "bad side of
town'' or to drive rather than
use the subway because of the
kind of people that ride it.
The first example is silly, you
may say. After all, it's not that
important if a few people cut in
line. I'll eventually,get what I'm
waiting for since it's unlikely
they will run out. I will come
back to this.
As for the second example,
you say, I certainly ought to
beware. Look at the amount of
crime we have today in this
country. I'm not going to
chance exposing myself to all
kinds of dangers.
I think if we were actually to
avoid all the places we are told
to, we would probably live in
bomb shelters making only
semi-annual forays to re

plenish our supplies, and then
only under armed guard.
I think we take our warnings
in a way that restricts and hand
icaps us and thus we may not
be so far from the bomb shelter
world I describe. I often ask
myself when I am locking the
windows and doors at night
whether I am locking other
people out or really just lock
ing myself in.
Let us return to that person
who cut in line. It's no wonder
that most people would be un
concerned with him. In this
land of plenty there is little
worry that anything will run
out. Affluence, unfortunately,
breeds tolerance for these
kinds of acts.
Cutting in line is really a mild
form of theft. But even the
theft of something more con
crete frequently does not
phase us much. After all, we
can always go out and buy
another. In less fortunate
countries, however, theft is a
much more serious offense,
because a person's livelihood
may be threatened.
The fact of our affluence
sheds some light on our at
titudes in another way also. By
and large, we have grown up
and continue to live in separate
houses. In those houses we
spend a good amount of time
living in separate rooms. We
drive to work in separate cars
and sometimes even work in
separate offices.
This kind of life doesn't de
mand much cooperation or
compromise, so it is easy to see

how the sense of mutual re
sponsibility fails to grow very
strong in our society.
The way we live also makes it
too easy to avoid confronta
tion. We can always retreat into
our little private cubicles, be
they home, car or office. The
problem in this is that we don't
get much of a chance to culti
vate a sense of how to deal with
others who make demands on
us. And we end up with little or
no experience in how to com
promise or how to fight back.
Eric Hoffer long ago recog
nized that one of the reasons
crime is so widespread in this
country is that people simply
refuse to confront it. In fact,
police have on occassion
counseled us not to resist
someone who has the stated
purpose of only taking our
possessions.
Try to imagine how much
crime would be reduced, if our
tolerant passivity suddenly
disappeared. Criminals would
have the double worry that (1)
the victim would attempt to de
fend himself and his property
and (2) that others would assist
him.
Also, if it appears that I'm ad
vocating austerity as a way to
restore our courage and sense
of community, perhaps that is
what is necessary. (If it does
come, we probably will have
little to say about it.) Bad times
tend to bring people together.
Good times make it easy for
them to go their own way.
If you think a strong sense of
community is something unat
tainable, you should venture
beyond our own borders to
Europe or the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union, for example
has considerably less crime
than we do. But it is difficult to
attribute this to the large police
apparatus. No group of 400,000
persons can keep track of 250
million persons all the time.
Having observed the Rus
sians in action, I think the ans
wer lies in the fact that thevare
less tolerant of crime than we
are. For one thing, they are not
as affluent and thus, are more
jealous of what they do have.
More important than this,
however, is that in committing
a crime the criminal runs the
risk not only of being caught by
the police, but of actually
being set upon by everyone in
the vicinity. The sense of
mutual responsibility is ex
tremely strong.
A Russian upbringing is quite
different from ours. There is
the constant contact of the
communal apartment. There
are also the long lines every
day in front of shops and mar
kets. I'm not suggesting, how
ever, that we ought to trans
form our society into a Russian
one. That's not possible.
But I do worry because our
society seems to lack cohesion
and courage. To say that in
America good samaritans went
out with good manners may be
true. But a society without
good samaritans is no society
at all. A dangerous withdrawal
and preoccupation with self
are atomizing our entire soci
ety and making its citizens in
dividually and collectively im
potent in the face of crisis.
