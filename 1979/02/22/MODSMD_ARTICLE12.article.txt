Joy of parking
Until recently, I was fortu
nate enough to be able to
commute by bicycle to the
campus, where I have been
working forthepast 15 years or
so. But adequate housing for
staff on a Stanford budget is
scarce around campus.
Though faculty housing is of
fered to those in a higher in
come bracket, there is no
equivalent for staff that I am
aware of.
Finally being able to make
the step to modest home
owner, or better, home-ower, I
saw myself forced to move to
Sunnyvale and thus became one
ot many commuters whose
skills are constantly challenged
by the obstacle course that
Stanford so generously pro
vides to minimize easy access
and carefree parking.
Normally, I do not have a
parking problem since I arrive
well before 8 a.m. and most of
the C-lots are still deserted.
Recently, I was delayed,
not through my own fault I
might add, but because of

some business I had to attend
to. As I pulled into the parking
lot at Panama and Via Ortega at
11 a.m., all C-spaces — as well
as every possible yellow and
red space — were taken.
It seems that this parking lot
has been nibbled at a lot re
cently and is slowly disappear
ing. I had a choice. I could sit
there and wait until somebody
left early for lunch, drive
around at 75 cents a gallon to
possibly find something still
overlooked or leave.
And so I left to come back
early to be able to park. As I
drove out I was thinking of the
profit Stanford was making
with its parking stickers, which
seem only to have worsened
the problem. I also thought of
the loss through such occur
ances. In my case, about $30
for that hour, which is the
amount the department
charges for my services.
The question is, is it really
worth it?
