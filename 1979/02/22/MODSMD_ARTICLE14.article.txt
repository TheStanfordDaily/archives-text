## Shortcomings of the National Energy Act 
### 
<First of two parts)
After long deliberation, the
U.S. Congress passed the con
troversial National Energy Act
(NEA) on October 15 of last
year. The NEA's five acts are
most important for what they
symbolize and represent — the
nation's first attempt at plan
ning and developing a long
range energy strategy for the
future.
For the first time, conserva

tion is clearly recognized as a
national goal and as a "cor
nerstone of the plan." Conser
vation in the plan is recognized
as an alternative to increased
production that saves finan
cial, human and natural re
sources.
Nevertheless, the NEA's
specific conservation
guidelines are disappointing
and the projected savings are
far too low. The United States,

as the plan admits, wastes 45
percent of the energy it con
sumes, as compared to im
ported oil which accounts for
25 percent of our energy con
sumption.
Virtually everyone is for con
servation, yet our commitment
to conservation remains shal
low. In 1975, only 1 percent of
the federal energy budget was
spent for conservation.
There is considerable room
for improving the energy
operating efficiency of our soc
iety, yet the best the NEA can
offer is a slowdown in con
sumption, rather than a de
crease in energy consumption.
There is no reason given in the
plan why energy consumption
and supplies must increase in
the next 10 years when a seri
ous and sustained conserva
tion program to improve our
energy efficiency slightly each
year could allow increases in
energy usefulness without an
increase in our demand for fuel
supplies.
The plan claims through
conservation we can save six
quads in all sectors of our
economy by 1985. (A quad
equals the energy equivalent
of 180 million barrels of crude
oil.) Vet, the American Institute
of Architects has reported in
several studies that as of 1985,
the United States could save 16
quads per year through a
steady program of building all
new buildings energy effi
ciently and insulating7percent
of all existing buildings every
year.
The plan should push harder
and more optimistically for
energy savings that will make a
large difference, rather than
assuming a thoroughly un
necessary 22 percent energy
increase over the next nine

years.
In other conservation areas,
the plan could alst) go much
further. For example, the plan
overlooks setting mandatory
insulation standards forall new
homes.
The plan should be criticized
for the undue attention and
funding it reserves for nuclear
power — an expensive and in
creasingly less important fuel
for this country's energy mix
for the future. A nationwide
ban on nuclear expansion
would only decrease energy
supplies by 4.1 percent in 1985
— as much energy as firewood
currently supplies.
President jimmy Carter de
scribes nuclear power in the
NEA as a "last resort," yet his
budget allots $656 million for
various breeders and $435 mill
ion for fusion as compared to
$90 million for solar heating
and cooling and $215 million
for all solar electric tech
nologies! Carter is just pay
ing lip service to solar energy
since he's giving almost five
times as much to fusion, a to
tally unproven technology, as
he gives to solar heating, a
proven technology.
The unusually low projec
tions for the contribution of
renewable resources in the
next 10 years can be explained
by goals which are unambiti
ous and self-fulfilling and by
the allocation of most of the
funds for research and de
velopment to other conven
tional energy sources that are
already heavily subsidized by
the public (up to 50 percent).
The plan also places too
much emphasis on coal as a
major energy source. Coal is
very environmentally destruc
tive and should not be relied
on as more than a transition

fuel in our future. Coal is in
creasingly dangerous to mine
at lower depths; coal combus
tion contributes heavily to pol
lution of the atmoshere and
water; western reserves will
require enormous supplies of
scarce water; and coal burning
may be responsible for a
dangerous global heating
trend.
The plan also neglects to
emphasize the attractiveness
of renewable energy resources
and conservation as effective
aids in stimulating employ
ment.
The energy problems in the
NEA are endemic to our soci
ety. We're not running out of
energy, just inexpensive fuels.
Americans are still paying one
third less for gas than any other
nation in the world.
The U.S. government is still
protecting the spoiled public
from paying the real price of
gasoline — its replacement
cost. This is the cost the con
sumer will eventually have to
pay.
We can no longer pretend to
ignore the economic and social
realities of American gasoline
usage and the government-in
duced "artificial pricing" sys
tem. It is seriously eroding the
dollar and overall U.S. power
and influence abroad.
If we are to reach the na
tional goal of energy indepen
dence, we must develop far
more ambitious plans which
combine serious conservation
programs in every sector of the
economy with an optimal mix
of proven renewable energy
technologies, and the prudent
use of fossil fuels to carry us
through the transition to a sus
tainable society.
