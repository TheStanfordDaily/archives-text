## Dealing with the big issues 
### 
(Last of a series)
South Africa, Coors, DNA research, re
source depletion — these are all issues which
society in general must deal with, including
students. The Little Eleven Committee on
University Role in Social and Political Affairs
is investigating these as well as other socially
and politically related activities.
Student involvement and input in such af
fairs can affect University decision-making,
particularly at an institution such as Stanford
which, while serving the function of an
educator, also fulfills other roles. These in
clude that of a local landlord, an employer of
workers with grievances and a corporate en
tity with both domestic and foreign invest
ments.
In order to deal most effectively with the
broad range of issues, the committee has
chosen several basic areas tu address.
Consumer boycotts present a continuing
opportunity for students here to take a role in
social and political action. Boycotts are not
new here, as the community supported the
Gallo wine and table grapes boycotts in sup
port of the United Farm Workers.
The Coors boycott, currently a much
debated issue, as well as other consumer
boycotts will be investigated. The Coors
boycott is essentially advocated to protest
mandatory lie detector tests, searches and
seizures and other alleged bullying tactics of
the Adolph Coors Brewing Company.
Other possible boycotts include the J.P.
Stevens Textiles and Nestles companies. Ste
vens, one of America's largest textile pro
ducers, has been found guilty of unfair labor
practices more than 15 times. Poor wages and
unsafe working conditions are the main is
sues here.
The Nestles boycott centers around the
quality of baby formulawhich Nestle sends to
Third World nations. Boycott organizers
claim Nestles' formula lacks essential nut
rients.
The Coors boycott committee has recently

been joined in support by the Stanford Chap
ter of PIRG, the Public Interest Research
Croup, another organization to be re
searched by the Little Eleven Committee.
Emphasis will be placed on PIRG's methods,
goals and potential lobbying power for con
sumer issues by uniting all California
branches.
Consumer issues, legal services and such
issues as product labelling laws and au
tomobile safety will be discussed. Issues of
particular concern to students are fair hous
ing laws and landlord/tenant relations.
University-specific areas of interest in
clude The Store, food service and the
Transition. The ASSU Legal Counseling Ser
vice will undoubtedly serve as a model for
other universities at the conference.
The committee will also discuss ways in
which undergraduates can get involved in
community issues and para-legal work.
Investigation of various potentially sensi
tive areas of research on campus will be done
also. This includes possible ties between the
University and SRI International, DNA re
search, nuclear research and Department of
Defense research.
The South African and Iranian issues will be
discussed as both are not only current na
tional issues but have a base of support at the
University.
~ The areas of energy and ecology will also
be a major topic of discussion. Stanford sup
ports a wealth of such activities including
ASSU Recycling, the Roth House solar water
heating system, the Energy Conservation
Center and the efforts to construct a solar
heated dorm on campus. The committee
feels that in this area, too, the University will
serve as a model to other universities at Little
Eleven.
In researching these and other areas, the
committee hopes to represent some of the
major issues and concerns of students here.
