# Answers to U.S. oil crisis questions
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The interruption of Iranian oil
production has led to a situation that Energy Sec
retary James Schlesinger says is "prospectively
more serious" than the 1973—74 Arab oil embargo.
Yet most Americans have found no reason to agree.
Even though prices are rising and government
officials warn there could be mandatory controls
on oil use soon, there are no lines at service sta
tions. Gasoline can still be bought on Sunday. And
there have been no widespread shortgages of any
kind of fuel.
So why the fuss? Here are answers to some
common questions:
Q. Since Iran only supplied 5 percent of the Un
ited States' crude oil needs, why is the loss of the oil
so important?
A. Five percent doesn't seem much, but officials
say it is enough to tighten supply. One official put it
this way: "Imagine if 5 percent of the nation's driv
ers were told they couldn't get gas any more."
Actually, the nation's loss so far is more like 2.5
percent because other oil-producing nations are
making up some of the absent production. But
experts say even that is enough to cause worry.
It is also important to realize that other countries,
particularly in Europe, have been far more depen
dent on Iranian oil that the United States. Iran has
produced 10 percent of world supply, and gaps
elsewhere are being filled from the same sources to
which this nation must turn. The result: a world
wide supply squeeze.
So, officials say, the world faces serious prob
lems in the event of unexpected trouble like the oil
field fire in Saudi Arabia two years ago. And U.S.
supplies were tight even before Iran's cutoff.
Q. Oil imports have been running high in recent
months, and the last tanker of Iranian oil just ar
rived. Why are there problems now?

A. High oil imports are the result of massive or
ders placed by the oil companies to get oil before
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries' (OPEC) price rose 5 percent Jan. 1.
Nevertheless, supplies of some products such as
jet fuel are tight because some companies rely on
the spot market to meet demand. That is where
sales not covered by long-term contracts take
place, and although it accounts for only about 5
percent of oil supplies, it is important because it is
used to adjust inventories.
The lossof Iranian oil has all butdried upthespot
market, and sent prices for what is available there
soaring, as countries more dependent on Iran than
the United States go there to make up their losses.
Q. All right, there's a problem. But why are the
warnings so dire? ,
A. Experts say if the shutdown in Iran lasts
beyond a couple of more months, it could cause
serious problems next winter.
In addition, analysts say the government is appa
rently taking advantage of the situation to try one
more time to convince Americans that they should
conserve energy, evidently in the belief that a good
scare might change wasteful habits once and for all.
Q. Is that why Texaco and several other oil com
panies are limiting the amount of gasoline they sell
to dealers now?
A. Yes. Gasoline consumption drops in winter
anyway, as bad weather curtails driving. With crude
oil supplies uncertain, the companies want a lot of
gasoline on hand at the start of summer so they can
switch to heating oil production early for next
winter.
Q. What's all this doing to consumer prices?
A. That's not quite clear. The base price of crude
oil, from which other products are refined, was set

by the Jan. 1 OPEC increase at $13.35 per 42-gallon
barrel. That price has generally held. But Saudi
Arabia, the key nation filling the gap left by Iran,
has placed a higher price on the extra 1 million
barrels a day it is producing over its usual 8.5 mill
ion barrels. Other nations have done the same.
So far, there has been virtually no rise in con
sumer prices due to these special increases, be
cause not much oil is involved. But should OPEC
decide the market will bear higher prices, it could
speed up its 14.5 percent general price rise
scheduled for this year.
Q. Then why am I paying more for gasoline and
heating oil?
A. In both cases, that's the result of the Jan. 1
OPEC increase, which added about a penny per
gallon to the prices of each product.
In addition, some gasoline dealers, taking advan
tage of supply tightness, are increasing profit mar
gins. In the case of heating oil, the price of which is
not regulated by the federal government, the rise is
quicker because a lot of heating oil comes from the
spot market, where prices are higher. This is pas
sed on to the consumer.
Q. Isn't this whole thing just a scam dreamed up
by the oil companies to squeeze a few more pen
nies out of me at the gas pump?
A. There's little to support that oft-made accusa
tion. In fact, the companies have appeared less
concerned than the government and say mandat
ory controls will be unnecessary. Of course, ration
ing would cut the amount of gasoline they sell and
erode their profits. But the industry also is worried
about its public image because it wants controls
lifted from gasoline prices.
The Energy Department backs that idea, which it
says would encourage an expansion of refinery
capacity.

tions. Gasoline can still be bought on Sunday. And
there have been no widespread shortgages of any
kind of fuel.
So why the fuss? Here are answers to some
common questions:
Q. Since Iran only supplied 5 percent of the Un
ited States' crude oil needs, why is the loss of the oil
so important?
A. Five percent doesn't seem much, but officials
say it is enough to tighten supply. One official put it
this way: "Imagine if 5 percent of the nation's driv
ers were told they couldn't get gas any more."
Actually, the nation's loss so far is more like 2.5
percent because other oil-producing nations are
making up some of the absent production. But
experts say even that is enough to cause worry.
It is also important to realize that other countries,
particularly in Europe, have been far more depen
dent on Iranian oil that the United States. Iran has
produced 10 percent of world supply, and gaps
elsewhere are being filled from the same sources to
which this nation must turn. The result: a world
wide supply squeeze.
So, officials say, the world faces serious prob
lems in the event of unexpected trouble like the oil
field fire in Saudi Arabia two years ago. And U.S.
supplies were tight even before Iran's cutoff.
Q. Oil imports have been running high in recent
months, and the last tanker of Iranian oil just ar
rived. Why are there problems now?

A. High oil imports are the result of massive or
ders placed by the oil companies to get oil before
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries' (OPEC) price rose 5 percent Jan. 1.
Nevertheless, supplies of some products such as
jet fuel are tight because some companies rely on
the spot market to meet demand. That is where
sales not covered by long-term contracts take
place, and although it accounts for only about 5
percent of oil supplies, it is important because it is
used to adjust inventories.
The lossof Iranian oil has all butdried upthespot
market, and sent prices for what is available there
soaring, as countries more dependent on Iran than
the United States go there to make up their losses.
Q. All right, there's a problem. But why are the
warnings so dire? ,
A. Experts say if the shutdown in Iran lasts
beyond a couple of more months, it could cause
serious problems next winter.
In addition, analysts say the government is appa
rently taking advantage of the situation to try one
more time to convince Americans that they should
conserve energy, evidently in the belief that a good
scare might change wasteful habits once and for all.
Q. Is that why Texaco and several other oil com
panies are limiting the amount of gasoline they sell
to dealers now?
A. Yes. Gasoline consumption drops in winter
anyway, as bad weather curtails driving. With crude
oil supplies uncertain, the companies want a lot of
gasoline on hand at the start of summer so they can
switch to heating oil production early for next
winter.
Q. What's all this doing to consumer prices?
A. That's not quite clear. The base price of crude
oil, from which other products are refined, was set

by the Jan. 1 OPEC increase at $13.35 per 42-gallon
barrel. That price has generally held. But Saudi
Arabia, the key nation filling the gap left by Iran,
has placed a higher price on the extra 1 million
barrels a day it is producing over its usual 8.5 mill
ion barrels. Other nations have done the same.
So far, there has been virtually no rise in con
sumer prices due to these special increases, be
cause not much oil is involved. But should OPEC
decide the market will bear higher prices, it could
speed up its 14.5 percent general price rise
scheduled for this year.
Q. Then why am I paying more for gasoline and
heating oil?
A. In both cases, that's the result of the Jan. 1
OPEC increase, which added about a penny per
gallon to the prices of each product.
In addition, some gasoline dealers, taking advan
tage of supply tightness, are increasing profit mar
gins. In the case of heating oil, the price of which is
not regulated by the federal government, the rise is
quicker because a lot of heating oil comes from the
spot market, where prices are higher. This is pas
sed on to the consumer.
Q. Isn't this whole thing just a scam dreamed up
by the oil companies to squeeze a few more pen
nies out of me at the gas pump?
A. There's little to support that oft-made accusa
tion. In fact, the companies have appeared less
concerned than the government and say mandat
ory controls will be unnecessary. Of course, ration
ing would cut the amount of gasoline they sell and
erode their profits. But the industry also is worried
about its public image because it wants controls
lifted from gasoline prices.
The Energy Department backs that idea, which it
says would encourage an expansion of refinery
capacity.
New York (AP) — The interruption of Iranian oil
production has led to a situation that Energy Sec
retary James Schlesinger says is "prospectively
more serious" than the 1973—74 Arab oil embargo.
Yet most Americans have found no reason to agree.
Even though prices are rising and government
officials warn there could be mandatory controls
on oil use soon, there are no lines at service sta
tions. Gasoline can still be bought on Sunday. And
there have been no widespread shortgages of any
