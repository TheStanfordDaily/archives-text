## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” A jury of
eight men and four women
were seated today in a wo
man's $7 million civil lawsuit
against a doctor whose sex
change operation she claims
left her neither man nor wo
man.
Julie Phillips has accused
John Brown of medical im
proprieties in connection with
a two-stage operation to
change her from a man to a
woman. Brown's medical
license to practice in California
was subsequently revoked.
The trial will begin Monday.
"I don't know where I be
long," she told a reporter in
the courtroom of Superior
Court Judge William Mullins.
"I don't belong in the gay life. I
don't belong in the straight
life...it isn't the money, I want
peace of mind."
She claimed Brown charged
herssooo plus otherconsidera
tions including furniture for his
office, and once used her to
assist in a nose-reconstruction
operation on another patient.
At the time of the opera
tions, she said, she was living
with a man and capable of ex
periencing pleasure from both
heterosexual and homosexual
acts.

Melvin Belli, one of the
foremost medical malpriactice
lawyers in the country, said he
is asking $5 million punitive
damages and $2 million gen
eral damages against Brown
and his "agent," James
Spence, whom Belli claimed
represented himself as a doc
tor.
Neither defendant was avail
able for comment.
The suit accuses Brown of
violating medical standards,
using Spence as a medical as
sistant, employing his patients
as medical assistants and,
among other charges, per
forming sex-change opera
tions "on demand" and with
out psychological evaluations.
The suit charged Brown with
conducting his sex-change op
eration in two stages, "thus
submitting the patient to a
castration, with a lapse of sev
eral weeks between that opera
tion and the second one, in
which a vagina was created."
The suit alleged that "the
purpose of performing this
two-stage procedure was not
to benefit the patient but solely
to defraud insurance com
panies that would not pay for
sex-change operations."
