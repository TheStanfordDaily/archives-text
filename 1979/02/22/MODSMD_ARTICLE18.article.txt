# SLE: Mixing the classroom with dorm life
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
Have you noticed those
spaced-out freshmen walking
around with the Collected
Works of Plato under their
arms and muttering, "Is there
an Absolute Truth? Do I believe
in it?"
If so, you may have stumbled
onto a member of the little
known freshman seminar enti
tled Structured Liberal Educa
tion (SLE).
The nine-unit program is
based in Florence Moore Hall
where most SLE members live.
Originally conceived by fa
culty members from various
different departments, the
program began in 1973 with 20
students. Now the three
quarter seminar enrolls 61 stu
dents and employs five senior
faculty members from various
departments and four acting
instructors.
In addition to the regular fa
culty, students receive instruc
tion from a wide range of guest
lecturers. SLE also employs 17
writing tutors, many of them
former SLE students, to assist
with term paper assignments.
The program introduces
freshmen to a wide variety of
subjects and fulfills all Univer
sity writing and distribution
requirements. During fall
quarter, students read selected
works of Homer, Aeschylus,
Euripedes, Plato and Aristotle,
and are required to write four
short papers.
In winter quarter, SLE stu
dents study the Renaissance,
reading selected works of
Dante, Castiglione,
Machiavelli, Galileo, Shakes
peare, Bacon, Descartes, Mon
taigne and Newton. With help
from their tutors, students
write three longer papers on
assigned topics.
Spring quarter is devoted to
the modern period. Students
read material by Adam Smith,
Marx, Darwin, Balzac, Weber,
Freud, Dostoyevsky, Nietzche,
Kafka, Joyce and Einstein.
Under faculty dnd tutor au
spices, students write one re
search paper on a subject of
their choice.
According to Mark Mancall,
director of SLE, the program
has several goals and objec
tives. The program's founders
"wanted to bring order out of
the chaos of undergraduate
education," he said. Thus, SLE
is designed to provide students
with a structured, limited found
ation of Western culture. SLE
faculty said they believe this
foundation will aid students in
choosing future classes and

selecting a major.
The program stresses two
skills: reading and writing. SLE
attempts to teach students how
to read analytically, Mancall
said. "We want students to
learn how to interrogate a
text," he explained. Writing
skills are developed with SLE
faculty and tutors reading and
criticizing student papers. A
student's quarter grade is
based principally on his papers
and his final exam.
SLE is described in each edi
tion of Approaching Stanford,
the information booklet foren
tering freshmen. Interested
freshmen fill out a card and re
turn it to Mancall. He and
Jon Reider, SLE instructor, chose
approximately 60 students and 10
alternates for the program.
Reider said the program
usually draws about 100 applic
ants, although this year 150
students applied. Mancall and
Reider choose students on the
basis of interests, experiences
and background. Reider noted

that although selection follows
no set pattern, "we've had no
real complaints about the pro
cess."
Similar in subject matter to
the Humanities 60 series, SLE
has been the model for the
Western Culture course,
Reider said. All three courses
— Humanities, Western Cul
ture and SLE — cover the same
time periods and material, but
only SLE is viably connected
with residential education.
Because SLE students live
and attend classes in Florence
Moore, SLE activities and mate
rial are key conversation topics
within the freshmen dorms of
the complex. Thus, much of a
student's SLE education may
take place in day-to-day con
versation with neighbors or
around the dinner table with
friends or with Mancall who is a
Resident Fellow for Flo Mo. In
addition, several tutors live in
the complex. As Reider stated,
"There exists a greater willing
ness to have intellectual con
versation in this atmosphere."

But living and studying to
gether also poses many prob
lems for SLE students and for
Flo Mo students not participat
ing in the program. With half
the dorm's residents doing the
same reading and paper topics,
there is often a significant
amount of tension within each
house. Addie-Lyn Swartz, a SLE
student from Paloma,
explained that, "Living to
gether helps sometimes be
cause everyone's in the same
boat, but there is a lot of com
petition. You can feel the pres
sure."
In addition to tension within
the houses, the program often
causes divisions between SLE
students and students not par
ticipating in the program.
Mancall acknowledged the
existence of these problems,
saying, "SLE becomes self
absorbed and this creates
problems. But that's natural."
Scott Altmann, a non-SLE
student from Cavilan agreed.
Living together "splits up the
dorm into SLE and non-SLE

people. We don't join in the
SLE conversations."
Overall, student reactions to
the benefits of living with
steady classmates are mixed.
Yet, Mancall explained that
students often don't realize the
benefits of living together until
after they've completed the
program. He cited the many
former SLE students who, as
upperclassmen, come back
into the program as tutors.
"Freshman don't know the
value of co-habitation until
later in their educational de
velopment," he said.
Despite the problems of
co-habitation and the intensity
associated with the program,
most participating students
seem fairly pleased with SLE.
As Nina Bohlen, a newcomer to
SLE and resident of Faisan said
"I am really excited about
going into such depth on such
interesting material."
"The program forces me to
think," concluded Paul
Maciejewski, SLE student from
Alondra.
