Three persons, including a football player here, were
injured in a head-on collision on Sand Hill Road Tuesday
night, according to Menlo Park Police.
Card footballer Steve Budinger, 19, suffered a frac
tured right hip, said Med Center spokesman Bob Tapia.
Budinger is currently in the general care ward of Stan
ford Hospital and was described as being in "stable and
satisfactory condition."
Budinger was a passenger in a Volkswagen driven by
Tina Moore, also 19, a Foothill College student and
friend of Budinger. Moore suffered a "dislocated left
ankle and multiple abrasions," according to Bill Snyder,
another Med Center spokesman. She was also de
scribed as being in stable and satisfactory condition.
The driver of the other car, 24-year-old Kevin Ford of
East Palo Alto, suffered a "chest trauma" and remains in
the Hospital's surgical intensive care unit, according to
Tapia. Snyder described Ford's injury as being "like a
blow to the chest, not a piercing wound."
The accident took place in the westbound lanes of
Sand Hill Road at about 8:40 p.m., according to agent
Harold Finch of the Menlo Park Police Dept. "The car
(Ford's) was apparently on the wrong side of the road,"
Finch said.
Ford was arrested on suspicion of driving under the
influence of alcohol, Finch said.

Budinger and Moore were trapped in their car when
Menlo Park firefighters arrived, according to the Palo
Alto Times. A hydraulic prying tool had to be used to free
them from the damaged vehicle.
Budinger is in traction now, Tapia said. The medical
staff is not planning to schedule surgery now, but that
possibility does exist.
The medical staff is taking a "wait-and-see" attitude on
Budinger's condition depending on how he heals, Tapia
said. There could be an operation in "approximately
three weeks," but there is no way to tell at this time, he
said.
Moore was scheduled to go into surgery late yesterday
afternoon, Tapia said. Ford has not been scheduled for
surgery.
According to Gary Cavalli, director of sports publicity
here, Budinger will probably be "in traction for three
weeks and on crutches for three months." Cavalli said
"we're talking May or June before resuming normal
activities."
Cavalli said it was possible that the sophomore
linebacker would only miss spring practice and be ready
to play next season.
Budinger was a starting linebacker for the Cards this
past season. The Tucson, Ariz, native was named Defen
sive Player of the Game by ABC Television after the
Cards' 21-14 victory over Arizona Nov. 11.
