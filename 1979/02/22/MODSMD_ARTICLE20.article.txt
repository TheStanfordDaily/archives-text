# Trivia bug hits campus
## 
### Andrew Rich 
Who played center field in Abbott and Cos
tello's famous "Who's on First?" routine? If
you can answer that, you've probably
caught the trivia bug. Find three other simi
larly afflicted students, faculty or staff, and
you're ready to enter the third annual Stan
ford Trivia Bowl.
This year's Bowl is scheduled for April 9 to
14 and will be limited to 46 teams. Spaces will
be filled on a first-come, first-served basis,
and applications will be made available Mon
day.
The tournament is being organized by a
group of students who define themselves as
"old Roble hashers, a token freshman, and
one former dope pusher." This core of trivia
freaks was rounded up by Mike Lopez
through an ad in the Daily.
Lopez, KZSU's program director, inherited
the Bowl from Bob Moog, who brought the
concept here when he transfered from Col
orado College. "Moog is our guru," Lopez
said, referring to the fact that Moog person
ally organized and ran the first Bowl.
20x100 questions
This year's organizing core has been at
work since the beginning of February, com
piling odd facts and writing up questions.
Core members are aiming for2ooo questions,
but they say they "may go higher if we have
fun at it."
Complaining that last year's questions
"were more or less random, but tended to
run in groups," the core said it hoped to
make this tournament more organized
through better advertising and more care
fully groomed questions. Says Lopez, "We're
not pulling our answers from a finite number

of sources."
This year's trivia will be grouped under ten
headings, ranging from movies and comics
through U.S. history. There will also beques
tions under the Stanford trivia category.
Buzzer race
The Trivia Bowl will be run in a standard
College Bowl style: a question will be read to
two opposing teams. The first contestant to
hit his or her buzzer must answer the ques
tion unaided. If correct, the whole team will
have a chance to answer a bonus question. If
neither team can answer a question, it will be
thrown out to the audience.
"You can get some really great responses,"
a core member said. "One of the questions
that went to the audience last year was:
'What is the only thing Wonder man is vul
nerable to?' and somebody called back
'Wonder Woman.'"
What are the reasons for competing?
Beyond the "trivial trophies for the winners"
it's only for prestige and fun. Similar goals
motivate the organizers. "None of us like to
lose," they said. "You can't lose if you're on
the organizing committee." One member
competed in Stanford's Trivia Bowl last year
and another has competed in the College
Bowl twice.
To warm you up, the committee suggests
you answer these questions: "How long was
the 100 Year's War? In what country are
Panama Hats made?" The answers, of course,
are 116 and Ecuador, respectively. But the
real indication of what's in store for this
year's Trivia Bowl is best displayed by Lopez's
statement: "We know Beaver's (Leave it to
Beaver) locker number, but we're not going
to tell."
