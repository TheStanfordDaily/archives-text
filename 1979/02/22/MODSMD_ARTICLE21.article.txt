# Company seeks gov't sanction to manufacture herpes drug
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — A California drug com
pany has asked the government for approval
to market a new drug to treat shingles and
genital herpes, the nation's fastest-spreading
venereal disease for which no effective
treatment is presently available.
Developers of the drug ribavirin, produced
by ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the brand
name Virazole, said yesterday the substance
could be a breakthrough in fighting a wide
range of viral diseases from influenza and
hepatitis to hemorrhagic fever, a deadly ill
ness known in some parts of the world as
Lassa fever.
But the food and Drug Administration
(FDA), known throughout the industry for its
caution in processing new drug applications,
said the studies it has seen so far give no
reason to believe the substance represents
"an important therapeutic advance."
ICN now is asking for marketing approval
for the drug to treat herpes genitalis, a con
tagious disease characterized by recurring,
painful lesions in the genital region, and

herpes zoster, a viral disease of the nervous
system also known as shingles. Genital
herpes, whose sexually transmitted nature
has only been understood in recent years, is
spreading at epidemic levels in the United
States, particularly among the young, sexu
ally active population.
It has been associated with cancer of the
cervix in women, miscarriages and may cause
serious or even fatal illness in babies born to
women carrying the disease.
Together, shingles and genital herpes are
believed to afflict millions of Americans,
though estimates vary.
Wayne Pines, a spokesman for the 112 DA,
said the agency normally doesn't comment
on new drug applications, which are guarded
as trade secrets. But he confirmed the pro
duct is licensed for experimental use in hu
mans in carefully controlled studies.
But even if ribavirin meets the agency's
strict standards for safety and effectiveness,
approval could take several months or even
years.
