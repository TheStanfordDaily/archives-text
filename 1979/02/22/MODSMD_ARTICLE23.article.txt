## Theater/martha manqueros ACT's 'House' doesn't get past its sets 
### 
On the surface George Ber
nard Shaw's Heartbreak House
is a clever drawing room com
edy: on a deeper level the play
is a bitter social commentary
on decadent upper-crust
Europe at the outbreak of
World War I.
It one were to judge by Ralph
Funicello's ingenious and at
tractive set, one would con
clude that indeed the Ameri
can Conservatory Theatre does
justice to the double
consciousness of the play. The
set is both the slightly de
teriorating fore-deck of a ship,
a metaphor for England, and
the terrace of a country estate.
But even a brilliant set can
not carry the entire weight of
Heartbreak House.
Complicated
The plot is complicated. A
variety of residents and visitors
of the Captain Shotover
household spend one evening
in their customary manner:
breaking each other's hearts
and casually discussing poli
tics.
These characters — a practi
cal businessman, his oppor
tunistic young fiance, her
idealistic father, the reputedly
senile captain, his beautiful,
demanding daughters and an
indolent son-in-law, represent
hope tor England. They are like
drunken skippers who trust
"to Providence. But one of the
ways of Providence with drun
ken skippers is to run them on
the rocks."
Visit
The young opportunist, Ellie
Dunn, her father, Mazzini, and
her practical businessman,
Boss Mangan, visit the
Shotover estate at the request
of Hesione Hushaby®' the cap
tain's dark haired daughter.
Hesione intends to severe the
relationship between her
young friend and Mangan,

while encouraging Ellie to pur
sue a mysterious love named
"Marcus Darnley."
Hesione's gallant husband,
Hector, enters and Ellie recog
nizes him as Marcus. Her con
sequent disillusionment and
quest for personal happiness
set the rest of the play into ac
tion.
Chaotic
Shaw begins Heartbreak
House as a series of chaotic en
counters. One could see, as
Mazzini [Dunn does, that these

",ire very charming people,
most advanced, unprejudiced,
frank, humane, unconven
tional, democratic, free
thinking and everything that is
delightful to thoughtful
people "
And while these "favorable
spec imens of what is best in . . .
Inglish culture" spend time
pulling each other by the nose,
bombs are being dropped,
people are dying in battle.

Director Allen Fletcher, in
advertently or not, emphasizes
the tale ot Ellie's love and bro
ken heart over Shaw's portrait
of useless, decadent behavior
in the Shotover household.
One of Fletcher's greatest mis
takes is in his choice and use of
music. It not only drowns out
some of the dialogue but
blares intrusively during sig
nificant moments of the play. It
orders rather than evokes
emotions from the audience.
At the play's conclusion,

when the estate is being
bombed, Hesione says, "It's
splendid: it's like an orchestra:
it's like Beethoven," Fletcher
actually has Beethoven played
over the speakers. This
glamorizes Hesione's de
praved, ignorant enjoyment of
destruction and throws Shaw's
intentions out with the bath
water.
At other times Fletcher suc
ceeds in revealing the degen

eracy of Heartbreak House, as
Elite dubs it. One even pities
the ruthless Boss Mangan at
the hands of granite-tough El
be. One sees that Hector
Hushaby's intelligence and
sensibilities have been wasted.
The acting in the production
is energetic and, for the most
part, convinc ing. Peter Donat's
Hector Hushabye embodies all
the extravagant posturing of
Heartbreak House with the de
sire and concern to save Eng
land from disaster. Anne Law
der captures Hesion's combi
nations of charm, warmth, and
callousness.
Like Lear
While William Paterson's
Captain Shotover is both cyni
cal and endearing, he's made
up more like King Lear in the
storm than a retired, if eccen
tric, sea captain.
Neither do the costumes
complement the mood of the
play. Hesione's first dress, a
red robe, looks like something
she should be dusting with. All
the costumes are covered by a
thin net of the same color as
the costume, supposedly to
create an illusion of decay. The
net, however, has no effect ex
cept that of making its dark
seams visible on the costumes.
Enjoyable
All in all, ACT Heartbreak
House is enjoyable, but it satis
fies only as a drawing room
comedy with a few political al
lusions; and not as a very seri
ous warning against living
"foolish lives of romance and
sentiment and snobbery;"
against talking and leaving
"everything to Mangan and to
chance and to the devil."
The talented cast and the au
dience deserve something
more than a set which carries
the theme of Heartbreak
House. So does George Ber
nard Shaw.

A scene from the AC I production of Shaw's Heartbreak House, now
in repertory. Pictured, from left to right, are Peter Donat, William
Paterson and Anne Lawder.
On the surface George Ber
nard Shaw's Heartbreak House
is a clever drawing room com
edy: on a deeper level the play
is a bitter social commentary
on decadent upper-crust
Europe at the outbreak of
World War I.
It one were to judge by Ralph
Funicello's ingenious and at
tractive set, one would con
clude that indeed the Ameri
can Conservatory Theatre does
justice to the double
consciousness of the play. The
set is both the slightly de
teriorating fore-deck of a ship,
a metaphor for England, and
the terrace of a country estate.
But even a brilliant set can
not carry the entire weight of
Heartbreak House.
Complicated
The plot is complicated. A
variety of residents and visitors
of the Captain Shotover
household spend one evening
in their customary manner:
breaking each other's hearts
and casually discussing poli
tics.
These characters — a practi
cal businessman, his oppor
tunistic young fiance, her
idealistic father, the reputedly
senile captain, his beautiful,
demanding daughters and an
indolent son-in-law, represent
hope tor England. They are like
drunken skippers who trust
"to Providence. But one of the
ways of Providence with drun
ken skippers is to run them on
the rocks."
Visit
The young opportunist, Ellie
Dunn, her father, Mazzini, and
her practical businessman,
Boss Mangan, visit the
Shotover estate at the request
of Hesione Hushaby®' the cap
tain's dark haired daughter.
Hesione intends to severe the
relationship between her
young friend and Mangan,

while encouraging Ellie to pur
sue a mysterious love named
"Marcus Darnley."
Hesione's gallant husband,
Hector, enters and Ellie recog
nizes him as Marcus. Her con
sequent disillusionment and
quest for personal happiness
set the rest of the play into ac
tion.
Chaotic
Shaw begins Heartbreak
House as a series of chaotic en
counters. One could see, as
Mazzini [Dunn does, that these

",ire very charming people,
most advanced, unprejudiced,
frank, humane, unconven
tional, democratic, free
thinking and everything that is
delightful to thoughtful
people "
And while these "favorable
spec imens of what is best in . . .
Inglish culture" spend time
pulling each other by the nose,
bombs are being dropped,
people are dying in battle.

Director Allen Fletcher, in
advertently or not, emphasizes
the tale ot Ellie's love and bro
ken heart over Shaw's portrait
of useless, decadent behavior
in the Shotover household.
One of Fletcher's greatest mis
takes is in his choice and use of
music. It not only drowns out
some of the dialogue but
blares intrusively during sig
nificant moments of the play. It
orders rather than evokes
emotions from the audience.
At the play's conclusion,

when the estate is being
bombed, Hesione says, "It's
splendid: it's like an orchestra:
it's like Beethoven," Fletcher
actually has Beethoven played
over the speakers. This
glamorizes Hesione's de
praved, ignorant enjoyment of
destruction and throws Shaw's
intentions out with the bath
water.
At other times Fletcher suc
ceeds in revealing the degen

eracy of Heartbreak House, as
Elite dubs it. One even pities
the ruthless Boss Mangan at
the hands of granite-tough El
be. One sees that Hector
Hushaby's intelligence and
sensibilities have been wasted.
The acting in the production
is energetic and, for the most
part, convinc ing. Peter Donat's
Hector Hushabye embodies all
the extravagant posturing of
Heartbreak House with the de
sire and concern to save Eng
land from disaster. Anne Law
der captures Hesion's combi
nations of charm, warmth, and
callousness.
Like Lear
While William Paterson's
Captain Shotover is both cyni
cal and endearing, he's made
up more like King Lear in the
storm than a retired, if eccen
tric, sea captain.
Neither do the costumes
complement the mood of the
play. Hesione's first dress, a
red robe, looks like something
she should be dusting with. All
the costumes are covered by a
thin net of the same color as
the costume, supposedly to
create an illusion of decay. The
net, however, has no effect ex
cept that of making its dark
seams visible on the costumes.
Enjoyable
All in all, ACT Heartbreak
House is enjoyable, but it satis
fies only as a drawing room
comedy with a few political al
lusions; and not as a very seri
ous warning against living
"foolish lives of romance and
sentiment and snobbery;"
against talking and leaving
"everything to Mangan and to
chance and to the devil."
The talented cast and the au
dience deserve something
more than a set which carries
the theme of Heartbreak
House. So does George Ber
nard Shaw.
