## Getting past the cliche 
### 
Days of Heaven, which
opens Friday in Bay Area
theaters, is one of the most
visually beautiful American
movies ever made. Director
Terence Malick and
cinematographers Nestor
Almendros and Haskell
Wexler present the film's
Texas panhandle location as
being made up of twin half
spheres of wheat field and
sky; the result is a feeling of
space and splendor that is
virtually unmatched.
Adrift in the seemingly
endless field is the house of
a wealthy farmer. The huge
Victorian dwelling seems
strangely misplaced: it's as
it it attempts to do battle
with the magnificence of
the environment and loses.
Malick's vision of the
characters in Days of
Heaven works much the
same way: their activities
seem to be drained of mean
ing in the midst of such fer
tility.
Ironic
The story is dryly ironic. A
man, his girlfriend, and his
younger sister leave the
decay of the Chicago slums
to find employment as mig
ratory workers in Texas. Tlie
movie is narrated by the
character of the sister, well
portrayed by Linda Manz.
Her flat, uneducated voice
describes things richer than
she has ever seen. We have
a chance to see the things

she describes and then to
see how they change in her
memory.
The farm at which they
find work is owned by a man
whose doctor tells him he
has only a year to live. When
the farmer shows signs of
interest in the field worker's
girlfriend, the worker en
courages her, saying that, in
a year when the farmer is
dead, she will be able to
make them both wealthy.
Decisions vs. whims
The scheme fails misera
bly when first the girl dis
covers that she is becoming
fond of the farmer, who
treats her with a civility she
has never experienced, and
totally when it becomes
clear, after a year, that the
farmer isn't going to die.
This reinforces Days of
Heaven's main theme:
people's lives are deter
mined less from their deci
sions than by the whims of
nature.
Brooke Adams, seen most
recently as the eye-jigglmg
heroine of Invasion of the
Body Snatchers, gives her
girlfriend/wife character an
air ot abject fatalism that is
one of the best things about
the movie. Adams is an un
usual actress, one who is
not unwilling to allow her
self to appear unattractive if
the role calls for it.
One of the main com

plaints made about Days of
Heaven is that the visuals
overwhelm the characters.
But this, I believe, is exactly
the effect Malick intended:
the richness of nature is
contrasted with the con
cerns of humanity, and, in
the vision Malick presents,
humanity is reduced almost
to insignificance.
And these "overwhelm
ing" visuals are used to
great effect. The farmer's
house is treated almost as if
it were a silent character,
photographed jutting up
from the earth into the sky.
A mesh shrouded sum
merhouse becomes a stage
at night when the shadows
of two lovers are thrown
upon it by a lamp. A field
devoured by locusts is set
on fire, and we watch two
clouds rise from the field:
the insects and the burning
grain.
Malick's American
myth-making is one of the
most ambitious efforts by a
young director to go
beyond the cliche into
something much more
meaningful. The degree to
which he succeeds must be
decided by each viewer, but
it would be difficult not to
see something very special
in Malick's vision of small
lives being played out
against a magnificent, but
unnoticed, setting.
