Mozart: Viola Quintets
Budapest Quartet with Milton Katims and
Walter Trampler, violas.
Odyssey
Anyone with a taste for chamber musk
should have a set of Mozart's string quintets,
which are about the most basic works in the
whole repertoire. Here is an affordable one,
though it's not quite what it seems. Odyssey's
box claims that this is the Budapest's 1%7
cycle with Trampler, but all but one of the
quintets hiding inside are the '40s recordings
with Katims instead.
The recorded sound suffers — it was better,
in fact, on the old Columbia originals — but
the Budapest were more relaxed here than in
either of their remakes. Katims tone is less
"dry" than Trampler's, too.
Mozart: Symphonies 32, 35, 36, tii-41.
Berlin Philharmonic, Herbert Von Karajan,
cond.
DGG
A new set of Mozart's late great symphonies
couldn't fail if it had Von Karajan and a deluxe
DCiG recording, right ? Wrong.
For a start, Karajan gives us a muddy, over
inflated effect instead ot a proper-size sound.

Willi the parts tins out ot balant e, the winds
.iikl l)i.iss seem buried, and the bass-heavy
recording doesn't help.
Big ok hestr.i Mo/art (.111 be 111. ide to work
krips and Mempeier, among others, have
pioven tli.it on record but it doesn't here,
karajan slurs over phrases and dynamic con
trasts and makes his tempi seem curiously
unconvinc ing.
Mendelssohn Qudrlvls, Op. 12, 1 i
Ortord Quartet
London Treasury
Not mut h played or ret orded, these quar
tets, nor have I heard the t ompeting versions
in a Vox Box, I his is a brand-new recording by
the Ortord (Quartet, a Canadian group which
produces a well integrated sound,
I hey manage to play these works very well,
and that's not easy, but the result does fail to
be as c onvinc ing as 1 lie re( ent record of Men
delssohn quintets by another group; I would
investigate the (iuarneri recording of Op. 13
on RCA.
London, by the way, is now pressing the
Treasury series 111 the U.S. I expected the
worst, but the record is actually quite quiet,
marred only by tape hiss on the original mas
ter.
