## Taking the Deadheads to paradise 
### 
My god, what a concert!
There are a lot of cliches
that are invariably thrown
about after a Grateful Dead
concert, i.e. "There is no
thing like a Dead concert,"
and all of them would apply
to Saturday's show at the
Oakland Coliseum.
But this show in particular
was something more than
that. Deadheads all around
me seemed to concur that
Saturday was especially
good. It being my first Dead
concert, I had little to com
pare it with. However, if
crowd reaction is any indi
cation, the show was not
just a concert, it was an
event. (Sorry, some cliches
just can't be avoided.)
The Dead were really
"on" Saturday, and
everyone in the Coliseum
knew it — especially the

Dead. And they milked the
evening for all it was worth,
delivering three and a half
hours of mostly good-time
rock and roll. With the ex
ception of Donna God
chaux, who had occasional
trouble with cues and her
voice, every member of the
band delivered nearly a
flawless performance.
With Jerry Garcia blazing
a trail with his lead guitar,
the band took the audience
on a journey through the
drug-oriented lands of sun
shine daydreams.
Imploring the crowd to
follow them through their
musical fantasyland, they
asked, "Won't you try just a
little bit harder, couldn't
you try just a little bit
more?"
It all boils down to com
munication. That's part of

what the Dead are all about.
Communication between
the group's members and
communication between
them and the audience.
Carcia's solos aren't just
musical interludes, they're
Shakespearean soliloquies.
Phil Lesh doesn't play nearly
sub-sonic bass notes just to
keep the beat, he sym
bolizes the raw power in
rock by delivering almost
single-frequency tones that
shook the entire building —
literally.
Bob Weir's crisp chord
work isn't just the way he
plays rhythm guitar, it's an
expression of the energy he
exudes every time he steps
on stage. And Mickey Hart
and Bill Kreutzman don't
just play a percussion solo,
they fight fierce, strained
battles as they build more

and more complex rhythms
into each other's creations.
And then there are the
songs themselves. The
Dead played some of their
best Saturday, including ex
cellent versions of
"Bertha," "Railroad Blues,"
"Mexicali Blues," "Mama
Tried," "Terrapin Station,"
"Sugar Magnolia," "One
More Saturday Night,"
"Friend of th» Devil," "I
Need a Miracle,"
"Shakedown Street" and
"Playin' in the Band."
And when it was all over,
and the sellout crowd very
slowly and reluctantly filed
out, one recurring scene
struck me. Couples,
Deadheads all, embraced
tightly and smiled serenely.
It was like they had just
seen paradise.
And perhaps they had.
