## Comedy spotlighted here 
### 
Stand-up comedy has finally hit The Farm.
While virtually every other form of entertain
ment, from string quartets to mimes, has ap
peared on campus, comedy has been all but
overlooked.
On March 1, in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
"Class Clowns, an Evening of Comedy at Stan
ford" will end this comedic drought, spotlight
ing four brilliant Bay Area acts.
Among the madcaps in this comedy ex
travaganza is 23-year-old Dana Carvey, a suc
cessful San Francisco comic and last year's win
ner of the San Francisco International Stand-up
Comedy Competition.
"College crowds are great to play," said Car-

vey. "I can do subtler material with great suc
cess. I'm looking forward to playing here."
Along with Carvey will be Bill Farley, a New
Yorker transplanted to the Bay Area. Farley took
first place in the first Stand-up comedy competi
tion, while second place went to the then un
known Robin Williams. Farley studied theater at
Saint John's University and The American
Academy of Dramatic Arts and has since done
radio, television, commercials and has ap
peared in over 50 night clubs.
Bill Rafferty has also done theater, radio, and
appeared in numerous night clubs in New York,
Los Angeles as well as San Francisco. Perhaps his
widest exposure, though, came while he was a
regular on George Schlatter's Laugh-In '77.
Rounding out the show is Lorenzo and S.O.S.
a seven member team of Bay Area comedians.
Their act combines the traditional attitudes and
techniques of San Francisco improvisation with
the zaniness of today's stand-up comedy.

With the recent successes of many stand-up
comedians like Steve Martin, Robin Williams
and Andy Kaufman, stand-up comedy is
stronger than ever, and San Francisco has be
come a comedian's paradise.
"I think it is one of the best places to really get
your stuff together," says Carvey of working in
San Francisco. "In L.A. there's about a thousand
comedians working and you get to do five mi
nutes a week. Up here, if you're good, you can
work two hours a week."
Many San Francisco night spots feature com
edy acts, and some clubs, like the Holy City Zoo
and The Punch Line deal almost exclusively with
comedy. Many of these clubs also feature

"Open-mike" nights where amateurs can get a
chance to perform in front of an audience.
Often, there is a secret desire among the
comedians appearing in these clubs that they
will be discovered and offered a television role
(like Robin Williams and Andy Kaufman ).
Farley recalls a female comedian he saw in
L.A. at an "open-mike" night who he thought
had a good act. "I came back, I bet it was a year
later, she was doing the same five minutes. They
are so paranoid that on the night they choose to
do a different five minutes, Norman Lear will be
in the audience or something,,"
Both Carvey and Farley are prpsent/y being
considered by one of the networks for upcom
ing pilots.
"Class Clowns" will be a new type of experi
ence for the Stanford community and as a
bonus, the show will be videotaped for later
broadcast.
