# 'U.S. responsible for Cuban foreign policy'
## Cuban U.N. advisor supports Vietnam 
### Rebecca Moss 
Vietnam was justified in attacking
Cambodia, but China's recent inva
sion of Vietnam should be con
demned, Alfredo Almeida, political

advisor to the Cuban mission at the
United Nations, said in a speech here
Tuesday.
"Everyone knew as long as six
months ago that Cambodia was at
tacking Vietnam. Cambodia should
be condemned because they were
the aggressors." Almeida said
through his translator Paul Bundy, in
a question and answer period follow
ing his short speech on Cuban
foreign policy sponsored in part by
the Dept. of Spanish and Por
tuguese.
"We can't be neutral in the case of
Vietnam," he said. "Cuba will always
be with Vietnam wherever the ag
gressions come from."
Cuba's support of Vietnam is
based on Cuban interests, despite
the inability of some people to "con
ceiveof Cubahavingan independent
strategy of its own," Almeida said.
He stressed that Cuba was not not a
"puppet" of any other world power.
He said the United States treat
ment of Cuba was directly responsi
ble for Cuban foreign policy, which
he described as "a reaction against

imperialism, colonialism, neo
colonialism, fascism, Zionism, un
equal exchange and the exploitation
of underdeveloped countries."
By cutting off oil supplies and re
fusing to buy sugar from Cuba,
America put Cuba in a position
where the only option they had to
save their economy was to put them
selves "in the Soviet satellite."
The United States will have to take
a first step of lifting the embargoes
currently in force if diplomatic rela
tions between the two countries are
to be restored. The blockade is
"non-functional," he said, and must
be lifted "in order for anything to
change."
He went on to say that "Cuba re
solutely supports all national libera
tion movements, just struggles and
the progressive forces throughout
the world."
Almeida justified Cuba's interven
tion in Africa as a result of resolutions
passed by the United Nations (calling
forthe complete decolonialization of
Africa.
Asked why Cuba was in Ethiopia,

he said that when Ethiopia was in
vaded by Somalia the revolutionary
Ethiopian government asked for as
sistance. "Cuba responded," he
said.
Asked why Cuba doesn't support
Latin America groups the way that it
supports African groups, Almeida re
sponded by saying, "America has a
magnifying class on Cuba."
He continued by saying that the
whole direction of Cuban foreign
policy is to "let any revolutionary
know that he can count on Cuba for
help." He added that he didn't know
of any Latin American group that
Cuba wouldn't support.
When asked what kind of support
Cuba had offered the Palestinian
Liberation Organization and the
anti-Somoza forces in Nicaragua, he
said with a chuckle, "Let the CIA do
its own homework."
Cuba also offers support for
peaceful movements against im
perialism, he said, "Cuba is in ag
reement with social democracy and
Cuba will always give support in
fighting against a fascist regime."
