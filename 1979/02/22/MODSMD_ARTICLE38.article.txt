Iran releases U.S. marine
Tehran, Iran — Under strong pressure from
the United States, Iran's new revolutionary
government yesterday released a young
American Marine accused of firing on Iranians
who invaded the U.S. Embassy.
Sgt. Ken Kraus, 22, of Lansdale, Pa., who had
maintained that none of the embassy's guards
"fired a shot," was driven through the gates of
embassy compound last night after one week
as a "prisoner of the revolution." He showed
no sign of ill treatment.
White House spokesman Jody Powell said
President Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance "had made it their No. 1 priority"
to free Kraus.
Kraus' arrest coincided with a demand from
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolutionary
committee for the extradition from the United
States of Gen. Gholam-Ali Oveissi, former
martial law governor of Tehran.
Oveissi's riot troops forcibly suppressed
anti-shah demonstrations following last Sep
tember's imposition of martial law. He flew to
the United States early last month, ostensibly
for medical treatment.
U.S. Ambassador William Sullivan, briefly
held hostage by leftist guerrillas who invaded
the embassy Feb. 14, was understood to have
been in contact all day with the provisional
government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan
to win Kraus's release.
Kraus was slightly wounded in the embassy
attack and, according to eyewitnesses, was
moved from an Iranian hospital that same day
and taken for questioning to Khomeini's re
volutionary committee.
New Mideast peace talks start
Washington — Egyptian and Israeli
negotiators opened new Mideast peace talks
yesterday under U.S. auspices with a joint
pledge to complete a peace treaty as soon as
possible.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance took charge
of the meetings at rustic Camp David, in the
snow-bound Catoctin mountains of Maryland,
but there was no word on whether new U.S.
proposals were introduced to break the stale
mate.
According to a joint statement, Vance, Egyp
tian Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil and Israeli
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan began the talks
with a reaffirmation of "their determination to

bend their best efforts toward successful com
pletion of the negotiations as soon as possi
ble."
A news blackout ordered by President
Jimmy Carter kept reporters and photo
graphers away from the 147-acre retreat where
the negotiations will be held in seclusion at
least through the weekend.
The blackout, aimed at preventing "leaks"
to the public, appeared to be firmly in place.
Carter's expressed hope is that secrecy will
promote a settlement.
State Department spokesman Hodding Car
ter said he could not discuss any proposals that
may be under discussion or whether Vance
had presented any new ideas in the effort to
find agreement on the treaty.
The jo.int statement read to reporters at a
midday briefing here said the atmosphere at
Camp David was warm and informal. Spokes
man Carter said he did not know when the
president might join the discussions or how
long the talks would last.
Study finds Viet army strong
London — China has more than five times as
many troops as Vietnam, but the smaller na
tion's military has newer weapons and is rated
as one of the world's best fighting forces.
The Institute of Strategic Studies' latest an
nual report, "The Military Balance," published
last September, noted that China's military
equipment is from 10 to 20 years out of date.
Other commentators have said that Vietnam
is now one of the best-armed and most heavily
armed countries in the world, with up-to-date
Soviet weapons and a vast quantity of arma
ments abandoned by the United States when it
withdrew from the Vietnam war.
The London-based Institute is an indepen
dent group of specialists in military analysis
with an international staff whose reports are
studied by governments in the East and West.
The army numbers of China and Vietnam are
put at 3,625,000 and 600,000 respectively by the
Institute.
Clare Hollingworth, defense correspondent
of the London Daily Telegraph, who has lived
in Peking and reported many wars in the last 40
years, said yesterday that Vietnam has boosted
its army to almost 850,000 in the last two or
three years. Quoting Japanese military sources
who recently visited Hanoi, she said, "Vietnam
is now the best-defended country in the Far
East, perhaps in the world."

Convention measure vote today
Sacramento — On the eve of today's Assem
bly committee vote on a constitutional con
vention measure to balance the federal
budget, the Assembly's Democratic and Re
publican leaders were both optimistic.
"It's my strong feeling that a majority of the
committee will not agree to a constitutional
convention call," Speaker Leo McCarthy
(D-San Francisco', the leading opponent, said
yesterday.
"I have a feeling that the resolution's in very
good shape," Minority Leader Paul Priolo,
(R-Malibu) a strong supporter, said at a sepa
rate news conference.
The two were talking about a vote scheduled
in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee
on resolutions demanding that Congress call a
constitutional convention to draft an amend
ment requiring a balanced federal budget.
Congress must call a convention if 34 of the
50 states demand it. The National Taxpayers
Union says 26 states have passed such resolu
tions, but Congress has not received that
many.
Highway building boost asked
Sacramento — The Brown administration
yesterday proposed giving a $1.2 billion-plus
boost to state and local highway building,
maintenance and transit systems over the next
five years.
Two top Brown officials, highway director
Adriana Cianturco and state Business and
Transportation Agency Director Alan Stein,
said the hike would come mainly from federal
money and increased state truck fees.
Both denied the proposal stemmed from
continued legislative criticism that Gov. Jerry
Brown's administration has gone too slow on
highway projects at a time when inflation is
shrinking funds.
"I don't think there will ever bean end to the
call for new highways," said Stein in response
to a question of whether this proposal would
satisfy legislative critics.
The proposal, if approved by the Legislature,
would be on top of the state's existing $6.3
billion five-year highway program, pushing it
to $7.5 billion.
"This does speed up the spending...l would
hope the Legislature would examine this
proposal with some care and help us get it

through," said Cianturco, director of the state
Department of Transportation.
Department staff said that $769 million
would be added to state highway programs
and $500 million to local programs if the Legis
lature approves the addition.
Captain dies in police strike
New Orleans — A police captain died of a
heart attack yesterday after 20 hours on duty as
New Orleans showed signs of weariness from
a police strike that has dulled the Carnival and
Mardi Cras spirit.
The strike has led to cancellation of all re
maining Carnival and Mardi Cras parades in
the city, and hotels were reporting tourist can
cellations as well.
Meanwhile, federal mediator Ansell Garrett
met with representatives of the mayor and the
Teamsters-affiliated Policemen's Association
of Louisiana for new talks on non-economic
strike issues.
The Civil Service Commission was also re
ported meeting. It alone can consider police
wage and benefits demands. It was not known
if the police were involved in the meeting.
Capt. Thomas Albert Sr., 49, head of the Bth
District, collapsed and died after suffering a
heart attack. Officials said he had been work
ing for nearly a full day without relief.
At a trial in Civil District Court, Judge Richard
Garvey ruled the strike illegal and issued a
permanent back-to-work order. A temporary
order had been ignored by nearly 1200 of the
city's 1500 policemen.

coasted to a stop.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
closed unchanged at 834.55 after a 7.54-point
rise on Tuesday.
Big Board volume totaled 26.05 million

Iran releases U.S. marine
Tehran, Iran — Under strong pressure from
the United States, Iran's new revolutionary
government yesterday released a young
American Marine accused of firing on Iranians
who invaded the U.S. Embassy.
Sgt. Ken Kraus, 22, of Lansdale, Pa., who had
maintained that none of the embassy's guards
"fired a shot," was driven through the gates of
embassy compound last night after one week
as a "prisoner of the revolution." He showed
no sign of ill treatment.
White House spokesman Jody Powell said
President Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance "had made it their No. 1 priority"
to free Kraus.
Kraus' arrest coincided with a demand from
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolutionary
committee for the extradition from the United
States of Gen. Gholam-Ali Oveissi, former
martial law governor of Tehran.
Oveissi's riot troops forcibly suppressed
anti-shah demonstrations following last Sep

the United States early last month, ostensibly
for medical treatment.
U.S. Ambassador William Sullivan, briefly
held hostage by leftist guerrillas who invaded
the embassy Feb. 14, was understood to have
been in contact all day with the provisional
government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan
to win Kraus's release.
Kraus was slightly wounded in the embassy
attack and, according to eyewitnesses, was
moved from an Iranian hospital that same day
and taken for questioning to Khomeini's re
volutionary committee.

Study finds Viet army strong

The Institute of Strategic Studies' latest an

Highway building boost asked
Sacramento — The Brown administration
yesterday proposed giving a $1.2 billion-plus
boost to state and local highway building,
maintenance and transit systems over the next
five years.
Two top Brown officials, highway director
Adriana Cianturco and state Business and
Transportation Agency Director Alan Stein,
said the hike would come mainly from federal
money and increased state truck fees.
Both denied the proposal stemmed from
continued legislative criticism that Gov. Jerry
Brown's administration has gone too slow on
highway projects at a time when inflation is
shrinking funds.
"I don't think there will ever bean end to the
call for new highways," said Stein in response
to a question of whether this proposal would
satisfy legislative critics.
The proposal, if approved by the Legislature,
would be on top of the state's existing $6.3
billion five-year highway program, pushing it
to $7.5 billion.
"This does speed up the spending...l would
hope the Legislature would examine this
proposal with some care and help us get it

through," said Cianturco, director of the state
Department of Transportation.
Department staff said that $769 million
would be added to state highway programs
and $500 million to local programs if the Legis

Highway building boost asked
Sacramento — The Brown administration
yesterday proposed giving a $1.2 billion-plus
boost to state and local highway building,
maintenance and transit systems over the next
five years.
Two top Brown officials, highway director
Adriana Cianturco and state Business and
Transportation Agency Director Alan Stein,
said the hike would come mainly from federal
money and increased state truck fees.
Both denied the proposal stemmed from
continued legislative criticism that Gov. Jerry
Brown's administration has gone too slow on
highway projects at a time when inflation is
shrinking funds.
"I don't think there will ever bean end to the
call for new highways," said Stein in response
to a question of whether this proposal would
satisfy legislative critics.
The proposal, if approved by the Legislature,
would be on top of the state's existing $6.3
billion five-year highway program, pushing it
to $7.5 billion.
"This does speed up the spending...l would
hope the Legislature would examine this
proposal with some care and help us get it

through," said Cianturco, director of the state
Department of Transportation.
Department staff said that $769 million
would be added to state highway programs
and $500 million to local programs if the Legis
lature approves the addition.
Captain dies in police strike
New Orleans — A police captain died of a
heart attack yesterday after 20 hours on duty as
New Orleans showed signs of weariness from
a police strike that has dulled the Carnival and
Mardi Cras spirit.
The strike has led to cancellation of all re
maining Carnival and Mardi Cras parades in
the city, and hotels were reporting tourist can
cellations as well.
Meanwhile, federal mediator Ansell Garrett
met with representatives of the mayor and the
Teamsters-affiliated Policemen's Association
of Louisiana for new talks on non-economic
strike issues.
The Civil Service Commission was also re
ported meeting. It alone can consider police
wage and benefits demands. It was not known
if the police were involved in the meeting.
Capt. Thomas Albert Sr., 49, head of the Bth
District, collapsed and died after suffering a
heart attack. Officials said he had been work
ing for nearly a full day without relief.
At a trial in Civil District Court, Judge Richard
Garvey ruled the strike illegal and issued a
permanent back-to-work order. A temporary
order had been ignored by nearly 1200 of the
city's 1500 policemen.

Iran releases U.S. marine
Tehran, Iran — Under strong pressure from
the United States, Iran's new revolutionary
government yesterday released a young
American Marine accused of firing on Iranians
who invaded the U.S. Embassy.
Sgt. Ken Kraus, 22, of Lansdale, Pa., who had
maintained that none of the embassy's guards
"fired a shot," was driven through the gates of
embassy compound last night after one week
as a "prisoner of the revolution." He showed
no sign of ill treatment.
White House spokesman Jody Powell said
President Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance "had made it their No. 1 priority"
to free Kraus.
Kraus' arrest coincided with a demand from
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolutionary
committee for the extradition from the United
States of Gen. Gholam-Ali Oveissi, former
martial law governor of Tehran.
Oveissi's riot troops forcibly suppressed
anti-shah demonstrations following last Sep
tember's imposition of martial law. He flew to
the United States early last month, ostensibly
for medical treatment.
U.S. Ambassador William Sullivan, briefly
held hostage by leftist guerrillas who invaded
the embassy Feb. 14, was understood to have
been in contact all day with the provisional
government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan
to win Kraus's release.
Kraus was slightly wounded in the embassy
attack and, according to eyewitnesses, was
moved from an Iranian hospital that same day
and taken for questioning to Khomeini's re
volutionary committee.
New Mideast peace talks start
Washington — Egyptian and Israeli
negotiators opened new Mideast peace talks
yesterday under U.S. auspices with a joint
pledge to complete a peace treaty as soon as
possible.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance took charge
of the meetings at rustic Camp David, in the
snow-bound Catoctin mountains of Maryland,
but there was no word on whether new U.S.
proposals were introduced to break the stale
mate.
According to a joint statement, Vance, Egyp
tian Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil and Israeli
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan began the talks
with a reaffirmation of "their determination to

bend their best efforts toward successful com
pletion of the negotiations as soon as possi
ble."
A news blackout ordered by President
Jimmy Carter kept reporters and photo
graphers away from the 147-acre retreat where
the negotiations will be held in seclusion at
least through the weekend.
The blackout, aimed at preventing "leaks"
to the public, appeared to be firmly in place.
Carter's expressed hope is that secrecy will
promote a settlement.
State Department spokesman Hodding Car
ter said he could not discuss any proposals that
may be under discussion or whether Vance
had presented any new ideas in the effort to
find agreement on the treaty.
The jo.int statement read to reporters at a
midday briefing here said the atmosphere at
Camp David was warm and informal. Spokes
man Carter said he did not know when the
president might join the discussions or how
long the talks would last.
Study finds Viet army strong
London — China has more than five times as
many troops as Vietnam, but the smaller na
tion's military has newer weapons and is rated
as one of the world's best fighting forces.
The Institute of Strategic Studies' latest an
nual report, "The Military Balance," published
last September, noted that China's military
equipment is from 10 to 20 years out of date.
Other commentators have said that Vietnam
is now one of the best-armed and most heavily
armed countries in the world, with up-to-date
Soviet weapons and a vast quantity of arma
ments abandoned by the United States when it
withdrew from the Vietnam war.
The London-based Institute is an indepen
dent group of specialists in military analysis
with an international staff whose reports are
studied by governments in the East and West.
The army numbers of China and Vietnam are
put at 3,625,000 and 600,000 respectively by the
Institute.
Clare Hollingworth, defense correspondent
of the London Daily Telegraph, who has lived
in Peking and reported many wars in the last 40
years, said yesterday that Vietnam has boosted
its army to almost 850,000 in the last two or
three years. Quoting Japanese military sources
who recently visited Hanoi, she said, "Vietnam
is now the best-defended country in the Far
East, perhaps in the world."

Convention measure vote today
