## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
All-America high school quarterback John
Elway yesterday signed a letter of intent to
play football here this fall.
The 6-3,180-lb. Elway, from Granada Hills
High School in the Los Angeles area, was
rated the No. 1 quarterback in the nation by
two major publications, Parade Magazine
and Football News and made all five high
school All-America teams this year.
"The offense that Stanford has uses a lot
of passing," Elway said. "I like to throw; I
threw a lot in high school and I want to be
able to continue in college. Stanford's of
fense will permit me to do that."
Elway completed 129 of 200 passes for
1837 yards and 19 touchdowns in five games
this year before suffering a knee injury that
took him out for the rest of the season. The
year before he passed for 3039 yards and 25
touchdowns.
Head football coach Rod Dowhower
said, "Elway is the finest quarterback in the
country this year and one of the best I've
ever seen."
But Elway has no plans for instant star
dom. "I have to start at the bottom and work
my way up," he said.
Elway said he was recruited by Missouri,
Washington, USC, Notre Dame and San
Jose State, where his father, Jack Elway, is

the new football coach.
Besides Stanford's passing-oriented of
fense, the University's proximity to his
California home and the quality of the
coaching staff were important factors in his
decision to sign, Elway said.
He said he intends to pursue economics
or a related field in his undergraduate work
here.
"We recruited all positions, but if we
were able to do any one thing, it was to
recruit players with speed," Dowhower
said. "I doubt if Stanford has ever recruited
as fine a group of offensive and defensive
backs as we did this year."
According to Gary Cavalli, director of
sports publicity, the few recent changes in
the coaching staff did not affect recruiting.
"A good portion of the staff didn't
change," he said. "If we had eight coaches
leave and eight new ones come, then there
would be a problem, but we retained five of
our eight coaches."
Cavalli said that most of the coaches re
tained their recruiting areas and did a good
job of scouting and signing the local
athletes.
"The one area where we had a change
was the Midwest," he said. (Asst. Football
Coach) Al Lavan got in there quickly enough
that we didn't lose any of the kids (former

Asst. Football Coach) Denny Green had laid
the groundwork with."
Other offensive backs who have signed
letters of intent are halfback Vincent White
of Mullen Prep (Denver, Col.), fullback Rob
Moore of Foothill High (Santa Ana, Calif.)
and halfback Mike Dotterer of Edison High
(Huntington Beach, Calif.), the Orange
County Back of the Year.
White, like Elway, was on all five prep
All-America teams. He rushed for2l39yards
last fall and led his team to the state AAA
title. He has been named Colorado Player of
the Year twice and made first team All-State.
White's 5-8, 175 lbs. dimensions are the
same as current Stanford star Darrin Nel
son.
Moore was named to the Parade and
Scholastic Coach All-America teams. Dot
terer rushed for 1200 yards and 14
touchdowns last fall. He is also rated an
outstanding prep outfielder, giving him the
distinction of one of the nation's top two
sport athletes.
Stanford also signed halfback Robert
Mitchell of Washington D.C. His father is
All-Pro player Bobby Mitchell.
Stanford signed nine out-of-state players
in all, all of whom earned first-team All-
State honors in their respective states. They
are White and safety Kevin Baird (Cherry

Creek High) from Colorado; halfback Kevin
MacMillan (Portland Grant) and fullback Jim
Solberg (Corvallis) from Oregon; wide re
ceiver Marty Martinez (Birmingham Brother
Rice) from Michigan; linebacker Louis Ar
vanetes (Upper Arlington) from Columbus,
Ohio; tight end/tackle Chris Rose (Red
Bank) from New Jersey; linebacker Gary
Wimmer (Boise Capitol) from Idaho; and
center Mike Teeuws (North Central) from
Indianapolis, Indiana.
Both Rose and Solberg were named to
one prep All-America team, giving Stanford
a total of five All-America players.
California recruits in addition to Elway,
Moore and Dotterer include All-CIF tackles
Frank Dispalatro (St. Paul in Whittier) and
Ken Cunz (San Marino); All-CIF tight end
Chris Dressel (El Dorado), Orange County
Lineman of the Year; All-City linebacker
Charles Collins (Banning); AII-CCS defen
sive lineman Dennis Engel (Santa Clara), All
Nor-Cal tackle Ken Orvick (Rio American,
Sacramento); AII-CCS fullback Greg
Hooper (Fremont); AII-CCS linebacker Jack
Snyder (Cubberley); and guard Steve
Aimonetti (Campbell.)
"In terms of overall quality, this had to be
one of the finest years Stanford has had,"
Dowhower said. "I know it's the best we've
done in my three years here."

and Football News and made all five high
school All-America teams this year.
"The offense that Stanford has uses a lot
of passing," Elway said. "I like to throw; I
threw a lot in high school and I want to be
able to continue in college. Stanford's of
fense will permit me to do that."
Elway completed 129 of 200 passes for
1837 yards and 19 touchdowns in five games
this year before suffering a knee injury that
took him out for the rest of the season. The
year before he passed for 3039 yards and 25
touchdowns.
Head football coach Rod Dowhower
said, "Elway is the finest quarterback in the
country this year and one of the best I've
ever seen."
But Elway has no plans for instant star
dom. "I have to start at the bottom and work
my way up," he said.
Elway said he was recruited by Missouri,
Washington, USC, Notre Dame and San
Jose State, where his father, Jack Elway, is

the new football coach.
Besides Stanford's passing-oriented of
fense, the University's proximity to his
California home and the quality of the
coaching staff were important factors in his
decision to sign, Elway said.
He said he intends to pursue economics
or a related field in his undergraduate work
here.
"We recruited all positions, but if we
were able to do any one thing, it was to
recruit players with speed," Dowhower
said. "I doubt if Stanford has ever recruited
as fine a group of offensive and defensive
backs as we did this year."
According to Gary Cavalli, director of
sports publicity, the few recent changes in
the coaching staff did not affect recruiting.
"A good portion of the staff didn't
change," he said. "If we had eight coaches
leave and eight new ones come, then there
would be a problem, but we retained five of
our eight coaches."
Cavalli said that most of the coaches re
tained their recruiting areas and did a good
job of scouting and signing the local
athletes.
"The one area where we had a change
was the Midwest," he said. (Asst. Football
Coach) Al Lavan got in there quickly enough
that we didn't lose any of the kids (former

Asst. Football Coach) Denny Green had laid
the groundwork with."
Other offensive backs who have signed
letters of intent are halfback Vincent White
of Mullen Prep (Denver, Col.), fullback Rob
Moore of Foothill High (Santa Ana, Calif.)
and halfback Mike Dotterer of Edison High
(Huntington Beach, Calif.), the Orange
County Back of the Year.
White, like Elway, was on all five prep
All-America teams. He rushed for2l39yards
last fall and led his team to the state AAA
title. He has been named Colorado Player of
the Year twice and made first team All-State.
White's 5-8, 175 lbs. dimensions are the
same as current Stanford star Darrin Nel
son.
Moore was named to the Parade and
Scholastic Coach All-America teams. Dot
terer rushed for 1200 yards and 14
touchdowns last fall. He is also rated an
outstanding prep outfielder, giving him the
distinction of one of the nation's top two
sport athletes.
Stanford also signed halfback Robert
Mitchell of Washington D.C. His father is
All-Pro player Bobby Mitchell.
Stanford signed nine out-of-state players
in all, all of whom earned first-team All-
State honors in their respective states. They
are White and safety Kevin Baird (Cherry

Creek High) from Colorado; halfback Kevin
MacMillan (Portland Grant) and fullback Jim
Solberg (Corvallis) from Oregon; wide re
ceiver Marty Martinez (Birmingham Brother
Rice) from Michigan; linebacker Louis Ar
vanetes (Upper Arlington) from Columbus,
Ohio; tight end/tackle Chris Rose (Red
Bank) from New Jersey; linebacker Gary
Wimmer (Boise Capitol) from Idaho; and
center Mike Teeuws (North Central) from
Indianapolis, Indiana.
Both Rose and Solberg were named to
one prep All-America team, giving Stanford
a total of five All-America players.
California recruits in addition to Elway,
Moore and Dotterer include All-CIF tackles
Frank Dispalatro (St. Paul in Whittier) and
Ken Cunz (San Marino); All-CIF tight end
Chris Dressel (El Dorado), Orange County
Lineman of the Year; All-City linebacker
Charles Collins (Banning); AII-CCS defen
sive lineman Dennis Engel (Santa Clara), All
Nor-Cal tackle Ken Orvick (Rio American,
Sacramento); AII-CCS fullback Greg
Hooper (Fremont); AII-CCS linebacker Jack
Snyder (Cubberley); and guard Steve
Aimonetti (Campbell.)
"In terms of overall quality, this had to be
one of the finest years Stanford has had,"
Dowhower said. "I know it's the best we've
done in my three years here."
All-America high school quarterback John
Elway yesterday signed a letter of intent to
play football here this fall.
The 6-3,180-lb. Elway, from Granada Hills
High School in the Los Angeles area, was
rated the No. 1 quarterback in the nation by
two major publications, Parade Magazine
and Football News and made all five high
school All-America teams this year.
