# Chinese plan for showdown
## Viet-China war escalates 
### 
- Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — Tens of
thousands of Vietnamese and
Chinese troops backed by heavy ar
tillery were on the move yesterday
toward the Vietnamese town of Lang
Son and in what could be the show
down battle of the five-day-old bor
der war, intelligence sources in
Bangkok reported.
The sources said Chinese
strategists apparently intend to deal a
final bloody blow to the Vietnamese
military and then to withdraw most of
their forces from Vietnam within
three or four days.
Japan's Kyodo news service
quoted a government official in Pek
ing as saying China hopes to end the
conflict within,a few days, but the
unidentified orficial warned that it
might be prolonged if Vietnam
throws its regular army troops into
the fighting.
Vietnam moves regulars
That appeared to be just what
Hanoi was doing yesterday, as col
umns of regular army reinforce
ments were reported rolling north
toward Vietnamese-held Lang Son, a
strategically situated town that for
centuries has guarded the ap
proaches from China.
The troops apparently were reliev
ing battered militia units that bore
the defensive burden for the first
three days of fighting.
Chinese atrocities
The Soviet news agency Tass,
meanwhile, said in a report from
Hanoi that Chinese troops commit
ted atrocities against Vietnamese
civilians in areas they captured. Tass,
quoting Vietnamese news reports,
charged that the Chinese burned
down villages and shot men, women
and children.
A reporter for the Soviet news
paper Pravda, in a dispatch from Lang
Son, also described alleged Chinese
atrocities, saying that in one incident
troops stopped a bus on a provincial
road and executed all its passengers.
The invasion force that struck ac
ross the border last Saturday is re
ported to have penetrated as far as 12

miles into Vietnamese territory along
the 450-mile border.
Heavy casualties
The Vietnamese claim to have kil
led 5000 to 8000 Chinese soldiers, a
figure intelligence sources in
Bangkok consider inflated. These
sources say Vietnamese losses have
been much heavier than the
Chinese.
A British Broadcasting Corp. cor
respondent in Peking, citing reliable
sources there, said that in the first
two days of fighting the Chinese in
flicted losses of 10,000 dead and
wounded on the Vietnamese while
suffering 2000 to 3000 casualties
themselves.
Invaders thwarted
Radio Hanoi said a Chinese divison
Tuesday tried to push deeper into
the coastal province of Quang Ninh,
in an area 50 miles east of Lang Son
and a few miles from the sea, but was
driven back with "700 Chinese ag
gressors wiped out."
The Vietnamese also reported re
pulsing a Chinese attack north of
Lang Son on Tuesday.
Yesterday, three Chinese infantry
divisions backed up by tanks were on
the move through Quang Ninh
again, apparently planning to swing
inland to stage a "lightning strikes"
to cut off the highway supply routes
linking the defenders of Lang Son
with Hanoi, sources here said.
Journalists on the Vietnamese side
of the front reported that regular

army reinforcements rushed to Lang
Son Tuesday and yesterday to take
over from the militias. Reporter
Kazuhisa Ikawa of the Tokyo news
paper Asahi reported seeing Viet
namese trucks loaded with troops
and hauling 105 mm artillery headed
toward Lang Son from Don Mo, 40
miles from the frontier. He wrote
that columns of refugees poured
south along the highway, and that at
least 33,000 of Lang Son's 46,000 in
habitants had fled.
Vietnamese units stationed in
northern Laos were being pulled
back into northwest Vietnam's re
mote Hoang Lien Son Province,
whose major town, Lao Cai, was cap
tured by the Chinese Tuesday, the
Bangkok sources said.
Tass said the Vietnam News
Agency reported that Vietnamese ar
tillerymen destroyed pontoon
bridges the Chinese were using to
cross the Red and Nmthi rivers in the
northwest.
Final plans
The Bangkok sources, who asked
not to be identified, said they believe
China will withdraw most of its
troops from Vietnam within three or
four days after a final all-out assault.
They said many Chinese units have
been pulling out of the sparsely
populated, mountainous provinces
of Ha Tuyen and Cao Bang, leaving
behind smaller units to hold border
enclaves inside Vietnam, possibly as
bargaining chips after a cease-fire.

civilians in areas they captured. Tass,
quoting Vietnamese news reports,
charged that the Chinese burned
down villages and shot men, women
and children.
A reporter for the Soviet news
paper Pravda, in a dispatch from Lang
Son, also described alleged Chinese
atrocities, saying that in one incident
troops stopped a bus on a provincial
road and executed all its passengers.
The invasion force that struck ac

miles into Vietnamese territory along

Heavy casualties
The Vietnamese claim to have kil
led 5000 to 8000 Chinese soldiers, a
figure intelligence sources in
Bangkok consider inflated. These
sources say Vietnamese losses have
been much heavier than the
Chinese.
A British Broadcasting Corp. cor
respondent in Peking, citing reliable
sources there, said that in the first
two days of fighting the Chinese in
flicted losses of 10,000 dead and
wounded on the Vietnamese while
suffering 2000 to 3000 casualties
themselves.
Invaders thwarted
Radio Hanoi said a Chinese divison
Tuesday tried to push deeper into
the coastal province of Quang Ninh,
in an area 50 miles east of Lang Son
and a few miles from the sea, but was
driven back with "700 Chinese ag
gressors wiped out."
The Vietnamese also reported re
pulsing a Chinese attack north of
Lang Son on Tuesday.
Yesterday, three Chinese infantry
divisions backed up by tanks were on
the move through Quang Ninh
again, apparently planning to swing
inland to stage a "lightning strikes"
to cut off the highway supply routes
linking the defenders of Lang Son
with Hanoi, sources here said.
Journalists on the Vietnamese side
of the front reported that regular

army reinforcements rushed to Lang
Son Tuesday and yesterday to take
over from the militias. Reporter
Kazuhisa Ikawa of the Tokyo news
paper Asahi reported seeing Viet
namese trucks loaded with troops
and hauling 105 mm artillery headed
toward Lang Son from Don Mo, 40
miles from the frontier. He wrote
that columns of refugees poured
south along the highway, and that at
least 33,000 of Lang Son's 46,000 in
habitants had fled.
Vietnamese units stationed in
northern Laos were being pulled
back into northwest Vietnam's re
mote Hoang Lien Son Province,
whose major town, Lao Cai, was cap
tured by the Chinese Tuesday, the
Bangkok sources said.
Tass said the Vietnam News
Agency reported that Vietnamese ar
tillerymen destroyed pontoon
bridges the Chinese were using to
cross the Red and Nmthi rivers in the
northwest.
Final plans
The Bangkok sources, who asked
not to be identified, said they believe
China will withdraw most of its
troops from Vietnam within three or
four days after a final all-out assault.
They said many Chinese units have
been pulling out of the sparsely
populated, mountainous provinces
of Ha Tuyen and Cao Bang, leaving
behind smaller units to hold border
enclaves inside Vietnam, possibly as
bargaining chips after a cease-fire.
- Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — Tens of
thousands of Vietnamese and
Chinese troops backed by heavy ar
tillery were on the move yesterday
toward the Vietnamese town of Lang
Son and in what could be the show
down battle of the five-day-old bor
der war, intelligence sources in
Bangkok reported.
The sources said Chinese
strategists apparently intend to deal a
final bloody blow to the Vietnamese
military and then to withdraw most of
their forces from Vietnam within
three or four days.
Japan's Kyodo news service
quoted a government official in Pek
ing as saying China hopes to end the
conflict within,a few days, but the
unidentified orficial warned that it
might be prolonged if Vietnam
throws its regular army troops into
the fighting.
Vietnam moves regulars
That appeared to be just what
Hanoi was doing yesterday, as col
umns of regular army reinforce
ments were reported rolling north
toward Vietnamese-held Lang Son, a
strategically situated town that for
centuries has guarded the ap
proaches from China.
The troops apparently were reliev
ing battered militia units that bore
the defensive burden for the first
three days of fighting.
