"We know what is war. We suf
fered in the war. We want to build a
social system so not for a third time
can a world war be launched from
German soil," East German ambas
sador Horst Grunert told some sixty
students and faculty in the Meyer
Forum room yesterday.
Grunert, who became the German
Democratic Republic's ambassador
to this country in October, is in the
Bay Area for the opening of an exhib
ition of art from the royal collections
in Dresden Friday in San Francisco.
After saying that the exhibit and
other cultural exchanges can help
"narrow the gap of ignorance and
spread truth about our countries,"
Grunert was pressed by questioners
to clarify how much liberty East Ger
mans have to read Western books
and newspapers and travel to the
West.
"No American writer of any impor
tance is not translated in our coun
try," Grunert said. He added, how
ever, that difficulties in currency,
and for newspapers, language, effec
tively limit thecirculation of Western
literature and political writings.
"Our position is difficult. It is
necessary to recognize that. West
German publications, for example,
are not allowed distribution in our
country because they are so full of
hostility against us. We don't know
why we should distribute them."
Grunert said "nothing is being dic
tated by the Soviet Union," but that
decisions are arrived at "jointly." He
also said that the GDR has a "free
press" with but one limitation: "we
will not tolerate anti-revolutionary

viewpoints. Nobody in our country
has the right to endanger the socialist
revolution."
Claiming that more than three mill
ion of East Germany's 17 million citi
zens travel to the West each year,
Grunert nonetheless admitted that
his government has promulgated re
strictions on who may leave the
country. "Restrictions are bound to
| age and profession," he explained,
, "because we are in a very special re
, volutionary position. To establish a
new social system under our condi
tions is a very difficult task."
East Germany, Grunert pointed
I out, is politically and physically ba
lanced between the NATO countries
' and the Soviet Union. Thus, "I think
it is important for the U.S. govern
ment to have close contacts to our
situation; all of our problems are
immediately touching world prob
lems and policy." Since the United
States recognized East Germany in
1974, he said, both nations have be
nefited.
But, he said, internal political
policies should not be a factor in
East-West economic cooperation.
He said the lack of most favored na
tion status limits the GDR's ability to
export to the United States.
"We can survive only when we
cooperate together. We have only
one goal in foreign policy â€” to estab
lish conditions such that a new war
will be impossible. Instead of
blackmail, detente. Instead of milit
ary threat, disarmament. We try to
support the policy that the arms race
be brought to stop."
Grunert conceded that his gov
ernment teaches Wehrkunde, or de
fense strategy courses to students,
but defended the policy by saying,
"to support a peaceful policy in our
time means to keep the present
military balance, and we will do ev
erything so the military balance will
not be changed."
Denying that East Germany en
couraged the invasion of Zaire last
year, Grunert stressed that decisions
in the Republic are made "in com
mon not only with the Soviet Union
but within the Warsaw Pact Treaty"
allied nations.
Questioned about his nation's pol
icy towards Jews, said "to liquidate
all traces of racism in our nation has
been very, very important."
At the same time, he said, "While
we recognize the right of Israel to
exist we do not agree with Israeli pol
icy in the Mideast. We are in full ag
reement with the U.N. resolution
condemning Israeli policy."
Acknowledging that his own polit
ical point of view "differs in a high
degree" from that of most Ameri
cans, Grunert characterized himself
as "charged to explain our policy
goals to Americans.
"In many countries you can find
more luxury, and more glamour
(than in East Germany). But you will
not find in our country any traces of
misery. This was our goal. Our young
people know such things as inflation,
unemployment, and economic crisis
only from reports from other coun
tries or history books."
