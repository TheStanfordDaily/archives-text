# Spiderman, hobbits visit San Jose
## 
### Matthew Kreps 
A horde of fighter pilots from
Battlestar Galactica abandoned
their Colonial Vipers at Moffett
Field and descended with guns
"flashing" on San Jose's Con
vention Center this weekend.
There they met Darth Vader,
Spiderman, sword-wielding
hobbits and princesses and
even a few song-and-dance
men in tuxedoes.

"Comics are no longer a nickel-and-dime business.
The first issue of Spiderman, which sold for 10 cents
in 1962, now sells for $400."

They came to San Jose, not to
spill Earthling blood, but to at
tend the first annual Fantasy
Symposium, which ran Thurs
day through Sunday and fea
tured comics, science fiction,
> monsters—in print and on film.
More than 30 writers, actors
and artists attended the sym
posium, including Kirk Alyn,
the original film Superman;
comics writer Steve Englehart
of Marvel; artist Frank Brun
|ner, also of Marvel; Burne
Hogarth of Tar/an fame and
Mad s Sergio Aragones. They
and others came to talk to fans,
hold panel discussions on
aesthetics and peddle some of
their artwork.
Movies ran non-stop before
'packed audiences: Fantastic
Voyage, the original King Kong
and Dr. lekyll and Mr. Hyde, It!
The Terror from Outer Space,

even the Three Stooges and
Abbott and Costello.
People lined up to see the
Gallery of the Fantastic, a
bizarre museum of movie
props, models of R2-D2 and
galactic cruisers, "skulls" of
alien creatures and costumes
of famous movie monsters and
robots. Also on display were
comic artworks in oils, acrylics
and magic markers, drawn by

famous professionals and local
talent looking for a big break.
The gallery centerpiece, "The
Quest of the Ninth Power,"
was a large creche filled with
foot-high sculptures of trolls
and wizards. Fantastic, indeed.
Darth in front row
Seminars from 9 a.m. to 10
p.m. dealt with the aesthetics
of comic strips, or multi-media
writing. Darth Vader and a Star
Wars jawa sat in the front row
to hear a lecture on visual ef
fects.
In the dealers' room, movie
posters and comics from the
1940's Golden Age, hand
painted buttons, metal
sculptures of dragons and
monsters and other
memorabilia were strewn over
tables and walls.
Comics are no longer a

nickel-and-dime business. The
first issue of Spiderman,
which sold for 10 cents in 1962,
now sells for $400. More and
more comics are bound in hard
covers and sold for at least $10,
while artists' portfolios start at
$30. Fans don't just buy a
poster — they buy it framed,
numbered and signed by the
artist himself.
Haggling
Yet for those with pocket
money instead of checkbooks,
dealers were always willing to
haggle — accounting for the
symposium's bazaar-like at
mosphere.
Ironically, amid ai! this new
interest, "comics are dying,"
according to ex-comic writer
Steve Englehart, who was con
sidered to be one of the best
comic writers in the 19705. He
said he was attending the sym
posium to sell his collection
— he's getting out for good
and going into mainstream
writing.
Englehart blamed the comics
corporations for stifling
creativity, thus forcing out ta
lents like Frank Brunner, who
now works for more money on
his own projects.
Frodo the Hobbit
But such worries are not for
the children dressed as Frodo
the Hobbit or Luke Skywalker,
who walked away with arms
laden with old comics, or older
fans with theiroil paintingsand
hand-painted T-shirts.
For Bryan Barrett, head of
the International Media of the

of the Fantastic Society which
organized the symposium, it
was 18 months of planning
which paid off: th show sold
out Saturday and Sunday.
More than 1700 persons at
tended over the four days.
"Conventions are great —
people put a lot of love into
them," said Barrett, a student
at California State University-
Hay ward.
Although San )ose's sym
posium didn't rank with the
long-running giant conven
tions in San Diego or New York
for sheer size or.craziness,
there were enough costumes,
comics and camaraderie to
please even the most jaded
fan.
And for the young fans who
satisfied their cravings for a
Star Wars jawa or Superman, it
was a retro-rocket blast.


Comic collections like the one pictured above were sprawled over tables last weekend as San lose hosted
its first annual Fantasy Symposium in the Convention Center. More than 1700 comic book and science
fiction lovers attended the four-dav event.

and wizards. Fantastic, indeed.
Darth in front row
Seminars from 9 a.m. to 10
p.m. dealt with the aesthetics
of comic strips, or multi-media
writing. Darth Vader and a Star
Wars jawa sat in the front row
to hear a lecture on visual ef
fects.
In the dealers' room, movie
posters and comics from the
1940's Golden Age, hand
painted buttons, metal
sculptures of dragons and
monsters and other
memorabilia were strewn over
tables and walls.
Comics are no longer a

nickel-and-dime business. The
first issue of Spiderman,
which sold for 10 cents in 1962,
now sells for $400. More and
more comics are bound in hard
covers and sold for at least $10,
while artists' portfolios start at
$30. Fans don't just buy a
poster — they buy it framed,
numbered and signed by the
artist himself.
Haggling
Yet for those with pocket
money instead of checkbooks,
dealers were always willing to
haggle — accounting for the
symposium's bazaar-like at
mosphere.
Ironically, amid ai! this new
interest, "comics are dying,"
according to ex-comic writer
Steve Englehart, who was con
sidered to be one of the best
comic writers in the 19705. He
said he was attending the sym
posium to sell his collection
— he's getting out for good
and going into mainstream
writing.
Englehart blamed the comics
corporations for stifling
creativity, thus forcing out ta
lents like Frank Brunner, who
now works for more money on
his own projects.
Frodo the Hobbit
But such worries are not for
the children dressed as Frodo
the Hobbit or Luke Skywalker,
who walked away with arms
laden with old comics, or older
fans with theiroil paintingsand
hand-painted T-shirts.
For Bryan Barrett, head of
the International Media of the

of the Fantastic Society which
organized the symposium, it
was 18 months of planning
which paid off: th show sold
out Saturday and Sunday.
More than 1700 persons at
tended over the four days.
"Conventions are great —
people put a lot of love into
them," said Barrett, a student
at California State University-
Hay ward.
Although San )ose's sym
posium didn't rank with the
long-running giant conven
tions in San Diego or New York
for sheer size or.craziness,
there were enough costumes,
comics and camaraderie to
please even the most jaded
fan.
And for the young fans who
satisfied their cravings for a
Star Wars jawa or Superman, it
was a retro-rocket blast.


Comic collections like the one pictured above were sprawled over tables last weekend as San lose hosted
its first annual Fantasy Symposium in the Convention Center. More than 1700 comic book and science
fiction lovers attended the four-dav event.
A horde of fighter pilots from
Battlestar Galactica abandoned
their Colonial Vipers at Moffett
Field and descended with guns
"flashing" on San Jose's Con
vention Center this weekend.
There they met Darth Vader,
Spiderman, sword-wielding
hobbits and princesses and
even a few song-and-dance
men in tuxedoes.

"Comics are no longer a nickel-and-dime business.
The first issue of Spiderman, which sold for 10 cents

They came to San Jose, not to
spill Earthling blood, but to at
tend the first annual Fantasy
Symposium, which ran Thurs
day through Sunday and fea
tured comics, science fiction,
> monsters—in print and on film.
More than 30 writers, actors
and artists attended the sym
posium, including Kirk Alyn,
the original film Superman;
comics writer Steve Englehart
of Marvel; artist Frank Brun
|ner, also of Marvel; Burne
Hogarth of Tar/an fame and
Mad s Sergio Aragones. They
and others came to talk to fans,
hold panel discussions on
aesthetics and peddle some of
their artwork.
Movies ran non-stop before
'packed audiences: Fantastic
Voyage, the original King Kong
and Dr. lekyll and Mr. Hyde, It!
The Terror from Outer Space,

even the Three Stooges and
Abbott and Costello.
People lined up to see the
Gallery of the Fantastic, a
bizarre museum of movie
props, models of R2-D2 and
galactic cruisers, "skulls" of
alien creatures and costumes
of famous movie monsters and
robots. Also on display were
comic artworks in oils, acrylics
and magic markers, drawn by

famous professionals and local
talent looking for a big break.
The gallery centerpiece, "The
Quest of the Ninth Power,"
was a large creche filled with
foot-high sculptures of trolls
and wizards. Fantastic, indeed.
