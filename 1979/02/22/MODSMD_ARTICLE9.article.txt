# The
						Stanford daily OPINIONS
## Eastham, et al. More task forces needed 
### 
It has come to our attention
that the ASSU Senate is not
sending out nearly enough
task forces. We have been neg
lecting innumerable oppor
tunities to fight for truth, jus
tice and the Stanford Way ac
ross the world.
Certainly many of these op
portunities bear the same di
rect importance to student af
fairs here as does the Coors
controversy, and are well
within the purview of the ASSU
Senate. These crises across the
globe cry for the attention of
well-informed, influential fi
gures such as ASSU senators,
Daily reporters and other
members of task forces drawn
from the student community.
Even if the task forces fail to
accomplish any significant
changes (which hardly seems
possible considering their
powerand the respect they will
command) at least the consci
ence of the student body will
be assuaged, and the diligent
task force members will be
able to embellish their
graduate school applications.
One situation which clearly
calls for the intervention of the
ASSU Senate is the situation in
Iran, which should obviously
be a University concern due to
the large number of Iranian
students here.
Upon their arrival in Tehran
the task force would consult
with Ayatollah Khomeini to in

sure that he is administering
his new regime in a manner
consistent with standards set
by the ASSU Senate. Mean
while in Souihern California,
another task force of conscien
tious senators should meet
with Cesar Chavez to deter
mine whether lettuce used by
the University Food Service is
the product of unfair labor
practices.
Naturally we shall spare no
expense for our crusading task
forces. For example, to expe
dite their missions we should
consider purchasing a small
fleet of private jets. We should
also hire a number of inter
preters which will be neces
sary, for instance, when ASSU
senators travel !o Geneva to
review the draft version of the
proposed SALT II treaty.
Each member of the task
force should be issued an
American Express card to facili
tate direct billing of the ASSU;
after all, we wouldn't want
them to leave home without it.
While these task forces are
busy solving world problems,
other teams could be dealing
with situations closer to home.
Considering the winter sea
son, it is our belief that a team
should be dispatched as soon
as possible to thoroughly in
vestigate and report back on
snow conditions in the Lake
Tahoe area.
To prove our support of the

precedent-setting decision by
the ASSU Senate to send a
team to Coors, we would like
to volunteer our services for
the Tahoe Task Force.
In closing, we would like to
express our appreciation to
Coors for their part in opening
up a new range of possibilities
for student government. No
longer will student senates
have to restrict their activities
to matters which directly con
cern their constituency.

Fylstra are juniors majoring in
