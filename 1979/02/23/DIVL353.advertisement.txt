Smoking can be
hazardous to your health.
And wealth.
You know that a polluting car is dangerous to
ecology. But do you know it's also dangerous
to your repair bill? Once a car starts smoking it's
usually a sign that'one day soon it may not start
at all. Which is going to cost you money.
That's why it's smart to change your oil and oil
filter regularly. And the filter to change to is
NAPA. NAPA oil filters are designed to exceed
original equipment performance specifications.
To get the most harmful pollutants out of your
oil and the most mileage out of your car, ask
for an NAPA oil filter the next time you change
your oil. Or. if you're a do-it-yourselfer, get one
at your NAPA Jobber's store. We'll all breathe
easier for it.
