Fresno (AP) â€” A jury yester
day found 18-year-old Peter Ng
guilty of five counts of murder
and 11 counts of assault with a
deadly weapon in the San
Francisco Chinatown restaur
ant massacre.
The six men and six women
deliberated just over four
hours before convicting Ng,
who authorities said was one of
three men who sprayed the
Golden Dragon restaurant with
bullets Sept. 4, 1977.
The panel received the case
yesterday morning after hear
ing tive weeks of testimony.
Five diners were killed and
11 wounded in gunfire police
said resulted from an attempt
by the )oe Boys Chinese youth
gang to kill leaders of the rival
Wah Ohing gang. The )oe Boys
sought retaliation for the ear
lier shooting of one of their
members, police said.
Members of the Wah Ohing
at the restaurant ducked under
a table when a lookout hol
lered in Chinese "man with
gun." Consequently, all 16 of
the people killed or wounded
were innocent bystanders.
