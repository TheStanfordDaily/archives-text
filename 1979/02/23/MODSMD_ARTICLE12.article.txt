### 
Sacramento (APj — Lotdl schools would get
Si.6 billion in property tax revenues now
spent by counties under Gov. jerry Brown's
newest proposal to restructure local gov
ernment finances in the wake of Proposition
13.
Under the Brown proposal — which
touches every unit of local government —
counties would no longer receive any prop
erty tax revenues after june 10, 1980.
Ihe lost property tax revenues would be
covered by giving counties a bigger share of
the sales tax and by permanent state takeover
of most welfare and health costs.
But counties would not be compelled to
impose all of the sales taxes cut by local gov
ernments, and the plan might result in a tax
cut in some communities, Finance Director
Ric hard Silberman said yesterday.
The proposal doesn't give schools, c ities or
counties any significant extra money, but it
designates permanent sources of funds in
order to reduce the uncertainty that has
plagued local government since enactment
of Proposition 1 is property tax cuts
Total annual state aid would be S-4.5 billion,
compared with St.2 billion in tFie current
"bail-out" bill. The proposal would continue
the bailout formula one more year and im
pose most nanges in 1980.
The plan proposes no increase in taxes,
either at the state or local level. But it
suggests community colleges, which now
provide free classes, counseling and other
services, consider establishing some tees.
!t also would require countywide equaliza
tion of school funds, which represents a

middle ground between statewide equaliza
tion proposals and continuation of the cur
rent system of 1047 local districts, each with a
different amount of money per pupil.
Statewide equalization has been criticized
as unnecessarily destructive of some local
programs, while the current school finance
system has been ruled unconstitutional by
the California Supreme Court because it fa
vorecJ children from rich districts over poor
districts.
Both legislators and local government offi
cials had cautious reactions
A spokesman for state schools chief Wilson
Riles said Riles had not been consulted either
but that he would "look at it with an open
mind."
The Democratic leader of the Assembly,
Speaker Leo McCarthy of San Francisco, re
fused comment. But Republican floor leader
Paul Priolo of Malibu called it "a step in the
right direction. I commend the governor for
coming torth with something. It shows some
leadership."
The Democratic governor said he wanted
to hear legislative reaction to the plan betore
commenting publicly.
"I'm not prepared to elaborate until the
legislative staffs have had an opportunity .
to go over it carefully. If they have some bet
ter ways, I want to listen,' Brown said.
A major feature of the plan would shin two
cents per dollar of the sales tax to local gov
ernments, which already receive I'/» cents of
the six-cent tax. That is a $5 billion revenue
shilt, of which $2.ft billion would go to coun
ties and $375 million to cities.
