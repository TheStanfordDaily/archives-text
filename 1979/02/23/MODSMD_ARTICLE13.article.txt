### Robert Reed 
The Stanford YWCA has
been active recently in an at
tempt to draw together the var
ious women s organizations on
campus to pursue common
goals, according to Patsy Phil
lips, executive director of the
'V.'
According to Phillips, the
YWCA is an autonomous
women's movement" that has
been working to bring to
gether campus women's or
ganizations to increase their ef
fectiveness through inter
group communication and
support.
In November the Y' held a
women's coalition workshop
which discussed the problems
of women's groups on campus
and made plans for pulling
women together. Among the
ideas discussed by the wo
men's groups was a directory
ot women s services, which
several women's groups are
< urrently working on.
Because of a need tor inter
group communication per
ceived at the conference, Phil
lips said, a bi-weekly newslet
ter called "The Network'' is
now being put out coopera
tively to discuss what the indi
vidual groups are doing and
what their various concerns
are.
"Hy establishing channels ot
communication, we can find
out what cither groups are
doing and support what they

are doing," said Phillips, exp
laining that women's groups
must find out about and sup
port what other women's
groups are doing it any are to
be effective.
According to Phillips, there
are a number of women's
groups on campus that aren't
even recognized as organiza
tions, suggesting that there are
probably about 25 women's
groups on campus.
Working in conjunction with
tlx'se groups, the YWCA has
offered and is offering prog
rams aimed at meeting the
YWCA's one imperative
adopted by the group's annual
national convention in 1970 —
To eliminate racism wherever
it exists and by any means
necessary,' said Phillips. This
is a goal that aids not only
minority women, but all wo
men, she said.
The YWCA's most recent
effort in this direction
was Monday's workshop on
feminism and racism, which
was meant toshoyv that the bat
tles ot minorities and women
are one and the same, said Phil
lips.
Speaking at the workshop
was noted women's and civil
rights leader, Angela Davis.
Davis stressed the need for all
women to work together, be
( ause, she said, "wherever and
whenever racism becomes
more intensified, sexism fol
lows on its heels."

When Davis was on trial in
1972 facing charges of murder,
kidnapping and conspiracy
arising from the Aug. 7, 1970
Marin County Courthouse
shootout in which four people
were killed, the national YWCA
took its first political stance
and expressed the concern
that she receive a fair and just
trial.
Speaking before the Stan
ford 'Y' was her "first chance to
say thank you' to the YWCA,"
she said.
"The YWCA is the one place

where pluralism can exist,''
said Phillips, explaining the
women s coalition being
formed by the Y' only brings
the ideas and views ot the vari
ous women's groups together
— and does not mix them to
gether.
Phillips explained the
pluralism concept involved
means a "salad bowl" coali
tion, rather than a "melting
pot" type ot blending together
ot the many different ideas and
concerns ot the various wo
men s groups
