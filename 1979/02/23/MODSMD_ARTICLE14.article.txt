## Infant formulas killing more than curing

'Can a product which re

and a literate parent to follow

where water is contaminated,
sewage runs in the streets,
poverty is severe and illiteracy
is high? . . . When economic
incentives are in conflict with
public health requirements
how shall that conflict be resol

code for product use and dis
own or turn away from the
realities of product use?"
- Senator Edward Kennedy
Chairperson, U.S. Senate
Hearings, May 1978
Concerned citizens and
groups have banded together
to launch the largest non
union boycott in U.S. history to
answer Kennedy's questions
about infant formula milk
promotion in developing
countries.
Dr. Derrick lelliffe, UCLA
nutritionist, estimates that
over 10 million infants annually
suffer from malnutrition, dis
ease or death because they are
bottle-fed instead of breast
fed. Multinational corpora

tions such as Nestle, Abbott/
Ross Labs, American Home
Products and Bristol-Myers
contribute significantly to that
problem by indiscriminately
promoting the use of milk for
mula to mothers who could
breastfeed their children.
In Singapore, where corpo
rate promotion is intense,
breastfeeding rates among
poor families have dropped
from 71 percent in 1951 to 5
percent in 1971. Studies in
Chile show death rates two to
three times higher for bottle
fed babies than for those fed
on mother's milk. And as for
mula feeding rates rise, the av
erage age for onset of infant
malnutrition has dropped from
eighteen months to eight.
As explained in a 1978 report
from the World Health Organi
zation, mothers in poor de
veloping countries have li
mited access to uncontami
nated water, so the prepara
tion of the formula "almost in
evitably lends itself to con
tamination."
Mothers often cannot afford
to purchase the necessary
amounts of formula needed for
adequate nutrition, and so

they over-dilute the product in
an attempt to economize, with
disastrous effects on the health
of their children. Similarly,
mothers in countries where il
literacy is widespread cannot
follow the can's directions.
Medical authorities agree
that especially in Third World
countries, the best food a
mother can provide comes
from her own breast. Vet
skyrocketing birthrates and
expanding profit margins have
encouraged multinationals such
as Nestle to step up promo
tion. Newspapers, radio and
billboards all send loud, mis
leading messages encouraging
mothers to turn from
breastfeeding to bottlefeed
ing.
An especially effective and
self-perpetuating method of
promotion is the supply of free
samples of fprmula to health
officials and organizations in
developing countries. In addi
tion, Nestle and other formula
companies donate medical
equipment, funds for confer
ences, and allegedly give
kickbacks to doctors for prom
otion of their product, accord
ing to the Infant Formula Ac

tion Coalition (INFACT).
Indeed, the profit margins
are substantial. Professor
James Post of Boston Univer
sity estimates that by 1980 the
developing world will be
spending more than $1 billion
annually for infant formula.
Nestle is the focus of the
nation-wide boycott primarily
because it is Swiss-based with
no stock sales in the United
States, and thus is immune to
shareholder resolutions, law
suits and federal regulation.
As criticism of promotion
has grown, however, the for
mula industry has responded
only with "self-regulation" and
marketing "codes of ethics"
which are not adhered to and
which, more importantly, do
not get at the root of the prob
lem.
The problem is that, under
the guise of benevolent con
cern, multinationals such as
Nestle rake in millions of dol
lars and pretend not to know
that they leave death and dis
ease in their wake.
Ihe Nestle boycott is de
signed to force these exploitive
formula companies to recog
nize and take responsibility for
the destruction they play a lead
role in creating. At present,
Nestle has skillfully refused to
do so, as illustrated in the fol
lowing excerpt from the May
1978 hearings:
Kennedy: "And my final

question is . . . what do you
feel is your corporate respon
sibility to find out the extent of
the use of your product in
those circumstances in the de
veloping part of the world? Do
you feel you have that respon
sibility?"
Ballarin (of Nestle-Brazil):
"We cannot have that respon
sibility, sir . .
Exploitative formula promo
tion, however, is not restricted
to Third World countries. A
study currently underway al
ready clearly indicates that
formula feeding in poor urban
and rural areas of the United
States has resulted in high in
fant mortality.
This correlation of high for
mula feeding rates, low in
come and high infant mortality
is brought home by the fact
that the infant mortality rate
in wealthy suburban Piedmont
is three per thousand, com
pared with 26 per thousand in
nearby East Oakland.
As people with moral con
sciences, we have a responsi
bility to curb practices of cor
porations which undermine
not only the health of Third
World nations but the lives of
their own consumers. The Nes
tle boycott is an effective
channel for our anger.

- Senator Edward Kennedy
Chairperson, U.S. Senate
Hearings, May 1978
Concerned citizens and
groups have banded together
to launch the largest non
union boycott in U.S. history to
answer Kennedy's questions
about infant formula milk
promotion in developing
countries.
Dr. Derrick lelliffe, UCLA
nutritionist, estimates that
over 10 million infants annually
suffer from malnutrition, dis
ease or death because they are
bottle-fed instead of breast
fed. Multinational corpora

tions such as Nestle, Abbott/
Ross Labs, American Home
Products and Bristol-Myers
contribute significantly to that
problem by indiscriminately
promoting the use of milk for
mula to mothers who could
breastfeed their children.
In Singapore, where corpo
rate promotion is intense,
breastfeeding rates among
poor families have dropped
from 71 percent in 1951 to 5
percent in 1971. Studies in
Chile show death rates two to
three times higher for bottle
fed babies than for those fed
on mother's milk. And as for
mula feeding rates rise, the av
erage age for onset of infant
malnutrition has dropped from
eighteen months to eight.
As explained in a 1978 report
from the World Health Organi
zation, mothers in poor de
veloping countries have li
mited access to uncontami
nated water, so the prepara
tion of the formula "almost in
evitably lends itself to con
tamination."
Mothers often cannot afford
to purchase the necessary
amounts of formula needed for
adequate nutrition, and so

they over-dilute the product in
an attempt to economize, with
disastrous effects on the health
of their children. Similarly,
mothers in countries where il
literacy is widespread cannot
follow the can's directions.
Medical authorities agree
that especially in Third World
countries, the best food a
mother can provide comes
from her own breast. Vet
skyrocketing birthrates and
expanding profit margins have
encouraged multinationals such
as Nestle to step up promo
tion. Newspapers, radio and
billboards all send loud, mis
leading messages encouraging
mothers to turn from
breastfeeding to bottlefeed
ing.
An especially effective and
self-perpetuating method of
promotion is the supply of free
samples of fprmula to health
officials and organizations in
developing countries. In addi
tion, Nestle and other formula
companies donate medical
equipment, funds for confer
ences, and allegedly give
kickbacks to doctors for prom
otion of their product, accord
ing to the Infant Formula Ac

tion Coalition (INFACT).
Indeed, the profit margins
are substantial. Professor
James Post of Boston Univer
sity estimates that by 1980 the
developing world will be
spending more than $1 billion
annually for infant formula.
Nestle is the focus of the
nation-wide boycott primarily
because it is Swiss-based with
no stock sales in the United
States, and thus is immune to
shareholder resolutions, law
suits and federal regulation.
As criticism of promotion
has grown, however, the for
mula industry has responded
only with "self-regulation" and
marketing "codes of ethics"
which are not adhered to and
which, more importantly, do
not get at the root of the prob
lem.
