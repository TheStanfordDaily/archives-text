# Daily financial statement
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily would like to inform the
community it serves of its present financial
position. As the figures presented below in
dicate, we suffered a large operating loss of
$41,000 in 1974-1975; through tough cost con
trol measures and subscription fee payments
made by the student body and the University,
we experienced a gain of nearly $40,000 in
1977-1978.
The question now arises â€” what are we
doing with the gains realized? It is necessary
to understand the Daily organizational struc
ture. The Daily is a non-profit corporation
separate from the University and governed
independently by a nine-person Board of Di
rectors. The directors include four student
staff representatives and five non-staff rep
resentatives. The five people from outside
the staff include a lawyer, an advertising
executive, a journalist, a professor hereand a
student unaffiliated with the direct operation
of the newspaper. These nine people set the
financial policies of the Daily's operation.
Returning to the initial question of what we
are doing with the money, the answer is that
the money is needed for two purposes. First,
a one-third-of-annual-operating-expense
reserve fund must be set aside as a cushion
for bad years. We very recently have
achieved the reserve goal. A large reserve is
needed because the possible economic
downturn that was partially responsible for
the catastrophic results in fiscal '75 might re
cur, and the Daily Board of Directors believes
we need that much money in reserve to
weather a storm if it comes. (This reserve
policy is endorsed by the University ad
ministration.)
Our second need for continuing revenue
gains is to make this newspaper a better pro
duct. One way of bettering our product is to
spend more for color, graphics or more news
stories and more investigative reporting. Last
year we sent reporters to Rhode Island to

cover water polo championships and to
Washington to cover The Stanford Daily law
suit which was before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
The second category of expenses includes
those that indirectly add to the quality of the
newspaper and improve the Daily as an edu
cational laboratory for aspiring journalists.
For example, we are presently investigating
the possibility of acquiring computerized
equipment to bring our newsroom into the
20th century and expose our reporters and
editors to equipment they will have to use in
the "real world." The cost of this equipment
is substantial, likely totaling more than
$100,000.
Another anticipated expenditure is im
provement in compensation tor reporters
and editors. Despite this year's iO percent
increase in budgeted salaries for the editorial
staff, many editors continue to work 50-hour
weeks throughout the school year and get
paid the equivalent of $1 per hour or less.
Perhaps if staffers were paid more we could
attract people to work here who now must
take better-paying jobs elsewhere on cam
pus.
We want you to be familiar with the Daily
because even though we are an independent
corporation, we are an integral part of the
community. Fee assessments amount to only
10 percent of our annual revenues, but in
most years the assessment monies spell the
difference between gain and loss. Most im
portantly, however, the Daily wants to serve
Stanford better. We hope you will come here
with your talents, suggestions, questions and
hard work to make this a better newspaper.
Now is the time to do it.

Fiscal year change in fiscal 77 creates overstatement of 77 income by approximately $ 10.000 which is exactly offset by understatement of profits in
fiscal 76 This is because in summer of 76 we had operating loss of approximately $10,000
