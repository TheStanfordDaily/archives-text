# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Harvey Rose Energy Act falls short 
### 
(second of two parts)
We have a history of incon
sistent, conflicting and coun
terproductive energy
strategies in this country. The
National Energy Act (NEA),
passed by Congress Jast year, is
the first coordinated effort to
address in an integrated, rather
than a piecemeal fashion, our
energy problems.
In just 2Vi months, President
]immy Carter, James
Schlesinger and a few top ad
visers assembled the plan,
which took Vh years to pass
through Congress. The plan
was constructed without help

from the general public or
leading energy analysts and
experts, and lacks the balance
and foresight necessary to
make significant contributions
in achieving our true energy
self-sufficiency.
The plan sets a ridiculously
low .4 percent contribution
from solar energy in 1985. The
goals for solarizing homes are
equally disappointing, at 1.3
million solar homes or only 1.8
percent of the national total.
Experts in the solar energy
industries claim that by 1985,11
million homes could be sol
arized and 20 percent of all na
tional energy needs could be
met by solar methods. The
federal building programs
should not be merely a de
monstration program, forsolar
heating, hot water and passive
solar design techniques are
proven technologies, ready to
be put to practical use.
The plan relegates all but a
few solar energy applications
to "beyond 1985" or in "the
next century." The Congress
and president mention in the
plan tnat at least one-third of
our entire energy demand can
be met by low-grade heat.
These temperatures below a
few hundred degrees are ide
ally suited forsolar sources, yet
the plan fails to make the criti
cal connection and allocate
money forsolar industrial heat
ing.
Small scale applications of
solar power are largely ignored
in favor of undesirable and un
reliable large oil and nuclear
power stations. These cen
tralized generating stations can
increase the threat of nuclear
proliferation by producing fis
sionable fuels, and are unlikely
to ease our dependence on
foreign fuels.
Certain sections of the NEA
deserve to be applauded. To
encourage the development of
small hydroelectric power sta
tions, loans for existing dams
which are not being used to
generate electricity are eligible
to receive up to 75 percent of
the cost of the project from the
government.
Cogeneration, or the recov
ering and using of industrial
waste heat energy, is a good
potential source of valuable
fuel-free energy. White House

energy planners predict
cogeneration will provide 9000
megawatts of power, or
enough energy to obviate the
need for building nine large
power stations. The govern
ment boosted its prospects by
demanding that utilities must
buy and sell power from qual
ified cogenerators at a just and
reasonable rate.
The new federal solar tax
credit allows taxpayers a credit
of 30 percent of the first $2000
invested and 20 percent of the
next $8000 spent, up to a
maximum of $2200. This will
help reduce the principal bar
rier to widespread solar de
velopment â€” that of high cost.
Solar systems have a high initial
cost, but because there are no
fuel costs they usually pay for
themselves in a period of three
to 20 years.
If we want to bring renewa
ble energy resources like wind,
solar and geothermal into the
national energy mix in appreci
able and significant quantities,
we must offer more attractive
tax credits and other incentives
and set a realistic, ambitious
timetable to introduce their
widespread use.
Current Energy Resource
and Development Agency
(ERDA) wind power funding of
$20 million will need to be in
creased to $500 million if it is to
make a difference in the near
future. The plan does not pro
vide crops for fuel. Biomass
energy from trees, kelp, trash,
gtass, food wastes and algae
may provide 10 to 15 percent of
California's energy needs in
the years ahead.
Time is our most precious
resource and must be used as
wisely as energy. How much
time this nation and this world
has before energy demand ex
ceeds supply is not as impor
tant as understanding the need
to take immediate action in
preparation for this time.
The NEA is a positive step in
the right direction, but far
more ambitious and properly
scaled conservation and re
newable energy resource
programs will be needed if we
are to meet the challenge of
providing enough energy for
future generations.
