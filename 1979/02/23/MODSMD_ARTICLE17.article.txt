Comments clarified
I would like to clarify some
comments and opinions attri
buted to me in the article enti
tled "Chicanos Want Cultural
Center" (Daily, )an. 25).
I specifically take issue with
one aspect of the article. One
of the quotes attributed to me
is incorrect, incomplete and
taken out of context. I do not
harbor "fears . . . that the
Asian-American students and
the )ewish students and the
Iranian students will all start
making incredible demands."
I categorically reject the
philosophy that would pit
minority and other underre
presented groups against each
other. I do not believe that
gains for Chicanos here will or
must come at the expense or
detriment of other groups.
On the contrary, I have al
ways believed that minority
and other underrepresented
groups will achieve the
greatest progress by working
together and that this solidarity
will benefit them and the entire
Stanford community. In fact,
the article does go on to cor
rectly quote me as saying, . .
there is a great solidarity
among students here and
Chicanos can provide an
example or leadership or assis
tance to any students who have
the same kinds of needs."

Assistant to the President
for Chicano Affairs
Editor's note: I believe more is
being read into the quote than
reasonably can be. The quote
reads: "There are tears . .
and it is attributed to Baeza.' I
feel this wording states only
that Baeza believes some
people may fear certain minor
ity groups will make "incredi
ble demands" based on the
experiences of the Chicano
community. It does not sfafe
that Baeza personally harbors
such fears.
Indeed, the very next parag
raph, which includes the sol
idarity quote (referred to in
Baeza's letter), makes her posi

tion on this issue quite clear -
namely that the Chicano com
munity situation can and
should act as a model for other
groups.
Our reporter said Baeza's use
of the specific groups named in
the quote was an explanatory
device. Readers should note
that any fears individuals may
harbor on this issue are neither
restricted to and nor necessar
ily include the groups listed in
the quote.
With this clarification, I stand
by the story as published.

Clerical unions
I have been a secretary at the
University for more than three
years, and during the last year,
I have begun to question why it
is that clerical personnel here
are not included in the union
which exists here.
Upon inquiry, I have learned
that they are not included in
the collective bargaining unit
but may join United Stanford
Employees (USE) as individuals
and reap some of the benefits
of union tnembership, such as
help with grievances. That
doesn't satisfy me, however. I
want more, the whole bag.
Clerical workers are or
ganized elsewhere. Why not
here? So I talked to a few
people and was told that it's
darn hard to find secretaries,
office assistants, clerks, etc.,
who are interested in organiz
ing. The clerical staff, I was
told, are "satisfied," or if not
so, still don't want anything to
do with unions.
Well, I don't believe that
they are satisfied. And I would
like to understand why — if it's
true — they are reluctant to or
ganize or are anti-union. Is it
fear of getting in trouble with
their "bosses"? Or do they see
unions as frightening or un
conventional?
Almost every group has un
ions these days: doctors, ac
tors, nurses, truckers, cafeteria
workers — why not us?!
A need for collective or

ganized effort exists: our
salaries remain near the bot
tom for nonexempt staff; and
I've heard enough instances by
now of abuse and injustice to
individual clerical workers to
shock me out of my former
complacency. In this era of
feminism, why has so little of
its philosophy and energy rub
bed off on the predominantly
female clerical staff here?
I'd like to hear from some of
my fellow workers out there.

Poor attendance
This past Saturday night (Jan.
27), the Leroy Jenkins trio
played at the Encina Station.
Jenkins is a true master of crea
tive music, or more specifi

cally, Great Black Music.
This performance quite ap
propriately happened in Black
Liberation Month which has
the apparent twofold purpose
of, first, allowing blacks to re
flect upon their history and cul
ture and second, exposing this
history and culture to the
broader community.
However, this concert was
poorly attended despite its ex
cellent quality. There was, un
fortunately, a definite lack of
interest shown by the black
community here. Apparently,
the black community has no in
terest in this aspect of their cul
ture. They must not be in
terested in the true black
American musical continuum.

Editor's note: I believe more is
being read into the quote than
reasonably can be. The quote
reads: "There are tears . .
and it is attributed to Baeza.' I
feel this wording states only
that Baeza believes some
people may fear certain minor
ity groups will make "incredi
ble demands" based on the
experiences of the Chicano
community. It does not sfafe
that Baeza personally harbors
such fears.
Indeed, the very next parag
raph, which includes the sol
idarity quote (referred to in
Baeza's letter), makes her posi

tion on this issue quite clear -
namely that the Chicano com
munity situation can and
should act as a model for other
groups.
Our reporter said Baeza's use
of the specific groups named in
the quote was an explanatory
device. Readers should note
that any fears individuals may
harbor on this issue are neither
restricted to and nor necessar
ily include the groups listed in
the quote.
With this clarification, I stand
by the story as published.

Clerical unions
I have been a secretary at the
University for more than three
years, and during the last year,
I have begun to question why it
is that clerical personnel here
are not included in the union
which exists here.
Upon inquiry, I have learned
that they are not included in
the collective bargaining unit
but may join United Stanford
Employees (USE) as individuals
and reap some of the benefits
of union tnembership, such as
help with grievances. That
doesn't satisfy me, however. I
want more, the whole bag.
Clerical workers are or
ganized elsewhere. Why not
here? So I talked to a few
people and was told that it's
darn hard to find secretaries,
office assistants, clerks, etc.,
who are interested in organiz
ing. The clerical staff, I was
told, are "satisfied," or if not
so, still don't want anything to
do with unions.
Well, I don't believe that
they are satisfied. And I would
like to understand why — if it's
true — they are reluctant to or
ganize or are anti-union. Is it
fear of getting in trouble with
their "bosses"? Or do they see
unions as frightening or un
conventional?
Almost every group has un
ions these days: doctors, ac
tors, nurses, truckers, cafeteria
workers — why not us?!
A need for collective or

ganized effort exists: our
salaries remain near the bot
tom for nonexempt staff; and
I've heard enough instances by
now of abuse and injustice to
individual clerical workers to
shock me out of my former
complacency. In this era of
feminism, why has so little of
its philosophy and energy rub
bed off on the predominantly
female clerical staff here?
I'd like to hear from some of
my fellow workers out there.

Poor attendance
This past Saturday night (Jan.
27), the Leroy Jenkins trio
played at the Encina Station.
Jenkins is a true master of crea
tive music, or more specifi

cally, Great Black Music.
This performance quite ap
propriately happened in Black
Liberation Month which has
the apparent twofold purpose
of, first, allowing blacks to re
flect upon their history and cul
ture and second, exposing this
history and culture to the
broader community.
However, this concert was
poorly attended despite its ex
cellent quality. There was, un
fortunately, a definite lack of
interest shown by the black
community here. Apparently,
the black community has no in
terest in this aspect of their cul
ture. They must not be in
terested in the true black
American musical continuum.

Comments clarified
I would like to clarify some
comments and opinions attri
buted to me in the article enti
tled "Chicanos Want Cultural
Center" (Daily, )an. 25).
I specifically take issue with
one aspect of the article. One
of the quotes attributed to me
is incorrect, incomplete and
taken out of context. I do not
harbor "fears . . . that the
Asian-American students and
the )ewish students and the
Iranian students will all start
making incredible demands."
I categorically reject the
philosophy that would pit
minority and other underre
presented groups against each
other. I do not believe that
gains for Chicanos here will or
must come at the expense or
detriment of other groups.
On the contrary, I have al
ways believed that minority
and other underrepresented
groups will achieve the
greatest progress by working
together and that this solidarity
will benefit them and the entire
Stanford community. In fact,
the article does go on to cor
rectly quote me as saying, . .
there is a great solidarity
among students here and
Chicanos can provide an
example or leadership or assis
tance to any students who have
the same kinds of needs."
