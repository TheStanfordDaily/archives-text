# Is there a future after graduation?
## 
### Krisan Froelich 
Are you paranoid about what you are
going to do after you graduate? Is there
actually life for you after Stanford? The
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) can help you find out.
"Most people don't think of the
CPPC as a place to go," Yvonne Hiltz, a
peer counselor at the center, com
mented. But the earlier you start think
ing about a career, the better."
The CPPC is designed to provide
people with the "tools" needed to find
a job, said Rene Filice, director of lib
eral arts for the center. "There are more
tools than just interviews," she added.
Dr. Ralph Keller, director of the
center, describes CPPC as "a medium
which causes the students to think
about the future.' It is not designed to
cause a decision, but to get people to
think about their lives after graduation.
'We are not putting less emphasis on
placement," Keller said. "But the first
step is planning."
So what does the center have to of
fer?
One of its many services is the Career
Exploration Program, a series of semi
nars about job opportunities and plan
ning which are taped and available in
the CPPC library. Topics vary from
quarter to quarter and range from
'Summer Internship Experience" to
"Management Training Programs" to
"Careers in International Business."
One of the major functions of these
programs is to provide the student with
basic information, said Shelley Hor
witz, a peer counselor tor the center.
She cites lack of information as one of
the most common problems students

have while seeking jobs.
To combat this, the CPPC has its own
library carrying general information on
various fields. The center also offers
one-to-one counseling with either a
peer or a director. "For most problems,
a peer counselor can handle things just
as well as a director," Hiltz said.
"Some students are afraid to seek
help; going to a peer counselor can
lessen that fear," explained Horw't/.
Peer counselors have taken a course on
counseling and have been trained by
the CPPC.
This is fine for the person who knows
what he or she wants to have as a
career, but what about those who have
little or no idea? The CPPC is well
equipped to help with more than just
counseling.
First, the center provides a "self
assessment program." In one of these
many exercises, students are asked to
write their obituary to get them think
ing about what they want to ac
complish.
The center also offers a "guided fan
tasy'' workshop, where students are
asked to visualize themselves ten years
from now.
In addition, Vocational Inventory
Testing matches an individual's in
terests and values to find where they
coincide and how they relate to a
career.
"Many people come in here who
don'f know what they want," Horwitz
said. "We try to apply their interests
and leisure activities toa work setting."
"The value of on-the-job experience
is not measurable, it's essential. You

never know about a job until you do it,"
Horwitz explained. For this reason the
CPPC offers summer employment ser
vices and encourages people to exper
iment with their interests. "You can't
start planning your career the day you
get to Stanford," Filice said. "But the
things you do early can make your deci
sion easier."
Once students have decided what
type of job they want, the CPPC offers
many services to help them find it. in
addition to interview sessions and re
sume workshops, center personnel
supply contacts. "Part ot t le problem is
that students think if the CPPC doesn't
offer any interviews in one area, there
are no jobs in that area," Filice said. But
the CPPC can provide names and con
tacts of many firms that do not inter
view on campus.
It interviewing is seen as a frightening
threat to the job-seeker, the CPPC can
help with that, too. It offers interview
sessions that videotape simulated in
terviews. Students can watch them
selves and catch problems they may be
having with eye contact, speech and
voice tones or mannerisms. On the
other hand, it writing a resume seems
to be too much, the center offers re
sume writing workshops with coun
selors (ritiquing resumes and offering
suggestions.
"People don't come to Stanford with
the primary objective of preparing for a
career." Keller explained. "They come
here to get the kind (tf education a
place like this has to offer." The center
encourages students to think about
their educational program and to diver
sity that program to get the best educa
tion they can, he said.
