# U.S. urges United Nations to end Vietnam-China war

### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) —Chinese infantrymen and
tanks smashed into defense lines in Vietnam's northeast
corner in a two-pronged assault that could cut off
thousands of Hanoi's troops from reinforcements and
supplies, intelligence sources reported yesterday.
Meanwhile, the United States asked the United Na
tions Security Council to convene an urgent session to
discuss warfare in Southeast Asia.
A government official in Peking said China is not yet
satisfied it has achieved the objective of its six-day-old
invasion.
"The thing is that the Vietnamese must feel our
punishment," Japan's Kyodo news service quoted the
unidentified official as saying.
Radio Hanoi said 12,000 Chinese troops had been kil
led in the first five days of fighting.
Analysts here consider those claims inflated and say
the Vietnamese have suffered heavier casualties than
the Chinese. It has been difficult to verify casualty fi
gures independently.
Three Chinese infantry divisions led by heavy tanks
struck from behind the Chinese border and pushed 12
miles deep into Vietnam's Quang Ninh Province in the
face of tough resistance, the intelligence sources said.
The Chinese troops were 12 miles north of the east
west Highway 4, which links Lang Son with the South
China Sea coast.

This strike force, consisting of as many as 80,000 men,
was expected to seize Highway 4 and then possibly
swing inland and cut off Highway 1 south of Lang Son,
thereby isolating the Vietnamese forces between the
two Chinese armies.
Information provided by Bangkok sources and West
ern military sources in Peking, quoted by Kyodo, indi
cated that the new Chinese attacks in the northeast were
aimed at cutting off two highways linking the
Vietnamese-held, front-line town of Lang Son with
Hanoi and the seacoast.
William Maynes, an assistant secretary of state for
international relations, said the Carter administration
expected to be able to win the nine votes necessary to
convene a meeting of the 15-member Security Council.
Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke said
the American goal was to demonstrate an international
consensus that both China and Vietnam should with
draw their troops.
Maynes said that the United States has no draft resolu
tion to suggest to the council but simply wants to discuss
the situation. He was careful to say that the United States
wants the agenda to include the "situation in Southeast
Asia," and not solely the Chinese invasion of Vietnam.
American policy has been to deplore both the Chinese
invasion of Vietnam and Vietnam's invasion of Cam
bodia.
