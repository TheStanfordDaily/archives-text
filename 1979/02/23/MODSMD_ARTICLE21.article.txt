Les Provinces
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
165-5550
In the tace of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to he one of the finer
exceptions. Recently lauded by
both Gourmet magazine and
Finnegan's Guide, its clientele
now comes from all parts of the
United States and Canada.
While one would infer from
the name of the restaurant that
each of the provinces of France
would be well represented on
the menu, this in fact, is not the
case; the menu draws heavily
from the province of Bur
gundy. This is hardly surpris
ing: the owners tome from
Burgundy and the chef studied
at the Hotel Lameloise. Our
waiter, however, was not in
any way connected with Bur

gundy, let alone France — he
was an Iranian business stu
dent (who claimed to have had
us pegged as reviewers from
the moment we were seated,
"...because you spent half an
hour with the menu...") Al
though he was overloaded
with extra tables, his service
was attentive and efficient.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hoFS
d'oeuvres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham crepes
to $4 for smoked salmon and
Escargots De Bourgome. The
Terrine Maison a I'Armagnac
was an unflawed but unexcep
tional rendition of home-made
pate.
Among the four soups at Les
Provinces, Bisque d'Ecrevisses
de Homards ($5.25), cream of
fresh crayfish or of fresh Maine
lobster, was truly inspiring. Al
though the pastry topping was
slightly undercooked, this (and

the 20-minute wait) is a far from
adequate excuse tor not order
ing this glorious dish. Top re
commendation.
Salade de Champignons
(mushroom salad, $1) is a de
served favorite at Les Pro
vinces. The distinctive dressing
did not mask the flavor of the
fresh mushrooms. The one
serving was more than enough
for two. I had been looking
forward to trying this salad
again since my last visit to Les
Provinces two years ago. I was
not disappointed.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck
flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard
(stuffed breast of duck,
$10/50), a house specialty is
outstanding. Also recom

mended is Medallion de Veau
Forestiere, veal with mus
hroom and sherry sauce,
($11.25).
The Escalope de Saumon a
I'Oseille (salmon with sorrel,
$9) was marvelous, even for
two experienced and skeptical
salmon connoisseurs from the
Pacific Northwest. As with the
mushroom salad, the sorrel
sauce was a fine yet not over
powering complement to the
salmon. Furthermore, Les Pro
vinces is known tor its skillful
preparation of seafood.
The second dish we tasted
was two quail stuffed with veal
and liver (a special that even
ing, $13) nestled in a bed of
crunchy shoestring potatoes.
One could not help but admire
the artistry of their prepara
tion. However, the waiter
failed to warn us ot the exces
sive saltiness of the sauce. Fie
paid for his oversight by drag

ging to our table pitcher after
pitcher of water.
All entrees are served with
side dishes of fresh vegetables
and potatoes, which, for once,
were noticeably cooked to per
fection.
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux
Fraises (strawberry tart, $2.50);
Jartelette Chaude aux Pummes
(hot apple tart, $2); and, Snuf
fle Grand Marnier ($5.75). The
excellence of the coffee was a
rare treat.
Les Provinces is a dining ex
perience which can easily
compete with San Francisco's
best French cuisine. From the
stark but elegant decor, to the
service, to the freshness of the
ingredients, price indicates
quality. And unlike some
French restaurants, one was
treated with respect rather
than condescension. The wine
list had, to our mind, a poor
representation of California
wines but a strong representa
tion of wines of Burgundy that
reflect the owners' bias.
Les Provinces. Worth the
splurge. Top recommenda
tion.

eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux
Fraises (strawberry tart, $2.50);
Jartelette Chaude aux Pummes
(hot apple tart, $2); and, Snuf
fle Grand Marnier ($5.75). The
excellence of the coffee was a
rare treat.
Les Provinces is a dining ex
perience which can easily
compete with San Francisco's
best French cuisine. From the
stark but elegant decor, to the
service, to the freshness of the
ingredients, price indicates
quality. And unlike some
French restaurants, one was
treated with respect rather
than condescension. The wine
list had, to our mind, a poor
representation of California
wines but a strong representa
tion of wines of Burgundy that
reflect the owners' bias.
Les Provinces. Worth the
splurge. Top recommenda
tion.

Les Provinces
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
165-5550
In the tace of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to he one of the finer
exceptions. Recently lauded by
both Gourmet magazine and
Finnegan's Guide, its clientele
now comes from all parts of the
United States and Canada.
While one would infer from
the name of the restaurant that
each of the provinces of France
would be well represented on
the menu, this in fact, is not the
case; the menu draws heavily
from the province of Bur
gundy. This is hardly surpris
ing: the owners tome from
Burgundy and the chef studied
at the Hotel Lameloise. Our
waiter, however, was not in
any way connected with Bur

gundy, let alone France — he
was an Iranian business stu
dent (who claimed to have had
us pegged as reviewers from
the moment we were seated,
"...because you spent half an
hour with the menu...") Al
though he was overloaded
with extra tables, his service
was attentive and efficient.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hoFS
d'oeuvres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham crepes
to $4 for smoked salmon and
Escargots De Bourgome. The
Terrine Maison a I'Armagnac
was an unflawed but unexcep
tional rendition of home-made
pate.
Among the four soups at Les
Provinces, Bisque d'Ecrevisses
de Homards ($5.25), cream of
fresh crayfish or of fresh Maine
lobster, was truly inspiring. Al
though the pastry topping was
slightly undercooked, this (and

the 20-minute wait) is a far from
adequate excuse tor not order
ing this glorious dish. Top re
commendation.
Salade de Champignons
(mushroom salad, $1) is a de
served favorite at Les Pro
vinces. The distinctive dressing
did not mask the flavor of the
fresh mushrooms. The one
serving was more than enough
for two. I had been looking
forward to trying this salad
again since my last visit to Les
Provinces two years ago. I was
not disappointed.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck
flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard
(stuffed breast of duck,
$10/50), a house specialty is
outstanding. Also recom

mended is Medallion de Veau
Forestiere, veal with mus
hroom and sherry sauce,
($11.25).
The Escalope de Saumon a
I'Oseille (salmon with sorrel,
$9) was marvelous, even for
two experienced and skeptical
salmon connoisseurs from the
Pacific Northwest. As with the
mushroom salad, the sorrel
sauce was a fine yet not over
powering complement to the
salmon. Furthermore, Les Pro
vinces is known tor its skillful
preparation of seafood.
The second dish we tasted
was two quail stuffed with veal
and liver (a special that even
ing, $13) nestled in a bed of
crunchy shoestring potatoes.
One could not help but admire
the artistry of their prepara
tion. However, the waiter
failed to warn us ot the exces
sive saltiness of the sauce. Fie
paid for his oversight by drag

ging to our table pitcher after
pitcher of water.
All entrees are served with
side dishes of fresh vegetables
and potatoes, which, for once,
were noticeably cooked to per
fection.
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux
Fraises (strawberry tart, $2.50);
Jartelette Chaude aux Pummes
(hot apple tart, $2); and, Snuf
fle Grand Marnier ($5.75). The
