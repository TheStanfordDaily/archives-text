This as yet little-known restaurant was opened four
months ago by two Frenchmen with established reputa
tions in Palo Alto. Both were formerly at "La Terrasse,'
Raoul as chef and Michel as manager. You may also recall
Michel from his days catering brunches at the Palo Alto
Holiday Inn. The two have combined forces to prepare and
serve distinctive French food in this small restaurant.
The menu is typically French and includes such dishes as
terrine (similar to pate), escargots, frogs' legs, duck a
I'orange along with more familiar meat dishes. However,
the house particularly prides itself on its seafood, fresh
daily and on its Southern (Provencal) French cuisine, which
requires generous quantities of butter, tomato and garlic.
Provencal cuisine is not grand, rather it is a particular style
of cuisine de famille (family cooking).
This makes it more accessible to most palates, if less
spectacular than classic haute cuisine. However, all the
classic French cooking principles still apply here: ingre
dients must be fresh and of excellent quality. Preparation
should ensure that the fish or meat's natural flavor is
brought out, not masked, by the sauce.
Raoul hails from Avignon, which probably explains why a
little extra feeling seems to go into the preparation of the
Southern seafood dishes, as in Scallops Provencale, the
special dish of the day we sampled. The scallops, sauteed
with butter, garlic, tomato and mushroom, were just ten
der, and happily not overpowered by the other ingredients.
Raoul uses garlic to heighten flavors, not to kill them.
The entree I chose was the carre d'agneau (rack of lamb
with herbs), a plate which is rarely prepared well in this
country. Here, however, the meat was of good quality and
its flavor preserved in baking. The result was good, al
though lacking the extra touch that could make it excep
tional.
Most entrees are priced from $8 to $9.50, with two excep
tions: the Bouillabaisse (highly seasoned fish stew from
Marseille) and veal in champagne sauce ($ll each). All
entrees include the soup of the day, a plain salad (with a
good vinaigrette dressing) and fresh vegetables. The soup
was leek and potato on this occasion; the vegetables were
zucchini, carrots and potatoes — the green vegetable just
barely cooked. All portions are generous, and their presen
tation pleasing to the eye.
For the extra-hungry or the more adventurous diner,
there are a few a la carte starters, such as escargots and
mussels (moules marinieres) at $2.50 The escargots were
satisfactory; and an onion soup ($1) was better than aver
age.
The chocolate mousse dessert I found slightly disap
pointing, perhaps because adapted to American tastes. The
profiterelees seemed good judging by their popularity.
Although the wine list is small, it comprises French and
California wines; there is also a California house wine by
the carafe.
The surroundings are pleasant and unpretentious, with
subdued lighting and fresh flowers on each table. The
atmosphere is relaxed, and you may set your own pace for
the meal; the service, while not perfect, is good-natured
and unobtrusive.
