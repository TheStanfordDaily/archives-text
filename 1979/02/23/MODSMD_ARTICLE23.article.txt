Crepes

1 1/2 cup milk
1 cup flour
pinch salt
Beat eggs and milk together. Add flour slowly while beating. Add
salt ana stir. Beat until smooth. Let rest one hour or as long as
possible until air bubbles escape. Heat skillet on medium heat
with 1 teaspoon butter or margarine to prevent sticking. Add
margarine as needed. When margarine melts, add approximately
1/8 cup of batter. Pick up skillet in nand and spread batter over the
bottom of the pan by turning the pan. After a few tries, you'll
understand! The first crepe is always a disaster. Using a pancake
turner, turn crepe and cook on both sides. Should be a light
brown shade. Makes a dozen crepes.
Variety in crepe dishes depends on the filling or topping.
Crepes can be rolled in sugar and topped with flaming brandy
(just heat brandy on stove, pour and light) or liqueur (Grand
Marnier or Napoleon). A great dessert crepe can be filled with ice
cream and topped with chocolate sauce.
Crepfc dishes for lunch or dinner can also be filled with a variety
of things. Mushrooms and onions sauteed in butter and mixed
with a cup of sour cream make a great filling. Crepes filled with
grated cheese and hot chili peppers add a different twist.
