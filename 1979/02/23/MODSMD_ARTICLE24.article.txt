# 'Eccentric Frenchman' sold Farm to Leland

,\ weathered bridge mys
teriously spans a grassy field
near Frenchman's Road on
campus, while farther away
a feudal fortress guards Old
Page Mill Road. These struc
tures are largely forgotten
and tew students today have
heard the legends of their
builder, the "eccentric
Frenchman " Peter Coutts
— the man who sold "The
Farm" to Leland Stanford.
According to a book by
Phyllis Butler, Coutts ar
rived in Palo Alto (then cal
led Mayfield) in 1875 with
his invalid wife, their young
son and daughter and a
governess. Charmed by
California, he described it
as "the coming country of
the world" and bought 1400
acres of what is nnw Univer
sity land. He caJed for "100
men not afraid j work,"
and began building a net
work of canals, the round

brick tower in the nearby
hills, and a steepled watch
tower near his cottage. As
early Mayfield residents
watched with suspicion,
rumors spread, stimulating
a tradition of Frenchman
tales.
Coutts' wealth was not
merely a rumor. He seemed
to spend money "like wa
ter," hosting town picnics
and contests and paying his
employees generous
wages, according to news
paper articles of the era. His
son Albert was similarly ex
travagant. Newspapers said
that his favorite game was to
throw silver dollars into the
bushes and pay his friends
$2 each not to hunt for
them.
Coutts' reticence to dis
cuss the source of his
wealth and his past excited
people's imaginations. A
Daily article of the 1910s said
the people speculated that

Coutts had embezzled his
money from the French
army and hidden this "sto
len treasure" in the six can
als which also served as "es
cape passages." While his
watchtower was said to have
been used to guard his es
tate from the enemy, his
feudal tower in the hills
supposedly stored ammuni
tion. However, some
sources said the most vivid
fantasists claimed Coutts
kept his "mad" wife locked
in the tower and that the
governess was actually Em
press Eugenie, Napoleon's
wife.
Different intentions
Coutts' buildings were ac
tually intended for less ad
venturesome purposes. In
his watchtower, Coutts
busied himself not spying
but reading, and his library
housed an extensive collec
tion of rare books valued at
1 million francs at his death.

The fortress actually stored
water brought from under
ground springs by the can
als to his impressive farm.
This innovative irrigation
system, the dairy's top qual
ity butter, and the opulent
living conditions of Coutts'
animals made his farm fam
ous. According to an article
in the 1878 Californian, each
cow had his own groom and
a silver bell inscribed with
such French names as
Madame Cosette. Occupy
ing his own stall and set
apart from the other cattle
was the Frenchman's black
ox, Monsieur le Curate.
Coutts intended "Aye
shire Farm, as it was called
to be only part of an elabo
rate French estate. "I do
things just as if I expected to
live 400 years," he boasted
at the time. While it is be
lieved he built the founda
tions of twin chateaux, it is
certain that he did complete
the garden that was in
tended to surround them.
Poplars, cedars and pines
bordered an artificial lake
filled with "numerous tiny
islets" and bridges like the
one near Frenchman's
Road.
While building his estate,
Coutts and his family stayed
in a cottage which early
Mayfield residents claimed
was a duplicate of Le Petit
Trianon at Versailles, and is
today the headquarters for
Escondido Village.
David Jordan, the Univer
sity's first president, moved
into this cottage in 1891, and
named it Escondite or hid
ing place. During his
monthly "at homes," |or

dan would recount Fren
chman tales to intrigued
freshmen. According to the
popular story, Coutts and
his family suddenly disap
peared after a visit from a
member of the French Con
sulate, escaping by means
of the canals.
University students em
bellished this story over the
years. In an 1899 issue of the
Sequoia magazine, two stu
dents claimed that while
exploring the canals, they
had found a cave and five
skeletons; they speculated
that during his escape,
Coutts had lost the key to
thiscaveand heand his fam
ily were buried alive.
Treasure
The San Francisco
Chronicle reported in 1918
that a University sopho
more intended to
thoroughly search the can
als for $60,000 which the
student believed to be the
remainder of the Fren
chman's original treasure.
The student asserted that
before Coutts' death in Fr
ance in front of a firing
squad, he had de
vulged his hiding place to
Governor Stanford, who re
covered $3000.
When Coutts' grand
daughter C.E. Berlin ar
rived here in 1959 to refute
these claims and recount
her grandfather's true his
tory, the long standing
campus tradition of Fren
chman legends began to
die. She announced that
Coutts was a political exile,
not a "fugitive from jus
tice," as many had believed.
Coutts had been the

editor of the Republican
anti-royalist newspaper La
Liberte and the wealthy
owner of a private bank.
Pressure from Napoleon
Ill's regime, ill health and
finally an unprofitable bank
ing transaction motivated
him to leave France, Berlin
said. As many had assumed,
his name was not really
Peter Coutts, but Paulin
Caperon. When he and his
family departed in 1880, it was
not to avoid French gov
ernment agents, but to re
claim their extensive French

estates.
Coutts lake has long
been filled in, his canals
boarded up. Escondite and
the library are hidden
amongst modern structures
while his tower and bridge
stand out of place and
alone. Vet as one student
wrote in 1917, the Fren
chman has "given a kind of
flavor to these hills." He has
provided the campus with
the "unexpected" and "un
necessary,'' a bit of mystery
and European enchant
ment.

This bridge near Frenchman's road mysteriously spans nothing but grass. In the 1H()0s, however, the
bridge was part of a small park, complete with artificial lakes and tiny islets.

"mad" wife of the owner of c ampus lands before Leland Stanford.
