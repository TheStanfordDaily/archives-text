# Tighter laws for smoking in planes

### 
Washington (AP) â€” Tight
ened restrictions on smoking
aboard commercial aircraft
take effect today.
The new Civil Aeronautics
Board rules follow a study of
the problem of smoking in the
closed conditions of aircraft.
Besides the formal comments
and suggestions from or
ganized groups, letters and
cards from than 51,000
individuals were considered by
the board.
Particular note is taken of
cigar and pipe smoke in the
new rule, as the agency found
smoke from these two sources
was particularly offensive to
nonsmokers.
So, the rule calls for addi
tional segregation of pipe and
cigar smokers with individual
airlines being left to decide
how to do this.
The CAB suggests seating
cigar and pipe smokers in the
portion of smoking area most
distant from nonsmokers.
And, it adds, airlines may
adopt the policy of permitting
cigar and pipe smoking only
after determining that other
passengers do not object.
While current rules provide
for nonsmoking areas, the new
rule will require that "all" pas
sengers who want to be in such
an area be accommodated and
there be a means of expanding
the area if necessary. At the
minimum, however, the
nonsmoking area must be at
least two rows, and there must
be a nonsmoking area for each
class.
Finally, the new rule requires
that no smoking be allowed in
aircraft when the ventilation
system is not in full operation,
such as while waiting for
takeoff.
