Harold and Maude ★★★★
Old Mill
Harold is a young man whose
hobby is attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and inherent goodness of
humanity. And it's clear from the
beginning that the two are de
stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principals are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Cordon, and Cat
Stevens supplied the tunes.

The National Film Board of
Canada, known around the
world for the production of fine

package of what they feel to be
their best. The cartoons include
Norman McClaren's Neighbors,
a simple parable about two

the possession of a flower, Evolu

winner of the 1978 Academy
Award for best animated short.

Violette ★ ★ *
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.

Old Mill
When a capable hack like Wil
liam Friedkin (The Exorcist)
doesn't care about the material,

indifferent movie; it's like a kid

Familiar faces (Peter Falk, Warren
Oates, Peter Boyle) stumble
around and act like they want
their checks fast. A mess of the
lowest order.

Duck Soup * ★ * *
Monday, Cubberley
The Marx brothers hold a re
volution in this typically insane
1933 comedy. This was their fifth
film and they've reached the
height of their comedic talents:
few other films have such a per
fect combination of jokes, in
sults, and sight gags. The ending
is especially anarchic: they sim
ply blow everything to bits. The
very durable Margaret Dumont
is, as usual, the target of much of
the humor.

Dona Flor and Her
Two Husbands * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Dona Flor, a widow who mar
ries a dependable but none too
exciting druggist, manages to get
the best of two worlds when her
rakish first husband comes back
from the dead to return romance
to her life. Dona Flor is a warm,
often very funny import from
Brazil.

Hardcore *
Palo Alto Square
Writer-director Paul Schrader
keeps himself detached from
what he's filming; this movie's
premise —' a Calvinist
businessman from Grand Rapids
loses his daughter to California's
porno underworld and goes off
to get her back — would seem to
promise loads of emotional
theatrics, but the feeling's been
sucked out, and we're left with
Schrader's intellect and not his
guts. As the father, George C.
Scott tries hard, but he's finally
done in by the distance Schrader
keeps from the film's ugly night
world. With Season Hubley and
Peter Boyle.
—R.L.
Days of Heaven * * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy.,The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from ihe
slums of Chicago who find' ,ier
self in a radically dnlerent world
-J.M.
When You Comin' Back, Red Rider
★ ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
WYCB.RR is a generally unpleas
ant film version of the stage play
about a psychotic Vietnam vete
ran who terrorizes and
humiliates the occupants of a
cafe in a small Texas town. It
holds the attention of the audi
ence by screaming so loudly that
it's impossible to ignore; an ef
fective device, certainly, but not
one which deserves praise. Mar
joe Gortner, former child
evangelist turned actor, turns out
a noisy but ultimately shallow
characterization of the veteran.
The film merits a rating of two
stars instead of fewer because of
the performance of Stephanie Fa
racy as the fat, perpetually hope
ful waitress at the cafe: for all the
actress's affectations, she cap
tures the vulnerability that
should have been, but isn't, what
this movie is all about.
—J.M.
Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipwrecked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.
—J.M.

The Warriors it
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a '70s ver
sion of West Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. Their task is
to get back across the city with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "Lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.
—J.M.
Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Clay Theater, San Francisco
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
I?-•, ear-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.
Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Francisco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed M'A*S'H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsides; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altman's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, by the end of the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.
—).M.
The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
ifulwoman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.
— R.L.

Autumn Sonata ★★★ '/a '
Biograph, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.
Clockwork Orange
Sunday, Mem Aud
Stanley Kubrick transferred
Anthony Burgess' novel to the sc
reen by making a gruelingly vis
ual film. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near fu
ture: the issue at stake is whether
individuality is more important
than the society that must deal
with the individual. Malcolm
McDowell stars as a man whose
joy comes mainly from commit
ting acts of violence; he is ar
rested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this
singularly disturbing film.
—J.M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
Interiors ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels of
Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly, the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

★★★★
Clay Theater, San Francisco
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi

Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
I?-•, ear-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view

characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver

The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite

a hack's mentality ("all you need

Autumn Sonata ★★★ '/a '
Biograph, Palo Alto

this Ingmar Bergman movie

frustrating, because its language

Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com

what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex

The movie survives its overlong

it often does, brilliantly, the per

Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple

Harold is a young man whose

Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Violette Noziere poisoned her

press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.

When a capable hack like Wil

Duck Soup * ★ * *
Monday, Cubberley
The Marx brothers hold a re
volution in this typically insane
1933 comedy. This was their fifth
film and they've reached the
height of their comedic talents:
few other films have such a per
fect combination of jokes, in
sults, and sight gags. The ending
is especially anarchic: they sim
ply blow everything to bits. The
very durable Margaret Dumont
is, as usual, the target of much of
the humor.

Dona Flor and Her

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Dona Flor, a widow who mar
ries a dependable but none too
exciting druggist, manages to get
the best of two worlds when her
rakish first husband comes back
from the dead to return romance
to her life. Dona Flor is a warm,
often very funny import from

Hardcore *
Palo Alto Square
Writer-director Paul Schrader
keeps himself detached from
what he's filming; this movie's
premise —' a Calvinist
businessman from Grand Rapids
loses his daughter to California's
porno underworld and goes off
to get her back — would seem to
promise loads of emotional
theatrics, but the feeling's been
sucked out, and we're left with
Schrader's intellect and not his
guts. As the father, George C.
Scott tries hard, but he's finally
done in by the distance Schrader
keeps from the film's ugly night
world. With Season Hubley and
Peter Boyle.
—R.L.
Days of Heaven * * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy.,The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from ihe
slums of Chicago who find' ,ier
self in a radically dnlerent world
-J.M.
When You Comin' Back, Red Rider
★ ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
WYCB.RR is a generally unpleas
ant film version of the stage play
about a psychotic Vietnam vete
ran who terrorizes and
humiliates the occupants of a
cafe in a small Texas town. It
holds the attention of the audi
ence by screaming so loudly that
it's impossible to ignore; an ef
fective device, certainly, but not
one which deserves praise. Mar
joe Gortner, former child
evangelist turned actor, turns out
a noisy but ultimately shallow
characterization of the veteran.
The film merits a rating of two
stars instead of fewer because of
the performance of Stephanie Fa
racy as the fat, perpetually hope
ful waitress at the cafe: for all the
actress's affectations, she cap
tures the vulnerability that
should have been, but isn't, what
this movie is all about.
—J.M.
Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipwrecked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.
—J.M.

The Warriors it
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a '70s ver
sion of West Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. Their task is
to get back across the city with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "Lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.

★★★★
Clay Theater, San Francisco
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe

Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing

Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Francisco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed M'A*S'H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsides; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altman's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, by the end of the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.

The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
ifulwoman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.

Autumn Sonata ★★★ '/a '
Biograph, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.
Clockwork Orange
Sunday, Mem Aud
Stanley Kubrick transferred
Anthony Burgess' novel to the sc
reen by making a gruelingly vis
ual film. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near fu
ture: the issue at stake is whether
individuality is more important
than the society that must deal
with the individual. Malcolm
McDowell stars as a man whose
joy comes mainly from commit
ting acts of violence; he is ar
rested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this
singularly disturbing film.
—J.M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
Interiors ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels of
Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly, the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Harold is a young man whose

ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altman's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, by the end of the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.

The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
ifulwoman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.
— R.L.

Autumn Sonata ★★★ '/a '
Biograph, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.
Clockwork Orange
Sunday, Mem Aud
Stanley Kubrick transferred
Anthony Burgess' novel to the sc
reen by making a gruelingly vis
ual film. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near fu
ture: the issue at stake is whether
individuality is more important
than the society that must deal
with the individual. Malcolm
McDowell stars as a man whose
joy comes mainly from commit
ting acts of violence; he is ar
rested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this
singularly disturbing film.
—J.M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
Interiors ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels of
Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly, the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—R.L.

Better than TV ★
Guano


—Photo courtesy Edie Baskin. Saturday Review
Two good movies and one interesting failure play in the campus
area this week. Clockwise from right: Groucho Marx is at his
wisecracking best in Duck Soup. The performance of Stephanie
Feracy is the main reason to see the otherwise disappointing When
You Comin' B.tck, Red Rider. And Terence Malick's hauntingly
beautiful Days of Heaven opens today in Bay Area theaters.


Harold and Maude ★★★★
Old Mill
Harold is a young man whose
hobby is attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and inherent goodness of
humanity. And it's clear from the
beginning that the two are de
stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principals are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Cordon, and Cat
Stevens supplied the tunes.
—Jim Mattson

Animation Festival * *■ * ★
Saturday, Kresge
The National Film Board of
Canada, known around the
world for the production of fine
animated films, put together this
package of what they feel to be
their best. The cartoons include
Norman McClaren's Neighbors,
a simple parable about two
people who come to blows over
the possession of a flower, Evolu
tion, a new interpretation of how
life began, and Sand Castles, the
winner of the 1978 Academy
Award for best animated short.
—J.M.

Violette ★ ★ *
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
dies but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the movie's depth comes from
the bravura performance of
Isabelle Huppert as Violette; she
captures the spoiled, confused
air of this curiously sympathetic
murderess.
—J.M.
The Brink's /oh
Old Mill
When a capable hack like Wil
liam Friedkin (The Exorcist)
doesn't care about the material,
watch out This te a stubbornly
indifferent movie; it's like a kid
who can do better but just won't.
Familiar faces (Peter Falk, Warren
Oates, Peter Boyle) stumble
around and act like they want
their checks fast. A mess of the
lowest order.
—Ron Lillejord

Duck Soup * ★ * *
Monday, Cubberley
The Marx brothers hold a re
volution in this typically insane
1933 comedy. This was their fifth
film and they've reached the
height of their comedic talents:
few other films have such a per
fect combination of jokes, in
sults, and sight gags. The ending
is especially anarchic: they sim
ply blow everything to bits. The
very durable Margaret Dumont
is, as usual, the target of much of
the humor.
—).M.
Dona Flor and Her
Two Husbands * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Dona Flor, a widow who mar
ries a dependable but none too
exciting druggist, manages to get
the best of two worlds when her
rakish first husband comes back
from the dead to return romance
to her life. Dona Flor is a warm,
often very funny import from
Brazil.
—J.M.

Hardcore *
Palo Alto Square
Writer-director Paul Schrader
keeps himself detached from
what he's filming; this movie's
premise —' a Calvinist
businessman from Grand Rapids
loses his daughter to California's
porno underworld and goes off
to get her back — would seem to
promise loads of emotional
theatrics, but the feeling's been
sucked out, and we're left with
Schrader's intellect and not his
guts. As the father, George C.
Scott tries hard, but he's finally
done in by the distance Schrader
keeps from the film's ugly night
world. With Season Hubley and
Peter Boyle.
—R.L.
Days of Heaven * * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy.,The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from ihe
slums of Chicago who find' ,ier
self in a radically dnlerent world
-J.M.
When You Comin' Back, Red Rider
★ ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
WYCB.RR is a generally unpleas
ant film version of the stage play
about a psychotic Vietnam vete
ran who terrorizes and
humiliates the occupants of a
cafe in a small Texas town. It
holds the attention of the audi
ence by screaming so loudly that
it's impossible to ignore; an ef
fective device, certainly, but not
one which deserves praise. Mar
joe Gortner, former child
evangelist turned actor, turns out
a noisy but ultimately shallow
characterization of the veteran.
The film merits a rating of two
stars instead of fewer because of
the performance of Stephanie Fa
racy as the fat, perpetually hope
ful waitress at the cafe: for all the
actress's affectations, she cap
tures the vulnerability that
should have been, but isn't, what
this movie is all about.
—J.M.
Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipwrecked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.
—J.M.

The Warriors it
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a '70s ver
sion of West Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. Their task is
to get back across the city with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "Lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.
—J.M.
Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Clay Theater, San Francisco
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
I?-•, ear-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.
Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Francisco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed M'A*S'H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsides; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altman's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, by the end of the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.
