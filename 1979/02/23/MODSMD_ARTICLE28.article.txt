# Cagers face Oregon
## 
### Chris Haft 
Stanford's varsity basketball
team cioses its home season
with 8 p.m. games Saturday
against Oregon and Monday
against Oregon State, thereaf
ter leaving Maples Pavilion to
the Cardinal volleybalters, in
tramural teams and summer
cheerleading camps.
Despite Stanford's and Ore
gon's lowly records and Ore
gon State's virtual elimination
from any Pacific-10 Conference
title chances, these games
have a lot of meaning for the
participants.
The seventh-place Cards, 5-9
in conference play, and the
ninth place, 5-10 Ducks will
each be trying to achieve a re
spectable niche in Pac-10 soci
ety. Both teams could conceiv
ably finish fifth; by the same
token, both squads could also
finish last.
Oregon State, meanwhile,
has loftier ambitions. The
Beavers, 10-5 in league and 17-7
overall, trail second-place (JSC
by just one-half game. Since
the NCAA might take a second
team from the Pac-10 for the
national tournament, it is ob
vious that the Beavers still
maintain incentive.
Not only do these games
represent the Cards' final bows
for 1978-79, but they are also
the last games at Maples for
senior guards Paul Ciovacchini
and Wolfe Perry. The pair will
be honored, along with their
parents, in ceremonies preced
ing Saturday's game.
" I hey mean something extra
because they came when I
came four years ago," said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso of
Ciovacchini and Perry. "I'll al
ways have a special place for
those guys in my heart."
Heart is what the Cards will
need a lot of against Oregon.
When Stanford lost to the
Ducks 68-55 |an. 27 at McAr

thur Court, the Cards managed
just three offensive rebounds
against the small but stubborn
Ducks and kimberly Belton re
ceived considerable attention
from Oregon's defense, scor
ing just four points.
Oregon's starters at guard
should be 6-foot-2 senior Rob
Closs, averaging 10.5 points a
game, and 6-1 junior John Mur
ray, scoring 8.1 each outing.
Closs leads the Pac-10 in free
throw shooting with an 85 per
cent figure (68 for 80).
Kelvin Small, a 6-8 bruiser, is
another accurate charity-stripe
marksman, converting on 81.5
percent of his free throws dur
ing conference games. Averag
ing 10.2 points and 6.6 re
bounds a games, Small will
start at one forward spot along
with 6-7 sophomore Phil
Barner.
Center Dan Hartshorne mis
sed the last Stanford-Oregon
clash with a bad knee, but he
will be in the pivot Saturday
night. Hartshorne the
Ducks in rebounding with 7.0
boards a game, and his 10.5
scoring average matches Closs
for the team lead.
None of these starters, how
ever, hurt Stanford in Eugene
as much as reserve guard Stu
Lyon, who came off the bench
to score a career-high 16
points. Other top substitutes
for Coach |im Haney are
freshman guard Barry Walker
and 6-9 sophomore post Mike
Clark.
Next to Oregon State, how
ever, the Ducks — and most
other teams — look weak. The
Beavers are blessed with what
may be the most talented
group in the league.
In their 73-48 thrashing of
Stanford jan. 26, the Beavers
shot a school-record 71.1 per
cent (32 for 45) from the floor
and played a suffocating zone
defense.

"We're going to have to
solve their pressing defense,"
Dißiaso said. "They have great
team quickness."
Two of the quicker Beavers
are guards Mark Radford and
Ray Blume. Both are sopho
mores, both are scoring in
double figures (Radford 14.5,
Blume 13.8) and both are po
tential pro prospects. Blume
also ranks second in the con
ference in steals with 2.2
ripoffs a game.
juniors Dwayne Allen and
Tony Martin start at forward,
though quick-gunning Jeff
Stoutt, fourth in scoring for the
Beavers with 10.1 points a
game, also sees a lot of action.
At center is 6-10'/2 sopho
more Steve Johnson, one of
the conference's — and now
probably one of the nation's —
premier big men.
Johnson simply destroyed
Stanford in Corvallis, scoring
26 points while making all nine
of his shots from the floor.
Overall, Johnson is averaging
18.3 points and 6.6 rebounds a
game.
No major lineup changes are
anticipated for Stanford.
Ciovacchini's hamstring has
healed, enabling him to return
to the floor after missing
Saturday's game against
California. Dißiaso did not an
nounce his starting center,
though Orlando Ward, who
had a fine game against Cal
with 10 points and nine re
bounds, will likely getthe nod.
One game that should be
almost as interesting as either
of these two is the Saturday
night preliminary between
KZSU and KSAN radio stations.
Tipoff time is 6:30 p.m., and the
gates will be opened early for
all eager fans.
Leading KZSU will be station
manager Tom Price, business
manager Tim Bruer, sports di
rector Rick Ostiller and mascot
Mike Lopez.
