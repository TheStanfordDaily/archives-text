# Card cinders fly tomorrow

Even in the midst of
downpouring rain, when
springtime is mentioned,
thoughts drift to sunshine,
beach trips, and tans.
But Payton Jordan, head
coach of the Stanford track
team, has already turned his at
tention toward the spring track
season, which opens Saturday
in a triangular with Hayward
State at long-time rival San Jose
State. The hammer throw leads
the competition at 10:15 a.m.
and the 400-:neter race starts at
11 a.m.
After the points from all 17
events have been estimated
according to the favorites, San
Jose State comes out ahead by
a single point, 82-81. Coach
Jordan feels that the total will
"come down to which team is
most fired up." He says Stan
ford is "going in with a positive
attitude."
Concerning this year's team,
Coach Jordan said, "As good as
San Jose State is, Stanford's
team is young and has shown a
great improvement in their
style. I have a feeling that, with
these young additions (to our
team) we'll be a better team
than last year."
Coach Jordan also men
tioned a certain "speed-city"
title which arose from the
rivalry between the Stanford
and San Jose State sprinters.
Stanford won this informal title
last year, and both teams are
going for it again this season.
In the 100-meter dash, Dar
rin Nelson at 10.3 is pitted
against Dave Thomas of San
Jose State at 10.2. The two
sprinters hold equal times in
the 200-meter dash with the
time of 21.2 seconds.
Three men are "head to
head" in the 800-meter race,
according to Coach Jordan.
Mark Stillman of Stanford
holds the school record of
150.8. John Schaer from Ore
gon is second in this group
with the time of 151.3, while
Bob Waharny of San Jose State
runs at 151.8 seconds.
"San Jose State is one of the
top leaders in the NCAA and is
fortified with outstanding per
sonnel," said Coach Jordan.
"This comes out quite appa
rently in the field events,

where they have great
strength."
Some of the more even field
events include the long-jump,
with Darrin Nelson taking on
Essodina Atchade of San Jose.
In the discus, Coach Jordan
feels there is a "toss-up" bet
ween Sutherland of San Jose
and Rick Buss of Stanford, who

holds a 178' average and is
"throwing well in pre-season."
In the triple-jump, Cardinal
Clay Bullwinkel averages 48'3"
and goes against Mark White
who jumps 48'8".
Ken Margerum is pitted
against Mark Kirtman in the
110-meter high hurdles. Coach
Jordan expects a "heck of an

exciting race" in the 400-meter
intermediate hurdles. A .3 sec
ond spread separates four
men.
San Jose's Don Finley races
at 54.2 seconds, with Kurt
Roessler, Greg Muhoen, and
Garry Schumway, all of Stan
ford, coming in close behind
with times of 54.5, 54.6, and
54.8, respectively.
When it comes to the more
lop-sided events, San Jose
shows strength in the 400-
meter dash, the pole vault, the
high jump, and the javelin.
Stanford's strengths include
the steeplechase, hammer
throw, two-mile run and the
10,000-meter run.
San Jose's Stephen
Chetkwonay, a "mighty excit
ing performer," according to
Coach Jordan, sprints at 45.4
seconds. But Gordy Banks of
Stanford is a "tough conten
der" and may prevent the
probably one-two placement
of San Jose's men in this race.
In the pole vault, Coach Jor
dan termed San Jose "abso
lutely awesome." The Spartans
have Greg Woepse, who
climbs 17'6", and Kim Black,
who is "right behind him at
17'." In the high jump, Rob
Gibbs, at 7'iVi", helps his San
Jose teammate Gale Pritehart at
7'l" to allow the Spartans to
hold an advantage in this
event. Canadian champion
Mike Lansford throws the jave
lin 241' and just became a Spar
tan this year.
Stanford, however, "should
go one-two-three in the steep
lechase," said Coach Jordan.
Bob Haldeman leads the pack
of Cards in that event.
Dave Thomson reinforces
the hammer throwing event for
Stanford. Coach Jordan said of
Thomson, "He's one of the
leading hammer throwers in
the Pac-10." Cardinal Rod
Berry, from England, has run
internationally and is a favorite
in this two-mile run.
Coach Jordan said the
"swing event" in this opening
meet could be the 1500-meter
race. Tom Lobsinger of Stan
ford holds a .2 second advan
tage over his San Jose State op
ponent Larry Ross. Jordan
sums up the event by saying,
"It should be a classic."
