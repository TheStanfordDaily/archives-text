# Little Eleven Conference begins 4-day marathon

Philadelphia, PA â€” Two hundred students
from the eight Ivy League schools, the Uni
versity of Chicago and Stanford convened
on the University of Pennsylvania campus
last night for the start of the Little Eleven
Conference.
The four-day conference will give student
delegates the opportunity to trade ideas and
discuss solutions on various undergraduate
issues.
Speaking at the opening ceremonies,
Leonard Cinsburg, a junior at Penn, said the
conference is "an exchange of views" where
students from different schools can discuss
their different solutions to common prob
lems.
Ginsburg said nearly 800 people around
the country conducted research for the con
ference, producing a total of over 40,000
pages describing each school's present

policies and programs under eight specific
topics.
The conference will consist of committee
meetings, one committee assigned to each
of the eight topics, where delegates from
each school will present the results of their
research and then discuss possible solu
tions.
Kathy Ferrington, a Stanford delegate on
the Student Life committee, said she
hoped that the primary focus of the confer
ence would be to discuss specific solutions
with people whose perspectives and experi
ence were different.
"We wouldn't have to go all the way to
Philadelphia just to trade data," she said.
Cinsburg said that after the conference
delegates could go back to their administra
tions and be in a position not to demand, but
to suggest things from a foundation of care
ful study.
The eight topics to be discussed are
academics and advising, extracurricular ac

tivities, minority affairs, student govern
ment, tuition and financial aid, women's af
fairs, the university role in political and so
cial affairs and student life.
Penn President Martin Meyerson hailed
the Little Eleven conference as a step toward
developing innovative programs in Ameri
can universities.
Speaking after Cinsburg in the opening
ceremony, Meyerson said that "great risk
taking ventures in higher education today
seem few and far between."
At the turn of the century, 14 schools
joined together to form the Association of
American Universities, according to Meyer
son. These schools had "a kind of self
assurance that allowed them to take risks,"
he said. Thus they played important part
in the development of American educa
tion."
Meyerson lamented that this willingness
to take risks in developing new programs
had diminished among American univer

sities, but told the delegates he believed
they could help reverse this trend.
Stanford's 20-person delegation arrived in
Philadelphia yesterday around noon and
checked into the Holiday Inn on the Penn
campus where the conference was being
held.
After attending the opening ceremonies, a
talk by famed inventor and philosopher
Buckminster Fuller, and a banquet, the Stan
ford delegation split into its respective
committees in conjunction with the dele
gates from the other schools and worked on
agendas for the conference.
Many of the delegates said they expected
there would be some difference of opinion
as to what should be on each committee's
agenda, since there is not enough time to
fully discuss each of the issues covered by
each committee and it is expected that most
schools will have some pet topics they wish
to have discussed.
Stanford's Rob Harris of the academics

and advising committee said that he would
like to discuss overseas studies, co-terminal
programs and advising. He said he wasn't
sure whether these would indeed be the to
pics discussed, saying, "we probably won't
have any idea of what's going on until to
morrow (Friday)."
The original conference plan called for
each school to send a preliminary report
from each of their committees to the confer
ence organizers, who would in turn send a
copy to each school before they reached
Philadelphia.
However, few of these reports were actu
ally sent.
Most of the Stanford delegates received
only one or two reports from the other nine
schools before yesterday.
Those reports which were received were
considered by Stanford delegates to be
quite good, but not as thorough as the aver
age Stanford report, which ran over 50
pages.
