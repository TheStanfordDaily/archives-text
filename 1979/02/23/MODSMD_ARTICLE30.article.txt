### Rich Martinez 
It took most of the first half
of Tuesday evening's game be
fore the Stanford womens'
basketball team awoke. It then
yawned to victory over the
Northern California Athletic
Conference's cellar inhabit
ants, the University of the
Pacific, 82-53.
The Cards played one of
their most uninspired halves of
the season and the Tigers took
advantage of the situation by
running up an early 15-10 lead.
Everything was falling tor
| Pacific and Stanford obviously
i had troubles getting psyched
! for such a game. Coming off
the thriller against Cal and an

ticipating an all-out struggle
against league-leading San
lose State, the Cards experi
enced a brief emotional lull.
"I told myself before the
game that I would be
psyched," said )eanne Ruark.
"But during the first half we
didn't concentrate at all."
Pacific maybe short on talent
but the Tigers possessed ample
drive as they played excellent
team ball during the tirst
twenty minutes. The women
from Stockton exploited Stan
ford' Swiss cheese-like 2-3
zone defense as forward Sonya
Monroe scored with relative
ease underneath.
Coach Dotty McCrea's ire

proved to be an effective
stimulant for the dormant
team. Stanford took control
midway through the half and a
40-32 lead going to the lockers.
The women played spirited
ball after the break and things
looked back to normal. Shift
ing to a man-on-man defense,
Stanford held the Tigers to a
single basket for a nine-minute
stretch. Meanwhile the Cards
increased their lead to
twenty-one, 64-43, and McCrea
emptied the bench with seven
minutes remaining.
The reserves made the most
of their playing time as they in
creased the already lop-sided
margin. Beth Boylan attracted
much attention with her torrid
outside shooting and Sue
Thomas played aggressively
under the boards.
Angie Paccione led the Stan
ford 29-point romp wih a 16
point effort while Ruark and
Louise Smith grabbed nine and
seven rebounds, respectively.
The Cardinals travel to San lose
tomorrow evening to face the
first place Spartans. Losing by
twenty in their first meeting,
the Cards plan to change their
game plan for this contest.
"We'll run a control type of
fense," remarked McCrea. "It
is very difficult to run with that
team. We mustn't be physically
intimidated by them if we hope
to stay in the game."
