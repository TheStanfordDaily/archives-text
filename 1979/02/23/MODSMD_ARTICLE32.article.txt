# Gymnasts up for mild weekend
## 
### Dean Eyre 
In comparison with last
weekend's travels, the
schedule for Stanford's gym
nasts over the next couple of
days is merely mild-mannered.
In a 7:10 p.m. match-up to
night the men are hosted by
Chico State while the women
cross the bay to face Berkeley
Sunday at 7 p.m.
lackie Walker's team, com
ing back down to earth after a
121.40 to 118.40 upset win over
seventh-ranked Arizona, is
aiming to bring a 5-4 record
back to campus, the first win
ning season for the two-year
old varsity sport.
If the women could bottle
the spirit that helped them
steal the spotlight from the Sun
Devils Monday night, they'd all
be millionaires.
Even if they have to resort to
being doctors or engineers to
get rich, the Cardinals will still
need that attitude to beat de
tending conference champ San
lose State in the Nor-Cals on
March 10. However, a key
point is not to disregard the
Golden Bears in the meantime.
"People started giving me
excuses for why Arizona State
did poorly," Walker said. "The
only thing different for them
was perhaps a psychologically
rougher schedule, losing to
top-ranked Fullerton Friday,
watching two girls compete at
Hayward Saturday, then com
peting Monday. They face
UCLA next week — they prob
ably overlooked us.
"I hope our girls can learn

not to let that happen to
them," Walker said.
Ignoring a painful knee in
jury, Karen Hall competed in
floor exercise to sew up the
Card victory.
"Even if Karen hadn't done
floor exercise we would've
won, but weweren't sureat the
time and didn't want to take
any chances," Walker
explained. "She'd come to me
and I had mixed feelings. . . .
The trainers beforehand had
told us she could do it — she
could not vault, but she could
do the other events depending
on how much pain she was in."
While Hall's 9.0 first-place
finish in floor was icing on the
cake, the upset was a total team
effort. Cindy Sedlund per
formed her highest scoring
vault and beam routine of the
year (the latter good for a
fourth-place tie), captain Linda
Park had one of her best beam
showings and Jeanette LaCoste
won beam with her second
highest mark of the year, ac
cording to Walker. Annie
Smith won the all-around title
and vaulting, while earning
seconds in bars, beam, and
floor.
"Berkeley's highest score
this season was 113 and they've
been averaging 107 or 108,"
Walker noted. "The lowest
we've scored is 111, so we
should beat them, but we have
to compete as if they were
Arizona State — you can fall
apart quickly if you don't get
up for every meet."
Due to the lessened pres

sure of the Cal meet, Hall is
readying for the Western Elite
/one Meet in Seattle on Satur
day and will sit out the Sunday
competition.
Sadao Hamada's men face a
Chico State squad which has
been scoring around 195
points, about five points under
the Card average.
"Their all-around guys are
not too strong as far as I know
this year, but their depth is
pretty good," Hamada said.
"Event-wise, they should be
strong on floor and in vault

ing."
With the exception of John
Marra, who has a sore shoul
der, Hamada said his team
"should be healthy." I'll prob
ably have Brodie (Lockard) or
Brian Nelson go all-around in
stead of John.
With the all-around perfor
mers working for the March 2
Pacific Southwest Gymnastics
Championships, Hamada is
"looking for the specialists to
hit good routines" in tonight's
meet.
