# Cards split doubleheader
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team proved itself mor
tal for the first time this season on Monday
night, losing the first game of a doubleheader
to Fresno State, 2-1. However, the Cardinals
came back to win the nightcap 7-3 and own an
impressive 10-1 record.
Senior Bruce Fiala pitched an outstanding
game in the loss, scattering five hits and strik
ing out five batters in eight innings, but
squandered scoring chances cost Fiala a
chance to get a win.
The Cards scored their own run in the first
inning when Mike Codiroli led off with a
single, advanced to third on a wild pickoff
throw and scored on Dave Meier's sacrifice
fly.
In the seventh )ohn Pyle and Paul Zuvella
opened with singles. Phil Wilson's sacrifice
bunt moved them to second and third, but
there thev were left stranded.

Catcher Bruce Walters began the following
inning with a double, and was replaced by
pinch-runner Mike Toothman.
Stanford wasted no time getting its bats
going in the second game, tallying four runs
in the first inning. Codiroli and Meier sing
led, and Codiroli scored with two outs when
/uvella's grounder was bobbled by the
Fresno third baseman. Wilson then sent
everybody home with a three-run homer, his
second round-tripper of the season.
Foday the Cards are scheduled to face USF
at Sunken Diamond, but may be forced to
ward inactivity by the inclement weather or
wet grounds. Pepperdine, which defeated
USC and UCLA earlier this season, invades
The Farm tomorrow for a noon doub
leheader.
