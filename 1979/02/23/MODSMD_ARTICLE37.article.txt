General oil price rise expected
New York — A general rise in oil prices could be
on the way if Saudi Arabia follows the lead of Libya
and the United Arab Emirates in raising crude oil
prices to take advantage of problems in Iran.
Analysts said they doubt the amount of oil
supplied will be much more than a fraction of
previous levels. Before political strife shut down
its oilfields in December, Iran supplied 10 percent
of the world's oil and five percent of that used by
the United States.
So far, the Saudis have resisted calls by other
nations to raise prices across the board. The
Saudis have, however, increased the price ori the
extra crude oil they are producing above normal
levels to meet the supply squeeze created by the
cutoff of Iranian oil.
"Saudi Arabia's the key," said Gary Ross, an
analyst with the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.
Another expert, Arnold Safer of Irving Trust Co.,
said, "I think each country will do it on its own, but
when the Saudis do it, that will be a signal for
everyone else."
Saudi Arabia is the biggest member of the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
the most friendly to the U.S.
Committee approves Taiwan bill
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted unanimous approval yesterday
of a "Taiwan security" bill declaring that con
tinued U.S. recognition of the Peking government
depends upon a peaceful approach by China to
wards Taiwan.
The committee, by a 10-0 vote, accepted com
promise wording declaring that a threatened at
tack by the mainland against Taiwan would be "of
grave concern to the United States."
The issue is expected to stir a fresh fight when
the bill reaches the floor of the senate. While the
vote on the Taiwan amendment was unanimous, a
clearer indication of sentiment on the committee
came earlier on wording suggested by Sen.
Charles Percy (R-lll.).

The wording approved by the committee had
won the reluctant acceptance of President Jimmy
Carter, who announced last Dec. 15 that the Un
ited States would recognize Peking while cutting
off diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
U.S. aid to Afghanistan reduced
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has or
dered a substantial cut in U.S. aid to Afghanistan,
partly because of the slaying of U.S. Ambassador
Adolph Dubs, a White House spokesman said yes
terday.
"Certainly the decision does take into account
circumstances surrounding the death of Mr.
Dubs," press secretary Jody Powell told reporters.
The presidential spokesman said U.S. economic
aid would be reduced from the current levels of
$15 million in fiscal 1979 and $17 million in 1980.
But Powell said he could not cite the new aid
figure.
"I do not have yet an exact dollar figure on the
amount of aid remaining," Powell said.
In addition, he announced that a military train
ing program costing $250,000 in fiscal 1979 would
be terminated.
Powell said small development assistance pro
jects already underway, which he characterized as
"essentially humanitarian," would continue.
Convention proposal rejected
Sacramento — A Democrat-controlled Assembly
committee dealt a stinging setback to Gov. Jerry
Brown yesterday by rejecting a proposal for a con
stitutional convention to draft a federal
balanced-budget amendment.
The 8-12 Ways and Means Committee vote on a
Brown-backed resolution was a victory for Assem
bly Speaker Leo McCarthy (D-San Francisco) in a
high-pressure lobbying battle with the Democratic
governor.
The vote came after three lengthy hearings
stretching over four weeks and virtually nonstop
campaigning on both sides — business and farm
groups joining Brown to boost the proposal, labor
siding with McCarthy against it.

Offer rejected by striking police
New Orleans — Striking police rejected a city
offer last night that would have ended a six-day
old walk-out that has a stranglehold on the festive
Mardi Cras season.
Angry union leaders said the police "are being
forced to the wall." Many officers shouted
"Strike! Strike!" as they burst from a mass meet
ing called to determine whether they would settle.
Union officials vowed to try to shut the Port of
New Oi leans — the nation's second largest — and
bring firefighters into the walkout. Garbage col
lectors had honored picket lines earlier yesterday.
Carnival and Mardi Gras parades have already
been canceled due to the walkout by members of
the Policemen's Association of Louisiana.
"This strike is escalated as of now," said union
negotiator Joseph Valenti. "That means the sanita
tion department, the fire stations, the port."
The proposal did not mention amnesty, he said.
But Jay Handelman, a spokesman for the mayor,
said an amnesty provision was worked out during
the union meeting.
Stock market falls 5.98
New York — Stock prices declined broadly yes
terday as reports indicated fighting in Vietnam and
inflation in the United States may worsen. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 5.98 to
828.57 as declining stocks outnumbered advan
cers by a margin of almost two-to-one on the New
York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume came to 26.29 million shares
against 20.05 million in the previous session.
Today's weather
San Francisco Bay Area — Partly cloudy today and
tonight. Increasing cloudiness Saturday with
chance of rain late in the day. Continued cool.
Lows in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs in the 50s.
Small craft advisory for westerly winds 15 to 30
