The University has received a
$842,604 grant from the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation to study the
training of pediatricians in handling
children's common medical prob
lems.
The foundation announced Tues
day that the University and five other
institutions would receive grants to
taling $4.8 million. The money will be
used to fund the first four years of a
new six-year training program.
"There is now universal recogni
tion that pediatrics extends far
beyond the hospital-based practice
where most training occurs," said

Dr. Ruth Cross, professor of pediat
rics and director of the new program
here.
Gross explained that young
pediatricians become familiar with
rare diseases seen in hospitals, but
are not as skilled in handling the
more common health problems of
children and adolescents seen in
general practice.
Some areas of research to be
studied include the effects of early
and late physical maturation on ado
lescent achievement, and adolescent
compliance with medication for
problems like acne, neurological
disorders and birth control.
