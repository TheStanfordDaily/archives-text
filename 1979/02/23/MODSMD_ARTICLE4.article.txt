# Libyan research contract sparks controversy over discrimination

### Tony Rupert 
A research contract with the Arab
Development Institute, an organiza
tion funded by the Libyan govern
ment, has sparked an as yet unresol
ved controversy over the University's
policy on citizenship discrimination,
according to Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan the principal
investigator on the project.
Lusignan said that the $124,000
contract to help Libya design its own
rural telephone system was under
negotiation last summer when he
was asked by the Libyans to specify
the University's anti-discrimination
policy.
The policy requires a standard
anti-discrimination provision in any
University contract that prohibits
discrimination based on national
origin. The Libyans wanted to know
whether that would include dis

crimination bafsed on citizenship.
"The Libyans were concerned be
cause of previous bad experiences
that other Arab states had had with
American universities and their at
tempts to use research contracts to
embarrass the Arab countries over
their visa policies," explained Lusig
nan.
"Libya doesn't care what students
do research on a project in the Un
ited States, but they do have a visa
policy. They will not allow Israeli or
South African citizen students to
travel to Libya."
Contract amended
Lusignan said that any problem of
discriminating against Israeli or
South African students at Stanford
was averted because the Libyans
didn't care who did the research here
and the contract was amended to
specify that Lusignan would be the

only one to travel to Libya. The Li
byans then signed the contract with
the provision prohibiting discrimina
tion based on national origin.
Lusignan also said that he had no
qualms about working for Libya. "My
research is going to help them im
prove their rural communication sys
tem," he said. "It has no military
value nor can it be misused for milit
ary purposes. I am simply helping
them to develop. I do no military
work for anyone."
When the Libyans first asked last
summer whether national origin
would include citizenship, Lusignan
said that he went to then Vice Provost
and Director of Research Gerald
Lieberman for an answer. According
to Lieberman, now Provost and act
ing Vice President, he told Lusignan
that the issue was unresolved.
Recommendations
Lieberman then asked Chemistry
Prof. Richard Holm, chairman of
the Committee on Research, to come
up with some recommendations for
the Faculty Senate on the definition
of national origin.
At the Feb. 16 Faculty Senate meet
ing, the committee recommended
that the University require that all re
search contracts with foreign gov
ernments include a provision pro
hibiting discrimination based on citi
zenship.
The Faculty Senate refused to ac
cept that recommendation and sent
the committee back to redraft the
proposal in less absolute terms.
Holm said that the committee would
meet again next week to reformulate
the policy, but would not predict the
outcome.
The University is worried about
having its foreign students discrimi
nated against, he said. If a contract is
signed with a country that won't
admit certain foreign citizens, the
occasion could arise in which some
students would be precluded from
participating on the project because
of their citizenship.
Visa policies
On the other hand, said Holm, all
countries with the possible excep
tion of Switzerland have visa policies
restricting the entry of certain
foreign citizens. The question is
whether professors here should be
precluded from doing research for
foreign countries because of these
visa policies, he said.
"This is a complicated problem
because of the double-thinking,"
said Lusignan. "We (the United
States) restrict the entry of some citi
zens, so why should Stanford poten
tially refuse a contract because
another country does so also?"

Lieberman for an answer. According
to Lieberman, now Provost and act
ing Vice President, he told Lusignan
that the issue was unresolved.
Recommendations
Lieberman then asked Chemistry
Prof. Richard Holm, chairman of
the Committee on Research, to come
up with some recommendations for
the Faculty Senate on the definition
of national origin.
At the Feb. 16 Faculty Senate meet
ing, the committee recommended
that the University require that all re
search contracts with foreign gov
ernments include a provision pro
hibiting discrimination based on citi
zenship.
The Faculty Senate refused to ac
cept that recommendation and sent
the committee back to redraft the
proposal in less absolute terms.
Holm said that the committee would
meet again next week to reformulate
the policy, but would not predict the
outcome.
The University is worried about
having its foreign students discrimi
nated against, he said. If a contract is
signed with a country that won't
admit certain foreign citizens, the
occasion could arise in which some
students would be precluded from
participating on the project because
of their citizenship.
Visa policies
On the other hand, said Holm, all
countries with the possible excep
tion of Switzerland have visa policies
restricting the entry of certain
foreign citizens. The question is
whether professors here should be
precluded from doing research for
foreign countries because of these
visa policies, he said.
"This is a complicated problem
because of the double-thinking,"
said Lusignan. "We (the United
States) restrict the entry of some citi
zens, so why should Stanford poten
tially refuse a contract because
another country does so also?"
