# Europe dollar decline causes Overseas loss

A $79,000 budget deficit in the University's Overseas Studies program
stemming from the dollar's decline in Western Europe has been pro
jected for the 1978-1979 fiscal year, according to Pat Clark, assistant
director of Overseas Studies.
Over the last decade Overseas Studies has been forced to make substan
tial budget cuts to compensate for the dollar's diminishing value. The
Overseas budget was cut in half during the University's budget readjust
ment period from 1968-1976, according to Clark.
However, "the University committed themselves to support our dollar
purchasing power" after the program reached reduced budget levels as
required, Clark said.
Programs and services will not be cut back even if the dollar falls further
because the University will maintain the dollars' purchasing power, Clark
said. Such losses will not affect overseas students more than students
here, because students there pay the same tuition, room and board fees
as students here.
Clark said students' incidental expenses will go up, however, as the
dollar declines.
One strategy to prevent losses due to dollar fluctuation was proposed
several years ago but never approved, according to Clark. This proposal
involved purchasing a certain amount of foreign currency at the begin
ning of each academic year to prevent program funds from being affected
by the exchange rate.
According to Clark, this method would also prevent the realization of
any gains if the dollar were to rise in the world market. •
Clark said that because of recent large drops in the dollar's value the
University is taking a closer look at that proposal.
The budget is not suffering as much as it might be according to Clark
because the consumer price index in most countries where the dollar is
declining is not rising very quickly.
