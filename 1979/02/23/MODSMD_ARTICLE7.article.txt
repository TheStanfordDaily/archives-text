# COSS minority subcommittee causing student dissatisfaction

### Robert Reed 
Some 25 minority students voiced
their dissatisfaction with the new
charge of the Committee on Student
Services' Sub-Committee on Minority
Affairs (CoSS-M) at a meeting of
CoSS-M Wednesday afternoon.
According to ASSU Co-president
Regina Petty, the students were
upset because the proposal for the
charge adopted two weeks before
was drawn up without minority in
put, while a separate proposal drawn
up by members of the minority
communities was given little consid
eration by CoSS in the formulation of
the charge.
CoSS-M had previously existed as
an ad hoc sub-committee of CoSS
after being formed in the 1975-76
school year. Though the charge to
this ad hoc sub-committee was
meant to last only through the 1975-
76 year, the sub-committee con
tinued to function through the next

two years.
Last year, Dean of Students James
Lyons decided that this ad hoc sub
committee should be a standing
sub-committee, and that a new
charge should be adopted.
The charge drawn up by CoSS basi
cally calls upon CoSS-M to find av
enues for more open communica
tion among minorities, CoSS, and
the Office of Student Affairs, while
carrying out special assignments
from CoSS from time to time, said
Petty.
General program
In contrast to the general prog
ram which was adopted by CoSS, the
minority proposal submitted by
Petty, who is black, listed several
specific responsibilities for CoSS-M,
including the evaluation of programs
for minorities in University resi
dences, the health of minority stu
dent organizations, the CPPC's ser
vices for minorities, psychological

counseling services, minority
freshmen orientation, as well as the
adequacy of Bookstore inventory, in
terms of publications written by
minorities and concerning minority
issues.
"The charge that Regina submitted
does express the concerns of minor
ity students," Diane Burbie, presi
dent of the Black Student Union said
at the meeting Wednesday. Rep
resentatives of the Chicano com
munity agreed with Burbie, calling
for the adoption of the minorities'
charge.
Burbie said that the adopted
charge "makes the primary concerns
of minorities secondary," explaining
that it seemed as if this charge is
more concerned with CoSS than with
minority affairs.
Specific tasks
"A subcommittee should be given
some specific tasks," urged Burbie,
