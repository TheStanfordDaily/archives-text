LONG ago. there was a wandering merchant
whose fortune was reduced by circumstance to
his riding camel and a donkey who carried his
gear Soon after passing through a small village
one day, he came across a farmer who had just
finished harvesting a wheat field Recalling a st
able owner's need lo> Jrash straw for his stable,
the merchant saw a chance to turn a small but
quick profit and offered to buy the straw But the
wanderer, having no copper, not to mention
silver or gold, was forced to offer his camel as
collateral — a clear case of the camel that
backed the broker's straw
