# Haley dictated 'Roots II'
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Everyone knows what is
needed to make a piece of fine literature. The
formula is fairly standard. You need an an
guished soul, a few tormented demons and a lot
of time.
That's the way Thomas Wolfe made Look
Homeward Angel, isn't it? And Alex Haley, isn't
that the way he made Rootsl
Haley struggled for 12 years with his demons,
roaming the world in research, sacrificing all for
the sake of his work. Endless nights, hungry
nights, spent filling those manuscript pages with
words.
But there is another way — in a plush office
with your feet up, shooting the breeze with the
guys. That's how Haley made Roots: The Next
Generations for TV, which, in a curious way, is a
literary work as outstanding as Roots.
Of course, TV's Roots 11, which concluded on
ABC last night with a powerful final chapter,
never was an actual book. )ust Alex Haley telling
stories to his TV associates and a tape recorder.
Haley explains:
"See, we had no plan whatever to make a
second film when the other one was finished.
After the last sequence of Roots, I came on and
told what happened to the family subsequently
so the viewers wouldn't be left hanging on a
hillside in Henning, Tenn.

"That film had such phenomenal results,
there was sort of a feeling that we ought to just
let it hang up there, like a beacon or something.
There was still no plan to make any new film.
"Then I began to talk about stories about the
family with Roots producer Stan Margulies and
executive producer David Wolper. Often there
wouldn't even be a plan to meet, we'd just run
into each other, and I'd tell these stories.
"Finally, I started dictating, at someone's di
rection, I can't even remember who. This was
altogether without a contract or anything at this
stage. I just dictated into a tape recorder stories
about the family subsequent to the first Roots.
And I began to realize, as they did, that there
was some damn good material there.
"I dictated what literally is a book's-worth of
material, 1000 pages of manuscript."
Haley as historian-novelist took a dozen years
to make Roots. But Haley as the Southern
storyteller, that wondrous breed, took six
months to spin the yarns that made Roots 11. Less
legitimate than Koofs?
"Well, the stories are no less dramatic, as
we've seen," Haley responds. "It's just another
form of writing. I knew the people, I knew the
stories, and I just told them. It didn't take as long
as the first book, but it was of the same wellspr
ing of material.
