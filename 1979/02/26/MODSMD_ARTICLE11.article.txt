# Eastern truckers use CB network to help motorists
## 
### 
Round Lake, N.Y. (AP) —
Six years ago, Paul Korol's
wife nearly lost her life in a
traffic accident. Now he's
trying to set up a state-wide
volunteer CB radio network
to provide help to other
motorists in trouble.
So far, his Truckers' Aid
Base system includes a net
work of 68 stations stretch
ing from Albany north to
Montreal, west to
Canajoharie, east to Lee,
Mass., and south to Selkirk
and Hudson.
'Mopstick'
Last year, Korol — his
handle is "Mopstick" — and
his 67 support bases were
on Channel 19 for 36,726
hours, bringing 18-wheelers
and four-wheelers alike traf
fic, weather and road condi
tions.
They gave directions to
2,462 truckers and 3,544
auto drivers, reported 427
accidents and aided 440
broken-down trucks and
529 cars.
Korol's Truckers' Aid Base
central takes up most of the
family dining area, sur
rounded by an elaborate
map of area highways that
lights up the location of veh
icles in trouble.
Busy in storms
Korol is employed by the
state Labor Department, but
when a storm hits, he's in

his huge swivel rocker, ear
phones on and microphone
in hand. His 40-channel CB
base station is alive with re
ports from key bases. "King
Cobra" in East Greenbush
near the Massachusetts
border, "Hillbilly Gasman"
at Saranac Lake, "Cuddles"
at Lake Placid and "Katydid"
in Canajoharie.
Korol's wife, Carol —
"Daddy's Girl" is her handle
— runs the phones and
makes steaming pots of
thick black coffee, while
son Craig picks information
off three state radio nets
and National Weather Ser
vice broadcasts.
Soon, "Mopstick" guides
a steady stream of informa
tion from the key bases and
some 50 other stations av
ailable that day. Every 20
minutes or so, he calls the
state police to report stuck
cars. Or the state polio, .all
"Mopstick" to update
themselves and report
problems solved.
"Mopstick" said his mis
sion is not all emergency
aid.
"People travel on credit
cards," he said. "We've
marked the brand of gas at
each exit, and the major
truck stops where you can
get your food fast and
where we know they treat
people right."
