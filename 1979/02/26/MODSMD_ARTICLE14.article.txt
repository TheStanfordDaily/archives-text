## Carter suffers memory lapses 
### 
In my recent satire portray
ing the cloddish buffoonery of
the Carter clan, some individu
als were rather uncomfortable
with my conclusion that Presi
dent jimmy Carter is a "liar"
(Daily, Feb. 1). Indeed, one of
my critics in a letter (Daily, Feb.
13) insisted that the president
has a good track record at keep
ing his promises. Of course,
nothing could be further from
the truth.
Nevertheless, I confess that I
was wrong. It is improper and
impolite to classify our presi
dentas a liar. Itwould be better
to say that the president has a
poor memory. What Carter
needs is a mnemonics expert;
otherwise, we could count on
him to keep his campaign
promises.
When Carter ran for presi
dent, he declared that the tax
system was a "disgrace to the
human race," On Sept. 20,

1976 he added: "I would never
increase the taxes for the work
ing people of our country and
the lower and middle income
groups . . . and you can de
pend upon that if I am
elected."
However, as the San Fran
cisco Chronicle wrote: "Car
ter's first tax move was to sup
port the largest single tax in
crease in our history — in So
cial Security taxes. Nearly all
will pay more taxes under Car
ter's plans."
Moreover, Carter promised
a balanced budget by 1980 — a
cruel hoax since administra
tion officials admit that it is im
possible.
On the Panama Canal, Carter
stated before the election that
"I would not relinquish actual
political control." After forget
ting this promise, he then told
the American people that the
complete turnover of control
would not cost the American
taxpayer a penny.
Last week, testimony before
outraged congressmen re
vealed that the transition
would cost upwards of $350
million, a figure which does
not even include the massive
financial aid package that Car
ter has promised Panama.
During the election, Carter
received over 90 percent of the

Creek vote because he prom
ised to retain the arms em
bargo on Turkey. Safely
elected, Carter then executed
a jiu jitsu turnaround as he
lifted the embargo.
On July 28, 1976, Carter re
marked that he would "limit
wage increases for federal
employees to a reasonable fi
gure so as to encourage the
private sector to restrain wage
and price demands."
According to the Chronicle,
"Top (Carter) White House
aides were given pay raises av
eraging almost 25 percent
higher than those received by
members of the Ford White
House."
During a celebrated
"fireside chat" on Feb. 2,1977,
Carter promised to "put a ceil
ing on the number of people
employed by federal govern
ment agencies so we can bring
the growth of government
under control."
At the end of 1978, the
number of federal employees
had increased by 18,476, 20
percent of that figure coming
from the executive depart
ment.
Finally, Carter has switched
his position on the deregula
tion of natural gas three times
since his election, according to
Robert J. Wagman of the North

American Newspaper Alliance.
In a letter to the governors of
Texas, Louisiana and Ok
lahoma on Oct. 16,1976, Carter
wrote: "I will work with the
Congress, as the Ford ad
ministration has been unable
to do, to deregulate new
natural gas." When the energy
package was sent to Capitol
Hill, Carter flip-flopped again,
stating: "Proposals for decon
trol of natural gas prices would
be disastrous for our
economy."
The list goes on and on.
When a reporter specifically
asked Carter about his
chameleon-like behavior, the
president responded: "Those
attacks don't hurt me. They
hurt America."
Right on!
On Feb. 10, 1976, candidate
Carter solemnly swore: "I
don't intend to break a single
promise. I'm giving you my
word of honor." On a previous
occasion, he Remarked: "I will
never make a misleading
statement ... If you ever see
me doing any of these things,
don't support me. I would not
be worthy to be president of
this country."
I agree.
