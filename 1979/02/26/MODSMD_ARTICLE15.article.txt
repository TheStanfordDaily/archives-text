An article in your paper con
cerning Psychology Prof. Karl
Pribram (Daily, Jan. 15) seems
to favor the allegation that he
has a "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
personality," and "no one
should have to interact with
him."
I would hate to think of the
loss to psychology in particular
and to science in general if we
had not interacted with him in
the past. Check the record re
garding his contributions and
make some judgment in your
paper regarding whether
further interaction with him is
not only warranted, but badly
needed! I am sure your readers
would be interested in that.
Regarding the statement of
his having a "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde personality," that is not
only sensationalistic jour
nalism, but a very trite diag
nosis. I know hfs personality
and am aware he is a man of
intensity — as are most gifted
people. Anyone can be pro
voked to anger given the right
circumstances. That hardly jus
tifies an attempt at character
assassination.
I think in fairness to Pribram
and your readers you should
consider the totality of this
man — not one unpleasant in
cident.

Editor's note: The "Jekyll and
Hyde" quote in the story was
correctly attributed to Barbara
Honegger, the victim of Prib
ram's 1975 assault. I consider
the quote legitimate. It is an
accurate statement of the vic
tim's feeling about Pribram.
The Daily does not implicitly or
explicitly judge Pribram by the
quote's inclusion in the story.
Personally, genius or not, I
do not think anyone should
condone the assault of a staff
member by a faculty member
here, or anywhere else for that
matter. If reporting accurately
that a noted professor lost con
trol of himself is "sensationalis
tic, " then I suppose we are
guilty of the charge.
