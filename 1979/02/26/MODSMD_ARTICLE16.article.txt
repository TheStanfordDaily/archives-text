# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Viewpoint Student effort necessary 
### 
There is aery which is resurrected periodically
around here every time campus politicos get the
urge to complain about something. They shout
that students have no opportunity for input in
decision-making processes within the Univer
sity.
If some of the recent experiences I've had are
any indication, the cry should be that students
ignore their opportunities to participate in the
decision-making processes here.
Now I know, it's old arm-of-the
administration Charlson talking, but give me a
chance.
About nine weeks ago, I got a call from Nor
man Robinson, associate dean for residential
education. He told me the University was form
ing a committee to draw up plans for a new
student residence to be built soon. No small
task since the facility will house 800 students,
more than 13 percent of the undergraduate stu
dent population here and more than any dorm
presently in the housing system. The goal, he
said, was to present a proposal to the Board of
Trustees for the dorm by April or May.
Robinson asked me if I would serve on the
committee, and he said I was asked because,
like all the other students, faculty and administ
ration people asked, I theoretically had a special
perspective — presumably from the Daily —
which might prove useful to the committee.
Robinson told me that the committee would
meet from noon to 1:30 p.m. every Thursday for
the remainder of the year. Moreover, he said the
committee would continue work through the
final plan drawing, so it was hoped I could re
main on the committee next year as well. He
asked me to commit myself to attending as close
to 100 percent of the meetings as humanly pos
sible.
Presumably, all others asked to work on the
committee agreed to this as I did.
After seeing a roster of committee members,
it was clear Robinson had done a fine job of
assembling a group which would present many
different perspectives.
The 10 student members include ASSU
Senators, members of the Committee on Ser
vices to Students and its subcommittee on resi
dences and several housing associates (RAs)
from across the campus.
Faculty include resident fellows and members
of the University Lands and Buildings Commit
tee. Staff members were drawn from the Dean
of Student Affairs' Office, Residential Education
Office and the Planning Office. Starting out it
certainly looked as though nearly every possible
constituency was represented in a committee of
22.
But it didn't quite work out that way. No, there
is not a problem with the system. The system is
great, and it really could work. Everyone at the
meetings has an equal chance to offer input, and
student opinions are given a great deal of
weight.
Only one problem: students need to be pre
sent forstudents to give input. I have sat at those

meetings and marveled at how nearly every fa
culty and staff person is present, yet students
are consistently absent. Last Thursday, I reached
the end of my rope. Of the six absentees, five
were students. And the five absent were among
the worst attendance offenders.
Moreover students have been the worst about
completing the miniscule amount of written
material requested to help summarize commit
tee work.
I don't know about other students, but when I
see the negligence of these student members, I
get angry. Our voice was cut in half last Thursday
by absenteeism. As a result, a meeting intended
to settle the optimal size of a residence for stu
dent interaction became a meeting to decide
how many students resident fellowscan handle.
The problem is that Thursday was no excep
tional ca§e. Through the first eight meetings
there were 37 absences of the 176 expected in
attendance. An amazing 25 of the absences were
students. Students were absent more than twice
as often as the 12 faculty and administration
members.
One student has missed six of eight meetings.
Even more shocking, that student is one of the
people placed on the committee solely because
he was an ASSU Senate member. Robinson felt
that senate input in the process was important,
yet a full one-third of student absentees have
been the two senate "representatives." Mean
while our senate, that bastion of representative
government, that model of democracy, that
guardian of international human rights, is send
ing itself to Colorado to investigate Coors labor
practices, an investigation carried on for two
years by the National Labor Relations Board
without conclusion.
But after all, why should elected representa
tives spend their time on an issue which will
directly affect a huge percentage of the students
here?
No, I'm not perfect. I missed a meeting.
Nearly everyone has. And emergencies occur. I
don't think Robinson expected 100 percent at
tendance. (If he did, he must be upset that only
three people still have achieved it.) But to attend
over 85 percent is not unreasonable. Some
would call that extraordinary. I would not. Were
I Robinson, I would demand that from everyone
on the committee.
So, the next time you hear about a lack of
student input, don't be duped by campus politi
cians. Their line is a bunch of bull.
No, I cannot speak first-hand about other
committees, but it would not surprise me if a
similiar trend could be seen elsewhere. It is time
students demand action from their committee
representatives. If students simply got the rep
resentation we are offered within the committee
system, we would have all the input we could
ever want. And things students want would get
done.
