## Decline of U.S. power in Third World not surprising 
### 
Just when everyone tuought
President Jimmy Carter knew
what he was doing, he had to
go and lose Iran. There it was
in his pocket one day; the next
day it had slipped out.
Third World countries must
be remarkably slippery, or can
it be that presidential pockets
are full of holes? The übiquit
ous Henry Kissinger notes that
Iran marks the fourth such loss
in two years, following
Ethiopia, South Yemen and Af
ghanistan.
But the worst of it is that all
these loose marbles are said to
be finding their way into the

pockets of the Soviet Union.
To again paraphrase Kissinger:
Leonid four, Jimmy zip.
Surprised and alarmed,
many conclude that something
must be done to reverse this
recent tendency. So they look
back to that Golden Age of
American foreign policy, the
immediate post World War II
period.
Little wonder their solutions
sound familiar. For instance,
Kissinger proposes building
many more nuclear arms to
threaten the Soviets, and
mobilizing U.S. political and
military support for its remain

ing Third World friends.
To pre-empt the re
emergence of rival economic
blocs after World War 11. the
United States compelled its
debilitated former allies to de
colonize, giving birth to more
than 100 new countries, most
of the present Third World.
The United States sought
these nations' participation in a
new order, an international
system of trade and investment
in which, not coincidentally,
the United States was both the
preponderant power and the
largest beneficiary.
But the Pax Americana also

targeted the self-interest of the
Third World — and therein lay
its success. Unlike other impe
rial systems, adherence de
pended on more than coer
cion.
Ambition was appealed to —
and, in its economic manifesta
tion, given free rein — in the
emerging worfcl market.
To nations long-accustomed
to kowtowing to the ukases of
imperial overlords, the greater
discretion allowed them under
the new system's reliance
upon market sanctions sig
nified a sizable step forward.
The simple, hardheaded and
yet refreshing notion on which
the entire system came to rest
was a classically liberal idea:
that nations, like individuals,
should be left free to deter
mine their own destinies — as
long as they can pay their own
way.
The Soviets' traditional,
bully-stick imperialism did not
stand a chance against the
Americans' proferred
economic carrot — which was
anyway larger and more attrac
tive than any the Soviets could
bring to market.
Only when the United States
caused a break, excluding cert
tain countries whose leaders'
plans diverged from official
U.S. views, were nations such
as China, Cuba and Vietnam
driven into the Soviet bear
hug. Shortly after their acces
sion to power, Chou En Lai,
Fidel Castro and Ho Chi Minh
all appealed for U.S. economic
and political links in eventually
frustrated attempts to avoid fal
ling into Soviet subjugation.
Much has changed since the
last world war. But contrary to
"advanced" country pre
judices, probably the most
world-historical transforma
tion did not occur in their
countries at all. Furthermore, it
had nothing to do with the
strategic rivalry between the
United States and the Soviet
Union.
It happened in the Third
World, where for the first time

ever, nations covering the en
tire surface of the earth tasted
political independence — and
acquired insatiable appetites
for full self-determination.
So indeed there is a ten
dency for U.S. power to de
cline in the Third World, a
trend implicit in the liberal
premise underlying the U.S.-
sponsored international
economic system. But it is not
recent — and it should not be
surprising.
In so far as the Third World
redeems past promises of in
creased self-determination,
old-style techniques of politi
cal manipulation and military
coercion become ever more
counterproductive.
Attempts by the superpow

ers to expand their own nuc
lear arsenals and to extend
their strategic jockeying in the
Third World itself merely con
firm suspicions that they re
gard self-determination as
merely a slogan.
If Carter seeks U.S.-Third
World bonds of allegiance, he
will find they are still available
on the old terms: economic
cooperation and develop
ment. The best indications of
what to expect from Iran even
tually are recent pleas by the
Chinese, Cubans and Viet
namese for U.S. trade and in
vestment.

ever, nations covering the en
tire surface of the earth tasted
political independence — and
acquired insatiable appetites
for full self-determination.
So indeed there is a ten
dency for U.S. power to de
cline in the Third World, a
trend implicit in the liberal
premise underlying the U.S.-
sponsored international
economic system. But it is not
recent — and it should not be
surprising.
In so far as the Third World
redeems past promises of in
creased self-determination,
old-style techniques of politi
cal manipulation and military
coercion become ever more
counterproductive.
Attempts by the superpow

ers to expand their own nuc
lear arsenals and to extend
their strategic jockeying in the
Third World itself merely con
firm suspicions that they re
gard self-determination as
merely a slogan.
If Carter seeks U.S.-Third
World bonds of allegiance, he
will find they are still available
on the old terms: economic
cooperation and develop
ment. The best indications of
what to expect from Iran even
tually are recent pleas by the
Chinese, Cubans and Viet
namese for U.S. trade and in
vestment.

Just when everyone tuought
President Jimmy Carter knew
what he was doing, he had to
go and lose Iran. There it was
in his pocket one day; the next
day it had slipped out.
Third World countries must
be remarkably slippery, or can
it be that presidential pockets
are full of holes? The übiquit
ous Henry Kissinger notes that
Iran marks the fourth such loss
in two years, following
Ethiopia, South Yemen and Af
ghanistan.
But the worst of it is that all
these loose marbles are said to
be finding their way into the

pockets of the Soviet Union.
To again paraphrase Kissinger:
Leonid four, Jimmy zip.
Surprised and alarmed,
many conclude that something
must be done to reverse this
recent tendency. So they look
back to that Golden Age of
American foreign policy, the
immediate post World War II
period.
Little wonder their solutions
sound familiar. For instance,
Kissinger proposes building
many more nuclear arms to
threaten the Soviets, and
mobilizing U.S. political and
military support for its remain

ing Third World friends.
To pre-empt the re
emergence of rival economic
blocs after World War 11. the
United States compelled its
debilitated former allies to de
colonize, giving birth to more
than 100 new countries, most
of the present Third World.
The United States sought
these nations' participation in a
new order, an international
system of trade and investment
in which, not coincidentally,
the United States was both the
preponderant power and the
largest beneficiary.
But the Pax Americana also

targeted the self-interest of the
Third World — and therein lay
its success. Unlike other impe
rial systems, adherence de
pended on more than coer
cion.
Ambition was appealed to —
and, in its economic manifesta
tion, given free rein — in the
emerging worfcl market.
To nations long-accustomed
to kowtowing to the ukases of
imperial overlords, the greater
discretion allowed them under
the new system's reliance
upon market sanctions sig
nified a sizable step forward.
The simple, hardheaded and
yet refreshing notion on which
the entire system came to rest
was a classically liberal idea:
that nations, like individuals,
should be left free to deter
mine their own destinies — as
long as they can pay their own
way.
The Soviets' traditional,
bully-stick imperialism did not
stand a chance against the
Americans' proferred
economic carrot — which was
anyway larger and more attrac
tive than any the Soviets could
bring to market.
Only when the United States
caused a break, excluding cert
tain countries whose leaders'
plans diverged from official
U.S. views, were nations such
as China, Cuba and Vietnam
driven into the Soviet bear
hug. Shortly after their acces
sion to power, Chou En Lai,
Fidel Castro and Ho Chi Minh
all appealed for U.S. economic
and political links in eventually
frustrated attempts to avoid fal
ling into Soviet subjugation.
Much has changed since the
last world war. But contrary to
"advanced" country pre
judices, probably the most
world-historical transforma
tion did not occur in their
countries at all. Furthermore, it
had nothing to do with the
strategic rivalry between the
United States and the Soviet
Union.
It happened in the Third
World, where for the first time

ever, nations covering the en
tire surface of the earth tasted
