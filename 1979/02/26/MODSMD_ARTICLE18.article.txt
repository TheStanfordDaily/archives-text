## Students should decide 
### 
After hearing both the representatives of
the AFL-CIO National Coors Boycott Com
mittee and the representatives and lawyers
for the Adolph Coors Company, and review
ing the myriad of literature presented by both
sides, it appears to me the Coors boycott
issue really boils down to little more than a
common labor-management dispute.
At one ASSU Senate meeting (Feb. 1,1979)
David Sickler, the National AFL-CIO Coors
Boycott Coordinator, stated that the Coors
company is currently carrying out blatant ra
cially discriminatory practices and grossly
immoral violations of human rights. Boycott
representatives cite the lie detector test used
by Coors as an example of one such violation.
At another senate meeting (jan. 4,1979) the
attorney for the Adolph Coors Company,
Robert Carrol, stated that Coors is no longer
carrying out any unfair labor practices. Coors
representatives cite their present minority
hiring programs and expanded employee
benefits as tangible evidence of their im
provement.
As for the lie detector test, Coors claims
that at present it amounts to little more than
seven relatively harmless questions.
The issue almost becomes one of whose
propaganda one is willing to believe! The
senate is spending an unjustifiable and inor
dinate amount of time on this issue.
First, it is not the place or the duty of the
senate to involve itself as a judge or inves
tigator of any such local or national labor
management dispute. Rather, the senate's

main purpose is to deal with campus issues. It
is ludicrous to think that some members of
the senate can even look upon themselves as
capable of judging such an issue. Surely it is a
matter for the National Labor Relations Board
and the courts to decide.
Those who encourage the senate's in
volvement in this issue claim that since beer
is a greatly consumed commodity on campus
and that since Coors sponsors many ASSU
Special Events, the boycott issue thus be
comes a campus issue that requires some
senate mandate.
I strongly disagree with this view because I
feel that the boycott decision should be a
personal matter left up to each student.
As for whether or not Coors should be
allowed to have business dealings with ASSU
Special Projects, again I feel that the decision
should be left up to the discretion of the
student directors and assistants involved.
Brian Becker, the director of ASSU Special
Events, has informed me that, after examin
ing both sides of the issue, he sees no strong
evidence to convince him that Special Events
should change its business dealings with the
Coors company.
The senate should abide by this decision
just as it should respect the individual deci
sion of each student on this matter.
The senate should return to important
campus issues which deserve more time and
consideration at senate meetings.
