# Camp David talks called; Carter asks for new effort
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter, determined to "spare
no effort" for peace in the Middle
East, called yesterday for a new Camp
David summit conference to try to
conclude a treaty between Israel and
Egypt-
The talks would be held, possibly
beginning later in the week, with
Prime Minister Menachem Begin re
pesenting Israel but without the par
ticipation of Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat.
Egypt would be represented by
Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil, who
Carter said had been authorized by
Sadat to conclude the negotiations.
There was no official explanation
given for Sadat's absence.
In Israel, several senior Isareli offi
cials said they were surprised Sadat
would not represent Egypt at the
proposed talks.
One Israeli government source
said it was unlikely Begin would at
tend unless Sadat did so, adding:
"Carter knows it is only Sadat and
Begin who can make the decisions. If
Begin goes without Sadat, it will
seem like Israel is being asked to
make all the concessions."
Other Israeli officials would not try
to predict how Begin might respond
officially to Carter's invitation.
Carter made the announcement at
the windup of four days of treaty
negotiations between Khalil and Is
raeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan.
Seeing them off on the south lawn

of the White House, Carter said he
was prepared "to spare no effort in
achieving the peace settlement"
foreseen in his summit meeting last
September with Begin and Sadat.
He said he was certain Israel and
Egypt shared his determination.
By inviting Begin to Camp David,
the president seemed to leave the
impression that he was looking to Is
rael to agree to terms set by Sadat for
linking the treaty to the future of the
Israeli-held West Bank of the Jordan
River and Gaza.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance is
known to have presented new U.S.
proposals on the Palestinian issue
during his discussions with Dayan
and Khalil.
If all the obstacles to a treaty are
removed at a new summit meeting
hosted by Carter, Sadat could fly
here to join in a successful windup.
Jody Powell, the White House
press secretary, said that "sometime,
midweek or so, we ought to know"
whether the new round of negotia
tions will be held.
Sadat is the unquestioned
decision-maker in Egypt. There is no
doubt that Khalil would seek his ap
proval before taking any major steps
at the talks.
Begin, meanwhile, would be able
to speak for the Israeli government.
However, his decision would require

the ultimate approval of the Cabinet
and the Israeli parliament. Dayan was
flying to Jerusalem where a special
meeting of the Cabinet was
scheduled for tomorrow.
In Cairo, meanwhile, the Middle
East news agency reported that Khalil
would fly directly home instead of
stopping in London, as initially
planned.
