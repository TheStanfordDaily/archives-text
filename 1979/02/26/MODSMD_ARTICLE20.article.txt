# Cards lose it on the line, 80-77
## SPORTS 
### Chris Haft 
Stanford's 80-77 basketball
loss to Oregon at Maples Pavil
ion Saturday night was "foul"
in every way.
Fouls, not jump shots or re
bounds, dominated the action
as the blowhard trio of officials
called 64 infractions on the two
teams, 37 of them in the first
half.
Yet the Ducks attempted a
huge total of 48 free throws —
hitting 36 of them — while
Stanford converted on just 19
of 31 charity shots. More sig
nificantly, Oregon shot 22
times from the line to Stan
ford's paltry seven in the deci
sive second half.
The 17-point difference re
sulting from the free throws
thus made the outcome foul
for the Cardinals, who drop to

5-10 in Pacific-10 Conference
play and 11-13 overall.
As he did after the 63-62 loss
to Arizona Feb. 3, Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso did not
allow himself to vent his wrath
on the striped-shirted crew.
"League rules to not permit
me to comment on the foul
situation/' Dißiaso said. "I do
think it's interesting to note the
discrepancy of the number of
fouls we shot in the second
half."
Freudian psychoanalysts
would have enjoyed con
templating the obvious cases
of oral fixation exhibited by
whistle-conscious referee
Frank Buckiewicz and umpires
Tom Harrington and Michael
Eggers.
The Cards, though, chose to
dwell on the officials' compe

tence. Overhearing a repor
ter's question concerning the
consistency of the officials,
Kimberly Belton stated, "They
were consistently bad."
Center Tom Schmalzried
echoed Belton's sentiments.
"The problem with the refs was
that they lost control of the
game," Schmalzried said. "A
good amount of the fouls they
called were fouls, but the calls
they were making were incon
sistent."
"The thing that bothers most
of the guys on the team is that
they (the Ducks) get away with
falling down in front of some
body," commented guard
Daryle Morgan.
The only falling the Cards did
occurred when they fell out of
the lead in the waning minutes.
Trailing 73-71, Oregon re
ceived a big break when Belton
fouled out with 5:40 to go on
an inexplicable tripping call.
Barry Walker's two free
throws tied the game, and with
Belton gone, Oregon switched
from a man-to-man to a 1-3-1
zone trap defense.
"We wanted them (the
Cards) to stand around a little
bit," Duck coach Jim Haney
said, explaining his strategy.
"By keeping them spread out

and standing still we tried to
take away their momentum."
Indeed, Stanford slowed
down its offense, going into a
spread-court alignment and
passing the ball around for
over a minute and a half before
Brian Welch missed a jumper
from the corner.
After Dan Hartshorne's free
throw with 2:22 to go put Ore
gon on top, 74-73, Schmalzried
brilliantly tipped in Welch's
missed jumper to give the
Cards a one-point margin.
Hartshorne regained the
lead for the Ducks on their en
suing possession with two
more free throws.
Oregon again had the ball
after Welch missed an 18-
footer, and with 56 seconds left
Morgan fouled Rob Closs, the
Pac-10's leading free-throw
shooter.
Closs made his pair of charity
tosses to give Oregon a 78-75
bulge.
Schmalzried, trying to draw a
foul, drove down the middle
and missed a lean-in, but with
26 seconds left Wolfe Perry
corkscrewed over and around
three Ducks for a 12-foot bank
shot bringing Stanford within
one.
Doug Marty then fouled

Hartshorne, a 61-percent free
throw shooter. The 6-foot-10
junior missed the first of a
one-and-one, but the rebound
caromed back to Hartshorne,
whom Welch fouled with 13
seconds to go.
Given this reprieve,
Hartshorne canned two
freebees for the game's final
points.
Earlier, it appeared that Stan
ford might be able to crawl its
way through the thicket of
fouls, erasing a 38-34 halftime
deficit to take a six-point lead
midway in the second half.
Welch's short turn-around
banker, Schmalzried's goal
tended lay-in and Perry's
straightaway jumper signaled
an increase in Stanford's offen
sive tempo and tied the score
at 40-40, the first of nine
second-half ties.
The count was still knotted at
54 when Jeff Ryan sank a 14-
foot baseliner and Perry soared
for two jumpers, pushing the
Ca rds a head 60-54 wi t h 10:46 to
go-
By the six minute mark,
however, Oregon had pulled
even to set up the excruciating
finish.
Even in defeat, the Cards had
their share of heroes. Perry,
jumping above the intrusive
Oregon defenders, made eight
of 12 shots from the floor in the
second half on his way to a
game-high 30 points.
Schmalzried came off the
bench to lead Stanford's de
termined rebounding effort.
The 6-11 junior was the biggest
player on the floor, and he per
formed accordingly with 14
points and 10 rebounds.
Before suffering his unfor
tunate late-game cold streak,
Welch helped generate Stan
ford's second-half surge by
scoring all 10 of his points after
intermission.
Similar — and even greater
— feats will be required of the
Cards tonight as they face the
formidable Oregon State
Beavers in Maples at 8 p.m.

A DUCK SANDWICH is made here as Stanford's Steve Crandell (43)
and Wolfe Perry (21) surround Oregon's Mike Clark during the
Cardinals' 80-77 loss Saturday night. Bruising play such as this was
the rule rather than the exception as the Cards and Oregon bumped
their way to 64 personal fouls.
