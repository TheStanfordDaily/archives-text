The outcome marks the 20th straight home win for San Jose
State. Its last home loss was in 1974 against Washington.
"We had a heck of a good meet," said Card coach Payton
Jordan. "To hold this team, San Jose State, to 94 was a heck of a
good performance and beating Hayward with 110 was outstand
ing."
Darrin Nelson won the 110-meter dash in 10.7 seconds, run
ning into a six m.p.h. wind. He was equally impressive in the
200-meter race, winning the event in 21.6 seconds.

"We were really pleased," Jordan said. "Some of the guys who
didn't win were instrumental in upping our point total."
Jordan cited Ken Margerum, Rick Buss and Gary Bruner as
outstanding supportive tracksters.
"Our freshmen did an exceptionally good job," he said. "It
looks like my early prediction that we have the most improved
team wasn't just a joke. We had a see-saw battle with San Jose
State all the way."
The Cards face Fresno State next Saturday at Stanford Stadium
at 1:15. Jordan said, "We have a real battle coming up against
Fresno State."
