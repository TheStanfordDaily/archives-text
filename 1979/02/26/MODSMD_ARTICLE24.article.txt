# Splashers struggle to defend own title

The tide of women's swimming ran high over the weekend at
deGuerre Pool. While the men were resting in preparation for
next week's Pac-10 Championships in Los Angeles, the Stanford
women hosted the Stanford Invitational, a meet that Coach Jim
Gaughran had earlier described as "the best women's meet on
the West Coast this year."
After easily squashing all competition at the Nor-Cal Champ
ionships last weekend, the women had focused upon Friday,
Saturday and yesterday's action as the high point of their season
before the AIAW National Championships to be held in
Pittsburgh Mar. 15-17.
With teams such as USC and UCLA, respectively fourth and
sixth in the nation last year, Stanford struggled to defend its own
invitational title.
Friday and Saturday belonged almost exclusively to freshman
Linda Jezek, former Olympian and the Cards' current wonder
child. She outfloated her devastated challengers in every event in
which she participated, as she overwhelmingly cleaned up in five
races.
Jezek created a new AIAW record with a half-length victory in
the 200 yard backstroke in 1:59.03. She cruised to a 57.02 win in
the 100 back over her determined and rapidly improving team
mate, Zena Herrmann, who swam one of her lifetime bests of
1:00.14.
As well as her predictable backstrope sweep, Jezek also com
manded untenable leads in the individual medley. She chalked
up a four-second margin of victory in the 200 IM (2:05.46) and
won the rigorous 400 IM by over eight seconds in 4:24.03. She
triumphed narrowly in the 100 butterfly with a time of 56.43
seconds to demonstrate her extreme versatility.
Jo Clarke swam her best time, 4:51.15, to pick up another Card
win in the 500 freestyle. Noel Moran sprinted to a first-place finish
in the 50 breaststroke in a 30.88.
Returning to the water after a brief bout with illness, dependa
ble Libby Beaudet turned in outstanding performances in Jezek's
shadow by capturing third-place honors in the 100 fly (58.13), the
200 IM (2:09.03), the 400 IM (4:32.%) and the 200 fly (2:07.55).
Valerie Lee placed second in the 200 fly (2:05.57) and third in
the 500 free (4:56.15) to continue her string of credible seasons
for the Cards.
