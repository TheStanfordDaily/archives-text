# Ruggers concede 'no contest' loss
## 
### John Sargent 
The people who came to
Maloney Field Saturday saw a
great game, that is if they
watched baseball from the top
of the bleachers.
Those who did face forward
to watch rugby were treated to
quite a display by the UCLA
Bruins. Stanford put up less
than a valiant struggle as UCLA
rolled over the Cards 33-9. The
Bruins were mote physical,
more experienced, much fas
ter, and a lot bigger. In short â€”
no contest.
The first half, though gener
ally dominated by UCLA, was
close in score. The Bruins
scored twice early in the game,
but failed on both conversion
attempts. /
Stanford came back with
Rich Roux scoring in the corner
and "Young" Jamie Turner ad
ding the conversion. Had Stan
ford held the Bruins at 8-6 till
the half, the game might have
been close, but with less than a
minute left, UCLA scored
again.

This, coupled with a Bruin
score in the first minute of the
second half, destroyed all
hope of a Stanford victory.
From here the Cards
weakened continually as UCLA
commenced to run over and
around all opposition.
The second team, on the
other hand, played a tough,
defensive game.
UCLA threatened to score
constantly, but Stanford held
them to two tries and a conver
sion.
Midway through the second
half, the Cards snapped back.
Mark Agnus scored on a strong
run and Jim Perris added the
kick. Play continued in the
UCLA end until the final whis
tle. Stanford could not score as
time ran out.
The second team played by
far the most exciting game of
the day, as the third team got
swamped by Livermore.
The ruggers take on Santa
Clara away next weekend in
preparation for the Big Game
against UC-Berkeley.
