### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's men gymnasts
completed a successful regular
season by recording a win over
host Chico State Friday night,
204.55 to 194.55. The Cardinal
total was second only to the
205.60 mark compiled at the
Berkeley meet two weeks ago.
Even without the all-around
services of Mike Lee and John
Marra due to injuries, Stanford
was able to raise its record to
8-4, a complete reversal of last
year's final standing.
Tad Bostick took all-around
honors with a 52.25 effort, a
total helped by his 8.85, first
place finish in parallel bars. He
missed his career-high all
around score, set last Friday at
Fullerton, by only .20. Bostick
also tied for second with
teammate Bob Maganini in
high bar with 8.95 and tied with
Lee for second on pommel
horse with 8.5.
Bob Daniel placed fifth on
high bar with 8.25 and earned
second in valting with a 9.25
score. Brian Nelson placed
third on high bar with an 8.9
mark, bringing the team total
to 35.05 in that event, highest
of the season.

Chris Takimoto capped a
strong season performance
with a 9.75 score on his spe
cialty, pommel horse, the
highest mark for him this year
and second highest of his
career.
Coach Sadao Hamada
explained that he was very
pleased with the performance
considering that the team has
been concentrating on com
pulsory routines for the up
coming post-season competi

tion rather than on optional
routines for the regular season
meets during the past week.
The Cards get a one-week
break before entering the
Pacific Southwest Gymnastic
Championships at Berkeley.
This meet is a two-day affair,
which should serve as a pre
liminary for the Pacific-10
Championships and NCAA
Western Regionals held March
23 and 24 at Los Angeles.
