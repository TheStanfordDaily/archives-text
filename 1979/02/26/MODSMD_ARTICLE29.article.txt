# Netters tangle Pacific, 9-0
## 
### Sue Sheldon 
Perhaps after the University of Pacific
lost its six singles matches against the Stan
ford Women's tennis team, its members
considered saving face by winning at least
one doubles match.
Stanford, however, had other plans. The
Cardinals proceeded to close out the con
test by winning all three doubles matches
with a loss of only five games. UOP re
turned to Stockton last Friday severely
beaten by a score of 9-0.
Playing first singles was Susie Hagey,
who soundly defeated Debbie Duhamel
6-1, 6-3.

In what she called "one of the easier
overall teams we've played this season,"
Caryn Hertel added a second singles win
by overpowering Becky Ford 6-2, 6-2.
"The match wasn't really challenging
because I was the one giving and taking all
the points," Hertel said. "I should have
been more consistent."
Freshman Lisa Cordon encountered
some difficulty, but managed to rack up
another win for Stanford with her triumph
over Nancy Nies 6-3, 6-2.
The next convincing wins came further
down the singles lineup as Marianne In
gard crushed Suzanne Horenstein 6-0, 6-1

and Pat Varga overwhelmed Lori
Braithwaite 6-0, 6-2.
It was in the doubles, though, that Stan
ford really had its field day, with the Cards
trying out some new combinations.
Alycia Moulton and Kathy Jordan, two of
Stanford's strongest singles players,
played first doubles to overcome Duhamel
and Sparcher 6-0, 6-3.
