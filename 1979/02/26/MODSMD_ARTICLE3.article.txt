# Elsen libel charges in pleadings battle
## 
### Robin Millington 
Legal proceedings are continuing
on a $750,000 libel suit filed against
Art Prof. Albert Elsen by Menlo Park
resident George Schattle.
"To date we've had what we call a
pleadings battle," said Robert
Simpson, Elsen's attorney.
A complaint was filed last year in
Santa Clara County Superior Court
claiming that Elsen libeled Schattle
when he announced that four
sculptures Schattle was trying to sell
were fakes.
Schattle is asking for $250,000 in
compensation for profits lost be
cause of Elsen's claim, and $500,000
for punitive damages resulting from
a letter Elsen wrote to KGO-TV accus
ing Schattle of trying to "con" people
into buying fakes.
Simpson responded with a demur
rer which admits the existence of the
letter but claims that there is no
ground for libel.
"The crux of this lawsuit is not
whether or not the pieces are real, it
is whether or not Elsen's letter was
libelous," said Charles Hawkins,
Schattle's attorney.
Hawkins also said that "for ail I
know, these pieces may not be
genuine, but if you examine a piece
you have no right to write to KGO
and call the man a crook and a con
man."
He explained that Schattle went to
Elsen for an opinion on his pieces,
which were thought to be works by
the famed French sculptor Auguste
Rodin. Hawkins said Schattle
thought that since Elsen is consi
dered an authority on Rodin, Elsen
would eventually be asked to inspect
the pieces for authenticity.
Hawkins said that Schattle did not
know they might be fakes before

Elsen's pronouncement, and that he
did nothing wrong in trying to sell
them as Rodin'swhen he himself was
unaware of their status.
"It's not defrauding anyone if you
say I have a Rodin but I don't know if
it's authentic. The idea is that 'if you
want it — you have it checked.'That's
not defrauding anyone," Hawkins
said.
Hawkins also said that the former
director of the Palace of the Legion of
Honor in San Francisco, looked at
the pieces at about the same time as
Elsen and saw nothing wrong with
them.
Simpson explained that Elsen
looked at two of the four statues in
volved and believed that they were
fakes.
Elsen saw only two of the four
pieces, but Hawkins said that Elsen
"will see all of the pieces, as will
other experts" during the course of
the trial.
Simpson said "It (the case) doesn't
look promising for the plaintiff or his
attorney."
Hawkins on the other hand, said
he felt the case should hold "some
surprises" and though he felt the
case would probably be resolved
within the next couple of months, "if
it isn't" solved in a month it could
open up a whole new issue.
"What we might get into on this
case is that Stanford might be hold
ing $3 million in fakes," Hawkins
said.
He explained that in his opinion,
there is a distinction between Rodin
statues cast by a certain man and
Rodin statues cast by the original cas
ter's grandson. This second group of
Rodin works are not authentics, he
claims, and because the Stanford col
lection includes many of these
sculptures it is not worth $3 million.
