A flat Stanford women's basketball team was humbled by
league-leading San )ose State Saturday evening, 79-49.
The Cards, 6-5 in league and 18-6 overall, came into the game
hoping to snap the Spartans' winning streak at 19 games and
blemish their perfect conference record.
Circumstances looked very good fora possible Stanford upset:
State's unstoppable center, 6-foot-3 Elinor Banks — who scored
23 points in their last meeting — did not suit up for the game and
6-0 forward Winnia Cazaway was playing on an injured leg.
The loss of its main threat made San Jose play better team ball.
The Spartans ran up a 7-0 lead in the first three minutes and didn't
seem to miss Banks in the least.
The Cards made a brief surge as they tightened a 9-4 SJS lead to
15-12. For the only time in the contest their sharp passing broke
State's press with ease and found Jeanne Ruark and Louise Smith
underneath.
But the Spartans again regained control of the game and shut
down Stanford's offense. Tiny (5-1) Wanda Thompson directed
State's explosive offense with superb, crisp passes and fine ball
handling.
The Cards gave up 11 unanswered points in the last four mi
nutes of the first half and trailed 38-20.
Thoughts of another spectacular second-half comeback by the
"Cardiac Cards" were quickly dashed with the commencement
of the final 20 minutes. After giving up the first basket, State
poured in another 11 straight points.
Outscored 22-2, the Cards found themselves down 49-22 with
17 minutes to go and Coach Dotty McCrea probably wished to
change the title of the popular song to "Do You Know the Way
Out of San Jose?"
The Spartans' Karen Mason didn't seem to miss from the out
side as she led all scorers with a 33-point performance.
