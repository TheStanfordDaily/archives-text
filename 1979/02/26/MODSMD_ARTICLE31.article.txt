# Spikers pounded twice

### John Doane 
Members of the San Diego
State and UC-Santa Barbara
volleyball teams seemed un
comfortable when they en
tered Maples Pavilion for their
matches against Stanford Fri
day and Saturday, respectively.
Maples, the huge, dark
arena that it is, was apparently
not the favorite type of playing
environment for these South
ern Californians; indeed,
something was missing.
There were no palm trees,
no skimpily-clad sun goddes
ses, and no beach volleyball
courts. Perhaps even a few
piles of kelp or some beach
sand strewn across the playing
surface would have made
these visitors feel more at ease.
Whatever initial discomfort
the members of these
stereotyped "beach" school
teams felt was quickly swept
away once play began and the
Aztecs and Gauchos both went
on to defeat Stanford in
California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association matches
this past weekend.
Along with its proximity to
San Diego's beaches, San
Diego State has also been tag
ged as a notorious party
school, and the Aztecs had a bit
of a party Friday in downing the
Cards 15-7,15-13,7-15 and 15-9.
Outside hitter Randy Coc
hrane pounded over, around,
and through the Stanford
block to lead the State offense,
and the Aztec's hustle and
stubborn defense further
fueled the win.
The mere fact that Stanford
lost somewhat hid outstanding
individual performances by
several Cardinals.
"Our middle attack is defi
nitely one of our major
strengths," noted Stanford
coach Fred Sturm in pre-match
comments, and middle-hitters
Kim Lum and Rod Fletcher
proved Sturm right once again
as the two juniors combined to
put away 21 of their 26 hitting
attempts, an incredible 81 per
cent.
The two also passed well and
Sturm noted marked im
provements in Fletcher's de
fense. "Rod is getting a lot
more balls up now," he said.
As a team, Stanford killed a
sizzling 57 percent of their at
tempts, and Sturm termed set
ter Kip Engen's set selection as
"outstanding." Dave Saeta re
turned from a long bout with
the flu to provide Engen with 12
outstanding passes.
Why then, the defeat?
"I just think that we don't
know how to win yet," offered
Saeta. Sturm agreed and said,
"More than anything else, we
need a win."
Another definite factor in the
match was the play of San
Diego's reserves. San Diego
coach Rudy Suwara showed no
hesitation in yanking out his
most effective hitters and re
placing them with his crew of
more-than-adequate substi
tutes.
Especially productive was
Cochrane's replacement,
6-foot-1 John Azevedo. A be
spectacled outside hitter,
Azevedo looked like he be
longed in a second-floor UGLY
carrel, rather than on a vol

leyball court. But Azevedo
proved once again that looks
can be deceiving by powdering
the Maples Pavilion hardwood
with his hits.
But Stanford's weekend
woes were not over. UCSB rol
led into town Saturday after
noon after mashing California
in four games Friday night.
Even without injured Junior
National Team member Joerg
Lorscheider, the predominatly
blond Gauchos pressed Stan
ford into costly mistakes and
swept the Cards 15-7, 15-12,
15-12.
Right from the start, UCSB's
serving forced numerous Stan
ford passing miscues, leaving
setter Engen the difficult chore
of running a middle offense
from behind the ten-foot-line.
The passing magic of the
night before was never evident
against the Gauchos, and the
increased number of down
balls and easy digs allowed
UCSB to run its offense with
ease.
While relying mostly on out
side hitting, the Gauchos also
ran a forceful middle offense,
varying simple one-sets, cross
tandems, and a devastating

double one-set to throw off the
Card blockers.
During the double one-set
play, two attackers went up on
either side of setter Tony
Baumgartner, making it virtu
ally impossible for the
middle-blockers to cover both
hitters. Even when the bloc
kers knew who was hitting, at
tackers like Dale Rhine and
Rich Ridgeway hit off the block
for UCSB points.
An unfortunate aspect of the
match was, in all bluntness, the
officiating. Members of both
teams complained both bit
terly and frequently to the
head umpire about some
dubious rulings.
Even the mild-mannered
Sturm showed genuine disbe
lief with the umpire's antics,
and one Stanford player re
marked, "My grandmother
could have called a better
game."
The pair of losses drops Stan
ford to a 2-4 season record, 0-4
in CIVA play. The Cards will
continue their quest for a
league victory when they travel
to Southern California Wed
nesday to take on perennial
powerhouse UCLA.
