# Weaknesses show in net tourney

Stanford sent the top members of its tennis team to Berkeley
over the weekend in search of its tenth consecutive team title in
the Northern California Intercollegiate Tennis Champsionships.
What they came away with was a rather surprising upset at the
hands of Cal, and some frank statements by tennis coach Dick
Gould.
"Our team is young and inexperienced," he said. "We're no
where near the strength of last year's team at this time of the year,
and I think that was evident in our performance. Hopefully, this
will serve as needed experience, and help us prepare for the
latter part of the season."
Competing against other colleges in the area, Stanford's team
combined for a total of 17 team points, placing second behind
Cal's total of 21. Other participants in the tournament included
San Jose State and the University of San Francisco, both schools
tallying three points apiece.
All teams competed in both singles and doubles. In the pre
tournament seedings, Stanford held the two top positions with
senior Matt Mitchell garnering the spot in the singles, and with
Mitchell and teammate Peter Rennert leading the way in the
doubles. Neither of the top seeds came through for the Cardi
nals.
Mitchell cruised through his early matches, defeating team
mate |im Hodges to advance to the finals. There, however, he was
forced to default with shoulder and stomach problems to Cal's
unseeded Larry Stefanki.
Other Cardinal singles players included Peter Rennert, a 6-2, 6-3
quarterfinal victim of Stefanki; Lloyd Bourne, defeated 7-6, 6-3 in
the second round by Chris Lancaster of Cal; Tim Mayotte, who
lost to Chris Dunk, another Cal player 7-6, 7-6; and Scott Bondur
ant, defeated in the first round by Rodney Lee of USF, 4-6,7-5,7-5.
Overall, Stanford players fared poorly in the singles, with the
exception of Hodges, who played "excellently" according to
Gould.
In the doubles, the exceptional play of freshmen Tim Mayotte
and Scott Bondurant proved to be one of the few shining points
of the Stanford performance. Unseeded in the tournament,
Mayotte and Bondurant advanced to the finals where they de
feated the second-seeded Cal team of Marty Davis and Chris
Dunk, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
Also playing well in doubles was the Stanford team of Bourne
and Jeff Arons, who made it to the semifinals before bowing to
Davis and Dunk, 6-3, 7-6. Surprisingly, Mitchell and Rennert,
Stanford's top-rated doubles team, lost 7-5, 7-6 in the quarterfi
nals to Yair Wertheimer and Jim Harper of Cal.
In commenting on the tournament, Gould had nothing but
praise for the Cal team.
"You really have to give Cal a lot of credit," he said. "They won
several extremely close matches that could have gone either way,
and that's the mark of an excellent team. I feel they're easily one
of the top five or six teams in the country, and they showed every
bit of it against us."
