# Cards win two
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
got a sense of what kind of
competition it's going to face
in the Southern Division of the
new Pacific-10 Conference
Saturday when it faced a strong
southern California opponent,
Pepperdine.
The Cardinals split a doub
leheader with the visiting
Waves of Pepperdine — a team
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess considered "com
parable to the competition
we'll face in league" — emerg
ing 9-8 victors in the opener
but faltering 7-2 in the
darkness-shortened nightcap.
Pepperdine, which posted
preseason victories over both
UCLA and defending national
champion USC, proved to be a
good test for a young Cardinal
team that begins its rigorous
30-game league schedule this
Thursday, Friday and Saturday
at the University of Arizona.
Even after Stanford — cur
rently ranked second in the na
tion — lost the second of its
two games with Pepperdine,
an optimistic coach Marquess
said, "I think we can beat any
one we'll face in league."
Sophomore Paul Crame
started the first game Saturday
and pitched erratically through
five and one-third innings be
fore senior teammate Rob
Irwin came on in relief.
During his stint, Crame
beaned two Pepperdine bat

ters and walked five more,
while the Waves tallied five
runs on as many hits.
Irwin gave up three consecu
tive hits without retiring a bat
ter and was immediately re
placed by Joe LoPresti. LoPresti
— who is just beginning to feel
his oats after a bicycle accident
that injured his left shoulder —
managed two and one-third
innings before Bruce Fiala
came in to snag the win.
Larry Kuhn got the nod in the
nightcap and suffered his first
loss against three wins in pre
season play. Kuhn gave up
seven hits including a solo
home run in the fourth inning
to Pepperdine third baseman
Mike Gates.
"I just wasn't getting the cur
veball across in the late in
nings," Kuhn said.
Centerfielder Mike Codiroli
and designated hitter Loring
Davies led Stanford's 12-hit at
tack in the first game Saturday.
Cordiroli went three-for-four
at the plate, and Davies col
lected two hits in his three trips
to the plate and scored twice.
Sunday the Cardinals made
up a game with the Dons of the
University of San Francisco that
was rained out Friday. Fiala
claimed his fourth win as Stan
ford ended up on top 7-5.
Tuesday, weather permit
ting, the Cards will travel to
Santa Clara for a single game
beginning at 2:30 p.m.
