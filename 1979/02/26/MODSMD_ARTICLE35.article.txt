# Trees axe Lumberjacks; women booters win, 9-0
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Normally it's the lumber
jacks who have a definite ad
vantage over trees, but at least
in women's soccer the tables
were turned. Stanford rolled
over the Humboldt State Lum
berjacks 9-0 yesterday at Roble
Field, the season opener for
the Cards.
The 9-0 margin of victory is
actually somewhat deceiving,
according to head coach Phil
Wright.
"They (Humboldt) are much
improved over last year," he
said. "They had a game yester
day and were tired. When you
get behind 2-0 you tend to let
down.
"We didn't get. up to full
speed immediately â€” it took a
while," Wright added. In fact,
it took 33 minutes for Stanford

to get on the scorecard, with a
Cindy Shorney shot on a triple
assist by Ellen Griep, Kathy Kel
ley and Ronnie Vella. Griep
added a goal five minutes later,
then assisted Shorney with a
goal a couple minutes later,
giving the Cards a 3-0 halftime
lead.
Then came the avalanche.
Shorney lead off the fireworks
by scoring her hat trick just
over a minute into the second
half. Kelley added a goal five
minutes later, followed by a
pair of scores by Griep, the
second assisted by Nancy
Geiss, for the second hat trick
of the match. Kelley added her
final goal two minutes later.
The second team members
played most of the remainder
of the game, getting valuable
experience but not posing as a

serious scoring threat.
Wright cited Maria Duryea
and Kelly Scott as the top indi
viduals for the Cards defen
sively but also noted the play of
Geiss, who was effective going
both ways.
"You can't say enough about
her," Wright said. "You can
always rely on Nancy to hustle
100 percent of the time. She
never gives up and is very in
timidating."
After getting the season off
to a good start, the going won't
be as easy when Stanford hosts
Berkeley.
Assistant coach Mike Lohrer
explained that yesterday's win
was "not surprising, yet better
than we could have expected
for the first game," but that
"next week will be much more
crucial." *
