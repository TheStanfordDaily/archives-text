Radicals hold Iran's oil industry
Abadan, Iran — Iran's oil industry, once the
world's No. 2 supplier, is in the hands of radical
workers who demand a major role in deciding who
gets their product and at what price.
Marxists are actively recruiting among them, al
though they remain a minority.
Labor leaders who organized the general strike
that halted oil exports and brought the Iranian
economy to its knees say they are willing to allow
oil to be sold to anyone except Israel and South
Africa once they receive orders from the provi
sional government of Prime Minister Mehdi
Bazargan.
Deputy Prime Minister Amir Entezam said the
new government hopes to resume selling oil ab
road in about two weeks.
But in interviews with The Associated Press,
workers made clear they expect the government
to heed their demands — among them redistribu
tion of income, an end to foreign control of the
industry and the right to reject management ap
pointees.
Although most workers claim to be devout Mos
lem followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and
disavow atheistic communism, they espouse so
cial and political views very close to Marxism.
Storm batters Southern states
A powerful storm swept into the South yester
day, blanketing parts of Missouri and Arkansas
with up to two feet of snow, stranding travelers
and knocking out electric power. High winds and
heavy seas battered the Gulf Coast, causing two
ships to collide off Texas.
Gov. Joseph Teasdale called in 250 National
Guardsmen for nine hard-hit counties of south
east Missouri, which was hit by snow, sleet and
freezing rain.
Up to 24 inches of snow fell in some parts of
Missouri, and 50 mph winds piled up drifts as high
as five feet. Many travelers were stranded and
some power outages were reported, officials said.
The area normally gets about 12 inches of snow a
year.
Heavy snows in Arkansas closed highways and
knocked out power to about 40,000 residential
customers, authorities said. State police said 16
inches of snow fell in the Mena area in the west
central portion of the state.
On the Texas coast, the battering sea and high
winds contributed to the collision of the sulfur
carrying ship Marine Duval and the tanker Mobile
Vigilant in the Neches River near Port Arthur, the
Coast Guard said. Authorities said the Marine

Duval had settled on the bottom of the shallow
channel. No injuries were reported, and neither
ship spilled any cargo.
Khomeini hunts for Bakhtiar
Tehran, Iran — Iran's Moslem leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini called yesterday for the deliv
ery to his government of former Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar from "wherever the criminal is
discovered."
The whereabouts of the 62-year-old Bakhtiar,
who was appointed by Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi in early )anuary, has not been known since
his government was deposed by Khomeini's
forces two weeks ago.
Tehran Radio quoted Khomeini as saying, "We
request our friends abroad to inform us wherever
they may find him so that we can ask the govern
ment concerned for his return."
He said Bakhtiar "committed crimes and mas
sacres and issued the order for massacres."
Khomeini did not specifically say Bakhtiar had
left Iran in the speech delivered over the radio, but
in another broadcast he was quoted as saying, "He
has fled, and on behalf of the Iranian nation we
appeal to all foreign nations to hand this criminal
over to us."
After Bakhtiar resigned Feb. 11, surrendering
power to Khomeini's provisional prime minister,
Mehdi Bazargan, rebel leaders announced he had
been arrested.
Within a few days, unconfirmed reports said he
was in the protective custody of Bazargan, a
former political ally. His immediate family has not
been seen since his ouster.
Clevelanders to vote on tax hike
Cleveland — An acrimonious campaign full of
sound and fury is coming to an end as the city's
290,000 registered voters prepare to decide this
week what price they're willing to pay to bail out
the nearly bankrupt city.
City residents will vote tomorrow whether to
boost income taxes by 50 percent — up from 1
percent to 1 1 /2 — and if they should sell their
45,000-customer Municipal Electric Light System.
Although Clevelanders have rejected income
tax increases in the past and enjoy the lowest such
levy of any of the state's six largest cities, polls
have indicated this levy will be passed.
The city has been in default since Dec. 15 on
$15.5 million worth of notes, including $14 million
held by six local banks. Although the banks held
off taking action, waiting to see what happend to
the tax increase proposal, the threat of possible

legal action hangs over the city.
Cleveland owes state pension funds $5.4 mill
ion, and the state has shown it is in no mood to
wait. Fund officials started seizing some Cleveland
tax revenues in January to satisfy their liens.
Pickets leave garbage dumps
New Orleans — Mayor Ernest Morial, citing po
tential safety hazards, asked residents and visitors
yesterday to stay out of the historic French Quarter
on Mardi Gras day — tomorrow.
The mayor made his announcement shortly
after striking police agreed to obey a court order
and pull pickets away from garbage dumps and
Sanitation Department garages.
"We just complied with the court order that the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal gave us — a rest
raining order from picketing the Sanitation De
partment," said Mitchell Ledet, a representative of
the Teamsters Union, bargaining agent for the
striking Police Association of Louisiana.
Ledet said police pickets left the dumps and
garages yesterday afternoon — about 17 hours
after the appellate court handed down the five-day
temporary restraining order.
Tanzanian forces invade Uganda
Nairobi, Kenya — Ugandan President Idi Amin
said yesterday Tanzanian invaders had captured
the garrison town of Masaka and were advancing
on the city of Mbarara in southwestern Uganda.
An Ugandan government radio newscast, moni
tored here, quoted Amin as saying the enemy was
eight miles from Mbarara. Thousands of civilians
were reported fleeing north.
Masaka, the base of Amin's mechanized
"Suicide Regiment," is 45 miles north of the Tan
zanian border and 80 miles southwest of Kampala,
the Ugandan capital. Mbarara is 25 miles north of
the frontier and 80 miles west of Masaka. Loss of
the two cities would disrupt the flow of oil and
other essential items that are trucked to Rwanda,
Burundi and eastern Zaire through Uganda from
Kenya. They ire the major cities in Uganda's
southern agricultural belt, which has a population
of more than 2 million.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy and a little cooler today. Mostly fair
tonight and tomorrow but clouds increasing again
late tomorrow. Lows in the 40s. Highs today in the
50s and tomorrow in the mid-50s to low 60s. Winds
becoming southerly to 20 mph shifting to westerly
today. Chance of showers 40 percent.
