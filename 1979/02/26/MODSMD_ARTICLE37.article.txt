# Multimedia presentation
## Black history show 
### Robert Reed 
"It is inherently necessary that
we feel the struggle of each to be
the struggle of all," said Rodney
Johnson, former Black Student
Union (BSU) co-president, who,
along with former co-president
Keith Archuleta, gave a mul
timedia presentation last Thurs
day night of recent history of
blacks here.
The program, which included
films, slides, stereo and speech,
was given in an effort to show
"why we (black-s here) are ex
periencing the joys we are or the
troubles we are," according to Ar
chuleta.
Archuleta said that black or
ganizations on campus used polit
ical activist Ron Karenga's seven
principles in organizing and de
veloping their groups.
Seven principles
Karenga's seven principles are
umoja (unity), ujamaa (family
hood), nia (purpose), kuchagalia
(self-determination), kuaamba
(creativity), ujima (collective re
sponsibility) and imani (spirit).
The presentation's films
showed how black organizations
had been involved in recent years
in a variety of political activities,
such as a Martin Luther King Jr.
commemorative rally, anti-Bakke
rallies, black Food Research Insti
tute Prof. Teteh Kofi's struggle for
tenure and numerous South Af
rica rallies.
One of the major ideological
struggles in the black community
here last year concerned South

African rallies against apartheid
and for diverstment, said Ar
chuleta. According to Archuleta, a
number of blacks felt they should
concentrate their efforts on solv
ing the problems of the black man
in America before attempting to
solve the problems of the black
man in South Africa.
Political awareness
"The major purpose of the BSU
last year was to educate," said Ar
chuleta, stressing the need for
political awareness, if not political
involvement, from blacks here.
The films presented showed
also that last year was a "Renais
sance year" for black art and cul
ture here, with the creation of the
Gospel Choir and the Ujamaa
Dancers, and the performance of
the Trial of Dedan Kimathi, which
was the first African play ever pre
sented here.
According to Johnson, "The
movement will continue â€”
through our politics, our art and
our culture."
The presentation was held on
the anniversary of the assassina
tion of Malcolm X, black Muslim
leader of the 1960s.
Scrapbooks
At the end of the presentation,
scrapbooks of clippings, photos
and analysis of recent black his
tory here, were presented to the
African and Afro-American
Studies Department, the Black
Media Institute, the Committee
on Black Performing Arts, the
Black Community Services Center
and Ujamaa, the black theme
house.
