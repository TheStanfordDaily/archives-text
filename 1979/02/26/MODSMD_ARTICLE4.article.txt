Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — Well
informed Chinese sources in Peking
predict China's invasion force in Vie
tnam will launch its biggest offensive
within several days, Japan's Kyodo
news service reported today in a dis
patch from the Chinese capital.
It quoted the sources as saying
China's "punitive action" will reach
its critical stage this week, with the
twin goals of destroying at least one
Vietnamese army division and Viet
nam's military bases near the border,
including artillery positions.
Kyodo also reported that Peking
Radio said Chinese troops had en
gaged Vietnamese army regulars in
hand-to-hand fighting near Dong
Dang, a village three miles inside Vie
tnam.
Most reports from China and Viet
nam have indicated Vietnamese
militias were doing most of the fight
ing, with the Hanoi government not
committing its regular army units.
The Peking broadcast said that
after a day of heavy fighting "a
Chinese battalion overran five hill
top positions" near Dong Dang, "de
stroyed a maze of enemy dugouts
and repulsed repeated attacks
mounted by the enemy from below,"
according to Kyodo. It said the
broadcast gave no casualty figures
and didn't say when the fighting oc
curred.
Vietnam said yesterday its
counterattacking troops killed al
most 4000 Chinese in weekend bat
tles all along the border, and a total

of 16,000 since the invasion began
Feb. 17. But China was pouring in
reinforcements, Hanoi radio said.
AtU.N. headquarters in New York,
Vietnamese and Cambodian dele
gates exchanged bitter charges
Saturday at the Security Council's
debate on the invasions of both
Cambodia and Vietnam. The council
passed no resolutions and after sev
eral hours of debate yesterday ad
journed until tomorrow.
The supporters of the ousted
China-backed Cambodian regime of
Premier Pol Pot claimed yesterday to
have "put out of action" more than
1000 Vietnamese soldiers last week
along three national highways and
near provincial capitals. It said the
Vietnamese left 670 bodies "on the
battlefields."
In Moscow, the official Soviet
press stepped up its accusations that
the United States was encouraging
China in its war against Vietnam.
But there was a report President
(immy Carter was applying new pres
sure on the Chinese to end the war.
British Prime Minister James Cal
laghan, after a telephone call from
Carter, was reported to have ordered
a slowdown of talks for the sale of
warplanes to Peking.
Six Asian nations joined Western
powers yesterday in appealing to
China and Vietnam to end their bor
der war.
They made their pleas during the
third day of debate in the U.N. Sec
urity Council on fighting in South

east Asia. The council adjourned
Sunday night and scheduled its next
session on the issue for tomorrow.
Ambassadors from Thailand, In
donesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines and Japan called for an
end to the fighting and the with
drawal of Chinese troops from
northern Vietnam and Vietnamese
forces from Cambodia.
The Voice of Vietnam radio, moni
tored here, said the Vietnamese had
destroyed 160 Chinese tanks in fight
ing Saturday and yesterday.
The war thus far has been limited
to the border areas of northern Viet
nam. Intelligence specialists in
Washington say the Chinese have
penetrated possibly up to 20 miles
into Vietnam in places but the aver
age depth is estimated at 12 miles to
15 miles.
Washington intelligence sources
have said 17 Chinese divisions, about
225,000 men, had been identified
along the border and that probably
six or seven of these divisions were in
Vietnam. This would put Chinese
combat strength in Vietnam at
around 75,000 men, higher if Viet
nam's claims of more recent Chinese
reinforcements are truo.
The Soviet Army newspaper Red

States of encouraging China to step
