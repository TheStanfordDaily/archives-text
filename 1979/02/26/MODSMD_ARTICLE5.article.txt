# Little Eleven Conference
## 28 of 30 minority members withdraw 
### Rob Lempert Senior staff writer 
Philadelphia — With mixed emotions, ttte Stan
ford delegation last night left the Little Eleven Con
ference, a convention beset by internal difficulties
which culminated in the withdrawal of 28 of its 30
minority members.
The minority delegates — black and Chicano
students — withdrew from the final assembly yes
terday at noon. They issued a statement protesting
their "token input" into the conference and the
"benign neglect" of the white delegates as rep
resentative of the prevailing attitudes in their in
stitutions. They also complained of the "implicit
assumption'' that only the minority affairs commit
tee was to be concerned with minority issues.
After an early morning caucus yesterday, the
remainder of the Stanford delegation decided not
to follow the example of minority members in
withdrawing. Instead, it issued a statement of
support for the minority students' position.
Aside from the problem with minority involve
ment, many delegates from Stanford felt frus
trated by the conference, and were unsure of their
reactions to it because of the disorganization. "It's
difficult to keep track of what we're frustrated
with," said loan Harrington, Stanford delegation
coordinator.
The central committee which organized the Lit
tle Eleven conference failed to delegate authority,
according to Stanford delegates. For example,
conference chairperson Leonard Cinsburg was
concerning himself with the photocopying of the

resolutions at the time the minority affairs commit
tee was becoming most outraged with the confer
ence proceedings.
Paperwork
Delegates complained about the way the com
mittee chairpersons were chosen and the agendas
were set. There were also problems with the
paperwork, as scheduled information and hand
outs were often hours late.
Several of the eight conference committees did
work out well, according to Harrington. She said
that the committee on academics and advising,
tuition and financial aids, social and political af
fairs and women's affairs produced useful discus
sions and formulated some conclusions.
Laura Carlsen and Shereen Arent, Stanford's de
legates to the women's affairs committee, said
they were "very pleased'' with their group's pro
ceedings. They said that the committee set up an
organization to publish a common newsletter for
the 10 schools and to take a survey of sexual
harassment on campuses.
Different expectations
However, it seemed at times that schools had
different expeca?.ons for the conference, accord
ing to members oi the Stanford delegation.
The Stanford delegation arrived with carefully
researched reports in hopes of an exchange of
ideas with students of other schools. But they
often found many of the delegations unprepared,
with short or nonexistent reports, and members
who had been chosen only days before the start of

the conference.
The Dartmouth delegation had originally de
clined to come, but the members changed their
minds at the last minute. They had virtually no time
to prepare, according to Kathy Greene, a member
of the Dartmouth group.
Some delegates from eastern schools held view
points and concerns different from this of
Stanford delegates, and these differences at times
led to reluctance to discuss issues which Stanford
students felt important.
Title IX resolution
The extracurricular affairs committee adopted a
resolution calling for compliance with Title IX
without much discussion of the problems of im
plementing it in conjunction with a large competi
tion football program. Title IX is a provision prom
ulgated by the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare requiring equal educational oppor
tunities for students regardless of sex.
The committee balked at the suggestion of Stan
ford delegate Elisa Price that the problems of re
ligious cults trying to register as campus religious
groups should be discussed. Instead, the commit
tee passed a resolution calling for all schools to
refuse funding for the internal operations of stu
dents' religious arVd political organizations.
Despite the efforts of Stanford delegate Vicki
Baker, the student life committee refused to con
sider the resolutions dealing with minority con
cerns in the area of residential education and
counseling such as theme houses.

sions and formulated some conclusions.
Laura Carlsen and Shereen Arent, Stanford's de
legates to the women's affairs committee, said
they were "very pleased'' with their group's pro
ceedings. They said that the committee set up an
organization to publish a common newsletter for
the 10 schools and to take a survey of sexual
harassment on campuses.
Different expectations
However, it seemed at times that schools had
different expeca?.ons for the conference, accord
ing to members oi the Stanford delegation.
The Stanford delegation arrived with carefully
researched reports in hopes of an exchange of
ideas with students of other schools. But they
often found many of the delegations unprepared,
with short or nonexistent reports, and members
who had been chosen only days before the start of

the conference.
The Dartmouth delegation had originally de
clined to come, but the members changed their
minds at the last minute. They had virtually no time
to prepare, according to Kathy Greene, a member
of the Dartmouth group.
Some delegates from eastern schools held view
points and concerns different from this of
Stanford delegates, and these differences at times
led to reluctance to discuss issues which Stanford
students felt important.
Title IX resolution
The extracurricular affairs committee adopted a
resolution calling for compliance with Title IX
without much discussion of the problems of im
plementing it in conjunction with a large competi
tion football program. Title IX is a provision prom
ulgated by the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare requiring equal educational oppor
tunities for students regardless of sex.
The committee balked at the suggestion of Stan
ford delegate Elisa Price that the problems of re
ligious cults trying to register as campus religious
groups should be discussed. Instead, the commit
tee passed a resolution calling for all schools to
refuse funding for the internal operations of stu
dents' religious arVd political organizations.
Despite the efforts of Stanford delegate Vicki
Baker, the student life committee refused to con
sider the resolutions dealing with minority con
cerns in the area of residential education and
counseling such as theme houses.
