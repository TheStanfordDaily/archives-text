# Haig worried over Soviet military growth

San Francisco — Gen. Alexander
Haig )r. expressed concern about
the "relentless growth in Soviet
military power" and the strength
of North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion (NATO) forces while speak
ing before the Commonwealth
Club of California Friday.
Haig, the Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe, said that
he was maintaining a "cautious
optimism" about NATO's
strength and called it"the most
cost-effective insurance policy
the American people have." He
also said that he was not satisfied
that NATO has an "assured level
of comfort" in any of the three
divisions of forces — conven
tional, nuclear and strategic.
The United States does not con
tribute a majority of the NATO
forces — Western European pow
ers constitute 90 percent of the
ground forces, 80 percent of the
naval support, and 75 percent of
the air force. Since 1970 U.S. con
tributions to NATO have declined
by 22 percent while the European
total has increased 13 percent, ac
cording to Haig.
He cited a study done in the
early 1970s by former Defense
Secretary James Schlesinger
which concluded that twice our
present defense allocations
would be required to sufficiently
replace the U.S. benefits from

NATO.
"We no longer have the luxury
of debating whether or not this is
a cost-effective and desirable en
terprise," Haig said. "We have no
alternative but to continue to par
ticipate as full members and to
carry our burden increasingly
both in the leadership and re
source areas."
In describing the Soviet military
threat, Haig addressed three basic
characteristics that compound the
tensions of U.S.-USSR relations:
long-term planning, balanced
growth and broadened scope.
He stated that the Soviet milit
ary spending has grown 4 to 5 per
cent each year for the past 15
years, a process that has "left
them with a large residue of mod
ern military equipment with
which to answer the plaintive calls
of Third World leaders."
In the last year $4 billion worth
of Soviet equipment was sent to
Third World nations, twice the
U.S. expenditure. In Ethiopia the
USSR spent $1 billion "in a matter
of months," more than the United
States has spent there since the
end of World War 11, according to
Haig.
Global threat
Whereas 30 years ago NATO
could afford "myopic preoccupa
tion with our force balances . . .
because Soviet power was essen
tially continental in character and

Eurasian in scope," the nature of
the threat itself has changed, Haig
explained. "In intervening years it
has become increasingly global in
character and it has become in
creasingly engaged in the politi
cal, economic and security nexus
of Western vitality.
"The task ahead surely is the
management of global Soviet
power through the greater integ
ration of the political, economic
and security assets of the western
world," he added.

One step toward this "man
agement" is reaching U.S.-USSR
agreement on SALT 11. Although
Haig would not offer a "moral
judgment" on the negotiations,
he pointed out that the basic
question to ask of SALT II is "does
it restrain the kind of Soviet build
ing and equally permit the kind of
American building we must
have?" Haig surprised the over
flow crowd with the revelation
that he has "not been consulted in
the process of arrival at that (final)
agreement."
Third world
In discussing the American
stand on Soviet intervention in
the Third World, Haig hopes the
United States will "not succumb
to what Dr. Henry Kissinger de
scribed recently as the assump
tion that justice rests exclusively
in the hands of those who will
adopt force, terrorand bloodshed
to seek change in status quo or to
accept the premise that the condi
tions for peace must be left in
the hands exclusively of those
who are willing to go to war."
Haig, 55, will retire from the
military on June 30 after four years
with NATO. Although he admits
having "intimate involvement in
the later period" of the Watergate
affair, he is considered to be a po
tential candidate for the Republi
can presidential nomination in
1980.

long-term planning, balanced
growth and broadened scope.
He stated that the Soviet milit
ary spending has grown 4 to 5 per
cent each year for the past 15
years, a process that has "left
them with a large residue of mod
ern military equipment with
which to answer the plaintive calls
of Third World leaders."
In the last year $4 billion worth
of Soviet equipment was sent to
Third World nations, twice the
U.S. expenditure. In Ethiopia the
USSR spent $1 billion "in a matter
of months," more than the United
States has spent there since the
end of World War 11, according to
Haig.
Global threat
Whereas 30 years ago NATO
could afford "myopic preoccupa
tion with our force balances . . .
because Soviet power was essen
tially continental in character and

Eurasian in scope," the nature of
the threat itself has changed, Haig
explained. "In intervening years it
has become increasingly global in
character and it has become in
creasingly engaged in the politi
cal, economic and security nexus
of Western vitality.
"The task ahead surely is the
management of global Soviet
power through the greater integ
ration of the political, economic
and security assets of the western
world," he added.

One step toward this "man
agement" is reaching U.S.-USSR
agreement on SALT 11. Although
Haig would not offer a "moral
judgment" on the negotiations,
he pointed out that the basic
question to ask of SALT II is "does
it restrain the kind of Soviet build
ing and equally permit the kind of
American building we must
have?" Haig surprised the over
flow crowd with the revelation
that he has "not been consulted in
the process of arrival at that (final)
agreement."
Third world
In discussing the American
stand on Soviet intervention in
the Third World, Haig hopes the
United States will "not succumb
to what Dr. Henry Kissinger de
scribed recently as the assump
tion that justice rests exclusively
in the hands of those who will
adopt force, terrorand bloodshed
to seek change in status quo or to
accept the premise that the condi
tions for peace must be left in
the hands exclusively of those
who are willing to go to war."
Haig, 55, will retire from the
military on June 30 after four years
with NATO. Although he admits
having "intimate involvement in
the later period" of the Watergate
affair, he is considered to be a po
tential candidate for the Republi
can presidential nomination in
1980.


Alexander Haig
San Francisco — Gen. Alexander
Haig )r. expressed concern about
the "relentless growth in Soviet
military power" and the strength
of North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion (NATO) forces while speak
ing before the Commonwealth
Club of California Friday.
Haig, the Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe, said that
he was maintaining a "cautious
optimism" about NATO's
strength and called it"the most
cost-effective insurance policy
the American people have." He
also said that he was not satisfied
that NATO has an "assured level
of comfort" in any of the three
divisions of forces — conven
tional, nuclear and strategic.
The United States does not con
tribute a majority of the NATO
forces — Western European pow
ers constitute 90 percent of the
ground forces, 80 percent of the
naval support, and 75 percent of
the air force. Since 1970 U.S. con
tributions to NATO have declined
by 22 percent while the European
total has increased 13 percent, ac
cording to Haig.
He cited a study done in the
early 1970s by former Defense
Secretary James Schlesinger
which concluded that twice our
present defense allocations
would be required to sufficiently
replace the U.S. benefits from

NATO.
"We no longer have the luxury
of debating whether or not this is
a cost-effective and desirable en
terprise," Haig said. "We have no
alternative but to continue to par
ticipate as full members and to
carry our burden increasingly
both in the leadership and re
source areas."
In describing the Soviet military
threat, Haig addressed three basic
characteristics that compound the
tensions of U.S.-USSR relations:
long-term planning, balanced
growth and broadened scope.
He stated that the Soviet milit
ary spending has grown 4 to 5 per
cent each year for the past 15
years, a process that has "left
them with a large residue of mod
ern military equipment with
which to answer the plaintive calls
of Third World leaders."
In the last year $4 billion worth
of Soviet equipment was sent to
Third World nations, twice the
U.S. expenditure. In Ethiopia the
USSR spent $1 billion "in a matter
