# Environmental protests slow exploration
## Offshore oil still years away 
### 
New York (AP) — Several years after
the oil presumed to be off the Atlantic
Coast was ballyhooed as the answer to
East Coast energy needs, you still can't
fuel your car or heat your home with it.
Legal and technical problems, and
just plain bad luck, are keeping the area
from playing a key part in the nation's
energy picture.
Now, though, the stage is set for
another try.
On Wednesday, the federal govern
ment will open bids from oil companies
for drilling rights in more areas of the
Baltimore Canyon, the best-known of
the Atlantic offshore areas. And a U.S.
Court of Appeals last week lifted an in
junction against the sale of sites in the
Georges Bank area off Cape Cod.
The East Coast offshore oil fields
were never intended to help relieve the
nation's reliance on oil imports before
the next decade. But now even the
most optimistic analysts don't expect to
see energy from the Atlantic before
1990.
In fact, the amount of natural gas
produced from the two successful At
lantic offshore wells in a day would be
less than enough to heat 100 average
sized homes for a year.
The numbers involved are what
caused the initial optimism. The Atlan
tic Coast area is believed to hold 13.6

trillion cubic feet of natural gas — about
eight months worth of U.S. supply —
and a lesser amount of crude oil.
Environmental protests
Five years ago, with foreign oil prices
rising, that looked great, especially to
the East Coast, which uses four times as
much imported oil as other parts of the
nation. But attempts to rush into pro
duction brought environmental pro
tests that are still being sorted out. As a
result, only two areas have been
explored, and only partially at that.
Wells off Georgia and the Carolinas
in the region known as the Southeast
Georgia Embayment produced no
thing, and oil firms have just about
given up on that area.
Drilling the Baltimore Canyon has
been just about as unsuccessful. Eleven
wells have been completed in the year
since exploration began, and nine have
come up dry. The other two produced
natural gas, but not nearly enough for
commercial production.
But while Wednesday's bidding on
additional Baltimore Canyon tracts will
probably not garner the $1.1 billion in
bids the first auction of sites brought, it
is seen as a key to the area's future.
Good success rate
Exploration experts say a drilling suc
cess rate of one in five is good, and that
is about what has happened in the Bal
timore Canyon. But the hits have not

been where most of the gas and oil is
supposed to be.
Most of the nine unsuccessful wells
drilled in the canyon have been drilled
on a gigantic geological structure called
"Stonedome." Other wells were drilled
on a smaller structure a few miles
south. Shaped like upside-down
teacups, these structures were be
lieved to be the best hopes for gas and
oil in the area.
But that did not prove out.
Instead, the two discoveries of
natural gas have come on the fringes of
the Baltimore Canyon area, near the
edge of the continental shelf about 100
miles offshore. There, Texaco found a
small amount of gas and is now looking
to see it there's enough to begin pro
duction, and a group of firms drilling
under government contract struck gas
accidentally— in a well supposed to be
only a geological test.
The well hit a tiny amount of gas, and
the discovery made a site next to it a hot
item in Wednesday's sale.
Once Wednesday's sale is over, gov
ernment officials will begin planning
the next auction of East Coast drilling
rights — this time for Georges Bank.
Last week's court approval of drilling
there — with conditions to safeguard
the bank's rich fishing grounds — paves
the way for an auction, probably in Sep
tember, government sources say.
