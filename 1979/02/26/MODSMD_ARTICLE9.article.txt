# Enthoven plan considered in Washington
## 
### Ruthann Richter 
While most experts agree on
the symptoms of today's health
care problems — phenomenal
cost escalation — few agree on
a cure, and there are many who
are critical of Alain Enthoven's
prescription.
Enthoven, 48, is a professor
at the Graduate School of Bus
iness whose National Health
Insurance proposal is currently
being bandied about in
Washington, D.C.
In simplified terms, Entho
ven's plan would annually give
each consumer the opportun
ity to enroll in one of several
local, government-approved
health plans. The consumer
would receive the same finan
cial assistance for health insur
ance no matter what plan he
chooses.
'Menu of choices'
Besides offering consumers
a "menu of choices so he can
find the best value," the plan
gives doctors and hospitals an
economic incentive to hold
down costs, Enthoven said.
He uses the "Expensive
Lunch Club" to explain cost
increasing incentives. The club
includes 19 friends who agree
to split the lunch bill equally.
One man decides he would be
happy with a $2 salad, but he
watches his friends ordering

$12 filet mignon and lobster.
He calculates that if he, too,
ordered the filet, it would cost
him only 50 cents more than
the salad.
By the same token, accord
ing to Enthoven's philosophy,
the current system reimburses
individual doctors through a
third party regardless of ex
penses incurred. Hence doc
tors can gain by prescribing
unnecessary and costly ser
vices.
Not everyone agrees, how
ever, with Enthoven's line of
thinking or the plan that has
come out of it.
Won't buy it
"There are a lot of people
who won't buy it. The labor
leaders are opposed to it. Their
general mind set is to look to
the government. Private sector
is bad," Enthoven said.
And the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
also does not favor the plan. It
prefers its own version, called
the Publicly Guaranteed
Health Protection. It would re
quire everyone to buy either
federal health insurance or a
government-approved plan of
fered through employers.
But, analyzes Enthoven, this
would fragment the market
and further discourage com
petition. His plan, in contrast,
would rely on the private sec

tor and the free force of com
petition.
But despite Enthoven's insis
tence on consumer orienta
tion, his background suggests
that his plan might have an
even larger constituency
among health care providers.
Providers have power
"Enthoven has a lot of practi
cal experience in rolling up his
sleeves and working with
health care providers," says
Dr. John Bunker, Enthoven's
successor as the Medical Cent
er's Health Services Research
director. "The providers are
the ones who have the power,
and if you're going to have any
effect you have to work with
them."
Recently Enthoven has spent
a lot of time circulating among
various private groups to get
backing for his proposal.
"I'd say it's gotten a lot of
recognition," he said. "It's sort
of a force that has to be re
ckoned with."
And Enthoven knows how to
reckon with force, having
worked both as deputy assis
tant and assistant secretary for
the defense department.
Georgetown
During his nine-year stint
there, Enthoven became a
member of the board of direc
tors at Georgetown University
where he was introduced to

medical issues.
"I saw that the decisive fi
nancial issues were in the Med
ical Center at Georgetown," he
said.
After leaving the defense
department in 1969, he trans
ferred to Litton Industries, a
corporation that produces,
among other things, medical
equipment.
"Because of the recent in
troduction of Medicaid and
Medicare, things were very hot
in the medical industry," he
said.
After two years in the busi
ness, he became president of
Litton. While there, he was
elected to the Institute of

Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences, a group
of experts who advise the gov
ernment on medical issues.
He said he came to realize
that "the health care industry
has a great big problem and it's
going to become bigger."
Enthoven came here in 1973
and in four years, worked out
his version of the National
Health Insurance plan. He is
still in the process of perfecting
it, saying that what he really
wants to see eventually are
"clinics out in shopping cen
ters."
"That's good. That's what I
want," he said.

"I'd say it's gotten a lot of
recognition," he said. "It's sort
of a force that has to be re
ckoned with."
And Enthoven knows how to
reckon with force, having
worked both as deputy assis
tant and assistant secretary for
the defense department.
Georgetown
During his nine-year stint
there, Enthoven became a
member of the board of direc
tors at Georgetown University
where he was introduced to

medical issues.
"I saw that the decisive fi
nancial issues were in the Med
ical Center at Georgetown," he
said.
After leaving the defense
department in 1969, he trans
ferred to Litton Industries, a
corporation that produces,
among other things, medical
equipment.
"Because of the recent in
troduction of Medicaid and
Medicare, things were very hot
in the medical industry," he
said.
After two years in the busi
ness, he became president of
Litton. While there, he was
elected to the Institute of

Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences, a group
of experts who advise the gov
ernment on medical issues.
He said he came to realize
that "the health care industry
has a great big problem and it's
going to become bigger."
Enthoven came here in 1973
and in four years, worked out
his version of the National
Health Insurance plan. He is
still in the process of perfecting
it, saying that what he really
wants to see eventually are
"clinics out in shopping cen
ters."
"That's good. That's what I
want," he said.


Alain Enthoven
While most experts agree on
the symptoms of today's health
care problems — phenomenal
cost escalation — few agree on
a cure, and there are many who
are critical of Alain Enthoven's
prescription.
Enthoven, 48, is a professor
at the Graduate School of Bus
iness whose National Health
Insurance proposal is currently
being bandied about in
Washington, D.C.
In simplified terms, Entho
ven's plan would annually give
each consumer the opportun
ity to enroll in one of several
local, government-approved
health plans. The consumer
would receive the same finan
cial assistance for health insur
ance no matter what plan he
chooses.
'Menu of choices'
Besides offering consumers
a "menu of choices so he can
find the best value," the plan
gives doctors and hospitals an
economic incentive to hold
down costs, Enthoven said.
He uses the "Expensive
Lunch Club" to explain cost
increasing incentives. The club
includes 19 friends who agree
to split the lunch bill equally.
One man decides he would be
happy with a $2 salad, but he
watches his friends ordering

$12 filet mignon and lobster.
He calculates that if he, too,
ordered the filet, it would cost
him only 50 cents more than
the salad.
By the same token, accord
ing to Enthoven's philosophy,
the current system reimburses
individual doctors through a
third party regardless of ex
penses incurred. Hence doc
tors can gain by prescribing
unnecessary and costly ser
vices.
Not everyone agrees, how
ever, with Enthoven's line of
thinking or the plan that has
come out of it.
Won't buy it
"There are a lot of people
who won't buy it. The labor
leaders are opposed to it. Their
general mind set is to look to
the government. Private sector
is bad," Enthoven said.
And the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
also does not favor the plan. It
prefers its own version, called
the Publicly Guaranteed
Health Protection. It would re
quire everyone to buy either
federal health insurance or a
government-approved plan of
fered through employers.
But, analyzes Enthoven, this
would fragment the market
and further discourage com
petition. His plan, in contrast,
would rely on the private sec

tor and the free force of com
petition.
But despite Enthoven's insis
tence on consumer orienta
tion, his background suggests
that his plan might have an
even larger constituency
among health care providers.
Providers have power
"Enthoven has a lot of practi
cal experience in rolling up his
sleeves and working with
health care providers," says
Dr. John Bunker, Enthoven's
successor as the Medical Cent
er's Health Services Research
director. "The providers are
the ones who have the power,
and if you're going to have any
effect you have to work with
them."
Recently Enthoven has spent
a lot of time circulating among
various private groups to get
backing for his proposal.
"I'd say it's gotten a lot of
recognition," he said. "It's sort
of a force that has to be re
ckoned with."
