LONG ago there was a wandering merchant
whose fortune was reduced by circumstance to
his riding camel and a donkey who carried his
gear Soon after passing through a small village
one day.he came across a farmer who had just
finished harvesting a wheat field Recalling a st
able owner s need for fresh straw for his stable
the merchant saw a chance to turn a small but
quicK profit and offered to buy the straw But the
wanderer having no copper, not to mention
silver or gold was forced to offer his camel as
collateral a clear case of the camel that
backed the broker s straw
