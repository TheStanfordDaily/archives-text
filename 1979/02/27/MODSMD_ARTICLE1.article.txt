# Instant book capitalizes on Guyana massacre
## 
### Rod Stevens 
The title is The Suicide Cult,
The Inside Story of the Peoples
Temple Sect and the Massacre
in Guyana. Written in four days
and published in less than two
weeks, the book is typical of
the new breed of instant books
that have emerged in the last
few years to capitalize on sen
sational news stories. Like
most instant books, this was
written by a staff of newspaper
reporters and shipped out with
lightning speed to catch
readers still curious about a
major news event.
Marshall Kilduff, a 1971 Stan
ford alumnus and a former
Daily editor, and Ron (avers are
the two San Francisco Chroni
cle reporters who wrote the
book. Javers witnessed the first
violent outbreaks in Guyana
and was wounded in the gun
fire that killed Rep. Leo Ryan;
Kilduff was never in Guyana
but had written articles on Jim

Jones while the cult leader was
still in San Francisco.
The book is written in the
punchy, journalistic style of a
narrative. Its chapters take the
reader from Jones' childhood
through Ryan's trip and centers
in on the gory details of the
mass suicide.
The book project began
Sunday, Nov. 26 when Judy
Helsinger, west coast editor for
Bantam books, called her New
York editor to see if the com
pany would want an "extra," a
quick publication on Guyana.
Hilsinger had opened her
morning paper to see the first
reports of Guyana shooting
and suicides, and found that
television networks were de
voting all their programming to
coverage.
Smelled sensation
"I smelled a sensational
story," recalls Helsinger. "That
day the radios had nothing but
news about it, and when I went

to a party that night, that's all
people were talking about."
Helsinger called her boss at
11 p.m. and received the go
ahead. The following morning
she approached the Chronicle.
"We needed the backing of a
newspaper since the book
would have to be a team effort
to get it written fast and to
check up on all the details,"
she said. "Choosing the
Chronicle was natural, with
both Javers and Kilduff on the
staff, and the Peoples Temple a
local phenomena."
Kilduff's acquaintance with
Jones had begun in 1976 when
Jones was appointed by Mayor
George Moscone as honorary
commissioner of the Housing
Authority. At that time Kilduff
was a political and education
writer covering city hall
events.
The Chronicle had earlier
run a feature on Jones, written
by a different reporter." I

thought the article was pretty
tame," said Kilduff. "It didn't
fully explore the Jones
phenomenon, since it neg
lected his drawing power.
Jones could fill a meeting room
at City Hall with old people.
The old folks weren't listening
to any of the testimony, in fact
they didn't seem to know what
was going on. But no matter
where Jones stood they had
their eyes riveted on him.
'Odd style'
Originally I saw him as a
politically influential guy, a
person traveling in odd style
with a number of followers. He
was continually flattering re
porters in an attempt to woo
the press. I thought he was a
phony, but I couldn't put my
finger on the exact reason why.
"It's hard to resist someone
like him at times. We all think
we're very independent, but its
still nice to hear a reassuring
voice at the right time."

Jones became increasingly
prominent as a religious figure
and was courted by local politi
cians who wanted the support
of his followers, Kilduff said.
But the Chronicle rejected the
idea of a second more penet
rating feature on Jones, so Kil
duff decided to freelance his
own in-depth article.
He spent several months try
ing to sell the story before New
Wesf magazine accepted it.
Meanwhile he continued to
edit it as ex-cult members told
him stories of physical
punishment and coercion
within the church. And as Kil
duff asked lones more and
more critical questions, a bar
rage of letters flooded the New
West offices begging the
magazine editors not to run the
story.
But New West went ahead
with the story and shortly after
it was printed in August 1977,
