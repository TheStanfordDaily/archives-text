## Revise U.S. policy on illegal aliens 
### 
America once prided itself on its lofty
idealism in providing sanctuary to all op
pressed individuals. America once wel
comed with open arms immigrants who
were searching for lucrative employment.
America still glories in this image of
grandiloquent benevolence today — ex
cept when it come to the subject of illegal
aliens.
Modest estimates evidence the pre
sence of at least eight million un
documented aliens residing in the United
States — four-fifths of them from Mexico.
The object of their egress from the native
homeland is always the same: to escape
disastrous economic conditions and find
employment. (Even when employment is
available at home, compensations are
miniscule compared even to the lowest
paying jobs in the United States.)
My intent here is to invalidate some
falsehoods concerning the actual condi
tion of illegal aliens in America, to dispel
some prejudices pertaining to their '.'illeg
ality," and to clarify the few policy options
open to the Carter administration.
First, we should note that illegal aliens
are not displacing native labor forces; they
are not "robbing" us of deserved
employment opportunities. Employment
always awaits those who will work
cheaply. Illegal aliens will work for less
than minimum wage. Consequently, their
hiring is economical and profit-inducing
for the employer.
Second, these illegal aliens are not seek
ing the same social benefits such as un
employment compensation and food
stamps that keep our native residents from
working. Because they live in constantfear
of detection and punishment, illegal aliens
hesitate to link themselves with the gov
ernment in any way.
Third, these undocumented aliens can
not be held as reprehensible as ordinary
criminals. Their classification as intransi
gents must be modified to account for the
following extenuating factors.
A) The economic plight of illegal aliens is
quite desperate: while in Mexico, they
continually face the threat of starvation

since they often lack the opportunity to
earn money.
B) Professional smugglers encourage
and abet Mexicans in their attempts to
cross the border clandestinely. Not only
are they accomplices in the "crime,"
therefore, but they are often the "means"
by which the "crime" is committed.
C) The Mexican government itself
makes no endeavor to prevent its citizens
from secretly emigrating to the United
States. Mexico suffers from widespread
poverty, a high birth rate and 40 percent
unemployment. It needs such a popula
tion "outflow" as a functional "safety
valve" in order to preserve the stability of
its economic system.
D) Illegal aliens are riot treated "ration
ally" once they arrive in the United States.
Governmental options, once a person has
been identified as an undocumented
alien, remain twofold: 1) either deport the
alien, or 2) grant him amnesty.
Because the U.S. government has been
indecisive in its policy direction, illegal
aliens have been inflicted with varying de
grees of social mistreatment and unheal
thy Irving/working conditions. President
Lopez Portillo complained of this exploita
tion publicly to President )immy Carter last
week in Mexico.
Actually, the U.S. government posses
ses only two viable policy options, one of
which it can, at best, have only indirect
influence over. Both of these options must
account for the expressed (although quite
debatable) "need" for Mexican oil.
Given our desire for oil and our mutual
desire to stop the accumulation of illegal
aliens, our most feasible policy option re
mains the following: to attempt to halt
this population flow, but in as discreet a
way as possible.
The Immigration and Naturalization
Service has been conducting a limited
program to intercept smugglers — ap
prehending 10,000 in just 1976 alone.
If this program were expanded, continu
ing to "crack down" not directly on the
illegal aliens themselves but on the -
"means" by which the aliens get to

America — i.e., the smugglers — then
numbers of illegal aliens infiltrating per
year could be reduced without the direct
antagonization of Mexico that could be
caused by direct deportation.
And we would be focusing on the "real"
criminals involved, the smugglers, who
are motivated not by the exigencies of
starvation, but by greed.
A second, but less feasible, proposal
would be to attempt to indirectly improve
(through political persuasion and coercive
power) economic conditions in Mexico —
those which cause the Mexicans to leave in
the first place.
Direct aid would be out of the question
at this time in light of our immense federal
deficit. And American political influence
in Mexico will in any case be feeble: en
deavors to persuade the Mexican govern
ment to create new jobs through public
works programs with new financial re
sources generated by oil production will
be ineffective.
Mexico, in such a circumstance, can
merely threaten to halt the importation of
oil into the United States unless we desist
"interventionist" demands. This they can
do with impunity; for if we do not buy
their oil, other nations will. America will
not clog its "safety-valve" for population
excesses as long as we wish to keep the oil
pipelines open.
Also, it is a historical fact that developing
nations in the Third World do not gener
ally use increased national revenues to
improve the living or educational facilities
available to the public. Wealthy elites en
trenched in power tend to block the
"trickle-down" of financial resources to
provide for social benefits. They instead
further institutionalize and preserve their
own fortunes and power positions.
The topic of illegal alien immigration is a
complex one fraught with unknown politi
cal contingencies. But perhaps an in
creased understanding of the difficulties
involved can stir the needed inspiration
for a truly comprehensive solution.
