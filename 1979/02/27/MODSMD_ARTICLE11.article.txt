## Future planning starts yesterday 
### 
Recently, for the first time, I
walked into the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
(CPPC). I had avoided it for the
first three and a half years of
school, but a few days ago,
something guided my steps
into that building. There is no
rational reason why I avoided
the place for so long. Thinking
back, the whole thing seems to
have been second nature.
Even during freshman orien
tation I broke off from the tour
of campus facilities just as it
disappeared behind those
doors. My freshman adviser
saw me hanging back and said:
"Aren't you coming in? In a
few years you'll want to know
how this office works."
"Oh, no," I replied, "thanks
just the same."
Later, I found out that my ad
viser was a Spanish professor.
She was very nice. She invited
all of her advisees to her con
dominium for tacos and salad,
but she didn't know much
about medicine, which is what
I thought I wanted to study.
That was before the English
professor told me English was
my field, and the philosophy
professor told me I'd be wast
ing my intellectual gifts doing
anything but an honors project
in philosophy. It was flattering,
before I realized that the fu
tures of their departments de
pended on reversing trends of
declining student interest.
So I returned to watching
people and have been fairly
content these past few years.
Classes have come and gone.
Papers have been handed in
more or less on time. Every
thing smooth, everything easy.

My professors don't ask my
opinion, and I generally don't
offer it. My student number is
0175-261981. I've never voted
in an ASSU election. I've al
ways collected my rebates — in
full.
Except for the alienation and
bitterness brewing within me,
which never reveals itself in
class, I am the ideal college
student. Of myself it could be
said: "He came, he paid his
money, and he left."
But then I entered the
CPPC. Maybe it was because
conversations lately have
begun reverting to the subject
of my future. Perhaps some
deep-rooted insecurity found
the light of day for the first
time. The computation of edu
cational dollars spent to real
dollars earned tends to put the
people-watcher on the defen
sive.
The first thing I saw in the
CPPC was their calendar:
"January-February 1979 —
Here is What You've Missed,"
the caption read. The days
were bound by boxes, and in
side the boxes were the names
of business personnel and vo
cational lectures. Before long, I
knew exactly what I had mis
sed. How quickly career op
tions can close for you.
Freshmen, heed the warning I
ignored, establish your file yes
terday at the latest. The path
gets rockier from here.
I walked down a corridor
into the main room. There sat
students, young men like my
self, dressed in very nice suits.
They read magazines and had
their legs tightly crossed. I
guess I had something like an

epiphany then: I saw myself as
an immature punk in the midst
of future titans and my eyes
burned with . . .
I couldn't help but think of a
finely oiled machine and the
smooth, quiet noise it makes
when everything is running
right, with the right stuff being
shoved into "input," and the
right stuff being belched out of
"output." I knew I had to make
an appointment to talk to
someone, so I walked up to the
desk and asked if anyone might
be able to help me.
"And what is your major?"
the woman asked.
"English literature," I said,
pronouncing both t's.
"In that case I would re
commend a peer counselor,"
she said, "or perhaps a doc
tor."
I tried to sound indignant.
"Look here, I have some
specific plans I would like to
discuss with someone," I said.
She shook her head doubt
fully and started to write a note
on a slip of paper.
"Okay, but you can't see
anyone until the 27th," she
said.
"Fine, fine," I said.
She took the slip of paper,

stood up, and leaned over the
counter.
"This is so you won't forget,"
she said, pinning it to the front
of my shirt.
I mumbled a thank you and
turned to leave. Just then a tall
man in a dark blue suit walked
into the room. He had a clip

board with a yellow Shell Oil
Company seashell on the bot
tom. He called out a name and
one of the students sprang up
from the couch. I could hear
their hands clasp together as I
walked out.
