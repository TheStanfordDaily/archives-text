# School vandalism decreases in cities
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The
decade-long epidemic of van
dalism and violence that has in
fected many school systems
appears to be easing in some of
the nation's biggest cities.
However, federal studies
have shown that attacks against
teachers and students and
malicious damage to school
property have spread and wor
sened in suburban and rural
schools.
No one contends that school
crime in big cities is no longer a
serious social problem in
urban America.
But in some large school sys
tems, an Associated Press sur
vey found that the number of
reported crimes has been
leveling off or declining in the
past several years.
Desegregation
— In Boston, where massive
violence marked a 1974 school
desegregation order, school
officials report a steady de
crease in school crime since
then.
—In Detroit, Chief of Sec
urity Frank Blount reports a

"significant drop in incidents
of school violence," and cre
dits the improvement to a bet
ter attitude among students
and improved security mea
sures.
—In Chicago, Board of Edu
cation figures show a steady
decline in the number of as
saults against teachers over the
past four years. In the 1978
school year there were 1 042
such assaults, compared with
1628 in 1975. In the first three
months of the current year,
there have been 240 assaults
reported.
—In Miami, a school
spokeswoman, Georgia Slack,
reports that "vandalism is up
but assaults are down." As
saults against teachers in the
first six months of the current
year totaled 165, compared
with 180 in the comparable
period last year. Similarly,
there were 455 assaults against
students so far this year, down
from 462 a year ago.
Vandalism down
—In Kansas City, adminis
trators had no figures on per

sonal attacks against students
or teachers, but said vandalism
has decreased each year since
1968. A decade ago, vandalism
cost the school system
$470,000, while last year the fi
gure was $176,000.
Not all big cities have that
kind of good news to report. In
particular, New York and Los
Angeles report that gang activ
ity has worsened the siege at
mosphere in school corridors.
In Los Angeles, assaults to
taled 894 in the 1978 school
year, up 6.68 percent from 838
a year earlier. And a court
order ending segregation in
the city's schools this past fall
has contributed to a further in
crease in violence, according
to Richard Green, chief of sec
urity of the Los Angeles Unified
School District.
Robbery up
And in New York City, re
ported crimes rose by 16.3 per
cent in the first five months of
the current school year com
pared with the same period last
year. Robbery and weapons
possession was up 60 percent.

Some contend that statistics
on school violence are self
serving and unreliable.
Harriet O'Donnell, presi
dent of the Chicago region
PTA, for instance, agrees that
violence in that city's schools is
down, but doubts the accuracy
of the city's assault figures.
"Students and faculty are
discouraged from reporting
violence. School adminis
trators are concerned with
their statistical image," she
says.
Nonetheless, recent reports
from these large city school
systems are consistent with a
federal study of school vio
lence a year ago which con
cluded that school crime has
been leveling off since the
mid-19705.

saults against teachers in the
first six months of the current
year totaled 165, compared
with 180 in the comparable
period last year. Similarly,
there were 455 assaults against
students so far this year, down
from 462 a year ago.
Vandalism down
—In Kansas City, adminis
trators had no figures on per

sonal attacks against students
or teachers, but said vandalism
has decreased each year since
1968. A decade ago, vandalism
cost the school system
$470,000, while last year the fi
gure was $176,000.
Not all big cities have that
kind of good news to report. In
particular, New York and Los
Angeles report that gang activ
ity has worsened the siege at
mosphere in school corridors.
In Los Angeles, assaults to
taled 894 in the 1978 school
year, up 6.68 percent from 838
a year earlier. And a court
order ending segregation in
the city's schools this past fall
has contributed to a further in
crease in violence, according
to Richard Green, chief of sec
urity of the Los Angeles Unified
School District.
Robbery up
And in New York City, re
ported crimes rose by 16.3 per
cent in the first five months of
the current school year com
pared with the same period last
year. Robbery and weapons
possession was up 60 percent.

Some contend that statistics
on school violence are self
serving and unreliable.
Harriet O'Donnell, presi
dent of the Chicago region
PTA, for instance, agrees that
violence in that city's schools is
down, but doubts the accuracy
of the city's assault figures.
"Students and faculty are
discouraged from reporting
violence. School adminis
trators are concerned with
their statistical image," she
says.
Nonetheless, recent reports
from these large city school
systems are consistent with a
federal study of school vio
lence a year ago which con
cluded that school crime has
been leveling off since the
mid-19705.
