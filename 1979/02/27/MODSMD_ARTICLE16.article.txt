# New school record established
## Cards win rousing home finale, 79-76 
### Chris Haft 
Saving its most exciting bas
ketball for last, Stanford gave
its Maples Pavilion fans some
thing to glow over during the
off-season by defeating Ore
gon State, 79-76, in the Cardi
nals' 1978-79 home finale last
night.
In snapping an eight-game
loss string against the 18-8
Beavers, Stanford set a new
school field goal percentage
record. The Cards made 31 of
their4s attempts from the floor
for a 68 9 figure, eclipsing the
old mark of 68.4 (49-for-80) set
against Denver in 1974.
The blueprint for victory was
drawn in the first half as the
Cards shot 72.7 percent (16-
for-22) and took a *8-36 lead at
intermission.
The foundation was laid as
Kimberly Belton, who scored
21 points on 9-for-10 shooting
before fouling out, opened the
second half with an eight-foot
bank shot and a tip-in.
Construction ensued as
Stanford dynamited the Beav
ers with heady defense and the
emergence of architect Wolfe
Perry.
Perry's three hoops — a 22-

foot bomb, a running 15-footer
and a breakaway dunk follow
ing a steal — were big pieces in
the 16-6 wall that the Cards
built over the first 7:41 of the
second half.
With Stanford now holding a
56-42 advantage, one could see
victory's skyscraper over the
horizon.
Yet the redoubtable Beavers
did their best to destroy the
Cards' tower. Minutes later
Steve Johnson scored five
points in a row to cut Stan
ford's lead to 58-50.
Jeff Stoutt's 18-footer with
4:02 to go brought OSU a bas
ket closer at 70-64, but Belton's
driving baseline lay-in and
Doug Marty's 16-footer
momentarily quelled the
threat.
The Beavers then scored
eight of the next nine points,
reducing the margin to 75-72
on Mark Radford's 24-foot
moon shot from the left corner
with 50 seconds remaining.
But Perry then performed
like a true hero, ending his
Maples career and saving the
game by bouncing in a free
throw and making a superhu
man steal of an OSU pass to set

up Jeff Ryan's two free throws
that gave Stanford a 78-72 lead
and completed the victory
edifice.
Early it appeared that the
Beavers might repeat their
73-48 thrashing of Stanford )an.
26, in which, ironically, OSU
also set a school record for
field goal percentage.
Aided by Stanford's turnov
ers, OSU grabbed a 9-4 lead,
but Brian Welch's pair of 22-
footers and Belton's free throw
surrounded Tony Martin's
tip-in and kept the Cards close
at 11-9.
Tom Schmalzried then made
what was probably the most as
sertive play of his career, tak
ing Belton's long inbounds
pass and slamming the ball
through left-handed while
being fouled by Johnson.
Schmalzried's accompany
ing free throw gave the Cards a
12-11 lead and sparked several
minutes of daring fast-breaks
and long jump shots.
Emotion was the primary
material the Cards used to
build their triumph. One obvi
ous cause for Stanford's
heightened intensity was the
fact that this was Perry's and
Paul Ciovacchini's last home

game.
"Paul and I both wanted to
go out with a win," Perry said.
"We've lost too many games
here in the past."
Perry added that the major
fountain for the Cards' emo
tional stream was Belton, who
played with more than his
usual immense ferocity last
night.
"We wanted this game
badly," Belton explained. "We
thought we were deprived
against Oregon, and we
wanted to prove that when you
come to our home court we'll
give you a run for your
money."
OSU coach Ralph Miller ac
cepted the defeat with
equanimity, calmly saying that
this was "probably" his Beav
ers' worst Pacific-10 Confer
ence game.
"Certainly we didn't play as
well as we can," Miller said.
"No question about that. Vou
could say it was poor defense
on our part but you can't take
anything away from them (the
Cards)."
Nobody took anything away
from Perry's performance,
either: a team-high 23 points
on 10-for-15 shooting. "Wolfe

played possessed out there for
a little while," commented
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso.
The Cards, 12-13 overall and
6-10 in conference, will try to
continue their magic Thursday
against USC and Saturday at
UCLA.

"We've lost too many games
here in the past."
Perry added that the major
fountain for the Cards' emo
tional stream was Belton, who
played with more than his
usual immense ferocity last
night.
"We wanted this game
badly," Belton explained. "We
thought we were deprived
against Oregon, and we
wanted to prove that when you
come to our home court we'll
give you a run for your
money."
OSU coach Ralph Miller ac
cepted the defeat with
equanimity, calmly saying that
this was "probably" his Beav
ers' worst Pacific-10 Confer
ence game.
"Certainly we didn't play as
well as we can," Miller said.
"No question about that. Vou
could say it was poor defense
on our part but you can't take
anything away from them (the
Cards)."
Nobody took anything away
from Perry's performance,
either: a team-high 23 points
on 10-for-15 shooting. "Wolfe

played possessed out there for
a little while," commented
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso.
The Cards, 12-13 overall and
6-10 in conference, will try to
continue their magic Thursday
against USC and Saturday at
UCLA.

KIMBERLY BELTON soars rim-high lo drop in a basket over Oregon
State's (ulius Allen (41) in first-half action last night at Maples Pavil
ion. Cardinal Tom Schmalzried (44) watches. Belton made several
other shots like this one, scoring 21 points as Stanford defeated the
Beavers 79-76.
Saving its most exciting bas
ketball for last, Stanford gave
its Maples Pavilion fans some
thing to glow over during the
off-season by defeating Ore
gon State, 79-76, in the Cardi
nals' 1978-79 home finale last
night.
In snapping an eight-game
loss string against the 18-8
Beavers, Stanford set a new
school field goal percentage
record. The Cards made 31 of
their4s attempts from the floor
for a 68 9 figure, eclipsing the
old mark of 68.4 (49-for-80) set
against Denver in 1974.
The blueprint for victory was
drawn in the first half as the
Cards shot 72.7 percent (16-
for-22) and took a *8-36 lead at
intermission.
The foundation was laid as
Kimberly Belton, who scored
21 points on 9-for-10 shooting
before fouling out, opened the
second half with an eight-foot
bank shot and a tip-in.
Construction ensued as
Stanford dynamited the Beav
ers with heady defense and the
emergence of architect Wolfe
Perry.
Perry's three hoops — a 22-

foot bomb, a running 15-footer
and a breakaway dunk follow
ing a steal — were big pieces in
the 16-6 wall that the Cards
built over the first 7:41 of the
second half.
With Stanford now holding a
56-42 advantage, one could see
victory's skyscraper over the
horizon.
Yet the redoubtable Beavers
did their best to destroy the
Cards' tower. Minutes later
Steve Johnson scored five
points in a row to cut Stan
ford's lead to 58-50.
Jeff Stoutt's 18-footer with
4:02 to go brought OSU a bas
ket closer at 70-64, but Belton's
driving baseline lay-in and
Doug Marty's 16-footer
momentarily quelled the
threat.
The Beavers then scored
eight of the next nine points,
reducing the margin to 75-72
on Mark Radford's 24-foot
moon shot from the left corner
with 50 seconds remaining.
But Perry then performed
like a true hero, ending his
Maples career and saving the
game by bouncing in a free
throw and making a superhu
man steal of an OSU pass to set

up Jeff Ryan's two free throws
that gave Stanford a 78-72 lead
and completed the victory
edifice.
Early it appeared that the
Beavers might repeat their
73-48 thrashing of Stanford )an.
26, in which, ironically, OSU
also set a school record for
field goal percentage.
Aided by Stanford's turnov
ers, OSU grabbed a 9-4 lead,
but Brian Welch's pair of 22-
footers and Belton's free throw
surrounded Tony Martin's
tip-in and kept the Cards close
at 11-9.
Tom Schmalzried then made
what was probably the most as
sertive play of his career, tak
ing Belton's long inbounds
pass and slamming the ball
through left-handed while
being fouled by Johnson.
Schmalzried's accompany
ing free throw gave the Cards a
12-11 lead and sparked several
minutes of daring fast-breaks
and long jump shots.
Emotion was the primary
material the Cards used to
build their triumph. One obvi
ous cause for Stanford's
heightened intensity was the
fact that this was Perry's and
Paul Ciovacchini's last home

game.
"Paul and I both wanted to
go out with a win," Perry said.
"We've lost too many games
here in the past."
Perry added that the major
fountain for the Cards' emo
tional stream was Belton, who
played with more than his
usual immense ferocity last
