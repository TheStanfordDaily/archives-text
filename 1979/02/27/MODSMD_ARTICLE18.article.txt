## theater/jiri weiss 'Abdication' a brave undertaking 
### 
Before she was 20 she became the absolute monarch of one of
the greatest powers of 17th century Europe. She was a woman
unsure of her own sexual identity in a world dominated by men.
She was both passionate and fearful of her passion. At the age of
28, surrounded by intrigue and scandal, she converted to
Catholicism and went into a self-imposed exile in Rome.
She was Christina of Sweden. She is the subject of Ruth Wolff's
1%9 play The Abdication which has its American premiere at the
Eureka Theatre in San Francisco.
An interrogation
Upon her arrival in Rome, Christina is interrogated by Az
zolino, a cardinal with aspirations for the papacy, who is to
determine whether she is to be accepted into the fold.
The cardinals are split over Christina's conversion. The con
version of the protestant monarch is potentially an enormous
coup for the church but Christina is surrounded by scandal that
could be harmful. The play centers on the confession Christina
makes, first willingly and later unwillingly, to Azzolino.
Californian
From the first instant the tall blond Susan Kampe appears on
the stage, dressed in black riding boots, green pants and jacket,
she is a high strung modern Californian woman. There is not
much of a queen in her. Her movements are not that of an
aristocrat, but surprisingly that doesn't go against the play. The
play is not about the Christina portrayed in history books, but
about a woman driven by ambition, a woman in search of herself.
Dan Cathon gives an excellent performance as Azzolino — he is
cool and unapproachable, but also tender. Christina reveals all
her innermost feelings and thoughts to him. Her life unwinds
before our eyes.
Alter egos
Wolff's technique is truly innovative, and she is at her best.
While Christina confesses, her childhood is acted out by her two
alter egos, one male (Chris) and the other female (Tina). We see
her as a young girl obeying her prime minister Oxenstierna
downstage, and fencing as a man upstage. The alter egos illus

trate the fundamental conflict of Christina's personality.
Christina thinks of herself as a freak like the mute dwarf Birgito,
played by Michael Lee Gozin, who is her travelling companion.
From birth she is taught to be firm, to rule as a man and yet she
also desires to be a woman. "Look at me!" she cries out, "Two
sexes! Both at once and neither." At night Christina cannot sleep
not knowing whether to rule firmly orwith love. She realizes that
she chooses emissaries by the color of their eyes.
Turmoil
During his long interrogation of Christina, Azzolino seems
perfectly composed. But inside, there is turmoil. He sees himself
in Christina. Her loves and fears are his. Outwardly he is full of
rhetoric, but inside he is in love with Christina (who has no
qualms about confessing her love for him).
At the beginning Christina confesses to Azzolino; now their
roles are switched. Azzolino's composure is broken. He reveals
the painful hair shirt underneath his robe, to show the penitence
he paid for his sinful past.
In the end Azzolino leaves Christina for the papacy just as it
seems that they have found happiness in each other. Both Christ
ina and Azzolino are driven by their ambition. But they are striv
ing toward something they are not, and that is why they are in
constant psychological pain. What Wolff shows is. a natural
human condition.
It is a pity that both the set and the costumes detract from the
play. They look plastic and artificial.
In spite of some uneven acting, especially from the supporting
cast, the play is worthwhile for those interested in the changing
world of the sexes.
The production is a brave undertaking by a non-professional
theatre and provides a contrast to the better established profes
sional theatres downtown.
(The Abdication plays through March Wat the Eureka Theater, 16th
and Market in San Francisco.)
