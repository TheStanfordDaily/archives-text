# Film maker here

### 
Tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the
Forum Room of Meyer Library,
the highly acclaimed Ethiopian
film maker, Haile Gerima, will
present and discuss his film,
Bush Mama.
Bush Mama is a powerful
portrait of urban black
America. The film focuses on
Dorothy, a black woman living
on welfare in Watts, trying to
raise her daughter while her
man is in jail for a crime he
didn't commit. Bush Mama has
all the immediacy and impact
of a documentary, capturing
the rich, distinctive style of
ghetto language and humor.
Ninety-five minutes in
length, and a remarkable piece
of independent film making,
this film won a number of
awards: the Grand Prix of the
Locarno International Film Fes
tival, 1976; the Georges Sadoul
Prize of the International Film
Critics Association, 1976; the
Grand Prix of the Portuguese
International Film Festival,
1976; the "Best Feature Film"
of the Oakland Museum's
Black Film Makers Flail of
Fame.
Each of Gerima's films re
flects his view of the proper
role of a socially responsible,
independent Third World film
maker. On one occasion,
when asked what kind of audi
ence he was attempting to
reach in Bush Mama, he re
sponded:
"Well, my feeling is that
today both film maker and au

dience are victims â€” that is,
myself as a film maker, as well
as the audience I identify with,
are both corrupted and fal
sified in terms of our tastes. So
in Bush Mama I've deliberately
refused to use the negative way
we have all been conditioned
to see films throughout the
85-year history of the Western
cinema. My interest is in de
molishing that negative way of
perceiving characters or a story
and, at the same time, develop
ing a positive language in
cinema.
. . . "But I have no illusions
about reaching a mass audience
with Bush Mama. In fact, if
people turned out for Bush
Mama, in the same numbers as
they do for Mahogany, I would
critically question my work,
something would be wrong. I
mean, I wouldn't make
another film for two to three
years, because I know the
tastes of the mass audience are
corrupted. I think it's a slow
process, to appeal to the posi
tive, rational side of society, so
my films will he appreciated as
that audience develops. But at
this point a mass audience is
still an abstract consideration
for me.
Gerima will be on campus

27. Croups or individuals in
terested in having an audience
