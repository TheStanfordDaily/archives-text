## Reviving an old standby 
### 
just about the best thing that can be said
about the new movie version of When You
Comin ' Back, Red Ryder is that it is never dull.
Most of the interest comes from the fact that
When You Comin' Back, like another much
advertised movie of two decades ago, has
something in it to offend everyone.
While filmmakers are finally attempting
to present some fairly meaningful examina
tions of the Vietnam war, When You Comin'
Back, Red Ryder decides to revive the old
standby: the psychotic veteran, eyes glazed
and mind twisted by his experiences in Asia.
Marjoe Gortner, who produced this film as
well as grabbing the plum role for himself,
brings little to his characterization of the vet
eran except insanity. There is no indication of
whether this man was driven looney by the
war alone or whether he had always posses
sed the spark of madness that Gortner relies
on so heavily.
Muddled
Gortner's character, after being stopped at
the Mexican border and having a tube stuck
up his rectum by sadistic customs officials in
search of cocaine, zooms into Texas, only to
have his van break down near a small motel/
cafe. As he waits to have his car repaired, he
amuses himself by terrorizing and humiliat
ing the cafe's occupants. It is, evidently, all
deeply allegorical, but the message is so
muddled that it's very difficult to discern
exactly what the makers of this film are trying
to prove.
The Red Ryder in the title is a young man
who chooses to be an anachronism: the film
is set in 1967 but he dresses as if it were 10
years earlier, with greased hair, T-shirt and
tight jeans. Peter Firth, who played the
young horselover in Equus, had more work
to do than the rest of the cast as he sweats in
the Texas heat and struggles, usually success
fully, to exchange his British accent for a

Texan one. His character, too, is meant to be
a walking metaphor, conjuring up images of
repression, self-delusion, destructive hero
worship and a host of equally unhealthy
American characteristics.
Stagy
Part of the movie's credibility problems
stem from its inherent staginess. It's been
"opened up" with shots of Southern scen
ery, but most of the action takes place within
the confines of the cafe, which is filmed as if it
was transplanted directly from the stage. The
dialogue sounds like a transplant as well,
ringing false much of the time. Its bloated
ness may have been successful in the theater
but seems merely artificial here.
WYCB,RR is not without its good moments.
Most of the exchanges between Firth and
Stephanie Keracy, a likeable young actress
who gained 30 pounds to play the part of the
cafe's waitress, are blessed with a sense of
humanity. But such moments come only
about as regularly as a television commercial
on network television — and, sadly, they
bear about as little relation to the rest of the
plot.
Confusion
The filmmakers' confusion about their
goals is evident in the movie's ending. After
all the unpleasantness, in the name of alleg
ory, that we watch, we are told it really
doesn't mean anything because of a singu
larly unmotivated happy ending. Perhaps di
rector Milton Katselas and the rest of the
people involved with When You Comin'
Back, Red Ryder suspected that the American
audiences might not be able to accept their
vision of the"truth." With the cynicism that
comes with having one eye on the box office,
they have decided to tell the public what they
think it wants to be told: the Vietnam war
affected only the isolated crazy but left the
good in heart unscathed.
