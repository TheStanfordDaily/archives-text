# Books, books, books
## 
### 
The Daily will be running
book issues periodically
throughout the rest of the year.
Books of all types, from
bestsellers to scholarly works
will be reviewed. Don't even
feel bad about reading science
fiction. Comic books, poems
â€” it's all up to you.
One area which we think de
serves special attention is

books by University profes
sors. We don't expect you to
review textbooks on linear
algebra. But we would like to
find out a little about what goes
on behind the scenes. Inter
views with University authors,
for instance, would be approp
riate.
Form is a matter of your
taste. Be creative.

And call us. Ask for
Catherine Austin, our book re
view editor, at 497-4632. If she's
not there, feel free to talk to
either Julie Knier or Ron Lil
le jo rd, the entertainment
editors. They'll tell you the
basic rules we work with.
We want your ideas and your
writing. Remember that the
next time you pick up a book.
