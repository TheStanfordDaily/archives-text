Cabinet ponders Begin's participation
lerusalem — Israel's Cabinet meets today to decide whether
Prime Minister Menachem Begin will accept a U.S. invitation to
a Mideastconference which Egyptian President Anwar Sadat is
skipping.
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan flew in from Washington yes
terday night to attend the Crucial session.
Some Israeli leaders have voiced doubts that Sadat's rep
resentative, Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil, would have the
power to make decisions at a summit and said they feared the
meeting could lead to pressuring Israel alone on issues block
ing a peace treaty.
In Washington, White House press secretary )ody Powell,
pressed on the issue, said Khalil "has been given, and has had,
the full authority to negotiate and conclude a peace treaty.''
Sadat kept mum on why he decided to send Khalil to Camp
David. He toured a petroleum refinery and cement plant in
Alexandria, Egypt yesterday and avoided reporters.
One of the president's aides said Sadat should not be ex
pected to "do everything" and that it was fitting for Khalil to
represent Egypt since both he and Begin are prime ministers.
Iranian crisis causes oil shortages
Oil shortages and higher prices caused by the crisis in Iran
continue to plague the United States, with some airlines cancel
ing flights and Venezuela raising the price of oil.
Although Iran had supplied only about five percent of the
United States' oil, the loss has tightened supplies of several
types of fuel.
Trans World and National airlines said yesterday they had
canceled some flights because of shortages of jet fuel.
Gasoline supplies continued to be affected by political tur
moil in Iran. Atlantic Richfield joined several other oil com
panies yesterday in limiting the amount of gasoline it sells to
dealers.
The Energy Department denied reports that the Carter ad
ministration was preparing a gasoline-rationing plan that would
limit motorists to two gallons a day. The department has said,
however, that it was considering asking gasoline stations to
close on Sundays.
Woodcock confirmed as ambassador
Washington — The Senate voted overwhelmingly yesterday
to confirm Leonard Woodcock as President Jimmy Carter's
choice to become the first U.S. ambassador to mainland China
since 1949.

The 82-9 vote followed a brief, unsuccessful floor protest
organized by Senate Republicans against Carter's China
policies.
Woodcock is to be installed Thursday in Peking, where he
has headed the U.S. liaison mission for the past two years.
There had been some speculation Senate conservatives might
try to block a vote.
But after a few hours yesterday it became clear there was
insufficient support to use the nomination as a vehicle for
sustained opposition to Carter's shift in policy.
A Senate filibuster beyond Thursday would have meant a
major embarrassment for the president and his policy of ex
tending diplomatic recognition to China while ending formal
ties with Taiwan.
Foreigners held, oil flow to resume
Tehran, Iran — Islamic revolutionaries arrested an American,
a Belgian and two Britons employed by an oil-drilling company,
a company spokesman reported. British officials said the men
were questioned and then released.
The company spokesman said the four were detained yester
day on charges of "plundering the wealth of Iran by charging
exorbitant prices."
In another development Hassan Nazih, new director of the
National Iranian Oil Co., said Iran would resume oil exports
next week but did not say exactly when or in what amounts.
Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan told Robert MacNeil of pub
lic television's MacNeil-Lehrer Report that exports would start
in about two months to any country except Israel willing to pay
the price. He said exports would eventually reach 50 to 60
percent of the pre-revolution level of 5.4 million barrels a day.
There was speculation some Iranian oil sold on the "spot"
market, which does not involve long-term contracts, could
bring up to $24 a barrel, about $10 a barrel more than the official
price of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
There are few details on the reported arrests. The American
Embassy said it knew nothing of the matter and spokesmen for
Iran's new government declined to comment.
Severe storms batter much of U.S.
The relentless winter of '79 pounded America's midsection
yesterday, spreading, knee-deep snow and spilling 112 loodwaters
into many areas from Missouri to New England.
On the day the sun blinked, to the thrill of thousands of
eclipse-watchers gathered in the Pacific Northwest, residents
of southeast Missouri and parts of Arkansas was digging out
from under their worst snowstorm in 60 years.
National Guardsmen were mobilized in several states for

rescue work, and at least six deaths were blamed on the storm.
Hundreds of schools were closed and power lines were tum
bled by ice, snow and freezing rains from Ohio to New York
State.
Flash floods were expected in parts of New York, New jersey,
western Pennsylvania and most of Ohio.
Snow fell across a large part of the Appalachians, the lower
Great Lakes and western New England, with rain coming down
from North Carolina and Virginia through Pennsylvania into
southern New England.
Illinois Gov. lames Thompson declared 30 counties in the
southern part of the state snow emergency areas and activated
National Guard units, mainly to aid an estimated 2000 motorists
stranded on highways.
Governors differ on budget amendment
Washington — The nation s governors moved yesterday to
reaffirm their support for a balanced budget, but rejected a
tougher stand urged on them by California Gov. )erry Brown,
who warned that the country is going "down the road of the
printing press."
Aware that he lacked the votes to get the National Governors'
Association to endorse a budget-balancing amendment to the
Constitution, Brown pressed for creation of a committee "to
evaluate the implications of amending the Constitution."
That, too. failed and the governor's Committee on Fiscal
Affairs voted to affirm stands taken last year supporting efforts
to balance the federal budget by Sept. 30, 1981.
Pressure for a balanced federal budget was the dominant
issue at the winter meeting of the National Governors' Associa
tion under way within a few blocks of the Capitol.

Cabinet ponders Begin's participation
lerusalem — Israel's Cabinet meets today to decide whether
Prime Minister Menachem Begin will accept a U.S. invitation to
a Mideastconference which Egyptian President Anwar Sadat is
skipping.
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan flew in from Washington yes
terday night to attend the Crucial session.
Some Israeli leaders have voiced doubts that Sadat's rep
resentative, Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil, would have the
power to make decisions at a summit and said they feared the
meeting could lead to pressuring Israel alone on issues block
ing a peace treaty.
In Washington, White House press secretary )ody Powell,
pressed on the issue, said Khalil "has been given, and has had,
the full authority to negotiate and conclude a peace treaty.''
Sadat kept mum on why he decided to send Khalil to Camp
David. He toured a petroleum refinery and cement plant in
Alexandria, Egypt yesterday and avoided reporters.
One of the president's aides said Sadat should not be ex
pected to "do everything" and that it was fitting for Khalil to
represent Egypt since both he and Begin are prime ministers.
Iranian crisis causes oil shortages
Oil shortages and higher prices caused by the crisis in Iran
continue to plague the United States, with some airlines cancel
ing flights and Venezuela raising the price of oil.
Although Iran had supplied only about five percent of the
United States' oil, the loss has tightened supplies of several
types of fuel.
Trans World and National airlines said yesterday they had
canceled some flights because of shortages of jet fuel.
Gasoline supplies continued to be affected by political tur
moil in Iran. Atlantic Richfield joined several other oil com
panies yesterday in limiting the amount of gasoline it sells to
dealers.
The Energy Department denied reports that the Carter ad
ministration was preparing a gasoline-rationing plan that would
limit motorists to two gallons a day. The department has said,
however, that it was considering asking gasoline stations to
close on Sundays.
Woodcock confirmed as ambassador
Washington — The Senate voted overwhelmingly yesterday
to confirm Leonard Woodcock as President Jimmy Carter's
choice to become the first U.S. ambassador to mainland China
since 1949.

The 82-9 vote followed a brief, unsuccessful floor protest
organized by Senate Republicans against Carter's China
policies.
Woodcock is to be installed Thursday in Peking, where he
has headed the U.S. liaison mission for the past two years.
There had been some speculation Senate conservatives might
try to block a vote.
But after a few hours yesterday it became clear there was
insufficient support to use the nomination as a vehicle for
sustained opposition to Carter's shift in policy.
A Senate filibuster beyond Thursday would have meant a
major embarrassment for the president and his policy of ex
tending diplomatic recognition to China while ending formal
ties with Taiwan.
Foreigners held, oil flow to resume
Tehran, Iran — Islamic revolutionaries arrested an American,
a Belgian and two Britons employed by an oil-drilling company,
a company spokesman reported. British officials said the men
were questioned and then released.
The company spokesman said the four were detained yester
day on charges of "plundering the wealth of Iran by charging
exorbitant prices."
In another development Hassan Nazih, new director of the
National Iranian Oil Co., said Iran would resume oil exports
next week but did not say exactly when or in what amounts.
Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan told Robert MacNeil of pub
lic television's MacNeil-Lehrer Report that exports would start
in about two months to any country except Israel willing to pay
the price. He said exports would eventually reach 50 to 60
percent of the pre-revolution level of 5.4 million barrels a day.
There was speculation some Iranian oil sold on the "spot"
market, which does not involve long-term contracts, could
bring up to $24 a barrel, about $10 a barrel more than the official
price of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
There are few details on the reported arrests. The American
Embassy said it knew nothing of the matter and spokesmen for
Iran's new government declined to comment.
Severe storms batter much of U.S.
The relentless winter of '79 pounded America's midsection
yesterday, spreading, knee-deep snow and spilling 112 loodwaters
into many areas from Missouri to New England.
On the day the sun blinked, to the thrill of thousands of
eclipse-watchers gathered in the Pacific Northwest, residents
of southeast Missouri and parts of Arkansas was digging out
from under their worst snowstorm in 60 years.
National Guardsmen were mobilized in several states for

rescue work, and at least six deaths were blamed on the storm.
Hundreds of schools were closed and power lines were tum
bled by ice, snow and freezing rains from Ohio to New York
State.
Flash floods were expected in parts of New York, New jersey,
western Pennsylvania and most of Ohio.
Snow fell across a large part of the Appalachians, the lower
Great Lakes and western New England, with rain coming down
from North Carolina and Virginia through Pennsylvania into
southern New England.
Illinois Gov. lames Thompson declared 30 counties in the
southern part of the state snow emergency areas and activated
National Guard units, mainly to aid an estimated 2000 motorists
stranded on highways.
Governors differ on budget amendment
Washington — The nation s governors moved yesterday to
reaffirm their support for a balanced budget, but rejected a
tougher stand urged on them by California Gov. )erry Brown,
who warned that the country is going "down the road of the
printing press."
Aware that he lacked the votes to get the National Governors'
Association to endorse a budget-balancing amendment to the
Constitution, Brown pressed for creation of a committee "to
evaluate the implications of amending the Constitution."
That, too. failed and the governor's Committee on Fiscal
Affairs voted to affirm stands taken last year supporting efforts
to balance the federal budget by Sept. 30, 1981.
Pressure for a balanced federal budget was the dominant
issue at the winter meeting of the National Governors' Associa
