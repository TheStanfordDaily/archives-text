# Sabbaticals kill classes at Hopkins

Sabbatical leaves forced the Uni
versity's Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove to cancel some classes
this quarter, according to judy
Thompson, academic secretary for
the station.
There were not enough professors
to teach because two professors re
quested sabbaticals for this quarter
to pursue research on the Monterey
Bay Aquarium Project.
Robin Burnett and Charles Baxter,
both lecturers at the station, are now
aiding in the planning and construc
tion of the proposed marinj
aquarium on the Hovden property, a
holding of the University.
The suspension of classes is tem
porary. Classes will resume as usual
in the spring, according to
Thompson.
Thompson said that two classes are
still being held. Both involve indi
vidual research for undergraduate
and graduate students.
"We had planned to have all the
classes which were scheduled for
this quarter, but we didn't have
enough professors to teach them,"
she said.
Four classes are included in a full
schedule for the fall and winter quar
ters at the station, requiring a staff of
eight professors.
