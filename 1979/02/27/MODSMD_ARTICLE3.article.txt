# Failure rate rises on medical board exam
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Of 71 Stanford Medical School
students who took the National
Board Examinations this year, 37 per
cent failed the first part of the exam,
Dr. John Steward, associate dean for
student affairs at the Medical School
said yesterday.
Passing both parts of the National
Board Examinations is required for
the medical degree here, Steward
said.
Part I of the test examines students
for their knowledge in the basic sci
ences. Part II tests students' clinical
science knowledge. In 1977 27 per
cent of the students here who took
the test failed Part I. In 1972 12 per
cent failed it.
Steward said performance on Part
II for Stanford students has been re
latively constant since 1974, but was
higher before that year.
The 1978 mean scores of med stu
dents here were in the 54th percen
tile on Part I and the 63rd percentile
on Part 11.
He added that the recent pro
nounced downward trend in student
scores on Part I began several years
ago. "It isn't unique to Stanford,
though I haven't seen data from

otherschools to which we frequently
compare ourselves," Steward said.
Steward said "the quality of stu
dents we've been admitting is as
high, if not higher, than those we've
accepted in the past. They're as good
as ever."
The reasons for the decline are
complex and hard to diagnose, Ste
ward said. "Students seem to feel
that these exams just aren't that im
portant for what they want to do."
For example, students may see fa
culty evaluations of clinical perfor
mance as more important forgaining
admission to clinical training prog
rams after graduation, Steward said.

Remedies to the problem of the
increasing number of exam failures
have not yet been sought, according
to Steward. "We won't know what
kinds of remedies to use until we've
diagnosed the disease. We want to
find a good treatment," he said.
In upcoming weeks, faculty and
staff at the Med School will be cor
relating performance on the exam
with courses taken, Steward said.
The Med School Faculty Senate has
expressed concern over the problem
of evaluation of student perfor
mance in recent months. A senate
committee, chaired by Dr. Ruth
Cross, professor of pediatrics, is cur

rently preparing a report detailing
recommendations for improvements
in the evaluation of student perfor
mance while in medical school.
In a preliminary report to the se
nate last Friday, Gross stated that the
majority of the faculty was dissatis
fied with present systems of evaluat
ing student performance in the Med
ical School.
But Cross emphasized the declin
ing performance on National Board
Examinations is not a concern for her
committee.
"We are looking at ways, both ex
ternal and internal of evaluating stu
dents. The National Board Exams are
just one external measure for
evaluating students. It's one we're
cognizant of, but we don't think it
has any dramatic impact on our
committee. We're looking at many
mechanisms for evaluating stu
dents," Cross said.
Improved counseling of students
with marginal performance and bet
ter procedures to inform students of
their progress were among the pos
sible remedies Cross cited for im
proving evaluation methods.
The Gross committee report is ex
pected to be published in several
weeks.
