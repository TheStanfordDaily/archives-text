# Coors boycott 'unfair,' senator says
## Task force may recommend against boycott 
### Nancy Koehn 
ASSU Sen. Ted Cardenswartz, a member of
an ASSU task force sent to investigate working
conditions at the Adolph Coors Co., said yes
terday that he feels the ASSU should "continue
our business with Coors as usual."
Sen. Ron lohnson, also on the task force, said
"I would guess we (the task force) would not be
in favor of a boycott" of Coors.
The entire five-member task force had re
turned home by yesterday after three days of
inspection last week of Coors' plant in Golden,
Colorado and interviews with management,
workers and union officials there.
Not enough support
John Struthers, another senator on the task
force, said he still supports the boycott. "The
boycott is a pressure tactic, and it's important to
keep that pressure (on the company)," but "I
don't see enough support in the senate for a
boycott," he said.
Johnson said that the working conditions at
Coors were "much better than I expected."

Task force member Lauren Saunders said,
"All but one (of the workers the task force
talked to) were pretty happy. They were not
upset that the union was gone, and they
seemed willing to let Coors prove to them that
they don't need the union."
Johnson said, "Coors officials let us do what
ever we wanted. We were allowed to look at
any file or interview any worker."
Boycott unfair
Cardenswartz said, "Personally I don't think
there should be a national boycott. I think it's
unfair against the company."
The task force will present its findings at a
meeting of the ASSU Senate Thursday, accord
ing to johnson. The members will use trans
cripts of taped interviews with workers, Coors
officials and union leaders in their report to the
senate, Cardenswartz said.
The ASSU has substantial dealings with
Coors. Coors advertising has appeared in the
Course Guide and Student Directory. Coors has
also helped sponsor events in conjunction with

Special Events and is involved with the ASSU
recycling project.
The task force's trip to Golden was paid for by
Coors West, the Bay Area distributor for Coors.
The members of the task force arrived at the
Coors brewery Wednesday and were given a
tour, Gardenswartz said. They also met with
public relations officials for the company, he
said.
Union officials
Wednesday evening the task force spoke
with representatives of the AFL-CIO Local 366
which represents striking workers according to
Gardenswartz. Thursday and Friday were spent
interviewing workers, management and union
officials, he said.
lohnson said the report of the task force will
be available "to all students who want to see it."
Eric Miethke, the fifth member of the task
force, who went as a representative of the
Council of Presidents, refused to comment on
the task force's findings.
