### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — Viet
namese troops defending the Red
River Valley corridor to Hanoi held
their ground yesterday against a
three-pronged Chinese armored and
infantry attack, Hanoi radio said.
It claimed Peking's soldiers were
being killed at a rate of 800 a day all
along the border.
China's Vice Premier Teng Hsiao
ping said yesterday the 10-day-old
conflict might end within 10days, but
analysts in Bangkok and elsewhere
expect the Chinese invasion force to
first mount an all-out assault against
Hanoi's troops.
The official Soviet news media
charged that China was massing
troops near its border with Laos for
an invasion of that Vietnamese
dominated country. The report
could not be confirmed.
In a speech in the western Russian
city of Minsk, Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Cromyko reiterated the
Kremlin warning to China to pull out

of Soviet-allied Vietnam "before it is
too late." He said the invasion was
"doomed to failure."
Soviet airlift
A Soviet airlift of military supplies
to Hanoi appeared to be continuing.
Airport sources in Calcutta, India,
said three cargo planes — one Bulga
rian and two Soviet — refueled there
Sunday and yesterday on theirway to
the Vietnamese capital.
A Voice of Vietnam radio broad
cast monitored here claimed Hanoi's
troops had killed more than 2300
Chinese in fighting since Friday at
scattered battlefields along the front.
China, whose troOps are reported
to have penetrated as far as 20 miles
inside Vietnam, has issued few re
ports about the progress of the war.
But lapan's Kyodo news service yes
terday said Peking radio reported
that a Chinese battalion overran five
Vietnamese hilltop positions near
Dong Dang, north of the town of
Lang Son.
Hanoi claims its troops have killed
more than 16,000 Chinese thus far.
Intelligence sources here consider
the figure inflated. The Vietnamese
have not reported thier own casual
ties, and the Chinese have published
no casualty figures.
"Punish" Vietnam
Kyodo news service quoted
Chinese sources as saying Peking
wants to "punish" Vietnam by de
stroying at least one Vietnamese army
division and military bases and artil
lery emplacements near the border.
In Peking a Chinese official told
American reporters yesterday that
China's invasion of Vietnam is not
"that big an issue," and he indicated
Peking's leaders are not concerned
about U.S. criticism of their actions.
"We don't force our views on any

one else," the official said, adding
thaf Vietnam still must be dealt
"some blows" before the fighting
can end.
The official spoke with the repor
ters — who are accompanying U.S.
Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal on his current visit to China
— on the condition that his name not
be used.
Carter's message
There were signs yesterday that
Chinese leaders were annoyed by
Blumenthal's banquet toast Sunday
describing China as the "transgres
sor" in the Indochina war and warn
ing that it could hinder the growth of
U.S.-Chinese relations and risk a
wider conflict. This "message" to the
Chinese was said to have had Presi
dent )immy Carter's endorsement.
An American informant said Blu
menthal may have more to say about
the war in a 90-minute meeting
scheduled for this afternoon with
Teng. "I assume...he will havea mes
sage to communicate" on the fight
ing, the American said.
U.N. proposals welcomed
In an interview yesterday Teng said
he "wholeheartedly welcomed" Un
ited Nations Security Council prop
osals calling for a withdrawal of
Chinese troops from Vietnam and of
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia,
Kyodo reported.
Teng added, "We would not make
that a bargaining condition," appa
rently meaning China might with
draw its forces from Vietnam even if
Vietnam does not pull out of Cam
bodia, Kyodo reported.
In Indochina's other war, in Cam
bodia, guerrillas loyal to the toppled
government of Pol Pot claimed to
have killed at least 264 Vietnamese
soldiers in fighting last week.
