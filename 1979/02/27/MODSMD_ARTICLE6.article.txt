# Artificial Intelligence Lab
## Special lab will move facilities on campus 
### Laurie Bennett 
The Artificial Intelligence Laborat
ory (AIL) will leave its home at 1600
Arastradero Rd. on June 15 to join the
rest of the Computer Science Dept.
in the new Margaret lacks Hall next
to the Psychology Dept. in the Quad.
The move was designed to unite all
of the department in one location.
However, according to AIL Associate
Director Lester Earnest, not all of the
department will be housed in the
Quad.
"Unfortunately the building was
designed for the size of the depart
ment a few years ago," he said. "Now
we don't fit."
Not all of the AlL's 80 salaried
employees will have space in the new
facilities. "We have a tentative floor
plan," said Earnest. "Many of those
who have private offices now will be
doubled up." It is not yet known
where the remaining staff will be lo
cated, he said.
The move may cause problems
with the AlL's computer, a PDP 10.
"It's fairly bulky and some things are
likely to not function" after it is
moved, Earnest said.
"The move will disrupt us for a
week or so. We can't even eat when
the computer is out." The AlL's vend
ing machine is operated by the PDP
10.

AIL staff will be more concerned
about security in the Quad. "We
have an open door policy here," said
Earnest. Current visitors to the AIL
are there because of interest in AIL
research. In the Quad, more persons
are likely to wander through, Earnest
said.
Earnest cited proximity to depart
ment seminars and increased in
teraction with the Computer Science
Dept. as benefits of the move. How
ever, "many people feel there are
more minuses than pluses," he said.
"I am of two minds. I will strongly
miss this environment. It's very
beautiful out here. On the other
hand, the physical proximity of the
seminars on campus will be good."
AIL staff have missed computer sci
ence seminars in the past because of
the travel time to campus.
The fate of the AlL's present
facilities is being considered by the
office of the Vice President for Busi
ness and Einance, Earnest said. Space
in the building not occupied by the
AIL is currently used for long-term
storage. After the AIL vacates, the
University may use the rest of the
building for storage purposes, he
said.
"The University is open to any op
portunity that presents itself to make
the property income-producing,"
said Earnest.
