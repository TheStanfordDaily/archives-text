Naughty, naughty Henry Ford 11. You
should know better. For shame Shirley
Temple Black. A former U.S. ambas
sador to Ghana, and you claim you didn't
know. You too, Richard Hefner? A com
munication professor and chairman of
the Film Rating Board, and you say you'd
never heard?
Well, we'll tell you: public meetings
here at the Universityareentirely public.
For those of you who are totally lost,
let's bring you up to date. All three of the
above-mentioned dignitaries have given
lectures on campus within the last
month. All three lectures were billed as
public lectures which anyone interested
could attend. And there is one other
similarity: in each of the lectures, the
individuals speaking asked for a pcrtion
of their talk to be off-the-record and
thereby not for publication.
We find the action inexcusable. To
even suppose that comments being
made to the general public should not
be comments for publication is contrary
to every principle of press coverage and
free access.
Indeed, historically, the press has
been given a privileged right of access
since it represents the public. The press
is routinely given advance copies of

speeches, speciai admission and inter
views and even access to private affairs,
such as press conferences and briefings.
With requests for off-the-record
comments, these speakers presuppose a
lesser right of access for the press. This is
something we cannot abide.
Furthermore, to be effective this prac
tice presupposes that just as members of
the press will not publish off-the-record
comments, other members of the audi
ence won't mention these comments
later to persons who didn't attend the
meeting. This points out the absurdity
and unfairness of this practice.
Even if the national treatment of the
press were not enough to require free
access to all comments made at public
meetings, there is another factor on
campus. This University has a policy re
quiring free access for everyone, includ
ing the press, to meetings billed as open
to the public. Restrictions in any form
are not allowed.
We support this policy. As a result, we
think it only fair to let the world know
that the Daily will not recognize any re
quests for off-the-record remarks by
anyone speaking at a public meeting
here.
