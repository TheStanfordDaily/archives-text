## Human connection missing 
### 
(First of a series)
After talking for three hours
in the Coffee House with a
close friend some weeks ago, I
was angry. And I did not know
what to do with my anger be
cause its object lived in the
form of Stanford University.
I spent the rest of that even
ing discussing acquaintances
and friends with my friend, and
more pointedly, why she felt
she had too many of the former
and far too few of the latter.
She surprised me with all this,
for I had known her away from
the University as a most em
bracing person.
I asked how someone as
friendly and outgoing as she
could come to feel such sep
aration. A second question,
one raised in psychology class,
also came forcefully to mind:
Could living at Stanford some
how have promoted her feel
ings of isolation?
Since then, I have felt the
strength of Psychology 161:
"The Human Connection:
Shyness, Alienation and Aso
cial States of Existence." I say
strength because this class,
created and taught this quarter
by Prof. Philip Zimbardo, had
confronted me and forced me
into examining issues which I
have passively or fretfully let
slide by for far too long, issues
whose consequence appears
in me as well as in my friend.
Why did I wait until the mid
dle of this quarter to sit down
and talk with two people who
live at the other end of my hall?
I had seen them in the dorm
several times each week since
September, and consistently
passed them by with a dutiful
"hello" or rusty "How's it goin'
today?"
And all the while, I felt I
wanted to know them, yet the
security and ease of "not hav
ing enough time" proved to be
ample excuse. Finally, when

we slid ourselves into a casual
conversation, it grew into a
close discussion, and I found
they felt much as I did. They
had been passing me in the hall
as uncomfortably as I had been
moving by them.
So what is it, this "Human
Connection," which for our
lives binds each of us to each
other, yet which we only selec
tively have the will to test? And
how does the University, as a
living system, contribute to
this tenuous situation?
We live on the Farm for only
four years, a time too short for
us to commit such questions to
the prison of passive accep
tance.
As an example, in surveys
given by Zimbardo over the
past ( five years, a consistent 40
percent of the students re
sponding labeled themselves
as currently shy people. Sur
prising at a university such as
ours, where we usually assume
the students to be outgoing
self-assured individuals? I
think so. Yet what does this
have to do with the University
itself, and why should we be
concerned?
A significant number (28
percent) of the shy report that
they have become more shy
since coming here. And I
thought shyness is supposed
to be something we outgrow in
our maturity. Are people
choosing to be shy, preferring
a reticent stance for its per
ceived virtues? No, many —
over 60 percent — are dis
turbed that they feel shy.
Yet we rarely discuss our col
lective shyness. It is something
that I am, or she is, or you are.
We never venture an explana
tion as to its origin, or else we
quietly assume the source lies
within the person and let the
"host" situation off the analyti
cal hook. And so we treat most
questions of alienation. Out

side of Marxist economics, can
you think of any broad discus
sion of such a problem?
The question of what links
me to you and you to me leads
to more than I can cover. Yet it
lies within reach for each of us
to begin a dialogue of the per
vasive effects of the University
on our social-emotional lives.
lust how does the intellec
tual competition, achievement
ritual and workload affect our
personal relations? Where
does the will or courage to
strengthen the bond that links
us come from? When is it
stifled, and when is it prom
oted here? Can we see Stan
ford as a microcosm of the
forces of alienation that afflict
our entire society?
I will not have accomplished
what I set out to do unless you,
regardless of your conclu
sions, take up such questions,
think and talk about them with
others, maybe with someone
whom you are tired of passing
without taking the time to con
nect with. The time is today —
tomorrow our four years will
be gone.
