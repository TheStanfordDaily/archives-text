The Stanford
locomotives
A letter from Helen Wic ksten
in a recent "Letters to the
editor" (Daily, Feb. 2) column
prompts me to make the fol
lowing suggestion:
Why not adopt the locomo
tive as the University's symbol?
The famous engine, nam< d
"Governor Stanford" and until
1963 housed in the Stanford
Museum, was built in 1863 and
shipped round the Horn to
California where it was put into
service in the construction of
the Central Pacific railroad.
A century after its arrival
here, it was removed from
Stanford — in what some con
sider to have been a replay of
the Great Train Robbery — and
has since languished in stor
age, most recently in a grocery
warehouse in Sacramento.
There are plans to install the
locomotive in a museum in
Sacramento. But this rare, his
toric and beautiful engine is
still the property of the Stan
ford Museum and hence of the

University, and its proper place
is here.
The Museum, members of
the faculty and student body,
and many friends of the Uni
versity have for years encour
aged the University to re-assert
its rights of ownership to this
extremely valuable document
of the state's and the Universi
ty's past.
A more impressive and ap
propriate symbol for the Uni
versity would be difficult to
find. Down with Cardinals and
Griffins (or Griffons or
Grypons), up with the Locomo
tive! And let us ave the
locomotive — threatened by
vandalism and unauthorized
"restoration" work — and
bring it back to the University,
where it belongs by rights of
ownership, tradition and h's
tory.
The Stanford Museum
would like to hear from mem
bers of the University and
community who share our in
terest in this cause.
