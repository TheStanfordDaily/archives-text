THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS
Directed by Gillo Pontecorvo
Gillo Pontecorvo gives a documentary look to
his reconstruction of the Algerian rebellion
against the French between 1954 and 1957. The
Battle of Algiers was filmed with such vigor and
inventiveness that it seems as if the events are
indeed happening for the first time. Although the
director clearly sides with the rebels, the film's
unflinching depiction of terrorism and violence is
a comment on the terrible force that history
exerts over men.
