According to Business School Prof.
Charles Horngren, it is unlikely the
Graduate School of Business will have a
new dean by July 1, due to the complex
ity of the search committee's task.
Prof. Horngren does not exaggerate.
Arjay Miller's sudden announcement
a month ago that he will be resigning as
dean this summer — two years earlier
than expected — came as a surprise to
most. The 10 years the former president
of Ford Motor Co. spent as dean have
been ones of remarkable achievement,
crowned by a number-one rating among
the nation's business schools for the
past five years.
The success of Miller's tenure as dean
is due not only to his talents as an ad
ministrator but as an educational in
novator as well. Not only has the physi
cal size of the school and the number of
faculty and students grown, but there
has been a substantial rise in the enroll
ment of women and minoriti3S.
Moreover, the Business School has con
sciously oriented itself toward social
problems and ethics and has been wil

ling to introduce new programs like the
now nationally recognized public man
agement program.
It is clear that the search committee
faces a formidable task. Vet at the same
time it is imperative that the Business
School not be content with the progress
that the school has made under Miller's
leadership.
As Miller himself acknowledged re
cently, there are still not enough women
and minority students enrolled in the
Business School. The proportion of
these groups among the faculty is even
smaller. And as controversy over in
vestment in South Africa and the growth
of the nuclear power industry indicate,
new social issues continue to prolifer
ate. They require new and innovative re
sponses from the schools that train our
business leaders.

We hope that the search committee
can find a candidate with qualities equal
to the task — qualities that Arjay Miller
has amply demonstrated over the last
decade.
