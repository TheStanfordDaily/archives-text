Anatoly Shcharansky, 31, a Russian
Jewish computer scientist, is now serv
ing the first year of a 13-year sentence at
hard labor for the "crime" of anti-Soviet
propaganda. During the 16 months he
was held incommunicado in prison and
during his trial last year, he was a cause
celebre in the Western press, a symbol
of the plight of Jews and other dissident
groups in the Soviet Union. Today he is
largely forgotten.
Shcharansky's imprisonment on
trumped-up charges was not merely
another case of Soviet harassment of a
Jew who had applied to emigrate to Is
rael. Shcharansky was publicly prose
cuted to provide a pointed example to
every dissident in the Soviet Union.
Shcharansky had not only been active
as a Jew denied the right of emigration,
but had become a highly visible focal
point for many different dissident
groups. He helped organize one group
to monitor human rights in the Soviet

Union and frequently served as a contact
and translator for many groups and the
Western press.
By the time of his arrest in 1977,
Shcharansky was no longer merely a re
fusenik, but an internationally recog
nized symbol of Soviet oppression. To
the Russians he was a dangerous man
who had to be silenced.
Today at noon in White Plaza Avital
Shcharansky will be speaking on behalf
of her husband whom she has not seen
since the day they were married five
years ago. We urge everyone to attend.
Shcharansky and the Soviet dissident
movement should not be forgotten
merely for the lack of a spectacular trial.
The lack of headlines does not signal the
disappearance of the freedom they are
still struggling for. A large rally today
won't free Shcharansky, but as an act of
moral witness and solidarity it will re
mind a wide audience that the struggle is
not yet over.
