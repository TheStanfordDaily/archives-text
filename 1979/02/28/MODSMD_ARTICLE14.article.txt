## Sweet writer disturbing 
### 
Writer Susan Griffin musses
her straight, blond, short,
banged hair when she think
speaks. Two black-rimmed cir
cles for glasses, grey-blue
blazer and sand-colored pants,
she's a socialist now. But she
had been a Marxist, she re
vealed after her noon lecture,
Wednesday in Terman.
She attracted a good crowd
and seemed popular. Her
voice rolled over her written
words rhythmically. One
woman I was sitting with in the
Coffee House afterwards re
marked on her wonderful
sweetness in addition to her
ability to say "true things."
I felt the odd woman out,
what did I not like about Grif
fin?
Mirror against mirror, fight

ing cultural types of women,
reading out of her new book
Women in Nature - the roaring
inside her, Griffin's reader
voice did impress me, rolling
out from down inside her.
It was her non-reader voice
resonating from the mask of
her nose and forehead that
bothered me. There she was
explaining in a voice that re
minded me of the pleading
sweet-pleasing voices I can't
stand in some women that now
have become culturally ac
ceptable in men.
The irony I thought, as I re
gistered the enthusiasm from
the people around me, for the
fashionable content and the
old-fashioned feminine sen
tences punctuated with the
did-l-please-you smile. Yes,

she was sweet.
It was the discrepancy in
C.riffin's two voices that
triggered me. Standing in front
of the Coffee House, a man
told me that I had to show a
little weakness to be huggable.
The vulnerability that some
times shows itself on my face is
not an indication of inner
weakness. I stared at him and
replied that I was strong;
should I pose as weak in order
to get a hug?
Inside the Coffee House I
heard a man from the Ivory
Coast warn a young woman
that the more elitist schooling
she got, the more unap
proachable she would become
— she should marry now be
fore she got her Ph.D. in
Physics. The great-looking

woman, at ease, laughed.
But I muddled in my double
expresso: was it real that the
more non-sexual,
traditionally-man's power a
woman had, the more unap
proachable she was to a man?
Or was it just that I did indeed
have bad breath or wear the
wrong cologne; should I paint
my nails red? Or should I just
be sweeter?
Again, I thought about Grif
fin. What her voice really
sounded like had now left my
objective mind. I labeled her
secondary voice "the good
daughter voice" and mused
about how much of women's
writing is obsessed with break
ing open the script between a
mother and her child.
This weekend, I went home
to Mother. Mother attended
the Stanford Conference on
Sunday in Los Angeles. She re
ported that a couple of people
had come up commenting that
her daughter had a column in
the school newspaper. She
suggested that I best be cauti
ous about what I wrote since
not just students but mothers
and fathers of students read
the Daily, too.
Mom, I'm afraid of being
embarassed by my voice, too.
Part of me is afraid my writing
voice won't be a good daugh
ter's voice.
Funny, I could understand
how Griffin's secondary voice
could be like that.
My brother bends over my
shoulder as I am writing this —
he says I should be writing
about the "resurgence of
super-heroes in America on
T.V." I think he's right. I check
myself and find yes, I am
hopelessly steeped in Doris
Lessing and lames Joyce and
am vexed that I just see myself
as a type.
This adult education:
perhaps it'll pass like the
mumps.
A heavy dose of television
might fix that, my brother
would quip.

about how much of women's
writing is obsessed with break
ing open the script between a
mother and her child.
This weekend, I went home
to Mother. Mother attended
the Stanford Conference on
Sunday in Los Angeles. She re
ported that a couple of people
had come up commenting that
her daughter had a column in
the school newspaper. She
suggested that I best be cauti
ous about what I wrote since
not just students but mothers
and fathers of students read
the Daily, too.
Mom, I'm afraid of being
embarassed by my voice, too.
Part of me is afraid my writing
voice won't be a good daugh
ter's voice.
Funny, I could understand
how Griffin's secondary voice
could be like that.
My brother bends over my
shoulder as I am writing this —
he says I should be writing
about the "resurgence of
super-heroes in America on
T.V." I think he's right. I check
myself and find yes, I am
hopelessly steeped in Doris
Lessing and lames Joyce and
am vexed that I just see myself
as a type.
This adult education:
perhaps it'll pass like the
mumps.
A heavy dose of television
might fix that, my brother
would quip.

Writer Susan Griffin musses
her straight, blond, short,
banged hair when she think
speaks. Two black-rimmed cir
cles for glasses, grey-blue
blazer and sand-colored pants,
she's a socialist now. But she
had been a Marxist, she re
vealed after her noon lecture,
Wednesday in Terman.
She attracted a good crowd
and seemed popular. Her
voice rolled over her written
words rhythmically. One
woman I was sitting with in the
Coffee House afterwards re
marked on her wonderful
sweetness in addition to her
ability to say "true things."
I felt the odd woman out,
what did I not like about Grif
fin?
Mirror against mirror, fight

ing cultural types of women,
reading out of her new book
Women in Nature - the roaring
inside her, Griffin's reader
voice did impress me, rolling
out from down inside her.
It was her non-reader voice
resonating from the mask of
her nose and forehead that
bothered me. There she was
explaining in a voice that re
minded me of the pleading
sweet-pleasing voices I can't
stand in some women that now
have become culturally ac
ceptable in men.
The irony I thought, as I re
gistered the enthusiasm from
the people around me, for the
fashionable content and the
old-fashioned feminine sen
tences punctuated with the
did-l-please-you smile. Yes,

she was sweet.
It was the discrepancy in
C.riffin's two voices that
triggered me. Standing in front
of the Coffee House, a man
told me that I had to show a
little weakness to be huggable.
The vulnerability that some
times shows itself on my face is
not an indication of inner
weakness. I stared at him and
replied that I was strong;
should I pose as weak in order
to get a hug?
Inside the Coffee House I
heard a man from the Ivory
Coast warn a young woman
that the more elitist schooling
she got, the more unap
proachable she would become
— she should marry now be
fore she got her Ph.D. in
Physics. The great-looking

woman, at ease, laughed.
But I muddled in my double
expresso: was it real that the
more non-sexual,
traditionally-man's power a
woman had, the more unap
proachable she was to a man?
Or was it just that I did indeed
have bad breath or wear the
wrong cologne; should I paint
my nails red? Or should I just
be sweeter?
Again, I thought about Grif
fin. What her voice really
sounded like had now left my
objective mind. I labeled her
secondary voice "the good
daughter voice" and mused
about how much of women's
writing is obsessed with break
ing open the script between a
mother and her child.
This weekend, I went home
to Mother. Mother attended
the Stanford Conference on
