## Senate can be effective 
### 
The ASSU Senate has been criticized lately
for its apparent inability to steer clear of con
troversial outside issues. The AM Bhutto trial,
medical center billing practices and the
Coors issue have come to symbolize the se
nate's ineffectual dabbling in external mat
ters.
Several senators have recognized the mis
direction of these ventures and have attemp
ted to get back to basics as we pledged in the
October campaign. We realize that the se
nate has spent too much time on the
issues lately, culminating in the questionable
gesture of sending a senate task force to Gol
den, Colo, to investigate the Coors labor dis
pute. (Indicentally, the trip was at Coors' ex
pense.)
The point of this letter is that while the
senate has taken hasty and ill-considered ac
tion in the realm of world affairs, it has by no
means neglected important issues here on
campus.
Controversial political issues may make
good Daily headlines, but how many stu
dents are aware that :
— the senate is attempting to overturn the
bottle ban at the stadium;
— has established a task force on Con
sumer Affairs to improve the quality of etail
services to students on campus;
— is working with the Department of Pub
lic Safety to curb theft during vacation;
— is consulting with the University on
plans for the new dormitory;

— has established procedures forselection
of a mascot;
— and is working towards lighting tennis
courts on campus. These are only a few of our
current projects.
When elections for the student senate
were held in October, many students re
minded us that while prospective senators
actively seek out students during the cam
paign, they are rarely seen during the rest of
the year.
This year, we have sought to reverse this
pattern by dividing the campus into informal
districts and attending house meetings in
order to tell you what we've been up to and to
get your opinion on business we are consid
ering. The senate is working on election re
forms which could formalize these districts.
Perhaps most importantly, the senate has
been quietly carrying out its constitutional
responsibility to manage ASSU financial af
fairs and oversee nominations for the com
mittee system. The past few senates could
not make this claim.
The senate's concrete achievements may
be modest, but we believe our record indi
cates that a student senate here can be an
effective group that concerns itself with
problems that students encounter in their
daily lives.

Brett Kingstone and George Drysdale are
members of the ASSU Senate.)
