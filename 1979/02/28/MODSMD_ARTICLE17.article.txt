## Gays denied freedom, equality 
### 
"lt's very difficult for me to
equate the rights of homosex
uals with the rights of blacks and
browns."
Such were the words of state
Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-
Whittier) on Feb. 14 as he
provided the swing vote to de
feat a state Senate bill to pro
hibit job discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
The bill would have made it
illegal for an employer to fire,
demote or refuse to hire
someone merely because the
employer discovered the per
son was a homosexual (or
heterosexual, for that matter).
It's obvious that Montoya, a
Chicano, does not believe in
equal protection under the law
for all citizens. Apparently he
feels that only ethnic
minorities deserve such pro
tection.
By refusing to "equate" the
rights of gays with those of
blacks and browns Montoya
completely subverts the con
cept of equal rights for all
human beings.
Most people agree that the
United States was founded on
the ideals of freedom and
democratic equality for all citi

zens. If everyone lived by these
ideals, there would be no prob
lem. However, the real, unfair
discrimination against certain
groups has necessitated specific
equal protection for those op
pressed.
According to state Sen. John
Briggs (R-Fullerton), who ar
gued against the bill, "there is
no discrimination against
homosexuals. They were just
seeking special privileges."
This sounds ironic coming
from the man whose Proposi
tion 6 attempted to ban
teachers who are gay or sup
portive of homosexuality.
Every day gay people are
fired, not hired, promoted or
denied "security clearances"
simply because they are gay,
but these instances are hard to
document for several reasons.
First, the instances are unpub-
Ijcized because in the few
cases that have gone to court,
gays have generally lost.
For example, James Caylord,
a high school teacher in
Tacoma, Washington, was
fired after 12 years at the same
school when he admitted his
homosexuality under ques
tioning by an administrator.
Until that time, his lifestyle had
been a secret and his teaching
evaluations had been un
iformly favorable. The
Washington Supreme Court
ruled in favor of the dismissal,
based on Gaylord's "immoral
ity," and the U.S. Supreme
Court let the decision stand by
refusing to hear the appeal.
In military cases, both Air
Force Sgt. Leonard Matlovich
and Navy Ensign Vernon Berg
were discharged when their
sexual orientations were dis

covered. Courts upheld the
discharges, although a recent
appeal ruled that the Air Force
must reconsider Matlovich's
case.
In addition to court defeats,
serious consequences of fight
ing discrimination as an open
homosexual prevent gay
people from doing so. Con
sequences include possible re
jection by family and friends,
public harassment, emotional
stress and damage to careers.
Gaylord, for example, now
works as a secretary.
As a result, gays have been
forced to hide their lifestyles
from their employers and co
workers in fear of losing their
jobs or suffering harassment.
This means having to remain
quiet or lie about whom they
livewith and love, what they do
with their free time and how
they feel about certain issues.
It means fear of being seen
with certain people or at cer
tain establishments. It means a
socially constructed, oppres
sive situation in which the per
son does not have the freedom
to live his or her life openly.
This lack of freedom is the
real, everyday kind of "dis
crimination" gay people face.
Discrimination against gay
people is unfair because a per
son's sexual orientation (li
mited to behavior between
consenting adults in private)
has nothing to do with how
well that person can do the job
and is of no business to the
employer. Such discrimination
is inhumane and a threat to
freedom and equality
Largely due to legislative ef
forts, San Francisco is relatively
free of anti-gay discrimination,

but in smaller cities, suburbs
and rural areas, discrimination
is still a problem. Even here,
most gay faculty, staff and stu
dents are afraid of "coming
out."
Statewide protection is
needed and would be sup
ported by the people of
California, judging from the
resounding defeat of Proposi
tion 6.
A bill which is similar to the
Senate bill has a good chance
of passing in the Assembly.
FHowever, the Senate commit
tee will refuse to consider it un
less a member changes his
mind about the issue. A provi
sion which prohibits discrimi
nation because of one's "re
fusal to grant sexual favors" is
also included in the bill.
The bill would require rela
tively few funds to facilitate it if
it were passed. "Frivolous"
cases clogging the courts
would not be a result for two
reasons: 1) every complaint is
investigated to make sure it has
merit before it goes to court,
and 2) the passage of the bill
would not nullify all of socie
ty's prejudices nor significantly
remove the stigma from being
gay. The serious consequences
of "going public" would pre
vent most frivolous cases.
Furthermore, "overt sexual
conduct" on the job would not
be protected by the law.
Such legislation would allow
gay people the freedom to live
openly and with dignity be
cause they would have a
specific legal recourse to fall
back on when treated unjustly.

Largely due to legislative ef
forts, San Francisco is relatively
free of anti-gay discrimination,

but in smaller cities, suburbs
and rural areas, discrimination
is still a problem. Even here,
most gay faculty, staff and stu
dents are afraid of "coming
out."
Statewide protection is

resounding defeat of Proposi

A bill which is similar to the
Senate bill has a good chance
of passing in the Assembly.
FHowever, the Senate commit
tee will refuse to consider it un
less a member changes his
mind about the issue. A provi
sion which prohibits discrimi
nation because of one's "re
fusal to grant sexual favors" is
also included in the bill.
The bill would require rela
tively few funds to facilitate it if
it were passed. "Frivolous"
cases clogging the courts
would not be a result for two
reasons: 1) every complaint is
investigated to make sure it has
merit before it goes to court,
and 2) the passage of the bill
would not nullify all of socie
ty's prejudices nor significantly
remove the stigma from being
gay. The serious consequences
of "going public" would pre
vent most frivolous cases.
Furthermore, "overt sexual
conduct" on the job would not
be protected by the law.
Such legislation would allow
gay people the freedom to live
openly and with dignity be
cause they would have a
specific legal recourse to fall
back on when treated unjustly.

"lt's very difficult for me to
equate the rights of homosex
uals with the rights of blacks and
browns."
Such were the words of state
Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-
Whittier) on Feb. 14 as he
provided the swing vote to de
feat a state Senate bill to pro
hibit job discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
The bill would have made it
illegal for an employer to fire,
demote or refuse to hire
someone merely because the
employer discovered the per
son was a homosexual (or
heterosexual, for that matter).
It's obvious that Montoya, a
Chicano, does not believe in
equal protection under the law
for all citizens. Apparently he
feels that only ethnic
minorities deserve such pro
tection.
By refusing to "equate" the
rights of gays with those of
blacks and browns Montoya
completely subverts the con
cept of equal rights for all
human beings.
Most people agree that the
United States was founded on
the ideals of freedom and
democratic equality for all citi

zens. If everyone lived by these
ideals, there would be no prob
lem. However, the real, unfair
discrimination against certain
groups has necessitated specific
equal protection for those op
pressed.
According to state Sen. John
Briggs (R-Fullerton), who ar
gued against the bill, "there is
no discrimination against
homosexuals. They were just
seeking special privileges."
This sounds ironic coming
from the man whose Proposi
tion 6 attempted to ban
teachers who are gay or sup
portive of homosexuality.
Every day gay people are
fired, not hired, promoted or
denied "security clearances"
simply because they are gay,
but these instances are hard to
document for several reasons.
First, the instances are unpub-
Ijcized because in the few
cases that have gone to court,
gays have generally lost.
For example, James Caylord,
a high school teacher in
Tacoma, Washington, was
fired after 12 years at the same
school when he admitted his
homosexuality under ques
tioning by an administrator.
Until that time, his lifestyle had
been a secret and his teaching
evaluations had been un
iformly favorable. The
Washington Supreme Court
ruled in favor of the dismissal,
based on Gaylord's "immoral
ity," and the U.S. Supreme
Court let the decision stand by
refusing to hear the appeal.
In military cases, both Air
Force Sgt. Leonard Matlovich
and Navy Ensign Vernon Berg
were discharged when their
sexual orientations were dis

covered. Courts upheld the
discharges, although a recent
appeal ruled that the Air Force
must reconsider Matlovich's
case.
In addition to court defeats,
serious consequences of fight
ing discrimination as an open
homosexual prevent gay
people from doing so. Con
sequences include possible re
jection by family and friends,
public harassment, emotional
stress and damage to careers.
Gaylord, for example, now
works as a secretary.
As a result, gays have been
forced to hide their lifestyles
from their employers and co
workers in fear of losing their
jobs or suffering harassment.
This means having to remain
quiet or lie about whom they
livewith and love, what they do
with their free time and how
they feel about certain issues.
It means fear of being seen
with certain people or at cer
tain establishments. It means a
socially constructed, oppres
sive situation in which the per
son does not have the freedom
to live his or her life openly.
This lack of freedom is the
real, everyday kind of "dis
crimination" gay people face.
Discrimination against gay
people is unfair because a per
son's sexual orientation (li
mited to behavior between
consenting adults in private)
has nothing to do with how
well that person can do the job
and is of no business to the
employer. Such discrimination
is inhumane and a threat to
freedom and equality
