Trident
denounced
Eight miles from here, at the
Lockheed plant in Sunnyvale,
the world's most destructive
weapon, the Trident Missile, is
being built. The Trident is a
missile and submarine
weapons system being de
veloped by the U.S. Navy with
first-strike capability.
Its construction would ac
celerate even further the rag
ing arms race and would also
be in violation of international
agreements that the U.S. has
signed, as well as U.N. resolu
tions concerning the de
velopment and manufacture of
nuclear weapons.
The Navy plans to build 30
Trident submarines by 1992, at
a total cost of $180 billion. Each
Trident sub will be almost two
football fields long and about
14 stories high, armed with 24
Trident-2 missiles. Each missile
will carry 17 maneuvering
warheads, each of which can
be sent to a different target.
Thus, one Trident submarine
would be capable of destroy
ing 408 cities with a nuclear
blast five times stronger than
that which devastated
Hiroshima.
According to one columnist
with the Saturday Review,
"next to President Carter and
Secretary Brezhnev, a Trident
submarine commander is the
third most powerful man in the
world. He controls more de
structive force than Great Bri
tain, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Argen
tina, West Germany, japan, the
Philippines, India and Pakistan
together."
On Thursday, March 1, the
Pacific Life Community, a

nationwide group dedicated to
the non-violent conversion of
nuclear weapons plants to
peaceful purposes, is organiz
ing a demonstration against
the Trident at the Lockheed
plant.
One group of people
trained in non-violence will
enter the site carrying a 560-
foot long symbolic representa
tion of a Trident submarine.
Others will be demonstrating
legally outside the premises
starting at 11 a.m. Carpools will

leave Columbae parking lot
from 9:30 a.m. on to take
people to the El Camino bus
stop where we will meet the
bus to Sunnyvale. We urge
everyone to attend and ex
press their opposition to the
Trident Death Missile.
