# Escort program to start Monday
## 
### Robin Millington 
The only way that an escort service
will be effective here is if women un
derstand how to use it, Marvin Her
rington, director of the Department
of Public Safety, told 21 student es
corts at a meeting last night.
The purpose of the meeting was to
educate the escorts on the proce
dures and goals of the service, Her
rington said. Students United for
Rape Elimination (SURE), the escort
group, begins work Monday even
ing, March 5.
Escorts should act "business-like,
so as not to offend women," Her
rington said. "Please don't try and
date the client while you escort her."
Female students, faculty or staff
members may use the service. To get
an escort, a woman must call the es
cort dispatcher at The Bridge when
she wants an escort. The dispatcher
selects an escort to meet the woman
and tells the woman the escort's
name. The escort then meets the
woman and takes her to her desired
location, Herrington said.
The service will operate from 8
p.m. to midnight Sunday to Thurs
day. If successful, the program may

be expanded to operate on
weekends or after midnight. Addi
tional escorts may be added during
prime-time hours, SURE organizer
Ron Lepow said.
All escorts must have bicycles in
order to respond quickly to client re
quests for their services. "One dete
rent to a woman's using the service
and calling an escort is that she may
think she could be home before the
escort gets there, particularly if the
escort has to walk across campus,"
Lepow said.
Lepow, a junior, said approxi
mately 30 escorts are registered to
participate in the program. One of
the escorts is a woman.
Eventually, women may be able to
select a male or female escort. How
ever, until more women enroll to
participate as escorts, this will not be
possible, Lepow said.
Escorts are selected by Lepow. To
be an escort, an individual must be a
student here. A student with a police
record may not participate, Her
rington added.
In addition, all potential escorts
are interviewed by Lepow. "A very

large majority are friends of mine or
close friends of a friend of mine,"
Lepow said.
"If we were just taking all comers I
would have problems with the
method, but restricting it to students
is an adequate precaution in my
opinion," Herrington said.
Herrington told the escorts their
main function is not to fight attackers
but to get women to safety and then
get help if a woman is threatened.
