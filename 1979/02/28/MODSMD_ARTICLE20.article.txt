# Cal gymnasts slip by Cards

### Dean Eyre 
Berkeley — It had all the mak
ings of a smash movie, the
Casey at the Bat of gymnastics.
Stanford, favored to beat
California, is trying to preserve
a slim .35 lead going into the
final event. '
Karen Hall, resting an in
jured knee, comes off the
sideline of Harmon Gym in a
valiant attempt to earn valuable
points on balance beam and
pull out a Cardinal victory.
Unfortunately four judges,
not scriptwriters, had the last

say and California rallied to win
by a 119.10 to 114.60 margin
Sunday night, dropping Stan
ford's regular season mark to
4-5. Hollywood and Berkeley
seemed miles apart as the
dramatic ending fizzled.
Jeanette Lacoste reinjured
her knee warming up for beam
competition and Hall was dis
qualified, for not being offi
cially entered prior to the
meet.
Coach Jackie Walker had
cautioned her gymnasts about
overlooking Cal following the

upset of Arizona State,
coached by Walker's sister,
Marie Bilski.
Stanford responded to the
advice well, butCal wasn't con
tent to play the role of the un
derdog.
The telling difference was
that the Cards had an average
performance even without the
full services of Hall and
Lacoste, but the Golden Bears
scored 10 points above their
previous best.
"The girls did well at Cal,"
Walker commented. "I'm not
disappointed with what they
did, it was just that Cal was
lucky on beam — they didn't
fall. They picked up points
there.
"They actually beat us, we
didn't lose to them. It wasn't
like when Arizona State fell
apart; Stanford did not fall
apart," she added.
Annie Smith captured the
all-around title with a 32.75 to
tal, garnering firsts in vaulting
(8.40), uneven parallel bars
(8.30) and floor exercise (8.65)
and a second on beam with
7.40.
Captain Linda Park finished
fifth in all-around (27.15) and
placed fourth on beam (7.25).
Lacoste earned fourth on bars
(7.40), Cindy Sedlund took
third in vaulting (7.80) and Pilar
Ossorio placed fourth in vault
ing (7.65).
While the team total was av
erage, Walker pointed out that
some of the individual aver
ages were better than that
would indicate.
"Linda stayed on beam for
the first time this year and she
did her best floor," Walker
said. "Cindy did her best vault
of the year.
"It was very disappointing
because I think everybody ex
pected us to win. But after I
thought about all the good
things that we did I wasn't as
disappointed."
Since Stanford was consi
dered the favorite even with
out Hall, the plan was to have

her compete in the Western
Elite Zone Meet at Seattle over
the weekend, then be
sidelined Sunday night.
According to Walker, Hall
had her highest compulsory
score ever in floor exercise,
9.15. "But the most valubale
part of the whole weekend was
the experience — that was very
good for her," Walker said.
"She hasn't seen that level of
competition for a while. Now
she knows what she's up
against if she wants to go elite
this year after our season is
over.
"It really inspired her to
come back here and work even
harder and it was also a very
good recruiting weekend. I got
to see our No. 1 recruit," she
added.
With the regular season now
complete, the Cards are focus
ing on the March 10 Northern
California Athletic Conference
Championships at Harmon
Gym beginning at 7 p.m. In that
meet, Stanford will get its most
important opportunity to un
seat defending champ San
)ose State and Cal.
"We have a few days to work
on some things and then be
ginning next week start
routines again," Walker said.
"We definitely have to be con
sistent — if they're (the new
tricks in the routines) not solid
at the time of the meet, then
we won't put them in. This will
be the most important meet to
hi* in."
Looking back on the just
finished season, sophomore
Julie Love stated, "The benefits
of gymnastics made the
sacrifices in other areas all
worthwhile."
"The loss that we didn't ex
pect to have, against Cal, was
close," reflected sophomore
Park. "I think that shows how
we've improved a lot. The
teams we did get beaten by
were really good — we don't
have anything to be embaras
sed about in losing to the
Arizona schools, San lose State
or Hayward."
