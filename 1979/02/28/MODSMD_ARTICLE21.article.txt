# Card nine beats Santa Clara, 3-2
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The right field of the Univer
sity of Santa Clara's baseball
diamond was six inches under
water yesterday afternoon,
so the scheduled baseball
game between Stanford and
Santa Clara was moved to Stan
ford's well-groomed and dry
Sunken Diamond.
Stanford capitalized on its
acquired home-field advan
tage with a 3-2 victory over the
Broncos, improving its pre
season record to a healthy 13-2
mark.
Yesterday's game was not
the best showing the Cardinals
have made this year — Stan
ford committed four errors
and managed only eight hits —
but the heads and hearts of the
21 players who will be making
the road trip to the University
of Arizona this Thursday, Fri
day and Saturday were proba
bly more in Tucson than in bat
tle with Santa Clara.
Battling was exactly what
Santa Clara had in mind yes
terday, but the Cardinals' good
fundamentals were too tough
to beat.
Stanford had a chance to
score as early as the second in
ning but the failure of a
double-steal attempt foiled the

plan.
Instead, Santa Clara was the
first to break the 0-0 tie and get
on the scoreboard with one
run in the fifth inning.
The run was scored on a
fluke play involving two errors
on Cardinal shortstop Dave
Meier and outfielder Mike
Codiroli. But winning pitcher
Joe LoPresti pitched his way
out of the inning on two strike
outs and a groundout before
the Broncos could score again.
Stanford retaliated with two
runs in the bottom of the fifth
on a two-run single by
Codiroli, who leads the team
with a .510 batting average.
The Cardinals added an in
surance run in the eighth on
two singles, a sacrifice and a
ground out.
Santa Clara battled back in
the top of the ninth with one
run, but senior pitcher Bob
Irwin was able to stifle the rally
and collect the save for Stan
ford.
