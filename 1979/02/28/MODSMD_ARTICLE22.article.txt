# Cardinals outsplash all in invitational meet here

The Stanford womens'
swimming team soundly
crushed the other 15 teams
competing in the Stanford Invi
tational at deGuerre pool
complex last Friday through
Sunday. The Cards won 12 of 23
events and throttled their
closest trailing opponent,
USC, 1095-732.
While convincingly defend
ing their title, the Cardinals
clocked numerous best times
and met AIAW qualifying stan
dards in a myriad of events.
Thus, the meet was fulfilling
from both team and personal
perspectives.
Linda Jezek paved the way
for her team's success, as she
captured first-place honors in
seven of eight individual races.
She matched AIAW times in
every event in which she par
ticipated and proved beyond a
doubt that she is the mainstay
for Stanford's premiere posi

tion in the world of women's
swimming.
lezek effortlessly won three
events in a row on Friday in re
markably fast times. She began
her conquests by recording
her best-ever time in the 100-
yard butterfly, 56.43, to chop to
a win in an event in which she
does not usually compete.
)ezek next assumed the
driver's seat with a clear-cut
victory in the 200 individual
medley in another AIAW mark
of 2:05.46. She finished off the
day in splendid fashion when
she outmoded an AIAW record
with a dazzling 1:59.03 in the
200 backstroke.
Assistant Coach Claudia
Thomas denoted Jezek's per
formance in that race as a "sen
sational early season time,"
and further related that she "is
quite certain that no one else
will be under two minutes be
fore the national champion
ships," to be held in
Pittsburgh, March 15-17.
The freshman sensation con
tinued her mechanistic domi
nance Saturday. She opened
the individual confrontations
by annihilitating all other con
tenders in the 400 IM, one of
the most physically demanding
and diverse events in swim
ming. She took a mere 4:24.0}
seconds to cover the distance
from start to finish and won by
a resounding eight seconds.
The former Santa Clara star
immediately followed up that
preponderance with a 57.02
win in the 100 back, where she
was the only swimmer to break
the one-minute barrier.
lezek did not relent at all on
Sunday in the culmination of
the meet's invigorating action.
She slipped past UCLA's
stand-out, Tauna Van
deweghe, to hit the touch pad
first in 26.99 in the 50 back.
Later she swam two more
consecutive events to conform
to her established image of an
automaton. She rolled to a
close second in the 50 fly
(26.38), which nonetheless
qualified her for the nationals,
and then whetted her insati
able appetite for triumph with
a victory in the 100 IM (59.2).
Although )ezek's leading fi
gure was the most obvious, she
was definitely not the only
Card to excel at the meet.
Tri-captain )o Clark swam the
best time in the nation yet this
year when she fluttered to a
first-place time of 16:45.15 in
the excruciatingly monoton
ous 1650 free. Clark also gar

nered a third in the 500 free in
4:57.50 and won the consola
tion heat of the 200 free in her
fastest time, 1:54.14, which
makes her eligible for the na
tionals in that race.
Noel Moran whippped to a
30.88 win in Friday's 50
breaststroke and gunned to
the nation's fastest 200 breast
(2:20.8) Sunday. She picked up
a third-place finish in the 100
IM (1:00.0) for her fastest time
and an AIAW standard in that
brief amusement.
Libby Beaudet finished third
in thelOO fly (58.13) and third in
the 400 IM in 4:32.%. Mean
while, she compiled her best
time in the 200 IM of 2:09.3,
where she grabbed the third
spot and was second in the
rough 200 fly (2:05.55).
Freshman Maria Pease swam
an outstanding meet. She qual
ified for AIAW competition in
the preliminary heats of the 200
free with her fastest time of
1:54.0. She achieved her best
time and another AIAW stan
dard in the 500 free with
4:59.79 in the prelims and a
subsequent seventh-place
final tally, and accomplished
the exact same result in the 200
fly, where her heat clocking
was 2:06.74. Another best time
and national mark fell at ly>i
feet in the 1650 (17:12.6j).
Pease recorded her fastest WO
fly in 58.49 ticks.
Rose Storm equalled an
AIAW time in the 50 breast with
a third-place £1.85. Peggy Hav
lach and Kayley Vernallis
launched personal bests in that
event as well (32.71 and 31.74
respectively). Haslach racked
up her fastest 200 breast time,
2:26.98, and a sixth place.
Zena Herrmann amassed
best times and AIAW standards
in the 100 back 1:00.14 to win
second place honors. The
200 free (1:54.05) and the 50
back (28.3) were also strong
events for Flerrmann.
Sheri Burlingham placed
fourth in the 50 free, where she
sprinted to a personal record
of 24.80, under the AIAW qual
ifying standard.
Nancy Thompson made the
national time with a 53.14 best
time in the 100 free. Also in the
100, Kim Peyton recovered to
salvage a second (52.09).
The Cards blitzed all teams in
the relay competition, as each
relay attained national qualify
ing times. )ezek, Moran,
Beaudet and Peyton swam to
the fastest time in the nation in
the 200 medley relay with a
1:47.46.

dard in the 500 free with
4:59.79 in the prelims and a
subsequent seventh-place
final tally, and accomplished
the exact same result in the 200
fly, where her heat clocking
was 2:06.74. Another best time
and national mark fell at ly>i
feet in the 1650 (17:12.6j).
Pease recorded her fastest WO
fly in 58.49 ticks.
Rose Storm equalled an
AIAW time in the 50 breast with
a third-place £1.85. Peggy Hav
lach and Kayley Vernallis
launched personal bests in that
event as well (32.71 and 31.74
respectively). Haslach racked
up her fastest 200 breast time,
2:26.98, and a sixth place.
Zena Herrmann amassed
best times and AIAW standards
in the 100 back 1:00.14 to win
second place honors. The
200 free (1:54.05) and the 50
back (28.3) were also strong
events for Flerrmann.
Sheri Burlingham placed
fourth in the 50 free, where she
sprinted to a personal record
of 24.80, under the AIAW qual
ifying standard.
Nancy Thompson made the
national time with a 53.14 best
time in the 100 free. Also in the
100, Kim Peyton recovered to
salvage a second (52.09).
The Cards blitzed all teams in
the relay competition, as each
relay attained national qualify
ing times. )ezek, Moran,
Beaudet and Peyton swam to
the fastest time in the nation in
the 200 medley relay with a
1:47.46.
The Stanford womens'
swimming team soundly
crushed the other 15 teams
competing in the Stanford Invi
tational at deGuerre pool
complex last Friday through
Sunday. The Cards won 12 of 23
events and throttled their
closest trailing opponent,
USC, 1095-732.
While convincingly defend
ing their title, the Cardinals
clocked numerous best times
and met AIAW qualifying stan
dards in a myriad of events.
Thus, the meet was fulfilling
from both team and personal
perspectives.
Linda Jezek paved the way
for her team's success, as she
captured first-place honors in
seven of eight individual races.
She matched AIAW times in
every event in which she par
ticipated and proved beyond a
doubt that she is the mainstay
for Stanford's premiere posi

tion in the world of women's
swimming.
lezek effortlessly won three
events in a row on Friday in re
markably fast times. She began
her conquests by recording
her best-ever time in the 100-
yard butterfly, 56.43, to chop to
a win in an event in which she
does not usually compete.
)ezek next assumed the
driver's seat with a clear-cut
victory in the 200 individual
medley in another AIAW mark
of 2:05.46. She finished off the
day in splendid fashion when
she outmoded an AIAW record
with a dazzling 1:59.03 in the
200 backstroke.
Assistant Coach Claudia
Thomas denoted Jezek's per
formance in that race as a "sen
sational early season time,"
and further related that she "is
quite certain that no one else
will be under two minutes be
fore the national champion
ships," to be held in
Pittsburgh, March 15-17.
The freshman sensation con
tinued her mechanistic domi
nance Saturday. She opened
the individual confrontations
by annihilitating all other con
tenders in the 400 IM, one of
the most physically demanding
and diverse events in swim
ming. She took a mere 4:24.0}
seconds to cover the distance
from start to finish and won by
a resounding eight seconds.
The former Santa Clara star
immediately followed up that
preponderance with a 57.02
win in the 100 back, where she
was the only swimmer to break
the one-minute barrier.
lezek did not relent at all on
Sunday in the culmination of
the meet's invigorating action.
She slipped past UCLA's
stand-out, Tauna Van
deweghe, to hit the touch pad
first in 26.99 in the 50 back.
Later she swam two more
consecutive events to conform
to her established image of an
automaton. She rolled to a
close second in the 50 fly
(26.38), which nonetheless
qualified her for the nationals,
and then whetted her insati
able appetite for triumph with
a victory in the 100 IM (59.2).
Although )ezek's leading fi
gure was the most obvious, she
was definitely not the only
Card to excel at the meet.
Tri-captain )o Clark swam the
best time in the nation yet this
year when she fluttered to a
first-place time of 16:45.15 in
the excruciatingly monoton
ous 1650 free. Clark also gar

nered a third in the 500 free in
4:57.50 and won the consola
tion heat of the 200 free in her
fastest time, 1:54.14, which
makes her eligible for the na
tionals in that race.
Noel Moran whippped to a
30.88 win in Friday's 50
breaststroke and gunned to
the nation's fastest 200 breast
(2:20.8) Sunday. She picked up
a third-place finish in the 100
IM (1:00.0) for her fastest time
and an AIAW standard in that
brief amusement.
Libby Beaudet finished third
in thelOO fly (58.13) and third in
the 400 IM in 4:32.%. Mean
while, she compiled her best
time in the 200 IM of 2:09.3,
where she grabbed the third
spot and was second in the
rough 200 fly (2:05.55).
Freshman Maria Pease swam
an outstanding meet. She qual
ified for AIAW competition in
the preliminary heats of the 200
free with her fastest time of
1:54.0. She achieved her best
