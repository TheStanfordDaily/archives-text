# Netters defeat Canada, 10-1

### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's top-ranked men's
tennis team bounced back
from its second-place finish in
the Northern California Inter
collegiates and trounced
Canada College 10-1 yesterday.
Lloyd Bourne got his first
chance to play No. 1 at Stan
ford and took advantage of it.
Bourne, who suffered an em
barrassing second-round loss
last weekend, had a tough time
with Canada's No. 1 man, Mark
Wagner, pulling out a 7-6, 6-4
match.
Bourne had not been
scheduled to play, but asked
coach Dick Gould if he could
be inserted in the lineup.
"I've been having a lot of
trouble concentrating lately,"
commented Bourne. "I con
centrate well for a while, but
I'm having trouble sustaining it
through the match."
Bourne had no trouble sus
taining concentration in the
doubles, teaming up with Jeff
Arons for the second doubles
match and easily disposing of
Mike Codiga and Beto Bloise,
6-1, 6-0.
Arons, in his first singles ap
pearance, was quite impres
sive, winning easily over
Graeme Robertson, 6-2, 6-2.
Jim Hodges, who played
solid tennis to reach the semi

finals of the Nor-Cal tourna
ment last weekend, had trou
ble early, dropping the first set,
6-3. Hodges came back,
though, and rallied to take the
last two sets 6-3, 7-5.
"We played well today, not
as well as we can play, but very
good, nonetheless," Card
coach Dick Gould said. "We're
going to have to play better to
live up to our ranking,
though.
"It's hard to be No. 1 in the
nation if you're only No. 2 in
Northern California," he said,
referring to the Cardinal loss to
Cal last weekend in the Nor-Cal
tournament. "We had some
bright spots in the tournament
last weekend though. Hodges
and Mitchell flayed well in the
singles and the freshman dou
bles team of Scott Bondurant
and Tim Mayotte won the dou
bles. The dark spots are all
things that we can improve on.
We'll have a chance to redeem
ourselves."
The Cards take on University
of San Diego in a double dual
match today at 2:30 on the Var
sity Courts. The men's lineup
will not change from today's.
The women will start
freshman Alycia Moulton at
the top spot, followed by
rapidly improving sophomore
Donna Rubin and freshman

Sue Rasmussen at No. 3.
San Diego's lineup features
Scott Lipton, who last year
gained an upset victory at the
No. 1 singles spot.
