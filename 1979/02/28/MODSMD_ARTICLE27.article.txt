# Giovacchini, Perry close collegiate careers
## 
### Jeff Powell 
Saturday night in Los
Angeles not only marks the
end of the 1978-1979 Stanford
basketball season but the clos
ing of the collegiate careers of
Paul Giovacchini and Wolfe
Perry as well.
Since arriving at the Farm
four years ago with the then
rookie coach, Dick Dißiaso,
the two have been plagued

with inconsistency, injuries
and frustration. Yet, in this
year, their Swan Song, they
have been at times, seemingly
unstoppable.
Captain Giovacchini paced
the Cards to three consecutive
wins in late December. During
that skein, he averaged 16.7
points and 5 assists per game
while shooting a sizzling 71
percent from the floor. He

went on a field goal shooting
rampage hitting eight for 10
against Harvard and nine for 11
versus San Diego State.
Meanwhile, Perry himself,
has had some impressive out
ings. The flashy 6-2 guard
poured in a team-high 22
points (18 in the second half) in
a rout over the highly touted
Santa Clara earlier in the sea
son. In his last Maples appear
ance Monday night, Perry was
superb. He hit 10 for 15 from
the field, pulled down six re
bounds and collected 23
points.
But, what was their greatest
thrill?
"One of my greatest thrills
was playing against my brother
(brother Marty Giovacchini has
since graduated from
Washington State) when I was
a freshman and sophomore,"
Giovacchini said. "We played
against each other in three dif
ferent games. That's some
thing that very few people have
a chance to do.
"However, beating UCLA
really stands out in my mind.
It's something that I can always
look back and remember. It
(beating UCLA) was one of the
most exciting moments in my
life," said Giovacchini, who
contributed 10 points and six
assists to the cause.
Perry agreed. "The UCLA
game, beating one of the best
teams in the country, would
have to be my greatest thrill,
also," he said. "It was just
something that you dream
about and it came true, for

once.
Incidentally, Perry was re
warded for his efforts by being
named national player of the
week by Sports Illustrated. The
drama major from Oakland
canned 15 of 20 field goal tries,
made five steals, and captured
a team-high eight rebounds
while scoring a career-high 34
points.
Beating UCLA may not even
have been in the realm of im
agination four years ago when
the two were freshmen. Yet,
since the Dißiaso era began,
they both have seen quite a
change in the quality of the
basketball program.
"Since I've been here, I've
seen a gradual growth of talent
in the ballclub," Perry said.
"Wecan now be competitive in
practice, thus making us a
more competitive ballclub
around the league."
"The quality of players on
the team has grown quite a
bit," Giovacchini added. "I
think the reputation of the
Stanford basketball team has
grown also. This shows in re
cruiting. Look at the number of
players we got from Southern
California last year. They never
would have come to Stanford
before."
The season will come to a
halting screech by this week's
end, however, and Perry and
Giovacchini will eventually
have to leave Stanford and
have to move on to bigger and
hopefully, better things.
Although their styles may
complement each other on the
court, their vocational in

terests diverge sharply from
there. Giovacchini plans to
pursue a career in business
while Perry entertains hopes of
the big time, the N.B.A.
"Right now, I have my fin
gers crossed that I'll be picked
up by an N.B.A. team," Perry
said. "That is my number one
priority.
"I'm just trying to get my
game together and my head
together, and hopefully, I'll be
able to play some ball," said
Perry, the eighth leading
scorer in Cardinal history.
Dißiaso has no doubts that
Perry will be drafted by some
club. If Perry doesn't stick
however, acting lies waiting
anxiously in the wings. Cur
rently, he has a major role in an
upcoming television series en
titled, appropriately, "Up and
Coming." It will be aired on the
PBS network this fall. Shooting
(26 episodes, two years worth)
will begin in May.
Both men have had out
standing cage careers wearing
the Cardinal and white and will
be sure to carry that.success
with them in years to follow.
"I've watched them grow in
the last four years into young
men," Dißiaso observed, "just
in our day to day relationships

and conversations, I've seen
them come in with a certain set
of goals and then go out, ac
complishing some of them,
changing others. I know that
they are prepared emotionally
and academically for the world

that's out there. They are both
very squared away guys. They
know what they want. They
know how to prepare them
selves to get it and I think that
both of them will attain their
goals in the future."
