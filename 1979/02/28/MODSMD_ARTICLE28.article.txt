### 
Begin and Carter to meet soon
Washington — President Carter said yesterday
that Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin has
decided to come here for "a frank discussion of all
the issues" in the stalled peace treaty talks.
Carter told a news conference that after he sees
Begin, who is due here tomorrow evening, he will
consider asking Egyptian President Anwar Sadat or
Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil here as well.
The announcement followed Begin's refusal to
attend a Camp David summit with Carter and
Khalil. The Israeli Cabinet turned down that invita
tion on a 14-2 vote.
Carter said he talked by telephone after the
Cabinet action with both Begin and Sadat. He
stressed the importance of completing a treaty and
that he hoped his talks with Begin would lead to an
early resumption of negotiations.
Earlier, an Israeli official said Begin refused to
attend the talks because Sadat decided not to par
ticipate and Egypt had hardened its bargaining
position.
Carter said Egyptian and Israeli delegations
meeting at Camp David last week with Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance had demonstrated they shared
the view that wrapping up a treaty was an urgent
necessity.
Carter presents standby oil ration
Iraq, the world's No. 2 petroleum exporter, and
Mexico joined Saudi Arabia yesterday in refusing to
increase crude oil prices to take advantage of the
halt in Iran'soil production. Iran said itwill resume
exports and auction its oil to the highest bidder.
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter said in a
broadcast news conference that "the situation
with supply and pricing is serious, but not criti
cal." The Carter administration yesterday made
public standby plans to limit gasoline use through
possible rationing and other conservation mea
sures. But, Carter said, "We don't have any pre
sent intention of implementing any of those mea
sures."
The conservation plans, which will be sent to
Congress tomorrow and which could be used only
in an energy emergency, include calls for limiting

service-station hours on weekends, restricting
temperatures in commercial buildings and cutting
unnecessary advertising lighting.
Saudi Arabia confirmed yesterday it would not
increase the price of oil before an April 1 boost
already scheduled by the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countires.
But several other members of OPEC have taken
advantage of the supply squeeze caused by the
cutoff of Iranian supply.
Uganda recaptures key town
Nairobi, Kenya — Ugandan President Idi Amin
said yesterday that forces loyal to him have recap
tured the key southern town of Masaka from "in
vading Tanzanian aggressors," but fierce lighting
was still going on.
Meanwhile, The Los Angeles Times reported
yesterday in a dispatch from Nairobi, Kenya, that
Western diplomatic sources said Amin had
evacuated his family to Libya, foreigners were fle
eing from Kampala and the Ugandan army was in
rebellion.
The report could not be immediately confirmed.
The official Uganda Radio, monitored in
Nairobi, quoted Amin as assuring the commander
of a "suicide battalion" based in Masaka that rein
forcements were on the way.
Amin said Sunday he had lost control over
Masaka, a provincial administrative center 80 miles
south of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, and 50
miles north of the Tanzania border.
It appeared to be the deepest penetration of
enemy units into Uganda since the two countries
went to war four months ago
Byrne wins Chicago primary
Democratic upstart Jane Byrne stunned Mayor
Michael Bilandic and the once mighty Chicago
party machine with a primary victory last night,
while in Kansas City, Mayor Charles Wheeler lost a
bid for an unprecedented third term.
Meanwhile, Cleveland voters gave their finan
cially pressed city a boost by overwhelmingly pas
sing a payroll tax increase. But voters followed the
recommendations ot Mayor Dennis Kucinich and
rejected a proposal to sell the city-owned electric

utility.
With 96 percent of the vote counted in Chicago
— 2990 oui of 5100 precincts — Byrne had 398,742
votes, or 50.9b percent, to Bilandic's 383,715, or
49.03 Dercent.
Byrne, a one-time Democratic regular and
city official who was fired after criticizing the
mayor, capitalized on (he city's bitter winter and
its problems to gain support for her effort to un
seat Bilandic from the office he inherited from the
late Richard Daley.
Tabulations from 639 of Cleveland's 645 pre
cincts gave the proposal to increase the city's
payroll tax from 1 percent to 1.5 percent a 73,648-
34,717 lead. The proposal to sell the Municipal
Electric Light System trailed 69,302 to 38,363.
Kucinich and many of his political foes supported
the tax increase to help the city stave off ban
kruptcy, but the mayor bitterly opposed selling
the utility.
In Kansas City, with all votes in, Bruce Watkins
led with 23,853 votes, Richard Berkley was second
with 22,897, |oel Pelofsky was third with 18,870
and Wheeler fourth with 18,536. Watkins and
Berkley will meet in a runoff March 27. If elected,
Watkins would become the first black to hold Kan
sas City's top office.

Saudi Arabia confirmed yesterday it would not
increase the price of oil before an April 1 boost

Uganda recaptures key town
Nairobi, Kenya — Ugandan President Idi Amin
said yesterday that forces loyal to him have recap
tured the key southern town of Masaka from "in
vading Tanzanian aggressors," but fierce lighting
was still going on.
Meanwhile, The Los Angeles Times reported
yesterday in a dispatch from Nairobi, Kenya, that
Western diplomatic sources said Amin had
evacuated his family to Libya, foreigners were fle
eing from Kampala and the Ugandan army was in
rebellion.
The report could not be immediately confirmed.
The official Uganda Radio, monitored in
Nairobi, quoted Amin as assuring the commander
of a "suicide battalion" based in Masaka that rein
forcements were on the way.
Amin said Sunday he had lost control over
Masaka, a provincial administrative center 80 miles
south of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, and 50
miles north of the Tanzania border.
It appeared to be the deepest penetration of
enemy units into Uganda since the two countries
went to war four months ago
Byrne wins Chicago primary
Democratic upstart Jane Byrne stunned Mayor
Michael Bilandic and the once mighty Chicago
party machine with a primary victory last night,
while in Kansas City, Mayor Charles Wheeler lost a
bid for an unprecedented third term.
Meanwhile, Cleveland voters gave their finan
cially pressed city a boost by overwhelmingly pas
sing a payroll tax increase. But voters followed the
recommendations ot Mayor Dennis Kucinich and
rejected a proposal to sell the city-owned electric

utility.
With 96 percent of the vote counted in Chicago
— 2990 oui of 5100 precincts — Byrne had 398,742
votes, or 50.9b percent, to Bilandic's 383,715, or
49.03 Dercent.
Byrne, a one-time Democratic regular and
city official who was fired after criticizing the
mayor, capitalized on (he city's bitter winter and
its problems to gain support for her effort to un
seat Bilandic from the office he inherited from the
late Richard Daley.
Tabulations from 639 of Cleveland's 645 pre
cincts gave the proposal to increase the city's
payroll tax from 1 percent to 1.5 percent a 73,648-
34,717 lead. The proposal to sell the Municipal
Electric Light System trailed 69,302 to 38,363.
Kucinich and many of his political foes supported
the tax increase to help the city stave off ban
kruptcy, but the mayor bitterly opposed selling
the utility.
In Kansas City, with all votes in, Bruce Watkins
led with 23,853 votes, Richard Berkley was second
with 22,897, |oel Pelofsky was third with 18,870
and Wheeler fourth with 18,536. Watkins and

Begin and Carter to meet soon
Washington — President Carter said yesterday
that Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin has
decided to come here for "a frank discussion of all
the issues" in the stalled peace treaty talks.
Carter told a news conference that after he sees
Begin, who is due here tomorrow evening, he will
consider asking Egyptian President Anwar Sadat or
Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil here as well.
The announcement followed Begin's refusal to
attend a Camp David summit with Carter and
Khalil. The Israeli Cabinet turned down that invita
tion on a 14-2 vote.
Carter said he talked by telephone after the
Cabinet action with both Begin and Sadat. He
stressed the importance of completing a treaty and
that he hoped his talks with Begin would lead to an
early resumption of negotiations.
Earlier, an Israeli official said Begin refused to
attend the talks because Sadat decided not to par
ticipate and Egypt had hardened its bargaining
position.
Carter said Egyptian and Israeli delegations
meeting at Camp David last week with Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance had demonstrated they shared
the view that wrapping up a treaty was an urgent
necessity.
Carter presents standby oil ration
Iraq, the world's No. 2 petroleum exporter, and
Mexico joined Saudi Arabia yesterday in refusing to
increase crude oil prices to take advantage of the
halt in Iran'soil production. Iran said itwill resume
exports and auction its oil to the highest bidder.
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter said in a
broadcast news conference that "the situation
with supply and pricing is serious, but not criti
cal." The Carter administration yesterday made
public standby plans to limit gasoline use through
possible rationing and other conservation mea
sures. But, Carter said, "We don't have any pre
sent intention of implementing any of those mea
sures."
The conservation plans, which will be sent to
Congress tomorrow and which could be used only
in an energy emergency, include calls for limiting

service-station hours on weekends, restricting
temperatures in commercial buildings and cutting
unnecessary advertising lighting.
Saudi Arabia confirmed yesterday it would not
increase the price of oil before an April 1 boost
