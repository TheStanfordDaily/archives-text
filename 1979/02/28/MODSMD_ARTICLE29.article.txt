# Women's Week events to commence Monday
## 
### Robin Millington 
Women's Week will be held here
next week, March 5-9, as part of an
"ongoing series of workshops" to
foster an awareness of women's is
sues at the University, according to
Cindy Broholm, a women's affairs in
tern in the Office of Student Ac
tivities.
The week has been organized
through a collective effort of women
students here from 13 organizations
on campus, such as the Feminist Un
ion, the Pro-choice Alliance and the
Women's Center.
Dawn Upchurch, spokesperson
for the Feminist Union, said that the
dates for the event were chosen be
cause March 6 is International Wo
men's Day. Organizers of the event
have received funds for publicity
from the Office of Student Activities.
There are no titles or positions
among those who are organizing the
week because everyone is taking col
lective responsibility for its organiza
tion, Upchurch explained.
Upchurch said that the original
idea for the week came from Patricia
Brandt, an advisor in the Office of
Student Activities. "It was her im
petus that got all the groups to come
together," Upchurch said.
The opening speaker on Monday,
March 5, will be Cecilia Burciaga, as
sistant provost here. Burciaga re
cently resigned from President
)immy Carter's National Advisory
Committee on Women in protest of
his firing of committee co
chairwoman Bella Abzug.
On Tuesday afternoon there will
be a Women's Fair to provide infor
mation about the various women's
organizations here.
Some of the other events of the
week will be:
—a speech by Diane Piche, na
tional Pro-choice campus organizing

director;
—a screening of the movie Five
Women, Five Births about alternative
methods of giving birth;
—a program on battered women;
—a "Take Back the Night March"
to protest violence against women;
—a speech by and reception for
black writer Alice Walker;
—a seminar on Third World
Women;
—a service of schncharit, the tradi
tional )ewish morning ceremony,
rewritten as a women's service;
—an oral history of the suffragist
movement; and
—a speech on Women and
Judaism.
"There are several goals of the
week — one is to increase communi
cation between women's groups on
campus," said Ginny Puddefoot, a
member of the Feminist Union and
the Pro-Choice Alliance.
Puddefoot also said that a "major
idea around which Women's Week
was formed was to raise the aware
ness of the need for more space '
for women's activities.
She said that the only central meet
ing place for the various women's
organizations on campus is Rm. 13 in
the Women's Clubhouse which is
shared with other groups on campus
and is only temporary space for the
women's groups.
