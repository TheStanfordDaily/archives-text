# New research group to explore food options

Call them born-again raiders.
A chapter of the Public Interest Re
search Group (PIRG), the college
equivalent of "Nader's raiders," has
been organized here for the second
time in University history.
PIRG, a nationwide organization
founded in 1972 by consumer advo
cate Ralph Nader, researches con
sumer problems of interest to stu
dents and the community at large.
"Gathering information alone is a
tremendous public service," said
PIRG member Mark Breier. "We
don't know what we're going to do
with that information yet, but I think
it will be pretty valuable to the com
munity."
Interest in establishing a new PIRG
was sparked last fall after Nader
spoke on campus. The original Stan
ford PIRG was phased out in 1975,
after one year of operation, when the
ASSU cut off its funding.
Two projects
Barely three months old, and still
encumbered by administrative con
cerns, the new PIRG has initiated two
projects.
One involves gathering informa
tion about the proposed student
boycott of the Adolph Coors Co. The
other will explore the "recreational,"
on-campus food options available to
students.
"The dimensions of the projects
are smaller than they will be in the
future," says )odi Stone, PIRG trea
surer. The major concern now is to
secure adequate funding for the
group.
The Stanford PIRG is one of more
than 150 regionals located on college
campuses throughout the nation.
Nader conceived of PIRG as a means
of harnessing the potential of stu
dent action that was demonstrated
during the 19605.
Some PIRGs have gained national
recognition because of their re
search. In 1975, the Northern
California PIRG (NorCal-PIRG) tes
tified before the Federal Trade
Commission as a result of a study on
accurate reporting of gas mileage by

used car salesmen. PIRGs have also
helped to write and lobby for state
legislation.
"We (students) have the re
sources, the time and the brain
power. There couldn't be a better
time to research and get things
done," said PIRG member Gabrielle
Gallegos, a sophomore.
PIRG is banking on student approval
of a fee assessment as its main source
of funding. ASSU Senatechairperson
Pete Stamos says he is "almost posi
tive" PIRG's proposal will be ap
proved, provided that at least 20 per
cent of the student body turns out to
vote in the spring.
If the assessment is passed. PIRG
will hire one or two staff people to
research, organize and publicize for
the group, according to Gallegos.
"The professional staff is to help
the students improve the quality of
their work," she said.
Direct action?
Stanford PIRG has not decided yet
whether it will follow up its research
with direct action, as other chapters
have done.
PIRG's expansion into issues
beyond campus concern is another
matter, still unresolved. It will de
pend upon how successfully PIRG
establishes itself within the Univer
sity community first.
"I'd like to have far-reaching go
als," she said.
PIRG members, however, say they
are sensitive to the danger of losing
sight of student interests.
Not satisfied
In 1975, the former Stanford PIRG
was eliminated partly because Uni
versity officials were not satisfied
that PIRG was benefitting students
here.
In that year, of nine groups asking
for a fee assessment, two were re
fused. Those two, one of which was
PIRG, were off-campus interest
groups.
Lee )ones, PIRG project coor
dinator at the time, blamed PIRG's
demise on bad publicity.
"We did not have the support of
the Daily, so we lost," he said.

spoke on campus. The original Stan
ford PIRG was phased out in 1975,
after one year of operation, when the
ASSU cut off its funding.
Two projects
Barely three months old, and still
encumbered by administrative con
cerns, the new PIRG has initiated two
projects.
One involves gathering informa
tion about the proposed student
boycott of the Adolph Coors Co. The
other will explore the "recreational,"
on-campus food options available to
students.
"The dimensions of the projects
are smaller than they will be in the
future," says )odi Stone, PIRG trea
surer. The major concern now is to
secure adequate funding for the
group.
The Stanford PIRG is one of more
than 150 regionals located on college
campuses throughout the nation.
Nader conceived of PIRG as a means
of harnessing the potential of stu
dent action that was demonstrated
during the 19605.
Some PIRGs have gained national
recognition because of their re
search. In 1975, the Northern
California PIRG (NorCal-PIRG) tes
tified before the Federal Trade
Commission as a result of a study on
accurate reporting of gas mileage by

used car salesmen. PIRGs have also
helped to write and lobby for state
legislation.
"We (students) have the re
sources, the time and the brain
power. There couldn't be a better
time to research and get things
done," said PIRG member Gabrielle
Gallegos, a sophomore.
PIRG is banking on student approval
of a fee assessment as its main source
of funding. ASSU Senatechairperson
Pete Stamos says he is "almost posi
tive" PIRG's proposal will be ap
proved, provided that at least 20 per
cent of the student body turns out to
vote in the spring.
If the assessment is passed. PIRG
will hire one or two staff people to
research, organize and publicize for
the group, according to Gallegos.
"The professional staff is to help
the students improve the quality of
their work," she said.
Direct action?
Stanford PIRG has not decided yet
whether it will follow up its research
with direct action, as other chapters
have done.
PIRG's expansion into issues
beyond campus concern is another
matter, still unresolved. It will de
pend upon how successfully PIRG
establishes itself within the Univer
sity community first.
"I'd like to have far-reaching go
als," she said.
PIRG members, however, say they
are sensitive to the danger of losing
sight of student interests.
Not satisfied
In 1975, the former Stanford PIRG
was eliminated partly because Uni
versity officials were not satisfied
that PIRG was benefitting students
here.
In that year, of nine groups asking
for a fee assessment, two were re
fused. Those two, one of which was
PIRG, were off-campus interest
groups.
Lee )ones, PIRG project coor
dinator at the time, blamed PIRG's
demise on bad publicity.
"We did not have the support of
the Daily, so we lost," he said.
