# Carter urges Chinese withdrawal
## China repels counter-invasions 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — China reported yesterday
that Vietnamese troops launched several counter
invasions into Chinese territory in the previous few
days but were driven back each time.
Intelligence sources here said China appears to show
no intention of withdrawing from Vietnam and has even
moved to reinforce its troops along Vietnam's north
eastern front, where some of the Vietnamese incursions
reportedly took place.
In his bluntest comment on the 10-day conflict, Presi
dent limmy Carter yesterday asked China to undertake
"a speedy withdrawal" from Vietnam. The request was
in a message given to the top Chinese leaders by Treas
ury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, who is visiting Pek
ing.
In Washington, Carter said at a news conference that
he has made known to the Chinese his "firm disap
proval" of their invasion but said it would be counter
productive to terminate the newfound bilateral relations
with Peking.
Troops killed
The Vietnamese, meanwhile, claimed that they wiped
out 2200 Chiryese soldiers in four days, 800 of them
Monday in clashes along the northeastern coastal front.
In the Northwest, Vietnam reported its troops were
locked in combat with the Chinese 15 miles inside Viet
nam along the banks of the Red River, the vital water
corridor to the capital of Hanoi.
The official Chinese news agency Hsinhua reported
yesterday from Peking that a battalion of Vietnamese
troops attacked a commune on the kwangsi border
Sunday, but Chinese soldiers and militiamen fought
back, wiping out some of the invading troops and driv
ing the rest back across the border.
First report
This was the first time during the border war that
Hsinhua has reported a Vietnamese invasion of Chinese
territory.
The official agency has carried only a few items about
the war, mostly accounts of Chinese soldiers described
in heroic terms. It has carried no detailed accounts of
fighting and no Chinese casualty figures.
Western reporters have been barred from covering
the war on the various fronts. Most information comes
from Chinese and Vietnamese broadcasts.

Hanoi claims to have killed more than 16,000 Chinese
since Peking invaded Feb. 17. Intelligence sources con
sider that tigure inflated.
China has not given casualty figures, but in Tokyo,
Japan's Kyodo News Service reported classified Chinese
reports listed about 17,000 Vietnamese "wiped out" in
the first week of fighting. The news service attributed its
information to Chinese sources in Peking.
The official Voice of Vietnam Radio said the most
concentrated fighting was in the Cam Duong province
along the northern reaches of the Red River corridor, the
vital river, rail and road link that runs from the north
western frontier to Hanoi, the capital.
Chinese casualties
The broadcast, monitored here, said two Chinese
companies were wiped out in Lang Son province, north
east of Hanoi, on Monday.
It said another 250 Chinese soldiers were killed or
wounded Sunday and Monday in the Phong Tho district
of Lai Chau province. Phong Tho is 15 miles inside Viet
nam and 190 miles northwest of Hanoi.
In Moscow, Soviet Politburo member Andre Kirilenko
said their Vietnamese allies were "rebuffing" the
Chinese invasion on their own, but he repeated the
pledge that they also "have reliable friends," if need be.
Kremlin statement
Kirilenko closely adhered to the wording of a nine
day-old Kremlin statement which warned China "to stop
before it is too late." He gave no hint of what might
happen if the fighting continues.
"The Soviet Communist party is firmly convinced that
a world war can and must be averted, and is using the
might of the Soviet Union, its influence and authority"
to avert this possibility, Kirilenko said.
At the United Nations, the Security Council post
poned debate on the hostilities until last night. No offi
cial reason was given, but apparently the time was needed
by delegates seeking to draft a resolution calling for an
end to the fighting.
Radio Hanoi said the Vietnamese had dug in and with
stood a three-pronged Chinese armored and infantry
attack in the Cam Duong region, south of the provincial
capital of Lao Cai.
Cam Duong and Lao Cai were reported captured by
the Chinese last week, and both are in the Red River
Valley.

cial reason was given, but apparently the time was needed
by delegates seeking to draft a resolution calling for an
end to the fighting.
Radio Hanoi said the Vietnamese had dug in and with
stood a three-pronged Chinese armored and infantry
attack in the Cam Duong region, south of the provincial
capital of Lao Cai.
Cam Duong and Lao Cai were reported captured by
the Chinese last week, and both are in the Red River
Valley.
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — China reported yesterday
that Vietnamese troops launched several counter
invasions into Chinese territory in the previous few
days but were driven back each time.
Intelligence sources here said China appears to show
no intention of withdrawing from Vietnam and has even
moved to reinforce its troops along Vietnam's north
eastern front, where some of the Vietnamese incursions
reportedly took place.
In his bluntest comment on the 10-day conflict, Presi
dent limmy Carter yesterday asked China to undertake
"a speedy withdrawal" from Vietnam. The request was
in a message given to the top Chinese leaders by Treas
ury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, who is visiting Pek
ing.
In Washington, Carter said at a news conference that
he has made known to the Chinese his "firm disap
proval" of their invasion but said it would be counter
productive to terminate the newfound bilateral relations
with Peking.
Troops killed
The Vietnamese, meanwhile, claimed that they wiped
out 2200 Chiryese soldiers in four days, 800 of them
Monday in clashes along the northeastern coastal front.
In the Northwest, Vietnam reported its troops were
locked in combat with the Chinese 15 miles inside Viet
nam along the banks of the Red River, the vital water
corridor to the capital of Hanoi.
The official Chinese news agency Hsinhua reported
yesterday from Peking that a battalion of Vietnamese
troops attacked a commune on the kwangsi border
Sunday, but Chinese soldiers and militiamen fought
back, wiping out some of the invading troops and driv
ing the rest back across the border.
First report
This was the first time during the border war that
Hsinhua has reported a Vietnamese invasion of Chinese
territory.
The official agency has carried only a few items about
the war, mostly accounts of Chinese soldiers described
in heroic terms. It has carried no detailed accounts of
fighting and no Chinese casualty figures.
Western reporters have been barred from covering
the war on the various fronts. Most information comes
from Chinese and Vietnamese broadcasts.

Hanoi claims to have killed more than 16,000 Chinese
since Peking invaded Feb. 17. Intelligence sources con
sider that tigure inflated.
China has not given casualty figures, but in Tokyo,
Japan's Kyodo News Service reported classified Chinese
reports listed about 17,000 Vietnamese "wiped out" in
the first week of fighting. The news service attributed its
information to Chinese sources in Peking.
The official Voice of Vietnam Radio said the most
concentrated fighting was in the Cam Duong province
along the northern reaches of the Red River corridor, the
vital river, rail and road link that runs from the north
western frontier to Hanoi, the capital.
Chinese casualties
The broadcast, monitored here, said two Chinese
companies were wiped out in Lang Son province, north
east of Hanoi, on Monday.
It said another 250 Chinese soldiers were killed or
wounded Sunday and Monday in the Phong Tho district
of Lai Chau province. Phong Tho is 15 miles inside Viet
nam and 190 miles northwest of Hanoi.
In Moscow, Soviet Politburo member Andre Kirilenko
said their Vietnamese allies were "rebuffing" the
Chinese invasion on their own, but he repeated the
pledge that they also "have reliable friends," if need be.
Kremlin statement
Kirilenko closely adhered to the wording of a nine
day-old Kremlin statement which warned China "to stop
before it is too late." He gave no hint of what might
happen if the fighting continues.
"The Soviet Communist party is firmly convinced that
a world war can and must be averted, and is using the
might of the Soviet Union, its influence and authority"
to avert this possibility, Kirilenko said.
At the United Nations, the Security Council post
poned debate on the hostilities until last night. No offi
cial reason was given, but apparently the time was needed
by delegates seeking to draft a resolution calling for an
end to the fighting.
Radio Hanoi said the Vietnamese had dug in and with
stood a three-pronged Chinese armored and infantry
attack in the Cam Duong region, south of the provincial
capital of Lao Cai.
Cam Duong and Lao Cai were reported captured by
the Chinese last week, and both are in the Red River
Valley.
