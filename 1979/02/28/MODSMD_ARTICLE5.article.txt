# Ultrasound cancer treatment developed here
## 
### Fran Miller 
Cancer cells of 50 percent of the
patients treated showed a favorable
response to an ultrasound heating
process developed here for superfi
cial or skin tumors, a study recently
conducted by Medical Center re
searchers has found.
According to Dr. |ane Marmor, as
sistant clinical professor of
medicine, it has been discovered
"here and elsewhere that cancer
cells and tissue culture can be killed
by heat at a level where normal cells
are still all right."
Marmor said the study was made
to see if there was any benefit to
using ultrasound to induce this heat.
Findings are reported in the )anuary
issue of the journal Cancer.
Dr. George Hahn, associate pro
fessor of radiology and head of the
project, began working with heat
and tissue culture in combination
with anti-cancer drugs five years ago.
Successful pre-clinical studies on
animals preceded treatment of 25
volunteer patients who having all
failed standard cancer treatments
such as surgery, radiation and
chemotherapy, signed consent
forms to participate in the study.
Theequipment used, which makes
possible increased localized temper
ature without increased body temp
erature, was designed by Douglas
Pounds, assistant radiology re
searcher.

The experiment revealed a 50 per
cent volume shrinkage in half
the patients, who were treated six
tiroes over a two week period. How
ever, Marmor said that these results
are "just temporary" in keeping the
tumor under control. She said that
ultrasound heating by itself can not
be used as a cure for cancer, but that
combining the heating with other
methods such as radiation might
bring more successful results.
The research is funded by the Na

tional Institute of Health and the
Kaiser Family Foundation. According
to Marmor, although some investiga
tions in this area were made earlier in
the century, the validity of ul
trasound was not accepted nor was
the process well understood.
At present, the University is the
only institution conducting experi
ments on this specific type of heat
ing. There are other methods de
veloped elsewhere, such as elec
tromagnetic heating.

There are still many problems with
ultrasound, such as the painful side
effects caused in some patients.
Marmor said that "much further re
search" is necessary.
Marmor explained that ultrasound
heating cannot be used for lung or
other deep-surface tumors. The re
searchers are currently trying to de
velop methods of heating which will
effectively treat these kinds of
cancer.
