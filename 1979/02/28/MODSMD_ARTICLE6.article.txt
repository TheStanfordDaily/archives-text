# Theologian sees critical choices in future
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Cordon Ingram strikingly personifies the
modern-day Renaissance man: he combines a
studied knowledge of the past with a concerned
approach to the future in an attempt to derive
meaning in the world today.
Ingram is pastor at the First United Presbyterian
Church in Marquette, Mich. He frequently lec
tures and leads seminars at colleges and univer
sities.
Last Wednesday Rev. Ingram expressed his out
look on the future and its relation to our life now in
a speech sponsored by the Stanford Committee
on Political Education (SCOPE) and Memorial
Church at Meyer Forum Room. Earlier that after
noon he led a seminar for interested students at
Cedro House.
He said that he thinks that "the people of your
(college-age) generation will be making the really
critical decisions and choices in the future. Look
ing toward the year 2000, some of the most critical
choices ever will have to be made. As a basic point
of myministryas aChristian pastor, I like to help
people. I also like college people."
Ingram explained that "my philosophy of teach
ing is that it is investment in other people, and I
like to do that." He began his speech by confirm
ing that "I'm excited about tonight, and I want to
be a part of your life here."
Approach to reform
Relying on his background in technology and
business, Ingram emphasizes a wholistic ap
proach to reform. Just as an interdisciplinary view
point stresses fragmentation, Ingram's coopera
tive method promotes the fitting together of many
pieces, which are not the provinces of any one

discipline. He strives to combine social, political,
economic and religious experience to resolve the
complexities of the world today and in the future.
Thus, Ingram theorized that the best way "to get
a handle on the future is to look at the past ... to
get outside of our culture and look in." He said he
believes that )ohn Locke's tenets, "which have
come to uphold rugged individualism and increas
ingly aggressive, even hostile actions, "will not
succeed now in a "world that needs to work to
gether" to combat the confounding intricacies of
future shock.
"The nature of tomorrow's world, which you
and I shape now, will be and is that of synthesis
rather than that of analysis," Ingram said. "We have
got to learn a whole new culture in the way we
live," he continued. "The future will be a redis
covery of the spiritual to minister to the whole man
and to combine science and religion," he con
cluded.
Two polarities
From a global perspective and a Christian frame
of reference, Ingram envisons a dialectical nature
of theology. He said that the truth lies between
two polarities, but that there is hope now be
cause resurrection means that the future is in
Cod's hands. Most importantly, an individual can
and does make a difference.
On a positive note, Ingram found that "our
technological society has learned to work with
nature and not to 'manhandle' it." Still, the goal
now is to "get the future on the agenda" of our
political leaders.
"Dreams are a part of what reality is made. Mar
tin Luther King had a dream, and I do too," Ingram
said.

Ingram urged student awareness and immediate
action in a three-fold outline of criteria: "begin
gathering information to understand the future,
try to come up with a working formula and form
coalitions and get elected to positions of power to
enact policies for the future."
Ingram's background bespeaks his diversified
nature.
Originally hailing from Indiana, he graduated
from the U.S. Naval Academy, where he played
football and basketball, with an undergraduate
degree in marine engineering. He then further
expanded his background of technical informa
tion with a bachelorofarts in petroleum geology at
the Univ. of Texas.
Inured with science, Ingram proceeded to pur
sue a more practical tack: he obtained a master's
degree in business administration from the Univ.
of Texas and became a corporate officer of the
Natural Gas Pipeline Company, where he exer
cised corporate management for five natural gas
companies for a period spanning five years.
Weekends more important
Ingram said that he "really liked" those years
under the tutelage of oil magnates, but "what I was
dong during the weekends became more impor
tant than what I was doing during the weeks."
At that crucial point, Ingram decided to turn to
his present occupation, that of theologian and
minister.
Upon completion of a degree in Bible-History-
Theology at McCormick Seminary, he assumed a
sequence of pastorships. In his work as a religious
leader, Ingram has focused upon human rights
and the need for interdependent relationships for
the solution of problems.
