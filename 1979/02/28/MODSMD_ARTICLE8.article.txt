# Goal of fund raisers is participation, not money
## 
### Matt Mettler 
Unlike most fund raising
drives which seem to want
more, more, more, there is
one here on campus whose
stated goal is not raising as
much money as possible. The
senior pledge fund's goal is
"participation, not how much
money we raise" according to
Julie Peterson, co-chairman of
the fund.
Wendy Bennett, director of
student development, said that
last year 18 percent of the
senior class participated by
making some contribution to
either the senior pledge fund
or to the equivalent engineer
ing pledge fund.
She added that the senior
pledge core committee is now
recruiting area representatives
—seniors in each living unit
who will eventually contact the
other seniors in the area for
donations. She said they
hoped to be finished with this
first stage sometime this week.
"Our goal is to contact all
on-campus seniors," Peterson
said. "We hope to start solicit
ing seniors at the beginning of
spring quarter."
Bennett said the senior
pledge is important because
potential donors will look at
the degree of alumni involve
ment, including involvement

by recent alumni, as a sign of a
"healthy" college or univer
sity. In addition, the pledges
help make matching grants
more common, she said. A
matching grant is when a large
donor promises to match some
of the contributions of other
smaller donors.
About 25 percent of all Uni
versity alumni give regularly
each year, Bennett said. Addi
tionally there are a number of
people who are not alumni but
who contribute money be
cause of an interest in the Uni
versity, Bennett said.
The reason for the senior
pledge program is to make
students aware, while they are
still here, of the University's fi
nancial need, Bennett said.
The other student fund
raising activity is the Heritage
Fund, which is a scholarship
fund for freshmen and sopho
mores who have shown "lead
ership potential," Bennett said.
' I'd like to think of con
tributing as a way of making the
benefits I have received availa
ble for others," said Dennis
Franks, a senior pledge core
committee member. Tuition
only covers a part of the cost of
attending the University, he
added.
But the amount collected by
senior pledge is not as impor

tant as getting people in
volved. "It is a symbolic show
of appreciation and support,"
he said.
Franks said he wouldn't be
surprised by people who have
negative feelings toward the
idea of donating money after
having just paid $10,000 in tui
tion, But without the pledges,
he said, tuition would be even
higher.
Senior pledge ran into diffi
culty last year when the United
Campus Christian Ministry
sent letters to all seniors en
couraging them not to partici
pate as a way of protesting the
University's stockholding in
South Africa.
Last year 110 persons sent in
a card saying they were not par
ticipating specifically because
ot the University's position on
stockholdings. That compared
with 186 seniors who pledge
some amount, Bennett said.
Peterson said she didn't see
this happening again this year.
She said that by directing the
student's donation to a certain
campus program, seniors can
"support something in particu
lar that they like about the Uni
versity."
It doesn't make sense to
damage all of Stanford because
of one University interest, she
said.
