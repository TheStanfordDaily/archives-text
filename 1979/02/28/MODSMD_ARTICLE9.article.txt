# Fremont teens investigate Kennedy murder
## 
### Sheryl Davis 
They say they've got the
proof to back up a John F.
Kennedy assassination conspi
racy theory, but they are hav
ing a hard time finding anyone
who will take them seriously.
Their age may have a lot to do
with that. The two, kal Korff
and Richard Kirchhofer, are
both 16.
The Fremont teenagers have
been conducting their own in
vestigation of the Kennedy as
sassination for the past year
and they've uncovered some
new information which, as far
as they're concerned, conclu
sively points to a conspiracy.
Their evidence is a computer
analysis of a photograph of the
infamous grassy knoll and
stockade fence behind the
President's motorcade in Dal
las. This photo, by Mary Ann
Moorman of Dallas, was taken
immediately after the Presi
dent was shot. According to
the two boys, the computer
analysis picked up two human
figures and a rifle near the
stockade fence.
They said they had hoped
that the computer would find
one figure near the fence be
cause this would corroborate
witnessess' testimony as re
corded by the Warren Com
mission back in the 19605.
By accident
It was only by accident that
the computer found two
human figures by the fence.
The first time Kirchhofer and
Korff had the photo analyzed,
they requested that the
analysis zoom in to the left side
of a tree by the stockade fence.
They had meant to ask that it be
done to the tree's riuht.

But the computer analysis
showed a human figure to the
left of the tree.
Another analysis was run on
the photo — this time on the
area to the tree's right. Again,
the computer picked up a
human figure, this one holding
a rifle.
Korff and Kirchhofer have
put a lot of faith in the findings
of the computer. The
mechanism belongs to Ground
Saucer Watch (GSW), a UFO
organization in Phoenix,
Arizona. Developed by NASA
during the Cold War years and
used to validate photos of
UFOs, the digital computer
runs three separate tests on
photos and then evaluates
findings for further validation,
Korff explained.
Three tests
The first process is edge en
hancement. This techniquede
termined that the shapes in the
photo suspected to be human
figures were three
dimensional and had not been
superimposed onto the print.
The second process called
color contouring is similar to a
spectrograph. The densities of
photographed subjects — in
this case the density of a
human head and a rifle — are
fed into the computer, Korff
explained.
Densities in the photo
matching those fed into the
computer show up color
coded. Again, the conspiracy
theory was validated.
The third test is known as di
gitizing, or computer en
hancement. Here, the photo is
broken down into more than
200,000 picture cells. Each cell
is scanned up to 256 different

density levels. The test helps
determine the different planes
in which photo subjects are lo
cated. If there really were two
persons and a tree behind the
stockade when the photo was
taken, they should be on the
same plane, which is exactly
what the computer showed.
Likewise, the figures should
appear on a closer plane than a
railroad watchtower which
shows up in the photo behind
the stockade fence. Again, the
picture cells validate the
photo. In the analysis, the
watchtower is shown to be on a
different plane, several
hundred feet behind the
fence.
And finally, the GSW compu
ter ran the information from all
three tests together and came
up with the same conclusion —
that the dark areas in the
Moorman photo are not just
shadows or foliage, but match
the known densities of a
human and a human with a
rifle.
A conspiracy?
Does this suggest a conspi
racy? Korff and Kirchhofer said
they think it does. And working
as one group of investigators
helping another group, they
sent their findings to the
House Assassinations Commit
tee last year.
But their findings were
doubted. Korff and Kirchhofer
said that Dr. Robert Hunt, who
wrote the report on the photo
evidence for the Committee
retorted that what they had
analyzed could be just a
scratch on the photo.
The boys say there was no
scratch on the photo when
they sent it to Hunt, but there

was when it was returned. And
Kortt quickly explained that if it
had been only a scratch, the
computer would have picked it
up and identified it as such.
"I got the impression that he
really couldn't say anything or
didn't want to," korff
explained.
The Committee's report on
the assassination investiga
tions is slated for publication in
March, but Korff and Kir
ch hoter don't know if their
photographic evidence will be
included.
The teenagers first obtained
a copy of the Moorman photo
from Associated Press — Wide
World Photo. That print cost
them $i5. They estimate that
they've put at least $100 of their
own money into the project.
"People seem to think we
just do this for the money,"
Kirchhofer said.
But not only can't the boys
get people to pav for their re
search, they're also having
trouble getting people to be
lieve their research.
"One of the disadvantages
has to do with our age, but the
computer findings should have
nothing to do with our age. All
we're trying to do is tell people
what the computer says," Korff
said.
Extra-credit paper
Their interest in the assassi
nation started when they wrote
an extra-credit paper on the
subject for an English class at
John F. Kennedy High School
in Fremont, where they are
both juniors.

The report turned out to be
218 pages and from it they got
the idea to do further research
— including the computer
analysis of the grassy knoll
photo.
When asked why they got in
volved in investigating the
Kennedy assassination, Kir
chhofer replied, "We hate
cover-ups and don't like liars."
Korff added, "I want people
to wake up a little. People see
things happen and they never
ask why."

just do this for the money,"
Kirchhofer said.
But not only can't the boys
get people to pav for their re
search, they're also having
trouble getting people to be
lieve their research.
"One of the disadvantages
has to do with our age, but the
computer findings should have
nothing to do with our age. All
we're trying to do is tell people
what the computer says," Korff
said.
Extra-credit paper
Their interest in the assassi
nation started when they wrote
an extra-credit paper on the
subject for an English class at
John F. Kennedy High School
in Fremont, where they are
both juniors.

The report turned out to be
218 pages and from it they got
the idea to do further research
— including the computer
analysis of the grassy knoll
photo.
When asked why they got in
volved in investigating the
Kennedy assassination, Kir
chhofer replied, "We hate
cover-ups and don't like liars."
Korff added, "I want people
to wake up a little. People see
things happen and they never
ask why."

Kal Korff (left) and Richard Kirchhofer, two Fremont teenagers, go
over their photographs and computer analysis which prove to them
that there was a conspiracy to murder John F. Kennedy.
They say they've got the
proof to back up a John F.
Kennedy assassination conspi
racy theory, but they are hav
ing a hard time finding anyone
who will take them seriously.
Their age may have a lot to do
with that. The two, kal Korff
and Richard Kirchhofer, are
both 16.
The Fremont teenagers have
been conducting their own in
vestigation of the Kennedy as
sassination for the past year
and they've uncovered some
new information which, as far
as they're concerned, conclu
sively points to a conspiracy.
Their evidence is a computer
analysis of a photograph of the
infamous grassy knoll and
stockade fence behind the
President's motorcade in Dal
las. This photo, by Mary Ann
Moorman of Dallas, was taken
immediately after the Presi
dent was shot. According to
the two boys, the computer
analysis picked up two human
figures and a rifle near the
stockade fence.
They said they had hoped
that the computer would find
one figure near the fence be
cause this would corroborate
witnessess' testimony as re
corded by the Warren Com
mission back in the 19605.
By accident
It was only by accident that
the computer found two
human figures by the fence.
The first time Kirchhofer and
Korff had the photo analyzed,
they requested that the
analysis zoom in to the left side
of a tree by the stockade fence.
They had meant to ask that it be
done to the tree's riuht.

But the computer analysis
showed a human figure to the
left of the tree.
Another analysis was run on
the photo — this time on the
area to the tree's right. Again,
the computer picked up a
human figure, this one holding
a rifle.
Korff and Kirchhofer have
put a lot of faith in the findings
of the computer. The
mechanism belongs to Ground
Saucer Watch (GSW), a UFO
organization in Phoenix,
Arizona. Developed by NASA
during the Cold War years and
used to validate photos of
UFOs, the digital computer
runs three separate tests on
photos and then evaluates
findings for further validation,
Korff explained.
Three tests
The first process is edge en
hancement. This techniquede
termined that the shapes in the
photo suspected to be human
figures were three
dimensional and had not been
superimposed onto the print.
The second process called
color contouring is similar to a
spectrograph. The densities of
photographed subjects — in
this case the density of a
human head and a rifle — are
fed into the computer, Korff
explained.
Densities in the photo
matching those fed into the
computer show up color
coded. Again, the conspiracy
theory was validated.
The third test is known as di
gitizing, or computer en
hancement. Here, the photo is
broken down into more than
200,000 picture cells. Each cell
is scanned up to 256 different

density levels. The test helps
determine the different planes
in which photo subjects are lo
cated. If there really were two
persons and a tree behind the
stockade when the photo was
taken, they should be on the
same plane, which is exactly
what the computer showed.
Likewise, the figures should
appear on a closer plane than a
railroad watchtower which
shows up in the photo behind
the stockade fence. Again, the
picture cells validate the
photo. In the analysis, the
watchtower is shown to be on a
different plane, several
hundred feet behind the
fence.
And finally, the GSW compu
ter ran the information from all
three tests together and came
up with the same conclusion —
that the dark areas in the
Moorman photo are not just
shadows or foliage, but match
the known densities of a
human and a human with a
rifle.
A conspiracy?
Does this suggest a conspi
racy? Korff and Kirchhofer said
they think it does. And working
as one group of investigators
helping another group, they
sent their findings to the
House Assassinations Commit
tee last year.
But their findings were
doubted. Korff and Kirchhofer
said that Dr. Robert Hunt, who
wrote the report on the photo
evidence for the Committee
retorted that what they had
analyzed could be just a
scratch on the photo.
The boys say there was no
scratch on the photo when
they sent it to Hunt, but there

was when it was returned. And
Kortt quickly explained that if it
had been only a scratch, the
computer would have picked it
up and identified it as such.
"I got the impression that he
really couldn't say anything or
didn't want to," korff
explained.
The Committee's report on
the assassination investiga
tions is slated for publication in
March, but Korff and Kir
ch hoter don't know if their
photographic evidence will be
included.
The teenagers first obtained
a copy of the Moorman photo
from Associated Press — Wide
World Photo. That print cost
them $i5. They estimate that
they've put at least $100 of their
own money into the project.
"People seem to think we
just do this for the money,"
Kirchhofer said.
But not only can't the boys
get people to pav for their re
search, they're also having
trouble getting people to be
