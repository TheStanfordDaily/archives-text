# Requests for Soviet exit visas increase
## Shcharansky describes husband's plight 
### Nancy Koehn 
Avital Shcharansky, wife of impris
oned Soviet Jewish dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky, urged students "to do
anything you can to express your
concern for my husband's case," at a
noon rally here yesterday.
Speaking through an interpreter,
Shcharansky told the approximately
700 people gathered in White Plaza
that the charge of collaboration with
the CIA against her husband "is not a
charge directed against an indi
vidual, but a charge directed against
the entire Jewish community."
Northern California is the first stop
on Shcharansky's fifth and latest tour
of the United States. "I am here be
cause I sincerely believe it is the right
time, the proper time, to continue
our activities (to free her husband),
and I am here to appeal to you to help
me," she said.
She said her husband has been
held in complete isolation for the
first 13 months of his 1.3-year sen
tence — "the most terrible torture
ever designed."
Although she has written to her
husband every day, she told a press
conference held earlier that "I know
he's received only one letter since
his arrest."
Declaring "the whole world knows
he is innocent," she told the press
conference that, "everything he did,
he did without overstepping Soviet
laws."
Her husband "never cooperated

or contacted the (U.S.) Central Intel
ligence Agency, and never transfer
red or offered to transfer secret in
formation to anyone," she said.
She cited the fact that President
Jimmy Carter denied that Anatoly
Shcharansky had any contact with
the CIA in July 1978.
Shcharansky stressed the impor
tance of the protest movement
against her husband's imprison
ment. "It is due to your protests and
the help I've received that my hus
band is still alive," she said. She
urged students to write to President
Carter and Congressmen to protest
her husband's imprisonment and to
request his release.
At the press conference,
Shcharansky noted that Congres
sional pressure on the Soviet Union

might be helpful in obtaining her
husband's release. She said, "I think
that at this stage, any action is gjod."
However, Shcharansky declined to
speculate on whether the United
States should use SALT II or other
U.S.-Soviet interaction as a bargain
ing tool to obtain Anatoly's ralease.
"I don't know (if the United States
should bargain)," she said. "I am not
a politician."
Shcharansky said that KGB inter
rogators promised her husband he
could leave the Soviet Union and go
to Israel if he "would cooperate with
the KGB to destroy the Jewish em
igration movement" to the Soviet
Union. Her husband refused this of
fer, she said. "He is happy he has
never gone against his conscience
and his own free will."

Although the number of Soviet
lews permitted to emigrate has risen
in the last year, the figures are mis
leading, according to Shcharansky.
The Soviets allowed JO,OOO people to
emigrate last year, but the Soviets
deliberately ignore a much greater
backlog of exit visa applications, she
said. "The requests for exit visas have
increased fourfold in the last year."
Shcharansky stated that to apply
for an emigration visa is "quite a
heroic deed. Nobody knows what
will happen to him (the applicant)."
Shcharansky's visit was sponsored
by the Stanford Committee on Politi
cal Education (SCOPE). She plans
stops in Denver, Boston, Seattle and
Washington, D.C. She will meet with
U.S. government officials in
Washington.
