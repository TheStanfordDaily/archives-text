I would like to answer some
of the prevalent criticisms of
the 'livepetition' proposal. The
objections, as I have seen them
• • in the Daily, are the following:
the live-petition would be
cumbersome to operate; it
would make the ASSU Senate
unstable and slow; and
senators would be too ac
countable to their con
stituents.
*■" I suggest the live petition will
not be cumbersome once in
use. The elections commission
will have nothing to do with
senate elections anymore —
there would not be any autumn
elections, no booths to attend,
ballots to count, or campaign
violations to detect. The elec
tions commission could quite
easily keep a listing of all regis
tered students (provided by

the Registrar's Office) and the
name of the one senator or
senatorial candidate's petition
each student has signed.
Second, why would the
live-petition make the senate
slow and cumbersome? I guess
such criticism stems from the
surprisingly pessimistic as
sumption that senators won't
be able to keep the support of a
critical core group of suppor
ters. If that is the assumption
behind this criticism, I think it's
just plain wrong.
If 200 signatures were re
quired to be seated as a
senator, then obtaining an ad
ditional ten or twenty signa
tures over that number would
ordinarily be plenty of insur
ance for the entire year. What
may happen is a few additional.
senators-will expand the size of
the "legislature" over the
course of the academic year,
but that is surely no serious

problem.
The third criticism is that the
live petition system will un
dermine the "I'll vote my con
science" or "I am wise, I will
vote the right way and con
vince my constituents later" at
titudes among senators. Why
do detractors think that wis
dom will vanish? Will not most
students be interested in sup
porting individuals with
strength of character, judg
ment and integrity?
I'm just a little bit surprised
that some would suggest that
most students are so petty as to
insist that the senator they
support cannot exercise inde
pendent judgment. Such an
objection sounds crazy to me.
If I wanted my wishes followed
to the letter or else, of if I had a
strong opinion on every issue
before the senate, I'd want to
be a senator, not a backer of
someone else.
Furthermore, students have

the chance to sign the petition
of the person they would most
like to see on the senate; the
senator and his or her backers
probably have a good deal in
common, they doubtless see
eye-to-eye on most political is
sues.
I think the live petition idea
is an exciting and plausible
concept. I feel certain it would
raise the level of participation
in student government and
lend more weight to actions
taken in the senate.
The live petition is certainly no
more cumbersome than the
present elections process. No
one has yet articulated a clear
reason why it would slow down
or undermine senate activity.
And senators will still be able to
be wise, winsome and all
things wonderful.
