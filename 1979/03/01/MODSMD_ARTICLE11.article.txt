## Social competition stifling 
### 
(Second of a series)
"As for Stanford — the
very academic atmosphere
that is so predominant here
makes life hard. Because we
are so immersed in our
studies, we often are lonelier
than usual. Pressure to
achieve, be popular, be in
volved is a reflection of col
lege life . . . Too often we
don't accept ourselves; how
can others accept us?"
Commenting on a survey I
recently distributed, this
student touched on much
which concerns us and the
Human Connection here.
She then made a fundamen
tal anticomment by signing
her name and inviting me to
"come down and talk about
it."
I received many very per
sonal views on returned sur
veys. Several made similar
points to the above; some of
these were more eloquent
and philosophical; others
were curt and angry. Yet all
pointed up a frustration with
combining Stanford and
people.
But only one person
reached out to me, offered
her identity and bid me to
comment on her thoughts.
Only one took the offensive
and challenged the very
problem she felt. She dared
to walk the line between re
jection and acceptance

knowing she could fall in the
first direction rather than in
the second.
Forfitting the anonymity of
the survey was remarkable
because of its boldness. The
security of being anonymous
relaxes our self
consciousness or at least
eases that portion which
keeps it self-bound. When
expressing our deep feel
ings, rejecting such a com
fort means taking a risk, the
risk of being recognized un
favorably in what we hold
most closely.
And if what we have to say
speaks of loneliness or in
security, surely the risk in
creases, for we see often that
people frown on these feel
ings. Everyone should be
satisfied with their friends, if
not, then something is
wrong with that person. By
admitting that you are lonely
or are not content you might
as well admit that you are
maladjusted.
If we feel inhibited to ex
press loneliness, does that
not place a large barrier to
overcoming it? We place an
acute premium on personal
achievement here which can
further shield what may be
perceived as a weakness.
This situation, the weaken
ing of the human connec
tion, does not live here exc
lusively, not nearly. Yet here

it can find a perfect breeding
ground.
Living here focuses tlie
condition of personal risk
taking. The University must
be so academically, for we
come here to gain know
ledge. And within our socie
ty's educational system, my
increase in knowledge must
be measured relative to
yours. So we make our best
efforts on exams, papers and
projects, and then discover
their relative values in
grades, evaluations and re
commendations. Pleasant?
Not often, but we have come
to accept its reality.
But also and too much so,
we insidiously have come to
accept and incorporate the
mentality of the competitive
system in our social arena —
an arena where no longer are
we working for a quarter's
grade, but rather for our very
existence in other people's
minds.
The "competition" pro
ceeds quietly — in a quite
non-competitive fashion.
We do not set curves for
amiability, nor do we ap
proach strangers as though
we were handing in an exam
to our TAs.
Yet first and lasting impre
ssions are made of evalua
tidns; and butterflies, blush
ing and being alone are born
of uncertainty of how

another might accept us.
Unsure of ourselves, unsure
with others and in a game in
which we are playing for
such high stakes, might we
find it easier not to play at all
rather than to play with the
possibility of losing?
And here, anyone who
brings the slightest inclina
tion not to play the game can
often find an easy way to sit
out. We all have access to a
limitless reservoir of per
sonal tasks.
Losing ourselves in ourse
lves comes easily and not al
together unfortunately here.
If satisfied with studies and
individual activities, no
problem exists. But if they
become a vehicle to direct
attention away from our
loneliness, then they prom
ote the problem by causing
more isolation.
Further, the very condi
tion of being so caught up in
our activities, alone or in
company, tends to direct us
away from the problems of
another person. If I feel satis
fied in myself and yet feel
uncomfortable with the dis
satisfaction of others, I can
easily avoid others — I al
ways have my deep well of
work to keep me busy and
conscience-clear.

grade, but rather for our very
existence in other people's
minds.
The "competition" pro
ceeds quietly — in a quite
non-competitive fashion.
We do not set curves for
amiability, nor do we ap
proach strangers as though
we were handing in an exam
to our TAs.
Yet first and lasting impre
ssions are made of evalua
tidns; and butterflies, blush
ing and being alone are born
of uncertainty of how

another might accept us.
Unsure of ourselves, unsure
with others and in a game in
which we are playing for
such high stakes, might we
find it easier not to play at all
rather than to play with the
possibility of losing?
And here, anyone who
brings the slightest inclina
tion not to play the game can
often find an easy way to sit
out. We all have access to a
limitless reservoir of per
sonal tasks.
Losing ourselves in ourse
lves comes easily and not al
together unfortunately here.
If satisfied with studies and
individual activities, no
problem exists. But if they
become a vehicle to direct
attention away from our
loneliness, then they prom
ote the problem by causing
more isolation.
Further, the very condi
tion of being so caught up in
our activities, alone or in
company, tends to direct us
away from the problems of
another person. If I feel satis
fied in myself and yet feel
uncomfortable with the dis
satisfaction of others, I can
easily avoid others — I al
ways have my deep well of
work to keep me busy and
conscience-clear.

"As for Stanford — the
very academic atmosphere
that is so predominant here
makes life hard. Because we
are so immersed in our
studies, we often are lonelier
than usual. Pressure to
achieve, be popular, be in
volved is a reflection of col
lege life . . . Too often we
don't accept ourselves; how
can others accept us?"
Commenting on a survey I
recently distributed, this
student touched on much
which concerns us and the
Human Connection here.
She then made a fundamen
tal anticomment by signing
her name and inviting me to
"come down and talk about
it."
I received many very per
sonal views on returned sur
veys. Several made similar
points to the above; some of
these were more eloquent
and philosophical; others
were curt and angry. Yet all
pointed up a frustration with
combining Stanford and
people.
But only one person
reached out to me, offered
her identity and bid me to
comment on her thoughts.
Only one took the offensive
and challenged the very
problem she felt. She dared
to walk the line between re
jection and acceptance

knowing she could fall in the
first direction rather than in
the second.
Forfitting the anonymity of
the survey was remarkable
because of its boldness. The
security of being anonymous
relaxes our self
consciousness or at least
eases that portion which
keeps it self-bound. When
expressing our deep feel
ings, rejecting such a com
fort means taking a risk, the
risk of being recognized un
favorably in what we hold
most closely.
And if what we have to say
speaks of loneliness or in
security, surely the risk in
creases, for we see often that
people frown on these feel
ings. Everyone should be
satisfied with their friends, if
not, then something is
wrong with that person. By
admitting that you are lonely
or are not content you might
as well admit that you are
maladjusted.
If we feel inhibited to ex
press loneliness, does that
not place a large barrier to
overcoming it? We place an
acute premium on personal
achievement here which can
further shield what may be
perceived as a weakness.
This situation, the weaken
ing of the human connec
tion, does not live here exc
lusively, not nearly. Yet here

it can find a perfect breeding
ground.
Living here focuses tlie
condition of personal risk
taking. The University must
be so academically, for we
come here to gain know
ledge. And within our socie
ty's educational system, my
increase in knowledge must
be measured relative to
yours. So we make our best
efforts on exams, papers and
projects, and then discover
their relative values in
grades, evaluations and re
commendations. Pleasant?
Not often, but we have come
to accept its reality.
But also and too much so,
we insidiously have come to
accept and incorporate the
mentality of the competitive
system in our social arena —
an arena where no longer are
we working for a quarter's
grade, but rather for our very
existence in other people's
minds.
