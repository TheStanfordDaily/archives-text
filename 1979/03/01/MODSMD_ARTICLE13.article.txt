## Press distortions equivalent to lies 
### 
Why is it so hard to find out
what is really happening in the
world these days? Much of the
problem has to do with the "es
tablishment" press which
often distorts and misrepre
sents events to the point that
the printed version can only be
accurately described as a lie.
Strong words? Let's look at a
few cases.
A recent New York Times ar
ticle printed in the Feb. 18
World contained a piece on
Zaire by John Dartone. In dis
cussing the history of the re
bellion in Zaire's Shaba pro
vince, Dartone says "In that in
vasion, 94 whites were mas
sacred in Kolwezi and over
1000 blacks were killed."
You may notice that in Africa
only whites get massacred.
You may also notice that when
rebels with bases in nearby
Angola come back to their

homeland to fight Zaire Presi
dent Mobutu Sese Seko's re
gime they "invade." The Bel
gian and French paratroops
who were flown in to recapture
the province end up, in the
Times version of reality, "re
pulsing" this invasion.
But the greatest dishonesty
is revealed when one investi
gates how the "94 whites were
massacred . . . and over 1000
blacks killed." They died, ac
cording to eyewitness reports
reprinted widely in Europe and
the alternative press here, in
the fighting between the
French paratroops and the
Shaba rebels. And perhaps
most of them were killed by
Mobutu's own troops who,
even Dartone admits, are con
sidered the main danger by the
whites still left in Shaba.
Such distorted reporting is
not restricted to African affairs.
Noam Chomsky has exten
sively documented a case
where not only has the death of
50,000 to 100,000 people been
hidden from the American
public but the deep American
involvement in the brutal inva
sion that killed these people
has been completely ignored.
Where is this you may ask? East
Timor. Where is that, you still
may ask?

East Timor is the eastern half
of the island of Timor located
in the Pacific. Indonesia, which
receives 90 percent of its arms
from the United States, in
vaded East Timor right after it
declared its independence
from Portugal in 1975. Since
then it has waged a vicious war
of occupation. Even In
donesia's own foreign minister
admits that the number killed
has been 50,000 people or
perhaps 80,000."
There isn't space here to de
scribe how and why the U.S.
press has systematically
blanked this story out. Flow
many of you have read about
Cambodia and how many of
you even know where East
Timor is??? Mass murder is so
much more interesting when
perpetrated by communists in
stead of U.S. allies using U.S.
guns.
Chomsky documents how
the New York Times, the Los
Angeles Times, and the New
Yorker among others, have all
carried (in what little coverage
they give to the fighting there)
grossly distorted information
on East Timor. After much dif
ficulty he finally found a
magazine willing to carry this
story — Inquiry. Interestingly
enough it is edited by an ex-

Daily staffer. It is even available
at some bookstores in the area.
There are a few other
magazines in the United States
that are willing to print such
stories, including Mother
lones, and In These Times, a
socialist weekly. Perhaps your
best buy is The International
Bulletin, which Chomsky re
commended while he was
here. It's a weekly with tightly
written articles on world af
fairs.
Vou may well ask "Why
should I trust these publica
tions any more than I trust the
New York Times?" You
shouldn't. Look at their
sources, judge what they say
by what is revealed in history,
and even check into the truth
of specific articles. I think that
they will bear the brunt of a
tough examination.
Papers like the New York
Times say they publish "All the
newsthat's fit to print." Unfor
tunately the tens of thousands
dead in East Timor just didn't
fit. Radicals have a different
slogan: "Speak truth to
power." In the end let us hope
truth can be power

Why is it so hard to find out
what is really happening in the
world these days? Much of the
problem has to do with the "es
tablishment" press which
often distorts and misrepre
sents events to the point that
the printed version can only be
accurately described as a lie.
Strong words? Let's look at a
few cases.
A recent New York Times ar
ticle printed in the Feb. 18
World contained a piece on
Zaire by John Dartone. In dis
cussing the history of the re
bellion in Zaire's Shaba pro
vince, Dartone says "In that in
vasion, 94 whites were mas
sacred in Kolwezi and over
1000 blacks were killed."
You may notice that in Africa
only whites get massacred.
You may also notice that when
rebels with bases in nearby
Angola come back to their

homeland to fight Zaire Presi
dent Mobutu Sese Seko's re
gime they "invade." The Bel
gian and French paratroops
who were flown in to recapture
the province end up, in the
Times version of reality, "re
pulsing" this invasion.
But the greatest dishonesty
is revealed when one investi
gates how the "94 whites were
massacred . . . and over 1000
blacks killed." They died, ac
cording to eyewitness reports
reprinted widely in Europe and
the alternative press here, in
the fighting between the
French paratroops and the
Shaba rebels. And perhaps
most of them were killed by
Mobutu's own troops who,
even Dartone admits, are con
sidered the main danger by the
whites still left in Shaba.
Such distorted reporting is
not restricted to African affairs.
Noam Chomsky has exten
sively documented a case
where not only has the death of
50,000 to 100,000 people been
hidden from the American
public but the deep American
involvement in the brutal inva
sion that killed these people
has been completely ignored.
Where is this you may ask? East
Timor. Where is that, you still
may ask?

East Timor is the eastern half
of the island of Timor located
in the Pacific. Indonesia, which
receives 90 percent of its arms
from the United States, in
vaded East Timor right after it
declared its independence
from Portugal in 1975. Since
then it has waged a vicious war
of occupation. Even In
donesia's own foreign minister
admits that the number killed
has been 50,000 people or
perhaps 80,000."
There isn't space here to de
scribe how and why the U.S.
press has systematically
blanked this story out. Flow
many of you have read about
Cambodia and how many of
you even know where East
Timor is??? Mass murder is so
much more interesting when
perpetrated by communists in
stead of U.S. allies using U.S.
guns.
Chomsky documents how
the New York Times, the Los
Angeles Times, and the New
Yorker among others, have all
carried (in what little coverage
they give to the fighting there)
grossly distorted information
on East Timor. After much dif
ficulty he finally found a
magazine willing to carry this
story — Inquiry. Interestingly
enough it is edited by an ex-

Daily staffer. It is even available
at some bookstores in the area.
There are a few other
magazines in the United States
that are willing to print such
stories, including Mother
lones, and In These Times, a
socialist weekly. Perhaps your
best buy is The International
Bulletin, which Chomsky re
commended while he was
here. It's a weekly with tightly
written articles on world af
fairs.
Vou may well ask "Why
should I trust these publica
tions any more than I trust the
New York Times?" You
shouldn't. Look at their
sources, judge what they say
by what is revealed in history,
and even check into the truth
of specific articles. I think that
they will bear the brunt of a
tough examination.
Papers like the New York
Times say they publish "All the
newsthat's fit to print." Unfor
tunately the tens of thousands
dead in East Timor just didn't
fit. Radicals have a different
slogan: "Speak truth to
power." In the end let us hope
truth can be power
