## Boost minority enrollment 
### 
Members of the University
community have recently ex
pressed concern about the de
clining enrollment of
minorities in graduate prog
rams here. The number of
minority graduate students in
science has been particularly
low. Many science depart
ments have no minority
graduate students at all.
The cause of this problem
lies in part with the low socio
economic status of minorities
in our society. However, there
is a small but growing pool of
qualified minority students
who might potentially enroll in
graduate science programs.
Part of the problem may be
providing information to these
students on opportunities
here.
In order to combat this prob
lem, the office of the Dean of
Graduate Studies will sponsor
a Stanford Conference for
Women and Minorities in the
Sciences on March 3. Oppor
tunities in a number of fields
will be discussed ranging from
earth sciences to astrophysics.
This conference is an impor
tant first step to help increase
the number of minorities and
women in the above programs.
However, to assure success in
achieving this goal, the Univer
sity must work aggressively in
the future. I would like to
suggest two specific proposals
which would, I believe, be
steps in the right direction.
First, I would like to join
other members of the minority
community here to call on
President Richard Lyman and
the administration to define
and adopt publicly a statement
of the University's commit
ment to affirmative action.
For example, the bulletin on
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology states, "The Insti
tute has created and im
plemented and will continue to
implement an affirmative ac
tion plan expressing its com
mitment to the principle of
equal opportunity in educa
tion."
A public expression of com

mitment would be important
for several reasons. It would
encourage departments and
programs which previously
had weak or nonexistent affir
mative action programs to
reexamine their practices in
light of official University pol
icy. Also, as Stanford has been
proclaimed one of the 10 most
influential universities in the
country, a public expression of
commitment to affirmative ac
tion in the wake of Bakke might
significantly influence the
policies of many other univer
sities.
Second, a committee or task
force should be established to
study the problem of declining
minority enrollment in
graduate and professional
school programs. Such a task

force should be composed of
students, faculty members and
administrators. It would be
charged with identifying major
barriers to increased enroll
ment and sharing ideas on dif
ferent strategies which might
increase representation. A
similar study is already in prog
ress at the University of
California.
While Lyman and other
members of the University
administration and faculty
have expressed concern over
the problem of declining
minority enrollments, it re
mains to be seen whether the
University will take any real ac
tion.
