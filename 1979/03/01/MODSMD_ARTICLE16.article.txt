## movies/john nielsen On a malformed classic 
### 
The Deer Hunter is a rough
first draft of what might have
been a masterpiece. It badly
needs editing and occasion
ally is confusing or contradic
tory or both. But it's also
among the best war movies
ever made. The Deer Hunter
makes you resent the hell out
of previous cinematic depic
tions of war, and puts you face
to face with the horror of the
thing — at its best it is unsettl
ing in an almost unpre
cedented way. It's not the kind
of movie that reduces itself to
maxims, and to the extent that
it attempts to do so The Deer
Hunter is a failure, but despite
all this the movie is something
of a major achievement in film.
There's very little of the "tell
'em I died for Betty" bullshit
that John Wayne types keep
croaking on the shores of Iwo

Jima, and only slightly more of
the"I told you so" that satu
rates later efforts — purely and
simply this is a film about war.
It doesn't claim to be,
though. According to
director / producer / one-of
four-writers Michael Cimino,
in The Deer Hunter war is "in
cidental to the characters and
their story. It's part of their
lives and just that, and nothing
more. So the war is simply a
means of testing their courage
and will power." Which is to
say there is considerable
reason to doubt whether
Cimino knows what he is on to.
In that sense Deer Hunter
exemplifies what can happen
when a director directs what he
has written, or produces what
he has directed. There is a plot
— the movie begins in a
Pennsylvania steel town,
moves with its "heroes" to the
war in Vietnam, and returns in
just over three hours and sev
eral years after considerable
machinations — there is a plot,
but in many cases it stands be
tween the audience and the
power of the movie. When
Robert De Niro, a decorated
veteran, is stared down by a
deer — at times like that you
see Cimino at far less than his
best, feverishly attempting to
reduce what he has done to the
cinematic equivalent of a
heroic couplet. And again,
when the veterans and their
friends slide intoa non-rousing
and horribly inappropriate
"Cod Bless America" — at that
point the movie is almost unbe
lievably wrong, so terribly in
adequate that you want to hide
your face.
Yet alongside the imposi
tions there are moments of
tremendous potency, in which
Cimino does in a movie what
can't be done anywhere else.
The three soldiers are cap
tured, and forced to compete
against each other in games of
Russian roulette — De Niro
watches a drinking buddy put a
shot through the side of his
head. And later, in Saigon, the
metaphor is continued, and
the acting and image and sub
stance flawlessly combined.
The terrors of war and the ef
fect thereof are presented in
the rawest and most concen
trated form, and the tension
and effect are very near un
bearable. We see how heroes
get their medals, and how
closest friends of heroes go
stark raving mad — the

similarities are greater than
may have been previously im
agined. I heard somebody a
few rows in front describe it as
a Nashville approach to war —
when it works The Deer Hunter
fits that phrase very well. The
characters are inextricably
linked to something above and
beyond them — critical masses
are reached in ways that are
largely inexplicable. The pic
ture simply cannot be tied off
neatly, and this is decidedly to
its credit, in spite of occasional
attempts to do precisely that.
On the acting: at virtually no
point in this movie can the ac
tors be faulted. You can pick at
the scriptwriters from time to
time for an occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies, for
conversations consisting al
most entirely of common
person buzz phrases repeated
unto death — you can get them
for that if you stress the great
skill with which the actors
make sure that we hardly ever
notice. The good ol' boys are
good ol' boys right on down to
the bone, and we never get a
caricature or attempt at re
verse aristocracy. They're just
steel workers and wives and
lovers and attendants to that
life — distinguishable from

everyone else by little rrfore
than logistics. John Cazale,
John Savage and Christopher
Walken are particularly good at
being normal, and Savage and
Walken are even better as the
two who, with De Niro, are
sent to kill Viet Cong.
And De Niro re-establishes
himself in The Deer Hunter as
an extremely versatile and
powerful performer. He is
starkly individualistic here in
much the same way that he has
been starkly individualistic in
practically everything else he's
made — flying in and out of
moods, giving us what we least
expect at times we least expect
it, talking to a deer that he was
just about to shoot; things like
this and then strange excite
ment as he points a gun into his
ear. De Niro is largely effective
for the same reasons that the
movie as a whole is effective,
and occasionally he restores it
when things get pushed out of
shape.
And The Deer Hunter is nore
than a little misshapen — it is a
very rough draft. But there is a
masterpiece buried in there
somewhere, and it more than
repays an attempt at excava
tion.
