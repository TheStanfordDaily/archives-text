## Exhuming some superb '60s jazz 
### 
Jazz was a fugitive art
form during the '60s. No
one promoted jazz or re
corded it with the intention
of making money — there
simply was no money to be
made in the field. Rather it
was the occasional jazz fan
turned businessman who
fought to keep jazz alive —
oftentimes by investing
large amounts pf unre
deemable money and time.
*
Two of the most impor
tant labels of that period —
Riverside and Prestige —
constantly operated on the
verge of bankruptcy.
Another label, Fantasy,
managed to succeed largely
due to their fortunate dis
covery of the Creedence
Clearwater group.
Milestone
Vet the music that these
Inbels recorded remains
among the most enduring in
the field of jazz. Milestone
Records has been reissuing
the material from these
labels during the past sev
eral years, and the vast
amount of exceptional
material they continue to
dig out of the vaults, much
of it never issued before, is
continually amazing.
Several recent reissues

are particularly praisewor
thy: Work Songs by Nat Ad
derley; Power by Dexter
Gordon; and Giant Steps by
Jaki Byard. Each of these ar
tists were far from commer
cial successes when the
sides were first recorded;
while even today Nat Adder
ley and Jaki Byard have yet
to achieve the acclaim
which is their due. It is in
deed fortunate that these
recordings were ever made.

Attractive
One of the most attractive
features of the old Riverside
recordings is the remarka
ble depth shown in the
choice of sidemen. Pro
ducer Orrin Keepnews had
(and still has) a remarkable
talent for finding the most
talented and sensitive
back-up musicians. This is

particularly evident on the
Nat Adderley album. Adder
ley is joined by guitarist Wes
Montgomery (then still
largely unknown), Vusef
Lateef (similarly undisco
vered), Wynton Kelly, Jim
Hall, Cannonball Adderley,
Charlie Rouse and others.
The music serves as an
excellent showcase of Ad
derley's fiercely mellifluous
cornet playing. Arrange
ments by the equally under
rated Jimmy Heath add con
siderable force to the solos.
Also interesting are several
tracks without piano on
which Wes Montgomery
handles the comping.
Entrancing
Ihe Dexter Cordon reis
sue, entitled Power, attests
to the continued talents of
that saxophonist during his
self-imposed exile in
Europe. The album features
several Cordon solos as well
as an entrancing version of
the Jobim song "Medita
tion."
Gordon has an elastic
tone which embraces a
melody line and gives it a
sense of permanence which
few improvisations possess.
His solos are always intelli
gent, if not outstanding,

and his compositions, if not
masterpieces, are always a
conducive format for heavy
jamming.
Sidemen
Once again the sidemen
deserve special credit.
Tenor saxophonist lames
Moody joins Gordon for
several numbers, while
drummer Al Heath and bas
sist Buster Williams provide
yeoman service through
out.
The third of these reis
sues is perhaps from the
least known musician. |aki
Byard is one of the undeni
able masters of the piano.
His technique is unsurpas
sed even by virtuosos such
as Peterson and Newborn,
but he remains largely un
known, even to jazz fans.
These recordings, made
almost two decades ago,
feature Byard working with
Ron Carter and Roy Haynes.
The songs are mostly Byard
originals, but the master
does include a spendid re
ndition of Gershwin's "Bess
You is My Woman." Al
though not as technical as
Byard's more recent solo
work, the album is a tasteful
example of fine jazz trio
playing.
