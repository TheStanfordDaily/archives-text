## Pilobolus dance to perform here 
### 
What could be more at home
on "The Farm" than a sun
loving barnyard fungus? Bad
puns aside, Pilobolus Dance
Theater (named after a genus
of saprophytic fungi) is a mar
velous group — fresh from a
State Department-sponsored
touroj India — who will be per
forming at Stanford University
this week.
Pilobolus, unlike most dance
companies, operates almost
completely cooperatively. All
group pieces are choreog

raphed communally, and at
one time the company lived
together too, running a farm in
Vermont.
Tracy
Listening to six dancers talk
at once would have been dif
ficult though, so despite the
company's collaborative na
ture, I spoke with only one of
them, Michael Tracy. Tracy was
in town a day earlier than the
rest of the company to give two
master classes in the com
munity. I trooped along to the

afternoon class, at De Anza
College in Cupertino.
On the way there, Tracy
explained the company's be
ginnings in the choreography
classes of Alison Becker Chase
at Dartmouth College in Ver
mont. Three Dartmouth men,
with little or no previous dance
training, formed the company
in 1971 and named it after one
of their first pieces.
The company now numbers
six: two women, including
their former teacher, Chase;

and four men, all Dartmouth
graduates including two of the
original founders. Tracy stres
sed the diversity within the
group noting their various in
terests ranging from cross
country skiing to fencing and
film.
While teaching the class
Tracy unconsciously de
monstrated Pilobolus' remark
able sense of balance, in solos
and en masse. Much of the
class he stood quite solidly on
one leg even on a slick floor in
heavy socks.
Croup balance
Generally Pilobolus' center
of balance is not with one per
son alone, but rather between
a group of people. This giving
and taking of weight makes the
group truly dependent on one
another. As he coached his
students in this technique
Tracy explained that you de
velop a "real relationship to
the group because they are
(literally) keeping you from fal
ling down."
There is no right side up fora
Pilobolus dancer, who may
even be used as a prop on oc
casion. For example, the piece
Monkshood's Farewell, to be
performed Friday night, in
volves a joust scene where
three dancers become a charg
ing steed, a rider and a lance to

battle three dancers in similar
roles.
Hardest to describe though
is Pilobolus' sense of humor,
broadly absurd and yet subtle,
combining as thev do elements
of dance theater. 'dnvme, but
above all playfulness, for that
you'll have to see them your
self.
Pilobolus' performance re
Thursday, Friday and Sati ay
at 8 p.m. in Memoria. Au
ditorium. Thursdays and
program . are the
s..me begnln g with Mollv's
Not Dead. This piece was
choreographed by the com
pany in 1978 and is based
Appalachian tune "Molly )t

dead, she's only sleepin', pa
tiently waiting for lesus to
come." The piece follows
through courtship, mating,
combat, death and resurrec
tion.
Solo
The next piece is a solo
danced by chase to a clarinet
melody by |ane Ira Bloom, enti
tled Moon Blind, also choreog
raphed in 1978. Ocellus, the
next piece, dates from the
companv's all-male days, and is
performed to music by Moses
Pendleton and Jonathan Wol
ken, two of the group's found
ers.
Untitled, which closes the
program, is an unusual piece

for two proper Victorian young
ladies who happen to each
have a pair of bare men's legs
showing beneath their skirts.
Two gentlemen in tails com
plete the cast.
Friday's program includes
two pieces for the whole com
pany, Ciona and Monkshood's
Farewell, as well as two solos, a
duet, Shizen, and a quartet,
Walklydon. Available for order
at the performances will be the
excellent book just, published
this year, Pilobolus. Written by
Tim Matson, the book is filled
with beautiful photographs of
most of the company's pieces.
