# Little 11 produces mixed results

### Rob Lempert Senior Staff Writer First in a series 
Perhaps it is indicative of the con
fusion that characterized the Little 11
conference that just about everyone
there had a different name for it.
Little 11 was of course wrong. MIT
dropped out weeks before the con
ference began leaving only 10
schools involved.
Others, like the hotel desk clerk
and those eastern delegates most
concerned with making their west
ern counterparts feel welcome,
called it the Ivy League conference.
The minority students who with
drew on the conference's last day cal
led it overtly and covertly racist.
Comments from other quarters
ranged from "elitist" to "a bunch of
self-serving, self-selected, Ivy
League demagogues."

One delegate, after viewing the
"stein"-studded list of last names on
the conference's planning commit
tee, toasted it as the world's biggest
Bar Mitzvah.
The Little 11 had definite prob
lems, from the original planning by
its directors to the preparation of
some of its delegates. But many
thought the idea behind it was
worthy, and even lames Grubbs,
co-chairman of the Minority Affairs
Committee, told the assembled con
vention delegates just after the start
of the minority boycott that "I be
lieve wholeheartedly in the idea of
this convention."
The Little 11 conference was con
ceived and organized by Leonard
Ginsburg, a student at the University
of Pennsylvania, and a small group of
other students from Ivy League
schools.

Its purpose, as stated in the con
ference orientation manual, was to
be an "exchange of ideas, informa
tion, programs, and perspectives on
student issues" between know
ledgeable students from different
schools. Delegates from Brown,
Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Har
vard, Princeton, Stanford, the Uni
versity of Chicago, the University of
Pennsylvania and Yale attended.
The goal of the conference was to
assemble groups of students who
had each carefully researched how
their university had dealt with
specific student problems. They
would prepare reports on their find
ings and send them to their fellow
delegates at other schools before the
conference began.
Then, when Little 11 convened,
students could meet to discuss their
common problems with all the latest
data at their fingertips. They could
compare the programs at the diffe
rent schools, and then in seeking
new solutions, they could combine
and revise bits and pieces of the old
programs, or even invent totally new
ones. When the delegates returned
to their schools they could push for
implementation of these new prog
rams with the weight on research on
their side.
At times, the conference showed
signs of living up to its potential. The
Committee on Tuition, Financial Aid,
and Admissions, one of eight con
ference committees, met one after
noon with the director of admissions
of the University of Pennsylvania. He
told them he believed that the declin
ing enrollment of minorities in Ivy
League schools was a result of minor
ity students choj jng to enroll in
predominantly black colleges.
No sooner had he said this than a
delegate from Brown pulled out a
folder and began reading admissions
on where minorities admitted to
Brown had eventually decided to en
roll. Only one had gone to a black
college. The admininstrator
promptly withdrew his theory and
promised to look into the problem
more closely.
Another proferred justification of
the conference was that delegates
could propose policies that were
merely adaptations of pre-exisiting
programs elsewhere. Since univer
sity administrators are often more
willing to follow the lead of other
institutions than develop untried
programs, Little 11 resolutions
backed by working examples at other
schools would be more likely to be
implemented, conference organiz
ers felt.
For instance, the Committee on
Academics and Advising passed a re
solution calling for more innovative
educational programs and urging
that these programs, such as com
munity outreach and overseas
studies, should be made an integral
part of a liberal arts education. Back
ing this resolution will be reports de
tailing existing programs at 10 major
institutions.
Another example was a resolution
passed by the Subcommittee on
Energy and Ecology, part of the
Committee on Social and Political Af
fairs, which stated that universities
should serve as models for environ
mental action for the community,
and should begin research in imple
menting programs in recycling and
conservation.
The subcommittee put forward

Stanford's programs in these areas as
models for the other schools.
Other committees did not go so
well. The Student Government
committee seemed to be the most
chaotic and disorganized of the eight
at the conference, and because few
of the schools represented had any
substantial student government, the
committee had little information to
work with. So little, in fact, that one
Harvard delegate called the ASSU
government "Utopian."
The committee produced a resolu
tion calling for a student member on
each school's board of trustees,
which Cornell already has. However,
the committee produced little else of
a specific nature.

students could meet to discuss their
common problems with all the latest
data at their fingertips. They could
compare the programs at the diffe
rent schools, and then in seeking
new solutions, they could combine
and revise bits and pieces of the old
programs, or even invent totally new
ones. When the delegates returned
to their schools they could push for
implementation of these new prog
rams with the weight on research on
their side.
At times, the conference showed
signs of living up to its potential. The
Committee on Tuition, Financial Aid,
and Admissions, one of eight con
ference committees, met one after
noon with the director of admissions
of the University of Pennsylvania. He
told them he believed that the declin
ing enrollment of minorities in Ivy
League schools was a result of minor
ity students choj jng to enroll in
predominantly black colleges.
No sooner had he said this than a
delegate from Brown pulled out a
folder and began reading admissions
on where minorities admitted to
Brown had eventually decided to en
roll. Only one had gone to a black
college. The admininstrator
promptly withdrew his theory and
promised to look into the problem
more closely.
Another proferred justification of
the conference was that delegates
could propose policies that were
merely adaptations of pre-exisiting
programs elsewhere. Since univer
sity administrators are often more
willing to follow the lead of other
institutions than develop untried
programs, Little 11 resolutions
backed by working examples at other
schools would be more likely to be
implemented, conference organiz
ers felt.
For instance, the Committee on
Academics and Advising passed a re
solution calling for more innovative
educational programs and urging
that these programs, such as com
munity outreach and overseas
studies, should be made an integral
part of a liberal arts education. Back
ing this resolution will be reports de
tailing existing programs at 10 major
institutions.
Another example was a resolution
passed by the Subcommittee on
Energy and Ecology, part of the
Committee on Social and Political Af
fairs, which stated that universities
should serve as models for environ
mental action for the community,
and should begin research in imple
menting programs in recycling and
conservation.
The subcommittee put forward

Stanford's programs in these areas as
models for the other schools.
Other committees did not go so
well. The Student Government
committee seemed to be the most
chaotic and disorganized of the eight
at the conference, and because few
of the schools represented had any
substantial student government, the
committee had little information to
work with. So little, in fact, that one
Harvard delegate called the ASSU
government "Utopian."
The committee produced a resolu
tion calling for a student member on
each school's board of trustees,
which Cornell already has. However,
the committee produced little else of
a specific nature.
Perhaps it is indicative of the con
fusion that characterized the Little 11
conference that just about everyone
there had a different name for it.
Little 11 was of course wrong. MIT
dropped out weeks before the con
ference began leaving only 10
schools involved.
Others, like the hotel desk clerk
and those eastern delegates most
concerned with making their west
ern counterparts feel welcome,
called it the Ivy League conference.
The minority students who with
drew on the conference's last day cal
led it overtly and covertly racist.
Comments from other quarters
ranged from "elitist" to "a bunch of
self-serving, self-selected, Ivy
League demagogues."

One delegate, after viewing the
"stein"-studded list of last names on
the conference's planning commit
tee, toasted it as the world's biggest
Bar Mitzvah.
The Little 11 had definite prob
lems, from the original planning by
its directors to the preparation of
some of its delegates. But many
thought the idea behind it was
worthy, and even lames Grubbs,
co-chairman of the Minority Affairs
Committee, told the assembled con
vention delegates just after the start
of the minority boycott that "I be
lieve wholeheartedly in the idea of
this convention."
The Little 11 conference was con
ceived and organized by Leonard
Ginsburg, a student at the University
of Pennsylvania, and a small group of
other students from Ivy League
schools.

Its purpose, as stated in the con
ference orientation manual, was to
be an "exchange of ideas, informa
tion, programs, and perspectives on
student issues" between know
ledgeable students from different
schools. Delegates from Brown,
Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Har
vard, Princeton, Stanford, the Uni
versity of Chicago, the University of
Pennsylvania and Yale attended.
The goal of the conference was to
assemble groups of students who
had each carefully researched how
their university had dealt with
specific student problems. They
would prepare reports on their find
ings and send them to their fellow
delegates at other schools before the
conference began.
