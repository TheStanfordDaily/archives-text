# Little 11 produces mixed results

Perhaps it is indicative of the con
fusion that characterized the Little 11
conference that just about everyone
there had a different name for it.
Little 11 was of course wrong. MIT
dropped out weeks before the con
ference began leaving only 10
schools involved.
Others, like the hotel desk clerk
and those eastern delegates most
concerned with making their west
ern counterparts feel welcome,
called it the Ivy League conference.
The minority students who with
drew on the conference's last day cal
led it overtly and covertly racist.
Comments from other quarters
ranged from "elitist" to "a bunch of
self-serving, self-selected, Ivy
League demagogues."

One delegate, after viewing the
"stein"-studded list of last names on
the conference's planning commit
tee, toasted it as the world's biggest
Bar Mitzvah.
The Little 11 had definite prob
lems, from the original planning by
its directors to the preparation of
some of its delegates. But many
thought the idea behind it was
worthy, and even lames Grubbs,
co-chairman of the Minority Affairs
Committee, told the assembled con
vention delegates just after the start
of the minority boycott that "I be
lieve wholeheartedly in the idea of
this convention."
The Little 11 conference was con
ceived and organized by Leonard
Ginsburg, a student at the University
of Pennsylvania, and a small group of
other students from Ivy League
schools.

Its purpose, as stated in the con
ference orientation manual, was to
be an "exchange of ideas, informa
tion, programs, and perspectives on
student issues" between know
ledgeable students from different
schools. Delegates from Brown,
Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Har
vard, Princeton, Stanford, the Uni
versity of Chicago, the University of
Pennsylvania and Yale attended.
The goal of the conference was to
assemble groups of students who
had each carefully researched how
their university had dealt with
specific student problems. They
would prepare reports on their find
ings and send them to their fellow
delegates at other schools before the
conference began.
Then, when Little 11 convened,
students could meet to discuss their
common problems with all the latest
data at their fingertips. They could
compare the programs at the diffe
rent schools, and then in seeking
new solutions, they could combine
and revise bits and pieces of the old
programs, or even invent totally new
ones. When the delegates returned
to their schools they could push for
implementation of these new prog
rams with the weight on research on
their side.
At times, the conference showed
signs of living up to its potential. The
Committee on Tuition, Financial Aid,
and Admissions, one of eight con
ference committees, met one after
noon with the director of admissions
of the University of Pennsylvania. He
told them he believed that the declin
ing enrollment of minorities in Ivy
League schools was a result of minor
