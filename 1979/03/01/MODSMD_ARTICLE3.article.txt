# Rodin statues verified as valuable art casts
## 
### Robin Millington 
Although the University possesses
a number of Rodin statues cast after
Rodin's death, the statues in the
Stanford Art Museum collection are
accurately identified as posthumous
casts and are worth the $} million
they are currently assessed at, said
|ohn Schwartz, lawyer for the Uni
versity.
Schwartz was responding to a
statement made recently by Charles
Hawkins, attorney for George Schat
tle who is suing Art Prof. Albert Elsen
for libel. Hawkins said that "Stanford
might be holding million worth in
fakes," the values of the statues
being "based on the opinions of its
(the University's) own sources who it
considers experts."
Elsen is being sued for libel be
cause of the contents of a August
1977 letter he wrote to lerry Jensen of
KC.O-TV claiming that Sc hattle and a
man named Peter Stahl "have been
trying to con unsuspecting
businessmen into buying four repu
tedly unique Rodin Sculptures. . ."
"It's not accurate to say that the
Stanford collection contains any
fakes, but let me leave it at that,"
Schwartz said. "We purport that the
Stanford collection is actually worth
what it is claimed to be."
Experts differ on their interpreta
tions of what might be considered
fake. Some believe that the casts or
bronze sculptures made and au
thorized by the*Mi/sei;m Rodin after
Rodin's death are authentic and
therefore have a large monetary
value.
A differing opinion is that only
casts authorized and produced
under Rodin's supervision during his
lifetime can be considered authentic
or original.
Prof. John Merryman, who teaches
a course in "Art and the Law" with
Elsen, said that Hawkins' statement
"is contrary to what most people be
lieve who know anything about what
the collector (who originally donated
the sculptures to the museum) has
done in the way of collecting Rodins

and anything about Prof. Elsen, who
has done extensive work in connec
tion with Rodin.
"Basically it is a lawyer who has not
shown any credibility as an art histo
rian or scholar making a statement
about a collection built up by an out
standing Rodin scholar."
Merryman also said that though
the value of a posthumous cast may
be in question, "that does not lead to
calling a posthumous cast a fake."
Hawkins said he believes that if the
libel suit against Elsen is not settled in
a month or two the case might
lead into discussion of this issue.
Elsen refused to comment on why
he wrote the letter.
lensen said that he had no com
munication with Elsen prior to receiv
ing the letter.
"I have no idea in Cod's name
what led him to write that letter. He
may have heard from other sources
that I may have done research that
could lead to something embarras
sing," he said.
Elsen also refused to comment on
his allegations that Schattle and Stahl
have been working together to
"con" people into buying the four
sculptures.
However, in the letter to Jensen,
Elsen speaks of a manuscript titled
Rodin: Portrait of a Fraud written by
Friedrich Hasek, a man Elsen said he
believes is actually Stahl, a San )ose
resident. In his letter Elsen claims
"Stahl has put together a manuscript
that libels Rodin."
A major question as to how the
letter became known to Schattle also
remains unanswered.
lensen said that "I frankly don't
know how the letter was released."
lensen said that he also has no
knowledge of where the manuscript
mentioned in the letter is and no one
else involved in the case claims
knowledge of its whereabouts.
Hawkins said that he did not know
if his client had the original copy of
the letter and lensen said that he did
not know whether or not he had the
original letter in his possession.

bronze sculptures made and au
thorized by the*Mi/sei;m Rodin after
Rodin's death are authentic and
therefore have a large monetary
value.
A differing opinion is that only
casts authorized and produced
under Rodin's supervision during his
lifetime can be considered authentic
or original.
Prof. John Merryman, who teaches
a course in "Art and the Law" with
Elsen, said that Hawkins' statement
"is contrary to what most people be
lieve who know anything about what
the collector (who originally donated
the sculptures to the museum) has
done in the way of collecting Rodins

and anything about Prof. Elsen, who
has done extensive work in connec
tion with Rodin.
"Basically it is a lawyer who has not
shown any credibility as an art histo
rian or scholar making a statement
about a collection built up by an out
standing Rodin scholar."
Merryman also said that though
the value of a posthumous cast may
be in question, "that does not lead to
calling a posthumous cast a fake."
Hawkins said he believes that if the
libel suit against Elsen is not settled in
a month or two the case might
lead into discussion of this issue.
Elsen refused to comment on why
he wrote the letter.
lensen said that he had no com
munication with Elsen prior to receiv
ing the letter.
"I have no idea in Cod's name
what led him to write that letter. He
may have heard from other sources
that I may have done research that
could lead to something embarras
sing," he said.
Elsen also refused to comment on
his allegations that Schattle and Stahl
have been working together to
"con" people into buying the four
sculptures.
However, in the letter to Jensen,
Elsen speaks of a manuscript titled
Rodin: Portrait of a Fraud written by
Friedrich Hasek, a man Elsen said he
believes is actually Stahl, a San )ose
resident. In his letter Elsen claims
"Stahl has put together a manuscript
that libels Rodin."
A major question as to how the
letter became known to Schattle also
remains unanswered.
lensen said that "I frankly don't
know how the letter was released."
lensen said that he also has no
knowledge of where the manuscript
mentioned in the letter is and no one
else involved in the case claims
knowledge of its whereabouts.
Hawkins said that he did not know
if his client had the original copy of
the letter and lensen said that he did
not know whether or not he had the
original letter in his possession.
