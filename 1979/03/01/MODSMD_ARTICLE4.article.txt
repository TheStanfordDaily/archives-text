# Mayfield, Lomita road changes to divert some University traffic
## 
### Lee Tien 
A major rerouting of traffic around the University
perimeter is the desired effect of a plan to close part of
Mayfield Avenue while extending and expanding Lomita
Drive, )ohn Lerry, manager for construction and en
gineering, announced Tuesday.
Under the plan to divert traffic from Mayfield, cars on
Campus Drive would no longer be able to turn onto the
road in front of the Robert Moore houses. Instead, a
new road would be built connecting Lomita Drive with
Campus.
The plan's announcement brought immediate nega
tive responses from fraternities housed along the prop
osed route. Alpha Delta Phi and Kappa Alpha fraternities
expressed dissatisfaction with the plan which would cut
into recreation space in and around their houses.
The construction will begin during the summer, ac
cording to Lerry. "Right after commencement is usually
a good time," since the number of students and faculty
on campus drops sharply, he said.
Lerry said he hoped the construction would be com
pleted by the time students return in the fall.
The plan requires blocking off Mayfield Avenue bet
ween the corner of Mayfield and Campus and the "dog
leg" corner of Mayfield where the row house 558
Mayfield is located. Cars en route to the Tresidder park
ing lot would use Lomita Drive and turn left onto
Mayfield.
Lerry said the plan is budgeted for $273,000.
Director of Planning Philip Williams said the proposal
has been under consideration for "six or seven years at
least." The construction of the Robert Moore houses
(558 Maytield, American Studies House and Casa
Italiana) "brought it (the plan) into focus," Williams said.
The Lomita extension by itself was approved by the
Board of Trustees last spring as part of its General Plant
Improvement Program, Williams said.

However, the decision to close Maytield to traffic was
made last November by the University's Committee on
Land and Buildings Development, according to Assoc.
Food Research Prof. Scott Pearson. The plan will create a
mall with two ends closed to traffic. However, no funds
have yet been budgeted for completion of the mall,
Pearson said.
Another member of the committee, Director of
Community Relations Andrew Doty, said there were two
major concerns in the University's decision.
"One concern the University has is the protection of
the Row," Doty said. The increasing amount of traffic
along Maytield posed problems for the residences
whose access was therefore hindered, he said.
Safety was another concern, Doty said. He said "they
(the committee) were persuaded that the Mayfield prob
lem was a dangerous one."
More than 9000 vehicles travel along Mayfield every
day, Lerry said. With the large number of pedestrians
and bicyclists who use Mayfield to reach the inner cam
pus, great safety problems exist, he said.
The vehicles which currently use Mayfield would
reach campus via the Lomita extension, which would
run between the Knoll and several residences near Lake
Lagunita, such as Alpha Delta Phi, Kappa Alpha, Zeta Psi
and Lambda Nu.
"They're just transferring the problem from Mayfield
to us," said Scott Martin, an Alpha Delt.
Martin said he was uncertain why no input was re
quested from the student groups who would be most
affected by the plan.
"We feel the University is trying to slide this under our
noses. They've been working on it for years, but they
just told us about it yesterday (Tuesday)," Martin said.
The Alpha Delts are attempting to organize protests
among the living groups and departments who would be
affected by the plan, Martin said.
