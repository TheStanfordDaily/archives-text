# Increased law minority enrollment favored
##

Minority enrollment at the Law School is too low
and must be increased, according to both admis
sion officials and minority students here.
"I'm not satisfied with the number of minority
students. I think there ought to be more," said
Prof. William Cohen, outgoing chairman of the
Admissions Committee.
"Three percent black students is not enough,"
agreed Clarence Otis )r., president of the Black
American Law Students Association.
What the two groups don't agree on is why the
current percentage of minority students is so low
and how to increase that percentage in the future.
The facts about current levels of minority en
rollment speak plainly. From a high of about 20
percent in 1973, the percentage of minorities en
rolled dropped to 9.4 percent last year.
In 1977, minority enrollment at Harvard was 14
percent, at Yale 11.1 percent and at Stanford 7.5
percent, according to the admission department.
The total enrollment at these schools, as with Col
umbia and Chicago, is much larger than Stan
ford's, thus their total minority populations are
significantly greater.
Admissions office figures show that fewer
minority students are applying to Stanford, and
fewer of those who are accepted are choosing to
come. Despite recruitment efforts, as of one week
before the March 1 application deadline, 87 fewer
minority applications have been received than the
total from last year. Of the 50 minority candidates
who were accepted last year, only 19 enrolled.
Under the current admissions policy, scores on
the Law School Aptitude Test (LSAT) and under
graduate grade point average (CPA) results were

given heavy emphasis. These numbers are placed
in a formula which assigns a proxy rating to the
quality of the candidate's undergraduate institu
tion and predicts a relative first-year law school
CPA.
Approximately 60 percent of the candidates are
disqualified at this point based on the numerical
cut-off chosen by the committee.
Affirmative action taken by the Admissions
Committee involves admitting all minority stu
dents whose predicted first-year law school CPAs
are within 3/10 of a point of the lower range of
non-minority students admitted the year before.
Cohen then has the discretion to admit those
minority candidates whose records as a whole he
judges are "substantially equal" to those already
admitted.
Otis has charged that the Law School's affirma
tive action program "sounds to me like plain old
racial discrimination.
"All Stanford is providing the minority students
they admit under the affirmative action program is
the alternative between going to Stanford and any
number of law schools they would also be able to
get into," he said.
A major factor behind the relatively small
number of "qualified "minority candidates is the
LSAT itself, which Otis says is "almost certainly
biased against black people." He pointed to the
recent results of the December LSAT, which
showed that only 14 minority students in the coun
try scored higher than 700, as proof of his asser
tion.
Here the low number of minority students has
created a Catch-22 situation in which the minority
students accepted prefer to enter other schools

where the minority populations are significantly
higher, Otis said.
"We're concerned with overhauling the whole
admissions process," Otis said. "We think admis
sions shouldn't be a one-man process, as it is at
Stanford. We think the dean of student affairs
(LaDoris Cordell) should have input to the final
admissions decisions. We think students should
have at least an advisory capacity in admissions
and should have an evaluating function over the
admissions process."
In addition, Otis wants to demonstrate to minor
ity applicants that there is a supportive minority
community here.
"There is no evidence that the LSAT is less pre
dictive of law school performance or professional
success for blacks or other minorities," Cohen
said.
Cohen said he sees recruitment of minority
candidates and admittees as the most immediate
answer to the problem. But he concedes that it is
hard to get minority students to come to a school
where the population of minorities is small.
A numerical cut-off is necessary, he argues, be
cause of the large number of applications and the
limited resources of the admissions committee.
He said he fears that the effect of significantly
lowering this numerical cut-off point would be a
"clustering" of the less-qualified minorities admit
ted in the bottom half of the class.
Cohen indicated that the Admissions Commit
tee has no inclination to change the admission
policy this year. "The individual decisions on ad
missions are made by the chairman. That's been
our process and continues to be our process," he
said.
