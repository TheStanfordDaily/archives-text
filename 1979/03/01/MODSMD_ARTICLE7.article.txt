# Biz students assist local taxpayers

### Shirley Gines 
Some business students
here have a lot ot heart. Every
Saturday until April students
are helping low-income
people in East Palo Alto to till
out their income tax return
forms, free of charge, the stu
dents are all Volunteer Income
Taxpayer Assistants (VITA)
trained under a volunteer In
ternal Revenue Service agent.
The course preparation takes
eight hours, plus outside study
time.
"I never even filled out a tax
form before, said Allan
Schmerler, a first year business
student here. He is now one of

the volunteers.
The volunteer's job, accord
ing to second year business
student Connie Lau, is to go
over the returns with the tax
payers and answer their ques
tions. Other tax services, like El
\ R Block usually take all the
materials and hand them back
completed, she explained.
But the VITA volunteers "teach
the c iti/ens how to prepare
their returns."
"Sometimes it's ver\ com
plicated,'' Schmerler said. "I'm
trying to get for these people as
much money as they can get
from the IRS."
The volunteer program was
started in 1970 by the Asian

Business Student Association.
At that time, students predo
minantly helped low-income
people in Chinatown in San
Francisco. The project later
moved to East Palo Alto for the
students' convenience so they
would "?.6t have to commute
far. Since the East Palo Alto
population is primarily black,
Lau explained, the black stu
dents felt that they should take
control of the operation. The
program is now moving trom
the hands of the Asian students
to the Black Business Student
Association.
"The program is for those
who would not ordinarily have
access to income tax advice,"

Lau said. "We service 20 to 25
people on Saturdays from 10 to
2. We get so many people, we
must close the doors at 2 p.m.
We're hoping to serve about
175 people this year."
So far, Lau said, the program
has not been opened to the en
tire University because there
are enough volunteering busi
ness students. "There's a pos
sibility that undergraduates
might be able to form their
own program," Lau said.
And what do the volunteers
get in return?
"It feels good to help other
people. And it's good diver
sion from schoolwork,"
Schmerler said.
