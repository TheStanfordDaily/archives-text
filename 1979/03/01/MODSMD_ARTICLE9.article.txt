## Editorial The 						17 percent solution 
### 
The ASSU Senate is currently consid
ering a number of election reforms in an
effort to make student government
more responstoe to student concerns.
The current preoccupation of the senate
with the national boycott of the Adolph
Coors Co. is an excellent example of why
such reform is so necessary.
For over a month now the senate has
devoted an inordinate amount of time
debating whether or not to join the
boycott against Coors, from whom the
Publications Board, Special Events and
the Recycling Center all receive re
venue. The debate has centered on
whether allegations of unfair labor prac
tices against Coors are true or not, a
complex issue that neither management
nor labor at Coors has been able to de
finitively settle in the two years since the
initial dispute first broke out.
But apparent complexity did not deter
the senate. Instead of relying on conflict
ing second-hand reports, they simply
decided at their last meeting two weeks
ago to send a task force to the Coors
brewery in Golden, Colorado to find out
"the truth." What made the decision
even more simple was that Coors was
willing to finance the trip and there were
only five senators present when the task
force proposal was finally put to a vote at
1:30 a.m.
Perhaps in the heat of the debate that
night the five senators failed to consider
adequately how a five-person
student task force with little or
no background knowledge could, in a
single weekend, be able to determine
who was right and who was wrong in a
dispute that has dragged on for years.
A more serious point the senators
failed to consider, however, is how a
vote of only 17 percent of the senate
could be construed as meaningful or
representative of the thinking of the
senate as a whole or of the senate's con
stituency. With the current low credibil

ity of the senate and its public commit
ment to reform, this type of action can
only reflect poorly on the senate.
Absent senators are just as culpable.
Admittedly the hour was late, but public
office carries with it responsibilities that
include a certain amount of inconveni
ence. If senators don't consider the
Coors issue worthy of their time, they
should absent the issue, not themselves,
from senate meetings.
The final result of the meeting was that
the task force was formed and dis
patched. They will present their report
today to the senate. The senate will also
hear a background report today from a
member of the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility on divestment of
ASSU funds from University Merge
Pool B, a report they were supposed to
have heard two weeks ago, but which
was postponed because of the lengthy
discussion on Coors.
This is perhaps the most serious con
sideration of all for the senate. Time
spent on Coors means delays or hurried
treatment of other senate business.
The senate this year has shown an unfor
tunate instinct for attacking complex is
sues with only a marginal relevance to
student concerns here. The complicated
nature of the plight of Pakistani Presi
dent AM Bhutto, the alleged practice of
double-billing at the hospital and now
the Coors boycott demand large
amounts of time for intelligent action.
Such issues have questionable value in
terms of practical impact on both stu
dents and other parties involved.
For a student senate intent on greater
responsiveness to student concerns, the
choice of issues to be dealt with is cru
cial. Two members of the senate's Coors
task force have already indicated they
would not support a boycott. We urge
the rest of the task force and the senate
to follow their lead and drop the Coors
issue.
