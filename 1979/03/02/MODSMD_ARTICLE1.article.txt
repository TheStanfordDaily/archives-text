# Becker predicts Special Events profit
## Senate approves Ellsberg as spring guest prof 
### Rob Lempert Dianne Cahoon 
Daniel Ellsberg, renowned for his role in
the Pentagon Papers case, will be offered a
guest professorship position here next
quarter. The ASSU Senate voted last night
to extend that academic post to Ellsberg
but tabled a similar resolution to proffer a
guest professorship to American Indian
Movement leader Dennis Banks.
The senate also approved the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board's recommen
dation of a $6000 salary for Ellsberg's two
course schedule. The decision to hire
Banks will take precedence as a special
order of the day at the top of the senate's
agenda for its Dead Week meeting.
Following a brief presentation by Guest
Professorship Board chairman Jay Modrall

and SWOPSI Co-director Lisa Foster, the
senators focused their debate upon the
qualifications of the two men, particularly
those of Banks.
In other senate business, Project Direc
tor Brian Becker said ASSU Special Events
should turn a profit by the end of this year.
Becker presented the senate with the
latest Special Events financial statement
which showed the group is approximately
$3500 to $4000 in the red for the year so far.
Becker described this figure as "very
good."
Special Events has been a consistent
money loser over the years. Last year it lost
$27,000.
According to Becker, Special Events has
historically suffered most of its losses near
the beginning of the year but usually does

much better in the spring. This year the
project group had a net loss of $10,000
after fall quarter, but has made approxi
mately $6000 since then.
Becker said that several improvements
have been made in the Special Events op
eration this year. The staff has been en
larged from three to 15 and the project
manager is now officially scheduled to be
chosen in February, giving him or her five
months of on-the-job training.
However, the new manager has not
been chosen for next year. Becker prom
ised the selection will be made over the
weekend.
The senate also heard a report by Dan
Williams, director of Tresidder Union who
said he and his staff are in the process of
setting up two student boards to provide

for student input in the operation of the
center.
Senator Ron Johnson succinctly stated
the major dilemma faced by the senate
when he asked, "Who was Banks before
Wounded Knee, and who was Ellsberg be
fore Pentagon Papers?" Senator Dave
Steuer added, "I think a lot of things we
decide here are bullshit, but this is real
ity."
Ultimately, Ellsberg's qualifications
were deemed appropriate for his pro
jected three-unit lecture and five-unit
seminar classes on nucleararmamentsand
foreign policy. Foster cited Ellsberg's
Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard and his
former employment by Rand Corporation.
Banks' application was sponsored by
Anthropology Prof. George Spindler on

the grounds that, among other merits,
"Banks has more first hand experience in
Indian-white confrontations than anyone I
know." Yet, senator ErikThompson noted
that Banks was convicted in South Dakota
on charges of riot, riot while armed and
assault with a deadly weapon.
The senate also passed a finance com
mittee resolution to place a $2 program fee
assessment on the spring quarter ballot. If
approved by student vote, the assessment
will be levied next autumn quarter.
lohnson told the senate that
the official report of the task force sent to
the Coors brewery in Golden, Colorado
will be ready in two weeks, lohnson said
that "it is the unanimous opinion of the
task force that the decision to boycott
must be a personal one."
