Dear Bug Me:
When is the old Ryan lab scheduled to be torn
down? Am I correct in that it is now only used for
storage?
-P.R.
The Ryan lab, located on Stanford Ave. in the
faculty ghetto, is only used to store a small
amount of engineering equipment, according
to Susan Schofield, assistant provost. The lab
has not been used for experiments since the
Terman Engineering Center opened in the fall of
1977. "The University has no definite plans for
tearing the lab down — its future is still in
limbo," she said.
Many homeowners in the area would like to
see it demolished, according to Bob Summers,
manager of faculty and staff housing. He added
that other homeowners have agreed that unless
part of the structure is used to house a commun
ity center, the site should be cleared to create
more open space.
The lab was built in the early 1920s and was
named after Harris Ryan, a pioneer in high vol
tage electrical transmission, said Frederick Ter
man, a former dean of the School of Engineering
and a student of Ryan's.

Dear Bug Me: ,
One of my friends living in an Escondido
high-rise has asked the management to repair
the intercom and buzzer system used for letting
friends in the front door. So far there has been
no action on this, and I'll offer to help fix it
myself should it come to that. What's the next
step?
-L.K.H.
Her buzzer will be fixed, said Terry
McGovern, assistant manager of operations at
Escondido Village apartments, and he re
quested other residents with similar complaints
to call him. Since the intercom system is on its
last legs after 15 years with us, it will either be

completely overhauled or replaced by May 15,
he said.
Dear Bug Me:
A Daily story on Ram's Head noted that it
combined with the Chaparral to raise 50percent
of the funds that built Memorial Auditorium. If
this is so, why do student groups have to pay for
its usage if they helped build it?
-T.L.C.
Under a policy passed in early January and
retroactively effective to last September, use
fees are no longer charged. Vicky Holt, director
of Public Events, said the old fee schedule, with
a different charge for each of the 10 facilities on
campus, "bore no relation to anything" and
were a financial burden on small groups. Fees
are still charged for clean-up, hiring technicians
and audio-visual use.
Dear Bug Me:
Is there a place on campus besides Tresidder
that I can get a good cup of coffee?
-A. P.
Following is a list of food and drink places With
their Monday through Friday hours. (Note: I
don't guarantee they serve good coffee.)
Medical School lounge: 10:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m.;
Mud and Nuts (Terman Engineering): 8:30
a.m.-3 p.m.; People's Teahouse (Junipero
House, Wilbur Hall): 9 p.m.-midnight; Poli-Sci
