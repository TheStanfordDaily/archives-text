## How the Daily covers rape 
### 
Rape. Mention of the word instantly touches a
nerve around here — and for good reason. To
many people, rape is the most abhorred crime in
society. Unlike any other crime, rape marks not
only the assailant, but the victim as well.
The Daily has been criticized in the past for its
rape coverage. Some say we do not report rapes
which have occurred. Other say we help to
create a false "rape phobia" because of our "ex
tensive" coverage of rape-related organizations
and meetings. Others say we should not report
the subject at all. Others accuse us of sen
sationalizing rape stories. Others complain we
are too sedate and withhold pertinent informa
tion.
m 1 doubt we will ever satisfy everyone on this
Issue, but because of the Daily's concern for the
safety of members of the community here', we
will continue to report rape. I believe it would
bd instructive for me to outline our general pol
icy on reporting rape incidents and meetings
arid organizations concerned with the rape
problem here.
.To label these as policies is new; however,
|oyr procedure on handling rape coverage has
not changed. Most of the policies outlined
below have been standard operating proce-
for years.
Readers should note that the Daily has as
signed a large amount of editorial space to the
rape subject, especially in the past year. Our
conservative estimates of space are that approx
imately 10 full broadsheet pages, including a
;two-page rape forum run last spring, have been
• published.
! Ten pages is the equivalent of one average
Daily without advertising. Few subjects have re
ceived this amount of space on news, features
aqd opinions pages in recent history.
• It is for this reason that we simply reject any
statement that the Daily has failed to fulfill a
cdmmitment to our readers to keep them in
formed on this all-important issue.
Indeed, the Daily has acted more like a broad
caster than a newspaper when it comes to the
rape issue. Broadcasters are required by law to
assess the major proWems in their "market
area" and produce a certain amount of broad
casting from their public affairs department to
educate the public on the issue. The Daily has
needed no coercion — from the laworany other
; source.
As for charges that we withhold reports of
rapes, attempted rapes or other sex-related
crimes on campus, we again must reject the
charge.
Some groups here report that several rapes
have occurred on campus this year. We cannot
dispute the allegations. But all we can verify is
the one rape and one attempted rape which
were reported to police. Both of these attacks
were reported in our pages.
A great deal of frustration results here from
dealing with irate callers who claim they heard
from a third source that a rape occurred some
where on campus and accuse us of withholding
Ihe information. Usually these people cannot
give us such basic details as the date, time and
place of the alleged assault.
Our responsibility to the public for complete
and accurate reporting make it impossible for
such reports to appear in the Daily.
When the victims themselves do not report
the incidents to the authorities, we cannot re
port them in our pages because unverifiable
reports of any crime are nothing more than
hearsay. Therefore, unless we can substantiate
an alleged incident with a police report, which is
a public record available for inspection by the
public, we will not report the incident.
That brings us to the most important issue:
reporting actual rapes and attempted rapes.

Generally, police authorities notify our news
office of any on-campus assaults. Police have a
vested interest in getting press coverage of rape
and other violent crimes for several reasons.
Information published in the press some
times produces witnesses who can help ap
prehend assailants. Press coverage also makes
the community aware that a problem exists.
Education about and awareness of a problem
often helps to alleviate it.
For example, police specifically request that
we publish descriptions of assailants, if they are
available, because often a suspect can be iden
tified through the published description.
At the same time, the victim's privacy must be
protected. It is important that a victim report the
crime if it is to be solved, but victims must also
be protected against society's stigma against
rape victims.
It is a balancing of these two concerns —
educating the public and aiding the police, and
protecting the privacy of the victim — that
makes reporting rape such a delicate process.
So, in general, the Daily will not report the
victim's name or any other information which
would make identification of the victim easy but
would not add to the story substantially.
Such information might include the victim's
residence. This is a gray area, however, because
in some cases certain information could both
help prevent an additional incident but could
also invade the victim's privacy — not from a
legal standpoint, but from an ethical one.
The Daily does intend to publish descriptions
released by authorities and any other informa
tion they consider helpful to their investigation.
Note that our purpose is to help apprehend
rapists and prevent future rapes, not to subject
victims to additional mental anguish and stress
or to aid criminals in their efforts to evade the
police.
The exact nature of a given rape report in our
paper requires editorial judgement which only
we can supply. This is not because we consider
ourselves an omnipotent body with all the
answers. Rather, it is a legal issue. Our editors
are legally responsible for the content of this
paper. Since there is always the possibility of a
legal action against us, we simply cannot relin
quish our control over content to any degree.
Be assured that we will exercise all due discre
tion in these matters. We are not out "to get"
anyone — except the alleged rapist. Our motive
is to inform the public and aid the authorities.
An understanding of our policies and assis
tance in informing the community about sex
related crimes is an important step toward the
apprehension of rapists and the prevention of
future rapes.
Reporters will not attempt to contact victims.
Sources for stories will be police and administra
tion officials. There has never been and never
will be a Daily reporter breaking down a victim's
door to get an "exclusive" interview. Never will
a photographer be "looking for the terrific pic
ture."
Such delusions are ridiculous. We have no
reason to want to do something like that,
though I should note we are within the legal
bounds of privacy law to report names and de
tails in rape cases. But such activities would
serve no purpose. We do not sell the paper; it is
circulated free to the community. Sen
sationalism, spicy quotes, banner headlines and
the like are not only not our style, they are our
antithesis.
In reporting rape and other news on campus,
our motive is to serve our readers. We wish to
do so objectively and fairly. Charges that some
thing more (or less) is deliberately involved in
our coverage are simply untrue.

The exact nature of a given rape report in our
paper requires editorial judgement which only
we can supply. This is not because we consider
ourselves an omnipotent body with all the
answers. Rather, it is a legal issue. Our editors
are legally responsible for the content of this
paper. Since there is always the possibility of a
legal action against us, we simply cannot relin
quish our control over content to any degree.
Be assured that we will exercise all due discre
tion in these matters. We are not out "to get"
anyone — except the alleged rapist. Our motive
is to inform the public and aid the authorities.
An understanding of our policies and assis
tance in informing the community about sex
related crimes is an important step toward the
apprehension of rapists and the prevention of
future rapes.
Reporters will not attempt to contact victims.
Sources for stories will be police and administra
tion officials. There has never been and never
will be a Daily reporter breaking down a victim's
door to get an "exclusive" interview. Never will
a photographer be "looking for the terrific pic
ture."
Such delusions are ridiculous. We have no
reason to want to do something like that,
though I should note we are within the legal
bounds of privacy law to report names and de
tails in rape cases. But such activities would
serve no purpose. We do not sell the paper; it is
circulated free to the community. Sen
sationalism, spicy quotes, banner headlines and
the like are not only not our style, they are our
antithesis.
In reporting rape and other news on campus,
our motive is to serve our readers. We wish to
do so objectively and fairly. Charges that some
thing more (or less) is deliberately involved in
our coverage are simply untrue.

Rape. Mention of the word instantly touches a
nerve around here — and for good reason. To
many people, rape is the most abhorred crime in
society. Unlike any other crime, rape marks not
only the assailant, but the victim as well.
The Daily has been criticized in the past for its
rape coverage. Some say we do not report rapes
which have occurred. Other say we help to
create a false "rape phobia" because of our "ex
tensive" coverage of rape-related organizations
and meetings. Others say we should not report
the subject at all. Others accuse us of sen
sationalizing rape stories. Others complain we
are too sedate and withhold pertinent informa
tion.
m 1 doubt we will ever satisfy everyone on this
Issue, but because of the Daily's concern for the
safety of members of the community here', we
will continue to report rape. I believe it would
bd instructive for me to outline our general pol
icy on reporting rape incidents and meetings
arid organizations concerned with the rape
problem here.
.To label these as policies is new; however,
|oyr procedure on handling rape coverage has
not changed. Most of the policies outlined
below have been standard operating proce-
for years.
Readers should note that the Daily has as
signed a large amount of editorial space to the
rape subject, especially in the past year. Our
conservative estimates of space are that approx
imately 10 full broadsheet pages, including a
;two-page rape forum run last spring, have been
• published.
! Ten pages is the equivalent of one average
Daily without advertising. Few subjects have re
ceived this amount of space on news, features
aqd opinions pages in recent history.
• It is for this reason that we simply reject any
statement that the Daily has failed to fulfill a
cdmmitment to our readers to keep them in
formed on this all-important issue.
Indeed, the Daily has acted more like a broad
caster than a newspaper when it comes to the
rape issue. Broadcasters are required by law to
assess the major proWems in their "market
area" and produce a certain amount of broad
casting from their public affairs department to
educate the public on the issue. The Daily has
needed no coercion — from the laworany other
; source.
As for charges that we withhold reports of
rapes, attempted rapes or other sex-related
crimes on campus, we again must reject the
charge.
Some groups here report that several rapes
have occurred on campus this year. We cannot
dispute the allegations. But all we can verify is
the one rape and one attempted rape which
were reported to police. Both of these attacks
were reported in our pages.
A great deal of frustration results here from
dealing with irate callers who claim they heard
from a third source that a rape occurred some
where on campus and accuse us of withholding
Ihe information. Usually these people cannot
give us such basic details as the date, time and
place of the alleged assault.
Our responsibility to the public for complete
and accurate reporting make it impossible for
such reports to appear in the Daily.
When the victims themselves do not report
the incidents to the authorities, we cannot re
port them in our pages because unverifiable
reports of any crime are nothing more than
hearsay. Therefore, unless we can substantiate
an alleged incident with a police report, which is
a public record available for inspection by the
public, we will not report the incident.
That brings us to the most important issue:
reporting actual rapes and attempted rapes.

Generally, police authorities notify our news
office of any on-campus assaults. Police have a
vested interest in getting press coverage of rape
and other violent crimes for several reasons.
Information published in the press some
times produces witnesses who can help ap
prehend assailants. Press coverage also makes
the community aware that a problem exists.
Education about and awareness of a problem
often helps to alleviate it.
For example, police specifically request that
we publish descriptions of assailants, if they are
available, because often a suspect can be iden
tified through the published description.
At the same time, the victim's privacy must be
protected. It is important that a victim report the
crime if it is to be solved, but victims must also
be protected against society's stigma against
rape victims.
It is a balancing of these two concerns —
educating the public and aiding the police, and
protecting the privacy of the victim — that
makes reporting rape such a delicate process.
So, in general, the Daily will not report the
victim's name or any other information which
would make identification of the victim easy but
would not add to the story substantially.
Such information might include the victim's
residence. This is a gray area, however, because
in some cases certain information could both
help prevent an additional incident but could
also invade the victim's privacy — not from a
legal standpoint, but from an ethical one.
The Daily does intend to publish descriptions
released by authorities and any other informa
tion they consider helpful to their investigation.
Note that our purpose is to help apprehend
rapists and prevent future rapes, not to subject
victims to additional mental anguish and stress
or to aid criminals in their efforts to evade the
police.
