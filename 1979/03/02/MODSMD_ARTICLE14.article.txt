# The 						Stanford daily OPINIONS
## Bill Shirley Solving the Human Connection 
### 
(Last of a series)
Two years ago, a student left
Stanford to live with the fol
lowers of Sun Yung Moon for a
weekend, and as he had plan
ned in his earlier preparations
for this class project, he re
turned the following Monday.
But he did not plan for the de
pression and disillusionment
which followed.
Anxiously curious, he went
to discover the roots of the
persuasive techniques — the
brainwashing — used by this
group to secure converts. And
he went with a confidence
based on his satisfaction with
his life and his place at Stan
ford. He went a researcher. A
convert? Absolutely impossi
ble.
Yet when he entered their
camp, they overwhelmed him.
Not with mind-breaking prop
aganda, not with weakening
starvation, not with physical or
mental threats. They swept him
up in caring, touching, shar
ing, love, in seemingly uncon
ditional acceptance.
It overpowered him emo
tionally.Only his intellect, only
the knowledge that they lied to
him in denying any connec
tions to Moon, kept him wary

and allowed him to see the ac
ceptance slip with each ques
tion he raised. Emotionally
hooked, then intellectually
saved, he returned. But to
what?
He came back and saw the
place I have described in the
first two articles of this series.
With the unified concern and
caring of the previous
weekend in his mind, he
watched our lives anew. We
lived with each other but we
touched and experienced only
a restricted circle of friends.
And even in this, we were too
often critical and unsupportive
of one another.
We shied away from the rest
as we went our directed ways.
We felt fulfilled in our lives as
he once felt, yet now this ful
fillment was empty. We
rationed the human connec
tion here, and he knew it must
be more universal.
And so I feel. In these arti
cles, I have not intended to
imply that we all are isolated
and have no feel for closeness.
I know too well that is not true.
But I do shout out that we
hoard our out-reachings and
someof us livealoneforit. And
I fear our holding back finds its

roots in our society's competi
tiveness, its true disdain for fai
lure, and finds a rich soil in
which to grow here on the
Farm with our added intense
focus on individual perfor
mance.
So what can we do? How can
we approach the proposition
ot expanding ourselves to in
clude far many more people?
We are working with a
symptom of society's affliction,
focused here. Yet we are also
working in a system, the Univer
sity, where we emphasize
improvement-minded at
titudes, where we can restruc
ture all frames of living, from
the classroom to the dorm
room and all points in bet
ween. And, most importantly
and contrary to society at large,
we have a turnover every four
years and therefore have no
skeleton traditions hanging
around any longer than we
wish to pass them on.
But what of the faculty, ad
ministration and board of trus
tees that get in our way? Cer
tainly they hang around longer
than four years. I contend that
when faced with a unified and
supporting student body, they
have no choice but to act ac
cordingly. In the end, it is our
university, we are the Univer
sity — if enough of us want it
so.
Where to start? How about
informally in our dorms. Let's
start to discuss; let's meet in
the lounge and throw our
thoughts back and forth with
out stopping to wonder how
they will strike another, judg
ing from the survey I recently
gave, lots of people will be
throwing similar stuff.
I challenge one person or a
group in each living group,
dorm, fraternity, and row
house alike, to do as I hope to
do before the quarter is out.

Bring up the idea of discussion
— prod an interest if necessary
— but get some people to
gether to talk about the human
connection at Stanford Uni
versity. It is the most fascinat
ing topic around, and no one,
absolutely no one here does
not have something important
to say about it.
Get groups together and
have some sloppy fun. Or
ganize some mud football
after the next rain. No
one can concentrate too much
on self-image when covered
head to toe.
Try organizing a massage
group. We all love it when of
fered a back rub. Why not
make a regular practice of it?
The human touch communi
cates more fully and easily than
do words, arid everyone has
the touch.
I call on the Residence Edu
cation Office and Norm Robin
son to review this series of arti
cles and to re-view the stu
dents. I do not know how the
office works, yet I know it
holds the power to affect a
wide range of living changes.
Finally, each and all of us
needs to reach and touch
someone new today, and enjoy
the feeling of being touched
back. Do it several times —
even if it means simply banning
an expressionless face and
grinning at someone as you
pass. One will get you 10 they
will grin back.

sophomore.)

cates more fully and easily than
do words, arid everyone has
the touch.
I call on the Residence Edu
cation Office and Norm Robin
son to review this series of arti
cles and to re-view the stu
dents. I do not know how the
office works, yet I know it
holds the power to affect a
wide range of living changes.
Finally, each and all of us
needs to reach and touch
someone new today, and enjoy
the feeling of being touched
back. Do it several times —
even if it means simply banning
an expressionless face and
grinning at someone as you
pass. One will get you 10 they
will grin back.

Two years ago, a student left
Stanford to live with the fol
lowers of Sun Yung Moon for a
weekend, and as he had plan
ned in his earlier preparations
for this class project, he re
turned the following Monday.
But he did not plan for the de
pression and disillusionment
which followed.
Anxiously curious, he went
to discover the roots of the
persuasive techniques — the
brainwashing — used by this
group to secure converts. And
he went with a confidence
based on his satisfaction with
his life and his place at Stan
ford. He went a researcher. A
convert? Absolutely impossi
ble.
Yet when he entered their
camp, they overwhelmed him.
Not with mind-breaking prop
aganda, not with weakening
starvation, not with physical or
mental threats. They swept him
up in caring, touching, shar
ing, love, in seemingly uncon
ditional acceptance.
It overpowered him emo
tionally.Only his intellect, only
the knowledge that they lied to
him in denying any connec
tions to Moon, kept him wary

and allowed him to see the ac
ceptance slip with each ques
tion he raised. Emotionally
hooked, then intellectually
saved, he returned. But to
what?
He came back and saw the
place I have described in the
first two articles of this series.
With the unified concern and
caring of the previous
weekend in his mind, he
watched our lives anew. We
lived with each other but we
touched and experienced only
a restricted circle of friends.
And even in this, we were too
often critical and unsupportive
of one another.
We shied away from the rest
as we went our directed ways.
We felt fulfilled in our lives as
he once felt, yet now this ful
fillment was empty. We
rationed the human connec
tion here, and he knew it must
be more universal.
And so I feel. In these arti
cles, I have not intended to
imply that we all are isolated
and have no feel for closeness.
I know too well that is not true.
But I do shout out that we
hoard our out-reachings and
someof us livealoneforit. And
I fear our holding back finds its

roots in our society's competi
tiveness, its true disdain for fai
lure, and finds a rich soil in
which to grow here on the
Farm with our added intense
focus on individual perfor
mance.
So what can we do? How can
we approach the proposition
ot expanding ourselves to in
clude far many more people?
We are working with a
symptom of society's affliction,
focused here. Yet we are also
working in a system, the Univer
sity, where we emphasize
improvement-minded at
titudes, where we can restruc
ture all frames of living, from
the classroom to the dorm
room and all points in bet
ween. And, most importantly
and contrary to society at large,
we have a turnover every four
years and therefore have no
skeleton traditions hanging
around any longer than we
wish to pass them on.
But what of the faculty, ad
ministration and board of trus
tees that get in our way? Cer
tainly they hang around longer
than four years. I contend that
when faced with a unified and
supporting student body, they
have no choice but to act ac
cordingly. In the end, it is our
university, we are the Univer
sity — if enough of us want it
so.
Where to start? How about
informally in our dorms. Let's
start to discuss; let's meet in
the lounge and throw our
thoughts back and forth with
out stopping to wonder how
they will strike another, judg
ing from the survey I recently
gave, lots of people will be
throwing similar stuff.
I challenge one person or a
group in each living group,
dorm, fraternity, and row
house alike, to do as I hope to
do before the quarter is out.

Bring up the idea of discussion
— prod an interest if necessary
— but get some people to
gether to talk about the human
connection at Stanford Uni
versity. It is the most fascinat
ing topic around, and no one,
absolutely no one here does
not have something important
to say about it.
Get groups together and
have some sloppy fun. Or
ganize some mud football
after the next rain. No
one can concentrate too much
on self-image when covered
head to toe.
Try organizing a massage
group. We all love it when of
fered a back rub. Why not
make a regular practice of it?
