America
demystified
Bravo, it is nice to see young
Americans like you, Kurt
Cobb (Daily, Feb. 22) going
for the jugular. Your column
touches the very nerve center
ofcapitalistalienation. Itis nice
to see a student screaming into
the night sky "I can't take it
anymore."
The voracious appetite of
capitalism to buffer its agents
with things rather than the
makers-of-things is incredibly
clear in your article. If you go
on being this succinct they'll
soon call you a "commie."

Maybe you a re a young voice
in the wilderness ready to de
mystify America that things and
goods are the be all and the
end all. It is ironic, isn't it, to
see a self-sufficient American
who says he can do without
people but will switch on his
TV and radio sets immediately
when he withdraws into his
private cubicle — to be with
people, and yet not be with
them?
Inside that cubicle is a gigan
tic dose of paranoia pining for
the touch of human contact
but afraid to reach out.
But "Brother Can You Spare
A Dime" — those days are not
too faroff again. Iran is only the

beginning of a sobering-up of
people in a system suffering
from some of the worst dis
eases of human atomization
and alienation due to selfish
"growth."

Save the Dollies
The Dollies need help. The
casual observer might be
fooled by their seemingly
boundless energy and healthy
smiles, but we know better.
We are appalled that five
students, especially those who
represent the University to the
entire nation, should be vic
tims of abject poverty. It is in
excusable for the symbols of
one of the country's wealthiest
private institutions to be suffer
ing from malnutrition.
How can we stand by and
watch these girls starve them
selves? And furthermore,
would you let a friend of yours
wear the same clothes, shoes
and gloves week after week?
Something must be done now
to save the Dollies.
These girls are humiliated
before us time and time again
and they are too proud to seek
our help. It is up to us, the
thoughtful students of the Save
The Dollies campaign to take
action.
Charity begins at "home"
and you can help. A modest
$100 contribution (tax
deductible) would put us well
onourwaytobuyingthem new
shoes and possibly matching
handbags. Or why not deposit
that half-sandwich you are
about to throw away in one of
our round "Save the Dollies"
containers located conve
niently on the Stanford cam
pus?
Plans are being made for
"Save the Dollies" luncheons,
fashion shows and benefits.
Show your concern for our

noble ladies; support the Dol

What can we learn about
Elvis Costello from Ron Lil
lejord's (Daily, Feb. 15) review?
We are told that Costello
played 16 songs in 45 minutes,
that the audience applauded
for half an hour and that the
audience "said to itself" that
Costello is "a very weird guy."
We learn that the concert
was an "anti-show." We do not
learn what an "anti-show" is.
We do not learn what Costello
looked like. We do not learn
what he sings about. There is
no critical thought here — the
reviewer has dispensed with
this by omitting any informa
tion concerning the music.
The opinions that are given
are vague and clouded by con
ditional phrases. The article
begins by stating that the con
cert was "good while it lasted."
Later, it states that Costello
gave an "anti-show" (which
sounds pejorative, though I'm
just guessing at the meaning of
this phrase) with "no pacing or
showmanship to speak of."
The article ends with a dismis
sal of Costello: "Long live
disco! I guess." The reviewer
does not like him, I guess.
A music review should con
tain opinions backed up by crit
ical analysis. A rock concert
consists of songs, the per
former's motions, the staging
and the audience reaction. I
suggest that Lillejord study Jes
sica Chereskin's review on
"The Clash." She gives us opin
ions supported by analysis,

and places "The Clash," in a
social context.
Costello's talent is that he
shows our social conditions re
flected in the sphere of per
sonal relationships (the subti
tle of Armed Forces is "Emo
tional Fascism").
Disco may livea long life, but
Costello will be outside the
party door: "I'll be at the video
and I will be watching; here we
are living in paradise. . .

What can we learn about
Elvis Costello from Ron Lil
lejord's (Daily, Feb. 15) review?
We are told that Costello
played 16 songs in 45 minutes,
that the audience applauded
for half an hour and that the
audience "said to itself" that
Costello is "a very weird guy."
We learn that the concert
was an "anti-show." We do not
learn what an "anti-show" is.
We do not learn what Costello
looked like. We do not learn
what he sings about. There is
no critical thought here — the
reviewer has dispensed with
this by omitting any informa
tion concerning the music.
The opinions that are given
are vague and clouded by con
ditional phrases. The article
begins by stating that the con
cert was "good while it lasted."
Later, it states that Costello
gave an "anti-show" (which
sounds pejorative, though I'm
just guessing at the meaning of
this phrase) with "no pacing or
showmanship to speak of."
The article ends with a dismis
sal of Costello: "Long live
disco! I guess." The reviewer
does not like him, I guess.
A music review should con
tain opinions backed up by crit
ical analysis. A rock concert
consists of songs, the per
former's motions, the staging
and the audience reaction. I
suggest that Lillejord study Jes
sica Chereskin's review on
"The Clash." She gives us opin
ions supported by analysis,

and places "The Clash," in a
social context.
Costello's talent is that he
shows our social conditions re
flected in the sphere of per
sonal relationships (the subti
tle of Armed Forces is "Emo
tional Fascism").
Disco may livea long life, but
Costello will be outside the
party door: "I'll be at the video
and I will be watching; here we
are living in paradise. . .

Bravo, it is nice to see young
Americans like you, Kurt
Cobb (Daily, Feb. 22) going
for the jugular. Your column
touches the very nerve center
ofcapitalistalienation. Itis nice
to see a student screaming into
the night sky "I can't take it
anymore."
The voracious appetite of
capitalism to buffer its agents
with things rather than the
makers-of-things is incredibly
clear in your article. If you go
on being this succinct they'll
soon call you a "commie."

Maybe you a re a young voice
in the wilderness ready to de
mystify America that things and
goods are the be all and the
end all. It is ironic, isn't it, to
see a self-sufficient American
who says he can do without
people but will switch on his
TV and radio sets immediately
when he withdraws into his
private cubicle — to be with
people, and yet not be with
them?
Inside that cubicle is a gigan
tic dose of paranoia pining for
the touch of human contact
but afraid to reach out.
But "Brother Can You Spare
A Dime" — those days are not
too faroff again. Iran is only the

beginning of a sobering-up of
people in a system suffering
from some of the worst dis
eases of human atomization
and alienation due to selfish
"growth."
