## Student body repressed 
### 
The general mood of the campus in the last
few weeks has been one of restlessness and
discontentment, as well it should be.
Students have been attending classes and
doing classwork.
Most individuals concern themselves with
the ripp future that awaits those clutching a
Stanford diploma. They walk about the cam
pus in a veritable trance, facing straight
ahead and carrying books under one arm.
They voluntarily subject themselves to ses
sions of learning.
Have body-snatching pods grown out of
the seepage of newly-filled Lake Lagunita?
No. We, as a student body, are simply repres
sed.
Just as the pink salmon must swim up
stream to spawn once a year and the Vulcan
must return home every seven, students here
must express their deepest natures. In other
words, we must riot.
Sex and violence is an ASSU Sunday flick
phenomenon, not an everyday — or even
frequent — occurrence. A just political
cause, handled in the right way, would re
medy this, just as it would take care of most
classes. It is impossible for any real person to
fathom missing a sit-in for humanity because
of a concrete dynamics class.
The task, then, is to find an issue which will
raise the tattered banners of student political
activism. A majorsetback occured last month
when the shah left Iran, leaving countless
unfilled brown paper bags and White Plaza to
the uninspiring operatic strains of fruit ven

dors.
The search for a new cause has already
begun. South Africa, traditionally a spring
quarter expression of student political
awareness might be brought out early to
make up for the present political issue shor
tage.
"It's downright depressing," commented
student activist Bernie "Bebe" Burns. "We
knew some time ago that it was only a matter
of time before the shah would cease To be a
viable campus issue. We had hoped that the
Jane Fonda White Plaza rally last quarter
might give us the sudden inspiration for at
least one large march and sit-in. Unfortu
nately, it's hard even for us to get excited
about innovations in water-heaters."
Indeed, even a Bakke decision repercus
sion rally seems preferable to a sit-in for solar
energy.
As the search for a blood-boiling cause
goes on, many student activists have reverted
to nostalgia.
"Where are the '60s when you really need
them? sighed one. "I mean I can't even
create excitement about the ozone layer
anymore."
Suggestions are welcome and should be
addressed to the Daily. Causes such as "Im
peach Billy Carter," "The South Shall Rise
Again and "My Plant Has Aphids" need not
be submitted.
