Herr Nightingale and the
Satin Woman
William Kotzwinkle
lllus. by Joe Servelio
Alfred A. Knopf
779 pp. 58.95
Violence and romance, virile
heroes and sleek femmes
fatales: virtually all pulp mys
tery novels contain these fun
damental components. Herr
Nightingale and the Satin
Woman is no exception. But
what other suspense story has
a piano-playing cricket, much
less one who courts the
heroine? And what mystery
tale includes a golden caterpil
lar who fills his owner with
gold dust and jewels? Obvi
ously, Herr Nightingale and the
Satin Woman is no ordinary
book. Through mystery, mysti
cality, humor, and visual imag
ery, it exceeds the bounds of
literary genre. Evaluation must
be subjective: no suitable
standard of comparison exists.
The illustrations set Herr
Nightingale and the Satin
Woman apart from other
books. |oe Servello's black and
white sketches are saturated
with subtle details. They re
semble multiple-exposure
photographs: every person
and every action, no matter
how minute, is represented.
Servelio even depicts motions
and thoughts. The drawings at
tract and please the eye. Their
complexity holds it, for the de
tails are so profuse that most of
them are missed at first glance.
The illustrations almost render
the text unnecessary; how
ever, neither words nor pic
tures are superfluous. Rather,
they enhance each other's ef
fect and together intensify the
reader's experience.
Picture books
The illustrations are not truly
unique: they link Herr Night
ingale and the Satin Woman
with the genre of children's
picture books. In this genre,

books need illustrations to
provide significance because
printed words mean little to
children: the youngest readers
look only at pictures. As chil
dren mature and learn to com
prehend what they read, the
pictures in their books grow
less frequent and less interest
ing; books written for adults
are seldom illustrated. Thus,
Herr Nightingale and the Satin
Woman gives adults a new
reading experience. Words
and pictures are combined
successfully; both contribute
equally to the book's effect and
its meaning. This synthesis
alone makes the book worth
while, but it has other redeem
ing qualities.

Primarily, the book trans
cends its stereotyped external
characteristics. The characters
could have stepped out of a
James Bond movie, but
Kotzwinkle's imaginative
treatment makes all situations
fresh and new. The romance is
between Nightingale and the
Satin Woman. However, it is a
cricket, the real hero, who
teaches the Satin Woman to
love. Their relationship is
chimerical and bittersweet;
from it the book derives much
of its emotional power.
Mysticality
The chapter which intro
duces a shoeshine boy is the
longest (four pages) and best in
the book. Though it occurs
near the end of the book, the
boy ranks in heroism with the
cricket. Finally, the book's
mysticality transcends the sus
pense in the plot, so that the
reader does not feel a tense
expectancy, but instead a calm
sense of inevitablity.
The publishers of Herr Night
ingale and the Satin Woman
call it "an environment." They
do not exaggerate. Servello's il
lustrations create a visual ex
perience; Kotzwinkle's fresh
perspective appeals to our im
aginations. Herr Nightingale
and the Satin Woman cannot
be tossed aside as a "mere"
children's book. It is a chal
lenge to our creativity.
