# Faculty upset with 7.3% pay increase
## 
### Tony Rupert 
A proposed 7.3 percent faculty salary increase
for next year drew much criticism at a meeting of
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
Acting Provost Gerald Lieberman, who told the
senate of the proposed $20 million increase in his
report on the University's operating budget for
next year, admitted that the increase will probably
not keep pace with the real rate of inflation.
Law School Dean Charles Meyers objected to
what he called the low increase budgeted for fa
culty salaries, and suggested that the University
begin development of the remaining unde
veloped University lands to finance faculty salary
increases. Meyers said that over the past three
years, faculty salaries had lost 10 percent of real
earning power due to inflation and meager salary
increases.
Bernard Roth, professor of mechanical en
gineering, complained about the low faculty
salaries, citing a Time article that said among pro
fessionals, college professor incomes were the
lowest, and that Stanford professors were below
the national mean. He said he was tired of the
administration continually "crying wolf" over the

problems of inflation.
Lieberman responded by citing a recent Univer
sity study that showed that among a group of 14
elite universities, Stanford ranked number one in
the average salary of the upper 75 percent of the
faculty.
Associate professor of education Dennis Phillips
said that he felt that this meant that "among 14
sinking ships, Stanford is sinking the slowest."
President Richard Lyman responded that he was
"upset that the faculty doesn't believe us when we
say they are the center of our attention."
Lieberman told the senate that he expects the
operating budget for the University to be balanced
next year. The Med School is expected to have a
$290,000 deficit but will cover it with its own re
serves, he said.
Lieberman said that the real problems the Uni
versity faced in preparing next year's budget were
the drop in the stock market last spring that re
duced the earnings on the endowment below the
predicted level, and losses due to inflation.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for budgets
and planning, announced that in order to help
students bear the costs of rising tuition, he was

looking into getting the University licensed as a
lender.
This would allow the University to make loans to
students, then sell the note and reloan the pro
ceeds. This process could be repeated numerous
times, Bacchetti said. However, such a plan would
mean the loss of some interest to the third party
involved, he added.
Lyman told the Senate that an "Ethics in Gov
ernment" bill passed by the Congress last year
threatens to deter University professors from
working for the government. The bill was in
tended to prevent businessmen from serving in
government and then quitting and taking a job
with an industry that was in the businessman's
jurisdiction while a government employee.
The bill, according to Lyman, could have the
"classic unintended effect" of forcing professors,
who for instance serve on the National Science
Foundation, to wait a year before resuming
employment with a university. Lyman said that he
hoped Congress would take steps to exempt uni
versity professors but that he has had no know
ledge of any attempt to do so.
