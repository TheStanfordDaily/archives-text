First off, I'm not going to
pretend that this is an un
biased review. I think
Lauren Bacall is great —
period. She's a star, and she
became one during a time
when that word still meant
something. From the start,
she seemed to make all the
surface contradictions work
for her: femininity, guts; a
little innocent, a lot worldly.
When you get past the
beauty, she still stands up: a
little bit vulnerable, a little
bit tough to cover for the
vulnerability.
Lauren Bacall By Myself,
which, delightfully, reads
more like a spoken reminis
cence than a full-fledged au
tobiography, is mostly
about Bacall the survivor:
her movie career essentially

peaking at age 19 with To
Have and Have Not; her
idyllic marriage to Hum
phrey Bogart ending tragi
cally with Bogart's death
from cancer in 1957; Bacall
trying to make it both emo
tionally and artistically in
the aftermath.
Cigarette puffs
Vou can almost picture
Bacall reading this book to
you. Cigarette in hand, lots
of precise hand gestures,
pausing often, adding em
phasis. The prose reads like
breaks between cigarette
puffs: clipped, simple —
lots of sentences of the
"such luck" variety.
Althoughthe short sen
tences may begin to get to
you, overall you feel a nice
sense of intimacy while
reading the book, as if
Bacall is indeed talking it to
you.
Typically, Bacall is up
front, open. She pours her
heart out about "Bogie" —
finally allowing the self
willed dam that Bacall built
after his death to burst.
Their love dominates the
book; Bacall seems to want
to bring the details back to
life for herself more than
anyone else. It's moving,
but you feel like you're in
truding, especially since
Bacall never asks for your
sympathy. The toughness is
especially pronounced
here.
Insecurity
But the show of tough
ness often hasn't been
enough in the years since
Bogart. A decline in good
roles,a nearly disastrous af-

fair with Frank Sinatra, and a
troubled marriage to Jason
Robards have all made the
last 20 years rocky ones for
Bacall: plagued by doubts,
insecurity — about her chil
dren, her career, her rela
tionships — but surviving,
often very alone.

But, in the end, with her
triumph in the Broadway
musical Applause, we're left
with Bacall the dreamer
who's never satisfied, wist
fully looking forward. This
hopeless fan can only wish
her well.
