For a New Liberty
Murray N. Rothbard
Collier/Macmillan
338 pp. $5.95
What we lack is a liberal
Utopia, a programme which
seems neither a mere defence
of things as they are nor a dilute
kind of socialism, but a truly
liberal radicalism which does
not spare the susceptibility of
the mighty. . . .
—F.A. Hayek,
1974 Nobel laureate
in economics
The newly revised and ex
panded edition of Murray N.
Rothbard's For a New Liberty
shows that Friedrich Hayek's
call has not gone unheeded.
For a New Liberty marks a re
naissance of radical liberalism.
Rothbard — an economist,
historian, and political
philosopher — is the preemi
nent intellectual of the bur
geoning libertarian move
ment. For a New Liberty is the
best introduction not only to
Rothbard's personal views but
also to the views of a radical
movement of rapidly increas
ing influence.
For a New Liberty is an in
dictment of the state. In sup
port of that indictment,
Rothbard presents damning
evidence — theoretical, empir
ical, and historical — against
the institution of government
as it has existed on this planet
for the last five millenia.
An introduction to the book
discusses the historical tradi

tion of radical liberal opposi
tion to the state apparatus and
the collapse of the radical lib
eral movement during the last
100 years.
Dissection of state
A brief (and somewhat dry)
discussion of the basic princi
ples of modern libertarianism
follows. It is succeeded by a
brilliant and fascinating dissec
tion of the state, demonstrat
ing why advocates of human
rights focus on government as
the primary source of injustice
and oppression.
The bulk of the book is de
voted to discussing the specific
evils and failures of the Ameri
can state — the collapse of the
public school system, the in
sanity of our foreign policy, the
inability to restrain inflation
and unemployment, etc. The
collapse of the American gov
ernment has become a com
monplace of political discus

sion; however, Rothbard,
combining theoretical insights
and empirical data, shows that
this collapse was not the acci
dent of personalities or cir
cumstance. In case after case,
he demonstrates that the fai
lure of the American state to
satisfy human needs is due to
basic flaws in the current
liberal/conservative political
system.
Anarchy
The most controversial as
pect of the book is Rothbard's
conviction that government is
incorrigible and that anarchy is
therefore the only political sys
tem consistent with human
rights. However, unlike the
Utopian anarchism of the 19th
century, Rothbard's system of
jural anarchy does not demand
a transformation of human na
ture but encompasses social
institutions for dealing with
men as they are. Employing

historical examples to buttress
his claims, he argues that jus
tice and protection against
crime and aggression can best
be provided by non
governmental institutions: in
deed, a pervasive theme of For
a New Liberty is that it is gov
ernment which is the greatest
enemy of social order and the
rule of law.
Rothbard interprets conser
vatism as a blind clinging to the
tradition, hierarchy, and coer
cion of the ancien regime and
sees socialism as a muddled at
tempt to employ conservative
means to achieve largely prog
ressive ends. Only radical
libertarianism, Rothbard as
serts, is capable of perma
nently ending the reign of the
ancien regime and realizing
the progressive aspirations of
most of the world's people.
While Rothbard is fully
aware of his debt to earlier lib

eral revolutionaries (the radical
liberals of the 19th century and
the revolutionaries who chal
lenged the ancien regime in
the British, French, and Ameri
can Revolutions), he is also
aware of the necessity of de
veloping a revolutionary liber
tarian theory and praxis for our
own century.
The gravest fault of the book
is its failure to adequately re
flect the diversity of thought
and differences of opinion
within the libertarian move
ment. While Rothbard's views
are increasingly accepted by
the "vital center" of the liberta
rian movement, many liberta
rians would reject his views on
certain issues — specifically on
foreign policy and on the ques
tion of anarchy.
Despite an attempt at com
prehensiveness, For a New
Liberty excludes some impor
tant issues — e.g., the problem

of immigration. Nor does it
pretend to teach the reader
economics or to explain in de
tail the operation of the free
market.
Rejects convention
Those readers who are firmly
wedded to the conventional
wisdom of the current political
establishment will not enjoy
For a New Liberty. Few readers
will be convinced by all of
Rothbard's arguments — at
least not on a first reading. But
for conservatives who reject
the New Right of John Briggs
and Anita Bryant, for liberals
who reject the tired cliches of
Teddy Kennedy and the mean
ingless mumbo-jumbo of Jerry
Brown, or for any citizen wil
ling to seek a path out of the
current political morass, Mur
ray Rothbard's For a New Lib
erty is a book worth reading.

For a New Liberty
Murray N. Rothbard
Collier/Macmillan
338 pp. $5.95
What we lack is a liberal
Utopia, a programme which
seems neither a mere defence
of things as they are nor a dilute
kind of socialism, but a truly
liberal radicalism which does
not spare the susceptibility of
the mighty. . . .
—F.A. Hayek,
1974 Nobel laureate
in economics
The newly revised and ex
panded edition of Murray N.
Rothbard's For a New Liberty
shows that Friedrich Hayek's
call has not gone unheeded.
For a New Liberty marks a re
naissance of radical liberalism.
Rothbard — an economist,
historian, and political
philosopher — is the preemi
nent intellectual of the bur
geoning libertarian move
ment. For a New Liberty is the
best introduction not only to
Rothbard's personal views but
also to the views of a radical
movement of rapidly increas
ing influence.
For a New Liberty is an in
dictment of the state. In sup
port of that indictment,
Rothbard presents damning
evidence — theoretical, empir
ical, and historical — against
the institution of government
as it has existed on this planet
for the last five millenia.
An introduction to the book
discusses the historical tradi

tion of radical liberal opposi
tion to the state apparatus and
the collapse of the radical lib
eral movement during the last
100 years.
Dissection of state
A brief (and somewhat dry)
discussion of the basic princi
ples of modern libertarianism
follows. It is succeeded by a
brilliant and fascinating dissec
tion of the state, demonstrat
ing why advocates of human
rights focus on government as
the primary source of injustice
and oppression.
The bulk of the book is de
voted to discussing the specific
evils and failures of the Ameri
can state — the collapse of the
public school system, the in
sanity of our foreign policy, the
inability to restrain inflation
and unemployment, etc. The
collapse of the American gov
ernment has become a com
monplace of political discus

sion; however, Rothbard,
combining theoretical insights
and empirical data, shows that
this collapse was not the acci
dent of personalities or cir
cumstance. In case after case,
he demonstrates that the fai
lure of the American state to
satisfy human needs is due to
basic flaws in the current
liberal/conservative political
system.
Anarchy
The most controversial as
pect of the book is Rothbard's
conviction that government is
incorrigible and that anarchy is
therefore the only political sys
tem consistent with human
rights. However, unlike the
Utopian anarchism of the 19th
century, Rothbard's system of
jural anarchy does not demand
a transformation of human na
ture but encompasses social
institutions for dealing with
men as they are. Employing

historical examples to buttress
his claims, he argues that jus
tice and protection against
crime and aggression can best
be provided by non
governmental institutions: in
deed, a pervasive theme of For
a New Liberty is that it is gov
ernment which is the greatest
enemy of social order and the
rule of law.
Rothbard interprets conser
vatism as a blind clinging to the
tradition, hierarchy, and coer
cion of the ancien regime and
sees socialism as a muddled at
tempt to employ conservative
means to achieve largely prog
ressive ends. Only radical
libertarianism, Rothbard as
serts, is capable of perma
nently ending the reign of the
ancien regime and realizing
the progressive aspirations of
most of the world's people.
While Rothbard is fully
aware of his debt to earlier lib

eral revolutionaries (the radical
liberals of the 19th century and
the revolutionaries who chal
lenged the ancien regime in
the British, French, and Ameri
can Revolutions), he is also
aware of the necessity of de
veloping a revolutionary liber
tarian theory and praxis for our
own century.
The gravest fault of the book
is its failure to adequately re
flect the diversity of thought
and differences of opinion
within the libertarian move
ment. While Rothbard's views
are increasingly accepted by
the "vital center" of the liberta
rian movement, many liberta
rians would reject his views on
certain issues — specifically on
foreign policy and on the ques
tion of anarchy.
Despite an attempt at com
prehensiveness, For a New
Liberty excludes some impor
tant issues — e.g., the problem

of immigration. Nor does it
pretend to teach the reader
economics or to explain in de
tail the operation of the free
market.
Rejects convention
Those readers who are firmly
wedded to the conventional
wisdom of the current political
establishment will not enjoy
For a New Liberty. Few readers
will be convinced by all of
Rothbard's arguments — at
least not on a first reading. But
for conservatives who reject

and Anita Bryant, for liberals
