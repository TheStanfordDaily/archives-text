# CINEMA SCOPE

### 
Talk of the Town ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
The paranoia of the McCarthy
era was still a decade away when
this very funny, very naive, and
unexpectedly liberal comedy was
made. Cary Grant stars as
Leopold Dilg, a self-styled free
thinker who is wrongly accused
of committing arson, jean Ar
thur, an actress who made a
career out of a sweet face and a
quivery voice, is charming as
Grant's co-star. Director George
Stevens, who would later lose his
light touch with comedy in epics
like A Place in the Sun and Giant,
is still in fine form here.
—Jim Mattson
Last Tanxo in Paris ★★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Bernando Bertolucci, who di
rected The Conformist and 1900,
delves deeply — perhaps too de
eply — into existential angst
here. But however one feels
about the ideas the film expres
ses, there's no denying that they
are backed up impressively.
Marlon Brando is overwhelming as
a burnt-out, suicidal American.
The photography, as always with
Bertolucci, is great, and the sets
are amazingly depressing — they
all seem to have rust-stained
water marks on the walls. Inci
dentally, the "X" rating, for those
going in search of cheap thrills,
now seems ludicrously harsh.
—J.M.
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
★ ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Three men discover gold; they
find themselves stripped of com
passion and humanity as each
person's greed causes him to
suspect the others of having de
signs on his share of the treasure.
John Huston wrote and directed
this superb western. It gave
academy awards to Huston and
his father, Walter Huston, who is
present as a grizzled old prospec
tor. It also furnished Humphrey
Bogart with what is perhaps the
best of all his roles.
—J.M.

Kind Hearts and Coronets ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Alec Guinness, the master of
the British comedy, gets mur
dered eight times in this
macabrely funny 1949 film. Guin
ness, you see, plays all eight of
the people who stand in the way
of Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini's ti
tle. With a rapidity of dispatch
found only in black comedy,
Mazzini moves purposefully up
the ancestral ladder through
homicide. Ealing studios, the
company that practically created
British cinema, produced;
Robert Hamer directed.
—J.M.
Death on the Nile ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—Ron Lillejord
Murder on the Orient Express
★ ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sidney Lumet, who directed
The Wiz, last year's biggest,
brightest, and most expensive
mess, is in better form here with
this stylish, elegantly decorated
whodunit. Albert Finney makes a
nice, self-parodying Hercule
Poirot; his suspects include In
grid Bergman (who, somewhat
surprisingly, won an Academy
Award for her performance),
Sean Connery, and Lauren
Bacall. The pacing is a little
pedestrian for a movie set on a
train, but, as you might suspect,
everything works out in the end.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter irifk Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that |ohn Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen
Nashville ★★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
Robert Altman stuffs every
body and their mother into this
movie and he makes it all work;
it's a mad swirling vision of
America. Nashville is a comic,
sometimes sad, often exhilarat
ing ride — you won't forget it,
because the movie challenges
you in almost novel ways. Lily
Tomlin and Barbara Harris stand
out in an impressive cast.
— R.L.
Dona Flor and Her
Two Husbands ★ * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Dona Flor, a widow who mar
ries a dependable but none too
exciting druggist, manages to get
the best of two worlds when her
rakish first husband comes back
from the dead to return romance
to her life. Dona Flor is a warm,
often very funny import from
Brazil.
—J.M.

Hardcore *
Palo Alto Square
Writer-director Paul Schrader
keeps himself detached from
what he's filming; this movie's
premise — a Calvinist
businessman from Grand Rapids
loses his daughter to California's
porno underworld and goes off
to get her back — would seem to
promise loads of emotional
theatrics, but the feeling's been
sucked out, and we're left with
Schrader's intellect and not his
guts. As the father, George C.
Scott tries hard, but he's finally
done in by the distance Schrader
keeps from the film's ugly night
world. With Season Hubley and
Peter Boyle.
—R.L.
The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
ifulwoman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.
— R.L.
Autumn Sonata ★★★ Vi
Biograph, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.
I
Harold and Maude ★★★★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Harold is a young man whose
hobby is attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and inherent goodness of
humanity. And it's clear from the
beginning that the two are de
stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principals are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Gordon, and Cat
Stevens supplied the tunes.
—).M.
Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Franc isco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed MM *S*H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsicles; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altaian's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, bytheendof the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.
—J.M.

Madame Rosa ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The performance of Simone
Signoret as Madame Rosa,a Jew
who finds herself in charge of an
Arab boy after his prostitute
mother can not take care of him,
vitalizes this uneven but ulti
mately compellingfilm. Signoret,
once legendary for her beauty,
allows herself to look haggish
and eccentric here; the way this
woman throws herself into her
role makes it easy to ignore the
film's weaknesses in technique
and structure. A sometimes mov
ing, often amusing film.
—J.M.
The Warriors ★
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a '70s ver
sion of Wesf Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. Their task is
to get back across the city with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "Lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.
—J.M.
Days of Heaven * * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.
—J.M.

The Brink's lob
Old Mill
When a capable hack like Wil
liam Friedkin (The Exorcist)
doesn't care about the material,
watch out. This is a stubbornly
indifferent movie; it's like a kid
who can do better but just won't.
Familiar faces (Peter Falk, Warren
Oates, Peter Boyle) stumble
around and act like they want
their checks fast. A mess of the
lowest order.
—R.L.
Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipwrecked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.
—).M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

Better than TV ★
Guano



Stanford students have a chance to view the efforts of three great
cinematic thespians this week. Mario Brando (left) gives a stun
ning performance in Last Tango in Paris. Simone Signoret is
equally fine in Madame Rosa. And Humphrey Bogart can be seen
in one of his meatiest roles in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

Murder on the Orient Express
★ ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sidney Lumet, who directed
The Wiz, last year's biggest,
brightest, and most expensive
mess, is in better form here with
this stylish, elegantly decorated
whodunit. Albert Finney makes a
nice, self-parodying Hercule
Poirot; his suspects include In
grid Bergman (who, somewhat
surprisingly, won an Academy
Award for her performance),
Sean Connery, and Lauren
Bacall. The pacing is a little
pedestrian for a movie set on a
train, but, as you might suspect,
everything works out in the end.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter irifk Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that |ohn Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen
Nashville ★★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
Robert Altman stuffs every
body and their mother into this
movie and he makes it all work;
it's a mad swirling vision of
America. Nashville is a comic,
sometimes sad, often exhilarat
ing ride — you won't forget it,
because the movie challenges
you in almost novel ways. Lily
Tomlin and Barbara Harris stand
out in an impressive cast.
— R.L.
Dona Flor and Her

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Dona Flor, a widow who mar
ries a dependable but none too
exciting druggist, manages to get
the best of two worlds when her
rakish first husband comes back
from the dead to return romance
to her life. Dona Flor is a warm,
often very funny import from
Brazil.

Palo Alto Square
Writer-director Paul Schrader
keeps himself detached from
what he's filming; this movie's
premise — a Calvinist
businessman from Grand Rapids
loses his daughter to California's
porno underworld and goes off
to get her back — would seem to
promise loads of emotional
theatrics, but the feeling's been
sucked out, and we're left with
Schrader's intellect and not his
guts. As the father, George C.
Scott tries hard, but he's finally
done in by the distance Schrader
keeps from the film's ugly night
world. With Season Hubley and
Peter Boyle.
—R.L.
The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
ifulwoman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.
— R.L.
Autumn Sonata ★★★ Vi
Biograph, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.

Harold and Maude ★★★★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Harold is a young man whose
hobby is attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and inherent goodness of
humanity. And it's clear from the
beginning that the two are de
stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principals are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Gordon, and Cat
Stevens supplied the tunes.

Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Franc isco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed MM *S*H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsicles; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altaian's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, bytheendof the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.
—J.M.

Madame Rosa ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The performance of Simone
Signoret as Madame Rosa,a Jew
who finds herself in charge of an
Arab boy after his prostitute
mother can not take care of him,
vitalizes this uneven but ulti
mately compellingfilm. Signoret,
once legendary for her beauty,
allows herself to look haggish
and eccentric here; the way this
woman throws herself into her
role makes it easy to ignore the
film's weaknesses in technique
and structure. A sometimes mov
ing, often amusing film.
—J.M.
The Warriors ★
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a '70s ver
sion of Wesf Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. Their task is
to get back across the city with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "Lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.
—J.M.
Days of Heaven * * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.
—J.M.

The Brink's lob
Old Mill
When a capable hack like Wil
liam Friedkin (The Exorcist)
doesn't care about the material,
watch out. This is a stubbornly
indifferent movie; it's like a kid
who can do better but just won't.
Familiar faces (Peter Falk, Warren
Oates, Peter Boyle) stumble
around and act like they want
their checks fast. A mess of the
lowest order.
—R.L.
Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipwrecked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.
—).M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

Stanford students have a chance to view the efforts of three great
cinematic thespians this week. Mario Brando (left) gives a stun

equally fine in Madame Rosa. And Humphrey Bogart can be seen
in one of his meatiest roles in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

Talk of the Town ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
The paranoia of the McCarthy
era was still a decade away when
this very funny, very naive, and
unexpectedly liberal comedy was
made. Cary Grant stars as
Leopold Dilg, a self-styled free
thinker who is wrongly accused
of committing arson, jean Ar
thur, an actress who made a
career out of a sweet face and a
quivery voice, is charming as
Grant's co-star. Director George
Stevens, who would later lose his
light touch with comedy in epics
like A Place in the Sun and Giant,
is still in fine form here.
—Jim Mattson
Last Tanxo in Paris ★★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Bernando Bertolucci, who di
rected The Conformist and 1900,
delves deeply — perhaps too de
eply — into existential angst
here. But however one feels
about the ideas the film expres
ses, there's no denying that they
are backed up impressively.
Marlon Brando is overwhelming as
a burnt-out, suicidal American.
The photography, as always with
Bertolucci, is great, and the sets
are amazingly depressing — they
all seem to have rust-stained
water marks on the walls. Inci
dentally, the "X" rating, for those
going in search of cheap thrills,
now seems ludicrously harsh.
—J.M.
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
★ ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Three men discover gold; they
find themselves stripped of com
passion and humanity as each
person's greed causes him to
suspect the others of having de
signs on his share of the treasure.
John Huston wrote and directed
this superb western. It gave
academy awards to Huston and
his father, Walter Huston, who is
present as a grizzled old prospec
tor. It also furnished Humphrey
Bogart with what is perhaps the
best of all his roles.
—J.M.

Kind Hearts and Coronets ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Alec Guinness, the master of
the British comedy, gets mur
dered eight times in this
macabrely funny 1949 film. Guin
ness, you see, plays all eight of
the people who stand in the way
of Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini's ti
tle. With a rapidity of dispatch
found only in black comedy,
Mazzini moves purposefully up
the ancestral ladder through
homicide. Ealing studios, the
company that practically created
British cinema, produced;
Robert Hamer directed.
—J.M.
Death on the Nile ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap

Scott tries hard, but he's finally
done in by the distance Schrader
keeps from the film's ugly night
world. With Season Hubley and
Peter Boyle.

The Great Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
ifulwoman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.
— R.L.
Autumn Sonata ★★★ Vi
Biograph, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.

Harold and Maude ★★★★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Harold is a young man whose
hobby is attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and inherent goodness of
humanity. And it's clear from the
beginning that the two are de
stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principals are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Gordon, and Cat
Stevens supplied the tunes.

Quintet ★
Metro 11, San Franc isco
Robert Altman, the man who
directed MM *S*H and Nashville,
has decided that it's time to
tackle a "big theme" with this tale
of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsicles; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altaian's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, bytheendof the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu
mans; the only thing we can feel
is a sort of racial ennui. Paul
Newman grimly heads an inter
national cast.
—J.M.

Madame Rosa ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The performance of Simone
Signoret as Madame Rosa,a Jew
who finds herself in charge of an
Arab boy after his prostitute
mother can not take care of him,
vitalizes this uneven but ulti
mately compellingfilm. Signoret,
once legendary for her beauty,
allows herself to look haggish
and eccentric here; the way this
woman throws herself into her
role makes it easy to ignore the
film's weaknesses in technique
and structure. A sometimes mov
ing, often amusing film.
—J.M.
The Warriors ★
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a '70s ver
sion of Wesf Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. Their task is
to get back across the city with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "Lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.
—J.M.
Days of Heaven * * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.
—J.M.

The Brink's lob
Old Mill
When a capable hack like Wil
liam Friedkin (The Exorcist)
doesn't care about the material,
watch out. This is a stubbornly
indifferent movie; it's like a kid
who can do better but just won't.
Familiar faces (Peter Falk, Warren
Oates, Peter Boyle) stumble
around and act like they want
their checks fast. A mess of the
lowest order.
—R.L.
Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipwrecked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.
—).M.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

Stanford students have a chance to view the efforts of three great
cinematic thespians this week. Mario Brando (left) gives a stun

equally fine in Madame Rosa. And Humphrey Bogart can be seen
in one of his meatiest roles in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

Talk of the Town ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
The paranoia of the McCarthy
era was still a decade away when
this very funny, very naive, and
unexpectedly liberal comedy was
made. Cary Grant stars as
Leopold Dilg, a self-styled free
thinker who is wrongly accused
of committing arson, jean Ar
thur, an actress who made a
career out of a sweet face and a
quivery voice, is charming as
Grant's co-star. Director George
Stevens, who would later lose his
light touch with comedy in epics
like A Place in the Sun and Giant,
is still in fine form here.
—Jim Mattson
Last Tanxo in Paris ★★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Bernando Bertolucci, who di
rected The Conformist and 1900,
delves deeply — perhaps too de
eply — into existential angst
here. But however one feels
about the ideas the film expres
ses, there's no denying that they
are backed up impressively.
Marlon Brando is overwhelming as
a burnt-out, suicidal American.
The photography, as always with
Bertolucci, is great, and the sets
are amazingly depressing — they
all seem to have rust-stained
water marks on the walls. Inci
dentally, the "X" rating, for those
going in search of cheap thrills,
now seems ludicrously harsh.
—J.M.
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
★ ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Three men discover gold; they
find themselves stripped of com
passion and humanity as each
person's greed causes him to
suspect the others of having de
signs on his share of the treasure.
John Huston wrote and directed
this superb western. It gave
academy awards to Huston and
his father, Walter Huston, who is
present as a grizzled old prospec
tor. It also furnished Humphrey
Bogart with what is perhaps the
best of all his roles.
—J.M.

Kind Hearts and Coronets ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Alec Guinness, the master of
the British comedy, gets mur
dered eight times in this
macabrely funny 1949 film. Guin
ness, you see, plays all eight of
the people who stand in the way
of Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini's ti
tle. With a rapidity of dispatch
found only in black comedy,
Mazzini moves purposefully up
the ancestral ladder through
homicide. Ealing studios, the
company that practically created
British cinema, produced;
Robert Hamer directed.
—J.M.
Death on the Nile ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—Ron Lillejord
Murder on the Orient Express
★ ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sidney Lumet, who directed
The Wiz, last year's biggest,
brightest, and most expensive
mess, is in better form here with
this stylish, elegantly decorated
whodunit. Albert Finney makes a
nice, self-parodying Hercule
Poirot; his suspects include In
grid Bergman (who, somewhat
surprisingly, won an Academy
Award for her performance),
Sean Connery, and Lauren
Bacall. The pacing is a little
pedestrian for a movie set on a
train, but, as you might suspect,
everything works out in the end.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter irifk Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that |ohn Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen
Nashville ★★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
Robert Altman stuffs every
body and their mother into this
movie and he makes it all work;
it's a mad swirling vision of
America. Nashville is a comic,
sometimes sad, often exhilarat

because the movie challenges
you in almost novel ways. Lily
Tomlin and Barbara Harris stand
out in an impressive cast.

of an ice-age apocalypse. There
are some striking images here: a
lot of ice and snow; packs of dogs
that calmly devour frozen hu
mans like popsicles; people
camping in what looks like an
ice-encrusted shopping center.
The only thing people have to do
for a good time is to play a board
game called quintet. Altaian's
story line is so humorless and
ponderous that, bytheendof the
movie, there's no remorse left for
the fate of the last surviving hu

Madame Rosa ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The performance of Simone
Signoret as Madame Rosa,a Jew
who finds herself in charge of an
Arab boy after his prostitute
mother can not take care of him,
vitalizes this uneven but ulti
mately compellingfilm. Signoret,
once legendary for her beauty,
allows herself to look haggish
and eccentric here; the way this
woman throws herself into her
role makes it easy to ignore the
film's weaknesses in technique
and structure. A sometimes mov
ing, often amusing film.
—J.M.
The Warriors ★
Palo Alto Square
What we have here is a '70s ver
sion of Wesf Side Story without
the tunes. This movie goes to
great lengths to make gang war
fare exciting and attractive. It de
rives most of its energy, which is
present in abundance, from
exploiting the purely visceral joys
of kicking, gouging, and raping.
The Warriors are a "good" gang
(whose members, however, are
not above doing a little kicking,
gouging and raping in the name
of a good cause) trapped on the
wrong side of town. Their task is
to get back across the city with
out being pounded by gangs with
baseball bats, run over by a gang
on skates, or stabbed by an all
female gang called the "Lizzies."
Murder and mayhem never
looked more wholesome.
—J.M.
Days of Heaven * * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.
—J.M.

The Brink's lob
Old Mill
When a capable hack like Wil
liam Friedkin (The Exorcist)
doesn't care about the material,
watch out. This is a stubbornly
indifferent movie; it's like a kid

Familiar faces (Peter Falk, Warren
Oates, Peter Boyle) stumble
around and act like they want
their checks fast. A mess of the
lowest order.
—R.L.
Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipwrecked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.

Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

Stanford students have a chance to view the efforts of three great
cinematic thespians this week. Mario Brando (left) gives a stun
ning performance in Last Tango in Paris. Simone Signoret is
equally fine in Madame Rosa. And Humphrey Bogart can be seen
in one of his meatiest roles in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

Talk of the Town ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
The paranoia of the McCarthy
era was still a decade away when
this very funny, very naive, and
unexpectedly liberal comedy was
made. Cary Grant stars as
Leopold Dilg, a self-styled free
thinker who is wrongly accused
of committing arson, jean Ar
thur, an actress who made a
career out of a sweet face and a
quivery voice, is charming as
Grant's co-star. Director George
Stevens, who would later lose his
light touch with comedy in epics
like A Place in the Sun and Giant,
is still in fine form here.
—Jim Mattson
Last Tanxo in Paris ★★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Bernando Bertolucci, who di
rected The Conformist and 1900,
delves deeply — perhaps too de
eply — into existential angst
here. But however one feels
about the ideas the film expres
ses, there's no denying that they
are backed up impressively.
Marlon Brando is overwhelming as
a burnt-out, suicidal American.
The photography, as always with
Bertolucci, is great, and the sets
are amazingly depressing — they
all seem to have rust-stained
water marks on the walls. Inci
dentally, the "X" rating, for those
going in search of cheap thrills,
now seems ludicrously harsh.
—J.M.
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
★ ★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Three men discover gold; they
find themselves stripped of com
passion and humanity as each
person's greed causes him to
suspect the others of having de
signs on his share of the treasure.
John Huston wrote and directed
this superb western. It gave
academy awards to Huston and
his father, Walter Huston, who is
present as a grizzled old prospec
tor. It also furnished Humphrey
Bogart with what is perhaps the
best of all his roles.
—J.M.

Kind Hearts and Coronets ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Alec Guinness, the master of
the British comedy, gets mur
dered eight times in this
macabrely funny 1949 film. Guin
ness, you see, plays all eight of
the people who stand in the way
of Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini's ti
tle. With a rapidity of dispatch
found only in black comedy,
Mazzini moves purposefully up
the ancestral ladder through
homicide. Ealing studios, the
company that practically created
British cinema, produced;
Robert Hamer directed.
—J.M.
Death on the Nile ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—Ron Lillejord
Murder on the Orient Express
★ ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sidney Lumet, who directed
The Wiz, last year's biggest,
brightest, and most expensive
mess, is in better form here with
this stylish, elegantly decorated
whodunit. Albert Finney makes a
nice, self-parodying Hercule
Poirot; his suspects include In
grid Bergman (who, somewhat
surprisingly, won an Academy
Award for her performance),
Sean Connery, and Lauren
Bacall. The pacing is a little
pedestrian for a movie set on a
train, but, as you might suspect,
everything works out in the end.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter irifk Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that |ohn Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen
Nashville ★★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
Robert Altman stuffs every
body and their mother into this
movie and he makes it all work;
it's a mad swirling vision of
America. Nashville is a comic,
sometimes sad, often exhilarat

because the movie challenges
you in almost novel ways. Lily
Tomlin and Barbara Harris stand
out in an impressive cast.

promise loads of emotional
theatrics, but the feeling's been
sucked out, and we're left with

The Great Train Robbery ★★

Michael Crichton's movie

is photography, plot and a beaut

Autumn Sonata ★★★ Vi
Biograph, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver

stined by fate to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, who directed Shampoo
and Coming Home, also directed
this invigorating cult-comedy.
The principals are played by Bud
Court and Ruth Gordon, and Cat

Familiar faces (Peter Falk, Warren
Oates, Peter Boyle) stumble
around and act like they want
their checks fast. A mess of the
lowest order.

Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipwrecked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.

Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

Stanford students have a chance to view the efforts of three great
cinematic thespians this week. Mario Brando (left) gives a stun
ning performance in Last Tango in Paris. Simone Signoret is
equally fine in Madame Rosa. And Humphrey Bogart can be seen
in one of his meatiest roles in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.
