Manila, Philippines (AP) â€”
For 20 weeks Tran Hue Hue,
marooned on an old wreck in
the South China Sea, lived on
seagulls, oysters and a little
rainwater. When help finally
came, the 17-year-old Viet
namese refugee had buried the
last of her 49 companions at
sea.
Her story, carried in a United
Nations refugee official's re
port to the Foreign Ministry,
began in September when she
and 49 others fled Vietnam
aboard a 35-toot fishing boat,
planning to sail to Australia.
Three days later the boat ran
aground on a reef off the
southern Philippines. The re
fugees sought shelter in the
hull of a wrecked ship.
"With no water and food,
slowly 45 persons died in the
first month of their stay in the
coral bed," the report said. The
other four died later. Hue
buried the last one, a 14-year
old boy, 10 days before Filipino
fishermen chanced upon her
and rescued her early last
month.
Hue, an eighth-grader in Can
Tho before the Communists
overran South Vietnam in 1975,
is being treated at a military
camp 370 miles southwest of
here.
