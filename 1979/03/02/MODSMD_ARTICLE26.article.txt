# Gymnastic championships begin tonight at Berkeley's Harmon Gym

### Dean Eyre 
Going from a 4-8 record to
8-4 is quite an accomplish
ment, but for Sadao Hamada
and his gymnastics team, there
are still more challenges left in
the 1979 season.
The first of these challenges,
the Pacific Southwest Gymnas
, tic Championships, begins to
night in Berkeley's Harmon
Gym at 7:30 p.m. The two-day
meet format commences with
optional competition this
evening, then moves on to
'compulsory routines tomor

row at 1:30 p.m. According to
Hamada, either the top six or
eight inidividuals in each event
proceed to tomorrow night's
7:30 p.m. individual finals,
based upon the total of the two
previously awarded scores.
"We had an intersquad meet
Tuesday and I kind of know
pretty much where each guy
is," Hamada explained. "John
Marra could be going all
around if he's healthy but Brian
Nelson is still coming up — I
don't know if he'll be going
all-around. Tad (Bostick) and

Mike (Lee) are pretty much
sure of going and two more
guys out of the remaining three
— John, Brian and Bob Daniel.
"In our informal intersquad
meet I judged them and, al
though guys are still missing,
we got almost 190, which is a
good 15 points better than last
year's best official (compul
sory) results. So, we can prob
ably go around 195 or pretty
close to 200 by the Pac-10
meet," he added.
And just how do the Cardi
nals stack up with the other en
tries in the Southwest Champ
ionships?
"Cal is no doubt the best,
scoring 218 in both compul
sories and optionals so that's
probably out of reach, but
we're going to be very close to
USC and UCLA," Hamada pre
dicted. "We can probably beat
UCLA again and we can beat
San Jose State and UC-Davis,
but Cal State Fullerton is very
tough. We'll probably finish
about third or fourth."
As a team, the Cards should
be toughest in vaulting and
floor exercise.
"After that it all depends on
who hits," Hamada said.
"Whichever event, when four
guys hit decently we'll get
pretty high scores."

Individually, Stanford's top
prospects are senior co
captain Chris Takimoto, Bos
tick and Lee. Depending on
who's hot in the meet, the
Cards could also have rep
resentation in the vaulting and
high bar events, according to
Hamada.
While other gymnasts have
broken through with top
scores during the regular sea
son, a lack of experience in the
compulsory competition may
hamper their post-season
chances.
"The thing is, most of the
freshmen are weak in compul
sories and none of them are
really well-balanced in both
competitions," Hamada said.
"The only guy who is well
balanced is Tad, because he's
been doing these routines for
the last two years."
By concentrating on ironing
out the rough spots in compul
sories, Hamada hopes work
outs can make the routines
more fluid, therefore capable
of receiving higher scores.
"We haven't worked on any
optionals here, but after Wed
nesday we will have brought
the balance up to 50-50 again,"
said Hamada. "Right now the
workouts are 100 percent
compulsories."

Hamada.
While other gymnasts have
broken through with top
scores during the regular sea
son, a lack of experience in the
compulsory competition may
hamper their post-season
chances.
"The thing is, most of the
freshmen are weak in compul
sories and none of them are
really well-balanced in both
competitions," Hamada said.
"The only guy who is well
balanced is Tad, because he's
been doing these routines for
the last two years."
By concentrating on ironing
out the rough spots in compul
sories, Hamada hopes work
outs can make the routines
more fluid, therefore capable
of receiving higher scores.
"We haven't worked on any
optionals here, but after Wed
nesday we will have brought
the balance up to 50-50 again,"
said Hamada. "Right now the
workouts are 100 percent
compulsories."
