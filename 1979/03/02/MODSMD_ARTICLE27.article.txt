# Women triumphant in season finale
## 
### Rich Martinez 
The women's basketball
team awoke from its initial
five-minute nap and, inspired
by Louise Smith's game of the
year, downed Santa Clara 55-42
in the final game of the season.
Spring may be only a couple
weeks off but both teams shot
as if they were frostbitten by a
mid-winter blizzard. Stanford
missed its first six shots en
route to hitting a frigid 29 per
cent from the floor for the first
half. But the Broncos were
worse — hitting only five of 28
shots for a lowly 18 percent.
The Cards pulled through
and managed to hold a 20-14
lead in the women's dullest 20
minutes of the year.
When the Broncos pulled
within two, 22-20, the Cards fi
gured enough was enough.
Following the example of
Jeanne Ruark's two first-half
blocked shots, Smith brought
the crowd to its feet with seven

stuffs of her own. She also con
tributed six rebounds and 20
points to the Cardinal cause.
Hampered by injuries all
season, Smith was finally able
to show how vital she was to
Stanford's attack.
"I didn't feel that I was able
to play up to my capabilities
most of the year. I wanted to
have at least one good game
before the end of the season. It
took at least one good game
before the end of the season. It
took awhile, but I guess this
was it," said Smith.
When asked about the
game, Coach Dotty McCrea
simply said, "Louise Smith!"
The Cards played better ball
the second half and disposed
of Santa Clara with ease. Finish
ing the season with a 19-6 re
cord overall and 7-5 in the con
ference, Stanford will find out
if it receives a playoff berth this
Sunday.
