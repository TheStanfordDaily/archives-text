# Spikers downed by UCLA 'giants'

Taking on UCLA in volleyball
has always been rather like try
ing to fight a Goliath with a
water pistol. And even if you
get its armor wet, it still won't
rust.
And it's still not rusting. At
least not as of Wednesday
night, when the Stanford
men's volleyball team tried
once again to down the mighty
volleyball giants of the Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles,
and failed.
The Cards, who are now 2-5
overall, knew well before they
packed their baggage that they
would be facing one of the
finest, if not the finest, team in
the country. In a match that
only lasted about one hour,
UCLA won easily 15-6, 15-3,
15-6.
Stanford coach Fred Sturm,
who played four years of var
sity volleyball at UCLA himself,
said the Cards didn't play as
poc !y as the score would indi
cate.
"The match was played very
quickly," he said, noting that
its shortness was a pretty good
indication of just how powerful
the Bruin squad is.
Any hope of being able to
shut down the Bruin's offense
was dissolved quickly. Accord
ing to Sturm, the Cards were
only able to rotate an average
of about nine times per game.
In the meantime, UCLA went
on a rampage.
"Nothing really outstanding
happened," Sturm said, in

summation. "I was very
pleased with how the non
starters played. I let them play
the entire third game and I
think they did pretty well.
The Cards are now facing
two more conference matches
this weekend before they re
turn. Friday night they will take
on No. 2 ranked Pepperdine,
and Saturday they will make
the trip to nearby Loyola.
Coach Sturm is particularly
looking forward to Friday
night's match. Last year Pep
perdine was number one in the
NCAA, and according to
Sturm, all of their starting
players from last year are re
turning.
"They are just one notch be
hind UCLA in my opinion,"
Sturm said. "Their coach quit
last year, and their new coach
is running a new style instead
of what they used last year,
which was successful. Who
knows, though, it may be more
successful."
Loyola, who Sturm de
scribed as a perennial "cellar
dweller," was beaten in five
games the last time they faced
Stanford.
"They had a good year re
cruiting, and should be an im
proved team, though," he
said.
So, the Cardinals have their
work cut out for themselves
this weekend. But in the confi
dent words of Coach Sturm, "If
we can play well against UCLA
and Pepperdine, we can play
well against anybody."
