## Netters sweep Fullerton 
### Sue Sheldon 
The throngs of Japanese vis
itors that have been touring
Stanford's campus all week
even took in a few athletic
events. In avid attendance,
armed with their cameras, they
immortalized the women's
tennis team victory over Cal
State-Fullerton Thursday after
noon.
Donna Rubin, playing
number one for the Cards, was
a favorite photographic subject
for the spectators as she
methodically drilled her oppo
nent from the baseline to de
feat Karen Peterson 6-2, 6-5.
"Donna's playing very well
right now. She's quick on the
ball, she's really playing her
own game," commented
coach Anne Could.
Playing in her first single's
match for Stanford, Alycia
Moulton started slowly, but
eventually displayed the talent
that earned her a spot in the
top six. "I played much better
toward the end of the match,"
stated Moulton. Carolyn
Knight would probably have to
agree, as she became a 6-3, 6-1
victim of Moulton's serve and
volley attack.

Sue Rasmussen provided
Stanford with its first win of the
afternoon by destroying Ellen
Linderman 6-0,6-0. "It j easy in
a match like that to stop con
centrating, and start making
sloppy shots," said Rasmus
sen. "I tried not to do that, and
just outsteadied her."
Added Gould, "Sue did a
good job today of being patient
and concentrating on one
point at a time."
When the Fullerton coach
found out her number four
player was down 3-1 against
Susie Hagey, she assumed it
was only the first set. "No,"
stated Kathy Ricks, "I already
lost the first set 6-0." Ricks was
without a weapon against the
depth of Hagey'sgroundstroke
attack, and ended up losing
6-0, 6-2.
Gould summed up Caryn
Hertel's play as "controlled
and consistent." Hertel had to
agree. "I played much better
than I did in our last match."
She added a number five win to
the lineup, defeating Dione
Sutton 6-0, 6-2.
In spite of a sore throat, Lisa
Gordon finished off Fern Quon
6-1, 6-1.

Once again Stanford had the
match won by the end of the
singles competition* It was at
about that time the Japanese
tourists packed up their
cameras and left.

State-Fullerton Thursday afternoon. Rubin, a freshman, wants to play professional tennis upon gradua
tion.
The throngs of Japanese vis
itors that have been touring
Stanford's campus all week
even took in a few athletic
events. In avid attendance,
armed with their cameras, they
immortalized the women's
tennis team victory over Cal
State-Fullerton Thursday after
noon.
Donna Rubin, playing
number one for the Cards, was
a favorite photographic subject
for the spectators as she
methodically drilled her oppo
nent from the baseline to de
feat Karen Peterson 6-2, 6-5.
"Donna's playing very well
right now. She's quick on the
ball, she's really playing her
own game," commented
coach Anne Could.
Playing in her first single's
match for Stanford, Alycia
Moulton started slowly, but
eventually displayed the talent
that earned her a spot in the
top six. "I played much better
toward the end of the match,"
stated Moulton. Carolyn
Knight would probably have to
agree, as she became a 6-3, 6-1
victim of Moulton's serve and
volley attack.

Sue Rasmussen provided
Stanford with its first win of the
afternoon by destroying Ellen
Linderman 6-0,6-0. "It j easy in
a match like that to stop con
centrating, and start making
sloppy shots," said Rasmus
sen. "I tried not to do that, and
just outsteadied her."
Added Gould, "Sue did a
good job today of being patient
and concentrating on one
point at a time."
When the Fullerton coach
found out her number four
player was down 3-1 against
Susie Hagey, she assumed it
was only the first set. "No,"
stated Kathy Ricks, "I already
lost the first set 6-0." Ricks was
without a weapon against the
depth of Hagey'sgroundstroke
attack, and ended up losing
6-0, 6-2.
Gould summed up Caryn
Hertel's play as "controlled
and consistent." Hertel had to
agree. "I played much better
than I did in our last match."
She added a number five win to
the lineup, defeating Dione
Sutton 6-0, 6-2.
In spite of a sore throat, Lisa
Gordon finished off Fern Quon
6-1, 6-1.

Once again Stanford had the
match won by the end of the
singles competition* It was at
about that time the Japanese
tourists packed up their
cameras and left.
