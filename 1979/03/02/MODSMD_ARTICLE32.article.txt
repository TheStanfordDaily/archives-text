### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
let a victory in their first league
game of the 1979 season slip
through their fingers yesterday
as the University of Arizona
scored a 6-5 come-from
behind victory over the visiting
Cardinals.
Senior lefthander Joe LoP
resti suffered his first loss of
the year when Arizona tallied
three runs in the seventh to de
stroy Stanford's 5-2 lead, and
one in the eighth to snatch the
win. LoPresti came on in relief
of a struggling Paul Crame who
made it through six innings
after walking six batters.
"We didn't give it away,"
said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess shortly after the

tough loss. "We just couldn't
hold them."
Arizona was the first to get
on the scoreboard yesterday
pushing one run across the
plate in the bottom of the third
inning. The Wildcats added
another run in the fourth, but
watched their 2-0 lead evapo
rate in the sixth undera scorch
ing five-hit attack by Stanford.
With one out in the sixth,
Stanford started cranking out
the runs. Dave Meier doubled,
Larry Reynolds singled and
john Pyle reached first on an
error that also allowed Meier to
score. Phil Wilson then singled
to load the bases and Paul
Zuvella doubled to left batting
in two runs.

Mike Toothman walked to
again load the bases, Loring
Davies sacrificed Wilson home
for Stanford's fourth run and a
single by Bruce Walters
brought Zuvella home for the
fifth run off five hits.
"We hit the ball hard in that
five-run inning/' said Mar
quess.
In fact, according to Mar
quess, the team hit the ball well
throughout the game, but their
line drives and fly balls were
continually plucked out of the
air by patiently waiting Arizona
fielders, whereas Arizona's
grounders sped by the Cardi
nal defense on a hard-packed
home turf.
After tying the game in the
seventh, Arizona went ahead
in the eighth when catcher
Don Hyman doubled to lead
things off. Ron Quick hit a ball
directly back to to the box
where LoPresti was able to get
the lead runner at third, but
Quick advanced to second on a
wild pitch and after scored
from there on a single to center
by lead-off batter John Moses.
Tomorrow, Stanford will send
Bruce Fiala (4-1) to the mound
in a game under the lights. Al
though rain is predicted to fall
in Tucson tomorrow morning,
the field should be dry by the 7
p.m. start time.
Fiala will face Arizona's
freshman standout Ron Sis
mondo.
lunior Larry Kuhn (3-1) is
scheduled to begin Saturday's
1 p.m. contest.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
the Cards may be without the
services of outfielder Larry
Reynolds who sprained his
ankle in,yesterday's game.
