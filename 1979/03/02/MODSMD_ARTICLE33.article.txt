# Card cagers succumb to Trojans, 79-68
## 
### Chris Haft 
Los Angeles — Three basic
problems — those which have
been plaguing Stanford's bas
ketball team all season —
haunted the Cardinals in the
first half last night against USC,
and eventually proved to be an
unerasable stigma, as the
Trojans triumphed 79-68 at the
Los Angeles Memorial Sports
Arena.
First, Stanford displayed a
remarkable inability to handle
the Trojans man-to-man full
court press. Kimberly Belton
and Wolfe Perry each attemp
ted to complete passes to the
spectators in the $5 seats while
being harrassed by theTrojans.
Second, the Cards failed to
keep USC off the offensive
boards and get rebounds 01
their own. Stanford was out
rebounded 20-9 in the first half,
and Belton was the only Card
to garner more than three
caroms.
Finally, free throws, which
has been the albatross around
Stanford's neck this season,
kept the Cards from staying
close to USC in the first half.
Presented with this delecta
ble assortment of turnovers
(the basketball kind) and mis
takes, USC couldn't help but
take advantage and stuff its
stomach with points, taking a
43-31 lead at halftime.
Before their deficiencies
caught up with them, the Cards

roamed tree and easy on of
fense, actually controlling the
action during the opening mi
nutes.
Belton's free throw, reverse
loop-the-loop lay-in and six
foot banker keyed a modest
but effective 7-2 streak that
gave Stanford a 13-8 lead, its
largest, with 13:05 left in the
half.
The Trojans fought back to
take the lead 14-13 on two bas
kets by Maurice Williams and
another by Doug Widtfeldt.
The two clubs then battled
through three score ties in the
next four minutes before USC
slowly but inexorably revealed
Stanford's tender spots.
Leading just 27-26, the Tro
jans stretched their advantage
t033-26 with4:oo left in the first
half on Purvis Miller's seven
footer, Steve Smith's two free
throws and Widtfeldt's pair of
charity tosses.
USC didn't do this damage,
however, without the Cards'
aforementioned self
destruction.
What made these errors so
unfortunate was the fact that
Stanford truly played a strong
second half. On the strength of
Perry's corner jumper, Or
lando Ward's three-point play
and floating banker, and
Daryle Morgan's back-door
lay-in, the Cards cut USC's lead
to 45-40 with 16:28 remaining.
Miller and Smith each re

taliated with baskets giving the
Trojans a nine-point cushion,
but the undaunted Cards kept
hounding USC, coming within
five points on five other occa
sions.
Stanford's strongest
second-half threat surfaced
with less than five minutes to
play and USC holding tight to a
65-58 lead.
Perry hit two free throws,
again shaving the margin to
five, and freshman guard Doug
Marty stole the ball and canned
a 15-footer with 4:19 left to
bring Stanford within 65-62.
Yet at this point Stanford
forgot about the solid team of
fense which had worked well
for them and instead yielded to
the temptations of one-on-one
basketball.
Both Ward and Morgan mis
sed ill-advised shots on Stan
ford's next two trips
downcourt while USC re
established a comfortable
68-62 advantage.
After Miller and Perry traded
hoops, Widtfeldt layed one in
over Belton, who was called for
blocking on the play.
Widtfeldt's ensuing free
throw gave LJSC a 7 5-64 lead
with just two minutes left, and
if Stanford had any thoughts of
achieving a miraculous victory,
Trojan guard Don Carfino
erased them with two free
throws and a breakaway slam
dunk.

In his post-game comments,
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
chose to dwell on the Cards'
trouble with USC's press.
"What took us out of the
game was our failure to exe
cute on the press," he said.
Dißiaso disdained the
suggestion that guard Paul
Ciovacchini, an adept ball
handler who missed the game
with an injured left hamstring,
might have been able to help
the Cards solve the press.
"Normally, I would assume
yes, Paul would help," said Di-
Biaso, "but we're in our 26th
game, and the press should not
be a factor at this time. We just
played a team that had a great
press (Oregon St.), and we
handled it them. Tonight we
didn't."
Another force Stanford
couldn't handle was 6-foot-7
forward Miller. The Trojan
sophomore led all scorers with
22 points on 10-for-12 shooting
and also ripped eight re
bounds.
"In my opinion, Miller
showed what he means to our
team," commented Boyd.
"Late in the game he made a
great steal, got critical re
bounds and played great de
fense on Belton."
Freshman Ward scored a col
legiate career-high 16 points to
lead Stanford. The 6-7 leaper
displayed a soft touch in hitting
7-of-11 shots from the floor.

Tomorrow evening the
Cards travel uptown to Pauley
Pavilion, home of No. I ranked
UCLA, which Stanford de
feated Dec. 27, 75-72.
Dißiaso scoffed at any
suggestion of a letdown
against the Bruins, the Cards'
final opponent for the year. "II
you're a basketball player, and
you're not ready to play at
Pauley, then you can't call
yourself a basketball player,"
he said.

KIMBfcRI V BEIiON puts one up in Monday night's contest against
the Oregon State Beavers, the Cardinals won their lionie tinale
against the Beavers 79-76. In last night's match up against USC, the
Cards lost by a score of 79-68.
Los Angeles — Three basic
problems — those which have
been plaguing Stanford's bas
ketball team all season —
haunted the Cardinals in the
first half last night against USC,
and eventually proved to be an
unerasable stigma, as the
Trojans triumphed 79-68 at the
Los Angeles Memorial Sports
Arena.
First, Stanford displayed a
remarkable inability to handle
the Trojans man-to-man full
court press. Kimberly Belton
and Wolfe Perry each attemp
ted to complete passes to the
spectators in the $5 seats while
being harrassed by theTrojans.
Second, the Cards failed to
keep USC off the offensive
boards and get rebounds 01
their own. Stanford was out
rebounded 20-9 in the first half,
and Belton was the only Card
to garner more than three
caroms.
Finally, free throws, which
has been the albatross around
Stanford's neck this season,
kept the Cards from staying
close to USC in the first half.
Presented with this delecta
ble assortment of turnovers
(the basketball kind) and mis
takes, USC couldn't help but
take advantage and stuff its
stomach with points, taking a
43-31 lead at halftime.
Before their deficiencies
caught up with them, the Cards

roamed tree and easy on of
fense, actually controlling the
action during the opening mi
nutes.
Belton's free throw, reverse
loop-the-loop lay-in and six
foot banker keyed a modest
but effective 7-2 streak that
gave Stanford a 13-8 lead, its
largest, with 13:05 left in the
half.
The Trojans fought back to
take the lead 14-13 on two bas
kets by Maurice Williams and
another by Doug Widtfeldt.
The two clubs then battled
through three score ties in the
next four minutes before USC
slowly but inexorably revealed
Stanford's tender spots.
Leading just 27-26, the Tro
jans stretched their advantage
t033-26 with4:oo left in the first
half on Purvis Miller's seven
footer, Steve Smith's two free
throws and Widtfeldt's pair of
charity tosses.
USC didn't do this damage,
however, without the Cards'
aforementioned self
destruction.
What made these errors so
unfortunate was the fact that
Stanford truly played a strong
second half. On the strength of
Perry's corner jumper, Or
lando Ward's three-point play
and floating banker, and
Daryle Morgan's back-door
lay-in, the Cards cut USC's lead
to 45-40 with 16:28 remaining.
Miller and Smith each re

taliated with baskets giving the
Trojans a nine-point cushion,
but the undaunted Cards kept
hounding USC, coming within
five points on five other occa
sions.
Stanford's strongest
second-half threat surfaced
with less than five minutes to
play and USC holding tight to a
65-58 lead.
Perry hit two free throws,
again shaving the margin to
five, and freshman guard Doug
Marty stole the ball and canned
a 15-footer with 4:19 left to
bring Stanford within 65-62.
Yet at this point Stanford
forgot about the solid team of
fense which had worked well
for them and instead yielded to
the temptations of one-on-one
basketball.
Both Ward and Morgan mis
sed ill-advised shots on Stan
ford's next two trips
downcourt while USC re
established a comfortable
68-62 advantage.
After Miller and Perry traded
hoops, Widtfeldt layed one in
over Belton, who was called for
blocking on the play.
Widtfeldt's ensuing free
throw gave LJSC a 7 5-64 lead
with just two minutes left, and
if Stanford had any thoughts of
achieving a miraculous victory,
Trojan guard Don Carfino
erased them with two free
throws and a breakaway slam
dunk.

In his post-game comments,
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
chose to dwell on the Cards'
trouble with USC's press.
"What took us out of the
game was our failure to exe
cute on the press," he said.
Dißiaso disdained the
suggestion that guard Paul
Ciovacchini, an adept ball
handler who missed the game
with an injured left hamstring,
might have been able to help
the Cards solve the press.
"Normally, I would assume
yes, Paul would help," said Di-
Biaso, "but we're in our 26th
game, and the press should not
be a factor at this time. We just
played a team that had a great
press (Oregon St.), and we
handled it them. Tonight we
didn't."
Another force Stanford
couldn't handle was 6-foot-7
forward Miller. The Trojan
sophomore led all scorers with
22 points on 10-for-12 shooting
and also ripped eight re
bounds.
"In my opinion, Miller
showed what he means to our
team," commented Boyd.
"Late in the game he made a
great steal, got critical re
bounds and played great de
fense on Belton."
Freshman Ward scored a col
legiate career-high 16 points to
lead Stanford. The 6-7 leaper
displayed a soft touch in hitting
7-of-11 shots from the floor.

Tomorrow evening the
Cards travel uptown to Pauley
Pavilion, home of No. I ranked
UCLA, which Stanford de
feated Dec. 27, 75-72.
Dißiaso scoffed at any
suggestion of a letdown
against the Bruins, the Cards'
final opponent for the year. "II
you're a basketball player, and
you're not ready to play at
Pauley, then you can't call
yourself a basketball player,"
he said.
