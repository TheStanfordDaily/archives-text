Carter, Begin discuss Mideast
Washington — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin opened crucial talks yesterday with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, vowing that his government
"cannot be pressed into signing a sham" peace
treaty with Egypt.
In a tough arrival statement, Begin said Israel
was being asked to alter terms of a treaty with
Egypt that would make it "null and void."
But later, after meeting alone for nearly two
hours with Carter at the White House, the Israeli
leader said he was encouraged.
"There was not even one difficult moment," he
told reporters as he entered Blair House, the offi
cial guest house across Pennsylvania Avenue from
the executive mansion. "I think it was one of the
most important and constructive talks I ever had
with the president."
Two more meetings were set for Friday with no
indication when Begin would conclude his visit.
The U.S. is preposing that Begin and Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat exchange letters providing
that a Palestinian authority be set up on the west
bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza district.
Before Begin's arrival, diplomatic sources made
clear that the U.S. backs Egypt in the dispute over
the remaining issues blocking completion of a tre
aty.
Carter receives Chinese envoy
Washington — With an enthusiastic welcome
from President Jimmy Carter, the United States
and China established full diplomatic relations
yesterday for the first time in almost 30 years.
Temporarily setting aside his concerns about
China's 12-day-old invasion of Vietnam, Carter re
ceived diplomatic credentials from Chinese Am
bassador Chai Tse-min and declared, "I consider
this to be a momentous day in the historical evolu
tion of our nation. We consider this to be a great
opportunity for the future."
Chai pledged efforts to "further promote the
friendship between the two peoples."
U.S. Ambassador Leonard Woodcock was un
able to be in Peking for the occasion because his

swearing-in ceremony at the State Department
took place only Wednesday, two days after his
nomination was confirmed by the Senate. Wood
cock was en route to Peking yesterday.
In Peking, Treasury Secretary Michael Blument
hal hoisted the American flag over the U.S. em
bassy and welcomed the formal end to the long
Sino-American diplomatic estrangement.
Oil firms begin fuel sale limits
The squeeze in world oil supplies caused by the
Iranian revolution is filtering down to the Ameri
can consumer.
Oil companies yesterday began limiting sales of
gasoline and heating oil to dealers, and Texaco
said it would close 2200 gas stations in five states
over a three-year period.
Industry sources, meanwhile, said the United
States was on the verge of asking the world's in
dustrialized nations to cut their use of oil voluntar
ily. And Venezuela denied a report that it planned
to implement a nine percent crude oil price in
crease yesterday.
Motorists wanting to buy gasoline during March
from Texaco, Standard Oil of Indiana (which sells
Amoco brand fuel), Cities Service, Mobil, Atlantic
Richfield, Phillips Petroleum Co. and Continental
Oil may occasionally find the pumps empty.
Economic indicators drop again
Washington — The government's economic
barometer fell for the third straight month in
january, pointing to an economic slowdown later
in the year.
Economists disagree over whether there will be
an orderly decline or a deep recession at the end
of 1979, and President Jimmy Carter was pictured
as still confident there'll be no recession.
The 1.2 percent drop in the Commerce Depart
ment's index of leading economic indicators was
the steepest since a 3 percent decline in january
1975, which occurred toward the end of the na
tion's last recession.

The 1.2 percent decline followed decreases of
0.4 percent in November and 0.1 percent in De
cember. The index also declined for three months
in a row in the summer of 1977 but the economy
kept growing rapidly.
Voyager explores Jovian moons
Pasadena, Calif.— Information sent back to Earth
by the Voyager I spaceship, now soaring through
lupiter's bizarre flock of moons, should provide
clues to the origin and evolution of the solar sys
tem, a scienlist said yesterday.
The giant planet and the four largest of the 13
moons "from sort ot a mini-solar system unto
themselves," said Laurence Soderblom, deputy
leader of the Voyager imaging team. "The thing
that's exciting is that they exhibit regular trends
which are reminiscent of the solar system as a
whole."
For instance, he said in an interview, the closest
of the four large moons, 10, is a rocky, dry world
similar to our moon. Farther out, however, the
large moons become less dense and at least one
seems to be mostly water ice.
Stocks gain 7.02
New York — The stock market, taking in stride
a sharp drop in an index designed to forecast fu
ture economic trends, staged a broad-based rally
yesterday, recouping much of its loss from earlier
this week.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks,
after posting modest gains in the morning, pushed
ahead steadily throughout the afternoon and
finished with a gain of 7.02 point at 815.84.
Volume was a moderate 23.83 million shares,
down from 25.09 million in the previous session.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Lows in mid 30s
to mid 40s. Highs in mid 50s to low 60s.
