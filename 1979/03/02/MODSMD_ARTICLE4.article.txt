# For Stanford Little 11 delegates, gripes predominated conference
## 
### Rob Lempert Senior staff writer Last of two parts 
Late last Friday night, the Stanford
delegation to the Little 11 conference
had its first caucus in a basement
room of Philadelphia's University
Holiday Inn. It was a gripe meeting,
where each delegate voiced his or
her concerns on the two-day-old
conference.
The delegates complained of ev
erything from California jokes to the
"racist" nature of the conference.
Mostly they voiced the concern that

Little 11 was not developing the way
they had expected.

News analysis

This afternoon the Stanford dele
gation will again meet, and most
likely it will be another gripe session.
The official purpose is to discuss how
the delegation will implement what
was learned at Little 11, but one topic
that is sure to come up is whether
Stanford should again attend such a
conference.

From the viewpoint of the Stanford
delegates, Little 11 seemed to have
four basic and intertwined prob
lems: the inadequate preparation of
many delegates, the widely differing
positions of many of the Ivy
Leaguers, mistakes made by the con
ference hierarchy, and accusations
of racism.
Detailed research
Conference organizers had called
for detailed research to be done in
stated areas by all the delegates prior
to the start of the conference. Each
delegate was supposed to trade re
ports with all the other members of
his or her committee so that each
member would have some idea of
the programs at the other schools be
fore they convened in Philadelphia.
This never happened. At most, the
Stanford delegates received two re
ports each, and when the conference
started they found some schools had
not even finished their reports.
Committee meetings, instead of
being knowledgeable discussions on
specific problems, often became
show-and-tell sessions where dele
gates would read each other the con
tents of their reports.
Though Little 11 was hailed as a
meeting between students of differ
ing perspectives, this sometimes
proved to be too much the case.

Often the delegates failed to estab
lish a common ground for their dis
cussions.
At times difficulties arose simply
because some schools have prob
lems that others don't. For instance,
most schools at the conference have
little or no student government.
Stanford delegate Brett Kingstone
expressed constant frustration be
cause the Stydent Government
Committee chose to discuss the
problems of establishing student
governments rather than those of
running them.
However Joan Harrington, co
coordinator of the Stanford delega
tion, explained that it was expected
that in some committees Stanford
would do more teaching than learn
ing.
A more crucial difficulty was that
many eastern delegates failed to ap
preciate the problems raised by their
western counterparts.
The Extracurricular Affairs Com
mittee brushed aside Elisa Price's
question about the difficulties raised
by religious cults on campuses, and
Kathy Ferrington said her Student
Life Committee thought it so funny
that Flo Mo had a sun deck that they
failed to take seriously the security
problems these decks pose.
The organizational problems with

the conference seemed to stem
mostly from the fact that those who
planned and directed it failed to de
legate authority effectively.
Leonard Cinsburg, the Penn stu
dent who was the major force behind
the conference, was often com
mended for his hard work and perse
rverence in bringing all 10 schools to
Philadelphia.
But at times it seemed as if he was
monopolizing the entire decision
making process and could even be
seen tending to photocopying and
typing problems when more urgent
things needed attention.
Committee chairs were all chosen
before the conference began by the
planning committee, and while some
were very good, others were not so
popular with some of their dele
gates.
One delegate, to quiet a chairman
he found particularly detrimental to
the functioning of his committee,
passed around a joint at the start of
one committee session which essen
tially removed the chairman from the
rest of the meeting.
Minority boycott
The minority boycott was brought
about largely through organizational
problems, the attitudes of many of
the delegates, and a few bad deci
sions made at precisely the wrong

time.
The Minority Affairs Committee
listed three reasons for their with
drawal: inadequate minority partici
pation in the conference planning,
inadequate numbers of minority de
legates at the conference, and the
"attitude relating to discussion of
minority affairs."
They claimed there was a "signific
ant underrepresentation" of minor
ity delegates on committees other
than Minority Affairs. They also said
there was an "implicit assumption"
that discussion of issues important to
minorities were relegated only to the
Minority Affairs Committee.
Many delegates also felt that even
when these problems began to make
themselves apparent, the confer
ence planners did little to ease the
situation.
The night before they withdrew,
the Minority Affairs Committee was
evicted from their meeting room by
the hotel bouncer because Ginsburg
had forgotten to pay for their room.
Later that evening he told a repor
ter that he felt half of the minority
committee's membership should be
white. Then finally, when three black
women, upset about this comment
and the difficulties with the room
went to talk to him, Ginsburg had to
leave to tend to paperwork.
