# China proposes talks in Vietnam conflict
## 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) â€” While
Chinese troops fought indecisive
battles around a strategic Viet
namese provincial capital yesterday,
Chinese leaders in Peking proposed
peace talks to end the two-week-old
war.
The Chinese proposal to negotiate
was made in a note to the Viet
namese Embassy in Peking, accord
ing to Hsinhua, the official Chinese
news agency.
The message apparently did not
mention China's earlier demands
that Hanoi pull its forces out of Cam
bodia in exchange for a Chinese
withdrawal from northern Vietnam.
Hsinhua reported that China
proposed that both governments
"appoint a vice minister of foreign
affairs as a representative to meet at
an early date at a mutually agreed
place for concrete negotiations."
No immediate Vietnamese re
sponse to the peace overture was re
ported.
In its latest battle communique,
Hanoi said its troops had killed or
wounded 27,000 Chinese troops
since the invasion force drove into
Vietnam Feb. 17. It also claimed to
have knocked out 200 Chinese tanks.
These claims could not be inde
pendently verified. Intelligence
analysts say they believe Chinese

casualty figures given by Vietnam are
exaggerated.
The Soviet Union yesterday issued
another strong warning to China.
Premier Alexei Kosygin accused Pek
ing of a "brutal act of international
brigandage" and vowed that Soviet
allied Vietnam "will not be aban
doned in a time of trial."
Kosygin, in a Moscow speech, also
revived unconfirmed Soviet reports
that the Chinese are preparing to in

vade Vietnamese-dominated Laos,
and he declared, "The policy of ap
peasing the aggressor must not be
repeated."
Kosygii. also rejected China's call
for a mutual withdrawal of Viet
namese troops from Cambodia and
Chinese troops from Vietnam.
Japanese Foreign Minister Sunao
Sonoda, in his country's first expres
sion of opposition to the Chinese in
vasion of Vietnam, told the Parlia

ment in Tokyo yesterday that China's
actions were "unjust."
Bangkok sources said Vietnamese
forces in the key Lang Son provinc.e,
80 miles northeast of Hanoi, had re
pulsed Chinese troops near the city
of Lang Son and at nearby Loc Binh.
The Chinese then mounted
counter-attacks with tanks in the lead
and scored some successes in both
areas, the sources said.
