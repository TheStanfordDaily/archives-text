# Student group cooperates with co-op in a program to encourage recycling

In an effort to encourage recycling
at the consumer level, a small group
of students here and the California
Ave. Co-op Market in Palo Alto are
joining forces to design an in-store
informational program to illustrate
the advantages — both upon the en
vironment and the pocketbook — of
comparison shopping for recycla
bles.
Most organizations currently pub
licizing the reuse or recycling of
glass, metal, paper or other materials
base their campaigns on the assump

tion that individuals have already ac
quired products packaged in or
made of these substances.
The approach being taken by the
people in "Waste Age," a Stanford
Workshop on Political and Social Is
sues (SWOPSI) class, however, is a
very different one. They want to em
phasize the concept of recycling
even before the products are purch
ased.
By offering alternatives to re
source- and energy-intensive items,
recycling can be made more effi
cient, and consumers will be able to

take a more responsible and active
role in the process, they believe.
The SWOPSI group is planning in
store advertising that will point out to
potential purchasers which contain
ers can be readily reused or recycled.
During an experimental phase of the
program, displays along market
aisles and windows will provide re
cycling tips, while later plans tenta
tively call for labeling individual con
tainers to further aid consumers, ac
cording to Bob Wenzlau, one of the
class leaders and program coor
