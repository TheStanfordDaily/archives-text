# Student group cooperates with co-op in a program to encourage recycling
## 
### Dean Eyre 
In an effort to encourage recycling
at the consumer level, a small group
of students here and the California
Ave. Co-op Market in Palo Alto are
joining forces to design an in-store
informational program to illustrate
the advantages — both upon the en
vironment and the pocketbook — of
comparison shopping for recycla
bles.
Most organizations currently pub
licizing the reuse or recycling of
glass, metal, paper or other materials
base their campaigns on the assump

tion that individuals have already ac
quired products packaged in or
made of these substances.
The approach being taken by the
people in "Waste Age," a Stanford
Workshop on Political and Social Is
sues (SWOPSI) class, however, is a
very different one. They want to em
phasize the concept of recycling
even before the products are purch
ased.
By offering alternatives to re
source- and energy-intensive items,
recycling can be made more effi
cient, and consumers will be able to

take a more responsible and active
role in the process, they believe.
The SWOPSI group is planning in
store advertising that will point out to
potential purchasers which contain
ers can be readily reused or recycled.
During an experimental phase of the
program, displays along market
aisles and windows will provide re
cycling tips, while later plans tenta
tively call for labeling individual con
tainers to further aid consumers, ac
cording to Bob Wenzlau, one of the
class leaders and program coor
dinator for Palo Alto's Curbside Re
cycling program.
The class has chosen three levels
of classification for containers within
the Co-op market. The most desira
ble from a recycling perspective are
returnable glass bottles, followed by
recyclable metal, while plastic
materials such as bottles, plastic
wrap or six-pack holders are the least
desirable. Displays explaining the
classifications are scheduled to go up
next week, Wenzlau explained.
Making the distinctions between
containers clear to consumers is the
main focus of the informational
posters, but in addition the benefits
of recycling in general will be stres
sed.
The class, led by Katy Swain,
Martha Watson and Wenzlau will of
ficially conclude at the end of winter
quarter, but the project will be
picked up spring quarter by an Ac
tion Research Liaison Office (ARLO)
project, entitled "Consumer Educa
tion in Local Supermarkets to Reduce
Solid Waste."
By the time the ARLO class con
venes, a measure of consumer reac
tion to the Co-op program should be
available. Objective results will be
derived by comparing sales of both
recyclable and non-recyclable
goods before and during the educa
tional activity.
