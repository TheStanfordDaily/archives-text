# Nobel laureates want Soviet persecution ended
## 
### 
Washington, D.C. — Emeritus Chemistry Prof. Paul Flory, a 1974 Nobel
Prize winner, has joined 11 other Nobel laureates and 2400 American
scientists in pledging curtailment of scientific cooperation with Soviet
Union until persecution of Soviet scientists ends.
The pledge consisted of two statements released yesterday at a press
conference here by Scientists for Orlov and Shcharansky (SOS).
SOS is an ad hoc group of scientists working in the nation's leading
universities, laboratories and medical schools who oppose the impris
onment of physicist Yuri Orlov and computer scientist Anatoly
Shcharansky.
One statement, signed by 1744 scientists, is a pledge to "withhold all
personal cooperation with the Soviet Union until Orlov and
Shcharansky are released."
The other statement, signed by 664 scientists, does not preclude
participation in existing exchange programs for its signers, but commits
them to boycotting international conferences in the Soviet Union, to
oppose the enlargement of U.S.-Soviet exchange programs and to
campaign against transfer of sophisticated technology and granting of
most-favored-nation status to the Soviet Union.
Last year, Flory withdrew his acceptance of an invitation from the
Soviet Academy of Sciences to deliver the opening lecture at a sym
posium on macromolecular chemistry in Tashkent, citing as his
"foremost" reason for withdrawal "the specter of recent trials and
current persecutions of scientists who, according to the evidence avail
able, are guilty of no offense other than expression of their views, and
their insistence that the inalienable rights of individuals be respected."
Flory yesterday said in a prepared statement that "the repressive
measures currently perpetrated in the Soviet Union are blatantly inimi
cal to the free exchange of ideas that is essential for scientific coopera
tion and collaboration."
