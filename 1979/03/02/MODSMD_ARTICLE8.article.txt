# U.S. Mideast policy under fire from Arab nations
## 
### 
Jbeirut, Lebanon (AP) —
American foreign policy in the
Middle East is coming underat
tack from Arabs of the left,
right and center. Even tradi
tional friends are grumbling.
, .Basically, President Jimmy
Carter's administration is
caught in a squeeze between
,those who say Washington is
not doing enough and those
who say it is interfering too
much.
• Since the Islamic-leftist re
volution in Iran swept the
American-backed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi off
his throne, Washington's allies
in the Arab world have expres
sed concern about the strength
and sincerity of the U.S. com
mitment to them.
Recent developments in
clude:
v— Crown Prince Fahd of
Saudi Arabia abruptly post
ppned a mid-March trip to
Washington that Carter had
hoped would soothe Saudi an

xieties over security in the Per
sian Gulf and U.S.-sponsored
peace talks between Egypt and
Israel.
— Morroco's King Hassan
threatened this week to turn to
Moscow to buy weapons be
cause of what he felt was U.S.
dallying on arms requests.
— The foreign minister of
oil-rich Kuwait added his voice
to the leftist chorus denounc
ing statements by Carter aides
that the United States would
intervene militarily, if approp
riate, to protect its vital oil in
terests in the Middle East.
— Jordan's King Hussein has
taken an increasingly critical
view of the Camp David ac
cords between Israel and
Egypt-
After the fall of the shah,
most Arab regimes do not want
to be identified too closely
with the United States. The
Iranian Islamic revolution has
caused these governments to
become more sensitive to pub

lic opinion at home.
And some observers say the
continuing stalemate in the
American-sponsored Middle
East peace talks has
strengthened Arab suspicions
that the United States is back
ing a loser in Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat. Many Arab
leaders also believe that Israel
is not genuinely interested in a
just peace settlement.
Most dismaying to America's
allies is a growing perception
of the Carter administration as
indecisive and bumbling.
As an example, after U.S.
Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger said it was con
ceivable that America might in
tervene militarily in the Middle
East, Vice President Walter
Mondale denied any U.S. in
tention of establishing a milit
ary presence in the Persian
Gulf. This prompted promi
nent Beirut columnist Michel
Abu Jawdeh to comment:

"This is not strange, because
Schlesinger is President ]immy
Carter before noon and Mon
dale is President Carter after
noon."
A growing concern among
Arab political observers who
are not unsympathetic to
America is that Washington is
pursuing an old, unsuccessful
formula of playing on anti
communist fears and trying to
assure stability by sending
more weapons.
"Arabs, by and large, have
been as averse to the Soviet
thesis that the immediate
threat to the Arab is Western
imperialism as they have been
toward the Western claim that
communism is the paramount
enemy," said a recent com
mentary in Beirut's Middle Fast
Reporter weekly.
These observers see Ameri
ca's arming of the Sadat regime
as a potential replay of its
foreign policy in Iran.
At the same time, however,
the Carter administration has
been criticized by Arab friends
for not supplying enough
arms. In addition tocomplaints
by Morocco's Hassan, the
Saudis reportedly were miffed

that the United States has re
fused to supply weapons to the
Somalia regime of Siad Barre,
who kicked the Soviets out of
his east African country last
year.
The American argument is
that Washington can not get
involved in Somalia's fight with
Ethiopia over the disputed
Ogaden region. The Saudis are
worried about Soviet en
croachment from across the
Red Sea.
Jordanian officials also re
cently complained that
Washington was turning over a
squadron of F-5 jets, promised
to Jordan, to North Yemen, a
pro-Western Saudi neighbor
embroiled in a border war with
pro-Soviet South Yemen.
A major factor in Saudi
Arabia's apparent irritation
with the U.S. government is
the belief that America has not
demonstrated the proper
gratitude for Saudi efforts to
hold down oil prices and fill the
oil shortage created by the
shutdown of Iranian oil pro
duction.
In general, questions about
U.S. policy at a time of instabil
ity in the Persian Gulf has

prompted both radical and
conservative governments to
re-examine their superpower •
alliances.
"The Iranian lesson is that

we have to pay more attention
to public needs and rely on
ourselves for our own sec
urity," said a Persian Gulf dip
lomat in Beirut.

Gulf. This prompted promi

"This is not strange, because
Schlesinger is President ]immy
Carter before noon and Mon
dale is President Carter after
noon."
A growing concern among
Arab political observers who
are not unsympathetic to
America is that Washington is
pursuing an old, unsuccessful
formula of playing on anti
communist fears and trying to
assure stability by sending
more weapons.
"Arabs, by and large, have
been as averse to the Soviet
thesis that the immediate
threat to the Arab is Western
imperialism as they have been
toward the Western claim that
communism is the paramount
enemy," said a recent com
mentary in Beirut's Middle Fast
Reporter weekly.
These observers see Ameri
ca's arming of the Sadat regime
as a potential replay of its
foreign policy in Iran.
At the same time, however,
the Carter administration has
been criticized by Arab friends
for not supplying enough
arms. In addition tocomplaints
by Morocco's Hassan, the
Saudis reportedly were miffed

that the United States has re
fused to supply weapons to the
Somalia regime of Siad Barre,
who kicked the Soviets out of
his east African country last
year.
The American argument is
that Washington can not get
involved in Somalia's fight with
Ethiopia over the disputed
Ogaden region. The Saudis are
worried about Soviet en
croachment from across the
Red Sea.
Jordanian officials also re
cently complained that
Washington was turning over a
squadron of F-5 jets, promised
to Jordan, to North Yemen, a
pro-Western Saudi neighbor
embroiled in a border war with
pro-Soviet South Yemen.
A major factor in Saudi
Arabia's apparent irritation
with the U.S. government is
the belief that America has not
demonstrated the proper
gratitude for Saudi efforts to
hold down oil prices and fill the
oil shortage created by the
shutdown of Iranian oil pro
duction.
In general, questions about
U.S. policy at a time of instabil
ity in the Persian Gulf has

prompted both radical and
conservative governments to
re-examine their superpower •
alliances.
"The Iranian lesson is that

we have to pay more attention
to public needs and rely on
ourselves for our own sec

Jbeirut, Lebanon (AP) —
American foreign policy in the
Middle East is coming underat
tack from Arabs of the left,
right and center. Even tradi
tional friends are grumbling.
, .Basically, President Jimmy
Carter's administration is
caught in a squeeze between
,those who say Washington is
not doing enough and those
who say it is interfering too
much.
• Since the Islamic-leftist re
volution in Iran swept the
American-backed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi off
his throne, Washington's allies
in the Arab world have expres
sed concern about the strength
and sincerity of the U.S. com
mitment to them.
Recent developments in
clude:
v— Crown Prince Fahd of
Saudi Arabia abruptly post
ppned a mid-March trip to
Washington that Carter had
hoped would soothe Saudi an

xieties over security in the Per
sian Gulf and U.S.-sponsored
peace talks between Egypt and
Israel.
— Morroco's King Hassan
threatened this week to turn to
Moscow to buy weapons be
cause of what he felt was U.S.
dallying on arms requests.
— The foreign minister of
oil-rich Kuwait added his voice
to the leftist chorus denounc
ing statements by Carter aides
that the United States would
intervene militarily, if approp
riate, to protect its vital oil in
terests in the Middle East.
— Jordan's King Hussein has
taken an increasingly critical
view of the Camp David ac
cords between Israel and
Egypt-
After the fall of the shah,
most Arab regimes do not want
to be identified too closely
with the United States. The
Iranian Islamic revolution has
caused these governments to
become more sensitive to pub

lic opinion at home.
And some observers say the
continuing stalemate in the
American-sponsored Middle
East peace talks has
strengthened Arab suspicions
that the United States is back
ing a loser in Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat. Many Arab
leaders also believe that Israel
is not genuinely interested in a
just peace settlement.
Most dismaying to America's
allies is a growing perception
of the Carter administration as
indecisive and bumbling.
As an example, after U.S.
Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger said it was con
ceivable that America might in
tervene militarily in the Middle
East, Vice President Walter
