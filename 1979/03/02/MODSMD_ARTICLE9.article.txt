# 'Hamm' offers unique environment
## 
### Victoria Minden 
In 1961 Dag Hammarskjold,
the secretary-general of the
United Nations, was killed in a
plane crash while traveling to
the Congo on a peace mission.
A few months later he was
posthumously awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize.
Since 1972 the University has
memorialized the Swedish
born diplomat through its in
ternational theme house.
Hammarskjold House co-op is
the home of 26 foreign and
American graduates and un
dergraduates. The smallest
University residence, "Hamm"
offers a unique environment
where students can maintain
and develop part of their cul
ture without being totally ab
sorbed into American culture,
according to British resident
John Raper.
Hammarskjold's distinctive
ness begins with its location —
the house is tucked away on
Alvarado Row, far from the hub
of campus activity. Inside, the
renovated fraternity shows
further variation. Aside from
the usual coffee mugs, house
photos and peanut butter jars,
one finds Far Eastern news

papers, japanese chess boards
and a wall-sized world map.
The members of the house
are also unique. Residents are
chosen by a selection process
before the regular housing
draw. Usually about twice as
many students apply to get into
the house as are accepted, ac
cording to Jean Kitaji, housing
office supervisor for residen
tial education. The row office
fills the spaces in the house
with a balanced division of stu
dents, Kitaji said. They take
into account standard
priorities of sex and guaran
teed standing, but then they
look closely at geographic
background and special in
terest in the house theme.
Those not accepted can then
enter the regular draw.
This year Hamm House resi
dents represent Haiti, Sweden,
Pakistan, Czechoslovakia,
Mexico, Hong Kong, and other
countries. In addition, almost
all the residents have lived or
traveled abroad.
Hammarskjold draws from
this diversity in its house ac
tivities. Like other residences,
Hamm plans parties, bar
becues and talent shows and

has its share of spontaneous
midnight meals, beach trips
and volleyball games. But
other activities have a more
cultural tone: Hamm residents
have a reserved symphony box,
frequently invite guest lectur
ers, host concerts, and serve
several traditional dinners and
holiday celebrations.
The house co-sponsored the
Noam Chomsky talks last
month and currently joins with
Bechtel International Center to
host the Wednesday night Cafe
Al Fresco.
House sentiments reflect
general enthusiasm towards
the theme house. Because they
often come from long dis
tances and have little chance to
return home, members draw
together interests, skills and
ideas to make Hamm's envi
ronment pleasant and com
fortable, residents said.
Junior Igbal Walji of Tanzania
said he finds little difficulty
adapting simultaneously to the
American lifestyle and to many
other lifestyles as well. He said
that shared responsibilities in
cooking and cleaning promote
a sense of pride in the house.
Walji added that a health in
sepector rated Hammarskjold
the cleanest co-op on campus
last year.
Mealtimes provide spirited
entertainment, residents
claim, as small teams compete
forculinary variety. They laugh
over frequent disasters, such
as a strange pheasant dish still
sitting untouched in the
freezer, but agree that most
dinners prove memorable and
usually tasty. Hamm has Seat
ing associates, the most of any
row house.
Overall satisfaction in the
house is reflected in the firm
bonds established — many
students who live there return
for the two year limit and then
try to become eating as
sociates. This year's RA, Win
nie Luck, is an example — her
initial contact with the house
occurred five years ago. A flow
of visitors, some studying in
the lounge, some helping with
meals, some just chatting,
strengthens house ties. One
eating associate, a graduate
student in physics, claimed, "I

feel that this is the only place
on campus where I have any
ties at all."
Many Hammies agree that
house awareness of world af
fairs is extensive. On a campus
where, as residents put it, in
ternational news tends to be
minimal, Hamm maintains a
constant flow of information
from foreign sources. As one
student described, everyone
runs in at night yelling, "Guess
what happened today in my
country?" During newscasts
the television room fills up
quickly and controversial is
sues often spark debates.
Though the house does not
claim an academic or political
theme, the many links to the
"outside world" help combine
study with broader learning
experiences. An American stu
dent complained that there's
so much to absorb from listen
ing to her neighbors that she
teels guilty crawling away with
textbooks.
Some residents complained
that Hamm is virtually un
known to the general student
population. One student said
that a common response to "I
live in Hammarskjold House"
is "Whooo?? Is that the new
German Studies house?"
Raper explained that while the
l-Center tends to be the focal
point of international ac
tivities, Hamm is valuable to
the campus population as well.
Here, students can "make use
of our concentration of foreign
students, rather than randomly
coming across them," he said.
