# Writing contest challenges engineers
## 
### Fran Miller 
In order to encourage un
dergraduate engineering
majors to test and improve
their writing techniques, the
School of Engineering is spon
soring two contests in April.
These contests are part of a
larger Communications Pro
ject, directed by Ellen Nold,
designed to teach oral and
written communication skills
to engineering students.
The Dickman Writing Prize
contest, whose winner will re
ceive $500, will be composed
of two parts. Students wishing
to enter must appear in Terman
105 at 7:30 p.m. on Monday,
April 2. At that time they will be

given a writing task to be com
pleted by 10 p.m. the same
night.
According to Nold, this as
signment will consist of an en
gineering problem with a set of
facts. Students will have a
hypothetical audience such as
a supervisor, and must analyze
the problem and make re
commendations. Nold said
that this part of the contest will
"test students' ability within an
imagined professional situa
tion." The second part of the
contest will involve the rewrit
ing of a major document. Stu
dents may consult printed
sources but may not consult
other people before complet
ing the assignment by 5 p.m.

on April 9.
To enter the McKinney Writ
ing Prize contest, a student
must also submit a paper or re
port written foran engineering
professor. "Students must re
write the paper," said Nold,
"so that it can be understood
and be interesting to a wide
group of engineers. It's ex
tremely hard writing, and
something that engineers have
to do all the time," she added.
Nold said that students
should write as if their reports
were going to be published in
The Stanford Engineer, a new
biannual publication written
by engineering professors. The
magazine is composed of sev
eral project reports that are
comprehensible to people un
familiar with the authors' fields
of interest.
The students must submit a
copy of their original work
signed by the professor for
whom it was written, and three
copies of the revised work.
Although both engineering
contests have been held for

several years, Nold said that
this year's rules have been
"changed and tightened up" to
encourage rewrites.
Both contests will test stu
dents' use of the "layman's
language," according to Nold.
"In school, students write for
professors. In the real world
they must be able to write for
people who don't know a
damn thing about what they
(the engineers) are talking ab
out."
She said that the contests are
held "to encourage people to
think about different kinds of
audiences other than academic
ones."
Entries for the contests will
be judged by faculty and
alumni of the engineering
school and English professors.
Nold stated that she hoped to
bring in some outside working
engineers to judge the projects
as well.
The prizes and certificates
will be awarded at graduation,
June 17. Engineers may enter
one or both contests.
