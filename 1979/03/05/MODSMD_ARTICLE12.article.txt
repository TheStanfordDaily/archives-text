"The German-speaking
countries of Central Europe"
will be the topic of this year's
"Great Powers Seminar,"
sponsored by the Stanford
Alumni Association. The third
annual seminar will be held
March 10 and 11.
Prof. Walter Lohnes, chair
man of the German Studies
Dept. selected the seminar
topic which will focus on the
changing political, social and
cultural aspects of the
German-speaking Central
European countries (West
Germany, Austria, Switzerland
and East Germany) and their re
lationship to Europe and the
world.
Lohnes said common lan
guage and culture provide a
bond between the countries.
"They cannot be viewed as to
tally separate, though they are
divided by geographic bound
aries and irrevocable historical

events," Lohnes said.
The seminar will include five
lectures by prominent Univer
sity professor; in the fields of
history, religious studies, art,
political science and German
studies and four panel discus
sions, according to Marian
Player, program director of
Continuing Education.
History Prof. Gordon Craig,
will present a lecture on "The
State of Contemporary Ger
man Democracy: An Evalua
tion." Craig said he will
examine the development of
German democracy. Rather
than concentrate on past prob
lems and their possible recurr
ence, Craig will stress the im
portance of examining current
problems such as the gulf that
has been developing between
"radical" students and the rest
of society in the last 10 years.
Undergraduates can pay to
attend the seminar, Player said.
