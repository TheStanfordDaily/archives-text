## Marching to take back the night 
### 
Tomorrow evening there will
be a march to "take back the
night." For two hours, women
here can be safe as we walk
through campus in a non
violent show of strength. This
is a demonstration to protest
violence against women.
There have been dozens of
these marches across the
country. Thousands have par
ticipated. We need to let
people know that we do not
complacently accept violence
as a necessary evil in society.
We do not accept that women
should always have to walk in
fear. This goes beyond politics.
Rather, it is a humanitarian
issue — an action we can all
take.
In addition, we mean to
spread the word through direct
contact with people and
through news coverage of the
march that we do not accept
violent images of women in
media (i.e., women manacled,
beaten, or raped and liking it
on record covers, in
magazines, and movies, etc.)
Last quarter, a San Francisco
group came to the University
and presented a slideshow ex
posing these images. The pre
valence and acceptance of
them is frightening.
The march is also a non
violent show of strength. In a
group, we can be strong and
can be free to walk through
campus tonight safely — some
thing no woman is free to do

alone.
A few months ago there was
a march like this one in San
Francisco. Five thousand came
from all over the state and
country. The strength and
positive emotion gained from
participation is something that
everyone should be able to ex
perience.
The march is part of Wo
men's Week. This year, a var
ied group of women's organi
zations have come together to
present a week of women's
programming. We need this
time here at the University.
First, women's concerns are
often neglected in our tradi
tional studies.
Also, women of varied in
terests need to come together

to explore our commonalities
as well as to find strength from
our diversity. And from this
comes our theme for the
week: unity and solidarity
among all women.
There are activities of special
interest to Third World wo
men, off-campus and graduate
students and spouses, women
interested in religion and poli
tics. We have poetry, music,
theatre and dance. We chose
this week because Thursday is
International Women's Day.
By meeting together over the
past weeks, we have unco
vered a common concern we
would also like to stress: the
need for a women's center.
Space is critical: the presence
of space encourages women's

activities to take place; the
presence of centralized space
encourages use by campus
women, as well as communica
tion between groups. Our
needs have not been met so far
by the University. We hope
people will develop an aware
ness of the problem this week.
Tomorrow in White Plaza,
there will be a Women's Fair
and Rally. Please watch Once
Around the Quad for listings of
Women's Week activities. We
have something for everyone.
Show your support with your
presence.
