# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Bill Shirley Just a short story 
### 
And you will not allow Life to sit next to you on
the bus without talking to it, without really
recognizing it, without looking it in the face,
without grabbing it from its seat and dancing
with it up and down the aisle — You'll always
do more than ride along passively.
And for right now, you're fighting because you
see people trying to put you in a different seat
— somewhere not right next to life. You see
people who are embarrassed for you — who
because they're uneasy about your activity,
want you to sit elsewhere, where you can't
grab Life from its seat, where you can't touch
it.
And you fear not being able to reach out and
touch it. Scared to death of losing contact
with life like the others who, in their passive
ways, have.
And you're fighting the noise around you. With
white knuckles you're holding your seat. You
don't want to lose this precious seat, and you
won't let anyone take it away from you.
And it gets louder and louder.
And then softer and softer.
And finally you look out and all the people
around you are still there, and their mouths
are still talking, but you hear nothing.
And your hands relax because no one's pulling
you from your seat. No one ever was — they
couldn't; they couldn't even get out of their
own seats. You're the only one who could've
pulled yourself out.
And your shoulders fall relaxed; your legs stretch
out and you sink more deeply into your seat.
And you look at Life sitting next to you and
realize you've been spending too much time
watching the others.
And the others, as you turn your head back to
them, look beautiful.
And some are smiling, but it's never cynical.
Some frown, but now you reach to help.
Some sleep, but they aren't ignoring you.
Some laugh, and it's not at you. One is cry
ing, and you can get out of vour seat and walk
to him and cry next to him and walk back to
your seat. Your seat is always there, and your
neighbor, Life, always watches you.
And as you venture more often from your seat,

you look around and see people hanging on
to their own seats as you once did.
And one tells you that he is happy because he's
winning; he is beating his foes. And you ask
him who he's fighting, and he says the others
on the bus, and you look to the seats around
you, and you see many clinched hands
around seat cushions. Vou say, "Look here,
they can't even leave their own seats."
And he can't believe you. He strains his neck
while not lightening his grip. Then slowly the
hands relax and he sees that everyone's sit
ting normally enough, but all are attached at
the hands, fingers tight.
And then he looks at you and quickly starts to sit
down again. But he stops half crouched and
asks why you're in the aisle and where you're
going.
And you say that you wanted to see others as
they were and that now you're on your way
back to your seat.
And he asks you if he can come with you.
And you don't know what to think. This is diffe
rent, and you're not sure, but you don't say
no.
And so the two of you walk back to your seat, but
getting there, you see an empty seat next to
yours. Your Life has left.
And your lips part, but before you're given the
chance to not be able to say anything, he
leads the both of you to sit down.
And you talk, and you hearand see things which
haven't ever been known or conceived of
before. Vou feel as though compared to now,
Life was but a mirror, a mirror now replaced
with a window — it still throws a reflection,
but that's only one level of the view.
And the two of you sit together for several stops.
People get on the bus and people get off, but
you're not really noticing. Vou haven't that
need to see others as they are, for now you
know one as he is.
And yet finally, you begin to feel your legs' and
feet's presence.
And you rise and go into the aisle.
And you find no one clutching their seats — and
no seats to clutch.
