## Spring follies 
### 
The Spring quarter time
schedules are hot off the press
and pre-registration is here.
Old Union will have signed
away another three months of
your life by the Ides of March.
The new time schedules
come just when you're wallow
ing into the last crucial weeks
of the quarter, swamped by
unread books and unwritten
papers, facing unspectacular
performances on your finals.
But no matter how pathetic
the present situation, choosing
new classes is like browsing
through the Sears Wish Book
in September. It's easy to be
stirred by the prospect of fine
studies in history, literature
and the sciences without wor
rying about the daily grind of
overdue assignments and
half-completed problem sets.
The typical approach is to
spend hours picking over the
time schedule, Courses and
Degrees and Course Abstracts,
carefully collecting enough
facts and information to write
up the syllabus for each class.
Then, while standing in line
to sign class lists, the guy in
front of you starts talking about
the great classes he's taking.
Before you know it, you've
crossed out I.E. 133 and signed
up for Astronomy and "Work
shop on Organic Gardening."
But one of the great things
about pre-registration is that it
demands absolutely no sense
of commitment. In temporary
overenthusiasm you sign up
for 23 units. By spring break
you have decided to drop four
of them; by the second week
of the quarter, another five.
And you inadvertently drop
your tennis class by sleeping

through the first two morn
ings.
The mechanics of registering
offer an unsolicited opportun
ity to experience a bureaucracy
functioning beyond its capac
ity. Get used to secretaries be
nevolently beaming as they re
commend that you "try the of
fice next door." A string of
these is enough to make you
transfer to Occidental or
Pomona.
First you have to track down
your PTR â€” that elusive but es
sential document. This usually
involves a mutually embarras
sing encounter with your ad
viser. You haven't been in to
visit since last quarter's regist
ration, and he wouldn't know
you from a brick wall.
PTR in hand, you wait until
your part of the alphabet gets
to register. This is usually one
of the last days, and your vis
ions of Basic Sailing are dashed
as you check in number 43 on
the waiting list. It's the same
kind of feeling as getting 4997
in the housing draw.
The most serious step of the
whole process is the cashier's
window. The University has
been in business a long time,
and they know you don't want
to pay. Stacks of yellow defer
ment slips are piled neatly en
route to the teller. The total
number of students maintain
ing a balance of $2175 in their
checking accounts could fit
comfortably into an MG.
The rest of us have about a
month to convince parents,
loan companies and scholar
ship donors that 12 units, a sun
tan and intramural volleyball
are worth the bucks.
