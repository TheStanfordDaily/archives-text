University remiss
During my term on the
Council of Presidents, I have
had my faith in the University's
commitment to undergraduate
education put to many tests.
But after a recent investigation,
I realize that I have never seen
the bottom line so clearly.
Last week, a student filed a
grievance in which he asked
where he could get a very small
sum of money in compensa
tion for the expenses he had
incurred while following up on
research problems posed by
his senior honors thesis. His
costs were simple: tapes and
special materials. He could not
afford to pay for these articles
and could not get the money
from financial aid.
He called his department
and was told there was no

money available for under
graduate research. He then
confronted SCIRE/SWOPSI
and was told they did not fund
projects of "this nature." He
called the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Office, the Office
of Undergraduate Studies, the
Office of the Provost, and the
Dean of Student Affairs. Not
only did they refuse him this
small amount of money, they
refused to suggest anything
else.
Since contacting this student
I have called over 60 depart
ments which undergraduates
most frequently choose as
their majors. Not one had any
money, however small, which
they could give to under
graduates with minor financial
problems in pursuing their
honors work. Two depart
ments had special prizes
awarded to one or two stu
dents per year, prior to the
completion of the project.
Since speaking to this stu
dent, I have polled students in
a wide range of departments,
and the problem of expenses
incurred in doing an honors
project is not unique. Nor is
the problem of having aspects
of research discouraged be
cause of minor cost an
noyances.
A response I commonly re
ceived from University staff
was "We do not have enough
money to fund the research of
our professors and graduate
students, let alone our under
graduates." Very candid in
deed.
Let us just ignore the argu
ment these people were trying
to get across for the moment
and look at what was expressed
inadvertently — that under
graduates are at the bottom of
the pile. Chances are, if the
money existed, it would go to
professors and graduates and
not to the undergraduate who
must be incapable of doing the
type of research that makes
this University what it is.
Well granted, perhaps few
undergraduates could write
the type of honors paper that
would shake the academic
world. But no one can con
vince me that we could not do
much better if we were not dis
couraged by cost, and more
important additional factors.
There are many things which
make a university great; one
could be a large number of un
dergraduates doing research
and doing it as well as
graduates.
But what was that commit
ment of which we spoke ear
lier? I seem to have forgotten
exactly the nature of that
commitment. At least I can rest
assured that I am in good com
pany.

Youth Service
Senator John Stennis and
Congressman Pete McCloskey
have pooled their collective
wisdc n and arrived at a plan
they euphemisticallycall Youth
Service. They warn us that our
military is unready and insuffi
cient. They scare us with politi
cal tactics that many of us
hoped this country had out
grown.
The notion that we will have
a better, more fit army if it's
made up of unwilling soldiers
is absurd. The reluctant soldiers
who were forced to serve this
country in our last war testify to
the futility of forcing soldiers
into battles they neither sup
port nor understand.
What makes this particular
proposal so insidious is that it
is an attempt to replace work
ers, whose families depend on
that income, with cheap forced
labor. The farmworkers, hav
ing fought so desperately for
the few rights they now enjoy,
face the prospect of being re
placed with conscripted labor.
It's apparent that McClos
key, despite the dimensions of
his personal integrity, does not
realize that a nation's strength
comes from the heart and fiber
of its people. The Shah of Iran
was incredibly armed and pre
pared but the preparations in
the end only demonstrated his
weakness. He fell with the
same inevitability that now
threatens the very existence of
our free United States.
With the walking wounded
of the Vietnam era all around
us, our government once again
prepares to demand of its
young people the strength it
lacks itself. The answer is no.
Young Americans will not
serve and die for a nation that
has lost its way.
The task of national leader
ship now is to restore the love
our people have in our society,
not to widen the schism of
societal misunderstanding by
further alienating yet another
generation of American youth.

Formula boycott
no solution
In her article on infant for
mula (Daily, Feb. 23), Cathy
Gewertz missed the critical is
sue. The problem rests not so
much with international cor
porations as with the poverty
of the mothers who use for
mula milk.
To blame multinationals and
boycott their products because
they sell an item that is abused
is no different from deadening

nerves to alleviate the pain of
an infection. The symptom dis
appears but the malady per
sists.
Poor mothers may accept
bottle feeding partly because it
may give them extra time for
work, because they may think
it modern and safer, and
perhaps because it makes a
drab life slightly more luxuri
ous.
For us to deny them such a
choice without allocating more
of our own resources to al
leviate their poverty is as much
a crime as any committed by
Nestle. Gewertz's article is an
example of liberalism that
salves conscience but solves
no problems.

Not a
'public appearance'
With reference to your
editorial "Keep it on the Re
cord'' (Daily, Feb. 27) please
note that the appearance at
Stanford of Richard Hefner,
chairman of the Film Rating
Board was in fact not a "public
appearance." Dr. Hefner was a
guest lecturer in Communica
tion 141.
While I agree with the basic
proposition that public lec
tures are, by their very nature,
on the record, it is good jour
nalistic practice to recognize
the difference between a pub
lic lecture and a classroom talk.
Not to do so would have a most
chilling effect on the free ex
change of ideas, which is a
fundamental aspect of
academic freedom.

Leave Mayfield
open
The budget: at least
$273,000.
The plan: to make Lomita
Drive into a thoroughfare bet
ween Flo Mo and Campus
Drive, and to close Mayfield
Avenue to automobile traffic.
Why is Mayfield to be
closed? So that the Mayfield
bicyclists and pedestrians can
go in peace, unthreatened by
the 9000 cars that every day
plague their existence.
What about the Lake
Lagunita bicyclists and pedest
rians? If a safety problem exists
now on Mayfield Avenue, it
will be doubled by transfering
the traffic to the fields behind
the lake: think of all the Lake
Lagunita joggers, or of all the
Campus Drive joggers heading
for the hills. And the Lagunita

fraternities and the Knoll as
well are understandably quite
upset about having 9000 cars a
day as their new neighbors.
Why not leave Mayfield
open, and reduce the traffic
problem by splitting the cars
between us?
Come, come, now; there's
no need to be greedy! We'll
take half, they can have half.
Let's use the Lomita Drive ex
tension to help solve the cam
pus traffic problem, not wor
sen it: leave Mayfield open.

A sad lesson
Teng Hsiao-Ping, China's
vice premier (also Communist
party vice chairman and army
chief of staff) repeatedly de
scribes his country's invasion
of Vietnam as a "lesson." It is
not the first to be learned by
observers of the current re
gime.
China's performance in An
gola, her cordial relations with
the Pinochet junta in Chile,
Teng's warm embrace of the
shah — a fellow advocate of
multinational-style "moderni
zation" — and, of course, the
new friendship with Nixon,
Carter and other politicians
represent the interests of
the Trilateral Commission.

All this and much more, in
cluding many betrayals of re
volutionary democratic institu
tions within China itself,
shapes up to an eloquent les
son.
Teng's apologists defend
China's new direction as an
expression of fear of the Soviet
Union. If that is so, it is a
grotesque and inhuman
rationale for the support of
exploitative and even fascistic
regimes, which with China's
aid are brutally decimating
progressive movements in the
Third World.
Teng's willingness to ravage
the north of Vietnam, inflicting
cruel pain on the people who
fought and suffered so long in
theirliberation struggle against
the French and the United
States, and his willingness to
incur thousands of casualties
among his own fellow coun
trymen, is indeed instructive.
One hopes that in a country
of over 900 million people
there are many who will con
test the power of the group
who are making a mockery of
the socialist revolution in
China. Meanwhile progressive
Americans should deny their
support to all politicians who
do not unequivocally go on re
cord to demand China's im
mediate withdrawal from Viet
nam.

of research discouraged be
cause of minor cost an
noyances.
A response I commonly re
ceived from University staff
was "We do not have enough
money to fund the research of
our professors and graduate
students, let alone our under
graduates." Very candid in
deed.
Let us just ignore the argu
ment these people were trying
to get across for the moment
and look at what was expressed
inadvertently — that under
graduates are at the bottom of
the pile. Chances are, if the
money existed, it would go to
professors and graduates and
not to the undergraduate who
must be incapable of doing the
type of research that makes
this University what it is.
Well granted, perhaps few
undergraduates could write
the type of honors paper that
would shake the academic
world. But no one can con
vince me that we could not do
much better if we were not dis
couraged by cost, and more
important additional factors.
There are many things which
make a university great; one
could be a large number of un
dergraduates doing research
and doing it as well as
graduates.
But what was that commit
ment of which we spoke ear
lier? I seem to have forgotten
exactly the nature of that
commitment. At least I can rest
assured that I am in good com
pany.

Youth Service
Senator John Stennis and
Congressman Pete McCloskey
have pooled their collective
wisdc n and arrived at a plan
they euphemisticallycall Youth
Service. They warn us that our
military is unready and insuffi
cient. They scare us with politi
cal tactics that many of us
hoped this country had out
grown.
The notion that we will have
a better, more fit army if it's
made up of unwilling soldiers
is absurd. The reluctant soldiers
who were forced to serve this
country in our last war testify to
the futility of forcing soldiers
into battles they neither sup
port nor understand.
What makes this particular
proposal so insidious is that it
is an attempt to replace work
ers, whose families depend on
that income, with cheap forced
labor. The farmworkers, hav
ing fought so desperately for
the few rights they now enjoy,
face the prospect of being re
placed with conscripted labor.
It's apparent that McClos
key, despite the dimensions of
his personal integrity, does not
realize that a nation's strength
comes from the heart and fiber
of its people. The Shah of Iran
was incredibly armed and pre
pared but the preparations in
the end only demonstrated his
weakness. He fell with the
same inevitability that now
threatens the very existence of
our free United States.
With the walking wounded
of the Vietnam era all around
us, our government once again
prepares to demand of its
young people the strength it
lacks itself. The answer is no.
Young Americans will not
serve and die for a nation that
has lost its way.
The task of national leader
ship now is to restore the love
our people have in our society,
not to widen the schism of
societal misunderstanding by
further alienating yet another
generation of American youth.

Formula boycott

In her article on infant for

much with international cor

To blame multinationals and

Poor mothers may accept

For us to deny them such a

Not a
'public appearance'
With reference to your
editorial "Keep it on the Re
cord'' (Daily, Feb. 27) please
note that the appearance at
Stanford of Richard Hefner,
chairman of the Film Rating
Board was in fact not a "public
appearance." Dr. Hefner was a
guest lecturer in Communica
tion 141.
While I agree with the basic
proposition that public lec
tures are, by their very nature,
on the record, it is good jour
nalistic practice to recognize
the difference between a pub
lic lecture and a classroom talk.
Not to do so would have a most
chilling effect on the free ex
change of ideas, which is a
fundamental aspect of
academic freedom.

Leave Mayfield
open
The budget: at least
$273,000.
The plan: to make Lomita
Drive into a thoroughfare bet
ween Flo Mo and Campus
Drive, and to close Mayfield
Avenue to automobile traffic.
Why is Mayfield to be
closed? So that the Mayfield
bicyclists and pedestrians can
go in peace, unthreatened by
the 9000 cars that every day
plague their existence.
What about the Lake
Lagunita bicyclists and pedest
rians? If a safety problem exists
now on Mayfield Avenue, it
will be doubled by transfering
the traffic to the fields behind
the lake: think of all the Lake
Lagunita joggers, or of all the
Campus Drive joggers heading
for the hills. And the Lagunita

fraternities and the Knoll as
well are understandably quite
upset about having 9000 cars a
day as their new neighbors.
Why not leave Mayfield
open, and reduce the traffic
problem by splitting the cars
between us?
Come, come, now; there's
no need to be greedy! We'll
take half, they can have half.
Let's use the Lomita Drive ex
tension to help solve the cam
pus traffic problem, not wor
sen it: leave Mayfield open.

A sad lesson
Teng Hsiao-Ping, China's
vice premier (also Communist
party vice chairman and army
chief of staff) repeatedly de
scribes his country's invasion
of Vietnam as a "lesson." It is
not the first to be learned by
observers of the current re
gime.
China's performance in An
gola, her cordial relations with
the Pinochet junta in Chile,
Teng's warm embrace of the
shah — a fellow advocate of
multinational-style "moderni
zation" — and, of course, the
new friendship with Nixon,
Carter and other politicians
represent the interests of
the Trilateral Commission.

All this and much more, in
cluding many betrayals of re
volutionary democratic institu
tions within China itself,
shapes up to an eloquent les
son.
Teng's apologists defend
China's new direction as an
expression of fear of the Soviet
Union. If that is so, it is a
grotesque and inhuman
rationale for the support of
exploitative and even fascistic
regimes, which with China's
aid are brutally decimating
progressive movements in the
Third World.
Teng's willingness to ravage
the north of Vietnam, inflicting
cruel pain on the people who
fought and suffered so long in
theirliberation struggle against
the French and the United
States, and his willingness to
incur thousands of casualties
among his own fellow coun
trymen, is indeed instructive.
One hopes that in a country
of over 900 million people
there are many who will con
test the power of the group
who are making a mockery of
the socialist revolution in
China. Meanwhile progressive
Americans should deny their
support to all politicians who
do not unequivocally go on re
cord to demand China's im
mediate withdrawal from Viet
nam.
Raymond Ciraud
Professor

University remiss
During my term on the
Council of Presidents, I have
had my faith in the University's
commitment to undergraduate
education put to many tests.
But after a recent investigation,
I realize that I have never seen
the bottom line so clearly.
Last week, a student filed a
grievance in which he asked
where he could get a very small
sum of money in compensa
tion for the expenses he had
incurred while following up on
research problems posed by
his senior honors thesis. His
costs were simple: tapes and
special materials. He could not
afford to pay for these articles
and could not get the money
from financial aid.
He called his department
and was told there was no

money available for under
graduate research. He then
confronted SCIRE/SWOPSI
and was told they did not fund
projects of "this nature." He
called the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Office, the Office
of Undergraduate Studies, the
Office of the Provost, and the
Dean of Student Affairs. Not
only did they refuse him this
small amount of money, they
refused to suggest anything
else.
Since contacting this student
I have called over 60 depart
ments which undergraduates
most frequently choose as
their majors. Not one had any
money, however small, which
they could give to under
graduates with minor financial
problems in pursuing their
honors work. Two depart
ments had special prizes
awarded to one or two stu
dents per year, prior to the
completion of the project.
Since speaking to this stu
dent, I have polled students in
a wide range of departments,
and the problem of expenses
incurred in doing an honors
project is not unique. Nor is
the problem of having aspects
of research discouraged be
cause of minor cost an
noyances.
A response I commonly re
ceived from University staff
was "We do not have enough

hoped this country had out
grown.
The notion that we will have
a better, more fit army if it's
made up of unwilling soldiers
is absurd. The reluctant soldiers
who were forced to serve this
country in our last war testify to
the futility of forcing soldiers
into battles they neither sup
port nor understand.
What makes this particular
proposal so insidious is that it
is an attempt to replace work
ers, whose families depend on
that income, with cheap forced
labor. The farmworkers, hav
ing fought so desperately for
the few rights they now enjoy,
face the prospect of being re
placed with conscripted labor.
It's apparent that McClos
key, despite the dimensions of
his personal integrity, does not
realize that a nation's strength
comes from the heart and fiber
of its people. The Shah of Iran
was incredibly armed and pre
pared but the preparations in
the end only demonstrated his
weakness. He fell with the
same inevitability that now
threatens the very existence of
our free United States.
With the walking wounded
of the Vietnam era all around
us, our government once again
prepares to demand of its
young people the strength it
lacks itself. The answer is no.
Young Americans will not
serve and die for a nation that
has lost its way.
The task of national leader
ship now is to restore the love
our people have in our society,
not to widen the schism of
societal misunderstanding by
further alienating yet another
generation of American youth.

Poor mothers may accept

Not a

With reference to your
editorial "Keep it on the Re
cord'' (Daily, Feb. 27) please
note that the appearance at
Stanford of Richard Hefner,
chairman of the Film Rating
Board was in fact not a "public
appearance." Dr. Hefner was a
guest lecturer in Communica
tion 141.
While I agree with the basic
proposition that public lec
tures are, by their very nature,
on the record, it is good jour
nalistic practice to recognize
the difference between a pub
lic lecture and a classroom talk.
Not to do so would have a most
chilling effect on the free ex
change of ideas, which is a
fundamental aspect of
academic freedom.

Leave Mayfield
open
The budget: at least
$273,000.
The plan: to make Lomita
Drive into a thoroughfare bet
ween Flo Mo and Campus
Drive, and to close Mayfield
Avenue to automobile traffic.
Why is Mayfield to be
closed? So that the Mayfield
bicyclists and pedestrians can
go in peace, unthreatened by
the 9000 cars that every day
plague their existence.
What about the Lake
Lagunita bicyclists and pedest
rians? If a safety problem exists
now on Mayfield Avenue, it
will be doubled by transfering
the traffic to the fields behind
the lake: think of all the Lake
Lagunita joggers, or of all the
Campus Drive joggers heading
for the hills. And the Lagunita

fraternities and the Knoll as
well are understandably quite
upset about having 9000 cars a
day as their new neighbors.
Why not leave Mayfield
open, and reduce the traffic
problem by splitting the cars
between us?
Come, come, now; there's
no need to be greedy! We'll
take half, they can have half.
Let's use the Lomita Drive ex
tension to help solve the cam
pus traffic problem, not wor
sen it: leave Mayfield open.

A sad lesson
Teng Hsiao-Ping, China's
vice premier (also Communist
party vice chairman and army
chief of staff) repeatedly de
scribes his country's invasion
of Vietnam as a "lesson." It is
not the first to be learned by
observers of the current re
gime.
China's performance in An
gola, her cordial relations with
the Pinochet junta in Chile,
Teng's warm embrace of the
shah — a fellow advocate of
multinational-style "moderni
zation" — and, of course, the
new friendship with Nixon,
Carter and other politicians
represent the interests of
the Trilateral Commission.

All this and much more, in
cluding many betrayals of re
volutionary democratic institu
tions within China itself,
shapes up to an eloquent les
son.
Teng's apologists defend
China's new direction as an
expression of fear of the Soviet
Union. If that is so, it is a
grotesque and inhuman
rationale for the support of
exploitative and even fascistic
regimes, which with China's
aid are brutally decimating
progressive movements in the
Third World.
Teng's willingness to ravage
the north of Vietnam, inflicting
cruel pain on the people who
fought and suffered so long in
theirliberation struggle against
the French and the United
States, and his willingness to
incur thousands of casualties
among his own fellow coun
trymen, is indeed instructive.
One hopes that in a country
of over 900 million people
there are many who will con
test the power of the group
who are making a mockery of
the socialist revolution in
China. Meanwhile progressive
Americans should deny their
support to all politicians who
do not unequivocally go on re
cord to demand China's im
mediate withdrawal from Viet
nam.
Raymond Ciraud
Professor
French
University remiss
During my term on the
Council of Presidents, I have
had my faith in the University's
commitment to undergraduate
education put to many tests.
But after a recent investigation,
I realize that I have never seen
the bottom line so clearly.
Last week, a student filed a
grievance in which he asked
where he could get a very small
sum of money in compensa
tion for the expenses he had
incurred while following up on
research problems posed by
his senior honors thesis. His
costs were simple: tapes and
special materials. He could not
afford to pay for these articles
and could not get the money
from financial aid.
He called his department
and was told there was no

money available for under
graduate research. He then
confronted SCIRE/SWOPSI
and was told they did not fund
projects of "this nature." He
called the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Office, the Office
of Undergraduate Studies, the
Office of the Provost, and the
Dean of Student Affairs. Not
only did they refuse him this
small amount of money, they
refused to suggest anything
else.
Since contacting this student
I have called over 60 depart
ments which undergraduates
most frequently choose as
their majors. Not one had any
money, however small, which
they could give to under
graduates with minor financial
problems in pursuing their
honors work. Two depart
ments had special prizes
awarded to one or two stu
dents per year, prior to the
completion of the project.
Since speaking to this stu
dent, I have polled students in
a wide range of departments,
and the problem of expenses
incurred in doing an honors
project is not unique. Nor is
the problem of having aspects
of research discouraged be
cause of minor cost an
noyances.
A response I commonly re
ceived from University staff
was "We do not have enough
money to fund the research of
our professors and graduate
students, let alone our under
graduates." Very candid in
deed.
Let us just ignore the argu
ment these people were trying
to get across for the moment
and look at what was expressed
inadvertently — that under
graduates are at the bottom of
the pile. Chances are, if the
money existed, it would go to
professors and graduates and
not to the undergraduate who
must be incapable of doing the
type of research that makes
this University what it is.
Well granted, perhaps few
undergraduates could write
the type of honors paper that
would shake the academic
world. But no one can con
vince me that we could not do
much better if we were not dis
couraged by cost, and more
important additional factors.
There are many things which
make a university great; one
could be a large number of un
dergraduates doing research
and doing it as well as
graduates.
But what was that commit
ment of which we spoke ear
lier? I seem to have forgotten
exactly the nature of that
commitment. At least I can rest
assured that I am in good com
pany.
