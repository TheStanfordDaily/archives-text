in a Hiring, commando-like operation, two adventurous Larkin House resi
dents hoisted a banner to the top of Hoover Tower Saturday night. The
banner, which read "Larkin Above All," was signed at the bottom by "Alan
and Richard." The students in the all-freshman dorm had clamped a pulley to
a rain gutter just below the windows of the observation deck Friday. Fishing
line ran from the pulley to the ground. The Larkinites then tied a rope to this
line and raised the banner. When located by a Daily reporter and questioned
about his motives, Alan only replied, "That's the kind of guys we are. I love
you, but get out of here."
