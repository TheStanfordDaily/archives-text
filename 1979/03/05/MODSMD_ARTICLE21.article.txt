# Overseas programs: a long way since Beutelsbach

Frisbees whiz across the

students discuss Chaucer in
Lady Astor's famed livin
groom; three Stanford
couples, well bundled in
down jackets and wool coats
against the January cold,
waltz down Kartnerstrasse,
Vienna's Fifth Avenue.
One wonders what Sen. Le
land and Jane Stanford would
say to the international
backpack set of under
graduates who study over
seas each year, sporting Stan
ford T-shirts from Berlin to
Salamanca. They return to the
Farm with eyes opened wide,
having seen far beyond the
sunbleached sandstone and
red tile roofs of Stanford's
California country club, often
saying that studying overseas
was the most significant edu
cational experience of their
undergraduate years.

The Stanfords, no doubt,
would be pleased that the
kids down on the Farm have
the chance to see "Gay
Paree," and much, much
more.
Stanford has five residen
tial programs designed for
general studies students —
Berlin, Cliveden, Florence,
Tour and Vienna; three
University-affiliated prog
rams for students with ad
vanced language training —
Bonn, Paris and Salamanca;
and three cooperative prog
rams with other American
universities in Africa, Brazil
and Peru. These programs
permit one-third of the stu
dents to study abroad at some
time in their undergraduate
career.
In 1958, with the opening of
the first overseas campus in
Beutelsbach, Germany, Uni
versity President Wallace
Sterling said, "We feel this is
a truly pioneering venture in
American education." The
overseas studies program has
weathered growing pains,

budget cuts, changing stu
dent attitudes and interest,
and a massive reorganization
in the early '70s. But now the
program is looking toward an
active future, maintaining the
same pioneering spirit of
over 20 years ago.
'We come to learn'
At the opening ceremonies
of the Beutelsbach campus,
one sentence of Emeritus
German Prof. William
Strothmann's address to
German and American dig
nitaries and Stanford stu
dents reverberated through
the German press: "We
come to learn."
"In the '50s, we were con
cerned about parochialism,"
said Fred Glover, then assis
tant to the president and
pioneer of the campuses in
Beutelsbach, Tour and Flor
ence. "We felt that Stanford
students were somewhat iso
lated and needed to heighten
and broaden their horizons."
Glover said there were
three main goals in establish
ing a program in Germany.

"We wanted to teach courses
overseas which could be
taught better there; we
wanted to expose students to
a foreign culture and give
them a fluency in German;
and we hoped to give stu
dents the opportunity for
close contact with outstand
ing faculty."
The idea was approved by
the general studies commit
tee and President Wallace
Sterling gave his "benign
blessing." In the summer of
1957, Robert Walker, director
of the overseas campuses
until 1972, received a cable
from Strothmann reading:
"Have found Shangri-la."
This discovery, out of a Ger
manic Los Horizons, was
Landgut Burg, a 30-acre estate
high atop a hill overlooking
the town of Beutelsbach and
the Rems valley, 12 miles
south of Stuttgart.
Walker said that the deci
sion to locate campuses out
side of major cities — a fact
which later received strong
criticism from students —
was due both to the difficulty
in locating a building that
could accommodate 60 or 70
people and "because we
wanted to keep a kind of col
legiate atmosphere and em
phasize the faculty-student
relationship."
Two faculty members
moved abroad and taught
courses which fulfilled the
general studies requirement,
while native instructors
taught the intensive language
courses. Classes were in ses
sion four days a week, with
the long weekend being used
for travel and field trips. Stu
dents were required to stay
overseas for six months,
either from June to De
cember, or January to June.
Whilestudentspaidfull tui
tion and room and board, the
then-favorable exchange rate
allowed the University to fur
nish transportation to the
campus. "All this became the
pattern for future cam
puses," Walker said.
In June 1958, 63 carefully
selected students left for
their first taste of German
beer — Stanford had dubi
ously lessened their liquor
laws in light of the national
customs of Germany. It was
their first experience of living
in a coed dorm, which was
necessary because of the li

mited space available. For the
majority, it was their first ex
perience of being in Europe.
Graduate School of Busi
ness Prof. David Montgom
ery and his wife, Toby, were
student members of the first
group. "There was a lot of
publicity both in Stanford and
in Germany, and we were
running around with stars in
our eyes," Montgomery said.
Intimacy
"A real intimacy developed
between the townspeople
and the students," Glover
said.
"We got all sorts of invita
tions, and many people were
practically adopted by
families," Montgomery said.
The friendships have en
dured, he added. "When we
returned to Beutelsbach 10
years later we went to the
same beer hall we used to go
to, and the owners were very
glad to see us. We talked for
hours."
Academic standards re
mained high, Montgomery
said. "We played hard on the

weekends, but we worked
hard during the week.
Everyone was serious about
their studies and we kept our
grades up. But," he laughed,
"part of this was because we
were all afraid of
Strothmann!"
Afraid or not, strong
friendships developed bet
ween the students and fa
culty, and among the stu
dents themselves. "The
group was closer than my
frat, and that says a lot,"
Montgomery said.
Profound effect
The overseas experience
had a profound effect on
Montgomery, as it did on
many students. "I left Stan
ford as an engineering major,
thinking the most fascinating
thing I'd ever see was an
electron whipping around
circuits. I found that what I
had set out to do was not as
interesting as I thought it was.
Coming home was tough; it
invoked some major soul
searching and re-evaluation

of life's goals."
With the success of the
Beutelsbach program, the
University began to look for
campus possibilities in other
countries. In 1960, campuses
opened in Florence and Tour.
"We thought Florence
would be the ideal place with
the Renaissance being part of
the community itself, and
since the villa was outside the
city, it was divorced from the
big city atmosphere," Glover
said. "In France we had con
sidered Caen (Normandy)
and Nice, but we took one
look ~t the bikinis and the
beach and decided that stu
dents would not take
academic experiences seri
ously there."
In 1965 a campus was
founded in Semmering, Au
stria. It was moved to Vienna
in 1967. A campus in Harlex
ton, England, followed in
1966, which in 1969 moved to
Cliveden, about 40 miles west
of London. The Berlin prog
ram opened in 1975.

Cliveden, home of the University's overseas center in England since 1969, has a history that dates
back to the mid-1600s. The center moved to the former estate of Lord Astor after three years in
Harlexton.

In 1958, with the opening of
the first overseas campus in
Beutelsbach, Germany, Uni

Sterling said, "We feel this is

'We come to learn'
At the opening ceremonies
of the Beutelsbach campus,
one sentence of Emeritus
German Prof. William
Strothmann's address to
German and American dig
nitaries and Stanford stu
dents reverberated through
the German press: "We
come to learn."
"In the '50s, we were con
cerned about parochialism,"
said Fred Glover, then assis
tant to the president and
pioneer of the campuses in
Beutelsbach, Tour and Flor
ence. "We felt that Stanford
students were somewhat iso
lated and needed to heighten
and broaden their horizons."
Glover said there were
three main goals in establish
ing a program in Germany.

"We wanted to teach courses
overseas which could be
taught better there; we
wanted to expose students to
a foreign culture and give
them a fluency in German;
and we hoped to give stu
dents the opportunity for
close contact with outstand
ing faculty."
The idea was approved by
the general studies commit
tee and President Wallace
Sterling gave his "benign
blessing." In the summer of
1957, Robert Walker, director
of the overseas campuses
until 1972, received a cable
from Strothmann reading:
"Have found Shangri-la."
This discovery, out of a Ger
manic Los Horizons, was
Landgut Burg, a 30-acre estate
high atop a hill overlooking
the town of Beutelsbach and
the Rems valley, 12 miles
south of Stuttgart.
Walker said that the deci
sion to locate campuses out
side of major cities — a fact
which later received strong
criticism from students —
was due both to the difficulty
in locating a building that
could accommodate 60 or 70
people and "because we
wanted to keep a kind of col
legiate atmosphere and em
phasize the faculty-student
relationship."
Two faculty members
moved abroad and taught
courses which fulfilled the
general studies requirement,
while native instructors
taught the intensive language
courses. Classes were in ses
sion four days a week, with
the long weekend being used
for travel and field trips. Stu
dents were required to stay
overseas for six months,
either from June to De
cember, or January to June.
Whilestudentspaidfull tui
tion and room and board, the
then-favorable exchange rate
allowed the University to fur
nish transportation to the
campus. "All this became the
pattern for future cam
puses," Walker said.
In June 1958, 63 carefully
selected students left for
their first taste of German
beer — Stanford had dubi
ously lessened their liquor
laws in light of the national
customs of Germany. It was
their first experience of living
in a coed dorm, which was
necessary because of the li

mited space available. For the
majority, it was their first ex
perience of being in Europe.
Graduate School of Busi
ness Prof. David Montgom
ery and his wife, Toby, were
student members of the first
group. "There was a lot of
publicity both in Stanford and
in Germany, and we were
running around with stars in
our eyes," Montgomery said.
Intimacy
"A real intimacy developed
between the townspeople
and the students," Glover
said.
"We got all sorts of invita
tions, and many people were
practically adopted by
families," Montgomery said.
The friendships have en
dured, he added. "When we
returned to Beutelsbach 10
years later we went to the
same beer hall we used to go
to, and the owners were very
glad to see us. We talked for
hours."
Academic standards re
mained high, Montgomery
said. "We played hard on the

weekends, but we worked
hard during the week.
Everyone was serious about
their studies and we kept our
grades up. But," he laughed,
"part of this was because we
were all afraid of
Strothmann!"
Afraid or not, strong
friendships developed bet
ween the students and fa
culty, and among the stu
dents themselves. "The
group was closer than my
frat, and that says a lot,"
Montgomery said.
Profound effect
The overseas experience
had a profound effect on
Montgomery, as it did on
many students. "I left Stan
ford as an engineering major,
thinking the most fascinating
thing I'd ever see was an
electron whipping around
circuits. I found that what I
had set out to do was not as
interesting as I thought it was.
Coming home was tough; it
invoked some major soul
searching and re-evaluation

of life's goals."
With the success of the
Beutelsbach program, the
University began to look for
campus possibilities in other
countries. In 1960, campuses
opened in Florence and Tour.
"We thought Florence
would be the ideal place with
the Renaissance being part of
the community itself, and
since the villa was outside the
city, it was divorced from the
big city atmosphere," Glover
said. "In France we had con
sidered Caen (Normandy)
and Nice, but we took one

beach and decided that stu

group was closer than my

Montgomery said.
Profound effect
The overseas experience
had a profound effect on
Montgomery, as it did on
many students. "I left Stan
ford as an engineering major,
thinking the most fascinating
thing I'd ever see was an
electron whipping around
circuits. I found that what I
had set out to do was not as
interesting as I thought it was.
Coming home was tough; it
invoked some major soul
searching and re-evaluation

of life's goals."
With the success of the
Beutelsbach program, the
University began to look for
campus possibilities in other
countries. In 1960, campuses
opened in Florence and Tour.
"We thought Florence
would be the ideal place with
the Renaissance being part of
the community itself, and
since the villa was outside the
city, it was divorced from the
big city atmosphere," Glover
said. "In France we had con
sidered Caen (Normandy)
and Nice, but we took one
look ~t the bikinis and the
beach and decided that stu
dents would not take
academic experiences seri
ously there."
In 1965 a campus was
founded in Semmering, Au
stria. It was moved to Vienna
in 1967. A campus in Harlex
ton, England, followed in
1966, which in 1969 moved to
Cliveden, about 40 miles west
of London. The Berlin prog
ram opened in 1975.

Cliveden, home of the University's overseas center in England since 1969, has a history that dates
back to the mid-1600s. The center moved to the former estate of Lord Astor after three years in
Harlexton.

One wonders what Sen. Le
land and Jane Stanford would
say to the international
backpack set of under
graduates who study over
seas each year, sporting Stan
ford T-shirts from Berlin to
Salamanca. They return to the
Farm with eyes opened wide,
having seen far beyond the
sunbleached sandstone and
red tile roofs of Stanford's
California country club, often
saying that studying overseas
was the most significant edu
cational experience of their
undergraduate years.

The Stanfords, no doubt,
would be pleased that the
kids down on the Farm have
the chance to see "Gay
Paree," and much, much
more.
Stanford has five residen
tial programs designed for
general studies students —
Berlin, Cliveden, Florence,
Tour and Vienna; three
University-affiliated prog
rams for students with ad
vanced language training —
Bonn, Paris and Salamanca;
and three cooperative prog
rams with other American
universities in Africa, Brazil
and Peru. These programs
permit one-third of the stu
dents to study abroad at some
time in their undergraduate
career.
In 1958, with the opening of
the first overseas campus in
Beutelsbach, Germany, Uni
versity President Wallace
Sterling said, "We feel this is
a truly pioneering venture in
American education." The
overseas studies program has
weathered growing pains,

budget cuts, changing stu
dent attitudes and interest,
and a massive reorganization
in the early '70s. But now the
program is looking toward an
active future, maintaining the
same pioneering spirit of
over 20 years ago.
'We come to learn'
At the opening ceremonies
of the Beutelsbach campus,
one sentence of Emeritus
German Prof. William
Strothmann's address to
German and American dig
nitaries and Stanford stu
dents reverberated through
the German press: "We
come to learn."
"In the '50s, we were con
cerned about parochialism,"
said Fred Glover, then assis
tant to the president and
pioneer of the campuses in
Beutelsbach, Tour and Flor
ence. "We felt that Stanford
students were somewhat iso
lated and needed to heighten
and broaden their horizons."
Glover said there were
three main goals in establish
ing a program in Germany.

"We wanted to teach courses
overseas which could be
taught better there; we
wanted to expose students to
a foreign culture and give
them a fluency in German;
and we hoped to give stu
dents the opportunity for
close contact with outstand
ing faculty."
The idea was approved by
the general studies commit
tee and President Wallace
Sterling gave his "benign
blessing." In the summer of
1957, Robert Walker, director
of the overseas campuses
until 1972, received a cable
from Strothmann reading:
"Have found Shangri-la."
This discovery, out of a Ger
manic Los Horizons, was
Landgut Burg, a 30-acre estate
high atop a hill overlooking
the town of Beutelsbach and
the Rems valley, 12 miles
south of Stuttgart.
Walker said that the deci
sion to locate campuses out
side of major cities — a fact
which later received strong
criticism from students —
was due both to the difficulty
in locating a building that
could accommodate 60 or 70
people and "because we
wanted to keep a kind of col
legiate atmosphere and em
phasize the faculty-student
relationship."
Two faculty members
moved abroad and taught
courses which fulfilled the
general studies requirement,
while native instructors
taught the intensive language
courses. Classes were in ses
sion four days a week, with
the long weekend being used
for travel and field trips. Stu
dents were required to stay
overseas for six months,
either from June to De
cember, or January to June.
Whilestudentspaidfull tui
tion and room and board, the
then-favorable exchange rate
allowed the University to fur
nish transportation to the
campus. "All this became the
pattern for future cam
puses," Walker said.
In June 1958, 63 carefully
selected students left for
their first taste of German
beer — Stanford had dubi
ously lessened their liquor
laws in light of the national
customs of Germany. It was
their first experience of living
in a coed dorm, which was
necessary because of the li

mited space available. For the
majority, it was their first ex
perience of being in Europe.
Graduate School of Busi
ness Prof. David Montgom
ery and his wife, Toby, were
student members of the first
group. "There was a lot of
publicity both in Stanford and
in Germany, and we were
running around with stars in
our eyes," Montgomery said.
Intimacy
"A real intimacy developed
between the townspeople
and the students," Glover
said.
"We got all sorts of invita
tions, and many people were
practically adopted by
families," Montgomery said.
The friendships have en
dured, he added. "When we
returned to Beutelsbach 10
years later we went to the
same beer hall we used to go
to, and the owners were very
glad to see us. We talked for
hours."
Academic standards re
mained high, Montgomery
said. "We played hard on the

weekends, but we worked
hard during the week.
Everyone was serious about
their studies and we kept our
grades up. But," he laughed,
"part of this was because we
were all afraid of
Strothmann!"
Afraid or not, strong
friendships developed bet
ween the students and fa
culty, and among the stu
dents themselves. "The
group was closer than my
frat, and that says a lot,"
Montgomery said.
Profound effect
The overseas experience
had a profound effect on
Montgomery, as it did on
many students. "I left Stan
ford as an engineering major,
thinking the most fascinating
thing I'd ever see was an

Coming home was tough; it

searching and re-evaluation
