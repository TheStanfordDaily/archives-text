# Cards outrun Fresno
## 
### Hobey Landreth 
Stanford Track Coach Payton
Jordan mentioned to the press
before Saturday's track meet
that Fresno "has given us trou
ble in the past" but his athletes
must not have been listening.
They outshowed Fresno 111-51
in Stanford Stadium.
Highlighting a near perfect
running afternoon for the Car
dinals was Bill Gail's record
breaking time in the 3000 meter
steeplechase of 8:53.6 which
shaved 4.8 seconds off the pre
vious record. Teammate Bill
Haldeman followed with an
8:59.0 and Fresno's George
Aguirre came in third at 9:13.4.
"We're really pleased with
the distance crew and the job
they did today," said Cardinal
running coach Dean Clark. "It
was a good mile, a good two
mile, great steeplechase, and
we're really pleased."
In the mile Mark Stillman
and Tom Lobsinger took first
and second for Stanford with
Stillman at 4:09.6 and Lob
singer at 4:09.8. Cardinal sprin
ters Darrin Nelson, Ken
Margerum, and Rick Gervais
were credited with sweeping
the 100-meter dash for the
Cards, and Gervais went on to
win in the 200-meter dash with
Nelson and Gordon Banks on
his heels. Banks also contri
buted a win in the 400 and Nel
son helped out with a long
jump of 25'2" on his first at
tempt of the day. This was
enough to equal the meet re
cord and place first for the af
ternoon.
These performances, com
bined with Dave Thomson's
win in the hammer throw,
Brian Holloway's second in the
shot put, and Rick Buss's win in
the discus throw, gave Stan
ford a commanding lead with
nine events still undecided.
Fresno's strength was in the
pole vault which they swept.
The visitors also took the high
jump on Dan McNamara's 6'4"
mark. Dennis Morely's 235'11"
Javelin throw was long enough
to win it for Fresno. Stanford's
Gary Bruner launched one for

209'11" and a second place
while Fresno man Gary
Raymond tallied 179'8" and a
third. The visitors took the tri
ple jump on David Zizzo's
47'8 3 A" mark, second was Stan
ford's Clay Bullwinkle at a close
47'8", and Fresno's Adrian
Richardson placed third at
45'10".
Cardinal freshman John
Schaer outran two Fresno men
in the 800-meter to win and
lower his personal best by over
a second. Stanford all but
swept the 400 intermediate
hurdles with Kurt Roessler and
Carry Shumway placing first
and second and Fresno's
Richard Easter edging into
thi rd by .2 of a second.

In the 100 high hurdles it was
Card Ken Margerum out in
front with Richard Easter of
Fresno placing second and
Stanford's Kurt Roessler com
ing in third.
Insult to injury for Fresno
came in the 400-meter relay
when a dropped baton on the
first pass cost them the race.
With the meet victory sealed
for the Cardinals, Roy Kissin,
Traig Corey and Rod Berry
teamed up to sweep the two
mile for Stanford. Witerer,
Margerum, McCarthy, and
Banks took the Mile Relay to
finish the afternoon.
The Cardinals will meet Oc
cidental at 1:15 March 10 in
Stanford Stadium.
