### 
Men's varsity tennis players
Matt Mitchell and Peter Re
nnert enjoyed their weekend,
winning the Pacific Coast Dou
bles title in Lajolla.
This is the second year in a
row that a Stanford team has
taken the tournament crown.
Lastyear John McEnroe and Bill
Maze won the series that was
rain-delayed and completed at
Stanford.
Ironically, Mitchell lost in
last year's finals along with
Perry Wright, who has since
turned pro. This year, how
ever, Mitchell and Rennert
looked impressive while beat
ing some tough competition.
Among the Cardinal duo's
more prominent victims were
Robert Van't Hof and Roger
Knapp of USC, who fell 7-6,7-5
in the semifinals.
Mitchell and Rennert went
on to trounce California's Chris
Dunk and Marty Davis 6-4, 7-6
in the finals yesterday."It was
an excellent win for Matt and
Peter," commented Stanford
coach Dick Gould.

Freshmen Scott Bondurant
and Tim Mayotte also joined
forces, though not as success
fully as Mitchell and Rennert.
Bondurant and Mayotte, after
surviving two rounds of com
petition, were defeated in the
Round of 16 by the indepen
dent team of Ted Williams and
Bob Wright.
Veterans Lloyd Bourne and
Jim Hodges managed to reach
the quarterfinals before falling
to UCLA's Blaine Willenborg
and Fritz Buehning3-6,6-4,7-5.
Tomorrow, the Cards face
Foothill College at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium for a 2:30
match and travel to San Jose
State Thursday.
Neither of these encounters
should be as challenging as the
three following matches
against Southern Methodist
University March 10, Texas
March 13 and Trinity March 15.
SMU and Trinity are two of the
country's better teams, and
Texas has been ranked in the
top 10.
