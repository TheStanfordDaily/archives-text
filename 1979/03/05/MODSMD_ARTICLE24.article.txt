# Gymnasts 'average,' place fourth at Pacific Southwest tournament
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Berkeley — Stanford finished
fourth in the Pacific Southwest
Gymnastics Championships
with what coach Sadao
Hamada termed an "average"
performance. Rather than
being an inconsistency, this
description indicates the po
tential attainable as the
talented but young squad gains
the experience to do better
than "average."
As expected, California top
ped the nine-team field, win
ning both Friday night's op
tional competition and the
Saturday afternoon compul
sories with a combined score
of 433.25. The Golden Bear
gymnasts also dominated the
individual portion of the two
day meet by filling 19 of the 48
entries and capturing firsts in
five of the six events.
USC finished a strong sec
ond at 422.65, followed by Cal
State-Fullerton in third with
416.95. As Hamada predicted,
Stanford took fourth place, to
talling 395.35 points.
"We did average overall,
especially in the compul
sories," Hamada said. "My

prediction was 190 to 195 and
we came up with 192.8, so it's
about the same as our average.
Our optional score was 202.55
which again we kind of ex
pected because we have not
been doing any (optional
routines lately.
"Event-by-event, we didn't
dotoo well on floor exercises or
compulsory pommel horse,
but we did pretty well on paral
lel bars and high bar — that's
better than I expected. But
overall I'd say it was average,"
he added.
Although it may be a rela
tively ordinary showing as far
as this year goes, the rapid
growth of the men's gymnas
tics program is evidenced by
the comparison of records and
scores. Last year the Cardinals
finished sixth in the Pacific-8
Conference and totaled 175
points in compulsories. This
season the Cards have a good
shot to finish in the top half of
the Pac-10 and have improved
their compulsory scores by 17
points. Add to those figures
the fact that all but two of the 23
team members will be return
ing and Tad Bostick as a senior
will be the eldest.

And speaking of Bostick, he
placed eighth in all-around for
optionals, and fifth in compul
sories and fifth overall. He led
the field going into the indi
vidual finals for parallel bars
with a 9.025 average, finishing
third with 8.80. In high bar,
Bostick was fifth going into the
finals, again with a 9.025, and
ended up fifth on an 8.80 mark.
Chris Takimoto won the op
tional and compulsory pom
mel horse competition and
lead the finalists with a 9.575
average. In the finals he aver
aged 9.6 to capture first place,
one of only two competitors to
break into the nines.

"Tad showed a lot of prom
ise tonight because he'd
scored nines in a couple of
events before, but this time he
scored nines in vaulting, paral
lel bars and high bar," Hamada
noted. "I think in the Pac-10s
he should be able to score 53
both in compulsories and op
tional, so depending on his
condition, he has a pretty good
chance to finish in the top six in
all-around. And of course
Chris did a good job."
Other top performers for the
Cards included Bob Daniel in
vaulting, Craig Goldman on
rings, Brian Nelsoh on high bar
and Mike Lee in all-around.
