# Lacrosse team falls to UCSB

### Peter Hoberg 
Last season, the Stanford Lacrosse Club lost only one game to a
college team, and that was to the University of California at Santa
Barbara. The Cardinals were out for revenge when the UCSB club
visited Stanford for a rematch this Saturday, but the Cards were
decisively outplayed and lost a very physical battle, 12-6.
Stanford's record is now 2-1 in college play. Last week they beat
Santa Clara 15-5 and the week before they destroyed UC-Davis
19-7 with the help of six goals by sophomore midfielder Kirk
Phelps.
This week the Cardinals failed to bring their offense together,
and neither passing nor shooting were up to par. The Sur ta
Barbara club executed its offense very effectively, especially on
assists from behind the goal.
Stanford attackman Tom Drelles scored twice early in the game
to put Stanford in front 2-1 five minutes into the second quarter,
but UCSB rallied to a 6-3 lead by halftime.
Despite controlling the ball much of the third quarter, Stanford
was unable to gain any ground, until senior Peter Werner scored
two minutes into the fourth quarter to make it 8-6, and the
Cardinals had a good chance to come back. But the UCSB de
fense tightened to hold Stanford scoreless for the rest of the
game, while their offense scored four goals to secure the win.
Other scorers for Stanford were Kirk Phelps, who scored twice,
and Dick Taylor, who added a goal and an assist.
If anyone was more disappointed than Stanford by the day's
results, it was probably the University of Pacific lacrosse team,
who showed up ready to play after the long drive here, only to
find out that they had no opponent. There had been a misun
derstanding in scheduling, and UOP was not supposed to play
Stanford for two weeks.
Next week Stanford hosts the Palo Alto Club at 11 a.m. on
Saturday.
