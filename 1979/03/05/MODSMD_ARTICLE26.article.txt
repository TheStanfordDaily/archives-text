The men's swimming team
accumulated 127 points to
place sixth behind aquatic aces
USC, UCLA, California, ASU
and Arizona but ahead of Ore
gon and Washington in the
Pacific-10 Championships at
Los Angeles last Thursday, Fri
day and Saturday. In a meet
characterized by "rather awe
some times," according to
Coach )im Gaughran, the
Cards did achieve their in
tended goal: to establish per
sonal bests and, principally, to
attain qualifying standards for
the NCAA Championships to
take place in Cleveland later
this month.
Freshman Wade Flemons
plowed to his three fastest
100-yard backstroke perfor
mances in the course of the
meet. He led off the 400-med
ley relay with a 52.44, met the
NCAA prerequisite with a 52.10
in the preliminary heats and
place ninth in the finals with a
52.44. Flemons also lowered
his lifetime-best 200-back time
to 1:52.42.
In the reclining position as
well, John Kingery powered his
way to his best time of 51.1 in
the 100-back to garner third
place laurels and earn a spot in
that event in NCAA competi
tion.
The butterfliers exhibited
new depths of speed. Sam
Franklin broke the 50-second
barrier in the 100-fly trials to
post a 49.58, which makes him
eligibleforaction in Cleveland.
He muscled out a 50.48, sixth
place finish in the finals.
Jeff Stiling slipped under the
NCAA wire with a 1:50.06 in the
200-fly, as did senior Tom O'B

rien with his fifth-place 1:50.00
in that race. O'Brien toiled to
make the qualifying mark in
the 400-individual medley in
4:01.18.
Freshman Joe Jiminez drop
ped an astounding 12 seconds
from his previous best time
coming into the season by
bobbing to a 2:06.11 in the
200-breaststroke. That made
him eligible for the NCAAs.
Distance veteran Paul
Hartloff qualified for the na
tional meet in both the 500-
freestyle (4:27.7) and the 1650-
free (15:20.54).
Gaughran said that five Car
dinals, Monte Brown, Mike
Bruner, Jim Belardi, Bob Hag
berg and Ken Shilling, who had
already equalled qualifying
standards, did not shave down
for this meet and, hence, "did
not place very well."
Freshmen freestylers Mike
Lescyna and Mike Anderson
recorded their best times of
1:43.4 and 1:41.0 respectively
in the 200-free. Lescyna
reached another individual
best with a 48.25 in the 100-
free.
Gaughran classified the
meet as "fast, exciting and
very, very strong." He added
that the USC phenoms fought
back from a near 50-point de
ficit after the first day of com
petition to win the meet.
The Cards now include 11
swimmers who are eligible for
the NCAA Championships and
possibly two more who will
participate in relays. At this
point, relay spots are contin
gent upon swim-off results
from the small Cardinal Invita
tional at deGuerre this coming
weekend.
