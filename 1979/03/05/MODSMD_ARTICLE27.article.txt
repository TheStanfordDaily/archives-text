Los Angeles — Stanford's pil
grimage to the Mecca of col
lege basketball, UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion, resulted in a humbl
ing 99-71 loss Saturday to the
NCAA tournament-bound
Bruins.
The Cardinals, who finish
the season 12-15 overall and
6-12 in Pacific-10 Conference
play, ultimtely succumbed to
the majesty and excellence of
the final regular-season home
appearances of Bruin seniors
Roy Hamilton, Brad Holland
and David Greenwood and the
destructive shooting of junior
Kiki Vandeweghe.
The game held great signifi
cance for UCLA, which had to
win to capture the Pac-10 Con
ference title and avoid a playoff
with USC.
Only Stanford stood bet
ween the Bruins and success.
Thus confronted, UCLA didn't
just push the Cards aside, it
stomped them with an awe
some second-half perfor
mance.
The Cards had climbed to
within five points of the Bruins
by halftime, 45-40, and trailed
by the same margin, 49-44,

shortly after intermission.
However, Greenwood's free
throw with 17:38 remaining in
nocently began a 25-4 UCLA
avalanche lasting over the next
B:lBthatput the Bruins on top,
74-48.
Meanwhile, the only pro
longed streak that Stanford
could sustain was a scoreless
period of 5:42 punctuated by
turnovers and awry shots.
On defense the Cards forced
UCLA to do what they wanted it
to do: take 20-to-25 foot
shots. But Stanford didn't
counton the uncanny accuracy
of Vandeweghe and Holland.
Vandeweghe, the Bruins'
6-foot-8 forward, hit his first
eight shots, all but two of them
baseline jumpers. He finished
with a season-high 22 points,
making 11 of 13 attempts.
Holland's shooting, though
not as efficient as Van
deweghe's (11 -for-19), was
much more spectacular. Most
of Holland's hoops were from
20 feet out or further, causing
Card coach Dick Dißiaso to
say, "He shoots the ball some
where from Guam."
Whenever Vandeweghe and
Holland weren't launching

ground-to-air missiles,
Greenwood would surge in
side for powerful tip-ins or
lay-ups. The third greatest re
bounder and fifth leading
scorer in UCLA history ended
his regular-season exploits
with 28 points on 11-for-15
shooting and 11 rebounds.
"The game was — how
would you say? — a
motivator," said Greenwood.
"It meant a whole lot because
we got beat by Stanford (75-72,
Dec. 27) and struggled with Cal
(UCLA beat the Bears last
Thursday, 79-68)."
The Bruins certainly ap
peared motivated at the start,
jumping to a 15-6 lead with 4:30
gone.
After Dißiaso called time
out, the Cards became the in
spired ones, scoring seven
consecutive points on Kim
berly Belton's short jumper
over Greenwood and Wolfe
Perry's three free throws and
20-foot jumper to cut it to
15-13.
A Vandeweghe bomb with
7:57 to go gave UCLA its
biggest first-half lead, 34-23,
but once again Stanford tem
porarily forestalled its doom.

Belton, agile as a panther
and determined as a salmon
swimming upstream, scored
seven of the Cards' next 15
points that shaved the Bruins'
advantage to4l-38.
Matters were different in the
second half, of course. Dißiaso
cited UCLA's4O-19 rebounding
advantage and 59.4 percent
shooting as the keys to UCLA's
victory.
"This was a great win for us
in a crucial game," said Bruin
coach Gary Cunningham.
The only Card who didn't fall
victim to the Bruins' strong de
fense was Belton, who hit 11 of
15 shots and poured in 23
points. Several times Belton
went over or around Green
wood for impressive inside
buckets.
Senior guards Perry and Paul
Giovacchini suffered the in
dignity of ending their Stan
ford careers with a defeat, but
both said that the realization of
their "retirements" had not yet
struck them.
"One day during spring
quarter I'll be sitting in my
room at about quarter to four,"
Giovacchini mused, "and all of
a sudden I'll ask myself, 'What

am I gonna do with the rest of
my life?' "
DiBiaso, too, will be ponder
ing — wondering how to pro
duce a winning basketball
team at Stanford after another
season with lots of promise
and just as much frustration.

On defense the Cards forced
UCLA to do what they wanted it
to do: take 20-to-25 foot
shots. But Stanford didn't
counton the uncanny accuracy
of Vandeweghe and Holland.
Vandeweghe, the Bruins'
6-foot-8 forward, hit his first
eight shots, all but two of them
baseline jumpers. He finished
with a season-high 22 points,
making 11 of 13 attempts.
Holland's shooting, though
not as efficient as Van
deweghe's (11 -for-19), was
much more spectacular. Most
of Holland's hoops were from
20 feet out or further, causing
Card coach Dick Dißiaso to
say, "He shoots the ball some
where from Guam."
Whenever Vandeweghe and
Holland weren't launching

ground-to-air missiles,
Greenwood would surge in
side for powerful tip-ins or
lay-ups. The third greatest re
bounder and fifth leading
scorer in UCLA history ended
his regular-season exploits
with 28 points on 11-for-15
shooting and 11 rebounds.
"The game was — how
would you say? — a
motivator," said Greenwood.
"It meant a whole lot because
we got beat by Stanford (75-72,
Dec. 27) and struggled with Cal
(UCLA beat the Bears last
Thursday, 79-68)."
The Bruins certainly ap
peared motivated at the start,
jumping to a 15-6 lead with 4:30
gone.
After Dißiaso called time
out, the Cards became the in
spired ones, scoring seven
consecutive points on Kim
berly Belton's short jumper
over Greenwood and Wolfe
Perry's three free throws and
20-foot jumper to cut it to
15-13.
A Vandeweghe bomb with
7:57 to go gave UCLA its
biggest first-half lead, 34-23,
but once again Stanford tem
porarily forestalled its doom.

Belton, agile as a panther
and determined as a salmon
swimming upstream, scored
seven of the Cards' next 15
points that shaved the Bruins'
advantage to4l-38.
Matters were different in the
second half, of course. Dißiaso
cited UCLA's4O-19 rebounding
advantage and 59.4 percent
shooting as the keys to UCLA's
victory.
"This was a great win for us
in a crucial game," said Bruin
coach Gary Cunningham.
The only Card who didn't fall
victim to the Bruins' strong de
fense was Belton, who hit 11 of
15 shots and poured in 23
points. Several times Belton
went over or around Green
wood for impressive inside
buckets.
Senior guards Perry and Paul
Giovacchini suffered the in
dignity of ending their Stan
ford careers with a defeat, but
both said that the realization of
their "retirements" had not yet
struck them.
"One day during spring
quarter I'll be sitting in my
room at about quarter to four,"
Giovacchini mused, "and all of
a sudden I'll ask myself, 'What

am I gonna do with the rest of
my life?' "
DiBiaso, too, will be ponder
ing — wondering how to pro
duce a winning basketball
team at Stanford after another
season with lots of promise
and just as much frustration.

Los Angeles — Stanford's pil

The game held great signifi

avalanche lasting over the next

jumping to a 15-6 lead with 4:30
gone.
After Dißiaso called time
out, the Cards became the in
spired ones, scoring seven
consecutive points on Kim
berly Belton's short jumper
over Greenwood and Wolfe
Perry's three free throws and
20-foot jumper to cut it to
15-13.
A Vandeweghe bomb with
7:57 to go gave UCLA its
biggest first-half lead, 34-23,
but once again Stanford tem
porarily forestalled its doom.

Belton, agile as a panther
and determined as a salmon
swimming upstream, scored
seven of the Cards' next 15
points that shaved the Bruins'
advantage to4l-38.
Matters were different in the
second half, of course. Dißiaso
cited UCLA's4O-19 rebounding
advantage and 59.4 percent
shooting as the keys to UCLA's
victory.
"This was a great win for us
in a crucial game," said Bruin
coach Gary Cunningham.
The only Card who didn't fall
victim to the Bruins' strong de
fense was Belton, who hit 11 of
15 shots and poured in 23
points. Several times Belton
went over or around Green
wood for impressive inside
buckets.
Senior guards Perry and Paul
Giovacchini suffered the in
dignity of ending their Stan
ford careers with a defeat, but
both said that the realization of
their "retirements" had not yet
struck them.
"One day during spring
quarter I'll be sitting in my
room at about quarter to four,"
Giovacchini mused, "and all of
a sudden I'll ask myself, 'What

am I gonna do with the rest of
my life?' "
DiBiaso, too, will be ponder
ing — wondering how to pro
duce a winning basketball
team at Stanford after another
season with lots of promise
and just as much frustration.

RISING OVER Southern California center Doug Widtfeldt, Stanford's
Orlando Ward (42) attempts a jump shot in last Thursday's 79-68 loss
to the Trojans at Los Angeles. USC guard Don Carfino (24) watches.
Ward, a freshman forward, scoreda career-high 16 points in that
game, and returned to tally six points Saturday against UCLA.
