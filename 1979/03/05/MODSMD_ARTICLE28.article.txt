# Spikers lose hard-fought battles

The only thing that matters in
athletics is winning. There is no
such thing as a "good loss."
Right? Wrong.
The Stanford men's vol
leyball team traveled south
this weekend to take on two of
collegiate volleyball's most
powerful squads, Pepperdine
and Loyola Marymount. Even
though Stanford bowed to de
feat in both matches, coach
Fred Sturm's Cards came
dangerously close to upsetting
highly regarded Pepperdine
and dropped a heartbreaking
five-game loss with Loyola,
"one we should have won,"
according to assistant coach
John Bekins.
On Friday night the Cards
battled with Pepperdine's
Waves in Malibu, but came
up on the short end of a 15-8,
15-8, 7-15,15-13 score.
Rated as one of the top teams
in the country in Volleyball
Magazine's annual pre-season
poll, the Waves nearly became
Stanford's first California In
tercollegiate Volleyball Associ
ation victim of the season.
Pepperdine easily won the
first two games and appeared
to be en route to a sweep, but
the tenacious Cards were not
about to give up. In what Be
kins called "a convincing win,"
Stanford came out swinging in
game three to crush the sur
prised Waves 15-7.
The momentum stayed with
Stanford in the fourth game
and the fiery Cards roared out
to seemingly insurmountable
leads of 8-1 and 13-7.
"It was encouraging to see
us really beating a team of that
caliber," said Bekins. "But we
just couldn't put them away."
Boasting the entire starting
lineup from last year's NCAA
championship team, coach
Kirk Kilgore's Waves surged
back to win eight consecutive
points to clinch the win.
Saturday night Stanford
came even closer to its first
league win, but late-match
heroics pulled the match out of
the fire for Loyola 11-15,10-15,
15-12,15-8, and 15-12.
"It's hard to say what hap
pened," said Bekins, referring
to Stanford's two-game lead.
"We made some substitutions
and just lost momentum."
Despite the pair of losses,
Bekins was pleased with the

play of several Cardinals. Cory
"Downtown" Brown came off
the bench to give what Bekins
called "a really good effort."
Bekins further praised the

setting of freshman Kip Engen.
"Kip's set selection was excel
lent," he said. "He was putting
the ball in good locations and
read the block well."

The pair of losses drops Stan
ford's season record to 2-7, and
the Cards will resume play here
Friday when they host rival
California.

Feb. 24. This past weekend Stanford was considerably more competitive, but still failed to win, losing to
Pepperdine in four games and Loyola-Marymount in five.
