### 
The Cardinal women's bas
ketball team has been invited
to participate in the regional
tournament to be held Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday,
March 8-10, at the University of
California at Santa Barbara.
The other participating
teams, listed in order of their
seedings, are University of
Nevada at Las Vegas, UCLA,
San Jose State University, Cal
Poly-Pomona, Long Beach
State University, USC, and San
Francisco State University.
According to coach Dotty
McCrea, Stanford and San
Francisco State were tied for
the sixth seed position, but
Stanford was seeded lower
after a drawing to determine
who would take the sixth place
spot was held.
McCrea equated the region
al to the first round of the
NCAA tournament. She said
that the first two teams will go
into the first round of nation
als, so "it's sort of a qualifying
round."
McCrea said she thought
that Stanford was selected to
attend the tournament "be
cause basically we have a good
overall record and we've
beaten the southern California
schools." She also said that

"our conference perfor
mances this year had been
good."
McCrea said she thinks that
the experience of playing in
the tournament will be very
good for the women on the
team.
"It will be a great learning
experience for them to see the
top eight teams in California,"
she said. "We have a young

team and I think this will be
very beneficial for them. The
girls are very excited about it, I
think."
Speculating on the outcome
of the regional tournament,
McCrea said, "If we play well
we can give UCLA a really good
game.
"I think we can play well,"
she said. "I think we have to
play well."
