# Jailed writer needs help, Buchwald says
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Appealing for aid to international prisoners of
conscience, syndicated columnist Art Buchwald
told a group of about Stanford professional jour
nalism fellows at Redwood Hall Friday, "I get large
sums of money to do what others (journalists) get
thrown in jail for."
Buchwald is seeking the release of Jiri Lederer, a
56-year-old Czechoslovakian journalist serving a
three-year jail sentence which began in October.
Lederer was arrested in January 1977 after signing
the Charter 77 Manifesto, a document affirming
the tenents of the Helsinki human rights accords.
Lederer is reportedly in poor health as a result of
the harassment and pressure to which he and his
family have been subjected.
"He is sick. He needs as much helpas possible,"
Buchwald said. Telegrams and airmail letters writ
ten to the appropriate authorities can be effective,
according to Buchwald.
Buchwald praised the recent pledge by 2400
American scientists to curtail scientific coopera
tion with the Soviet Union until persecution of
Soviet scientists ends. Buchwald called the peti
tion "a fantastic thing. What the scientists have
done will have a tremendous effect," he said.
Pleas for change
Noting that political repression is on the rise
around the world, Buchwald stressed the impor
tance of individual and collective pleas forchange.
He then joked, "If we could ever get the Teamster
Union behind (the Amnesty International move
ment) we could really be successful."
Buchwald went on to discuss his 30 years as a
syndicated columnist. "I probably have the best
job in journalism," he said, explaining that be
cause his column is published in 500 newspapers

around the world, "if one editor gets mad, I still
have 499 others."
Buchwald said newspapers in the Soviet Union
print his column "once or twice a week" since he
often satirizes American politics. However, when
he asked Soviet officials whether they would pub
lish columns poking fun at the Soviet Union he
said he was told "we don't have space."
After three years at USC and four years in the
U.S. Marines, Buchwald worked for The Herald
Tribune, in Paris from 1949 until 1962. "The mo
ment I announced I was coming back to
Washington, (President John) Kennedy cancelled
his subscription to The Herald Tribune," he said
with amusement.
Short supply
Humor writers are in short supply these days,
and "most editors are nervous" about them, ac
cording to Buchwald. He said he wants to keep it
that way. "We don't want competition — we want
to be like the oil companies," he explained faceti
ously.
Buchwald said most of the material for his col
umns comes from straightforward news reports he
finds while reading newspapers and news
magazines and watching television news. He said
he rarely consults official sources in Washington
because "facts get in my way."
Buchwald's knack for pointing out the absurdity
in straightforward news led Henry Kissinger to tell
him during a press conference, "Buchwald, stop
taking notes, you'll make me look like a fool."
'Political cartoon in words'
Buchwald describes his column as a "political
cartoon in words." He said he alternates between
political and non-political subjects, however.
"The only way to survive (as a columnist) is not to

be predictable," he added.
Buchwald k id he feels "uncomfortable" writing
on certain issues.
He chose not to write about the Jonestown mas
sacre. Buchwald said he tries to avoid the morbid
in his columns. "I'm not a black humorist," he
explained.
Abortion is another issue he is hesitant to write
about although he said it is "rather frightening "
that the largest demonstrations outside the White
House recently have been the anti-abortionists. "I
guess I'm a coward on that issue," he said.
Controversial column
Despite Buchwald's penchant for political satire
he said his most recent controversial column was
on Ohio State University football coach Woody
Hayes. Hayes was fired after punching a Clemson
player who had just intercepted an Ohio State
pass.
"I said Hayes was teaching the kid a lesson —
preventing the theft of a football," explained
Buchwald. He said he received 80 letters from
people who took the column seriously. "Someone
even quoted me the NCAA rulebook," he said.
Buchwald's favorite column was political in
tone. However, the column asserted that "J. Edgar
Hoover couldn't be fired because he didn't exist,
but was invented by Reader's Digest." Letters and
phone calls poured in from people who believed
the story, he said. "A lady came up to me in Miami
and said, 'Where did you get your information?' 'I
made it up,' I replied. 'I know,' she said, 'but
where did you get it?' "
What would Buchwald's "state of the world
message" be like? "The whole world is going
slightly mad and I'm just here reporting it,"he
said.
