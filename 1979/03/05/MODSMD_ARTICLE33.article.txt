# Booters outpace Berkeley with shining defense, 3-1
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Against Humboldt State last
week, Stanford's offense had a
literal field day, running away
9-0 in the opening match of the
Nor-Cal soccer season.
Saturday, it was the defense
that shined far brighter than the
sun on the overcast afternoon.
Although outpacing Berkeley
3-1, the match was a 0-0 dead
lock until 11 minutes into the
second half when Ellen Criep
rippled the net with a penalty
kick.
The Cardinal defense's abil
ity to shut down the Golden
Bear attack gave the offense
valuable time to exploit Cal's
weaknesses. The effectiveness
of the midfield and fullbacks
shows in the statistics — in a
game where two goals proved
to be the margin of victory,
Stanford goalie Lynn McComb
recorded seven saves, while
her counterpart had to con
tend with 15, most of those
coming in the second period of
Play-
Berkeley tied the match at a

goal apiece on a shot by Mary
lyn Neufville 20 minutes into
the second half, the only fatal
miscue by the Card defense.
Kathy Kelley put Stanford
ahead for good on a goal with
10 minutes remaining in the
game, Criep and Cindy Shor
ney providing the double as
sist. The defensive spirit
spread to the forward line, be
coming most visible with five
minutes left, as Lisa Steinkamp
pressured a Cal fullback into
making a bad pass to the
goalie, the result being the
third goal for Stanford.
"We should have scored a
lot sooner — in the first half I
think," Kelley explained. "Our
defense played an outrageous
game, really superb. Pauline
(McNamara) destroyed their
centerforward (Neufville)."
"Pauline just really ate her
up, took her completely out of
the game," coach Phil Wright
concurred. Our outside
fullbacks covered well — they
played that diagonal defense
beautifully. I felt fairly safe with

our defense despite how good
Berkeley's offense is.
"Our halfbacks — Cindy,
Nancy (Geiss), Kathy and Ron
nie (Vella) — really did a good
job winning the ball. Pushing
the ball to the offense gave the
offensive line a lot more op
portunities," he added.
Wright credited his fullbacks
with aggressive play that
helped to free the halfbacks
and initiate a feeling of confi
dence which spread through
out the ranks.
"Our team play was what did
it," Wright observed." Ber-?
keley made it sd our individu*
als couldn't be stars. Ellen and
Cindy couldn't dominate the
whole game because they were
being marked and Maria
(Duryea) wasn't as free to dis
tribute the ball because there
was pressure in the middle." '
The burden then fell on the
outside players, and they came
through to penetrate the Call
defense and open up the game
in the second half.
