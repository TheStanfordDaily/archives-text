China reportedly to withdraw
Bangkok, Thailand — China reportedly told foreign
diplomats yesterday it will withdraw from Vietnam as
soon as possible, but Hanoi said Chinese troops had
launched new attacked and "fierce battles" were raging
near the captured Vietnamese town of Lang Son.
A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tokyo said
Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua told Japanese Am
bassador Shoji Sato in Peking that the withdrawals
would take place but did not say when.
Japan's Kyodo news service quoted Chinese Vice
Premier Li Xiannian (Li Hsien-nien) as saying, "We have
already decided to withdraw from Vietnam. Our pur
pose has been almost achieved." He did not elaborate.
Chinese sources in Peking said some Chinese troops
had already ceased fire and were returning to China,
Kyodo reported.
But Vietnam gave no indication of a stand-down. The
country's Communist Party Central Committee declared
yesterday that "every village in Vietnam should be a
defense post, every providence a strong wall" against
the Chinese.
France's president under attack
Paris — President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, once con
sidered a virtual shoo-in for re-election in 1981, is com
ing under increasingly sharp attack as France plunges
deeper into labor unrest, unemployment and energy
worries.
While Ciscard d'Estaing visited Mexico last week, his
leftist opponents joined forces with conservative Gaul
lists in his own center-right coalition to demand a special
National Assembly session to deal with growing violence
in France's six-month-old steel crisis.
Organized labor is fighting the government's plan to
modernize the ailing French steel industry because it
will mean the layoff of an estimated 35,000 workers in the
next two years.
According to a poll published Saturday in the weekly
magazine of the newspaper Le Figaro, the 53-year-old
Giscard d'Estaing now commands the confidence of
only 51 percent of his countrymen, a drop of six points in
a month and 11 points since Jan. 1.
OPEC sets conditions for oil sales
Abu Dhabi, United Arab Amirates — The head of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
said yesterday that future oil sales to consumer nations
should depend on whether they help bring about a
Mideast settlement favorable to the Palestinians.
Mana Saeed al-Otaiba, current president of OPEC,
brandished the Arab "oil weapon" in another way as
well, threatening a "blacklisting" of foreign oil com
panies that have raised prices sharply because of market
disruptions caused by the Iranian oil shutdown.
Meanwhile, the OPEC countries' own price boosts
continued. Libya announced it is raising its prices an
additional 3 percent, on top of a 5 percent hike imposed
just two weeks ago.
"Countries that expect us to maintain our supplies of
petroleum should help us to arrive at a rightful solution
to the Palestine situation," Otaiba told the opening ses
sion of an Arab Energy Conference here.

Iran cuts relations with S. Africa
Tehran, Iran — Iran's revolutionary gvoernment se
vered diplomatic relations with South Africa yesterday
because of its racial policies and confirmed it will cut off
the white minority-ruled country's vital Iranian oil
supplies.
In another step toward restoring Islamic traditions in
Iran, the government also announced that women will
no longer be drafted into the Iranian armed forces for
military training.
The state radio said South Africa's consul-general was
summoned to the Foreign Ministry and informed of the
decision to end government-to-government ties bet
ween the two countries. The diplomat will leave Iran
today, the report said.
Before revolution cut off Iranian oil exports to the
world, South Africa received an estimated 90 percent of
its petroleum from the government of Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi, who ignored international pressure to ban
oil sales as a protest against South Africa's apartheid
policies.
Support for Taiwan increases on Hill
Washington — Opponents of President Jimmy Carter's
China policy are mounting efforts to win Senate and
House approval this week of stronger U.S. defense and
diplomatic ties with Taiwan than the president corn
templates.
The Senate is to start work tomorrow and the House
Thursday on bills that would declare any forceful Peking
takeover of Taiwan a threat to peace in the Pacific and
"of grave concern to the United States."
Opponents of Carter's policy in both chambers have
amendments raising the threat U.S. military assistance
for Taiwan if Peking tries to take it over.
They also will try to win a government-level U.S.
liaison office for Taiwan, which is opposed by both Car
ter and Peking.
Voyager gives new view of Jupiter
Pasadena, Calif. — Voyager 1, which has already de
lighted and startled scientists with undreamed-of details
of Jupiter, was unveiling new secrets yesterday as it
raced to its historic encounter with the mysterious
planet.
The unmanned spacecraft, launched in September
1977, passes within 173,000 miles of Jupiter's colorffcl,
churning clouds early today.
Excited scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory say
the ship's high-resolution cameras will let them see fea
tures as small as five miles across in the dense clouds
that make up Jupiter's visible surface.
Then the Voyager, flying about 81,000 miles an hour,
will examine three of Jupiter's curious moons before
starting a 20-month cruise to distant Saturn as the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
mission continues. A sistership, Voyager 2, has a similar
itinerary. It's due at Jupitar in July and at Saturn in 1981.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except for patchy low clouds
night and morning hours. Lows in upper 40s to low 50s.
Highs in 60s to mid 70s. Variable winds to 15 mph.

Voyager gives new view of Jupiter
Pasadena, Calif. — Voyager 1, which has already de
lighted and startled scientists with undreamed-of details
of Jupiter, was unveiling new secrets yesterday as it
raced to its historic encounter with the mysterious
planet.
The unmanned spacecraft, launched in September
1977, passes within 173,000 miles of Jupiter's colorffcl,
churning clouds early today.
Excited scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory say
the ship's high-resolution cameras will let them see fea
tures as small as five miles across in the dense clouds
that make up Jupiter's visible surface.
Then the Voyager, flying about 81,000 miles an hour,
will examine three of Jupiter's curious moons before
starting a 20-month cruise to distant Saturn as the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
mission continues. A sistership, Voyager 2, has a similar
itinerary. It's due at Jupitar in July and at Saturn in 1981.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except for patchy low clouds
night and morning hours. Lows in upper 40s to low 50s.
Highs in 60s to mid 70s. Variable winds to 15 mph.
China reportedly to withdraw
Bangkok, Thailand — China reportedly told foreign
diplomats yesterday it will withdraw from Vietnam as
soon as possible, but Hanoi said Chinese troops had
launched new attacked and "fierce battles" were raging
near the captured Vietnamese town of Lang Son.
A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tokyo said
Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua told Japanese Am
bassador Shoji Sato in Peking that the withdrawals
would take place but did not say when.
Japan's Kyodo news service quoted Chinese Vice
Premier Li Xiannian (Li Hsien-nien) as saying, "We have
already decided to withdraw from Vietnam. Our pur
pose has been almost achieved." He did not elaborate.
Chinese sources in Peking said some Chinese troops
had already ceased fire and were returning to China,
Kyodo reported.
But Vietnam gave no indication of a stand-down. The
country's Communist Party Central Committee declared
yesterday that "every village in Vietnam should be a
defense post, every providence a strong wall" against
the Chinese.
France's president under attack
Paris — President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, once con
sidered a virtual shoo-in for re-election in 1981, is com
ing under increasingly sharp attack as France plunges
deeper into labor unrest, unemployment and energy
worries.
While Ciscard d'Estaing visited Mexico last week, his
leftist opponents joined forces with conservative Gaul
lists in his own center-right coalition to demand a special
National Assembly session to deal with growing violence
in France's six-month-old steel crisis.
Organized labor is fighting the government's plan to
modernize the ailing French steel industry because it
will mean the layoff of an estimated 35,000 workers in the
next two years.
According to a poll published Saturday in the weekly
magazine of the newspaper Le Figaro, the 53-year-old
Giscard d'Estaing now commands the confidence of
only 51 percent of his countrymen, a drop of six points in
a month and 11 points since Jan. 1.
OPEC sets conditions for oil sales
Abu Dhabi, United Arab Amirates — The head of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
said yesterday that future oil sales to consumer nations
should depend on whether they help bring about a
Mideast settlement favorable to the Palestinians.
Mana Saeed al-Otaiba, current president of OPEC,
brandished the Arab "oil weapon" in another way as
well, threatening a "blacklisting" of foreign oil com
panies that have raised prices sharply because of market
disruptions caused by the Iranian oil shutdown.
Meanwhile, the OPEC countries' own price boosts
continued. Libya announced it is raising its prices an
additional 3 percent, on top of a 5 percent hike imposed
just two weeks ago.
"Countries that expect us to maintain our supplies of
petroleum should help us to arrive at a rightful solution
to the Palestine situation," Otaiba told the opening ses
sion of an Arab Energy Conference here.

the white minority-ruled country's vital Iranian oil
supplies.

Iran, the government also announced that women will
no longer be drafted into the Iranian armed forces for
military training.
The state radio said South Africa's consul-general was
summoned to the Foreign Ministry and informed of the
decision to end government-to-government ties bet
ween the two countries. The diplomat will leave Iran
today, the report said.

oil sales as a protest against South Africa's apartheid
policies.
