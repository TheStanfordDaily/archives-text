Members of the University com
munity have been invited to fill five
spaces in a two week tour of the
People's Republic of China.
The tour will be led by Daniel
Shanahan, adjunct professor of
American Literature at the Monterey
Institute of Foreign Studies and an
instructor in the Freshman Seminar
program here.
Shanahan said the tour group,"
which will leave on July 16, will con
sist of 15 students and their families
from the Santa Catalina School in
Monterey in addition to the five
people from Stanford.

Shanahan added that he will not
know where his tour group will be
staying until they arrive, but "there is
a tendency to put Americans in first
class hotels."
Shanahan said the group will fly to
Flong Kong and then visit the four
major cities of Canton, Peking,
Shanghai and Hangchow, traveling
by train and plane.
The tour will include a visit to the
Great Wall and other tourist sites,
but Shanahan said he hopes to ar
range a visit to a Chinese university
and have the opportunity to talk with
students who are learning to speak
English.
