Quad paper fire
A fire, of "undetermined origin,"
destroyed papers on a kiosk near the
French-Italian corner of the Quad
Saturday night, according to a Dept.
of Public Safety officer.
The fire "burnt itself out" shortly
after it started, though there was
some danger that trees nearby might
catch fire, an officer said. Matches
were found at the bottom of the
kiosk.
The Santa Clara County Fire Mar
shall's Office is investigating the
blaze.
Lake drowning
Robert William Bradford, 22, of
Palo Alto, drowned early Saturday
morning after he and two others cap
sized a canoe in the middle of
Searsville Lake Friday night.
San Mateo County sheriff's skin
divers, a helicopter and numerous
deputies searched the lake and
nearby surroundings before finding
the body at 12:25 a.m.
Bradford was described as a poor
swimmer. After the canoe over
turned at about midnight, Bradford
hollered to his friends, "I'm not
going to make it ashore ... I'm not
doing too well." The companions
were unable to find the victim, but
swam safely to shore, Lt. Jerry
Moerman said.
The lake, on University property,
used to be a popular recreational and
fishing spot, but recently was closed
to the public for use by students
studying its natural environment.

followed by the old spellings in
parentheses for a few weeks until the
new spellings become familiar.
