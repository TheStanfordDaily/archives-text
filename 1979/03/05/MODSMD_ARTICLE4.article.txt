# Carter offers Begin new Mideast peace proposals
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” President
Jimmy Carter, in a fresh effort to sal
vage Mideast peace prospects, gave
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin new proposals yesterday.
The proposals were described by
an Israeli official as "important and
interesting." The contents were kept
secret, but Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.)
told reporters after a meeting with
the president that the proposals
were in the nature of "pragmatic
guarantees" designed to build trust
between Egypt and Israel.
"It may be the cement that binds
this treaty," Javits said. He refused to
provide further details.
Response this week
Begin referred the proposals to his
government in Jerusalem and told
Carter he hoped to have a response
before he leaves the United States
this week.
Meanwhile, a White House state
ment said Carter would review the
situation with Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat. Sen. Charles Percy (R
-III.) said the two leaders were al
ready in touch.
"I think he's gone the last mile,"
Percy said of Carter's intensive effort
to guide Egypt and Israel to comple
tion of the elusive treaty.
The White House statement, still
not providing specific details,
termed the proposals "suggestions
designed to help resolve some of the
outstanding differences between
Egypt and Israel."
it was the first positive develop
ment since Begin arrived here
Thursday. At the time, Begin de
scribed the negotiations as in deep
crisis.

"The proposals are important be
cause, in our estimation, they are dif
ferent from previous proposals,"
said an Israeli official, who asked not
to be identified.
Begin had been expected to go to
New York this evening, and it was not
clear whether the developments
would cause a change in his plans.
Before yesterday's meeting with
Begin, Carter had indicated a failure
to break the impasse in negotiations.
'Sham document'
Begin, meanwhile, vowed, again
that Israel would not sign "a sham
document."
"I do not adopt the theory of 'now
or never,' " Begin said on a nation
ally televised interview program.
"We shall have to negotiate again,

and I don't see any tragedy in it."
Ultimately, he said, there would be
peace in the Middle East.
Begin made his comments on the
ABC television program "Issues and
Answers."
Carter volunteered a bleak as
sessment in a Bible class at the First
Baptist Church, several blocks north
of the White House.
"We did not make any progress,"
he said flatly and without elabora
tion.
In Cairo, U.S. Ambassador Her
mann Eilts gave Sadat a report of the
negotiations in a one-hour meeting
yesterday. Sadat said Egypt would
make a decision on Carter's message
today and"I shall be in a position to
tell you lots then."
