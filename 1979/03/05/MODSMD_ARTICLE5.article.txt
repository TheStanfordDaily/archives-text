# Student loan default declines 2 percent
## 
### Fran Miller 
The percentage of students de
linquent on the repayment of loans
made through the University has
dropped over the past two years, due
to "greater efforts in collecting" and
a "more businesslike attitude"
adopted by the Financial Aids Office
and the Student Accounts Office, ac
cording to Kenneth Kaufman, assis
tant director of Financial Aid.
The student loan delinquency rate
has dropped from 7.7 percent in 1976
to 5.4 percent in mid-1978.
The major concern about a high
delinquency rate was that "there
would not be enough money for de
mands, and students here would suf
fer," said Timothy Warner, assistant
in the Provost's office.
A low delinquency rate is "crucial
to the success of the financial aid
program," he said. Kaufman said he
was pleased with the current 5.4 per
cent figure.
Study of causes
Kaufman and Warner conducted a
study of the causes of the earlier rise
in delinquency here. Although the
national average delinquency rate
has been estimated at 17.7 percent
among U.S. colleges and universities
Kaufman said "we were middling
among America's best schools, and
that bothered us."
Warner explained that although
there are several loan programs at
the University, the National Direct
Student Loan (NDSL) program,
which accounts for roughly half the
student loans here, constitutes "90
percent of our headache."
Under the NDSL program, the
government contributes 90 percent
of the funds annually, with the Uni
versity adding 10 percent.
These capital contributions and
university funds, combined with
money from students repaying their
loans, are lent out to students each
year. Including the money from re
paid loans, $2.4 million was lent last
year through NDSL.
Loan process reviewed
Research by Kaufman and Warner
entailed reviewing "everything in
volved in the loan program from the
time the student walks in the door to

when he makes his last payment,"
according to Warner. He said that
after traveling around the country
looking at numerous banks and
academic institutions, he found that
"we did some things better."
In making recommendations for
the program here, Warner said "we
tried to pull out the good things"
from other places. Kaufman com
mented that they found that the
"best models are in banks."
After tabulating statistics on 4000
borrowers here, researchers disco
vered that personal characteristics
often correlated to the loan repay
ment rate. For example, it was found
that students who had better
academic records tended to make
timely payments on their loans more
often than those who didn't.
Credit
As a result of the study, Financial
Aid officials introduced credit as an
important element in the loan pro
cess. Kaufman hypothesized that
one of the reasons for the rise in de
linquency was due to "the automatic
way in which loans reached the
hands of students."
Warner added that he believed the
recent decrease in the delinquency
rate is due, in part, to the "changed
direction of how the University and
students look at loans." Students are
being taught the significance of cre
dit and how to build a solid credit
history. Students with questionable
records are being screened carefully.
Kaufman stated that plans are
being made whereby good and bad
borrowers will be reported to credit
agencies. The theory behind this is
that students with good credit his
tories will be recognized.
According to Kaufman, with re
spect to graduate students, closer at
tention is being paid to students' vo
cational plans, with borrowing being
tailored to students' estimated future
earnings.
Kaufman explained that the au
thorization of loans is handled by the
Financial Aids Office, not the Office
of Student Accounts which actually
disperses and collects funds.

loans, are lent out to students each
year. Including the money from re
paid loans, $2.4 million was lent last
year through NDSL.
Loan process reviewed
Research by Kaufman and Warner
entailed reviewing "everything in
volved in the loan program from the
time the student walks in the door to

when he makes his last payment,"
according to Warner. He said that
after traveling around the country
looking at numerous banks and
academic institutions, he found that
"we did some things better."
In making recommendations for
the program here, Warner said "we
tried to pull out the good things"
from other places. Kaufman com
mented that they found that the
"best models are in banks."
After tabulating statistics on 4000
borrowers here, researchers disco
vered that personal characteristics
often correlated to the loan repay
ment rate. For example, it was found
that students who had better
academic records tended to make
timely payments on their loans more
often than those who didn't.
Credit
As a result of the study, Financial
Aid officials introduced credit as an
important element in the loan pro
cess. Kaufman hypothesized that
one of the reasons for the rise in de
linquency was due to "the automatic
way in which loans reached the
hands of students."
Warner added that he believed the
recent decrease in the delinquency
rate is due, in part, to the "changed
direction of how the University and
students look at loans." Students are
being taught the significance of cre
dit and how to build a solid credit
history. Students with questionable
records are being screened carefully.
Kaufman stated that plans are
being made whereby good and bad
borrowers will be reported to credit
agencies. The theory behind this is
that students with good credit his
tories will be recognized.
According to Kaufman, with re
spect to graduate students, closer at
tention is being paid to students' vo
cational plans, with borrowing being
tailored to students' estimated future
earnings.
Kaufman explained that the au
thorization of loans is handled by the
Financial Aids Office, not the Office
of Student Accounts which actually
disperses and collects funds.
