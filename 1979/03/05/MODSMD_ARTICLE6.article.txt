# Brightman charges HEW with forced sterilization
## Government sterilization program wiping out Native Americans 
### Susan Essoyan 
The federal government is con
tinuing "400 years of physical, cul
tural and psychological genocide" by
sterilizing thousands of Native
American women each year, United
Native Americans President Lee
Brightman told a group of 40 in
Kresge Auditorium Thursday night.
Brightman spoke for an hour on
sterilization of Native Americans.
Four other speakers followed him,
advocating a political coalition of
minorities.
The government "has quit killing
Indians with guns," but if the alleged
sterilization program keeps up,
"we'll soon reach a time where there
will be no more Indians," Brightman
said.
He cited a report made by U.S.
Sen. James Abourezk (D-S.D.) which
states that 3406 Native American
women and 142 men in four states
were sterilized between 1973 and
1976.
Brightman estimated that between
45,000 and 50,000 Native American
women have been sterilized over the
past decade through the Indian
Health Service (IHS), a branch of the
Department of Health, Education

and Welfare (HEW).
HEW regulations for federally fi
nanced sterilizations prohibit coer
cion and require informed consent
of women, but 70 percent of the
teaching hospitals in this country ig
nore these regulations, Brightman
said. Most sterilizations of minorities
and the poor take place without wo
men's informed consent, according
to Brightman.
Brightman said the IHS has tried to
justify forced sterilizations on medi
cal grounds, maintaining that they
are carried out on women beyond
their child-bearing years or those
with cancer.
But most sterilizations are un
necessary, according to Brightman.
The government is trying to make its
job easier by reducing the number of
Native Americans, he said.
Consent
Women are often asked to sign
consent forms for sterilization opera
tions while in labor or under seda
tion, Brightman said. He said he
knew of cases in which teenagers
were sterilized without their know
ledge while having their appendices
out.
Brightman reacted strongly when

he thought he saw someone giggling
in the audience. "It's no fucking
laughing matter. . . . It's the same as
cutting your goddam balls off!" he
shouted.
If whites were sterilized on such a
scale there would be a general out
pouring of lawsuits, but "Indians
don't have the money or know-how
to bring suit," Brightman said.
'Wiping out our race'
In any case, such sterilization
would not be as alarming, according
to Brightman, because other white
women would continue to repro
duce. But since Native Americans
make up less than half of one percent
of the U.S. population, sterilization
is "wiping out our race completely,"
Brightman said.
He said that he and several others
plan to file a $300 million federal law
suit for damages resulting from
forced sterilization. Brightman
charged that IHS Director Emory
Johnson used Native American chil
dren in medical experiments without
their consent, in addition to the
sterilizations.
Brightman said that Johnson
should be tried for murder. He said
that he wrote a letter to President

Jimmy Carter requesting that
Johnson be fired.
Carter has not responded, how
ever. Carter also refused to meet
with Native American leaders last
year after they walked from Sac
ramento to Washington, D.C. "The
Longest Walk" was staged to call at
tention to difficulties Native Ameri
cans face. Brightman said he re
sented the fact that the president did
find time to meet with Miss Teenage
America the same week that the Na
tive American group was in
Washington.
"Sometimes it seems the whole
damn world's against us and when
you come right down to it, they are,"
Brightman said. Native Americans
must stick together, he said.
"Be proud you're Indian," he told
the predominantly Native American
audience. "We're never going to
take back the country, but at least we
can keep our land and culture," he
said.
Brightman stressed contributions
Native Americans have made to
world civilization ranging from the
cultivation of the potato to
medicines.

said.
He cited a report made by U.S.
Sen. James Abourezk (D-S.D.) which
states that 3406 Native American
women and 142 men in four states
were sterilized between 1973 and
1976.
Brightman estimated that between
45,000 and 50,000 Native American
women have been sterilized over the
past decade through the Indian
Health Service (IHS), a branch of the
Department of Health, Education

and Welfare (HEW).
HEW regulations for federally fi
nanced sterilizations prohibit coer
cion and require informed consent
of women, but 70 percent of the
teaching hospitals in this country ig
nore these regulations, Brightman
said. Most sterilizations of minorities
and the poor take place without wo
men's informed consent, according
to Brightman.
Brightman said the IHS has tried to
justify forced sterilizations on medi
cal grounds, maintaining that they
are carried out on women beyond
their child-bearing years or those
with cancer.
But most sterilizations are un
necessary, according to Brightman.
The government is trying to make its
job easier by reducing the number of
Native Americans, he said.
Consent
Women are often asked to sign
consent forms for sterilization opera
tions while in labor or under seda
tion, Brightman said. He said he
knew of cases in which teenagers
were sterilized without their know
ledge while having their appendices
out.
Brightman reacted strongly when

he thought he saw someone giggling
in the audience. "It's no fucking
laughing matter. . . . It's the same as
cutting your goddam balls off!" he
shouted.
If whites were sterilized on such a
scale there would be a general out
pouring of lawsuits, but "Indians
don't have the money or know-how
to bring suit," Brightman said.
'Wiping out our race'
In any case, such sterilization
would not be as alarming, according
to Brightman, because other white
women would continue to repro
duce. But since Native Americans
make up less than half of one percent
of the U.S. population, sterilization
is "wiping out our race completely,"
Brightman said.
He said that he and several others
plan to file a $300 million federal law
suit for damages resulting from
forced sterilization. Brightman
charged that IHS Director Emory
Johnson used Native American chil
dren in medical experiments without
their consent, in addition to the
sterilizations.
Brightman said that Johnson
should be tried for murder. He said
that he wrote a letter to President

Jimmy Carter requesting that
Johnson be fired.
Carter has not responded, how
ever. Carter also refused to meet
with Native American leaders last
year after they walked from Sac
ramento to Washington, D.C. "The
Longest Walk" was staged to call at
tention to difficulties Native Ameri
cans face. Brightman said he re
sented the fact that the president did
find time to meet with Miss Teenage
America the same week that the Na
tive American group was in
Washington.
"Sometimes it seems the whole
damn world's against us and when
you come right down to it, they are,"
Brightman said. Native Americans
must stick together, he said.
"Be proud you're Indian," he told
the predominantly Native American
audience. "We're never going to
take back the country, but at least we
can keep our land and culture," he
said.
Brightman stressed contributions
Native Americans have made to
world civilization ranging from the
cultivation of the potato to
medicines.

United Native Americans President Lee Brightman denounced federally financed
sterilization of Native Americans in a talk given Thursday in Kresge Auditorium.
About 40 persons showed up to hear Brightman and others speak.
The federal government is con
tinuing "400 years of physical, cul
tural and psychological genocide" by
sterilizing thousands of Native
American women each year, United
Native Americans President Lee
Brightman told a group of 40 in
Kresge Auditorium Thursday night.
Brightman spoke for an hour on
sterilization of Native Americans.
Four other speakers followed him,
advocating a political coalition of
minorities.
The government "has quit killing
Indians with guns," but if the alleged
sterilization program keeps up,
"we'll soon reach a time where there
will be no more Indians," Brightman
said.
He cited a report made by U.S.
Sen. James Abourezk (D-S.D.) which
states that 3406 Native American
women and 142 men in four states
were sterilized between 1973 and
1976.
