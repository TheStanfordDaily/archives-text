# Owen prepares medieval feast for Branner
## 
### Kerri Culbertson 
The large dining room is
dark, lit only by several dozen
candles fitted in candelabras.
Rich wooden tables are ar
ranged to form a formal ban
quet "u," and traversing their
centers are long lengths of
royal purple runners. The ceil
ing is high and flanked with
wooden beams. Huge iron
candelabras hang from the
crossbeams. The windows are
large, reaching nearly to the
top of the ceiling, and are
draped with yards and yards of
flowing material.
Diners are seated on both
sides of the table, eating and
drinking, talking and laughing,
not seeming to hear the
medieval music floating
through the room. Classes
clink and an occasional roar of
laughter reaches the far sides
of the room.
Diners reach out and grab
roast turkey legs, and break
open baked potatoes with their
hands. Peanuts are snapped
gingerly and cast into open
mouths; shells are thrown
onto the floor.
A tall, older woman, dressed
in a long, flowing medieval
dress with a laced bodice,
walks slowly beside the tables,
speaking to diners. Her short
crop of blonde-gray hair,
brushed gently back from her
forehead, is topped with a tall
cone-shaped medieval hat. A
thin veil falls freely down the
side. Wrinkles of age set off her
sparkling eyes and her smile
reminds one of a woman who
enjoys the sounds of laughter
and young people.
She stops occasionally, puts
her arm around a diner and
speaks in a low voice. Both
' laugh and she moves on.
Not medieval maiden
This lady, appropriately
dressed for the medieval ban
quet, is not a maiden from the

12th century, but is Ann Owen,
affectionately referred to as
"Mrs. O" by all who know her.
She is the food service man
ager for Branner Hall.
"There's not a better job
around," she said. "Working
with kids and making sure they
eat right — that'swhat I enjoy."
New at Branner this year, but
hardly new to the food busi
ness, Owen has instilled a new
atmosphere in the freshman
dorfo. A distinct feeling of
warmth and comfort fills the
hall, and the students are re
laxed.
Individuality stressed
"The kids enjoy eating
here," Owen said, "and just
because we feed 170 kids
doesn't mean we have to sac
rifice individuality for mass
service.
"It's hard to serve balanced
meals and still keep students
interested. And that's why I try
to get them involved by dres
sing up for the special dinners.
They like that, and it makes eat
ing dorm food a little more
fun."
Owen coordinates all meals
at Branner. She plans and de
corates for special dinners and
coordinates the schedules and
payments for both full-time
and student employees.
Unique atmosphere
But despite the demands
placed on her, Owen is always
smiling and easy to talk to. She
said she works well with her
employees and believes that
this contributes to Branner's
unique atmosphere.
"The students have fun hash
ing," she stressed, "and they
do a good job, too. I love it. I
love working with the kids."
This is not a one-sided opin
ion. Students said they enjoy
Owen as much as she enjoys
them. They appreciate what
she does for them.
"She's great — the easiest

person to work for," one stu
dent said.
"Whenever, there's any
problem with the food, she will
always listen and really try to
change it," another said.
"She brings everyone in the
dorm together and that's
neat," yet another student
said.
Owen said she is convinced
that it's not only the "pencils,
books and calculators" that
make up life at the University,
but the "people, activities and
atmosphere," as well.
"The unacademic part of
school is often overlooked,"
she said, "and this is what I try
to help with. Kids have got to
be able to socialize and relax,
get away from all the pres
sures. I hope I'm helping in this
way."
The medieval music and the
clinking of glasses has stop
ped. Hundreds of peanut
shells cover the floor and
Owen smiles, knowing she'll
have to get someone to clean
up the shells in the morning.

"The kids enjoy eating
here," Owen said, "and just
because we feed 170 kids
doesn't mean we have to sac
rifice individuality for mass
service.
"It's hard to serve balanced
meals and still keep students
interested. And that's why I try
to get them involved by dres
sing up for the special dinners.
They like that, and it makes eat
ing dorm food a little more
fun."
Owen coordinates all meals
at Branner. She plans and de
corates for special dinners and
coordinates the schedules and
payments for both full-time
and student employees.
Unique atmosphere
But despite the demands
placed on her, Owen is always
smiling and easy to talk to. She
said she works well with her
employees and believes that
this contributes to Branner's
unique atmosphere.
"The students have fun hash
ing," she stressed, "and they
do a good job, too. I love it. I
love working with the kids."
This is not a one-sided opin
ion. Students said they enjoy
Owen as much as she enjoys
them. They appreciate what
she does for them.
"She's great — the easiest

person to work for," one stu
dent said.
"Whenever, there's any
problem with the food, she will
always listen and really try to
change it," another said.
"She brings everyone in the
dorm together and that's
neat," yet another student
said.
Owen said she is convinced
that it's not only the "pencils,
books and calculators" that
make up life at the University,
but the "people, activities and
atmosphere," as well.
"The unacademic part of
school is often overlooked,"
she said, "and this is what I try
to help with. Kids have got to
be able to socialize and relax,
get away from all the pres
sures. I hope I'm helping in this
way."
The medieval music and the
clinking of glasses has stop
ped. Hundreds of peanut
shells cover the floor and
Owen smiles, knowing she'll
have to get someone to clean
up the shells in the morning.

around."

Branner residents delve into their food at a recent special dinner.
Adhering to the traditions of medieval times, students grab turkey
legs and break open baked potatoes with their hands.
The large dining room is
dark, lit only by several dozen
candles fitted in candelabras.
Rich wooden tables are ar
ranged to form a formal ban
quet "u," and traversing their
centers are long lengths of
royal purple runners. The ceil
ing is high and flanked with
wooden beams. Huge iron
candelabras hang from the
crossbeams. The windows are
large, reaching nearly to the
top of the ceiling, and are
draped with yards and yards of
flowing material.
Diners are seated on both
sides of the table, eating and
drinking, talking and laughing,
not seeming to hear the
medieval music floating
through the room. Classes
clink and an occasional roar of
laughter reaches the far sides
of the room.
Diners reach out and grab
roast turkey legs, and break
open baked potatoes with their
hands. Peanuts are snapped
gingerly and cast into open
mouths; shells are thrown
onto the floor.
A tall, older woman, dressed
in a long, flowing medieval
dress with a laced bodice,
walks slowly beside the tables,
speaking to diners. Her short
crop of blonde-gray hair,
brushed gently back from her
forehead, is topped with a tall
cone-shaped medieval hat. A
thin veil falls freely down the
side. Wrinkles of age set off her
sparkling eyes and her smile
reminds one of a woman who
enjoys the sounds of laughter
and young people.
She stops occasionally, puts
her arm around a diner and
speaks in a low voice. Both
' laugh and she moves on.
Not medieval maiden
This lady, appropriately
dressed for the medieval ban
quet, is not a maiden from the

12th century, but is Ann Owen,
affectionately referred to as
"Mrs. O" by all who know her.
She is the food service man
ager for Branner Hall.
"There's not a better job
around," she said. "Working
with kids and making sure they
eat right — that'swhat I enjoy."
New at Branner this year, but
hardly new to the food busi
ness, Owen has instilled a new
atmosphere in the freshman
dorfo. A distinct feeling of
warmth and comfort fills the
hall, and the students are re
laxed.
Individuality stressed
