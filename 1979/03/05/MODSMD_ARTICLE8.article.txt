# Debate on abortion emerges again
## 
### Associated Press 
More than six years after the
U.S. Supreme Court struck
down most restrictions on
abortion, the issue is stirring
fresh debate as efforts con
*linue to get Congress to amend
the Constitution to protect the
- rights of the unborn.
* An Associated Press survey
of the 50 states showed that
legislation urging or demand
ing action by Congress has
been approved in 11 states and
is pending in another 11 states.
The issue has stirred debate in
at least half a dozen additional
states.
The Supreme Court ruled in
January 1973 that states gener
ally could not prohibit abor
tions during the first six
months of pregnancy. Since

then, groups contending that
unborn children have a basic
"right to life" have cam
paigned to change the Con
stitution in order to nullify the
effect of the court's ruling.
The resolutions vary slightly
from state to state. Most, how
ever, are similar to one passed
by the Arkansas legislature in
1977, urging Congress to call a
constitutional convention to
draft an amendment to provide
that "every person shall be
deemed to be a person from
the moment of conception or
fertilization and entitled to the
right to life guaranteed by the
U.S. Constitution."
A constitutional convention
can be called if two-thirds of
the states request one. Any
amendment resulting from a

convention — or from other
action by Congress — must be
ratified by three-fourths of the
states to become law.
Along with the drive for a
convention to deal with the
abortion issue, a campaign is
under way to call such a ses
sion to draft an amendment
requiring a balanced federal
budget. There has been no
constitutional convention
since 1787.
A measure calling for a con
vention to the "right-to-life"
issue is pending in Illinois.
State Sen. Mark Rhoads, one of
the sponsors, said: "There re
ally isn't anything more fun
damental to civil rights than a
definition of what human life is
. . . I think it's subject matter
worthy of debate in a constitu-

tional convention."
The 11 states which have
passed legislation calling for a
"right-to-life" amendment
are: Arkansas, Delaware, In
diana, Louisiana, Mas
sachusetts, Mississippi, Mis
souri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island and Utah.
The status of the Pennsyl
vania action, which came in
1978, is confused, however,
because then-Gov. Milton
Shapp vetoed the legislation.
The legislature ignored Shapp
and forwarded the resolution
to Congress without either the
state's official seal or the gov
ernor's signature. It will ulti
mately be up to the courts to
determine the validity of the
measure.
