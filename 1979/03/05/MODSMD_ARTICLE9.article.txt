# Two anti-draft groups form
## 
### Andrew Rich 
With at least five different bills now before
Congress to reinstate some form of mandat
ory military conscription, there has been a
fast growing anti-draft concern on campus.
Two groups have been organized to mobilize
student efforts towards opposing these bills
â€” Students Against the Draft (SAD) and
People's Effort Against Conscription
Everywhere (PEACE).
SAD was drawn together a few weeks ago
by sophomore Jeff Lepape. He explained, "A
lot of people expressed discontent over the
publicity of Rep. Pete McCloskey's (R-Menlo
Park) bill."
The bill would require all men and women
to register at age 17. Once registered, an in
dividual would have four service options.
Two options require voluntary military ser
vice, one requires civilian service in a Peace
Corps or environmental capacity, and the
other option allows a person to be placed in a
voluntary pool subject to being drafted
within the next six years.
Lepape said he does not believe there is a
need for building up the military sector. "I
think McCloskey is using the old Cold War
scare . . . and regardless, I don't think the
answer to strengthening our national de
fense is to force people to do something they
don't want to."
SAD member Lisa Hogeland agrees. "It's
an infringement of my rights. Besides, the
only reason they would need more people in
the army is if they were gearing up for some
thing." Pro-draft spokesmen have criticized
the quality of the present army, but, Hoge
land said, "How much intelligence does it
take to serve in the army?"
Hogeland was drawn to SAD because, she
said, "there's a lot of people on campus who
have no idea what's going on." The group's
main purpose, as described by Lepape, will
be information gathering and publicity. "We
want to express our opinion to politicians
and to the public. We're trying to unite indi
viduals, ethnic groups, women's groups, re

publicans, socialists, etc., who are against
the draft.
"We don't want this organization to be
steered by any one political view within the
Stanford community. It has to be an issue
oriented rather than ideological group,"
Lepape said.
SAD plans to kick off its activities by spon
soring a talk by David Harris on campus
Thursday night.
"The time to start making our point heard
is before the legislation materializes," he
said. "People shouldn't let the government
gloss over our Vietnam experience by trying
to provoke patriotism."
PEACE, the other organization, formed to
act specifically against the draft bills. Based in
Synergy House, the organization is working
with a coalition of campus and Community
groups.
"We're against conscription and registra
tion in any form," said member Matt Haber,
who feels that both are infringements of per
sonal freedom by the government. Haber
pointed out that many of the bills allow gov
ernment inspection of various records in
order to enforce mandatory registration,
which he considers an invasion of privacy.
Haber said McCloskey's bill is "not practical.
He'd have to find jobs for about 75 percent of
the youths, who would choose the non
military option." This would amount to about
three million new jobs in an already recessive
economy. ,
Haber, like Hogeland, does not see a need
for more people in the armed forces. "A
larger army is a step towards war. If we had a
larger army, we might have gotten involved
in Angola or Iran," he says. Since future wars
will be technical in nature, "the army we have
now is too large," Haber added.
The main goal of PEACE is to educate the
community about the mandatory conscrip
tion issue. They plan to organize rallies, dis
tribute information, and initiate a Peace
Week next quarter.
