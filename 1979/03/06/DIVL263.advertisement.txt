That s when our General Dynamics
team will be on campus to talk to you !■! Wk
about your future. We're probably best
known as a leading American defense
contractor. But we also have wide-ranging
programs in many other high technology
fields as well. We offer qualified graduates
broad corporate career paths in many
diverse areas: Aerospace. Data Systems.
Marine. Building Products and Resources.
Telecommunications and Electronics. iT" ®
There are truly outstanding opportunities
in nearly every engineering and scientific
discipline with particular emphasis on the
computer
Disciplines:
Aeronautical, Chemical, Civil,
Computer Science, Electrical,
Electronic, Industrial, Mathematics,
Materials, Manufacturing,,
Metallurgical, Mining, Marine,
Mechanical, Nuclear, Optics, Physics,
Reliability, Welding.
Be sure to inquire about Co-op and
Summer Intern programs with General
Dynamics.
There will be an orientation meeting
held the evening before our visit. Be sure
