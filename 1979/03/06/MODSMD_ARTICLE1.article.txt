# Chinese claim troop withdrawal, but Hanoi reports escalation
## 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — China
said yesterday it was withdrawing its
invasion army from Vietnam after a
bloody 16-day war of "punishment,"
but Hanoi claimed the fighting was
actually escalating and ordered a
general mobilization "for national
salvation."
Peking's official news agency said
Chinese troops began pulling out
yesterday after achieving their goal
of "dealing devastating blows to Vie
tnamese armed forces." It warned
Vietnam against new border provo
cations.
Several hours later, the newspaper
of the Vietnamese Communist Party
said the Chinese announcement "is
contrary to the real situation in the
battlefields."
Stepping up aggression
China "is stepping up its aggres
sion, and its troops are frantically de
stroying Vietnamese villages," the
paper Nhan Dan said in a commen
tary reported by the Vietnamese
News Agency.
It said Vietnamese President Ton
Due Thang signed a general mobili
zation decree yesterday instructing
all military-age citizens to join the
armed forces.
"All necessary manpower, mate
rial and financial resources shall be
mobilized to meet the needs of war
for national salvation," it said.
The Japanese Embassy in Hanoi
said Vietnamese officials had in
structed it to prepare air-raid shelters
for its personnel, japan's Kyodo
news service reported.
No sign of pull-out
Intelligence sources in Bangkok
said yesterday they had no evidence
of a Chinese pull-out or signs that the
Chinese were preparing new attacks.
But the reports by these sources have
lagged behind events throughout
the war.
Some observers said the Chinese
troops might be following a
"scorched-earth" policy in with

drawing from Vietnam, and this
could be the "stepped-up aggres
sion" the Vietnamese reported.
Others noted if was likely the fight
ing would not end abruptly but
would wind down to small-scale
border skirmishing.
Even if a Chinese withdrawal takes
place, it will not end the tensions in
Southeast Asia. Vietnam's rebel pro
teges yesterday scored a new victory
in Cambodia against Chinese
backed guerrillas, and the fighting
there moved closer to the Thailand
border.
Stop Cambodia attacks
In announcing the pull-out, Chi
na's official Xinhua (Hsinhua) news
agency called on "peace-loving" na
tions to "urge the Vietnamese au
thorities to stop promptly their ag
gression against Kampuchea (Cam
bodia) and withdraw all their forces
of invasion."
The Xinhua statement also warned
that China reserves the right "to
strike back again in self-defense" if
the Vietnamese resume border pro
vocations against China. When it
sent its troops storming across the
Vietnamese frontier Feb. 17, Peking
said it was "punishing" Hanoi for
border incidents.
Failed to teach lesson
A Vietnam radio broadcast yester
day said China's leaders "failed in
their large-scale invasion to teach
Vietnam a lesson and could not fulfill
their expansionist aims."
The Xinhua announcement called
for immediate talks between the two
countries "to discuss ways on ensur
ing peace and tranquility . . . and
then proceed to settle the boundary
and territorial disputes."
Reports from Peking quoting un
identified Chinese officials have in
dicated that China may hold on to
some disputed territory previously
controlled by the Vietnamese. One
report said it involves less than 40
square miles scattered along the

700-mile border.
A Vietnamese newspaper report
yesterday said that in some border
areas seized by the Chinese troops
"they built Chinese-style houses and
flew the Chinese flag in an attempt to
permanently occupy the area."
The Soviet news agency Tass said
the Pekingannouncement "confirms
that China continues to covet Viet
namese lands." Moscow has re
peatedly warned China to pull out of
Soviet-allied Vietnam but has not
threatened any specific reprisal.
Both Vietnam and the Soviets con
tend that China has brought up fresh
army units to the battle area in recent
days, and they charge that Peking
may be plotting an attack on
Vietnam-dominated Laos as well
10 percent killed
A Hanoi report said 10 percent of
the Chinese invasion force was killed
or wounded. It gave no figures, but a
Vietnamese report Sunday claimed
there had been almost 42,000
Chinese casualties.
Western analysts consider this fi
gure inflated. Vietnam has not re
ported its own casualties, and China
has issued no casualty figures.
A Hanoi battle report yesterday
claimed the Vietnamese had killed
hundreds of Chinese trying to take
the provincial capital of Lang Son, 80
miles north of Hanoi, in a three
pronged attack Sunday. But intelli
gence sources in Bangkok and
elsewhere said the Vietnamese had
lost Lang Son days earlier.
Some analysts here had predicted
that regardless of its real losses in the
righting, Vietnam would proclaim a
great victory once the Chinese with
drew.
In Cambodia, soldiers of the new
regime set up by Vietnam hoisted
their flag at Poipet, a key Cambodian
crossing point at the Thai frontier.
Thai sources said guerrillas of the
ousted Pol Pot government retreated
from Poipet toward the south.

troops might be following a
"scorched-earth" policy in with

drawing from Vietnam, and this
could be the "stepped-up aggres
sion" the Vietnamese reported.
Others noted if was likely the fight
ing would not end abruptly but
would wind down to small-scale
border skirmishing.
Even if a Chinese withdrawal takes
place, it will not end the tensions in
Southeast Asia. Vietnam's rebel pro
teges yesterday scored a new victory
in Cambodia against Chinese
backed guerrillas, and the fighting
there moved closer to the Thailand
border.
Stop Cambodia attacks
In announcing the pull-out, Chi
na's official Xinhua (Hsinhua) news
agency called on "peace-loving" na
tions to "urge the Vietnamese au
thorities to stop promptly their ag
gression against Kampuchea (Cam
bodia) and withdraw all their forces
of invasion."
The Xinhua statement also warned
that China reserves the right "to
strike back again in self-defense" if
the Vietnamese resume border pro
vocations against China. When it
sent its troops storming across the
Vietnamese frontier Feb. 17, Peking
said it was "punishing" Hanoi for
border incidents.
Failed to teach lesson
A Vietnam radio broadcast yester
day said China's leaders "failed in
their large-scale invasion to teach
Vietnam a lesson and could not fulfill
their expansionist aims."
The Xinhua announcement called
for immediate talks between the two
countries "to discuss ways on ensur
ing peace and tranquility . . . and
then proceed to settle the boundary
and territorial disputes."
Reports from Peking quoting un
identified Chinese officials have in
dicated that China may hold on to
some disputed territory previously
controlled by the Vietnamese. One
report said it involves less than 40
square miles scattered along the

700-mile border.
A Vietnamese newspaper report
yesterday said that in some border
areas seized by the Chinese troops
"they built Chinese-style houses and
flew the Chinese flag in an attempt to
permanently occupy the area."
The Soviet news agency Tass said
the Pekingannouncement "confirms
that China continues to covet Viet
namese lands." Moscow has re
peatedly warned China to pull out of
Soviet-allied Vietnam but has not
threatened any specific reprisal.
Both Vietnam and the Soviets con
tend that China has brought up fresh
army units to the battle area in recent
days, and they charge that Peking
may be plotting an attack on
Vietnam-dominated Laos as well
10 percent killed
A Hanoi report said 10 percent of
the Chinese invasion force was killed
or wounded. It gave no figures, but a
Vietnamese report Sunday claimed
there had been almost 42,000
Chinese casualties.
Western analysts consider this fi
gure inflated. Vietnam has not re
ported its own casualties, and China
has issued no casualty figures.
A Hanoi battle report yesterday
claimed the Vietnamese had killed
hundreds of Chinese trying to take
the provincial capital of Lang Son, 80
miles north of Hanoi, in a three
pronged attack Sunday. But intelli
gence sources in Bangkok and
elsewhere said the Vietnamese had
lost Lang Son days earlier.
Some analysts here had predicted
that regardless of its real losses in the
righting, Vietnam would proclaim a
great victory once the Chinese with
drew.
In Cambodia, soldiers of the new
regime set up by Vietnam hoisted
their flag at Poipet, a key Cambodian
crossing point at the Thai frontier.
Thai sources said guerrillas of the
ousted Pol Pot government retreated
from Poipet toward the south.
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — China
said yesterday it was withdrawing its
invasion army from Vietnam after a
bloody 16-day war of "punishment,"
but Hanoi claimed the fighting was
actually escalating and ordered a
general mobilization "for national
salvation."
Peking's official news agency said
Chinese troops began pulling out
yesterday after achieving their goal
of "dealing devastating blows to Vie
tnamese armed forces." It warned
Vietnam against new border provo
cations.
Several hours later, the newspaper
of the Vietnamese Communist Party
said the Chinese announcement "is
contrary to the real situation in the
battlefields."
Stepping up aggression
China "is stepping up its aggres
sion, and its troops are frantically de
stroying Vietnamese villages," the
paper Nhan Dan said in a commen
tary reported by the Vietnamese
News Agency.
It said Vietnamese President Ton
Due Thang signed a general mobili
zation decree yesterday instructing
all military-age citizens to join the
armed forces.
"All necessary manpower, mate
rial and financial resources shall be
mobilized to meet the needs of war
for national salvation," it said.
The Japanese Embassy in Hanoi
said Vietnamese officials had in
structed it to prepare air-raid shelters
for its personnel, japan's Kyodo
news service reported.
No sign of pull-out
Intelligence sources in Bangkok
said yesterday they had no evidence
of a Chinese pull-out or signs that the
Chinese were preparing new attacks.
But the reports by these sources have
lagged behind events throughout
the war.
Some observers said the Chinese
troops might be following a
"scorched-earth" policy in with

drawing from Vietnam, and this
could be the "stepped-up aggres
