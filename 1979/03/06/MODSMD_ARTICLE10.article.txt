# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Chris Kelly Develop Lake Lagunita 
### 
Every fall quarter new freshmen arrive on
campus. They wander over to Lake Lagunita ex
pecting to see the beautiful sight so well cap
tured by the lenses of the Approaching Stanford
photographers, but are met with only a
dustbowl and a crop of weeds.
"Why," they ask plaintively, "is our beautiful
lake full of dirt?" When they return in the
springtime to azure, neo-Mediterranean waters,
they ask again, with more assurance, "Why isn't
the lake year-round?"
They are not alone. The question has been
asked time and again by students, faculty, staff
and visitors. And the answer is because it costs
money, and money isn't generally available for
aesthetics on campus, unless specifically ear
marked for it by the donor.
None other than the founder of the Farm
himself, old Leland Stanford, intended the lake
to be year-round. Being in a position of author
ity, he had tons of clay hauled in to be spread
around the bottom and packed down by
thousands of sheep, purchased for that very
purpose. The seepage slowed, but could not
quite be stopped.
Then came World War 11, and the age of the
Victory Garden. The bottom of the Fake was
plowed up to be used to grow food, allowing
more farm produce to be shipped overseas to
Our Boys. The solid bottom was never replaced,
and to this day, Lagunita is a seasonal lake.
Interest in the idea of making the lake year
round never really subsided though, and prop
osals kept cropping up. In 1967, the University
hired a Los Angeles engineering consulting firm
to make a report on the feasibility of various
methods of sealing the lake. The Bradberry Re
port recommended grouting around the levee
to prevent seepage through the sides at a cost
(then) of about $75,000, including a new beach.
TheCOPand ASSU Financial Managerwrotea
report in 1974 recommending construction of a
new boathouse to coincide with University ac
tion on the lake and new student housing. But
interest dried up with the lake that summer and
the report was virtually forgotten during the
drought.
Now, with the new dorm only two or three
years away, interest is renewed in the project.
The population in the vicinity of the lake will be
increased by 800, which added to the current
populations of Roble, Lagunita and Florence

Moore makes it the location of half the under
graduate student body. The lake and boathouse
will achieve new significance as a de facto stu
dent center. The potential for development is
vast.
As things stand right now, the boathouse is
still decaying. Dry rot has consumed much of
the structure and major structural members
have had to be replaced just to keep the thing
from falling down. No one will insure the
boathouse against fire. It remains standing by
the grace of Cod and friendly Palo Alto building
inspectors.
The lake continues to be drained each sum
mer and then filled in the winter. There is a
shortage of student office and meeting space on
campus. And yet there are no University plans to
alleviate these problems through development
of the lake.
Student and alumni interest in Lagunita re
mains high. Nearly everyone on campus goes to
the lake at some time or another to swim or sail
or row or sunbathe, or just take a walk around
the levee.
The University budget for maintenance of the
boathouse remains the same as it was during the
drought, and allocation for payment of
lifeguards is the same as well. The result is po
tentially decreased safety and an increased de
ficit, both of which can be remedied for next
year by passage of a $1 fee assessment this
spring.
To take full advantage of the lake's potential as
an aesthetic, recreational and student center
will take an enormous amount of long-range
planning, and from $500,000 to $750,000. The
need is there and the money can be raised.
Memorial Auditorium was built with student
donations. Tresidder Union and the Storke Pub
lications Building were partially funded by stu
dent contributions. Considering that they, too,
were once students, the alumni can recognize
the need for such a project, and will provide
funding if it is brought to their attention. We
have to go out and stump for support from po
tential donors of any kind, both to raise funding
priority and begin the stockpile of cash dollars
which will eventually pay for the project.
. Once interest reaches the critical stage, the
sky is the limit in improvement and beautifica
tion of Lake Lagunita.
