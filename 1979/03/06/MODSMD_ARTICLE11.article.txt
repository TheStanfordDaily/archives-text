Statements
too sweeping
TheDa/7y article of Feb. 20th,
"Davis urges fight against ra
cism, sexism," fell prey to a
trend in Daily coverage of
campus events that I find most
disconcerting.
The easy way out is to focus
on the big name and scrupul
ously quote the sweeping
statements with a dramatic ring
to them. Although this ap
proach might be the safest for
the reporter, it is also the least
constructive for the Stanford
community.
The basic problem is that
broad, historical observations
such as, "Racism and sexism
always nourish each other,"
tend to be near useless when it
comes down to trying to plan
and execute a program of
forceful action to eradicate the
omnipresent yet often-elusive
subtle forces in our society of
racism and sexism.
A reporter must (as we all
must) make that fateful leap
from detached, passive obser
vation to a creative synthesis of
the issues involved. Please
dare to postulate how a
speaker's message might help
us to focus on very real prob
lems we have on this campus.

At the very least give the read
ers some idea of how it hap
pened that Angela Davis — a
leading, radical activist of the
60s seldom in the news these
days — happened to be at the
l-Center.
Obviously the reporter mis
sed the main point by failing to
mention that Davis was speak
ing on campus at the invitation
of the Stanford YWCA. Her ad
dress was just one component
of an almost four-hour prog
ram organized by the YWCA.
The program also included ad
vance registration in one of
four workshops which specifi
cally sought to examine ques
tions such as: How should
women's liberation groups use
their collective strength to help
combat racism, and how on a
personal level can our relation
ships with men either help or
hinder our struggle?
As a participant, I found the
workshops and a chance to
meet women (and a few men)
with concerns similar to mine
to be the most exciting aspect
of the program. I took special
interest in the last question on
the evaluation sheet we were
asked to fill out: "What would
you like to see happen next?"

Fight credentialism:
hire Banks
The decision of the ASSU
Senate to table the motion for
appointing Dennis Banks isdis
turbing in light of the reason
supplied in the Daily article
(March 2).
It is depressing to see the
anti-intellectualism and cre
dentialism in the citing of
Ellsberg's "Ph.D. in economics
from Harvard and his former
employment by Rand Corpora
tion" as a rationalization for
preferring Ellsberg. These
signs of personal and profes
sional legitimacy used as
criteria illustrate what Irving
Buchen referred to as the syn
drome in which "condemna
tion ... is usually a refuge for
those already comfortable."
Similar logic could no doubt
be applied in hiring Milton
Friedman over Karl Marx, Erich
Segal over Jose Marti, and Al
bert Shanker to Cesar Chavez,
and so on ... I exaggerate the
point, but it is important to
recognize — especially in
student-allotted professor
ships — that credentials and
employment background do
not necessarily have relevance
to what a person can teach.
As for Erik Thompson's point
concerning Banks' conviction
in South Dakota, I submit that
this kind of automatic, weak
kneed, and shallow judgment
provokes timidity towards
"transgressors." It will provide
nothing short of those who
prescribe a path of least resis
tance at all times.
Finally, Ron Johnson's suc
cinct question: "Who was
Banks before Wounded Knee
and who was Ellsberg before
the Pentagon Papers?" does an
unjustice to both men. Would
Johnson have also asked who
Henry was before the Ameri
can Revolution or Lowry be
fore Under the Volcano? Both
Ellsberg and Banks are not
parasites of incidence, but ac
tivists, and in the decisions
they made, thoughtful forces
for necessary social changes.
Banks should be hired be
cause his knowledge of Native
Americans and social move
ments is acute and sorely lack
ing at Stanford. The confused
reticence of the senate is
another sign of lower priorities
for certain groups and a pre
ference for the safe choice.

Concept criticized
I confess that I found Kurt
Cobb's article on Americans'
lack of courage (Daily, Feb. 22)
somewhat confusing. His cent
ral theme seemed to be that
the average American has lost
the courage to stand up for
himself against various forms
of assault, and that in order to
regain this courage, he/she
must endeavor to acquire a
"sense of community."
To defend oneself requires
the conviction that one's "self"
is worthy of defense — which
requires, among other things,
that one have a firm concept of
what "self" is. But a sense of
"self" is directly antagonistic to
a sense of community (Cobb
recognizes this when he be
moans the "preoccupation
with self" in America).
To truly gain a "sense of
community" one must first
lose his sense of individuality
— one is asked to blend in
rather than stand out. One is
admonished to subordinate
one's own desires and benefit
to those of the group as a
whole.
Cobb himself advocates
cooperation and compromise,
a "sense of mutual responsibil
ity." As an example of this he
holds up the Soviet Union, say
ing that their lack of affluence
makes them less tolerant of
crime. Perhaps — although it
could also be due to a lack of
anything worth stealing.
Further, some of his infor
mation is just plain incorrect.
The Soviet police apparatus
does not consist of 400,000
poeple. The KGB alone has an
actual staff of 250,000. In addi
tion, it has a group of 400,000 to
600,000 paid informants who
work on a contract basis.
Lastly, the army of some
500,000 at present arrayed
along the Sino-Soviet border is
responsible to the KCB.
There is at least one KCB
agent, informer or soldier for
every 250 Soviet citizens — a
degree of surveillance unim
aginable and intolerable in
America.(I refer anyone in
terested to the book KCB by
John Barron for more informa
tion.) Apparently the Soviet
Union does not share Cobb's
opinion as to the prevalence of
crime.
If this is the kind of "com
munity" Cobb advocates, I'll
be glad to take my chances
with the muggers and thieves.
At least they don't try to tell me
that they're acting for my be
nefit.

Ellsberg and Banks are not
parasites of incidence, but ac

they made, thoughtful forces

Banks should be hired be

Concept criticized
I confess that I found Kurt
Cobb's article on Americans'
lack of courage (Daily, Feb. 22)
somewhat confusing. His cent
ral theme seemed to be that
the average American has lost
the courage to stand up for
himself against various forms
of assault, and that in order to
regain this courage, he/she
must endeavor to acquire a
"sense of community."
To defend oneself requires
the conviction that one's "self"
is worthy of defense — which
requires, among other things,
that one have a firm concept of
what "self" is. But a sense of
"self" is directly antagonistic to
a sense of community (Cobb
recognizes this when he be
moans the "preoccupation
with self" in America).
To truly gain a "sense of
community" one must first
lose his sense of individuality
— one is asked to blend in
rather than stand out. One is
admonished to subordinate
one's own desires and benefit
to those of the group as a
whole.
Cobb himself advocates
cooperation and compromise,
a "sense of mutual responsibil
ity." As an example of this he
holds up the Soviet Union, say
ing that their lack of affluence
makes them less tolerant of
crime. Perhaps — although it
could also be due to a lack of
anything worth stealing.
Further, some of his infor
mation is just plain incorrect.
The Soviet police apparatus
does not consist of 400,000
poeple. The KGB alone has an
actual staff of 250,000. In addi
tion, it has a group of 400,000 to
600,000 paid informants who
work on a contract basis.
Lastly, the army of some
500,000 at present arrayed
along the Sino-Soviet border is
responsible to the KCB.
There is at least one KCB
agent, informer or soldier for
every 250 Soviet citizens — a
degree of surveillance unim
aginable and intolerable in
America.(I refer anyone in
terested to the book KCB by
John Barron for more informa
tion.) Apparently the Soviet
Union does not share Cobb's
opinion as to the prevalence of
crime.
If this is the kind of "com
munity" Cobb advocates, I'll
be glad to take my chances
with the muggers and thieves.
At least they don't try to tell me
that they're acting for my be
nefit.

Statements
too sweeping
TheDa/7y article of Feb. 20th,
"Davis urges fight against ra
cism, sexism," fell prey to a
trend in Daily coverage of
campus events that I find most
disconcerting.
The easy way out is to focus
on the big name and scrupul
ously quote the sweeping
statements with a dramatic ring
to them. Although this ap
proach might be the safest for
the reporter, it is also the least
constructive for the Stanford
community.
The basic problem is that
broad, historical observations
such as, "Racism and sexism
always nourish each other,"
tend to be near useless when it
comes down to trying to plan
and execute a program of
forceful action to eradicate the
omnipresent yet often-elusive
subtle forces in our society of
racism and sexism.
A reporter must (as we all
must) make that fateful leap
from detached, passive obser
vation to a creative synthesis of
the issues involved. Please
dare to postulate how a
speaker's message might help
us to focus on very real prob
lems we have on this campus.

At the very least give the read
ers some idea of how it hap
pened that Angela Davis — a
leading, radical activist of the
60s seldom in the news these
days — happened to be at the
l-Center.
Obviously the reporter mis
sed the main point by failing to
mention that Davis was speak
ing on campus at the invitation
of the Stanford YWCA. Her ad
dress was just one component
of an almost four-hour prog
ram organized by the YWCA.
The program also included ad
vance registration in one of
four workshops which specifi
cally sought to examine ques
tions such as: How should
women's liberation groups use
their collective strength to help
combat racism, and how on a
personal level can our relation
ships with men either help or
hinder our struggle?
As a participant, I found the
workshops and a chance to
meet women (and a few men)
with concerns similar to mine
to be the most exciting aspect
of the program. I took special
interest in the last question on
the evaluation sheet we were
asked to fill out: "What would
you like to see happen next?"

Fight credentialism:
hire Banks
The decision of the ASSU
Senate to table the motion for
appointing Dennis Banks isdis
turbing in light of the reason
supplied in the Daily article
(March 2).
It is depressing to see the
anti-intellectualism and cre
dentialism in the citing of
Ellsberg's "Ph.D. in economics
from Harvard and his former
employment by Rand Corpora
tion" as a rationalization for
preferring Ellsberg. These
signs of personal and profes
sional legitimacy used as
criteria illustrate what Irving
Buchen referred to as the syn
drome in which "condemna
tion ... is usually a refuge for
those already comfortable."
Similar logic could no doubt
be applied in hiring Milton
Friedman over Karl Marx, Erich
Segal over Jose Marti, and Al
bert Shanker to Cesar Chavez,
and so on ... I exaggerate the
point, but it is important to
recognize — especially in
student-allotted professor
ships — that credentials and
employment background do
not necessarily have relevance
to what a person can teach.
As for Erik Thompson's point
concerning Banks' conviction
in South Dakota, I submit that
this kind of automatic, weak
kneed, and shallow judgment
provokes timidity towards
"transgressors." It will provide
nothing short of those who
prescribe a path of least resis
tance at all times.
