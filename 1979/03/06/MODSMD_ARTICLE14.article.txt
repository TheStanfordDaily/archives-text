## Slash American military spending 
### 
It is time to introduce the
Pentagon to the spirit of Prop
osition 13.
When the American people
are rightly calling for a drastic
reduction in taxation and gov
ernment spending, both the
Carter Administration and its
conservative opponents have
opted for an increase in milit
ary spending.
American military spending
is largely directed at two objec
tives: first, to support the
American alliance with the
other industrial democracies
(essentially Japan and the
NATO powers of Western
Europe) and second, to project
American power and influence
in the Third World.
The trilateral alliance among
the United States, Japan and
Western Europe is simply un
necessary. Both Japan and

Western Europe are fully capa
ble — in terms of technology,
population and economics —
of providing for their own de
fense. American participation
in the trilateral alliance consti
tutes nothing but an interna
tional handout in which the
American taxpayer is milked to
subsidize the prosperous
economies of Western Europe
and Japan.
American intervention in the
Third World — ranging from
full-scale military actions in
Korea and Vietnam to the
somewhat more restrained
support which the Carter ad
ministration has given dic
tators such as Zaire President
Mobutu Sese Seko and the
Shah of Iran — has been disas
trous.
U.S. policy towards the Third
World has been dominated by
an obsession with stability. The
resulting American defense of
the status quo has forced those
groups in the Third World that
oppose the current repressive
regimes to be anti-American
and has encouraged such
groups to seek friends among
the Communist powers.
It is this American obsession
for maintaining the status quo
— combined with the obvious
bankruptcy of the established
Western ideologies of
welfare-state liberalism,
democratic socialism and tradi
tional conservatism — which is
largely responsible for the
popularity of authoritarian,
nationalist socialism in the
Third World.
In fact, the advance of the
Third World depends not, as
U.S. policymakers assume, on
stability but rather on the de
struction of the feudalism,
socialism and kleptocracy
which now dominate most of

the Third World. We should
not oppose but welcome the
overthrow of most of the cur
rent governments on this
planet.
The domestic costs of
American foreign and military
policy have been high. Massive
military spending has been a
major contributing factor to
galloping inflation and bur
densome taxation. Recent calls
for reinstating the draft have
been fueled by a desire to en
sure our ability to intervene in
foreign wars. The slogans of
"national defense" and "na
tional security" have for de
cades helped lull Americans
into tolerating a bloated and
over-powerful government.
American foreign and milit
ary policy has led to pernicious
consequences both at home
and abroad. It must be
changed.
Specifically:
— All American military per
sonnel abroad should be
brought home and military
bases abroad should be turned
over to the host countries or
closed.
— The U.S. government
should abrogate all interna
tional commitments and
mutual defense treaties to
which it is a party and should
terminate all military and
economic aid to foreign gov
ernments.
— American military forces,
both nuclear and conven
tional, should be reduced to
the minimum level needed to
defend the people and territ
ory of the 50 states.
— Concurrent with these
changes, U.S. military spend
ing should be drasticallv re
duced, and the savings passed
on to the American people
through reduced federal taxa

tion.
To call for the military isola
tion of the American govern
ment is not, of course, to call
for the isolation of the Ameri
can people. Americans should
be free to travel wherever they
wish and to exchange goods or
ideas with whomever they
wish.
The bipartisan, Republican/
Democratic, liberal/ conserva
tive military and foreign policy
of the last three decades has
not worked. It has not brought
the world liberty, peace or sta
bility. It has cost Americans
tens of thousands of lives,
hundreds of billions of dollars
and countless infringements
upon their liberties.
The supporters of that policy
are now recovering from the
setbacks they received in the
wake of Vietnam. They can be
curbed only by dramatically
slashing the military budget
and by compelling the rulers of
this country to submit to the
strict regimen of military
isolationism.
The growing revulsion
against established domestic
policy—the revolt against taxa
tion and over-regulation and
the popular distrust of politi
cians and bureaucrats — must
serve as a beachhead for an as
sault on the existing foreign
and military policy of this na
tion.
We must move towards a
libertarian policy founded on
nonintervention abroad and
on a minimal defense force de
voted solely to defending the
lives and liberties of the people
of the United States.
