## Shirting up for a big game 
### 
Doctor, lawyer, engineering
chief, rich man, unemployed
man, artist, politician. It is a
game I play; all you need is a
shirt with buttons and a sense
of adventure.
To begin, put the shirt on
your back and draw the bottom
button through its button hole.
Now you are a doctor. With
each button, one achieves the
next rank in the rhyme. No fair
rewriting the poetry.
Seven years and forty scores
ago when I was a freshman I
used to play this game.
I sensed that Mom had sent
me off to college with only my
best clothes from high school,
the ones I wore to the inter
views, the shirts with all those
buttons.
Doctor, lawyer, engineering
chief ... I had only begun to
dress. My fingers slowly
worked their way upwards.
Rich man, unemployed
man . . . the shirt grew tighter
around my neck. I groped for
another button. One left: the
top.
Should I go the distance?
What type of people button
their top button? Risk being
different? They must be artists.
I held back. I chose to fit in,
look like everyone else, and
walk around with my top but
ton open.
Sophomore year. I had ex
perienced one year of the Stan
ford experience: I knew all
about life. I started to relax
around girls and wear knit
sport shirts. Doctor,

lawyer ... I had the system
beat. Each shirt had two,
maybe three buttons max. But I
could not maintain the image.
One unusually cold night in
spring quarter I was doing my
laundry in the Wilbur base
ment. So were 15 other experi
enced Stanford males ... all
with one, two and three button
polo shirts. I sensed this was
not my night to do wash.
We were all in the same clas
ses. We would sit together in
"History of Film": 32 yellow
short-sleeves, hung out to dry
in the third row. My shirt was
the one with ring-around-the
collar. My friends all used
Tide; I had the box of White
King Soap Flakes.
I could not go through with
it. I couldn't even make it to the
rinse cycle. The air tasted like
warm soap. I knew my under
wear was not getting white. I
could not face the Tide any
longer. My saliva was begin
ning to suds. And so from atop
a wobbly ironing board, I bub
bled out the words of defeat
and gave each of my clones
one of my polo shirts.
Junior year. Another go at
life and fashion. But I could not
go back to Stanford, the
dorms, the laundry room. I
drew 4632 â€” out of the system.
Memories of freshman year
came back to me. I longed to
live with a small group of stu
dents in a strange, new envi
ronment, among people
struggling to discover their
identity while assessing the
cosmic issue "where will all

this buttoning end?".
So I went overseas:
Stanford-in-Britain, museums,
the theater, and the English
styles in evening wear.
This time I came back to the
Farm inspired. It was about
time, as I had already grown up
to be a senior. While still in the
Isles, at some second-hand
shop, I found a shirt from India
with more buttons down its
front than occupations in my
child's rhyme.
Only after I took Philosophy
5 spring quarter did I perceive
the significance of this cloth.
When I played the game, if I
felt uncertain about the occu
pation that the last button
foretold, the button would fall
off.
I wore that shirt under my
graduation robe. This tradi
tional gown zipped up in the
front. Its designers understood
the mystery of the rhyme.
I wear lots of different shirts
now that I am in graduate
school. I even bought a
turtleneck. But that is a style re
served for the rich. They live in
the overflow of their families'
millions, are not threatened
with unemployment, and will
never know the insecurity that
stems from having a top but
ton.
I still play the game. And as I
get ready to leave graduate
school, I will probably turn in
ward, start at my navel, and
begin slowly to button up.
