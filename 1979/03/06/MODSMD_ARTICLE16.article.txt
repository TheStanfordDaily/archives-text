# Litt examines medical care system in Poland

"In Lublin we were driven
around on a farm in a horse
drawn carriage. It was made
known to us that we should
tip the driver, and so we all
pulled out our zlotys, the
Polish money. But our Polish
colleagues asked if we could
give American money to the
man so that his son could buy
American jeans."
America's greatest interna
tional achievement — the
blue-jeaning of the world. In
Poland, as elsewhere, Ameri
can styles of dress are copied
by the young. But is the re
semblance only "jean deep?"
Assoc. Pediatrics Prof. Iris Litt
visited Poland in September
and had a chance to closely
observe the country, in par
ticular its medical system.
Litt traveled to Poland as a
member of a government
sponsored delegation of
pediatrics specialists. She
said she found the predomi
nance of women physicians
the most striking difference
between the United States
and Polish medical profes
sions.

But the fact that 90 percent
of Polish doctors are women
is, as Litt learned, no indicator
of equal status for women in
the Polish hierarchy of
employment. The prestige of
a doctor in Poland is very low,
despite an educational level
comparable to that of physi
cians here.
"A beginning bus driver
there makes about three
times what a beginning doc
tor makes. Yes, it's true that
most of the physicians are
women, but it is also true that
men are given preferential
treatment in admissions to
medical schools," she said.
Although 98 percent of all
pediatricians in Poland are
women, the department
chairmen are men. Litt said,
"men rise much morequickly
through the hierarchy — and
women think it is right."
Litt said she made friends
with one of the Polish doctors
at the conference. When Litt
asked her how she felt about
her department chairman
being a man Litt said she re
plied that, "Well, that's the
way it should be — a man has

to make the decisions."
Strict inequality of the
sexes seemed to pervade
Polish life, Litt said. "I ex
pected, in a socialist country,
that there would be a more
liberated attitude toward
women's rights, and was as
tounded to find that it is not at
all that way. A young father I
met on the street was terribly
embarrassed when his baby
daughter took an interest in
my camera. 'She should have
been a boy,' he said."
Poles manage to blame a
good number of their social
problems on the fact that al
most all women, as well as
men, work outside the home,
Litt said. The mother, in her
rush to get to work, will do
things for her children, such
as tie their shoes, rather than
let them experiment with the
procedure themselves.
Social attitudes toward
women and sexual liberality
seem to be greatly affected by
the strength of Catholicism in
Poland, Litt said. "Figures on
adolescent pregnancy were
incredibly low in comparison
with our figures," she said.

"But since I got to know them
(Poles) and recognize what a
strong Catholic country it is,
it (the low figure) doesn't
surprise me anymore, and I
think it really is true.
The memory of World War
II weighs heavily on the
Polish conscience, according
to Litt. "It's a country that
wants to tell the world of its
regret over the extermina
tions of the lews, and they
want to make it very clear that
it was the Germans who did
all these things." In an effort
to overcome their anti-
Semitic reputation, the Poles
were making a national
monument out of the oldest
synagogue in the country
during Litt's visit.
The Soviet Union hugs Po
land's eastern border, but,
Litt said, "There was little
Russian influence that you
could see. They are a very
nationalistic people who
pride themselves in being
Poles. I was surprised not to
see any posters about
Russian-Polish friendship or
even many restaurant menus
printed in Russian along with

Polish. Usually it was Polish
and French.
"The Poles we got to know
were not at all shy, in informal
contexts, about their dislike
for the Russians. Driving
around the city of Warsaw,
they showed us the incredi
ble Palace of Culture — a gift
from the Russian people in
1962 — and spoke very dis
paragingly about it.
"Then we drove past the
American embassy, which
they admired because it is
simple and small. It seemed
every time we passed an
elaborate building that really
didn't fit in they'd say, 'that's
Russian.' "
Lift said, "There is no ques
tion that the identity of the
people is as Poles, and I think
there is nothing that these
people would like better than
to be in control of their own
destiny."
Lift was chosen for the de
legation on the basis of her
interest and work in adoles
cent health problems. She
conducted her medical train
ing and early research at Cor
nell University before coming

here. The trip abroad was part
of a six-year exchange of in
formation and ideas between
the United States and Poland.
It was sponsored by the in
ternational division of the
Department of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare.
Litt said she made several
close and warm acquain
tances among her Polish col
leagues and hopes to keep up
the contacts through corres
pondence, possibly by plan
ning some joint research with
doctors in Poland. Alcohol
abuse and suicide attempts
are major health problems
among Polish teenagers, as
they are here, she said.
The fact that workers must
obtain medical certificates for
absences from work tends to
clog up doctors' offices with
patients who don't need care,
only certificates. But, the
worst problem Polish
medicine has, Litt said, is
technological backwardness
and lack of adequate equip
ment. "We saw children
dying of renal disease be
cause they haven't got the
technology to implement

dialysis."
The Poles lived up to their
reputation for Slavic generos
ity, Litt said. "We learned
later that meat is hard to
come by, but we had meat at
every meal. The two friends
we got to know best were
constantly giving us things to
take home — souvenirs, toys
for the kids."
The warmth and generosity
of her hosts were among Litt's
fondest memories of the trip,
as well as the chance to see
the live face of a country that
remains, for most, a patch of
color on a map.
