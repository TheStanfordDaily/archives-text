## A 						noted critic views football highlight film 
### 
Under the contradictory
title, The Future is Now, the
Athletic Department has re
leased a highlight film of the
1978 Stanford football sea
son which is a must for Dar
rin Nelson addicts in need
of a fix and anyone who mis
sed Ken Margerum's
touchdown catch in the
waning minutes of the
Tulane game.
But the 18-minute color
film is also being used as a
recruiting and promotional
tool and the second part of
the film neglects aesthetics
to sell the first edition of
Card football under Rod
Dowhower.
The Future is Now resorts
to standard scenes of sex
and violence — Pam Cuzy
providing the cheesecake
and Gordy Ceresino the
bone crunching — to capti
vate its intended audiences
of wealthy alums and nubile
grid stars. Nonetheless,
Nelson stars in some in
novative chase scenes
which film industry people
will marvel at, though never
reproduce, for years.
The plot, stolen from the

pages ot the Daily's Sport
ing White by writer
producer Gary Cavalli,
shares with the viewer the
thrill of victory while taste
fully avoiding the agony of
defeat. Cavalli shows shrewd
judgment in concentrating
on the Big Game and the
third quarter of the
Bluebonnet Bowl. Footage
from the Weenie Roast
alone with satiate any Uni
versity grid buff.
The film features an all
star cast, yet no one but as
sorted Dollies receives
enough screen time.
Multi-purpose back Gordon
Banks, who played
halfback, fullback and
flanker for the Cards last au
tumn, shows added versatil
ity as a dancer whose
choreography would be
fuddle John Travolta. Kicker
Ken Naber has a cameo role
as a bootlegger, but he ain't
no rum runner, while Steve
Dils is cast as the Stanford
quarterbacking legacy with
Turk Schonert billed to in
herit his mantle. Safety
Steve Foley pirates another
scene while stealing a pass

from Oregon State and rac
ing for a 53-yard TD.
As enjoyable as the can
dycoated season review is,
the prospectus for the 1979
season bogs down in
sideline shots of helmetless
players and hyperbolic nar
ration.
The film offers only brief
shots of the Incomparables,
but the absence of their
music is even more keenly
felt. The background score
was stolen from the Muzak
station which plays in your
dentist's office.
Most unacceptable of all,
the movie too often de
mands a complete suspen
sion of the viewers' sense of
reality. No one can be ex
pected to believe:
Nelson's moves on the
TD run in the Big Game
(indeed all of the Nelson
scenes escape our concep
tion of physical possibility),
—Margerum's leaping
catch against Washington,
—Nelson (with his hat on
backwards, which is be
lievable) sitting at the same
table with Margerum and
neither of them smiling,

—Stanford students on
their feet actually yelling
and clapping.
Who are you trying to kid ?
Not me.
I liked the book better.

Yes, the football season's
over, but the memories —
and the highlight films — live
on.
