## guitar/seth zuckerman Fahey: drunken grandeur 
### 
Wednesday night I witnessed a great artistic
tragedy in the hallowed tradition of Dylan
Thomas and his kind. John Fahey, for whom the
acoustic guitar is but an extension of his own
limbs, played at the Great American Music Hall
in the City. He played very well — there are
some who would argue he was in "good form."
Itwas his birthday, and the audience knew — we
all sang "Happy Birthday" when he came out on
stage. But, as he pointed out himself, itwas also
Ash Wednesday.
And that is how I feel about the concert — it
was a day of jubilation but also one of mourning,
for Fahey was drunk, and has been frequently at
his recent performances. While it is true that his
act suffered little, if at all, because of this, there
is something sad, something vaguely pathetic
in the spectacle of a man in his thirties begging
the waitresses for his third double brandy in half
an hour and the management refusing him;
something depressing in a person who is re
duced to that state.
Fahey had an extraordinary rapport with those
assembled — he confessed toward the end of
his set that the producers had told him to stretch
his set by talking to us. And talk he did. We
learned how he is frustrated by the nationwide
55-mph-speed limit, how he resents people ad
miring Leo Kottke, a colleague and former pupil,
on the basis of his speed on the guitar, and how
he is approaching "the abyss." He spoke re
peatedly of the abyss and said that it is steadily
closing in on us, that there is no getting away
from it. The abyss seemed to play a large role is
his dialogue that night, and it is not surprising,
considering the liquor he consumed. Picture, if
you will, a balding man with a paunch, who
looks just like Yogi Bear or a young middle-aged
Archie Bunker who comes home every night to a
docile wife, two docile beers and a TV in subur

bia.
You might doubt that he could play the guitar
like the devil himself, you might not think that
he was capable of a style that nearly forces you
to move in time with it — his ballad, The Great
San Bernardino Birthday Party" is a perfect
example of this — capable of such fantastic mus
ical excesses. But he is and was, and even if he
did appear to sink into a drunken reverie on
stage a couple of times and slow his playing to a
crawl, even if his dialogue was at times incohe
rent but clear and clearly incoherent, even if
someone gave him a cup of tea in response to
his request for brandy, he is still incomparable.
Oh, and by the way, an acoustic guitarist
named Alex DeCrassi came on before Fahey.
DeCrassi was nervous, clearly a newcomer to
the performing arts. He seemed ill at ease on
stage, laughing nervously in a self-deprecating
sort of way, talking to the assembled almost
fearfully in semi-sentences. He played melodi
ously, but he lacked the depth Fahey had —
there were notes, there was music, but little
meaning, little evocation of emotion.
In a sense, the concert was a theater of the
absurd, a mockery of all that is logical. A per
former excelling while drunk, his preceding
act totally lacking the feeling that he had. Fahey
raising his glass of brandy in the Jewish toast
'L'Chayim," and criticizing Kottke's fans for ap
preciating "speed" to the exclusion of anything
else and going right on to bitch about the speed
limit that keeps him from opening up to 75 on a
clear flat stretch, and so on.
But the overall impact wasn't as depressing or
as apocalyptic as the foregoing may have made it
seem. Fahey is still wedded to his guitar. They
get along very well together, and that's what
counts.

You might doubt that he could play the guitar
like the devil himself, you might not think that
he was capable of a style that nearly forces you
to move in time with it — his ballad, The Great
San Bernardino Birthday Party" is a perfect
example of this — capable of such fantastic mus
ical excesses. But he is and was, and even if he
did appear to sink into a drunken reverie on
stage a couple of times and slow his playing to a
crawl, even if his dialogue was at times incohe
rent but clear and clearly incoherent, even if
someone gave him a cup of tea in response to
his request for brandy, he is still incomparable.
Oh, and by the way, an acoustic guitarist
named Alex DeCrassi came on before Fahey.
DeCrassi was nervous, clearly a newcomer to
the performing arts. He seemed ill at ease on
stage, laughing nervously in a self-deprecating
sort of way, talking to the assembled almost
fearfully in semi-sentences. He played melodi
ously, but he lacked the depth Fahey had —
there were notes, there was music, but little
meaning, little evocation of emotion.
In a sense, the concert was a theater of the
absurd, a mockery of all that is logical. A per
former excelling while drunk, his preceding
act totally lacking the feeling that he had. Fahey
raising his glass of brandy in the Jewish toast
'L'Chayim," and criticizing Kottke's fans for ap
preciating "speed" to the exclusion of anything
else and going right on to bitch about the speed
limit that keeps him from opening up to 75 on a
clear flat stretch, and so on.
But the overall impact wasn't as depressing or
as apocalyptic as the foregoing may have made it
seem. Fahey is still wedded to his guitar. They
get along very well together, and that's what
counts.
