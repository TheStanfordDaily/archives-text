## Diamond still mesmerizing 
### 
Sensuality has always been a
main theme in Neil Diamond
songs, whether it is blatantly
expressed in "Desiree" or
softly whispered in "Play Me."
More than 15,000 people
packed San Francisco's Cow
Palace Tuesday night looking
for that sensuality in
Diamond's lyrics and perfor
mance. They were not disap
pointed.
Dressed in tight charcoal
pants and an open-neck silver
sequined shirt, Diamond
sauntered on stage, belted out
a passionate "Desiree" and
then repeated it for those sit
ting in the seats behind the
band.
Throughout the entire 2Vi
hour non-stop performance,
Diamond kept his audience
mesmerized. They watched
teary-eyed while he quietly
told the story of an old man
who died alone, leaving be
hind a gift "For the Children."
They danced in the aisles dur
ing all seven encores of his
newest hit "Forever in Blue
Jeans." And they screamed
with unleashed emotion dur
ing his powerful "Brother
Love's Travelin' Salvation
Show."
His new hits were accepted
with as much enthusiasm as his
1966 "Kentucky Woman" and

"Cherry Cherry."
Diamond performed 20 of
his greatest hits that night plus
part of his beautiful soundtrack
to Jonathan Livingston Seagull.
Only once did he begin to lose
his audience — during the
lengthy repetitions of "Forever
in Blue leans." The middle
aged, conservatively dressed
businessman who had been
dancing in the aisles during the
first three encores had re
duced his efforts to foot
tapping by the fifth rendition
and was busy reading a map of
the City when Diamond finally
stopped the band after the
seventh repetition. Otherwise,
the audience was with him all
the way.
"We'll just keep singing and
playing until we drop or until
you leave, whichever comes
first," he told the audience. He
walked off stage twice that
night, called back each time,
not by whistles and screams,
but by about 500 raised, lit can
dles scattered among mem
bers of the audience. The first
time he returned, he capti
vated the crowd with three
pieces from Seagull; he had
changed during his brief break
into a white shirt adorned with
seagulls.
His second encore included
the wild and powerful

"Soolaimon" and the smooth
"He Ain't Heavy, He's My
Brother."
Perhaps the most beautiful
of all his songs was the heart
rendering duet "You Don't
Bring Me Flowers." Diamond's
accompanist was Linda
Press, whose clear voice
blended well with Diamond's
throaty tones.
Diamond catered to his fans.
They wanted photos and he
gave them photos, calling
everyone down to the stage for
a short photo session with the
promise that thereafter, they
wouldn't blind him with cam
era flashes.
He also catered to those
women who anticipated a sexy
entertainer on stage, but he li
mited it to a soft swaying of the
hips during his livelier num
bers. As he told one young
woman who reached toward
the stage to grab him, "I love
you babe, I do, but I can't right
now because I'm working."
His sensuality is indeed ex
pressed in his lyrics:
"You are the sun, I am the
moon;
You are the words, I am the
tune;
Play me.".
And he showed 15,000
people that night that his sen
suality is also expressed in him.

women who anticipated a sexy
entertainer on stage, but he li
mited it to a soft swaying of the
hips during his livelier num
bers. As he told one young
woman who reached toward
the stage to grab him, "I love
you babe, I do, but I can't right
now because I'm working."
His sensuality is indeed ex
pressed in his lyrics:
"You are the sun, I am the
moon;
You are the words, I am the
tune;
Play me.".
And he showed 15,000
people that night that his sen
suality is also expressed in him.
