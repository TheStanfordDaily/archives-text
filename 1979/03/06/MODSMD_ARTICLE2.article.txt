# New dorm to be done by 1981

'"The announced long-range pol
icy of the University, as the ideal, is
ultimately to house all under
graduate students, men and women,
in University facilities on the cam
pus. . a statement from the mi
nutes of a meeting of the Board of
Trustees in February 1957 read. To
this day, however, this goal remains
elusive.
To help alleviate the problem of
unmet demand foron-campus hous
ing the current board gave the go
ahead last fall for construction of an
800-person dorm.
According to Sally Cole, director of
research for the Office of Student Af
fairs, the residence will be com
pleted by autumn quarter 1981. She
estimated the cost of the dorm at $25
million or $30,000 per living space.
The University will finance the new
dorm either by selling bonds or bor
rowing directly from banks.
According to a housing report pub
lished in )anuary, the new dorm will
replace 460 undergraduate living
spaces in Manzanita Trailer Park.
Single graduates will then occupy the
trailers until they are dismantled in
1990.
The report describes Manzanita as
"educationally unsatisfactory hous
ing for most undergradutes," al
though it conceded that the trailers
were an "admirable response to an
emergency" housing shortage in
1969.
Because undergraduates will no
longer be living in the trailers, the
actual number of additional spaces
available to the University will be 340.
The (anuary report also recom
mends that 54single-graduate spaces
in Mirrielees be reallocated to un
dergraduates, thereby making the
residence entirely undergraduate.
The report written by Cole, Norm
Robinson, associate dean of residen
tial education and Edward Scoles, di
rector of housing management
poirtts out the importance of housing
as an integral part of undergraduate
education. It said that each year
campus housing must be denied to
1000 students.
This is not the case at similar East
Coast universities. While Stanford is
capable of housing about three
quarters of its upperclass students,
Princeton, Dartmouth and Harvard
house 97 percent, 93 percent, and 88
percent respectively, according to
the report.
The report also stated that for edu
cational reasons the housing of un
dergraduates "must have higher
priority" over the housing of single
graduates. However, it suggested
that as many as 1500 spaces for
graduate students could be added by

reassigning spaces in Escondido Vil
lage currently occupied by married
students to single graduate students.
The Advisory Committee for New
Residences is working out the details
for the new dorm. They are exploring
such questions as: Should recrea
tional spaces be centralized? Should
rooms be doubles, triples or suites?
The committee must resolve these
and other questions before it pre
sents a final proposal to the Board of
Trustees in May, the written charge
of the committee states.
The committee is made up of stu
dents and administrators ranging
from house associates (RA's) and re
sident fellows to ASSU Senate mem
bers and the editor of the Daily.
Committee members are holding
weekly meetings, visiting different
types of residences, and talking with
residents about housing activities to
determine the best type of building
for a new dorm.
The dorm will probably be located
on one of the Santa Teresa sites near
Lake Lagunita, the committee's
charge states.
At a recent meeting the committee
debated pros and cons of a suite type

arrangement as well as whether the
dorm should be one centralized
building like Roble or a cluster.
Issues such as these have yet to be
resolved. Norm Robinson, Commit
tee Chair, pointed out at the end of
last week's meeting that "no one has
argued against suites."
Though the definition of "suite"
was not firmly established, most
members agreed with Dean of Stu
dent Affairs lames Lyons' suggestion
that a suite is a series of bedrooms
connected to a common living room.
However, few agreed on how many
students a suite should contain.
A selection committee has already
narrowed the list of possible ar
chitects for the dorm from 150 to less
than 20. Philip Williams, director of
planning and Robert Nerrie, project
manager wiW hold interviews at the
end of the month to narrow the list to
five or six.
Regarding the possibility of power
ing the dorm by solar energy, Cole
said "it is incumbent upon us to
make use of new energy resources.
We want to find an architect who
wouldn't be constrained by energy
considerations."
