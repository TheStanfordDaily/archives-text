## On a very messed-up quiche 
### 
(The movie, The Bell Jar, .is modeled on a seg
ment of the life of the American poet, Sylvia
Plath. Taken from the autobiograhical book of
the same name, it is an account of the events
surrounding a nervous breakdown she suffered
at the end of her junior year at Smith.)
I don't know. Perhaps I became overly critical
of the movie, The Bell Jar, because Marilyn Has
sett, the star, was sitting a few rows behind me
and I didn't think she was that great looking and
I was jealous as hell of her and would have
traded places with her in a second.
Or maybe knowing that Larry Peerce, the di
rector, vyas somewhere in theater, suffering
from sweaty palms and hanging on the audi
ences' response, made me skittish and unusu
ally critical.
Or what could really be bothering me is that,
when a friend of the director asked me after
wards what I thought of the movie, I stammered
something incoherent instead of displaying my
wit and brilliance with an excruciatingly funny
remark.
So, perhaps, in light of the great pressure I
was under, stumbling in on a premiere (after all,
who would have thought they'd pick the Palo
Alto Fine Arts Theater), and worrying about
whether my tennis shoes could be considered a
faux pas under the circumstances, I became irra
tional. And maybe The Bell Jar really was an OK
movie . . . but I doubt it.
There must be other movie buffs who have
the same problem I have being convinced by a
30-year-old actress in the role of a 20-year-old
girl. Even if she is wearing saddle-shoes.
Let's make a simple analogy to clarify The Bell
jar's problem. Let's say a movie is like a quiche.
There are shrimp quiches, crab quiches, mus
hroom quiches, quiche lorraine. . . . Certain
ingredients go into each quiche and make it a
special dish.

The Bell jar is a combination crab, shrimp,
mushroom quiche . . . left in the oven too long.
Just because a certain ingredient is successful in
one movie doesn't necessarily mean that
throwing all the successful ingredients from all
the good movies together will guarantee a suc
cess.
I can imagine exactly how the plot was de
cided. The director, producer, and big investors
were throwing around ideas.
"Well, lots of sex is always good in a movie,"
says one.
"Ya, and unexpected, vicious brutality seems
to score well," someone else adds.
"And since we are dealing with mental illness,
we can trace the cause back to every conceivable
event in Sylvia Plath's life," suggests a third.
"OK, we have sex, brutality and neurosis.
Have we forgotten anything?" queries an inves
tor with a lot of money sunk into the flick.
"I know!" someone from the back of the
room shouts. "The star! Since this story revolves
around one person, we must select her care
fuliy."
"Well, Diane Keaton seems to be very popular
these days. Why don't we get someone like
her?"
"Right. We need someone wholesome,
blond, and Diane Keatonish. How about Marilyn
Hassett, boys?"
Now there is one small problem with Marilyn
Hassett â€” aside from the fact that she isn't kid
ding anybody when she tries to pass for 20. She
is dull when you are forced to watch her for two
hours straight. She isn't even Diane Keatonish.
The Bell )ar is packed with violence, sex and
lots of neurosis. And it's so busy appealing to
everyone it never moves forward, it just lies
there and gives occasional spasmodic twitches
under the weight of its sure-fire formula.
(The Bell jar will open nationally next week.)
