## The
						Company to put on 'Hello, Dolly' 
### 
Small groups scatter about
the Otero lounge. Here a
woman practices leaps into the
arms of her partner, there a fel
low silently mouths a song and
runs over his dance steps for
the number. The Company is
preparing Hello, Dolly, its
winter quarter show.
Allien Rivlin, an actor iri
Dolly, co-director/producer of
Hair, and president of The
Company, talked about the
group after rehearsal. "The
Company is a resource open to
any Stanford student.
Everyone who comes to a
meeting has a vote."
The Company is a non-profit
drama group dedicated to pro
ducing quality shows "without
creating an atmosphere of
competition and over
professionalism.
"There's one thing that a lot
of people don't know about
The Company â€” that anyone
can produce a Company show.
We're anxious for new direc
tors to do non-musicals, farce,
absurd, mystery, anything,"
continued Rivlin.

The Company was dormant
for a few years, then started to
revive with last year's produc
tion of My Fair Lady. Besides
Dolly, which opens this Thurs
day at Tresidder, Hair is cur
rently scheduled for May 31,
]une 1 and 2 at Cubberley, and
The Fantastiks probably will
run during Dead Week, spring
quarter.
Rivlin says, "There's no limit
to the number of shows we can
produce. We're growing."
Members of The Company
back up their claims of a non
competitive atmosphere with
offers of theatrical equipment.
Jane Rozga, director of Dolly,
says that any dorm can use
props not needed at that time
by The Company. "We've got
flats, pillars, stairs, arches.
We've got 20 years worth of as
sorted things."
While dorm shows are in
valuable in bringing together
the members of a dormitory,
The Company "brings together
people from across campus.
Some people involved in Lady
are now in Dolly, as well as new

people."
One night's try-outs for Hair
brought 50 people, many of
whom had never auditioned
before. Rivlin, naturally, is very
excited about the show:
"We're not doing it as a politi
cal statement but as a period

piece to a very political era. The
show deals with a lot of issues:
race relations, war, peace,
non-violence, drugs and sex.
"Hair has a lot of things
going for it. It's a rock musical
with challenging music. We'll
have a nine-piece orchestra in

eluding horns ... A lot of
people feel they just missed it,
both the era and the show."
Hair will cost about $1500
total and its stage will be built
in Cubberley. For the last 15
years. The Company has been
living on, and slowly depleting,
a sizable grant. Because of
their large expenses, both
Dolly and Hair need to charge
$1 for tickets. This year's third
show, The Fantastiks, will be
free.
Rozga, who's also di
recting The Fantastiks, chose
the show because it requires
few props and lends itself eas
ily to mobility. "We'll be taking
the show around to the Chil
dren's Hospital, Tresidder,
dorms, frats, independent
houses. Anybody who wants it
to come around should just
contact me."
