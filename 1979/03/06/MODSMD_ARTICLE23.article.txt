## Great acting in inconsistent play 
### 
The Tavern is George M.
Cohan's valentine to
melodrama, and the Ber
keley Repertory Theatre
plays it for all it's worth —
and then some.
It is a mystery thriller of
the old style with none of
the social relevancies or
psychological complica
tions of modern playwright
ing. The Tavern is two hours
of delicious, delightful non
sense — a wonderful vaca
tion for the brain.
Wacky
"With humor, a certain
wackiness, but always with
a warm heart he (Cohan)
gathered some situations, a
few character types and
mixed them in a location cut
off from the rest of the
world, added a stormy night
and titled it," director John
Friemann declares. And
he's right.
The plot, if you can call it
that, concerns a road side
tavern on a stormy night
where shelter is sought by a
poetic vagabond, a crazy
woman given to fainting, the
state governor, his second
wife, daughter and daugh
ter's fiance.
Between a robbery,

domestic quibbles, bad
guys who are really good
guys and the arrival of the
director of an insane asylum
looking for an escaped pa
tient, there's plenty of ac
tion, drama and humor.
But inconsistent
Friemann, however,
never quite decides how
he's going to handle Cohan,
and the result is a disturb
ingly inconsistent produc
tion. The first act was
straight Mack Sennett —
slapstick and cliches galore

right down to the baridna
peel. Yet in the second act
Friemann abruptly changes
tone and characters step out
of their roles, doing double
takes when the mood music
we all recognize for a love
scene appears, and I was left
wondering if they too
thought things had gone a
bit far. Though most indi
vidual performances are ex
cellent, I felt I was seeing a
series of simultaneous
one-man shows rather than
a cohesive ensemble.

Dale Elliot is wonderful as
Zach, the tavern keeper's
son. He is half Buster
Keaton, half Harold Lloyd,
yet his performance often
appears over-stylized in
comparison to the others.
Enjoyable performances
As the vagabond, Joe De-
Salvio revels in the potpourri
of outlandish guests at the
tavern and spouts poetry as
he philosophizes about life
and 'drama,' adding what
ever questionable depth
there is to the play.
The most enjoyable per
formances were by Julia
Odegard and Mark Ceiger
who brought a hilarious au
thenticity to their roles.
Odegard is perfect as the
chorus girl turned gover
nor's wife who can't leave
her chewing gum behind
and wears diamonds to bed.
Geiger's superlative per
formance as the very proper
and very cowardly tuxedoed
fiance is one certainty in a
very uncertain evening.
(The Tavern plays through
April 75 at the Berkeley Re
pertory Theater, 2980 Col
lege Ave., Berkeley. Student
discounts are available. Call
