Mideast leaders say treaty near
Washington — President |immy Carter, in a drive
to wrap up a Mideast peace treaty, will fly to Enypi
and Israel this week to try and clear awav remain
ing roadblocks to a settlement.
Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil said in
Cairo that Carter's trip "will most likely lead to a
signing."
And Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
noting that the Israeli cabinet has accepted U.S.
proposals for concluding a treaty, said "now there
is a ray of hope."
Addressing members of the U.S. Congress in
Washington, Begin added:
"Let us hope Egypt will join the effort. Then if
this happens, in a short period of time, we may
have the ceremony of signing."
While expressing optimism, Begin noted that a
Middle East peace seemed at hand several limes
previously but was not achieved.
"The world was happy and then came the disap
pointment," Begin said.
He stressed that Israel's concern has been that it
must be able to defend itself against other Arab
countries if the peace does not last.
The principal sticking point has been Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat's demand, backed by the
Carteradministration, that a timetable be included
in the treaty package for establishing Palestinian
self-rule on the West Bank of the ]ordan River and
in Gaza.
An informed source in Jerusalem said Israel
made some movement on the demand.
Shimon Peres, leader of the largest opposition
bloc, welcomed Carter's visit, but predicted
"weighty negotiations" over the plan for Palesti
nian self-rule in the occupied West Bank of lordan
and the Gaza Strip.
Iran resumes limited oil exports
Tehran, Iran — Iran started supplying the world's
hungry oil market for the first time in 10 weeks
yesterday with a shipment of crude oil bound for
japan.
Iran was the world's second largest oil exporter,
next to Saudi Arabia, before the year-long turmoil
that led to the downfall of Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi. The nation's 65,000 oil workers heeded
Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the shah's
religious opposition, and halted exports, thus
helping precipitate fhe collapse of the monarchy.
Yesterday's export consignment, the first since
Dec. 26, was reportedly purchased at about $20 a
barrel, a current price for oil purchased on a spot
basis, but well above the basic $13.35 price set by

the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries (OPEC) in December.
"The days when foreign tankers could come to
Iranian ports and load as much oil as they wanted,
under prices and conditions dictated by them, are
over," said Hassan Nazih, the new managing di
rector ot Iran's state-owned National Iranian Oil
Co. ' We will export only enough to meet our
financial needs."
Amin plans new counteroffensive
Nairobi, Kenya — Ugandan President Idi Amin
abandoned his cease-fire efforts yesterday and cal
led on his army to "fight to the last man" in a major
new drive planned against Tanzanian invaders,
Radio Uganda said.
An unconfirmed report said hundreds of Libyan
and Moroccan troops had arrived to bolster
Amin's forces. But the Ugandan leader was dealt
two new blows — by the British, who cut off supply
flights from Britain, and by four fellow black Afri
can leader s who offered to help the Tanzanians.
The Ugandan broadcast, monitored here, called
on all citizens in the occupied areas to "evacuate
immediately before a major offensive is launched
to liberate Ugandan territory." There was no indi
cation when the drive might start.
It was reported yesterday that leaders of four
black African nations — Angola, Zambia, Mozam
bique and Botswana — have joined with Tanzania
in the "front-line" group of states that support
black nationalist movements in South Africa. The
nature of their potential support was not known.
The Tanzanians, backed by Ugandan exiles and
reportedly by dissident Ugandan soldiers, control
much of southwestern Uganda and kept up pres
sure yesterday on Lukaya, 52 miles from the Ugan
dan capital Kampala.
Convention opposed by Mondale
Washington — Vice President Walter Mondale
declared the Carter administration's vigorous op
position to a balanced-budget amendment yes
terday, saying the government needs flexibility in
order to manage a sometimes cantankerous
economy.
"Sometimes we need a deficit in order to stimu
late the national economy," Mondale said. "That's
whaf Franklin Delano Roosevelt did in the depths
of the Depression." He added that a surplus is
sometimes necessary to slow inflation.
Mondale's speech to the National League of
Cities was fhe administration's strongest argu
ment yet against a proposed amendment to force

Washington to balance its half-trillion-dollar
budget.
A leader of the budget-balancing movement,
Gov. Jerry Brown, is a likely challenger to Carter
should he seek a second Democratic nomination
for president and the administration hopes to stop
his charge before it gets started by blunting his
main issue.
Alan Greenspan, who was former President
Gerald Ford's main economic adviser, also op
posed the amendment, saying that even if it were
passed and workable, it would not be enough to
defuse inflationary pressures.
More gas price increases ahead
New York — Gasoline prices, which have risen
about two cents a gallon since Jan. 1, will continue
to go up sharply over the next few months —
especially if the government forces service sta
tions to close on weekends, analysts said yester
day.
"The key variables to me are the OPEC price,
which has yet to be determined, and the mar
ketplace," said Eugene Nowak, an oil industry
analyst at the Wall Street firm of Blyth Eastman
Dillon.
OPEC could decide when it meets later this
month to raise crude prices even more than the 3.9
percent increase scheduled April 1. Nowak, who
predicts a 10-cent-a-gallon rise in the price of
gasoline by the end of 1979, says he is more op
timistic than Energy Secretary James Schlesinger,
who said last week prices of unleaded gasoline
could top $1 a gallon a year or so from now, with
leaded regular up to 75 cents.
Dow Jones records sharp gain
Renewed hopes for a Middle East peace settle
ment helped touch off a broad rally in the stock
market yesterday, carrying the Dow Jones indust
rial average to its sharpest gain in seven weeks.
The Dow average of 30 blue chips jumped 11.61
to 827.36 in its best single-day showing since it
climbed 12.39 points on Jan. 15.
Volume on the Big Board reached 25.69 million
shares, up from 23.13 million Friday.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except patchy low
clouds or fog late night and morning. A little
warmer today. Lows in 40s to low 50s. Highs both
days mid 60s to mid 70s.

Gov. Jerry Brown, is a likely challenger to Carter
should he seek a second Democratic nomination
for president and the administration hopes to stop
his charge before it gets started by blunting his
main issue.
Alan Greenspan, who was former President
Gerald Ford's main economic adviser, also op

passed and workable, it would not be enough to
defuse inflationary pressures.
More gas price increases ahead
New York — Gasoline prices, which have risen
about two cents a gallon since Jan. 1, will continue
to go up sharply over the next few months —
especially if the government forces service sta
tions to close on weekends, analysts said yester
day.
"The key variables to me are the OPEC price,
which has yet to be determined, and the mar
ketplace," said Eugene Nowak, an oil industry
analyst at the Wall Street firm of Blyth Eastman
Dillon.
OPEC could decide when it meets later this
month to raise crude prices even more than the 3.9
percent increase scheduled April 1. Nowak, who
predicts a 10-cent-a-gallon rise in the price of
gasoline by the end of 1979, says he is more op
timistic than Energy Secretary James Schlesinger,
who said last week prices of unleaded gasoline
could top $1 a gallon a year or so from now, with
leaded regular up to 75 cents.

ment helped touch off a broad rally in the stock

rial average to its sharpest gain in seven weeks.

to 827.36 in its best single-day showing since it
climbed 12.39 points on Jan. 15.
Volume on the Big Board reached 25.69 million
shares, up from 23.13 million Friday.

Mideast leaders say treaty near
Washington — President |immy Carter, in a drive
to wrap up a Mideast peace treaty, will fly to Enypi
and Israel this week to try and clear awav remain
ing roadblocks to a settlement.
Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil said in
Cairo that Carter's trip "will most likely lead to a
signing."
And Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
noting that the Israeli cabinet has accepted U.S.
proposals for concluding a treaty, said "now there
is a ray of hope."
Addressing members of the U.S. Congress in
Washington, Begin added:
"Let us hope Egypt will join the effort. Then if
this happens, in a short period of time, we may
have the ceremony of signing."
While expressing optimism, Begin noted that a
Middle East peace seemed at hand several limes
previously but was not achieved.
"The world was happy and then came the disap
pointment," Begin said.
He stressed that Israel's concern has been that it
must be able to defend itself against other Arab
countries if the peace does not last.
The principal sticking point has been Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat's demand, backed by the
Carteradministration, that a timetable be included
in the treaty package for establishing Palestinian
self-rule on the West Bank of the ]ordan River and
in Gaza.
An informed source in Jerusalem said Israel
made some movement on the demand.
Shimon Peres, leader of the largest opposition
bloc, welcomed Carter's visit, but predicted
"weighty negotiations" over the plan for Palesti
nian self-rule in the occupied West Bank of lordan
and the Gaza Strip.
Iran resumes limited oil exports
Tehran, Iran — Iran started supplying the world's
hungry oil market for the first time in 10 weeks
yesterday with a shipment of crude oil bound for
japan.
Iran was the world's second largest oil exporter,
next to Saudi Arabia, before the year-long turmoil
that led to the downfall of Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi. The nation's 65,000 oil workers heeded
Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the shah's
religious opposition, and halted exports, thus
helping precipitate fhe collapse of the monarchy.
Yesterday's export consignment, the first since
Dec. 26, was reportedly purchased at about $20 a
barrel, a current price for oil purchased on a spot
basis, but well above the basic $13.35 price set by

the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries (OPEC) in December.
"The days when foreign tankers could come to
Iranian ports and load as much oil as they wanted,
under prices and conditions dictated by them, are
over," said Hassan Nazih, the new managing di
rector ot Iran's state-owned National Iranian Oil
Co. ' We will export only enough to meet our
financial needs."
Amin plans new counteroffensive
Nairobi, Kenya — Ugandan President Idi Amin
abandoned his cease-fire efforts yesterday and cal
led on his army to "fight to the last man" in a major
new drive planned against Tanzanian invaders,
Radio Uganda said.
An unconfirmed report said hundreds of Libyan
and Moroccan troops had arrived to bolster
Amin's forces. But the Ugandan leader was dealt
two new blows — by the British, who cut off supply
flights from Britain, and by four fellow black Afri
can leader s who offered to help the Tanzanians.
The Ugandan broadcast, monitored here, called
on all citizens in the occupied areas to "evacuate
immediately before a major offensive is launched
to liberate Ugandan territory." There was no indi
cation when the drive might start.
It was reported yesterday that leaders of four
black African nations — Angola, Zambia, Mozam
bique and Botswana — have joined with Tanzania
in the "front-line" group of states that support
black nationalist movements in South Africa. The
nature of their potential support was not known.
The Tanzanians, backed by Ugandan exiles and
reportedly by dissident Ugandan soldiers, control
much of southwestern Uganda and kept up pres
sure yesterday on Lukaya, 52 miles from the Ugan
dan capital Kampala.
Convention opposed by Mondale
Washington — Vice President Walter Mondale
declared the Carter administration's vigorous op
position to a balanced-budget amendment yes
terday, saying the government needs flexibility in
order to manage a sometimes cantankerous
economy.
"Sometimes we need a deficit in order to stimu
late the national economy," Mondale said. "That's
whaf Franklin Delano Roosevelt did in the depths
of the Depression." He added that a surplus is
sometimes necessary to slow inflation.
Mondale's speech to the National League of
Cities was fhe administration's strongest argu
ment yet against a proposed amendment to force

Washington to balance its half-trillion-dollar
budget.
A leader of the budget-balancing movement,
Gov. Jerry Brown, is a likely challenger to Carter
