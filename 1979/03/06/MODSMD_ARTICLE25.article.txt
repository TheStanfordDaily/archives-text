# Black America suffers economic depression
## 
### Robert Reed 
"Black America is in the throes of
economic depression," Robert Hill,
director of research for the National
Urban League, said. He spoke here
Saturday at a symposium on the state
of black America 1979.
"The gap between blacks and
whites is as wide as it's ever been,"
Hill said.
Hill's conclusions were drawn
from a report on the state of black
America in 1979 which the Urban
League submitted to President
Jimmy Carter. Hill said the report was
issued to Carter two weeks before
his last State of the Union address in
order to let him see the condition of
blacks in the United States before he
spoke on the condition of America as
a whole.
"Nowhere in the president's State
of the Union message did he reflect
the state of black America," Hill said.
He explained that Carter's address
fostered an image of relative
economic stability in America.
Unemployment
Though unemployment may seem
to be going down for whites, Hill
said, black unemployment is as bad
as, or worse than, it has ever been.
"Our estimates show that at least
one-fourth of the black population is
unemployed,'' said Hill, dismissing
more conservative government es
timates.
Rather than the 13 percent overall
unemployment rate for blacks that
government estimates show, Hill
claimed that the actual figure should
be at least double that. He also said
that rather than the listed 40 percent
unemployment rate for young
blacks, the actual figure is more like
60 to 65 percent.
Depression
Hill noted that the only time one
fourth of the nation's total popula
tion was unemployed was at the
height of the Great Depression.
"When whites are in recession, we
are in the deepest depths of depres
sion," Hill continued.
Though improvements for blacks
were made in the 19605, Hill said,
these same improvements have been

eroded in the 19705. Hill blamed the
Nixon administration for many of the
setbacks.
Though the gap between middle
class blacks and whites has been
supposedly declining in the past sev
eral years, the gap between middle
and lower-class blacks has been
steadily increasing.
Hill, however, called the idea of
the black middle class a myth. He
said, "If they (whites) can't get
enough blacks up into the middle
class, then they bring the middle
class down to blacks."
Hill found it strange that the term
"working class" has been disappear
ing just as the number of blacks in
the middle class has supposedly
been increasing.
Class terminology has been divi
sive among blacks, said Hill. He
maintained that this is what whites
want — a black house divided.
New terms, such as "structural un
employment" and the "black under
class," are being used now by
whites, Hill said, to create an idea
that there are "internal deficiencies
(among blacks) instead of external
barriers." Hill said that these terms
are used as an excuse for inaction
and discrimination.
"Part of our problem is that there
are other people outside pulling the
strings," Hill said. Hill expressed op
timism, however, that something
could be done.
Also speaking at the symposium
were Stanford professors St. Clair
Drake and Clayborne Carson. Robert
A. Hill of UCLA, spoke on various
strategies for black liberation.
Haleem Abdul Farrakhan, formerly
the national spokesman for the Na
tion of Islam (Black Muslims), spoke
on the social responsibilities of black
students and educators.
