# On-campus rush OKed

Sororities will be permitted to hold
rush on campus this year, Associate
Dean for Residential Education Nor
man Robinson announced yester
day.
The decision was made yesterday
after consultation with Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons.
The decision to allow an on
campus rush has no bearing on the
issue of official recognition for the
sororities, Robinson said. The prop
osals for recognition submitted by
the groups are still being reviewed
and no date has been set for a deci
sion, Robinson said.
"There were two main reasons"
for his decision to allow an on
campus rush, Robinson said. After
having spoken with many women
here, Robinson said he was con
vinced that "they really do want the
organizations (sororities) to comply
with University policies." He said the
issue of local control of sororities
was of "primary importance."
The second reason for the deci
sion, Robinson said, was "the good
fajth effort to find off-campus loca
tions for meetings" by the sororities.
He had thought off-campus sites

would be available, Robinson said,
but evidently that was not the case.
Lyons said he thought "this was a
way to encourage local autonomy.
Some sorority leadership said they
wanted to be less dependent on
alumnae."
Kappa Alpha Theta President Pam
Hutchcraft said she was happy with
the decision, but didn't feel that the
problems in arranging an off-campus
rush had been serious.
"Going through the problems of
rush was good for the girls. There's
more of a spirit of cohesiveness, not
competition," she said.
Caroline Caires, Pi Beta Phi rush
chairman, said she thought the
sororities had "made a genuine ef
fort to comply with University rules."
She said she felt that Robinson had
been favorably impressed with their
efforts to find off-campus locations.
Caires said she was glad that
Robinson decided to allow sororities
to rush on campus. "Meeting off
campus would cut down on mem
bership because of inconvenience,"
Caires said.
One of the University's concerns,
Caires said, is local autonomy. Yet by
making sororities rush off campus, it

was increasing dependence on
alumnae, Caires said.
"We hardly had enough cars for
the girls," she said. It was difficult to
have off-campus functions without
recruiting alumnae for assistance,
Caires added.
Another reason why the on
campus rush will be good, Caires
said, is that it will help the sororities
"get girls who might not otherwise
go through rush."
One of the stipulations of Robin
son's decision is that on-campus
rush be open to all students, Caires
said. While open functions such as
rotationals and open houses may be
held on campus, selective events
such as invitationals and preference
parties must be held off campus, ac
cording to Caires.
Rotationals are neutral meetings
where women come to a central loca
tion and take turns visiting each
sorority group to "get a feel for what
the groups are like," Caires said.
Open houses are similar to frater
nity open houses in that students
may come and go at their own lei
sure, Caires said.
Rush begins April 9 and continues
until April 24, according to Caires.
