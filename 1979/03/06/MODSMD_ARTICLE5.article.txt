# Couples fight fat, heart disease

Overweight couples are joining
forces to become "more healthy
human beings" in a new weight re
duction program here, according to
Dr. David Black, a post-doctoral fel
low with the University's Heart Dis
ease Prevention Program.
The program which now has 27
couples enrolled attempts to make
participants aware of why they over
eat and underexercise, Black said. By
doing this they also become aware of
how they can "rectify the situation,"
he said.
The goals of the program are to
help participants "lose weight that
seems related to cardiovascular
problems, make them more healthy
human beings and reduce the possi
bility of heart disease," Black said.
Two pounds per week
Participants are expected to lose
one to two pounds per week. They
are required to read sections of a
weight reduction text and

supplementary handouts each week,
Black said.
The program strives to make over
weight people aware of the impor
tance of exercise. "We encourage
them to do activities, but they don't
have to do jogging or calisthenics,"
Black said.
"Instead we ask them to do the
little things" such as parking further
away from a store and walking, using
the stairs rather than the escalator
and answering the phone which is
furthest away, Black said.
"We don't have a regime for the
couples to follow but we recom
mend that they eat foods from the
four food groups. There is nothing
hard and fast," said Black.
Low calorie food
The substitution of a low calorie
food for a high calorie food which
gives equivalent satisfaction is one of
the ways people can lower their
caloric intake, Black explained.
"We don't want people to have to
measure and weigh their foods. They

can't continue to eat this way over a
long period of time," Black
explained.
Black and his associates are in
terested in developing a home study
program that will reach larger num
bers. "There are 40 to 80 million
Americans who are overweight, and
only 20 million are doing something
about it. We want to teach more
people to do something," Black said.
Incentive
The couples in the program pay a
$100 fee. They also pay an additional
$75 which is returned to them pend
ing successful completion of the as
signments. "The money is incen
tive," said Kent Burnett who also
works with the program.
Black said that couples also "de
velop contracts with partners. . .(to)
boost motivation and commitment."
Carl Thorenson, professor of edu
cation and psychology and Dr. Craig
Ewart, another post-doctoral fellow
are the other two professional staff
members for the program.
