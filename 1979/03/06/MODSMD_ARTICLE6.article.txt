San Francisco — "It is my firm belief
that peace, harmony and prosperity
in the world are not necessarily
created by conferences of national
leaders and diplomats so much as
they are promoted by day by day con
tacts and commerce among the

people and institutions of nations,"
Armand Hammer, chairman of the
board of the Occidental Petroleum
Corp., told a meeting of the Com
monwealth Club of California Friday.
Hammer cited statistics that
showed how the United States relies
upon "a growing world economy

and a healthy trading and investment
climate." He noted that one-eighth
of the country's manufacturing jobs
are dependent on exports and for
each of those jobs another is pro
vided in a "supporting industry."
Hammer also pointed out that ex
ports comprise "one of the fastest
growing sectors of our economy,"
accounting for sales increases in 42
states from 1972 to 1976 which sur
passed domestic sales in those
states. In addition, a fourth of U.S
farmland provides export products
and one-third of "(American) corpo
rate profits is derived from interna
tional activities."
Hammer's initiation into the busi
ness world came while he was a
pre-medical student at Columbia
University. He took over his father's
nearly insolvent pharmaceutical firm
and with an apparent "flair for busi
ness" as he phrased it, he managed
to turn the company around. It was
worth a "few million dollars" by the
time Hammer graduated at age 23.
In June 1921, between graduation
and the start of a medical research
internship, he learned of a famine in
Russia. He bought all the equipment
from a World War I field hospital and
set up a hospital in the Ural Moun
tains to help fight typhus there, he
said.

Realizing that the shortage of food
was a more serious problem than
disease, he arranged to have a mill
ion bushels of wheat imported to the
Soviet Union on credit. The govern
ment had had difficulty making the
necessary arrangements, he said.
Having gained renown for his
deed, Hammer was invited to meet
with Lenin and became the first
foreign concessionaire in the Soviet
Union, eventually handling the busi
ness of 37 companies. Hammer's po
tential medical career took a back
seat to his budding role in interna
tional trade, he said.
Lenin told Hammer, "The U.S. and
Russia are complimentary. We have
enormous undeveloped resources.
The U.S. can find here raw materials
and the market for machines."
"Russia needs American
techniques and methods," Hammer
said.
"Lenin's words were prophetic,
and they still ring true today when we
consider East-West trade and de
tente. . . . Each of us (Russia and the
U.S.) has something to offer the
other. That's what good business,
fair trade, and ultimately detente are
all about," he explained.
Hammer took over Occidental 23
years ago when the total company
market value was $100,000and shares
were 18 cents apiece. A project

which originally began as a tax
write-off project resulted in the dis
covery of the second largest natural
gas field in California — worth $120
million — on the second drilling at
tempt, Hammer said.
Occidental's shares on the New
York Stock Exchange are now worth
$1 '/a billion, making it the 27th largest
corporation in the nation, he said.
He described food and energy as
"two of the world's major concerns
over the next 20 years."
Occidental is now involved in a $20
billion fertilizer agreement with the
Soviets, trading superphosphoric
acid to Russia in exchange for natural
gas, ammonia, urea and potash, he
said.
Elaborating on the importance of
energy, Hammer added that Occi
dental is pioneering the develop
ment of oil shale. He advocated the
deregulation of petroleum prices
that would allow market forces of
supply and demand to control the
prices.
Hammer also encouraged tax cre
dits to provide incentives for in
creased coal production, so the U.S.
won't have to rely upon trade
deficit-producing OPEC oil. He also
supported the negotiations for Mex
ican oil and expressed hope that a
sound national energy policy will re
sult from the Iranian crisis.

internship, he learned of a famine in
Russia. He bought all the equipment
from a World War I field hospital and
set up a hospital in the Ural Moun
tains to help fight typhus there, he
said.

Realizing that the shortage of food
was a more serious problem than
disease, he arranged to have a mill
ion bushels of wheat imported to the
Soviet Union on credit. The govern
ment had had difficulty making the
necessary arrangements, he said.
Having gained renown for his
deed, Hammer was invited to meet
with Lenin and became the first
foreign concessionaire in the Soviet
Union, eventually handling the busi
ness of 37 companies. Hammer's po
tential medical career took a back
seat to his budding role in interna
tional trade, he said.
Lenin told Hammer, "The U.S. and
Russia are complimentary. We have
enormous undeveloped resources.
The U.S. can find here raw materials
and the market for machines."
"Russia needs American
techniques and methods," Hammer
said.
"Lenin's words were prophetic,
and they still ring true today when we
consider East-West trade and de
tente. . . . Each of us (Russia and the
U.S.) has something to offer the
other. That's what good business,
fair trade, and ultimately detente are
all about," he explained.
Hammer took over Occidental 23
years ago when the total company
market value was $100,000and shares
were 18 cents apiece. A project

which originally began as a tax
write-off project resulted in the dis
covery of the second largest natural
gas field in California — worth $120
million — on the second drilling at
tempt, Hammer said.
Occidental's shares on the New
York Stock Exchange are now worth
$1 '/a billion, making it the 27th largest
corporation in the nation, he said.
He described food and energy as
"two of the world's major concerns
over the next 20 years."
Occidental is now involved in a $20
billion fertilizer agreement with the
Soviets, trading superphosphoric
acid to Russia in exchange for natural
gas, ammonia, urea and potash, he
said.
Elaborating on the importance of
energy, Hammer added that Occi
dental is pioneering the develop
ment of oil shale. He advocated the
deregulation of petroleum prices
that would allow market forces of
supply and demand to control the
prices.
Hammer also encouraged tax cre
dits to provide incentives for in
creased coal production, so the U.S.
won't have to rely upon trade
deficit-producing OPEC oil. He also
supported the negotiations for Mex
ican oil and expressed hope that a
sound national energy policy will re
sult from the Iranian crisis.

San Francisco — "It is my firm belief
that peace, harmony and prosperity
in the world are not necessarily
created by conferences of national
leaders and diplomats so much as
they are promoted by day by day con
tacts and commerce among the

people and institutions of nations,"
Armand Hammer, chairman of the
board of the Occidental Petroleum
Corp., told a meeting of the Com
monwealth Club of California Friday.
Hammer cited statistics that
showed how the United States relies
upon "a growing world economy

and a healthy trading and investment
climate." He noted that one-eighth
of the country's manufacturing jobs
are dependent on exports and for
each of those jobs another is pro
vided in a "supporting industry."
Hammer also pointed out that ex
ports comprise "one of the fastest
growing sectors of our economy,"
accounting for sales increases in 42
states from 1972 to 1976 which sur
passed domestic sales in those
states. In addition, a fourth of U.S
farmland provides export products
and one-third of "(American) corpo
rate profits is derived from interna
tional activities."
Hammer's initiation into the busi
ness world came while he was a
pre-medical student at Columbia
University. He took over his father's
nearly insolvent pharmaceutical firm
and with an apparent "flair for busi
ness" as he phrased it, he managed
to turn the company around. It was
worth a "few million dollars" by the
time Hammer graduated at age 23.
In June 1921, between graduation
and the start of a medical research
internship, he learned of a famine in
Russia. He bought all the equipment
from a World War I field hospital and
set up a hospital in the Ural Moun
tains to help fight typhus there, he
said.

Realizing that the shortage of food
was a more serious problem than
disease, he arranged to have a mill
ion bushels of wheat imported to the
Soviet Union on credit. The govern
ment had had difficulty making the
