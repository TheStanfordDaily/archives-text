# Studying abroad less popular in late '60s
## 
### Karen Eustis Second of three parts 
In the late '60s and early '70s
attendance at the overseas
campuses hit an all-time low
with many of the programs
operating at less than 70 per
cent capacity. Administrators
and students differed in their
explanation of the decline.
"The students felt that they
had to stay on campus to be
close to the action," Robert
Walker, then director of over
seas campuses, said. "The
overseas experience was sidet
racked by the political hoopla

of the day."
Walker also cited the aboli
tion of the Western Civilization
requirement as "one of the
greatest blows in maintaining
the interest in overseas prog
rams. The students ceased to
have the same appreciation of
what seeing Europe really
meant."
Students arrested
Several students were ar
rested on drug charges and
spent time in European jails.
"We couldn't be as lax with
students as in California or else
the European police would

take our permits away,"
Walker explained. This strict
discipline caused friction bet
ween students and adminis
trators.
Most student complaints,
however, centered on the "in
flexibility" of the programs.
Students wanted an expansion
of local interest courses that
took advantage of the special
geographic location, a role in
choosing "qualified" faculty
and an increased coordination
of course work and extracur
ricular activities.
In 1973, a special University
presidential commission ap
pointed to study the overseas
situation concluded that the
foreign study programs "that
were designed for and were
successful in an earlier period
now seem unsatisfactory. De
clining student interest,
mounting student dissatisfac
tion and increasingly profound
criticisms by faculty on
academic grounds (reflects
that) the world has changed,
Stanford has changed, Stan
ford students have changed."
The Commission stressed
that the programs should be
renovated on a foundation of
"the highest intellectual and
academic standards."
Budget cut
In addition to major organi
zational questions, the over
seas program was faced with
the task of cutting their $1.6
million budget in half by 1978-
1979 as part of the 1974-1975
budget equilibrium process.
"Though all University de
partments were forced to cut
back, our program was hit the
most severely," said Associate
Director for Financial Affairs
Pat Clark.
Summer sessions, field trips
and office staff were cut, fewer

faculty were sent overseas to
teach and the Beutelsbach
campus was closed. Because of
financial restrictions, only 14
faculty quarters per year and
900 student quarters were feas
ible, compared to the respec
tive 40 and 1900 in the '60s.
With respect to the de
creased number of Stanford
faculty, "what began as a fi
nancial necessity we later
adopted on a philosophical
basis," said Mark Mancall, as
sociate professor of history
and director of Overseas
Studies. "Good local faculty
were available, and we feel it's
advantageous to the student to
study with faculty he couldn't
study with at home."
"There was a definite em
phasis in not isolating a group
of American students, but in
involving them with the daily
life of the host culture," said
Assoc. Director of Overseas
Studies Corb Smith. "The
change in attitude was re
flected in the semantic
changes: overseas campuses
became overseas centers."
In the late '60s students
began living in local dor
mitories throughout Vienna
and in 1975 Berlin began with
the hybrid approach of some
students living together in the
villa and others in apartments
or dormitories. This also be
came the case in Tours. Stu
dents were encouraged to take
classes at the local universities
if their language skills were suf
ficient.
Despite student criticisms of
isolation, Cliveden and Flor
ence remain campuses of the
old style, with all students liv
ing and taking classes in the
same building.
"Philosophically, we'd like
to have more programs like

Vienna, Berlin or Tours," Smith
said. "But in England and Italy
they don't have the dormitory
system, or if they do, the pres
sure is so great that there's no
room for American students.
We looked at moving Cliveden
to London or Oxford for exam
ple, and we figured that for the
same amount of money we
could accommodate about half
as many students.
"We feel the trade-off is too
great," Smith concluded.
A general tightening of
academic standards also oc
curred in the early '70s with the
reinstatement of five days of
classes per week. "We want
students to return with a solid
intellectual experience," Man
call said. "These programs are
not a vacation."
The programs are still
criticized for being academi
cally lax, and a number of stu
dents tend to agree. Mancall
said he believes the students

themselves turn it into some
thing easier. "It's a function of
the excitement of living in
Europe. What isn't easier
seems easier because it's more
fun," he said.
"The style of learning is dif
ferent," Smith said. "The at
tempt to relate the overseas
academics to the home cam
pus makes them seem easier
because there is more integra
tion of the classroom and the
environment. The study time
and 'me' time is not so split up.
"If we only wanted students
to return with 'broadened
horizons' and no intellectual
background, we'd just conduct
grand tours abroad," he ad
ded.
"The centers shouldn't be a
basis for tourism," said Walter
Vincenti, professor of
aeronautics and astronautics.
"We're not in business for
that."
Often, professors say,

course work can bring the stu
dents into close contact with
the local people of the com
munity.
"The juxtaposition of course
work and travel is really artifi
cal when the course work in
tertwines with the country,"
said Kurt Steiner, professor
emeritus of political science,
echoing many of his col
leagues' opinions. "When you
know something about a coun
try, its culture and history, you
can have more meaningful
conversations with the people
you meet.
"The trick is to make the
academic offerings relevant to
help the student take full ad
vantage of the education ex
perience of being overseas,"
summarized David Kennedy,
associate professor of history
and chairman of the under
graduate program in interna
tional relations.

change in attitude was re
flected in the semantic
changes: overseas campuses
became overseas centers."
In the late '60s students
began living in local dor
mitories throughout Vienna
and in 1975 Berlin began with
the hybrid approach of some
students living together in the
villa and others in apartments
or dormitories. This also be
came the case in Tours. Stu
dents were encouraged to take
classes at the local universities
if their language skills were suf
ficient.
Despite student criticisms of
isolation, Cliveden and Flor
ence remain campuses of the
old style, with all students liv
ing and taking classes in the
same building.
"Philosophically, we'd like
to have more programs like

Vienna, Berlin or Tours," Smith
said. "But in England and Italy
they don't have the dormitory
system, or if they do, the pres
sure is so great that there's no
room for American students.
We looked at moving Cliveden
to London or Oxford for exam
ple, and we figured that for the
same amount of money we
could accommodate about half
as many students.
"We feel the trade-off is too
great," Smith concluded.
A general tightening of
academic standards also oc
curred in the early '70s with the
reinstatement of five days of
classes per week. "We want
students to return with a solid
intellectual experience," Man
call said. "These programs are
not a vacation."
The programs are still
criticized for being academi
cally lax, and a number of stu
dents tend to agree. Mancall
said he believes the students

themselves turn it into some
thing easier. "It's a function of
the excitement of living in
Europe. What isn't easier
seems easier because it's more
fun," he said.
"The style of learning is dif
ferent," Smith said. "The at
tempt to relate the overseas
academics to the home cam
pus makes them seem easier
because there is more integra
tion of the classroom and the
environment. The study time
and 'me' time is not so split up.
"If we only wanted students
to return with 'broadened
horizons' and no intellectual
background, we'd just conduct
grand tours abroad," he ad
ded.
"The centers shouldn't be a
basis for tourism," said Walter
Vincenti, professor of
aeronautics and astronautics.
"We're not in business for
that."
Often, professors say,

course work can bring the stu
dents into close contact with
the local people of the com
munity.
"The juxtaposition of course
work and travel is really artifi
cal when the course work in
tertwines with the country,"
said Kurt Steiner, professor
emeritus of political science,
echoing many of his col
leagues' opinions. "When you
know something about a coun
try, its culture and history, you
can have more meaningful
conversations with the people
you meet.
"The trick is to make the
academic offerings relevant to
help the student take full ad
vantage of the education ex
perience of being overseas,"
summarized David Kennedy,
associate professor of history
and chairman of the under

center is located on Karl Luegerplatz in central Vienna.

The University's first overseas campus was opened in Beutelsbach, Germany in 1958. Twelve miles south
of Stuttgart, the center was closed two years ago because of a major cut in the overseas studies budget.
In the late '60s and early '70s
attendance at the overseas
campuses hit an all-time low
with many of the programs
operating at less than 70 per
cent capacity. Administrators
and students differed in their
explanation of the decline.
"The students felt that they
had to stay on campus to be
close to the action," Robert
Walker, then director of over
seas campuses, said. "The
overseas experience was sidet
racked by the political hoopla

of the day."
Walker also cited the aboli
tion of the Western Civilization
requirement as "one of the
greatest blows in maintaining
the interest in overseas prog
rams. The students ceased to
have the same appreciation of
what seeing Europe really
meant."
Students arrested
Several students were ar
rested on drug charges and
spent time in European jails.
"We couldn't be as lax with
students as in California or else
the European police would

take our permits away,"
Walker explained. This strict
discipline caused friction bet
ween students and adminis
trators.
Most student complaints,
however, centered on the "in
flexibility" of the programs.
Students wanted an expansion
of local interest courses that
took advantage of the special
geographic location, a role in
choosing "qualified" faculty
and an increased coordination
of course work and extracur
ricular activities.
In 1973, a special University
presidential commission ap
pointed to study the overseas
situation concluded that the
foreign study programs "that
were designed for and were
successful in an earlier period
now seem unsatisfactory. De
clining student interest,
mounting student dissatisfac
tion and increasingly profound
criticisms by faculty on
academic grounds (reflects
that) the world has changed,
Stanford has changed, Stan
ford students have changed."
The Commission stressed
that the programs should be
renovated on a foundation of
"the highest intellectual and
academic standards."
Budget cut
In addition to major organi
zational questions, the over
seas program was faced with
the task of cutting their $1.6
million budget in half by 1978-
1979 as part of the 1974-1975
budget equilibrium process.
"Though all University de
partments were forced to cut
back, our program was hit the
most severely," said Associate
Director for Financial Affairs
Pat Clark.
Summer sessions, field trips
and office staff were cut, fewer

faculty were sent overseas to
teach and the Beutelsbach
campus was closed. Because of
financial restrictions, only 14
faculty quarters per year and
900 student quarters were feas
ible, compared to the respec
tive 40 and 1900 in the '60s.
With respect to the de
creased number of Stanford
faculty, "what began as a fi
nancial necessity we later
adopted on a philosophical
basis," said Mark Mancall, as
sociate professor of history
and director of Overseas
Studies. "Good local faculty
were available, and we feel it's
advantageous to the student to
study with faculty he couldn't
study with at home."
"There was a definite em
phasis in not isolating a group
of American students, but in
involving them with the daily
life of the host culture," said
Assoc. Director of Overseas
Studies Corb Smith. "The
