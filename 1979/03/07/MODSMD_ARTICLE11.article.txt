## Vladislav Krasnov Challenges for Khomeini 
### 
On the surface, the whirlwind of recent
events in Iran ended triumphantly for Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini. However, beneath the sur
face of his triumph there is a challenge in the
offing, compared to which his toppling of
former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakht
iar's government may seem a trifle.
One columnist compared Khomeini's victory
over Bakhtiar to that of Vladimir Lenin over Ale
xander Kerensky's provisional government after
the fall of the Russian monarchy. Rather, Kho
meini's present triumph reminds me of Mujibur
Rakhman who had presided over the birth of the
Bangladesh nation in 1971 only to be over
thrown and murdered in 1975. It is also analog
ous to the case of President Muhammad Daoud,
a devout Muslim, who otherthrew the Afghanis
tan monarchy and installed a republic in 1973
only to be overthrown and murdered in 1978 by
the Khalq Communists who now control the
country.
By toppling the Bakhtiar government, Kho
meini unwittingly strengthened new forces
which will inevitably challenge his Islamic Re
public. Like the magician in a Muslim legend,
Khomeini released from the broken jar of the
monarchy forces which are now beyond his con
trol and which may well destroy him.
These forces are those who attacked the
American embassy in defiance of Khomeini's
orders, caused the bloody fighting northwest of
Tabriz, ignored his appeals to return weapons
looted from armories, and rendered him incap
able of protecting foreign nationals.
They are the Moscow-line Tudeh Communists
who turned out to be much stronger than our
press had been willing to admit; the Marxist-
Leninist Fedayeen whom we saw on television
riding a captured tank and displaying the red
star and the hammer-and-sickle, and the 8000
men strong Saihkal Marxist Croup. They are
women, and perhaps some men, who wear the
black chador not out of Muslim piety but to hide
machine guns and Molotov cocktails. In short,
they are leftists and atheists who outran the mul
lahs in arming themselves.
As the U.S. State Department had to admit,
recent events "forced us to examine a lot of
unseen forces that bubbled below the surface in
the Middle East." High on the list of the "unseen
forces" must be those inspired by the Soviet
radio broadcasts into the area, aimed at instigat
ing and fanning anti-American hatred.
Having previously denied Soviet complicity in
the efforts to destabilize Iran, the State Depart
ment was finally moved to lodge a protest
against such broadcasts. The concurrent killing
of Adolph Dubs, American ambassador to Af

ghanistan, was a further reminder that the
events in Iran cannot be understood without
taking stock of Soviet penetration of the area.
Ironically, the ambassador was killed while
kidnapped by the Shiite Muslims who are fight
ing for survival under Afghanistan's Marxist re
gime. The irony here is in the question which
Khomeini must now face: can an Islamic repub
lic succeed in Iran when it so miserably failed in
Afghanistan? Although the majority of Afghans
are Sunni Muslims, Khomeini can hardly pro
ceed with his program in Iran without being
concerned for the fate of his Muslim next door.
As Robert Moss of the Institute for the Study
of Conflict (London) pointed out, nearly half a
million Afghani citizens live illegally in Iran,
many of them engaging in subversion on behalf
of the Soviets. He also found evidence of KGB
penetration of Iran's army and intelligence and
cited subversion by Iranians trained in Cuba.
In addition to Soviet penetration in Afghanis
tan, huge chunks of Iran may be viewed as a
natural extension of the Soviet "republics" of
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. In
these "republics" the Soviets have gained ex
tensive experience in using nationalist and re
ligious sentiments to their advantage: first, by
instigating local nationalists, including Shiites,
against the czar, then, once the nationalists
proclaimed their independence, by overthrow
ing them with the help of the fifth column. This
time, they may well try to exploit the nationalism
of Iran's ethnic minorities: Kurds, Azerbaijanis,
Armenians, Turkmens and Baluchis.
The Soviets also occupied the Tabriz region of
Iran between 1941 and 1946. They withdrew
their forces only after energetic demands from
the West, substantiated by U.S. strategic
superiority and the verve of a bygone era. Cer
tainly it would not be as easy for Iran to extricate
itself from the hug of the northern bear as it was
for Egypt and Somalia.
This suggests the direction Khomeini must
now promptly take if he is to avoid the fate of
Afghanistan's Daoud. He must move toward a
reconciliation not only with all the moderate
and conservative Muslims whom he needlessly
antagonized with the overthrow of Bakhtiar but
also with the United States and its allies. To
succeed, both he and the LJnited States have to
exhibit a greater amount of statecraft and re
solve.

Khomeini released from the broken jar of the
monarchy forces which are now beyond his con
trol and which may well destroy him.
These forces are those who attacked the
American embassy in defiance of Khomeini's
orders, caused the bloody fighting northwest of
Tabriz, ignored his appeals to return weapons
looted from armories, and rendered him incap
able of protecting foreign nationals.
They are the Moscow-line Tudeh Communists
who turned out to be much stronger than our
press had been willing to admit; the Marxist-
Leninist Fedayeen whom we saw on television
riding a captured tank and displaying the red
star and the hammer-and-sickle, and the 8000
men strong Saihkal Marxist Croup. They are
women, and perhaps some men, who wear the
black chador not out of Muslim piety but to hide
machine guns and Molotov cocktails. In short,
they are leftists and atheists who outran the mul
lahs in arming themselves.
As the U.S. State Department had to admit,
recent events "forced us to examine a lot of
unseen forces that bubbled below the surface in
the Middle East." High on the list of the "unseen
forces" must be those inspired by the Soviet
radio broadcasts into the area, aimed at instigat
ing and fanning anti-American hatred.
Having previously denied Soviet complicity in
the efforts to destabilize Iran, the State Depart
ment was finally moved to lodge a protest
against such broadcasts. The concurrent killing
of Adolph Dubs, American ambassador to Af

ghanistan, was a further reminder that the
events in Iran cannot be understood without
taking stock of Soviet penetration of the area.
Ironically, the ambassador was killed while
kidnapped by the Shiite Muslims who are fight
ing for survival under Afghanistan's Marxist re
gime. The irony here is in the question which
Khomeini must now face: can an Islamic repub
lic succeed in Iran when it so miserably failed in
Afghanistan? Although the majority of Afghans
are Sunni Muslims, Khomeini can hardly pro
ceed with his program in Iran without being
concerned for the fate of his Muslim next door.
As Robert Moss of the Institute for the Study
of Conflict (London) pointed out, nearly half a
million Afghani citizens live illegally in Iran,
many of them engaging in subversion on behalf
of the Soviets. He also found evidence of KGB
penetration of Iran's army and intelligence and
cited subversion by Iranians trained in Cuba.
In addition to Soviet penetration in Afghanis
tan, huge chunks of Iran may be viewed as a
natural extension of the Soviet "republics" of
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. In
these "republics" the Soviets have gained ex
tensive experience in using nationalist and re
ligious sentiments to their advantage: first, by
instigating local nationalists, including Shiites,
against the czar, then, once the nationalists
proclaimed their independence, by overthrow
ing them with the help of the fifth column. This
time, they may well try to exploit the nationalism
of Iran's ethnic minorities: Kurds, Azerbaijanis,
Armenians, Turkmens and Baluchis.
The Soviets also occupied the Tabriz region of
Iran between 1941 and 1946. They withdrew
their forces only after energetic demands from
the West, substantiated by U.S. strategic
superiority and the verve of a bygone era. Cer
tainly it would not be as easy for Iran to extricate
itself from the hug of the northern bear as it was
for Egypt and Somalia.
This suggests the direction Khomeini must
now promptly take if he is to avoid the fate of
Afghanistan's Daoud. He must move toward a
reconciliation not only with all the moderate
and conservative Muslims whom he needlessly
antagonized with the overthrow of Bakhtiar but
also with the United States and its allies. To
succeed, both he and the LJnited States have to
exhibit a greater amount of statecraft and re
solve.

On the surface, the whirlwind of recent
events in Iran ended triumphantly for Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini. However, beneath the sur
face of his triumph there is a challenge in the
offing, compared to which his toppling of
former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakht
iar's government may seem a trifle.
One columnist compared Khomeini's victory
over Bakhtiar to that of Vladimir Lenin over Ale
xander Kerensky's provisional government after
the fall of the Russian monarchy. Rather, Kho
meini's present triumph reminds me of Mujibur
Rakhman who had presided over the birth of the
Bangladesh nation in 1971 only to be over
thrown and murdered in 1975. It is also analog
ous to the case of President Muhammad Daoud,
a devout Muslim, who otherthrew the Afghanis
tan monarchy and installed a republic in 1973
only to be overthrown and murdered in 1978 by
the Khalq Communists who now control the
country.
By toppling the Bakhtiar government, Kho
meini unwittingly strengthened new forces
which will inevitably challenge his Islamic Re
public. Like the magician in a Muslim legend,
