Soviet press differs
After reading the Feb. 28
editorial urging attendance at
the Shcharansky rally, attend
ing that rally myself, and seeing
the March 1 page one Daily
story, I was moved to more
deeply investigate the charges
made against this man by
Soviet authorities. What I dis
covered raised more questions
than answers.
First, I checked the press of
the Soviet Union. There, I
found a discrepancy with what
I had read in the editorial. Ac
cording to the Daily
Shcharansky, "is now serving
the first year of a 13-year sen
tence at hard labor for the
'crime' of anti-Soviet prop
aganda." But a Pravda article
appearing on July 19,1978 con
tained the following informa
tion about Shcharansky and a
Filatov, another man who was
on trial at the same time.
Both "were accused of
crimes covered by Article 64,
Paragraph A of the Russian Re
public Criminal Code, i.e., of
high treason and espion
age. . and that,
"(Shcharansky was also ac
cused under Article 70, of
Anti-Soviet Propaganda and
Filatov of smuggling)." (Cur
rent Digest of the Soviet Press
Vol. XXX, No. 28) Apparently,
Shcharansky was on trial and
eventually found guilty of
more than Catch 22, i.e. anti-
Soviet propaganda. He was
also convicted for spying.
But then, at the rally, didn't
Avital Shcharansky imply that
her husband was completely
innocent? Didn't she cite the
fact that our president had de
nied that her husband had had
any contact with the CIA?
As I paged through the
Readers' Guide to Periodical
Literature, I came upon an arti
cle that appeared in the July 24
issue of Newsweek which
seemed to contradict Mrs.
Shcharansky's view.
According to this story,
Shcharansky had supplied a
Moscow-based Los Angeles
Times reporter, Robert Toth,
"the names of secret Soviet de
fense plants and research insti
tutes masquerading as civilian
establishments." This informa
tion corresponded with an Is
vestia story reprinted in the
above-quoted Current Digest
of the Soviet Press:
"Personally and through his

accomplices, Shcharansky col
lected secret information on
the location and departmental
affiliation of defense industry
enterprises . . . In order to ob
tain this information, he inter
rogated many people, using
questions he had been sent
from abroad. Needless to say,
those who answered these
questions had no idea how all
this information was going to
be used."
Further, it should be noted
that an unnamed U.S. official
told Newsweek that, "What
Shcharansky did, in effect, was
give Toth a list of secret de
fense plants." One State De
partment official admitted in
this same issue of Newsweek
that, "in Soviet eyes
Shcharansky is guilty as hell."
The Newsweek reporter
went on to describe Toth's re
lation to U.S. military intelli
gence, specifically the Defense
Intelligence Agency, and how
persons connected with the
agency had praised him for the
information that he had been
passing to them while in Mos
cow. Toth was later expelled
from the USSR for such ac
tivities.
One final footnote to this sad
affair, I found that during the
course of his trial, Filatov like
Shcharansky had also been
convicted of spying, "a
charge," wrote Newsweek
"unofficially confirmed by
sources in Washington."
Filatov was shot.
Perhaps, some of the ques
tions raised by the apparent
contradictions between at least
the Newsweek article and the
current state of the news could
be answered in future Daily
columns.

Tante Amalie
We have established the
Tante Amalie Memorial
Museum Fund in honor of our
dear friend Tante Amalie, who
died last week in sentence 16 of
the Unit 10 translation exer
cises.
We wanted to do something
to assuage our grief and
thought this the most fitting
memorial, since Tante Amalie
in her lifetime brought more
people to the museum than
King Tut.
All friends of Tante Amalie
are invited to send contribu

tions of 25 cents or more in her
name to the Stanford Museum.
Thf funds will be used exclu
sively for new acquisitions.

Senate elitist
I was appalled by the Daily
article, "Senate approves
Ellsberg as spring guest prof"
and profoundly upset by the
quality of the discussion that
apparently took place in the
ASSU Senate, both of which
can most kindly be charac
terized as elitist.
The central question in this
issue is not who either of these
men were before they made
their respective acts of consci
ence, but after. That they chose
to act in a manner contrary to
law (but in accordance with
their dictates of conscience) is
that which distinguishes both
of these men. These are acts
that qualify them to teach the
vast majority of students here a
great deal.
The fact that Ellsberg has a
Ph.D. from Harvard is to his
credit. But a doctorate in
economics from Harvard or
Hodunk State would not qual
ify him to teach foreign policy
and nuclear armaments at any
rate. My suspicion is that if
John Steinbeck or Emily Dic
kinson were alive and prop
osed guest professors, the se
nate would not be arguing
questions of academic qualifi
cation even though neither re
ceived a bachelor's degree.
In addition to the problem of
sloppy thinking in failure to
pose the salient questions,
there were significant factual
inaccuracies in the debate.
Thompson's statement, . .
Banks was convicted in South
Dakota on charges of riot, riot
while armed and assault with a
deadly weapon," reeks of in
flammatory demagoguery.
Banks was both unarmed and
has never been convicted.
When this portrayal of Banks
is added to others in the article
and contrasted with the depic
tion of Ellsberg (including
those above), I must conclude
that either the senators in
volved or the reporters or both
are guilty of more than elitism,
but rather of unabashed racist
innuendo. I seriously doubt
the senators would similarly

asperse the qualifications of
Henry David Thoreau, and
malign his moral fitness be
cause of the time he spent in
jail based on his acts of consci
ence.
I am dismayed that arrogant
pedants in the senate and/or ir
responsible reporters are tak
ing us deeper into the morass
of bigotry and moral condes
cension rather than leading us
out of it.

Senate elitist
I was appalled by the Daily
article, "Senate approves
Ellsberg as spring guest prof"
and profoundly upset by the
quality of the discussion that
apparently took place in the
ASSU Senate, both of which
can most kindly be charac
terized as elitist.
The central question in this
issue is not who either of these
men were before they made
their respective acts of consci
ence, but after. That they chose
to act in a manner contrary to
law (but in accordance with
their dictates of conscience) is
that which distinguishes both
of these men. These are acts
that qualify them to teach the
vast majority of students here a
great deal.
The fact that Ellsberg has a
Ph.D. from Harvard is to his
credit. But a doctorate in
economics from Harvard or
Hodunk State would not qual
ify him to teach foreign policy
and nuclear armaments at any
rate. My suspicion is that if
John Steinbeck or Emily Dic
kinson were alive and prop
osed guest professors, the se
nate would not be arguing
questions of academic qualifi
cation even though neither re
ceived a bachelor's degree.
In addition to the problem of
sloppy thinking in failure to
pose the salient questions,
there were significant factual
inaccuracies in the debate.
Thompson's statement, . .
Banks was convicted in South
Dakota on charges of riot, riot
while armed and assault with a
deadly weapon," reeks of in
flammatory demagoguery.
Banks was both unarmed and
has never been convicted.
When this portrayal of Banks
is added to others in the article
and contrasted with the depic
tion of Ellsberg (including
those above), I must conclude
that either the senators in
volved or the reporters or both
are guilty of more than elitism,
but rather of unabashed racist
innuendo. I seriously doubt
the senators would similarly

asperse the qualifications of
Henry David Thoreau, and
malign his moral fitness be
cause of the time he spent in
jail based on his acts of consci
ence.
I am dismayed that arrogant
pedants in the senate and/or ir
responsible reporters are tak
ing us deeper into the morass
of bigotry and moral condes
cension rather than leading us
out of it.

Soviet press differs
After reading the Feb. 28
editorial urging attendance at
the Shcharansky rally, attend
ing that rally myself, and seeing
the March 1 page one Daily
story, I was moved to more
deeply investigate the charges
made against this man by
Soviet authorities. What I dis
covered raised more questions
than answers.
First, I checked the press of
the Soviet Union. There, I
found a discrepancy with what
I had read in the editorial. Ac
cording to the Daily
Shcharansky, "is now serving
the first year of a 13-year sen
tence at hard labor for the
'crime' of anti-Soviet prop
aganda." But a Pravda article
appearing on July 19,1978 con
tained the following informa
tion about Shcharansky and a
Filatov, another man who was
on trial at the same time.
Both "were accused of
crimes covered by Article 64,
Paragraph A of the Russian Re
public Criminal Code, i.e., of
high treason and espion
age. . and that,
"(Shcharansky was also ac
cused under Article 70, of
Anti-Soviet Propaganda and
Filatov of smuggling)." (Cur
rent Digest of the Soviet Press
Vol. XXX, No. 28) Apparently,
Shcharansky was on trial and
eventually found guilty of
more than Catch 22, i.e. anti-
Soviet propaganda. He was
also convicted for spying.
But then, at the rally, didn't
Avital Shcharansky imply that
her husband was completely
innocent? Didn't she cite the
fact that our president had de
nied that her husband had had
any contact with the CIA?
As I paged through the
Readers' Guide to Periodical
Literature, I came upon an arti
cle that appeared in the July 24
issue of Newsweek which
seemed to contradict Mrs.
Shcharansky's view.
According to this story,
Shcharansky had supplied a
Moscow-based Los Angeles
Times reporter, Robert Toth,
"the names of secret Soviet de
fense plants and research insti
tutes masquerading as civilian
establishments." This informa
tion corresponded with an Is
vestia story reprinted in the
above-quoted Current Digest
of the Soviet Press:
"Personally and through his

accomplices, Shcharansky col
lected secret information on
the location and departmental
affiliation of defense industry
enterprises . . . In order to ob
tain this information, he inter
rogated many people, using
questions he had been sent
from abroad. Needless to say,
those who answered these
questions had no idea how all
this information was going to
be used."
Further, it should be noted
that an unnamed U.S. official
told Newsweek that, "What
Shcharansky did, in effect, was
give Toth a list of secret de
fense plants." One State De
partment official admitted in
this same issue of Newsweek
that, "in Soviet eyes
Shcharansky is guilty as hell."
The Newsweek reporter
went on to describe Toth's re
lation to U.S. military intelli
gence, specifically the Defense
Intelligence Agency, and how
persons connected with the
agency had praised him for the
information that he had been
passing to them while in Mos
cow. Toth was later expelled
from the USSR for such ac
tivities.
One final footnote to this sad
affair, I found that during the
course of his trial, Filatov like
Shcharansky had also been
convicted of spying, "a
charge," wrote Newsweek
"unofficially confirmed by
sources in Washington."
Filatov was shot.
Perhaps, some of the ques
tions raised by the apparent
contradictions between at least
the Newsweek article and the
current state of the news could
be answered in future Daily
columns.
