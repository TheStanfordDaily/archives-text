## Personal control over health urged 
### 
Why would anyone with
even a partially formed social
consciousness, a rudimentary
belief in equality, justice and
the right of people to control
their own lives, or with a glim
mer of the many ways our cur
rent society violates these ide
als, choose to enter one of the
most elitist and conservative
professions in that society by
enrolling in medical school?
Consider the usual doctor
patient role. The patient may
take the initiative by going to
the doctor, but once there, he
or she is quickly put in a pre
programmed role of depen
dency.
The patient is expected to
bare herself or himself both
physically and emotionally to a
virtual stranger; to submit to
physical probing; to describe
distressing and embarrassing
problems The doctor has a
practical monopoly on medical
knowledge and the authority
to say what's best.
Several studies have shown
that the amount and type of
medical care, beyond the ini

tial visit, is largely controlled by
the doctor. Most people have
been taught to respect and
submit to physicians' special
knowledge and prestige.
Consider the elitist nature of
medicine. Data from the early
1970s indicates that doctors
comprised 7 percent of those
working in health care. About 7
percent of them are women
and their income during this
time averaged $40,000 per year
and paraprofessionals —
nurses, technicians and
therapists — comprised 2?
percent of the labor force.
Eighty-seven percent of parap
rofessionals are female and
earn an average of $6000 per
year. Service and support per
sonnel, 54 percent of the labor
force, are also predominantly
female, earning an average of
$4000 per year.
People in lower echelons
have made some gains in re
cent years, but overwhelming
inequalities remain. The status
distinction between the physi
cian and everyone else is
abundantly clear in practice.
While the percentage of
blacks and women in medical
school has increased signific
antly over the last few years,
economic class barriers re
main. The half of the U.S.
population with incomes
below the mean still supply
only about 12 percent of the
students in medical school.
Finally, consider the Ameri
can Medical Association (AMA)
— still the dominating force in
American medicine, and one
of the most conservative na
tional organizations in our soc
iety. Historically, the AMA has
expelled members and even
barred them from practice
simply for violating its fee for
service ethic or daring to ques

tion the doctor's position of
dominance in medicine. At the
same time the association al
lows widespread abortion rip
offs by doctors and forced
hysterectomies for welfare wo
men. Unethical testing of birth
control chemicals in Puerto
Rican women and the neglect
of lung disease in asbestos
workers go virtually un
punished. And the AMA con
tinues to be the major barrier
to making access to health care
a right for all rather than a
privilege for some.
So why will I most probably
choose to go to medical school
next year? It's not with the
hope that the medical care sys
tem is becoming more en
lightened. It is true that pre
paid group practices are work
ing, some form of national
health insurance will probably
be implemented in the 1980s
and there is an increasing rec
ognition of patients' rights. But
these reluctant changes have
primarily been due to a push
from outside or at best from
the fringe of the medical pro
fession and not from changes
within the still solidly con
servative core.
Rather, I see health care as
being an important area in
which people have begun to
take more control over their
own lives. Doctors, along with
other health care workers, can
be a part of these changes.
The move toward control has
taken many forms. Women's
groups have organized around
the issue of a woman's control
over her own body. They pro
vide self-help classes, health
education for women and pro
test against the dehumaniza
tion of women by the medical
profession. Thus health care
provides a focus for the larger

issue of sex biases within our
society.
Other groups have or
ganized around the issue of
occupational health trying to
eliminate toxic and car
cinogenic chemicals in the
workplace, obtain better
health monitoring and com
pensate for illness — in areas
from the electronics industry
to agricultural workers.
Health concerns in this area
lead to basic issues of worker
control of the workplace and
tradeoffs between production
efficiency and people's well
being.
Community groups often
find that to improve health,
political and social change is
necessary. Not only are re
source allocation and methods
of health-care delivery political
decisions, but community
health is usually dependent on
better housing, nutrition, sani
tation and less air pollution and
drug use.
In developing countries,
health care is more obviously
tied to problems of urbaniza
tion, industrialization and un
equal allocation of resources.
But such countries have a tre
mendous potential for de
veloping better forms of health
care delivery, as Tanzania has
shown.
Being a doctor can be more
than making big bucks by
choosing the right technologi
cal fix for a dependent patient
within an ego-enhancing
hierarchy. It can mean working
to help give people control
over all aspects of their health,
and over their Fives in general.

being an important area in
which people have begun to
take more control over their
own lives. Doctors, along with
other health care workers, can
be a part of these changes.
The move toward control has
taken many forms. Women's
groups have organized around
the issue of a woman's control
over her own body. They pro
vide self-help classes, health
education for women and pro
test against the dehumaniza
tion of women by the medical
profession. Thus health care
provides a focus for the larger

issue of sex biases within our
society.
Other groups have or
ganized around the issue of
occupational health trying to
eliminate toxic and car
cinogenic chemicals in the
workplace, obtain better
health monitoring and com
pensate for illness — in areas
from the electronics industry
to agricultural workers.
Health concerns in this area
lead to basic issues of worker
control of the workplace and
tradeoffs between production
efficiency and people's well
being.
Community groups often
find that to improve health,
political and social change is
necessary. Not only are re
source allocation and methods
of health-care delivery political
decisions, but community
health is usually dependent on
better housing, nutrition, sani
tation and less air pollution and
drug use.
In developing countries,
health care is more obviously
tied to problems of urbaniza
tion, industrialization and un
equal allocation of resources.
But such countries have a tre
mendous potential for de
veloping better forms of health
care delivery, as Tanzania has
shown.
Being a doctor can be more
than making big bucks by
choosing the right technologi
cal fix for a dependent patient
within an ego-enhancing
hierarchy. It can mean working
to help give people control
over all aspects of their health,
and over their Fives in general.

Why would anyone with
even a partially formed social
consciousness, a rudimentary
belief in equality, justice and
the right of people to control
their own lives, or with a glim
mer of the many ways our cur
rent society violates these ide
als, choose to enter one of the
most elitist and conservative
professions in that society by
enrolling in medical school?
Consider the usual doctor
patient role. The patient may
take the initiative by going to
the doctor, but once there, he
or she is quickly put in a pre
programmed role of depen
dency.
The patient is expected to
bare herself or himself both
physically and emotionally to a
virtual stranger; to submit to
physical probing; to describe
distressing and embarrassing
problems The doctor has a
practical monopoly on medical
knowledge and the authority
to say what's best.
Several studies have shown
that the amount and type of
medical care, beyond the ini

tial visit, is largely controlled by
the doctor. Most people have
been taught to respect and
submit to physicians' special
knowledge and prestige.
Consider the elitist nature of
medicine. Data from the early
1970s indicates that doctors
comprised 7 percent of those
working in health care. About 7
percent of them are women
and their income during this
time averaged $40,000 per year
and paraprofessionals —
nurses, technicians and
therapists — comprised 2?
percent of the labor force.
Eighty-seven percent of parap
rofessionals are female and
earn an average of $6000 per
year. Service and support per
sonnel, 54 percent of the labor
force, are also predominantly
female, earning an average of
$4000 per year.
People in lower echelons
have made some gains in re
cent years, but overwhelming
inequalities remain. The status
distinction between the physi
cian and everyone else is
abundantly clear in practice.
While the percentage of
blacks and women in medical
school has increased signific
antly over the last few years,
economic class barriers re
main. The half of the U.S.
population with incomes
below the mean still supply
only about 12 percent of the
students in medical school.
Finally, consider the Ameri
can Medical Association (AMA)
— still the dominating force in
American medicine, and one
of the most conservative na
tional organizations in our soc
iety. Historically, the AMA has
expelled members and even
barred them from practice
simply for violating its fee for
service ethic or daring to ques

tion the doctor's position of
dominance in medicine. At the
same time the association al
lows widespread abortion rip
offs by doctors and forced
hysterectomies for welfare wo
men. Unethical testing of birth
control chemicals in Puerto
Rican women and the neglect
of lung disease in asbestos
workers go virtually un
punished. And the AMA con
tinues to be the major barrier
to making access to health care
a right for all rather than a
privilege for some.
So why will I most probably
choose to go to medical school
next year? It's not with the
hope that the medical care sys
tem is becoming more en
lightened. It is true that pre
paid group practices are work
ing, some form of national
health insurance will probably
be implemented in the 1980s
and there is an increasing rec
ognition of patients' rights. But
these reluctant changes have
primarily been due to a push
from outside or at best from
the fringe of the medical pro
fession and not from changes
within the still solidly con
servative core.
