## National service backed 
### 
Here are yet another two
cents plunked into the seem
ingly interminable U.S. Rep.
Pete McCloskey-National Ser
vice debate.
Much of the blindly anti
military spirit expressed in
these pages against conscrip
tion is, no doubt, heartfelt.
Much of the anti-national ser
vice sentiment called liber
tarianism is, to be sure, sin
cere. But to these unsophisti
cated ears a lot of the debate
against the draft sounds self
serving.
I take it as a given that most
of us think war is stupid and, in
the grand scheme of things,
wrong. I also take it as a given
that most of us accept the fact
that the United States will have
to live with its armed forces for
some time. So far, thank Cod,
no libertarian has said we
ought to turn national defense
over to a private firm because,
by golly, private companies are
so damned efficient.
Here is my point. What kind
of army are we going to have,
Stanford? Volunteer, you say.
Why don't you volunteer then ?
Any takers? I don't see many.
Case closed.
The volunteer army has be
come yet another way for poor
men to do the fighting while
rich men and their sons look
on. Like the draft before it,
which former President
Richard Nixon so graciously
ended, the poor are being cal
led upon to do society's dirtiest
work. Is this how it always
should be? I am not concerned
here particularly with morality,
but I don't think that it is fair.

Some of the anti-service col
umns published suggest that
any kind of conscription is a
form of slavery. A libertarian
said it's a way for society to get
cheap labor to clean its bed
pans and weed its national gar
dens. No one, the libertarian
said, should be called upon to
do menial, back-breaking work
unless he wants to. It's just not
fair!
At this late date it's rather a
waste of time to denounce na
tional service as slavery, espe
cially when it isn't. It is service
for a limited period of time to
the rest of society.
Moreover, it's very impracti
cal, and expensive too, to
suggest that the unpleasant
jobs ought to be done by
people lured into them be
cause they have no choice or
because the pay is inordinately
high. That approach is making
the country go broke It also
unnecessarily limits what an
American community is or
could be. We're all in this to
gether. At least we ought to be.
National service would per
form the valuable job of drag
ging people (by people I mean
privileged people) out of the
high school-to-college-to
grad school-to-job lockstep. A
little bedpan scrubbing could
do a lot of people here a lot of
good. We should be trying to
leach the high-status aspect
out of going to college,
shouldn't we?
All labor has equal dignity,
doesn't it? National service
should also allow people from
both sides of the tracks to meet
and talk and work together in

the trenches, so to speak, and
not as janitors and students in a
dorm.
Of course there is another
side to conscription, and that
side is the possibility of sacrific
ing (wasting?) our lives in some
pointless war. It's a good point
for an honest pacifist to take.

What about the rest of us?
We're forced to live in a world
where one musj be prepared
to fight in order to have a
meaningful peace. That is our
problem and we simply have to
live and die with it.
