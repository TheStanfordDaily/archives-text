# Mitchell becomes tennis pro
## 
### 
Yesterday the Stanford
men's tennis team won its
match against Foothill College,
but overall one would have to
call it a losing day for Coach
Dick Gould's netters, as senior
Matt Mitchell decided to leave
the Cardinals to join the pro
fessional tennis circuit.
"I feel that right now is the
time," Mitchell told his team
mates in a special meeting.
"My game is on the upswing."
Mitchell went on to explain
that he hasn't been happy split
ting his priorities between ath
letics and academics, though
he plans to graduate in "the
next couple of years."
In parting, Mitchell urged his
teammates to pull together as a
team, which is something that
the Cardinals will certainly
have to do to enjoy a successful
season.
Certainly Mitchell, who won
the NCAA singles title as a
sophomore in 1977 and had
been playing No. 1 singles and
doubles tor the Cards, will be
impossible to replace.
Mitchell's doubles partner,
Peter Rennert, was quite un
happy about the three-time
All-American's departure. "It's
really bad for the team, and it
hurts our depth," said Re
nnert. "We were just starting
to play well together."
Indeed, it is not inconceiva
ble to say that the loss of
Mitchell would cost the Cards
three points in each match:
two points that Mitchell him
self would have won, and pos

sibly one more due to the
weakening of the lineup.
Rennert now becomes Stan
ford's No. 1 singles player. "It's
a great opportunity, but it puts
a lot of pressure on me," Re
nnert said. "We're going to
have to put it all together, be
cause from now on there's no
easy matches."
Nevertheless, Gould re
mained optimistic about Stan
ford's chances for the rest of
the season.

"You don't lose an NCAA
champion and not feel the ef
fects," Gould said. "We won't
be as good a team without him,
but as we gain experience this
year, we'll turn into a very good
team."
Mitchell's exit immediately
precedes three tough non
league matches against South
ern Methodist, Texas and Trin
ity, but that doesn't bother
Gould either.
"Our most important

matches are the NCAA's,"
Could stressed. "We want to
do well (in non-league), but by
the same token, I'd rather have
it (Mitchell's departure) hap
pen now than later — if it had
to happen."
Mitchell's pro career com
mences this weekend as he
travels to Washington, D.C.
for a tournament and after
wards to Dayton.
