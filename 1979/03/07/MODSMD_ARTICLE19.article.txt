Stanford coach Anne Gould
gave credit to the Cal team for
presenting some very stiff
competition.
"Cal is a tough overall team
for anybody to face," she said.
"They were definitely our
toughest match of the season."

Gould cited team depth as a
key in Stanford's strong show
ing in these matches.
"Two of our top players,
Kathy Jordan and Alycia Moul

eastern tournaments," she
said. "Caryn Hertel and Lisa
Gordon really did a fine job in
coming in and winning their
matches. We needed a strong
performance from everybody,
and Caryn and Lisa came

through when we needed
them."
In the doubles, Stanford's

son defeated Cal's duo of
