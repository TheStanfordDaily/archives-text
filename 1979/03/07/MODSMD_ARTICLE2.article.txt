Assistant Provost Cecilia Burciaga led
an audience of 50 students here in a
discussion of the role of minority
women in the national feminist
movement Monday at Tresidder Un
ion.
Burciaga recently resigned from
her post on President Jimmy Carter's
National Advisory Committee on
Women to protest the firing of co
chairwoman Bella Abzug.
"Women of color have tradition
ally distanced themselves from the
majority women's movement," Bur
ciaga said.
While American feminists received
their impetus from the minority up
risings of the late 19605, majority
women tend to separate the issues of
racism and sexism, according to Bur

ciaga.
"Racism and sexism are one and
the same," Burciaga said.
Chicana women are unwilling to
isolate themselves from the Chicano
movement as a whole, but majority
women cannot accept this supposed
submission to machismo, Burciaga
said.
Chicanas from the audience ag
reed that cultural stereotyping by
majority women kept them from par
ticipating fully in the women's
movement.
"It's easy to understand us," one
woman remarked sardonically. "The
Chicana woman is a martyr and the
Chicano male is macho, the epitome
of what is wrong with men in today's
society."
Cooperation, not competition
Traditional Chicano religious and
family values for women prescribe
cooperation, rather than competi
tion, said Burciaga. "This creates the
stereotype of Chicanas not achiev
ing," she said.
But striving for success does not
mean that Chicanas should abandon
their sense of cooperation, Burciaga
stated. "We must maintain the spirit
of the colectiva," she said.
No representation
Commenting on her time on the
president's advisory committee,
Burciaga stated that the present ad
ministraton does not represent
women in any real sense. "I believed
Chicanas shouldn't think they have
representation on a powerless com
mittee," she said.
Burciaga said that the present ad
ministration is similar to President
Richard Nixon's in its intolerance of
criticism.
"As long as we were talking about
ERA we were safe," she said. 'When

we started addressing issues like
economics, people got scared."
Burciaga stressed the importance
of local community involvement in
advancing the position of the
Chicana.
"There is not one Chicana at any
elected position in the state of
California," Burciaga said. "We must
maintain a collective spirit."
The rapidly expanding Chicana
population, which now exceeds 4.6
million, makes education of the
Chicana of prime importance be
cause half of those women are under
the age of 19, according to Burciaga.
Affirmative action
Burciaga sees her own position as a
university administrator as a means
of insuring faculty affirmative action
for minorities and women.
"We must continue to support our
own community, do things at home,
instead of feeling helpless about the
things we can't do anything about,"
she said.
While specialized concerns tend
to separate Chicanas from the na
tional women's movement, the
feminist movement is not a "package
deal," Burciaga stated. "We have to
be careful not to prescribe behavior
among women, not to become
another-ism," she said.
