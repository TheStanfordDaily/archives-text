# Nine whips Fresno

### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
bounced back from a less
than-impressive league start
this past weekend with a 5-3
defeat of the Fresno State
Bulldogs yesterday afternoon
in Sunken Diamond.
Three Cardinal pitchers
combined their talents to muz
zle the Bulldogs who handed
Stanford its first pre-season
loss Feb. 19 in Fresno.
Senior Mark Abbondola re
corded his first win of the year,
giving up only one run on three
hits during his scheduled
three-inning stint on the
mound. Larry Kuhn and Brian
Harrison each pitched half of
the remaining six inningsof the
non-conference game.
Kuhn allowed only one hit in
his three shutout innings yes
terday, but against the Univer
sity of Arizona this past
weekend, he was hit harder
than that.
Kuhn started the final game
of the three-game series in
Tucson and lasted only one in
ning. The junior right-hander
was racked for seven hits and
five runs before he got out of
that first inning.
Arizona was on its way to the
15-6 drubbing of the Cards.
Freshman Brian Mignano
came on in the second inning

of that rain-postponed final
game, and fared even worse
than Kuhn. Arizona led 13-0
after only two innings of play.
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess was not disap
pointed with the team's first
league series, however. "Ide
ally, winning two out of three
would have been best," Mar
quess said, "but we took one.
The only thing you don't want
to do early in the season is get
swept," Marquess concluded.
Interestingly, Arizona State
— considered to be one of the
more formidable foes in this
year's Pac-10 — was swept this
past weekend by UCLA. And
Cal took two out of three from
the defending national champ
ion, use.
Each team's first three league
games, however, have to be
viewed in the proper context of
a 30-game league schedule. If
Marquess' predictions are cor
rect, this year the league title
will belong to the most consis
tent team — not the most pow
erful.
