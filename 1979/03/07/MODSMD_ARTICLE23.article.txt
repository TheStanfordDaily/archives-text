## Netters beat Foothill, 7 0-0 
### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's tennis team tuned
up for its big shootout Friday
with Southern Methodist Uni
versity (SMU) by crushing
Foothill 10-0.
Foothill did not go quietly
though. Standout freshmen
Scott Bondurant and Tim
Mayotte both had to go 6-4 in
the final set before winning.
Mayotte, playing in the
number two slot, started fast,
winning the first set 6-3, but
dropped the second 6-4 before
coming back to take the third.
"I played well at the start,"
commented Mayotte. "But
then I had a few problems with
my serve and he got better as
the match went on. I returned
serve real well at the end
though and was able to break
his serve three times in the
third set."
Bondurant, on the other
hand, got off to a slow start.
After losing the first set 6-4,
Bondurant stormed back and
won the second set in 10 mi
nutes 6-0. However, in the final
set Bondurant fell behind a
service break and had to rally
to win the final set.
"I lost three 3-all games in

the first set and that was the
difference," pointed out Bon
durant. "I started to play better
in the second set. I hit some
real good returns and volleyed
well. I'm not playing my best
now, but I will be Saturday
against SMU. I think our whole
team is pointing toward SMU."
Coach Dick Could called it a
"solid performance" by his
team but pointed out that the
team has yet to show its total
potential.
"Weplayed fourfreshmen in
the starting lineup today," said
Gould. "It's important that
they get the experience. I was
glad to see Scott and Tim get
through three matches. We're
still far from our peak, but I'm
sure that we'll have a fine team
before the year is over."
Jeff Arons and )im Hodges,
who may be pressed together
as a doubles team with the ab
sence of Matt Mitchell, had to
go three sets in winning the
second doubles match. Mitch
ell announced yesterday that
he will enter the professional
tennis circuit this weekend.
The Cards won the other
matches in straight sets.
The Cards go after their 40th

straight win down at San Jose
State tomorrow. This will be
their first match without Ail-
American Mitchell.
Peter Rennert will now take
over the top spot for the Cards
and will meet Nial Brash in the
feature match. All in all it will
be a telling week for Rennert,
who plays Brash, Jai Di Louie of
SMU, Kevin Curren of Texas
and Eric Iskersky of Trinity, four
of the top college players in the
nation.

Stanford's tennis team tuned
up for its big shootout Friday
with Southern Methodist Uni
versity (SMU) by crushing
Foothill 10-0.
Foothill did not go quietly
though. Standout freshmen
Scott Bondurant and Tim
Mayotte both had to go 6-4 in
the final set before winning.
Mayotte, playing in the
number two slot, started fast,
winning the first set 6-3, but
dropped the second 6-4 before
coming back to take the third.
"I played well at the start,"
commented Mayotte. "But
then I had a few problems with
my serve and he got better as
the match went on. I returned
serve real well at the end
though and was able to break
his serve three times in the
third set."
Bondurant, on the other
hand, got off to a slow start.
After losing the first set 6-4,
Bondurant stormed back and
won the second set in 10 mi
nutes 6-0. However, in the final
set Bondurant fell behind a
service break and had to rally
to win the final set.
"I lost three 3-all games in

the first set and that was the
difference," pointed out Bon
durant. "I started to play better
in the second set. I hit some
real good returns and volleyed
well. I'm not playing my best
now, but I will be Saturday
against SMU. I think our whole
team is pointing toward SMU."
Coach Dick Could called it a
"solid performance" by his
team but pointed out that the
team has yet to show its total
potential.
"Weplayed fourfreshmen in
the starting lineup today," said
Gould. "It's important that
they get the experience. I was
glad to see Scott and Tim get
through three matches. We're
still far from our peak, but I'm
sure that we'll have a fine team
before the year is over."
Jeff Arons and )im Hodges,
who may be pressed together
as a doubles team with the ab
sence of Matt Mitchell, had to
go three sets in winning the
second doubles match. Mitch
ell announced yesterday that
he will enter the professional
tennis circuit this weekend.
The Cards won the other
matches in straight sets.
The Cards go after their 40th

straight win down at San Jose
State tomorrow. This will be
their first match without Ail-
American Mitchell.
Peter Rennert will now take
over the top spot for the Cards
and will meet Nial Brash in the
feature match. All in all it will
be a telling week for Rennert,
who plays Brash, Jai Di Louie of
SMU, Kevin Curren of Texas
and Eric Iskersky of Trinity, four
of the top college players in the
nation.
