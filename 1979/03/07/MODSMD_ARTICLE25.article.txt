# Marquess a winning coach
## 
### Jenny Smith 
"If anything were to drive me
out of coaching," said Mark
Marquess, Stanford's head
varsity baseball coach, "it
would be the losing. It just eats
me up inside."
Marquess may hate to lose,
but he'll never give up because
dedication and competition
are the names of his game, and
he plays to win.
On the baseball field, Mar
quess rarely stands still. During
an intrasquad game before the
season, he plays umpire be
hind the pitcher's mound.
Frozen for a moment as he
leans over, back straight,
baseballs bulging in his back
pocket, hands on his knees,
blue eyes boring right down to
home plate, he watches the
three-two pitch intensely.
"STRIIIIKE!" he bellows so
loudly that the water polo team
practicing in deCuerre Pool
can hear. He straightens up
like a shot and twirls around on
one foot as he gives the strike
out signal and tells the batter to
take a seat.
Marquess' energy turns into
serious competitiveness dur
ing the season. The intensity
and concentration on his face
are obvious as he paces back
and forth in the dugout, signal
ing a hitter or watching for a
stolen base. He never lets up
until the game is over.
Marquess is almost as
energetic in his office as he is
on the field. As he speaks, you
can almost hear him thinking.
He cannot sit in the same posi
tion for more than a minute or
so. He leans forward in his
chair, arms folded on his desk,
looking straight into the eyes
of his listener. Then he sits
back, swivels to the side and
glances out the window. In a
few seconds, he turns back,
crosses his legs, brings a hand
to his mouth, and so on for the
rest of the talk.
John Ralston, who coached
Marquess in football for four
years here, once said, "Some
body told Mark a long time ago
that the best way to play the
game is to hustle. Mark's very
dedicated. Every day he wants
to get better in every way."
Marquess is very much at
home on the baseball field. Al
though he came to Stanford in

1965 on a football scholarship
and lettered for three years in
both football and baseball, the
latter has been his true favorite
all along. At 5-foot-11, he also
knew he would be more suc
cessful as a professional
baseball player.
Marquess played in the
Chicago White Sox organiza
tion for three years after
graduating with a degree in
political science from Stanford
in 1969.

He returned to Stanford in
1972 as an assistant coach while
he continued to play profes
sionally for two summers. He
was assistant coach for five
years, during which time he
obtained a master's degree in
political science at San Jose
State.
As a sophomore in 1967, first
baseman Marquess earned
first team All-America honors
as he played with Stanford in
the College World Series.
That season he batted .404,
the second highest average in
school history. He was one of
18 college players selected to

the U.S. Pan American Games
team.
In 1968, Marquess was
named second team All-
America and was All-District-8
and All-Conference for the
second straight season.
The 31-year-old Marquess,
nicknamed "Niner" by his
players for the number he
wears, is now in his third year
as Stanford's head coach.
"Sure I'm young," he said. "I

was 30 last year; I'm an old man
now at 31. You wonder if the
guys are going to listen. So far I
haven't had that problem."
Marquess looks like the con
servative, Ail-American type:
short, light brown hair, clean
shaven face, sparkling blue
eyes and sincere smile. His sin
cerity and openness are easy to
see.
"I always want to have my
door open," he said. "I think
it's part of my job."
Marquess wants to be close
to his players, but not so much
as to endanger the coach
player relationship.
"Sure, I joke around with the
guys," he said. "I'm not always
serious, that's not me."
Scott Laurence, head ]V
coach, thinks Marquess' ef
forts have worked well.
"Coach Marquess does a
good job keeping the respect
of his players and staying close
at the same time," Laurence
said. "You can go to him with a
problem, but he's not your
best friend because he's the
coach."
In his first year as head
coach, Marquess became

aware of difficulties he never
had to face as an assistant.
"As an assistant, you can do
more fun things," he said.
"You don't have to make the
final decisions ortell someone
he's not good enough. When
people yell from the stands,
they're yelling at the head
coach — it all comes with the
territory."
Marquess' 93-47 record
going into this weekend's cru
cial series with USC is second
only to Ray Young, Marquess'
predecessor.
"I want to maintain or in
crease the level of our program
that Young built up," Mar
quess said. "Winning is very
important, butamajorconcern
is also the type of program you
run."
There are those who feel that
winning is a lot more than im
portant to Marquess; it may be
everything. "He has to be the
most competitive person I
know," said Laurence.
Laurence talked of team bus
trips where Marquess will go to
the back of the bus and* play
cards with some of the players.
"They got mean back there,"
said Laurence. "You can see
the determination on Marquess'
face. He just hates to lose."
Senior lefthander Joe LoP
resti feels the same way about
Marquess. "Every day that he
goes out to the field, he wants
to win that game more than
anything else," LoPresti said.
LoPresti spoke of another
road trip when Young was
head coach. Young stood up in
front of the players and said,
"I'd like you to win both games
today and make it easier on
me. None of you has to room
with Marquess after we lose."
Marquess is a rare man who
loves his work almost too
much. "I cannot think of a time
when I have not wanted to go
out to the field," he said.
"Sometimes I get frustrated
because as head coach, I have
to oversee the whole program,
and I can't do as much indi
vidual coaching as I'd like."
Marquess says he finds him
self overdoing it at times. "I
could spend 18 hours a day
here, seven days a week, but
that's ridiculous, because my
family comes first," he said.
Marquess and his wife Susan
are the parents of two
daughters — Bridget, aged
five, and Anne, going on two.
Marquess sees himself
coaching for a long time. He
says he cannot think of any
thing else he'd rather be doing.
"Some guys coach until
they're 65; maybe I'll go until
I'm 70," said Marquess.
One thing is certain: if any
one has coached past 70, Mar
quess will try his hardest to go
even one year longer. That's
just the way he is.

NOT ONLY is Mark Marquess a fine coach, but he was also a pretty fair country ballplayer in his time. As
a first baseman for the Cardinals in 1967, Marquess batted .404, the second highest average in Stanford
history, and he holds a spot in the top 10 of five statistical categories.
