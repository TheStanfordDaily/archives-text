# Squash men earn fourth place spot
## 
### Ned Low 
The Stanford squash club
closed out its second season
Feb. 23-25 with a disappointing
but respectable fourth-place
finish in the Western States In
tercollegiate Squash Champ
ionships at Berkeley.
Washington and California,
both strong teams, battled in
the finals, with the Huskies
barely beating Cal for the title.
Cal's junior varsity and Stan
ford vied forthird place, which
theCardinalswon lastyear. But
this time Stanford, without
freshman ace Tom Harrington,
was edged out by a point on
the final day and had to settle
for fourth, ahead of Texas and
UC-San Diego.
John Morris, Mike McNabb
and John Baity lost their first
matches, though Baity came
back to win the "A" consola
tion round for the second
straight year.
Carl Rianhard, Jean Valette

and Ned Low were victorious
in their first matches, with
Rianhard and Low taking their
matches 3-1 and 3-0, respec
tively.
Valette had a struggle but
won 3-2.
All three lost to seeded
players in the quarterfinals,
however, to end Stanford's
hopes fora higher finish.
In the graduate students
tournament, Bob Gladstone
and Sunchai Rajadhon were
losers in their first-round
matches.
With the season over, team
members are competing in in
dividual tournaments, and the
squad is hoping fora consider
ably better showing next year.
After an added year of experi
ence for Stanford's young
team, making the league
playoffs and gaining a higher
finish in the Western Champ
ionships are both distinct pos
sibilities in 1979-80.
