# Fuel analysts seek new energy sources

New York (AP) — Higher oil prices
and spot shortages brought on by the
shutdown of Iranian oil production are
focusing interest on several alternate
forms of supply that a few years ago
were little more than dreams.
While commercial solar, wind and
geothermal power are decades away,
other alternate sources — like oil from
tar, sand and shale, and natural gas
made from coal — may be practical in
the next few years.
"The Iranian situation points up the
United States' vulnerability," says Gary
Ross, an analyst for the Petroleum In
dustry Research Foundation, an indus
try group. "Therefore, from both
economic and political considerations,
we have to look more favorably on al
ternate energy sources."
The sources of two of the three most
practical sources are plentiful in the Un
ited States: oil shale and coal. And large
deposits of tar sand lie just over the
border in Canada.
Known in the trade as synfuels —
short for synthetic fuels — the three
processes involve producing ordinary
types of crude oil and natural gas from
unlikely sources. Shale oil production

involves mining oil-bearing shale and
using heat to squeeze the oil out of the
rock.
Experts estimate there is enough oil
shale in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah
to supply the United States' oil needs
for nearly a century.
To get oil out of tar sand — also
known as bitumen — the heavy, sticky
sand is washed with hot water to sepa
rate the sand and oil. In coal gasifica
tion, the coal is smashed to bits and
heated until it turns into a mixture of
gases. The better quality gases can be
mixed with natural gas to augment sup
ply of that fuel. The low-quality gases
proauced can be used to power the
gasification plant itself.
Although the technology for synfuels
has been in place for several years —
small-scale,coal gasification projects
existed before World War II — the cost
has been seen as prohibitive. The price
tag on extracting crude oil from shale,
for example, is estimated by most ex
perts to be about $20 a barrel.
That's 50 percent higher than the
$13.35 a barrel OPEC began charging
)an. 1. But the Iranian situation is nar
rowing the margin. Independent price

increases by many oil-producing na
tions have raised their prices to nearly
$15 a barrel. And the Iranian-caused
shortage of supply on the spot oil mar
ket has pushed some prices there up
over $20 a barrel. General crude-oil
prices may not be far behind.
"If we end up in that range, it will
send the right signals through the pri
vate sector and maybe we'll get some
oil from shale out of the ground in
about five years," said Arnold Safer, an
analyst at Irving Trust Co.
The cost of getting oil from tar sands
is several dollars more per barrel than
with shale. Gas produced from coal
costs about $5 per 1000 cubic feet, some
three times what natural gas now costs.
But Eugene Nowak, who analyzes
energy for the Blyth Eastman Dillon
brokerage house, feels these methods
may be practical soon, too. "Every time
the price of a major fuel like petroleum
rises, it does bring us somewhat closer
to development of other energy
sources," he said. "At some point it
could trigger a substantial effort in one
of these fuels."
Opposition from some parts of the
oil industry and a meager amount of

encouragement from the Department
of Energy, analysts say, has retarded
growth in the technologies that could
bring prices down still further.
And production of these forms of fuel
on a full-scale commercial basis is still at
least a decade away, although pilot
plants are already in operation.
"It's a longer-term proposition," says
Ross. "It can't help us today, but it can
help us in the future."
Says Nowak: "We ought to be think
ing about these things very hard very
simply because of the long time lags
involved."
Nowak says that the large amounts of
capital involved in starting full-scale
production of synfuels may be more
than one company can bear. "One of
the problems, of course, is that these
are massive projects, these are billion
dollar projects," he says.
In addition to price constraints, syn
fuels have other problems, many of
them environmental. Strip-mining to
get at shale and tar sand is not looked
on favorably by environmentalists, and
the manufacturing processes for those
fuels and coal gasification can cause
pollution.

The sources of two of the three most
practical sources are plentiful in the Un
ited States: oil shale and coal. And large
deposits of tar sand lie just over the
border in Canada.
Known in the trade as synfuels —
short for synthetic fuels — the three
processes involve producing ordinary
types of crude oil and natural gas from
unlikely sources. Shale oil production

involves mining oil-bearing shale and
using heat to squeeze the oil out of the
rock.
Experts estimate there is enough oil
shale in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah
to supply the United States' oil needs
for nearly a century.
To get oil out of tar sand — also
known as bitumen — the heavy, sticky
sand is washed with hot water to sepa
rate the sand and oil. In coal gasifica
tion, the coal is smashed to bits and
heated until it turns into a mixture of
gases. The better quality gases can be
mixed with natural gas to augment sup
ply of that fuel. The low-quality gases
proauced can be used to power the
gasification plant itself.
Although the technology for synfuels
has been in place for several years —
small-scale,coal gasification projects
existed before World War II — the cost
has been seen as prohibitive. The price
tag on extracting crude oil from shale,
for example, is estimated by most ex
perts to be about $20 a barrel.
That's 50 percent higher than the
$13.35 a barrel OPEC began charging
)an. 1. But the Iranian situation is nar
rowing the margin. Independent price

increases by many oil-producing na
tions have raised their prices to nearly
$15 a barrel. And the Iranian-caused
shortage of supply on the spot oil mar
ket has pushed some prices there up
over $20 a barrel. General crude-oil
prices may not be far behind.
"If we end up in that range, it will
send the right signals through the pri
vate sector and maybe we'll get some
oil from shale out of the ground in
about five years," said Arnold Safer, an
analyst at Irving Trust Co.
The cost of getting oil from tar sands
is several dollars more per barrel than
with shale. Gas produced from coal
costs about $5 per 1000 cubic feet, some
three times what natural gas now costs.
But Eugene Nowak, who analyzes
energy for the Blyth Eastman Dillon
brokerage house, feels these methods
may be practical soon, too. "Every time
the price of a major fuel like petroleum
rises, it does bring us somewhat closer
to development of other energy
sources," he said. "At some point it
could trigger a substantial effort in one
of these fuels."
Opposition from some parts of the
oil industry and a meager amount of

encouragement from the Department
of Energy, analysts say, has retarded
growth in the technologies that could
bring prices down still further.
And production of these forms of fuel
on a full-scale commercial basis is still at
least a decade away, although pilot
plants are already in operation.
"It's a longer-term proposition," says
Ross. "It can't help us today, but it can
help us in the future."
Says Nowak: "We ought to be think
ing about these things very hard very
simply because of the long time lags
involved."
Nowak says that the large amounts of
capital involved in starting full-scale
production of synfuels may be more
than one company can bear. "One of
the problems, of course, is that these
are massive projects, these are billion
dollar projects," he says.
In addition to price constraints, syn
fuels have other problems, many of
them environmental. Strip-mining to
get at shale and tar sand is not looked
on favorably by environmentalists, and
the manufacturing processes for those
fuels and coal gasification can cause
pollution.
New York (AP) — Higher oil prices
and spot shortages brought on by the
shutdown of Iranian oil production are
focusing interest on several alternate
forms of supply that a few years ago
were little more than dreams.
While commercial solar, wind and
geothermal power are decades away,
other alternate sources — like oil from
tar, sand and shale, and natural gas
made from coal — may be practical in
the next few years.
"The Iranian situation points up the
United States' vulnerability," says Gary
Ross, an analyst for the Petroleum In
dustry Research Foundation, an indus
try group. "Therefore, from both
economic and political considerations,
we have to look more favorably on al
ternate energy sources."
