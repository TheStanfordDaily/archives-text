# Green library plans faculty book charges
## 
### Gayle Mayers 
The main libraries of the Universi
ty's circulation department plan to
introduce borrowing regulations in
the spring which will allow them to
charge faculty for overdue books.
The libraries do not now have author
ity to collect overdue charges from
faculty.
Gloria Stockton, chief of the cent
ral circulation department, said that
if Green Library (including the Meyer
Library basement stacks) finds the
new system "reasonable," other
University libraries, such as the
Meyer Undergraduate Library, may
follow suit and adopt the new sys
tem.
Stockton said the new borrowing
regulations represent an attempt to
remove the apparent double stan
dard in charging only students for
overdue books.
"Stanford tends to treat different
groups of people in different ways
and students definitely feel discon
tented about faculty borrowing regu
lations," she said.
Recall books
"Stockton said the largest single
area of complaint concerns recall
books (books recalled when another
student or member of faculty re
quests them) because the main lib
raries have to balance the need of the
borrower and the person waiting to
use the book. Stockton added that
faculty have always been the least re
sponsive to these notices and that
students have suffered as a result.

Stockton said the loan code was an
attempt to meet the research needs
of many disciplines where the library
is the single research source.
Beginning in September 1978 the
main libraries started to enforce bor
rowing regulations that had been of
ficially adopted in 1977. The libraries
generally allowed a period of le
niency before enforcing the penal
ties, Stockton said, and since Sep
tember the number of complaints by
students and faculty has declined.
Susan McCoy, head of the
privileges desk at Green Library,
explained that charges for overdue
books can reach a maximum of $8
once a book is overdue for a month;
charges start at $3 when a book is two
weeks overdue. After a month, the
Library assumes the book is lost and
will charge a replacement fee and a
$15 processing fee.
Hold on registration
McCoy added that the Library can
put a hold on the borrower's Univer
sity registration until a bill is cleared.
The number of overdue and recall
charges has fallen since last Sep
tember, but McCoy said the Library is
still processing about 500 receipts a
month and in (anuary collected $1600
in fees. McCoy added that the Library
only receives the replacement fees
and that the remainder goes to the
general Universityfund. "The Library
is not interested in punitive financial
action but is interested in making
books available to students," McCoy
said.
