China claims Vietnam defeated
Bangkok, Thailand — China claimed victory
over Vietnam yesterday, saying it had
"exploded the myth of invincibility of this
Asian Cuba."
Vietnam disputed the Chinese claim, de
clared fighting was continuing, but said it was
willing to negotiate once all Chinese troops
have been withdrawn.
Vietnam also challenged China's an
nouncement Monday that it has begun a with
drawal of troops from Vietnam. However, Vie
tnam's majorally, the Soviet Union, apparently
accepted the Chinese declaration.
Vietnam said peace talks may begin at the
vice foreign ministerial level after all Chinese
troops have left Vietnam.
Director Phan Thi Minh of the Vietnamese
foreign ministry said contrary to Peking's an
nouncement of troop withdrawal, "Chinese
soldiers are still occupying a part of Vietnam's
territory. Peking now talks about negotiations
and a withdrawal of troops in an attempt to lure
public opinion.
The Vietnamese foreign ministry, in a
broadcast by the Voice of Vietnam, said Peking
was forced to make the withdrawal an
nouncement because of Vietnam's military
strength, the Soviet Union's support of Viet
nam, and objections to the war among the
Chinese people.
Court rejects nuclear rules
San Diego — A key California statute that
effectively imposed a moratorium on de
velopment of nuclear power plants in the state
was struck down as unconstitutional by a U.S.
district court judge in San Diego yesterday.
Judge William Enright issued the 22-page
decision on a lawsuit filed against the state
Energy Resources and Development Commis
sion and its officers.
The decision effectively means that the 1954
Atomic Energy Act as amended in 1959 grants

the federal government the final say over
states in regulating nuclear power plant con
struction and waste disposal.
The case challenged the constitutionality of
three sections of the state public resources
law. Plaintiffs contended that these sections,
which impose certain requirements for certifi
cation of nuclear power plants in California,
invaded a field of regulation which has been
preempted by the federal government.
The three nuclear laws were passed in 1976
as the Legislature's and utilities' alternative to a
ballot initiative, Proposition 15, that would
have virtually banned nuclear power plant
construction in California. The initiative was
defeated that year.
Rioters in Chad massacre 800
N'Djamena, Chad — Rioting gangs murdered
more than 800 Moslems over the weekend in
one of Africa's bloodiest tribal massacres in
recent years, officials of this north-central Afri
can nation reported.
The killings were in and around Chad's
third-largest city, Moundou, some 300 miles
south of the capital, N'Djamena. Moudou is in
the heart of Chad's densely-populated south
ern region and most of its 45,000 inhabitants
are Christian or animist blacks, speaking
French and local dialects. Animists believe
every object has a soul.
The traders, storekeepers and moneylen
ders of Moudou nearly all belong to the town's
1000-strong Arabic-speaking Moslem minor
ity. Chad officials said the town's Moslem
population was practically wiped out and the
few survivors fled toward the capital.
French sources said the violence was di
rected exclusively against the local Moslem
minority, and no white expatriates were
molested.
Diplomatic sources and refugees from
Moundou said violent deaths in recent weeks
of about 100 black southerners and a rumor
that Moslem were plotting to turn Chad into a

militant Islamic republic, sparked the
weekend violence.
Carter to fight hospital costs
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
pledged yesterday to lead the fight against the
hospital lobby and win passage of a hospital
cost control bill that "offers us one of our best
opportunities to bring down the rate of overall
inflation."
Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano Jr., who briefed reporters on
the plan, said that over five years an average
family of four could save $132 in insurance
premiums, .$37 in income taxes and $220 in
Social Security payroll taxes through passage
of the legislation.
The administration's compromise proposal,
softened considerably since its defeat in the
House last year, would give hospitals until the
end of 1979 to slow rising costs or face man
datory federal ceilings.
The bill's "national voluntary limit" for this
year would limit fee increases to 9.7 percent, a
figure that could be relaxed if costs to the
health-care industry exceed expectations.
San Mateo to hold runoff
San Mateo — Joe Holsinger, an aide to slain
Rep. Leo Ryan, and Republican county super
visor Bill Royer clinched spots last night in a
runoff to complete the term of the Democratic
congressman killed in Guyana by Peoples
Temple assassins.
With 98 percent of the votes counted, unof
ficial returns showed Holsinger had 20,495 and
Royer had 19,104.
George Corey, an attorney who helped with
Ryan's funeral arrangements, had 15,043 votes,
and Jackie Speier, the 28-year-old Ryan aide
who was wounded in the gunfire in Gyuana
that killed Ryan, trailed with 13,370.
Eight other candidates were far behind.

Holsinger and Royer will meet in the runoff
April 3. Also on the ballot will be two minor
party candidates.
Voyager I looks at jovian moon
Pasadena — Voyager I turned its cameras
yesterday to the rippled and cratered jovian
moon Callisto — a body so cold that scientists
think snow "comes up instead of coming
down."
The spacecraft, already a million miles past
Jupiter, soared close to Callisto, afrozen moon
larger than the planet Mercury.
The spacecraft's approach showed shining
white craters and ridge-like lines against a
dark, rough surface.
Scientists had been surprised Monday when
another of Jupiter's 13 moons, 10, showed few
meteor craters. They said that suggested a
complex series of erosion processes.
Voyager I passed Callisto as it swung out
into space for a 20-month cruise to Saturn. It
has already sent back the most detailed pic
tures ever taken of Jupiter.
As Voyager left Jupiter, it studied several
moons and searched for undiscovered satel
lites as it periodically scanned its primary ob
jective — the solar system's largest planet.
Dow Jones down but quiet
New York — The stock market gave up a few
of Monday's gains yesterday, but savings and
loan shares bucked the trend with a strong
advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
11.61 on Monday, slipped back .78 to 826.50.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except patchy fog
and low clouds this morning. Slightly
cooler days. Lows in mid 40s to low 50s. Highs
in mid 60s to low 70s. Winds mostly northwest
to 15 mph.

San Mateo — Joe Holsinger, an aide to slain
Rep. Leo Ryan, and Republican county super
visor Bill Royer clinched spots last night in a
runoff to complete the term of the Democratic
congressman killed in Guyana by Peoples
Temple assassins.
With 98 percent of the votes counted, unof
ficial returns showed Holsinger had 20,495 and
Royer had 19,104.
George Corey, an attorney who helped with
Ryan's funeral arrangements, had 15,043 votes,
and Jackie Speier, the 28-year-old Ryan aide
who was wounded in the gunfire in Gyuana
that killed Ryan, trailed with 13,370.
Eight other candidates were far behind.

Holsinger and Royer will meet in the runoff
April 3. Also on the ballot will be two minor
party candidates.
Voyager I looks at jovian moon
Pasadena — Voyager I turned its cameras
yesterday to the rippled and cratered jovian
moon Callisto — a body so cold that scientists
think snow "comes up instead of coming
down."
The spacecraft, already a million miles past
Jupiter, soared close to Callisto, afrozen moon
larger than the planet Mercury.
The spacecraft's approach showed shining
white craters and ridge-like lines against a
dark, rough surface.
Scientists had been surprised Monday when
another of Jupiter's 13 moons, 10, showed few
meteor craters. They said that suggested a
complex series of erosion processes.
Voyager I passed Callisto as it swung out
into space for a 20-month cruise to Saturn. It
has already sent back the most detailed pic
tures ever taken of Jupiter.
As Voyager left Jupiter, it studied several
moons and searched for undiscovered satel
lites as it periodically scanned its primary ob
jective — the solar system's largest planet.
Dow Jones down but quiet
New York — The stock market gave up a few
of Monday's gains yesterday, but savings and
loan shares bucked the trend with a strong
advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
11.61 on Monday, slipped back .78 to 826.50.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except patchy fog
and low clouds this morning. Slightly
cooler days. Lows in mid 40s to low 50s. Highs
in mid 60s to low 70s. Winds mostly northwest
to 15 mph.
China claims Vietnam defeated
Bangkok, Thailand — China claimed victory
over Vietnam yesterday, saying it had
"exploded the myth of invincibility of this
Asian Cuba."
Vietnam disputed the Chinese claim, de
clared fighting was continuing, but said it was
willing to negotiate once all Chinese troops
have been withdrawn.
Vietnam also challenged China's an
nouncement Monday that it has begun a with
drawal of troops from Vietnam. However, Vie
tnam's majorally, the Soviet Union, apparently
accepted the Chinese declaration.
Vietnam said peace talks may begin at the
vice foreign ministerial level after all Chinese
troops have left Vietnam.
Director Phan Thi Minh of the Vietnamese
foreign ministry said contrary to Peking's an
nouncement of troop withdrawal, "Chinese
soldiers are still occupying a part of Vietnam's
territory. Peking now talks about negotiations
and a withdrawal of troops in an attempt to lure
public opinion.
The Vietnamese foreign ministry, in a
broadcast by the Voice of Vietnam, said Peking
was forced to make the withdrawal an
nouncement because of Vietnam's military
strength, the Soviet Union's support of Viet
nam, and objections to the war among the
Chinese people.
Court rejects nuclear rules
San Diego — A key California statute that
effectively imposed a moratorium on de
velopment of nuclear power plants in the state
was struck down as unconstitutional by a U.S.
district court judge in San Diego yesterday.
Judge William Enright issued the 22-page
decision on a lawsuit filed against the state
Energy Resources and Development Commis
sion and its officers.
The decision effectively means that the 1954
Atomic Energy Act as amended in 1959 grants

the federal government the final say over
states in regulating nuclear power plant con
struction and waste disposal.
The case challenged the constitutionality of
three sections of the state public resources
law. Plaintiffs contended that these sections,
which impose certain requirements for certifi
cation of nuclear power plants in California,
invaded a field of regulation which has been
preempted by the federal government.
The three nuclear laws were passed in 1976
as the Legislature's and utilities' alternative to a
ballot initiative, Proposition 15, that would
have virtually banned nuclear power plant
construction in California. The initiative was
defeated that year.
Rioters in Chad massacre 800
N'Djamena, Chad — Rioting gangs murdered
more than 800 Moslems over the weekend in
one of Africa's bloodiest tribal massacres in
recent years, officials of this north-central Afri
can nation reported.
The killings were in and around Chad's
third-largest city, Moundou, some 300 miles
south of the capital, N'Djamena. Moudou is in
the heart of Chad's densely-populated south
ern region and most of its 45,000 inhabitants
are Christian or animist blacks, speaking
French and local dialects. Animists believe
every object has a soul.
The traders, storekeepers and moneylen
ders of Moudou nearly all belong to the town's
1000-strong Arabic-speaking Moslem minor
ity. Chad officials said the town's Moslem
population was practically wiped out and the
few survivors fled toward the capital.
French sources said the violence was di
rected exclusively against the local Moslem
minority, and no white expatriates were
molested.
Diplomatic sources and refugees from
Moundou said violent deaths in recent weeks
of about 100 black southerners and a rumor
that Moslem were plotting to turn Chad into a

militant Islamic republic, sparked the
weekend violence.
Carter to fight hospital costs
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
pledged yesterday to lead the fight against the
hospital lobby and win passage of a hospital
cost control bill that "offers us one of our best
opportunities to bring down the rate of overall
inflation."
Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano Jr., who briefed reporters on
the plan, said that over five years an average
family of four could save $132 in insurance
premiums, .$37 in income taxes and $220 in
Social Security payroll taxes through passage
of the legislation.
The administration's compromise proposal,
softened considerably since its defeat in the
House last year, would give hospitals until the
end of 1979 to slow rising costs or face man
datory federal ceilings.
The bill's "national voluntary limit" for this
year would limit fee increases to 9.7 percent, a
figure that could be relaxed if costs to the
health-care industry exceed expectations.
