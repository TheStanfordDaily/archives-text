In yesterday's article on sorority
rush, Kappa Alpha Theta President
Pam Hutchcraft was reported to have
said she "didn't" feel that the prob
lems sororities faced in arranging an
off-campus rush had been serious.
The statement should have read:
"Hutchcraft was very pleased with
the University's decisions as the
sororities had encountered serious
problems in arranging an off-campus
rush. But through our efforts, we
were able to develop a cohesiveness
that I'm sure will benefit us in the
long run.' "
Also, in yesterday's story on the
new dorm.tory plans, the 1979 hous
ing study report is quoted as suggest
ing that "as many as 1500 spaces for
graduate students could be added by
reassigning spaces in Escondido Vil
lage currently occupied by married
students to single graduate stu
dents."
The number "1500 spaces" actually
refers to the excess demand for
single graduate housing, not the
number of spaces which could be
added by reassigning spaces in Es
condido Village.
According to the report, "Contin
gent upon the successful outcome of
a pilot plan currently underway . . .
we expect that approximately 208
single graduates will be housed in
reallocated spaces by 1980."
The Daily regrets the errors.
