# Carter to travel to Mideast
## Israel agrees to compromises 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) — Israel agreed to
three compromises proposed by
President Jimmy Carter that may
break through the barriers prevent
ing an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty,
Israeli sources said yesterday.
But the sources cautioned that
other problems remain unsettled,
and Egypt's response to the U.S.
proposals will be pivotal to success.
Carter trip
In the wake of the president's talks
with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, it was announced
Monday that Carter will travel to the
Middle East. The president will arrive
in Cairo tomorrow and flies to Israel
Saturday.
In New York, Begin said he felt
euphoric about progress for peace.
"There is euphoria, not only in this
country, but in Jerusalem and Cairo
and throughout the world."
In Cairo, President Anwar Sadat
met with U.S. National Security Ad
visorZbigniew Brzezinski to hear the
details of Carter's proposals. Sadat's
reaction was not immediately
known.
Sources with first-hand knowledge
of the proposals, which have not
been revealed, said they involved
two compromises on linking the tre
aty to the Palestinian problem and a
third on softening language about
whether the treaty would supercede
prior defense agreements.
U.S. proposals
Without disclosing the precise
language of all the U.S. proposals,
the sources outlined them as fol
lows:
—Israel agrees to a 12-month
non-binding target date for complet
ing negotiations on self-rule for the
1.1 million Palestinians living on the
occupied West Bank and Caza Strip.
There is, however, no deadline for
establishing autonomy, but Israel
pledges to carry out the plan as
quickly as possible.
—In a second point linking the tre
aty to the Palestinian problem',"lsrael
agrees to language specifing that the
treaty does not contradict the Camp
David framework for a general
Mideast peace.
A clause remains unchanged in the
draft saying the treaty will be carried
out "without regard to action or inac
tion by any other party and indepen
dently of any instrument external to
this treaty."
Again, this adds a measure of "lin
kage" so important to Sadat without
setting deadlines or penalties for
non-compliance, the sources said.
The Egyptian leader has been con

demned by other Arab states for his
unilateral peace move, so he has
pressed for some connection in the
treaty solving the Palestinian prob
lem.
—The third modification has to do
with language in the treaty's "priority
clause," which has been modified to
satisfy Egypt's objections that the
treaty appears to invalidate its earlier
defense pacts with Arab states. The
proposed compromise softens the
wording so both sides can feel their
interests are protected.

Still unresolved is Egypt's demand
to delay the exchange of ambas
sadors until the Palestinian au
tonomy plan goes into effect. Israel
wants the exchange to occur nine
months after the treaty is signed and
the first of a two-stage withdrawal
from the Sinai Peninsula is com
pleted.
Reliable news reports say the Un
ited States also agreed to give Israel a
$3.5 billion grant t<? cover the costs of
moving their Sinai air bases back to
Israel and to guarantee oil supplies.
