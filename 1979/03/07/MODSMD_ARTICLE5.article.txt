Associate Surgery Prof. Zoltan
Lucas has been suspended for 12
weeks without pay because of pro
fessional misconduct in his research
work.
Lucas, a specialist in transplanta
tion immunology, was suspended
Monday and officially reprimanded
by President Richard Lyman.
"Because of the chronic nature of
your professional misconduct and
incompetence over a period of many
years, the University must exercise
some prospective controls to ensure
that your behavior in this respect is
not continuing," Lyman told Lucas.
The reprimand came after Lucas
admitted that his scientific papers
and grant proposals to the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), written
between 1967 and 1977, contained 18
incorrect citations.
Lucas, in his proposals, cited 10 of
his papers as published works. In
fact, all of these papers had been re
jected for publication. In five other
incorrect citations, the works had
never been submitted for publica
ticm r -Â«ir*d4n three others, the wrong
journal was cited.
"Repeated reporting of inaccurate
citations, be it careless or inten
tional, constitutes serious profes
sional misconduct and warrants
sanctions," former Vice President of
Medical Affairs Clayton Rich and Vice
Provost Gerald Lieberman told Ly
man.
The authenticity of Lucas' work has
been under investigation by an in
ternal department of the University,
the FBI and the NIH. Allegations of
scientific impropriety were first
made against Lucas in 1973. Two

years later a review by faculty mem
bers concluded there were deficien
cies in Lucas' teaching, research and
laboratory management.
Dr. Eugene Dong, associate pro
fessor of cardiovascular surgery,
later asked the NIH to look into
Lucas' research techniques.
The U.S. Attorney General's office
also requested an FBI investigation of
the matter in April 1977, but in
January 1978, Lucas claimed he had
still not been contacted by the FBI.
The NIH, however, followed up
the Lucas investigation. At that time,
Lucas' work was being funded by an
NIH grant. In November 1977, the
NIH requested the University to fully
investigate the allegations against
Lucas.
A University committee was sub
sequently formed, and last August,
an internal study concluded there
was "persuasive evidence" that cita
tions by Lucas were in error.
Lucas came to Stanford in 1963 to
do research work in molecular biol
ogy and then left in 1965 to teach at
Duke University. He returned (wo
years later as an associate professor.
Lucas currently has a grant and
contract from the National Cancer
Institute and a grant from the Ameri
can Cancer Society. Both organiza
tions are being notified of Lucas
suspension.
While suspended, Lucas may not
continue as a principal investigator
on research projects and is denied
access to all University facilities ex
cept the libraries.
Lucas holds a degree in biochemis
try from MIT and an M.D. from )ohns
Hopkins.
