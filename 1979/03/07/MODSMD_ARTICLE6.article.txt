# Kathleen Cleaver relates foreign experience
## 
### Robert Reed 
Former Black Panther Party leader
Eldridge Cleaver was not able to es
cape the influence of American con
cepts of "justice" in other countries
as well as in the United States, ac
cording to his wife Kathleen, who
spoke here yesterday about the
couple's experience as exiles from
this country.
The Cleavers are living in the Bay
Area, as he awaits trial on charges of
parole violation discovered after his
involvement in the 1968 Bobby Hut
ton shootout in Oakland.
Though Cleaver said political exile
and political crimes supposedly can
not exist in America's democracy,
she said that she and her husbnad
went on their self-imposed exile to
escape punishment for political
crimes.
"In America, we would be called
'fugitives from justice' — I don't like
that term . . . because justice is what
we were looking for," said Cleaver,
speaking before an audience of
about 100 at Bechtel International
Center. Cleaver said that if she and
her husband had found justice in
America they would have stayed.
Reluctant to help
Cleaver, a former Panther Party
staff member herself, said that be
cause they were refugees from the
United States, countries were reluc
tant to aid them in their exile.
In 1968, at the height of political
unrest in the United States, Eldridge
Cleaver was involved in a shootout
between the police and the Panthers
in which he was shot and sub
sequently arrested. Though not con
victed for his involvement in the
shootout, he was imprisoned for
parole violation — a charge Ms.
Cleaver claims was unjust.
Decision reversed
After being released later when a
lower court judge ruled that his im
prisonment had been politically
based, a higher court reversed this
decision and ordered Cleaver to re
turn to prison.
According to Ms. Cleaver, Cleaver
felt that if he surrendered he would
be killed, so he left for Cuba.

Following what she felt was further
political harassment of the Panther
Party, Ms. Cleaver joined her hus
band. She finally met up with Cleaver
in Algeria — she on a two-week
tourist visa and he on a false Cuban
passport, said Ms. Cleaver.
Because of Cuba's refusal to sup
port Cleaver, the Cleavers decided to
stay in Algeria — a nation without
diplomatic ties to the United States.
Though the Cleavers were at first
given permission to set up the Black
Panther Party as a liberation move
ment in Algeria, their recognition
was taken away later after U.S. offi
cials informed the Algerian govern
ment that the Panthers were a "sub
versive" group bent on overthrow
ing the American government, Ms.
Cleaver said.
Eventually, however, through the
support of the Vietnamese and the
North Koreans, Cleaver's Interna
tional Section of the Black Panther
Party was given status as a liberation
movement and was given the former
headquarters of the Viet Cong as an
office, said Ms. Cleaver.
Disruptive letters
During this time, said Cleaver, the
FBI was trying to cause division in the
Panther Party. She said that, among
other tactics, the FBI had sent disrup
tive letters to several members of the
Panther Party allegedly from other
members of the party, thereby caus
ing division.
"Most of the mail we got (in
Algeria) was from the FBI," said Ms.
Cleaver.
Under suspicion
The Cleavers then went to the
Congo, but were constantly under
suspicion, said Ms. Cleaver, so they
returned to Algeria.
Cleaver said they lost much of their
support after President Richard Ni
xon's detente missions to China. She
said that many of the countries that
had helped them before became re
conciled with the United States and
would no longer offer support.
Ms. Cleaver said that people out
side the United States were unsym

pathetic to them as American exiles
even though they were fighting for
black liberation.
"Everywhere we went the people
who were the most helpful . . . were

Americans," said Ms. Cleaver.
The Cleaver family returned to the
United States in 1975. In addition to
reestablishing their family life, Kath
leen is writing an autobiography.

in Algeria — she on a two-week
tourist visa and he on a false Cuban
passport, said Ms. Cleaver.
Because of Cuba's refusal to sup
port Cleaver, the Cleavers decided to
stay in Algeria — a nation without
diplomatic ties to the United States.
Though the Cleavers were at first
given permission to set up the Black
Panther Party as a liberation move
ment in Algeria, their recognition
was taken away later after U.S. offi
cials informed the Algerian govern
ment that the Panthers were a "sub
versive" group bent on overthrow
ing the American government, Ms.
Cleaver said.
Eventually, however, through the
support of the Vietnamese and the
North Koreans, Cleaver's Interna
tional Section of the Black Panther
Party was given status as a liberation
movement and was given the former
headquarters of the Viet Cong as an
office, said Ms. Cleaver.
Disruptive letters
During this time, said Cleaver, the
FBI was trying to cause division in the
Panther Party. She said that, among
other tactics, the FBI had sent disrup
tive letters to several members of the
Panther Party allegedly from other
members of the party, thereby caus
ing division.
"Most of the mail we got (in
Algeria) was from the FBI," said Ms.
Cleaver.
Under suspicion
The Cleavers then went to the
Congo, but were constantly under
suspicion, said Ms. Cleaver, so they
returned to Algeria.
Cleaver said they lost much of their
support after President Richard Ni
xon's detente missions to China. She
said that many of the countries that
had helped them before became re
conciled with the United States and
would no longer offer support.
Ms. Cleaver said that people out
side the United States were unsym

pathetic to them as American exiles
even though they were fighting for
black liberation.
"Everywhere we went the people
who were the most helpful . . . were

Americans," said Ms. Cleaver.
The Cleaver family returned to the
United States in 1975. In addition to
reestablishing their family life, Kath
leen is writing an autobiography.
Former Black Panther Party leader
Eldridge Cleaver was not able to es
cape the influence of American con
cepts of "justice" in other countries
as well as in the United States, ac
cording to his wife Kathleen, who
spoke here yesterday about the
couple's experience as exiles from
this country.
The Cleavers are living in the Bay
Area, as he awaits trial on charges of
parole violation discovered after his
involvement in the 1968 Bobby Hut
ton shootout in Oakland.
Though Cleaver said political exile
and political crimes supposedly can
not exist in America's democracy,
she said that she and her husbnad
went on their self-imposed exile to
escape punishment for political
crimes.
"In America, we would be called
'fugitives from justice' — I don't like
that term . . . because justice is what
we were looking for," said Cleaver,
speaking before an audience of
about 100 at Bechtel International
Center. Cleaver said that if she and
her husband had found justice in
America they would have stayed.
Reluctant to help
Cleaver, a former Panther Party
staff member herself, said that be
cause they were refugees from the
United States, countries were reluc
tant to aid them in their exile.
In 1968, at the height of political
unrest in the United States, Eldridge
Cleaver was involved in a shootout
between the police and the Panthers
in which he was shot and sub
sequently arrested. Though not con
victed for his involvement in the
shootout, he was imprisoned for
parole violation — a charge Ms.
Cleaver claims was unjust.
Decision reversed
After being released later when a
lower court judge ruled that his im
prisonment had been politically
based, a higher court reversed this
decision and ordered Cleaver to re
turn to prison.
According to Ms. Cleaver, Cleaver
felt that if he surrendered he would
be killed, so he left for Cuba.

Following what she felt was further
political harassment of the Panther
Party, Ms. Cleaver joined her hus
band. She finally met up with Cleaver
in Algeria — she on a two-week
tourist visa and he on a false Cuban
passport, said Ms. Cleaver.
Because of Cuba's refusal to sup
port Cleaver, the Cleavers decided to
stay in Algeria — a nation without
diplomatic ties to the United States.
