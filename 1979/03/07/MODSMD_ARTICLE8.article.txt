# Overseas experience facilitates lasting friendships

### Karen Eustis Last of three parts 
The rumor persists that
going overseas is a way to re
ceive academic credit for se
eing Europe, yet its validity var
ies from student to student.
"I expected classes to be a
lot less work than they were,"
Kelly Gardner said of her ex
periences in Vienna. Most stu
dents agree that attitude has a
great deal to do with how one
views the academics.
"The major factor is that stu
dents don't take the academics
seriously enough," one Clive
den alumnus said. "If you want
to take easy courses, you can,
but there're challenging ones
too.
"What it comes down to is a
matter of priority," one stu
dent said, reflecting the views
of many students who have
studied overseas. "If you want

to concentrate on academics
you can; if you want to see
Europe you can do that too.
The opportunities are there for
doing independent work or at
tending a foreign university,
but then so is the relative pro
ximity of Paris or Munich or
Venice."
Student alumni of Cliveden
and Florence agree that living
only with Americans can cause
isolation, and that it it difficult
to integrate oneself into the
host culture.
Going to pubs
Darrell Ceisler said bluntly
of Cliveden, "Many students
seemed to accept the isolation
and make it worse. Their idea
of cultural exchange was going
to a pub and getting drunk."
Of Florence, Shelly Roberts
said, "It depends if you want to
fully integrate yourself or not.
If you do, then the Florence

program isn't for you.
"It took an effort to meet
people, and not everyone did.
Some students wished for
some type of family program,"
she added.
But these programs do have
the advantage in that Stanford
faculty live in the same build
ing with the students. "You see
another side of the profes
sors," one student said, "the
human one." There is a recip
rocal advantage for the profes
sors.
"I definitely got a better ap
preciation of what was of in
terest and of importance to the
students," said Walter Vin
centi, professor of aeronautics
and astronautics. "I developed
some lasting friendships with
students in a way that I'd never
done before."
Vet what students, academi
cians and administrators all

seem to agree on is the overall
value and importance of the
programs.
"The cultural difference be
tween America and other
countries is greater than we
think, and we need to learn to
empathize with people who do
things differently," Steiner
said. "I always used to quote a
Latin poet to my classes who
said 'I am a human being, and
nothing human is alien to me.'
Americans need to do a lot
more in this respect."
"I hope students come back
with a sense of wonder about
the world," Overseas Studies
Director Mark Mancall said,
formulating his goals for the
program. "The world is a god
damn exciting place to live in,
and we hope that students will
gain a sensitivity to a new cul
ture and realize the complexity
of the world. A good dose of

culture shock when they re
turn is a very healthy thing.
"The students should also
have fun—l don't see any con
flict between fun and
learning—but we hope they
will gain a new intellectual van
tage point from which to look
back on our own culture."
Students inevitably return
with the new mental baggage
Stanford's academicians and
administrators hope for:
"broadened horizons," "per
sonal growth," "reassessment
of goals" and "new views to
ward American culture" are
common phrases.
More critical view
"The perspective of being
away helps you see American
culture in a more critical light,"
Claire Kelm said, reflecting on
her experiences in Vienna and
Berlin. "Being on your own
forces you to clarify things in
your own mind. I think it

should be required," she
laughed.
"The experience of coming
back confuses a lot of people,"
one student said. "Your
perspectives have changed
and it forces you, sometimes
painfully, to reexamine what
you're doing. Being forced to
get out of my rut was the best
thing that's happened to me,"
she added.
The future of the Overseas
Studies program seems as
sured, despite the gloomy fi
nancial situation abroad. The
program experienced a $79,000
deficit for the first time this
year, due entirely to the dol
lar's faltering value on the in
ternational money market. In
hopes of curtailing the money
crunch, plans fora fundraising
drive are underway.
The Overseas Studies prog
ram is continuing to look for
innovations to extend stu

dents' opportunities abroad.
For the first time, engineering
courses are now being offered
overseas, at the Florence cen
ter. In the past, the highly
structured engineering prog
ram had not permitted many
undergraduates to study over
seas. "We're looking into
other possibilities along this
line," Smith said.
Mancall said he is consider
ing the development of
cooperative programs in the
Middle East and Mexico.
Perhaps Hemingway best
summarized the overseas ex
perience when he said, "If you
are lucky enough to have lived
in Paris as a young man, then
wherever you go for the rest of
your life, it stays with you, for
Paris is a moveable feast."
Not only Paris, but all of
Stanford's overseas centers are
moveable feasts.

formulating his goals for the
program. "The world is a god
damn exciting place to live in,
and we hope that students will
gain a sensitivity to a new cul
ture and realize the complexity
of the world. A good dose of

culture shock when they re
turn is a very healthy thing.
"The students should also
have fun—l don't see any con
flict between fun and
learning—but we hope they
will gain a new intellectual van
tage point from which to look
back on our own culture."
Students inevitably return
with the new mental baggage
Stanford's academicians and
administrators hope for:
"broadened horizons," "per
sonal growth," "reassessment
of goals" and "new views to
ward American culture" are
common phrases.
More critical view
"The perspective of being
away helps you see American
culture in a more critical light,"
Claire Kelm said, reflecting on
her experiences in Vienna and
Berlin. "Being on your own
forces you to clarify things in
your own mind. I think it

should be required," she
laughed.
"The experience of coming
back confuses a lot of people,"
one student said. "Your
perspectives have changed
and it forces you, sometimes
painfully, to reexamine what
you're doing. Being forced to
get out of my rut was the best
thing that's happened to me,"
she added.
The future of the Overseas
Studies program seems as
sured, despite the gloomy fi
nancial situation abroad. The
program experienced a $79,000
deficit for the first time this
year, due entirely to the dol
lar's faltering value on the in
ternational money market. In
hopes of curtailing the money
crunch, plans fora fundraising
drive are underway.
The Overseas Studies prog
ram is continuing to look for
innovations to extend stu

dents' opportunities abroad.
For the first time, engineering
courses are now being offered
overseas, at the Florence cen
ter. In the past, the highly
structured engineering prog
ram had not permitted many
undergraduates to study over
seas. "We're looking into
other possibilities along this
line," Smith said.
Mancall said he is consider
ing the development of
cooperative programs in the
Middle East and Mexico.
Perhaps Hemingway best
summarized the overseas ex
perience when he said, "If you
are lucky enough to have lived
in Paris as a young man, then
wherever you go for the rest of
your life, it stays with you, for
Paris is a moveable feast."
Not only Paris, but all of
Stanford's overseas centers are
moveable feasts.

The University's overseas center in Florence is located in a villa about 20 minutes by bus from the center of the city. The villa has housed the
c enter since 1973.
The rumor persists that
going overseas is a way to re
ceive academic credit for se
eing Europe, yet its validity var
ies from student to student.
"I expected classes to be a
lot less work than they were,"
Kelly Gardner said of her ex
periences in Vienna. Most stu
dents agree that attitude has a
great deal to do with how one
views the academics.
"The major factor is that stu
dents don't take the academics
seriously enough," one Clive
den alumnus said. "If you want
to take easy courses, you can,
but there're challenging ones
too.
"What it comes down to is a
matter of priority," one stu
dent said, reflecting the views
of many students who have
studied overseas. "If you want

to concentrate on academics
you can; if you want to see
Europe you can do that too.
The opportunities are there for
doing independent work or at
tending a foreign university,
but then so is the relative pro
ximity of Paris or Munich or
Venice."
Student alumni of Cliveden
and Florence agree that living
only with Americans can cause
isolation, and that it it difficult
to integrate oneself into the
host culture.
Going to pubs
Darrell Ceisler said bluntly
of Cliveden, "Many students
seemed to accept the isolation
and make it worse. Their idea
of cultural exchange was going
to a pub and getting drunk."
Of Florence, Shelly Roberts
said, "It depends if you want to
fully integrate yourself or not.
If you do, then the Florence

program isn't for you.
"It took an effort to meet
people, and not everyone did.
Some students wished for
some type of family program,"
she added.
But these programs do have
the advantage in that Stanford
faculty live in the same build
ing with the students. "You see
another side of the profes
sors," one student said, "the
human one." There is a recip
rocal advantage for the profes
sors.
"I definitely got a better ap
preciation of what was of in
terest and of importance to the
students," said Walter Vin
centi, professor of aeronautics
and astronautics. "I developed
some lasting friendships with
students in a way that I'd never
done before."
Vet what students, academi
cians and administrators all

seem to agree on is the overall
value and importance of the
programs.
"The cultural difference be
tween America and other
countries is greater than we
think, and we need to learn to
empathize with people who do
things differently," Steiner
said. "I always used to quote a
Latin poet to my classes who
said 'I am a human being, and
nothing human is alien to me.'
Americans need to do a lot
more in this respect."
"I hope students come back
with a sense of wonder about
the world," Overseas Studies
Director Mark Mancall said,
formulating his goals for the
program. "The world is a god
damn exciting place to live in,
and we hope that students will
gain a sensitivity to a new cul
