# Eustis guides new coal utilization research
## 
### Chris Mills 
If you ask what people here
are doing about the energy
crisis, you are likely to be refer
red to Robert Eustis, professor
of mechanical engineering and
director of the University's
High Temperature Gas
dynamics Laboratory (HTGL).
Under Eustis' guidance,
HTGL has grown to a $2 million
a year research operation with
a staff of 65 scientists, en
gineers, technicians and assis
tants. The major area of study is
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
power generation.
MHD is a new method of
power generation in which
pulverized coal is burned
fiercely at temperatures up to
5000 degrees Farhenheit. The
hot gases are then fired at high
velocity past powerful mag
nets, creating an electric cur
rent that can be tapped for
power.
"It looks to be the most
promising system that can
utilize coal," Eustis said in his
slightly nasal voice that rises
and falls in pitch, but not in
volume.
Legs crossed and elbow rest
ing comfortably on the office
desk, he continued, "At pre
sent the best coal plant with
sulfur dioxide clean-up is 37
percent efficient, and the best
nuclear plant is 32 percent effi
cient. First generation MHD
plants should be close to 50
percent, and future plants
should be close to 55 percent."
And, he added, "It appears
we can meet the most stringent

Environmental Protection
Agency standards."
Pollution reduced
Head bowed and shoulders
thrust down to de-emphasize
his 6-foot-1 figure, he strode
purposefully to the chalk
board and wrote a formula to
show that a 13 percent increase
in efficiency will reduce ther
mal pollution of river and lake
waters by 40 percent.
"The first commercial MHD
plant will be on line between
1985 and 1990, depending on
funding," he predicted.
Eustis said HTCL started in
1961, when he was concerned
that there were areas of re
search in which the University
was behind.
"For example, nobody un
derstood MHD and I felt that a
good school should at least be
aware of what was going on.
"What we had to do was in
troduce more basic science
into engineering — more
physics and chemistry."
'Founding fathers'
William Reynolds, mechani
cal engineering professor and
chairman of the department,
called Eustis "the guiding spirit
of the laboratory — a sort of
founding father. He's a very
easy person to get along with,
very considerate of other
people, very persistent in sec
uring what he feels should be
secured."
Eustis is a highly regarded
teacher and much sought-after
student adviser. He teaches
three courses a year, including
Engineering 32, a primary

course in thermosciences.
In class, Eustis coaxes stu
dents through his lectures.
Speaking slowly and deliber
ately, he pauses frequently to
ask, "Is that okay?" "Will you
let me do that?" or "Will you
accept it all right?"
The glint in his wide open
blue eyes betrays the painfully
serious look of his lowered
brows and drooping cheeks.
An occasional smile wrinkles
the long forehead beneath
neatly combed-back brown
hair.
Considerate
"I like his attitude," said stu
dent Lewis Butler. "He is very
considerate and thorough."
Another student agreed. "I
like Eustis' relaxed style of lec
turing — he makes students
feel comfortable both in and
out of the classroom, particu
larly with respect to answering
questions."
Eustis' serious softspoken
ness can be intimidating, too.
"He could be enraged and you
wouldn't even know it, be
cause he never raises his
voice," teaching assistant Joel
Swisher said. "It keeps you on
your toes."
But, Swisher added quickly,
"He always assumes the stu
dent comes first. If he is setting
up a lab exercise that might in
terfere with research, he con
siders the students' interests
to be paramount."
Here since 1955
Eustis, 58, has been teaching
here since 1955. He has served
as associate dean of the School

of Engineering, chairman of its
Undergraduate Council, and
has been a member of the
Academic Senate and numer
ous committees.
Born and raised in Min
neapolis, Eustis attended the
University of Minnesota there,
receiving a bachelor's degree
in 1942, and a master's degree
in 1944. In 1943 he married Kay
Johnson, whom he had met at a
church picnic. From 1944 to
1947 he Was a research scientist
with Lewis Flight Propulsion
Laboratory in Cleveland, mak
ing gas turbines.
"Back in that time gas tur
bines were brand new. I was
lucky in that I was appointed
design engineerat age 25.1 was
in charge of design, construc
tion and testing," he recalled.
After earning a doctorate at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1953, Eustis
came to California for its pleas
ant climate and to be among
friends. He worked at Stanford
Research Institute until 1956.
"I started teaching one

course at Stanford, and an
opening developed and I de
cided I'd enjoy teaching, so I
became a full-time instructor."
A quarter century later, Eustis
still considers teaching to be
"the best possible job."
Eustis works about 70 hours a
week, mostly on HTCL, and he
lilies to spend the rest of his
time with his family. Eustis'
wife and 21-year-old daughter
have traveled twice around the
world on Eustis' lecture tours,
and they backpack into the
Sierra several times a year.
Looking at the nation's
energy problems, Eustis said,
"I feel that we need a stronger,
more decisive energy policy,
and I think that we will have a
limit to our use of electrical
energy unless we build more
power plants. This may mean
that there will be some in
crease in pollution, but that
has to be balanced, I feel,
against the loss of jobs.
"It's very easy for affluent
people to talk about clean air,

but we must realize that the
less fortunate people must
have employment in order to
maintain a reasonable standard
of living," Eustis said.
The best thing about the
University, he said, "is the

openness and willingness to
try new things, so that when we
wanted to move into MHD
areas, the dean's comment
was, 'How can we help you?'
rather than, 'It can't be
done.' "
