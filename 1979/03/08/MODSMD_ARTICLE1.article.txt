# Feminists march in protest of violence
## 
### Linda Hardesty 
Chanting slogans against racism
and sexism, a group of about 70
women and men dramatized the
danger of rape on campus by walking
the routes on which women risk their
safety at night.
The "Take Back the Night" march
was organized as a part of Stanford's
Women's Week, sponsored by a
loosely-formed coalition of campus
feminist groups and interested indi
viduals.
Carrying lighted the
group marched past Wilbur and
Stern, through the Cowell cluster,
and up Campus Drive, past Florence
Moore, Roble, and Lagunita Court
before returning to their starting
point in Old Union courtyard.
Shouting and singing, the group
aroused the curiosity of residents,
some of whom expressed their sup
port with shouts and applause. The
only hostile response was at Wilbur
Hall where a few men shouted
suggestive remarks at the women in
the march.
About 10 men participated in the
march. Said one to the group, "I'm
not here because I want to protect
anybody. I'm here because I'm angry
—angry as a human being."

Several participants mentioned
anger at the situation faced by wo
men, which they said forces them to
choose between a fully active life and
reasonable regard for their own
safety.
"The march is a politicizing ex
perience," said Cindy Broholm, a
sophomore and one of the organiz
ers. Asked what the event was ex
pected to accomplish, she replied
that those involved in "Take Back the
Night" demonstrations across the
country intend to show that "we're
not going to accept passively vio
lence and violent attitudes toward
woman."
The fight against rape and wife
battering must be fought on the level
of ideas and attitudes, according to
Martine Porter, student and co
director of the Stanford Women's
Center and a marcher. "A major
theme of our march is to emphasize
ttie connection between pornog
raphy, sexism, and violence against
women .... violence on women is
the ultimate sexist act."
Junior Jill Marshall, one of the
women who turned out to march,
told why she did so: "It's an incredi
bly appealing idea, just to be able to
walk out on the campus, alone, at
night."
