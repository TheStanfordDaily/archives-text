# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Martin Pena Post-amebic planning 
### 
I would like to take this op
portunity to express my sin
cere respect for the Stanford
Planning Office which has re
cently come under the fire of
cruel and unjust critics. As dis
ciples of the "Post Amebic"
movement these educated
men have certainly made prog
ress in aspiring to the glory of
San Jose's planning excellence
and thus have committed no
crime.
A good example of this
group's innovation is the
proposal for the Mayfield-
Lomita road changes. The
$273,000 for the project is cer
tainly worth the rewards of in
creased confusion and jogger
fatalities, but is it art? A much
more noble attempt would
have been the construction of
a "Trans-Lake Lag Tube."
Such a scheme could poten
tially carry 20 lanes of traffic
and would be totally obscured
by water when the lake is full.
During the summer months,
when the lake is empty, the
placement of Alberesque
metallic bars on the structure
would make the Trans-Lake
Tube a cultural attraction for
the entire Bakersfield area.
Great strides are also taking
place in the Quad. With the re
novation of the Math Corner
we saw its interior give way to
the preferred sterility of the
USC-like qualities of stainless
steel, glass and modular of
fices.
When the newly renovated
Margaret Jacks Hall next to the
Psychology Department opens
we will see the relocation of

the two most frequently used
undergraduate facilities
the Artificial Intelligence Lab
and Boys Town Center — to a
prime location within easy
reach of the campus' dorms.
As an additional move to de
centralize the academic core of
the University, the Planning
Office should propose the re
location of the Medieval
Studies Department to 1600
Arastradero Road (old site of
the Artificial Intelligence Lab).
It is considered "good plan
ning" if not overly generous to
allow such "non-income pro
ducing" departments office
space within a 20-minute com
mute of the campus center.
Not being content to meddle
only with our academic envi
ronment, the Planning Office
f.as pursued improving our re
tail centers in a manner consis
tent with their previous
exploits.
In the Stanford Shopping
Center, we have one acre of
stores and 12 acres of park
ing embellished by several
million eensie-weensie lights
and a multitude of purposeless
flags from The Lompoc Repub
lic, Upper North Forty, and
other major countries.
The Planning Office has
termed this a pursuit of their
nouveau gauche motif and
claims it will serve as the
"working man's Disneyland"
for the Menlo-Atherton Tennis
Jet-Set.
Further projects that will
surely be rated highly by the
Los Angeles Society for Trite
Environments (LASTE), are the

conversion of the Inner Quad
courtyard to a parking lot to ac
commodate the congestion
created by the Artificial Intelli
gence Lab, and the creation of
a "clone Hoover Tower" on the
far side of the Quad to create
the symmetry so essential in
Stanford planning.
And we wonder why Stan
ford no longer has a school of
architecture.

majoring in Applied Earth Sci
ences.)
