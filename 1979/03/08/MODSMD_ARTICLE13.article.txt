## Canine power described 
### 
Several years ago, when I
was an ambitious college
sophomore, I wrote a column
for a college newspaper. I lived
off campus, in a pleasant
neighborhood that was conve
nient to the university and well
suited to my needs.
However, there was one
pesky nuisance that all too fre
quently disturbed the quiet of
my abode. Dogs. Yelping,
whining, barking, calling card
leaving dogs. One day, I be
came so fed up, that I took pen
in hand and devoted a full col
umn to a plea for canine popu
lation control and recom
mended increased funding for
the local dogcatcher.
I sealed my angry discourse
in an envelope and delivered it
to the home of my editor that
evening, who joked that I
would probably receive a
couple of letters from irate
poodle owners. I could not
have begun to anticipate the
bizarre set of circumstances
which was to follow.
The first signs of trouble
began to appear when the
newspaper's night staff, after
putting the next day's issue to
bed, discovered that someone
had punctured all of the tires
on their bicycles. The copy
editor found that a large sec
tion of the rear tire of his ten
speed Peugeot had been com
pletely chewed off.

That afternoon, a sports wri
ter gazing dreamily out a win
dow in search of yet another
transitional verb, was startled
to see a pack of nearly twenty
dogs descending upon the
newspaper office. Efforts to
bolt the door were futile, as the
canine horde stormed into the
building and demanded to see
the editorial staff. The editors
were hastily summoned and it
was then that a highly unusual
story was revealed.
It seemed that a dog belong
ing to my editor had hap
pened to see my column lying
on top of a coffee table in the
living room. The creature im
mediately passed the word to
some of its cronies that they
were about to be badly
maligned in the press and a
plan of action was prepared.
The first step occurred the pre
vious night with the deliberate
trashing of the bicycles.
Though the act was meant
only as a warning, worse things
would happen if the column
were not withdrawn. The dogs
threatened the astonished
editors with complete ruina
tion of the newsroom and to
emphasize the point, a chesty
bulldog overturned a nearby
table, sending two IBM typew
riters crashing to the ground.
The editorial staff was now
sufficiently convinced that
their lives were indeed in a
great deal of peril and they hur

riedly called the editor-in-chief
and demanded that my column
be prohibited from any future
publication.
At first, the head honchowas
reluctant, citing principles of
freedom of the press and de
crying what he saw as obvious
and blatant censorship. But
when a urinating dachshund
short circuited the fuse box
and caused a temporary power
failure, the editor-in-chief
quickly backed down and as
sured the dogs that my column
would never again see its way
into the public press.
Satisfied with their victory,
the dogs marched trium
phantly out of the building,
leaving a college newspaper in
complete and total disrepair.
I spent that evening drinking
with a fellow writer at a nearby
bar. As we sat pondering the
day's events over a bourbon
and water, I mused out loud,
"Whatever happened to free
dom of the press?".
"Cone to the dogs," my
friend sadly replied, and to
gether we drank a toast to ob
livion.

when a urinating dachshund
short circuited the fuse box
and caused a temporary power
failure, the editor-in-chief
quickly backed down and as
sured the dogs that my column
would never again see its way
into the public press.
Satisfied with their victory,
the dogs marched trium
phantly out of the building,
leaving a college newspaper in
complete and total disrepair.
I spent that evening drinking
with a fellow writer at a nearby
bar. As we sat pondering the
day's events over a bourbon
and water, I mused out loud,
"Whatever happened to free
dom of the press?".
"Cone to the dogs," my
friend sadly replied, and to
gether we drank a toast to ob
livion.
