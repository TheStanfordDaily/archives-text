## Stepping back 
### 
Recent public concern re
garding the desirability of the
influx to this country of large
numbers of foreigners, includ
ing illegal Mexican immigrants,
Iranian, African and Asian stu
dents, Vietnamese, and other
political refugees, has led me
to believe that many Americans
still uphold the truths and val
ues so cherished by their
forefathers.
As a prominent 19th century
citizen stated, in reference to
my great-great-grandparents
and their contemporaries:
"To my mind it is clear that
the settlement among us of an
inferior race is to be discour
aged by every legitimate
means. Asia, with her number
less millions, sends to our
shores the dregs of her popula
tion.
"Large numbers of this class
are already here; and, unless
we do something early to
check their immigration, the
question which of the two tides
of immigration meeting upon
the shores of the Pacific shall
be turned back will be forced
upon our consideration, when
far more difficult than now of
disposal.
"There can be no doubt but
that the presence of numbers
among us of a degraded and
distinct people must exercise a

deleterious influence upon the
superior race, and, to a certain
extent, repel desirable immig
ration. It will afford me great
pleasure to confer with the
legislature in any constitu
tional action, having for its ob
ject the impression of the im
migration of the Asiatic
races. .
Although few today would
be so forthright with their at
titudes as Leland Stanford was
in this inaugural speech to the
people of California in 1862,
the current public anxiety over
this issue stems largely from
such deeply rooted, perhaps
subconscious, racist values.
As David Miller pointed out
(Daily, Feb. 5), economic ar
guments for the limitation of
immigration are invalid. To
reiterate, it cannot be shown
that the entry into this labor
market of a large number of
foreign workers is detrimental
to the economy as a whole.
Some may claim that
America is making great ad
vances toward the elimination
of racial discrimination. This
latest public outcry, however,
represents a major step back
wards from this goal.
