## Soviet, American press distort issues 
### 
America. If you aren't un
employed, then you're work
ing in a munitions factory
where the whip-carrying
boss-man is never far away. If
you're a member of a minority,
then you will be mercilessly
persecuted throughout your
life and never have a chance to
get ahead. That's the impres
sion of American life you might
get from reading the Soviet
press.
Russia. A nasty place that
everyone would like to leave if
they could and where daily ar
rests of dissidents show a
widespread dissatisfaction
with an unbearable militaristic
and oppressive regime. That's
the version from the American
press, at least.
Specific incidents which are
reported are not necessarily

untrue, but journalists on both
sides tend to inflate these inci
dents all out of proportion.
Both sides are better at making
accusations than they are at
promoting understanding.
What has resulted is a war of
words in which volleys are
fired every day as papers come
off the presses. And there is
nothing cold about this war.
The adjectives are hot and
damning and are almost always
acompanied by intensifiers.
It is the job of Soviet jour
nalists to propagandize. The
state controls all legal publica
tions. Privately controlled
American newspapers and
magazines are said to be
"free." They may be free of
government control, but they
seem to be shackled by an ac
quired antagonism for any
thing Russian. It paralyzes their
understanding. Accusations
are hurled at the enemy while
all perspective is lost.
For example, American
journalists inevitably congre
gate around Soviet dissidents.
They circle like vultures wait
ing for that good juicy story.
So, while the dissidents make
up only a few thousand of a
total population of 250 million,
they are the subject of a large
portion of the American press
coverage of the Soviet Union.
In the meantime, many other
significant events pass by un

noticed.
The rights of the dissidents
have been violated, at least by
Western standards. Coverage
of their plight is important and
interesting to us because we
value so highly the rights they
have been denied.
But no attempt is made to
explain how Russian society
views its dissidents, nor why
the government feels the need
to treat this small and seem
ingly powerless minority with
such severity. An assumption is
made that the mean and
brutish men who govern from
their medieval fortress on Red
Square are solely responsible
for all the evils of the land in
cluding this one.
There is the implication that
somehow the society from
which this government has
emerged has no bearing on
events. If only these nasty men
weren't in control, Russia
would be a paragon of Jeffer
sonian republicanism.
Everywhere in the world,
those who dissent and those
who make government policy
get press coverage. But while
the American press has written
much about American society
it has produced almost nothing
about Russian society. And the
attempts that have been made
often fall into the "our tooth
paste is better than yours"
category.

Such facile comparisons do
not do justice to the Soviets who
do not live in an American con
sumer society anyway.Little ef
fort is made to explain those
values which make the Soviet
people unique or to depict
Soviets who live by such val
ues.
Suspicion and fear of the
other superpower runs deep in
both countries. Individuals
and nations are naturally sus
picious of anyone or any coun
try that has a lot of power. But
there is more to the explana
tion than this.
While the Soviets may have a
large military machine, this
does not necessarily imply that
they plan to take over the
world. Anyone who has seen
what the Nazis did to the Soviet
Union in World War II and has
talked with Soviets about it,
will recognize that a defensive
nationalism, not an offensive
imperialism animates Soviet
actions abroad.
The enemy must be halted
before he usurps too much
land and power. The Soviets
fear that what happened in
World War II could happen
again, only this time it will be
America and its allies laying
siege to Leningrad.
Americans cite identical
reasons for defending "na
tional interests" on foreign
soil. The Soviet threat must be
stopped wherever it exists, be

fore it spreads and becomes
more powerful. America must
never cede land to the Soviet
Union as Chamberlain did
to Hitler or it will surely be
threatened with extinction.
Where the vicious circle of
suspicion and fearwill end I do
not know. But I do believe that
the army of journalists
employed by both sides are
only escalating the conflict.
They are doing so by practicing
that most dangerous of decep
tions self-deception.
Just because the Soviets will
not desist in their ignorant war
of words does not mean we
must continue in ours. For our
own good and for the good of
the world we ought to shed our
ignorance by looking at the
whole picture.
I propose no particular
policies for America. But if
Americans try to understand
better what motivates the
Soviets, we will more easily
find peaceful ways to resolve
differences between the two
countries.
We might even God
forbid find something
good about their society which
we can learn from. The Soviets
certainly have had few reserva
tions about borrowing from
the West in the last 300 years.
