USE defended
What is the real purpose of
the article on United Stanford
Employees (Daily, Feb. 21)?
The grumbling of two work
ers about their union leader
ship is hardly appropriate for
the front-page headline: "USE
Members Claim Union Lacks
Muscle, Has Ineffective Lead
ship."
It isn't that USE members
don't like to read about their
union in the Daily. We do. In
fact, we often request cover
age by the Daily, and we were
disappointed a number of
times when our story didn't get
printed after the Daily repor
ters and photographers made

their rounds. Those were all
stories about how our union
protects workers from unfair
treatment by management.
But a story about the union's
internal affairs, if it is to be
done without insult or injury to
the workers, requires some
basic understanding of work
ing people's class interest and
how unions work, the reporter
failed to demonstrate such un
derstanding.
The dissatisfaction expres
sed by the workers is a reflec
tion of self-criticism and goal
setting, not disunity as em
phasized by the Daily article.
The way the reporter went
about selecting the informa
tion for his article is even more
disturbing.
The three workers inter
viewed are among the less
active members of the union.
One worker made it clear that
his main complaint was against
management, not the union.
But the reporter chose to ig
nore that. The worker also told
the reporter to talk with two
fellow workers who are active
in the union, a shop steward
and an executive committee
member. The reporter con
tacted them.
And in his interview with USE
President Bob Britton, the re
porter did not give Britton an
opportunity to respond to the
workers' charges.
One can only conclude that
the reporter was on an anti
union fishing expedition.

Hire Banks
I'd like to agree with David
Lazar's letter (Daily, March 6)
about hiring Dennis Banks as a
guest professor. It truly would
be a racist act if the senate re
fused to permit this recently
convicted felon to teach here.
The only problem I foresee is
that Banks would have to as
sure us that South Dakota's
continued attempts to extra
dite him would fail (he fled be
fore being sentenced) in order
that we could be sure he would
be around the entire quarter.
The program should be ex
panded. We could have:
—Robert Vesco teach Ac
counting;

—Bert Lance offer Money
and Banking;
—Yassir Arafat's seminar on
Diplomacy and Humanity in In
ternational Relations;
—Richard Nixon's Supreme
Court and the Constitution.
It is about time that the se
nate stop quibbling about
technicalities and do some
thing significant about under
graduate education (How
about "Stanford in Soledad"
next?).

Raises low
Every year about this time a
percentage figure for faculty
"raises" is bandied about. This
figure, 7.3 percent, as reported
in the Daily (March 2), is very
misleading despite its impres
sive precision.
First, the figure includes not
only raises, but money which
has been set aside to take ac
count of changes in rank
(promotions), contingencies
and competition (another
school seducing a professor
away for more money). Sec
ond, very few faculty above the
assistant professor level will
ever see that magnitude of in
crease.
In the School of Humanities
and Sciences, for example, the
departments making up that
school were told that
Humanities and Sciences ex
pected to be allotted 7 percent
from the Provost's Office. The
dean's office immediately held
aside between 1.0 and 1.5 per
cent of the 7 percent for prom
otions, contingencies, com
petition, etc.
Following customary proce
dure, chairpeople were given a
list of their faculty showing
salaries recommended by the
Dean for Assistant Professors,
in accord with the scales for
assistant professors, the only
rank for which there is a public,
cross-departmental scale, the
average increase for the rank is
7.9 percent.
For the remainder of ranks
(associate, full and adjunct
professors), the present
salaries for faculty in those
ranks were totaled and chair

people were told to take 5.5
percent of the total to allocate
as raises (in the form of re
commendations to the dean).
The chairpeople were also told
to recommend use of an alloca
tion of an additional .5 percent.
Thus, the total maximum av
ailable for allocation as raises
to associate and full professors
is 6 percent, not 7.3 percent.
Not even all of this amount is
available. If a chairperson
wishes, on the basis of merit
and equity, to recommend an
increase for an assistant pro
fessor over the established
scale amount that increase
must come from the associate
and full professor 5.5 to 6 per
cent raise pool allotted to the
department.
All chairpeople are enjoined
"to practice discrimination in
recommending raises so that
they reflect merit." This means
that if we were to indiscrimi
nately give every associate and
full professor a 6 percent raise,
they would all be 2 percent
below the cost of living for last
year. To recognize merit, then,
the professor given 7 percent
(only 1 percent inflation loss)
would have to be balanced by
another professor with less
merit who would receive a 5
percent increase (a three per
cent inflation loss). A minus 2
percent loss in real income is
recognition of high merit in the
present system.
For readers who are subject
to this salary administration
system it is important to realize
that the touted 7.3 percent is a
paycheck fiction for the major
ity of associate and full profes
sors. For readers who wonder
at the headline: "Faculty upset
with 7.3 percent," it is impor
tant they understand that the
financial picture isn't even as
bright as that figure would
suggest.
Perhaps President Richard
Lyman will understand from
those receiving the trickle at
the other end of the pipeline
why he has received the mes
sage which upset him so: . .
the faculty doesn't believe us
when we say they are the
center of our attention."

the professor given 7 percent
(only 1 percent inflation loss)
would have to be balanced by
another professor with less
merit who would receive a 5
percent increase (a three per

percent loss in real income is
recognition of high merit in the
present system.
For readers who are subject
to this salary administration
system it is important to realize
that the touted 7.3 percent is a
paycheck fiction for the major
ity of associate and full profes
sors. For readers who wonder
at the headline: "Faculty upset

tant they understand that the
financial picture isn't even as
bright as that figure would
suggest.

the other end of the pipeline
why he has received the mes

the faculty doesn't believe us
when we say they are the

What is the real purpose of
the article on United Stanford
Employees (Daily, Feb. 21)?
The grumbling of two work
ers about their union leader
ship is hardly appropriate for
the front-page headline: "USE
Members Claim Union Lacks
Muscle, Has Ineffective Lead
ship."
It isn't that USE members
don't like to read about their
union in the Daily. We do. In
fact, we often request cover
age by the Daily, and we were
disappointed a number of
times when our story didn't get
printed after the Daily repor
ters and photographers made

their rounds. Those were all
stories about how our union
protects workers from unfair
treatment by management.
But a story about the union's
internal affairs, if it is to be
done without insult or injury to
the workers, requires some
basic understanding of work
ing people's class interest and
how unions work, the reporter
failed to demonstrate such un
derstanding.
The dissatisfaction expres
sed by the workers is a reflec
tion of self-criticism and goal
setting, not disunity as em
phasized by the Daily article.
The way the reporter went
about selecting the informa
tion for his article is even more
disturbing.
The three workers inter
viewed are among the less
active members of the union.
One worker made it clear that
his main complaint was against
management, not the union.
But the reporter chose to ig
nore that. The worker also told
the reporter to talk with two
fellow workers who are active
in the union, a shop steward
and an executive committee
member. The reporter con
tacted them.
And in his interview with USE
President Bob Britton, the re
porter did not give Britton an
opportunity to respond to the
workers' charges.
One can only conclude that
the reporter was on an anti
union fishing expedition.

Hire Banks
I'd like to agree with David
Lazar's letter (Daily, March 6)
about hiring Dennis Banks as a
guest professor. It truly would
be a racist act if the senate re
fused to permit this recently
convicted felon to teach here.
The only problem I foresee is
that Banks would have to as
sure us that South Dakota's
continued attempts to extra
dite him would fail (he fled be
fore being sentenced) in order
that we could be sure he would
be around the entire quarter.
The program should be ex
panded. We could have:
—Robert Vesco teach Ac
counting;

—Bert Lance offer Money
and Banking;
—Yassir Arafat's seminar on
Diplomacy and Humanity in In
ternational Relations;
—Richard Nixon's Supreme
Court and the Constitution.
It is about time that the se
nate stop quibbling about
technicalities and do some
thing significant about under
graduate education (How
about "Stanford in Soledad"
next?).

Raises low
Every year about this time a
percentage figure for faculty
"raises" is bandied about. This
figure, 7.3 percent, as reported
in the Daily (March 2), is very
misleading despite its impres
sive precision.
First, the figure includes not
only raises, but money which
has been set aside to take ac
count of changes in rank
(promotions), contingencies
and competition (another
school seducing a professor
away for more money). Sec
ond, very few faculty above the
assistant professor level will
ever see that magnitude of in
crease.
In the School of Humanities
and Sciences, for example, the
departments making up that
school were told that
Humanities and Sciences ex
pected to be allotted 7 percent
from the Provost's Office. The
dean's office immediately held
aside between 1.0 and 1.5 per
cent of the 7 percent for prom
otions, contingencies, com
petition, etc.
Following customary proce
dure, chairpeople were given a
list of their faculty showing
salaries recommended by the
Dean for Assistant Professors,
in accord with the scales for
assistant professors, the only
rank for which there is a public,
cross-departmental scale, the
average increase for the rank is
7.9 percent.
For the remainder of ranks
(associate, full and adjunct
professors), the present
salaries for faculty in those
ranks were totaled and chair

people were told to take 5.5
percent of the total to allocate
as raises (in the form of re
commendations to the dean).
The chairpeople were also told
to recommend use of an alloca
tion of an additional .5 percent.
Thus, the total maximum av
ailable for allocation as raises
to associate and full professors
is 6 percent, not 7.3 percent.
Not even all of this amount is
available. If a chairperson
wishes, on the basis of merit
and equity, to recommend an
increase for an assistant pro
fessor over the established
scale amount that increase
must come from the associate
and full professor 5.5 to 6 per
cent raise pool allotted to the
department.
All chairpeople are enjoined
"to practice discrimination in
recommending raises so that
they reflect merit." This means
that if we were to indiscrimi
nately give every associate and
full professor a 6 percent raise,
they would all be 2 percent
below the cost of living for last
year. To recognize merit, then,
the professor given 7 percent
(only 1 percent inflation loss)
would have to be balanced by
another professor with less
merit who would receive a 5
percent increase (a three per
cent inflation loss). A minus 2
