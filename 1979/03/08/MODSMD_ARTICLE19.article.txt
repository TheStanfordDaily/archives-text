Washington (AP) â€” "The
storm came right up the street,
peeling up houses, cement,
people, poles, anything and
everything, peeling itall up like
you would peel a potato. I
don't know how I got out, how
I lived at all."
Those were the words of one
dazed survivor after a tornado
that took 746 lives in three
states swept through his
hometown of Murphysboro,
111., March 18,1925.
The more than 50 years since
that catastrophe have seen
thousands of deaths and mill
ions of dollars in property
damage from tornadoes. The
National Weather Service
warned yesterday that the vici
ous winds will take anotherloo
lives this year if 1979 is a "nor
mal" season.
Last year 53 Americans died
in the 788 tornadoes that struck
the nation, but "a one-year de
cline in tornado deaths is
hardly a trend," cautioned
Allen Pearson of the National
Severe Storm Forecast Center
in Kansas City.
And Richard Hallgren, direc
tor of the National Weather
Service, expressed concern
that the comparatively low

death toll in 1978 might result
in public apathy toward the
tornado threat.
"That apathy could be a kil
ler," he said.
While tornadoes usually
tend to be local storms, that
1925 twister described in Jay
Robert Nash's book Darkest
Hours started near Annapolis,
Mo., and roared 219 miles ac
ross Missouri, Illinois and In
diana, causing damage esti
mated at $16.6 million.
Pearson also recounted the
deadly outbreak of winds on
April 3 and 4, 1974, when 148
tornadoes in 13 states killed
more than 300 persons, injured
another 6000 and caused $600
million in damage.
The 1974 disaster is de
scribed by the weather service
as "one of the most violent
meteorological episodes in U.S.
history."
The author describes one el
derly woman in Xenia, Ohio,
whose home was blown away,
leaving her sitting in a rocking
chair in the middle of the de
bris. A man found nothing left
but a case of unbroken eggs, a
hall mirror and a box of
Christmas ornaments.
