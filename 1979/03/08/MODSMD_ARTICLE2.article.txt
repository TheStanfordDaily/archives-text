# Lawyer urges legal ways to fight abuse of women
## 
### Rebecca Moss 
Battered women should find shel
ter first and then fight back, accord
ing to attorney Susan Jackson, co
founder of the San Mateo Women's
Shelter, who spoke Tuesday at the
Law School.
Women should fight back against
violence "through legislation,
through the courts, through com
munity organizing, and by pressing
for the passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment," said Jackson, who is
also staff attorney for the San Mateo
County Legal Aid Society.
According to random nationwide
sampling of households, 37 percent
had families which had experienced
at least one incident of domestic vio
lence, and 12 percent of the families
reported that domestic violence was
a common occurence, she said.
To bring the problem of battered
women home to the audience of 20
men and women, lackson told of the
2230 women — victims of domestic
violence — who entered a Mountain
View shelter in the first six months of
1978. There are 300-350 cases of
domestic violence reported monthly
at Santa Clara County hospitals, she
said.
To show that domestic violence is
not just a problem of poor people
and minorities but rather, "a prob
lem of women across the board,"
lackson cited a study which com
pared domestic abuse in two areas of
equal population, Norwalk, Conn,
and Harlem.
The study showed that both areas
— Harlem, a predominately
black ghetto, and Norwalk, which
Jackson described as a "middle-class
white suburban area" — had the
same incidence of domestic abuse
reported to the police.
She went on to describe two laws
which have recently been put into
effect to help battered women.
A recent revision of the state Code
of Civil Procedure now means
women who have been living to
gether with a partner and have suf
fered physical violence resulting in
injury can now get restraining orders
without filing a lawsuit.

Women who have not been living
with their partner for a designated
period of time, or have not suffered
any injuries can also get restraining
orders as a result of the new state
law, said Jackson.
Most charges related to domestic
violence are misdemeanors rather
than felonies and it is harder to arrest
for a misdemeanor, explained
Jackson. Also police "don't like to
arrest unless they will get a convic
tion," she said.
lackson sees the remedy for non
enforcement as initially up to the
community.
lackson recommended that non
lawyers work in shelters, write to
legislators, and become informed on
what the police in their neighbor
hoods are doing to enforce the laws
which relate to domestic violence.
