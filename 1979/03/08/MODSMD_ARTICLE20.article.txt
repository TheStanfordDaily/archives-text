## Festival almost too much 
### 
Blues lovers were given a heady injection of
their favorite music at the Friday night Blues
Festival at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The music
was often spirited, but at times this injection of
blues came perilously close to becoming an
overdose.
Three different groups entertained the audi
ence with their blues playing: the Mark
Naftalin/Ron Thompson band; the Charles Mus
selwhite group; and John Lee Hooker. The re
sults ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous,
as the three groups powered themselves
through what must have been upwards of 50
blues numbers.
Naftalin
Naftalin opened the show with vivacious solo
blues, which was extremely listenable if some
what ragged. Thompson and his band joined
Naftalin for the remainder of the set. Both lead
ers shared the same problem; they kept on play
ing the same bluesy licks over and over again.
Thompson would constantly pick away at the
high E and then swoop down the blues for an
octave-and-a-half before ending the phrase.
Despite this occasional repetitiveness, the
group displayed a good deal of rhythmic drive
and a fine flair for showmanship. Both Naftalin
and Thompson come off as being extremely
likeable fellows, and one is willing to overlook
the technical slips and clap along with the mov
ing rhythms.
Rhythm
Rhythm was definitely a problem tor the sec
ond group — the Charles Musselwhite band.
His group featured the poorest drummer I have

ever seen in a professional group. This fellow
simply slammed down on the drums as if he
were spanking an unruly child. However Mus
selwhite's band featured a fine pianist and lead
guitarist, both of whom managed to offset the
rhythmic deficiences of the drummer.
Unfortunately this set suffered because most
of the blues tended to be in the same key. In
general the whole concert stayed in the keys of
E, A, and C. This creates a rather monotonous
effect which even the tone-deaf listener will ex
perience, even if he does not realize the reason
why.
Hooker
The closing act was the concert's saving grace.
John Lee Hooker has a moving guitar style and a
fantastic voice. One hopes that the previous two
groups listened carefully while Hooker sang and
played his way through several fantastic blues.
Unfortunately the sound men raised the volume
to an uncomfortable level during this last set.
The high notes on the guitar became spine
tingling physiologically as well as emotionally.
Alas, this was the umteenth concert I have at
tended in the last year that was spoiled by exces
sive volume. Are music fans constantly expected
to sacrifice their hearing for their love of music?
It seems that way.
On the whole the concert was entertaining
and well-liked by the near capacity crowd. Still
the listeners largely missed out on the more
delicate and fragile aspect of the blues — the
blues the way a Miles Davis, a Wes Montgomery
or a Sonny Terry would play them. For this
reason alone the concert was only half of what it
might have been.


Magician Patrick Martin (above) will appear with two other Bay Area magicians — lack Zenger and Scott
Buchanan — on Saturday, Mar. 17, at 2 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Proceeds from the show will
benefit the Children's Center of the Stanford Community. Tickets are available at Tresidder Ticket office,
Macy's, and the Peninsula Box Office.
