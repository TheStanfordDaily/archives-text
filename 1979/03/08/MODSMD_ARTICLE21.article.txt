## Well-acted Sherlock Holmes outing 
### 
Murder by Decree is an elegantly produced, well-acted,
often engrossing Sherlock Holmes outing. It also has a lot of
things wrong with it: uneven pacing, misplaced social con
sciousness, and unnecessary gore, to name three. If the good
things outweigh the bad (and, by a hair, they do) it is because
thePe is something inherently compelling about the concept
of Holmes himself. In his quiet way, Sherlock Holmes has
always been a Victorian Superman, utilizing not brawn but
nerves of steel.
It is in exactly this aspect of the Holmes character that
Murder by Decree makes its greatest misstep. As played by
Christopher Plummer, Holmes, for the most part, is the ar
chetypal sleuth, possessor of enough brains and ability for
snappy repartee to do A.C. Doyle proud. But this Holmes,
however, also shows some signs of compassion — in one
excruciating shot, we even see him misty-eyed in remorse. If
we are to be able to accept Holmes at all, it is by viewing him as
an essentially cold, painstakingly objective man. Revealing
some signs of a heart does not humanize Holmes, as the
filmmakers must have intended; instead, it merely makes it
much more obvious what a heartless bastard Holmes usually
is.
Mason as Watson
But, once this unlucky obstacle is over with, it's quite easy to
have a fine time at Murder by Decree. One of the major
reasons is James Mason. No problems beset his portrayal of
Dr. Watson; he's so confident in the role that he's a joy to
watch. Mason is able to steal scenes from Plummer merely by
looking at him slightly askance, and the best moment in the
movie, a slapsticky bit involving an attempt to corral a wayward
pea with a fork, belongs to Mason alone.

Other performances are nearly as good. Genevieve Bujold □
has a small, but central part; as usual, the lovely French actress 5
brings a special, half-unconscious quality to her role. Donald 5
Sutherland manages to overcome his American accent, for E
once, to deliver a competent performance as a psychic; it's not 9
clear, however, whether his character serves any purpose in =
the narration other than bringing an agreeable creepiness to s
the movie.
Sets
The film is helped by its set decoration almost as much as by 5
its performances. The opening shot, a slow pan over fog- —
shrouded buildings in Victorian London (which, irritatingly, is 9
marred by the superimposition of bright purple credits), sets g
the style. There hasn't been this much fog in a movie since the g
limbo sequences in Heaven Can Wait; just as in that movie, the 5
fog has the effect of isolating the plot in its own pocket of —
space and time. The buildings in the movie are obviously sets, s
but even they, with their stylized grime, add to the unwordly S
atmosphere. We get so used to looking at this well-crafted g
version of reality that, when some location footage of s
present-day Buckingham Palace is cut in it looks oddly out of s
place.
Like most of the Holmes movies, Murder by Decreee suffers §
a drop in interest in its middle third, when Holmes busies 2
himself with gathering clues. Things pick up in time for a s
snappy sequence at the end, but the fadeout is on a Holmes g
more melancholy than any other. It will be interesting to see s
what the producers of this film do with the pair in the inevita- =
ble sequel: judging from this attempt, it could be very good =
indeed. 5
