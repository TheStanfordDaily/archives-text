## Versatility makes superior show 
### 
Sting, the lead singer,
looked like a cross between a
sanitation engineer and a
punk rocker. Stewart Cope
land, the drummer, looked like
he just stepped off the basket
ball court. And Andy Summers,
the lead guitarist, would have
fit right into any English pub.
This was Police, and their ap
pearance symbolized their
musical style and their perfor
mance at Berkeley's Zellerbach
Auditorium on March 14th.
The key to their superior
concert performance is their
versatility. They are not punk,
not disco, not pop, and not re
ggae, but they are a little of
each. And then there's Cope
land's talent as a drummer. His
speed is awesome, and his pat
terns vary greatly from song to
song. His ability was show
cased in both "Roxanne" and
"Next to You," two songs pre
sently getting a lot of play on
local progressive FM stations.
Sting's unique voice, high and
tight, adds reality to the songs
he writes and performs.
Most of the songs performed
were from the recently re

leased Outlandos d'Amour al
bum, to date their sole release.
"So Lonely," a rock-reggae
combination, was played to
perfection, as was "Be My
Girl," a comical poem about a
love affair with an inflatable
doll. A lengthened, reggae ver
sion of"Roxanne"brought the
crowd to the front of the au
ditorium dancing and clap

ping. Still on the first leg of
their tour, the Police showed
high energy and spirit. Cope
land especially seemed to be
enjoying himself, perhaps be
cause he, the group's in
stigator, had dropped out of
UC-Berkeley five years ago to
join his brother's band in Eng
land.
Appearing with the Police

were openers Robert Johnson
and The Knack. Johnson, after
taking a few songs to warm up,
showed what a dynamic per
former he is. Looking and
sounding a little like Elvis Cos
tello, his amazing guitar play
ing ability seemed almost mis
placed. Closing with his "I'll
be Waiting," Johnson received
much attention for the first of a
three-group concert.
The Knack, dressing like the
early Beatles and sounding like
not much of anything, should
have been the opening group,
in my opinion. Or, perhaps,
should not have played at all.
Besides the fact that their
music was pretty bland, their
stage antics were far too flam
boyant for their abilities. It was
just like advertising that they
weren't all that good.
But, the performance of the
high-energy, high-talent Police
made up for any deficiencies in
the other acts. Every punk
rocker, rock 'n' roller, and re
ggae fan left the concert feel
ing like they had gotten exactly
what they had wanted: good
music.
