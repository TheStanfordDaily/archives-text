## Irish rats stun packed house 
### 
There were a lot of funny things about
the Boomtown Rats' show on Monday
night. Not the least of these were the
groups of would-be concertgoers wander
ing around Japan Center in San Francisco
looking for the Japan Center Theater. The
place itself seemed wildly inappropriate
for a rock event (it was the first one held
there). It had a flashy lobby (replete with
escalators and mirrored walls) and, inside,
four wide flat levels of tables and comfort
able chairs. People even shied from stamp
ing out cigarettes on the plush carpet.
Unusual opening
Most of the older, sophisticated crowd
(college students and music business
people) was there out of curiosity and be
cause it was a Monday night. Their spirits
were warmed up by the unusual opening
act, the "amazing and amusing" Ray Jason,
a comedian-juggler. With surprising de
xterity, he tossed sticks of fire, basket
balls, hatchets and cigar boxes (which
floated in the air as he shuffled them
around). Plenty of wisecracks flew back
and forth between him and the audience,
but he impressed everyone with his grand
finale. He ate an apple while juggling it and
two hatchets, all the time riding a unicycle.
For an added surprise, three old Merrie
Melody cartoons were shown before the
music started. They fit in well with the ju
bilant proceedings.

At once, six Irish Rats confronted the
packed house with the cool and insolence
of a superstarband. Which is whattheyare
in Britain, where over the last three years
they've scored five consecutive hit singles,
a good album Tonic for the Troops, and
huge popularity with musicfans, radioand
TV alike. They didn't come to S.F. to con
vince, but to make us acknowledge their
excellence.
And the music was great. The young
band lashed out high-quality, hard-driving
rock songs that were fast and extremely
danceable. The theater's good acoustics
enhanced their clean rich sound.
Unabashed individualism
Just the titles of their songs, like "Me
and Howard FHughes," "Don't Believe
What You Read," "She's So Modern," tell
they're about the urban '70s and people
who do (or should anyway) go out and do
things for themselves. "Lookin' Out for
No. 1" could be their theme song,
celebrating unabashed individualism. "I
don't wanna be like, live like, talk like
you. . . Gonna be like me!" It came off
really well.
High-spirited
Two other hit singles were obvious
audience-charmers. "Clockwork" (about
love and life ticking away) had an infecti
ous goose-step beat and tick-tock noises.

"Mary of the Fourth Form" (or, ode to a
young nymphet) was just as high-spirited.
But the real stunner of the long set was
"Rat Trap." The Springsteen-like tale re
counted two teenagers stuck in an urban
rut. The refrain caught its desperate
urgency, "Tonight there's gonna be a rat
trap, and we've been caught."
Brashness
Leadman Bob Celdof commanded his
powerful band and the happy, pliable
crowd in the tradition of British superstar
performers. Tall, lank and loose-limbed,
he never stopped prancing. For all his ob
vious references to Jagger (dancing and
dress) and Bowie (pantomimes), he had his
own undeniable charisma. Fie was also in
credibly arrogant. Between numbers he
kept up a witty running commentary on
S.F. and the audience as if he was there to
review us instead of the other way around.
Celdof didn't stop jeering and insulting
(he even photographed the people sitting
down) until enough people jammed up in
front of the stage to satisfy him. Yet his
brashness was clever, admirable and de
served.
It wasn't too hard to enjoy the Rats or
see why they were voted Britain's top new
band. Their outstanding talent equaled
the grandeur of the venue and made the
night a notable rock event.

brashness was clever, admirable and de
served.
It wasn't too hard to enjoy the Rats or
see why they were voted Britain's top new
band. Their outstanding talent equaled
the grandeur of the venue and made the
night a notable rock event.
There were a lot of funny things about
the Boomtown Rats' show on Monday
night. Not the least of these were the
groups of would-be concertgoers wander
ing around Japan Center in San Francisco
looking for the Japan Center Theater. The
place itself seemed wildly inappropriate
for a rock event (it was the first one held
there). It had a flashy lobby (replete with
escalators and mirrored walls) and, inside,
four wide flat levels of tables and comfort
able chairs. People even shied from stamp
ing out cigarettes on the plush carpet.
Unusual opening
Most of the older, sophisticated crowd
(college students and music business
people) was there out of curiosity and be
cause it was a Monday night. Their spirits
were warmed up by the unusual opening
act, the "amazing and amusing" Ray Jason,
a comedian-juggler. With surprising de
xterity, he tossed sticks of fire, basket
balls, hatchets and cigar boxes (which
floated in the air as he shuffled them
around). Plenty of wisecracks flew back
and forth between him and the audience,
but he impressed everyone with his grand
finale. He ate an apple while juggling it and
two hatchets, all the time riding a unicycle.
For an added surprise, three old Merrie
Melody cartoons were shown before the
music started. They fit in well with the ju
bilant proceedings.

At once, six Irish Rats confronted the
packed house with the cool and insolence
of a superstarband. Which is whattheyare
in Britain, where over the last three years
they've scored five consecutive hit singles,
a good album Tonic for the Troops, and
huge popularity with musicfans, radioand
TV alike. They didn't come to S.F. to con
vince, but to make us acknowledge their
excellence.
And the music was great. The young
band lashed out high-quality, hard-driving
rock songs that were fast and extremely
danceable. The theater's good acoustics
enhanced their clean rich sound.
Unabashed individualism
Just the titles of their songs, like "Me
and Howard FHughes," "Don't Believe
What You Read," "She's So Modern," tell
they're about the urban '70s and people
who do (or should anyway) go out and do
things for themselves. "Lookin' Out for
No. 1" could be their theme song,
celebrating unabashed individualism. "I
don't wanna be like, live like, talk like
you. . . Gonna be like me!" It came off
really well.
High-spirited
Two other hit singles were obvious
audience-charmers. "Clockwork" (about
love and life ticking away) had an infecti
ous goose-step beat and tick-tock noises.

"Mary of the Fourth Form" (or, ode to a
young nymphet) was just as high-spirited.
But the real stunner of the long set was
"Rat Trap." The Springsteen-like tale re
counted two teenagers stuck in an urban
rut. The refrain caught its desperate
urgency, "Tonight there's gonna be a rat
trap, and we've been caught."
Brashness
Leadman Bob Celdof commanded his
powerful band and the happy, pliable
crowd in the tradition of British superstar
performers. Tall, lank and loose-limbed,
he never stopped prancing. For all his ob
vious references to Jagger (dancing and
dress) and Bowie (pantomimes), he had his
own undeniable charisma. Fie was also in
credibly arrogant. Between numbers he
kept up a witty running commentary on
S.F. and the audience as if he was there to
review us instead of the other way around.
Celdof didn't stop jeering and insulting
(he even photographed the people sitting
down) until enough people jammed up in
front of the stage to satisfy him. Yet his
brashness was clever, admirable and de
served.
It wasn't too hard to enjoy the Rats or
see why they were voted Britain's top new
band. Their outstanding talent equaled
the grandeur of the venue and made the
night a notable rock event.
