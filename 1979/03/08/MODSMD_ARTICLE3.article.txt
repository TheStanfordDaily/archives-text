# Before ASSU Senate next week
## Rules Committee passes reform 
### Rob Lempert Senior staff writer 
An election reform proposal calling for
staggered elections, an increase in the number
of senators and districting for undergraduates
will be recommended to the ASSU Senate next
week by its Rules Committee.
The proposal will increase the size of the se
nate to 30 members and eliminate the 20 alter
nates presently elected to the body.
Elections would also be staggered with 20
senators chosen in the fall and the remaining 10
starting their terms in the spring.
Instead of seating the entire senate in a single
election, separate undergraduate and graduate
elections will be held. The campus will be di
vided into 10 residential districts, each of which
will elect a single undergraduate senator, while
graduate senators will be elected at large.
During the spring election in April, with no
seats specifically slated as graduate or under
graduate, the top 10 vote getters, regardless of
class, will be seated.
Each senator, whether picked in the fall or
spring, will serve one year from the time of his or
her election.
The Rules Committee passed the reform
proposal by a 5-3 vote Tuesday night. The prop
osal now comes before the senate as a whole. If

approved by a two-thirds majority, it will appear
on the spring ballot. Since the plan involves
changing the ASSU constitution as well as the
by-laws, it must be voted on by the students as a
whole.
Sen. John Struthers, chairman of the Rules
Committee, said the election reforms are an at
tempt to increase the effectiveness of the se
nate, increase communication between senator
and student, and decrease voter apathy.
The committee's only major point of disag
reement was the nature of the spring election,
according to Struthers. Some senators wanted
five at-large graduate and five at-large under
graduate senators to be elected. The committee
finally settled on a total of 10 at-large senators so
that students would be less likely to be elected
with only a small number of votes, Struthers
added.
He said the staggering of elections will in
crease the senate's efficiency, since at any one
time at least half the senators will have some
experience.
Presently, the senate takes several months to
get organized each fall because few of the newly
elected senators are familiar with parliamentary
procedure, senate committees, or the organiza
tion of the ASSU government.
Staggering will also give the senate some con

tinuity in dealing with issues as there will always
be at least 10 experienced senators in office,
according to Struthers.
Alternates, who presently are allowed to
speak but not vote in the senate, will be elimi
nated under the reform plan because .making
them full senators will give them more incentive
to "show up at meetings" and work on senate
business, according to Sen. Tom Cart.
Struthers said the undergraduate elections
will be districted in an attempt to make senators
more accountable to their constituents. Candi
dates will be campaigning among a smaller
group of voters and hence the voters will have
more of a chance to meet the candidates per
sonally and judge perspective senators, he said.
Graduate elections will not be districted be
cause it might prove difficult to get a senator
from each graduate department, while several
students from each department such as law
might be willing to run, according to Sen. Man
uel Banilla.
Struthers said the exact details of how the new
election system will be administered have not
yet been completely worked out. If the senate
approves the major points of the plan next
Thursday, it will be taken back to committee to
work out the final details in time for the spring
election.
