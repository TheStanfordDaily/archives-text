Carter flies to Middle East
Washington — President Jimmy Carter flew to
Cairo last night for what Egyptian officials are cal
ling "the final sprint to peace."
And barely concealing their optimism, U.S. offi
cials said that while too many details remain for
Carter to completely wrap up a treaty, they are not
ruling out initialing one on the trip.
The president, after flying across the Atlantic
overnight, will ride in a motorcade into the capital
to open a three-day visit that Egyptians hope will
boost President Anwar Sadat's image. Tens of
thousands of spectators are expected to line the
route.
Also mixed in with the negotiating are a Carter
train ride tomorrow to Alexandria and a speech
Saturday to the Egyptian Parliament in Cairo. He
also will inspect the pyramids.
Carter's high visibility is designed to rub off on
Sadat, who is distrusted in much of the Arab world
for pursuing peace with Israel.
Carter will shuttle to Jerusalem on Saturday
evening, planning to remain at least until Monday.
Beyond that, his itinerary has not been disclosed
and may not even be set.
Khomeini calls his officials weak
Tehran, Iran — Iran's provisional government
appeared headed for a crisis yesterday after the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the architect of the
revolution, called the nation's ministers "weak"
and derided them for believing "everything
should be copied from the West."
The Khomeini-appointed government of Prime
Minister Mehdi Bazargan, primarily Western
educated liberals, has expressed anger over the
wave of secret trials, executions and arrests car
ried out by Khomeini's followers. A revolutionary
firing squad executed six men Tuesday night after
they were found guilty of kidnapping boys and
placing them at the service of homosexuals.
No disturbances were reported in the oil fields,
however. Officials of the National Iranian Oil Co.
announced that within a 24-hour period crude oil
production rose by 300,000 barrels to 2 million
barrels as the country's chief refining complex in
Abadan neared maximum capacity.

Khomeini's criticisms came as rumors persisted
that Bazargan is considering resigning in frustra
tion over his lack of power. His aides denied re
ports that he resigned.
Reagan announces candidacy
Washington — Ronald Reagan supporters an
nounced yesterday the formation of an explorat
ory 1980 presidential campaign committee, boast
ing that he already has won over many one-time
backers of former President Gerald Ford.
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.) who headed Reagan's
1976 near-miss campaign for the Republican pres
idential nomination, referred to the new organiza
tion as an "exploratory effort."
Reagan's acceptance makes the group his prin
cipal compaign committee under federal law, and
makes the former California governor a legal can
didate for president.
In a letter authorizing formation of the commit
tee, however, Reagan said he would "make the
final decision concerning the candidacy for presi
dent later this year." The formal declaration is
expected sometime in September, according to
Reagan intimates.
State seeks Tanner reversal
Sacramento — State Supreme Court justices sub
jected Attorney General George Deukmejian to
grueling questioning yesterday as he sought a re
versal of their decision in the "use a gun, go to
prison" case.
The court had granted an unusual rehearing of
its Dec. 22 decision that a 1975 law providing for
prison terms fur majorfelonies in which a gun was
used did not prevent a judge from granting proba
tion in extraordinary cases.
The case in question involves Harold Tanner,
who was convicted of robbing a grocery store in
San Mateo County of $41 with an unloaded gun in
1976 in what he contended was an attempt to test
the store's security system. The trial judge sen
tenced him to probation with a year in county jail,
instead of state prison.
The Tanner ruling prompted a torrent of criti
cism of the court by law enforcement groups and
legislators. A state commission has begun an in

vestigation of whether the ruling was deliberately
delayed until after the Nov. 7 election, when Chief
Justice Rose Bird and three colleagues were on the
ballot.
Chavez calls for lettuce boycott
Salinas — The United Farm Workers will call a
nationwide lettuce boycott to go along with its
boycott of Chiquita bananas in an effort to exert
more pressure on growers to settle a seven
week-old strike, union leader Cesar Chavez said
yesterday.
Chavez made the announcement at a news con
ference before more than 4000 UFW members and
sympathizers marched through this farming
community in a show of support for the strike,
which has virtually stopped harvesting of 40 per
cent of the nation's winter lettuce crop.
The strike has idled harvesting of several crops,
but its biggest effect has been on the Imperial
Valley, where nearly $10 million in lettuce has rot
ted in the fields.
Stocks' early rally fades
New York — The stock market chalked up a
broad gain in accelerated trading yesterday on the
eve of the start of President Carter's Middle East
peace mission. But the rally faded a bit toward the
close as Wall Street looked ahead to the govern
ment's monthly report today on the producer
price index. The Dow Jones average of 30 indust
rials, up about 11 points at its mid-day high, settled
for a 7.71 gain at 834.29 by the close. Volume on
the Big Board reached 28.93 million shares, up
from 24.49 million Tuesday.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. A little warmer tomor
row. Lows mostly in the 40s. High in the mid 60s to
mid 70s. Northeasterly winds increasing to 10 to 20
mph today.
Correction
In the heart disease prevention story which ran
Tuesday, it was incorrectly stated that the "prog
ram now has 27 couples enrolled. . . ."In fact, the
program is still screening couples. The Daily re
grets the error.
