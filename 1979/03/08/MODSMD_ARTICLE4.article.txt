# University physicians question, when is a life worth saving?
## 
### Ruthann Richter 
Due to the enormous advances
ot medical science over the last 10
to 15 years, doctors are not con
fronting the question of just how
far they should go in treating a crit
ically ill patient and perhaps pro
longing his life when his chances
of survival are minimal.
"Every day in every hospital in
this country, decisions like that are
made," said Dr. Michael Bresler, a
physician in the emergency room
at the Hospital here.
The decisions are complex and
have brought into play a whole
host of social, ethical, legal,
economic and human questions.
There are no fixed guidelines for
making such decisions, and the
approach varies depending upon
the physician and the individual
patient involved.
"Some physicians believe they
should exercise their ability to the
utmost," no matter what the pos
sible outcome, said Dr. Myer Ro
senthal, director of the intensive
care unit (ICU). "I don't hold with

this particularly," he added.
Rosenthal said he believes the
primary consideration should be
whether the patient will emerge
from the hospital as a productive
human being.
But the question remains, he
said, "In whose eyes is it a produc
tive life?"
He offered the example of a pa
tient being treated for chest pains
at the Bethesda Naval Hospital
about five years ago who was
paralyzed by the procedure. He
was immediately resuscitated and
put on a respirator, or breathing
machine.
The patient spent 384 days in the
ICU reading books with a mechan
ical device and watching TV. The
care he received there, Rosenthal
said, would have cost between
$500,000 and $750,000 here. He es
timated it cost the Navy $250,000.
"What could that quarter of a
million dollars be used for? Plenty.
But who's to say? To that man, it
was better than dying. That was a
100 percent total drain on society.

But that man was happy," Rosent
hal said.
Such care that enables doctors
to keep a patient technically alive
— to keep his heart beating and
lungs working — has been made
possible through the development
of sophisticated life-support
equipment.
Bresler said that in the ICU the
question often arises whether a pa
tient should be kept on a re
spirator, which prohibits him from
speaking and requires sedation, or
be kept in a position where he can
communicate with his family.
In the latter case, the patient will
die earlier, but he will die in a more
personal and more dignified way.
Many believe that the technical
apparatus that envelop the patient
in the ICU create an environment
that is alien to the human life it is
designed to support.
"Originally the patient was sur
rounded by the family and the doc
tor (in the home). Then the nurse
and the doctor (in the hospital).

And now the nurse and the
machine (in the ICU)," said Dr. Art
Frankel, a first-year resident at the
Veterans Administration Hospital
in Palo Alto.
Frankel said that there is virtually
no need for the ICU doctor to
enter the patient's room. He can
prescribe treatment simply by
monitoring the equipment and the
patient's flow chart.
A lot of tubes
"It's very easy to replace your
own support with a lot of tubes,"
Frankel said.
The dehumanization brought
on by modern technology was
cited as one reason for the enact
ment of "right-to-die" legislation
in California in late 1976.
The legislation, which was the
first of its kind in the country, al
lowed a person to sign a so-called
"living will," giving his permission
to a doctor to withhold or with
draw his life-sustaining medical
care if the person should suffer
from a terminal illness.
The law was designed to satisfy
both a patient's right to control his
own medical destiny and die with
dignity and the doctor's concern
over potential legal problems.
Four or five instances
Rosenthal said he knew of four
or five instances where the will had
been applied here. In his own
practice, he said, the new law "ab
solutely did not affect my treat
ment." He added that "I think they
are good laws. . . . They're not
there to tie our hands in cases
where there are reasonable
chances of success."
The laws are there, he said, for
the doctors who may "go too far"
in treating a critically ill patient be
cause of the threat of a malpractice
suit.
Many doctors' decisions, he ad

ded, are ruled by that legal threat. 1
One result of society's interest |
in protecting itself from poor med- g
ical practices is the high price tag '
attached to the assurance of good
medical care. Where the critically |
ill are involved, the price is even
higher.
High average cost
In the ICU here, the average cost §
of a hospital bed is $600 a day, |
which does not include fees for
physicians, equipment monitor- g
ing, drugs and specialized equip
ment, such as respirators. Use of a
respirator, which is deemed
necessary for about half of the ICU I
patients, adds another $144 a day. I
Doctors at the Hospital insist ji
that a patient's ability to pay for
these services is never a criterion 112
for treatment. Some method of
payment, they say, can always be |
arranged.
In that sense, Rosenthal, Stan
ford practices with "unlimited re- I
sources."
"As long as a third party or the
government pays the bills, Stan
ford doesn't have to worry. . . but
if we overdo it, the well is going to
dry up. And the well is drying up," I
Rosenthal said.
As he pointed out, the problem |
is that too many people are taking
his free-wheeling attitude, with |
the result that more and more |
economic pressure is being placed 112
on the system.
Hospitals are now being |
threatened by hospital cost con- §
tainment legislation, which is §
especially unpopular among |
hospital-based physicians.
One alternative, Rosenthal re- I
fleeted, is for doctors themselves
to become more involved in finan- 1
cial decision-making.
"But if we do," he countered, 1
"Aren't we going to be putting a I
finite value on patients' lives?"
