# University physicians question, when is a life worth saving?

### Ruthann Richter 
Due to the enormous advances
ot medical science over the last 10
to 15 years, doctors are not con
fronting the question of just how
far they should go in treating a crit
ically ill patient and perhaps pro
longing his life when his chances
of survival are minimal.
"Every day in every hospital in
this country, decisions like that are
made," said Dr. Michael Bresler, a
physician in the emergency room
at the Hospital here.
The decisions are complex and
have brought into play a whole
host of social, ethical, legal,
economic and human questions.
There are no fixed guidelines for
making such decisions, and the
approach varies depending upon
the physician and the individual
patient involved.
"Some physicians believe they
should exercise their ability to the
utmost," no matter what the pos
sible outcome, said Dr. Myer Ro
senthal, director of the intensive
care unit (ICU). "I don't hold with

this particularly," he added.
Rosenthal said he believes the
primary consideration should be
whether the patient will emerge
from the hospital as a productive
human being.
But the question remains, he
said, "In whose eyes is it a produc
tive life?"
He offered the example of a pa
tient being treated for chest pains
at the Bethesda Naval Hospital
about five years ago who was
paralyzed by the procedure. He
was immediately resuscitated and
put on a respirator, or breathing
machine.
The patient spent 384 days in the
ICU reading books with a mechan
ical device and watching TV. The
care he received there, Rosenthal
said, would have cost between
$500,000 and $750,000 here. He es
timated it cost the Navy $250,000.
"What could that quarter of a
million dollars be used for? Plenty.
But who's to say? To that man, it
was better than dying. That was a
100 percent total drain on society.

But that man was happy," Rosent
hal said.
Such care that enables doctors
to keep a patient technically alive
— to keep his heart beating and
lungs working — has been made
possible through the development
of sophisticated life-support
equipment.
Bresler said that in the ICU the
question often arises whether a pa
tient should be kept on a re
spirator, which prohibits him from
speaking and requires sedation, or
be kept in a position where he can
communicate with his family.
In the latter case, the patient will
die earlier, but he will die in a more
personal and more dignified way.
Many believe that the technical
apparatus that envelop the patient
in the ICU create an environment
that is alien to the human life it is
designed to support.
"Originally the patient was sur
rounded by the family and the doc
tor (in the home). Then the nurse
and the doctor (in the hospital).
