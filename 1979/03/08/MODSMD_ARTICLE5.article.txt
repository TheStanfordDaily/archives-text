# Vietnamese war closes as Chinese withdraw
## 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — Vietnam
accused Chinese troops of "pi under
ing, burning people's homes and
shelling" as they withdrew from Vie
tnam yesterday, but despite the
charges, the Chinese-Vietnamese war
appeared to be drawing to a close.
It was the first confirmation by the
Vietnamese that the Chinese, who
announced Monday that they were
pulling out of Vietnam, had begun
moving back.
The Chinese withdrawal might
take two weeks or more because
"pulling out is more difficult militar
ily than advancing," according to
Chinese sources in Peking quoted by
the Japanese news service, Kyodo
said.
Kyodo also said China claimed to
have killed or wounded 10,000 Viet
namese and to have taken 1000 pris
oners.
The Vietnamese news agency
claimed Vietnam had "put out of ac
tion 45,000 enemy soldiers, knocked
out 273 tanks and armored personnel
carriers and hit hundreds of artillery
pieces and mortars." The claim was
quoted in a dispatch by the Soviet
news agency Tass from Hanoi.
The Vietnamese confirmation of
the Chinese pullback, coupled with
Vietnam's promise to refrain from at
tacking withdrawing troops, made it
appear the 17-day-old war was near
ing an end. Both countries have
claimed victory.
However, Western observers were
wary. In Washington, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke
said "certain Chinese units" have re
turned to China. But he said, "I am
not prepared to call it a withdrawal. It
may be only redeployment."
And Western intelligence sources
in Bangkok also said they have not
seen any evidence yet of a major
Chinese withdrawal.
It was unclear whether Vietnam's
charge that the Chinese were using a
scorched earth policy while withdraw
ing might prolong the fighting.
