# Affirmative action officer calls for continued push
## 
### Robert Reed 
"The affirmative action office should be
working itself out of business," said Santiago
Rodriguez, who became the new affirmative
action officer here )an. 15.
"Affirmative action calls for positive action
to change things," said the 34-year-old Rod
riguez. "Special steps have to be taken to cor
rect past injustices — and that's what we're
doing today," he said.
Rodriguez' position calls on him to set goals
for affirmative action, monitor these goals
through the departments, report directly to
the president, and if need be, "let all the rele
vant people know that there may be a prob
lem."
Although he must be concerned with, and
have input into, all levels of affirmative action
at the University, Rodriguez' specific focus will
be at the staff level.
"There is some ambiguity among the Uni
versity about the affirmative action office,"
Rodriguez said, pointing out that some people
around campus feel his office should be more
directly involved with other areas of affirma
tive action — namely faculty and student affir
mative action.
Rodriguez worried that affirmative action at
the staff level seemed to have reached a

plateau. He said, "We need to develop a push
to reach above that plateau."
On a relative basis, the University is better
than other institutions and businesses in affir
mative action, but Rodriguez said this was no
excuse.
"We have a responsibility that goes beyond
just the University itself," said Rodriguez. He
explained that because the University is one of
the largest employers in the Bay Area, as well
as one of the top-rated schools in the nation,
what it does, or what stance it takes, has a
"spin-off" effect on others.
"Stanford should set an example," Rod
riguez said.
"More work can be done," said Rodriguez,
"especially at the professional levels." Rod
riguez also explained that lack of upward mo
bility in lower-level positions has caused much
dissatisfaction.
"University policy calls for progressive
rather than reactive programs (in affirmative
action)," said Rodriguez.
"Decentralization (in the University) is a
problem," said Rodriguez, explaining that the
lack of hierarchy in department systems
creates "organizational problems." Though
the University as a whole is responsible for

affirmative action as an institution, hiring and
admittance are done separately by the diffe
rent departments, explained Rodriguez.
While many people have attributed the Uni
versity's affirmative action problems to the af
fluence of Palo Alto and the high housing costs
here Rodriguez says this just isn't true.
"The pool is much larger than people
realize," said Rodriguez. "Much more innova
tion can be done in terms of recruitment and
outreach."
Rodriguez says the major problem with af
firmative action on the national scale is that
among many people "there's always an im
plicit feeling that minorities are inferior."
Rodriguez explained that because of this,
they feel affirmative action is granting prefe
rential treatment to minorities. Rodriguez dis
agreed.
"If you're looking for the best employees,
you're limiting yourself if you exclude
minorities," said Rodriguez. "Rather than
granting preferential treatment (through af
firmative action), you're expanding the com
petition."
The mood in the country is now conserva
tive, and according to Rodriguez, that percep

tion could be dangerous.
However, Rodriguez wasn't that upset with
the Bakke decision.
"In terms of affirmative action, I don't be
lieve Bakke is a negative decision," said Rod
riguez. He explained that because Bakke for
the first time said that race could be used as a
positive factor, new ground was broken.
Rodriguez said that many minorities disag
ree with his perception of Bakke, feeling that it
was indeed a negative decision, and that a
blow has been struck at them.
"Whether there is a real problem or not, if
they feel that way, there is a problem," said
Rodriguez.
Rodriguez said there seems to be a commit
ment toward affirmative action at the Univer
sity. He said also that there is a "direct correla
tion" between management commitment and
the success of any affirmative action program.
Rodriguez said he believes there is hope for
affirmative action at Stanford.
"I took this job with the assumption that I
could do something — I didn't need this job,"
he said.
Rodriguez was director of intergovernmen
tal relations for the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico before he joined the staff here.
