# New era of exploration to begin
## 
### 
Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP) —
The space shuttle and a new
era of exploration is at hand,
and it can't come soon
enough for the people here
whose job is dispatching men
into the cosmos.
It's been nearly 10 years
since Americans first set foot
on the moon and four years
since the United States last
send men into space. The
launch pads of Mercury and
Gemini and Apollo and
Skylab are silent now, many
gone, their girders sold for
scrap.
The shuttle is a reusable
vehicle capable of making 100
or more round trips into
space. It will be used to carry
up satellites, repair satellites
in orbit and perhaps eventu
ally lead to the first stations
where man can live and work
in space.

The work force at the Ken
nedy Space Center here, at
27,000 in the Apollo heyday,
is down to 10,600. Those left
have watched with envy as
the Russians have regularly
launched men into space,
breaking all American endur
ance records.
America's last manned
space flight was a joint mis
sion with the Soviets in 1975.
Since then, 12 Soyuz craft,
bearing a total of 24 cos
monauts, have rocketed into
orbit.
While watching the
Soviets, the National
Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration (NASA) has been
developing a new manned
craft — the shuttle.
That program reaches a
milestone on Saturday when
a Boeing 747 jet sets down
here. Perched on its back will

be Columbia, the first shuttle
earmarked for space. It is
being ferried cross-country
from the Rockwell Interna
tional plant at Palmdale, Calif.
Thousands of workers and
their families are expected to
turn out to greet it. "They're
excited; you can feel a great
increase in the pulse here,"
center director Lee Scherer
said in an interview.
"Their job is putting men in
space, and finally, they're
going to get another manned
vehicle to work on," he said.
"They can't wait to get their
hands on the damn thing."
Months of work lie ahead
before the shuttle is ready to
fly. The main engines have
to be tested, delivered and
installed. Thermal tiles must
be positioned to protect Col
umbia from searing re-entry
heat. Booster rockets and

fuel tanks must be readied.
The launch is scheduled
Nov. 9. But Scherer conceded
NASA is working on a
"success-oriented" sched
ule.
He said "If there's a prob
lem of any magnitude, it
could cause a delay. We'll
have a better handle on how
we're doing after a couple
months. We're dealing with a
very sophisticated machine
that is pushing the state of the
art, and we won't launch until
we are ready."
The shuttle is a space plane
— a hybrid of rocket, spacec
raft and airplane. After each
flight into space, it will glide
back to a landing on a
three-mile long runway and
be towed to a hangar to be
readied for another trip
within two weeks or so.
Each of the four shuttles

approved by Congress will be
capable of making 100 or
more round trips into space.
The main engine, the most
advanced rocket power plant
ever, is made to burn
supercold liquid hydrogen
and liquid oxygen. Pressures
inside the chamber are four
times greater than those in
the engines that drove Apol
lo's Saturn V rocket.
Columbia's first flight will
be relatively brief, a 54-hour
orbital test. The astronauts
will be John Young, a veteran
of four space trips, including
a moon walk, and Robert
Crippen, a rookie spaceman.
Five or six test flights are
planned before Columbia is
operational, probably inl9Bl.
Then it will be ready to do
things never tried before in
space. The first 28 flights are
sold out to government

agencies, industry and others
who want to put payloads
into orbit.
The shuttles will put satel
lites in space for research,
weather forecasting, com
munications, and military re
connaissance. They will carry
up a small European Space
Agency station called
Spacelab.
The space planes will have
a capacity of hauling up to
65,000 pounds and, once in
orbit, also will launch probes
bound for other planets.
Each shuttle can carry up to
seven people — some of
them women. Six women
currently are in training.
Crewswill be able to repairan
ailing satellite in orbit or
bring it back to Earth for
maintenance, cutting costs
and considerably extending
the lives of many payloads.

He said "If there's a prob
lem of any magnitude, it
could cause a delay. We'll
have a better handle on how
we're doing after a couple
months. We're dealing with a
very sophisticated machine
that is pushing the state of the
art, and we won't launch until
we are ready."
The shuttle is a space plane
— a hybrid of rocket, spacec
raft and airplane. After each
flight into space, it will glide
back to a landing on a
three-mile long runway and
be towed to a hangar to be
readied for another trip
within two weeks or so.
Each of the four shuttles

approved by Congress will be
capable of making 100 or
more round trips into space.
The main engine, the most
advanced rocket power plant
ever, is made to burn
supercold liquid hydrogen
and liquid oxygen. Pressures
inside the chamber are four
times greater than those in
the engines that drove Apol
lo's Saturn V rocket.
Columbia's first flight will
be relatively brief, a 54-hour
orbital test. The astronauts
will be John Young, a veteran
of four space trips, including
a moon walk, and Robert
Crippen, a rookie spaceman.
Five or six test flights are
planned before Columbia is
operational, probably inl9Bl.
Then it will be ready to do
things never tried before in
space. The first 28 flights are
sold out to government

agencies, industry and others
who want to put payloads
into orbit.
The shuttles will put satel
lites in space for research,
weather forecasting, com
munications, and military re
connaissance. They will carry
up a small European Space
Agency station called
Spacelab.
The space planes will have
a capacity of hauling up to
65,000 pounds and, once in
orbit, also will launch probes
bound for other planets.
Each shuttle can carry up to
seven people — some of
them women. Six women
currently are in training.
Crewswill be able to repairan
ailing satellite in orbit or
bring it back to Earth for
maintenance, cutting costs
and considerably extending
the lives of many payloads.
Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP) —
The space shuttle and a new
era of exploration is at hand,
and it can't come soon
enough for the people here
whose job is dispatching men
into the cosmos.
It's been nearly 10 years
since Americans first set foot
on the moon and four years
since the United States last
send men into space. The
launch pads of Mercury and
Gemini and Apollo and
Skylab are silent now, many
gone, their girders sold for
scrap.
The shuttle is a reusable
vehicle capable of making 100
or more round trips into
space. It will be used to carry
up satellites, repair satellites
in orbit and perhaps eventu
ally lead to the first stations
where man can live and work
in space.

The work force at the Ken
nedy Space Center here, at
27,000 in the Apollo heyday,
is down to 10,600. Those left
have watched with envy as
the Russians have regularly
launched men into space,
breaking all American endur
ance records.
America's last manned
space flight was a joint mis
sion with the Soviets in 1975.
Since then, 12 Soyuz craft,
bearing a total of 24 cos
monauts, have rocketed into
orbit.
While watching the
Soviets, the National
Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration (NASA) has been
developing a new manned
craft — the shuttle.
That program reaches a
milestone on Saturday when
a Boeing 747 jet sets down
here. Perched on its back will

be Columbia, the first shuttle
earmarked for space. It is
being ferried cross-country
from the Rockwell Interna
tional plant at Palmdale, Calif.
Thousands of workers and
their families are expected to
turn out to greet it. "They're
excited; you can feel a great
increase in the pulse here,"
center director Lee Scherer
said in an interview.
"Their job is putting men in
space, and finally, they're
going to get another manned
vehicle to work on," he said.
"They can't wait to get their
hands on the damn thing."
Months of work lie ahead
before the shuttle is ready to
fly. The main engines have
to be tested, delivered and
installed. Thermal tiles must
be positioned to protect Col
umbia from searing re-entry
heat. Booster rockets and

fuel tanks must be readied.
The launch is scheduled
Nov. 9. But Scherer conceded
