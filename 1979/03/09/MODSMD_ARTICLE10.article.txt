# Market models intrigue Sharpe
## 
### Philip Kohl 
You probably have never
heard of William Sharpe. You
may never have heard of the
capital asset pricing model
either. But in the financial mar
kets of America both the man
and the model he fathered are
well known.
Sharpe, 44, is a professor of
finance at the Graduate School
of Business. In the early 1960s
he developed the capital asset
pricing model, generally refer
red to as the efficient market
theorem. The model holds that
stock prices reflect the consen
sus of well-informed particip
ants in the market. If prices
happen to diverge significantly
from this informed consensus,
professional investors will buy
or sell accordingly until the
price reaches equilibrium.
The implication of the theory
is that it is impossible to consis
tently outperform the broad
stock market averages. The
theory has since been con
firmed by several empirical
studies.
Had it not been for rejection
of his initial Ph.D. thesis prop
osal, Sharpe might never have
developed the model. While
working toward an economics
doctorate at UCLA, he wrote a
100-page thesis proposal on
transfer pricing which Jack Hir
shleifer, a well known
economist and Sharpe's ad
viser, termed unexciting.
Disillusioned, Sharpe
sought out Harry Markowitz,
another UCLA economist, who
was working in the area of
portfolio theory. Markowitz
helped Sharpe get started in
this field, and several years
later Sharpe published his
path-breaking 1964 article in
the Journal of Finance - "Capi
tal Asset Prices — A Theory of
Market Equilibrium Under
Conditions of Risk."
That article was published
while Sharpe was teaching at
the University of Washington.
He then taught at UC-lrvine for
two years before coming to
Stanford in 1970.
Here Sharpe has developed
a reputation for outstanding
teaching, with students
evaluating his investments and
micro-economics classes as
being among the best courses
in the school.
"Sharpe has the ability to
make a complicated theory
understandable," says David
Brown, a Ph.D. student in fi
nance.
Robert Litzenberger, profes
sor of finance at the business
school, echoes Brown's senti
ments. "Sharpe's courses have
a strong theoretical compo
nent, but are still popular with
MBAs. That's rare at the busi
ness school."
A visit to one of Sharpe's

classes demonstrates the
reasons for his popularity. At
5-foot-8, with a blond goatee
and mustache, he looks some
thing like Rembrandt. His eyes
twinkling, he begins to search
the Wall Street Journal for the
options quotations. According
to students / he often uses the
financial press to illustrate
concepts.
But he also loves to chide the
press. When he reads state
ments like "stocks tumbled in a
wave of selling," he points out
that for every seller there must
also be a buyer.
On this day he puts the quo
tation for Honeywell call op
tions on the board and then
explains the meaning of each
part of the quotation. Looks of
befuddlement have been re
placed by nods of comprehen
sion. Sharpe has struck again.
"My competitive advantage
is to translate the complicated
theoretical work going on in
the field," he says.
Sharpe failed to mention
another competitive advantage
— his sense of humor. During a
brief discussion of "Carter
bonds" — bonds sold by the
U.S. to Germans — Sharpe re
marked, "by the time we have
to repay them they will be
Brown or Regan bonds."

Sharpe is not personally in
volved in the markets."I do no
investing, other than in index
funds," he says. Those funds
include the College Retire
ment Equities Fund, of which
he is a trustee.
"It's more intellectually in
teresting to build models than
to invest," he says.
The discovery aspect of
model building intrigues
Sharpe. "I like massaging the
information, buiiding the
model, and having something
come out of it. It's like poetry."
Sharpe uses his models to do
consulting for Wells Fargo
Bank and other clients. He is
also developing the computer
software for a portfolio man
agement system that may be
used on the business school's
computer and incorporated in
the investments course. He is
also considering the possibility
of adding his own computer
hardware and commercially
marketing the total system.
Sharpe's skills extend out
side the academic realm; Lit
zenberger describes him as an
excellent sailor. Sharpe says he
enjoys playing classical guitar
for his wife Roberta and 16-
year-old son, Jonathan, at their
Palo Alto home. Daughter De
borah, 19, is a student at UC-

Santa Barbara.
When asked about future
plans, Sharpe expresses the
desire to spend more time with
his family and pursue his hob
bies. But he doesn't expect that
to happen in the near future.
The portfolio system and revi
sion of two of his five
textbooks will continue to
keep him busy.
Sharpe doesn't seem to
mind. "I'm past mid-life crisis
and I like what I do," he says.
