# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Cathy Gewertz Androgyny should be realized 
### 
Each of us has more than one
voice. Inside us are voices of all
pitches and motivations guid
ing our thoughts and actions.
Though feminism has helped
to enlarge the number of ac
ceptable voices or ways of being
inside women's heads, by and
large men and worsen are still
confined by specific mind-sets
which go home with us from
the hospital as we lie wrapped
snugly in our girlish-pink or
boyish-blue blankets.
From early on we learn
which voices we should follow
and which to ignore*. Only cer
tain behaviors and attitudes,
we learn, are acceptable for
our sex. This socialization is
geared to acceptance in a
world in exceptions to
the rule are odd people out.
Feminism recognized the
limits such values place on
women, who are expected to
be nurturing (yet still depen
dent), all-forgiving, intuitive
and "emotional." Pre
feminism (and still surprisingly
often now), any woman who
differed from the mold was ap
propriately labeled and os
tracized.
Similarly, men are restricted
in the role classically assigned
to them. According to the lore
(which, due to the absence of a
comprehensive men's move
ment has perpetuated itself),
men must bear the world's
stress, always remaining calm,
strong and capable. There is no
place for weakness, tender

ness or sensitivity in the classic
male role.
Though more men now are
sensing the restrictions of this
role, it is difficult to break away
from it in a society which prom
ises suspicion as a reward for
doing so.
Consequently, women must
learn to downplay the asser
tive, intelligent, independent
voices inside them, and men
must ignore any tendencies
toward sensitivity and gentle
ness. If we don't counteract
those voices, we learn, the op
posite sex will not find us at
tractive and marry us so we can
live happily ever after.
So, in a society which lauds
romantic love even to the exc
lusion of individual fulfillment,
women must keep smiling and
curtseying and men must grit
their teeth and "Be Strong."
We can see this dynamic in
motion around us here at the
University. Many women find
it necessary to balance their as
sertive intellects with extra
doses of something classically
feminine (and thus accepta
ble). The struggle to remain
"feminine" appears to me to
be unnecessarily desperate
and contrived; it is ridiculous
that strength and intelligence
should decrease attractiveness
in women.
The flip side of the question
concerns the incredible deli
cacy of the male-role ego
which rests on superiority to
women. The utter ridiculous
ness of the roles is illustrated
when a man confronted with
his female intellectual match
feels sexually stripped, or
when a woman feels she has to
deny her intellect or her opin
ions to be attractive to a man.
Why must we cling to these
ridiculous, arbitrary and li
mited notions of what are at
tractive qualities? Why must
we divide and categorize so
that we limit our experience
and create two polar sexes
where never the twain shall
meet?

It has long been time for a
more androgynous person; a
person without sexual bound
aries or expectations. Human
beings have limitless potential
and innumerable qualities,
most of which are inhibited by
the oppressive order we've
created for ourselves. We per
petuate this order because it's
mentally easier; it's simpler to
be able to file everyone into
neat male/female categories,
eliminating as "sick" those
who deviate; it's easy, but it's

limiting.
Let us strive toward the reali
zation of our androgynous na
tures, in which each person
freely expresses the strength,
tenderness, confidence and
weakness inside, regardless of
gender; in which we love
others for their emotional,
spiritual and intellectual
beauty, without restriction and
without fear.

Each of us has more than one
voice. Inside us are voices of all
pitches and motivations guid
ing our thoughts and actions.
Though feminism has helped
to enlarge the number of ac
ceptable voices or ways of being
inside women's heads, by and
large men and worsen are still
confined by specific mind-sets
which go home with us from
the hospital as we lie wrapped
snugly in our girlish-pink or
boyish-blue blankets.
From early on we learn
which voices we should follow
and which to ignore*. Only cer
tain behaviors and attitudes,
we learn, are acceptable for
our sex. This socialization is
geared to acceptance in a
world in exceptions to
the rule are odd people out.
Feminism recognized the
limits such values place on
women, who are expected to
be nurturing (yet still depen
dent), all-forgiving, intuitive
and "emotional." Pre
feminism (and still surprisingly
often now), any woman who
differed from the mold was ap
propriately labeled and os
tracized.
Similarly, men are restricted
in the role classically assigned
to them. According to the lore
(which, due to the absence of a
comprehensive men's move
ment has perpetuated itself),
men must bear the world's
stress, always remaining calm,
strong and capable. There is no
place for weakness, tender

ness or sensitivity in the classic
male role.
Though more men now are
sensing the restrictions of this
role, it is difficult to break away
from it in a society which prom
ises suspicion as a reward for
doing so.
Consequently, women must
learn to downplay the asser
tive, intelligent, independent
voices inside them, and men
must ignore any tendencies
toward sensitivity and gentle
ness. If we don't counteract
those voices, we learn, the op
posite sex will not find us at
tractive and marry us so we can
live happily ever after.
So, in a society which lauds
romantic love even to the exc
lusion of individual fulfillment,
women must keep smiling and
curtseying and men must grit
their teeth and "Be Strong."
We can see this dynamic in
motion around us here at the
University. Many women find
it necessary to balance their as
sertive intellects with extra
doses of something classically
feminine (and thus accepta
ble). The struggle to remain
"feminine" appears to me to
be unnecessarily desperate
and contrived; it is ridiculous
that strength and intelligence
should decrease attractiveness
in women.
The flip side of the question
concerns the incredible deli
cacy of the male-role ego
which rests on superiority to
women. The utter ridiculous
ness of the roles is illustrated
when a man confronted with
his female intellectual match
feels sexually stripped, or
when a woman feels she has to
deny her intellect or her opin
ions to be attractive to a man.
Why must we cling to these
ridiculous, arbitrary and li
mited notions of what are at
tractive qualities? Why must
we divide and categorize so
that we limit our experience
and create two polar sexes
where never the twain shall
meet?

It has long been time for a
more androgynous person; a
person without sexual bound
aries or expectations. Human
beings have limitless potential
and innumerable qualities,
most of which are inhibited by
the oppressive order we've
created for ourselves. We per
petuate this order because it's
mentally easier; it's simpler to
be able to file everyone into
neat male/female categories,
eliminating as "sick" those
who deviate; it's easy, but it's

limiting.
Let us strive toward the reali
zation of our androgynous na
tures, in which each person
freely expresses the strength,
tenderness, confidence and
weakness inside, regardless of
gender; in which we love
others for their emotional,
spiritual and intellectual
beauty, without restriction and
without fear.
