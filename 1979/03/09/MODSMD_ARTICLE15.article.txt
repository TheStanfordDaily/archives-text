## Change focus of 'tube'

In recent years, the television media has been
harshly criticized by concerned parents and
other consumer groups for presumed adverse
effects upon children. Specifically, violence in
cartoons and other programs intended for the
young viewing audience has come under attack.
Long hours of television viewing have been
incriminated as the reason for declining creativ
ity and academic performance both in school
and on objective tests. Most recently, proposals
to ban advertising during children's programs
have arisen from an awareness that certain food
products may predispose viewers to dental
problems and obesity, as well as poor adult eat
ing habits.
Although these arguments have been sup
ported by behavioral and medical research and
are certainly justified, there has been an appa
rent failure of the critics to realize that the media
may be used in a positive manner. If children are
indeed at the mercy of the television, why not
use it to influence behavior in a constructive,
rather than detrimental, fashion?
Before the average American child enters the
first grade, he or she has viewed 5000 hours of
television. By high school graduation, a typical
teenager will have logged at least 15,000 hours
— more time than is spent on any other activity
except sleep. Fifty percent more time is spent
with television than in the classroom. One study
showed that youngsters spend more than one
third of their waking hours in front of the TV
screen.
Television can and should be utilized advan
tageously as a powerful tool to shape the per
sonality of the growing child and adolescent. In
her recent article "A Nation of Vidkids," Dr.
Alberta Siegel of the Psychology Department
here states: "Television watching gives the child
models of behavior to imitate and the child does
imitate these models."
Rather than limit or ban children's exposure
to what critics often term the "boob tube," crea
tion of new, more acceptable models is indi
cated.
One area which presently deserves emphasis
is substance abuse on the part of children and
adolescents. While use of tobacco, alcohol,
marijuana and illicit drugs has been increasing at
an alarming rate among the population, the age
at which such abuse begins has been decreas
ing.
More commercials by well-known athletes,
music stars and other idols of youth should warn
of the potential dangers of these substances and
be aired at times when children are likely to see
them. The American Cancer Society needs to
shift its emphasis from the ingrained adult
smoker, already well-aware of the dangers of
the habit, to young people experimenting with

cigarettes as a result of peer pressure.
These messages could also be incorporated in
to cartoons and other programs viewed by chil
dren, via what might be called the "Popeye prin
ciple." Millions of kids, myself included,
learned to eat spinach because it made Popeye a
strong sailor; similarly, little people of today
should be told that Spiderman and Superman
have no vices.
Another area where television might be used
constructively is that of nutrition and exercise,
important in preventive medicine and the de
velopment of good adult health habits. It is not
enough to eliminate the promotion of sugar
sweetened breakfast cereal, soft drinks, candy
bars and other junk food. Commercials promot
ing fresh fruit, nutritious cereals, and other sen
sible foods are indicated, as well as public ser
vice messages encouraging regular physical
exercise.
In this instance, product manufacturers are as
much at fault as the media, for it is certainly
possible to create nutritious, good-tasting foods
and make them appealing to children. Many
unsweetened, vitamin-fortified cereals cur
rently exist, but how many kids are likely to ask
Mom for something called "Grape Nuts" or
"Shredded Wheat," advertised by a middle
aged man?
Through television, today's younger genera
tion has the world at its doorstep: the moon
walks, Olympic games, great political events,
qualityentertainmentand professional sports. It
can also be used advantageously in the realm of
formal education. For example, a study in 1970
showed that three to five-year-old youngsters
from a variety of backgrounds acquired simple
and complex cognitive skills as a result of watch
ing Sesame Street.
Clearly, more educational broadcasts aimed
at young people of all ages would be beneficial,
but parents also have an important role in this
area. Selective viewing which allows the child to
have some input is essential, and discussions of
programs and commercials viewed are useful in
facilitating the learning process.
Finally, as part of the viewing audience, pa
rents have a right and responsibility to protest
programs and commercials likely to have a de
trimental influence on children. Local stations
and networks can be informed when they have
gone too far, and sponsors may be notified that
offensive programs will not move their mer
chandise into our homes.
The message: "Warning: television may be
hazardous to your child's health" may not be
entirely valid. It is not the device itself but rather
how it is utilized which can and should be
changed to protect American youth.

velopment of good adult health habits. It is not
enough to eliminate the promotion of sugar
sweetened breakfast cereal, soft drinks, candy
bars and other junk food. Commercials promot
ing fresh fruit, nutritious cereals, and other sen
sible foods are indicated, as well as public ser
vice messages encouraging regular physical
exercise.
In this instance, product manufacturers are as
much at fault as the media, for it is certainly
possible to create nutritious, good-tasting foods
and make them appealing to children. Many
unsweetened, vitamin-fortified cereals cur
rently exist, but how many kids are likely to ask
Mom for something called "Grape Nuts" or
"Shredded Wheat," advertised by a middle
aged man?
Through television, today's younger genera
tion has the world at its doorstep: the moon
walks, Olympic games, great political events,
qualityentertainmentand professional sports. It
can also be used advantageously in the realm of
formal education. For example, a study in 1970
showed that three to five-year-old youngsters
from a variety of backgrounds acquired simple
and complex cognitive skills as a result of watch
ing Sesame Street.
Clearly, more educational broadcasts aimed
at young people of all ages would be beneficial,
but parents also have an important role in this
area. Selective viewing which allows the child to
have some input is essential, and discussions of
programs and commercials viewed are useful in
facilitating the learning process.
Finally, as part of the viewing audience, pa
rents have a right and responsibility to protest
programs and commercials likely to have a de
trimental influence on children. Local stations
and networks can be informed when they have
gone too far, and sponsors may be notified that
offensive programs will not move their mer
chandise into our homes.
The message: "Warning: television may be
hazardous to your child's health" may not be
entirely valid. It is not the device itself but rather
how it is utilized which can and should be
changed to protect American youth.

In recent years, the television media has been
harshly criticized by concerned parents and
other consumer groups for presumed adverse
effects upon children. Specifically, violence in
cartoons and other programs intended for the
young viewing audience has come under attack.
Long hours of television viewing have been
incriminated as the reason for declining creativ
ity and academic performance both in school
and on objective tests. Most recently, proposals
to ban advertising during children's programs
have arisen from an awareness that certain food
products may predispose viewers to dental
problems and obesity, as well as poor adult eat
ing habits.
Although these arguments have been sup
ported by behavioral and medical research and
are certainly justified, there has been an appa
rent failure of the critics to realize that the media
may be used in a positive manner. If children are
indeed at the mercy of the television, why not
use it to influence behavior in a constructive,
rather than detrimental, fashion?
Before the average American child enters the
first grade, he or she has viewed 5000 hours of
television. By high school graduation, a typical
teenager will have logged at least 15,000 hours
— more time than is spent on any other activity
except sleep. Fifty percent more time is spent
with television than in the classroom. One study
showed that youngsters spend more than one
third of their waking hours in front of the TV
screen.
Television can and should be utilized advan
tageously as a powerful tool to shape the per
sonality of the growing child and adolescent. In
her recent article "A Nation of Vidkids," Dr.
Alberta Siegel of the Psychology Department
here states: "Television watching gives the child
models of behavior to imitate and the child does
imitate these models."
Rather than limit or ban children's exposure
to what critics often term the "boob tube," crea
tion of new, more acceptable models is indi
cated.
One area which presently deserves emphasis
is substance abuse on the part of children and
adolescents. While use of tobacco, alcohol,
marijuana and illicit drugs has been increasing at
an alarming rate among the population, the age
at which such abuse begins has been decreas
ing.
More commercials by well-known athletes,
music stars and other idols of youth should warn
of the potential dangers of these substances and
be aired at times when children are likely to see
them. The American Cancer Society needs to
shift its emphasis from the ingrained adult
smoker, already well-aware of the dangers of
the habit, to young people experimenting with

cigarettes as a result of peer pressure.
These messages could also be incorporated in
to cartoons and other programs viewed by chil
dren, via what might be called the "Popeye prin
ciple." Millions of kids, myself included,
learned to eat spinach because it made Popeye a
strong sailor; similarly, little people of today
should be told that Spiderman and Superman
have no vices.
