Editorial challenged
I read with some amusement
"The 17 percent Solution,"
(Daily, Mar. 1) which criticized
the ASSU Senate's "preoccu
pation with the Coors issue."
Certainly the Daily is entitled to
its opinion (in this case one
with which I disagree), just as I
am entitled to mine (though
the Daily's seems to carry more
weight as long as they create —
excuse me, report - the news).
I am having a hard time tel
ling whether the Daily thinks
that the senate ought to drop
the issue or that the student
community should stop paying
attention to this 'trivial' matter.
Speaking for the boycott
committee, I would tend to
agree with the notion that the
senate has lots to do in the way
of direct student activities; we,
however, will surely not drop
the issue — we are taking our
efforts directly to the students,
with a good deal of success.
I chanced to look through
the ASSU Constitution after
reading the editorial, and
noticed that "The senate shall
consist of 20 members, 10 un
dergraduate and 10 graduate."
I read it again, and To and be
hold, it still read 20; regardless
of how many alternates or vis
itors show up for a meeting,
the maximum number of votes
allowed to be cast is 20 (or 21, if
the Chair votes to break a tie).
Now I am not a math major,
but I do remember my long di
vision from the third grade and
so I dug out a pencil and paper
and embarked on some seri
ous calculating. If you divide
five (the number of senators
who voted on the Coors task
force issue) by 20 (the
maximum number of votes that
may be cast) you will probably
get 25 percent.
Now either the Daily knows
something I don't about the
senate, the constitution, or
mathematics, or they decided
that hyperbole in the good
name of editorial discretion is a
just journalistic technique.
Perhaps it is the same "new
math" that causes the Daily to
sit on a $100,000 reserve fund
while claiming that they can't
survive without our fee as
sessment dollars. Until the
Daily can demonstrate that
they have learned to count, I
will have to stop counting on
the Daily for the accurate pre
sentation of information.

Undeclared Sophomore
Editor's not*: Milner should
check his facts before accusing
us of not checking ours. The 17
percent figure comes from five
votes of 30 senators and alter
nates eligible to vote this year -
eligible, that is, assuming they
are in attendance. Some 25

were not, thus "The 17percent
solution."
But let's assume Milner's fi
gures are correct. That means
that instead of 83 percent, a
mere 75 percent of our elected
representatives were absent.
Simply superb!
Unfortunately, Milner be
labors the mathematics. The
numbers, correct or incorrect,
are totally peripheral to the is
sue. We think the senate con
sideration of the Coors issue is
and was misguided. Hairsplit
ting on how numbers are calcu
lated is a feeble attempt to
color the true issue.
If Milner wishes to quote
from the ASSU Constitution,
he might also note Article 11,
section 5 which states that "11
regular members of the senate
shall constitute a quorum to
conduct business." I am not a
math major either, but I re
member that five is less than
77, all trivial percentages ig
nored.
It would behoove Milner to
learn a little something about
the Daily before speaking.
First of all, our reserve fund
goal was reached only last year,
and the goal was set following a
disastrous period here during
which the Daily nearly went
bankrupt. The $100,000 figure
of which you speak was one
suggested by the administra
tion.
We make no pretense about
requiring the fee assessment
money to "survive." We can
and will survive without it, if
necessary.
You should note however,
that generally since its incep
tion, the fee assessment and
similar fees collected from fa
culty and staff has meant the
difference between profit and
loss in a given year. Without it,
by now the Daily would likely
be in bankruptcy. Now with a
healthy reserve, we are able to
start doing some of the things
we have wanted to do for years
to help make the Daily truly a
training ground for new jour
nalists.
This year we have increased
our paper size 1.75 pages per
day, and our financial stability
has allowed us to raise our
editorial staff salaries to the
"excessive" level of $1 per hour
for top editors.
It is not clear to me - or, evi
dently, the students, since the
Daily last year received an
overwhelming 85 percent ap
proval of its fee assessment re
quest - that asking students to
pay a mere 2 cents per issue, a
fully refundable amount, is out
of line. Moreover, the students
have been fully informed of our
financial position as it was pub
lished in the paper (Daily, Feb.
23).
Consider this openness from

an independent corporation,
then think about the last time
your student association,
which holds some $350,000 in
reserves, told you anything
substantive about its finances.
As to the charge that we
create the news, I consider the
comment unfortunate, clearly
made by a person who knows,
at best, very little about our op
eration. The Daily staff works
quite hard to put out what is,
believe it or not, generally con
sidered to be an outstanding
college journalistic product.
Milner's comment is neither
reasonable, nor fair.
Moreover, readers should
note that one excellent way to
change our coverage focus is
from within. Everyone and
anyone is welcome to join our
staff.

Unique
sororities
The recent Daily article on
the attempt of sororities at
Stanford to gain University
recognition (Feb. 15) brings
into focus perhaps the most
controversial aspect of their
existence here — the national
policy that some groups use
letters of recommendation
during the rushing process.
In claiming that sororities
who desire a particular wo
man's membership can "work
around" such requirements, it
seems to me that these women
are losing sight of their earlier
argument in favor of the return
of sororities to campus — that
women here would be build
ing a Greek system different
from that of other colleges.
I respect the right of these
women to form organizations
within which they can seek the
support, friendship and com
pany of other women. I even
support their right to be af
filiated with larger national or
ganizations.
But to me, the bottom line of
claims of a different sorority
system here will be a request
from these women that their
national organizations relieve
them of the necessity of letters
of recommendation. Clearly,
these letters can only be used
to classify, divide and an
tagonize women currently at
Stanford. They release
sororities from the necessity of
building their membership
from a wide cross-section of
the University population.
I do not doubt the good in
tentions of women currently in
these sororities. I accept in
good faith their contention
that ways can be foynd to
admit women who are unable

to procure the necessary let
ters. But the character of
groups can and does change.
What assurance do we have
that five years hence they will
be so willing to circumvent na
tional practice?
It is a fact that at least one of
the sororities currently existing
here does misrepresent itself
on another college campus. It
does allow women without let
ters to complete the rushing
process without ever telling
them that without these re
commendations, they will not
seriously be considered for
membership. Once current
sorority members have
graduated from Stanford, what
is to guard against the tempta
tion that similar practices be
used here?
We are assumedly selected
to come here on the basis of
records demonstrating high
academic achievement,
proven leadership qualities
and a high level of extracurricu
lar involvement. What further
recommendation should na
tional organizations need?
I appeal to sorority women
here to seek adjustment of na
tional guidelines for the situa
tion here. If such adjustment is
impossible, perhaps these
women can remain connected
to nationals on an associate or
affiliated basis, instead of as
chapter members.
If this is in turn impossible,
perhaps sororities will have
been proven not to be in the
best interests of the University
community. For this last must
be the decisive judgment —
whether sororities can conduct
themselves in ways to the be
nefit of thecommunity at large.
If some nationals persist in
their demands that Stanford
women continue practices
which determine their mem
berships elsewhere, I see little
possibility for Stanford's soror
ity system remaining truly un
ique.

Credit due
Although we have no quarrel
with the essential content of
Fran Miller's article "Student
loan default declines 2 per
cent" (Daily, March 5), we
would like to emphasize and
expand upon an important
point.
Administering the student
loan program is a double
headed venture: applications
are processed and loans au
thorized by the Financial Aids
Office, while the proceeds of
the loans are disbursed, then
later collected the Student

Accounting Office. This sound
business practice follows both
federal law and good banking
procedures. The hand that au
thorizes a loan should not de
liver the money, nor receive it
again.
Therefore, it is dear that a
substantial portion of the cre
dit for lowering the delin
quency rate on student loans
here goes to the collection op
erations of the Student Ac
counting Office, managed by
Alan Scott and Bursar Joseph
Jedd. Their diligence should be
recognized, particularly by the
current recipients of student
loans.
The benefit of Stanford's low
delinquency rate is that the
University will have access to
loan capital in the largest pos
sible amounts to which it is en
titled. Without such a solid col
lection effort the availability of
loans for current and future
students would be severely
jeopardized.

Union lettuce
One paragraph of the Eas
tham, Fylstra and Kisker article
(Daily, Feb. 22) strikes me as
being extremely insensitive.
Sure, the ASSU Senate is not
going to send a task force out
to verify that Food Service let
tuce is union lettuce.
But that does not mean that
we shouldn't be concerned
that students may be served
nonunion lettuce, for not to
complain about exploitation of
workers is to tacitly endorse it.
That is the reason why the
ASSU should make abundantly
clear that it wishes to have no
dealings with Coors, South Af
rica and others whose actions
are unethical (unless they
clean up their act).
Back in the early 1970s when
the first United Farmworkers'
lettuce strike occurred, it was
students like you and me who
led the lettuce boycotts in
California, Texas and across
the country. It took a lot of
courage and dedication to get
involved, the kind of courage
the Daily of today now asks us
not to show.
At MIT, there's a sign at the
entrance to every dining room
on campus that reads, "To
day's lettuce has been picked
by the United Farm Workers." I
have yet to see one of those
signs at Stanford. Perhaps they
don't care as much here.
