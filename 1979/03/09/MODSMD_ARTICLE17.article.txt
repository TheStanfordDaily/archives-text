# The
						evolution of the ASSU Senate
## 
### Carl Chamberlin News Analysis 
After a drunk Stanford stu
dent was involved in a fatal
off-campus shooting in 1908,
University administrators pas
sed a decree prohibiting liquor
on campus. Little did they
know their action was trigger
ing the formation of a student
organization that would even
tually become known as the
ASSU Senate.
The 1908 liquor ban created
student protests, parades and
assemblies. Students even
threatened not to attend class
until the prohibition was lifted.
And as the faculty-student rela
tionship continued to de
teriorate, the student body
realized the need for a
stronger, more efficient stu
dent government.
Since the University's open
ing in 1891 the student gov
ernment had consisted of only
a student body president and
vice president who rep
resented the few hundred stu
dents of the University.
Its control rested primarily in
the hand? of the faculty.
Accordingly, a University
Conference formed after the
1908 action. Composed of onl/
a few upperclassmen, the con

ference represented the initial
attempt at student self-control.
Within this structure, a Men's
Council and Women's Council
were formed in 1921, charged
with judicial responsibilities.
Student government con
tinued to evolve during the
first half of the 1900s. By the
19405, student government in
cluded an Executive Commit
tee headed by the student
body president and vice presi
dent who directed executive
and legislative action. The two
five-member Men's and Wo
men's Councils served as the
judicial branch.
The Executive Committee
became the Legislature of the
Associated Students of Stan
ford University(LASSU) in the
1960s and at one point, was
composed of 150 representa
tives. In 1969, LASSU was re
formed and its name was
changed to the ASSU Senate.
justas the government struc
ture has changed, so too has
the means of student represen
tation. Initially, students were
elected according to their de
partment majors. Later rep
resentatives were elected by
living groups. By the 19405, the
campus had been divided into
districts, and a number of rep

resentatives were elected from
each district.
Today the ASSU Senate
serves the student body
through 20 senators and 20 al
ternate senators, positions
which are usually divided
equally between graduate and
undergraduate students,
though there are no alternate
graduate senators at this time.
The alternates may engage in
senate debate but may vote
only in case of a regular
senator's absence.
The senate has periodically
attempted to deal with rep
resentation difficulties during
its brief history. In November,
1976, for example, the senate
voted to meet in University re
sidences rather than in
Graduate School of Business in
an attempt to encourage stu
dent participation and atten
dance. This year, the senate
has implemented a
representation-by-district sys
tem, with each senator or al
ternate representing a particu
lar district composed of about
250 constituents. Senators are
also required to attend house
meetings within their district.
Ted Cardenswartz and Ron
Johnson, current ASSU
senators and co-authors of the

districting proposal, report
that the success of such a plan
depends upon the commit
ments of the individual
senators. For those who com
mit themselves to the project,
it has been successful, accord
ing to Johnson.
The concerns of student
governments have also
changed over the years. Can

honorcode and judicial system
and promoting spirit. Presi
dential candidates in 1968, on
the other hand, focused on de
veloping a concert series and a
day care center and increasing
minority admissions. They also
demanded that the University
condemn the use of violence
as a political tool.
The 1975-76 senate showed a
different emphasis. A Daily ar
ticle summarized that year's

senate performance as one of
"introspective re-evaluation,"
dedicated to "taking care of
run-of-the-mill ASSU man
agement and planning reform
measures for future senates."
The Daily cited the senate's in
itiation of a night shuttle-bus
service, yet pointed out that
other actions, such as investi
gations of the University park
ing system and department
budget committees, never

"blossomed into plans of ac
tion."
In theory, through the ASSU
Constitution, the senate has
been given considerable po
tential power. It has the ulti
mate budget-making authority
of the student association, and
it has the power to interpret the
Constitution, to enact, amend
or repeal by-laws to the Con
stitution, to make laws govern
ing student elections and to

appoint committees. The se
nate is the vehicle by which
student viewpoint may have an
effect on nearly all aspects of
University life.
The senate's effectiveness in
employing this power, how
ever, has occasionally been
contested. Last fall, the Com
mittee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos (CRAP) proposal, cal
ling for the abolishment of the
ASSU Senate, was placed be
fore the voters, and defeated in
the fall balloting.
Doug Bandow, a major
proponent and initiator of the
proposal, explains that the
CRAP amendment would have
"eliminated the senate totally
and shifted their duties to the
Council of Presidents (COP),"
and would have created a fi
nance committee to help the
COP in formulating the
budget. Bandow, an ASSU
senator for two years, said he
cameto the conclusion thatthe
senate was "totally futile, and
the ASSU would be better
without it." The senate "de
graded the reputation of the
entire student government and
was looked upon with con
tempt."
Current senate chairperson
Pete Stamos outlined the

three-fold purposes of this
year's senate. As with any se
nate, he explained, there is a
responsibility as the governing
body of the ASSU both to legis
late and to "educate in terms of
providing a forum for debate."
For this year, Stamos con
tinues, there is a need for the
senate, "because of the pre
sence of slates last year and
joke slates the year before," to
re-establish responsibility and
representativeness.
Stamos described the major
contributions of this year's se
nate as being the districting
system, senate attendance re
quirements and a system of fi
nance, rules and student affairs
committees which facilitate the
efficiency of the senate meet
ings. Stamos, a junior, points
to the newly formed Con
sumer Affairs Task Force as
"perhaps the best contribution
of the senate since I've been
here at Stanford." The senate is
also working on election re
form procedures, considering
rewriting the constitution, and
obtaining lights for the Univer
sity tennis courts.
Bandow said he hasn't been
"terribly impressed" with the
senate's accomplishments this
year.
