## Two local variations on a French theme 
### 
Wild Strawberries
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto,CA
321-7525
Nothing exceptional, but
still something nice. That's
Wild Strawberries, Town &
Country's newest addition to
the local dining scene.
Just opened a month ago in
what was formerly Pistachio's
Restaurant, Wild Strawberries
is owned by SAGA Foods, the
well-known supplier of college
dorm fare. But unlike most
franchise operations, Wild
Strawberries resists definition.
Between entryway, dining
room and bar there is an in
teresting, if not somewhat un
easy, mix of gourmet deli,
French ambiance, and space
age-like bar. Even the menu is
out of step; seated amidst crisp

white li:ien, fresh bouquets,
ar.d nrractive prints, you ex
pect escargot, boeuf bour
gogne, and creme au caramel.
Instead, Wild Strawberries
presents a healthful array of
salads, cheese boards and
quiches. The choice is not un
pleasant, only surprising; in
deed, Wild Strawberries offers
an appealing alternative to re
staurants within a similar price
range (the Good Earth, Mama
Ney's, and Chef Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a seri
ous following. Here the display
of marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming
back for more. With eight or
nine different offerings at any
one time and thick loaves of
sweet french bread you can

slice your own piece from, the
possibility that you'll go away
hungry just doesn't exist. Salad
is included in the price of all
dinner items, (with no limit on
how many times you can go
back to refill your plate), or can
be ordered separately for
$4.25. Another special touch is
the glass of wine served while
you wait for your table.
The dinner menu lists eight
entrees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp
curry for $8.25 and the
$1,000,000 Board priced at $8,
an exquisite presentation of
red caviar, whole artichoke,
chilled smoked salmon, and
brie cheese served with a split
of champagne. Notable among
the first group are a cheese
fondue ($8.25 for two), and the
Middle Eastern Board with stuf
fed grape leaves, feta cheese,
and pita bread available for
$5.10. Unfortunately, the
Spinach Quiche, a popular
choice at $4.25, is a disap
pointment. Although com
plemented with crisp broccoli
spears and sauteed slices of
winter squash, this too-plainly
seasoned version of an oft
copied French recipe was
even served lukewarm, (a situ
ation our waitress quickly re
medied, but one which never
should have happened in the
first place). Specials of the day
are also offered; the evening
we were there a choice of
either crab omelette or baked
cod with bearnaise sauce was
available in addition to the
regular selection. The house
wine is Mirrasou and can be
ordered by the half, quarter, or
full litre. ($4.50 a litre)
Desserts are simple and re
flect a preference for "the or
ganic." Strawberries and fro
zen yogurt ($1.75),
homemade zucchini
cake ($1.25) and a fruit and
cheese board ($2.50) are all
good choices. Orange pekoe
tea, espresso and panache
(beer mixed with lemon
syrup), continue the restaur
ant's somewhat ambiguous ba
lance between what's good for
you' & 'what's in' (the cham
pagne cocktail made with
guava nectar listed at the top of
the menu seems to say it all).
Nevertheless, despite obvious
shortcomings, Wild Strawber
ries brings both a sophisticated
accent to "things naturale" and
a fantastic salad bar to Town &
Country Village.

L'Omelette
4170 E! Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6812
L'Omelette, after undergo
ing many changes in recent
years, has emerged under the
direction of owner-chef Louis
Borel as a fine French restaur
ant serving excellent food in a
friendly and efficient manner.
Although arriving at the
busiest time of the week, my
companion and I were
promptly seated. The fireplace
behind us together with the
candlelit table, high beamed
ceilings and plush maroon car
pet and drapes created a very
warm atmosphere that helped
make the evening that fol
lowed a very special one.
Our waiter, Jacques, im
mediately introduced himselt
and promised to help us "keep
a smile on our face" through
out the evening. He kept his
promise. When asked "What
do you suggest?", Jacques re
sponded "my telephone
number." That was only the
beginning — Jacques was quite
a character all evening long.
But his flamboyant style in no
way detracted from his profes
sional service. Jacques is defi
nitely worth asking for when
dining at L'Omelette.
Dinner at L'Omelette in
cludes soup du jour, salad,
fresh vegetable du jour and
potato or rice. Also available
for an extra charge are any of
the ten appetizers, onion soup
gratinee, a large array of de
sserts, a choice of beverages
and any selection from the
eight page wine list.
My companion and I started
our meal by sharing an order of
Crepe de Fruits de Mer, Nantua
($3.95), a seafood crepe stuffed
with shrimp, scallops and
mushrooms and covered with
a lobster sauce.This appetizer,
also available as a dinner en
tree, was exceptional. It was so
good in fact that we were later
sorry that we hadn't chosen
one of the many fish selec
tions, all fresh, as a dinner en
tree.
But indecision when choos
ing a main course at L'Omelet
te must not be uncommon as
the dinner menu is both varied
and extensive. In addition to
the regular offerings, which in
clude such diverse choices as
Paupiette de Sole
Deauw//e(59.75), fillet of sole
with creamed lobster sauce,
mushrooms and shrimp, and
Civet de Lapin, Chasseur

($8.95), rabbit, hunter's style,
L'Omelette serves a variety of
house specialties that change
daily. On the evening of our
visit, the specialties offered
were Cote de Boeuf Bearnaise
($27.50 for two), grilled and
seasoned prime ribs with
Bearnaise sauce, Fillet of Sole a
la Varenne ($10.95), fillet of
fresh sole stuffed with spinach
and mushrooms, and Fresh Sea
Bass, St. Michel{% 11.25) a
Brittany dish stuffed with
mousse of salmon.
Although the specialties, de
scribed in detail by Jacques, all
sounded inviting, my compan
ion and I chose two entrees
from the regular menu —
Canard a la Normande ($9.95)
(roast duckling with fresh ap
ples),and Fscalope de Veau
Forstiere (slo.so),white milk
fed veal with wild mushrooms.
Both the duck and the veal
were of high quality and were
excellently prepared. But these
dishes are standard restaurant
fare; they were not able to at
tain the heights achieved ear
lier by the Crepe de Fruits de
Mer, Nantua.
Soup du jour, a cream of
cauliflower soup, and the
house salad preceded the en
tree. The dinner salad, a simple
green salad, comes with a
choice of blue cheese,
thousand island, Italian or
house dressing. Jacques
strongly recommended the
mustard base house dressing.
However, being a blue cheese
aficionado, I did not follow
Jacques advice. What followed
was the lone disappointment of
the evening — a rather watery
blue cheese dressing. My
companion was more trusting
in Jacques than I. She was re
warded with an excellent and
unique salad dressing.
When we finished our meal,
the dishes were swept away by
the same "invisible" bus hoys
who had attentively, but not
too solicitously, filled our
water glasses and resupplied
our table with fresh sourdough
bread throughout the meal.
Jacques then came over to see
if we wanted any dessert.
When we asked to see the
menu, we were to\d "you are
looking at it". Indeed we were,
for Jacques named and de
scribed the nine dessert choices
which range from the tradi
tional Chocolate Mousse ($1.75)
to the continent — inspiring
Camembert Cheese ($2). My
companion decided on the
cheesecake ($1.50) while I or
dered the house specialty,
Fresh Strawberries, Romanoff
($2.75). My companion, uncer
tain whether she could eat de
ssert after a rather large meal,
had no problem finishing the
cheesecake. She found it both
rich and creamy. Actually, it
was I who found the
cheesecake rich and creamy.
My companion found it "sim
ply incredible".
The strawberries romanoff,
made with vanilla ice cream,
fresh strawberries, fresh whip
ped cream and a generous
dose of triple sec, was every bit
as good as the cheesecake. De
sserts are undoubtedly a
strong point at L'Omelette. We
finished our meal with some
very good American coffee
($.65) rather than Cappucino
($1.50) or Espresso ($1.50).
L'Omelette is also open for
lunch, offering a choice of
soups, sandwiches, salads,
crepes, dinner entrees and of
course omelettes. L'Omelette
has a separate lounge, also
with a fireplace, for after din
ner entertainment with the
Bob Lucas Trio.
L'Omelette is a fine French
restaurant serving high quality
food that is consistently good
and frequently exceptional.
The food, the entertaining and
attentive service and the warm
atmosphere all make
L'Omelette an excellent choice
for a special occasion or an in
timate evening with a special
friend.
