# Nightclub round-up
## BANG in the Bay Area 
### 
Have La Pizzeria, the flicks, frat parties, and
other campus activities lost their allure? Then
perhaps the San Francisco Bay Area Nightclub
Guide (BANG) is for you.
This ambitious little manual takes you on a
nocturnal tour of author Wayne D.
Storkman's favorite spots. After two years of
exploring over 500 nightclubs, Storkman
selected the best of the greater Bay Area,
from Mill Valley to Los Gatos.
The handy guidebook lists 99 hot spots ac
cording to location. Each club is classified by
24 symbols describing its primary attractions.
These attractions include music, entertain
ment, and theme. House specialties, dress
code, principle age of the clientele, cover
charge, and hours are concisely presented,
based on information submitted by the
clubs. Needless to say, tales of overpriced,
underpowered screwdrivers or sleazy
barflies escape the pages.
BANG offers a wide variety of establish
ments. Do you disco down? Are you under
21 ? Looking for Mr. Goodbar? Or do you just
thirst for Coors and foosball? BANG tells you
where, when, and how to find dinner clubs
and cabarets. (And, of course, skyrooms, sa
loons, bistros and discotheques.)
But BANG has more. Six chapters discuss
general club specialties (happy hours, sports
nights); club policies (dress codes, ID re
quirements); suggestions on tipping, park
ing and meeting people; and dancing hints.
A menu of drinks and their ingredients con

cludes the section.
Our major criticism of BANG, however, fo
cuses on the surprising omission of several
unique, well-known places. Such immensely
popular and likable spots as Perry's, Tommy's
Joynt, Henry Africa, The Buena Vista Cafe,
and Rosebud's (in the theatre district), all of
San Francisco, deserve mention. These liba
tion stations enjoy lively clienteles of regulars
and occasional celebs, both day and night.
Palo Alto is represented by five entries:
Clementine's, El Rancho Disco, Iron Works,
Keystone and The New Varsity. What hap
pened to Henry's, The Gatehouse, 42nd
Street, or The Oasis we wonder? Maybe
Storkman's bias toward spots with dancing
and drinking will be mitigated in next year's
edition.
In spite of these controversial slips,
Storkman has done an impressive job. We
have saddled up to 17 of his choices, from the
Cliff Flouse to the Condor, both famous for
the view — of the sea and the strippers, re
spectively. But there is an untapped reservoir
of revelry in the 82 places still awaiting us.
Perhaps the best news is that BANG is av
ailable for less than the price of a couple of
cocktails. For $2, you get not only this clever,
encyclopaedic paperback, but also discount
tickets at three clubs for drinks or cover
charges, more than recouping your invest
ment. Vou can find BANG at the bookstore
and have a bang off-campus.
