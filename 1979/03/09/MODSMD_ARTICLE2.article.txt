# Profs say '7.3% raise' deceptive
## 
### Fran Miller 
Several professors in the School of
Humanities and Sciences are upset
over what they call the "misleading"
proposed salary increase figure of 7.3
percent.
According to Clifford Barnett,
chairman of the anthropology de
partment, there are two problems:
—the future has not been
explained fully by the administration
— not all professors are receiving a
7.3 percent increase — making it easy
for people to be misled; and
—even if the figure were accurate,
it is still too low for a faculty raise.
According to Acting Provost
Gerald Lieberman, all schools re
ceive a 7 percent figure which is spot
ted out from wage price guidelines
("which the University is committed
to follow"), plus a small "kitty" of
$58,000 which translates into the ad
ditional 0.3 percent.
The deans of each school then dis
tribute that money. They can choose
to withhold these funds for
future salary adjustments. Associate
Uean of Humanities and Sciences
Arnice Streit said that 1 percent is
withheld in Humanities and Sci
ences. This accounts for the discre
pancy between the University's fi
gure of 7.3 percent and the actual
raise received by faculty.
Barnett explained that in a Feb. 13
memo sent to all Humanities and
Sciences department heads by its
dean, Halsey Royden, a 5.5 percent
increase was suggested for all as
sociate and full professors, with an
additional negotiable .5 percent.
In the philosophy department,

Chairman John Perry reports that the
average raise of all professors will be
between 5 and 6 percent. Barnett,
Manley, Perry, and Robert Osser
man, chairman of the math depart
ment, agree that the "numbers are
very deceptive.
"It sounds like we're getting a cost
of living raise of 7.3 percent and
we're not," said Perry.
Barnett said that in his department
assistant professors' salary increase
averages 7.9 percent under the new
University proposal.
Percentage increases for assistant
professors are figured on an absolute
scale, but, as an average, can vary
from department to department ac
cording to such factors as present
salaries and individual merit, accord
ing to Streit.
Although assistant professors may
be getting greater percentage raises,
in terms of actual dollars, they are
receiving less money than full and
associate professors, according to
John Manley, chairman of the politi
cal science department.
Lieberman said he found Barnett's
criticisms which he expressed in a
letter to the Daily yesterday to be
"fairly accurate" but said that Barnett
failed to stress the fact that each de
partment chairman can convince the
dean that he needs more money for
certain professors due to their merit
or an offer to them from another
school.
Perry said that he doesn't think
that "either a 5.5 or 7.3 percent in
crease keeps up with the cost of liv
ing."
Barnett said that he feels that "it's a

question of principle." He said that
there are higher wages going to the
staff than the faculty because the
local labor market, on which staff
salaries are based, goes up faster
than the national market, on which
faculty salaries are based.
According to Larry Owen, man
agement associate in the Office of
Management and Financial Planning,
the inflation rate has risen 7.9 per
cent in the past year. Lieberman ex
pressed concern that "University
professors are losing ground to infla
tion."
Barnett said he believes that the
administration should not look at the
national market when considering
professors' salaries. "We're big fish
in a big pond," he said "and we're
doing well compared to other big
ponds." If professors here went to a
second-level institution, however,
Barnett said he believes they would
receive a lot more money.
dents.
"We need a structure that will
allow faculty input with regard to es
tablishing basic budgeting princi
ples," Barnett said. He said he dis
likes the "paternalistic attitude"
adopted by the administration, and
realizes that although "there should
be a certain amount of variation"
within the University, it is "no longer
a community when a whole group of
people feel they are not getting rec
ognized."

raise received by faculty.
Barnett explained that in a Feb. 13
memo sent to all Humanities and
Sciences department heads by its
dean, Halsey Royden, a 5.5 percent
increase was suggested for all as
sociate and full professors, with an
additional negotiable .5 percent.
In the philosophy department,

Chairman John Perry reports that the
average raise of all professors will be
between 5 and 6 percent. Barnett,
Manley, Perry, and Robert Osser
man, chairman of the math depart
ment, agree that the "numbers are
very deceptive.
"It sounds like we're getting a cost
of living raise of 7.3 percent and
we're not," said Perry.
Barnett said that in his department
assistant professors' salary increase
averages 7.9 percent under the new
University proposal.
Percentage increases for assistant
professors are figured on an absolute
scale, but, as an average, can vary
from department to department ac
cording to such factors as present
salaries and individual merit, accord
ing to Streit.
Although assistant professors may
be getting greater percentage raises,
in terms of actual dollars, they are
receiving less money than full and
associate professors, according to
John Manley, chairman of the politi
cal science department.
Lieberman said he found Barnett's
criticisms which he expressed in a
letter to the Daily yesterday to be
"fairly accurate" but said that Barnett
failed to stress the fact that each de
partment chairman can convince the
dean that he needs more money for
certain professors due to their merit
or an offer to them from another
school.
Perry said that he doesn't think
that "either a 5.5 or 7.3 percent in
crease keeps up with the cost of liv
ing."
Barnett said that he feels that "it's a

question of principle." He said that
there are higher wages going to the
staff than the faculty because the
local labor market, on which staff
salaries are based, goes up faster
than the national market, on which
faculty salaries are based.
According to Larry Owen, man
agement associate in the Office of
Management and Financial Planning,
the inflation rate has risen 7.9 per
cent in the past year. Lieberman ex
pressed concern that "University
professors are losing ground to infla
tion."
Barnett said he believes that the
administration should not look at the
national market when considering
professors' salaries. "We're big fish
in a big pond," he said "and we're
doing well compared to other big
ponds." If professors here went to a
second-level institution, however,
Barnett said he believes they would
receive a lot more money.

"We need a structure that will
allow faculty input with regard to es
tablishing basic budgeting princi
ples," Barnett said. He said he dis
likes the "paternalistic attitude"
adopted by the administration, and
realizes that although "there should
be a certain amount of variation"
within the University, it is "no longer
a community when a whole group of
people feel they are not getting rec
ognized."
Deans at the Business, Law and
Medical schools would not com

salary increases and possible varia
tions.
Several professors in the School of
Humanities and Sciences are upset
over what they call the "misleading"
proposed salary increase figure of 7.3
percent.
According to Clifford Barnett,
chairman of the anthropology de
partment, there are two problems:
—the future has not been
explained fully by the administration
— not all professors are receiving a
7.3 percent increase — making it easy
for people to be misled; and
—even if the figure were accurate,
it is still too low for a faculty raise.
According to Acting Provost
Gerald Lieberman, all schools re
ceive a 7 percent figure which is spot
ted out from wage price guidelines
("which the University is committed
to follow"), plus a small "kitty" of
$58,000 which translates into the ad
ditional 0.3 percent.
The deans of each school then dis
tribute that money. They can choose
to withhold these funds for
future salary adjustments. Associate
Uean of Humanities and Sciences
Arnice Streit said that 1 percent is
withheld in Humanities and Sci
ences. This accounts for the discre
pancy between the University's fi
gure of 7.3 percent and the actual
raise received by faculty.
