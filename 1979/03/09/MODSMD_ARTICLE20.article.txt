# California wines preferred
## 
### 
The individual wine tastings
held every Monday of this
quarter are almost over. Eight
wines, their identity unknown
to the tasters, are sampled
each session. Among the wines
tasted and rated this quarter,
the most popular have been
the California sparkling wines,
jug reds available only in
Northern California and the
petite sirah tasting. The others
included California pinot noir,
gewurztraminer and the late
harvest rieslmg.
It is interesting to note that in
all tastings, the California
wines did noticeably better
than their French or German
counterparts. When the rela
tive cost of California and
European wines is considered,
then the Californian varietals
come out on top.
That there exists a California
"palate" comes as no surprise
to the proponents of California
wine. They have long argued
that California wine is great;
and that even when compared
to their European cousins, they
can, at the verv least, hold their
own.
The Jan. 15 tasting compared
California and French noveau
(or beaujolais). The wines were
universally panned. French

beaujolais do not travel well
and perhaps this explained the
poor French showing.
Moreover California nouveaus
on the whole are eminently
forgettable except for the
Montevina Nouveau Zinfandel
($3 per half gallon). But the
Montevina disappears quickly at
the store, and could not be in
cluded at the tasting.
California sparkling wines —
all bruts — were sampled on
Jan. 22. Seven of the eight
wines were made according to
the methode champenoise.
The Schramsberg and the
Domaine Chandon finished in
a tie for second place. But it
was the Christian Bros., the
only wine made according to
the bolt process, that was rated
the best. The reason for this
may lie in the fact that Christian
Bros, uses only superb quality
chardonnay grapes. In fact,
they pay over $1000 for each
case of grapes.
The )an. 24 tasting was more
of a social event. Sixty people
came to try the jug reds of
Northern California. The win
ner was the Big Sur Red from
the Monterey Peninsula. Big
Sur Red is made from zinfandel
grapes crushed by feet. It has
good nose, fruit and color. A

great buy for $2.50 a half gal
lon. Gemello's Zinfandel and
the '74 Inglenook Nevelle Bur
gundy, although they were
rated highly are varietals and
therefore in a class of their
own.
The notoriously poor grape
of California, pinot noir, was
well represented on Feb. 5 by
the following two wines: in
first place, the '76 Villa Mt.
Eden ($9) that was extremely
woody and fruity; and in sec
ond place, the ZD '75 St. Clair
($9.50) spicy and minty, and a
wine that developed well. The
Hanzell pinot noir, a well re
spected wine, finished in last
place, thus proving the value of
a "blind" tasting.
Overall, the petite sirahs on
Feb. 26 were superb. In first
place was the '74 Robert Mon
davi, the darkest wine of the
evening. The '75 Ridge (York
Creek Vineyard — $6.50), a soft
and elegant wine, given its
tanin was second. But the
Freemark Abbey Petite Syrah,
also $6.50 and also from the
same vineyard as the Ridge,
ended up in seventh place. It
was austere and alcoholic. But
the find of the evening was the
'76 Kenwood, a wine with a
penetrating berry-like nose. At

$4.75, it was the cheapest wine
of the tasting and was third.
The tasting of March 5 com
pared late harvest rieslings of
California to those of Ger
many. The German wines
ranged in price from $14.50 to
$24.50 and ranked second,
third and fourth respectively.
The winner, however, was the
Chateau St. lean '77 from
California ($l5). It was far and
away the best, qualitatively and
statistically. The find of the tast
ing was the '77 Burgess of Win
ery Lake ($8). This tasting
showed the group's inability
to distinguish between the
wines of California and Ger
many. This is especially striking
when one considers the saving
of over $10.
Next quarter, tastings will be
held on Thursday nights at 7:30
in Lagunita dining hall. Reser
vations and payment in ad
vance. The line-up is as fol
lows: April 19, '77 chardonnay
($7); April 26, '76 zinfandel (15);
May 5, white jugs of Northern
California ($3); May 10, '76
cabernet ($7); May 17, '77 sauvig
non blani ($5); May 24, '76 reg
ional 112 rench burgunday ($6); and
on May Jl, French champagne
($l2).

wines did noticeably better
than their French or German
counterparts. When the rela
tive cost of California and
European wines is considered,
then the Californian varietals
come out on top.
That there exists a California
"palate" comes as no surprise
to the proponents of California
wine. They have long argued
that California wine is great;
and that even when compared
to their European cousins, they
can, at the verv least, hold their
own.
The Jan. 15 tasting compared
California and French noveau
(or beaujolais). The wines were
universally panned. French

beaujolais do not travel well
and perhaps this explained the
poor French showing.
Moreover California nouveaus
on the whole are eminently
forgettable except for the
Montevina Nouveau Zinfandel
($3 per half gallon). But the
Montevina disappears quickly at
the store, and could not be in
cluded at the tasting.
California sparkling wines —
all bruts — were sampled on
Jan. 22. Seven of the eight
wines were made according to
the methode champenoise.
The Schramsberg and the
Domaine Chandon finished in
a tie for second place. But it
was the Christian Bros., the
only wine made according to
the bolt process, that was rated
the best. The reason for this
may lie in the fact that Christian
Bros, uses only superb quality
chardonnay grapes. In fact,
they pay over $1000 for each
case of grapes.
The )an. 24 tasting was more
of a social event. Sixty people
came to try the jug reds of
Northern California. The win
ner was the Big Sur Red from
the Monterey Peninsula. Big
Sur Red is made from zinfandel
grapes crushed by feet. It has
good nose, fruit and color. A

great buy for $2.50 a half gal
lon. Gemello's Zinfandel and
the '74 Inglenook Nevelle Bur
gundy, although they were
rated highly are varietals and
therefore in a class of their
own.
The notoriously poor grape
of California, pinot noir, was
well represented on Feb. 5 by
the following two wines: in
first place, the '76 Villa Mt.
Eden ($9) that was extremely
woody and fruity; and in sec
ond place, the ZD '75 St. Clair
($9.50) spicy and minty, and a
wine that developed well. The
Hanzell pinot noir, a well re
spected wine, finished in last
place, thus proving the value of
a "blind" tasting.
Overall, the petite sirahs on
Feb. 26 were superb. In first
place was the '74 Robert Mon
davi, the darkest wine of the
evening. The '75 Ridge (York
Creek Vineyard — $6.50), a soft
and elegant wine, given its
tanin was second. But the
Freemark Abbey Petite Syrah,
also $6.50 and also from the
same vineyard as the Ridge,
ended up in seventh place. It
was austere and alcoholic. But
the find of the evening was the
'76 Kenwood, a wine with a
penetrating berry-like nose. At

$4.75, it was the cheapest wine
of the tasting and was third.
The tasting of March 5 com
pared late harvest rieslings of
California to those of Ger
many. The German wines
ranged in price from $14.50 to
$24.50 and ranked second,
third and fourth respectively.
The winner, however, was the
Chateau St. lean '77 from
California ($l5). It was far and
away the best, qualitatively and
statistically. The find of the tast
ing was the '77 Burgess of Win
ery Lake ($8). This tasting
showed the group's inability
to distinguish between the
wines of California and Ger
many. This is especially striking
when one considers the saving
of over $10.
Next quarter, tastings will be
held on Thursday nights at 7:30
in Lagunita dining hall. Reser
vations and payment in ad
vance. The line-up is as fol
lows: April 19, '77 chardonnay
($7); April 26, '76 zinfandel (15);
May 5, white jugs of Northern
California ($3); May 10, '76
cabernet ($7); May 17, '77 sauvig
non blani ($5); May 24, '76 reg
ional 112 rench burgunday ($6); and
on May Jl, French champagne
($l2).

The individual wine tastings
held every Monday of this
quarter are almost over. Eight
wines, their identity unknown
to the tasters, are sampled
each session. Among the wines
tasted and rated this quarter,
the most popular have been
the California sparkling wines,
jug reds available only in
Northern California and the
petite sirah tasting. The others
included California pinot noir,
gewurztraminer and the late
harvest rieslmg.
It is interesting to note that in
all tastings, the California
wines did noticeably better
