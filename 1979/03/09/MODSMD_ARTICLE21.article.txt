Spellbound * * *
Monday, Cubberley
Alfred Hitchcock decided it
was time to deal with the then
new fad of psychoanalysis in
this 1945 drama. Although the
psychology is usually less than
convincing 'and a preface about
the wonders of the science is al
most certainly satirical), it's not
because Hitchcock shows any
less than his usual flair. There are
some wonderful scenes, includ
ing a stunningly done point-of
view suicide where all we see is a
hand with a gun pointed toward
the camera. Ingrid Bergman is
the psychoanalyst; Gregory
Peck, as wooden as ever, is the
man she needs to help. Salvador
Dali illustrated a dream sequ
ence.
• —Jim Mattson
Murmur of the Heart * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This isn't exactly your standard
study of adolescence. Louis
Malle shows a master's touch
with this seemingly amoral com
edy about a wealthy Italian family
of boys. There are encounters
with the girls next door, with
prostitutes, and with incest: all,
in Malle's vision, mean about the
same. Lea Massari does a fine job
with her role as the blowsy,
cheerful, very sensuous mother
of the clan.

Saturday Night Fever * * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low
SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point, too, except
that it's uncharitable to go
around talking about other
people's low SATs. Yet Saturday
Night Fever does have a fixity
about it which is at times very ap
pealing, and Travolta is a legiti
mate star (he plays a big, dumb
stud to be sure, but he manages
to be subtle at times and almost
complex at others). The movie has
no nutritional value, but it /s very
good. Some people will hate it
for its unrepentant dumbness,
and some will object to the danc
ing as inherently unimportant,
but that's their fault, really. If
they scoff at you you should
punch them in the nose.

Murder by Decree # ★ *
Old Mill
This time around, Sherlock
Holmes and Dr. Watson are in
carnated in the form of Christ
opher Plummer and James Ma
son. They're very good — espe
cially Mason — and they have a
chance to show their stuff in an
atmospheric studio recreation of
Victorian London. The plot,
however, isn't that great; this
mystery about Jack the Ripper is a
no more than passable vehicle
for the stars and sets. This is one
of these rare movies that makes
one hunger for a sequel: all the
ingredients are right for making
the definitive Sherlock Holmes
movie, given a slightly better
story.

Murder on the Orient Express
★ ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sidney lumet, who directed
The Wiz, last year's biggest,
brightest, and most expensive
mess, is in better form here with
this stylish, elegantly decorated
whodunit. Albert Finney makes a
nice, self-parodying Hercule
Poirot; his suspects include In
grid Bergman (who, somewhat
surprisingly, won an Academy
Award for her performance),
Sean Connery, and Lauren
Bacall. The pacing is a little
pedestrian for a movie set on a
train, but, as you might suspect,
everything works out in the end.
—J.M.
Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★*
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an I'Q of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to I
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's 1
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M. i

1900 * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bernardo Bertolucci spent
four years directing this epic tale
about two men, one rich, the
other poor, who are both born in
1900 and whose lives run a paral
lel course through World War 11.
1900 is a film marred by excesses:
Donald Sutherland plays a
super-fascist who coolly murders
cats and children; the peasants
revolt by throwing horse manure
at their oppressors. But it's a
striking effort nevertheless: its
four-hour running time includes
dozens of scenes of great power
and beauty. Robert De Niro,
Gerard Depardieu, Dominique
Sanda and Burt Lancaster head
the mammoth cast.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★ '/j
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.

Death on the Nile if if ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—Ron Lillejord

The Brink's Job
Old Mill
When a capable hack like Wil
liam Friedkin (The Exorcist)
doesn't care about the material,
watch out. This is a stubbornly
indifferent movie; it's like a kid
who can do better but just won't.
Familiar faces (Peter Falk, Warren
Oates, Peter Boyle) stumble
around and act like they want
their checks fast. A mess of the
lowest order.
—R.L.
Agatha ★ *
Old Mill
About "what might have hap
pened" during Agatha Christie's
still-unexplained 10-day disap
pearance in 1926. Director
Michael Apted is into making
pretty pictures and not much
else; the only thing he borrows
from Christie is her name and a
twist ending. The movie certainly
doesn't steal her dense plotting
— little happens here. Vanessa
Redgrave captures Christie's
famous shyness and insecurity
perfectly and Apted obsessively
photographs her in artsy closeup
— Redgrave's never looked pret
tier. Dustin Hoffman looks
ludicrous at first — his hair's
slicked down, and he's never
been this well-dressed in a movie
before — he and Redgrave are an
odd pair. Somehow they're
pleasant enough together, but
they — and everything else here
— are done in by Apted's languid
approach.
—R.L.

Days of Heaven * * * #
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.
—J.M.

Hardcore it
Palo Alto Square
Writer-director Paul Schrader
keeps himself detached from
what he's filming; this movie's
premise — a Calvinist
businessman from Grand Rapids
loses his daughter to California's
porno underworld and goes off
to get her back — would seem to
promise loads of emotional
theatrics, but the feeling's been
sucked out, and we're left with
Schrader's intellect and not his
guts. As the father, George C.
Scott tries hard, but he's finally
done in by the distance Schrader
keeps from the film's ugly night
world. With Season Hubley and
Peter Boyle.
—R.L.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survves its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
* finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

No Time For Breakfast ★★★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
this is a good movie about a doc
tor who discovers how comfort
less the ministrations of her pro
fession can be when she finds
she is dying of cancer. Annie
Cirardot, who gave last year's
Dear Detective any merit it pos
sessed, turns what was poten
tially soap-opera material into a
very moving performance.
—J.M.
The Creat Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
ifulwoman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.
— R.L.

Diamonds Are Forever * *
Saturday, Cubberley
007 travels the globe to battle
yet another threat to world
peace. I love the Sean Connery
lames Bond movies, but here, in
his last Bond outing, Connery is
less than enthusiastic — even his
grins look painful. The movie
does bounce along well enough,
and the Las Vegas sequences, in
particular, have more than enough
flashtoget by. With )ill St. Johnas
the "Bond woman" — the ulti
mate sexist cliche.
—R.L.
The Wind and the Lion *
Friday, Kresge
Director |ohn Milius, that
champion hot-air blower, turns
his roving eye to turn-of-the
century desert macho in this
handsome, empty production.
Milius provides us with a "tough"
boy's view of Teddy Roosevelt
and of sending in the Marines;
but there's no wonder and not
much fun here (because Milius is
so full of shit?). As the leader of a
band of Arab rebels in Morocco,
Sean Connery is the only thing
worth seeing in the movie.

1900 and whose lives run a paral
lel course through World War 11.
1900 is a film marred by excesses:
Donald Sutherland plays a
super-fascist who coolly murders
cats and children; the peasants
revolt by throwing horse manure
at their oppressors. But it's a
striking effort nevertheless: its
four-hour running time includes
dozens of scenes of great power
and beauty. Robert De Niro,
Gerard Depardieu, Dominique
Sanda and Burt Lancaster head
the mammoth cast.

The Deer Hunter ★★★ '/j
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.

A solid mystery, nicely photo

About "what might have hap
pened" during Agatha Christie's
still-unexplained 10-day disap
pearance in 1926. Director
Michael Apted is into making
pretty pictures and not much
else; the only thing he borrows
from Christie is her name and a
twist ending. The movie certainly
doesn't steal her dense plotting
— little happens here. Vanessa
Redgrave captures Christie's
famous shyness and insecurity
perfectly and Apted obsessively
photographs her in artsy closeup
— Redgrave's never looked pret
tier. Dustin Hoffman looks
ludicrous at first — his hair's
slicked down, and he's never
been this well-dressed in a movie
before — he and Redgrave are an
odd pair. Somehow they're
pleasant enough together, but
they — and everything else here
— are done in by Apted's languid
approach.

Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi

setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.

A triumph of corporate com

Monday, Cubberley
Alfred Hitchcock decided it
was time to deal with the then
new fad of psychoanalysis in
this 1945 drama. Although the
psychology is usually less than
convincing 'and a preface about
the wonders of the science is al
most certainly satirical), it's not
because Hitchcock shows any
less than his usual flair. There are
some wonderful scenes, includ
ing a stunningly done point-of
view suicide where all we see is a
hand with a gun pointed toward
the camera. Ingrid Bergman is
the psychoanalyst; Gregory
Peck, as wooden as ever, is the
man she needs to help. Salvador
Dali illustrated a dream sequ

cheerful, very sensuous mother
of the clan.

Saturday Night Fever * * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of

he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low
SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point, too, except
that it's uncharitable to go
around talking about other
people's low SATs. Yet Saturday
Night Fever does have a fixity
about it which is at times very ap
pealing, and Travolta is a legiti
mate star (he plays a big, dumb
stud to be sure, but he manages
to be subtle at times and almost
complex at others). The movie has
no nutritional value, but it /s very
good. Some people will hate it
for its unrepentant dumbness,
and some will object to the danc
ing as inherently unimportant,
but that's their fault, really. If
they scoff at you you should
punch them in the nose.

Sidney lumet, who directed
The Wiz, last year's biggest,
brightest, and most expensive

Sean Connery, and Lauren

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs

Bertrand Blier directed this

ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an I'Q of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to I

Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survves its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and

Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always

No Time For Breakfast ★★★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems

this is a good movie about a doc

she is dying of cancer. Annie
Cirardot, who gave last year's

The Creat Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie

an entertainment that's not quite

a hack's mentality ("all you need

ifulwoman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery

fake gloss and not real sparkle.

much fun here (because Milius is

Monday, Cubberley
Alfred Hitchcock decided it
was time to deal with the then
new fad of psychoanalysis in
this 1945 drama. Although the
psychology is usually less than
convincing 'and a preface about
the wonders of the science is al
most certainly satirical), it's not
because Hitchcock shows any
less than his usual flair. There are
some wonderful scenes, includ
ing a stunningly done point-of
view suicide where all we see is a
hand with a gun pointed toward
the camera. Ingrid Bergman is
the psychoanalyst; Gregory
Peck, as wooden as ever, is the
man she needs to help. Salvador

This isn't exactly your standard

Saturday Night Fever * * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low
SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point, too, except
that it's uncharitable to go
around talking about other
people's low SATs. Yet Saturday
Night Fever does have a fixity
about it which is at times very ap
pealing, and Travolta is a legiti
mate star (he plays a big, dumb
stud to be sure, but he manages
to be subtle at times and almost
complex at others). The movie has
no nutritional value, but it /s very
good. Some people will hate it
for its unrepentant dumbness,
and some will object to the danc
ing as inherently unimportant,
but that's their fault, really. If
they scoff at you you should
punch them in the nose.

Murder by Decree # ★ *
Old Mill
This time around, Sherlock
Holmes and Dr. Watson are in
carnated in the form of Christ
opher Plummer and James Ma
son. They're very good — espe
cially Mason — and they have a
chance to show their stuff in an
atmospheric studio recreation of
Victorian London. The plot,
however, isn't that great; this
mystery about Jack the Ripper is a
no more than passable vehicle
for the stars and sets. This is one
of these rare movies that makes
one hunger for a sequel: all the
ingredients are right for making
the definitive Sherlock Holmes
movie, given a slightly better
story.

Murder on the Orient Express
★ ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sidney lumet, who directed
The Wiz, last year's biggest,
brightest, and most expensive
mess, is in better form here with
this stylish, elegantly decorated
whodunit. Albert Finney makes a
nice, self-parodying Hercule
Poirot; his suspects include In
grid Bergman (who, somewhat
surprisingly, won an Academy
Award for her performance),
Sean Connery, and Lauren
Bacall. The pacing is a little
pedestrian for a movie set on a

everything works out in the end.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★*
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an I'Q of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to I
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's 1
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.

1900 * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bernardo Bertolucci spent
four years directing this epic tale
about two men, one rich, the
other poor, who are both born in
1900 and whose lives run a paral
lel course through World War 11.
1900 is a film marred by excesses:
Donald Sutherland plays a
super-fascist who coolly murders
cats and children; the peasants
revolt by throwing horse manure
at their oppressors. But it's a
striking effort nevertheless: its
four-hour running time includes
dozens of scenes of great power
and beauty. Robert De Niro,
Gerard Depardieu, Dominique
Sanda and Burt Lancaster head
the mammoth cast.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★ '/j
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.

A solid mystery, nicely photo

perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,

About "what might have hap

still-unexplained 10-day disap

Michael Apted is into making
pretty pictures and not much
else; the only thing he borrows
from Christie is her name and a
twist ending. The movie certainly
doesn't steal her dense plotting
— little happens here. Vanessa
Redgrave captures Christie's
famous shyness and insecurity
perfectly and Apted obsessively
photographs her in artsy closeup
— Redgrave's never looked pret
tier. Dustin Hoffman looks
ludicrous at first — his hair's
slicked down, and he's never
been this well-dressed in a movie
before — he and Redgrave are an
odd pair. Somehow they're
pleasant enough together, but
they — and everything else here
— are done in by Apted's languid
approach.

Terence Malick directed this

examination of the way four main

setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.

I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low
SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point, too, except
that it's uncharitable to go
around talking about other
people's low SATs. Yet Saturday
Night Fever does have a fixity
about it which is at times very ap
pealing, and Travolta is a legiti
mate star (he plays a big, dumb
stud to be sure, but he manages
to be subtle at times and almost
complex at others). The movie has
no nutritional value, but it /s very
good. Some people will hate it
for its unrepentant dumbness,
and some will object to the danc
ing as inherently unimportant,
but that's their fault, really. If
they scoff at you you should
punch them in the nose.

Murder by Decree # ★ *
Old Mill
This time around, Sherlock
Holmes and Dr. Watson are in
carnated in the form of Christ
opher Plummer and James Ma
son. They're very good — espe
cially Mason — and they have a
chance to show their stuff in an
atmospheric studio recreation of
Victorian London. The plot,
however, isn't that great; this
mystery about Jack the Ripper is a
no more than passable vehicle
for the stars and sets. This is one
of these rare movies that makes
one hunger for a sequel: all the
ingredients are right for making
the definitive Sherlock Holmes
movie, given a slightly better
story.

Murder on the Orient Express
★ ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sidney lumet, who directed
The Wiz, last year's biggest,
brightest, and most expensive
mess, is in better form here with
this stylish, elegantly decorated
whodunit. Albert Finney makes a
nice, self-parodying Hercule
Poirot; his suspects include In
grid Bergman (who, somewhat
surprisingly, won an Academy
Award for her performance),
Sean Connery, and Lauren
Bacall. The pacing is a little
pedestrian for a movie set on a
train, but, as you might suspect,
everything works out in the end.
—J.M.
Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★*
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an I'Q of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to I
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's 1
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.

1900 * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bernardo Bertolucci spent
four years directing this epic tale
about two men, one rich, the
other poor, who are both born in
1900 and whose lives run a paral
lel course through World War 11.
1900 is a film marred by excesses:
Donald Sutherland plays a
super-fascist who coolly murders
cats and children; the peasants
revolt by throwing horse manure
at their oppressors. But it's a
striking effort nevertheless: its
four-hour running time includes
dozens of scenes of great power
and beauty. Robert De Niro,
Gerard Depardieu, Dominique
Sanda and Burt Lancaster head
the mammoth cast.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★ '/j
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.

Death on the Nile if if ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—Ron Lillejord

The Brink's Job
Old Mill
When a capable hack like Wil
liam Friedkin (The Exorcist)
doesn't care about the material,
watch out. This is a stubbornly
indifferent movie; it's like a kid
who can do better but just won't.
Familiar faces (Peter Falk, Warren
Oates, Peter Boyle) stumble
around and act like they want
their checks fast. A mess of the
lowest order.
—R.L.
Agatha ★ *
Old Mill
About "what might have hap
pened" during Agatha Christie's
still-unexplained 10-day disap
pearance in 1926. Director
Michael Apted is into making
pretty pictures and not much
else; the only thing he borrows
from Christie is her name and a
twist ending. The movie certainly
doesn't steal her dense plotting
— little happens here. Vanessa
Redgrave captures Christie's
famous shyness and insecurity
perfectly and Apted obsessively
photographs her in artsy closeup
— Redgrave's never looked pret
tier. Dustin Hoffman looks
ludicrous at first — his hair's
slicked down, and he's never
been this well-dressed in a movie
before — he and Redgrave are an
odd pair. Somehow they're
pleasant enough together, but
they — and everything else here
— are done in by Apted's languid
approach.
—R.L.

Days of Heaven * * * #
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.

Hardcore it
Palo Alto Square
Writer-director Paul Schrader
keeps himself detached from
what he's filming; this movie's
premise — a Calvinist
businessman from Grand Rapids
loses his daughter to California's
porno underworld and goes off
to get her back — would seem to
promise loads of emotional
theatrics, but the feeling's been
sucked out, and we're left with
Schrader's intellect and not his
guts. As the father, George C.
Scott tries hard, but he's finally
done in by the distance Schrader
keeps from the film's ugly night
world. With Season Hubley and
Peter Boyle.
—R.L.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survves its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
* finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

No Time For Breakfast ★★★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
this is a good movie about a doc
tor who discovers how comfort
less the ministrations of her pro
fession can be when she finds
she is dying of cancer. Annie
Cirardot, who gave last year's
Dear Detective any merit it pos
sessed, turns what was poten
tially soap-opera material into a
very moving performance.
—J.M.
The Creat Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
ifulwoman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.

Diamonds Are Forever * *
Saturday, Cubberley
007 travels the globe to battle
yet another threat to world
peace. I love the Sean Connery
lames Bond movies, but here, in
his last Bond outing, Connery is
less than enthusiastic — even his
grins look painful. The movie
does bounce along well enough,
and the Las Vegas sequences, in
particular, have more than enough
flashtoget by. With )ill St. Johnas
the "Bond woman" — the ulti
mate sexist cliche.

The Wind and the Lion *
Friday, Kresge
Director |ohn Milius, that
champion hot-air blower, turns
his roving eye to turn-of-the
century desert macho in this
handsome, empty production.
Milius provides us with a "tough"
boy's view of Teddy Roosevelt
and of sending in the Marines;
but there's no wonder and not
much fun here (because Milius is
so full of shit?). As the leader of a
band of Arab rebels in Morocco,
Sean Connery is the only thing
worth seeing in the movie.

Spellbound * * *
Monday, Cubberley
Alfred Hitchcock decided it
was time to deal with the then
new fad of psychoanalysis in
this 1945 drama. Although the
psychology is usually less than
convincing 'and a preface about
the wonders of the science is al
most certainly satirical), it's not
because Hitchcock shows any
less than his usual flair. There are
some wonderful scenes, includ
ing a stunningly done point-of
view suicide where all we see is a
hand with a gun pointed toward
the camera. Ingrid Bergman is
the psychoanalyst; Gregory
Peck, as wooden as ever, is the
man she needs to help. Salvador
Dali illustrated a dream sequ
ence.

Murmur of the Heart * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This isn't exactly your standard
study of adolescence. Louis
Malle shows a master's touch
with this seemingly amoral com
edy about a wealthy Italian family
of boys. There are encounters
with the girls next door, with
prostitutes, and with incest: all,
in Malle's vision, mean about the
same. Lea Massari does a fine job
with her role as the blowsy,
cheerful, very sensuous mother
of the clan.
