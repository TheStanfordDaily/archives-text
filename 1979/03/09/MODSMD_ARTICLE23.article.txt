# Dried books return to stacks on Monday
## 
### 
The first batch of freeze
dried books will be returned to
Meyer Undergraduate Library
on Monday, according to Sally
Buchanan, library restoration
specialist.
The batch includes from 400
to 500 bound periodicals.
About three-fourths of the
45,000 books soaked after a
water-main breakage last fall
will be shelved again in the
stacks this spring.
About one-quarter of the
books will need more exten
sive repair work, such as re
binding, according to Bucha
nan. About three to four dozen
cannot be repaired or re
stored.
The books underwent a vac
uum drying process at Loc

kheed Missiles and Space
Company, in the same space
chamber used to test the lunar
rover machine several years
ago. Following the drying, the
books were taken to the
former Terman Junior High
School library in Palo Alto to
reabsorb a normal level of
moisture from the air. At pre
sent, all but two final ship
ments of books have been
taken to the school.
Older books fared better in
the drying process than newer
books, Buchanan said.
Besides volunteers, three
tull-timeand five half-time staff
are engaged in the restoration
project, which will continue
until September.
