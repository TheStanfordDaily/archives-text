# Debate opportunities here limited

Unlike most top-rated uni
versities, Stanford has no uni
versity-supported debate team,
no forensics department, and
few opportunities for students
to discuss current issues within
the debate format.
Until 1971, there was both a
debate program and team, ac
cording to Dan Williams, as
sociate dean of student affairs.
The program, at that time part
of a department of speech and
communication, was discon
tinued as part of a budget
cutting plan.
The debate coach left the
University and the debate team
"became so informal that it was
not organized enough to make
matches," Williams said.
A budget from the Office of

Student Activities (OSA)
existed after the department
was phased out, but this was
reduced and then eliminated
when the OSA was reor
ganized, according to Thomas
Massey, director of the Office
of Student Activities.
"There were less debates
and less interest in debate, the
costs had gone up and so we
decided to cut it out al
together," Massey said.
"There's really not a debate
team now. Sometimes in
terested students do start a
team but there is a problem of
continuity," he said.
"It is very dubious that
forensicswill getfundingin the
near future," said Laura
Selznick, director of the Un
dergraduate Special Program.

"It would have to be a depart
ment making the decision to
expand the budget."
Both Williams and Massey
said that a student fee assess
ment could finance a debate
team. On-campus debates
could apply to be sponsored by
the Dickinson Symposium
Fund which finances intellec
tual discussions of public pol
icy, Massey said.
"You need a budget of
$10,000 a year for a debate
team" said Susan Richards, as
sistant director of the forensics
department at UC-Berkeley.
"The major expense is travel;
it's expensive but worth
while", she said.
"Stanford has lots of compe
tent people but no program to
house them" Richards said.

Many students have studied
forensics in high school, Mas
sey said, but "there is a Catch
-22 situation: because there is
no program, debaters are not
attracted, and because they are
not attracted we can't get the
money together."
There is a debate team here
now, but it receives no money
from either the University or
the ASSU. The team competes
with Cal annually for the Vol
taire Trophy, the longest
running intercollegiate debate
in the world.
The team runs a forensics in
stitute in the summer for high
school students. This is a
"money-making program for
the debating team," said
sophomore Paul Cassell, one
of the institute's organizers.
