# 'Shades of Cecil B. DeMille'
## Debate on convention hot now—but not before 
### 
Sacramento, Calif. (AP) — A
proposal to call a federal con
stitutional convention, now
the subject of stormy debate,
whisked virtually unnoticed
through some state legisla
tures before its full ramifica
tions were understood.
In Texas, for example, each
legislative house adopted the
measure the same day it was
introduced in 1978, which
normally could not have been
done. "There was a suspension
of the rules," explained the re
solution's sponsor, Rep. Tim
Von Dohlen.
In Florida, House Clerk Alan
Morris recalled that in 1976 the
resolution went through like
other resolutions — "like peas
through a funnel. . . . That's
the way they handle memo
rials."
In these and a number of
other states, it appears, the
measure has been treated
much like the numerous non
binding resolutions aimed at
Congress that states routinely
pass — matters not calling for
the scrutiny and debate de
voted to, say, a local highway
project.
But this resolution is diffe
rent. It calls for Congress to
hold a constitutional conven
tion — unprecedented since
1787 — to adopt an amen
dment requiring a balanced

federal budget.
If two-thirds of the states
adopt it, Congress would have
tc hold the convention, and
some constitutional scholars
fear it could not be limited to
one amendment and instead
would open up the nation's
basic legal document to all
kinds of changes.
Sponsors are predicting suc
cess this year, and it could be
achieved in part, it seems, be
cause little attention was paid
in the early stages.
Indeed, Louisiana Gov.
Edwin Edwards didn't notice
the Legislature had adopted
the resolution in 1978 so two
months ago he called on it to
adopt such a resolution. Told
the act had been passed, Ed
wards said, "That's all right, I'll
let them do it again."
And after Florida passed the
proposal in 1976, the Legisla
ture reconsidered it and failed
to pass it last spring. Clerk
Morris' explanation for the
legislators' repeat perfor
mance: "They forgot."
One state where the issue
moved quickly from obscurity
to the spotlight was California.
Last year, state Assembly
Majority Leader Howard Ber
man happend to thumb
through the list of measures on
the floor one day and found a

resolution calling for the con
vention to require a balanced
budget.
Berman, a Los Angeles
Democrat, recalled thinking
this "was a pretty far-out no
tion." He had the measure pul
led off the Assembly consent
file — where its unanimous
passage was almost assured —
and it was eventually killed.
The resolution had quietly
won State Senate approval and
Assembly committee passage.
It was a breath away from final
passage when Berman saw it.
This year the convention
issue has sparked much more
publicity, fueled in part by an
endorsement by California
Gov. jerry Brown.
In fact, the current California
Legislature's treatment of the
resolution has shades of a Cecil
B. DeMille spectacular —
complete with an audience of
600 and 10 television cameras
at one hearing.
At that hearing Brown him
self made a rare appearance to
testify. Another supporter was
former U.S. Sen. Sam Ervin,
testifying by videotape from
his North Carolina law office.
The resolution, opposed by
Assembly Democratic leaders,
was again defeated.
In other states, too, the issue
is getting more scrutiny now.

As Ohio Rep. William Hinig,;
said of his pending convention
resolution: "It's certainly not
greased. In fact, it's not even
oiled."
Thirty-four state legislatures
must adopt the measure. The
National Taxpayers' Union,
which backs the convention
drive, says 28 have done so. At
least two states, Pennsylvania
and Nevada, had governors
veto the action, clouding the
resolutions' legal standing. In
most states, resolutions are not
sent to governors for approval
or veto.
The 28 states the Taxpayers'
Union counts are: Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,
Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Idaho, lowa, Kansas,
Louisiana, Maryland, Missis
sippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
South Dakota, Tennessee,
Texas, Utah, Virginia and
Wyoming.
An Associated Press survey
of legislatures also found these
examples of the resolution's
treatment:
Kansas: Last year the Legisla
ture took about three months
to pass the proposal. Rep. Fred
Weaver, a Democrat who was
then chairman of the House

Ways and Means Committee,
says he thinks most legislators
thought they were voting on
just the concept of a balanced
federal budget and weren't
aware of the ramifications. He
said he wasn't.
Sen. Ed Reilly, a Republican
and chairman of the Senate
Federal and State Affairs
Committee, recalled that the
hearing on the resolution in his
committee was brief, with the
sponsor, Sen. Norman Gaar,
the only person appearing.
Asked if most legislators knew
what they were voting on,
Reilly said, "Not really."
—Colorado: Last year the
House and Senate took about
three days each to discuss the
measure before it was
adopted. While the time in
volved was fairly short, there
was some debate, including a
warning from an opponent,
Sen. Regis Groff (D-Denver)
that the resolution would not
be "just a piece of paper going
to Congress.''
—Arkansas: The resolution
was introduced Jan. 8, the tirst
day of this year's session. The

Indeed, Louisiana Gov.
Edwin Edwards didn't notice
the Legislature had adopted
the resolution in 1978 so two
months ago he called on it to
adopt such a resolution. Told
the act had been passed, Ed
wards said, "That's all right, I'll
let them do it again."
And after Florida passed the
proposal in 1976, the Legisla
ture reconsidered it and failed
to pass it last spring. Clerk
Morris' explanation for the
legislators' repeat perfor

One state where the issue
moved quickly from obscurity
to the spotlight was California.
Last year, state Assembly
Majority Leader Howard Ber
man happend to thumb
through the list of measures on
the floor one day and found a

resolution calling for the con
vention to require a balanced
budget.
Berman, a Los Angeles
Democrat, recalled thinking
this "was a pretty far-out no
tion." He had the measure pul
led off the Assembly consent
file — where its unanimous
passage was almost assured —
and it was eventually killed.
The resolution had quietly
won State Senate approval and
Assembly committee passage.
It was a breath away from final
passage when Berman saw it.
This year the convention
issue has sparked much more
publicity, fueled in part by an
endorsement by California
Gov. jerry Brown.
In fact, the current California
Legislature's treatment of the
resolution has shades of a Cecil
B. DeMille spectacular —
complete with an audience of
600 and 10 television cameras
at one hearing.
At that hearing Brown him
self made a rare appearance to
testify. Another supporter was
former U.S. Sen. Sam Ervin,
testifying by videotape from
his North Carolina law office.
The resolution, opposed by
Assembly Democratic leaders,
was again defeated.
In other states, too, the issue
is getting more scrutiny now.

As Ohio Rep. William Hinig,;
said of his pending convention
resolution: "It's certainly not
greased. In fact, it's not even
oiled."
Thirty-four state legislatures
must adopt the measure. The
National Taxpayers' Union,
which backs the convention
drive, says 28 have done so. At
least two states, Pennsylvania
and Nevada, had governors
veto the action, clouding the
resolutions' legal standing. In
most states, resolutions are not
sent to governors for approval
or veto.
The 28 states the Taxpayers'
Union counts are: Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,
Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Idaho, lowa, Kansas,
Louisiana, Maryland, Missis
sippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
South Dakota, Tennessee,
Texas, Utah, Virginia and
Wyoming.
An Associated Press survey
of legislatures also found these
examples of the resolution's
treatment:
Kansas: Last year the Legisla
ture took about three months
to pass the proposal. Rep. Fred
Weaver, a Democrat who was
then chairman of the House

Ways and Means Committee,
says he thinks most legislators
thought they were voting on
just the concept of a balanced
federal budget and weren't
aware of the ramifications. He
said he wasn't.
Sen. Ed Reilly, a Republican
and chairman of the Senate
Federal and State Affairs
Committee, recalled that the
hearing on the resolution in his
committee was brief, with the
sponsor, Sen. Norman Gaar,
the only person appearing.
Asked if most legislators knew
what they were voting on,
Reilly said, "Not really."
—Colorado: Last year the
House and Senate took about
three days each to discuss the
measure before it was
adopted. While the time in
volved was fairly short, there
was some debate, including a
warning from an opponent,
Sen. Regis Groff (D-Denver)
that the resolution would not
be "just a piece of paper going
to Congress.''
—Arkansas: The resolution
was introduced Jan. 8, the tirst
day of this year's session. The
House adopted it Jan. 17, and
the Senate tried to adopt it that
day also. But it had to readopt it
Jan. 22 after senators realized
they were legally barred from
passing the measure on the
same day as the House.
Sacramento, Calif. (AP) — A
proposal to call a federal con
stitutional convention, now
the subject of stormy debate,
whisked virtually unnoticed
through some state legisla
tures before its full ramifica
tions were understood.
In Texas, for example, each
legislative house adopted the
measure the same day it was
introduced in 1978, which
normally could not have been
done. "There was a suspension
of the rules," explained the re
solution's sponsor, Rep. Tim
Von Dohlen.
In Florida, House Clerk Alan
Morris recalled that in 1976 the
resolution went through like
other resolutions — "like peas
through a funnel. . . . That's
the way they handle memo
rials."
In these and a number of
other states, it appears, the
measure has been treated
much like the numerous non
binding resolutions aimed at
Congress that states routinely
pass — matters not calling for
the scrutiny and debate de
voted to, say, a local highway
project.
But this resolution is diffe
rent. It calls for Congress to
hold a constitutional conven
tion — unprecedented since
1787 — to adopt an amen
dment requiring a balanced

federal budget.
If two-thirds of the states
adopt it, Congress would have
tc hold the convention, and
some constitutional scholars
fear it could not be limited to
one amendment and instead
would open up the nation's
basic legal document to all
kinds of changes.
Sponsors are predicting suc
cess this year, and it could be

cause little attention was paid
