# Assembly rejects student housing bill

### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” With visions of Animal House toga party
destruction, Assembly members refused Monday to outlaw
housing discrimination against students.
"There are problems with student tenants and I saw that
when I was a student," said 28-year-old freshman Assembly
man Patrick Nolan (R-Glendale) who opposed the bill.
After the 37-38 defeat of his A 8224, Assemblyman Howard
Berman (D-Los Angeles) asked for a second vote on another
day.
Other opponents complained of law students suing land
lords to practice their studies and of elderly tenants subjected
to huge security deposits that landlords might feel they would
have to charge all tenants to cover student destruction.
Bill supporters countered that students had a difficult time
finding housing in a tight market and the bill still allowed
landlords to evict or refuse to rent to students, as well as other
tenants, who didn't pay rent or destroyed property.
A similar version of the bill was passed last summer by both
houses,but Berman was unable to get back to the Assembly
for final approval before the session's closing deadline.
The bill would make it unlawful for a landlord to refuse to
sell, rent or lease housing to anyone solely because of student
status. Violators would be liable for actual damages, plus at
torney fees and punitive damages of not less than $500.
"The pattern of discrimination is widespread," Berman said.
"In a tight housing market, it is difficult for students to get
housing at a reasonable price."
Assemblyman John Thurman (D-Modesto) pointing out that
landlords could still require a 12-month lease under the bill,
said it was "embarrassing and deplorable that students can be
denied housing strictlv because thev are students."
And Asemblyman William Ivers (R-Flitridge) said landlords
would have to raise all security deposits to cover possible
damage by students and the elderly would be unable to afford
the amounts.
"The Legislature is going too doggone far in coming up with
this new class of people against whom you cannot discrimi
nate," added Assemblyman Paul Priolo (R-Malibu). "How far
are we going to go?"
