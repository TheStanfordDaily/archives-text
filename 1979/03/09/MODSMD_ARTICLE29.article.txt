## Cardinal nine hosts USC 
### Cathy Dickerson 
It's a beautiful day for a
ballgame, and according to the
weatherman, Saturday and
Sunday will be that way also.
Appropriately enough, the
Stanford baseball team hosts
its sunny-weather, southern
California rivals, the USC Tro
jans.
Last weekend the Cards en
tered their league season,

traveling to Tucson to face the
Arizona Wildcats. It was a dis
appointing weekend, with the
Cards falling twice to the
Wildcats, and beating them
only once. This weekend again
brings league play, this time at
home against the Trojans.
Both teams enter the three
day, three-game series with 1 -2
records in Pac-10play. The Tro
jans are 9-8 overall this year
while the Cardinals boast a 15-4

mark.
USC is obviously not the
powerhouse it was last year
when it tore up the league
finishing 54-9 overall and first
in the Pac-8 with a 15-3 record.
Seven starters of last year's Tro
jan lineup did not return to the
team this year — victims of
graduation and the pro
baseball draft.
"Everybody keeps saying
USC is down this year," said
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "And it's true when
you compare this year's team
to last year's."
But Marquess cautioned,
"They have got a lot of
talented, young players . . .
they are going to be tough."
Despite changes in person
nel, the long-ball hitting repu
tation USC established during
the past couple of years still
holds. In the 17 games the Tro
jans have played this season,
Trojan batters have whacked
out 22 homeruns. Five of those
22 belong to returning right
fielder Keith Brown.
Another veteran in the out
field, senior Bob Skube, leads
Southern California with an
impressive .417 batting aver
age. Sophomore catcher Dave
Hodgins — a local product of
Santa Clara — trails Skube with
a .348 average.
None of the Trojan batters
can top Stanford's Mike
Codiroli, however, who is cur
rently packing a .468 average at
the plate. Bruce Walters —
who went 6 for 11 against the
University of Arizona last
weekend — now sports a .405
average and third baseman Phil
Wilson is next in line, batting
.364.
Pitching for Stanford this
weekend will be sophomore
Paul Grame and seniors Bruce
Fiala and Joe LoPresti. Grame
will face either Mike Couchee
or Dave Leeper of the Trojans
in today's opener, according to
one of USC's assistant
coaches.
Today's game will begin at
2:30 p.m. in Sunken Diamond.
Saturday and Sunday the
games are scheduled fori p.m.
starts.
