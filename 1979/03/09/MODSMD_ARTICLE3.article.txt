# Harris condemns power draft gives gov't
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
Any new system of peacetime
conscription would make it easier
for the U.S. government to go to
war and would enable the gov
ernment to control the lives of
young persons in a way that would
constitute a "total abrogation" of
their rights, political activist David
Harris said in a speech last night.
About 80 persons showed up for
the talk in Cubberley Auditorium
sponsored by a newly-formed
campus group, Students Against
the Draft. Harris criticized recent
efforts in the U.S. Congress to
reinstate mandatory government
service for young persons over age
18.
Harris, 1966-67 student body
president here, spent 20 months in
federal prison for draft evasion
during the Vietnam War. He cur
rently writes for the New York
Times Sunday Magazine.
He said peacetime conscription
would make it easy for the gov
ernmenttogo towarwithout mak
ing a formal declaration or going to
the American people to explain its
actions.
Repeat of Vietnam
He warned of a repeat of the Vie
tnam War during which the gov
ernment "didn't have to ask any
body except themselves when
they wanted to send a generation
of young people to die."
Harris said that the shortage of
recruits for the current volunteer
military forces claimed by some
may be the result of higher stan
dards that have allowed the milit
ary to turn away potential recruits
in an effort to reinforce their
claims that conscription is neces
sary.
Although the military asserts
that it wants to reintroduce man
datory service so that it will be able
to get more competent recruits,
Harris said, this is only a false con

cern. He said that conscription
were to resume, "they (the milit
ary) couldn't give a shit whether
you can spell."
If the shortage is real, Harris
said, then it reflects the lack of
trust that the American people
have in their government. One of
the reasons for this lack of trust is
that the leaders have failed to exp
lain what the mission of the milit
ary is. "The least they owe you is to
explain to you why you ought to do
it (become a soldier)."
Harris also warned that some of
the features of the old draft system
such as deferments might also be
used to channel young persons
into activities which are in the
"national interest," thus restrict
ing their choices to those areas or
mandatory service.
One of the greatest threats to
this country's peace is its own gov
ernment, Harris said. Once the
government is given additional
power to act militarily there is no
reason to believe they will not use
that power. He called conscription
"an act of war."
Harris also criticized conscrip
tion on the grounds that it builds
"compliance" in people rather
than the independent thought and
action that is necessary for citizens
of a democracy.
'Piece of meat'
He also said that plans which call
for the option of service outside of
the military cannot be classified as
"service" at all. "Service is an act
done by willing people of their
own free will. . . . Coercion has
nothing to do with service," he
said. "You're going to be a piece of
meat to them and they're going to
treat you like a piece of meat."
Harris said he is not optimistic
that the new proposals will be de
feated in Congress. "One thing
you'll notice about the history of
conscription is that they don't draft

politicians," he said.
The draft must be stopped be
fore it becomes law because once
in place it will be difficult to dis
lodge, Harris said. He said the pub
lic must make clear demonstra
tions that it "will not accept con
scription" and that it "will punish
politicians who support it."
Harris said the reason that the
old draft system was finally dis
mantled was because it was simply
not working. In order forthe infan
try to get one man they had to draft
three. Some refused to report.
Some of those drafted fled the
country, he said.
In Vietnam draftees often re
fused to take orders, he explained,
and in some cases tried to kill their
officers. In short, he said, people
refused to go along with the sys
tem. He said it was "only that kind
of rebellion" that finally brought
about the end of the draft.
He said it is important to create
as "wide and diverse a community

of opposition as possible." The
fear of a loss of liberties that would
result from conscription could
unite persons of all political lean
ings, he said.
He also said that any attempt
simply to register persons for a
draft should be opposed "as if it
were full-scale conscription" since
it sets up the mechanism necessary
for conscription to take place.
Harris predicted that action on a
bill for mandatory government
service would occur within a year
and would include women and
offer options other than military
service.
Harris said the "national press is
not taking it (the possibility of re
newed conscription) seriously."
They are taking their lead from the
politicians who have not yet op
posed it. He said that demonstra
tions and statements from "visi
ble" politicians would make con
scription an issue and only then
would the press give it coverage.

Any new system of peacetime
conscription would make it easier
for the U.S. government to go to
war and would enable the gov
ernment to control the lives of
young persons in a way that would
constitute a "total abrogation" of
their rights, political activist David
Harris said in a speech last night.
About 80 persons showed up for
the talk in Cubberley Auditorium
sponsored by a newly-formed
campus group, Students Against
the Draft. Harris criticized recent
efforts in the U.S. Congress to
reinstate mandatory government
service for young persons over age
18.
Harris, 1966-67 student body
president here, spent 20 months in
federal prison for draft evasion
during the Vietnam War. He cur
rently writes for the New York
Times Sunday Magazine.
He said peacetime conscription
would make it easy for the gov
ernmenttogo towarwithout mak
ing a formal declaration or going to
the American people to explain its
actions.
Repeat of Vietnam
He warned of a repeat of the Vie
tnam War during which the gov
ernment "didn't have to ask any
body except themselves when
they wanted to send a generation
of young people to die."
Harris said that the shortage of
recruits for the current volunteer
military forces claimed by some
may be the result of higher stan
dards that have allowed the milit
ary to turn away potential recruits
in an effort to reinforce their
claims that conscription is neces
sary.
Although the military asserts
that it wants to reintroduce man
datory service so that it will be able
to get more competent recruits,
Harris said, this is only a false con

cern. He said that conscription
were to resume, "they (the milit
ary) couldn't give a shit whether
you can spell."
If the shortage is real, Harris
said, then it reflects the lack of
trust that the American people
have in their government. One of
the reasons for this lack of trust is
that the leaders have failed to exp
lain what the mission of the milit
ary is. "The least they owe you is to
explain to you why you ought to do
it (become a soldier)."
Harris also warned that some of
the features of the old draft system
such as deferments might also be
used to channel young persons
into activities which are in the
"national interest," thus restrict
ing their choices to those areas or
mandatory service.
One of the greatest threats to
this country's peace is its own gov
ernment, Harris said. Once the
government is given additional
power to act militarily there is no
reason to believe they will not use
that power. He called conscription
"an act of war."
Harris also criticized conscrip
tion on the grounds that it builds
"compliance" in people rather
than the independent thought and
action that is necessary for citizens
of a democracy.
'Piece of meat'
He also said that plans which call
for the option of service outside of
the military cannot be classified as
"service" at all. "Service is an act
done by willing people of their
own free will. . . . Coercion has
nothing to do with service," he
said. "You're going to be a piece of
meat to them and they're going to
treat you like a piece of meat."
Harris said he is not optimistic
that the new proposals will be de
feated in Congress. "One thing
you'll notice about the history of
conscription is that they don't draft

politicians," he said.
The draft must be stopped be
fore it becomes law because once
in place it will be difficult to dis
lodge, Harris said. He said the pub
lic must make clear demonstra
tions that it "will not accept con
scription" and that it "will punish
politicians who support it."
Harris said the reason that the
old draft system was finally dis
mantled was because it was simply
not working. In order forthe infan
try to get one man they had to draft
three. Some refused to report.
Some of those drafted fled the
country, he said.
In Vietnam draftees often re
fused to take orders, he explained,
and in some cases tried to kill their
officers. In short, he said, people
refused to go along with the sys
tem. He said it was "only that kind
of rebellion" that finally brought
about the end of the draft.
He said it is important to create
as "wide and diverse a community

of opposition as possible." The
fear of a loss of liberties that would
result from conscription could
unite persons of all political lean
ings, he said.
He also said that any attempt
simply to register persons for a
draft should be opposed "as if it
were full-scale conscription" since
it sets up the mechanism necessary
for conscription to take place.
Harris predicted that action on a
bill for mandatory government
service would occur within a year
and would include women and
offer options other than military
service.
Harris said the "national press is
not taking it (the possibility of re
newed conscription) seriously."
They are taking their lead from the
politicians who have not yet op
posed it. He said that demonstra
tions and statements from "visi
ble" politicians would make con
scription an issue and only then
would the press give it coverage.
