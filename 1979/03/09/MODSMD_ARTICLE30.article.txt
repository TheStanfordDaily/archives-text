Santa Barbara — UCLA, the de
fending national women's bas
ketball champions, defeated
Stanford last night, 85-68, in the
first round of the AIAW Western
Regional tournament.
The most highly publicized
team in collegiate women's
basketball shot a blazing 65
percent from the floor com
pared to the humble 39 percent
shot by the Cards. But then,
layups are high-percentage
shots, and the Bruins had
plenty of those.
Forthe first 10 minutes of the
contest Stanford played intelli
gent, mature and aggressive
ball resulting in an 18-16 lead.
Louise Smith played extremely
tough under the boards and
Angie Paccione effectively ran
the team. With 9:45 remaining
in the first half, though, the
Cards lost their composure
and the lead.
The UCLA press, which had
not troubled Stanford earlier,
suddenly became a major obs
tacle. Like all good teams, the
Bruins took advantage of the
Cards' loss of confidence and
control. Promptly outscoring
Stanford 18-2 with many of the
aforementioned layups, UCLA
ran up a 36-20 lead with five
minutes to play.
Once assuming such a gar
gantuan lead, the Bruins con
trolled the tempo of the game.
Ail-American Denise Curry hit
on 10 of 12 shots en route to 20
points and Anita Ortega added
13 as the two Bruin stars out
scored Stanford themselves.
Curry's precision shooting
matched that of a Swiss
watchmaker as she swished
20-footers at will. Ortega, on
the other hand, directed the
most volatile fast break Stan
ford has seen this season. The
Cards were slow on their trans
itions and were continually
beat down the floor. The score
read UCLA 42, Stanford 28 as
both teams went to the loc
kers.
Curry and company added
another 10 points to the lead
almost before the fans could
settle.in their seats for the final
half. UCLA seemed to hit on
every shot it attempted and
poor shot selection added
further misery to the Cardinal
woes. The Bruins ran up
anotherscoring streak, extend
ing the lead t063-32 and with 14
minutes remaining it only

■
seemed to be a matter of prid»
for Stanford.
The Cards played with cour
age and attention for the dura
tion of the game, refusing to
give up. Coach Dottie McCrea
then gave her players a new
challenge — cut the lead to
under 20. Down by 32, the
women began to chip at the
lead.
Shutting out the Bruins for
over three minutes, Stanford
ran off 12 straight points and
narrowed the gap to 15. The
contest concluded with UCLA
ahead by a 17-point margin. -
In contrast to many of Stan
ford's opponents this season,
the Bruins' high level of per-'
formance was not a fluke. Just
how well, though, they can
maintain their fine play will de
termine whether they can re
tain their crown.
Curry and Ortega led UCLA
with 26 and 20 points respec
tively, while )eanne Ruark con
tributed 25 points. Stanford
committed only 16 turnovers
though, in comparison to the'
Bruins' 27, but, more import
tantly, they were out
rebounded 40-23. While UCLA
often did not need second ef
forts, they successfully kept
Stanford to one shot most of
the evening.
So the women's basketball
season is over. It has been
memorable year, but it is just
the beginning for greater
things to come. Although the
team is young and has much to
learn, it possesses the deter
mination that will make it
tougher with each subsequent
year. And somehow, while
watching this final game, one
could easily sense the feeling
that the Cards will be back and
go even further.

CARDINAL FORWARD Kathy Murphy soars for a jumper against San
lose Slate in Maples Pavilion. Last night Stanford must have felt
homesick, losing to UCLA in Santa Barbara 85-68, ending the wo
men's season.
Santa Barbara — UCLA, the de
fending national women's bas
ketball champions, defeated
Stanford last night, 85-68, in the
first round of the AIAW Western
Regional tournament.
The most highly publicized
team in collegiate women's
basketball shot a blazing 65
percent from the floor com
pared to the humble 39 percent
shot by the Cards. But then,
layups are high-percentage
shots, and the Bruins had
plenty of those.
Forthe first 10 minutes of the
contest Stanford played intelli
gent, mature and aggressive
ball resulting in an 18-16 lead.
Louise Smith played extremely
tough under the boards and
Angie Paccione effectively ran
the team. With 9:45 remaining
in the first half, though, the
Cards lost their composure
and the lead.
The UCLA press, which had
not troubled Stanford earlier,
suddenly became a major obs
tacle. Like all good teams, the
Bruins took advantage of the
Cards' loss of confidence and
control. Promptly outscoring
Stanford 18-2 with many of the
aforementioned layups, UCLA
ran up a 36-20 lead with five
minutes to play.
Once assuming such a gar
gantuan lead, the Bruins con
trolled the tempo of the game.
Ail-American Denise Curry hit
on 10 of 12 shots en route to 20
points and Anita Ortega added
13 as the two Bruin stars out
scored Stanford themselves.
Curry's precision shooting
matched that of a Swiss
watchmaker as she swished
20-footers at will. Ortega, on
the other hand, directed the
most volatile fast break Stan
ford has seen this season. The
Cards were slow on their trans
itions and were continually
beat down the floor. The score
read UCLA 42, Stanford 28 as
both teams went to the loc
kers.
Curry and company added
another 10 points to the lead
almost before the fans could
settle.in their seats for the final
half. UCLA seemed to hit on
every shot it attempted and
poor shot selection added
further misery to the Cardinal
woes. The Bruins ran up
anotherscoring streak, extend
ing the lead t063-32 and with 14
minutes remaining it only

■
seemed to be a matter of prid»
for Stanford.
The Cards played with cour
age and attention for the dura
tion of the game, refusing to
give up. Coach Dottie McCrea
then gave her players a new
challenge — cut the lead to
under 20. Down by 32, the
women began to chip at the
lead.
Shutting out the Bruins for
over three minutes, Stanford
ran off 12 straight points and
narrowed the gap to 15. The
contest concluded with UCLA
ahead by a 17-point margin. -
In contrast to many of Stan
ford's opponents this season,
the Bruins' high level of per-'
formance was not a fluke. Just
how well, though, they can
maintain their fine play will de
termine whether they can re
tain their crown.
Curry and Ortega led UCLA
with 26 and 20 points respec
tively, while )eanne Ruark con
tributed 25 points. Stanford
committed only 16 turnovers
though, in comparison to the'
Bruins' 27, but, more import
tantly, they were out
rebounded 40-23. While UCLA
often did not need second ef
forts, they successfully kept
Stanford to one shot most of
the evening.
So the women's basketball
season is over. It has been
memorable year, but it is just
the beginning for greater
things to come. Although the
team is young and has much to
learn, it possesses the deter
mination that will make it
tougher with each subsequent
year. And somehow, while
watching this final game, one
could easily sense the feeling
that the Cards will be back and
go even further.
