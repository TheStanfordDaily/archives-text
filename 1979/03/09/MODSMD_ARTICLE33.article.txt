# Top-ranked Mustangs ride into Farm
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's two-time defend
ing NCAA championship ten
nis team puts it 4-0 winning
streak on the line this week.
The Cards dropped to No. 2 in
the latest coach's poll behind
Southern Methodist University
(SMU) and must face the Mus
tangs this Saturday at Stanford
Tennis Stadium at noon. In
what will be a telling week for
the Cards, they must also face
No. 9 ranked Texas Tuesday at
1:30 and No. 3 ranked Trinity

Thursday at Stanford Stadium.
"SMU has been in the thick
of things in the NCAA for the
past two years," said Card
coach Dick Could, whose team
dumped the Mustangs 7-2 in
the NCAA semi-finals last year.
"The team is highly experi
enced. It's good at the top of
the ladder and all the way
down."
"Jai Di Louie is a great
player," said injured team
member John Rast of SMU's
top player. "And the number

two through six men are dead
even."
Following Di Louie is senior
Mark Turpin, junior Drew Git
lin, sophomore Tommy Cain,
and seniors Chris Delaney and
Mark Vines.
The team is so tough that
Junior Wimbledon Finalist Jeff
Turpin is only playing No. 8.
This year the Mustangs are 8-1
including capturing the Na
tional Team Indoors in Madi
son, Wise. Theironly loss was a
7-2 decision at the hands of

Trinity, a team which they beat
en route to the Indoor Champ
ionship.
The Cards, of course, are
going to be without Matt
Mitchell, who has decided to
turn pro, and John Rast has still
not fully recovered from a back
injury. Peter Rennert therefore
will have to pick up the load at
first singles. Rennert downed
Nial Brash today of San Jose
State 6-3, 6-2. Lloyd Bourne,
who dropped a decision, will
be moved up to the number
two slot. All in all the Cards
have three freshmen and three
juniors against the more ex
perienced SMU team. For the
first time in who knows how
long Gould has a team with no
Ail-Americans and no NCAA
individual champions. In fact,
no member of the team has
ever played in the NCAA indi
vidual tournament.
However, the Cards are not
ready to throw in the towel yet.
"Player for player we match
up real well against them," said
team member Jim Hodges.
"They're tough but you
have to remember that we're
playing at home," pointed out
sophomore team member
Andy Chase. "With a big crowd
out which includes those wild
Zetes, that has to work in our
favor."
Tuesday, the Cards host a
tough Texas team that must be
reckoned with. Ail-American
seniors Kevin Curren and Steve
Denton head the tough Texas
team which includes three
freshmen.

Yesterday the Cards, in their
final tune up before they start
their toughest week of the sea
son, downed San Jose State
6V2-2V2.
"We did a pretty good job
today," commented Gould.
"Our freshmen went unde
feated and I was glad to see
that. We needed this win for
momentum going into the
matches this week. I'm looking
forward to it and the team is
really excited about playing
them."
The Cards had better be up
for this week because these are
the toughest matches on the
schedule. Tickets will go on
sale at 11:30 a.m. Saturday for
the SMU match, at 11 a.m. on
Tuesday for Texas and Thurs
day for Trinity. There are no re
served seats, tickets are $1 on a
first come, first served basis.
