Spikers host Occidental
The Cardinal men's track and
field team faces a tough chal
lenge tomorrow at Stanford
Stadium as it entertains Occi
dental, the defending NCAA
Division 111 champion. Field
events start at 1:15 p.m., and
the first running event begins
at 1:45 p.m.
Stanford owns a 2-1 mark in
dual meets. Last Saturday the
Cards trounced Fresno State
111-51 and earlier topped Hay
ward State 110-52 and lost to
San Jose State 94-69.
"We're meeting a champ
ionship team from a school
with a fine tradition," said Card
coach Payton Jordan, who was
the mentor at Occidental from
1946-56. "Occidental has good
field event strength, plus excel
lent hurdlers and middle
distance runners. Their mile
relay team ran 3:16 last
weekend, so they're well
ahead of our team at present."
Last Saturday Stanford's top
performers were Bill Gail, who
broke Jack Bellah's 1976 school
record of 8:58.4 in the 3000-
meter steeplechase with a
8:53.6 clocking last Saturday;
Darrin Nelson, who tied the
meet record in the long jump
with a 25-2 leap on his opening
attempt and won the 100 met
ers in 10.6; and sprinter Rick
Gervais, who captured the 200
meters in 21.6.

Rugby and brew
Tomorrow Stanford's rugby
team hosts hated California.
The rugby tradition between
the two schools is almost as old
and as colorful as the yearly
football game. Indeed, from
1906 through 1914 rugby was
the Big Game â€” football was
not played at all.
The fans can get a chance to
join in rugby's oldest tradition:
the consumption of a malt
based alcoholic beverage. As at
any good rugby game, beer
(and lots of it) will flow on the
sidelines. The brew is free as
the Cardinals meet the Golden
Bears on Maloney Field at 1
p.m.
Links notes
The men's golf team finishes
competition today at the UC-
Davis Intercollegiates held at
Sacramento's Rancho Murietta
Golf Course, a tournament
which began yesterday.
Leading Stanford will be
junior Steve Schroeder and
freshman David Games.
Schroeder, who won the John
Burns I ntercollegiates in
Hawaii, placed eighth in last
week's Pacific Coast Intercol
legiates at Riverside with a 143,
while Games finished close
behind at 145.
Even greater honors fell to
Card assistant coach Mike Peck

and sophomore Doug Clarke.
Both have been named to the
U.S. Walker Cup Team which
will compete at Great Britain's
Muir Field May 30 through June
2.
Peck, a three-time All -
American for Stanford from
1976-78, is also scheduled to
play in the revered Masters
Tournament April 12-15.
