# Gymnasts spring toward Nor-Cal
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's women gymnasts
get their chance to set the re
cord straight in tomorrow
night's Nor-Cal conference
championship meet.
The 7 p.m. competition at
Berkeley's Harmon Gym won't
allow the Cardinals to alter
their 4-5 regular season mark,
but they do have the opportun

ity to square accounts with de
fending conference champ San
Jose State and California. The
Spartans beat Stanford by a
mere .65 the last time the two
tangled in Maples, and Stan
ford was an upset victim of the
Golden Bears by a 119.10 to
114.60 margin on their last ven
ture to Cal.
"As a team we should be in

second and we have the
chance of winning it," coach
Jackie Walker said. "We've
(San Jose and Stanford) proba
bly both improved proportion
ately about the same, so it
should be a close meet. As for
Cal, that (119.10) was their
highest score of the year, so I
don't expect anything higherat
all from them and we should be
able to beat them with our
strongest team and everybody
fairly healthy."
With the exception of assis
tant coach Tom Corall, who
sprained his ankle and Jeanette
Lacoste who's recovering from
a cold, the team is in good
health.
"They have the old minor
aches and pains; nothing new
though, thank goodness,"
Walker explained.
Workouts have been prog
ressing well, particularly last
week which was "super," ac
cording to Walker.
"They are just feeling the ef
fects of the heat — it's been hot
in here the past few days," she
said. "I think it's more the con
trast, not that it's really hot, just
that it went from cold to warm
suddenly and it makes them
tired."
Despite the tropical climate
of Encina Gym the Cards are
prepared for the Nor-Cals.
"They're as ready as they've
ever been — they're in the best
shape for any meet they've had
this year," Walker stated. "I

think they are really looking
forward to it, mentally they're
peaking. They are excited
about it."
One of the exciting aspects
of the meet should be the all
around competition, with
Fresno State's Kim Sanders,
San Jose's Kris Buchanan and
Card Karen Hall leading the in
dividual contest, according to
Walker.
Stanford's tentative lineup
lists Cindy Sedlund, Pilar Os
sorio, Linda Park, Cindy
Stevenson, Annie Smith and
Hall in the vaulting event. On
uneven bars, it will be Ossorio,
Park, Stevenson, Lacoste,
Smith and Hall. The roster for
beam names Ossorio, Sed
lund, Park, Lacoste, Smith and
Hall, while in floor exercise it
will be Stevenson, Ossorio,
Sedlund, Park, Smith and Hall,
Besides determining the
conference champion, the
Nor-Cal performances will also
help indicate which teams can
qualify for regional competi
tion for the at-large spots.
"I'm trying to act really calm,
but I'm concerned, not about
the girls' abilities, but about
something I can't control —
the scoring system that
decides if we go to reg
ional," Walker said. "It's
not so much how we're doing
as a team, but how we're doing
with respect to the other teams
in the region. I'll find out Sun
day between 10 and 12."
