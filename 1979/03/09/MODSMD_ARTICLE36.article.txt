# Top seeds loom large in IM championships
## 
### Kevin Macgillivray 
Stanford's varsity basketball
team may not have received an
NCAA playoff berth, but the
basketball season on the Farm
is far from over. The intramural
basketball playoffs have been
raging on for nearly two weeks
and they will culminate this
Sunday, with all the University
championships at stake.
In men's A-league, the three
top seeds are still alive. In one
semi-final match-up, theZetes
challenge FACE in what could
shape up to be the most in
tense game of the season.
FACE, the No. 1 seed, reached
the semis by virtue of a 52-31
victory over Sleep and Dreams.
TheZetes, unseeded, are try
ing to retain the A-league
championship they captured
last winter. They upended the
Theta Delts, the No. 4 seed, in
the quarterfinals.
The other A-league semi
final matches the second and
third-seeded clubs, Loss Cau
sation and the Bootables. Both
teams had easy quarterfinal
victories and are riding waves
of momentum into their show
down.
Incidentally, these two
teams played each other in the
semi-finals last year, with the
Law School team proving to be
just a little better.Rumor has it
that the Boots might drop this
one also and that Loss Causa
tion is the favorite to win the
A-league crown.
In B-league games, there
have been few surprises. No.
1-ranked and undefeated Off
the-Wall Gang (OTWG) ad
vanced past the Phi Delte to
gain a semi-final berth against
No. 5-seeded Phred's Faces.
In the other bracket,

second-seeded Branner has
been winning impressively and
is challenged by the Blue Hens
to see who will play in Sunday's
final.
The Blue Hens have over
come a late-season upset and
polished off both the No. 3 and
the No. 6 seeds in earlier
playoff action.
However, they will probably
advance no further. Branner
looks too fast and too strong.
Look for a Branner-OTWG

match-up in the finals, with the
No. 1-seeded OTWG falling in
a close game to the all
freshman dorm.
C-league action finds the
four top seeds in the semi
finals. The first seed, Geek's
Greeks, plays the No. 4-seed,
Burton 5. In the other game,
Gavilan and Kulos take he
court.Gavilan is the favorite
over Kulos and even though
they are seeded second, watch
for them to give Flo Mo its first

basketball championship in a
long, long time by upending
Geek's Greeks.
Women's hoop
In women's A-league, No.
1-ranked and undefeated Hoc
key Red won by forfeit in their
semi-final match. To see who
will face them in the finals, The
Substituents play FYIYCTAJ in a
semi-final game. FYIYCTAJ
should take this one, but Hoc
key Red is too formidable and
should gather the women's

championship with a victory on
Sunday.
B-league playoffs find top
seeded Trancos and u weeded
SMACK squared off against
each other in one semi-final.
The winner of this game will
play the other semi-final win
ner, either the Soto Woosies or
the SAE Sisters of Minerva. Ex
pect No. 2-ranked Soto to beat
SAE and move into a Soto-
Trancos affair for Sunday's fi
nal.
The schedule for Sunday's
? james looks like this:
2:00 noon C-league finals
1:00 p.m Men's B-league finals
2:00 p.m Men's A-league finals
3:00 p.m Women's A-league finals
4:00 p.m Women's B-league finals
All games will be at Maples
Pavilion and everyone is urged
to attend. The games may not
be as exciting as Stanford-
UCLA or an "A" in Chem. 33,
but they will certainly be
more exhilarating than pre-
Dead Week studies.

last winter. They upended the
Theta Delts, the No. 4 seed, in
the quarterfinals.
The other A-league semi
final matches the second and
third-seeded clubs, Loss Cau
sation and the Bootables. Both
teams had easy quarterfinal
victories and are riding waves
of momentum into their show
down.
Incidentally, these two
teams played each other in the
semi-finals last year, with the
Law School team proving to be
just a little better.Rumor has it
that the Boots might drop this
one also and that Loss Causa
tion is the favorite to win the
A-league crown.
In B-league games, there
have been few surprises. No.
1-ranked and undefeated Off
the-Wall Gang (OTWG) ad
vanced past the Phi Delte to
gain a semi-final berth against
No. 5-seeded Phred's Faces.
In the other bracket,

second-seeded Branner has
been winning impressively and
is challenged by the Blue Hens
to see who will play in Sunday's
final.
The Blue Hens have over
come a late-season upset and
polished off both the No. 3 and
the No. 6 seeds in earlier
playoff action.
However, they will probably
advance no further. Branner
looks too fast and too strong.
Look for a Branner-OTWG

match-up in the finals, with the
No. 1-seeded OTWG falling in
a close game to the all
freshman dorm.
C-league action finds the
four top seeds in the semi
finals. The first seed, Geek's
Greeks, plays the No. 4-seed,
Burton 5. In the other game,
Gavilan and Kulos take he
court.Gavilan is the favorite
over Kulos and even though
they are seeded second, watch
for them to give Flo Mo its first

basketball championship in a
long, long time by upending
Geek's Greeks.
Women's hoop
In women's A-league, No.
1-ranked and undefeated Hoc
key Red won by forfeit in their
semi-final match. To see who
will face them in the finals, The
Substituents play FYIYCTAJ in a
semi-final game. FYIYCTAJ
should take this one, but Hoc
key Red is too formidable and
should gather the women's

championship with a victory on
Sunday.
B-league playoffs find top
seeded Trancos and u weeded
SMACK squared off against
each other in one semi-final.
The winner of this game will
play the other semi-final win
ner, either the Soto Woosies or
the SAE Sisters of Minerva. Ex
pect No. 2-ranked Soto to beat
SAE and move into a Soto-
Trancos affair for Sunday's fi
nal.
The schedule for Sunday's
? james looks like this:
2:00 noon C-league finals
1:00 p.m Men's B-league finals
2:00 p.m Men's A-league finals
3:00 p.m Women's A-league finals
4:00 p.m Women's B-league finals
All games will be at Maples
Pavilion and everyone is urged
to attend. The games may not
be as exciting as Stanford-
UCLA or an "A" in Chem. 33,
but they will certainly be
more exhilarating than pre-
Dead Week studies.
