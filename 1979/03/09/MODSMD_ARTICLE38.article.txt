### John Doane 
Cal and Stanford, both new
comers to the world of major
college volleyball, will have a
lot more than win-loss records
at stake when the two teams
collide tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
"We won't have to try too
hard to get fired up," said Stan
ford coach Fred Sturm in a bit
of an understatement. "We're
very hungry for this win."
Volleyball's version of
the Big Game has developed
into a good, old-fashioned

Stanford-Cal rivalry, one
where as television commen
tators are prone to say, "You
can throw away the win-loss
records."
In fact, both teams will enter
the match trying to do just that.
Stanford is 0-7 in CIVA play,
while Cal is little better at 1-6.
Nevertheless, Stanford has
come extremely close to win
ning at least three of those
matches, and Cal is no
pushover.
"They're a good team," said
Sturm of Cal. "They've held
their own in all their matches."

Leading the Golden Bear at
tack will be senior middle
blocker Jack Haggler, who
"has a lot of talent," according
to Sturm. Eric Anderson, who
spent this autumn as a back-up
quarterback for the Cal foot
ball squad, will set the 6-2 Cal
offense.
On the other side of the net,
Stanford will be led by s'B" set
ter Kip Engen and junior
middle-blockers Rod Fletcher
and Kim Lum.
"We'll be ready," said
Sturm. "And I'm sure we'll play
very well."
