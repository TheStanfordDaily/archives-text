# Med School income down
## University may run deficit 
### Mike Charlson 
An increase in Medical School income inadequate to
meet projected expenditures will likely result in the Uni
versity's first operating budget deficit in three years dur
ing 1979-80, according to a budget proposal which will
be presented to the Board of Trustees for approval next
week.
Under the guidelines presented to the Faculty Senate
March 1 and outlined in detail for student leaders yes
terday, a $290,000 deficit is forecast in a budget expected
to total nearly $129 million.
The operating budget includes expenditures involved
in the core activities of teaching and departmental sup
port within the University.
Such expenses also include student services, student
aid, maintenance and operations, libraries and ad
ministration.
The operating budget will represent about 30 percent
of the University's consolidated budget, expected to
total $435 million in 1979-80. The consolidated budget
includes the operating budget plus budgets for all other
University auxiliary services such as the University food
service, the housing system and the Hospital.
Med School blamed
The deficit is fully attributable to income problems at
the Med School, according to Raymond Bacchetti, vice
provost for budget and planning.
Several factors from increased allocation costs for
steam and chilled water from the University central plant
to reduced tuition increases at the Med School will make
income tight next year.
The most important factor cited, however, concerns
reimbursement to the Med School for faculty practice.
Several complex factors ranging from cost recovery for
faculty services from Medicare and Medi-Cal, to the
school's greater dependence on faculty practice reim
bursement income with less stress on cost reimburse
ment from research, will leave the Med School with a
deficit.
Reserves to pay
The deficit in the operating budget will be paid for
entirely out of Med School reserves. The school plans to
balance the budget in 1980-81, according to Kent Peter
son, director of management and financial planning.
The budget proposals represent a 9.1 percent increase
in expenditure over the $118 million budgeted for this
year. This compares with the 9 percent jump the budget

took last year.
According to Bacchetti, the increase of $10.7 million in
next year's budget can be attributed to three areas —
maintenance of existing programs, consolidation costs
and improvements. This year the latter two will account
for overa third of the increase, significantly more than in
the past.
More TAs
More teaching assistants and faculty positions, more
money for language instruction and some $60,000 for
institution of the proposed Western Culture require
ment are a large part of the improvement expenditures.
In addition, Bacchetti said that over this year and the
next, some $300,000 will be spent to open the Green
Library addition, scheduled to open next fall.
Student aid under the proposal will rise some 11 per
cent to $7.2 million next year. Along with the increase in
outlay, the University plans to increase the self-help
expectation — the amount undergraduates are expected
to contribute to their own education through a job or
loan — by $200 for most students. Very-low-income stu
dents will see a $100 self-help expectation increase.
Bacchetti said the University self-help expectation is
consistent with that of comparable institutions. In addi
tion, the University, in figuring student budgets for the
year, will increase the books-and-personal-expense al
lowance by $100 to $800. The figure of $700 for such
expenses had been used for the past two years.
Policy unchanged
Bacchetti said the self-help increase does not "alter
the University's policy of meeting all demonstrated need
of all undergraduates who are admitted and enroll."
He indicated that the books-and-personal-expense al
lowance is also currently under review. A student intern
in the Academic Planning Office, Dan Garton, is now
completing a study which shows that students spend
considerably more than $800, perhaps as much as twice
that amount, on books and personal expenses.
While citing several statistical problems with the
study, Garton said ye.terday that one can conclude that
the amount students spend is "much higher" than the
amount allocated by the University when figuring stu
dent budgets.
Garton said underestimating expenses is a serious
problem because it misleads students into thinking they
will be spending less than they actually do and because it
