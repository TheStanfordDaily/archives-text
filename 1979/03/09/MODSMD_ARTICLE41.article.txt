Carter, Sadat to discuss treaty
Cairo, Egypt — President Jimmy Carter launched his
personal peace mission yesterday among tens of
thousands of cheering Egyptians and conferred for 2Vi
hours with President Anwar Sadat. But a U.S. official said
Egypt's leaders were "not too happy" with American
compromise terms for a peace treaty with Israel.
Egypt presented its own counter-proposal, but the
terms were not disclosed. The substance of the Carter-
Sadat talks at Cairo's Tahra Palace were not disclosed
either.
The White House said only that the two leaders dis
cussed "unresolved issues" in the quest for an
Egyptian-Israeli peace accord.
"You can assume the Egyptians are not too happy,"
the U.S. official said after the talks.
It was understood that the United States would be
very reluctant to modify the compromise suggestions.
The Israelis made a request to that effect and were
turned down.
Rebels threaten Ugandan capital
Nairobi, Kenya — Tanzanian troops and Ugandan re
bels racing up a highway toward Uganda's capital of
Kampala yesterday were closing in on a town just 25
miles south of the city, Uganda's official radio reported.
Western diplomats in Nairobi said a battle may be
shaping up at the town, Mpigi, that could decide the fate
of Ugandan President Idi Amin's eight-year rule.
The Ugandan broadcast, monitored here, was the first
confirmation by the beleaguered Amin that the invasion
force was virtually at the doorstep of his capital.
The radio said Amin — "the conqueror of the British
Empire and chief of staff of the joint services" — was not
worried about the situation. But he was quoted as
exhorting his officers "to be the last to leave a military
objective and to fight until the last man."
Chinese troops begin withdrawal
Tokyo — The first contingent of Chinese troops has
returned home from fighting in Vietnam, and China
accused the Vietnamese of shelling its withdrawing sol
diers, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua
(Hsinhua) said yesterday.
China said the first returning troops crossed the
Sino-Vietnamese border and were given a heroes' wel
come at Friendship Pass just north of the Sino-
Vietnamese border.
Xinhua did not say how many troops had returned or

to what units they belonged. It said, "Vietnamese troops
have time and again bombarded and harrassed with
drawing Chinese frontier forces" over the past few days.
It was the first official announcement by Peking that
Chinese troops have returned home following its prop
osal for cease-fire talks at the ministerial level.
Vietnam has said it would be prepared to negotiate
once a total withdrawal of Chinese troops took place.
Women's Day protested, celebrated
Chanting "at the dawn of freedom we have no free
dom," more than 8000 Iranian women, defiantly dressed
in Western clothing, paraded through Tehran on Inter
national Women's Day yesterday to demand preserva
tion of their rights under the new Islamic regime.
Thousands of women in other countries paraded or
held meetings to mark the day set aside by the United
Nations to improve the rights of women around the
world.
In Rome about 10,000 women, many carrying signs,
marched. One sign read: "March 8, Women's Day; and
the other days." In Milan, groups of women encircled
men and danced around them. The Union of Italian
Women announced it would form a tribunal to "try"
cases of abuse against women.
In China, the day was marked by a reception for more
than 3000 foreign women, billed as the largest such
gathering in Peking in a decade.

Carter, Sadat to discuss treaty
Cairo, Egypt — President Jimmy Carter launched his
personal peace mission yesterday among tens of
thousands of cheering Egyptians and conferred for 2Vi
hours with President Anwar Sadat. But a U.S. official said
Egypt's leaders were "not too happy" with American
compromise terms for a peace treaty with Israel.
Egypt presented its own counter-proposal, but the
terms were not disclosed. The substance of the Carter-
Sadat talks at Cairo's Tahra Palace were not disclosed
either.
The White House said only that the two leaders dis
cussed "unresolved issues" in the quest for an
Egyptian-Israeli peace accord.
"You can assume the Egyptians are not too happy,"
the U.S. official said after the talks.
It was understood that the United States would be
very reluctant to modify the compromise suggestions.
The Israelis made a request to that effect and were
turned down.
Rebels threaten Ugandan capital
Nairobi, Kenya — Tanzanian troops and Ugandan re
bels racing up a highway toward Uganda's capital of
Kampala yesterday were closing in on a town just 25
miles south of the city, Uganda's official radio reported.
Western diplomats in Nairobi said a battle may be
shaping up at the town, Mpigi, that could decide the fate
of Ugandan President Idi Amin's eight-year rule.
The Ugandan broadcast, monitored here, was the first
confirmation by the beleaguered Amin that the invasion
force was virtually at the doorstep of his capital.
The radio said Amin — "the conqueror of the British
Empire and chief of staff of the joint services" — was not
worried about the situation. But he was quoted as
exhorting his officers "to be the last to leave a military
objective and to fight until the last man."
