Two incidents of indecent exposure were reported to
the Dept. of Public Safety this week. Both exposures
occurred on Tuesday morning, one on the Stanford Golf
Course and another on the lawn of Adelfa House in
Lagunita dorm. Descriptions of the exhibitionists are
similar, according to Captain Raoul Niemeyer. In fact,
Niemeyer said the exposures may have been committed
by the same individual. Victims in both cases describe
the exhibitionist as a white male, in his early 20s, approx
imately 5'10" and 180 lbs. The police have no suspect in
the case.
