# Fraud charged in Lucas case
## 
### Seth Zuckerman 
Though satisfied with Tuesday's,
decision to suspend Assoc. Prof, of
Surgery Zoltan Lucas, Prof, of Car
diovascular Surgery Eugene Dong
said the University avoided the far
more serious issue of Lucas' alleged
falsification of experimental results.
A colleague had accused Lucas of
reporting false research results in his
experiments on rat kidney trans
plants. Dong did not specify the ac
tion he wanted the University to
take.
The University has been investigat
ing the Lucas affair since 1973, when
reports that Lucas had been dishon
est first came to the attention of the

dean of the Medical School.
In 1977, a committee was consti
tuted to look into charges that Lucas
had cited publications of his own that
were neither published nor submit
ted to professional journals.
The committee found that
had done so in a significant number
of cases, said Robert Rosenzweig,
vice-president for public affairs.
Lyman suspended him for 12 weeks
on the basis of this finding.
According to Rosenzweig, a com
mittee will oversee Lucas' research
for two years after he returns from
his suspension.
Martin Eichner, attorney for
Baronio Martin, who made the origi
nal allegations of fraud against Lucas,
said individuals had complained to
the National Institute of Health (NIH)
about the Lucas case, and that his
"deduction is that NIH finally told
Stanford to do something about it."
'Avoiding issue'
Regardless of the "pressures"
applied to the University, Dong said
that "it appears the University is av
oiding the key issue of intentional
fraud" in Lucas' transplants in rats.
Rosenzweig disagreed. "We did
not find evidence of intentional mis
representation. I think what he did
was serious and it was dealt with
seriously. It's a public admission of
wrong-doing and that's not insig
nificant. It's not lenient," he said.
Eichner was of a different opinion,
however. "It's pretty hard to call that
carelessness," he said.
Dong said, though, that the Uni
versity has never asked for eye
witness evidence, and that this might
be one reason the University has no
conclusive evidence that deliberate
fraud has occurred.
The FBI has also investigated the

Lucas case, but Joe Erran of the FBI
public relations office said it "would
be unfair" to comment on the Uni
versity's decision to suspend Lucas.
He said, however, that the FBl's in
vestigation of the case is "closed"
and that information gathered has
been conveyed to the U.S. Attor
ney's Office.
Mark Samuels of the U.S. Attor
ney's Office said that the Lucas case
has not been opened orassigned yet,
but explained that it sometimes takes
a week for a case to be processed ar|d
allocated within the office.
In Washington, Ralph Curens of
the National Institute of Health (NIH)
said he has received no documenta
tion of Lucas' suspension. "I'm sure
when we do hear something, we will
do something about it,"he said,
though he declined to say what the
NIH is investigating in the Lucas case,
if anything.
Another grant
Lucas recently received another
$120,000 from the NIH for cancer
related research.
But Eichner said that he feels "evi
dence will come out proving that
there was fraudulent research."
Beyond that, Dong said two issues
remain unresolved. One of these is
the question of restitution.
"If false information has been pub
lished, the University must make
sure the scientific community knows
which publications contain false
data," he said.
The other is that "the University
hasn't addressed its own culpability
in excessive delay and inadequate
exposuhe." He further cited the fai
lure of the University to communi
cate with the faculty before taking
disciplinary action against one of its
members.

had cited publications of his own that
were neither published nor submit
ted to professional journals.
The committee found that
had done so in a significant number
of cases, said Robert Rosenzweig,
vice-president for public affairs.
Lyman suspended him for 12 weeks
on the basis of this finding.
According to Rosenzweig, a com
mittee will oversee Lucas' research
for two years after he returns from
his suspension.
Martin Eichner, attorney for
Baronio Martin, who made the origi
nal allegations of fraud against Lucas,
said individuals had complained to
the National Institute of Health (NIH)
about the Lucas case, and that his
"deduction is that NIH finally told
Stanford to do something about it."
'Avoiding issue'
Regardless of the "pressures"
applied to the University, Dong said
that "it appears the University is av
oiding the key issue of intentional
fraud" in Lucas' transplants in rats.
Rosenzweig disagreed. "We did
not find evidence of intentional mis
representation. I think what he did
was serious and it was dealt with
seriously. It's a public admission of
wrong-doing and that's not insig
nificant. It's not lenient," he said.
Eichner was of a different opinion,
however. "It's pretty hard to call that
carelessness," he said.
Dong said, though, that the Uni
versity has never asked for eye
witness evidence, and that this might
be one reason the University has no
conclusive evidence that deliberate
fraud has occurred.
The FBI has also investigated the

Lucas case, but Joe Erran of the FBI
public relations office said it "would
be unfair" to comment on the Uni
versity's decision to suspend Lucas.
He said, however, that the FBl's in
vestigation of the case is "closed"
and that information gathered has
been conveyed to the U.S. Attor
ney's Office.
Mark Samuels of the U.S. Attor
ney's Office said that the Lucas case
has not been opened orassigned yet,
but explained that it sometimes takes
a week for a case to be processed ar|d
allocated within the office.
In Washington, Ralph Curens of
the National Institute of Health (NIH)
said he has received no documenta
tion of Lucas' suspension. "I'm sure
when we do hear something, we will
do something about it,"he said,
though he declined to say what the
NIH is investigating in the Lucas case,
if anything.
Another grant
Lucas recently received another
$120,000 from the NIH for cancer
related research.
But Eichner said that he feels "evi
dence will come out proving that
there was fraudulent research."
Beyond that, Dong said two issues
remain unresolved. One of these is
the question of restitution.
"If false information has been pub
lished, the University must make
sure the scientific community knows
which publications contain false
data," he said.
The other is that "the University
hasn't addressed its own culpability
in excessive delay and inadequate
exposuhe." He further cited the fai
lure of the University to communi
cate with the faculty before taking
disciplinary action against one of its
members.
