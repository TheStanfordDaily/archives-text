# Lyman talks on provost, Lomita, prof suspension
## 
### Rob Lempert Senior staff writer 
The search committee charged
with finding a new provost has pre
sented a list of candidates and re
commendations to President Richard
Lyman for consideration.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference last night, Lyman said he
can't predict how soon the final deci
sion on a new provost will be made.
He said there is "a bit more checking
to be done" before a candidate is
asked. He added that the process of
persuading someone to take the job
might take some time.
Lyman said he hopes the name of
the new provost, needed to replace
William Miller who resigned Jan. 1,
will be announced in a few weeks.
Another committee searching fora
new dean for the medical school, has
just begun meeting, Lyman added,

while the business school search
committee is well on its way towards
finding a new head for that graduate
school.
Commenting on the University
Planning Committee's decision to
close Mayfield Ave. by the Robert
Moore Row Houses while extending
Lomita Dr. to connect with Campus
Dr., Lyman said the plan "hasn't
been a secret of any kind."
the new road will run through the
yards and parking lots of several
fraternities and student residences.
Students there have complained the
decision to build was made without
consulting them.
Lyman said the plan has been "in
the works" for several years and has
been discussed in committee meet
ings open to the public. He added
that there are three students on the
committee that voted to recommend
the move. Lyman suggested that stu
dents who are concerned about the
project get in touch with those stu
dents on the committee.
Lyman said he thought closing
Mayfield to auto traffic is a "good
idea," in that it will decrease the
chances of a car striking a pedestrian
along the heavily traveled route.
Commenting on his recent deci

sion to suspend Medical School pro
fessor Zoltan Lucas, Lyman said it
was "impossible to say for certain"
whether Lucas' misconduct went
beyond pure carelessness, but
added that it was "carelessness on a
scale that is really dangerous."
Lucas, associate professor of
surgery, has admitted that his scien
tific paper written between 1967 and
1977 contained 18 incorrect refer
ences.

Lyman said that the time it took to
make the decision to reprimand
Lucas was "too protracted from my
view," but added that the faculty on
the committee investigating the case
were "reluctant to bear down on one
of their colleagues, unless they were
really convinced it must be done."
Lyman said he thought the re
primand and three-month suspen
sion was an appropriate and suffi
cient penalty for Lucas.
