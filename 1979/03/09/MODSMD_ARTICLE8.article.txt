Dear Bug Me:
Why are the floodlights in front of Mem Chu
always on during the day? All of the inner Quad's
outdoor lights are also on. If the University
wants to give money away, I know some starving
students.

"No, we don't have money to burn . . . it's not
intended that the lights be left on every day,"
said Robert McKnight, an engineer in central
plants and utilities. McKnight said the time
clock which regulates the lights has mal
functioned, and the lights are locked on perma
nently until the system is repaired. "We're work
ing diligently to get the system working aeain,"
McKnight said.

Dear Bug Me:
Who are the largest oil consumers in the Un

inter-city transportation, 26 percent. Crude oil

Dear Bug Me:
Who owns the "Governor Stanford" locomo
tive and where is it? I was told it was once on
campus.
-D.Q.
Mary Blessing, a library specialist at the Uni
versity Archives, said the locomotive is now on
loan to the California State Railway Museum in
Sacramento. It was transferred there from the
University Museum in 1963.
Currently the locomotive is stored in a shed at
the Sacramento Museum, awaiting the comple
tion of a museum annex. There, the "Governor
Stanford" is planned to be the main exhibit.

Dear Bug Me:
I'm sick and tired of those slobs who incon
siderately, and illegally for that matter, park their
cars in the middle of the main bike routes. Every
time I ride between the Earth Sciences building
and Storke Publications I have to get off my bike
and squeeze between cars. Why don't the police
get on their backs 112
-L.C.
According to a police dispatcher, if you call
the Department of Public Safety at 497-3444
they'll send out a unit to ticket the vehicle. Un
paid tickets are turned over to the City of Palo
Alto for collection, the dispatcher added.
