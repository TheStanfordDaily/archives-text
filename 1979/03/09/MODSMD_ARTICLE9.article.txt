The Stanford student chapter of the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) is building a
concrete canoe in preparation for the Bth An
nual West Coast Ferro-Cement Canoe Race,
April 22 at Vasona Lake, Los Catos.
David Parker, a junior in civil engineering, is
in charge of construction. "I've built canoes be
fore, and a kayak, but never a concrete canoe,"
he said. "The whole thing has to be steel and
concrete — no wood or foam blocks. There's no
restriction on length or width, except that it has
to be a canoe for four paddlers."
Concrete canoe races started about 10 years
ago among East Coast colleges. They are now
sponsored annually by the ASCE and the Ameri
can Concrete Institute and are held in conjunc
tion with student chapters' annual conventions.
When finished, the Stanford canoe will be 19
feet long, 32 inches wide and will weigh about
200 pounds.
"We, of course, are going to win," said
Parker, "but it's nice to let the other schools try
out their technical skills. Stanford was founded
on a philosophy like that."
The last time Stanford engineers competed, in
1974, they came in first place. Since then, UC-
Berkeley has dominated the races.
"Last year we won everything in sight," said
Cal's ASCE faculty adviser Jerome Raphael. "The
boys have started practicing their paddling al
ready, so watch out!"
The Cal team is known for its "super long
canoes," with this year's being 26 feet in

length.But Cal may be in trouble this year. The
ASCE chapter at San Jose State, which is hosting
this year's race, is deciding the shape of the
course, and according to the chapter's vice
president, "We've put in a few more turns, so
those schools with super long canoes will get
the idea it's supposed to be a canoe race, not a
scull race." The San Jose chapter is building an
18-footer.
Parker described the technique he and his
crew of six civil engineering students will use to
build the canoe. They will first build a wood
frame shaped like the inside of the canoe and
cover it with plastic or linoleum. After fitting
steel wire mesh over the frame for reinforce
ment, the crew will apply a 3/8-inch layer of
special lightweight cement mortar. When the
concrete is hardened, the wood frame will be
removed, and the canoe will be sanded and
painted.
"We would like to have it formed and curing
over the spring break. We want to give it as
much time to cure as possible," Parker said.
Curing entails keeping the concrete wet with
a soaker hose for several weeks. Portland ce
ment, the binding material, hardens by reacting
chemically with water. The longer it is kept wet,
the harder it gets.
Other entries in the race include University of
Santa Clara, UC-Davis, USC, and Arizona State
University. Also expected to enter are University
of the Pacific, San Francisco State, College of
San Mateo and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
"We're thinking of having services at Memo
rial Church the day before the race to have the
canoe blessed," Parker said. "Everyone will be
invited."
