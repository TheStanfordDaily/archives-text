## Mayfield should be open 
### 
On Feb. 27, representatives from the
Alpha Delts, Zetes, Kappa Alphas,
Lambda Nu, the Music Dept. and the
Department of Public Safety were in
vited to a meeting in the University Plan
ning Office. There John Lerry, manager
for construction and engineering, told
them of the University's plan to extend
Lomita Drive through to Campus Drive
and close the portion of Mayfield Ave. in
front of the Robert Moore houses.
The announcement took students
present by surprise. But ever since the
Mayfield dogleg was created five years
ago to make room for the construction
of the Law School, Dean of Students
James Lvons and Assoc. Provost Ed
Shaw have wanted to turn that portion of
the street into a pedestrian mall. "It
seemed a natural next step," according
to Lyons.
It is primarily the interest of Lyons and
Shaw that has ensured the success of the
proposal to close Mayfield so far. When
the Committee on Land and Building
Development first considered a prop
osal to extend Lomita, two years ago,
they declined to recommend it to the
Board of Trustees, deeming it unneces
sary.
Safety on Mayfield is an important fac
tor behind Lyons' and Shaw's interest in
the mall. An average of ove.* 9000 vehi
cles travel along Mayfield every day. The
large number of pedestrians and bicyc
lists that also use Mayfield creates "un
acceptable hazards," according to
Lyons, who fears the potential for acci
dents.
He acknowledges that the closure of
Mayfield and opening of Lomita merely
transfers the problem to a different
place, but stresses the fact that heavy
traffic on Lomita is a temporary condi
tion that will be alleviated when Campus
Drive West is eventually opened.
But is the traffic on Mayfield such a
serious problem?
Several other portions of Campus
Drive have higher traffic counts, accord

ing to studies conducted by the Planning
Office. According to Master Planner
Oscar Nelson, there has been only one
reported accident on Mayfield in the
past three years. And Department of
Public Safety Capt. William Wullschleger
told the Daily that "I couldn't truthfully
say it is a serious hazard."
Safety considerations, however, are
only part of a complex problem arising in
large part from the Peninsula'sacutelack
of east-west traffic routes.
Opponents of the closure plan have
proposed as an alternative the comple
tion of Campus Drive West. But the Uni
versity has held that project in abeyance
for several years, hoping that the City of
Palo Alto would complete the extension
of Willow Road. Palo Alto has also de
layed, hoping the University would
compiete Campus Drive West instead.
Either would serve as a major east
west route. The University, to avoid the
large volume of non-University traffic
that would entail, wants to ensure that
Willow Road improvements are com
pleted before work is begun on Campus
Drive West.
With no immediate resolution to this
long-standing problem and in view of
the general lack of east-west routes, the
closure of Mayfield seems to be a ques
tionable act. The extent of the safety
hazard presented by Mayfield traffic is
debatable. Both the extension of
Lomita and Campus Drive West are in
cluded in the University's Master Plan,
while the closure of Mayfield is not. Cer
tainly the extension of Lomita does not
intrinsically demand the closure of
Mayfield.
At a meeting between concerned stu
dents, Lyons and other University offi
cials Monday, the possibility was raised
that the University might be considering
other alternatives to the closure of
Mayfield. We hope this is the case and
urge the University to reconsider their
decision to close Mayfield.

the general lack of east-west routes, the
closure of Mayfield seems to be a ques
tionable act. The extent of the safety
hazard presented by Mayfield traffic is
debatable. Both the extension of
Lomita and Campus Drive West are in
cluded in the University's Master Plan,
while the closure of Mayfield is not. Cer
tainly the extension of Lomita does not
intrinsically demand the closure of
Mayfield.
At a meeting between concerned stu
dents, Lyons and other University offi
cials Monday, the possibility was raised
that the University might be considering
other alternatives to the closure of
Mayfield. We hope this is the case and
urge the University to reconsider their
decision to close Mayfield.
