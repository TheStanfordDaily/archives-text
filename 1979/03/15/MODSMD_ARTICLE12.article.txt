# Pass election reform now
## 
### 
Last week, the ASSU Senate Rules
Committee approved by a 5-3 vote a new
package of election reforms to be placed
before the student body during next
month's election.
The proposal will increase the size of
the senate to 30 members and eliminate
the 20 alternates presently elected to the
body.
Elections would also be staggered with
20 senators chosen in the fall and the
remaining 10 starting their terms in the
spring.
Instead of seating the entire senate in
a single election, separate under
graduate and graduate elections will be
held. The campus will be divided into 10
residential districts, each of which will
elect a single undergraduate senator,
while graduate senators will be elected
at large.
During the spring election in April,
with no seats specifically slated as
graduate or undergraduate, the top 10
vote getters, regardless of class, will be
seated.
Each senator, whether picked in the
fall or spring, will serve one year from
the time of his or her election.
Two of the senators elected in the fall
will have at least partial responsibility for
off-campus students.
Slates — any two or more candidates
who choose to run together — will be
limited to a total of $50 in expenditures
on publicity materials.
A new Committee on Committees will
also be formed, which will be responsi
ble for ensuring proper student rep
resentation on all University committees
by monitoring student committee mem

bers' attendance as well as the commit
tees' performance on a regular basis.
Several senators have also expressed a
strong interest in drawing up a statement
of intent to accompany the reform pac
kage, to avoid any future disputes over
its purpose and intended effects.
Today the senate will debate these
basic components of the reform pac
kage. We urge the senate to adopt the
entire proposal and provide the two
thirds majority necessary to place it on
the ballot. Approval at this point is es
sential so that the details of the new elec
tion system can be worked out in com
mittee in time for the spring election.
The proposed reforms — an attempt
to increase the effectiveness of the se
nate, increase communication between
senator and student, and decrease voter
apathy — represent a rational, workable
effort at solving problems that have
plagued student government here for
years. The well-intentioned but un
wieldy and impractical live petition
proposal has been wisely dropped.
The senate should be commended for
the time and effort they have spent on
this issue, in particular the Rules Com
mittee which has wrestled with the prob
lem for over two months.
At the same time, the details that re
main to be worked out when the prop
osal goes to committee — the actual
drawing up of the residential districts,
the final definition of what a slate com
prises, and the allocation of senatorial
responsibility for off-campus students —
are all extremely important and should
not be slighted in the rush to get the
reforms on the ballot next month.
