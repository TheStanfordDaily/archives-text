Unfortunately, the reality of last
month's Little Eleven conference often
did not coincide with the optimistic ex
pectations of either the conference's
planners or participants.
The three-day gathering was plagued
by disorganization, delays, and unpre
pared delegates who arrived with ab
breviated or nonexistent reports.
Perhaps the lowest point of the confer
ence came when 28 out of the 30 minor
ity delegates withdrew because of what
they termed the conference's "benign
neglect" of minority issues.
Yet all the members of the Stanford
delegation — not only those who actu
ally went to Philadelphia, but those who
helped prepare the delegates and their
reports — deserve to be commended for
their participation and the long hours of
work they devoted to the conference.
Stanford, it seems, had the best pre
pared delegation there, not only in
terms of the thoroughness of their prep
aration but in their grasp of the specific
issues they wished the conference to
address. As a result, the Stanford dele
gates often took the lead in the various
committee meetings, and in several in
stances were able to get what they came
for — an exchange of ideas and alterna

tives on issues of concern to students
here.
Because of the nature of the issues
addressed, immediately tangible results
will not be forthcoming in most cases,
yet the close scrutiny that the University
and its policies underwent in prepara
tion for the conference and the dele
gates' exposure to alternative policies
and programs can only benefit students
here.
Although many of the problems that
arose during the conference can be at
tributed to inexperience and logistical
problems, the obvious need for struc
tural changes and more commitment on
behalf of the individual delegations
should cause Stanford to carefully
scrutinize plans for any future confer
ences to ensure that they merit the time
and effort necessary.
Before fundraising efforts begin for
another "Little 11," organizers here
should take more than a passing look at
what students learned at this confer
ence.
But more importantly, organizations
on campus should refuse to fund the
project unless other participating
schools are going to put in as much ef
fort as Stanford delegates.
