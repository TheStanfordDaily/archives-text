# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mark Swanson Senate lacks constructive input 
### 
Like the University Food Ser
vice, the ASSU Senate per
petually seems to be a center
piece of conversational com
plaint. Whenever potential to
pics of discourse run dry at the
dinner table, and people begin
to stare down at their plates,
seemingly engrossed in their
food because they can't think
of anything to say, some enter
prising soul will invariably
break the silence and begin to
gripe about the senate. The se
nate is inefficient, he will
claim; it is misdirected, unre
presentative, etc.
While it remains popular to
be cynical about politicians
and politics generally, the
ASSU Senate at this moment
suffers from just one thing:
lack of constructive input from
students. While it is legitimate,
necessary and desirable that
complaints be filed against the
senate (for indeed the senate
should serve student con
cerns), student opinion must
not be so negative as to consis
tently undermine the legiti
macy of the institution itself.
The most common com
plaint about the senate is its
undue concern with national
issues: i.e., the Ali Bhutto con
troversy and the Coors human
rights charges. What many fail
to realize is that many national
leaders need or desire to know
the opinions of intelligent col
lege students on major issues,

and that student opinion can
have a very direct bearing on
the outcome of the national
decision-making processes.
Student opinion receives
much national publicity. Cam
pus furor over Vietnam during
the last decade influenced to a
great extent public policy and
public opinion on that issue.
While today's concerns need
not be expressed as violently
or disruptively, they neverthe
less require some outlet.
At the Little Eleven Confer
ence, Stanford was com
mended on its "model" stu
dent government. If other
schools fail to channel student
opinion from the cloisters of
campus dormitories to the
tront pages of campus and na
tional newspapers, that is all
the more reason why the Uni
versity— maintainingas it does
a very viable and tunctional
student government — holds a
great responsibility to express
it. The ASSU Senate is the only
potential campus forum for
consensual, collective opinion
on a noteworthy issue. It can
not be ignored — particularly
on national issues.
In the Bhutto issue, the se
nate possessed a possibility
(albeit remote) to affect the life
of an individual. In the Coors
issue, student opinion had the
opportunity to make a stand
against violations of human
rights (if they had deemed that
such rights had indeed been

abused). Whether or not stu
dent opinion was pro- or anti-
Bhutto or Coors was never the
question on campus during the
respective debates on these
questions: rather, the major
topic of discussion always was
the same: should the senate
even be involved in the issue at
all?
But we have shown the
necessity of having the senate
play a major role in determin
ning and expressing student
opinion on these issues. In
stead of imposing what Walter
Lippman phrased "massive
negatives" at critical times in
senate decision-making, the
student body must recognize
the senate's right and duty to
be involved in national issues,
and instead assist the senate in
making wise choices.
This can be done by offering
constructive suggestions and
criticisms, not satirical orbiting
in character. We must not de
bate whether or not the senate
has the jurisdiction to investi
gate certain issues: we must
assume that it does.
Students are as much to
blame as the senate for taking
spineless stands on certain is
sues. The senate has been
stifled from making clear-cut,
firm choices because they
were constantly assailed by
students for even getting in
volved. This is reflected in the
senate flip-flop on Bhutto, and
the evasive assessment of se

nate responsibility on the
Coors issue that "guilt (in
human rights violations) must
be a personal choice."
Senate involvement in na
tional issues does not preclude
its involvement in campus is
sues. For example, the senate
is still investigating the possi
bility of mail being delivered to
all dormitories, lighted tennis
courts, campus housing pro
jects, etc.
Student cynicism is directly
responsible for restraining the
senate from taking bold, in
novative, provocative and
straightforward stands on is
sues. Questioning of senate
jurisdiction makes the senate
vacillate.
In the formation of national
policy it is imperative that stu
dent opinion be heard and
weighed. The ASSU is the only
viable forum here for formulat
ing collective positions on im
portant issues. Consequently,
the major obstacle which the
senate must overcome is the
prejudice of its constituency.
Involvement in national is
sues is not detrimental and
does not displace ordinary se
nate concerns with student
campus affairs. It merely sup
plements it, and illuminates
the opinion of youth in com
plex national issues.
