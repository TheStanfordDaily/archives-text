## Save Alaskan wilderness lands 
### 
Within the huge stack of bills waiting to
be considered by the new Congress, there
lie proposals concerning inflation, taxes,
energy problems — and the fate of hun
dreds of millions of acres of federal lands
in Alaska.
While all of these issues are important,
the Alaska lands legislation has future im
plications which place it in a category of its
own. Alaska is the last frontier for the
American people; it represents the last
chance to preserve the same wilderness
which so affected the development of our
cultural traditions.
Wilderness has been set aside before,
but now we are not setting aside lands left
over after the settlement of European
man; now we have the opportunity to
make genuine choices, and to create wil
derness areas large enough to be truly
meaningful.
In acountrywherethevalueof progress
is often much debated, we need to step
back and leave at least this one region free
from our influence, if only as a model
against which to judge our works. Just as
Huckleberry Finn fled to the wilderness to
escape from and to examine the values of
his hypocritical and inhuman society, so
must we have the opportunity to look back
upon our asphalt- and plastic-based civili
zation from a perspective enabling us to
form unaffected opinions. We need to be
able to get some sense of ourselves in
proportion to the only reality which is truly
unquestionable.
There is little doubt that the proposed
wilderness areas do contain at least limited
amounts of some valuable mineral ores
and possibly oil; therein lies the major dif
ficulty in preservation.
One of the most controversial areas
being considered at this time is the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge, which is the calv
ing ground for the largest remaining herd
of caribou in the world. The conflict arises

out of the likelihood of oil deposits be
neath the refuge, which are actually pre
sumed to be an almost insignificant por
tion of the total supply of Alaska oil.
However, it is true that the oil is needed
in our energy-short economy. On the
other hand, the deposits would be de
pleted by the end of this century, leaving
roads and other signs of development as
reminders of the übiquitousness of man's
influence on this planet.
The tundra is one of the most fragile of
all ecosystems, and any disturbance of this
type will show its effects for hundreds and
possibly thousands of years. Nobody can
say for sure what the effects would be on
the caribou, which are already experienc
ing large reductions in population result
ing from the coming of European man.
Perhaps the overriding difficulty in pre
serving wilderness lies not in convincing
the American people that setting aside
these areas is truly important and in the
public interest, but rather in showing that
it is important enough so that you or I may
have to pay a few cents more for gasoline
or give up a second car or pay higher
prices for lumber to build our house.
After all, of what benefit are a million
acres of Alaskan wilderness to a young
couple in California unable to afford a
house? Is it justifiable to add 1000 lum
bermen to the ranks of the unemployed
just to save a few more redwoods? Former
governor Reagan once said, "Once you've
seen one redwood, you may as well have
seen them all." Perhaps one redwood is
too few, but how many are enough, and
how many too much? Do we need 120,000
caribou, or will 10,000 suffice?
Alaska is the last frontier in this country.
As such it provides the opportunity to
avoid the same mistakes we made in the
past. We can overcome our historical, go
in-extract-and-leave approach to natural
resources and show restraint and foresight
instead.
The proposed wilderness areas are the

last remaining regions where a person can
still gaze to the horizon in all directions
and fail to see any influence of man. There
are vast areas where no roads, no struc
tures, not even trails reveal the presence
of man, but they are rapidly being marked
up by bulldozers and mining crews.
Can Congress look beyond the present
demands for short-term mineral extraction
to the needs of tuture generations?
Whether we have indeed improved that
vast area which we have so greatly altered
with "progress" is certainly subject to
question.
Are we responsible enough to give our
children the chance to see what this planet
once was, or are we presumptuous
enough to assume that all of our develop
ment activities yield favorable results?
Alaska is important because it still has
areas which are large enough to be mean
ingful examples of pre-European man wil
derness, as opposed to the smaller areas
set aside in the continental United States.
Alaska is the one place where we have
more than a museum exhibit.
That wilderness may be a thousand
miles away, but the fate of those lands will
influence all of us in some way. The loss of
those lands to mining and development
would mean the loss of our last remaining
frontier, the basis upon which America
was founded and nourished.
Whether we plan to visit Alaska some
day or not, we can take comfort in the fact
that we could; we do not have to face a
world closed forever by man — yet. Alaska
is our concern, and we have the responsi
bility of informing our Congressmen
about our opinions; we will not be given a
second chance.
Thoreau wrote, "in wilderness is the
preservation of the world." Perhaps he
was correct; can we afford to take the
chance that he was wrong?
