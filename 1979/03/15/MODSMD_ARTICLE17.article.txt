## Soviet Union declining 
### 
Cross the Soviet Union off
the guest list for World War 111.
All that trouble the Chinese
went to in Vietnam, and yet the
Soviets — though the guests of
honor — never showed. How
embarrassing, for both sides.
Tough on the Chinese, who
in seeking terms of endear
ment for their former com
rades had taken to translating
old speeches by John Foster
Dulles. One moment they de
ferentially claimed that the
Soviets made them look small
time when it came to naked
imperialist aggression. The
next moment they outdid their
supposed mentors.
Tougher still on the Soviets,
who allowed the Vietnamese
to bear the brunt of Chinese
affection. Previously, it had
been thought the Russians
were jealous lovers who, hav
ing once embraced a country,
would not allow passes from
rival suitors. And yet, scarcely
had they bedded Vietnam in
COMECON and given it the
betrothal ring of a friendship
pact, when the blushing bride
was forced to endure pawing
by China.
Something must be wrong.
This can't be the tough, shrewd
Soviet Union the United States
knows, respects and builds
cruise missiles for. In fact, this
looks strangely like a pitiful,
helpless giant.
The Soviets, like Richard
Corey, cut a fine figure on the
streets downtown only to hide
defeat and despair at home.
And the United States, country
cousin newly arrived to world
politics, once again mistook
external confidence for inner
strength.
The Soviets cultivate a self
composed, coolly rational
image of controlled power.
Underneath, however, lurk
tensions that could tear the na
tion apart. The United States
too has problems, to be sure.
But in the Soviet case they re
semble less growing pains than
a hardening of vital arteries.
Take ethnic crises. The
Soviet Union encompasses an
area of the world drawing upon
the most rooted ethnic loyal
ties and enmities. Soon non-
Russians will constitute over
half the Soviet population. Vet
the Soviets dare not follow the
United States in airing dis
crimination publicly, for fear
the ensuing sparks should ig
nite a country-wide explosion
of nationalist sentiment. In
stead, the problem smolders,
further alienating a virtual
majority of Soviet citizens from
their system.
Look at energy problems.
The Soviets rely upon oil for
much more than value-in-use,

unlike Americans. Today,
Soviet control over Eastern
Europe's oil supply comprises
the major lever of influence left
them — short of military coer
cion — over these reluctant al
lies.
Yet oil production peaked
two years ago; the Soviet
Union must go deep into
Siberia to develop new fields.
And even then it has no assur
ance of developing enough in
time to avoid an irreparable de
terioration either of its
economy or of its alliance sys
tem.
Or take "illegal aliens." The
United States throws up its
hands when a few million Mex
icans cross a 1000-mile border
to work hard at low wages, in
cidentally keeping down U.S.
inflation. The Soviets must
guard a 4400-mile border
against a billion Chinese,
whose government lays claim
to much of Siberia and
moreover questions the
legitimacy of the current Soviet
regime.
Take technology. Nowhere
have the Soviets placed greater
emphasis than on the effort to
overtake the United States in
technology. Yet despite early
successes, today the only
question is the extent of the
failure.
In computers, aircraft, nuc
lear power and communica
tions — the industries of the
future — Soviet products sim
ply do not figure in world mar
kets, despite the best Soviet ef
forts. After 50 years of indus
trialization, the Soviet Union's
current export portfolio
closely resembles that of an
underdeveloped country —
mostly primary resources.
Finally, look at crises in polit
ical legitimacy. It's disturbing
when fewer Americans vote
than 10 years before. For the
Soviets, it's terrifying that 60
years after the Revolution, the
most vigorous Western Com
munist parties are those most
strongly disclaiming it, that
Warsaw Pact "allies" are in fact
increasingly rebellious col
onies, and that true Marxists
are scarcer in the Soviet Union
than in the United States.
The facts are plain. The sup
posed Soviet Lothario, out to
seduce, if not rape, every
country in the U.S. harem, suf
fers from the classic Don Juan
syndrome: impotence.
Likewise, Soviets bluster and
bully because they are in fact
weak.
For President Jimmy Carter
to point this out publicly would
be rash, perhaps enraging the
Soviet leadership, which does
everything it can to maintain
the illusion of power. It is

moreover no accident that the
Chinese, whose weaknesses
parallel the Soviets', remain
blind to "big lies" similar to
those they spread about them
selves.
The really interesting ques
tion concerns the causes of
public insecurity and ignor
ance in the United States. Why
don't these facts — rather than
propagandistic images of
Soviet omnipotence — form
the basis of public debate
about the SALT talks, about
countering Soviet influence in
the Third World, and so on?
World War 111 is one party
everyone is anxious to miss.
Let the United States beware
against unwittingly sending the
first invitations, especially
when the Soviets are neither
willing nor able to engage in
prolonged festivities.
