## Studying too much is merely selfishness 
### 
There's something wholly selfish
about studying. I'm sorry if that con
demns 99 percent of your Stanford
career, but there really is. Worse,
there's something completely obnoxi
ous, deadening, and destructive about
too much studying. And that is a prob
lem here.
As with most academic institutions,
Stanford and this ritual called "study
ing" have an active relationship. Here,
you can hibernate in the stacks of 20-
some libraries, deport yourself to un
known, uncharted classrooms, or even
(a bit amorally I admit) "live with" and
"go down" with a computer system for
several days. If you're lazy as well as
intense, you can bolt, barricade and
board up your trailer or dorm and loc
ally vegetate.
But the common factor in all these
possibilities is the singular "you." Sure,
friends, food and frivolity are occa
sional partners, but the majority of
studying (and, by definition, all
hardcore studying) is a singular "you."
Alone. Non-interacting. And useless to
"me."
And then there's that broader, too
often-unbreached world of "why" you
study. You probably submit yourself to
this masochistic ritual in pursuit of a
respectable degree. Along with most
students in the late 19705, you hope to
land a good job, make yourself lots of
money, and secure for yourself a prom
ising future. But again the singular
"you." Nowhere in this grand scheme
of events is there any emphasis on
"me." On community, or even on hap
piness.
We realize that there exists a certain

blindness about studying, and we at the
same time ambitiously struggle
through a superior academic institution
in which studying is the overriding
ritual. Demented masochism? Maybe.
But there's hope.
Studying does have a definite place in
your life. In proper doses, the academic
ritual sharpens the mind, cultivates
wisdom and reinforces self-discipline.
But understand foremost that studying
is a tool, a means by which your life can
become more meaningful. There are
other tools, of course. So many of them
are never used.
Most of you have sustained the ritual
of studying from childhood on. In
terms of frequency of all-nighters, sev
erity of headaches and intensity of fast
food attacks, however, much of your
life's studying occurs during your col
lege years.
Those college years can make claims
that no other period in your life can.
You can run faster, jump higher and
hike farther. You are in your physical
prime. You can flirt, connive and date
more (and less committally). You are in
your social and sexual prime. You have
child-like whims and adult privileges.
You are in your care-free, love-of-life
prime. Butyou'recalloustoall this. You
excuse yourself, saying, "I have certain
priorities and a limited amount of
time." Talk about mixed-up thinking.
Your four years here are lived in a cos
mopolitan congregation of varied ta
lents, diverse backgrounds and many
models of success. Your non-academic
education is boundless.
You have a certain period of time and
limited priorities — among which
studying may not be foremost. The all

condemning evil to studying is its ten
dency to infest the opportunity-rich
college years, to allow that noble goal
of enriching your later life to starve
your present one. Though you and
studying can have a healthy relation
ship, I contend that most of you are
seeing too much of each other.
The solution is not easy. Your class at
the University, along with its other
laurels, undoubtedly ranks in the top 1
percent in academic intensity in your
national age group. But the class holds
so much more: leaders, wits, athletes,
musicians and friends. The goal of
every student — and the goal of the
University — should be to foster in
teraction and intermixing. It's the
community, not the classrooms, for
which Stanford is so highly touted.
The University must receive a large
part of the blame. Our beloved institu
tion continues to blindly believe that
the post office, Meyer Library, and
bicycle accidents suffice as means of
student interaction.
Where is that essential student un
ion, the structure providing food and
social alternatives? Housing student ac
tivities and spirit? Offering student
lounge and recreation space? Tresidder
strikes out miserably in these three
areas.
The absence of a student union is a
disgrace to the University and an injus
tice to its students. And what is Man
zanita Park? Its reluctant inhabitants are
being robbed of their residential edu
cation. Meyer Library wins by default
the banner of student gathering spot. A
library as our social center? If only Bar
ron's or Lovejoy's knew. . . .
Each student is personally accounta

ble for the breadth of his education.
The key question to steady your
academic panics is this: what talents
and memories will accompany your
Stanford departure?
The answer is clear: the diversity of
your departing talents will directly re
flect the diversity of your activities. If
academics was your sole investment,
then academic competence will be
your sole return. (Studious weekend
nights can leave you impoverished.) If
academics was but a part of many in
stallments, though, your worth to soci
ety, your friends and yourself in
creases.
And what of memories? The most
vivid college recollections will probably
be the variations and aberrations
amidst the academic grind. The water
battles, the quarter overseas, the Stan
ford Band. The guest speakers, Big
Game weekend, and escapades on and
off the Farm. And the friends. The
"you's and me's" that found time to
be unselfish.
Think back to the pre-frosh marvel
ings that preceded your immersion in
this academic cauldron. Your visions of
Pac-10 athletes, student body presi
dents and multi-talented neighbors. Of
nearby San Francisco, Lake Tahoe and
golden beaches. Of peers hailing from
success and heading towards fame.
And as that pre-frosh vision fades, be
prepared to see the same scenario still
there, still attractive, still begging exp
loration. And then weep a little. For
your academic selfishness. For the time
you've already lost.

ous, deadening, and destructive about
too much studying. And that is a prob
lem here.
As with most academic institutions,
Stanford and this ritual called "study
ing" have an active relationship. Here,
you can hibernate in the stacks of 20-
some libraries, deport yourself to un
known, uncharted classrooms, or even
(a bit amorally I admit) "live with" and
"go down" with a computer system for
several days. If you're lazy as well as
intense, you can bolt, barricade and
board up your trailer or dorm and loc
ally vegetate.
But the common factor in all these
possibilities is the singular "you." Sure,
friends, food and frivolity are occa
sional partners, but the majority of
studying (and, by definition, all
hardcore studying) is a singular "you."
Alone. Non-interacting. And useless to
"me."
And then there's that broader, too
often-unbreached world of "why" you
study. You probably submit yourself to
this masochistic ritual in pursuit of a
respectable degree. Along with most
students in the late 19705, you hope to
land a good job, make yourself lots of
money, and secure for yourself a prom
ising future. But again the singular
"you." Nowhere in this grand scheme
of events is there any emphasis on
"me." On community, or even on hap
piness.
We realize that there exists a certain

blindness about studying, and we at the
same time ambitiously struggle
through a superior academic institution
in which studying is the overriding
ritual. Demented masochism? Maybe.
But there's hope.
Studying does have a definite place in
your life. In proper doses, the academic
ritual sharpens the mind, cultivates
wisdom and reinforces self-discipline.
But understand foremost that studying
is a tool, a means by which your life can
become more meaningful. There are
other tools, of course. So many of them
are never used.
Most of you have sustained the ritual
of studying from childhood on. In
terms of frequency of all-nighters, sev
erity of headaches and intensity of fast
food attacks, however, much of your
life's studying occurs during your col
lege years.
Those college years can make claims
that no other period in your life can.
You can run faster, jump higher and
hike farther. You are in your physical
prime. You can flirt, connive and date
more (and less committally). You are in
your social and sexual prime. You have
child-like whims and adult privileges.
You are in your care-free, love-of-life
prime. Butyou'recalloustoall this. You
excuse yourself, saying, "I have certain
priorities and a limited amount of
time." Talk about mixed-up thinking.
Your four years here are lived in a cos
mopolitan congregation of varied ta
lents, diverse backgrounds and many
models of success. Your non-academic
education is boundless.
You have a certain period of time and
limited priorities — among which
studying may not be foremost. The all

condemning evil to studying is its ten
dency to infest the opportunity-rich
college years, to allow that noble goal
of enriching your later life to starve
your present one. Though you and
studying can have a healthy relation
ship, I contend that most of you are
seeing too much of each other.
The solution is not easy. Your class at
the University, along with its other
laurels, undoubtedly ranks in the top 1
percent in academic intensity in your
national age group. But the class holds
so much more: leaders, wits, athletes,
musicians and friends. The goal of
every student — and the goal of the
University — should be to foster in
teraction and intermixing. It's the
community, not the classrooms, for
which Stanford is so highly touted.
The University must receive a large
part of the blame. Our beloved institu
tion continues to blindly believe that
the post office, Meyer Library, and
bicycle accidents suffice as means of
student interaction.
Where is that essential student un
ion, the structure providing food and
social alternatives? Housing student ac
tivities and spirit? Offering student
lounge and recreation space? Tresidder
strikes out miserably in these three
areas.
The absence of a student union is a
disgrace to the University and an injus
tice to its students. And what is Man
zanita Park? Its reluctant inhabitants are
being robbed of their residential edu
cation. Meyer Library wins by default
the banner of student gathering spot. A
library as our social center? If only Bar
ron's or Lovejoy's knew. . . .
Each student is personally accounta

ble for the breadth of his education.
The key question to steady your
academic panics is this: what talents
and memories will accompany your
Stanford departure?
The answer is clear: the diversity of
your departing talents will directly re
flect the diversity of your activities. If
academics was your sole investment,
then academic competence will be
your sole return. (Studious weekend
nights can leave you impoverished.) If
academics was but a part of many in
stallments, though, your worth to soci
ety, your friends and yourself in
creases.
And what of memories? The most
vivid college recollections will probably
be the variations and aberrations
amidst the academic grind. The water
battles, the quarter overseas, the Stan
ford Band. The guest speakers, Big
Game weekend, and escapades on and
off the Farm. And the friends. The
"you's and me's" that found time to
be unselfish.
Think back to the pre-frosh marvel
ings that preceded your immersion in
this academic cauldron. Your visions of
Pac-10 athletes, student body presi
dents and multi-talented neighbors. Of
nearby San Francisco, Lake Tahoe and
golden beaches. Of peers hailing from
success and heading towards fame.
And as that pre-frosh vision fades, be
prepared to see the same scenario still
there, still attractive, still begging exp
loration. And then weep a little. For
your academic selfishness. For the time
you've already lost.
(Mark Breier is a sophomore majoring in
economics.)
There's something wholly selfish
about studying. I'm sorry if that con
demns 99 percent of your Stanford
