Nature vs. Leland
I was happy to read Chris Kel
ly's article (Daily, March 6)
suggesting that more than half
a million dollars, be spent to
make Lake Lagunita a year
round lake.
There is nothing welcome
more at this campus than a bit
of choice hedonism. For too
long, this campus has been
concerned almost solely with
the academic side of life and
has sorely neglected other as
pects of our education.
For instance, there are no
indoor swimming pools and
meager racquetball facilities.
The Roble, Wilbur-Stern and
deCuerre playing fields are
clearly insufficient for the
needs of our robust student
bodies — for as Winston Chur
chill said, "World War II was
won on the playing fields of
Eton."
It is plain that if we do not
play on the beaches of Lake
Lagunita, we will have to fight
the communists on the shore
of Half Moon Bay.
In line with these noble go
als, I heartily recommend we
invest the appropriate amount
of money to convert Lake Lag
to a year-round lake.
But why stop at improving
Lake Lag? What about the poor
deprived slobs who live on the
Row or in Wilbur or Stern?
It would seem only fair to in
stall some sort of comparable
facilities there — I see nothing
out of line in jacuzzis for the
people Herb Caen referred to
as "poor little darlin's." And
saunas, for those of us really
into good health.
I'm sure the administration
— with Kelly's help — could
think up some other approp
riate trappings of our affluent
society which would help us
become better budding
capitalists and corporate
executives. But I'll leave that to
them, since they're far more
versed in such matters than I.
Kelly's problem is that he has
his priorities all mixed up —
the University is supposed to

be a center of extracurricular
and academic education, not a
country club, despite indica
tions to the contrary.
And it's really not that bad to
have a lake dry up on us for a
few months each year. If we
were to grout it as Kelly
suggests, it wouldn't be much
more than a large swimming
pool. Or a very large bathtub.
It's a real lake — natural, the
way it started out years ago.
And I'd like to see it kept that
way. After all, whose design
should be more important to
us, that of Leland Stanford or
that of nature? I suspect that it
is the latter.

Housing
inadequate
As I drove up Arastradero
Road and saw several new in
dustrial buildings under con
struction in the Stanford In
dustrial Park, I let my imagina
tion develop another scenario.
In lieu of more industrial
buildings, the University had
developed another game plan:
yes, there were to be some
new industrial buildings, but,
sprinkled in and nearby there
were to be housing develop
ments for the low- and middle
income people who worked in
the Industrial Park.
By controlling the land, the
University would place restric
tions as to density, size of
homes, townhouses and
apartments, and price range so
as to come to grips with provid
ing housing for the people who
worked nearby. The benefits to
industry were immeasurable
by now having a ready supply
of employee housing close by
and at a reasonable price, and
the advantages to the workers
who would no longer have to
commute to south of San Jose or
to the East Bay to find afforda
ble housing were also incalcul
able.
The University, by broaden
ing its concept in providing av

ailable housing to research,
industrial and office workers
on its lands, suddenly took an
enlightened communal re
sponsibility beyond the narrow
view of just providing housing
for those with certain rank
working on the campus, as
exists in its Pine Hills De
velopment.
However, I then woke up
and thought of all the rationali
zations that would be given as
to why this plan would not be
feasible: the need for the land
to create maximum dollars for
the University; crowding the
lower foothills with people (we
must preserve the one acre
minimum of the hills); the
roads could not handle the
numbers of people, etc. etc.
So, my little "pipe dream"
will probably come to naught.
Industry will have a harder and
harder time attracting people
who cannot afford to live here,
and the University will proba
bly not accept its responsibility
for providing worker housing
at a price the worker can afford
and will settle forsome more of
the same, such as the Oak
Creek Apartments, which does
not address itself to the prob
lem.
Viva Stanford! May this hon
ored institution of higher
learning some day soon accept
its role as a responsible Mid-
Peninsula neighbor in helping
to solve some of the problems
which it helped create.

Senate choice
unpardonable
As I understand it, the Guest
Professorship was designed to
bring notable people to cam
pus who could present a un
ique perspective and add di
versity to the regular cur
riculum here. In view of this, I
am frankly mystified by the ac
tions, comments and ques
tions of the ASSU Senate.
Why is there such concern
about Dennis Banks' criminal

record? Are the senators so in
fluenced by the Watergate
proceedings that they regard a
white collar activist as some
how more acceptable than a
militant ethnic activist?
If they are satisifed that
Ellsberg was "someone" be
fore the Pentagon Papers, then
why do they continue to doubt
Dennis Banks' pre-Wounded
Knee authenticity? Is it really
more valid to be "your basic
Rand researcher" than to be an
organizer and activist?
Why is the senate so willing
to pay Ellsberg $6000 for a
four-hour course and so reluc
tant to give even $2000 to Banks
for a 2Vi-hour course, a field
trip and a high degree of av
ailability and interaction with
students?
Although the course prop
osals of both men went
through regular channels, sur
vived a rigorous review process
and were deemed to meet the
academic standards of Stan
ford University, one man is
found suitable while another
continues to be suspect. Why
the double standard?
To an uninvolved observer,
the bottom line seems to be
that, even in this allegedly al
ternative route to a professor
ship, the credentials of a white
male with the proper degrees
continue to be unquestioned,
while those of an ethnic with
out the required stamp of ap
proval from an Ivy League
school will not pass muster.
To this ethnic female it is
disheartening to think that
these students are the future
leaders of America, for they
have learned their elitist les
sons all too well. I found it
especially ironic that the final
item in the article concerned
the essential whitewashing
(pun intended) of the Coors
company by members of the
ASSU whose expenses were
paid by Coors.
In conclusion, I want to
make it clear that my objection
is not to Ellsberg or to his of
fered courses; I do not ques
tion his credentials or the value

of his course. Rather, I find un
pardonable the attitudes of the
ASSU Senate members who
presume to pass judgment on
the ability of Dennis Banks to
teach a course on Native
American political affairs. The
very ignorance of the presiding
judges is eloquent testimony
to the need for such courses on
this campus.

Private defense
Ted Andrews' attempt to de
fend compulsory national ser
vice (Daily, March 7) combines
factual error with moral insen
sitivity.
Andrews states that "no
libertarian has said we ought to
turn national defense over to a
private firm. . . In fact, while
some libertarians believe that a
limited government is neces
sary to provide national de
fense, police, and a judiciary,
many libertarians are anarch
ists and believe that all the
functions performed by gov
ernment — including national
defense — can and should be
turned over to private, volun
tary firms or associations.
Andrews refers only to liber
tarians as opponents of con
scription. In fact, while liberta
rians may be in the forefront of
opposition to involuntary ser
vitude, the campus-wide coali
tion Stanford Against Con
scription includes not only
Stanford Libertarians but also
persons who are members of
the Conservative Students Un
ion, the Democratic Socialist
Organizing Committee, the
anarcho-feminist Black Rose
collective, etc.
Andrews decries opposition
to the draft as "self-serving,"
presumably because Stanford
students are among those who
may be drafted. In fact, the de
termination to defend one's
own rights and the recognition
of one's own value lie at the
root of any rational system of
morality. Only those who are

jealous of their own rights are
likely to respect and defend
the rights of others.
Andrews' own disdain for
the rights and dignity of others
is clearly revealed in his state
ment, "A little bedpan scrub
bing could do a lot of people
here a lot of good."
Notwithstanding Andrews'
unsupported assertion to the
contrary, conscription is slav
ery. It is involuntary servitude
in the most clear and obvious
meaning of those words.
It is a violation both of the
Thirteenth Amendment to the
Constitution and of the most
basic human rights.
We are not the property of
the state, society, or any other
mystical collective. Unless the
government of the United

States earns our voluntary and
freely-given support, it does
not deserve our support at all.
In the Declaration of Inde
pendence, the founders of this
nation declared that whenever
people are subjected to a gov
ernment which seriously in
vades their rights, "it is their
Duty to throw off such Gov
ernment, and to provide new
Guards for their future Sec
urity."
Unlike Andrews, some of us
arc not unmindful of that duty.
I thp rulers of this country at
mpt to institute conscription,
they will be confronted by a
serious and determined resis
tance.
