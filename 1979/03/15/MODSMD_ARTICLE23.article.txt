# Psychodrama workshop uses theater as therapy
## 
### Karen Koman 
"This is a heavy, intense
scene. If you're drunk, if you're
stoned on 'downers,' if you're
suicidal or psychotic or in any
condition where you can't take
responsibility for yourself, you
shouldn't be here."
"We don't fight fire with wa
ter; we don't fight fire with fire;
we fight fire with gasoline. We
do this in the faith that there's
something inside you that can
put it together when you really
feel it."
With this statement, Vic
Lovell, a clinical psychologist
in Menlo Park, initiated
another Friday night session of
the Prometheus Psychodrama
Workshop in downtown Palo
Alto.
Prometheus is a non-profit
organization that has been in
its present location for five
years. Before that, members of
the psychodrama community
lived together in a house in
Palo Alto. Judy Cosgrove, a
staff member of Prometheus,
commented, "Back in the '70s,
there was a growth center on
every corner. Now we're
alone."
A group of about 25 people,
ranging in age from 20 to early

50s, lounge on huge pillows ar
ranged around a small car
peted stage shaped in the form
of a cross. Lovell briefly
glances around the circle and
asks, "Who would like to work
tonight?" The show has begun.
Lovi'll, an attractive and
energt- man in his early 40s,
holds a doctorate degree in
psychology from here and is an
innovator in the field of
psychodrama therapy. His as
sociation with psychodrama
began in the early 60s during a
period of personal experimen
tation in the counter-culture
that was emerging in Palo Alto.
The Prometheus newspaper
defines psychodrama as a
phenomenon that treats "life
as theater." Certain theatrical
elements such as the use of
"actors," stage lighting, and
music are used to heighten the
intensity of the group experi
ence or encounter.
In the psychodrama, the
"patient" or "protagonist" is
directly involved in the
dramatization of his
psychological problems on
stage. This technique, refined
by Lovell, is very different from
both theater and conventional
therapy.

The workshop members
who portray the protagonist's
mother or lover or whomever
in the various scenes are non
professional actors specially
trained by Lovell in psv hod
rama techniques.

psychodrama is essentia
product of the rebellious and
disillusioned youth of the '60s.
The intensely challenging and
often violent confrontive
techniques employed were
symptomatic of an untradi
tional generation.
The dramatic, often cathartic
effects of an intense session
resulted in an emotional high
for both the protagonist, as
well as the rest of the group,
according to Lovell. "Some
people felt that psychodrama
was the nearest thing to being
high on LSD."
This particular Friday even
ing, six people, four of whom
were members of the tightly
knit Prometheus "commun
ity," expressed interest in
working out problems that had
been bothering them. The ses
sions are emotional marathons

that run for four hours. If you
try to leave before the session
is over, "you are subject to
being physically restrained,"
warned Lovell.

The first protagonist, a tall,
fragile woman, explained that
she has been tormented by
guilt feelings about her grand
father who died 11 years ago.
She said she feels that she
never really communicated
adequately the love and re
spect that she had for him.
Lovell directed one of his
psychodrama actors, a greying
man in his early 50s, to go in
and play the part of the grand
father in a graveside dialogue
with the woman.

The lightingdimmed dramat
ically and funeral music rum
bled in the background. The
actor lay on his back, his hands
folded on his chest while his
"granddaughter" knelt beside
him, speaking in a barely audi
ble voice of the guilt and sor
row that she had been ex
periencing.
Her "grandfather" com
forted her gently and after sev
eral self-recriminations, she

collapsed on his chest, her
body heaving with dry sobs.
Elton ]ohn's "Funeral for a
Friend" blared from the
loudspeakers and a single spot
light illuminated the two fi
gures lying on the stage. Lovell
softly asked the woman, "Can
you say goodbye to vour
grandfather now, Shelley.
Many therapists question
the ethics involved in allowing
a possibly very disturbed indi
vidual to be pushed and en
couraged by the therapist and

the group to release his emo
tions and tensions in such a po
tentially damaging way.
Dr. Irvin Yalom, psychiatry
professor at the Medical
Center, said the effectiveness
of the technique depends
upon whether it is used "sensi
tively or irresponsibly" by the
therapist who is directing the
action. "It can be very damag
ing to people if too much stuff
is stirred up, if it is too chal
lenging to the individual."
Valom criticized the lack of
prior screening of group
members who could be
psychologically damaged by
certain psychodrama methods.
According to Lovell, "In any
growth experience, including
college, there are going to be
some 'casualties.'
"In Prometheus," Lovell
said, "we rely on self
screening." Although he ad
mits that there are a few people
that are "borderline psychotic
or seriously neurotic," on the
whole, he claims, "this is not a
population of very sick or dis
turbed people."
According to Almond, the fi
gure of a charismatic leader is
central to the psychodrama
community. If that's the case,

Lovell fits the bill, at least in the
eyes of his hand-picked staff
members.
Mike Murray, a former in
surance underwriter who now
leads one of the men's groups,
said, "Vic is a genius in this par
ticular field. During a scene,
there are a lot of variables
going on at one time, and Vic is
in touch with all of them, and
with all the people. I really trust
him."
"I find directing psychod
rama an intrinsically rewarding
experience," Lovell said. "It al
lows me to function as an artist
as well as a therapist, and also
fulfill a political commitment to
provide a public service." He
said that he has taken to heart
the Maoist slogan of "serve the
people," and devotes about
half ot his working time to vari
ous workshops to keep Prom
etheus running.
In response to criticism that
he is playing God with the lives
of some vulnerable people,
Lovell replied, "Certainly, I am
the Cod of that little world for
four hours." He equated his
power and position to that of a
corporation head or a Univer-
sity professor.
Lovell said he sees his role as
a charismatic leader more as a
"reactor — someone who is in
a position to encourage some
thing positive that I see evolv
ing, not an actor that can shape
what is going on in the world."
Lovell claimed that since
Prometheus is merely a volun
tary organization, he has "no
real leverage." He said that he
essentially has to "give the
people what they want or they
won't give me power."
Psychodrama, according to
Lovell, is presently in a transi
tion period. "No longer do we
have the 'Big Bang theory' of
therapy in which the encoun
ters and catharsis experienced
by people would mean a per
manent transformation in
terms of their lifestyles. We still
go for the 'Big Bang,' " he said,
"but it doesn't have the same
meaning that it did in the '60s.
It's now mainly a release of
tension for the individual."
According to Lovell, if
people are affected by the
psychodrama process in a
deep and meaningful way, it is
"only after years of personal
struggle on their parts." The

violent and intense methods of
psychodrama only serve as a
device to trigger and release
these inner emotions, he said.
"Psychodrama is a learning
experience," explained Lovell,
"a method of learning about
people. People can participate
in this with no remedial ef
fect."
It is Linda's scene. A slender
figure with a mass of curly hair,
she is concerned about the vio
lent nature of the man she lives
with. "I'm afraid that one of
these days he's going to lose
control and kill me. . . her
voice trails off.
In a few moments, the stage
is teeming with actors playing
the roles of the vital people in
her life - her ex-husband, her
lover, her mother. They alter
nately challenge and comfort
her.
Twenty minutes later, a large
pillow is dragged onto the
stage and Linda is encouraged
to "really hit it, release your
emotions!" At first she is reluc
tant, but gradually she loses
herself in the lights, in the
music, in the supporting cries
from the audience. "I hate
men! I hate men!" she sobs as
she strikes the pillow.
"This is a heavy, intense
scene. If you're drunk, if you're
stoned on 'downers,' if you're
suicidal or psychotic or in any
condition where you can't take
responsibility for yourself, you
shouldn't be here."

disillusioned youth of the '60s.

according to Lovell. "Some

She said she feels that she

father in a graveside dialogue
with the woman.

Many therapists question
the ethics involved in allowing
a possibly very disturbed indi
vidual to be pushed and en
couraged by the therapist and

the group to release his emo
tions and tensions in such a po
tentially damaging way.
Dr. Irvin Yalom, psychiatry
professor at the Medical
Center, said the effectiveness
of the technique depends
upon whether it is used "sensi
tively or irresponsibly" by the
therapist who is directing the
action. "It can be very damag
ing to people if too much stuff
is stirred up, if it is too chal
lenging to the individual."
Valom criticized the lack of
prior screening of group
members who could be
psychologically damaged by
certain psychodrama methods.
According to Lovell, "In any
growth experience, including
college, there are going to be
some 'casualties.'
"In Prometheus," Lovell
said, "we rely on self
screening." Although he ad
mits that there are a few people
that are "borderline psychotic
or seriously neurotic," on the
whole, he claims, "this is not a
population of very sick or dis
turbed people."
According to Almond, the fi
gure of a charismatic leader is
central to the psychodrama
community. If that's the case,

Lovell fits the bill, at least in the
eyes of his hand-picked staff
members.
Mike Murray, a former in
surance underwriter who now
leads one of the men's groups,
said, "Vic is a genius in this par
ticular field. During a scene,
there are a lot of variables
going on at one time, and Vic is
in touch with all of them, and
with all the people. I really trust
him."
"I find directing psychod
rama an intrinsically rewarding
experience," Lovell said. "It al
lows me to function as an artist
as well as a therapist, and also
fulfill a political commitment to
provide a public service." He
said that he has taken to heart
the Maoist slogan of "serve the
people," and devotes about
half ot his working time to vari
ous workshops to keep Prom
etheus running.
In response to criticism that
he is playing God with the lives
of some vulnerable people,
Lovell replied, "Certainly, I am
the Cod of that little world for
four hours." He equated his
power and position to that of a
corporation head or a Univer-
sity professor.
Lovell said he sees his role as
a charismatic leader more as a
"reactor — someone who is in
a position to encourage some
thing positive that I see evolv
ing, not an actor that can shape
what is going on in the world."
Lovell claimed that since
Prometheus is merely a volun
tary organization, he has "no
real leverage." He said that he
essentially has to "give the
people what they want or they
won't give me power."
Psychodrama, according to
Lovell, is presently in a transi
tion period. "No longer do we
have the 'Big Bang theory' of
therapy in which the encoun
ters and catharsis experienced
by people would mean a per
manent transformation in
terms of their lifestyles. We still
go for the 'Big Bang,' " he said,
"but it doesn't have the same
meaning that it did in the '60s.
It's now mainly a release of
tension for the individual."
According to Lovell, if
people are affected by the
psychodrama process in a
deep and meaningful way, it is
"only after years of personal
struggle on their parts." The

violent and intense methods of
psychodrama only serve as a
device to trigger and release
these inner emotions, he said.
"Psychodrama is a learning
experience," explained Lovell,
"a method of learning about
people. People can participate
in this with no remedial ef
fect."
It is Linda's scene. A slender
figure with a mass of curly hair,
she is concerned about the vio
lent nature of the man she lives
with. "I'm afraid that one of
these days he's going to lose
control and kill me. . . her
voice trails off.
In a few moments, the stage
is teeming with actors playing
the roles of the vital people in
her life - her ex-husband, her
lover, her mother. They alter
nately challenge and comfort
her.
Twenty minutes later, a large
pillow is dragged onto the
stage and Linda is encouraged
to "really hit it, release your
emotions!" At first she is reluc
tant, but gradually she loses
herself in the lights, in the
music, in the supporting cries
from the audience. "I hate
men! I hate men!" she sobs as
she strikes the pillow.
"This is a heavy, intense
scene. If you're drunk, if you're
stoned on 'downers,' if you're
suicidal or psychotic or in any
condition where you can't take
responsibility for yourself, you
shouldn't be here."
"We don't fight fire with wa
ter; we don't fight fire with fire;
we fight fire with gasoline. We
do this in the faith that there's
something inside you that can
put it together when you really
feel it."
With this statement, Vic
Lovell, a clinical psychologist
in Menlo Park, initiated
another Friday night session of
the Prometheus Psychodrama
Workshop in downtown Palo
Alto.
Prometheus is a non-profit
organization that has been in
its present location for five
years. Before that, members of
the psychodrama community
lived together in a house in
Palo Alto. Judy Cosgrove, a
staff member of Prometheus,
commented, "Back in the '70s,
there was a growth center on
every corner. Now we're
alone."
A group of about 25 people,
ranging in age from 20 to early

50s, lounge on huge pillows ar
ranged around a small car
peted stage shaped in the form
of a cross. Lovell briefly
glances around the circle and
asks, "Who would like to work
tonight?" The show has begun.
Lovi'll, an attractive and
energt- man in his early 40s,
holds a doctorate degree in
psychology from here and is an
innovator in the field of
psychodrama therapy. His as
sociation with psychodrama
began in the early 60s during a
period of personal experimen
tation in the counter-culture
that was emerging in Palo Alto.
The Prometheus newspaper
defines psychodrama as a
phenomenon that treats "life
as theater." Certain theatrical
elements such as the use of
"actors," stage lighting, and
music are used to heighten the
intensity of the group experi
ence or encounter.
In the psychodrama, the
"patient" or "protagonist" is
directly involved in the
dramatization of his
psychological problems on
stage. This technique, refined
by Lovell, is very different from
both theater and conventional
therapy.

The workshop members
who portray the protagonist's
mother or lover or whomever
in the various scenes are non
professional actors specially
trained by Lovell in psv hod

upon whether it is used "sensi
tively or irresponsibly" by the
therapist who is directing the
action. "It can be very damag
ing to people if too much stuff
is stirred up, if it is too chal
lenging to the individual."
Valom criticized the lack of
prior screening of group
members who could be
psychologically damaged by
certain psychodrama methods.
According to Lovell, "In any
growth experience, including
college, there are going to be
some 'casualties.'
"In Prometheus," Lovell
said, "we rely on self
screening." Although he ad
mits that there are a few people
that are "borderline psychotic
or seriously neurotic," on the
whole, he claims, "this is not a
population of very sick or dis
turbed people."
According to Almond, the fi
gure of a charismatic leader is
central to the psychodrama
community. If that's the case,

Lovell fits the bill, at least in the
eyes of his hand-picked staff
members.
Mike Murray, a former in
surance underwriter who now
leads one of the men's groups,
said, "Vic is a genius in this par
ticular field. During a scene,
there are a lot of variables
going on at one time, and Vic is
in touch with all of them, and
with all the people. I really trust
him."
"I find directing psychod
rama an intrinsically rewarding
experience," Lovell said. "It al
lows me to function as an artist
as well as a therapist, and also
fulfill a political commitment to
provide a public service." He
said that he has taken to heart
the Maoist slogan of "serve the
people," and devotes about
half ot his working time to vari
ous workshops to keep Prom
etheus running.
In response to criticism that
he is playing God with the lives
of some vulnerable people,
Lovell replied, "Certainly, I am
the Cod of that little world for
four hours." He equated his
power and position to that of a
corporation head or a Univer-
sity professor.
Lovell said he sees his role as
a charismatic leader more as a
"reactor — someone who is in
a position to encourage some
thing positive that I see evolv
ing, not an actor that can shape
what is going on in the world."
Lovell claimed that since
Prometheus is merely a volun
tary organization, he has "no
real leverage." He said that he
essentially has to "give the
people what they want or they
won't give me power."
Psychodrama, according to
Lovell, is presently in a transi
tion period. "No longer do we
have the 'Big Bang theory' of
therapy in which the encoun
ters and catharsis experienced
by people would mean a per
manent transformation in
terms of their lifestyles. We still
go for the 'Big Bang,' " he said,
"but it doesn't have the same
meaning that it did in the '60s.
It's now mainly a release of
tension for the individual."
According to Lovell, if
people are affected by the
psychodrama process in a
deep and meaningful way, it is
"only after years of personal
struggle on their parts." The

violent and intense methods of
psychodrama only serve as a
device to trigger and release
these inner emotions, he said.
"Psychodrama is a learning
experience," explained Lovell,
"a method of learning about
people. People can participate
in this with no remedial ef
fect."
It is Linda's scene. A slender
figure with a mass of curly hair,
she is concerned about the vio
lent nature of the man she lives
with. "I'm afraid that one of
these days he's going to lose
control and kill me. . . her
voice trails off.
In a few moments, the stage
is teeming with actors playing
the roles of the vital people in
her life - her ex-husband, her
lover, her mother. They alter
nately challenge and comfort
her.
Twenty minutes later, a large
pillow is dragged onto the
stage and Linda is encouraged
to "really hit it, release your
emotions!" At first she is reluc
tant, but gradually she loses
herself in the lights, in the
music, in the supporting cries
from the audience. "I hate
men! I hate men!" she sobs as
she strikes the pillow.
"This is a heavy, intense
scene. If you're drunk, if you're
stoned on 'downers,' if you're
suicidal or psychotic or in any
condition where you can't take
responsibility for yourself, you
shouldn't be here."
"We don't fight fire with wa
ter; we don't fight fire with fire;
we fight fire with gasoline. We
do this in the faith that there's
something inside you that can
put it together when you really
feel it."
With this statement, Vic
Lovell, a clinical psychologist
in Menlo Park, initiated
another Friday night session of
the Prometheus Psychodrama
Workshop in downtown Palo
Alto.
Prometheus is a non-profit
organization that has been in
its present location for five
years. Before that, members of
the psychodrama community
lived together in a house in
Palo Alto. Judy Cosgrove, a
staff member of Prometheus,
commented, "Back in the '70s,
there was a growth center on
every corner. Now we're
alone."
A group of about 25 people,
ranging in age from 20 to early

50s, lounge on huge pillows ar
ranged around a small car
peted stage shaped in the form
of a cross. Lovell briefly
glances around the circle and
asks, "Who would like to work
tonight?" The show has begun.
Lovi'll, an attractive and
energt- man in his early 40s,
holds a doctorate degree in
psychology from here and is an
innovator in the field of
psychodrama therapy. His as
sociation with psychodrama
began in the early 60s during a
period of personal experimen
tation in the counter-culture
that was emerging in Palo Alto.
The Prometheus newspaper
defines psychodrama as a
phenomenon that treats "life
as theater." Certain theatrical
elements such as the use of
"actors," stage lighting, and
music are used to heighten the
intensity of the group experi
ence or encounter.
In the psychodrama, the
"patient" or "protagonist" is
directly involved in the
dramatization of his
psychological problems on
stage. This technique, refined
by Lovell, is very different from
both theater and conventional
therapy.

The workshop members
who portray the protagonist's
mother or lover or whomever
in the various scenes are non
professional actors specially
trained by Lovell in psv hod
rama techniques.

psychodrama is essentia

The intensely challenging and
often violent confrontive
techniques employed were
symptomatic of an untradi

The dramatic, often cathartic
effects of an intense session
resulted in an emotional high
for both the protagonist, as
well as the rest of the group,
according to Lovell. "Some
people felt that psychodrama
was the nearest thing to being
high on LSD."
This particular Friday even
ing, six people, four of whom
were members of the tightly
knit Prometheus "commun
ity," expressed interest in
working out problems that had
been bothering them. The ses
sions are emotional marathons

that run for four hours. If you
try to leave before the session
is over, "you are subject to

warned Lovell.

The first protagonist, a tall,
fragile woman, explained that
she has been tormented by
guilt feelings about her grand
father who died 11 years ago.
She said she feels that she
never really communicated
adequately the love and re
spect that she had for him.
Lovell directed one of his
psychodrama actors, a greying
man in his early 50s, to go in
and play the part of the grand
father in a graveside dialogue
with the woman.

The lightingdimmed dramat
ically and funeral music rum
bled in the background. The
actor lay on his back, his hands
folded on his chest while his
"granddaughter" knelt beside
him, speaking in a barely audi
ble voice of the guilt and sor
row that she had been ex
periencing.

the ethics involved in allowing
