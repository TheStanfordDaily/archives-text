Passover begins this year with the first Seder on April 11 and runs through April 19. We will again be
having a Hillel Seder on Wednesday evening, 6 p.m. at Congregation Kol Emeth in Palo Alto. This will
be a strictly kosher catered meal with wine and all the traditional seder dishes. The cost to students
and children under 13 (which we are subsidizing) is $7, and to others $12. Students may earn this
meal by helping with the preparation or cleanup. Carpools will be formed. Reservations are due
April 4.
Passover Liberation Seder will be held April 12th at 5:15 pm at Columbae. It will be a one hour
service followed by a feast. The cost will be $2.75. Reservations: Columbae 326-6810.
Again this year, home hospitality will be available for students who wish to join a local family for
the first or second seder.
If you are planning to have your own seder at home or in the dorms, haggadahs may be purchased
from congregation gift shops. A variety are available at Congregation Kol Emeth, and Temple Beth
Am as well as at the Merkaz in Palo Alto. Stanford students may borrow haggadahs from Hillel. Every
year people are disappointed when they discover too late that we have run out of "loaners." Please
be sure to pick them up at our office before April 10. We have the following selection: Maxwell
House edition, Silverman, Armed Forces, Meyer Levin's Israel Haggadah.
Hillel will supply some wine and matzos for dorm Seders. The deadline for ordering these is April
