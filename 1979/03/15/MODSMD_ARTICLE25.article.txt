# Rock climbing involves endurance
## 
### Joel Dickholtz 
My left hand gropes around
until it finds a small, but sharp,
protruding stone. My right foot
is on a ledge no bigger than a
chocolate bar, while my left
foot finds what I think is a small
crevice, though I can't actually
see it. My right hand is clinging
weakly to a rounded portion of
rock. Above me is the sky,
slightly cloudy, but beautiful. I
look down and see a small
stream running between trees
300 feet below me. I hold onto
the rock that I'm climbing, and
think of George Plimpton.
Rock climbing, according to
Jim Collins, a student here who
operates the Climb Eldorado
School of Climbing, "is a sport
which combines the endur
ance of distance running, the
agility of gymnastics, the
finesse of chess and the skill of
ballet. It's also one of the most
fun and most challenging ac
tivities there is."
Collins, a math-science
major and co-terminal student
in operations research, began
teaching rock climbing spring
quarter last year. Since that
time he, along with three other
instructors, has shown more
than 85 students the basics of
safe climbing.
"There are a lot of things that
people don't understand
about climbing," Collins said.
"One is that the type of climb

ing that we teach can be done
essentially with no risks, ex
cept for freak accidents such as
earthquakes. But in the two
years since I started teaching in
Colorado, we've had over 500
students and no injuries worse
than a bruised elbow."
Collins, who is now 21,
began climbing at age 13. He
has both climbed and designed
routes throughout California
and Colorado. This spring he
plans to put up a free-ascent
route on El Capitan in Yosemite
— the first free ascent of that
rock.
"What this means," he
explained, "is that I hope to go
up a route on El Capitan using
the rope only as protection,
rather than as an aid in climb
ing. It is essentially like climb
ing without a rope."
But the lessons taught by El
dorado are at a less advanced
level. Beginning lessons take
place at Goat Rock, located in
Castle Rock State Park near
Half Moon Bay. An instructor
takes a class of three or four
students for a one-day lesson.
According to Collins, the
beginning lessons are for
people who might be in
terested in learning how to
climb, but are not sure they
wish to pursue it further. "All
the student needs to supply for
the basic lesson are tennis
shoes, a comfortable pair of

jeans, and a sack lunch."
The intermediate lessons,
which also last a day, take place
at Pinnacles National Monu
ment, near Hollister. The
climbing is a little more dif
ficult, and the emphasis is on
working and cooperating as a
group, Collins said.
"One misconception that
people have about climbing, is
that it is something that only
males can do," Collins
explained. "This is completely
wrong. Women can climb just
as well as men, or better. I've
found that women generally
have a better sense of balance,
less fear, more maneuverabil
ity, and better use of their feet."
The University is the ideal
place for practicing rock climb
ing by way of buildering — the
art of climbing walls. The
sandstone bricks are ideal for
climbing, though extremely
difficult, Collins said.
"In fact," he said, "the most
difficult rock climbing chal
lenge in the world is in the
Quad. It's along the back of
Building 260, and it's
nicknamed Genocide. It in
volves moving sideways along

200 feet of building. And even
though it's outrageously dif
ficult, it's completely safe. The
route never goes more than
three feet off the ground."
Collins will also be conduct
ing three day beginning and in
termediate classes in climbing
over spring break.
I glance at the rope tied to
the strap around my waist. If I
fall, it will catch me. I've now
climbed to the point where I
can see the top, and the hands
and face of Gale, who is hold
ing onto the rope, belaying me.
Glancing down again, I see a
vast expanse of trees and rock
and water, and my mind begins
to get philosophic. Finding
more and more hand holds
now, I proceed up the rock, no
longer afraid, but rather awe
struck.
As I reach the top, I stretch
my right arm up, and find only
air. The left arm finds a smooth,
firmly implanted rock to grab.
My feet push up, and the next
thing I know I'm standing up
right, walking around from the
top, talking with Gale, and
looking down to where I was 30
minutes ago.
