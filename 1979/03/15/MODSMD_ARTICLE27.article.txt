Hitch: The Life and Times of Alfred Hitchcock
John Russell Taylor
Pantheon
363 pp. $10
Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense. He is a man
whose penchant for the macabre, dry wit and most obviously
his unmistakable profile, have made him one of the few univ
ersally recognized personalities in the world.
There have been many critical studies of Hitchcock's films,
but few have ever gotten close to the man himself — for the
very reason that Hitchcock has been very careful to maintain a
healthy distance between his private life and the press, until
now.
Informal side
In Hitch: The Life and Times of Alfred Hitchcock, John Rus
sell Taylor, former film critic for the London Times, fleshes out
the informal side of a very formal man with the help of Hitch
cock himself, his family, and a number of the actors, writers,
designers and others with whom Hitchcock has worked over
the years.
The book follows Hitchcock's life from his beginnings in
what is now London's East End and his first job in films (as a
title designer for Famous Players-Lasky) through his early
British films and later to the move to America and the rest of his
films, from Rebecca in 1940 to Family Plot in 1976.
Disappearing into his art
To follow Hitchcock's life in any other way than from film to
film would be impossible. As Taylor states at the end of the
work, "Alfred Hitchcock has devoted more than 50 years of his
life to becoming a film, the artist disappearing into his art." But
Taylor uses the making of films solely as the chronological
framework that keeps the book flowing.
Taylor follows Hitchcock behind the set: Hitchcock directs
by casting the roles in such a way that the actors can act
instinctively and require very little verbal direction. He also
prefers to have his films painstakingly planned out in
storyboard form so that the film is, in effect, shot before the
first frame has travelled through the camera.
Hitchcock's relationships with his working associates are
also covered, from the loyal crew he worked with on many of
his films — his secretary joan Harrison (later the producer of
his television series), cameraman Robert Burks, composer
Bernard Herrmann, and the many talented writers like Ernest
Lehman, Joseph Stefano and John Michael Hayes — to the
run-ins with various studio heads and disagreements with
stars, most often those recommended or cast for him by the
studio.
Beer from the can
While working on Torn Curtain (1966), Hitchcock had in
vited his star, Paul Newman, to a small dinner party. The two
got off to a very bad start, though, when the brash Newman

removed his coat at the dinner table and later refused Hitch
cock's carefully chosen vintage wine. He opted instead for
beer from the can. His behavior was quite a contrast to Hitch
cock's, who always made it a point to wear a coat and tie on the
set, let alone to a dinner party.
Perhaps Hitchcock's most paradoxical relationship is that
which he has with his wife and family. Hitchcock is known for
his seemingly heartless manipulation of his audience's fears
with suspense and surprise. But Taylor shows him to be, in
private, a conservative, traditional, and even sentimental fam
ily man. Each year he returns with his family to the same resort
in St. Moritz where he and his wife Alma spent their honey
moon in 1926.
He has maintained a close relationship with his daughter
Pat as well. He has encouraged her dramatic career, sending
her to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and later
casting her in some of his films, including Strangers on a Train
(1951) and Psycho (1960).
Hitch comes as a welcome relief to the gossipy biographies
of movie people that so often appear. Hitchcock enthusiasts
will welcome Taylor's portrait of a man to whom the scene of a
knife-slashing in a shower is worlds away from the scene of
domestic bliss in which a close family, a warm home and a fine
meal are all.

the years.
The book follows Hitchcock's life from his beginnings in
what is now London's East End and his first job in films (as a
title designer for Famous Players-Lasky) through his early
British films and later to the move to America and the rest of his
films, from Rebecca in 1940 to Family Plot in 1976.
Disappearing into his art
To follow Hitchcock's life in any other way than from film to
film would be impossible. As Taylor states at the end of the
work, "Alfred Hitchcock has devoted more than 50 years of his
life to becoming a film, the artist disappearing into his art." But
Taylor uses the making of films solely as the chronological
framework that keeps the book flowing.
Taylor follows Hitchcock behind the set: Hitchcock directs
by casting the roles in such a way that the actors can act
instinctively and require very little verbal direction. He also
prefers to have his films painstakingly planned out in
storyboard form so that the film is, in effect, shot before the
first frame has travelled through the camera.
Hitchcock's relationships with his working associates are
also covered, from the loyal crew he worked with on many of
his films — his secretary joan Harrison (later the producer of
his television series), cameraman Robert Burks, composer
Bernard Herrmann, and the many talented writers like Ernest
Lehman, Joseph Stefano and John Michael Hayes — to the
run-ins with various studio heads and disagreements with
stars, most often those recommended or cast for him by the
studio.
Beer from the can
While working on Torn Curtain (1966), Hitchcock had in
vited his star, Paul Newman, to a small dinner party. The two
got off to a very bad start, though, when the brash Newman

removed his coat at the dinner table and later refused Hitch
cock's carefully chosen vintage wine. He opted instead for
beer from the can. His behavior was quite a contrast to Hitch
cock's, who always made it a point to wear a coat and tie on the
set, let alone to a dinner party.
Perhaps Hitchcock's most paradoxical relationship is that
which he has with his wife and family. Hitchcock is known for
his seemingly heartless manipulation of his audience's fears
with suspense and surprise. But Taylor shows him to be, in
private, a conservative, traditional, and even sentimental fam
ily man. Each year he returns with his family to the same resort
in St. Moritz where he and his wife Alma spent their honey
moon in 1926.
He has maintained a close relationship with his daughter
Pat as well. He has encouraged her dramatic career, sending
her to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and later
casting her in some of his films, including Strangers on a Train
(1951) and Psycho (1960).
Hitch comes as a welcome relief to the gossipy biographies
of movie people that so often appear. Hitchcock enthusiasts
will welcome Taylor's portrait of a man to whom the scene of a
knife-slashing in a shower is worlds away from the scene of
domestic bliss in which a close family, a warm home and a fine
meal are all.
Goooooood Eeeeevening.
