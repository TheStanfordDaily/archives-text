Henry Adams said this is a
world "sensitive and timid na
tures" cannot regard without a
shudder. In his recently pub
lished memoir, Edward Behr
agrees. Bearings allows Behr, a
veteran reporter and News
week editor, to offer a simpler
and more truthful view of this
world than that offered by
Adams' abstruse science. Behr
writes . . folly, greed, and
hypocrisy seemed to me, at a
very early age, to be the fairy
godmothers presiding over
our planet, and little has occur
red ... to make me change my
mind." Political parties and
ideologies are, despite the
claims of their adherents, the
last place to fight against injus
tice. Folly, greed, etc. are
nowhere else more at home.
Absurd calling
Before joining Newsweek,
Behr worked for Time-Life,
Reuters, French and Swiss TV,
and the old Indian Army. Re
porting, he says, is a quintes-
absurd calling. Ac

cordingly, it is also a wonderful
platform (rom which to view
the human race's attempt to
make a grander fool of itself.
Behr's descriptions of such
instances (Algeria, Congo, Vie
tnam, etc.) almost always con
centrate upon what did not
make the papers or the history
books. For this alone, Bearings
is a wonderful book. But Ed
ward Behr is also very funny.
That makes the book even
more wonderful.
'Telling anecdote'
How's he do all this? That is,
why is this book — dare I say it
— a valuable contribution to
any library? The journalists
among us will probably recog
nize Behr's trick easily. It is
called the 'telling anecdote.' In
a few paragraphs Behr,
who seems to have been
everywhere and seen every
body, from Princess Margaret
to De Gaulle to Fidel Castro,
tells us everything we would
ever want to know about an in
cident, or about the profession
of journalism.
Take the Congo crisis of the
'60s, for instance. Imagine a
mass of white women and chil
dren huddled inside a stifling

airplane hanger. The rebel
troops, after marauding a set
tlement, have been chased
away by UN soldiers. Enter a
BBC-TV reporter with camera
crew. They pick their way
through the crowd. Finally, in
an impeccable BBC accent, the
reporter asks out loud, "Any
one here been raped and
speaks English?"
Behr has French and English
blood in him. He says that
made him, during the Second
World War, not at home in
either place. It put him both
insideand outside events. Dur
ing the war Behr joined the
Royal Garhwal Rifles regiment
in the Indian army which was
sent, immediately after the
war, to Indonesia to supervise

the return of that colony to the
Netherlands, which never
came off. Later, he went back
to the subcontinent with his
unit, this time to Peshwar, in
time for the partition and the
accompanying massacres.
Each of these phases in his life
confirmed the jaundiced view
Behr had of human beings,
high and low. Folly, egotism,
and cruelty made the end of
the empires much more dif
ficult than necessary.
The new harsh comments in
Bearings are reserved for the
'Third World' countries who
transform themselves into dic
tatorships, the western liberals
who don't care, and the
"freedom-loving western" na
tions who trade so willingly

with the brutal and the corrupt
while making pious sounds
about human rights.
Mostly, though, the book
avoids that sort of thing. It is
about hanging out — in bars, at
wars, with statesmen — and
about anatomizing events for
one's own understanding. De
spite itself, it is a romantic
book. The spare, almost elegial
prose, and the fatalism held
this side of terminal despair
make Bearings inescapably so.

Henry Adams said this is a
world "sensitive and timid na
tures" cannot regard without a
shudder. In his recently pub
lished memoir, Edward Behr
agrees. Bearings allows Behr, a
veteran reporter and News
week editor, to offer a simpler
and more truthful view of this
world than that offered by
Adams' abstruse science. Behr
writes . . folly, greed, and
hypocrisy seemed to me, at a
very early age, to be the fairy
godmothers presiding over
our planet, and little has occur
red ... to make me change my
mind." Political parties and
ideologies are, despite the
claims of their adherents, the
last place to fight against injus
tice. Folly, greed, etc. are
nowhere else more at home.
Absurd calling
Before joining Newsweek,
Behr worked for Time-Life,
Reuters, French and Swiss TV,
and the old Indian Army. Re
porting, he says, is a quintes-
absurd calling. Ac

cordingly, it is also a wonderful
platform (rom which to view
the human race's attempt to
make a grander fool of itself.
Behr's descriptions of such
instances (Algeria, Congo, Vie
tnam, etc.) almost always con
centrate upon what did not
make the papers or the history
books. For this alone, Bearings
is a wonderful book. But Ed
ward Behr is also very funny.
That makes the book even
more wonderful.
'Telling anecdote'
How's he do all this? That is,
why is this book — dare I say it
— a valuable contribution to
any library? The journalists
among us will probably recog
nize Behr's trick easily. It is
called the 'telling anecdote.' In
a few paragraphs Behr,
who seems to have been
everywhere and seen every
body, from Princess Margaret
to De Gaulle to Fidel Castro,
tells us everything we would
ever want to know about an in
cident, or about the profession
of journalism.
Take the Congo crisis of the
'60s, for instance. Imagine a
mass of white women and chil
dren huddled inside a stifling

airplane hanger. The rebel
troops, after marauding a set
tlement, have been chased
away by UN soldiers. Enter a
BBC-TV reporter with camera
crew. They pick their way
through the crowd. Finally, in
an impeccable BBC accent, the
reporter asks out loud, "Any
one here been raped and
speaks English?"
Behr has French and English
blood in him. He says that
made him, during the Second
World War, not at home in
either place. It put him both
insideand outside events. Dur
ing the war Behr joined the
Royal Garhwal Rifles regiment
in the Indian army which was
sent, immediately after the
war, to Indonesia to supervise

the return of that colony to the
Netherlands, which never
came off. Later, he went back
to the subcontinent with his
unit, this time to Peshwar, in
time for the partition and the
accompanying massacres.
Each of these phases in his life
confirmed the jaundiced view
Behr had of human beings,
high and low. Folly, egotism,
and cruelty made the end of
the empires much more dif
ficult than necessary.
The new harsh comments in
Bearings are reserved for the
'Third World' countries who
transform themselves into dic
tatorships, the western liberals
who don't care, and the
"freedom-loving western" na
tions who trade so willingly

with the brutal and the corrupt
while making pious sounds
about human rights.
Mostly, though, the book
avoids that sort of thing. It is
about hanging out — in bars, at
wars, with statesmen — and
about anatomizing events for
one's own understanding. De
spite itself, it is a romantic
book. The spare, almost elegial
prose, and the fatalism held
this side of terminal despair
make Bearings inescapably so.
