# Help! Where is Baby Penrose?

### 
The Adventures of Baby Pen
rose (The Richest Infant in the
World), by Dr. Daniel Dove.
Published by Tetragramma
ton Press, 110 pp., priceless
(in more ways than one).
(Editor's note: A copy of this
book was dropped by the Daily
offices for review; by a "con
tact." The book, it is rumored,
was written by a Stanford pro
fessor under a pen name. The
"contact's" phone has been
disconnected; local
bookstores have never heard of
the book. The Daily is review
ing the book with the hope that
Dr. Dove, if he will not step
forward, will at least make The
Adventures of Baby Penrose
available to the world at large.)
At last! A fable for our time
(and space)! The Adventures of
Baby Penrose is subtitled as
"being the tales of life in
Silicone City in the early Nine
teen Nineties."
It stars:
— Phineas J. (Baby) Penrose,
a 12-year-old who has inherited
the world's largest private for
tune and only has one year in
which to spend it.
— Jefferson the Wonderdog
who has an appetite that is
never satisfied (one might
wonder after reading the book,
whether political power
doesn't grow out of a dog's
mouth?).
— Leslie Purhart, the girl
up-street who likes her bike
more than Baby, and who is of
perky heart.
— Professor Penrose, win
ner of the Nobel Prize for his

invention of the Spherical De
celerator, Leland University's
greatest claim to fame, and dis
coverer of the revolutionary
equation, E*OM.
Since the book is set up as a
melodrama, the reviewer will
sidestep the plot (no fair spoil
ing the game), and toss out
some chapter titles as bait:
"lupiter on 20 Dollars a Day,"
"The Terror of Tootsie Tower,"
"Mite Meat for the Millions,"
"Nostrils of the World Unite"
and "Meeting at Coolidge Col
umn." A Daily editor, who
wishes to remain anonymous,
was forced to admit after peer
ing at the contents, "that this
book just might contain real
concepts.'
The prose is less than Joy
cean; the binding is Betty-
Crocker-Cookbook spiral
bound; the type is classic Let
traset and Remington
typewriter-that-survived WWI:
A home-grown effort in the
best tradition.
Still, Dove manages to crys

talize in one deadly swoop,
endless pages of left-liberal
radical analysis with the follow
ing passage:
"Fudgie Cookies," said Les
lie.
"My favorite!" (Baby Pen
rose)
"Here; have some milk with
them," said Leslie. Baby Pen
rose didn't realize how
famished he had been until he
started to eat up all the
cookies.
"You'd better leave some for
somebody else." (Leslie)
"I was hungry and I forgot,"
said Baby as he wiped the
crumbs off his face. . . .(italics
mine).
