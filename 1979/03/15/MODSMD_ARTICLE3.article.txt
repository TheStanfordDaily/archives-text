# Budget deficit looms; trustees approve new operating budget
## 
### Mike Charlson 
With the Board of Trustees' ap
proval Tuesday of the University's
proposed $129 million operating
budget for 1979-80, the prospect of
deficits looms large in the minds of
budget planners here.
The budget for next year includes a
$290,000 deficit, the first in three
years. And while the deficit is at
tributable entirely to income prob
lems at the Medical School and as
such will be paid for out of Medical
School reserves, the outlook for the
future is not particularly encourag
ing.
Apart from the Medical School, the
remainder of the University budget
balanced for next year. But pressures
on the budget are increasing. Fa
culty, already disgruntled over their
7.3 percent wage hike, will not likely
cease their protests so quickly next
year if President Jimmy Carter's
"voluntary" wage and price
guidelines are lifted.

Moreover, pressure to keep tui
tion increases down is mounting
while the projections of what the
consumer price index will do in com
ing months indicates an increase in
the inflation rate.
Further aggravating the situation is
a declining stock market. Between
August 31 and December 31 of last

year, stocks on which the operating
budget depends for income dropped
some 12 percent, according to Kent
Peterson, director of management
and financial planning.
All of these factors add up to a
gloomier outlook for the years to
come.
Peterson said following the latest
computer run of the model Long-
Range Forecast in February, the situ
ation "looks worse to us now than it
did before (after the LRF-run last
November)."
While quick to point out that the
LRF is "a forecast, not a plan," Peter
son said the caution signs are out.
The LRF provides a projection of
"what the world will look like" if the
University takes no corrective action,
said Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost
for budget and planning. The LRF
projections require making a
number of assumptions which are
not necessarily valid. Despite the un
certainty of the figures, however,
both Bacchetti and Peterson agree
that the numbers are useful.
And what the numbers show is a
potentially multimillion-dollar deficit
as the University moves into the
1980s.
Indeed, last December then-
Provost William Miller told the Fa
culty Senate that deficits could total
as much as $7 million by 1984. And
that projection was made before the
depressed stock market figures were

added into the latest LRF.
The issue of investment in the
stock market has become one of dis
cussion as a result, according to Pres
ident Richard Lyman.
In an interview last week, Lyman
said the Board of Trustees' Commit
tee on Investments is considering
the prospect of increased investment
in real estate interests, though he
said such a move should be made
with caution.
Next year, the operating budget
will derive an estimated $16.9 million
of revenue from endowment in
come, a jump of 12.2 percent over
this year.
Still, Lyman said, "I don't think the
trustees are prepared to throw in the
towel on endowment investment,"
despite the fact that return on in
vestment has not been as high as an
ticipated recently.
"Unless you believe . . . that the
stock market is a thi ng of the past and
is on its way to collapse, you almost
have to believe there's going to be a
turnaround of fairly massive propor
tions eventually," Lyman said. He
said such a claim has an historical
basis.
Yet the possibility of a deficit
looms, and with it comes recent
memories of the deficit years experi
enced here earlier.
Prior to the past two years, during
which the University experienced
slight surpluses, the University saw
eight years of deficit spending, draw
ing some $5.8 million from the
operating budget reserves.
Assuming the University realizes
the projected $161,000 surplus it ex
pects this year, only $643,000 of that
$5.8 million will have been replaced
going into the potential deficit years.
With this year's $161,000, the operat
ing budget reserve would total some
$2.4 million.
Quite clearly, prolonged deficits
would deplete that figure quickly.
So if budget planners are unable to
affect an easing of the pressures st
raining the budget, it may mean a
quick return to a program like the
Budget Adjustment or Budget

Equilibrium Programs (BAP, BEP)
which helped balance the University
budget only a few years ago.
Bacchetti said he does not think a
"son-of-BEP" program is imminent,
but, he said, "It's not out of the ques
tion."
"If it gets to the point that income
can't be upped and expense can't be
held down by usual procedures,
then we'll look at a BEP or a BAP,"
Bacchetti said.
"But we're not gearing up for it
now," he added.
Whether with a BEPorwithout, it is
clear that keeping the operating
budget balanced will not be an easy
task. And as inflationary pressures
mount, the problems are not going
away.
