Israeli Cabinet approves treaty
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday ap
proved two crucial compromises proposed by
President Jimmy Carter, paving the way to the
long-sought peace treaty between Israel and Egypt
possibly as early as next week.
"The last two outstanding issues were resolved
today," said Prime Minister Menachem Begin as
he emerged from the six-hour Cabinet meeting.
He refused to outline the substance of the com
promises.
The Cabinet will meet Sunday to act on the tre
aty as a whole. The pact must be approved by
Israel's parliament, the Knesset, before it can be
signed by Carter, Begin and Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat.
Political analysts said the Cabinet and Parlia
ment were certain to approve the treaty, the first
ever between Israel and an Arab country.
Israel's state radio reported that the Cabinet or
dered Defense Minister Ezer Weizman to fly to
Washington today to discuss U.S. financial aid and
political commitments to Israel.
A senior Egyptian official said that "one impor
tant new element" of the peace agreement was
American participation in the negotiations on the
Palestinians' settlement, which will follow a treaty
signing.
Original plans had called for Jordanian and
Palestinian participation in the talks, but the offi
cial indicated negotiations would proceed without
them "if necessary."
Earthquake shakes Mexico
Mexico City — A major predawn earthquake and
18 aftershocks jolted vast areas of Mexico yester
day, killing one person and destroying buildings in
the capital. The Red Cross said 32 Mexicans were
injured in the quake that was felt from near the
American border to the southern mountains.
The Seismological Institute in Mexico City regis
tered the tremor at 7.0 on the open-ended Richter
scale and put the epicenter 198 miles southwest of
the capital city, near the Pacific resort of Acapulco.
Aftershocks registering as high as 5 on the scale
continued for four hours.
The U.S. National Earthquake Center in Golden,
Colo., measured the quake at 7.9. That reading

would make the quake the world's strongest this
year.
Congress welcomes Carter
Washington — Expressing bipartisan praise for
President Jimmy Carter's successful mission to the
Middle East, members of Congress yesterday
awaited word of what they might be asked to do to
shore up the agreement.
Hours after returning from the Middle East, Car
ter invited House and Senate leaders from both
parties to the White House for a briefing on the
tentative accord.
Many went to the executive mansion expecting
Carter to lay out measures required to buttress the
peace treaty, including economic and military aid
to both nations and possibly a mutual defense
commitment with Israel.
Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said that
in achieving the long-sought peace breakthrough,
Carter "has earned himself a permanent place in
the efforts of peacemakers in human history."
Mississippi barges break loose
New Orleans — At least 83 huge barges ripped
out of their moorings on the swollen Mississippi
River and careened 25 miles downstream yesterday,
smashing into docks and ships and wrecking

property worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"The barges were bouncing down the river, hit
ting one side and then the other," said Joseph
Cannatella, superintendent of the New Orleans
harbor police.
All tugs in the area were called out to help corral
the runaway barges which broke loose "like
dominoes" at several points about 10 miles up
stream from this port city. By yesterday afternoon,
at least 40 were back in tow.

sponse to prospects of a Mideast peace treaty.

rials listed on the New York Stock Exchange slip
