In an article on library fines which appeared last
Wednesday, it was stated that "The main libraries
of the University's circulation department plan to
introduce borrowing regulations in the spring
which will allow them to charge faculty for over
due books."
In fact, according to Gloria Stockton, chief of
the central circulation department, "The Univer
sity Library does not now charge faculty for over
due books, nor does it have any plans to do so."
The new procedure to be implemented spring
quarter requires that faculty who do not return
recalled library materials be billed for replacement
costs one week after the new due date. Faculty are
currently not billed for replacement costs until the
faculty member has declared the book lost or de
stroyed.
