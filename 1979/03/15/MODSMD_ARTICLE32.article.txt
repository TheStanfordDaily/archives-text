# Banks gets nod
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees has approved the ap
pointment of native American activist Dennis
Banks as a visiting lecturer here next quarter, ac
cording to Lisa Foster of SWOPSI.
Foster said the board gave its approval Tuesday,
paving the way for Banks to teach a special course
here under the SWOPSI program next quarter.
Banks had been nominated to fill an ASSU Guest
Professorship appointment, but the ASSU Senate
has yet to finally act on his nomination. The senate
is expected to act tonight.
The senate need only act to appropriate pay for
Banks under the guest professorship program. If
the senate does not approve Banks, Foster said he
may still teach his course, but he will not be paid
for it.
