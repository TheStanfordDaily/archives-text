# Trojans take trio from Cards
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Last May, a powerful USC
baseball team, well on its way
to claiming the school's 11th
national championship, de
parted from Sunken Diamond
with a series sweep and its fifth
win out of six games with the
'78 Cardinals.
The previous year, Stanford
recorded one victory at home
against the soon-to-be 1977 na
tional champion Trojans, but
had already dropped three
games earlier in the season
when visiting its southern
California rivals.
This past weekend, a sup
posedly ailing USC ballclub —
in the midst of rebuilding a
team that lost more than half of
last year's starting lineup and
six of last year's key pitchers —
swept the Cards 12-2, 9-2, and
6-5 on Stanford's home turf.
The three losses drop Stan
ford into a last-place tie in the
Pacific-10 Southern Division.
Both Stanford and Arizona
State, who will pair up this
weekend, have 1-5 records in
league play.
Meanwhile, USC and Cal
share second place with 4-2 re

cords, trailing division leader
UCLA at 5-1. Arizona is even at
3-3.
According to USC head
coach Rod Dedeaux, the Tro
jans may be "down" this year
when compared to USC teams
of the past, but they're not
beaten.
"We've got a lot of young
guys," said Dedeaux, "but
we're going to fight hard and
be tough to beat."
Dedeaux admitted, "We
(USC) got a few breaks this
weekend."
Well, so did Stanford. . .But
nearly all of Stanford's were
bad breaks.
Friday, the two teams were
tied 2-2 heading into the sixth
inning — an inning that would
spell trouble for the Cards in all
three games of the series.
USC loaded the bases with
no outs in the top of that in
ning, but instead of getting two
outs and much closer to end
ing the inning, Stanford com
mitted an error on a double
play ball that allowed two USC
runs to score.
USC went on to score five
more runs in that disastrous

frame and put the Cardinals
hopelessly behind.
While USC picked up two
runs in the seventh, one in the
eighth and three runs in the
ninth (that were later erased
from the scorebook when the
umpires called the game on ac
count of darkness halfway
through the inning), Stanford
was held scoreless by Trojan
started Ron Couchee and re
liever Spiro Psaltis.
"We just didn't hit the ball at
all this weekend," commented
Stanford head Coach Mark
Marquess after Sunday's con
test.
Not until Sunday did the
Cards even come close to
matching the number of hits
USC collected. In that last
game Stanford had 10 hits to
USC's 13, but in the two previ
ous games USC totaled 28 hits
while Stanford managed only
12.
Stanford frequently made
good, solid contact with the
ball. It just so happened that
USC fielders were always in a
position to make a running
grab or diving catch of the
would-be Cardinal hit.
In the sixth inning Saturday,
Stanford trailed the Trojans
2-1. USC speedster Gerald
Price led off the inning by beat
ing out a nubber to the first
base side of the mound.
Bruce Fiala, who started the
game for the Cards, forced the
next two batters to ground out.
But the third out of the inning
did not come until the Trojans
had scored three times on
three hits and another costly
Stanford error.
Stanford got one run back in
the bottom of the inning on an
RBI triple by second baseman
Paul Zuvella. But USC added
three more runs in the seventh
and one final run in the eighth
to ice the victory.
Sunday the Cards suffered a
heartbreaker. They lost 6-5 to
the Trojans in what Dedeaux
called "just a good, hard
fought, close game."
Stanford looked like it was
on its way to victory when Joe
LoPresti pitched his way
through the sixth inning de
spite another Trojan scoring
threat.
With only one man down
and the score again tied 2-2,
USC rapped out two consecu
tive singles, but LoPresti
quickly improved the situation

by striking out the next two
batters.
With one swing of the bat in
the bottom half of that inning,
Zuvella put the Cards on top
3-2. The junior from Milpitas
blazed his first home run of the
season 400 feet over the red
soccer-field fence in left
center.
A questionable call in the
eighth, however, gave the Tro
jans the lead again. After USC
knotted the score at 3-3, Price
hit a double-play ball that made
the Trojans' one-out rally ap
pear finished.
Instead, first base umpire
Tony Patch ruled Zuvella's
throw was not in time to get
Price at first and the USC run
ner at third scored.
One of USC's runs in the
ninth inning came on a solo
home run by designated hitter
Frank Pennachio.
The final Trojan run — which
proved to be a crucial one —
was the product of two two
base Stanford errors.
Stanford could muster only
two runs in its last at-bat before
Trojan reliever Jeff Wick pre
served USC's victory, referring
the next two batters and
stranding two Stanford run
ners.
This weekend Stanford faces
its cellar companion Arizona
State in a three-game series in
Sunken Diamond.
A 2:30 p.m. contest Friday
will feature Fiala against Arizo
na's Ken Jones, who finished
13-2 last year. LoPresti and Paul
Crame will pitch in that order
in Saturday's twinbill begin
ning at noon.

umpires called the game on ac
count of darkness halfway
through the inning), Stanford
was held scoreless by Trojan
started Ron Couchee and re
liever Spiro Psaltis.
"We just didn't hit the ball at
all this weekend," commented
Stanford head Coach Mark
Marquess after Sunday's con
test.
Not until Sunday did the
Cards even come close to
matching the number of hits
USC collected. In that last
game Stanford had 10 hits to
USC's 13, but in the two previ
ous games USC totaled 28 hits
while Stanford managed only
12.
Stanford frequently made
good, solid contact with the
ball. It just so happened that
USC fielders were always in a
position to make a running
grab or diving catch of the
would-be Cardinal hit.
In the sixth inning Saturday,
Stanford trailed the Trojans
2-1. USC speedster Gerald
Price led off the inning by beat
ing out a nubber to the first
base side of the mound.
Bruce Fiala, who started the
game for the Cards, forced the
next two batters to ground out.
But the third out of the inning
did not come until the Trojans
had scored three times on
three hits and another costly
Stanford error.
Stanford got one run back in
the bottom of the inning on an
RBI triple by second baseman
Paul Zuvella. But USC added
three more runs in the seventh
and one final run in the eighth
to ice the victory.
Sunday the Cards suffered a
heartbreaker. They lost 6-5 to
the Trojans in what Dedeaux
called "just a good, hard
fought, close game."
Stanford looked like it was
on its way to victory when Joe
LoPresti pitched his way
through the sixth inning de
spite another Trojan scoring
threat.
With only one man down
and the score again tied 2-2,
USC rapped out two consecu
tive singles, but LoPresti
quickly improved the situation

by striking out the next two
batters.
With one swing of the bat in
the bottom half of that inning,
Zuvella put the Cards on top
3-2. The junior from Milpitas
blazed his first home run of the
season 400 feet over the red
soccer-field fence in left
center.
A questionable call in the
eighth, however, gave the Tro
jans the lead again. After USC
knotted the score at 3-3, Price
hit a double-play ball that made
the Trojans' one-out rally ap
pear finished.
Instead, first base umpire
Tony Patch ruled Zuvella's
throw was not in time to get
Price at first and the USC run
ner at third scored.
One of USC's runs in the
ninth inning came on a solo
home run by designated hitter
Frank Pennachio.
The final Trojan run — which
proved to be a crucial one —
was the product of two two
base Stanford errors.
Stanford could muster only
two runs in its last at-bat before
Trojan reliever Jeff Wick pre
served USC's victory, referring
the next two batters and
stranding two Stanford run
ners.
This weekend Stanford faces
its cellar companion Arizona
State in a three-game series in
Sunken Diamond.
A 2:30 p.m. contest Friday
will feature Fiala against Arizo
na's Ken Jones, who finished
13-2 last year. LoPresti and Paul
Crame will pitch in that order

Last May, a powerful USC
baseball team, well on its way
to claiming the school's 11th
national championship, de
parted from Sunken Diamond
with a series sweep and its fifth
win out of six games with the
'78 Cardinals.
The previous year, Stanford
recorded one victory at home
against the soon-to-be 1977 na
tional champion Trojans, but
had already dropped three
games earlier in the season
when visiting its southern
California rivals.
This past weekend, a sup
posedly ailing USC ballclub —
in the midst of rebuilding a
team that lost more than half of
last year's starting lineup and
six of last year's key pitchers —
swept the Cards 12-2, 9-2, and
6-5 on Stanford's home turf.
The three losses drop Stan
ford into a last-place tie in the
Pacific-10 Southern Division.
Both Stanford and Arizona
State, who will pair up this
weekend, have 1-5 records in
league play.

share second place with 4-2 re

ning, but instead of getting two
outs and much closer to end

USC went on to score five
more runs in that disastrous

frame and put the Cardinals
hopelessly behind.

knotted the score at 3-3, Price
hit a double-play ball that made
the Trojans' one-out rally ap
pear finished.
Instead, first base umpire
Tony Patch ruled Zuvella's
throw was not in time to get
Price at first and the USC run
ner at third scored.
One of USC's runs in the
ninth inning came on a solo
home run by designated hitter
Frank Pennachio.
The final Trojan run — which
proved to be a crucial one —
was the product of two two
base Stanford errors.
Stanford could muster only
two runs in its last at-bat before
Trojan reliever Jeff Wick pre
served USC's victory, referring
the next two batters and
stranding two Stanford run
ners.
This weekend Stanford faces
its cellar companion Arizona
State in a three-game series in
Sunken Diamond.
A 2:30 p.m. contest Friday
will feature Fiala against Arizo
na's Ken Jones, who finished
13-2 last year. LoPresti and Paul
Crame will pitch in that order
in Saturday's twinbill begin
ning at noon.
