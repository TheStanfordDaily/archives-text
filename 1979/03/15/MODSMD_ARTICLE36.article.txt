# Swimmers miss Dead Week, exams
## Cards head east to NCAAs 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Stanford swimmers are sacrificing Dead Week
and finals week to participate in national champ
ionship meets. The women's team, comprised
of 14 swimmers and two divers, is competing in
the AIAW Championships at Pittsburgh today,
tomorrow and Saturday. Thirteen men will fly to
Cleveland this Sunday to swim in the NCAA
Championships there the 22nd through the
24th.
"Although we are certainly not the favorites,"
coach Jim Gaughran said that the women do
have a chance to win their competition, and "we
will definitely be in the running."
"Right now, on paper, it looks like Florida
(second last year) should win by about 60
points," he predicted.
He further theorized that last year's victors,
ASU, should finish second another 60 points
ahead of a dogfight between the Cards, North
Carolina State and USC. The Card women
placed a clear-cut third last year.
After a rather dismal 18th-place finish last
year, which marked the first time in 13 years that
the Cards had missed the top 10, the men hope
to regain their composure next week and re
claim a top-10 position.
Gaughran said "our sprinters have been
doing well," and that bodes well for their relay
possibilities. Since a lot of team points are allot
ted to the relay events, Gaughran said, "Our big
if is if we can place in all relays."
For the men, the top 12 finishers will amass
points for their teams. The women are accorded
a little more leeway, as the top 16 places earn
points for them.
Today should "not be a bad day for us," ac
cording to Gaughran because the 200-yard med
ley relay and the 800-yard freestyle relay are
strong events for the Card women.
Besides their wide range of ability, the women
will depend heavily upon the showings of
freshman Linda Jezek and Noel Moran.

)ezek will compete on two relay teams and In
five individual events. As the women's premiere
backstroker, she should be at or near the top in
each day's backstroke race. v
Moran will swim two relays and six individual
events, and Gaughran affirmed that "Noel
should be a finalist (top eight) in the
breaststroke every day."
Veteran juniors Valerie Lee and Kim Peyton
each placed in six events at last year's nationals
and will have the opportunity to do so again this
year although both have been hampered by ill
ness.
Peyton, courageously battling a brain tumor
for which she will be operated upon following
the meet, "appears to be swimming well," ac
cording to Gaughran. She will assume a role on
each of the five relays and will sprint in her
traditional events; the 50-, 100- and 200-yard
freestyles.
Lee will once again tackle the most demand
ing races: the 1650-free in which she captured
first-place honors last year, the 500-free and the
200-fly, both seconds for her last year, and the
100-fly where she garnered a ninth last year,
plust two relays.
Freshman stalwart Libby Beaudet will com
pete every day for the Cards. Rounding out the
traveling squad are Zena Herrmann, Laura
Raymond, )o Clark, Nancy Thompson, Maria
Pease, Rose Storm, Sue Bird, Margot Hagstette,
Sheri Burlingham and divers Lisa Mariani and
Ann Carey.
Senior co-captain Mike Bruner will lead the
men into the water in the 200- and 500-freestyle
races and the 200 butterfly, all of which he could
conceivably win. Principally, the team will stake
its cause on its overall depth.

escaping the agony of exam week will be |im

breaststroke every day."
Veteran juniors Valerie Lee and Kim Peyton
each placed in six events at last year's nationals
and will have the opportunity to do so again this
year although both have been hampered by ill
ness.
Peyton, courageously battling a brain tumor
for which she will be operated upon following
the meet, "appears to be swimming well," ac
cording to Gaughran. She will assume a role on
each of the five relays and will sprint in her
traditional events; the 50-, 100- and 200-yard
freestyles.
Lee will once again tackle the most demand
ing races: the 1650-free in which she captured
first-place honors last year, the 500-free and the
200-fly, both seconds for her last year, and the
100-fly where she garnered a ninth last year,
plust two relays.
Freshman stalwart Libby Beaudet will com
pete every day for the Cards. Rounding out the
traveling squad are Zena Herrmann, Laura
Raymond, )o Clark, Nancy Thompson, Maria
Pease, Rose Storm, Sue Bird, Margot Hagstette,
Sheri Burlingham and divers Lisa Mariani and
Ann Carey.
Senior co-captain Mike Bruner will lead the
men into the water in the 200- and 500-freestyle
races and the 200 butterfly, all of which he could
conceivably win. Principally, the team will stake
its cause on its overall depth.

A CARD baserunner lunges to successfully purloin second base. Nonetheless, the Cards were ripped off
completely in their three-game series against the USC Trojans last week.
Stanford swimmers are sacrificing Dead Week
and finals week to participate in national champ
ionship meets. The women's team, comprised
of 14 swimmers and two divers, is competing in
the AIAW Championships at Pittsburgh today,
tomorrow and Saturday. Thirteen men will fly to
Cleveland this Sunday to swim in the NCAA
Championships there the 22nd through the
24th.
"Although we are certainly not the favorites,"
coach Jim Gaughran said that the women do
have a chance to win their competition, and "we
will definitely be in the running."
"Right now, on paper, it looks like Florida
(second last year) should win by about 60
points," he predicted.
He further theorized that last year's victors,
ASU, should finish second another 60 points
ahead of a dogfight between the Cards, North
Carolina State and USC. The Card women
placed a clear-cut third last year.
After a rather dismal 18th-place finish last
year, which marked the first time in 13 years that
the Cards had missed the top 10, the men hope
to regain their composure next week and re
claim a top-10 position.
Gaughran said "our sprinters have been
doing well," and that bodes well for their relay
possibilities. Since a lot of team points are allot
ted to the relay events, Gaughran said, "Our big
if is if we can place in all relays."
For the men, the top 12 finishers will amass
points for their teams. The women are accorded
a little more leeway, as the top 16 places earn
points for them.
Today should "not be a bad day for us," ac
cording to Gaughran because the 200-yard med
ley relay and the 800-yard freestyle relay are
strong events for the Card women.
Besides their wide range of ability, the women
will depend heavily upon the showings of
freshman Linda Jezek and Noel Moran.

)ezek will compete on two relay teams and In
five individual events. As the women's premiere
backstroker, she should be at or near the top in
each day's backstroke race. v
Moran will swim two relays and six individual
events, and Gaughran affirmed that "Noel
should be a finalist (top eight) in the
breaststroke every day."
