# Netters split two against Texans; fall to SMU 7-2, beat Texas 7-2

### Jeff Brandon 
The 40-match win streak put
together by Stanford's tennis
team came to a painful end last
Saturday as the Cards dropped
a 7-2 decision to top ranked
Southern Methodist University
(SMU).
"SMU's a good team,"
commented coach Dick
Could. "However, they are
beatable. We lost three
matches where we were ahead
a service break in the third set.
If we win those matches we win
the match 5-4. It's good to play
a team of their caliber early in
the season. It shows us how
hard we're going to have to
work, but that they are not in
vincible."
No. 1 singles and doubles
player Peter Rennert agreed.
"I think our big problem
going into the match was con
fidence," he said. "I think
everybody thought too much
of them and not enough of
ourselves. I think everyone
came out of the match confi
dent that if we play well we can
beat them."
Rennert made his home
debut at the No. 1 spot losing a
tough three-setter 6-3, 4-6, 7-5
to Mark Turpin of SMU.
"I was nervous at the begin
ning — I really didn't have the
confidence I needed to win,"
said Rennert. "That match

showed me that even though I
didn't play great at the start and
got behind, I now know'l can
come back."
The brightest spot for the
Cards was Scott Bondurant's
play at the No. 4 spot. Bondur
ant defeated Mark Vines 5-7,
6-4, 6-2 for the lone Stanford
singles win.
"Scott's really concentrated
well in his last matches,"
Gould said. "This was his first
big college match, and it's
sometimes hard to concen
trate. However, he sustained
concentration well and made
the most of his opportunities.
He played well when he was
down and he didn't let up
when he got ahead. I was really
impressed with his mental
toughness."
Rennert and Lloyd Bourne
teamed up for the other Card
win at first doubles, beating
Turpin and Chris Delaney 6-3,
6-3. It was the SMU duo's first
loss after 10 consecutive vic
tories.
The Cards, however,
bounced back Tuesday to de
feat ninth-ranked Texas 7-2.
Bondurant kept his singles re
cord perfect with a 7-6, 6-1 vic
tory over Guillermo Stevens.
Rennert also picked up an
impressive victory defeating
the top-ranked amateur in the
world, Kevin Curren, 1-6, 7-6,

6-3.
Rennert and Curren teamed
up to reach the finals of five
American Express events in
doubles, capturing the title in
three of them last summer.
"Peter started out slow,"
pointed out Gould. "But I think
he proved he can play with the
best. I was also pleased to see
Lloyd Bourne come through
after two straight losses.
"We played well, but I think
we're capable of playing bet
ter," Gould said.
Bourne stopped All-
American Steve Denton 7-6,
6-3. Last year Denton reached
the quarterfinals of the NCAA
tournament before he suc
cumbed to Bill Maze. He was
undefeated in 15 dual matches
before Bourne snapped his
streak.
)im Hodges also came back
to crush Bill Borrsman 6-3, 6-0
after a tremendous effort in a
losing cause against SMU's
Tommy Cain 4-6, 6-0, 7-5.
Freshman Tim Mayotte has
not yet shown his true form,
but he was good enough to
handle Kreg Yingst 7-5, 6-3.
The Cards, however, have
no time to rest as No. 4 ranked
Trinity is psyched for a match
with the defending champion
today at 1:30 p.m.
Trinity brings with them the
top player in the nation, Eric

Iskusky. Iskusky has only
dropped one match this year,
playing almost exclusively at
No. 1. He beat Rennert 6-2, 7-6
earlier this year at the Coaches
All-American Tournament.
"That's the tough thing
about playing No. 1," com
mented Rennert. "Tuesday I
played the top-ranked amateur
and today I have a tougher
match. I can't afford to be
down for any match."
The match will be played Fri
day at 1:30 p.m. if the match is
rained out today. It should be
one of the best matches of the
year and the Cards are hoping
for a good performance.

Trinity is psyched for a match
with the defending champion
today at 1:30 p.m.
Trinity brings with them the
top player in the nation, Eric

Iskusky. Iskusky has only
dropped one match this year,
playing almost exclusively at
No. 1. He beat Rennert 6-2, 7-6
earlier this year at the Coaches
All-American Tournament.
"That's the tough thing
about playing No. 1," com
mented Rennert. "Tuesday I
played the top-ranked amateur
and today I have a tougher
match. I can't afford to be
down for any match."
The match will be played Fri
day at 1:30 p.m. if the match is
rained out today. It should be
one of the best matches of the
year and the Cards are hoping
for a good performance.

The 40-match win streak put
together by Stanford's tennis
team came to a painful end last
Saturday as the Cards dropped
a 7-2 decision to top ranked
Southern Methodist University
(SMU).
"SMU's a good team,"
commented coach Dick
Could. "However, they are
beatable. We lost three
matches where we were ahead
a service break in the third set.
If we win those matches we win
the match 5-4. It's good to play
a team of their caliber early in
the season. It shows us how
hard we're going to have to
work, but that they are not in
vincible."
No. 1 singles and doubles
player Peter Rennert agreed.
"I think our big problem
going into the match was con
fidence," he said. "I think
everybody thought too much
of them and not enough of
ourselves. I think everyone
came out of the match confi
dent that if we play well we can
beat them."
Rennert made his home
debut at the No. 1 spot losing a
tough three-setter 6-3, 4-6, 7-5
to Mark Turpin of SMU.
"I was nervous at the begin
ning — I really didn't have the
confidence I needed to win,"
said Rennert. "That match

showed me that even though I
didn't play great at the start and
got behind, I now know'l can
come back."
The brightest spot for the
Cards was Scott Bondurant's
play at the No. 4 spot. Bondur
ant defeated Mark Vines 5-7,
6-4, 6-2 for the lone Stanford
singles win.
"Scott's really concentrated
well in his last matches,"
Gould said. "This was his first
big college match, and it's
sometimes hard to concen
trate. However, he sustained
concentration well and made
the most of his opportunities.
He played well when he was
down and he didn't let up
when he got ahead. I was really
impressed with his mental
toughness."
Rennert and Lloyd Bourne
teamed up for the other Card
win at first doubles, beating
Turpin and Chris Delaney 6-3,
6-3. It was the SMU duo's first
loss after 10 consecutive vic
tories.
The Cards, however,
bounced back Tuesday to de
feat ninth-ranked Texas 7-2.
Bondurant kept his singles re
cord perfect with a 7-6, 6-1 vic
tory over Guillermo Stevens.
Rennert also picked up an
impressive victory defeating
the top-ranked amateur in the
world, Kevin Curren, 1-6, 7-6,

6-3.
Rennert and Curren teamed
up to reach the finals of five
American Express events in
doubles, capturing the title in
three of them last summer.
"Peter started out slow,"
pointed out Gould. "But I think
he proved he can play with the
best. I was also pleased to see
Lloyd Bourne come through
after two straight losses.
"We played well, but I think
we're capable of playing bet
ter," Gould said.
Bourne stopped All-
American Steve Denton 7-6,
6-3. Last year Denton reached
the quarterfinals of the NCAA
tournament before he suc
cumbed to Bill Maze. He was
undefeated in 15 dual matches
before Bourne snapped his
streak.
)im Hodges also came back
to crush Bill Borrsman 6-3, 6-0
after a tremendous effort in a
losing cause against SMU's
Tommy Cain 4-6, 6-0, 7-5.
Freshman Tim Mayotte has
not yet shown his true form,
but he was good enough to
handle Kreg Yingst 7-5, 6-3.
