# Spikers nail Cal in four
## 
### Peter Finch 
In the volleyball version of a
traditional rivalry last Friday
night at Maples Pavilion,' Sta
nford defeated Berkeley's Col
den Bears 1 i-15,15-9,15-10and
15-13.
The first game, with each
team trading many side outs
and occasionally scoring a
pointqr two in between, finally
ended in a Cal victory.
Cal grabbed an early
second-game lead, but several
healthy Stanford rallies
brougtit the game back into
reach.
With Stanford leading 14-9
and a hungry Bear squad
watching what could have
been their second victory of
the night slip away, an impetu
ous rally began.
This barrage of ferocious
spikes and gutsy bumps finally
ended with a beautiful dig by
Card Rod Fletcher, who dove
to lift the ball into the air one
last time as it was then
pounded into an opening at

the Bears' feet.
Short bursts of offense but
no real momentum typified
play for both teams in the third
game. This time an early Stan
ford lead vanished quickly as
Cal came back to within 7-5.
Good all-around play from
Don Brewster off the bench
sparked the Cards to a fairly
decisive win, though.
The fourth and final game
was a close one. Al2-7 Cal lead
fell to pieces late in the game
when the Cards went on a six
point spree to take a 13-12 lead.
After four side outs with
Stanford on top 14-13, a devas
tating spike by Rich Yardley
gave Stanford the ball, a final
serve and the victory.
Overall, Stanford coach Fred
Sturm was happy with his
team's conquest, especially
the comebacks in the third and
fourth games.
"Fletcher and Kip Engen
played very well out there,"
Sturm said. "And Brewster and
Randy Smith were a real help

coming off the bench in the
third and fourth games."
The Card win was their first
since their initiation into the
California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association (CIVA).
Their record is now 1-7 in con
ference play.
According to Sturm, the Cal
team is very similar to Stan
ford's. Their records are defi
nitely similar— in fact, they are
identical.
Sturm then summed up the
team's chances for the remain
der of the year, now that they
are through with the first
round of league play.
"Based on what I have seen,
we can really compete in this
league," he said. "The only
match that we were really out
of was against UCLA."
The Cards will have another
chance to take on the ever
strong Bruins at Maples on
April 13. The next night Stan
ford will face last year's NCAA
champions, Pepperdine, also
at Maples.
