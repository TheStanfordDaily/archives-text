# No sculpture for Law School courtyard
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Things aren't flowing too smoothly
in the Arthur E. Cooley Courtyard in
front of the Law School; in fact, no
thing there is flowing at all.
Since Barbara Hepworth's bronze
sculpture "Four-Square Walk-
Through" was removed from the site
last summer, three proposals for a
permanent fountain replacement
have all been recommended for re
jection by the University's Subcom
mittee on Outdoor Art (SODA).
Charles Meyers, dean of the Law
School, said the latest SODA report
which recommended rejection of
the most recent proposal rep
resented "only one side of the
story," but that "in order to avoid a
fight, I withdrew it (the proposal) for
the time being."
"I liked (the last two proposals) as
did the people in the Law School who
were consulted," Meyers said. "I
thought the design should have been
approved."
So for now the middle of the cour
tyard remains adorned by no more
than a bare cement platform sur
rounded by a bed of weeds.
Why did SODA let the ideas fizzle?
In the case of the most recent
proposal, a large granite structure
designed by San Francisco architect
|ohn Lynd, the subcommittee mem
bers said they felt the proposal did
"not meet the challenge of the site. It
fails as contrast and paraphrase."
The courtyard, a prominent site,
dominates the facade of Crown
Quadrangle which surrounds it on
three sides, and directly faces Meyer
Library on the fourth.

Or, according to a report submit
ted by SODA to its parent commit
tee, the University Committee on
Land and Building Development
(CLBD), "in a university committed
to excellence, the outdoor art should
be excellent."
SODA's five members, four of
whom are art professors, were cho
sen for their professional compe
tence in art, and serve in an advisory
capacity to CLBD, according to Law
School Prof. John Merryman, chair
man of SODA.
Any proposal made by Meyers for
the Law School courtyard is sent to
CLBD, which then refers it to SODA.
SODA provides advice on the selec
tion of commissioned artists prior to
their employment by deans or other
officers of the University, according
to Merryman.
CLBD decides whether to submit
the proposal to the president and the
Board of Trustees, who make the
final decision on such a proposal, ac
cording to Merryman.
Merryman also said that while no
new proposals for the Cooley Cour
tyard were being considered by his
committee, he knew of "a number of
other things which might develop."
He said it would be "premature at
this time" to comment on them.
The long search for the "right"
fountain began last fall, when
Meyers asked the architectural firm
of Sprankle, Lynd and Sprague for a
design proposal. The Hepworth
bronze sculpture previously in the
courtyard had been on a three-year
loan from Norton Simon, and was
returned last summer to the Norton

Simon Museum in Pasadena.
Architect Lynd's original proposal
was recommended for rejection by
SODA. Lynd then prepared an alter
native proposal. SODA felt the de
sign was too small in scale and lack
ing in detail, so SODA then asked
Lynd to prepare a larger model with
fuller details.
This model was the one most re
cently recommended for rejection
by SODA.
SODA's members felt that the
Cooley Courtyard, because it is sur

rounded on three sides by the un
usually massive architecture of the
Law School, is a particularly promi
nent site which calls for a sculpture
"strong" enough to stand up to the
visual challenge it presents.
The SODA report said that the gra
nite block proposal "lacks a coherent
sculptural conception. The design
falls between formal abstraction and
stimulation of the natural. It is lumpy
and jumbled. . . . The details of the
granite blocks seem disconnected,
arbitrary, a sort of visual debris."
