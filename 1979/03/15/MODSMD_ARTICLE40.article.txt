# Budinger recovering, spirits up

Final examinations may be
rigorous, but they cannot be as
difficult as what Steve
Budinger is currently endur
ing.
Budinger, a standout varsity
football linebacker, suffered a
fractured right hip in a head-on
collision on Sand Hill Road the
night of Feb. 20. He is definitely
lost for the 1979-season, and
possibly may never play foot
ball again.
Ironically, the accident oc
curred the night before Stan
ford signed a remarkably
talented group of high school
seniors to football letters of in
tent.
Budinger has been in trac
tion since the accident. He is
due to leave Stanford Hospital
in two weeks, and will remain
on crutches for three to six

months thereafter.
Therefore, Budinger could
be expected to feel extremely
depressed. Yet the fact is that
he has displayed considerable
emotional resilience.
"Naturally I felt pretty de
pressed, but you get used to it
(being in the hospital),"
Budinger said. "After two days
I realized that I'm gonna be in
the hospital for a long time."
Budinger explained that his
spirits have been steadily im
proving. "I'm feeling a lot bet
ter," he said. "It was tough at
first adjusting — I had a lot of
visitors, and being in a good
mood was tough."
After receiving a phalanx of
well-wishers during his first
two weeks in the hospital,
Budinger said that the number
of visitors has dropped off the
past week. "That isn't too

bad," he stated. "It gives me a
chance to rest."
Budinger has set no timeta
ble tor his rehabilitation pro
cess, though he did say that he
will swim and do light exercises
upon discarding his crutches.
Nor is Budinger sure about
his football future. "The doctor
hasn't given me any definite
word," he reported. "It will
depend on how well the bones
in my hip heal."
If he does return to the gridi
ron, Budinger will get a warm
welcome from the Cardinal
staff and players.
"He was one of our promi
nent inside linebackers," said
safety Robby Chapman. "Al
though we do have an abun
dance of linebackers, he is de
finitely one of the best."
Obviously the Cards will

miss Budinger, who led the de
fense in 1978 with five intercep
tions and was second in tackles
with 142.
In addition, Chapman
pointed out that Budinger lent
more to the Cards than just
statistics.
"I think that from a morale
standpoint it (Budinger's ab
sence) will hurt somewhat,"
Chapman said. "He was kind of
a leader on the field, and was
very aggressive."
Despite the doubts about his
football career, Budinger has
made immediate academic
plans. He took incompletes
this quarter, and stated that he
should finish nine of his 15
winter quarter units very soon
and will be back in school
spring quarter.
