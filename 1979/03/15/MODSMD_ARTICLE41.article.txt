# Booters play poorly but beat Santa Cruz

### Dean Eyre 
"The secret of a good team, the difference between champions
and contenders is being able to play poorly and still win," said
Stanford women's soccer coach Phil Wright.
Win was what his team did, beating Santa Cruz 2-1, but it wasn't
a game to play back on your video cassette recorder.
"Playing down to their level," according to Wright, the Cardi
nals suddenly found themselves trailing 1-0 on the first drive by
the Santa Cruz forwards.
"They scored less than two minutes into the game and it was a
complete shock," Wright said. "Kris Fox hit a shot from about 23
yards out — absolutely unstoppable. It turned out to be the only
shot they had all game."
Playing "flat" after last week's key win over California and the
onset of warm weather and finals, Stanford was in the midst of a
game lacking in competitive tone, Wright explained.
"It was a very irritating game from both a coach's point of view
and a player's point of view," Wright said. "They (Santa Cruz)
didn't try to win the game. They got ahead 1 -0 and started playing
a completely defensive game."
The teams were deadlocked in a defensive struggle — Stanford
clearly dominated play but Santa Cruz drew players back to pro
tect their goal and their one-point lead.
For 35 minutes it appeared that neither team would break
through to score. Then Maria Duryea and Cindy Shorney teamed
up to even the match at 1-1 —Shorney feeding a pass to Duryea,
who turned and unleashed a rocket kick that deflected off of a

fullback's foot, over the goalie's head and into the net.
Thanks in part to the poor field conditions, the movement of
the ball wasn't smooth. Ranging from eight inches of grass to
dried mud, the "cow pasture" as Wright put it, made passing and
dribbling a feat.
Finally, with 17 minutes remaining in the game, Shorney as
sisted Ellen Griep in putting a shot into the Santa Cruz net after
ricocheting off the goalpost. That ended the endurance test.
The Cards get a more lively opponent in the University of
Northern Colorado a week from today. According to Wright,
UNC wants to lay claim to being the best women's soccer team in
the country.
What happens to stand in their way is a loss to the Cards almost
a year ago, the only numeral in their loss column during that
season. Despite falling during finals week and the day of their
flight to Honolulu, the game is on.
Although UNC is playing four games on their California tour,
"they are coming out here specifically to play us," Wright said.
"We'll make no excuses and do the best we can. I think we'll give
them a darn good game."
Normally avoiding direct challenges, the Cards accepted the
confrontation as a matter of pride, Wright said.
While UNC is "intense" about soccer, akin to cramming for
finals, Wright added that his club maintains a more relaxed at
titude toward the sport.
To him and the team, the challenge is "more like a heavy
midterm — it's not that crucial to us," he added.
