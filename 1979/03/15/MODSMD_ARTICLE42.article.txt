# Cards blow by Occidental
## 
### Hobey Landreth 
Stanford's track and field
team outscored Occidental
69-22 on the track and matched
the visitors 31-31 in the field to
win last Saturday's meet 100-53
in Stanford Stadium.
It was an afternoon of
achievement for the Cardinals
as 12 athletes bested previous
personal records.
In the most exciting race,
Stanford's Tom Lobsinger held
off Occidental's Greg Parta
mian to win the 1500-meter run
in 3:47.8, good for a new meet
record.
"We're really starting to
move now," summarized Card
coach Payton Jordan.
Stanford runners Cordon
Banks, Darrin Nelson, Rod
Berry and Rick Gervais also did
their share of moving on the
track.

Banks ran well on both the
400-meter and mile relay teams
and won the 400-meters in
48.2.
Nelson took the long jump
for the second week in a row
with a 23-Boff his second at
tempt, won the 100-meters
with a 10.5 and was also part of
the winning 400-meter and
mile-relay teams.
Gervais ran a leg in the 400-
relay, took second in the 100
and first in the 200.
With the meet already de
cided, Berry won the admira
tion of the crowd when he tal
lied a 14:33.2 in the 5000-
meters. Second was Stanford's
Craig Corey with a 14:45.0.
"Berry could be one of the
best we've had," Jordan said of
the freshman distance runner.
Card John Schaer lowered
his best effort to 1:51.1 to win

the 800-meters. Teammate
Mark Stillman was on his heels
at 1:51.2, another personal
best.
"Stillman and Schaer are two
of a kind — a great pair in the
half-mile," remarked Jordan.
Stanford's balanced attack
continued in the field events.
After Nelson took the long
jump, Brian Holloway pro
vided a win in the shot put with
Card Marty Fuentes picking up
third. Oxy's Mark Madison
placed second.
Kevin Cuervo of Occidental
threw the javelin 214-1 to take
that event with Gary Bruner of
Stanford second at 208-6.
Oxy went on to sweep the
high jump and take first and
second in the pole vault, indi
cating two Stanford sore spots.
"Kent Doyle should be heal
thy soon and that should

change the high jump situation
for the better," Jordan said.
"He's a 6-8 jumper when in
form."
Dave Thomson won the dis
cus for the Cards with Hollo
way placing second.
The final blow to Occidental
was the triple jump which the
home team swept 9-0. Clay
Bullwinkle hopped, skipped
and jumped to a personal best
of 47-7, with Kurt Roessler and
Fred Grolle not far behind.
"I'm very pleased with that
crew," Jordan said of the triple
jumpers. "They just get better
and better every week."
In the mile relay, Stanford's
coaches decided to field two
teams and the results were a
pleasant surprise. The B team
kept pace with the A team and
ahead of Occidental until the
very end.
"We've got plenty of good
400-runners," Jordan said af
terwards.
The Cards travel to Hayward
State Saturday where first
events are scheduled to begin
at 11 a.m.
