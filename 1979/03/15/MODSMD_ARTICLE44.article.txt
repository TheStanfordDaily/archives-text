Berkeley—"We lost the war,
but we won the battle," said
Stanford assistant women's
gymnastics coach Seth Ander
son. Although gymnastics isn't
rivaling hockey in violence,
that description sums up the
action for Stanford in last
Saturday's Nor-Cal Champion
ships.
San Jose State won the
"war," rolling up 130.55 points
to successfully defend its title
and advance to the WAIAW
Regionals. The Spartans host
the competition beginning
tomorrow at 4 p.m. with the
team and all-around events
and continuing Saturday at 7
p.m. with the individual finals.
The "battle" which the Car
dinals won was actually a series
of victories on several fronts —
the team placed second in the
conference with a 127.25 mark,
a new school record, Karen
Hall and Annie Smith qualified
for individual regional compet
ition and the Cards avenged
their upset loss to California,
outpacing the Golden Bears'
119.15 total.
Finishing the season with a
7-6 record, the Cards showed
that despite the chilly drafts of
Harmon Gym's open windows,
their routines and spirit were
hot.
"It turned out to be a great
meet," head coach Jackie
Walker said. "Annie and Karen
both had their highest all
around scores of the year, and
the team had its highest score
of the year, so I was pleased
with the whole meet."
Hall swept the all-around
competition, tallying 34.95
points, a personal best and
school record. She placed
third on beam (8.40), third on
bars (8.60), second in vaulting
(8.95) and second in floor exer
cise (9.00). Her all-around total
ranked her first in the region's
at-large places and seventh
overall.
Smith took second in all
around, also setting a personal
best with 34.65, finishing third
in floor (8.65) and winning both
beam (8.50) and vaulting (9.15)
events, the latter establishing a
school record. She earned the
second of twelve at-large spots
and finished 13th overall.
Smith and Hall compete in Fri
day's evening round of com
petition starting at 7 p.m.
Between the pair of
freshmen, a total of seven per
sonal and school marks were
set or equalled. The duo ac
counted for nine of the top 15
places, up from last year's sec
ond place, 8.55 showing in vau
lting by Dana Padden.

As a team, the Cards also set
a season-high mark of 31.90 in
floor exercise and broke the
school record for the team
score in vaulting with 33.30.
Stanford's team members
"showed a lot of poise and a lot
of pride in their school, which
sounds corny nowadays, but I
think they do have it," Walker
remarked. "It was really satisfy
ing to see two Cardinal
colored sweatsuits up on the
stands for almost every awards
ceremony."
Stanford's 127.55 team total
was three points shy of qualify
ing for team regional competi
tion, but the 10th-place reg
ional finish and a 23-point im
provement over last year's con
ference total are good indi
cators of a bright future.

"We did really well, espe
cially for our second year,"
said Cindy Sedlund. "I think
that next year we have an excel
lent chance of making the top
five in the region."
Looking ahead to tonight's
competition, Hall explained
that "the team worked its way
up to the conference meet. I
think Annie and I should peak
at regionals and then make it to
nationals."
"I did a lot cleaner job on
beam and floor than I have all
year, Smith said. "I just hope
that in the next meet I can do
the same beam routine minus
the falls. I'd like to see how I
can do there (at regionals) be
cause it will be by far the high
est competition we've had all
year."

competition, tallying 34.95
points, a personal best and
school record. She placed
third on beam (8.40), third on
bars (8.60), second in vaulting
(8.95) and second in floor exer
cise (9.00). Her all-around total
ranked her first in the region's
at-large places and seventh
overall.
Smith took second in all
around, also setting a personal
best with 34.65, finishing third
in floor (8.65) and winning both
beam (8.50) and vaulting (9.15)
events, the latter establishing a
school record. She earned the
second of twelve at-large spots
and finished 13th overall.
Smith and Hall compete in Fri
day's evening round of com
petition starting at 7 p.m.
Between the pair of
freshmen, a total of seven per
sonal and school marks were
set or equalled. The duo ac
counted for nine of the top 15
places, up from last year's sec
ond place, 8.55 showing in vau
lting by Dana Padden.

As a team, the Cards also set
a season-high mark of 31.90 in
floor exercise and broke the
school record for the team
score in vaulting with 33.30.
Stanford's team members
"showed a lot of poise and a lot
of pride in their school, which
sounds corny nowadays, but I
think they do have it," Walker
remarked. "It was really satisfy
ing to see two Cardinal
colored sweatsuits up on the
stands for almost every awards
ceremony."
Stanford's 127.55 team total
was three points shy of qualify
ing for team regional competi
tion, but the 10th-place reg
ional finish and a 23-point im
provement over last year's con
ference total are good indi
cators of a bright future.

"We did really well, espe
cially for our second year,"
said Cindy Sedlund. "I think
that next year we have an excel
lent chance of making the top
five in the region."
Looking ahead to tonight's
competition, Hall explained
that "the team worked its way
up to the conference meet. I
think Annie and I should peak
at regionals and then make it to
nationals."
"I did a lot cleaner job on
beam and floor than I have all
year, Smith said. "I just hope
that in the next meet I can do
the same beam routine minus
the falls. I'd like to see how I
can do there (at regionals) be
cause it will be by far the high
est competition we've had all
year."
Berkeley—"We lost the war,
but we won the battle," said
Stanford assistant women's
gymnastics coach Seth Ander
son. Although gymnastics isn't
rivaling hockey in violence,
that description sums up the
action for Stanford in last
Saturday's Nor-Cal Champion
ships.
San Jose State won the
"war," rolling up 130.55 points
to successfully defend its title
and advance to the WAIAW
Regionals. The Spartans host
the competition beginning
tomorrow at 4 p.m. with the
team and all-around events
and continuing Saturday at 7
p.m. with the individual finals.
The "battle" which the Car
dinals won was actually a series
of victories on several fronts —
the team placed second in the
conference with a 127.25 mark,
a new school record, Karen
Hall and Annie Smith qualified
for individual regional compet
ition and the Cards avenged
their upset loss to California,
outpacing the Golden Bears'
119.15 total.
Finishing the season with a
7-6 record, the Cards showed
that despite the chilly drafts of
Harmon Gym's open windows,
their routines and spirit were
hot.
"It turned out to be a great
meet," head coach Jackie
Walker said. "Annie and Karen
both had their highest all
around scores of the year, and
the team had its highest score
of the year, so I was pleased
with the whole meet."
Hall swept the all-around
competition, tallying 34.95
points, a personal best and
school record. She placed
third on beam (8.40), third on
bars (8.60), second in vaulting
(8.95) and second in floor exer
cise (9.00). Her all-around total
ranked her first in the region's
at-large places and seventh
overall.
