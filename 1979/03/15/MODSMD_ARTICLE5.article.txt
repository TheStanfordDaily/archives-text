# Planning office employees laid off due to budget cuts
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Master Planner Oscar Nelson and
11 other employees in the Facilities
Planning Office received official
notification yesterday that they will
be laid off effective Aug. 31, accord
ing to William Massy, vice president
for business and finance. The
employees were notified verbally of
their dismissal last week.
The decision to lay off employees
is a result of two forces: an attempt to
"zero-base" the 1979-80 budget and
an effort to improve the overall effi
ciency of the planning department,
Massy said. Because much of the
"building crunch" will soon be over,
"some of the functions that have
been performed recently will no
longer be necessary," he said.
A zero-based budget is one in
which all expenditures are justified
and necessary, Massy said.
"You try to eliminate anything
that's an extra and you try to utilize
your personnel better. You also try to
find cheaper, but better ways of pro
viding better service," Peter Hopf,
associate director of facilities, said.
"Eliminating a master planner
makes it sound like planning is dead
and complete. Stanford has a lot of
things yet to be done, like complet
ing road and parking systems. The
slack time is when you put your staff
together making plans for the future
— you don't lay them off," Nelson
said.

Despite the layoffs, the University
will hire additional employees in
each of the three sections of the
Facilities Planning Office: Facilities
and Properties; Planning; and
Facilities Engineers. Employees in
each of these areas were among
those laid off yesterday.
Even after the new hiring the
number of employees in the
Facilities/Planning Office will be less
than it is presently, Hopf said. For
example, all six building project in
spectors will be laid off, but from
three to four additional positions will
be created in the facilities/properties
division.
"These new positions will be diffe
rent from the present positions.
There will be some overlap in pre
sent functions, but for the most part
these new people will have different
duties," Hopf said.
Also, in the planning division one
person will be hi red to perform "new
functions" after the layoff of three
individuals there. The laid-off
employees may apply for the newly
created jobs, Hopf said.
Some laid-off employees, while
sympathetic to the monetary con
cerns of the University, feel that the
decision to lay off 12 staffers was
"more than what was needed."
"If the lay-off was really due to
tight budgeting, I suspect that a lot of
people would have been willing to

put in a four-day week, rather than
be laid off. That's one alternative sol
ution to this problem," Nelson said.
Susan Kirk, laid-off administrative
assistant in the facilities/properties
division, added, "Of course I'm af
fected by the decision. I was hoping
that in the slack periods we'd do
some hard analytical work, but that
now won't be possible. But on the
whole, this was probably an utterly
necessary event."
"Much of what we were doing was
just rubbing the edges, doing things
that are expensive and not as neces
sary, though they're creative," Kirk
said.
Discussions on the implications of
budget-cutting proposals and alter
native plans to improve efficiency in
the facilities/planning office began at
the end of last summer.
"Even so, we've always known that
we would get to the end of the heavy
construction cycle, so it should have
come as no great shock that we were
going to have to make accommoda
tions by laying off employees," Hopf
said.
Nevertheless, Nelson was
"shocked" by the announcement
last week. "I had no intention of leav
ing before the mandatory retirement
age of 70, which I'd reach in five
years. I liked what I was doing and
thought what I was doing was ap
preciated. Now I'm beginning to
wonder," he said.

thought what I was doing was ap
preciated. Now I'm beginning to
wonder," he said.
Master Planner Oscar Nelson and
11 other employees in the Facilities
Planning Office received official
notification yesterday that they will
be laid off effective Aug. 31, accord
ing to William Massy, vice president
for business and finance. The
employees were notified verbally of
their dismissal last week.
The decision to lay off employees
is a result of two forces: an attempt to
"zero-base" the 1979-80 budget and
an effort to improve the overall effi
ciency of the planning department,
Massy said. Because much of the
"building crunch" will soon be over,
"some of the functions that have
been performed recently will no
longer be necessary," he said.
A zero-based budget is one in
which all expenditures are justified
and necessary, Massy said.
"You try to eliminate anything
that's an extra and you try to utilize
your personnel better. You also try to
find cheaper, but better ways of pro
viding better service," Peter Hopf,
associate director of facilities, said.
"Eliminating a master planner
makes it sound like planning is dead
and complete. Stanford has a lot of
things yet to be done, like complet
ing road and parking systems. The
slack time is when you put your staff
together making plans for the future
— you don't lay them off," Nelson
said.

Despite the layoffs, the University
will hire additional employees in
each of the three sections of the
Facilities Planning Office: Facilities
and Properties; Planning; and
Facilities Engineers. Employees in
each of these areas were among
those laid off yesterday.
Even after the new hiring the
number of employees in the
Facilities/Planning Office will be less
than it is presently, Hopf said. For
example, all six building project in
spectors will be laid off, but from
three to four additional positions will
be created in the facilities/properties
division.
"These new positions will be diffe
rent from the present positions.
There will be some overlap in pre
sent functions, but for the most part
these new people will have different
duties," Hopf said.
Also, in the planning division one
person will be hi red to perform "new
functions" after the layoff of three
individuals there. The laid-off
employees may apply for the newly
created jobs, Hopf said.
Some laid-off employees, while
sympathetic to the monetary con
cerns of the University, feel that the
decision to lay off 12 staffers was
"more than what was needed."
"If the lay-off was really due to
tight budgeting, I suspect that a lot of
people would have been willing to

put in a four-day week, rather than
be laid off. That's one alternative sol
ution to this problem," Nelson said.
Susan Kirk, laid-off administrative
assistant in the facilities/properties
division, added, "Of course I'm af
fected by the decision. I was hoping
that in the slack periods we'd do
some hard analytical work, but that
now won't be possible. But on the
whole, this was probably an utterly
necessary event."
"Much of what we were doing was
just rubbing the edges, doing things
that are expensive and not as neces
sary, though they're creative," Kirk
said.
Discussions on the implications of
budget-cutting proposals and alter
native plans to improve efficiency in
the facilities/planning office began at
the end of last summer.
"Even so, we've always known that
we would get to the end of the heavy
construction cycle, so it should have
come as no great shock that we were
going to have to make accommoda
tions by laying off employees," Hopf
said.
Nevertheless, Nelson was
"shocked" by the announcement
last week. "I had no intention of leav
ing before the mandatory retirement
age of 70, which I'd reach in five
years. I liked what I was doing and
thought what I was doing was ap
preciated. Now I'm beginning to
wonder," he said.
