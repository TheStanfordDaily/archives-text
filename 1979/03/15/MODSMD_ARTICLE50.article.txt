# Manzanita planning annual spring event
## 
### Cynthia Santana 
"Splendor on the Crass is
the most fantastic party ever to
hit campus. It doesn't quit until
everyone is exhausted, said
senior Peter McCow, who for
his second year is involved in
planning the event.
This year's Splendor on the
Crass, sponsored by Man
zanita Park, will be held Satur
day, May 19.
The first Splendor on the
Grass occurred three years ago
as an attempt to get everyone
in the trailers working cohe
sively on one project. "It re
quires an effort to be social be
cause of the geography of the
park," McGow said. "We
wanted something to bring
people out of their trailers. It
has grown initially from the
original conception and is now
open to the entire University."
Funding for the event is es
timated to be between $6000
and $7000, with Manzanita con
tributing $2000 of the budget.
All University residences have
been asked to donate $1 per
person, and Residential Educa
tion and the Office of Student
Activities are also expected to
contribute.
"It takes a tremendous

amount of personal relations,
which Stanford is missing, to
plan such an event. We want
people to stay all day and all
night meeting people, having a
good time, and doing some
hard core boogeying," McGow
said.
McGow said he hopes that
music will be provided by
some big name bands, as well
as several local groups. He said
the planners have contacted
Tower of Power and Greg Kihn.
An art show of both student
and professional displays is
also being coordinated. This
year McGow said planners
hope to have at least 20 to 30
artists, with many of them de
monstrating such techniques
as glassblowing and potter's
wheel crafts.
If it is not the art show,
music, food or good weather
that gets people out to Man
zanita Park, then it is the free
beer that will draw them.
"We're trying to find someone
to donate the beer. If we can't
find anyone other than Coors,
then we'll be perfectly happy
to deal with them, as long as
political hassles can be dealt
with," McGow said.
