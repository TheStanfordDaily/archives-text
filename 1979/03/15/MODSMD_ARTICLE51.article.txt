American commercial
movies rarely handle political
topics of any kind well; it
seems that you either get some
Hollywood depiction of a left
liberal (hardly ever a radical)
viewpoint, which has got to be
the worst mess imaginable,
and/or you just get some guy
shouting at you for two hours.
By centering its thriller plot
on a cover-up at a nuclear
power plant, The China Syn
drome risks these typical pit
falls. And it largely avoids
them.
Although this movie will
probably be universally viewed
as an "anti-nuclear" film, The
China Syndrome for the most
part stays and works well
within the limitations of the
thriller genre. If anything, the
movie's soft on the edges, be
cause its political stance is fuz
zed; whatever soapboxing it
engages in is understated.
Anti-nuclear?
The movie portrays one par
ticular power company as cut
ting corners 6n safety in order
to save money; the company
also tries to keep the full impli
cations of a near-accident at
one of its nuclear plants secret.
And that's really as "anti
nuclear" as the film gets; the
nuclear backdrop is used as the
necessary thriller premise, but
the movie hardly takes the time
to give us a "big message."
The movie relies on its stars
for most of its flash and effec
tiveness; visually, director
James Bridges (The Paper Ch
ase)i does a rather conventional
job. He keeps things from get
ting cluttered, but his deci
sions don't seem to be decisive
ones — there's no urgency in
them.
Bridges often has trouble
with a meat-and-potatoes
scene like a car chase. Bridges
shoots such scenes in a com
pletely perfunctory way, and
his editing is loose enough to
have the effect of dampening
any possible excitement. All
the sequence consists of are
five or six stock shots, and then
the movie moves on. It's al
most as if Bridges is afraid to
take charge, to tighten things
up.
Bridges is clearly better with
actors than he is with
technique. The performances,
the depth of characterization

he gets are almost unheard of
for a thriller; Bridges gets you
to care about the characters,
and this invaluable plus saves
the movie.
As a TV reporter who's
forced to do mindless feature
stories, Jane Fonda looks and
talks like every station-created
airhead we've ever seen on the
evening news. Fonda has just
the right fake smile, plastic hair
and a clipped, friendly voice;
even her name — Kimberly
Wells — fits her role at the TV
station.
Self-assured
Fonda's so self-assured in
her acting here that she shines;
when her character finally gets
a shot at hard news by inves
tigating the problems at the
nuclear plant, she handles the
added complexity effortlessly.
As Fonda's cameraman
friend, Michael Douglas is less
effective. Douglas doesn't re
ally add anything to his "com
mitted activist" role; he has a
beard and gets pissed off a lot.
The problem with Douglas's
character probably lies in the
script, though; it doesn't really
give him a chance to give his
character much depth, to get
beyond the cliched limitations
of the role.
Lemmon
In the movie's key part, Jack
Lemmon plays a supervisor in
charge of day-to-day opera
tions at the nuclear plant who
is torn between his commit
ment to his job and his fears
about the plant's safety.
It's a "man of conscience"
role, and in a lot of other ac
tors' hands it would fall apart,
but Lemmon is damn near per
fect. He even makes lines like
"I love that plant" completely
and unabashedly moving. It's
not a huge part, but it's the best
movie work Lemmon has done
in years; without him, the
movie's powerful, emotion
packed finish would collapse.
In the film's denouement,
the power company decides to
restart the nuclear plant, even
though the safety problems
which caused its closure ha
ven't been solved. At this
point, Lemmon's character de
cides to take matters into his
own hands. At gunpoint, he as
sumes command of the plant's
control room and demands to
make a statement to Fonda to

be broadcast over all of
California's TV stations.
Draining
Everything works in this
sequence; the sense of im
mediacy is completely convinc
ing. Bridges finally manages to
knot us up and leave us
drained, and that's all a thriller
promises to do.
The China Syndrome is
primarily a genre movie, but it
still has some bite. And its ef
fectiveness is not dependent
on the old "Us vs. Them" de
vices; the black-hearted cor
porporate executive-types are

kept to a minimum.
Because it's decidedly a
movie intended for mass con
sumption, the movie's view
point on the nuclear issue,
while vaguely liberal, is
obscured almost to the point of
meaninglessness. But in
straight movie terms, that's not
really important, because,
thanks to its often brilliant
characterization, and its total
lack of gimmicky devices, The
China Syndrome is the closest
American movies have come to
an emotionally-moving thriller
in a long time.
