## 'Syndrome' already has impact 
### 
Los Angeles — "I thinkit'sthe
film that I've made that will
have the most impact. And to
me, it's the perfect example of
what culture should be. You.
can take it purely on an enter
tainment level— and it works, I
think, perfectly as a thriller —
while, at the same time, if you
want to go beyond that, it is
controversial, it's dealing with
extremely important issues,
and it's thought provoking."
That's what Jane Fonda says
about her new movie, The
China Syndrome. In a town
where even the cabdrivers talk
like movie producers, such
statements are commonplace,
but in a press conference with
the film's principals (Fonda,
Jack Lemmon, Michael Doug
las and writer-director James
Bridges), this unbridled en
thusiasm for the movie was
damn near infectious.
Political emphasis
While united in their sup
port of the movie, each person
had their own view on its polit
ical emphasis, though no one
claimed that the movie is
explicitly anti-nuclear. "I per
sonally think that the theme
deals with the danger of the
fact that we've put the public's
welfare in the hands of corpo
rate executives whose primary
motivation is profit maximiza
tion," said Fonda.
Bridges sees the film as "pro
people. It is about a man
(Lemmon) who discovers that
something is the matter in this
entire structure (of the nuclear
power plant) who decides to
stand up and speak out...lt's
about good people. I never
began to work on the picture as
anti-nuclear."
Douglas, who also produced
the movie, took the producer's
stance: "We basically went out
to make a thriller. And we did it
against the background of
what we thought was the most
dramatic background we had,
which was this nuclear power
plant."
Cover-up
"I just felt it was a marvelous
story that was a viable dramatic
entity, that also, like any work

of art that's worthwhile, had a
point ot view to be taken, pro
or con," Lemmon said. "The
thing that fascinates me, and I
guess that it's because we're
the first film that's dared to
have a background of a nuclear
reactor, is that people pre
dominately (look at the poli
tics) and not all theotherthings
the movie does. We're very
worried that people will be
turned off, led into thinking it's
a message picture about nuc
lear energy.,.and that's not re
ally what the film is about. I
don't think that the whole
thing about whether or not
nuclear plants are safe is as im
portant as the suppression of
discussion. I think that the
whole side of the story with
Jane trying to get the story on
the air is more frightening."
Pressure
Anti-nuclear or not, the
movie is receiving pressure
from the nuclear industry,
which sees the film's viewpoint
as biased and potentially
damaging to them. Names and
telephone numbers are being
sent out to critics "who want to
talk to people who know what's
really going on," Bridges re
ports.
"And I," Fonda added, "a lit
tle while ago, did an interview
with Barbara Walters (shown
Tuesday of this week). We dis
cussed the movie briefly.
About four days ago, we found
out that General Electric,
which is the sponsor of the
Barbara Walters Special, with
drew its sponsorship — it turns
out not only for my segment
but for John Wayne's and Car
roll O'Connor's as well. They
said that as manufacturers of
nuclear devices, they didn't
want to sponsor a program that
I was on, and one that talked
about this film, which they felt
put an unfavorable light on the
nuclear industry/'
"But they haven't seen the
film yet," Bridges was quick to
point out.
Make it wiggle
Besides the nuclear issue,
the movie, specifically Fonda's
character, deals with the prob

lems of TV news: "television
news," Fonda said, "has be
come the most profitable part
of a day's programming. The
going concern,in the words of
a few TV consultants, is 'you've
got to make it wiggle.' Short,
snappy, a few rapes, play down
the heavy stories. Have some
kooky guy with a weird tie to
do the weather; pretty woman,
nice hair, doing the feature
stories. And if they've chosen
their personalities right, their
ratings will go up and they'll
make more money. That's a
generalization. Not all stations
are like that, there are still
some stations that like hard
news.
"Information is power. And
so the quality of the people
that are going out and getting
the news is very important. The
quality and the responsibility
and the consciousness of those
people is critical to the welfare
of the American public, as far
as I'm concerned. Woodward

and Bernstein, Seymour
Hersh, Daniel Schorr...these
are new heroes.
Lemmon, whose role as a
supervisor in a nuclear power
plant is key to the film, discus
sed acting in general as a well
as some of the problems he
had with this particular part: "I
personally feel that the talent
you may be blessed with in
order to act is a God-given
thing like the color of your
hair. The rest of it is intellec
tual. It really is. It's like
analysis. I've never been
analyzed, maybe I don't want
to tip the apple cart or some
thing, because so far it's
worked fairly well. I'm as
screwed up as anybody else.
It's figuring out why you be
have or why you say some
thing. Then once you know
that, the final step — the last
part — is the performance it
self. Therein may lie the talent,
the instincts — whatever God
gave you.

"The part intrigued me be
cause when the final script was
completed about 40% of the
part was mumbo-jumbo, tech
nical stuff that none of us will
ever understand. So how do
you get it across as an actor?
That's enticing...And the rest
of it was that I realized whether
or not you get that across, it
still is not the lines you say, it
has to be inside and a lot of it is
almost mime."
Honesty
Lemmon is fiercely proud of
The China Syndrome, and he
ripped a guy who tried to com
pare the film's promotion
campaign, with its emphasis on
youthful markets where the
nuclear issue is more active, to
the soft-news pandering that
TV news engages in in order to
increase its ratings. "The day
comes that any night, anytime
on any channel that I ever see
the news have the honesty of
this film, then I will say I regret
taking two years of my life, de
voting it to this. There is more
honesty in this. Whether any
body agrees with me or not, I
don't care, maybe I'm a little
touchy about this, a little over
protective."
Judicious and economical
Fonda allowed that the move
deals with some things super
ficially. "Perhaps we did a dis
service to the grass roots anti
nuclear movements because
we only protrayed them super
ficially. We perhaps did a dis
service to corporate executives,
some ot whom are fine people,
family men, great fathers, etc.
But you have to be real judici
ous and real economical in this
genre to be able to get into any
texture at all with characters,
stuff like that. You're essen
tially doing a thriller line. So I
know where the question is
coming from, but there's no
thing we can do about it. That's
not what the movie was ab
out."
Fonda is proud of this movie
as well; she summed up the
euphoric mood of the group,
saying "yeah, I think I'll be
nominated next year and so
will everyone else here."
