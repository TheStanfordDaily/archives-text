Bananas * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud
Those who praise Woody Allen
for his great achievement in
Annie Hall may nevertheless find
themselves a little nostalgic for
the old, anarchistic, dippily
funny early Allen. Bananas is the
quintessence of Allen's zany side
— it's comedy with virtually no
redeeming social value. In this
one he gets caught up in a Latin-
American revolution, taking
broad swipes at government, re
ligion and Howard Cosell.
—Jim Mattson
Viva llalia! * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two to
over 20 and which range in qual
ity from pointless to nearly per
fect. There are at least two
sketches which by themselves
make this movie worth seeing:
one is a truly moving portrait of
how an old woman is too proud
to object when her callous son
takes her to a nursing home
without informing her first; the
other is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is bro
ken up when his straight man re
counts his jokes in the eulogy. An
uneven film redeemed by its
quirky, wry wit.

A Wedding * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns toNashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.
-Ron Lillejord

3 Women * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
What a great movie this might
have been. Director Robert
Altman would have had the mas
terpiece he's been trying so hard
to make had he only cut this
movie by a third and called it 2
Women. Shelly Du\all and Sissy
Spacek both do superb character
renderings as two women who
work at a desert health spa and
become roommates. They're
wonderful, but then Altman
throws in his very allegorical
third woman who doesn't do
much but paint threateningly vio
lent murals and, in the film's ex
cruciatingly pretentious third
segment, give birth to a monster.
It's an ambitious effort that sim
ply doesn't gel.
—|.M.
No Time For Breakfast ★★★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
this is a good movie about a doc
tor who discovers how comfort
less the ministrations of her pro
fession can be when she finds
she is dying of cancer. Annie
Girardot, who gave last year's
Dear Detective any merit it pos
sessed, turns what was poten
tially soap-opera material into a
very moving performance.
—J.M.
Murmur of the Heart * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This isn't exactly your standard
study of adolescence. Louis
Malle shows a master's touch
with this seemingly amoral com
edy about a wealthy Italian family
of boys. There are encounters
with the girls next door, with
prostitutes, and with incest: all,
in Malle's vision, mean about the
same. Lea Massari does a fine job
with her role as the blowsy,
cheerful, very sensuous mother
of the clan,
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★ 1 1
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen
Days of Heaven * * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.
—J.M.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQof 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.
Agatha * *
Old Mill
About "what might have hap
pened" during Agatha Christie's
still-unexplained 10-day disap
pearance in 1926. Director
Michael Apted is into making
pretty pictures and not much
else; the only thing he borrows
from Christie is her name and a
twist ending. The movie certainly
doesn't steal her dense plotting
— little happens here. Vanessa
Redgrave captures Christie's
famous shyness and insecurity
perfectly and Apted obsessively
photographs her in artsy closeup
— Redgrave's never looked pret
tier. Dustin Hoffman looks
ludicrous at first — his hair's
slicked down, and he's never
been this well-dressed in a movie
before — he and Redgrave are an
odd pair. Somehow they're
pleasant enough together, but
they — and everything else here
— are done in by Apted's languid
approach.
—R.L.

The Credl Train Robbery ★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Michael Crichton's movie
about the "first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be; it's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, plot and a beaut
iful woman"). Butthere'senough
twists, enough Sean Connery
and enough cinematography
from the late Geoffrey Unsworth
to sustain the pleasant, glossy
feeling here — but, overall, it's
fake gloss and not real sparkle.
With Donald Sutherland and
Lesley-Anne Down.
— R.L.
Murder by Decree * * ★
Old Mill
This time around, Sherlock
Holmes and Dr. Watson are in
carnated in the form of Christ
opher Plummer and James Ma
son. They're very good — espe
cially Mason — and they have a
chance to show their stuff in an
atmospheric studio recreation of
Victorian London. The plot,
however, isn't that great; this
mystery about jack the Ripper is a
no more than passable vehicle
for the stars and sets. This is one
of these rare movies that makes
one hunger for a sequel: all the
ingredients are right for making
the definitive Sherlock Holmes
movie, given a slightly better
story.

Hardcore *
Palo Alto Square
Writer-director Paul Schrader
keeps himself detached from
what he's filming; this movie's
premise — a Calvinist
businessman from Grand Rapids
loses his daughter to California's
porno underworld and goes off
to get her back — would seem to
promise loads of emotional
theatrics, but the feeling's been
sucked out, and we're left with
Schrader's intellect and not his
guts. As the father, Ceorge C.
Scott tries hard, but he's finally
done in by the distance Schrader
keeps from the film's ugly night
world. With Season Hubley and
Peter Boyle.
—R.L.
Yojimbo * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Pauline Kael called Yojimbo
the first great "shaggy man
movie." The shaggy man in ques
tion is Toshiro Mifune, playing a
samurai warrior who comes into
a town ready to be hired by who
ever will pay him most. It's a twist
on the western where the hired
gun fights for the good side: here
both sides are bad, and the
samurai is happy to assist them in
wiping each other out. The pace
is set by the film's first scene,
where a dog comes trotting out
carrying not a bone but a human
hand. The great Akira Kurosawa
directed.
—J.M.

Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August ★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious
tale of a rich capitalistic woman
who is shipwrecked on a desert
island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
veloped to hold our attention for
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on
screen. You might be able to get
some pleasure out of the lovely
tropical scenery, but that's
scarcely enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beara
ble.
—J.M.


Somewhere among all those people below is Carol Burnett, the
best thing going for Robert Altman'sA Wedding, which plays this
weekend at the New Varsity. At right, Get Out Your Handker
chief's love-torn threesome, now at the Fine Arts.
