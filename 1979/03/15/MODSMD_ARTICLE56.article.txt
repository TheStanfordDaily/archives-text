## Tight playing lacked expression 
### 
The Vienna Chamber Musicians exhi
bited virtuosity and tight ensemble playing
Friday night, but left an unfulfilled feeling
as far as warmth and expressiveness of
sound are concerned. Advertised as prin
cipal players of the Vienna Symphony Or
chestra, some members of the group were
in fact from the Conservatory in Vienna
and were a little young to be playing with
the group. Throughout the concert, ex
pressive nuances were lost to the expanse
of Dinkelspiel and notes were missed,
especially by the hornist, because the
players' tonal concept lacked intensity.
The Schubert Quartet in C Major for
flute, guitar, viola and cello, a sort of Con
certo Grosso for the flute and guitar against
the others, is a good example of
Schubert's mastery of instrumentation.
The curious combination of instruments
was well-integrated and the themes were
well-developed. Especially effective was
the final Zingara, a daring, Spanish-style
dance, which was the best-performed
movement as well. The guitar, which was
played by the double-bassist, balanced
just right with the others, but the cellist, 21
years old, was too rough, and the flute and
viola did not project enough and were fre
quently almost inaudible.

The Musicians played the West Coast
premiere of the Divertimento for 10 Musi
cians by Erich Eder De Lastra, composed
for their group. The piece was filled with
contrasts between lyrical melodies, mar
cato bass lines, loud intrusions by the bas
soon, horn and clarinet, and driving
rhythms in the first movement; flowing
string passages in the second; and stac
cato figures in the last, with a restatement
of the opening of the piece at the very end.
The piece derived most of its interest
from the tone colors of the various instru
ments, but its thematic content is rather
simple. This was the only piece in which
the oboist, a 20-year-old, played. He had a
notably big, bright sound. Usually the
group plays the Mozart Oboe Quartet, but
since it was played here only six days be
fore, another piece was substituted. The
group's ensemble and understanding of
the De Lastra were good, but their sound
didn't fill the hall, even with all 10 mem
bers playing.
The big piece of the program was the
Schubert Octet for winds and strings.
Composed four years before the com
poser's death, this work is mature, expres
sive and decidedly romantic. It is not terri

fically profound, and yet it is never trite.
The mastery of composition shone
brightly through what weaknesses of per
formance there were. Unfortunately, the
hornist made a mistake in nearly all of his
10 or so solos in the Octet and rushed the
lovely adagio solos throughout the piece.
The highlight of the evening was the
fourth movement, Andante, a theme and
variations, the most serious movement of
the piece. Here, each virtuosic variation
was expressively played, and the group's
balance was much better, the inner violin,
viola and bassoon parts being played out
to match the group much more. Special
praise should go to Erich Hobarth, the first
violinist, for negotiating brilliantly the
treacherous passages in this movement.
Had the group played this well during the
entire concert, therewould bevery littleto
find fault with. However, in the last two
movements again, the sound was too re
served for the hall and this American re
viewer's ears.
For their lack of technical mastery and
full, vibrant sound, the Musicians have
developed good ensemble playing and are
enthusiastic performers, never losing
concentration on the music. This is their
first U.S. tour and hopefully not their last.

variations, the most serious movement of
the piece. Here, each virtuosic variation
was expressively played, and the group's
balance was much better, the inner violin,
viola and bassoon parts being played out
to match the group much more. Special
praise should go to Erich Hobarth, the first
violinist, for negotiating brilliantly the
treacherous passages in this movement.
Had the group played this well during the
entire concert, therewould bevery littleto
find fault with. However, in the last two
movements again, the sound was too re
served for the hall and this American re
viewer's ears.
For their lack of technical mastery and
full, vibrant sound, the Musicians have
developed good ensemble playing and are
enthusiastic performers, never losing
concentration on the music. This is their
first U.S. tour and hopefully not their last.
