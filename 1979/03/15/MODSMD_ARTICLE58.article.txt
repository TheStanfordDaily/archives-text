## Surprisingly watchable movie 
### 
Two surprises: Norma
Rae is a pretty decent
movie, and Sally Field is a
pretty decent actress.
Norma Rae is the story of a
woman who fights to have a
union put in at the textile
mill where she works. The
movie rises above the stan
dard underdog versus the
establishment formula for a
number of reasons, but
mostly because it refuses to
take the standard cheap
shots in making the pro
tagonist good and the an
tagonists — the mill, essen
tially — evil.
This unwillingness to
rabble-rouse elevates the
movie, but it is also respon
siblefor its major weakness.
The movie's loose, mean
dering structure, usually ef
fective in putting across the
story, occassionally verges
on non-direction. We see
Norma Rae and her New
Vork-based union mentor
spend a lot of time passing
out leaflets, but it's some
times hard to tell exactly
what they plan to ac
complish. It's as if the direc
tor, Martin Ritt, tries so hard
not to sermonize that he
purposely subdues his mes
sage.
Message
Norma Rae's message is
fairly simple, but it's not
often dealt with in Hol
lywood film. Norma Rae
celebrates the dream of the
blue-collar worker to have a
voice in the management of
the place where he or she is
employed. When the minis
ter of the town church re
fuses to allow her to hold a
Saturday union meeting on
the premises, Norma Rae
stops attending church al
together. In this movie's
basically humanistic view
point (where Norma Rae's
development as a person is
shown by her beginning to
ask questions about Dylan
Thomas and New York City),
even religion can't stand in
the way of more immediate
concerns such as better
working conditions. Ritt's
portrayal of mill-town life is
refreshing in that it treats
the town's inhabitants as

people rather than as sym
bols of the undereducated
South. A union meeting
where people are expressing
their grievances against the
mill, which looks at first like
a fairly standard compila
tion of company atrocities,
is graced by a woman who,
after speaking of her hus
band's death, offers his
clothes to anyone
who needs them — show
ing as well as anything else
the sense of faith in com
munity that suffuses Norma
Rae.

Norma Rae is not a film
without errors in judge
ment. Much ot the charac
terization slips by untap
ped. Beau Bridges, as
Norma Rae's husband, is vir
tually unused: he seems to
have been cast for the
Bridges name and ignored
from then on. Another
question arises when the
union leader from New
York, seemingly hated at
first by most of the town, is
never even threatened: his
strange ways are accepted a
little too easily. Things like

this reduce the film's effec
tiveness — Norma Rae is
another of those movies
which might have been
great instead of being
merely capable.
The casting director's
biggest coup is Sally Field,
who, to nearly everyone's
surprise, proves to be an ac
tress worthy of note. She af
fects a Southern accent for
the role and, for the most
part, it sounds great on her.
That, combined with the ac
tress' big mouth and deter
mined gait, create an inde-

lible character. Field's
dalliances on television are
quickly forgotten.
Norma Rae is a small
movie: there's scarcely a
rumble of dramatic
pyrotechnics until the
climactic work-stoppage
near the end. But it's a very
watchable film, proving
once again that a movie
needn't strive for epic status
— like F.1.5.T., the most re
cent attempt at dealing with
the labor movement — to
be effective entertain
ment.
