## 'The Visit' stunning, overwhelming 
### 
The American Conservatory
Theatre's The Visit over
whelms from the opening,
when 50 of the company enter
and speak as a Creek chorus,
to the closing scene when they
once again address the audi
ence. Their united voices fill
the theater as fully as their ap
pearance fills the eye.
Friedrich Durrenmatt's ex
pressionist tragicomedy is set
in Cullen, a small, im
poverished town. Claire
Zachanassian, the world's
richest woman, returns to Cul
len several years after her de
parture as a ridiculed and pre
gnant youth. She offers the
townspeople wealth on one
condition. She demands jus
tice: the death of Alfred 111, the
lover whose abandonment of
her led Claire into prostitution.
The town immediately and
angrily rejects Claire's offer but
she is patient. Alfred's realiza

tion that the temptation of her
money is stronger than the bat
tered morality of his neighbors
horrifies the now-popular
shopkeeper. He tries to escape
and, when he cannot, learns to
accept his fate, justice de
mands payment for the actions
of his youth.
Exaggeration and excess,
trademarks of expressionism,
are used in the attack on the
audience's senses. The Visit is
visually striking. All the
townspeople dress in drab
greens, browns, and grays.
Claire introduces the color yel
low, which Gullen accepts as
easily as it accepts her offer.
Wrenching
Claire'sentrance into town is
one of the play's brilliant mo
ments when attention is not
requested but wrenched from
one. Boby, her enormous bu
tler, preceeds her with his
grotesquely white painted face

and red lips. Robert Blackman
costumes Claire in a feathered
headress and voluminous gray
gown that, with her gaudy
flame-red wig, make her look
like a winged fury.
She is followed by her sedan
carriers (for she tires easily on
her artificial leg), four snarling,
brutal criminals whom Claire
saved from their death sen
tences. A set of aluminum
masked, black robed coffin
bearers concludes the proces
sion of monstrosities.
Brisk
Director Laird Williamson
runs the show at a brisk pace.
The three-hour play never
drags. Each scene intrigues
and, almost before it is
finished, the next is onstage.
Except for a few jarring con
temporary touches, such as a
radio playing "Stayin' Alive,"
Williamson's direction is
smoothly powerful. He com

mands uniformly excellent act
ing from each member of his
huge cast.
As Claire, Elizabeth Huddle
creates a character who elec
trifies with her anger, evokes
sympathy with her story of per
secution and disillusionment,
and charms with her stone-dry
turn of phrase. Ray Reinhardt's
Alfred 111 is equally moving as
the naive victim of revenge. He
carries the reluctant hero
through the warm welcome of
an old love, to terror, and then
acceptance of death. Raye Birk
and Sydney Walker, as the
schoolmaster and priest, re
spectively, present convincing
battles of their morals against
Claire's money, and their
shameful defeat.
Barrenness
Richard Segan's set, that of a
metal platform and scaffold

ing, reflects the cold barren
ness of Gullen. While it proves
efficient in adapting to the mul
titude of scenes, the set is not a
strong statement of anything in
and of itself, as an expres
sionist play demands.
F. Michell Dana's lighting,
particularly the sharp black
outs at emotionally tense mo
ments and the eerie light and
shadow of the forest where
Claire and Alfred used to meet,
contributes greatly to each
scene's effect on the audience.
The Visit is a stunning pro
duct of ACT's combined ta
lents. When the lights black
out on the now wealthy people
of Gullen chanting "hold back
the night" to a god glowing of
silver, we know that Claire has
indeed succeeded in making a
brothel of "the world who
made me a whore."

mands payment for the actions
of his youth.
Exaggeration and excess,
trademarks of expressionism,
are used in the attack on the
audience's senses. The Visit is
visually striking. All the
townspeople dress in drab
greens, browns, and grays.
Claire introduces the color yel
low, which Gullen accepts as
easily as it accepts her offer.
Wrenching
Claire'sentrance into town is
one of the play's brilliant mo
ments when attention is not
requested but wrenched from
one. Boby, her enormous bu
tler, preceeds her with his
grotesquely white painted face

and red lips. Robert Blackman
costumes Claire in a feathered
headress and voluminous gray
gown that, with her gaudy
flame-red wig, make her look
like a winged fury.
She is followed by her sedan
carriers (for she tires easily on
her artificial leg), four snarling,
brutal criminals whom Claire
saved from their death sen
tences. A set of aluminum
masked, black robed coffin
bearers concludes the proces
sion of monstrosities.
Brisk
Director Laird Williamson
runs the show at a brisk pace.
The three-hour play never
drags. Each scene intrigues
and, almost before it is
finished, the next is onstage.
Except for a few jarring con
temporary touches, such as a
radio playing "Stayin' Alive,"
Williamson's direction is
smoothly powerful. He com

mands uniformly excellent act
ing from each member of his
huge cast.
As Claire, Elizabeth Huddle
creates a character who elec
trifies with her anger, evokes
sympathy with her story of per
secution and disillusionment,
and charms with her stone-dry
turn of phrase. Ray Reinhardt's
Alfred 111 is equally moving as
the naive victim of revenge. He
carries the reluctant hero
through the warm welcome of
an old love, to terror, and then
acceptance of death. Raye Birk
and Sydney Walker, as the
schoolmaster and priest, re
spectively, present convincing
battles of their morals against
Claire's money, and their
shameful defeat.
Barrenness
Richard Segan's set, that of a
metal platform and scaffold

ing, reflects the cold barren
ness of Gullen. While it proves
efficient in adapting to the mul
titude of scenes, the set is not a
strong statement of anything in
and of itself, as an expres
sionist play demands.
F. Michell Dana's lighting,
particularly the sharp black
outs at emotionally tense mo
ments and the eerie light and
shadow of the forest where
Claire and Alfred used to meet,
contributes greatly to each
scene's effect on the audience.
The Visit is a stunning pro
duct of ACT's combined ta
lents. When the lights black
out on the now wealthy people
of Gullen chanting "hold back
the night" to a god glowing of
silver, we know that Claire has
indeed succeeded in making a
brothel of "the world who
made me a whore."

Elizabeth Huddle and Ray Reinhardt in the American Conservatory
Theater production of Friedrich Duerrenmatt's surrealistic morality
play The Visit, directed by Laird Williamson and now playing in
repertory at the Geary.
The American Conservatory
Theatre's The Visit over
whelms from the opening,
when 50 of the company enter
and speak as a Creek chorus,
to the closing scene when they
once again address the audi
ence. Their united voices fill
the theater as fully as their ap
pearance fills the eye.
Friedrich Durrenmatt's ex
pressionist tragicomedy is set
in Cullen, a small, im
poverished town. Claire
Zachanassian, the world's
richest woman, returns to Cul
len several years after her de
parture as a ridiculed and pre
gnant youth. She offers the
townspeople wealth on one
condition. She demands jus
tice: the death of Alfred 111, the
lover whose abandonment of
her led Claire into prostitution.
The town immediately and
angrily rejects Claire's offer but
she is patient. Alfred's realiza

tion that the temptation of her
money is stronger than the bat
tered morality of his neighbors
horrifies the now-popular
shopkeeper. He tries to escape
and, when he cannot, learns to
accept his fate, justice de
mands payment for the actions
of his youth.
