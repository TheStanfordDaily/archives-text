# Mirlo residents aid police; man arraigned on burglary charges
## 
### Rachel Bagby 
An East Palo Alto man arrested in
Florence Moore's Mirlo dormitory
last Tuesday will be arraigned today
in Palo Alto Municipal Court on two
counts of burglary, according to
police.
Tommy Lynn Augmon, 21, proba
bly would not have been ap
prehended if Mirlo residents James
Brown and John Knight hadn't been
alert, said Raoul Niemeyer, captain
of the Dept. of Public Safety's detec
tive division.

Brown and Knight became sus
picious when they saw Augmon and
another stranger wandering around
Mirlo halls, Brown said. After seeing
Augmon coming out of the victim's
room, Brown went in and discovered
her purse had been ransacked.
"I had been in the room a few mi
nutes before and saw her put $10 in
her purse. I went to get her and she
came back and said for sure that the
$10 was missing," Brown said.
"When I went back to tell my
roommate (Knight) what had hap
pened he had already phoned the
police/' Brown continued. Brown
followed the suspects and, despite
their threats and verbal abuse, was
able to detain them long enough for
the police to arrive. "I just wasn't
scared by their intimidation tactics,"
Brown said.
Campus police suspect that Au
gmon is responsible for many of a
string of thefts that have recently
plagued the residence halls,
Niemeyer said. Another theft victim
identified Augmon yesterday as the
man she saw coming out of her room
right before she noticed money mis
sing from her wallet, he said.
According to Niemeyer, 29 thefts
and the loss of $4531 in cash and

other items have been reported so
far this year.
"This is a significant increase over
the number of theft incidents re
ported last year," he said, adding
that it's quite possible that more in
cidents have occurred than have
been reported.
Niemeyer said the thefts generally
occurred during late evening, early
morning and heavy traffic hours.
"Outsiders — non-students — have
been hitting at dinner and shower
times," he explained. "They try to
locate rooms that are unlocked and
unoccupied."
"If they walk into a room and
there's somebody there they'll just
make- some excuse or say they're
looking for a friend or something,"
he continued. "If the room is unoc
cupied, they take wallets, jewelry,
watches, shoes, stereo equipment,
whatever is visible and easily con
verted."
Niemeyer said most of the thefts
could have been avoided if students
would lock their doors whenever
they leave their rooms. "Unfortu
nately, many of the students are so
trusting they just leave their doors
unlocked," he said. "They have to
learn to be more suspicious."
