## Uneven relief 
### 
For those who find the
Guarneri Quartet some
what somber or the Juilliard
a bit frantic, the Music From
Marlboro visit last weekend
provided relief. The six
musicians were personable,
relaxed, and, with the ex
ception of Isidore Cohen,
quite young.
The Marlboro Festival, di
rected by Rudolf Serkin, is a
summer gathering of East
Coast musicians in the hills
of New Hampshire, where
they can escape from rigor
ous engagement schedules.
During the year, Music
From Marlboro organizes
short tours forits musicians,
who are mostly young up
and-coming players.
This concert clearly exhi
bited both the advantages
and disadvantages of this
sort of arrangement. As
young musicians, together
for only three weeks, they
played with enthusiasm,
freshness and a sense of
humor. But, for the same
reasons, their ensemble
and blend was uneven,
musical interpretation was
inhibited, and technical
problems occasionally in
terfered. Although the
BoccheriniQu/nfef in G and
the Mozart Oboe Quartet,
both virtuosic rather than
eminently expressive
works, showed off the en
semble's good points, the
Schubert Quintet in C, one
of the greatest works of 19th
Century Romanticism, suf
fered from their lack of ex
perience.

From the opening vir
tuoso run by Jerry
Grossman, the star cellist of
the group, the Marlboro in
terpreted the Boccerini with
a clean, bright, Italianesque
style. There was some re
sidual unevenness, but the
overall effect was exciting. A
driving beat animated the
fast movements, the bag
pipe effects and trills of the
Minuetto were humorously
rendered.
The Mozart Quartet is ac
tually an oboe solo with
string accompaniment.
Young oboe soloist
Rudolph Vrbsky played the
difficult solo with near
perfect technique, albeit a
rather stodgy tempo.
But the Schubert was the
musical highlight of the af
ternoon — and here the en
semble fell short of the
mark. The two cellos
blended well, but Judith
Serkin could not match
Grossman's technique,
dropping notes and rumbl
ing unpleasantly on the
lower strings.
Musical interpretation,
however, presented the
greatest problem. To play
Schubert in the pristine
style natural to the
Marlboro ensemble, tech
nical security, intensity, and
quick tempos are virtual
necessities. In the Marlboro
group's playing, the feeling
of a struggle with the notes
constantly pervaded the
sound. But one movement,
the Scherzo, was magnifi
cent.
