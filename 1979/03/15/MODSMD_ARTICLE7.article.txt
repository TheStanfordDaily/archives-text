# Graduate senate absenteeism a problem
## 
### Lisa Osborne 
Poor attendance by almost half
the ASSU Senate at senate meet
ings is "a very serious problem,"
according to senate chairperson
Pete Stamos, and yet there is very
little that can be done to improve
it, say the absentees.
The chronic absentees are
among the 10 graduate senators.
According to attendance records,
none of the 10 undergraduate
senators have missed more than
two of the senate's five regular
meetings this quarter. But seven
of the 10 graduate senators have
missed three or more of the five
meetings.
Undergraduate senator Ted
Gardenswartz expressed his con
cern saying that without good
graduate representation, the en
tire senate is "ripped off" because

"they (graduates) have a lot to of
fer."
Stamos said that it is "a very
serious problem," which is indi
cative of graduate students'
apathy. He said that because only
10 graduates ran for the senate last
year, graduate alternate positions
were not filled. Undergraduates
can be replaced by an alternate if
they miss meetings, he said, but
graduates can not.
Deric Jennings, a former ASSU
senator and COP member said
that nothing can be done about
poor graduate attendance except
an expensive — as much as $2000
— recall election. "Generally a
person who works hard to get in,
will work hard when they are on
the senate," he said, and some
graduates were elected last year
with virtually no effort at all.

Many of the graduate senators
said that they had been genuinely
interested in serving on the se
nate, but for various reasons had
not been attending meetings.
The most common reasons
cited were departmental pressure
to not get involved in student poli
tics, "inefficient" meetings and a
lack of time. The senators also
complained that the senate did
not deal with graduate needs.
Departments pressure graduate
students to stay out of student
politics, said one graduate of
ficeholder who chose to remain
anonymous. He said that "profes
sors see their chief function as
turning out Ph.D.s," and are
"jealous" of activities which take
graduates away from their re
search and studies.
He suggested that departmen

tal pressure might also be due to
what he called "a type of conspi
racy theory." He explained that
administration and faculty mem
bers might fear the changes that a
"very active graduate group"
might bring, specifically of rules
and policies which affect stu
dents, such as tuition and hous
ing.
He also stated that most of the
graduate senators he knows have
faced some type of pressure, usu
ally "through jokes and innuen
dos."
lennings said that professors
expect graduates to be "profes
sionals," and see student gov
ernment as an "inherently point
less and purposeless exercise."
Professors view those involved in
politics with "tremendous suspi
cion." He said that he had been
"told directly" by professors and
co-workers that he was "making a
tremendous mistake" in being in
volved in student government.
He said, "I basically ignored it
(the pressure)," but admitted that
he is now "paying the consequ
ences."
Jennings said that he is now
going through job interviews and
that, for graduate students, being
involved in student politics "is as
much a mark against you as for
you" because employers "think
that you are not serious about
your work." He said that if he
were to do it all again, he would
still be involved in politics, but not
as much.
Several graduate senators said
that senate meetings were often
inefficient and wasted a great deal
of time. Graduate senator Mark
Morris described the meetings as
"four-ring circuses," where
"everyone has to put in their two

dollars' worth."
Robert Shearer, graduate
senator, said that the senate fo
cused more often on under
graduate issues, rather than on
graduate needs. ASSU Co
president Mary Morimoto agreed
that the senate could deal more
with graduate studies, financial
aids and housing, but that the
graduate senators needed to be
more "aggressive" to see that
these issues were discussed.
Co-president Fred Estes said
undergraduates are rewarded
more often than graduates for
their participation in student gov
ernment. Unlike undergraduates,
he said, graduates do not get "re
sume value," and more often
must depend on "internal satis
faction" rather than on external
rewards. Jennings added that
graduate senators do not get sup
port from their departments,
prospective employers or their
peers.
