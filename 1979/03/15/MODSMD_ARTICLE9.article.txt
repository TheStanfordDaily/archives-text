# Jing Lyman defines her role...
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
She is a member of the Har
vard Board of Overseers Visit
ing Committee to Harvard and
Radcliffe Colleges. She is
vice-chairwoman of Women
and Foundations : Corporate
Philanthropy. She is hostess to
scores of dignitaries, profes
sors, parents and students an
nually. She is Elizabeth "Jing"
Lyman as much as she is Mrs.
Richard Lyman.
As wife of the University's
president, Jing Lyman leads an
active life. Although not offi
cially defined, her role as the
University's first lady involves
making numerous speeches,
playing hostess to hundreds of
guests, raising funds for the
University, representing the

University at various functions
and often arbitrating between
the University and other in
stitutions.
Because her role as the pres
ident's wife has no official
parameters, Lyman has been
able to "carve out" a position
for herself here â€” a position
which includes extensive activ
ity outside the University and
its related functions. Lyman
said, "I'm very lucky to have
support from Dick and the
University to play the role I
want to play."
Since 1958, when the Lymans
came here from St. Louis, she
has pursued her own interests
in community, academic and
women's affairs. Former presi
dent of the Midpeninsula Citi-

Zens for Fair Housing, Lyman
has chaired a task force, com
prised chiefly of University
students and established to
focus attention on housing
discrimination. Lyman cited
this as a valuable experience.
"It was great getting to know
the students and getting to
gether on a common project."
She has also served on the
Northern California Steering
Committee and is currently in
volved with a national organi
zation committed to fund
raising for women's research.
Lyman said she can be an agent
for change "not only here but
nationally. I am known among
my peers as one of the few
people who really likes what I
do."

A graduate of Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania,
Lyman enjoyed her college
years although "the intensity
there scared me." She de
scribed herself as being a typi
cal Swarthmore student then,
"in that I was an activist with a
social conscience. In terms of
academic prowess, I was not so
typical. I had trouble in
school."
Lyman noted that "although
it's hard to generalize, stu
dents today are very con
cerned with academic perfor
mance.
College students have
changed significantly in recent
years, according to Lyman.
"The kids of the 70s don't have
