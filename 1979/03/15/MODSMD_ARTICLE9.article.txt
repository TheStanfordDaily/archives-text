# Jing Lyman defines her role...
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
She is a member of the Har
vard Board of Overseers Visit
ing Committee to Harvard and
Radcliffe Colleges. She is
vice-chairwoman of Women
and Foundations : Corporate
Philanthropy. She is hostess to
scores of dignitaries, profes
sors, parents and students an
nually. She is Elizabeth "Jing"
Lyman as much as she is Mrs.
Richard Lyman.
As wife of the University's
president, Jing Lyman leads an
active life. Although not offi
cially defined, her role as the
University's first lady involves
making numerous speeches,
playing hostess to hundreds of
guests, raising funds for the
University, representing the

University at various functions
and often arbitrating between
the University and other in
stitutions.
Because her role as the pres
ident's wife has no official
parameters, Lyman has been
able to "carve out" a position
for herself here — a position
which includes extensive activ
ity outside the University and
its related functions. Lyman
said, "I'm very lucky to have
support from Dick and the
University to play the role I
want to play."
Since 1958, when the Lymans
came here from St. Louis, she
has pursued her own interests
in community, academic and
women's affairs. Former presi
dent of the Midpeninsula Citi-

Zens for Fair Housing, Lyman
has chaired a task force, com
prised chiefly of University
students and established to
focus attention on housing
discrimination. Lyman cited
this as a valuable experience.
"It was great getting to know
the students and getting to
gether on a common project."
She has also served on the
Northern California Steering
Committee and is currently in
volved with a national organi
zation committed to fund
raising for women's research.
Lyman said she can be an agent
for change "not only here but
nationally. I am known among
my peers as one of the few
people who really likes what I
do."

A graduate of Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania,
Lyman enjoyed her college
years although "the intensity
there scared me." She de
scribed herself as being a typi
cal Swarthmore student then,
"in that I was an activist with a
social conscience. In terms of
academic prowess, I was not so
typical. I had trouble in
school."
Lyman noted that "although
it's hard to generalize, stu
dents today are very con
cerned with academic perfor
mance.
College students have
changed significantly in recent
years, according to Lyman.
"The kids of the 70s don't have
the hostility, the sense of con
frontation of the '60s. Students
today are more preoccupied
with themselves. It would be
better if they could get outside
themselves and look at the is
sues."
One of the drawbacks of her
job is the lack of student con
tact, according to Lyman. She
said, "We often get removed
from student life but student
helpers give us a chance to get
to know some students." The
Lymans regularly employ stu
dents to work in the presiden
tial residence, the Herbert
Hoover house.
The mansion, once home of
Herbert Hoover, was designed
for a live-in staff of five. Cur
rently, the Lymans employ two
part-time staff members forthe
house, various student helpers
and occasionally, a catering
service. Furnished in a unique
combination of antiques and

contemporary pieces, the
mansion is the site of numer
ous University social func
tions.
Most of these functions are
enjoyable, noted Lyman, "al
though I don't enjoy all aspects
of all of them in the end. It's
like going on stage — you rev
yourself up."
Lyman said she feels compe
tent in her role as the Univer
sity hostess. She explained,
"I'm good at creating an envi
ronment in which people feel
comfortable and received."
Lyman often sees herself as a
"connector" between the Uni
versity and outside organiza
tions and recognizes the value
of this connection. She
explained, "My contacts (with
other institutions) are very use
ful, and indicate to the trustees
of these foundations where
Dick and the University stand
on these issues. It's a healthy
interaction."

She pointed to the "frantic
pace" of her job and said the
tension associated with the
executive roles is "very rough,
but Dick and I are people who
thrive on it."
Lyman denied that she has
significant impact on her hus
band's policy decisions. "We
talk shop a lot and try things
out on each other, but I don't
make any policy decisions. I'm

not a power behind the
throne."
She said the University pres
idency "has been a very posi
tive thing in our relationship.
We've worked very close to
each other without being
competitive."
But, the frantic life of a uni
versity president's wife can
also be lonely, according to
Lyman. She said, "There's

often no one I can confide in."
Overall, Lyman sees the role
of the wife of a university pres
ident "as changing very
rapidly" and explained that
"the important thing is that this
position at Stanford University
has given me the place to make
a significant contribution to
the University and to be some
one in my own right, doing
something useful."
