AN EASTER LESSON
Not too tar away, in the land of Eg, there once
lived a rabbit named Little Bunny FooFoo
FooFoo was a good, obedient rabbit most ot the
time
When Easter time arrived every year, FooFoo
turned into a mischievous bunny Despite the
warnings and admonishment of the older rabbits
FooFoo left black, rotter <jggs for fhe children on
Easter morning and laughed with delight when
the children found the spoiled eggs
