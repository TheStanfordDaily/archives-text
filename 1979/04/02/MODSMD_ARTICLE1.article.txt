# Brown wants Rancho Seco closed
## Carter visits nuclear plant 
### 
Harrisburg, Pa. (AP) — Engineers slowly shrank a po
tentially explosive gas bubble in the reactor of the crip
pled Three Mile Island nuclear plant yesterday, as Presi
dent Jimmy Carter visited the plant and suggested a
precautionary evacuation may be necessary within a few
days.
Local officials in the area of the plant readied con
tingency plans for such an evacuation and said late yes
terday that arrangements were nearly complete for re
locating the elderly, invalids and persons in institutions
such as hospitals and jails.
"We'd like to have things in shape," commented
Francis Hess, commissioner of Carroll Township, east of
the plant. He said 1000 copies of a public notice advising
people what to do if an evacuation is ordered were
distributed yesterday.
Gov. Dick Thornburgh said in a statement last night
that schools within five miles of the plant should remain
closed today. He said state government offices will be
open as usual, but with generous leaves granted for
"absentees."
Although an estimated 50,000 persons have fled the
Harrisburg area since Wednesday's accident touched off
the first of a continuing series of low-level radiation
leaks, Carter said that even if an evacuation is ordered,
"this will not indicate the danger is high. . . .It is purely
a precautionary measure.
"Radiation is being monitored throughout this area
and any trends towards increase in radiation will be
reported to me," Carter said, after touring the plant
control room.
"At the present time, the reactor core is indeed stable.
However, within the next few days, important decisions
will be made on how to bring it to a cold and stable state.
"If it becomes necessary, Gov. (Dick) Thornburgh will
ask you to take appropriate action. If he does, I want the
instructions carried out as calmly as they have been in
the past few days."
Carter promised "a thorough inquiry" into the acci
dent and said he will "be personally responsible for
informing the American people about this particular in
cident and the status of nuclear safety in the future."
Harold Denton, operations chief of the Nuclear Reg
ulatory Commission and Carter's personal representa
tive here, said: "From the data we've seen, I'm con
vinced the size of the bubble is being reduced.
"If we don't succeed in further reducing the bubble in
the next few days, we would have to go to emergency
core cooling systems to take it to a cold shutdown." The
reactor core temperature remained steady yesterday at
278 degrees Fahrenheit.
The bubble, located in the top of the sealed reactor
dome, contains hydrogen and small amounts of oxygen.
NRC officials agree the oxygen content is increasing, but
they differ on how fast.
Too much oxygen could spark a chemical explosion
that would rip off the top of the dome, shooting high

level radiation into the atmosphere.
The amount of oxygen in the bubble has risen to
between 2 and 3 percent since last Wednesday's acci
dent, NRC officialssay. The bubble would be potentially
flammable when the oxygen level reached 5 percent and
potentially explosive at 16 percent.
NRC spokesman Frank Ingram said in Washington on
Saturday night that the bubble could become flammable
within several days. But Denton said it could take 12 days
to become flammable and possibly twice as long before
the bubble actually would explode.
One of the options under consideration by the NRC is
allowing the bubble to expand so it could be removed
through the cooling water system.
But this creates the spectre of exposing the uranium
filled fuel rods which then might overheat, threatening a
disastrous melt-down which at its worst, and under the
worst weather conditions, could contaminate
thousands of square miles with radiation.
The NRC said, meanwhile, that its representatives at
the facility "were informed at 10:45 p.m. on March 31
that there would be an attempt to sabotage the facility
during the night. The FBI, Pennsylvania State Police and
the licensee, Metropolitan Edison, were notified."
FBI duty officer Otis Cox said later that the agency was
checking out "around half a dozen rumors" of attemp
ted or threatened sabotage, but has confirmed none of
them.
Here in California, Gov. Jerry Brown asked the NRC
fora "precautionary and temporary" closing of a nuclear
power plant near Sacramento that is a virtual duplicate of
the stricken Three Mile Island plant.
"Since the Rancho Seco facility is a near twin of the
Three Mile Island plant, prudence dictates closing of the
Rancho Seco facility until the causes of the Three Mile
Island incident are satisfactorily identified," Brown said
in a telegram to the NRC.
The possibility that a "generic defect caused or con
tributed to the Three Mile Island problem cannot be
ruled out," Brown said.
He added that such a defect could exist in the Rancho
Seco plant and said he believed the facility should be
closed "until the NRC can assure us that the plant is safe
and does not suffer from a serious generic defect."
The plant's board of directors, in an informal poll
conducted Friday by officials at the facility, voted 3-2
against a shutdown. But Jeff Marx, a spokesman for the
Sacramento Metropolitan Utility District, which oper
ates the facility, had no immediate comment.
And as new questions were being asked about nuclear
energy's role in meeting U.S. energy needs, Congress
members were awaiting word from Carter on whether
he plans to lift price controls on a more traditional
source of power, crude oil.
The president had indicated he would make his
energy plans known in a speech this week — although a
specific time has not been set.

the facility "were informed at 10:45 p.m. on March 31
that there would be an attempt to sabotage the facility
during the night. The FBI, Pennsylvania State Police and
the licensee, Metropolitan Edison, were notified."
FBI duty officer Otis Cox said later that the agency was
checking out "around half a dozen rumors" of attemp
ted or threatened sabotage, but has confirmed none of
them.
Here in California, Gov. Jerry Brown asked the NRC
fora "precautionary and temporary" closing of a nuclear
power plant near Sacramento that is a virtual duplicate of
the stricken Three Mile Island plant.
"Since the Rancho Seco facility is a near twin of the
Three Mile Island plant, prudence dictates closing of the
Rancho Seco facility until the causes of the Three Mile
Island incident are satisfactorily identified," Brown said
in a telegram to the NRC.
The possibility that a "generic defect caused or con
tributed to the Three Mile Island problem cannot be
ruled out," Brown said.
He added that such a defect could exist in the Rancho
Seco plant and said he believed the facility should be
closed "until the NRC can assure us that the plant is safe
and does not suffer from a serious generic defect."
The plant's board of directors, in an informal poll
conducted Friday by officials at the facility, voted 3-2
against a shutdown. But Jeff Marx, a spokesman for the
Sacramento Metropolitan Utility District, which oper
ates the facility, had no immediate comment.
And as new questions were being asked about nuclear
energy's role in meeting U.S. energy needs, Congress
members were awaiting word from Carter on whether
he plans to lift price controls on a more traditional
source of power, crude oil.
The president had indicated he would make his
energy plans known in a speech this week — although a
specific time has not been set.

a potentially explosive gas bubble which formed inside the
reac tor building. Despite this, officials termed the situation
at the plant stable.
Harrisburg, Pa. (AP) — Engineers slowly shrank a po
tentially explosive gas bubble in the reactor of the crip
pled Three Mile Island nuclear plant yesterday, as Presi
dent Jimmy Carter visited the plant and suggested a
precautionary evacuation may be necessary within a few
days.
Local officials in the area of the plant readied con
tingency plans for such an evacuation and said late yes
terday that arrangements were nearly complete for re
locating the elderly, invalids and persons in institutions
such as hospitals and jails.
"We'd like to have things in shape," commented
Francis Hess, commissioner of Carroll Township, east of
the plant. He said 1000 copies of a public notice advising
people what to do if an evacuation is ordered were
distributed yesterday.
Gov. Dick Thornburgh said in a statement last night
that schools within five miles of the plant should remain
closed today. He said state government offices will be
open as usual, but with generous leaves granted for
"absentees."
Although an estimated 50,000 persons have fled the
Harrisburg area since Wednesday's accident touched off
the first of a continuing series of low-level radiation
leaks, Carter said that even if an evacuation is ordered,
"this will not indicate the danger is high. . . .It is purely
a precautionary measure.
"Radiation is being monitored throughout this area
and any trends towards increase in radiation will be
reported to me," Carter said, after touring the plant
control room.
"At the present time, the reactor core is indeed stable.
However, within the next few days, important decisions
will be made on how to bring it to a cold and stable state.
"If it becomes necessary, Gov. (Dick) Thornburgh will
ask you to take appropriate action. If he does, I want the
instructions carried out as calmly as they have been in
the past few days."
Carter promised "a thorough inquiry" into the acci
dent and said he will "be personally responsible for
informing the American people about this particular in
cident and the status of nuclear safety in the future."
Harold Denton, operations chief of the Nuclear Reg
ulatory Commission and Carter's personal representa
tive here, said: "From the data we've seen, I'm con
vinced the size of the bubble is being reduced.
"If we don't succeed in further reducing the bubble in
the next few days, we would have to go to emergency
core cooling systems to take it to a cold shutdown." The
reactor core temperature remained steady yesterday at
278 degrees Fahrenheit.
The bubble, located in the top of the sealed reactor
dome, contains hydrogen and small amounts of oxygen.
NRC officials agree the oxygen content is increasing, but
they differ on how fast.
Too much oxygen could spark a chemical explosion
that would rip off the top of the dome, shooting high

level radiation into the atmosphere.
The amount of oxygen in the bubble has risen to
between 2 and 3 percent since last Wednesday's acci
dent, NRC officialssay. The bubble would be potentially
flammable when the oxygen level reached 5 percent and
potentially explosive at 16 percent.
NRC spokesman Frank Ingram said in Washington on
Saturday night that the bubble could become flammable
within several days. But Denton said it could take 12 days
to become flammable and possibly twice as long before
the bubble actually would explode.
One of the options under consideration by the NRC is
allowing the bubble to expand so it could be removed
through the cooling water system.
But this creates the spectre of exposing the uranium
filled fuel rods which then might overheat, threatening a
disastrous melt-down which at its worst, and under the
worst weather conditions, could contaminate
thousands of square miles with radiation.
The NRC said, meanwhile, that its representatives at
the facility "were informed at 10:45 p.m. on March 31
