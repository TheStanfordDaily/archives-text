Why have we not yet deregulated the trucking
industry?
Leading liberal U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), presidential inflation fighter Alfred
Kahn, many conservatives, and all libertarians
strongly support deregulation of trucking.
Deregulation would bring lower prices to the
consumer, increase economic efficiency, create
new jobs, and vastly expand opportunities avail
able to small independent truckers.
Airline deregulation has brought lower prices
to the consumers, an increase in the number of
passengers, and higher profits for the airlines.
Yet, the strongest opponents of airline deregu
lation were the airlines themselves.
The major difference between trucking and
the airlines is that the trucking cartel (along with
the Teamsters Union) wields a great deal more
political power than does its counterpart in the
airline industry.
Put quite simply, the trucking industry has not
yet been deregulated because the established
interests in trucking oppose it.
There is a common belief among both liberals
and conservatives that businessmen and
capitalists naturally support the free market and
laissez-faire capitalism. Experience shows
otherwise.
Many businessmen have a strong dislike for
laissez-faire. The rigors of free competition, the
necessity of competing for the consumer's
favor, and the uncertainty of profit or loss are
causes for unease among businessmen.
A government regulatory agency, even if os
tensibly created to control business, can be an
enormous boon to businessmen who fear the
rigors of laissez-faire. Such an agency can
"rationalize" and "stabilize" an industry by fix
ing prices, restricting entry into the industry,
and guaranteeing profits. In short, the agency
can outlaw competition and establish a legal
cartel for the benefit of business.
In a highly regulated and controlled economy
such as our own, such a development is nearly
inevitable. Croups such as "Nader's Raiders"
may occasionally be able to shine a public spot
light on a particular agency, but the majority of
regulatory agencies will remain in the dark.
While the public's interest is wide and diffuse,
the interest of a particular regulated industry is
narrow and concentrated. An agency regulating
a particular industry will therefore normally be
under strong and persistent pressure from that
industry and little or no pressure from the pub
lic.
It would be amazing if a regulatory agency
were not "captured" by the industry regulated.
It is important to note that this result need not
flow from any exceptional villainy on the part of

bureaucrats, legislators, or citizens. It is rather
the result of our existing politico-economic sys
tem â€” a system which attempts to combine
political democracy with massive regulation of a
large and enormously complex economy.
Of course in the absence of government regu
lation, many businessmen will attempt to form
cartels on the free market. However, such at
tempts at cartelization are notably unstable and
short-lived when not backed by the power of
government.
Socialist historian Gabriel Kolko in his The
Triumph of Conservatism, shows that such at
tempts, rampant in the late nineteenth century,
were repeatedly and rapidly foiled by the forces
of the market.
He further demonstrates that many big
businessmen afterward turned to federal regu
lation as a means to escape the discipline of
laissez-faire.
In short, Kolko argues that many regulatory
agencies did not experience an immaculate
conception but were rather born in sin, that
liberal rhetoric has been consistently used to
mask conservative or reactionary interests.
Under the guise of the public welfare, we
have created in this country in the last century
an enormous economy of privilege, a massive
interlocking of political and economic power
aimed at preserving the status quo.
Public utilities are granted by the government
a monopoly franchise and a guaranteed profit;
industry is granted protective tariffs and quotas
and government subsidies.
The result is a decline in economic opportun
ity, an increase in unemployment, a retardation
of economic growth and a rise in prices.
As Kennedy candidly stated in December
1975 (cited in Reason, Jan. 1978): "The problems
of our economy have occurred not as an out
growth of laissez-faire, unbridled competition.
They have occurred under the guidance of fed
eral agencies, under the umbrella of federal
regulations."
Recently, in a surprising show of agreement,
Republicans and Democrats on the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress united in is
suing a report conceding the failure of the
economic policies of the last half century. But
neither major party possesses the will or the
ideas to find a way out.
The only realistic solution is simple in concep
tion though difficult in execution: we must take
a meat-axe to the whole politico-economic sys
tem of regulation and privilege. We must estab
lish the reign of the free market, of laissez-faire
capitalism.
