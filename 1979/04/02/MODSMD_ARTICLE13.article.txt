Article overstated
The quotes attributed to me
in the Daily article (March 15)
on the layoffs in the Facilities
and Planning Offices, while
substantially correct, made it
appear that I enthusiastically
endorsed the layoffs. I'm afraid
that's a position which accords
me far more nobility than I pre
tend to claim.
Organizations, like indi
viduals, often benefit from
change. One may support the
need to reduce strictly un
necessary expenditures and to
rearrange the way in which
business is conducted even if
one may not wholly endorse all
the specific ways in which the
change has been ac
complished.
The Facilities, Planning and
Engineering Offices have, for
nearly a year, been wrestling
with two ostensibly separate
but interdependent proces
ses: a new budgeting process
which examines each activity
on its merits, allowing only
those to survive which are
strictly necessary; and a re
newed commitment to do
those things which must be
done in the most efficient and
productive way. Two perhaps
inevitable results are that some
things which used to be done
will not be done at all or ac
complished by other staff, and
that less funds will thereby be
required and made available.
My comment about the
"necessity" of the reorganiza
tion was made in that general
context. Serious reduction in
funds often leads necessarily
to a reduction or rearrange
ment in staff. Sometimes those
reductions involve doing away
with a thoroughness of ap
proach to a problem or situa
tion, an approach which may
have served us well in the past
but which could otherwise be
confirmed by simple good
judgment, a little luck and cer
tainly less paper.
I am sympathetic to the be
nefits of change even though I
am less than enthusiastic about
my own dispensibility.

The statement by Corb Smith
iD.tily, March f>) that English
universities do not have the
dormitory system, and that this

justifies Cliveden, is incredi
ble. English universities are
models of residential univer
sities. I spent years at Oxford,
and while preparing a report
on European studies in British
universities I visited every
British university. All had some
kind of residences.
The University of California
has 14 operations in England,
three in Scotland and one in
Ireland. The biggest are at the
universities of Sussex and
Edinburgh. UC-Berkeley alone
sends some 20 students to each
every year.
In my recent lecture tour of
European universities I was
impressed by the University of
California operation at the
University of Kent. The Ameri
can students live in one of the
most historic cities in Europe,
Canterbury, and are housed in
dormitories on a modern cam
pus where they can learn first
hand about contemporary Bri
tain.
British universities overbuilt
during the boom years, and
some, like UC-Santa Cruz, ac
tually suffer from a lack of
clientele. There may be
reasons for Cliveden, but not
the one given.
Incidentally, disparaging
remarks about "tourism" show
a failure to grasp that intelli
gent tourism (not just dashing
around the country) is one of
the most humanistic forms of
education, and is integrated
into any good overseas prog
ram.

Guilt implied
A letter to the editor in the
Daily (March 7) has been
brought to my attention for its
errors of fact and omissions,
and for implying guilt to me
and to Soviet dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky. Its writer,
Michael Ballaid, suggesting he
did a thorough literature
search on the question, chal
lenges the innocence claimed
for Shcharansky by his wife and
President Jimmy Carter.
Only once before has an
American president said pub
licly that a man accused by the
Soviets of spying for the United
F .v?s was innocent; that was
almost two decades ago, and
President |ohn Kennedy said
it about a fellow American,
Yale Prof. Baarghorn.

Now,' Carter has declared
not once but twice that
Shcharansky was not a spy, and
his second disclaimer followed
an investigation to insure that
nothing had been overlooked
before his first statement.
As for Shcharansky giving
me a list of secret defense insti
tutes, it bores me to repeat the
account again, but Ballard
seems to have missed its many
appearances. The Jewish emig
ration activists kept a list of
those Jews who had applied
and been refused exit visas,
where they had worked, when
they were refused, why they
were refused, etc. I wrote a
piece based on some of the
names and details provided by
Shcharansky and others re
garding those refused on sec
recy grounds.
Its purpose was to show that
the Soviets claimed some "re
fuseniks" received their sec
rets at institutes which were
otherwise known as open or
non-secret institutes when the
Soviets wanted to buy high
technology Western equip
ment, like computers, for use
there. I mentioned
Shcharansky by name, and
others, with their approval, so
there was nothing clandestine
about his efforts to show how
fickle Soviet emigration prac
tices were. (Some refuseniks
apparently got their "secrets"
while working as waiters in
Moscow restaurants, as I men
tioned in the article.)
None of the institutes he
cited or I cited were, to my
knowledge, defense plants;
among other things, such
places don't have names, they
have post offic i box numbers.
The unnamed State Depart
ment official quoted by News
week was invited to justify his
statements but he refused to
come forward. It's a cheap shot
to say such things about a guy
in jail who can't defend him
self.
At his trial, which his brother
Leonid attended in its non
secret parts, Shcharansky said:
"My open efforts to produce
information of a non-secret
character, available to all, were
transformed into espionage"
by the Kremlin for its own pur
poses.
Ballard's rephrasing of the
Newsweek article on my ac
tivities is distorted at best. The
basis for the Soviet charge that
I was a military intelligence
agent was a letter I received

from Washington, which the
Soviets photographed or
otherwise copied (I have the
original). Izvestia said an intel
ligence official in Washington,
quoted in the letter, referred to
me as "our best man" in Mos
cow. In fact, the letter said the
official had called me "the best
newspaper reporter" in Mos
cow, and that my dispatches
should be carefully read. (See
Los Angeles Times article, Dec.
7, 1978.)
I don't argue that the evalua
tion of my work was correct,
only that Izvestia grossly dis
torted the words to suit its pur
pose. Ballard risks the same ac
cusation, for not even News
week claimed I'd passed any
information to intelligence
agents. And I was not, contrary
to Ballard's contention, expel
led from the Soviet Union.
Ballard throws in a gratuitous
reference to one Filatov, appa
rently a real spy for the United
States. There was no connec
tion between him and me or
Shcharansky, and Ballard
would have avoided the refer
ence — I hope — if he had read
my letter to Newsweek (Nov.
13, 1978). You have a scoop,
incidentally, if Filatov has in
fact been shot. He was sen
tenced to be shot, but my im
pression is that the Soviets
want to trade him for one of
their real spies here.
I recount all this because it
would be truly sad if Ballard's
letter were to lessen concern
for Shcharansky. Lenin said
that trials in the Soviet Union
were not for the purpose of
dispensing justice but to de
monstrate the overwhelming
power of the party to do its will
and of the uselessness of resist
ing that will. Certainly no jus
tice was done in the trial of
Anatoly Shcharansky.

On-campus rush
As spring approached, the
difficulty in finding an off
campus site for rush became
an issue of importance among
the sororities. Finding a loca
tion in close proximity to the
University with enough rooms
to hold seven sororities and
600 women for three nights
was virtually impossible. It was
compounded by the question
of safety, insurance, transpor
tation and a low budget. Yet,

the sororities learned that
there's a solution to every
problem. The University
played a large role in this les
son.
Sure, we had a difficult time
with the restrictions imposed
butthe women pulled together
and worked towards a com
mon goal. Concerned indi
viduals took it upon them
selves to look for a solution
and within no time, we became
a unified group of women not
viewed as being members of
certain organizations.
The question of off-campus
rush proved to be a learning
experience for both the
sororities and the University.
Sororities discovered that by
uniting their resources, a
strong group effort easily came
about. All barriers came down
as a unique atmosphere of
camaraderie formed in pursu
ing what we believed was vital
to our future and well-being.
The University became aware
of the situation faced by the
women and their earnest at
tempt to comply with the Uni
versity's policies. Fortunately
the effort to locate off-campus
sites did not go unnoticed.
It is our concern as well as
the University's that all women
on campus be informed of the
upcoming events and that all
are welcome to attend. We feel
that it is vital the women come
see for themselves and form
their own opinions on
sororities instead of speculat
ing or referring to hometown
schools.
Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons' decision was not
an easy one apparently but a
significant step in opening
communication channels bet
ween sororities and the ad
ministration. With this clearer
understanding of the Universi
ty's position, we hope that
problems encountered will be
swiftly solved.
