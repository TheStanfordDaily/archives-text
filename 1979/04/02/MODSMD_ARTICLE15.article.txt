## 'Me' generation slights defense 
### 
Students of the late 1970s
have finally found their "Viet
nam" — an ideologically pure
issue separating the good guys
from the bad. I am referring to
the draft, or to use the current
euphemism, national service.
The director of Students fora
Libertarian Society (Daily, Feb.
20) sees "the modern planta
tion owners" (government)
snatching our bodies to serve
in an "American version of the
Hitler Youth." The Daily, in
more measured tones, states
that U.S. Congressman Pete
McCloskey's National Service
Plan will force the nation's
youth "into unthinking par
ticipation in military interven
tion overseas" (Daily, Feb. 5).
A seemingly unrelated arti
cle (Daily, Feb. 5) reported
that, according to a nationwide
survey, "developing a
philosophy of life" and "be
coming an expert in my field"
were the primary objectives of
most of this year's freshmen.
Only half mentioned "helping
others in difficulty," "keeping
up with political affairs" and

"raising a family" as essential
in later life.
Who could contest that fulfil
ling one's human potential and
discovering one's identity,
goals implicit in the first two
statements, are worthy objec
tives for a college freshman?
And yet there is an unsettling
relationship between the tenor
of these articles and the na
tional mood — a mood that ac
centuates personal satisfaction
and disparages public action.
Objectives such as "develop
ing a philosophy of life," how
ever harmless, are inner
directed and self-indulgent.
The less-popular aims (above)
are other-directed and idealis
tic.
Our age group has been
christened the "me" genera
tion and not without good
reason. For many who have
grown up in the Vietnam era,
thecall forpublic sacrifice con
jures up images of former pres
idents Lyndon Johnson and
Richard Nixon sending the
boys, kicking and screaming,
over to the Big Muddy. That

appeal was, of course, a
travesty in light of an arbitrary
and discriminatory mul
tiexemption draft system that
we called universal conscrip
tion.
It is perhaps unrealistic to
expect a generation not yet
weaned from the instant
gratification provided by the
boob tube to heed any call for
personal sacrifice.
I'm not so sure, however,
that inside every human being
there is an overwhelmingly at
tractive personality waiting to
benefit mankind. There is an
unresolvable conflict between
a human being's innate self
ishness and the restraint and
discipline that must be im
posed if a stable society is to be
maintained.
Unfortunately, while our
generation "discovers itself,"
our cities smolder and our
military becomes a sham. We
sadly need social services, but
we cannot afford them at pre
vailing costs of labor. Our
democracy profoundly needs
public spirit, but our social and
economic gurus preach self
interest.
McCloskey's National Ser
vice Plan, however flawed, is a
concrete effort to deal with
these serious societal and
military problems.
(1) The all-volunteer army is
in pathetic shape. Our current
military is a luxury we can no
longer afford; it is deteriorat
ing both in terms of recruits at
tracted and readiness for po
tential conflicts. Despite a peak
number of young people in the
military age group and despite
mushrooming military pay, we
cannot meet our minimum en
listment goals. The American
military machine is not qual
ified to protect the nation's
vital interests in situations
short of nuclear war.
(2) A national service plan
must be universal. Concerned
commentators lament the fact
that the "poor and disadvan
taged" have to fight this na
tion's wars, but are thrown into
fits of apoplexy when our
"youth" (read the sons and
daughters of the upper-middle
class) are "forced into unthink
ing participation in military in
tervention overseas." But
there is even less to prevent a
voluntary (mercenary) force

from becoming involved in
such endeavors. The Western
nations we often consider the
most peaceable, for example
the Scandanavian countries,
Holland and Switzerland, have
universal conscription.
The recent libertarian col
umn states that it is better to
have a "system that disrupts
the lives of a few, rather than
one which affects an entire
segment of society." But which
few? The poor, minorities and
working-class whites!
Today's teenager, whether
from Scarsdale, South San
Francisco or Harlem, has seen
little of the "other half." His or
her only exposure to integ
rated groups is often through
the vicarious medium of com
mercial television where per
fectly polyglot groups live out
their sanitized existences. Na
tional service would provide
contact among youth from all
segments of society before
prejudices and stereotypes be
come crystallized.
And finally, is it not possible
that if the sons of congressmen
had been serving in the milit
ary, the U.S. legislature might
have given a little more
forethought to our Vietnam
commitment?
(3) The government must
remain accountable. I recog
nize that the term National
Service conjures up images of
Hitler Youth or Komsomol
Cadets marching off to the dic
tates of a totalitarian govern
ment. There is no better
guarantee, however, that our
government will remain ac
countable than a concerned
and involved youth. A national
service plan will help foster
such involvement.
We are told that the draft will
take away our rights. We want
to be protected from govern
ment, and we want to be pro
tected by government. We
demand more social services,
we demand to be number one
militarily and we demand
lower taxes. We can't have all.
National service offers no
panacea. But it does affirm that
rights and responsibility are
not mutually exclusive. The
idea merits serious and im
aginative consideration.

A seemingly unrelated arti
cle (Daily, Feb. 5) reported
that, according to a nationwide
survey, "developing a
philosophy of life" and "be
coming an expert in my field"
were the primary objectives of
most of this year's freshmen.
Only half mentioned "helping
others in difficulty," "keeping
up with political affairs" and

"raising a family" as essential
in later life.
Who could contest that fulfil
ling one's human potential and
discovering one's identity,
goals implicit in the first two
statements, are worthy objec
tives for a college freshman?
And yet there is an unsettling
relationship between the tenor
of these articles and the na
tional mood — a mood that ac
centuates personal satisfaction
and disparages public action.
Objectives such as "develop
ing a philosophy of life," how
ever harmless, are inner
directed and self-indulgent.
The less-popular aims (above)
are other-directed and idealis
tic.
Our age group has been
christened the "me" genera
tion and not without good
reason. For many who have
grown up in the Vietnam era,
thecall forpublic sacrifice con
jures up images of former pres
idents Lyndon Johnson and
Richard Nixon sending the
boys, kicking and screaming,
over to the Big Muddy. That

appeal was, of course, a
travesty in light of an arbitrary
and discriminatory mul
tiexemption draft system that
we called universal conscrip
tion.
It is perhaps unrealistic to
expect a generation not yet
weaned from the instant
gratification provided by the
boob tube to heed any call for
personal sacrifice.
I'm not so sure, however,
that inside every human being
there is an overwhelmingly at
tractive personality waiting to
benefit mankind. There is an
unresolvable conflict between
a human being's innate self
ishness and the restraint and
discipline that must be im
posed if a stable society is to be
maintained.
Unfortunately, while our
generation "discovers itself,"
our cities smolder and our
military becomes a sham. We
sadly need social services, but
we cannot afford them at pre
vailing costs of labor. Our
democracy profoundly needs
public spirit, but our social and
economic gurus preach self
interest.
McCloskey's National Ser
vice Plan, however flawed, is a
concrete effort to deal with
these serious societal and
military problems.
(1) The all-volunteer army is
in pathetic shape. Our current
military is a luxury we can no
longer afford; it is deteriorat
ing both in terms of recruits at
tracted and readiness for po
tential conflicts. Despite a peak
number of young people in the
military age group and despite
mushrooming military pay, we
cannot meet our minimum en
listment goals. The American
military machine is not qual
ified to protect the nation's
vital interests in situations
short of nuclear war.
(2) A national service plan
must be universal. Concerned
commentators lament the fact
that the "poor and disadvan
taged" have to fight this na
tion's wars, but are thrown into
fits of apoplexy when our
"youth" (read the sons and
daughters of the upper-middle
class) are "forced into unthink
ing participation in military in
tervention overseas." But
there is even less to prevent a
voluntary (mercenary) force

from becoming involved in
such endeavors. The Western
nations we often consider the
most peaceable, for example
the Scandanavian countries,
Holland and Switzerland, have
universal conscription.
The recent libertarian col
umn states that it is better to
have a "system that disrupts
the lives of a few, rather than
one which affects an entire
segment of society." But which
few? The poor, minorities and
working-class whites!
Today's teenager, whether
from Scarsdale, South San
Francisco or Harlem, has seen
little of the "other half." His or
her only exposure to integ
rated groups is often through
the vicarious medium of com
mercial television where per
fectly polyglot groups live out
their sanitized existences. Na
tional service would provide
contact among youth from all
segments of society before
prejudices and stereotypes be
come crystallized.
And finally, is it not possible
that if the sons of congressmen
had been serving in the milit
ary, the U.S. legislature might
have given a little more
forethought to our Vietnam
commitment?
(3) The government must
remain accountable. I recog
nize that the term National
Service conjures up images of
Hitler Youth or Komsomol
Cadets marching off to the dic
tates of a totalitarian govern
ment. There is no better
guarantee, however, that our
government will remain ac
countable than a concerned
and involved youth. A national
service plan will help foster
such involvement.
We are told that the draft will
take away our rights. We want
to be protected from govern
ment, and we want to be pro
tected by government. We
demand more social services,
we demand to be number one
militarily and we demand
lower taxes. We can't have all.
National service offers no
panacea. But it does affirm that
rights and responsibility are
not mutually exclusive. The
idea merits serious and im
aginative consideration.
