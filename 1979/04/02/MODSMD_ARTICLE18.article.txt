# Tracksters bow honorably to UCLA

Darrin Nelson's torn left hamstring
tendon (see page one for story), horri
ble as it was, nevertheless typified Stan
ford's effort in Saturday's track and
field meet against UCLA.
Nelson was injured while trying to
improve his winning long jump of
25-4'/j. The rest of the Cardinals per
formed with similar competitiveness,
and though the host Bruins defeated
Stanford, 103-51, the score hardly re
vealed the meet's intensity.
The Cards actually held a five-point
lead at the time of Nelson's injury, but
that untimely event began Stanford's
downfall. Nelson was thus unable to
compete in the 100 and 200-meter
dashes, and as coach Payton Jordan
explained, "It takes you out of the meet
when you can't have your key
sprinter."
Yet the Cards fought hard, as evi
denced by the several close races that
occurred.
Bill Gail finished second to UCLA's
Roger Watkin by less than half a second
in the 3000-meter steeplechase, 9:00.13
to 9:00.61.
Gordon Banks twice was edged at the
tape, losing the 400-meter dash by just
.04 and the 200 by .95. Stanford's 400-
meter relay team also finished a frus
tratingly close second, with only .64
separating the two quartets.
Stanford had a small but distin
guished group of winners. Freshman
Gary Bruner began the afternoon on a
promising note by capturing the javelin
throw with a lifetime-best 235-3. John
Schaer, another freshman, ran the 800
meters in a lifetime-best 1:50.90 to take
that event.

Tom Lobsinger led the always
effective brigade of distance runners,
breaking the tape in the 1500-meter run
in 3:49.58, and Roy Kissin paced a Card
sweep in the 5000 meters with a 14:41
clocking.
Spartans win relays
Two new entries were written into
the Stanford Stadium track and field
history books at the fifth annual Stan
ford Invitational Relays on March 24.
Excellence and excitement typified
the competition which was won by San
Jose State for the second straight year.
Mighty in the field and fleet on the
oval, the Spartans amassed 63Vi points.
Second place went to California, thanks
to a strong finish — the Bears picked up
37 of their 61 points in the last five
events. Stanford finished a respectable
third with 48 points.
The day's highlights, however, were
the new Stanford Stadium (and meet)
records set by Nelson in the 100-meter
dash and SJS' Greg Woepse in the pole
vault.
Nelson burns
Nelson, who has electrified
thousands with his amazing gridiron
exploits, displayed his wizardry on the
tartan track by winning the 100 with a
lifetime best 10.3.
Nelson's time shaded the old
Stadium mark of 10.4 set in 1960 by Kan
sas' Charlie Tidwell and Santa Clara Val
ley Youth Village's Ray Norton.
Running against others who had
clocked better times than his previous
best of 10.5, Nelson didn't think much
of his own chances for victory. "I was
hoping for a good showing, maybe a
lifetime best," he said.
Another obstacle in Nelson's way was

a swollen right heel he had suffered
during some wrestling horseplay.
Yet once the race began, the fun and
games resumed for Nelson, who grab
bed an early lead and never relin
quished it.
Even Jordan, who has witnessed
many outstanding4eats in over four de
cades of track, was moved by Nelson's
triumph. "To see a kid compete so well,
run a lifetime best and win is exciting,"
said Jordan.
Woepse soars
Woepse, who likes to vault in Stan
ford Stadium — "It has a great runway
and a nice pit," he said — bettered his
own meet and Stadium record of 17-O'A
set in 1977 with a 17-7 on his second try
at that height.
The red-bearded senior later attemp
ted three times to clear 18-I'/j, but
failed on each occasion, lacking help
from the elements.
"I was looking for a tailwind, and I
didn't get it," Woepse explained.
"Fatigue didn't set in at all."
Kissin qualifies
Kissin came through with a fine
29:33.2 in the 10,000-meter run, hold
ing off Sacramento State's Jim White
(29:38.6). Both qualified for the NCAA
championships with their efforts, and
Kissin's clocking established a new
meet record.
"I felt I could have run faster," Kissin
said, going on toexplain his strategyfor
the race. "I just wanted to stay on the
pace, and I decided to let everybody
else do what they wanted to do. It's
such a long race, any little extrava
gances can really affect you later."
Gail's meet-record 8:54.8 in the
3000-meter steeplechase gave Stanford

another winner. Teammate Bill Halde
man took third in the same race with a
9:09.2.
The only other first-place finish for
the Cards was turned in by the 880-yard
relay team of Nelson, Ken Margerum,
Rick Gervais and Banks, which blazed
the distance in 1:24.9.
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo had appa
rently won the race, but was disqual
ified for a lane violation.
The same Card quartet (with Banks
and Gervais switching legs) placed third
in the 400-meter relay with a 40.3, slic
ing .5 off its previously best 1979 time.
Other Card scorers included Bruner,
second in the javelin with a 227-11;
Dave Thomson, second in the hammer
with a 183-3; Rick Buss, whose 172-4
hammer throw was a lifetime best and
good for fifth; and the distance medley
relay team of Schaer, Banks, Mark
Stillman and Lobsinger, which finished
fifth with a 9:52.4.
"This was one heck of a good track
meet," Jordan summed, "and I'm very
pleased with our team showing."
Cards beat Hayward
A week before the relays, Stanford
turned in a 92-71 victory over host Hay
ward State. Nelson won three events:
the 100 (10.7), the 200 (21.3) and the
long jump (23-8). Margerum was also
impressive, taking both the 110 high
and 400 intermediate hurdles in 14.9
and 54.7, respectively.
Gail ran a 9:22.8 to take the 3000-
meter steeplechase, and fellow dis
tance man Kissin won the 1500 in 3:50.8.
Card field event victors included
Bruner in the javelin, Buss in the discus
and Thomson in the hammer.
