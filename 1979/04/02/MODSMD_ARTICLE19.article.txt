# League foes foil Card nine
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
While you were sunning in
Hawaii, seeing your friends
back home or just sitting
around relaxing this spring
break, Stanford's baseball
team was spending the week
on the road, working out
against non-league opponents
and preparing for a tough
league competitor, UCLA.
Despite their efforts, the
Cardinals came home with
only three victories in eight
games. The three wins in
cluded only one in the three
game series against the UCLA
Bruins with whom they con
cluded their road trip on Friday
and Saturday.
Stanford remains in the cel
lar of the Pacific-10 Southern
Division with a 3-8 record near
ing the halfway point in the
30-game league season.
The team has met every
league opponent except
cross-bay rival Cal, and has re
corded one win against the
University of Arizona, Arizona

State and UCLA, and none
against USC.
The Cards will meet Cal this
coming weekend for three
games. Friday's game will be
held at Berkeley beginning at
2:30 p.m. Saturday the doub
leheader will be played at Stan
ford's Sunken Diamond be
ginning at noon.
UCLA on top
Taking two of the three
games from the Cardinals,
UCLA held on to a first-place
tie with Cal in the Southern Di
vision of the Pac-10. The Bruins
and the Bears each have 7-3 re
cords with rain-out games yet
to be made up.
Playing in a cold, damp Saw
telle Field Friday afternoon, the
Cards were kept on ice by the
Bruinsuntil the last two innings
of the contest. UCLA ace right
hander Tim Leary held Stan
ford scoreless through seven
innings of play.
In the eighth inning Stanford
scored twice — two runs that

would go unearned in the
scorebook. With one out, Paul
Zuvella reached first on an
error by the Bruin third base
man. Phil Wilson followed
/uvella with a walk and set the
stage for a two-run double by
)ohn Pyle.
UCLA retaliated with one run
in the bottom of that inning
and Stanford went into the
ninth trailing 6-2.
Another error on UCLA's
third baseman gave Stanford
its last run of the game before
Bruin reliever Scott Bollens re
corded the final out.
UCLA's 12-hit attack was
highlighted by two home runs
by Bruin catcher Don Slaught.
Slaught hammered a two-run
homer over the right-field fence
in the fourth inning and lifted
his second for the day over the
left field fence in the sixth.
Fiala wins
Bruce Fiala, senior right
hander and three-year letter
man on the Cardinal pitching
staff, earned his seventh vic
tory of the season and the 24th
of his career in the first game of
Saturday's twin bill.
Fiala's 24 wins move him into
a tie with Ray Young and Don
Shaw for most wins in a
pitcher's career in Stanford
baseball history.
Fiala lasted eight and two
thirds innings, allowing seven
runs on 11 hits enroute to the
9-7 win.
Stanford maintained a com
fortable lead throughout the
game after jumping out to a 3-0
lead in the first two innings.
The Cards' offensive effort

was headed by second base
man /uvella, who had three
hits in four trips to the plate
and collected three RBI.
Larry Reynolds added his
two cents worth to the effort,
slugging his first home run of
the year — a lead-off solo shot
in the eighth inning.
Stanford turned back the
threatening Bruins in the fifth
inning. Leading by only one
run, 3-2, the Cards went to
work in their half of the fifth.
Mike Codiroli led off with a
single to left and scored from
first when the Bruin right-fiel
der misplaced Wilson's single.
Zuvella then singled Wilson
home from second. Once on
base, /uvella promptly stole
second and moved to third on
a single by Loring Davies. Mike
Zboralske scored Zuvella with
an RBI single for the third run
of the inning.
UCLA could only muster one
run in the bottom of the inning
and Stanford later repulsed
two more Bruin scoring threats
to preserve the win.
Saturday's second game was
a rout. Bruin Vern Followell's
two doubles and Mark Miller's
two singles highlighted a 10-hit
sixth inning that yielded nine
runs for the Bruins and spelled
doom for the Cardinals.
Followell went four-for-four
and Miller went four-for-five in
that second game and the two
of them were credited with
eight of UCLA's RBI.
Bruin starting pitcher Dave
Schmidt collected his sixth win
of the year for the Bruins
against no losses.
