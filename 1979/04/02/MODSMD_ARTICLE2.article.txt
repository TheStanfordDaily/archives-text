# Jury concludes Streleski guilty
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
Theodore Streleski, a 42-year-old
former doctoral candidate in
mathematics here, has been found
guilty of second-degree murder in
the killing of Mathematics Prof. Karel
deLeeuw.
A Santa Clara County Superior
Court jury handed down the verdict
Friday after two weeks of testimony,
lurofs said after the trial that reason
able doubt about Streleski's mental
state resulted in their finding him
guilty of second-degree murder
rather than first-degree. First-degree
murder implies a deliberate, pre
meditated killing with malice
aforethought.
DeLeeuw was found dead in his
office last Aug. 18, and Streleski
turned himself in early the next
morning at the North County jail in
Palo Alto.
During the trial, testimony was first
given by Santa Clara County Assis
tant Medical Examiner-Coroner Dr.
Chan Lee, who said deLeeuw's death
was caused by at least three blows to
the head with "a blunt instrument,
hammer or hammer-type."
Sheriff's Deputy Pedro Contreras
and Palo Alto policeman Dave Hen
nessy testified that at 3:20 a.m. on
Aug. 19, Streleski entered the North
County jail and told them about "a
seriously injured or dead man" on
the Stanford campus.
Confession
According to Contreras, Streleski
said, "I hit him over the head with a
hammer. It's in that bag over there.
There's some blood on it."
Testimony revealed that de-
Leeuw's body was found with a gar
bage bag pulled over his head and
shoulders, and on his office door was
taped an index card saying, "No of
fice hours today â€” family
emergency. 8-18-78."
Deputy District Attorney Alan

Nudelman later produced a witness
who testified that a portable Royal
typewriter taken during a warrant
search of Streleski's San Francisco
apartment produced the typing on
the note.
Streleski's defense
According to published reports of
the trial, attorney James Blackman's
defense of Streleski dealt with "the
why of the killing." Blackman said
during the trial he would present no
evidence suggesting that Streleski
did not kill deLeeuw, but rather why
Streleski "thought this killing done
with this hammer was a proper and
fair thing to do."
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Halsey Royden, who served as
Streleski's informal adviser, testified
that Streleski told him during the
1976-77 school year "he didn't think
he'd been treated well by Stanford."
justification for murder?
Streleski himself testified that the
killing was meant to be a statement to
the University, which he felt had de
layed his progress towards a docto
rate.
Streleski came to Stanford from Il
linois in 1959. He has been working
intermittently on his thesis since that
time. He testified that his moving
through a series of jobs and the disin
tegration of his seven-year marriage
in the 1970s was a direct consequ
ence of "the differences I'd had with
the (mathematics) department and
with deLeeuw in particular."
\ Streleski said he considered filing
a civil suit for the "damage" done to
his life by "the parochial arrogance
of the professors at Stanford" but
decided to kill somebody instead as a
statement to the University.
Public record
"I wanted, through a murder trial,
to be able to read things into the pub
lic record and to get Stanford profes
sors sitting in this same chair.
They've never been in such a situa

tion in their lives," Streleski said.
Streleski said he chose deLeeuw
because the professor had "been
pointed in his responses to me. He
was the one I thought had the most
consequences, the most effect, on
me."
Royden said in his testimony that
four days before the killing, he had
returned to Streleski a draft of his
doctoral thesis with suggested
changes that might take up to a year
to make.
Royden said yesterday that at the
time, Streleski did not seem to be
outwardly upset and that everything
"seemed normal."
Persecution complex
Palo Alto psychiatrist lames Mis
sett testified that frustration built up
until Streleski became a paranoid
psychotic with a persecution com
plex. Because of this delusion of per
secution, Missett said, Streleski was
unable to deliberate the nature and
consequences of his act sufficiently
to support a first-degree murder
conviction.
Sentencing for Streleski has been
set for 9 a.m. April 20.
