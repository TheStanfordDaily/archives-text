After only two years of var
sity status, Stanford's women
gymnasts have made their ini
tial entry into the national re
cord books.
Paced by two freshmen and
considered potentially a team
threat next season with the
current squad and strong re
cruiting, the Cardinals' AIAW
appearance is only the first of
many.

west Missouri took first with a
37.35 total. Barbie Myslak of

event with marks of 19.150 and
18.600. Takimoto had a fall dur
ing the final competition, a de

close field.
With his experience of two
previous NCAA showings,
Takimoto has a good chance of
attaining All-America status in
the Baton Rouge, La. national
finals.
