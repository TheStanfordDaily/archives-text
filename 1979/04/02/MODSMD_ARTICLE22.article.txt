Women booters tie

sports results, especially after
an hour and a half soccer
match, is a tie. With the Stan
ford and University of North

Gioia evened up the score for

fourth in the 200 IM.
)o Clark was a double winner
for Stanford, capturing the 500
free in 4:48.31 and the 1650 free

vidual performance was turned
in by Noel Moran, who earned

second-place honors in the 100
and 200 breaststroke events
and the 200 IM.
Stanford's 200 medley relay
team of Jezek, Moran, Libby
Beaudet and Kim Peyton estab

1:44.86. That same group also
took the 400 medley relay in
3:46.89.
Bruner, Franklin shine
Meanwhile, the Cards' men
swimmers finished the NCAA
Swimming and Diving Champ
ionships at Cleveland, Ohio,
March 22-24 with 23 points, far

ford.

Chaparral High in Scottsdale,
Ariz., holds the no. 19 ranking
in the 1978 USTA Girls 18 field,
with just four other preps listed
above her.
"CSryn comes to Stanford as
our top prospect this year,"
said women's coach Anne
Gould. "She is one of the lead
ing young players in the coun
try with a great deal of poten
tial. She will make an im
mediate impact on our team."

men's tennis team were named
