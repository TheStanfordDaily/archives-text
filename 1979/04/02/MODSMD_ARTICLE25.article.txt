Iranians vote in Islamic republic
Tehran, Iran — Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
triumphantly proclaimed Iran an Islamic republic
yesterday, announcing that the "yes" votes of mill
ions of Iranians in a referendum had created the
nation's first "government of God."
The 78-year-old Shiite Moslem leader, who led
the struggle that toppled Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi's regime in mid-February, said his coun
trymen had voted "to establish a government of
righteousness and to overthrow and bury the
monarchy in the garbage can of history."
Khomeini's victory statement, read by an an
nouncer over Tehran radio, contrasted with con
tinued concern by the revolutionary authorities
over unrest among the nation's large ethnic minor
ity groups.
Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, head of the
Khomeini-appointed provisional government,
warned rebellious Turkoman tribesmen in the
north-eastern city of Gonbad-e-Qabous yesterday
that if the bloody week-old fighting there did not
cease he would send in government troops tomor
row morning to restore order.
Venezuelan oil upped 18 percent
Caracas, Venezuela — Venezuela, a key U.S. oil
supplier, increased the price of its crude oil ex
ports an average of 18 percent yesterday and said it
may soon charge a premium for "security of sup
ply."
The increase includes the nine percent au
thorized last week by the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries plus a surcharge of
$1.20 a barrel for light and medium crudes and 70
cents for heavy crudes.
That decision, reached in Geneva last Tuesday,
also allowed OPEC members to impose an unre
stricted surcharge. When the OPEC decision was

announced, Libya, Algeria and Venezuela im
mediately said they would add surcharges.
The OPEC increases, which took effect yester
day, are expected to raise American retail gasoline
prices by about two cents a gallon and increase the
American bill for foreign oil by at least $4 billion
above last year's total of $43 billion.
Surcharges, such as those being imposed by
Venezuela, could push the bill much higher,
analysts say.
Trucking industry shuts down
Washington — The trucking industry declared a
nationwide shutdown yesterday against 300,000
Teamsters after the union launched strikes against
75 companies in the wake of a collapse in
marathon contract talks.
The executive committee of Trucking Manage
ment Inc., the industry's bargaining arm, said in a
statement it "had no alternative but to instruct its
member associations and authorizing carriers to
shut down their operations in defense against the
strike."
Industry's decision to counter by shutting down
presumably would make it easier for the Carter
administration to obtain a back-to-work order
under the Taft-Hartley Act.
The strikes and walkout followed a breaking off
of contract talks between the two sides late Satur
day. The union's old contract expired at midnight
Saturday. No further negotiations are expected for
several days.
United lays off flight crews
Chicago — United Airlines said yesterday that it
was laying off a total of 13,300 pilots, attendants
and other crew members because of the strike that
has grounded all its daily flights.
United, the nation's largest carrier, said the
layoffs would begin at midnight yesterday and
would remain in effect for the duration of the
strike by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The strike
began at midnight Friday.
The workers to be laid off included 7800 flight
attendants and a total of 5500 pilots, copilots and
navigators, he said.

Meanwhile, negotiators trying to settle the
strike said yesterday they were having trouble get
ting to Washington for talks — because the strike
is clogging other airlines' flights with extra pas
sengers.
United serves 110 cities and carries about
130,000 passengers daily. A spokesman said opera
tions will be canceled at least until April 10.
Passman cleared in bribery trial
Monroe, La. — Former Congressman Otto
Passman was found innocent yesterday on all
counts of accepting illegal gratuities from South
Korean rice dealer Tongsun Park and charges of
tax evasion and conspiracy.
"It's perfectly obvious that I am extremely
pleased," said the ailing 78-year-old former con
gressman, who was described by his attorney as
"an unknowing victim of an evil Korean conspi
racy."
Passman faced charges of taking as much as
$213,000 in illegal gratuities from Park and with
failing to pay federal income taxes on much of the
money.
Radiant Hearst weds 'young fool'
San Francisco — A radiant Patricia Campbell
Hearst, kidnap victim turned bank robber, mar
ried her former bodyguard yesterday at an eleg
ant, traditional wedding witnessed by the wealthy
and the powerful.
Friends said the new bride, just two months out
of federal prison, would call herself Patricia Hearst
Shaw. Her husband, San Francisco policeman
Bernard Shaw, met her 2Vi years ago while moon
lighting as her bodyguard, and wooed her while
she was behind bars.
"We're just £ couple of young fools in love,"
Shaw said of their decision to marry on April Fool's
Day.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Highs in 60s to low 70s,
lows in 40s and low 50s.
