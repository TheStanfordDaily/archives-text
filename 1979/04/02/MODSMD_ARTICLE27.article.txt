# Investigation begins in Pizza Express theft
## 
### 
An investigation into possible stu
dent involvement in a March 17 rob
bery and assault of a Pizza Express
delivery woman will begin this week,
according to Norman Robinson, as
sociate dean for residential educa
tion.
About 2 a.m. on the 17th, the de
livery woman was attempting to de
liver a pizza to Synergy House when
she encountered a man coming from
the side of the parking lot near the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity. After try
ing to get the pizza from her, another
man approached her from behind
and in the ensuing scuffle, the pizza
was stolen, the woman's shirt was
ripped and she suffered a black eye,
according to Police Services and
Pizza Express employee Noah Mesel.
The woman did not file charges,
but she did describe the men as
"well-built, big and strong," accord
ing to Michael Bever, director of the
Row.
Bever said police were unable to
find anyone in either Synergy or the
Delts who had ordered the pizza, in
dicating the robbery was possibly
planned.
No deliveries
In addition, Mesel said Pizza Ex
press will not deliver to the Delt
House because they have been "rip
ped off" in the past. "It was the own
er's decision not to deliver to them
(the Delts) until they paid thedebton
the pizzas they had ripped off,"
Mesel said.
The location, description and cir
cumstances tend to implicate mem
bers of the Delt House circumstan
tially, Bever said, but "I feel very un
comfortable saying it is a Delt prob
lem" with the evidence we have
now.
"There's no real proof — no more
than someone's speculation that it

was someone at the Delt House,"
Bever said. "The description fits the
stereotype of what a Delt is, (but) it is
all circumstantial inference that the
people involved are Delts."
Previous suspensions
The Delts have been suspended
from campus twice this decade for
misbehavior, the latest incident oc
curring three years ago when a
dozen Delts plus friends trashed the
Beta Theta Pi house and other frater
nities following a bachelor party for
one of their members.
Following that incident, some in
dividuals involved were suspended
from the University. Others were
fined, and the house was suspended
from campus for three years.
The suspension was commuted
one year laterwhen Robinson said he
felt the organization had been
punished enough.
Delt President Chuck Evans said
yesterday he felt the whole incident
was being "blown out of proportion"
and that he planned to look into it
himself this week.
Concerned about image
Bever said he expected complete
cooperation from the Delts because
"the Delt leadership has been really
good about dealing with people who
get'out of line. They've been very
concerned about their image.
"I'm giving them (the Delts) the
benefit of the doubt, as I feel anyone
should," Bever said. He speculated
that there could be several explana
tions for the incident.
Robinson said, "The annoying
thing about it to me is the ethics of
the thing. The whole idea of ordering
a pizza under a false name with the
intent of stealing really bothers me.
"It hardly sounds like reasonable
behavior for someone who's sup
posed to have a brain," he said.
