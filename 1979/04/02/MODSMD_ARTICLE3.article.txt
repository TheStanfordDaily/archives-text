Peter Stamos announced his res
ignation as ASSU Senate chairperson
at the senate's Dead Week meeting
March 15. He asked the senate for a
2'/2-month leave of absence to pur
sue an internship in Washington,
D.C. In his "State of the Senate" ad
dress, Stamos said that he was "sad
to leave you but hopeful for the fu
ture."
Graduate senator George Drysdale
resigned as deputy chairperson after
being informed that he would be
come acting chairperson. The senate
will, therefore, hold a special meet
ing tomorrow night at 6:30 to elect
new chairpeople and to discuss un
finished business. So far, lack
Trumpbour, Ron lohnson, Erik
Thompson and Duncan Evered have
been nominated to fill the vacant
chair position, but nominations are
still open.
The meeting opened with special
orders of the day to consider the
guest professorship offer to native
American leader Dennis Banks and
to issue a senate statement officially
opposing mandatory conscription.
After a brief presentation by
SWOPSI co-director Lisa Foster and
subsequent debate, the senators
voted 9-5 to extend the guest profes
sorship to Banks, who will now teach
a course on the American Indian this
quarter. The senate also approved a
$2000 salary grant for Banks.
The senate unanimously passed a
bill expressing disapproval of a na
tional system of conscription, and
also passed a resolution to place the
same question before the student
community on the Spring Quarter
ballot.

Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall urged the senate to take such a
stand. "I for one am going to oppose
conscription in any reasonable way I
can and I hope you will too," he said.
He cited the draft as a "grave infring
ement" on personal liberties, a very
costly policy because its budget does
not account for the earnings
foregone by draftees and an un
workable strategy at this point in
American history. "There is no war
and no purpose, and people have
lost confidence in their govern
ment," he affirmed. "Don't give

Washington an army to play with,"
Marshall concluded.
Sen. Bill Nussbaum said that the
senate bill against the draft "will go
to Capitol Hill," where debate on
conscription has recently begun. "If
we want to have an impact and to
serve as catalysts for other univer
sities, it is important for us to act
now," he said. Lisa Hogeland of the
Students Against Draft (SAD) re
ported that partial results of a cam
pus survey indicated that "the stu
dent body is overwhelmingly against
the draft system."

In other business, the senate ap
proved all proffered fee assessment
presentations for the Spring Quarter
ballot and a complex program fee al
location schedule compiled by Sen.
Ted Gardenswartz' finance commit
tee for myriad campus organizations.
The senate delayed deliberation
on the rules committee's election re
form proposal until more complete
discussion tomorrow night.
Graduate student Jon Siegel heatedly
decried the committee's recom
mendations for staggered, 30-
member elections.
