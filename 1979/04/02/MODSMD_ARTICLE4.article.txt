# Faculty Senate debates retirement laws
## 
### Rachel Bagby 
At its last meeting on March 15, the
Faculty Senate had an emotional dis
cussion concerning proposed treat
ment of professors who will reach
mandatory retirement at age 65 bet
ween now and 1982. A total of 67 fa
culty are in the affected group.
An administrative panel on retire
ment recommended that the Univer
sity take advantage of state and fed
eral retirement laws which allow
policies of mandatory retirement at
age 65 to remain in effect until June
30, 1982. The panel also recom
mended that current policy which al
lows the University to immediately

rehire some professors at its discre
tion be continued.
Prof. Theodore Anderson, a
member of the panel, dissented from
this recommendation, saying that
this policy discriminates against te
nured faculty. "The University can af
ford to be generous to a small
number of faculty," Anderson told
the Senate.
Prof. Bernard Roth, head of the
Stanford chapter of the American As
sociation of University Professors
(ASSUP), said that the University's at
titude toward those affected by the
recommendation was "a horror
story." He sharply criticized the ad

ministration for not consulting the
professors and for refusing to help
the ASSUP organize a meeting of the
67 faculty members.
Of 20 such professors who met on
March 13 to discuss the problem,
more than three-fourths were "very
prominent figures, leaders in their
department and field," said Roth,
adding that "it's not reasonable to
dump professors simply because
they reach a magic age."
No "legitimate expectation"
Law School Dean Charles Meyers,
however, said that the panel's re
commendations were "correct." The
professors affected had no "legiti
mate expectation" of working
beyond age 65 before recent retire
ment legislation was passed. Federal
regulations prohibit mandatory re
tirement before age 70 while Califor
nia law imposes no limit. Stanford
will be bound to California law, and
therefore there will be no limit in re
tirement age.
Meyers contended that for every
professor kept on indefinitely, about
twice as many younger faculty would
be denied employment oppor
tunities.
But it is not clear that professors
will stay on forever, according to
Prof. Clifford Barnett, chairman of
the anthropology department. "No
one knows what the attitudes of

those over 65 are," he said.
Student evaluations
Recommendations for implement
ing universal course evaluation by
students were presented to the Se
nate and unanimously accepted with
amendments.
The Subcommittee on the Evalua
tion and Improvement of Teaching
(SCEIT), responsible for formulating
the recommendations, suggested
the use of an evaluation form it de
veloped in those schools where no
adequate alternative exists. This
form allows students to give instruc
tors both quantitative ratings and
qualitative comments.
Student evaluations are regarded
as a means of improving teaching.
But they won't be.useful unless they
are taken seriously by students,
stressed SCEIT chairman, Prof.
Robert Calfee, associate dean of
education. "This is not going to work
without the support of students and
the help of faculty," he said.
In its report to the Senate, SCEIT
said that the evaluations will be use
ful "for administrative decisions re
garding new faculty appointments,
advancement, pay and tenure."
Lyman emphasized, however, that
promotions and tenure decisions
won't rest solely on student evalua
tions. "I don't trust (student) evalua
tion that far," he said.
