# Nelson suffers hamstring injury

Darrin Nelson, Stanford football and track star, un
derwent surgery yesterday afternoon at Stanford
Hospital for a torn hamstring tendon.
Nelson ruptured the biceps tendon in his left leg
while competing in the long jump in Saturday's
Stanford-UCLA track meet at Los Angeles.
According to Dr. Fred Behling, Stanford's team
physician, the injury occurred when Nelson left the
long jump takeoff board. The 5-foot-9, 175-pound
sophomore from Los Angeles had already won the
event with a 25-4 Vi leap and was attempting to im
prove his mark.
"He apparently took off a little differently," Behling
said. "He felt it in the air."
Behling performed the IV2 hour operation and
termed it a success. "The problem is corrected," he
said optimistically. "We have every reason to believe
that he will return at full speed by the fall. With
Damn's obvious ability to develop muscle strength,
and the type of personality and dedication he has, we
expect him to be at tull go for the 1979 football sea
son."
The orthopedic surgeon remarked on the unique
ness of Nelson's injury. "I've never seen this injury

happen in the long jump," said Behling. "Darrin just
pulled the tendon apart. He's got that much
strength."
Nelson will remain in the hospital for approxi
mately five days, and will wear a cast for six weeks
before beginning a rehabilitation process including
whirlpool treatments, weightlifting and ultimately
running.
Nelson's coaches were understandably worried
about him. "I'm concerned for Darrin and his well
being," said head football coach Rod Dowhower,
who recruited Nelson.
"I'm very, very saddened," track coach Payton Jor
dan said. ' It's certainly a tragic thing to have happen
to such a great kid."
Dowhower, sounding somewhat forlorn, shared
Behling's hope for Nelson's recovery. "I think that
from what Dr. Behling has said, there is reason to be
optimistic," said the coach. "As far as Darrin himself
is concerned, he's quite a competitor, and I feel that
this gives him a good chance of recovering."
Dowhower has no intention of rushing Nelson's
rehabilitation. "As I told him before the operation,
take it one day at a time," said Dowhower. "As long as
he does that he'll be fine."
