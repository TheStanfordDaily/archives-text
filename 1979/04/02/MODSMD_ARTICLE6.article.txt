# Women confused by natural childbirth controversies
## 
### Barbara Schoetzau 
The biological act of repro
duction entered the realm of
controversy in the 19705.
Childbirth is now divided into
philosophies, methods and
techniques, and many con
temporary women have been
"Lamazed," "Leboyered" and
"La Leched" to the point of
confusion.
Natural childbirth is respon
sible for the controversies
which have erupted these last
few years. Its philosophy is
based on the belief that a
mother should take an active
part in the delivery of her baby
and that the use of anesthesia
should be limited. Extreme
proponents of natural
childbirth contend that if any
drugs are used to assist deliv
ery, the birth is not natural.

One of the most popular
methods of natural childbirth,
Lamaze, teaches women to use
breathing techniques and
mental activities to block pain.
It also emphasizes the father's
participation throughout the
pregnancy.
The heart of the natural
childbirth controversy is

whether or not drugs should
be used rather than this
"natural anesthesia." Palo Alto
resident Suzanne Arms said
she believes that pain has a
function in pregnancy and that
drug usage is potentially
dangerous in every birth. In
her book, Immaculate Decep

tion, Arms contends that
women have lost control over
the entire birthing process.
She says that the birth process
"was designed well. Stress has
significance."
Healthy trend?
Arms admits that much of
the pressure not to use drugs is
coming from peers but she
adds that in this case, the re
sulting trend is healthy, since it
encourages women to think
about the process and make a
personal choice.
Sophomore Toby Maurer,
however, thinks the trendiness
may be preventing many
young women from exercising
that very choice. Maurer said
her friends were "outraged"
when she told them that her
sister, Trudy Kaminsky, was
not having natural childbirth.

Speaking of social peer pres
sure, Maurer says:"I resent it.
It's so damned trendy. Pain is
not a beautiful experience."
Kaminsky agrees. She said
she never considered natural
childbirth and believes that, at
33, she is beyond being influ
enced by friends. But she has
seen it happen to younger
women.
'In vogue'
"Natural childbirth is very
much in vogue," Kaminsky
explained. "The woman next
to me in the hospital was in
labor for 24 hours. She almost
went out of her mind. The con
sensus of women on my floor
— several had had natural
childbirth in the past — was
that it is not the glorious ex
perience it is made out to be.
Women glorify it afterwards.
Vou forget the pain."
Kaminsky said she is not op
posed to the natural childbirth
method but believes that each
woman should choose what is
most comfortable for her.
The newest trends in the
birthing business concern style
more than method. Style en
tered the picture in 1975 when
French obstetrician Frederick
Leboyer published Birth With
out Violence, advocating
"compassionate births."

Leboyer babies are born in
quiet, darkened delivery
rooms. Unless there are com
plications, the severing of the
umbilical cord is delayed to
allow the baby to begin brea
thing gradually. The infant is
immediately given to the
mother for a few moments of
caressing and then rinsed in a
warm bath and gently mas
saged. Leboyer says this re
duces trauma for the baby and
Leboyer babies are said to
enter the world smiling.
Mentally adroit?
A study conducted in France
indicates that Leboyer babies
may be more physically and
mentally adroit. FJanding the
baby to the mother im
mediately after delivery is said
to strengthen the mother-child
relationship.
But critics of Leboyer main
tain that he is dealing with as
sumptions, not proven facts.
They say that immediate con
tact between mother and child
may prove unsterile. Some say
that techniques such as dim
lights and low sound levels are
unnecessary since babies are
born face-down and experi
ence high levels of internal
noise in the mother's womb.
Still others contend that bond
ing does not affect the child's
behavior, though it may influ
ence the mother.
The "birthing room" con

cept follows the Leboyer
method in popularity. Hospi
talsalloverthecountry, includ
ing Stanford, are beginning to
set aside home-like rooms in
which women can deliver their
babies with family and friends
present.
According to proponents of
this new method, one of the
major advantages of birthing
rooms is that they offer a safe
alternative to home deliveries.
If complications occur the
mother can be rushed down
the hall to a traditional delivery
room containing modern
equipment. As an additional
incentive, the cost of delivery
is cut almost in half. According
to the American Hospital As
sociation, a normal maternity
stay costs $1100 and lasts three
days. A mother using a birth
room is usually charged $bOO
and leaves the hospital 24
hours after delivery.
Consumer innovation
Hospital birth rooms have
been primarily a consumer in
novation, not a medical one.
As home deliveries increased
from one percent in 1976 to a
current high of 15 percent in
some states, hospitals re
sponded accordingly. Arms,
who claims to have initiated
the concept in her book,
joined with a group of women
several years ago to petition
Stanford Hospital to make

birth rooms available. She
writes that after being told that
such a facility was "inapprop
riate," they organized to form
their own freestanding birth
center.
Although the Hospital
changed its policy and opened
two birth rooms last October,
the women continued their
plans and established The Birth
Place, a resource center on
University Ave. which houses a
library of books and articles on
all aspects of pregnancy and
parenting sells baby and
maternity clothes and spon
sors films and lectures. They
also plan to open their own
birthing room in Menlo Park
this August, featuring the
newest birthing trend — cer
tified midwives.
In general, birthing trends
seem to be healthy as long as
they are viewed as dialogues to
improve the birth process for
all concerned, mother and
baby. What is important is that
women, particularly young
women, do not become en
meshed in doing what is au
courant without considering
the alternatives. New trends
should not be avoided simply
because they are trendy, but
on the other hand, women
who feel more comfortable
with conventional methods
should not be scorned. It is,
after'all, a choice. A very per
sonal choice.

talsalloverthecountry, includ
ing Stanford, are beginning to
set aside home-like rooms in
which women can deliver their
babies with family and friends
present.
According to proponents of
this new method, one of the
major advantages of birthing
rooms is that they offer a safe
alternative to home deliveries.
If complications occur the
mother can be rushed down
the hall to a traditional delivery
room containing modern
equipment. As an additional
incentive, the cost of delivery
is cut almost in half. According
to the American Hospital As
sociation, a normal maternity
stay costs $1100 and lasts three
days. A mother using a birth
room is usually charged $bOO
and leaves the hospital 24
hours after delivery.
Consumer innovation
Hospital birth rooms have
been primarily a consumer in
novation, not a medical one.
As home deliveries increased
from one percent in 1976 to a
current high of 15 percent in
some states, hospitals re
sponded accordingly. Arms,
who claims to have initiated
the concept in her book,
joined with a group of women
several years ago to petition
Stanford Hospital to make

birth rooms available. She
writes that after being told that
such a facility was "inapprop
riate," they organized to form
their own freestanding birth
center.
Although the Hospital
changed its policy and opened
two birth rooms last October,
the women continued their
plans and established The Birth
Place, a resource center on
University Ave. which houses a
library of books and articles on
all aspects of pregnancy and
parenting sells baby and
maternity clothes and spon
sors films and lectures. They
also plan to open their own
birthing room in Menlo Park
this August, featuring the
newest birthing trend — cer
tified midwives.
In general, birthing trends
seem to be healthy as long as
they are viewed as dialogues to
improve the birth process for
all concerned, mother and
baby. What is important is that
women, particularly young
women, do not become en
meshed in doing what is au
courant without considering
the alternatives. New trends
should not be avoided simply
because they are trendy, but
on the other hand, women
who feel more comfortable
with conventional methods
should not be scorned. It is,
after'all, a choice. A very per
sonal choice.
The biological act of repro
duction entered the realm of
controversy in the 19705.
Childbirth is now divided into
philosophies, methods and
techniques, and many con
temporary women have been
"Lamazed," "Leboyered" and
"La Leched" to the point of
confusion.
Natural childbirth is respon
sible for the controversies
which have erupted these last
few years. Its philosophy is
based on the belief that a
mother should take an active
part in the delivery of her baby
and that the use of anesthesia
should be limited. Extreme
proponents of natural
childbirth contend that if any
drugs are used to assist deliv
ery, the birth is not natural.

One of the most popular
methods of natural childbirth,
Lamaze, teaches women to use
breathing techniques and
mental activities to block pain.
It also emphasizes the father's
participation throughout the
pregnancy.
The heart of the natural
childbirth controversy is

News analysis

whether or not drugs should
be used rather than this
"natural anesthesia." Palo Alto
resident Suzanne Arms said
she believes that pain has a
function in pregnancy and that
drug usage is potentially
dangerous in every birth. In
her book, Immaculate Decep

tion, Arms contends that
women have lost control over
the entire birthing process.
She says that the birth process
"was designed well. Stress has
significance."
Healthy trend?
Arms admits that much of
the pressure not to use drugs is
coming from peers but she
adds that in this case, the re
sulting trend is healthy, since it
encourages women to think
about the process and make a
personal choice.
Sophomore Toby Maurer,
however, thinks the trendiness
may be preventing many
young women from exercising
that very choice. Maurer said
her friends were "outraged"
when she told them that her
sister, Trudy Kaminsky, was
not having natural childbirth.

Speaking of social peer pres
sure, Maurer says:"I resent it.
It's so damned trendy. Pain is
not a beautiful experience."
Kaminsky agrees. She said
she never considered natural
childbirth and believes that, at
33, she is beyond being influ
enced by friends. But she has
seen it happen to younger
women.
'In vogue'
"Natural childbirth is very
much in vogue," Kaminsky
explained. "The woman next
to me in the hospital was in
labor for 24 hours. She almost
went out of her mind. The con
sensus of women on my floor
— several had had natural
childbirth in the past — was
that it is not the glorious ex
perience it is made out to be.
Women glorify it afterwards.
Vou forget the pain."
Kaminsky said she is not op
posed to the natural childbirth
method but believes that each
woman should choose what is
most comfortable for her.
The newest trends in the
birthing business concern style
more than method. Style en
tered the picture in 1975 when
French obstetrician Frederick
Leboyer published Birth With
out Violence, advocating
"compassionate births."

Leboyer babies are born in
quiet, darkened delivery
rooms. Unless there are com
plications, the severing of the
umbilical cord is delayed to
allow the baby to begin brea
thing gradually. The infant is
immediately given to the
mother for a few moments of
caressing and then rinsed in a
warm bath and gently mas
saged. Leboyer says this re
duces trauma for the baby and
Leboyer babies are said to
enter the world smiling.
Mentally adroit?
A study conducted in France
indicates that Leboyer babies
may be more physically and
mentally adroit. FJanding the
baby to the mother im
mediately after delivery is said
to strengthen the mother-child
relationship.
But critics of Leboyer main
tain that he is dealing with as
sumptions, not proven facts.
They say that immediate con
tact between mother and child
may prove unsterile. Some say
that techniques such as dim
lights and low sound levels are
unnecessary since babies are
born face-down and experi
ence high levels of internal
noise in the mother's womb.
Still others contend that bond
ing does not affect the child's
behavior, though it may influ
ence the mother.
