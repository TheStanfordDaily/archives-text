# Senior investigates apartheid
## 
### Krisan Froelich 
Senior Anne Bothwell re
turned last July from a 6V2-
week visit to South Africa.
Traveling alone and staying
with relatives of friends, she vi
sited Johannesburg, the
Orange Free State, Durban,
Pietermeritzberg, Cape Town,
Stellenbosch and Bloemfon
tein. Her trip was to find facts.
Bothwell went as a member
of the Memorial Church South
Africa Task Force. The task

force, formed more than a year
ago, is a group of a dozen
people who are concerned
with the problems of South Af
rica. They have been working
with the Stanford Committee
for Responsible Investment
Policies (SCRIP), but according
to Gray Crouse, another
member of the task force, in
vestment is only a "small part
of the picture."
Basically, the task force is in
vestigating the apartheid sys
tem (separation of the races)
currently in effect in South Af
rica. Bothwell went to get some
first-hand information and to
find out what the actual condi
tions there are.
"I tried to talk to a diverse
group of people." Bothwell
said, "everyone from the
people in business to the guy
who swept my apartment to
editors of prestigious papers."
Before she left, Bothwell
made a list of people she
wanted to talk with and called
them when she arrived in Af
rica. No one refused to see her.
"I asked a few key ques

tions," Bothwell said, "like
what do you think the future of
South Africa is? What changes
do you see happening? What
changes would you like to see?
And what do you think the role
of America is?"
Bothwell said she felt it was
hard to get people to speak
candidly, especially since cer
tain issues and government
policies are not allowed to be
discussed. In addition, she said
whites commented more than
blacks, since blacks "have
more to lose by talking."
Many of the people Bothwell
talked with said they expect a
"bloodbath" or some type of
"violent confrontation." Many
also thought it would be in the
"best interest" for American
businesses to withdraw from
South Africa. One group
claims that any U.S. business
or financial aid supports the
apartheid system, and thereby
violates American ethics. The
other side claims that the pre
sence of outside industry will
act as a "progressive force" to
cause a peaceful change.
Crouse calls this a "false argu
ment as far as the task force is
concerned."
"I know less now than be
fore I went," Bothwell com
mented. "The political system
is very complicated."
Agreeing that there will
probably be some kind of
change, Bothwell said, "You
can only keep the black people
in ignorance for a while."
Most blacks live in separate
"townships" outside the cities,
Bothwell said. Schools for
blacks run "intermittently"
and in many black families,
both parents work, leaving
children alone long hours.
Black South Africans can also
be "detained" by the govern
ment and arrested without
being charged. While Bothwell
was there, 22 persons who
were part of an interracial
Christian Youth group were
detained, because they al

legedly did "something that
the government didn't like."
Another problem facing
black South Africans is the
prospect of being "banned,"
prohibited for five years from
talking to more than one per
son at a time, writing, making
speeches and sometimes even
appearing in public. They can
also be placed on "house ar
rest" where they must be in
their homes by a certain hour
each day.
Bothwell's trip gave the task
force a focus according to
Crouse. The group is now at
tempting to stop the destruc
tion of Crossroads, a squatters
camp outside Cape Town.
The squatters camp was a re
sult of the Migrant Labor policy
which commands that a man
take a job to which he is as
signed and that he be given a
pass to live in or near the town
where the job is based. If his
wife is denied a similar pass,
the family is split. But many

wives refuse to follow this law
and move with their husbands,
building small squatters camps
such as Crossroads.
The houses in Crossroads
are made of corrugated iron
and papered with beer can
labels. "Towns like it exist all
over," Bothwell said. Resi
dents have no electricity and
no type of sanitation, but they
have developed a great sense
of "community spirit," she
explained. Crossroads resi
dents built a school and ar
ranged immunization for the
children.
Bulldozers
As happens in most squat
ters towns, Crossroads resi
dents were told they were
going to be "bulldozed,"
Bothwell explained. In efforts
to stop the order, they painted
their houses bright colors,
lashed sticks together to build
fences, constructed a church
and built walkways with
stones.

Hearing of the plan to de
molish Crossroads, the task
force contacted the United Na
tions and the State Department
in an effort to stop the order.
As of now Crossroads is still in
tact.
"We try to inform people
about Crossroads," Crouse
said. "It's a direct example of
the apartheid system. It's hard
for Americans to understand
the system. They don't think
about such consequences as
broken families."
Bothwell agrees that "some
whites down there are una
ware of what's going on.
Others are protesting." She
said that people should "be
aware of the problems espe
cially since South Africa is one
area of Africa where America
still has the ability to
negotiate."
Americans should be edu
cated about the situation, she
commented, "because it af
fects us more than we know."
