# Senior investigates apartheid

Senior Anne Bothwell re
turned last July from a 6V2-
week visit to South Africa.
Traveling alone and staying
with relatives of friends, she vi
sited Johannesburg, the
Orange Free State, Durban,
Pietermeritzberg, Cape Town,
Stellenbosch and Bloemfon
tein. Her trip was to find facts.
Bothwell went as a member
of the Memorial Church South
Africa Task Force. The task

force, formed more than a year
ago, is a group of a dozen
people who are concerned
with the problems of South Af
rica. They have been working
with the Stanford Committee
for Responsible Investment
Policies (SCRIP), but according
to Gray Crouse, another
member of the task force, in
vestment is only a "small part
of the picture."
Basically, the task force is in
vestigating the apartheid sys

currently in effect in South Af
rica. Bothwell went to get some
first-hand information and to
find out what the actual condi

"I tried to talk to a diverse
group of people." Bothwell
said, "everyone from the
people in business to the guy
who swept my apartment to
editors of prestigious papers."
Before she left, Bothwell
made a list of people she
wanted to talk with and called
them when she arrived in Af
rica. No one refused to see her.
"I asked a few key ques

tions," Bothwell said, "like
what do you think the future of
South Africa is? What changes
do you see happening? What
changes would you like to see?
And what do you think the role
of America is?"
Bothwell said she felt it was
hard to get people to speak
candidly, especially since cer
tain issues and government
policies are not allowed to be
discussed. In addition, she said
whites commented more than
blacks, since blacks "have
more to lose by talking."
Many of the people Bothwell
talked with said they expect a
"bloodbath" or some type of
"violent confrontation." Many
also thought it would be in the
"best interest" for American
businesses to withdraw from
South Africa. One group
claims that any U.S. business
or financial aid supports the
apartheid system, and thereby
violates American ethics. The
other side claims that the pre
sence of outside industry will
act as a "progressive force" to
