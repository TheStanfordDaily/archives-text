AN EASTER LESSON
Not too far away, in the land of Eg, there once
lived a rabbit named Little Bunny FooFoo
FooFoo was a good, obedient rabbit most of fhe
time
When Easier time arrived every year, FooFoo
turned into a mischievous bunny Despite the
warnings and admonishment of the older rabbits
FooFoo left black, rotten eggs tor the children on
Easter morning and laughed with delight when
the children found the spoiled eggs
