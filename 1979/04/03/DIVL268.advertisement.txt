. A nuclear plant on an earthquake fault?
PG&E's nuclear power plant in Diablo
Canyon sits within three miles of the massive
Hosgri earthquake fault. The fault is capable of
quaking with a force far greater than the quake
which leveled San Francisco in 1906.
What happens when an earthquake
shatters a nuclear power plant? PG&E thinks
we can afford to wait and see.
