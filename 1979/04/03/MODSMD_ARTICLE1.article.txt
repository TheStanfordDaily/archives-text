Harrisburg, Pa. (AP) — Engineers
achieved a "dramatic decrease" yes
terday in a gas bubble that has held a
stranglehold on efforts to cool down
the disabled Three Mile Island nuc
lear reactor.
Plant and federal officials said the
hydrogen bubble had shrunk to a
much safer size and the reactor's
temperature had dropped signific
antly.
"I am certain it is cause for op
timism," said Harold Denton, Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission opera
tions chief. He said the bubble was
showing "a dramatic decrease in
size.
"I didn't expect such a rapid
change," Denton said of the bubble.
"I think it is safer than yesterday."
Local civil defense officials, hope
ful that the changes meant that the
five-day crisis here had passed,
nevertheless maintained efforts to
prepare for a precautionary evacua
tion of 25,000 residents still within a
five-mile radius of the plant.
But the signals were clear: the
situation had improved substantially.
Technicians continued efforts yes
terday to eliminate the bubble com
pletely, chiefly by the method they
have been using all along: letting the
gas dissolve in the constantly cir
culating cooling water and then al
lowing it to escape from the water
outside the reactor.
Technicians also studied options
on exactly how to achieve the "cold
shutdown" which would go a long
way to ending the crisis.
George Troffer, an official with
Metropolitan Edison, which operates

the facility, said radioactive releases
had been halted at the site.
And NRC's Denton said that radia
tion beaming from the plant was at
low levels in a confined area.
The bubble, which had threatened
an explosion that could have ripped
the lid off the reactor dome and
spewed radiation, began shrinking
dramatically Sunday and continued
throughout the day and night, Trot
fer said.
The latest developments gave offi
cials more time to cool down the
reactor. The critical time for a possi
ble explosion from a chemical reac
tion within the reactor "has moved
considerably out" from the five days
Denton had predicted on Sunday, he
said.
It was the most encouraging
statement to date from the NRC since
Wednesday's accident, which had
led the governor to urge pre-school
children and pregnant women to stay
further than five miles from the plant
and prompted an estimated 50,000
persons to voluntarily leave the Har
risburg area.
In Washington, Energy Secretary
James Schlesinger said Congress
should act to speed up licensing for
nuclear power plants despite the
Three Mile Island accident.
Schlesinger acknowledged the
reactor accident will make it more
difficult for the administration to get
such legislation through Congress.
But he said there is no real way
around nuclear power if the nation
wants to reduce its heavy depen
dency on Mideast oil.
"It's a question of trading Iran off
against Three Mile Island," the
energy secretary told a reporter.
Schlesinger predicted President
Jimmy Carter soon would resubmit
to Congress his bill — unsuccessfully
proposed in 1978 — to reduce from
11 years to about six years the time it
now takes 1o approve, license and
begin building a new nuclear plant.
Testifying at a House hearing yes
terday, Schlesinger warned against
rushing to any judgment on the
Three Mile Island accident until all
the facts are in.
"There should be a total technical
review of what did indeed take place
and until that review is completed we
should be careful in drawing conclu

sions either way," the energy secret
ary testified.
The licensing speed-up bill has
been criticized by opponents of nuc
lear energy on grounds it provides
too many short cuts. But Schlesinger
said that, "the purpose of that bill is
to cut back on paperwork. In no vvay
is that licensing bill intended to re
duce any consideration by the NRC
of safety issues."
Meanwhile, all schools within 10
miles of the plant were closed yes
terday, and some state government
offices reported up to one-third of
their employees stayed home. Fac
tories and businesses were stung by
absenteeism and operated with
skeleton staffs.
Customers queued up in banks,
trying to withdraw money before an
evacuation was announced, state
banking officials said.
But Denton said it was his opinion
that with conditions improving at
Three Mile Island, an evacuation was
not warranted. John McGreevy, ad
ministrator of Polyclinic Medical
Center, Harrisburg's largest hospital,
said, "I have been told by very reli
able sources there are no evacuation
plans in the foreseeable future."
Meanwhile, the NRC moved to
avoid future cooling system break
downs elsewhere, ordering officials
at seven other nuclear plants to exp
lain what they are doing to prevent
similar failures. All seven were de
signed by Babcock and Wilcox Co.,
the firm which drew up plans for
Three Mile Island.
Plant engineers at Three Mile Is
land shrunk the gas bubble by allow
ing the hydrogen in the reactor's
cooling water to escape into another
building, just as carbon dioxide bub
bles out of a soda bottle when the
cap is removed and pressure is re
leased.
At the same time, the oxygen
trickle into the hydrogen bubble,
which for a time had threatened to
create a chemical reaction and a sub
sequent explosion, was not increas
ing as rapidly, Denton said.
The bubble itself, once up to 1800
cubic feet, was reduced to as small as
50 cubic feet, although Denton ad
ded, "I don't want to be stampeded
into saying that the bubble actually is
that size."

Jimmy Carter soon would resubmit
to Congress his bill — unsuccessfully
proposed in 1978 — to reduce from
11 years to about six years the time it

Testifying at a House hearing yes

Three Mile Island accident until all

"There should be a total technical
review of what did indeed take place

The licensing speed-up bill has
been criticized by opponents of nuc

too many short cuts. But Schlesinger
said that, "the purpose of that bill is
to cut back on paperwork. In no vvay
is that licensing bill intended to re
duce any consideration by the NRC
of safety issues."
Meanwhile, all schools within 10
miles of the plant were closed yes
terday, and some state government
offices reported up to one-third of
their employees stayed home. Fac
tories and businesses were stung by
absenteeism and operated with
skeleton staffs.
Customers queued up in banks,
trying to withdraw money before an
evacuation was announced, state
banking officials said.
But Denton said it was his opinion
that with conditions improving at
Three Mile Island, an evacuation was
not warranted. John McGreevy, ad
ministrator of Polyclinic Medical
Center, Harrisburg's largest hospital,
said, "I have been told by very reli
able sources there are no evacuation
plans in the foreseeable future."
Meanwhile, the NRC moved to
avoid future cooling system break
downs elsewhere, ordering officials
at seven other nuclear plants to exp
lain what they are doing to prevent
similar failures. All seven were de
signed by Babcock and Wilcox Co.,
the firm which drew up plans for
Three Mile Island.
Plant engineers at Three Mile Is
land shrunk the gas bubble by allow
ing the hydrogen in the reactor's
cooling water to escape into another

At the same time, the oxygen
trickle into the hydrogen bubble,
which for a time had threatened to
create a chemical reaction and a sub
sequent explosion, was not increas

The bubble itself, once up to 1800
cubic feet, was reduced to as small as
50 cubic feet, although Denton ad

reported a "dramatic decrease" in the size of a gas bubble

Harrisburg, Pa. (AP) — Engineers
achieved a "dramatic decrease" yes
terday in a gas bubble that has held a
stranglehold on efforts to cool down
the disabled Three Mile Island nuc
lear reactor.
Plant and federal officials said the
hydrogen bubble had shrunk to a
much safer size and the reactor's
temperature had dropped signific
antly.
"I am certain it is cause for op
timism," said Harold Denton, Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission opera
tions chief. He said the bubble was
showing "a dramatic decrease in
size.
"I didn't expect such a rapid
change," Denton said of the bubble.
"I think it is safer than yesterday."
Local civil defense officials, hope
ful that the changes meant that the
five-day crisis here had passed,
nevertheless maintained efforts to
prepare for a precautionary evacua
tion of 25,000 residents still within a
five-mile radius of the plant.
But the signals were clear: the
situation had improved substantially.
Technicians continued efforts yes
terday to eliminate the bubble com
pletely, chiefly by the method they
have been using all along: letting the
gas dissolve in the constantly cir
culating cooling water and then al
lowing it to escape from the water
outside the reactor.
Technicians also studied options
on exactly how to achieve the "cold
shutdown" which would go a long
way to ending the crisis.
George Troffer, an official with
Metropolitan Edison, which operates

the facility, said radioactive releases
had been halted at the site.
And NRC's Denton said that radia
tion beaming from the plant was at
low levels in a confined area.
The bubble, which had threatened
an explosion that could have ripped
the lid off the reactor dome and
spewed radiation, began shrinking
dramatically Sunday and continued
throughout the day and night, Trot
fer said.
The latest developments gave offi
cials more time to cool down the
reactor. The critical time for a possi
ble explosion from a chemical reac
tion within the reactor "has moved
considerably out" from the five days
Denton had predicted on Sunday, he
said.
It was the most encouraging
statement to date from the NRC since
Wednesday's accident, which had
led the governor to urge pre-school
children and pregnant women to stay
further than five miles from the plant
and prompted an estimated 50,000
persons to voluntarily leave the Har
risburg area.
In Washington, Energy Secretary
James Schlesinger said Congress
should act to speed up licensing for
nuclear power plants despite the
Three Mile Island accident.
Schlesinger acknowledged the
reactor accident will make it more
difficult for the administration to get
such legislation through Congress.
But he said there is no real way
around nuclear power if the nation
wants to reduce its heavy depen
dency on Mideast oil.
"It's a question of trading Iran off
against Three Mile Island," the
energy secretary told a reporter.
Schlesinger predicted President
Jimmy Carter soon would resubmit
to Congress his bill — unsuccessfully
proposed in 1978 — to reduce from
11 years to about six years the time it
