## Reduce American oil dependence 
### 
The end of an era is at hand.
The cessation of United States
oil imports from Iran has once
again made us acutely aware of
the world petroleum crisis.
Several years ago, during the
Arab oil embargo, the Ameri
can population was plagued by
fuel rationing, odd-even
license piate purchase restric
tion, and seemingly endless
lines of thirsty automobiles.
The net result was a severe rise
in gas prices. Everyone com
plained, but greater cost
seemed a lesser evil than the
inconvenience posed by the
shortage.
Sincethen, energy conserva
tion has been a dominant
theme in the American lifestyle.
We have collectively witnessed
the birth of the 55 mph speed
limit, the catalytic converter
and thousands of small,
energy-efficient automobiles.
Fuel prices have continued to
creep upward and public ser
vice announcements have
tried to emphasize the impor
tance of voluntary individual
efforts to curtail unnecessary
driving.
In the meantime, the pet
roleum industry has stepped
up its search for new untapped
sources of crude oil and
natural gas, while simultane
ously increasing production
from existing wells. The Carter
adminstration has juggled its
foreign-policy around efforts to
ensure that the inflow of im
ported oil remains adequate. A
recent example is our sudden
diplomacy with Mexico, a
country virtually ignored until
word came of the black gold
lying beneath its soil.

Despite all this, the Ameri
can people are once again
faced with a real energy crisis.
In a sense, we are a population
addicted to oil; our economy,
daily activities and lifestyles are
critically dependent on it.
Energy experts have been
aware of the impending shor
tage for nearly two decades,
yet our means of dealing with
the problem have been inef
fective to date. Rather than at
tempt to rehabilitate the "ad
dict," we have tried simultane
ously to find more of his
"drug" and encourage him to
get by with less.
Many changes could have
been made had city planners,
government officials and
others had more foresight into
the magnitude of the long
term problem. For example,
the money and manpower
used for construction of the
Alaska pipeline could have
provided several American
cities with much-needed rapid
transit systems. The resulting
decreased dependence on
driving and petroleum saving
could have left Alaska's crude
untapped and wildlife undis
turbed.
Despite our present position
on the brink of energy disaster,
we continue to allow new,
low-mileage automobiles to be
sold. Major manufacturers
have demonstrated that
energy-efficient cars can be
built, yet the choice between
one of these and a gas-guzzler
has remained subject to indi
vidual selection.
Had production of the latter
been banned years ago, we
would have saved substantial

quantities of fuel, perhaps
enough to obviate the present
shortage. Most importantly,
everyone would still have got
ten where they wanted to go,
which is the whole purpose of
owning a motor vehicle. Soon,
as a result of previous mis
takes, Americans will be forced
to realize that the age of the
status-symbol, luxury au
tomobile is over.
Our current mismanage
ment of the petroleum crisis is
also demonstrated by numer
ous subtle circumstances of
waste. These include empty
seats on commercial jets
(which have only recently been
partially remedied by cancel
ling flights), an inefficient
inter state passenger train sys
tem providing little incentive
for use, toll booths on majors
bridges and freeways requiring
frequent unnecessary stop
start driving, and grossly in
adequate public transportation
systems in many American
cities. For example, the South
ern Pacific passenger line in
conveniently deposits com
muters on the extreme south
side of San Francisco.
Current city planning
strategies also represent a hid
den drain on petroleum re
sources. New housing projects
continue to be built in subur
ban areas which lie ever
increasing distances from major
business centers, thus creating
"urban sprawl." Members of
each household must travel to
work, school and shopping,
which translates into energy
consumption.
Significant fuel saving would
result from attempts to decen

tralize urban areas and bring
work and living environments
into closer proximity. George
Pullman had this idea in the
1930s when he built housing
for his workers adjacent to his
Chicago railroad-car factory.
We would be a healthier popu
lation living in a quieter,
pollution-free environment if
everyone lived within bicycling
distance of their workplace.
That our nation, one of the
most powerful on earth, could
be suddenly brought to its
knees by complete cut off of
imported oil is not a comfort
ing thought. Our current de
pendence on foreign energy
resources is a factor which
could easily force involvement
in an international conflict, and
hence is a threat to American
isolationism and self
autonomy. Whereas the term
"gas war" once held positive
connotations, it may soon
come to signify the last desper
ate hurrah of a spoiled nation,
struggling to avoid economic
collapse.
Solutions to this dilemma are
complex, but revolve around
the need fora shift in emphasis
from oil conservation to sub
stitution of alternative energy
sources with greater availabil
ity. In the meantime, prudent
individual use of oil and other
forms of energy is essential.
