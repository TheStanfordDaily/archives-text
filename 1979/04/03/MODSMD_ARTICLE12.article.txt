## Paris on 40 francs a day

"Excuse me, I have a little . . . mal de mer," I
said, trying to mock a French accent at the end of
the phrase. In the face of danger, with a French
crew staring at me blankly in the face, I had just
completed my first sentence of franglais,
I must have done well because the crew
reacted immediately. After some scurrying one
of the crew members thrust a paper sack into my
hands. That not being what I really needed and
trying to calm them all down, I asked "Avez
vous quelque chose d'autreV' (Do you have
something else?). After asking that I half
expected to be greeted with the response
"Avez-vous besoin d un sac plus grand?" (Do
you need a larger bag?) But with an additional
motion I was able to get what I really wanted —
some French Dramamiene.
I was on the train-"boat from London to Paris.
The quick ride across the channel was delayed
by my Transalpino ticket. Transalpino is a travel
organization which gives student discounts by
sending the student by the slowest possible way
between two points. In my case it meant spend
ingthree and one half hours on the channel, and
my stomach was not quite up to the challenge.
The amount saved by taking Transalpino is
only minimal; but being either a student or a
masochist, I have taken Transalpino twice and I
will probably do so once again before leaving
Europe.
Money, or the lack of it, is one of the biggest
differences between the student traveler and his
wealthier, tourist counterpart. While a tourist
eats comfortably in Europe, a student tries to
subsist on Vache qui rit cheese sandwiches for a
week before making the big splurge in the local
restaurant.
The other major difference between students
and ordinary tourists is that students prefer to
take part in the culture of the country they are
in, while tourists would rather be more remote.
They observe the culture when it suits them, and
return to their own manners and customs the
rest of the time. Therefore, students try to part
with those hideous symbols of "Made in the
U.S.A" — the chief giveaway being their down
jackets.

They also attempt to speak the local language
in all of their encounters instead of shouting
everything in slow English, as in "H-O-W
M-U-C-H?" Finally, they accept the things that
come their way — believing that if they do not
like something it is probably their fault. When
these characteristics are combined with a weak
knowledge of the language, the results can be
quite interesting.
Arriving in France several days early, I thought
I would stay in Paris for awhile and enjoy this
fabled city. Unfortunately, many American
tourists have the mistaken idea that the French
hate Americans. This is far from the truth. It is
only the Parisians who hate Americans. And if it
will make you feel any better, the French who
live outside Paris hate the Parisians in turn.
I, too, was warned by friends that I would not
be kindly greeted in France, but I tried not to
believe these rumors. Perhaps, I thought, this
hatred was reserved only for those obnoxious
American tourists. I have found there is proba
bly never a time overseas when you feel less like
being an American than when you are in a quiet
restaurant and the couple seated next to you is
loudly discussing their sight-seeing plans:
"Harry, tomorrow morning from 10 to 11 we'll
do the Louvre and then walk through the
Tuileries and then. . .
But my experiences in Paris have been pleas
ant in comparison with others'. I know of one
student who spent hours in a Parisian Post Of
fice being shuffled from one line to the next;
another, who after having made a collect phone
call to the U.S., was charged with the offense of
having intentionally defrauded the French tele
phone company; and, another student who had
to hide out from a collection agency for a week
because the Telex machine in his Parisian bank
was broken and he could not receive his wired
money from home.
Luckily, not all of France is as fabled as Paris —
and that is why 1 am in Tours.
(Drew Lyon, a junior majoring in international
relations, is essaying to improve his franglais in
his second quarter at the Tours overseas center.)
