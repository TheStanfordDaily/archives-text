# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Chris Gray China Syndrome is real 
### 
An electrical supply network
both controls and powers the
Emergency Core Cooling
System (ECCS)and other reactor
shutdown equipment on Unit
1. Beginning at 12:55 p.m., this
key network was lost. The
normal feedwater system was
lost, the high-pressure ECCS
was lost, the reactor core spray
system was lost, and most of
the instrumentation was
lost. . . . The process compu
ter on Unit 1 was lost at 1:21
p.m. . . . the PAX telephone
system failed at 1:57 p.m. mak
ing it impossible to place out
going calls from the control
room . . . at 2:45 p.m. one of
the plant's four diesel
generators failed. . . .
About 6:00 p.m., reactor
pressure increased to above
350 pounds per square inch . . .
the only source of water for the
Unit 1 reactor was now the con
trol rod drive pump, and this
probably would not prevent a
boil-off accident that would
turn into a core meltdown in
just a few hours.
This may sound like Jane
Fonda's latest movie, The
China Syndrome, — but it
isn't; it's Brown's Ferry,
Alabama, March 22, 1975 and
they almost lost it.
"The China Syndrome" re
fers to a type of nuclear disas
ter, a core meltdown in a nuc
lear reactor when the incredi
bly hot radioactive metal burns
down through the contain
ment vessel "all the way to
China." Actually, it just burns
down until it hits ground wa
ter, at which time it explodes
upward, spreading a radioac
tive cloud that, according to a
1965 government study, would
kill more than 40,000 people
and contaminate an area the
size of Pennsylvania.
There hasn't been such a
meltdown yet, but there have
been several close calls such as
the Brown's Ferry "incident"
described above and the par
tial meltdown of the Fermi
reactor in Detroit on October
4, 1966. Many experts claim a
major accident is just a matter
of time.
Government officials and
corporate executives scoff at
such fears. Of course, many
corporate executives are now
government officials. A 1976
Common Cause investigation
of the Nuclear Regulatory

Commission (NRC) and the
Energy Resource Development
Administration (ERDA) shows
that 52 percent of ERDA ad
ministrators were from energy
corporations; six of nine
executive-level positions are
filled by former employees ot
ERDA contractors, the three
other positions are filled by
former employees of firms
regulated by the NRC. Two
thirds of top NRC employees
came from private firms in
volved in energy.
There is a significant number
of dissenters. Twenty-three
hundred scientists (including
nine Nobel Prizewinners) have
called for a moratorium on
nuclear plant construction.
Three top General Electric en
gineers, a former NRC project
manager, a former NRC reactor
engineer, and a former as
sociate director of the Lawr
ence Livermore Labs have all
put their careers on the line to
call for a halt to nuclear de
velopment because, in their
analysis, it is too dangerous.
If you've seen The China
Syndrome, you may have
found some of its details hard
to believe. Would utilities try
to use force to prevent infor
mation from getting out?
Maybe you've heard of Karen
Silkwood. Some say she was
murdered while on her way to
a meeting with a union rep and
a New York Times reporter.
What's known for sure is the
envelope she had with her was
missing from the scene of her
fatal car crash. Fler parents are
suing her employer, Kerr-
McGee. There are new revela
tions daily that are even co
vered in the Chronicle.
Or perhaps you don't be 1
lieve subcontractors would de
liberately fake specification
tests? You should talk to Fre
derick Slautterback, an en
gineer specializing in quality
control, formerly employed by
Raychem. Raychem makes
electrical cable. Cable is used
in scores of nuclear plants (in
cluding Diablo Canyon) for
emergency shutdown systems.
Slautterback resigned because
Raychem continued shipping,
and the utilities continued us
ing, cable that failed key
specifications — it isn't water
proof.
The reactor in the movie

wasn't even plagued by the
Hosgri fault that runs at the
threshold of the Diablo Ca
nyon Nuclear power plant in
San Luis Obispo. At least 80
miles long, it connects with the
San Cregorio fault, which in
turn is connected to the San
Andreas Fault. Geologists es
timate the Hosgri fault could
trigger a quake five times as
powerful as what Diablo was
designed to withstand. Such a
quake would cause a catas
trophic nuclear accident. As
they say in San Luis Obispo,
"Diablo is an accident waiting
to happen."
The movie doesn't go into
low level radiation leaks, the
problems of waste disposal,
the problem of deactivating
reactors (a plant shut down at
Christ's death would still have
to be guarded today — and for
another 96,000 years), the links
between nuclear power and
nuclear weapons, the ecologi
cal havoc caused by hot water
discharge and by uranium min
ing, and on and on. It is only a
movie, after all.
It does go into censorship.
But who could believe that the
public media might be pres
sured into not reporting the
real dangers of nuclear power?
Well, Don Widener does. He
just won $475,000 in an out-of
court settlement in a libel suit
against Pacific Gas and Electric
(the builders of Diablo). He
charged that PG&E tried to ruin
his career because of an anti
nuke documentary he made with
Jack Lemmon. Or you could
ask Barbara Walters. General
Electric withdrew their adver
tising for Walters' show when
she had the effrontery to inter
view a Jane Fonda and ask her
about sex, Tom Hayden and
nuclear power.
You may not believe any of
this. Well and good. But re
member, "What you don't
know can kill you." That's the
title of one of the chapters oi
The Silent Bomb, an anthology
on nuclear power, edited by
Peter Faulkner from which
much of this article was writ
ten.
(Chris Gray is an alumnus living
in Palo Alto. This biweekly col
umn was submitted before the
nuclear incident at the Three-
Mile Island reactor in Pennsyl
vania - an incident authorities
now call the worst in U.S. his
tory.)
