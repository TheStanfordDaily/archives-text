Facts distorted
In his letter to the Daily
(Wed., March 7), Michael Bal
lard distorts the facts and mis
construes the issues in the case
of Soviet prisoner of consci
ence Anatoly Shcharansky.
Ballard quotes Newsweek
out of context to make it ap
pear as if Shcharansky com
mited treason by passing
Soviet "state defense secrets"
to Los Angeles Times reporter
Robert Toth. Construing the
article to portray Toth as a
worker for U.S. military intelli
gence, Ballard attempts to tie
Shcharansky to the CIA as did
the Soviet press, Izvestia, and
the Soviet court.
Harvard Law Professor Alan
Dershowitz, who offered to
defend Shcharansky at his
wife's request, has put it suc
cintly, in the same Newsweek
issue: "Imagine how incompe
tent an American intelligence
agency would have to be to
have engaged someone like
Shcharansky as a spy. His
phone obviously tapped, his
every movement openly sur
veyed, his roommate a KGB
plant; Shcharansky was the
worst possible candidate for
the espionage game. Imagine
how incompetent the Soviet
counter-espionage apparatus
would have been to have let
someone like Shcharansky
have access to military sec
rets."
Dershowitz continues, with
regard to "the Toth connec
tion": "The (trial) prosecutor
has made much of the informa
tion that Shcharansky gave to
Robert Toth. . . .But there was
nothing secret about the in
formation or about the fact that
Shcharansky turned it over to
Toth. Shcharansky was always
identified by name in the press
reports as the source of the in
formation. Are these the ac
tions of a secret spy trying to
conceal his relationship to the
press?"
What Shcharansky turned

over to Toth was "simply the
names and places of occupa
tion of refuseniks whose emig
ration requests had been
turned down on the ground
that they had worked in jobs
involving state secrets."
In the entire judicial pro
ceedings against him,
Shcharansky was denied due
process of law: he was held in
communicado for 16 months
during extensive pre-trial in
vestigations, denied legal
counsel and any contact with
friends or relatives.
At his trial, only six points of
40 pages of his submitted tes
timony were accepted by the
court; he was not allowed to
call witnesses on his behalf,
and many of his questions to
prosecution witnesses were in
terrupted or disallowed.
These breaches of due pro
cess only approach the central
issue which Ballard has mis
sed: the importance of
Shcharansky's trial was its pur
pose, which was not to punish
an individual for passing "sec
rets," but to silence the re
fusenik movement in the
Soviet Union, to instill fear
through the apparent rule of
law by a show trial â€” a strategy
invented by Joseph Stalin in
the 19305.
Shcharansky was chosen for
prosecution because, as Der
showitz says,"he was the voice
of the Jewish refuseniks ... to
the outside world. His every
act was out in the open. It was
his purpose to let Soviet au
thorities know that his voice,
the articulate translation of
thousands of other refusenik
voices, was being listened to
abroad. He did nothing in sec
ret, that was neither his
method nor his purpose."
And Shcharansky's real pur
pose was simple: to emigrate
to Israel and rejoin his wife.

Barrels not
for garbage
As an employee of the ASSU
Recycling Center, I helped
place the green recycling bar
rels in the dorms, houses and
offices around the campus.
These barrels are not gar
bage bins.
Sorting through the barrels'
contents to separate the gar
bage from the recyclable
goods wastes time and money.
It is much simpler, easier, fas
ter, and efficient to dump a bin
full of pure recyclable goods
into the larger containers at the
center.
Recycling bins have been

removed from the Law and Biz
school lounges because of the
recurrent garbage problem.
Paper (any non-shiny, non
waxy, non-carbon paper),
aluminum, bimetal, cel
lophane, wax-coated objects,
styrofoam, cereal boxes (and
the like), candy wrappers and
food are not (yet) recyclable.
The ASSU Recycling Center
has grown and is able to func
tion because of the coopera
tion of the University commun
ity. You can thank yourselves
that recycling works.
Please! Place only recyclable
goods in the green barrels!
