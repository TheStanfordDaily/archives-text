# What's safe?
## Accounting for everyday radiation 
### Associated Press 
How much radiation are you
absorbing every day? How
much of it could you avoid?
The accident at the Three
Mile Island nuclear plant near
Harrisburg, Pa., points up the
need to weigh the benefits and
the risks of radiation and to
eliminate unnecessary expo
sure.
The average American gets
100 to 120 millirems of natural
background radiation a year.
This includes radiation from
elements in the earth, from
outer space and from sub
stances like potassium-40 in
the body.
We also are exposed to
man-made radiation, most of it
in the form of medical and den
tal X-rays. Television sets emit a
tiny amount of radiation and
some smoke detectors contain
radioactive materials.
We face a different, but still
potentially dangerous, kind of
radiation from the sun and
from microwaves like the ones
in ovens.
The risks from everyday,
low-level radiation are minimal
compared to the threat posed
by a nuclear accident. But sci
entists do not know whether
there is any level of radiation,
no matter how small, which is
absolutely safe.
"Short of wearing a radiation
badge, there is no way of de
termining what level you've
been exposed to," says Allan
McGowan of the Scientists In
stitute for Public Information.
Dr. Solomon Michaelson of
the University of Rochester
Medical Center adds: "We're
always surrounded by radiant
energy. . . . You have to put

the danger in perspective as to
what society really wants."
Here is a look at some radia
tion sources and ways to
minimize risk:
Sun
Radiation from the sun's in
frared and ultraviolet rays is
particularly dangerous be
cause it is directly absorbed in
the skin. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) says
radiation from the sun is the

leading cause of skin cancer.
A study by the National
Cancer Institute showed that a
sunny, southern area —
Dallas-Forth Worth — had
more than double the skin
cancer rate of a less sunny,
northern one — Minneapolis-
St. Paul. Scientists say 60 per
cent of the ultraviolet rays strik
ing the earth reach the surface
between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. If
you must get a tan, try to do so
before 10 or after 2.
X-rays
Experts say 90 percent of the
man-made radiation we face
comes from diagnostic X-rays.
You can absorb up to 20 mil
lirems from a dental X-ray and
30 from a chest X-ray. To be
safe, the FDA suggests:

— Don't decide on your own
to have an X-ray like the ones
you get at a mobile unit for de
tecting tuberculosis. There are
safer and more effective tests
for the disease and the mobile
units often expose you to more
radiation than necessary.
— Don't insist on an X-ray
when you visit your doctor or
dentist. Let him or her be the
judge. Tell your doctor or de
ntist about all previous X-rays;

you may not need a fresh set.
— If you are a woman and are
pregnant or think you're pre
gnant, tell your doctor or de
ntist. Radiation may affect the
fetus. If you're male and of
child-producing age or
younger, ask for a lead shield
to protect the reproductive or
gans.
Smoke detectors
lonization chamber detec
tors contain small amounts of
radioactive material. This does
NOT mean they are danger
ous, says the National Fire Pre
vention and Control Administ
ration.
The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission performs a radia
tion safety analysis on all new
models.

Most TV sets do not give off
any measurable level of radia
tion and a federal standard
limits allowable TV radiation to
about one-four-hundredth the
amount emitted by a dental
X-ray.
Look at the back of the TV
before you buy for a label or
tag certifying that the set meets
the federal standard. When
your set needs repairs, call a
qualified serviceman.
The primary cause of in
creased X-ray emission from
TV sets is adjustment of operat
ing voltages to levels above the
manufacturer's recommenda
tion.
Microwave ovens
The microwaves in an oven
are generated by an electron
tube inside the cabinet. They
bounce back and forth and are
absorbed bv the food, causing
water mole ules in the food to
vibrate and produce heat.
The FDA sets a strict limit on
the amount of radiation per
mitted to leak from the oven
wall. It also requires ovens to
have two interlock systems to
prevent them from operating if
the door is not securely fas
tened. The minute the door is
opened or the latch is released,
the microwaves stop. There is
no residual radiation.
To avoid trouble, do not
have the oven rewired so that
the interlock system will not
operate. If you suspect your
oven is leaking, contact your
state health department for a
possible test. Do not try to test
the oven yourself. The FDA
says that a number of the de
vices sold for do-it-yourself
tests "are inaccurate and unre
liable."
