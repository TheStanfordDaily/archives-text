# Law students and alumni help public interest groups

Thanks to a student-run
foundation at Stanford's Law
School, the Disability Law
Center in Campbell will have
an extra $14,000 this year.
The Stanford Public Interest
Law Foundation (SPILF) has al
ready recruited about 120 stu
dents who have pledged to
contribute 2 percent of their
summer salaries or $50 to law
related projects the group
deems worthwhile. The 30 to
40 alumni members are pledg
ing $500.
In January, SPILF members
made recommendations to
their Board of Directors on 16
funding requests. Proposals
ranged from a Mexican land
claims project to a gay rights
national resource center to a
class action suit against the
Minnesota Department of
Health for failure to regulate
nursing homes.
Debbie Cauble, who
graduated from Stanford Law
School last year, was awarded
the $14,000 for the Disability
Center. She "impressed us
with her personal dedication,"
said SPILF board member Edith
Eddy.

According to Cauble, there
are 90,000 physically disabled
adults in Santa Clara County.
The Disability Law Center of
fers them free advice on in
come and health benefits is
sues, consumer problems, ar
chitectural barriers and
employment discrimination.
The SPILF grant will allow
Cauble, who has been receiv
ing a CETA salary, to become a
coordinating attorney for the
center, and to take on another
CETA worker in her stead.
"This way I'll be able to do
more planning — determining
who we're serving and prepar
ing background materials for
other students," Cauble said.
"It's really exciting for me to
be the first grantee — I'm a
founding member of SPILF,"
she added.
SPILF began last year as a
grassroots movement among
Stanford Law students. Along
with UC-Berkeley's Law Foun
dation, Stanford's income
sharing idea was immediately
pegged by Newsweek as a pro
duct of the guilt which accom
panied a turn to materialism
after the student activism of

the '60s.
And yet, SPILF is only one of
a handful of similar student or
ganizations nationwide. The
Stanford group chose to be au
tonomous, like Berkeley's, in
stead of pooling its funds into a
central foundation established
a few years ago by Ralph
Nader.
Founding member and pres
ident Karen Chapman says the
group is now conducting a
pledge drive, concentrating on
recruiting third-year students
who will soon be earning full
salaries.
From now on, student re
cruiting will become especially
vital to SPILF. So far, according
to Law School Financial Man
ager Ruben Mendez, the ad
ministration has contributed
much to SPILF, by donating a
phone, a shared room, secre
tarial help and an $800 starting
grant.
But Dean Charles Meyers re
cently revealed that while the
phone and office space will be
continued, the money will not.
"I think there are other things
that are more important," he
said.
