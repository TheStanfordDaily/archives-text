# Daily case search ban proposed by Carter
## 
### Mike Charlson 
President Jimmy Carter yesterday
introduced to Congress legislation
which would effectively counter the
effects of the May 1978 Supreme
Court decision in Zurcherv. Stanford
Daily. The Court decision in that case
affirmed the right of police to use
search warrants to search and seize
materials in newsrooms and on other
third-party premises.
The bill was introduced as part of a
package of legislation aimed at en
suring the privacy of every U.S. citi
zen, according to a White House
press release.
Besides the bill banning police
searches and seizures of reporters'
documents, bills were also pre
sented which would restrict use of
individual medical records and re
cords from federally supported re
search.
Carter also promised to introduce
legislation later this spring which
would put new limits on release of
information contained in banking,
credit and insurance records.
Provisions of the so-called First
Amendment Privacy Protection Act
would restrict police searches for
documentary material held by the
press and by others "involved in the
dissemination of information to the
public," prohibit, with limited ex
ceptions, a search for or seizure of
the "work product" of such indi
viduals and require that for docu
ments not falling under the defini
tion of work product that police first

obtain a subpoena duces tecum —
which compels a person to appear
and to bring certain items with him —
rather than use a search warrant.
Documentary material includes
written or printed material plus
tapes, photographs, videotape nega
tives, films, outtakes and interview
files, according to the bill draft. Work
product refers to documentary mate
rial created by a person involved in
disseminating information to the
public while working in that capacity.
The bill stems from the high court
ruling last spring which upheld the
use of a search warrant by police
when the object of a search was an
unsuspected third party, even when
the party was a newspaper.
The case tested the validity of an
April 12, 1971 search of the Daily of
fices in which Palo Alto police rum
maged through tiles in search of evi
dence to use against protesters who
had been involved in a three-day
sit-in at the Medical Center which
ended in violence.
The police gave no prior warning
of the search and found no evidence
pertaining to their case. The Daily
which had never been suspected of
any criminal wrongdoing, sued,
however, claiming that such
searches could turn up anything, and
that the press' ability to engage in
investigative reporting involving
confidential sources would be se
verely weakened if police could
search offices without warning.
The Daily argued that the First and

Fourth Amendments prohibited such
searches and that the police should
be forced to show why a subpoena
duces tecum was impractical before
a search warrant could be issued. A
subpoena gives the object of the
search an opportunity to go to court
to quash the order. If unsuccessful,
the party turns over the materials so
no physical search takes place.
Two lower courts agreed with the
Daily, but on appeal Palo Alto police,
with the backing of the U.S. Justice
Dept. and law enforcement officials
across the nation, prevailed when
the high court reversed a Ninth Cir
cuit Court of Appeals ruling.
Following the ruling, 18 separate
bills were introduced to the Con
gress, but none were acted on last
session. Both California and Illinois
have passed laws prohibiting police
searches of newspaper offices since
last May.
Daily Associate Editor Dan Fiduccia
commented:
"It's a good start, but the Carter
administration's good intentions are
overshadowed by the fact that if the
lustice Dept. had done its homework
ayearago, this would all beunneces
sary. The Justice Dept.'s strong op
position to the Daily caused the Sup
reme Court to adopt the govern
ment's arguments virtually verbatim.
"Now the administration has
abandoned its position because it fi
nally realized that its arguments are
so out of touch with history and real
ity," Fiduccia said.

"The Carter'administration has a
long way to go because the door is
still open for prosecutors to raid
every lawyer's office in America and
thereby destroy the attorney-client
privilege and a person's right to a fair
trial under the Constitution," he
said.
Fiduccia said at least two California
attorneys' offices have been
searched, one before and one after
the Court ruling.
