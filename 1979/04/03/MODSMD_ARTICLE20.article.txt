# The 						man in the 'computer castle'
## 
### Terry Lewis 
A sign on the door of room 255 in
Polya Hall reads, "See Dragon in 253."
The dragon to which the sign affection
ately refers is the seemingly over
burdened secretary of Denny Brown,
associate chairman of the Computer
Science Dept. Many of the students
who have been tactfully shuffled away
can attest that despite the lack of
treacherous claws and the ability to
breathe fire, she "guards" the adjoin
ing "castle" well. And for good reason.
Brown is a very busy man.
Inside the "castle" is Brown himself.
Amid piles of graded and yet-to-be
graded homework, he sits atop a swivel
chair, struggling with "the beast," his
office terminal. At the same time he
counsels a co-worker on an ongoing
project. Her questions answered, the
co-worker departs, and Brown puts
"the beast" to sleep. After retrieving his
attache case, the constant companion
which he absent-mindedly left in the
hall, he closes the porthole to the dra
gon's den. He is now ready to deal with
the present situation.
Like most professors here, Brown is
hard-pressed for time. As associate
chairman, he is responsible for course
assignments, securing instructors and
teaching assistants and planning and
preparing the department's col
loquium series. In addition he keeps
programs and student records up-to
date and, in general, "keeps the dean
happy."
Also, he must attend countless con
ferences and departmental meetings.
The couch and extra chair in Brown's
office are often occupied by problem
plagued coterminal, doctoral and
foreign students and by students with
incompletes whom he lists as one of his
"minor irritations."
Hassles
"Dealing with incompletes is such a
hassle," Brown says. "Even more so
with the department always changing.
My secretary often weeds out a lot of
them by taking their work and shooing
them away."
Recently assumed tasks include pre
paring for the department's move from
lordan Quad into Jordan Hall and set
ting up a new computer which was
jointly acquired with the electrical en
gineering and operations research de
partments.
What Brown says he enjoys most
about his job is teaching. His classes
include introduction to computing in
the fall and systematic programming in
the winter and spring.
"But teaching," Brown says, "isn't
really part of the job. It's more like
something that comes with it."
Still, it is something he seems to do
very well. Many students have said they
consider Brown to be the best lecturer
of the introductory courses.
Free-form lectures
As Keith Van Sickle, one of Brown's

CS 107 students, puts it: "His Icctures
are kind of free form. He comes in and
starts hacking away at the board. It's
actually kind of fun, but he's good."
With all else, it is easy to see why
Brown cites lack of time to concentrate
on specific areas of interest as a key
disappointment. One such area is
course development. Having been in
volved with the creation of CS 107 and
the "culture" course, "Computers —
Their Nature, Use and Impact," he dis
likes not being able to find time to fully
develop them.
"I taught 101 with Ed (Edward Feigen
baum, department chairman) several
years ago, but have been detached
from it since becoming associate
chairman," he explains. "I didn't really
have a chance to do it the way I
wanted."
Brown said he would also like more
time to find the ideal computer lan
guage for introductory computer
courses. During the past three years,
three different languages have been
used in the courses.
"I have a lot of ideas about language

features," Brown says, "but I haven't
had the time to write them out."
Kenny Rogers?
Brown looks very much like
country-western singer Kenny Rogers
in both face and build, except that his
hair is black, straight and receding.
Usually he dresses casually, favoring
blue denim overalls and warm-up suits.
He is instantly likeable and easy to get
along with.
Born November 3, 1946 and raised in
the St. Paul, Minnesota area, Brown's
interest in computers can be traced to
his father, who worked for Univac. But
it isn't your typical like-father-like-son
story.
"My father was in materials — handl
ing engineering and ran the company
softball team," Brown explains. "He
wanted me to play, but in order to play,
I had to work for Univac. So I started
out as a janitor there and worked my
way up."
Phi Beta Kappa
After turning down an appointment
to the U.S. Air Force Academy as a high

school senior, Brown attended the
University of Minnesota. He graduated
summa cum laude in 1968 with a
bachelor's degree in mathematics. He
is a member of the prestigious Phi Beta
Kappa.
Two years prior to graduating, he
married his high school sweetheart,
Mary Ann Jacobson. The couple has
two children: Pat, 10, and Lizi, 6.
Brown came to Stanford in 1968 as a
National Science Foundation Fellow
and began working on his Ph.D.
In 1975, Brown received an offer to
serve as a visiting professor at Mills Col
lege in Oakland. Feeling that he was
overstaying his welcome as a grad stu
dent, he accepted, and taught three
courses a semester in computer sci
ence and mathematics.
He returned here in the fall of 1976,
lured by the offer of his present posi
tion. He said a disinterest in research
has prolonged his doctoral work, but
he hopes to complete his dissertation
over spring vacation.
Frosh adviser
In addition to his other duties, Brown
serves as a freshman adviser at Otero in
Wilbur.
"I like personal interaction with folks
and freshman advising seemed to fit the
bill," Brown says. Robert Coleman, one
of Brown's former advisees, recalls:
"You should see him at parties! One
time he came dressed up as a motorcy
cle gang leader with leather and
chains."
Although Brown lists partying as a
favorite pastime, his primary interest is
sports. A little league coach and
member of the AAU and the North
California Handball Association, Brown
also enjoys running, having just re
cently completed the Paul Masson
Marathon with his wife.
But he is, and has always been, espe
cially fond of fast pitch Softball and
plays on a national level caliber. During
the summer of one of his grad student
years he played with a hometown team
which placed fifth in a national tourna
ment. He said he would very much like
to get a local team together that will
take him there again. That is one of few
ambitions Brown has.
"Ambition isn't one of my qualities. I
don't know whether it's a good or bad
one, but it isn't one of mine," Brown
says.
"I typically don't make long-term
plans. I usually just take the next thing
that comes along. My wife would like
for us to settle down while Pat goes
through high school. I expect to be
around here fora little while longer. . .
but, I don't know."
A knock at the door breaks Brown's
pensive spell and two students remind
him of a lunchtime engagement.
"Five minutes," he tells them and
then sits back in his chair to savor those
precious moments of relaxation before
returning to business as usual.

foreign students and by students with
incompletes whom he lists as one of his
"minor irritations."
Hassles
"Dealing with incompletes is such a
hassle," Brown says. "Even more so
with the department always changing.
My secretary often weeds out a lot of
them by taking their work and shooing
them away."
Recently assumed tasks include pre
paring for the department's move from
lordan Quad into Jordan Hall and set
ting up a new computer which was
jointly acquired with the electrical en
gineering and operations research de
partments.
What Brown says he enjoys most
about his job is teaching. His classes
include introduction to computing in
the fall and systematic programming in
the winter and spring.
"But teaching," Brown says, "isn't
really part of the job. It's more like
something that comes with it."
Still, it is something he seems to do
very well. Many students have said they
consider Brown to be the best lecturer
of the introductory courses.
Free-form lectures
As Keith Van Sickle, one of Brown's

CS 107 students, puts it: "His Icctures
are kind of free form. He comes in and
starts hacking away at the board. It's
actually kind of fun, but he's good."
With all else, it is easy to see why
Brown cites lack of time to concentrate
on specific areas of interest as a key
disappointment. One such area is
course development. Having been in
volved with the creation of CS 107 and
the "culture" course, "Computers —
Their Nature, Use and Impact," he dis
likes not being able to find time to fully
develop them.
"I taught 101 with Ed (Edward Feigen
baum, department chairman) several
years ago, but have been detached
from it since becoming associate
chairman," he explains. "I didn't really
have a chance to do it the way I
wanted."
Brown said he would also like more
time to find the ideal computer lan
guage for introductory computer
courses. During the past three years,
three different languages have been
used in the courses.
"I have a lot of ideas about language

features," Brown says, "but I haven't
had the time to write them out."
Kenny Rogers?
Brown looks very much like
country-western singer Kenny Rogers
in both face and build, except that his
hair is black, straight and receding.
Usually he dresses casually, favoring
blue denim overalls and warm-up suits.
He is instantly likeable and easy to get
along with.
Born November 3, 1946 and raised in
the St. Paul, Minnesota area, Brown's
interest in computers can be traced to
his father, who worked for Univac. But
it isn't your typical like-father-like-son
story.
"My father was in materials — handl
ing engineering and ran the company
softball team," Brown explains. "He
wanted me to play, but in order to play,
I had to work for Univac. So I started
out as a janitor there and worked my
way up."
Phi Beta Kappa
After turning down an appointment
to the U.S. Air Force Academy as a high

school senior, Brown attended the
University of Minnesota. He graduated
summa cum laude in 1968 with a
bachelor's degree in mathematics. He
is a member of the prestigious Phi Beta
Kappa.
Two years prior to graduating, he
married his high school sweetheart,
Mary Ann Jacobson. The couple has
two children: Pat, 10, and Lizi, 6.
Brown came to Stanford in 1968 as a
National Science Foundation Fellow
and began working on his Ph.D.
In 1975, Brown received an offer to
serve as a visiting professor at Mills Col
lege in Oakland. Feeling that he was
overstaying his welcome as a grad stu
dent, he accepted, and taught three
courses a semester in computer sci
ence and mathematics.
He returned here in the fall of 1976,
lured by the offer of his present posi
tion. He said a disinterest in research
has prolonged his doctoral work, but
he hopes to complete his dissertation
over spring vacation.
Frosh adviser
In addition to his other duties, Brown
serves as a freshman adviser at Otero in
Wilbur.
"I like personal interaction with folks
and freshman advising seemed to fit the
bill," Brown says. Robert Coleman, one
of Brown's former advisees, recalls:
"You should see him at parties! One
time he came dressed up as a motorcy
cle gang leader with leather and
chains."
Although Brown lists partying as a
favorite pastime, his primary interest is
sports. A little league coach and
member of the AAU and the North
California Handball Association, Brown
also enjoys running, having just re
cently completed the Paul Masson
Marathon with his wife.
But he is, and has always been, espe
cially fond of fast pitch Softball and
plays on a national level caliber. During
the summer of one of his grad student
years he played with a hometown team
which placed fifth in a national tourna
ment. He said he would very much like
to get a local team together that will
take him there again. That is one of few
ambitions Brown has.
"Ambition isn't one of my qualities. I
don't know whether it's a good or bad
one, but it isn't one of mine," Brown
says.
"I typically don't make long-term
plans. I usually just take the next thing
that comes along. My wife would like
for us to settle down while Pat goes
through high school. I expect to be
around here fora little while longer. . .
but, I don't know."
A knock at the door breaks Brown's
pensive spell and two students remind
him of a lunchtime engagement.
"Five minutes," he tells them and
then sits back in his chair to savor those
precious moments of relaxation before
returning to business as usual.


Denny Brown
A sign on the door of room 255 in
Polya Hall reads, "See Dragon in 253."
The dragon to which the sign affection
ately refers is the seemingly over
burdened secretary of Denny Brown,
associate chairman of the Computer
Science Dept. Many of the students
who have been tactfully shuffled away
can attest that despite the lack of
treacherous claws and the ability to
breathe fire, she "guards" the adjoin
ing "castle" well. And for good reason.
Brown is a very busy man.
Inside the "castle" is Brown himself.
Amid piles of graded and yet-to-be
graded homework, he sits atop a swivel
chair, struggling with "the beast," his
office terminal. At the same time he
counsels a co-worker on an ongoing
project. Her questions answered, the
co-worker departs, and Brown puts
"the beast" to sleep. After retrieving his
attache case, the constant companion
which he absent-mindedly left in the
hall, he closes the porthole to the dra
gon's den. He is now ready to deal with
the present situation.
Like most professors here, Brown is
hard-pressed for time. As associate
chairman, he is responsible for course
assignments, securing instructors and
teaching assistants and planning and
preparing the department's col
loquium series. In addition he keeps
programs and student records up-to
date and, in general, "keeps the dean
happy."
Also, he must attend countless con
ferences and departmental meetings.
The couch and extra chair in Brown's
office are often occupied by problem
plagued coterminal, doctoral and
foreign students and by students with
incompletes whom he lists as one of his
"minor irritations."

likes not being able to find time to fully
develop them.
"I taught 101 with Ed (Edward Feigen
baum, department chairman) several
years ago, but have been detached
from it since becoming associate
chairman," he explains. "I didn't really
have a chance to do it the way I
wanted."
Brown said he would also like more
time to find the ideal computer lan
guage for introductory computer
courses. During the past three years,
three different languages have been
used in the courses.
"I have a lot of ideas about language

features," Brown says, "but I haven't
had the time to write them out."
Kenny Rogers?
Brown looks very much like
country-western singer Kenny Rogers
in both face and build, except that his
hair is black, straight and receding.
Usually he dresses casually, favoring
blue denim overalls and warm-up suits.
He is instantly likeable and easy to get
along with.
Born November 3, 1946 and raised in
the St. Paul, Minnesota area, Brown's
interest in computers can be traced to
his father, who worked for Univac. But
it isn't your typical like-father-like-son
story.
"My father was in materials — handl
ing engineering and ran the company
softball team," Brown explains. "He
wanted me to play, but in order to play,
I had to work for Univac. So I started
out as a janitor there and worked my
way up."
Phi Beta Kappa
After turning down an appointment
to the U.S. Air Force Academy as a high

school senior, Brown attended the
University of Minnesota. He graduated
summa cum laude in 1968 with a
bachelor's degree in mathematics. He
is a member of the prestigious Phi Beta
Kappa.
Two years prior to graduating, he
married his high school sweetheart,
Mary Ann Jacobson. The couple has
two children: Pat, 10, and Lizi, 6.
Brown came to Stanford in 1968 as a
National Science Foundation Fellow
and began working on his Ph.D.
In 1975, Brown received an offer to
serve as a visiting professor at Mills Col
lege in Oakland. Feeling that he was
overstaying his welcome as a grad stu
dent, he accepted, and taught three
courses a semester in computer sci
ence and mathematics.
He returned here in the fall of 1976,
lured by the offer of his present posi
tion. He said a disinterest in research
has prolonged his doctoral work, but
he hopes to complete his dissertation
over spring vacation.
Frosh adviser
In addition to his other duties, Brown
serves as a freshman adviser at Otero in
Wilbur.
"I like personal interaction with folks
and freshman advising seemed to fit the
bill," Brown says. Robert Coleman, one
of Brown's former advisees, recalls:
"You should see him at parties! One
time he came dressed up as a motorcy
cle gang leader with leather and
chains."
Although Brown lists partying as a
favorite pastime, his primary interest is
sports. A little league coach and
member of the AAU and the North
California Handball Association, Brown
also enjoys running, having just re
cently completed the Paul Masson
Marathon with his wife.
But he is, and has always been, espe
cially fond of fast pitch Softball and
plays on a national level caliber. During
the summer of one of his grad student
years he played with a hometown team
which placed fifth in a national tourna
ment. He said he would very much like
to get a local team together that will
take him there again. That is one of few
ambitions Brown has.
"Ambition isn't one of my qualities. I
don't know whether it's a good or bad
one, but it isn't one of mine," Brown
says.
"I typically don't make long-term
plans. I usually just take the next thing
that comes along. My wife would like
for us to settle down while Pat goes
through high school. I expect to be
around here fora little while longer. . .
but, I don't know."
A knock at the door breaks Brown's
pensive spell and two students remind
him of a lunchtime engagement.
"Five minutes," he tells them and
then sits back in his chair to savor those
precious moments of relaxation before
returning to business as usual.
