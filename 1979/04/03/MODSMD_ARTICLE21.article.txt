Bitch: Sonatas for Violin and Harpsichord
David Oistrakh, violin. Hans Pischner,
harpsichord
DGG Privilege
I he Bach sonatas for violin and keyboard lan
guish in obscurity — relative to the unaccom
panied violin works, at least — perhaps partly be
cause they present performance problems. Does
one use a baroque violin with harpsichord, or
should one go for the grand manner with a "mod
ern" fiddle and piano?
Oistrakh and Pischner apparently stood bet
ween the two camps, throwing the harpsichord
bone to the buffs while still reveling in the roman
tic sonorities of a regular violin.
Since this recording is not always ideally ba
lanced as a result, logic would dictate the acquisi
tion of either an all-baroque (Melkus and Dreyfus
on Archive) or an all-modern (perhaps Laredo and
Gould on Columbia) version. But I, a fence-sitter
from way back, have to admit I enjoyed this set,
which is reasonably priced and attractively pac
kaged to boot.
Beethoven: Symphony No. 4
Royal Philharmonic. Antal Dorati, cond.
Mercury
Dorati made most of his famous Mercury re
cordings in the '50s, but this Beethoven was done
just a couple of years ago by DGG engineers. I
don't know why Mercury doesn't mention the
date, because the clear, natural recorded sound
will be this issue's primary selling point.
As regards interpretation, the playing of the

RPO is fine, but Dorati's conducting is rather
square, adhering well to the letter of the score but
not going beyond it. The disc is unusually well
pressed for the price, yet Karajan's earlier Berlin
Fourth will be too when it comes out soon on
Privilege.
An older recording of the "Egmont" overture
fills out the record. It shows Dorati's Beethoven in
a better light, adding some excitement to his basic
honesty, but it isn't really reason enough to buy
the record.
Beethoven: Symphony No. 9
Choir and Orchestra of Radio Denmark. Fritz
Busch, cond.
DGG Privilege
I hope it doesn't seem a backhanded compli
ment to say this record is much better than it might
have been; it's just that a recording of the Ninth
made live in 1950 with a semi-provincial orchestra
didn't seem very promising at first.
That it is so good is a credit, first, to the radio
engineers, who madea surprisingly well-balanced
and undistorted tape of the forces involved (this at
a time when some were still using 78s), and, sec
ond, to Busch, whose 18-year association with the
Danish orchestra had brought it to a consistently
high standard of performance.
Most listeners will still prefer the modern discs
by Karajan, Solti, or Stokowski (whose amazing
performance is, like Busch's, contained on one
disc). For my part, I hope this heralds more wide
spread distribution of DGG's other radio record
ings, including some of Furtwangler's Brahms sym
phonies and Schneiderhan's Beethoven concerto.

Mozart: Piano Concerto No. 25
Ivan Moravec, piano.
Czech Philharmonic. Joseph Vlach, cond.
Quintessence
Here is a cheap and cheerful disc of a work
which is one of the best, maybe the best, of
Mozart's late piano concertos. The recording was
made in 1973 (it was briefly available on the Van
guard label) and is better than any budget-price
competition, while the performance is more than
satisfactory!
Mozart: Marriage of Figaro
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, et al.
Berlin Radio Symphony. Ferenc Fricsay, cond.
DGG Privilege
Opera criticism is one of those areas where wise
angels fear to tread. Everyone reacts differently to
a singer's voice; for some, one wobbly soprano
can ruin a whole opera recording, while others
have become expert at throwing out the chaff to
get at the wheat.
Monetary considerations loom rather larger in
opera too — you have to buy a stack of records in
order to get anywhere. It almost suffices to say that
DGG's Figaro reissue is the only one at less than
full price to come with a libretto and well-made
pressings.
The singing is generally good, the young
Fischer-Dieskau's characterization of the Count
being a highlight, but the recording seems a bit
faded now. Fricsay's was the first Figaro in stereo,
along with Eric Kleiber's famous set which badly
needs reissue on a cheaper label.
