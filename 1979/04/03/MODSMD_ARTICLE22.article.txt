# Classy Chappie

Once upon a time, the
Chaparral was a racist, sexist
so-called humor magazine that
published semi-whenever.
However, it has been trans
formed into a publication that
is genuinely funny, and,
perhaps more significantly, a
publication with class.
It has somehow managed to
attract a collection of fine ar
tists and writers, and is today
ranked (as of the Little 11 con
ference) as the best college
humor magazine in the United
States, outdistancing such
traditional favorites as The
Harvard Lampoon, The Cornell
Lunatic and The Columbia les
ter. The current issue of the
Chaparral is their finest effort
this year, and that is saying
something.
The lead story is a parody of
World War II comics, featuring
a hard boiled Vietnamese sol
dier, Sergeant Rok. The
artwork, done by Perry Vas
quez is easily of professional
quality, and makes one won
der why he is still on campus.
Vasquez is just one of the
Chappies stable of gifted illus
trators, which also includes Jim
Holder, Amy Levenson, Bill Fox
and Paul Krieg.
The writers try hard to keep
pace with the artists and usu

ally succeed. Rookie Doug
Stiener directs some well
placed jibes at an often mis
handled subject, Gerald Ford,
and veteran scribe Jay Martel
poignantly welcomes the
reader to Disney's newest at
traction, "Seventies Land."
"Graduation '75," a bofto
piece by undeclared freshman
Steve Kessler, cuts deep at the
typical high school mores that
we all grew up with.
Unfortunately, some of the
writing fails at times, not so
much on its own lack of merit,
but pales in comparison with
some of the other efforts. Jack
Trumpbour's "Body Politic" is
a stale, stilted attempt at
Buchwaldean humor, and Mar
tel's second effort, "Human
Consciousness of the Seven
ties," looks as if it was hastily
thrown together.
The cartoons are excellent.
Dave Lyon, Dan Olivas and
Wily expose the reader to their
own foibles. Dave Sahlin's
photo story is also a winner.
In fact, the whole issue, with
minor exceptions, is a winner.
Editor Bruce Handy has skillfully
put together a product that ful
fills the promise of what was
formerly only an unpolished
jem, The Stanford Chaparral.
