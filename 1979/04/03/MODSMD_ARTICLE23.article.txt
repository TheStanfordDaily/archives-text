Terrorists attack U.S. embassy
Beirut, Lebanon — Two rocket-propelled grenades hit
the U.S. Embassy yesterday but officials said no one was
hurt and damage was minor. The attack came amid in
creasing Arab hostility to the United States for its role in
arranging the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
Eyewitnesses said two young unidentified men fired
the grenades yesterday from high in a building 150 yards
from the embassy that overlooks the Mediterranean
coast in West Beirut. The men escaped in a small car, the
witnesses said.
Palestinian leaders have threatened to attack "Ameri
can interests" in the Middle East because of the key U.S.
role in bringing about an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
But none of the Palestinian factions based here
claimed responsibility fortheassault, and sources inside
the movement dismissed the incident as unworthy, both
in scope and purpose.
It has been learned from reliable Lebanese sources
that the government here won an agreement last week
from Palestinians and leftist Lebanese groups to refrain
from attacking U.S. citizens or property in Beirut be
cause of the already fragile security situation.
However, even if a guerrilla or a militia organization
did not sponsor the attack, observers here believe the
heated climate created by the current anti-American
campaign encouraged the incident.
Idi Amin inspects bombed town
Nairobi, Kenya — President Idi Amin made a surprise
appearance in Jinja after a raid yesterday by Tanzanian
jets on Uganda's second largest city, residents reported.
Startled townspeople at Jinja, 50 miles east of the
Ugandan capital of Kampala, said shortly after the morn
ing raid by two MiG-21 jet fighters Amin appeared and
ordered panicking people to return to work.
Exiles in Nairobi said they suspect Amin has been
staying in Jinja, 50 miles east of Kampala, which is the
headquarters of Libyan troops aiding Amin and site of
the Magamaga Ordnance Depot.
Anti-nuke groups protest abroad
Anti-nuclear groups staged demonstrations yesterday
in Japan and West Germany while a Soviet commentator
said the U.S. nuclear accident that prompted the pro
tests was a consequence of American capitalistic
"energy monopolies" hunting for profits at all costs.
Opponents of nuclear power held peaceful demonst
rations in Hamburg, West Germany, and Ikata and

Shaga, Japan.
In Japan, second only to the United States in the use of
nuclear power, several hundred persons demonstrated
yesterday for a suspension of operations at nuclear
facilities. The demonstrators said radiation leaks at the
U.S. facility show nuclear power is dangerous.
A leading member of the ruling Social Democratic
Party of West Germany said the country must reevaluate
its plans for nuclear power expansion and suspend work
on a new plant similar to the U.S. facility.
Begin makes state visit to Cairo
Cairo, Egypt — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
raised his glass yesterday and said "hallelujah" forpeace
in a toast to his former enemy, Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat. He called on Arab treaty opponents "to relinquish
that futile negativism."
The first state visit to Egypt by an Israeli leader was
preceded by a mass exodus of Arab ambassadors from
Cairo and imposition of Arab political and economic
sanctions to punish Sadat for signing the peace treaty in
Washington last week.
Begin, in a prepared text, said he was convinced that
"in Cod's good time" the other Arabs would join in the
search for a peaceful settlement to 30 years of war and
hostility.
Arab outrage at the treaty signing cast a shadow over
Begin's visit, with some Egyptians suggesting he should
have waited until Egypt had recovered from the
"psychological shock" of seeing Arab mooerates join
hardliners in an attempt to punish Sadat.
The state-controlled news media and public de
monstrated little enthusiasm for Begin's 28-hour visit,
chiefly because of the tough bargaining stance he took
during the negotiations.
