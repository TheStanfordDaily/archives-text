# Faculty Senate to consider report on discrimination in research contracts
## 
### Seth Zuckerman 
A committee report to the Faculty
Senate that urges the University to
try to reduce citizenship-based dis
crimination against students will be
considered by the senate on Thurs
day.
The discrimination is alleged to
have taken place because the Uni
versity h<js agreed to perform re
search for foreign countries which
will not admit citizens of certain na
tions. The research often requires
the researchers to travel to the spon
soring countries.
Most nations restrict entry of
aliens on the basis of citizenship, ac
cording to a University press release.
The Committee on Research re
commended that the University try
to reduce this discrimination by es
tablishing an advisory panel to re
view project proposals which might
infringe academic freedom in this re
spect. The panel would weigh factors
in favor of and against the suggested
research and advise the vice-provost
and dean of research whether to ac
cept the foreign country's proposal.
The office of the assistant provost
for research referred the question to
the committee last year.
The committee's task was to "pro
duce a set of guidelines to reduce or
eliminate discrimination" in re
search contracts, according to
Chemistry Prof. Richard Holm, its

chairman.
He said the compnittee faced only
questions relating to contracts that
require travel to the sponsoring
countries. The University has long
refused to accept contracts which
would force it to discriminate among
personnel working on foreign
sponsored research on campus, he
said.
Holm said the committee's report
was drawn up in line with two basic
principles: universal access to all re
search done through the University
and the faculty's right to seek sup
port for their research from any
reasonable source.
According to the University public
relations office the advisory panel
the committee proposed would con
sider the following criteria in deter
mining whether the research is in the
best interests of the University:
— The probability and the extent
of the discrimination;
— How reasonable it would be —
reasonable discrimination would in
clude the exclusion of enemy aliens
in wartime;
— The benefits the sponsoring
country would derive from the pro
ject;
— The benefits to participating fa
culty;
— The necessity of doing the re
search in that particular country, and
— The interests of students in

being able to participate in all Uni
versity activities.
The Faculty Senate rejected a simi
lar recommendation submitted in
February. The senate was concerned
that the students' right to participate
in all research being conducted by
the University was being over
protected at the expense of the pro
fessors' right to engage in varied re
search, said Terry Nipp, a student
merpber of the committee.
Biochemistry Prof. A. Dale Kaiser,
a committee member, said "different
people had different objections" to
the first plan. He said he perceived
the major one as a reluctance to state
that the University had a policy on
this type of discrimination. It was
unwilling to formulate a policy be
cause "this way it is not necessary to
determine one and it is simpler not to
face the problem," he said.
The first version contained a flat
prohibition on research which might
discriminate against some students
here because of their citizenship, ac
cording to a University press release.
Kaiser also said senate members
feared a blanket policy statement
against citizenship-based discrimina
tion because it would bind the Uni
versity in other fields, such as foreign
student admissions. Dean William
Kayes of the School of Engineering
held this view.
