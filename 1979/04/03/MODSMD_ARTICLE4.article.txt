# Television has its day in court

Dramatic scenarios about cour
troom lawyers may be standard fare
on television, but many real-life
lawyers are not enthusiastic about
the prospect of television cameras in
the courtroom.
Although our society is increas
ingly dominated by the electronic
media, the U.S. Supreme Court has
never directly confronted the issue
of televised court trials. Currently,
the American Bar Association (ABA)
reports that electronic media devices
are allowed in trial and appellate
courts in 1S states and in appellate
courts alone in another seven states.
Trial and appellate courts have been
"on the air" in Colorado for the past
23 years.
The 1965 Supreme Court decision
of the Billie Sol Estes swindling case,
Estes v. Texas, provides the most
celebrated opinion concerning the

involvement of television in court
proceedings. The Court declared a
mistrial because of the "circus" at
mosphere created by unrestricted
and overly exuberant cameramen.
At the ABA's February meeting in
Atlanta, the same concerns expres
sed in the Estes decision were once
again debated. The lawyers there
were apparently convinced by the
Supreme Court's arguments, as they
voted overwhelmingly to reject a
proposal to lift their traditional ban
on television in courtrooms, as con
tained in their Canons of Judicial
Ethics.
Questioned relevance
Law professors here, however,
questioned the relevance of the Estes
decision for courtrooms today and
contended that the impact of
cameras in the courtroom need not
be that extreme.
In the Opinion of the Court of the
Estes case, justice Tom Clark wrote

that the use of television "cannot be
said to contribute materially to the
chief function of our judicial
machinery," which is to ascertain the
truth.
Clark expressed fears that the
broadcast media could adversely af
fect the impartiality of jurors, the
quality of witnesses' testimony, the
responsibilities of the oftimes
elected trial judge and the privacy
rights of the defendant.
Thus, the accused's Sixth and
Fourteenth Amendment due process
rights to a fair trial could be violated
by the presence of television in a
criminal courtroom, according to
then-Chief justice Warren in a con
curring opinion.
An 'ought' proposition
But, as Law Prof. Charles Marson
pointed out, the ban on television
is "an 'ought' proposition on the part
of the ABA," contingent upon state
laws. Law Prof. John Kaplan said that
television in courtrooms "is going to
happen, ABA or not, and it will not be
a big deal."
"The truth, for those of us who
have seen television in courtrooms,"
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal said, "is
that after the early stages of the trial,
the television cameras are virtually
forgotten." Except for the people di
rectly involved in a case, lawsuits are
"very boring" and would probably
not attract a lot of attention, Frie
denthal said.
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn
argued along the same lines but em
phasized that, although rumors of
sleeping jurors and even judges may
in fact be true, television would want
the "juicy, purple passages (like) the
Patty Hearst trial.
"If the public only sees the Perry
Mason-type action when only the
dramatic is stressed, people may be
interested, but they won't under
stand" the legal system, Horn said.
Small adjustment
Marson contended that television
would only be an incremental ad
justment from the current "40 repor
ters and three sketch artists" system.
"My argument is that it's better for
the public to get their information
first-hand because it will get out
anyway," he explained. "I have real
reservations as to the impact of TV on
the legal process, but I can see sub
stantial First Amendment values in
it."

Bailey's performance in the Hearst

case, said "so many cases are tried in
the press that it would really be a
minor step between media participa
tion just outside the door of the cour
troom" and direct participation in
the courtroom.
Showboat temptation
"Lawyers without clients on a re
tainerthat need advertising would be
strongly tempted to showboat and to
misbehave at the cost of their
clients," Kaplan said.
Second-year law student Mark
Feather agreed with the ABA deci
sion but said that he would not be
affected in court by television
cameras. "Face it, you're a profes
sional, paid for one reason: to repre
sent your client as best you can," he
said. "If you can't do that, if you are
influenced by TV cameras, you have
no right being a trial attorney."
Marson said that a "lawyer is al
ways torn between the duty to a
client and the duty to his continuing
relations with the court," anyway.
"Television might exacerbate that to
a degree, but these are conundrums
which are nearly impossible to re
solve."
Friedenthal, while noting the pos
sibility of problems, said, "I don't
think that it is necessary to have an
absolute or complete ban. In my
view, judges should have the power
to make the determination in each
particular case," as to the advisability
of the use of television.
Friedenthal asserted that "we
don't want to create another line of
appeal, but I think we should let it
(television in courtrooms) go for
ward carefully and with proper re
straints. If it is abused, the rules can
then be changed. Problems don't
seem to have arisen in states that
have had it."
Marson concluded, "I would
rather put discretion in the judges'
hands than in the ABA's."
