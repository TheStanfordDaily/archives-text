# Alumni glorify Doodles Weaver antics
## 
### Ellie Williams 
Have you heard the one
about the time they found a
Model A Ford at the top of
Hoover Tower? It turned out
Doodles Weaver had taken
apart his car and hauled the
parts up the tower where he
reassembled it before morn
ing-

Doodles had a keg mounted behind the
driver's seat with tubes leading to the front
seat so he and his passengers could drink
beer while driving.

Or how about the time Doo
dles put on a bra and wig and
leaned out the Beta house
window screaming "Help me!
I'm being attacked!"?
These stories are part of my
childhood. As the daughter
of a tormer Stanford Rally
Commissioner, I was raised on
Big Game bonfires, rallies at
Zots, and of course, Doodles
Weaver.
Yet when I exchange Doo
dles Weaver stories with other
children of alumni, we find
theyare rarely the same. Inone
case Doodles is the fraternity
brother of a 1930 alumnus; in
another he is the roommate of
a 1960 graduate.
Who actually was this Stan
ford legend and what antics did
he really mastermind?
Winstead Sheffield Weaver
came to the University in the
1930s from a fashionable, weal
thy los Angeles family. His
early years were filled with par-

ties in their 20-room house,
and it seems that Doodles was
an entertainer even then. "By
the time I was in high school I'd
had 15 years of partying and
had gotten into the habit of
doing crazy little things," he
said in a 1968 interview with the
Palo Alto Times.
And Doodles' "crazy little

things" were often quite spec
tacular while he was a student
here during the '30s.
Although Doodles did not
really reassemble his car at the
top of Hoover Tower, he did
take the hood off one car and
the seats out of another and set
them in front of his room to
surprise his roommates when
they returned from vacation.
In fact, he probably would
have been hesitant to disas
semble his own car as it was
quite distinctive. According to
Frederic Glover, former sec
retary to the University, Doo
dles had a tank mounted be
hind the driver's seat with
tubes leading to the front seat
so he and his passengers could
drink beer while driving.
This built-in keg was not the
car's only unusual feature, for
Doodles could also steer it with
his feet. Clover recalls seeing
him drive up the Kow, discon
nect the car's visible steering

wheel and throw it onto the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house
lawn.
Doodles skirmished a few
times with the Palo Alto police
in this car, yet former Palo Alto
police chief Cordon Davis
seems to have remembered
Doodles' antics with more
amusement than scorn. During
a 1968 interview, Davis told
about the time he stopped
Doodles for driving backward
on local streets. When ques
tioned about this aberrant be
havior, Doodles explained that
he had been going down to the
newsstand to get a paper, and
since the car was rented, he
was driving it backward to save
mileage.
Authorities were probably
not as good natured the day a
Los Altos cemetery reported
five cupids missing. Clover re
calls that five Kappas had been
reprimanded by school offi
cials and the following morn
ing the campus awoke to find
five freshly dug graves on the
Kappa house lawn. There were
the missing cupids, serving as
headstones, each one painted
to resemble a punished Kappa.
Although it was never proven,
most students believed that
Doodles was responsible for
this prank, for as Clover says,
"only Doodles would have
gone to the trouble to commit
a felony for a practical joke."
However, in the same Palo
Alto Times interview Doodles
said he was never a practical
joker. "I was an entertainer
and I was far from mild."
Doodles was a "masterful
pianist," Clover recalls, and he

saved the show at one Big
Game Gaieties. According to
Glover, a storm suddenly blew
out the lights, but Doodles
"simply sat at the piano and en
tertained the crowd with one
number after another. It was a
superb performance."
After graduating from Stan
ford, Doodles continued in the
entertainment field. He be
came a member of the Spike
Jones Orchestra and later went
on to perform in many Las
Vegas shows, 150 feature films
and countless TV episodes.
But Doodles said he believes
that the earlier days entertain
ing the campus have hampered
his career. He complained that
because of the legends about
him, producers and directors
do not take him seriously, and
his audiences are more con
cerned with his past than with
his present performances.
"All anyone wants to talk
about is what I did at Stanford.

No one ever asks Ann-Margret
where she went to school," he
said.
Moreover, many of the
pranks accredited to him dis
turb Doodles. Among these is
the legend that he bought a
horse from the g!ue factory,
took it to the second floor of
Encina Hall and shot it."I really
don't like that story. I love ani
mals ... I never did anything
to hurt anyone," he said.
Although boisterous, his
jokes do indeed appear to have
been more gentle and teasing
than destructive and malici
ous. Many were quite inven
tive, imbued with his intellec
tual and musical talents.
Perhaps it is for this sophistica
tion that he is revered by alum
ni, who embellish his jokes
with their own glorious es
capades, and pass on his
legend to our generation as
part of a proud Stanford tradi
tion.
