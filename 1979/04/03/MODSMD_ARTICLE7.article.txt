KZSU's new Herstory, a
program designed to look at
issues from a woman's point
of view, will "go under" if it
does not receive more stu
dent assistance, according
to Alison Wrigley, one of
two women working on the
show.
A month old, the program
has only two members on
staff, Wrigley said. Adver
tisements for additional
help have received little re
sponse.
Another problem the
program faces is lack of
feedback on the programs
already aired. "The show is
still developing," said Judy
Fifield, a producer of the

show. "And it should de
velop the way that the audi
ence wants it to. But to do
that we need audience
feedback."
Herstory deals with cur
rent issues concerning
women and features
women who have ac
complished something
noteworthy, although both
men and women are inter
viewed. The program is try
ing to "contribute to wo
men's progress," according
to the producers.
The program started be
cause producers felt there
was an audience for it and
that they had people in
terested in working on it,
Fifield said.
