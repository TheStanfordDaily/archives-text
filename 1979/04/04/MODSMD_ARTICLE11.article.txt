## Attention focused on South Africa 
### 
The following words were
written by James Matthews, a
South African black, who de
scribes himself as "a man of no
account, who refuses to remain
silent at all the injustices done
td blacks." They were written
in 1972 but unfortunately are
just as true today.
"South Africa is a country of
great physical beauty but its
soul is dead, strangulated by an
ideology based on color where
to be white enables you to
enjoy the goodness of the land
and if black, you would be bet
ter off dead. The whites of
South Africa are afflicted with a
sickness that blinds them to
the suffering of the rest of us,
blacks.
} "In Dimbaza and other re
settlement areas, infants
perish like seedlings destroyed
by frost because of the poverty
in resettlement areas. Com
munities are shifted from areas
which they have occupied for
decades to wasteland areas.
"Love has t , become an
obscenity if black loves .white
and criminal if white and black
are caught in the act. Blacks of
all shades suffer, but those
whose backs are never free of

the lash are my brothers who
are forced to carry a pass and
parted from their womenfolk.
They have been stripped of all
dignity, men-oxen contracted
to work the land, to die in the
mines to further enrich white
supremacy. Castrated bulls.
"For blacks, to be born and
to live in South Africa is like
living through a nightmare
where words have different
connotations because of pig
mentation. Democracy is one
of the ruling principles of white
South Africa; it spells tyranny
for blacks who do not "enjoy
democratic rights shared by
whites.
"It is claimed South Africa is
a Christian country and yet
black fellow-Christians are de
nied Cod's gifts; even
churches practice discrimina
tion when black priests are
paid less fordoing Cod's work.
Freedom has a hollow ring
when one is not free to live
where one wants and when
one needs a permit to travel
across the land and when one
is not able to engage in the pro
fession of one's choice. All this
done by Christian upholders of
Western civilization."

Although much news about
South Africa has appeared in
the U.S. press, many Ameri
cans remain shockingly ignor
ant about what life in South Af
rica is like for blacks — and this
ignorance extends even to the
undergraduate population
here. The week of April 4 to 11
has been designated a week of
concern for South Africa.
In spite of announced U.S.
government opposition to the
apartheid policies of South Af
rica, the fact is that there are
strong economic links bet
ween the two countries. There
is a total of $1.8 billion of U.S.
investments in South Africa,
representing 19 percent of
total foreign investment in
South Africa.
In addition, U.S. banks have
loans in South Africa totalling
over $2 billion and represent
ing one-third of all foreign
loans to South Africa. It is dif
ficult to imagine a more direct
form of support for apartheid.
On the local front, both Bank
of America and Wells Fargo
have loans to the South African
government and
government-owned agencies,
and yet Stanford owns stocks

in these banks and has large
accounts in each of them, as
well as owning stock in many of
the hundreds of U.S. corpora
tions with investments in
South Africa.
We think it is fair to say that
the University's efforts at per
suading these companies to
change their policies toward
South Africa have been mini
mal.
We hope that people will
take advantage of events
scheduled during this week to
educate themselves about
South Africa and to decide
what they think the policy of
U.S. corporations and banks
toward South Africa should be.
Tomorrow the film Last Grave
at Dimbaza will be shown here.
This film, shot in South A'-ica
and now banned there, is only
an hour long, but depicts very
movingly what life is like for
blacks there.
I his Friday, several members
of the Memorial Church South
Africa Task Force will talk and
answer questions on a KQED
FM radio program. Next Tues
day night South African black
Dumisani kumalo will talk here
on conditions under apartheid
and the role of U.S. corporate
involvement in South Africa.
Kumalo fled South Africa in
1977 after having been a jour
nalist since 1965. He founded
the Union of Black Journalists
and worked for The Post
Newspapers, The World, and
as a chief reporter for the
Johannesburg Sunday Times
Extra (black edition).
Later in the month a perfor
mance of Survival! will be given
by the authors, who are South
African blacks now in exile.
we watch through the window
as they sit feasting
at a table loaded with equality
and grow frantic at its flavour
how long can we contain the
rumble
of hunger in our belly?

Although much news about
South Africa has appeared in
the U.S. press, many Ameri
cans remain shockingly ignor
ant about what life in South Af
rica is like for blacks — and this
ignorance extends even to the
undergraduate population
here. The week of April 4 to 11
has been designated a week of
concern for South Africa.
In spite of announced U.S.
government opposition to the
apartheid policies of South Af
rica, the fact is that there are
strong economic links bet
ween the two countries. There
is a total of $1.8 billion of U.S.
investments in South Africa,
representing 19 percent of
total foreign investment in
South Africa.
In addition, U.S. banks have
loans in South Africa totalling
over $2 billion and represent
ing one-third of all foreign
loans to South Africa. It is dif
ficult to imagine a more direct
form of support for apartheid.
On the local front, both Bank
of America and Wells Fargo
have loans to the South African
government and
government-owned agencies,
and yet Stanford owns stocks

in these banks and has large
accounts in each of them, as
well as owning stock in many of
the hundreds of U.S. corpora
tions with investments in
South Africa.
We think it is fair to say that
the University's efforts at per
suading these companies to
change their policies toward
South Africa have been mini
mal.
We hope that people will
take advantage of events
scheduled during this week to
educate themselves about
South Africa and to decide
what they think the policy of
U.S. corporations and banks
toward South Africa should be.
Tomorrow the film Last Grave
at Dimbaza will be shown here.
This film, shot in South A'-ica
and now banned there, is only
an hour long, but depicts very
movingly what life is like for
blacks there.
I his Friday, several members
of the Memorial Church South
Africa Task Force will talk and
answer questions on a KQED
FM radio program. Next Tues
day night South African black
Dumisani kumalo will talk here
on conditions under apartheid
and the role of U.S. corporate
involvement in South Africa.
Kumalo fled South Africa in
1977 after having been a jour
nalist since 1965. He founded
the Union of Black Journalists
and worked for The Post
Newspapers, The World, and
as a chief reporter for the
Johannesburg Sunday Times
Extra (black edition).
Later in the month a perfor
mance of Survival! will be given
by the authors, who are South
African blacks now in exile.
we watch through the window
as they sit feasting
at a table loaded with equality
and grow frantic at its flavour
how long can we contain the
rumble
of hunger in our belly?

The following words were
written by James Matthews, a
South African black, who de
scribes himself as "a man of no
account, who refuses to remain
silent at all the injustices done
td blacks." They were written
in 1972 but unfortunately are
just as true today.
"South Africa is a country of
great physical beauty but its
soul is dead, strangulated by an
ideology based on color where
to be white enables you to
enjoy the goodness of the land
and if black, you would be bet
ter off dead. The whites of
South Africa are afflicted with a
sickness that blinds them to
the suffering of the rest of us,
blacks.
