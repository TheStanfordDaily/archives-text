## Nestle answers criticism 
### 
A recent column by Cathy
Cewertz about the use of baby
formula in the Third World was
a one-sided presentation of a
complex issue and an over
simplification of the problem
of malnutrition whose roots
reach into the overwhelming
poverty and hunger of de
veloping countries.
In attacking Nestle lor sup
posed unethical marketing and
promotional practices,
Cewertz made no attempt to
check the accuracy of her facts
and premises or even to de
termine Nestle's view of this is
sue.
As a matter of fact, Cewertz
distorted the testimony given
by Dr. Oswald Ballarin, chair
man of the board and presi
dent of Nestle-Brazil, at last
year's Senate hearings. If the
full testimony had been re

printed, it would have been
obvious that Dr. Ballarin tes
tified that Nestle could not be
responsibleforcleaning up the
water supplies in developing
countries.
To ensure that its infant for
mula products do play a posi
tive role in the health of in
fants, Nestle has adopted
policies which concentrate on
educating mothers on the
superiority of breast milk and
on the proper use of formula
products. The labels on all Nes
tle formula products contain
statements that breast milk is
the best food for an infant and
carry written and pictorial in
structions for proper use.
A limited amount of formula
is provided to doctors, hospi
tals and government health or
ganizations. We are convinced
that these health professionals

are the best judges of the nutri
tional needs of mother and
child and are the proper inter
mediary between industry and
infant formula users.
On occasion, Nestle is re
quested to provide formula or
medical equipment to mis
sionaries and orphanages.
Each request is studied care
fully to determine if it would be
beneficial to the community as
a whole. If the request is
reasonable, Nestle donates
these items.
The idea that Nestle has
"stepped up promotion" is ab
surd. Nestle does no consumer
advertising of formula pro
ducts in developing countries.
The vast majority of Nestle
infant formula is purchased by
middle- and upper-income
families who can afford the
product and use it properly.
It is in the rural areas of de
veloping nations, where no
formula is available to supple
ment breast milk, that the in
fant mortality rates remain at a
shockingly high level of 50 per
cent during the first five years
of life.
This problem remains de
spite the fact that infant mortal
ity throughou ihe Third World
has been declining steadily
over the past 30 years. The
problem deserves the att i
tion of everyone.
Nestle m es every effort to
respond t< reasonable criti
cism of its practices. Over the
years it has continually re
viewed and revised its policies
so that abuses will not occur.
However, it b: »ves its pro
duct has a valic; ind healthful
place in infant diets, as mis
sionaries and medical people
in the Third World will attest.
The problems of hunger,
malnourishment, unclean
water and poverty go far
