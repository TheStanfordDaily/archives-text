## Michael Economides Armenians remembered 
### 
Rarely has a nation suffered
much as Armenia and sur
vived. Although man's inhu
manity to man reached an apex
with the escapades of Nazi
Germany, 30 years earlier over
one and a half million Arme
nians perished at the hands of
the Turks.
The precedent of the Arme
nian massacre and the reaction
to it did not escape Adolf Hitler
who, upon invading Poland in
1939, declared: "I have given
orders ... to exterminate
without mercy or pity men,
women and children of the
Polish race. . . . After all who
today remembers the extermi
nation of the Armenians?"
April is the month to re
member the "unremembered
genocide." Beyond the
eulogies it is an opportunity to
think of the Armenians. A
proud and resurgent nation,
they have lived through in
numerable struggles, tribula
tions and diaspora in two and a
half millenia of history.
Although their language is
Indo-European the Armenians
are descendants of ancient
tribes who inhabited ancient
Anatolia. The land known as
Great Armenia comprises a
large area of mountainous
country that includes most of
Eastern Anatolia.
Fatally located at the cross
roads between East and West
Armenia was stormed by invad
ing hordes: Saracens, Seljuks,
Mongols, Tartars and, last, the
Ottoman Turks. Vet the Arme
nian culture has survived.
Soviet Armenia today en
compasses less than 10 percent
of the territory of Great Ar
menia. In Turkey, maps

exclude all mention of Ar
menia, names of administra
tive districts divide the area
and Armenian names have
been replaced by Turkish.
The changes did not involve
only semantics. In the course
of a quarter century, between
1895 and 1920, the Armenian
nation lost a million and a half
persons by the gun, bayonet,
deliberate starvation and pesti
lence. No Armenian home
today is free of memories of
this holocaust.
In 1908 the Young Turk re
volution removed the
medieval vestiges of the sultan
of Turkey. The new Turkish

leaders were received with
jubilation by Armenians and
other minorities who were
promised equality undera new
constitution.
Simultaneously, a Turkish
nationalist ideology — pan-
Turkism — was forming that
would have fatal effects on the
Armenians. Serge Zenkovsky
describes the ideology: "First
the Ottoman Turks had to con
solidate their grip over the em
pire and Turkicize its
minorities. In the second
phase . . the closest relatives
of the Turks . . . were to be
taken into the Turkic state. The
third step would be the uniting
of all Turanian peoples of Asia
around the Turkish core."
The Armenians found them

selves in the middle of Turkish
nationalist fever. The eruption
of World War I gave the pretext
for their annihilation. Turkish
apologists often claim that
measures against the Arme
nians were forced upon the
Young Turks because the en
tire Armenian population was a
dangerous "fifth column,",
sympathetic to the West. No
evidence is offered by the
Turks for this contention, nor
for the second argument that
the Armenians started massacr
ing Turks in 1915.
Mass deportations and
executions, open-air concent
ration camps and outrageous

attacks by mobs marked the
first genocide in modern his
tory, long before the phrase
was coined. War-weary Europe
and the otherwise-attractive
Young Turks and their charis
matic leader Kemal Ataturk
prevented widespread outcry
over the atrocities.
Yet the Armenians over
came. In theirdiaspora they th
rived. The list of Armenians
that excelled in all facets of soc
iety in their adopted countries
is endless. The tragic
memories of April 1915 simul
taneously evoke feelings of
admiration for a proud and re
silient nation.
