## Sex roles in medical game 
### 
Feminism can help us evaluate the honesty,
fullness and balance in our own interpersonal
relationships, and gaining insight into other re
lationships in our lives often taken for granted.
For example, the impact of a feminist perspec
tive on the physician-patient relationship is tre
mendous.
Recently, concern has grown over patients'
rights such as the right to privacy and informed
consent. Medicine and medical language have
concurrently been mystified. In addition, we
have long been aware of most doctors' brusque,
clinical manner during medical visits. But what is
really going on within the traditional doctor
patient relationship?
Sex-role conditioning has successfully in
vaded the physician-patient relationship, only in
this case the participants need not be a man and
a woman. The analogy is convincing down to
specific behavior traits. To the doctor we ascribe
coolness, objectivity, confidence, assertive
ness, in short, power. The patient, in an unfor
tunate predominance of cases, lays claim only to
passivity, insecurity, ignorance and emotional
vulnerability to the seeming insensitivity of the
physician — powerlessness.
Such conditioned behavior comes as no sur
prise. The professionalization (but not necessar
ily the practice) of health care in this country
originated with men, and men still comprise the
great majority of physicians here. Stereotypi
cally male" characteristics — with a new tech
nical twist — were transferred to the role of
physician.

Even women physicians have difficulty com
batting this kind of conditioning. It can be so
subtle and long-term that it is not even recog
nized, or if it is recognized, is reluctantly ac
cepted as a necessary prerequisite to playing the
medical "game" and becoming successful. The
loss in human resources (patience, sensitivity
and receptiveness), due to this conditioning is
overwhelming.
Some fear a decline in medical competence
with the removal of the "professional air" of the
physician. They also argue that the physician's
customary disposition — that serious, all
knowing mask — actually inspires confidence in
the patient.
But by removing the veneer of profes
sionalism, we do not threaten important qual
ities of the physician beneath: substantial medi
cal knowledge (to be shared whenever possi
ble), discipline, perseverance and the ability to
embrace the concept of "necessary pain"
(rather than complete desensitization to it).
Medical expertise will still exist and flourish.
Ehrenreich and English have written, "We must
never confuse professionalism with expertise.
Expertise is something to work forand to share;
professionalism is — by definition — elitist and
exclusive, sexist, racist and classist." This dis
tinction is essential to bring about social change
which feminist analysis dictates.
