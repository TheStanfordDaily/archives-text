Zero-base firing
Over the last five years, and
particularly within the last six
months, I have listened to
tragic tales of techniques some
supervisors have used to
eliminate employees here, or
cause them to resign. The most
frequent techniques for elimi
nation recently have been
harassment, arbitrariness and
lying. Management has found
these techniques inefficient
because the victims usually try
to prevent their elimination by
filing a grievance or a suit.
A new technique for elimina
tion is now under experimen
tation. It is called Zero-Base
Budgeting (ZBB). With the risk
of oversimplification, this
budget process requires that
managers justify all of their
budget projections each year,
rather than have assumptions
made about any aspect of
them; 788 obviously provides
.inopporti iityandar : Irnt'e
to trim the oudgt
Normally, this is a legitimate
budgetary process; however,
some argue Stanford is not
normal in personnel affairs. I
am of the opinion that ZBB is
being (and will probably be)
clandestinely manipulated to
eliminate certain employees —
not because their jobs are

without budgetary justifica
tion, but because the man
agement does not like them.
With adroit utilization of ZBB,
no longer will supervisors have
to fabricate and lie in eliminat
ing unliked employees; the
"unliked" can just be written
out of the budget.
ZBB has begun, expectedly,
in the Office of Business and
Finance, and of special con
cern is its malapplication in the
employment section of the
Personnel Office in "The Col
iseum." Management there
continues to strive for new
depths of unprofessionalism
and is succeeding. The
employment section has been
told that three positions would
be "zeroed," even though vac
ancies exist in that section.
What the Personnel Office
disregarded is that one of the
principal methods of budget
reduction in ZBB is through at
trition — not layoffs. It should
come as no surprise that these
three positions are uupied
by women, and two of the
three are minority, so that
states quite clearly how affir
mative action stacks up against
ZBB.
I think that staff members,
exempt and non-exempt,
throughout the University who
feel safe in their current posi

tions should reconsider their
safety. If this experiment with
ZBB is found to be successful in
the Office of Business and Fi
nance, all offices within the
University will become subject
to its deathly ring. In the in
terim, I would suggest all
employees read How to Win
Friends and Influence People.

It isobvious from many of his
comments concerning the
movie the Deer Hunter (Daily,
March 1) that critic John
Nielsen is still a bit "wet behind
the ears."
To view this film as a war pic
ture is obviously a throwback
to his adolescence. This is not a
story of war but merely shows
how war can affect the lives
and attitudes of people. Any
real-life veteran can attest to
this.
As for the characters, it will
require a few more seasoned
years for Nielsen to realize that
steel worker types do in fact
speak in "common-person
buzz phrases repeated unto
death." They also would ap
propriately raise their voices to

sing "God Bless America"
while silently eulogizing a dead
comrade.
It is the intellectual snob, not
common folk, who might find
patriotism a bit tacky. I for one
agree with Director Michael.
Camino. The Deer Hunter is a
picture of life as it is lived by
everyday people.
Its greatness lies in its ability
to present life so realistically —
confusing at times and possibly
even contradictory. It does so
without preaching, moralizing
or even commenting.

cause them to resign. The most
frequent techniques for elimi
nation recently have been
harassment, arbitrariness and
lying. Management has found
these techniques inefficient
because the victims usually try
to prevent their elimination by
filing a grievance or a suit.
A new technique for elimina
tion is now under experimen
tation. It is called Zero-Base
Budgeting (ZBB). With the risk
of oversimplification, this
budget process requires that
managers justify all of their
budget projections each year,
rather than have assumptions
made about any aspect of
them; 788 obviously provides

Normally, this is a legitimate
budgetary process; however,
some argue Stanford is not
normal in personnel affairs. I
am of the opinion that ZBB is
being (and will probably be)
clandestinely manipulated to
eliminate certain employees —
not because their jobs are

without budgetary justifica
tion, but because the man
agement does not like them.
With adroit utilization of ZBB,
no longer will supervisors have
to fabricate and lie in eliminat
ing unliked employees; the
"unliked" can just be written
out of the budget.
ZBB has begun, expectedly,
in the Office of Business and
Finance, and of special con
cern is its malapplication in the
employment section of the
Personnel Office in "The Col
iseum." Management there
continues to strive for new
depths of unprofessionalism
and is succeeding. The
employment section has been
told that three positions would
be "zeroed," even though vac
ancies exist in that section.
What the Personnel Office
disregarded is that one of the
principal methods of budget
reduction in ZBB is through at
trition — not layoffs. It should
come as no surprise that these
three positions are uupied
by women, and two of the
three are minority, so that
states quite clearly how affir
mative action stacks up against
ZBB.
I think that staff members,
exempt and non-exempt,
throughout the University who
feel safe in their current posi

tions should reconsider their
safety. If this experiment with
ZBB is found to be successful in
the Office of Business and Fi
nance, all offices within the
University will become subject
to its deathly ring. In the in
terim, I would suggest all
employees read How to Win
Friends and Influence People.

Reviewer all wet
It isobvious from many of his
comments concerning the
movie the Deer Hunter (Daily,
March 1) that critic John
Nielsen is still a bit "wet behind
the ears."
To view this film as a war pic
ture is obviously a throwback
to his adolescence. This is not a
story of war but merely shows
how war can affect the lives
and attitudes of people. Any
real-life veteran can attest to
this.
As for the characters, it will
require a few more seasoned
years for Nielsen to realize that
steel worker types do in fact
speak in "common-person
buzz phrases repeated unto
death." They also would ap
propriately raise their voices to

sing "God Bless America"
while silently eulogizing a dead
comrade.
It is the intellectual snob, not
common folk, who might find
patriotism a bit tacky. I for one
agree with Director Michael.
Camino. The Deer Hunter is a
picture of life as it is lived by
everyday people.
Its greatness lies in its ability
to present life so realistically —
confusing at times and possibly
even contradictory. It does so
without preaching, moralizing
or even commenting.
I liked it.
