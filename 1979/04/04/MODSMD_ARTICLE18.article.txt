## 
### 
Sacremento (AP) — Bridge
tolls in California would be
abolished under legislation
proposed Monday By the As
sembly's Republican leader,
who said government fights
giving up existing revenue
sources.
Paul Priolo (R-Menlo Park)
repeated that he planned to
leave the Legislature next year
and said he wanted to achieve
passage of this legislation,
which requires voter approval,
before departing.
"When a person crosses a
bridge, he has already paid for
it" through taxes, Priolo told a
Capitol news conference. He
predicted "the people" would
be for the measures and transit
districts, which get revenue
from the bridges, would fight
them.
Surplus funds
His legislation would use
$209 million in "surplus high
way funds," which he said now
amount to $275 million, to pay
off the existing bonded inde
btedness on the bridges.
Priolo told how 42 years ago
he walked across the Golden
Gate bridge with his father on
the day before the bridge
opened and his father told him

one day the bridge would be
free.
The tolls would be ended on
the Golden Gate Bridge, San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge,
San Mateo Bridge, Dumbarton
Bridge, Carquinez Bridge,
Benecia-Martinez Bridge, An
tioch Bridge, Richmond
Bridge, San Diego-Coronado
and Vincent Thomas Bridge.
The state Department of
Transportation said it would
have no immediate comment
on the bills because its staff
had not studied them yet.
