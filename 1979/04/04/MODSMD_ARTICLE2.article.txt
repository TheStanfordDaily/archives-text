# Media accused of 'sensationalizing' nukes

A "perverse horror story" was how
Edward Teller, prominent nuclear
authority and Hoover Institution
senior research fellow described the
news coverage of the reactor acci
dent at Three Mile Island.
Teller, one of the nation's leading
nuclear physicists during the 19505,
said he thought the media treatment
of the near-catastrophic accident was
"sensationalized."
"Nobody suffered. The nuclear
and energy industry lost $200 million
— according to my estimates — and
the amusement industry gained $200
million. I'm not referring to just The
China Syndrome, but to the news
papers as well.
"What we need is more energy,
and less horror stories," Teller said.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Paul
Kruger said he was "waiting to get
the facts," adding that "it would be
premature to guess" until then.
"One should not expect 100 per
cent safety," Kruger said. "We hope
to learn from mistakes."
Teller compared the accident at
Three Mile Island to the airplane dis
aster at Tenerit'e in 1977, saying that
while coverage of that catastrophe
was "factual," the coverage given to
the nuclear accident was a "circus."
There is a "double standard" when
it comes to reporting nuclear acci
dents, Teller said. "The profit motive
is not absent — even in reporters."
Teller cited the exposure of airline

hostesses to radiation as an example
of this double standard. "All of us are
exposed to about 170 millirems a
year. Airline hostesses get about 700
millirems a year," he said.
Radiation absorbed by humans is
commonly measured in rems, which
is an abbreviation for roentgen equi
valent man. The rem is the dosage of
any ionizing radiation which will
cause the same amount of biological
injury to human tissue as one
roentgen of X-ray dosage.
Airline hostesses, like other
airplane passengers, are exposed to
greater amounts of radiation be
cause the atmospheric protection
against radiation at the altitudes that
commercial airliners fly is substan
tially less than on the ground.
"But you don't hear the media
making a big deal out of airline hos
tesses," he said.
Teller said the amount of radiation
received by people in Harrisburg
outside the plant had been calcu
lated at about .1 rem, or 100 mil
lirems. "The worst-case estimate
projected that one person was ex
posed to 50 millirems. Airline hostes
ses get that in about 50 hours of
flight, which they can probably ac
cumulate in about three weeks," Tel
ler said.
Both Teller and Kruger em
phasized that the nuclear industry is
still in its "infancy."
"The NRC has sent out highly qual
ified personnel to help out at Rancho

Seco (a nuclear plant designed by the
same company that built the reactor
at Three Mile Island). What hap
pened at Three Mile Island will make
other reactors of that kind safer,"
Teller said.
Teller described the Three Mile Is
land accident as "failure on top of
failure — possibly exacerbated by
human error."
"Reactors are designed to survive
failure of instruments, which is why
they have backup systems," Teller
said. "In this case, one human error
which contributed to the problem
was that certain valves were left
closed so that when the pumps were
activated, nothing happened."
Kruger said the present climate
surrounding nuclear energy is one of
fear. "They've (the public) become
scared — but not based on fact," he
said. Still, he said, "we don't have
enough data to decide" what the
risks are exactly.
The risk estimates being used by
the federal government come from a
government study commonly known
as the Rasmussen report. Earlier this
year, the NRC admitted that some of
the accident probabilities arrived at
in the study were unproved.
"All the models in the world can't
prevent accidents, because no
model can take everything into ac
count," Kruger said.
Teller said, "The numbers were
surely open to debate. The basic as

sumptions of the report were in no
way 'repudiated."
In fact, he claimed, the incident in
Pennsylvania supports the Rasmus
sen report calculations. "The Ras
mussen report estimated the proba
bility of a major accident as between
1 in 100 and 1 in 10,000 reactor-years.
It happens that in the known world
— no one is sure how many reactors
are behind the Iron Curtain — reac
tors have been in operation fora total
of J 000 reactor-years, which is right
in the middle of the predicted
range," Teller said.
