# 'Straightforward' Beyers demands open press
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Bob Beyers, director of the
Stanford News Service, has
wide sideburns accenting his
rounded face, and with his
penetrating eyes, he looks like
an owl, always curious to know
"Who?" or '"What?" is going
on around campus.
'Straightforward" and
"businesslike" best describe
Beyers. He comes off as a gruff,
business-only type on first
meeting, but he lives with a
senseof humanity. His big blue
eyes focus total attention on
those he speaks to, and when
he relays a story, his hands tell
half the event, gesturing to
I'emphasize details. Even when
i+ie's on the telephone, his
;.'bands are at work while the
receiver sits propped
his ear and shoulder.
» He often carries on telephone
conversations while typing

news releases.
Beyers runs the news service
under the open press policy,
trying to release all University
news quickly, efficiently and
accurately. This differs from
some university news services
which publicize only positive
university news.
Beyers has been in the re
porting business since his col
lege days in the early 19505,
when he was editor of the Cor
nell Daily Sun. He later worked
as a reporter for the Marshall,
Texas News Messenger and
was editor of the Reporter, a
weekly paper in Saline, Mich.
In 1956 Beyers moved to the
assistant managing editor post
at the University of Michigan
news service. He remained
there until 1961, when he as
sumed the position here.
Beyers described his job as a
"graduate education with pay

and without a degree." He says
he is given "tremendous free
dom" to do what he thinks is a
"legitimate job."
"I think the open press is
one of the best policies Stan
ford maintains," said Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for
public affairs here.
He explained that every time
an unflattering incident is dis
covered by the media rather
than reported by the institu
tion in which it happened, it
invites the suspicion that 10 or
100 similar incidents remain
undiscovered.
"One charge we've never
had to answer is 'Why did you
cover up this story?' "
Rosenzweig said.
Although Beyers said he
dreams of returning to weekly
obituaries and other "scut
work," the "endless stream of
ideas" keeps him here.

He said the greatest chal
lenge he faces here is working
with unconventional ideas
until they at least merit discus
sion. He cited the following
example.
In 1970, just four days before
the Cambodian invasion, a
student came in predicting the
event. Beyers released the
story, but no one used it.
"Given the source, I could
understand that," he said.
Yet four days later when the
invasion took place, the story
received recognition.
According to Beyers, credi
bility is the key. He said that in
times of crisis, candor pays,
and he proved his point when
he had to direct the coverage
of Prof. H. Bruce Franklin's
dismissal.
Franklin had an active role in
antiwar protests here, and was
finally dismissed on the
charges of inciting students to
violence. Although the news
service had to report on the
case for months, Beyers had
been called as a principal wit
ness for the University. To al
leviate the problem of slanted
reporting, Beyers hired a re
tired Associated Press reporter
to cover the case.
Still, he was nicknamed
"Bob Bias" and he received a

number of death threats.
"In some cases you have to
trust your intuition," Beyers
explained.
Beyers' open press concept
stems from his belief that uni
versities which take the initia
tive in reporting unfavorable
news may find it actually helps
protect their good names.
He recalls a time when re
leasing unflattering news
worked to the University's be
nefit. A professor here was
quoted in Time Magazine as
saying that the Stanford library
was the worst he had seen at a
major university. This story at
tracted an outstanding libra
rian to Stanford who then en
listed the professor's help in
forming a better collection.
"Students, faculty, adminis
trators and alumni will rarely
agree on what's good and
what's bad news," the 47-
year-old news director said.
"By the time they did, it would
no longer be news.
"One person's dirty linen is
another person's white ban
ner," he quipped.
According to Beyers' son,
Robby, a junior here, Beyers
brings his work home with
him, even when the family vac
ations in their summer home in
Vermont.

One of his non-writing hob
bies is a daily bout on the ten
nis court. And during Christ
mas vacation this year, Beyers
and his wife went to Nepal,
something he had wanted to
do for a long time, his son said.
Robby Beyers remembers
his father working on the story
about the Stanford research
team kidnapping from Jane
Goodall's reservation in Tan
zania during the summer of
1975. To keep current, Beyers
had to make a lot of phone
calls, but he didn't realize how
many calls he'd made until the
monthly phone bill arrived
with a statement of over $6000.
Fortunately for Beyers, the
University footed the bill.
Although Beyers appears to
have had great success in es
tablishing credibility and hon
est press, some professors are
still reluctant to allow their
work to be published in the
press.
Beyers explains to the pro
fessors that if they don't take
the lead in publicizing their
own work, their reports will be
misconstrued and misun
derstood. And once out, the
reports are very difficult to cor
rect.
Beyers seems to have built a
credible news service here.

Harry Press, who is now editor
of the Stanford Observer, said
that as a newspaperman in San
Francisco, he had been impre
ssed with the exceedingly high
quality of news that came out
of the University long before
he ever met Beyers personally.
"Over time you can build up
a trust with people," Beyers
said. "No administration can
issue an edict to talk to us, but
we can keep working away at
it."
Press said that through
"working away at it," Beyers
has succeeded in fulfilling his
premise "to establish credibil
ity with the media quickly and
efficiently."

ations in their summer home in
Vermont.

One of his non-writing hob
bies is a daily bout on the ten
nis court. And during Christ
mas vacation this year, Beyers
and his wife went to Nepal,
something he had wanted to
do for a long time, his son said.
Robby Beyers remembers
his father working on the story
about the Stanford research
team kidnapping from Jane
Goodall's reservation in Tan
zania during the summer of
1975. To keep current, Beyers
had to make a lot of phone
calls, but he didn't realize how
many calls he'd made until the
monthly phone bill arrived
with a statement of over $6000.
Fortunately for Beyers, the
University footed the bill.
Although Beyers appears to
have had great success in es
tablishing credibility and hon
est press, some professors are
still reluctant to allow their
work to be published in the
press.
Beyers explains to the pro
fessors that if they don't take
the lead in publicizing their
own work, their reports will be
misconstrued and misun
derstood. And once out, the
reports are very difficult to cor
rect.
Beyers seems to have built a
credible news service here.

Harry Press, who is now editor
of the Stanford Observer, said
that as a newspaperman in San
Francisco, he had been impre
ssed with the exceedingly high
quality of news that came out
of the University long before
he ever met Beyers personally.
"Over time you can build up
a trust with people," Beyers
said. "No administration can
issue an edict to talk to us, but
we can keep working away at
it."
Press said that through
"working away at it," Beyers
has succeeded in fulfilling his
premise "to establish credibil
ity with the media quickly and
efficiently."


Bob Beyers
Bob Beyers, director of the
Stanford News Service, has
wide sideburns accenting his
rounded face, and with his
penetrating eyes, he looks like
an owl, always curious to know
"Who?" or '"What?" is going
on around campus.
'Straightforward" and
"businesslike" best describe
Beyers. He comes off as a gruff,
business-only type on first
meeting, but he lives with a
senseof humanity. His big blue
eyes focus total attention on
those he speaks to, and when
he relays a story, his hands tell
half the event, gesturing to
I'emphasize details. Even when
i+ie's on the telephone, his
;.'bands are at work while the
receiver sits propped
his ear and shoulder.
» He often carries on telephone
conversations while typing

news releases.
Beyers runs the news service
under the open press policy,
trying to release all University
news quickly, efficiently and
accurately. This differs from
some university news services
which publicize only positive
university news.
Beyers has been in the re
porting business since his col
lege days in the early 19505,
when he was editor of the Cor
nell Daily Sun. He later worked
as a reporter for the Marshall,
Texas News Messenger and
was editor of the Reporter, a
weekly paper in Saline, Mich.
In 1956 Beyers moved to the
assistant managing editor post
at the University of Michigan
news service. He remained
there until 1961, when he as
sumed the position here.
Beyers described his job as a
"graduate education with pay

and without a degree." He says
he is given "tremendous free
dom" to do what he thinks is a
"legitimate job."
"I think the open press is
one of the best policies Stan
ford maintains," said Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for
public affairs here.
He explained that every time
an unflattering incident is dis
covered by the media rather
than reported by the institu
tion in which it happened, it
invites the suspicion that 10 or
100 similar incidents remain
undiscovered.
"One charge we've never
had to answer is 'Why did you
cover up this story?' "
Rosenzweig said.
Although Beyers said he
dreams of returning to weekly
obituaries and other "scut
work," the "endless stream of
ideas" keeps him here.

He said the greatest chal
lenge he faces here is working
with unconventional ideas
until they at least merit discus
sion. He cited the following
example.
In 1970, just four days before
the Cambodian invasion, a
student came in predicting the
event. Beyers released the
story, but no one used it.
"Given the source, I could
understand that," he said.
Yet four days later when the
invasion took place, the story
received recognition.
According to Beyers, credi
bility is the key. He said that in
times of crisis, candor pays,
and he proved his point when
he had to direct the coverage
of Prof. H. Bruce Franklin's
dismissal.
Franklin had an active role in
antiwar protests here, and was
finally dismissed on the
charges of inciting students to
violence. Although the news
service had to report on the
case for months, Beyers had
been called as a principal wit
ness for the University. To al
leviate the problem of slanted
reporting, Beyers hired a re
tired Associated Press reporter
to cover the case.
Still, he was nicknamed
"Bob Bias" and he received a

number of death threats.
"In some cases you have to
trust your intuition," Beyers
explained.
Beyers' open press concept
stems from his belief that uni
versities which take the initia
tive in reporting unfavorable
news may find it actually helps
protect their good names.
He recalls a time when re
leasing unflattering news
worked to the University's be
nefit. A professor here was
quoted in Time Magazine as
saying that the Stanford library
was the worst he had seen at a
major university. This story at
tracted an outstanding libra
rian to Stanford who then en
listed the professor's help in
forming a better collection.
"Students, faculty, adminis
trators and alumni will rarely
agree on what's good and
what's bad news," the 47-
year-old news director said.
"By the time they did, it would
no longer be news.
"One person's dirty linen is
another person's white ban
ner," he quipped.
According to Beyers' son,
Robby, a junior here, Beyers
brings his work home with
him, even when the family vac
ations in their summer home in
Vermont.
