According to Stanford coach
Dick Gould, this year's Stan
ford tennis team is not making
things happen. After suffering
an embarrassing 7-2 loss to
SMU, the Cardinals were
rocked hard again 8-1 by Trin
ity, a loss that dropped them to
number five in the national
rankings.
The Cards face a talented
California team today at Stan
ford tennis stadium at 2:30
p.m. The Bears are ranked
seventh in the nation so far this
year and feature All-America
Marty Davis, Chris (Slam)
Dunk, and this year's Northern
California Intercollegiate Sing
les champion Larry Stefanki.
Despite poor showing so far
this season Gould is nonethe
less optimistic.
"Right now we don't even
deserve to be ranked in the top
five off our play so far this
year," Gould said. "However,

by the end of the year I feel we
have the talent to win it all
again," he pointed out.
"The key to our season is
how well we can sustain tenac
ity throughout our matches at
every position," Could con
tinued. "Against Trinity we lost
three tiebreakers and I saw a
lot of heads down after losing
the first set in matches and
especially after the singles.
"As the coach I assume some
of the responsibility for this,
but the players must too. It
looked as if we died in some
matches.
"Last year's team was a great
team and we were so much
better than everyone else we
could do that and still win. This
year we're not good enough
that we can get away with that.
"However, despite being
beaten badly I think we can
come back. We're going to
have to be a hungry team and
never quit fighting."
If the Cards are to win their
third straight championship, a
feat accomplished only by two
teams — UCLA and (JSC — the
Cards must start their com
eback against the Bears, who,
Could says, "have the things
we lack."
"On paper our teams are vir
tually even. What it comes

down to is the team that wants
to win the most will come out
on top,'' explained Gould.
"This is a key match for us. Cal
has something to prove, but so
do we. We don't have the ex
perience they have, but I have
confidence we can learn from
our losses."
The match will mark the re
turn to the lineup of co-captain
John Rast. Rast has missed the
first half of the season with a
back injury.
"John's one of my best
players," said Could of the
three-year starter. "He's really
impressed me with his play in
the last week of practice. If he
is physically and mentally
ready, he'll be in the lineup."
The Cards may still be shor
thanded, though, as Scott
Bondurant, one of the most
consistent performers on the
team, is experiencing shoulder
pains and was forced to sit out
a day of practice last week be
cause of it.
So the Cards have their work
cut out for them today and the
rest of the year. However, two
years ago the Cards faced a
similar situation.
After losing three matches
early in the year, the Cards
gained revenge against all the
teams they lost to en route to an

undefeated second half of the
season and a national champ
ionship. Four starters remain
from that team.
"The key is we must be a
tenacious team," emphasized
Could. "The teams this year

are so even any one of the top
10 teams has a realistic shot at
the title. If we can be a more
tenacious team, and play and
sustain that high level of tenac
ity I'm confident we can win it
all once again."

DICK GOULD, Stanford tennis coach, realistically says of his defend
ing NCAA champions, "Right now we don't even deserve to be
ranked in the top five off our play this year." Yet Gould believes that
his Cards will eventually rebound to their former heights.
