# Volleyball team 'flat' in So. Cal.

### John Doane 
The mens' volleyball team
picked up a severe case of
post-finals blahs last weekend
en route to a pair of on-the
road losses in Southern
California. More accustomed
to concentrating on books
than on floating serves and
smoking hits, the Cardinals'
layoff had some obvious ef
fects on Stanford's overall play
in matches with San Diego and
Long Beach States.
"We were just a little flat,"
said Stanford coach Fred Sturm
of his 15-5,15-6,15-5 loss at San
Diego. "We just couldn't es
tablish our own tempo."
But Stanford's lackluster per
formance wasn't the only fac
tor in the match. San Diego's
combination of talent, experi
ence and confidence proved
too much for the second time
this season for Stanford. The
highly touted Aztecs played
like the champions they have
been (NCAA champs in 1973),
and simply wore the Cardinals

out.
Saturday night's clash with
Long Beach proved a little
more encouraging to Sturm
and Co., however. Despite fal
ling 15-1, 15-9, 9-15 and 15-9 to
the 49'ers, Sturm was pleased
with Stanford's ability to come
back from large deficits.
What he didn't like was Stan
ford's habit of falling behind
early and constantly having to
prove the capacity for this ta
lent.
Afterfalling behind 9-0 in the
second game, the feisty Cardi
nals fought back to get evert
with the 49'ers at 9-9. Just when
it seemed that fortune was
smiling on Sturm and his team,
the Long Beach attack sud
denly perked up and rattled off
six consecutive points.
A Stanford win in the third
game came too late and not
convicingly enough, as the
49'ers gathered up enough
momentum to polish off Stan
ford in the fourth game.
Even so, Sturm remained op

timistic.
"It was encouraging that we
remained composed and pa
tient and came back to play
well," said Sturm.
The Cards will definitely
need to play well this weekend
as they take on two of the bet
ter California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association (CIVA)
squads in yet another road trip.
On Friday, Stanford will
journey to San Luis Obispo to
take on the fourth place Mus
tangs. Led by outside hitter
Chuck Hayes, Cal Poly has
been especially stubborn on
their court, according to
Sturm.
Cal Poly emerged from the
first half of league play with a
respectable 6-4 record, good
enough to keep the surprising
Mustangs ahead of such nota
bles as San Diego and Pepper
dine (last year's NCAA champ)
in CIVA standings.
Despite the unexpected
strong play of Cal Poly, the real
surprise has been UC â€” Santa

Barbara, Stanford's Saturday
night foe. Plagued by early in
juries, the Cauchos have
nevertheless hung tough and
are presently in third place
with a 7-3 record.
"They have a good coach
(Ken Preston) and some excel
lent players," said Sturm.
"They're a very steady team."
A few ot those "excellent
players" include setter Tony
Baumgartner and hitters Rich
Ridgeway and Joerg "Yak"
Lorscheider. Lorscheider, a
junior National Team member
this past summer, was not able
to play in the UCSB's defeat of
Stanford here earlier in the
season, and should furtherfuel
the Gaucho attack.
