# Batting lineup changes pay off
## Cardinals beat Spartans, 9-3 
### Cathy Dickerson 
A few minor changes in the
Cardinal batting order made all
the difference yesterday after
noon as the Stanford baseball
team defeated the San )ose
State Spartans 9-3 at home in
Sunken Diamond.
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess began experiment
ing with lineup changes while
the team was in Los Angeles
last week. Finally, the altera
tions paid off.
"There's no real logic to the
changes," explained Mar
quess. "We're just trying
something different."
Marquess hopes that the
changes in the batting order
will help the team's biggest
problem at present: not get
ting hits against league com
petitors.
Second baseman Paul
/uvella found himself batting

in the number four spot against
the Spartans yesterday and
proved himself capable as a
clean-up batter. Zuvella went
three for four at the plate in
cluding a double, and col
lected his 26th RBI of the year.
After having a good series
against UCLA, Zuvella's .410
batting average in league play
leads the Stanford roster.
Also instrumental in yester
day's victory was the batter in
the fifth spot, catcher Bruce
Walters. Walters is now back to
full-time catching duties for
the Cards after suffering a knee
injury (that will require surgery
this summer) two weeks ago.
Walters tallied two RBI yes
terday on a sacrifice fly hit deep
into left field in the sixth inning
and a double to the base of the
fence in straightaway center in
the eighth.

Freshman David Weber,
who worked his way into the
lineup in the series against
UCLA last weekend, contri
buted to the Cardinal cause
against San Jose. Weber batted
twice as the designated hitter
and came up with an RBI single
to his credit.
Even with the successful
lineup changes, San Jose State
proved a tough opponent for
the Cardinals. The Spartans
came up to Stanford with a big
lead in their league's second
half competition after already
having won the first-half com
petition.
San Jose jumped to a 3-0 lead

in the second inning yesterday.
Three solid hits and a well
placed bunt off Stanford start
ing pitcher Larry Kuhn put the
Cards behind early in the con
test.
Kuhn settled down to last six
full innings before Paul Grame
took the mound. Grame
pitched three hitless innings in
relief.
"Our pitching has definitely
improved/' commented Mar
quess. '
