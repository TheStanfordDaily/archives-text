Bhutto hanged yesterday morning
Rawalpindi, Pakistan — Former Prime Minister /ulfikar
Ali Bhutto was hanged before dawn yesterday at Rawal
pindi's central jail, the Pakistani government radio an
nounced.
Bhutto, who ruled Pakistan from 1971 until his ouster
on July 5, 1977, and four of his government's security
officers were convicted March 18, 1978, on charges of
murder and conspiracy. The former prime minister was
convicted of ordering the ambush of a political oppo
nent in which the man's father was killed instead.
The Daily Jang and other papers said President
Mohammed Zia ul-haq, the tour-star general who
ousted Bhutto in a military coup 21 months ago, rejected
all appeals from Pakistani and foreign leaders for cle
mency for Bhutto and co-defendants condemned with
him.
Other unofficial reports said a plane left Rawalpindi
before dawn carrying Bhutto's body to his native Sind
Province. The reports said the government was ex
pected to bury it in a secret, unmarked grave in an
attempt to minimize disturbances by the dead leader's
big following.
Begin and Sadat to meet next month
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin decided yester
day to meet in the Sinai and Israel's Negev Desert next
month, defying an outraged Arab world by openly pur
suing their campaign for peace.
The announcement was made just before Begin flew
back to Israel, capping the first journey by an Israeli
premier to an Arab capital.
The prime minister told reporters he had the feeling
that he and Sadat had become "real friends" and that
during their talks "we solved problems that may have
needed 16 months of negotiations to solve."
Begin did not reveal these agreements, saying he
would report them today to his cabinet and parliament.
When asked after the talks if he was satisfied, Sadat
replied, "I am more than satisfied."
Effects of teamster strike limited
Washington — Labor Secretary Ray Marshall said yes
terday a two-day nationwide shutdown of major truck
ing firms was causing only limited economic disruption,
and the government had no immediate plans to seek a
court-ordered end to the labor dispute with the
Teamsters union.
"We are not contemplating any Taft-Hartley Act action
at this point," the secretary said, referring to a law under
which the government can seek an 80-day court injunc
tion to end labor disputes that threaten the national
welfare.
However, Marshall said he could not rule out the
possibility of severe economic disruptions if the truck
ing industry lockout of striking Teamsters persists.
Doubts cast on hazards of pill
New York — New statistical studies reported yesterday
"cast serious doubt" on the validity of British studies
which said women who have used oral contraceptives
are about tour times more likely to die of cardiovascular
diseases.
One new study also challenged a British study that
applied those findings to 21 other countries, including

the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and
most of Europe.
The authors of the new studies cautioned, however,
that their findings do not mean there is no risk at all
associated with use of oral contraceptives, but that the
risk has been exaggerated and is affected by age, smok
ing and obesity, not "the pill" alone.
Byrne elected mayor of Chicago
Jane Byrne captured the Chicago mayoralty yesterday
and captivated its citizenry in doing so — winning a
record percentage of the vote in being elected the city's
first woman mayor.
"It has been a great night for Chicago," she told more
than 1500 ecstatic supporters in a victory speech less
than three hours after the polls closed. "And I hope that
everybody here will always remember what we started in
the winter of '79. And I hope you'll never let the spirit
stop ever again."
Byrne, 44, won by a landslide, surpassing the mark of
more than 77 percent set in 1975 by her mentor — the
late Richard Daley, who was elected mayor six times.
Royer wins congressional election
Redwood City — Millionaire Republican Bill Royer,
who last year said he was ready to quit politics, soundly
defeated a top aide to slain Rep. Leo Ryan yesterday in a
runoff election to fill Ryan's unfinished term.
Royer, a real estate broker and veteran county super
visor, beat Democrat Joe Holsinger by nearly a 3-2 mar
gin in a heavier-than-expected voter turnout of 43 per
cent.
With 93 percent of the vote counted, Royer had 49,143
to Holsinger's 34,574. Two minor party candidates cap
tured about 1500 votes.
Diablo Canyon license delayed
San Luis Obispo — Licensing of the Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant near here could be delayed for
three to six months due to an accident at a nuclear plant
in Pennsylvania, a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. official said
yesterday.
"We are going to spend months re-evaluating Diablo
Canyon," said Dr. William Brunot, PC&E's supervisor of
nuclear power engineering.
He said the controversial $1.4 billion plant had some
similarities to the stricken Three Mile Island reactor in
Harrisburg, Pa. But he added, "There are some very
important differences."

"cast serious doubt" on the validity of British studies
which said women who have used oral contraceptives
are about tour times more likely to die of cardiovascular
diseases.
One new study also challenged a British study that
applied those findings to 21 other countries, including

the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and
most of Europe.
The authors of the new studies cautioned, however,
that their findings do not mean there is no risk at all
associated with use of oral contraceptives, but that the
risk has been exaggerated and is affected by age, smok
ing and obesity, not "the pill" alone.
Byrne elected mayor of Chicago
Jane Byrne captured the Chicago mayoralty yesterday
and captivated its citizenry in doing so — winning a
record percentage of the vote in being elected the city's
first woman mayor.
"It has been a great night for Chicago," she told more
than 1500 ecstatic supporters in a victory speech less
than three hours after the polls closed. "And I hope that
everybody here will always remember what we started in
the winter of '79. And I hope you'll never let the spirit
stop ever again."
Byrne, 44, won by a landslide, surpassing the mark of
more than 77 percent set in 1975 by her mentor — the
late Richard Daley, who was elected mayor six times.
Royer wins congressional election
Redwood City — Millionaire Republican Bill Royer,
who last year said he was ready to quit politics, soundly
defeated a top aide to slain Rep. Leo Ryan yesterday in a
runoff election to fill Ryan's unfinished term.
Royer, a real estate broker and veteran county super
visor, beat Democrat Joe Holsinger by nearly a 3-2 mar
gin in a heavier-than-expected voter turnout of 43 per
cent.
With 93 percent of the vote counted, Royer had 49,143
to Holsinger's 34,574. Two minor party candidates cap
tured about 1500 votes.
Diablo Canyon license delayed
San Luis Obispo — Licensing of the Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant near here could be delayed for
three to six months due to an accident at a nuclear plant
in Pennsylvania, a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. official said
yesterday.
"We are going to spend months re-evaluating Diablo
Canyon," said Dr. William Brunot, PC&E's supervisor of
nuclear power engineering.
He said the controversial $1.4 billion plant had some
similarities to the stricken Three Mile Island reactor in
Harrisburg, Pa. But he added, "There are some very
important differences."

Bhutto hanged yesterday morning
Rawalpindi, Pakistan — Former Prime Minister /ulfikar
Ali Bhutto was hanged before dawn yesterday at Rawal
pindi's central jail, the Pakistani government radio an
nounced.
Bhutto, who ruled Pakistan from 1971 until his ouster
on July 5, 1977, and four of his government's security
officers were convicted March 18, 1978, on charges of
murder and conspiracy. The former prime minister was
convicted of ordering the ambush of a political oppo
nent in which the man's father was killed instead.
The Daily Jang and other papers said President
Mohammed Zia ul-haq, the tour-star general who
ousted Bhutto in a military coup 21 months ago, rejected
all appeals from Pakistani and foreign leaders for cle
mency for Bhutto and co-defendants condemned with
him.
Other unofficial reports said a plane left Rawalpindi
before dawn carrying Bhutto's body to his native Sind
Province. The reports said the government was ex
pected to bury it in a secret, unmarked grave in an
attempt to minimize disturbances by the dead leader's
big following.
Begin and Sadat to meet next month
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin decided yester
day to meet in the Sinai and Israel's Negev Desert next
month, defying an outraged Arab world by openly pur
suing their campaign for peace.
The announcement was made just before Begin flew
back to Israel, capping the first journey by an Israeli
premier to an Arab capital.
The prime minister told reporters he had the feeling
that he and Sadat had become "real friends" and that
during their talks "we solved problems that may have
needed 16 months of negotiations to solve."
Begin did not reveal these agreements, saying he
would report them today to his cabinet and parliament.
When asked after the talks if he was satisfied, Sadat
replied, "I am more than satisfied."
Effects of teamster strike limited
Washington — Labor Secretary Ray Marshall said yes
terday a two-day nationwide shutdown of major truck
ing firms was causing only limited economic disruption,
and the government had no immediate plans to seek a
court-ordered end to the labor dispute with the
Teamsters union.
"We are not contemplating any Taft-Hartley Act action
at this point," the secretary said, referring to a law under
which the government can seek an 80-day court injunc
tion to end labor disputes that threaten the national
welfare.
However, Marshall said he could not rule out the
possibility of severe economic disruptions if the truck
ing industry lockout of striking Teamsters persists.
