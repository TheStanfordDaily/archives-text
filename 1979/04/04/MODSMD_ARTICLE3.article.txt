# Possibility of explosion diminished; junking of crippled nuke considered
## 
### 
Harrisburg, Pa. (AP) — Federal offi
cials said yesterday that a trouble
some gas bubble no longer poses
any significant danger of explosion at
the Three Mile Island nuclear plant,
advancing efforts to bring the dis
abled reactor to cold shutdown.
Declaring "the bubble has been
eliminated for all practical pur
poses," Harold Denton of the Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission told re
porters, "I think the danger point is
considerably down from where it
was a few days ago.
"I would say there is no more bub
ble at the top of the core. . . . We no
longer consider a hydrogen explo
sion a significant problem," he said.
"The site remains stable . . . the
bubble poses no further significant
safety problem."
Meanwhile, speculation arose that
the crippled reactor might have to be
junked, but one NRC official said he
doubted that.
While Denton, President Jimmy
Carter's special representative at the
scene, held the briefing, tension was
easing in the week-long crisis caused
by the worst nuclear mishap in U.S.
history. Civil defense officials esti

mated that between 80,000 and
250,000 of the region's 950,000
people had temporarily pulled out,
but thousands were returning yes
terday and some schools were
reopened.
Asked when the emergency would
be over at Th ree Mile Island, Denton
said, "We are right now developing
and looking at plans of the most ef
fective way to bring this reactor to
cold shutdown." He declined to
predict exactly when that might be
accomplished.
Asked about concerns that some
safety instruments have failed be
cause of intense radiation in the reac
tor, Denton said some sensors were
lost but most are redundant "and we
have other means of getting the in
formation."
A long time
Whatever success authorities have
in achieving a cold shutdown, De
nton said the plant's crippled No. 2
unitwas not likely to be back in oper
ation for "a considerable period of
time."
Denton said the temperature in
the nuclear core remained stable at
280 degrees Fahrenheit.

Robert Bernero, an NRC decon
tamination expert, arrived from
Washington to assess ways of even
tually cleaning up the radiation in the
facility — a task he said would take
"many, many months, maybe a year
or two."
However, Bernero was skeptical of
suggestions on Capitol Hill that the
reactor was so contaminated by radi
ation that it would have to be aban
doned. "I doubt that it cannot be
used again ... I don't know,"he
said.
Billion dollar mausoleum
He was responding to a comment
by Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), chair
man of the Senate Public Works sub
committee on nuclear regulation,
that the plant might become "a $1
billion mausoleum" — more costly
to repair than it was to build. The
figure, however, applies to the entire
facility which includes a second, un
damaged reactor.
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), the
House energy subcommittee chair
man, called Hart's comment "just
speculation." But Udall said con
tamination in the reactor building
was "so bad it will be months before
any possible cleanup can begin, if
indeed a cleanup is possible."
Despite earlier claims by officials
that the chance of a core melt-down
had never been more than slight,
Udall said after a White House brief
ing: "It was a very close call. We were
very close to a real disaster."
At the plant, technicians working
at control panels sought to maintain
shrinkage of the hydrogen bubble,
which has blocked efforts to rehar
ness the wildcat reactor. With the
bubble gone, they could proceed
with a cold shutdown — bringing the
reactor's temperature down to a
point at which it would no longer be
capable of breaking loose.
Monitors showed the bubble was
still being reduced and emissions of

radiation apparently had eased, NRC
spokesman Jim Hanchett said.
The two-fold process involved
drawing hydrogen from the bubble
and defusing it into Cool water to re
lease carbon dioxide, plus use of a
"hydrogen recombiner" encased in
lead bricks, which blends hydrogen
and oxygen to form water, further
drawing gas from the bubble trapped
atop the reactor.
Evacuation plans were being held
in abeyance over the 1200-square- 1
mile area covering four counties.
"But we're not letting our guard
down," said John Minnich, chairman
of the Dauphin County commission.
Police maintained extra patrols to
prevent looting of property tem
porarily abandoned by owners.
Sheriff William Livingston said he
had received one or two reports of
looting, but they were "nothing spe
cial."
In Middletown, the city closest to
the plant, Mayor Robert Reid said he
had given his police instructions that
"if they see any looters, shoot
them."
No contamination
Gov. Dick Thornburgh said state
and federal analysts had found no
threat of contamination in milk pro
duced in the region around Three
Mile Island.
Tests from 22 dairy farms, he said,
showed levels of radioactive iodine
at 11 to 45 picocuries per liter — far
below the 12,000 picocuries at which
the government recommends pro
tective steps. Based on the figures,
Thornburgh said, "I can say there is
no present danger to consumers
from milk produced in this area." •
While pre-school children and
pregnant women remained at least
five miles from the plant, Catholic
schools reopened yesterday and
public schools beyond the five-mile
circle were to reopen today.
