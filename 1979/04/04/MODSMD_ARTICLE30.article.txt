# Fee assessments slated on ballot
## 
### 
Seventeen different organiza
tions will be placed on the Spring
Quarter ASSU election ballot
seeking fee assessments of the
students next year, ASSU Co-
President Andrew Goldenkranz
announced yesterday.
The organizations will be asking
students to approve a total of $31
in assessments over the four quar
ters of 1979-80. The election will
be held here April 18 and 19.
In addition to the fee assess
ments, students will vote for new
members of the Council of Presi
dents and voice their opinion on a
new mascot. Juniors will also elect
Senior Class Presidents.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Dayna Goldfine said she is going
to experiment with new polling
places and polling times to help
increase voter turnout. Fee as
sessment requests require that 20
percent of registered students
cast votes in order to certify the
election.

Last year, eight of 11 organiza
tions failed to get the 20 percent
vote total, so a special election
had to be held. Last fall a request
for an additional assessment for
KZSU Radio passed the 20 percent
mark by only three votes,
Goldfine said, with only votes
from overseas campuses putting
the referendum over the 20 per
cent figure.
