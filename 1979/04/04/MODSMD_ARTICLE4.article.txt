The ASSLJ Senate elected graduate
senator George Drysdale last night to
replace Peter Stamos as senate
chairperson for the remainder of this
term. Undergraduate senator Ron
Johnson was elected to fill the de
puty chair position, from which
Drysdale had previously resigned.
Drysdale, a second-year JD-MBA
candidate, has been active both in
the senate and on campus for the
past two years. He is the resident ad
visorat Alpha Sigma Phi, was a coach
for the wrestling team and is a
member of the Law Review.
In his statement before the senate,
Drysdale said, "I feel that this is my
obligation to the senate." He admit

ted that he had been amiss in hastily
resigning as deputy chairperson at
the senate's Dead Week meeting.
Drysdale stepped down when in
formed that the constitution re
quired him to replace Stamos as
chairperson. Stamos announced his
resignation to accept an internship in
Washington, D.C. Upon later reflec

mind.
He said he believed that he will
assume a more directive stand as
chairperson and further emphasized
his support for the continuation of
the committee system of the current
senate.
Other candidates for the position
were graduate senators Jim Esserman

and Jay Shacter, undergraduate
senator Erik Thompson and sopho

Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos (CRAP).
Sen. Gary Fremerman expressed
fears that "someone from an organi
zation that made us (the senate) out
as a joke could hurt our legitimacy."
Sen. Brett Kingstone retorted that
"personally, I don't like the senate
right now either."
Speaking on his own behalf,
Trumpbour pointed to his position as
vice chairman of the Publications
