# Drysdale elected Senate head

The ASSLJ Senate elected graduate
senator George Drysdale last night to
replace Peter Stamos as senate
chairperson for the remainder of this
term. Undergraduate senator Ron
Johnson was elected to fill the de
puty chair position, from which
Drysdale had previously resigned.
Drysdale, a second-year JD-MBA
candidate, has been active both in
the senate and on campus for the
past two years. He is the resident ad
visorat Alpha Sigma Phi, was a coach
for the wrestling team and is a
member of the Law Review.
In his statement before the senate,
Drysdale said, "I feel that this is my
obligation to the senate." He admit

ted that he had been amiss in hastily
resigning as deputy chairperson at
the senate's Dead Week meeting.
Drysdale stepped down when in
formed that the constitution re
quired him to replace Stamos as
chairperson. Stamos announced his
resignation to accept an internship in
Washington, D.C. Upon later reflec
tion, Drysdale said, he changed his
mind.
He said he believed that he will
assume a more directive stand as
chairperson and further emphasized
his support for the continuation of
the committee system of the current
senate.
Other candidates for the position
were graduate senators Jim Esserman

and Jay Shacter, undergraduate
senator Erik Thompson and sopho
more jack Trumpbour. Debate
among the senators centered upon
Trumpbour's membership on The
Chaparral and his advocacy of the
Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos (CRAP).
Sen. Gary Fremerman expressed
fears that "someone from an organi
zation that made us (the senate) out
as a joke could hurt our legitimacy."
Sen. Brett Kingstone retorted that
"personally, I don't like the senate
right now either."
Speaking on his own behalf,
Trumpbour pointed to his position as
vice chairman of the Publications
Board and said, "it is not my job to
screw up the ASSU Senate." He
added that he had supported CRAP
because he was not convinced that
the senate could institute the con
stitutional reforms which he be
lieved to be necessary.
Under constitutional regulations,
the senate held a run-off election be
tween Drysdale and Trumpbour,
who were the highest vote recipients
after the first vote, with Drysdale
emerging the eventual victor.
Stamos will meet with Drysdale today
to familiarize him with the intricacies
of the chairperson job.
junior economics major Johnson
won the deputy chair spot over Es

serman and alternate undergraduate
senator Jim Johnson.
In other action, the senate ap
proved the Cardinal Birds, the En
gineers, the Incomparables and the
Griffins as mascot candidates to ap
pear on the spring ballot for student
referendum. These four proposals
were presented to the senate by stu
dent groups with petitions contain
ing at least 100 signatures apiece.
After heated discussion, the
senators voted to add the Trees and
No Mascot to the mascot list for stu
dent approval but rejected the Rob
ber Barons and the Thunderchic
kens.
The senate also voted to give a

maximum $150 from its program fee
discretionary fund to Memorial
Church to sponsor Julian Bond's May
4 speech in commemoration of the
Kent State and Jackson State slayings.
Memorial Church administrators
have endeavored to make the May 4
lecture into an annual event featur
ing nationally recognized speakers.
In the past, the Speakers' Bureau has
co-sponsored the speech, but this
year Memorial Church approached
several organizations when it fell
$800 short of the $1500 honorarium
for Bond.
The senate was to discuss the Rules
Committee's election reform prop
osals in late-night debate.
