# Lyman discusses presidency; changes, problems, future plans

### Mike Charlson 
First of a series
Only hours before the Class of 1974
first set foot on campus and a mere three
weeks following the effective resignation
date of former President Kenneth Pitzer,
the Board of Trustees unanimously ap
proved the appointment of Richard
Lyman as seventh president of the Uni
versity.
The mood here was tense, and morale
was low. It took groups opposed to Ly
man's appointment only 32 hours after
the announcement to stage a protest, re
plete with chants of "Give him the axe!"
Lyman entered a job he called "a pres
sure cooker," taking over for a war-torn
Pitzer who resigned following a 19-month
term that witnessed some of the largest
demonstrations in the University's his
tory, including actions opposing the in
vasion of Cambodia which closed down
the University for two weeks in April
1970.
He entered the job pleading with stu
dents to help "preserve order" sooutside
authorities would not have to impose it.
When he officially began his term on
Sept. 24, 1970, he was short on deans,
confronted with extensive campus
polarization and swamped with bills to
repair damage done by the demonstra
tions.
Now, BVi years later, Lyman is again
short of deans, but beyond that there is
little similarity between the University
today and the one he entered as presi
dent almost a decade ago.
The 55-year-old Lyman no longer
spends the estimated 40 percent of his
time on local public relations that he did
in 1970. The amount of time had to be
reduced "because I'm a lot more in
volved off campus," he said.
Involved indeed. Trustee of the Roc-

kefeller Foundation. Trustee of the Car
negie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching. Chairman of the Commis
sion on the Humanities. Member of the
Board of Directors of IBM. Chairman of
the executive committee of the Associa
tion of American Universities. Just to
name a few of the off-campus positions
he holds.
Many felt the search which resulted in
his appointment was a formality. Stu
dents involved admitted they had to
compare all other candidates to Lyman,
who essentially acted as the standard.
Even the Daily in its editorial published
immediately after his appointment,
which less-than-enthusiastically wel
comed the new president, conceded he
was "unquestionably the best man forthe
job."
And BV2 years later, despite his October
1970 statement to the Faculty Senate say
ing he would stay only 10 years, and de
spite speculation that he was "burned
out" and wants to move on, Lyman says
he has no plans to leave.
"Are you iooking for another job?" he
was asked in a hour-long interview with
the Daily last quarter.
"No," he said without hesitation or
further comment.
"There are not very many jobs that are
challenging, other than the one I've got,
that interest me," Lyman said when asked
why he went through the Ford Founda
tion interviews.
Though he said he never had to actually
decide whether or not to take the Ford
position, he concedes he "probably
would have."
As to whether University morale was
affected by the speculation about his job,
he said, "I just can't believe people's
morale is that hinged on what Dick Lyman
does when he grows up. The institution is

not the length and shadow of one man."
Lyman's personal modesty extends to
other areas as well. Referring to the Uni
versity's emergence from the "very bad
straits" it was in financially, emotionally
and otherwise at the start of the decade,
Lyman said his contribution to the change
could only be determined "by someone
more objective than myself."
"We weren't the only university that
had a lot of trouble (in 1970) and has less
now," he said. "I'm not trying to say I
settled the revolution at Stanford by any
means."
His "welcoming" editorial from the
Daily stated: "Lyman is one of the few
who come to power on the shoulders of
so many beaming, adoring followers. He
should be careful that his halo does not
embarrass him."
Indeed it seems not to have. Among
caveats the Daily cited was Lyman's
method of being "brutally rough in con
versation. His forceful opinions take on
the aspect of aloofness and insensitiv
ity. . .
Some of his statements during the
more troubled times take on just such an
air, sounding much like a slap in the face
to groups under attack.
But Lyman said he feels his straightfor
wardness has been more of an asset than
a liability.
Because you can never please
everyone, especially in a time when opin
ion is polarized, Lyman said, "it left one
free to call the shots . . . the way one saw
them. ... It was my considered judg
ment that I should describe a situation as I
thought it really existed and try to deal
with it as straightforwardly as possible.
"One of the sources of the campus re
volution was certainly a feeling that
straightforwardness and honest state
ments from authorities were not com-

mon. Even if the people listening to you
heard things they didn't want to hear,
they behaved better, reacted better, re
spected you more, if they thought they
were getting what you really believed
than if they thought they were getting
rhetoric and baloney."
Lyman made several nationally con
troversial statements opposing the Viet
nam War. He said many thought he and
other university presidents against the

war were hypocritical because they made
statements against the war but at the
same time took money for war research.
"We don't decide whether to take
money according to who's giving but we
take it according to what it's for," Lyman
said he'd tell protesters. "It was easy to
make that look like blatant hypocrisy," he
said.
The same charge is leveled against
Lyman today on minority issues. Lyman
has publicly supported the Free
Shcharansky Movement, opposed Prop
osition 6 and voiced concern over the
small number of minority and women fa
culty members and graduate students.
Despite these statements, however,
several minority groups on campus, most

prominently blacks, feel the University
has been insensitive to their needs, and is
even trying to consciously purge blacks
from the University.
Lyman called the idea of a purge "fan
tastic paranoia" adding, "It is really very
hard to believe that people could reach
that conclusion."
He said the situation nationwide is
"pretty grim" for minorities, with those
groups taking the brunt of a move to the
right in general.
"They (blacks) have plenty of grounds
for uneasiness and worry. What is
paranoia is to imagine that this university
would want to purge blacks," he said. "I
find it hard to imagine anybody being
president of a university like this into
whose mind such a thought would even
flit for a minute. Why would anybody
want to do it? It's just incredible."
Lyman said the same superficially
hypocritical situation occurs with his
commitment to increasing the number of
women in faculty and administrative posi
tions.
"I think I am as strongly committed and
. . . as knowledgeably committed to
equality between the sexes as anybody as
you're going to find in my position in this
country . . . and yet I don't seem to have
been able to do much in this area.
"Universities move slowly in that re
spect, and you keep trying and you don't
win very many.
"So it's hard for people not to be skep
tical about your rhetoric when the per
formance doesn't seem to match the
rhetoric.
"It's very hard for it simply to respond,
lust because somebody comes in, takes
over as president and thinks there ought
to be many more women doesn't mean
there are going to be many more women
for quite awhile," he said.

the Board of Trustees unanimously ap
proved the appointment of Richard
Lyman as seventh president of the Uni
versity.
The mood here was tense, and morale
was low. It took groups opposed to Ly
man's appointment only 32 hours after
the announcement to stage a protest, re
plete with chants of "Give him the axe!"
Lyman entered a job he called "a pres
sure cooker," taking over for a war-torn
Pitzer who resigned following a 19-month
term that witnessed some of the largest
demonstrations in the University's his
tory, including actions opposing the in
vasion of Cambodia which closed down
the University for two weeks in April
1970.
He entered the job pleading with stu
dents to help "preserve order" sooutside
authorities would not have to impose it.
When he officially began his term on
Sept. 24, 1970, he was short on deans,
confronted with extensive campus
polarization and swamped with bills to
repair damage done by the demonstra
tions.
Now, BVi years later, Lyman is again
short of deans, but beyond that there is
little similarity between the University
today and the one he entered as presi
dent almost a decade ago.
The 55-year-old Lyman no longer
spends the estimated 40 percent of his
time on local public relations that he did
in 1970. The amount of time had to be
reduced "because I'm a lot more in
volved off campus," he said.
Involved indeed. Trustee of the Roc-

kefeller Foundation. Trustee of the Car
negie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching. Chairman of the Commis
sion on the Humanities. Member of the
Board of Directors of IBM. Chairman of
the executive committee of the Associa
tion of American Universities. Just to
name a few of the off-campus positions
he holds.
Many felt the search which resulted in
his appointment was a formality. Stu
dents involved admitted they had to
compare all other candidates to Lyman,
who essentially acted as the standard.
Even the Daily in its editorial published
immediately after his appointment,
which less-than-enthusiastically wel
comed the new president, conceded he
was "unquestionably the best man forthe
job."
And BV2 years later, despite his October
1970 statement to the Faculty Senate say
ing he would stay only 10 years, and de
spite speculation that he was "burned
out" and wants to move on, Lyman says
he has no plans to leave.
"Are you iooking for another job?" he
was asked in a hour-long interview with
the Daily last quarter.
"No," he said without hesitation or
further comment.
"There are not very many jobs that are
challenging, other than the one I've got,
that interest me," Lyman said when asked
why he went through the Ford Founda
tion interviews.
Though he said he never had to actually
decide whether or not to take the Ford
position, he concedes he "probably
would have."
As to whether University morale was
affected by the speculation about his job,
he said, "I just can't believe people's
morale is that hinged on what Dick Lyman
does when he grows up. The institution is

not the length and shadow of one man."
Lyman's personal modesty extends to
other areas as well. Referring to the Uni
versity's emergence from the "very bad
straits" it was in financially, emotionally
and otherwise at the start of the decade,
Lyman said his contribution to the change
could only be determined "by someone
more objective than myself."
"We weren't the only university that
had a lot of trouble (in 1970) and has less
now," he said. "I'm not trying to say I
settled the revolution at Stanford by any
means."
His "welcoming" editorial from the
Daily stated: "Lyman is one of the few
who come to power on the shoulders of
so many beaming, adoring followers. He
should be careful that his halo does not
embarrass him."
Indeed it seems not to have. Among
caveats the Daily cited was Lyman's
method of being "brutally rough in con
versation. His forceful opinions take on
the aspect of aloofness and insensitiv
ity. . .
Some of his statements during the
more troubled times take on just such an
air, sounding much like a slap in the face
to groups under attack.
But Lyman said he feels his straightfor
wardness has been more of an asset than
a liability.
Because you can never please
everyone, especially in a time when opin
ion is polarized, Lyman said, "it left one
free to call the shots . . . the way one saw
them. ... It was my considered judg
ment that I should describe a situation as I
thought it really existed and try to deal
with it as straightforwardly as possible.
"One of the sources of the campus re
volution was certainly a feeling that
straightforwardness and honest state
ments from authorities were not com-

mon. Even if the people listening to you
heard things they didn't want to hear,
they behaved better, reacted better, re
spected you more, if they thought they
were getting what you really believed
than if they thought they were getting
rhetoric and baloney."
Lyman made several nationally con
troversial statements opposing the Viet
nam War. He said many thought he and
other university presidents against the

war were hypocritical because they made
statements against the war but at the
same time took money for war research.
"We don't decide whether to take
money according to who's giving but we
take it according to what it's for," Lyman
said he'd tell protesters. "It was easy to
make that look like blatant hypocrisy," he
said.
The same charge is leveled against
Lyman today on minority issues. Lyman
has publicly supported the Free
Shcharansky Movement, opposed Prop
osition 6 and voiced concern over the
small number of minority and women fa
culty members and graduate students.
Despite these statements, however,
several minority groups on campus, most

prominently blacks, feel the University
has been insensitive to their needs, and is
even trying to consciously purge blacks
from the University.
Lyman called the idea of a purge "fan
tastic paranoia" adding, "It is really very
hard to believe that people could reach
that conclusion."
He said the situation nationwide is
"pretty grim" for minorities, with those
groups taking the brunt of a move to the
right in general.
"They (blacks) have plenty of grounds
for uneasiness and worry. What is
paranoia is to imagine that this university
would want to purge blacks," he said. "I
find it hard to imagine anybody being
president of a university like this into
whose mind such a thought would even
flit for a minute. Why would anybody
want to do it? It's just incredible."
Lyman said the same superficially
hypocritical situation occurs with his
commitment to increasing the number of
women in faculty and administrative posi
tions.
"I think I am as strongly committed and
. . . as knowledgeably committed to
equality between the sexes as anybody as
you're going to find in my position in this
country . . . and yet I don't seem to have
been able to do much in this area.
"Universities move slowly in that re
spect, and you keep trying and you don't
win very many.
"So it's hard for people not to be skep
tical about your rhetoric when the per
formance doesn't seem to match the
rhetoric.
"It's very hard for it simply to respond,
lust because somebody comes in, takes
over as president and thinks there ought
to be many more women doesn't mean
there are going to be many more women
for quite awhile," he said.

man's appointment only 32 hours after
the announcement to stage a protest, re
plete with chants of "Give him the axe!"
Lyman entered a job he called "a pres
sure cooker," taking over for a war-torn
Pitzer who resigned following a 19-month
term that witnessed some of the largest
demonstrations in the University's his
tory, including actions opposing the in
vasion of Cambodia which closed down
the University for two weeks in April
1970.
He entered the job pleading with stu
dents to help "preserve order" sooutside
authorities would not have to impose it.
When he officially began his term on
Sept. 24, 1970, he was short on deans,
confronted with extensive campus
polarization and swamped with bills to
repair damage done by the demonstra
tions.
Now, BVi years later, Lyman is again
short of deans, but beyond that there is
little similarity between the University
today and the one he entered as presi
dent almost a decade ago.
The 55-year-old Lyman no longer
spends the estimated 40 percent of his
time on local public relations that he did
in 1970. The amount of time had to be
reduced "because I'm a lot more in
volved off campus," he said.
Involved indeed. Trustee of the Roc-

kefeller Foundation. Trustee of the Car
negie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching. Chairman of the Commis
sion on the Humanities. Member of the
Board of Directors of IBM. Chairman of
the executive committee of the Associa
tion of American Universities. Just to
name a few of the off-campus positions
he holds.
Many felt the search which resulted in
his appointment was a formality. Stu
dents involved admitted they had to
compare all other candidates to Lyman,
who essentially acted as the standard.
Even the Daily in its editorial published
immediately after his appointment,
which less-than-enthusiastically wel
comed the new president, conceded he
was "unquestionably the best man forthe
job."
And BV2 years later, despite his October
1970 statement to the Faculty Senate say
ing he would stay only 10 years, and de
spite speculation that he was "burned
out" and wants to move on, Lyman says
he has no plans to leave.
"Are you iooking for another job?" he
was asked in a hour-long interview with
the Daily last quarter.
"No," he said without hesitation or
further comment.
"There are not very many jobs that are
challenging, other than the one I've got,
that interest me," Lyman said when asked
why he went through the Ford Founda
tion interviews.
Though he said he never had to actually
decide whether or not to take the Ford
position, he concedes he "probably
would have."
As to whether University morale was
affected by the speculation about his job,
he said, "I just can't believe people's
morale is that hinged on what Dick Lyman
does when he grows up. The institution is

not the length and shadow of one man."
Lyman's personal modesty extends to
other areas as well. Referring to the Uni
versity's emergence from the "very bad
straits" it was in financially, emotionally
and otherwise at the start of the decade,
Lyman said his contribution to the change
could only be determined "by someone
more objective than myself."
"We weren't the only university that
had a lot of trouble (in 1970) and has less
now," he said. "I'm not trying to say I
settled the revolution at Stanford by any
means."
His "welcoming" editorial from the
Daily stated: "Lyman is one of the few
who come to power on the shoulders of
so many beaming, adoring followers. He
should be careful that his halo does not
embarrass him."
Indeed it seems not to have. Among
caveats the Daily cited was Lyman's
method of being "brutally rough in con
versation. His forceful opinions take on
the aspect of aloofness and insensitiv
ity. . .
Some of his statements during the
more troubled times take on just such an
air, sounding much like a slap in the face
to groups under attack.
But Lyman said he feels his straightfor
wardness has been more of an asset than
a liability.
Because you can never please
everyone, especially in a time when opin
ion is polarized, Lyman said, "it left one
free to call the shots . . . the way one saw
them. ... It was my considered judg
ment that I should describe a situation as I
thought it really existed and try to deal
with it as straightforwardly as possible.
"One of the sources of the campus re
volution was certainly a feeling that
straightforwardness and honest state
ments from authorities were not com-

mon. Even if the people listening to you
heard things they didn't want to hear,
they behaved better, reacted better, re
spected you more, if they thought they
were getting what you really believed
than if they thought they were getting
rhetoric and baloney."
Lyman made several nationally con
troversial statements opposing the Viet
nam War. He said many thought he and
other university presidents against the

war were hypocritical because they made
statements against the war but at the
same time took money for war research.
"We don't decide whether to take
money according to who's giving but we
take it according to what it's for," Lyman
said he'd tell protesters. "It was easy to
make that look like blatant hypocrisy," he
said.
The same charge is leveled against
Lyman today on minority issues. Lyman
has publicly supported the Free
Shcharansky Movement, opposed Prop
osition 6 and voiced concern over the
small number of minority and women fa
culty members and graduate students.
Despite these statements, however,
several minority groups on campus, most

prominently blacks, feel the University
has been insensitive to their needs, and is
even trying to consciously purge blacks
from the University.
Lyman called the idea of a purge "fan
tastic paranoia" adding, "It is really very
hard to believe that people could reach
that conclusion."
He said the situation nationwide is
"pretty grim" for minorities, with those
groups taking the brunt of a move to the
right in general.
"They (blacks) have plenty of grounds
for uneasiness and worry. What is
paranoia is to imagine that this university
would want to purge blacks," he said. "I
find it hard to imagine anybody being
president of a university like this into
whose mind such a thought would even
flit for a minute. Why would anybody
want to do it? It's just incredible."
Lyman said the same superficially
hypocritical situation occurs with his
commitment to increasing the number of
women in faculty and administrative posi
tions.
"I think I am as strongly committed and
. . . as knowledgeably committed to
equality between the sexes as anybody as
you're going to find in my position in this
country . . . and yet I don't seem to have
been able to do much in this area.
"Universities move slowly in that re
spect, and you keep trying and you don't
win very many.
"So it's hard for people not to be skep
tical about your rhetoric when the per
formance doesn't seem to match the
rhetoric.
"It's very hard for it simply to respond,
lust because somebody comes in, takes
over as president and thinks there ought
to be many more women doesn't mean
there are going to be many more women
for quite awhile," he said.
