# Modes of faculty evaluation change

What kind of power do we, as students,
have in the evaluation of teaching quality?
How is the faculty's overall teaching effec
tiveness appraised?
The criteria used to evaluate instructors
here are indeed varied and some major
changes in student evaluation of faculty
have taken place during the last decade.
According to Robert Calfee, associate
dean of the School of Education and direc
tor of the Center for Educational Research
at Stanford, the University had "spotty
evaluation of teaching quality" when he
came here in 1965. He said that at that time
there was a "relatively more forceful em
phasis on research, to which teaching was
the second cousin." However since then,
Calfee said, the University has witnessed a
"turn toward accountability in teaching."
The first major effort to standardize
teaching evaluation came in 1973 when the
Resolution on Evaluation of Teaching was
passed. This school legislation attempted
to promote departmental and student
evaluations and to regulate the quality of
teaching assistants.
The Faculty Senate subcommittee on
the Evaluation and Improvement of Teach
ing later experimented with a course
evaluation form and finally implemented it
last fall. This form, used in undergraduate
courses, evaluates the quality of both
teaching and course material. The results
are compiled and returned to the profes
sorand department chairman. The evalua
tions are submitted to the ASSU Course

Guide at the professor's discretion.
According to Calfee, this form was used
last quarter by 70 percent of the University
professors with a 70 percent student re
sponse. Calfee said one of the reasons for
only a 70 percent participation level is the
existence of alternative forms of evalua
tion in the engineering, business and
other graduate schools.
When asked how effective those forms
are as feedback to the professor, Calfee
said, "If the students take this as a serious
task, I'm sure the faculty will also."
The Advisory Board, which reviews all
proposed faculty appointments, uses this
student evaluation, as well as other
criteria, in making its decisions to hire new
personnel, according to J. Dirk Walecka,
chairman of the physics department and a
six-year member of the board. The precise
criteria for these decisions vary depending
on the position for which the faculty
member is being considered.
"The initial appointment to the Stanford
faculty is based primarily on scholarship,"
Walecka said. To determine the applic
ant's academic quality, the Advisory Board
consults experts in the appropriate
academic field who make comparative ap
praisals of the applicant's scholastic excel
lence. Letters of recommendation are also
used.
But the criteria is different for appoint
ments to associate or tenured professor
posts, Walecka explained. Scholarship
must still be high, but the applicant's
teaching quality is also evaluated through

letters and evaluation forms from students
and peers.
"One of the most effective means of
evaluating a professor's teaching is solicit
ing letters from students on a random
basis," he said.
The University uses teaching awards as
an incentive to tenured professors to
maintain a high level of teaching quality.
"Teaching awards are like the carrot, of
fering both recognition and cash rewards
to deserving professors," Walecka said.
For years there has been controversy
surrounding the amount of time profes
sors should devote to research. Publishing
research is important for two reasons,
Walecka contends.
"First, publishing contributes to scho
larship and demonstrates the professor's
quality of mind," he explained.
He also says that publishing helps a pro
fessor's teaching because it keeps the pro
fessor intellectually alert.
Walecka said it is "to an extent true" that
the University wants professors to publish
in order to maintain the University's repu
tation. He said that if the University wants
to attract top students, it must have a fa
culty with a high reputation.
"Overall," he says,"the degree of
sophistication in teaching evaluation at
Stanford has increased greatly in the last
few years."
But he adds that the most informative
form of evaluation is still a good, thought
ful letter from students describing how the
course affected them.
