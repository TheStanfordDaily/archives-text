# Director of reactor regulation
## NRC's Denton believes in neutrality on nuclear issue 
### Associated Press 
About a week ago, Harold and Lucinda
Denton were watching "The China Syn
drom/' a movie about a power plant nuclear
reactor gone haywire. He nudged his wife
and whispered, "That's a faulty reading."
And sure enough, on the screen before
them a moment later, the nuclear technician
portrayed by actor Jack Lemmon discovered
that a meter had been giving faulty readings
4nd that his reactor was in trouble.
"Harold was impressed by the movie's
technical accuracy," Mrs. Denton recalled
Tuesday. "And by Jane Fonda."
Mrs. Denton hasn't seen her husband
since last Friday, except on television, where
his face and calm, assured, Southern-tinged
voice have become familiar to millions.
Denton is director of the Nuclear Regulat

ory Commission's office of nuclear reactor
regulation.
Last week, President Jimmy Carter sent
him as his personal representative to Three
Mile Island when it became clear that a
"China syndrome" situation could occur in
Pennsylvania.
"China Syndrome" is the bussword for
the worst possible accident, a nuclear core
melting through its container and presuma
bly burning through the earth to China.
Denton has been in touch with the presi
dent by telephone several times a day and
has briefed the press corps at the accident
site whenever events warranted.
Denton has demonstrated an aptitude for
explaining what is happening inside a reac
tor calmly and clearly enough to make

people feel that even if they don't under
stand, at least someone of importance does.
Denton, 43, has been interested in nuclear
science since he was in high school in Rocky
Mount, N.C.
Lucinda Oliver, a high school classmate,
became his wife, though they did not start
dating until after both had gone off to col
lege./ .
Denton says he attended North Carolina
State College because it had one of the first
university-operated nuclear reactors. But
Mrs. Denton adds that it was also one of the
few schools he could afford to attend. De
nton's father drove a bread truck.
After graduating in 1958, Denton took a
job in South Carolina with the DuPont Co.,
which was building the Savannah River nuc

lear plant that manufactures nuclear
weapons. In South Carolina, it is known
simply as "the bomb plant."
Five years later, Denton went to work for
the Atomic Energy Commission, forerunner
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
He rose through the ranks.
His job makes frequent use of his talent
for making the complex comprehensible in
appearances before Congress or — when
things go wrong — before reporters.
Denton believes his position as a regulator
of the nuclear industry requires him to main
tain neutrality on the merits and risks of nuc
lear development.
"He does not push nuclear, and he does
not tear it down," his wife says.
Denton does not carry work home with

him, Mrs. Denton says, but he is in the office
early and staysan houranda half after others
have left to keep up with reading he must
absorb. On weekends he usually stops by
the office, too.
To keep in shape, he swims three times a
week and uses the sauna and hot tub of a
public facility near his home.
He dabbles at woodworking, too — he
made a grandfather's clock and, for his
wife's birthday, a music box — and the De
nton family loves the out of doors.
They had planned a camping vacation this
Friday in the Florida Keys, according to Mrs.
Denton, "but needless to say, that's out. He
plans to stay up there until the reactor is
cold."
