IMMEDIATE BESTSELLER!
life faS "Does for Washington, D.C.,
what Heller did for the
military in Catch 22"
Whether as the funniest and most acerbic American
political novel ever written ("An astounding vision
of our leaders in Washington"—N Y Book
Review), or as the ultimate American Jewish novel
("A savage, intemperately funny satire on the
assimilation of the Jewish tradition of liberal
ism into the American main chance"-RZ
Sheppard, Time), Joseph Heller s Good as Gold
(200,000 copies in print) is being hailed as the novel
of the year.
