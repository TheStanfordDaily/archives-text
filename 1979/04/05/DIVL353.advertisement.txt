Ski season
. isn't over,
its just warming up.
Sauaw Valley and Alpine Meadows, with a
little help from Mother Nature, present the
Endless Winter
On most days, the bright High Sierra sun will
warm you as you move effortlessly through the
"corn snow." If you've never skied "corn snow."
you're in for a treat, because the combination of
nighttime cold and warm sun creates a skiing
surface you literally glide over.
Not only is the sun warmer, it stays out longer,
giving you more time on the slopes. You can ski
longer, dress more comfortably; enjoy the
I convenience of shorter lift lines and the freedom
I of uncrowded runs.
Try super spring skiing at Squaw or Alpine.
