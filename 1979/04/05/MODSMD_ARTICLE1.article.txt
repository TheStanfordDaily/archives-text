# Lyman on the future of tuition, undergrad curriculum

Richard Lyman took over the pres
idency here after a career of teaching
and administration which covered 20
years.
Following an undergraduate train
ing in history at Swarthmore, Lyman
secured his master's and doctorate
from Harvard, where he served as a
teaching fellow for two years starting
in 1949. After appointments at Har
vard, Swarthmore and Washington
University in St. Louis, Lyman came
to Stanford with a tenured appoint
ment in the History Dept. in 1958.
He moved to administration in
1964 when he was appointed as
sociate dean of Humanities and Sci
ences. In 1967, he became vice pres
ident and provost, a position he held
until he became president.
Lyman held the two top adminis
trative positions here during some of
the most difficult years of campus
disruptions. Issues like on-campus
ROTC and the invasion of Cambodia
produced demonstrations here
which, while sometimes peaceful,
often were not.
Lyman said the anti-Cambodia

demonstrations in the spring of 1970,
shortly after which former President
Kenneth Pitzer resigned, were the
only time the protesters had "any
thing like a majority" of students
supporting them.
'Sheer numbers'
"When you've got the numbers,
you hope to prevail by sheer num
bers," Lyman said, indicating that the
mass demonstrations were not the
most violent here.
Following his appointment to the
presidency, however, Lyman had to
deal with some "messy" situations
involving violence, including the
Medical Center sit-in of April 1971
and the H. Bruce Franklin affair.
Franklin, formerly a tenured as
sociate professor of English, led a
demonstration against the Computa
tion Center here, and he was dismis
sed following a hearing before the
Advisory Board.
Lyman said the Franklin affair
probably helped "keep things stirred
up" awhile longer than perhaps
without them, but in any case, the
transition to a more peaceful lifestyle
was "quite a gradual thing," Lyman
said.

It was after this and many other
trying times that the University
began to change, gradually, but
surely. Lyman said that he left the
University for three months on a
Danforth Foundation "leave of ab
sence for beleaguered presidents."
"When my wife and I came back in
December, the campus was quite
dramatically different than when we
had left," Lyman said.
It was after the unrest settled down
that the University began to focus on
more financial concerns. The $300
million Campaign for Stanford got
underway and five years later
reached its goal. The Budget Equilib
rium and Budget Adjustment Prog
rams (BEP, BAP) brought the operat
ing budget back into line.
The success of the financial prog
rams here in the long term remains to
be seen, but with the aid of several
key aides, Lyman was able to effect
major budget cuts without serious
disruption of life for most of the Uni
versity.
That financial stability, however,
has involved huge tuition increases.
Tuition has more than doubled since
Lyman took office, and he said stu

dents can assume tuition will con
tinue to rise at a rate slightly above
that of inflation. Tuition can be ex
pected to continue to make up 50
percent of operating budget re
venues.
Private/public gap
Lyman said that as tuition rises, the
gap between private and public uni

versities will continue to grow. The
tuition gap is "a recipe for long-run
strangulation of the independents,"
Lyman said in 1976, and he said his
opinion has "not changed one bit."
He said he believes the strangula
tion will occur in the "very long run,"
but he would not say how long in
years.
Gradually, it seems that there will
come a point where it is "no longer
rational to attend an independent.
"But at the same time," Lyman
said, "we're very reluctant to decide
that the absolute top priority is not to
raise tuition, therefore we will let the
place get more mediocre. That
doesn't seem a promising way to
go"
"In the short run and maybe in the
middle distance, when a given good
becomes very high-priced, then
when people buyit, they wantto buy
the best," Lyman said.
"If people are going to pay the
money to go to an independent in
stitution, they're not going to be con
tent to go to a so-so independent
institution. They want to go to the
best or one of the best that they can.
"I think we will be one of the be

neficiaries of that," he said, "be
cause this place has a very strong
reputation, for all its faults."
Curriculum
For the future, Lyman indicated a
need to take a "hard look" at the
undergraduate curriculum than has
been done in the past.
"While we've done a lot of distin
guished things academically here in
recent years . . . discussion of the
undergraduate curriculum in the
conditions of the late 1970s is not
something that has gone on here."
Lyman said he thought perhaps
with more undergraduates planning
to attend graduate schools (some 95
percent indicate the intention), it
would make a difference in how to
approach undergraduate education.
"I guess I think that there hasn't
been enough thought about whether
we could leave more of the speciali
zation to graduate school, and
thereby require a more coherent ap
proach to liberal arts education for
undergraduates."
He said the diversity within the
University is a virtue, and he would
not like to see a rigid cirriculum, "but
