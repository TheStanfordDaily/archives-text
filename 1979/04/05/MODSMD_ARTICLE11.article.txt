# Brown denies setback
## N.H. visit comes under fire 
### 
Concord, N.H. (AP) — Gov.
Jerry Brown returned to
California yesterday after his
first venture into New Hamp
shire presidential politics — a
shootout that left one state
politician likening Brown to
General Custer — outnum
bered and outgunned.
"Someone asked me who
Brown's advance man was for
this trip," said House Democ
ratic Leader Chris Spirou. "I
told him I thought it was the
guy who did Little Big Horn for
Gen. Custer."
It was Spirou's way of saying
that Brown left the state a bit
bloodied by an unexpected
eruption involving fellow
Democrats who support Presi
dent Jimmy Carter.
Spirou, head of Carter's in
formal re-election effort, was
perhaps the most vocal oppo
nent of Brown's visit, which
had been billed as "non
political." Like most Democ
rats, he saw it as the first over
ture of a presidential campaign
in the state's lead-off primary.
Spirou was further angered
that Brown accepted the invita
tion of a Republican, House
Speaker George Roberts, to
address a legislative committee
considering a constitutional
amendment to balance the
federal budget.
Other Democrats also felt
Brown got roughed up on the

quickie visit. After the
euphoria of a horde of autog
raph seekers, Brown was met
by anti-nuclear pickets at the
Statehouse.
The deterioration continued
when six Democrats who sup
port Carter walked out of the
Constitutional Revision Com
mittee hearing because Gov.
Hugh Gallen, another Carter
backer, was not allowed to
speak before Brown.
Brown then jettisoned his
speech but couldn't avoid a
heated debate with Gallen in
the governor's office, where
they were literally sandwiched
between a crowd of incredul
ous reporters.
Even that was interrupted.
The chorus of anti-nuclear de
monstrators kept shouting
"No Nukes" and "Stop Diablo
Canyon."
But at an airport news con
ference on his return to Sac
ramento, Brown brushed aside

suggestions he suffered any
setback in his first trip to New
Hampshire or got caught in a
local political feud due to bad
advance work.
"Things aren't always what
they appear to be," Brown said
about his abortive plan.
"The reviews were quite
good," he said at an airport
press conference after return
ing to California. "We spent
several hours in very friendly
and cordial dialogue" with
New Hampshire legislators.
Reviewing the visit yester
day, Gallen said he thought
Brown had "badly misjudged
New Hampsire."
"It is obvious the trip was
political. He has plenty to do in
California and he wouldn't
have come a!l the way across
the country if he didn't have
some political motivation."
Deputy Democratic Leader
Mary Chambers called the re
sult "pretty poor."

"His coming here like this re
flected very poor advance
planning and couldn't help his
political future," she said.
"Frankly, he looked like he
bungled the trip."
The Republicans were also
disappointed. Roberts said he
wished Brown hadn't scrapped
his speech.
"I feel he was persuaded not
to speak by Carter Democrats
who were trying to save the
president some embarrass
ment on the balanced budget
issue," Roberts said.
State Rep. Robert Plourde,
one of Brown's major suppor
ters in New Hampshire, said he
was "extremely disap
pointed," that Brown did not
speak. "I really think it hurt
him."
Earlier, Plourde had
heralded Brown's visit, saying
that "as soon as Brown speaks
here he is going to win great
support."
