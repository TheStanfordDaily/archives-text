## Civil rights—Israel's claim to land 
### 
The sole morally valid criter
ion establishing a state's moral
♦claim to a land is that state's
of a free and fruitful
jife for its inhabitants. The
World must assess the de
mands of Palestinians and Is
raelis on this basis.
• Palestinians stridently assert
-that Palestine is theirs, and
'must be returned to them in its
entirety. After all, they lived in
ghaifa and Jerusalem, Nablus
and Nazareth long before the
South African, Argentinian,
Russian and "European" Jews
*vho are now settling in Pales
tine and occupying their home
land. Israelis respond — stri
dently — that these Jews are
returning to Eretz Israel after
(Jjieirforced exile from her2ooo
years ago.
4 A moral claim to a land can
hot be justified by having
squatted there in the past; this
condition is necessary but
hardly suffices. Nor does pre
sent ownership establish a
jnpral claim.
•—The prime and most elegant
JJTtotement of the ideals a state
must live up to is the American
Bill of Rights — an enduring,

workable framework that has
provided our citizens with a re
latively high level of justice and
freedom.
Israel professes and prac
tices the freedoms of religion,
speech, press and assembly as
described in the First Amend
ment. The Waqf, the Moslem
religious and charitable associ
ation, administers the Mos
lems' holy places; Christian
leaders and churches oversee
Christian holy sites; Druse vil
lage elders maintain their re
ligious sites.
Adult Arab female and male
citizens may vote for any one of
Israel's political parties in the
national elections — an en
franchisement and range of
choice that exceeds that of
other countries in the Middle
East. All adult Arabs may votein
municipal elections in Gaza
and the West Bank. In the last
election, most of the mayors
they elected were young sup
porters of the PLO.
Several Arabic-language
newspapers are published in
the West Bank and Gaza. Free
dom of the press in these areas
is broader than in any other

part of the Arabic Middle East.
Most of the other amend
ments in the Bill of Rights focus
on the exercise of due process
of law. Local judges in local
courts decide all litigation ac
cording to Jordanian law in the
West Bank and Egyptian law in
Gaza. Israeli military courts
administer justice in security
offenses according to Israeli
law, which provides for the
right to counsel, the right to
testify, cross-examine, bring
witness, the right to a trial open
to the press and public and the
right to appeal.
Punishment is neither cruel
nor unusual. The death penalty
is outlawed. Judges and their
representatives, representa
tives of the Attorney General,
and defense counsel regularly
inspect prisons. Additionally,
representatives of the Red
Cross regularly visit every pris
oner and file reports on their
visits. Red Cross officials have
never brought charges of tor
ture to world attention.
The standard of living of re
sidents of Gaza and the West
Bank has improved dramati
cally since 1967. There is full

employment in the West Bank,
and nearly full employment in
Gaza.
Israel has codified and en
forced a broad Western system
of individual rights for those
inhabitants who love her and
for those who hate her. Many
forces press her to become ag
gressive, unyielding. She has
maintained this remarkable
degree of freedom despite hav
ing fought four wars in a gen
eration, despite frequent ter
rorist attacks and bombings,
despite being surrounded by
fiery hate and the warm waters
of the Mediterranean. Doesn't
she deserve to rule the Land of
Israel?
