## Reactor flaws covered up 
### 
The recent accident at the
nuclear power plant on Three
Mile Island, Pa., proved again
the vulnerability of this mode
of energy.
Whether nuclear technology
can develop a safe scheme of
producing power is r.ot the is
sue. At the forefront is the at
titude of an industry that
whitewashes, covers up and
just plain lies to the public. At
times the linguistic acrobatics
of public relations men in the
utility companies exceed the
laughable state.
Many problems have not
been resolved. In other indus
tries, debugging has taken a
long time. The trial and error
approach, widely used there,
can be fatal in a nuclear power
plant.
The concealed hazards of
radioactivity are barely coming
to light and many items that
should still be at the experi
mental investigation stage
have been put into service.
This is the result of an overly
bullish industry that in the '50s
and early '60s claimed to be the
panacea to very real energy
shortages.
In the ebullience of the
technological boom of the
post-World War II era, very lit
tle thought was given to ques
tions of the environment and
personnel safety. During the
late '60s, opponents of the nuc
lear industry were considered
starry-eyed, hysterical ig
noramuses.
This notion is changing radi
cally. People who have the
technical expertise and the
chance to look into the nuclear
industry have been dismayed.
Often, engineers have been
overruled by administrators
\Vho think the bottom line in
the money sheets dictates the
final arguments. This should
be expected from an industry
that has learned to opt for the
short-term benefit and ignore
important, long-term, consid
erations.
Three cases that are inti
mately known to us were made
public recently. They are by no
means new and the delay in
exposure is indicative of the
industry's attitude.

— Whenever reactors need
servicing, a convenient pool of
cleaning labor is the local skid
row. A few of society's outcasts
are recruited and placed in the
reactor chamber to perform
the necessary tasks. Few
people know or care to know
what happens to these poor
wretches, especially since long
term effects take time to de
velop.
— During an underground
nuclear detonation in Nevada,
radioactive gases vented to the
atmosphere via ground faults.
All 14 personnel present have
since contracted leukemia.
Most have died.
— Containers with radioac
tive materials have leaked into
the groundwater formations in
two locations in Nevada. Al
though the practices of bury
ing radioactive wastes have

changed, the damage already
done is irreparable.
Industry experts believe
leaks of radioactive water hap
pen almost twice a week. Yet
the public is largely unaware
because the increasingly bel
ligerent and beleaguered nuc
lear industry has been tradi
tionally secretive.
There is an immediate need
for a moratorium on new nuc
lear plants. There is also a pres
sing need to examine the cur
rent state of the industry. In
this vein, all nuclear plants
should be shut down and an
exhaustive research plan
should pinpoint all current pit
falls. Too many things are at
stake and the most overwhelm
ing of all is human life.
