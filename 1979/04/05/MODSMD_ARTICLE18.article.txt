# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Guardo et al. Women athletes slighted 
### 
Much has been written recently about various
issues related to the problems of women in the
Stanford community. As a result, awareness of
the reality of rape, career opportunities, and
some of the legal problems facing women has
increased. We would like to add insights into a
seldom-mentioned dimension affecting some
women here. We are concerned with the prob
lems of the woman athlete at Stanford, and
some of the components of the prevailing at
titude that confronts her.
While few would doubt the intellectual
capabilities of women at Stanford, only recently
have some taken women's athletics seriously.
Much of this support has been reluctantly gen
erated because of Title IX. However, even with
this new-found support, many biases against
women athletes,still exist.
For example, there appears to be a double
standard because some sports are still consi
dered more "acceptable" for women than
others. Those that primarily rely on skill and
strategy are more "acceptable" for women than
those that rely on strength and endurance.
1 hese latter sports require the woman to spend
more time and effort developing her body.
Unfortunately, female athletes soon realize it
is not "acceptable" to participate past a certain
point. They are told they may be physically fit as
long as they do not intentionally develop "bulg
ing muscles."
This is compounded by the "weight room
mentality." No woman ever feels comfortable in
the weight room. As soon as she enters, she is
either gawked at and/or laughed at and she feels
she is entering a place where she does not be
long. There is also an underlying spirit of ten
sion and competition. Intentional or not, it is
always there. For example, if a man follows a
woman at any station he always has to try and
outdo her.
This weight room mentality may stem in part
from the fact that a well-muscled, physically de
veloped woman is not considered attractive.
This belief puts the woman athlete in a double
bind. She wants to excel in her sport, but who
wants to be considered an Amazon?
How is she to feel when she compares herself
to the 'standards" set by a Playboy centerfold?
How often are muscular women used as models
in any of the media? The notion that the muscu
lar woman is unattractive has got to go. Women
athletes must not be ashamed of their bodies.

Many women athletes feel different and set
apart from other women because they often in
timidate men in a way that other women do not.
Men who do not excel in sports frequently
behave as though threatened. Is it because men
subconsciously feel the need to be physically
superior? Is it because it is difficult for these
men to deal with comparisons not only with the
athletic men but also with the athletic women?
We are not sure why but we can only say that we
frequently encounter this.
This is not to say that the male athlete is non
sexist. One would think that he would be able to

in their sports, but who wants

understand the female athlete's plight. How
ever, he is frequently the first to downgrade the
importance of women's athletics by pointing
out how trivial women's accomplishments are in
comparison to his own athletic exploits.
But women's sports are not men's sports and
they must be accepted and respected in their
own right as must all women athletes. Women
athletes should never have to compare their ath
letic achievements with those of men.
This is possible. In tennis, for example, the
women's game differs from the men's, yet is just
as interesting. Both groups have tremendous
support but fans rarely compare the two. Other
sports should follow the example of tennis and
eliminate the underlying competition between
the men's and women's divisions. Endless com
parisons between the two are pointless!

some of the components of the prevailing at
titude that confronts her.
While few would doubt the intellectual
capabilities of women at Stanford, only recently
have some taken women's athletics seriously.
Much of this support has been reluctantly gen
erated because of Title IX. However, even with
this new-found support, many biases against
women athletes,still exist.
For example, there appears to be a double
standard because some sports are still consi
dered more "acceptable" for women than
others. Those that primarily rely on skill and
strategy are more "acceptable" for women than
those that rely on strength and endurance.
1 hese latter sports require the woman to spend
more time and effort developing her body.
Unfortunately, female athletes soon realize it
is not "acceptable" to participate past a certain
point. They are told they may be physically fit as
long as they do not intentionally develop "bulg
ing muscles."
This is compounded by the "weight room
mentality." No woman ever feels comfortable in
the weight room. As soon as she enters, she is
either gawked at and/or laughed at and she feels
she is entering a place where she does not be
long. There is also an underlying spirit of ten
sion and competition. Intentional or not, it is
always there. For example, if a man follows a
woman at any station he always has to try and
outdo her.
This weight room mentality may stem in part
from the fact that a well-muscled, physically de
veloped woman is not considered attractive.
This belief puts the woman athlete in a double
bind. She wants to excel in her sport, but who
wants to be considered an Amazon?
How is she to feel when she compares herself
to the 'standards" set by a Playboy centerfold?
How often are muscular women used as models
in any of the media? The notion that the muscu
lar woman is unattractive has got to go. Women
athletes must not be ashamed of their bodies.

Many women athletes feel different and set
apart from other women because they often in
timidate men in a way that other women do not.
Men who do not excel in sports frequently
behave as though threatened. Is it because men
subconsciously feel the need to be physically
superior? Is it because it is difficult for these
men to deal with comparisons not only with the
athletic men but also with the athletic women?
We are not sure why but we can only say that we
frequently encounter this.
This is not to say that the male athlete is non
sexist. One would think that he would be able to

understand the female athlete's plight. How
ever, he is frequently the first to downgrade the
importance of women's athletics by pointing
out how trivial women's accomplishments are in
comparison to his own athletic exploits.
But women's sports are not men's sports and
they must be accepted and respected in their
own right as must all women athletes. Women
athletes should never have to compare their ath
letic achievements with those of men.
This is possible. In tennis, for example, the
women's game differs from the men's, yet is just
as interesting. Both groups have tremendous
support but fans rarely compare the two. Other
sports should follow the example of tennis and
eliminate the underlying competition between
the men's and women's divisions. Endless com
parisons between the two are pointless!
