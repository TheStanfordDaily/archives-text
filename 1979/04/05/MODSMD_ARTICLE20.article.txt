Draft to fail its aim
In his defense of the draft
{Daily, April 2), )on Gundersen
argues that his generation is
selfish, that "restraint and dis
cipline . . . must be imposed if
a stable society is to be main
tained," and that "we sadly
need social services, but we
cannot afford them at prevail
ing costs of labor."
But why should young
people be singled out to sac
rifice their freedom? Gunder
sen's generation is certainly no
more self-seeking than the rest
of the population today. It isn't
18-year-olds who are jacking
up the price of gasoline, pad
ding expense accounts,
scrambling for profits, or run
ning the Teamsters Union.
It we must impose "restraint
and discipline," why didn't
Gundersen suggest controlling
profits and exorbitant wage
demands, or simply taxing the
money needed to provide so
cial services and an adequate
army from the rich? Obviously,
this would be politically un
thinkable — it is much more
acceptable to draft young
people than money.
Let's not fool ourselves,
though, by saying that such a
decision will provide a moral
uplift for the draftees. Con
scripting young people for
forced labor while the rest of
us conduct business as usual
will hardly promote a spirit of
self-sacrifice. Forcing 18-year

olds into the army and perhaps
into dubious military interven
tions is not the best way to de
velop a "concerned and in
volved youth."
In the early 1960s young
people flocked to sign up for
the Peace Corps because they
thought it had a constructive
purpose. While the idea be
hind the Peace Corps was
naive, a useful and well
designed program of voluntary
service would undoubtedly be
appealing today. But providing
an opportunity for service is a
far cry from compulsion, as we
have seen again and again. In
the absence of a national
emergency, the draft would
only encourage rebellion by
some, spirit-sapping alienation
in others and sullen acquies
cence by most. Above all, a
forced draft would be a major
step backward in our pursuit of
human freedom, and therefore
a loss to us all.

Serra unsafe
Any bicyclist who has tried to
travel the pocked and corru
gated expanse of Serra Street
between the Quad and the
Oval among potholes (some
four feet across and six inches
deep), bumps, mounds, dips
and ridges knows that the
street is treacherous by day
and possibly life-threatening
by night.

On March 2 I wrote to John
Lerry, Manager for Construc
tion and Engineering, Bob
Beth, Director of Risk Man
agement, and Bruce Wiggins,
Manager of Buildings and
Grounds Maintenance, exp
laining these hazards in detail,
and suggesting that maintain
ing a street in such a dangerous
and defective condition could
subject the University to legal
liability in the event of an acci
dent.
Since that time I have re
ceived no replies to my letters,
and no repairs have been made
to the street. I conclude that
the University will not repair
Serra Street to a safe standard,
but that it does not dispute its
responsibility for the consequ
ences.
Therefore I recommend that
any cyclist who suffers injury or
property damage from hitting
or avoiding surface hazards on
Serra Street, or because
another cyclist or a motorist
has hit or avoided these
hazards, investigate filing suit
against the University for neg
ligence.

Return my bike
This is nothing short of a plea
to the person who stole my
bicycle Tuesday when it was
parked outside the political
science' building. Once this

person realizes how important
this bicycle is to me perhaps he
will return it.
The bicycle in question is a
black 1978 Motobecane Super
Mirage with molded hand
lebars, new tires, toe clips and
a great deal of mileage. I live 15
miles from here and rely solely
on my bicycle for transporta
tion to and from campus. I am
of very modest means, have no
reliable source of income and
no car.
I therefore appeal to your
conscience, hoping you will
make every effort possible to
return to me what is rightfully
mine — no questions asked. I
would also urge anyone read
ing this who sees a bicycle fit
ting the above description to
contact me at once. The bike
has been marked for identifica
tion discernable only to me.
I have always thought my
bicycle was safer on this ivory
tower campus than in the city,
and I hope the thief will prove
me right.

service would undoubtedly be
appealing today. But providing
an opportunity for service is a
far cry from compulsion, as we
have seen again and again. In
the absence of a national
emergency, the draft would
only encourage rebellion by
some, spirit-sapping alienation
in others and sullen acquies
cence by most. Above all, a
forced draft would be a major
step backward in our pursuit of
human freedom, and therefore
a loss to us all.

Serra unsafe
Any bicyclist who has tried to
travel the pocked and corru
gated expanse of Serra Street
between the Quad and the
Oval among potholes (some
four feet across and six inches
deep), bumps, mounds, dips
and ridges knows that the
street is treacherous by day
and possibly life-threatening
by night.

On March 2 I wrote to John
Lerry, Manager for Construc
tion and Engineering, Bob
Beth, Director of Risk Man
agement, and Bruce Wiggins,
Manager of Buildings and
Grounds Maintenance, exp
laining these hazards in detail,
and suggesting that maintain
ing a street in such a dangerous
and defective condition could
subject the University to legal
liability in the event of an acci
dent.
Since that time I have re
ceived no replies to my letters,
and no repairs have been made
to the street. I conclude that
the University will not repair
Serra Street to a safe standard,
but that it does not dispute its
responsibility for the consequ
ences.
Therefore I recommend that
any cyclist who suffers injury or
property damage from hitting
or avoiding surface hazards on
Serra Street, or because
another cyclist or a motorist
has hit or avoided these
hazards, investigate filing suit
against the University for neg
ligence.

Return my bike
This is nothing short of a plea
to the person who stole my
bicycle Tuesday when it was
parked outside the political
science' building. Once this

person realizes how important
this bicycle is to me perhaps he
will return it.
The bicycle in question is a
black 1978 Motobecane Super
Mirage with molded hand
lebars, new tires, toe clips and
a great deal of mileage. I live 15
miles from here and rely solely
on my bicycle for transporta
tion to and from campus. I am
of very modest means, have no
reliable source of income and
no car.
I therefore appeal to your
conscience, hoping you will
make every effort possible to
return to me what is rightfully
mine — no questions asked. I
would also urge anyone read
ing this who sees a bicycle fit
ting the above description to
contact me at once. The bike
has been marked for identifica
tion discernable only to me.
I have always thought my
bicycle was safer on this ivory
tower campus than in the city,
and I hope the thief will prove
me right.

Draft to fail its aim
In his defense of the draft
{Daily, April 2), )on Gundersen
argues that his generation is
selfish, that "restraint and dis
cipline . . . must be imposed if
a stable society is to be main
tained," and that "we sadly
need social services, but we
cannot afford them at prevail
ing costs of labor."
But why should young
people be singled out to sac
rifice their freedom? Gunder
sen's generation is certainly no
more self-seeking than the rest
of the population today. It isn't
18-year-olds who are jacking
up the price of gasoline, pad
ding expense accounts,
scrambling for profits, or run
ning the Teamsters Union.
It we must impose "restraint
and discipline," why didn't
Gundersen suggest controlling
profits and exorbitant wage
demands, or simply taxing the
money needed to provide so
cial services and an adequate
army from the rich? Obviously,
this would be politically un
thinkable — it is much more
acceptable to draft young
people than money.
Let's not fool ourselves,
though, by saying that such a
decision will provide a moral
uplift for the draftees. Con
scripting young people for
forced labor while the rest of
us conduct business as usual
will hardly promote a spirit of
self-sacrifice. Forcing 18-year

olds into the army and perhaps
into dubious military interven
tions is not the best way to de
velop a "concerned and in
volved youth."
In the early 1960s young
people flocked to sign up for
the Peace Corps because they
thought it had a constructive
purpose. While the idea be
hind the Peace Corps was
naive, a useful and well
designed program of voluntary
service would undoubtedly be
appealing today. But providing
an opportunity for service is a
far cry from compulsion, as we
have seen again and again. In
the absence of a national
emergency, the draft would
only encourage rebellion by
some, spirit-sapping alienation

cence by most. Above all, a
