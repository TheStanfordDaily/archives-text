# Students spend $100 million yearly
## 
### Chris Mills 
Students here spent more
than $45,000 on hamburgers,
pizzas and drinks at one re
staurant on California Avenue
last year. They also bought
about $126,000 worth of jeanS
from a shop on El Camino Real.
In the pursuit of cleanliness,
they dropped $144,000 into
coin-operated laundry
machines on campus.
No one knows how much
students collectively spend
yearly, but guesses are that this
year they will shell out more
than $100 million to eager
hands on campus and in sur
rounding communities.
University administrators,
student researchers and Palo
Alto business managers have
tried to figure out exactly what
students spend where, but
none have come up with an ac
curate count.
"It's nigh impossible to
make an evaluation. We've
never come up with a for
mula," said Janette Biggerstaff,
manager of the Stanford Shop
ping Center, describing efforts
to pin down student spending
there. A 1977 study of bank
checks received by BASS Ticket
Service proved inconclusive,
she said.
"I really have no idea," Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce
president Richard Kluzek said,
when asked what impact stu
dents have on city businesses.
Students patronize stores at
the shopping center and on
University Avenue, he said,
"but if they live in Menlo Park
or Mountain View, that's

where they spend."
Dan Carton, a student intern
in the Academic Planning Of
fice, recently interviewed 16
students on financial aid to find
out how much they spend on
things other than tuition, room
and board and transportation
home. Carton found great dif
ferences in spending patterns.
His subjects spent from $780 to
$2550 per year.
Each spent more than the
$700 allowed by the Financial
Aids Office's "typical student
budget" for books and per
sonal expenses. The budget is
used only for planning pur
poses, however. It does not tell
how much students actually
spend.
Although prices for tqition
and room and board on cam
pus are fixed by the Board of
Trustees, student dollars spent
elsewhere on campus are not
tallied. But some estimates
have been made.
"At least $2.6 million could
be attributed to students with
out any trouble. But I'm not
saying they don't participate
mightily in the rest," Stanford
Bookstore manager Eldon
Speed said, referring to last
year's $6 million volume.
Tresidder Union's two re
staurants, recreation center,
ticket office and convenience
store took about $1.4 million
from students last year, accord
ing to estimates provided by
their managers.
Students also paid over
$500,000 last year for ASSU
special services. ASSU Finan
cial Manager Bill Lape pointed

to the travel service, special
events, Sunday flicks, lecture
notes and the linen service as
the main attractions.
Nearly $200,000 also goes
from student pockets into food
and drink vending machines
around campus, according to
an estimate by Flousing Man
agement Director Ed Scoles.
Pacific Telephone took 2642
student telephone orders in
its trailer offices, last fall. The
average monthly bill is $45, ac
cording to Palo Alto branch
manager Barbara Ogden.
That adds up to almost $1.1
million in phone calls this year.
Student expenditures off
campus are most difficult to es
timate. Many company owners
near the University appreciate
student business, but few can
tell how much of their money
comes directly from students.
"That's information I
couldn't even give to the IRS,"
quipped a sporting goods store
owner.
"A customer will come in
several nights before we find
out he's a student," a restaur
ant owner said, describing the
problem of identifying stu
dents.
"I think more students work
here than are customers," a

clothing store manager conjec
tured.
Not all merchants were so
vague. The manager of a pizza
delivery service said 85 percent
of his orders come from Uni
versity dorms, "mostly from
freshmen and sophomores,
who don't get out a lot."
Stanford Money Book man
ager )im Baer guessed that
University students spend
about the same as other people
in their age group. The market
may be indicated by the kinds
of businesses most eager to get
into his coupon book: fast
food restaurants, spo.ting
goods stores, record and
stereo shops, casual clothing
stores, house plant sellers and
book stores.
In a telephone survey, 30
Palo Alto business managers
were asked to estimate how
much they receive yearly from
students. Their "best guesses"
ranged from almost nothing to
more than $175,000.
The owner of a copy shop on
University Avenue said stu
dents are especially valuable to
him. When students go on vac
ation, his daily sales drop by
one-half.
"I can't wait for them to re
turn," he said.

At least $2.6 million of the Stanford Bookstore's annual $6 million volume can be attributed to University
students, according to Bookstore manager Eldon Speed. Tresidder Union gained $1.4 million from
students last year.


Students pour a large amount of their "spending money" into shops
in the Stanford Shopping Center. However, exactly how much money
this involves is difficult to measure.
