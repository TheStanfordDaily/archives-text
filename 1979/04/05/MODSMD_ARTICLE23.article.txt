# Four brothers attend Stanford; hold record
## 
### Greg Pierson 
It was once said that the sun never
sets on the British Empire. But those
days are gone. Perhaps a new empire
has emerged once again, with part of it
here — the Cannon Family Empire.
The Cannon family, from Pasadena,
boasts seven children, four of whom
are now attending the University. In
addition, the father, Prof. Robert Can
non, previously head of the division of
engineering and applied sciences at Cal
Tech, was recently named chairman of
the aeronautics and astronautics de
partment here. Fred, Dave, |im and Joe
Cannon, all engineering majors, hold
the record for the most members of a
family attending Stanford at one time.
Yet for the four Cannons, a record
like this is nothing new; in fact, they
have credited many other records to
the Cannon name in the past.
For example, when the four were
growing up in Washington, D.C., they
and their two older brothers became
the first family in the nation to claim six
Eagle scouts. "Our mom found out
from the national scout office that we
held the record Eagle scouts in one fam
ily," said Dave Cannon, a co-terminal
student in mechanical engineering.
"We were pretty surprised to find that
out."
After moving to Southern California,
the Cannon family branched out, send

ing Fred, Dave, Jim and Joe here, and
the rest of the children to other parts of
the world. "We're pretty spread out
right now," explained Fred, a second
year graduate student in environmental
engineering. "Our oldest brother, Phil,
is finishing his Ph.D. work at North
Carolina State in forest pathology.
Doug, the second oldest, is doing mis
sionary work in Taiwan, while Beverly,
our only sister, is a teacher for college
students with hearing disabilities in
Fremont."
Independent
But being far apart from each other
isn't anything new for the Cannons; in
fact, they've been following their own
paths for many years. "We're all fairly
independent," Dave said. "From the
time we were in high school, we have
spent most or all of our summers away
from home at jobs." Fred, the oldest of
the Cannons at the University, has
worked everywhere from Alaska, as a
commercial fisherman, to Colorado
where he collected data on the salt con
tent of the Colorado River.
"I'm an inventor at heart," claimed
Dave, who will be graduating this year.
"I enjoy working on new and compli
cated things." Dave has worked as a
professional scuba diver for Cal Tech
and has also experimented with a wave
pump used for offshore research to
bring up nutrient-rich water to help

grow kelp beds. "I also helped design a
'brunch rnuncher' for handicapped
people to feed themselves," he says.
"It's an aid for those who don't have full
control of their arms."
Jim and |oe are twins, barely distin
guishable at close range. "Whenever I
go somewhere I have to be careful to
see if a person actually recognizes me,
or is really saying hello to my brother,"
said joe, a junior in mechanical en
gineering.
Jim, double majoring in music and
mechanical engineering, feels the same
way. "In fact, we look so much alike, I
have no trouble passing Joe off as me.
Our freshman year I was in a musical,
and I broke my leg a week before the
opening night. I couldn't dance, so I
taught Joe the lines and the steps, and
he did the musical in my place.
Everyone thought it was me."
The money
When a person hears about the Can
non family here, the first thing that
comes to mind is how they can afford to
come here. "We figured it would cost
over $144,000 to get us through Stan
ford," Fred said. "We work all summer
long and whatever we can't pay, our
father picks up. At the end of the year,
there's nothing left of our savings."
Yet for the Cannons, life here
couldn't be better. When asked if hav
ing so many brothers here bothered

any of them, Joe explained, "We're all
best friends. Besides, the campus is big
enough to do your own thing, yet small
enough that we see each other around
fairly often."
Although the four Cannons "do their
own thing" when it comes to school
work, activities form an important part
of their lives. "We spend a fair amount
of time together," Jim said. "We're all
very active in our church and have also
formed an IM soccer team with a few
other guys."
For most of the Cannons here, the
future remains vague. Fred hopes toget
a steady job in some form of environ
mental engineering, while Jim and Joe
are looking toward a possible graduate
program in their respective fields. For
Dave, the future is a little more clear —
he will be getting married in July. "Our
brother Doug will come back from
Taiwan to marry us," explains Dave.
"After we get settled, I'd like to go back
to school to get a Ph.D. Lynn and I also
hope to find the time to go to South
America to do some missionary work
for awhile."
Whatever they end up doing in the
future, the Cannons want to be helping
people. "That's our main goal in life,"
Fred said. "We're people-oriented
rather than status-oriented." And with
examples like Doug and Beverly, the
two oldest, one would have to agree.
