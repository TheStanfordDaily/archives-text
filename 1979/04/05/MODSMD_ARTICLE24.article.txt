# Legalization of marijuana to be discussed in Japan
## 
### 
Tokyo (AP) — An organiza
tion called the Clear Light Soc
iety — in what is believed to be
the first move of this kind in
Asia — is planning a sym
posium to urge the legalization
of marijuana in Japan.
The society, with about 300
members, has scheduled the
symposium for June 5 to point
out what it complains are harsh
laws against marijuana use
here and in other parts of Asia.
The laws provide a maximum
death penalty in Malaysia,
South Korea and the
Philippines; maximum life im
prisonment in Hong Kong; 30
years and 15 strokes of the cane
in Singapore; seven years im
prisonment in Japan,and three
years imprisonment in India.
Koh Akutagawa, 45, who
heads the Clear Light Society,
said, "The law, we believe, vio
lates civil liberties and is as un
constitutional as the ban on al

cohol in some places in the old
days."
Akutagawa is a prominent
Oriental-style painter and a de
fendant in a marijuana case. He
said in an interview that many
doctors and research groups,
including the U.S. National In
stitute on Drug Abuse, have
held that marijuana is not an
addictive drug.
Not harmless
One recent NIDA report was
reported to have said, how
ever, it did not regard
marijuana as harmless.
Many western countries, he
said, today pursue,a policy that
possession and use of
marijuana should no longer be
against the law.
"Our movement isn't in
tended to encourage people to
smoke hemp because we like
it," Akutagawa said. "We just
want to see the law revised so
that citizens can decide
whether to use it as in the case
of alcohol."
Free to meet
A metropolitan police offi
cial said the Clear Light mem
bers "are free to meet and
speak." Japanese judicial offi
cials declined comment on the
constitutionality of Japan's 31-
year-old marijuana law estab
lished at the request of the
then-U.S. occupation force.
In the symposium, the two

year-old society will bring
gether a dozen or so lawyeij, J
doctors, medical researched,
writers and others, Akutagawp \
said. v> '

Akutagawa's indictment id
1977 for smoking hemp which ■
he grew in his yard led to the »
organization of the Clear Light J
Society in Kyoto. He remains J
free pending a final ruling by i
the Kyoto District Court ex- J
pected late this year.
Laws copied
Koichi Tamura, one of the :
defense attorneys f(Tf *
Akutagawa and legal adviser to }
Clear Light, said Asian natioris, ;
except perhaps India whetfi
cannabis was banned under !
British rule, all "copied"" 1
marijuana laws of wester.ii •
countries after World War 11.
"Until then, many Asian ;
peoples had long been free iYi t
growing, and some of thefn !
smoking, hemp which
and still is, a material for
rope and fabric fiber industry
for many centuries."
In Japan, fewer than 40d()'i
persons have been caught'"
growing, smoking or traffick-'
ing in marijuana in the past six
years. Police said they didn't
have exact figures but that !
many of the defendants wets
released after being "ad
monished" or given sif#'
pended sentences.
