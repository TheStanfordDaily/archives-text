## Movies/ron lillejord A 						wild-eyed musical vision of America 
### 
Well, we've finally got a great
movie musical again.
I wonder if anyone will see it.
Milos Forman's film version
of Hair is a brilliantly realized
feat of big-time, on-the-edge
moviemaking, a full-blast fan
tasy that's reckless in a giddy,
uplifting way; it's visual dyna
mite with explosions that just
keep getting bigger and big
ger.
No nostalgia
The movie is set in 1968, but
Forman never tries to evoke a
sense of nostalgia. What he's
after — and what he succeeds
in creating — is a crystallization
of the spirit of that time. For
man brings the anger, the bit
terness, and overwhelmingly,
the joy of the '60s kids back to
sweet life again. What Hair cap
tures is a rock 'n' roll, rebelli
ous force that can't die; it may
seem to be "out of place" now,
but it's there to be tapped by
anyone who still gives a damn,
as Forman obviously does.
Forman communicates the
'60s spirit simply by making his
movie with the same sort of

fearless daring. The movie re
volves around Claude (John
Savage), a kid from Oklahoma
who's about to go into the
army, and his experiences with
a group of "hippies" (for lack
of a better word). It's a basic
premise, full of potential "les
sons," but for Forman it's just a
starting point. He kicks the
movie into high gear im
mediately with a fabulous "Age
of Aquarius" sequence. The
dancing here looks like Gene
Kelly filtered through a rock
sensibility, and the sheer visual
excitement is overwhelming;
Central Park never looked any
better than when these "hip
pies" were dancing in it.
Visuals
Forman exploits the fantasy
framework for purely visual ef
fects: for example, horses join
in the opening dance sequ
ence, and a jailhouse is used
for the title number. And the
visual highpoint comes when
Claude has his first LSD trip.
Forman doesn't go for Roger
Corman's multi-colored, swirl
ing abstractions; he flies

people through the air and
lights fires in churches.
Claude's on an LSD trip and
Milos Forman is on a kicky vis
ual trip.
The scenes are often huge,
but the movie never has the
problems The Wiz had because
Forman lets the music breathe
and intercuts masterfully in
order to bring all his dancers to
life. Treat Williams, as the hip
pie who, by a simple twist of
fate, takes Claude's place and
dies in Vietnam, is especially
memorable.
Exhilarating
In the end, you realize that
Forman has just blown right
past the problem everyone
said this movie would have:
that is, how do you make this
" '60s musical" relevant in
1979? Through the timeless
ness of its spirit and the wild
ness of the chances it takes,
Hair provides an exhilarating
fantasy vision of America as
seen through the wild eyes of
the '60s generation. And in
those terms, Hair just might be
the truest picture of that spe

cial time ever made.
The only disheartening thing
about Hair is its reception from
the public — and especially
from today's 18 to 25 year-olds.
When I saw the movie, there
were 15 people in the audi
ence, and five of them had
stayed over from the preceding
show.
Chi Omegas
For us, those 18 to 25 year
olds, it sometimes seems that
we live in a "Chi Omega gener
ation," a real-life Invasion of
the Body Snatchers where we
all celebrate having fun with
apathy. Parents, of course,
love this kind of attitude; it's
less than threatening — kind of
like having Eisenhower back
again. I may be just a stupid
(and worse yet, pretentious)
fool about this, but I think we
owe ourselves, at least once,
another kind of celebration —
one where we let our emotions
burst out, one where we're
never quite satisfied, but yet
never afraid to keep dancing.
Hair is that kind of celebra
tion.
