# Deathly dull pulp art on the boulevard
## 
### 
If Boulevard Nights had even
a few more pretensions about
itself , it would be a disaster of a
movie. As it is, however, it slips
by with just being a minor
mess. The film mixes gang war
fare with a silly "socially re
deeming" love story. The
end-product looks as if West
Side Story was re-edited with a
blender.
If a movie sets out to be bad,
it might at least have the de
cency to move quickly enough
to stay interesting. No matter
how bad this season's most
notorious gang-flick, The War
riors was, at least it was never
boring. Boulevard Nights may
be the first movie to success
fully make gang warfare unat
tractive by making it seem
deathly dull.
Positives
It's always nice to preface a
critical statement with some
thing positive. Like virtually
every movie, Boulevard Nights
has a couple of things going for
it. One is some snazzy night
photography, which makes
greater Los Angeles look like
the world's largest carnival.
Another nice thing is the
dialogue track, which intelli
gently mixes segments of En
glish and Spanish. It is this use
of dialogue as much as any
thing else that gives the sense

that Boulevard Nights is actu
ally taking place in the barrio.
And, in general, the perfor
mances aren't bad; most of the
actors manage to summon up a
surprising amount of convic
tion in the inanities they're
mouthing.
But even these assets can't
float Boulevard Nights' water
logged plot. It manages to
trash any dramatic impact it
promises through clumsy
handling. The screenwriters
evidently are acquainted with
what constitutes a good drama
tic situation, and they keep
looking as if they're going to
come up with something good.
But by the time the movie's half
over, it is painfully clear that
they're not sure what to do
with what they have. The
movie, instead of becoming
tighter in construction, un
winds in confusion.
Claptrap
The plot is classic formula
claptrap about parallel experi
ences in the lives of two
brothers. One brother, in his
early 20s, is beginning to move
away from his impoverished
origins. He has a steady job and
a loving girlfriend. His younger
brother is something of a prob
lem child. He doesn't care
about school, has trouble
keeping his job, and is a

member of a youth gang (wh
ose members, somewhat baffl
ingly for a teenage gang, appa
rently range in age from 20 to
early middle age).
The person who holds the
two together is their mother,
who, although extremely poor,
still finds time to sit at home
drinking coffee and looking
worried. With a frightening
logic, the mother is destined to
be killed. She is wasted by little
brother's rival gang.
Boulevard Nights is unable
even to exploit the melodrama

tic possibilities of this occurr
ence, much less go on to any
deeper explorations of what
such an event might have on
this family. The filmmakers
don't depict the sense of shock
that must surely come with
such a murder. The death
comes at a wedding party
(another one of those ironic
situations the writers have de
ftly cooked up but don't use),
but there's no hysteria, only a
sort of mournful confusion. If
the filmmakers are trying to say
that life is cheap in this envi

ronment, their message seems
to have been warped on the
way.
To escape some of the con
troversy that has risen up
around The Warriors, the ads
for Boulevard Nights make no
mention of gangs. "Everything
happens on the boulevard,"
they say, "and the boulevard
happens at night." Regardless
of what happens on the
boulevard, Boulevard Slights
seems to have been lost in the
twilight zone between social
comment and pulp fiction.


Janina Fiaikowska, pianist, will present music by Bach, Schoenberg,
Schumann and Chopin at her 8 p.m. concert Tuesday, April 10, in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The event is part of The Lively Arts series.
Fiaikowska is a frequent guest soloist with major orchestras in North
America and Europe, and among her engagements this season are
appearances with the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, the Warsaw
Philharmonic and several orchestras in her native Canada.

has a couple of things going for
it. One is some snazzy night
photography, which makes
greater Los Angeles look like
the world's largest carnival.
Another nice thing is the
dialogue track, which intelli
gently mixes segments of En
glish and Spanish. It is this use
of dialogue as much as any
thing else that gives the sense

that Boulevard Nights is actu
ally taking place in the barrio.
And, in general, the perfor
mances aren't bad; most of the
actors manage to summon up a
surprising amount of convic
tion in the inanities they're
mouthing.
But even these assets can't
float Boulevard Nights' water
logged plot. It manages to
trash any dramatic impact it
promises through clumsy
handling. The screenwriters
evidently are acquainted with
what constitutes a good drama
tic situation, and they keep
looking as if they're going to
come up with something good.
But by the time the movie's half
over, it is painfully clear that
they're not sure what to do
with what they have. The
movie, instead of becoming
tighter in construction, un
winds in confusion.
Claptrap
The plot is classic formula
claptrap about parallel experi
ences in the lives of two
brothers. One brother, in his
early 20s, is beginning to move
away from his impoverished
origins. He has a steady job and
a loving girlfriend. His younger
brother is something of a prob
lem child. He doesn't care
about school, has trouble
keeping his job, and is a

member of a youth gang (wh
ose members, somewhat baffl
ingly for a teenage gang, appa
rently range in age from 20 to
early middle age).
The person who holds the
two together is their mother,
who, although extremely poor,
still finds time to sit at home
drinking coffee and looking
worried. With a frightening
logic, the mother is destined to
be killed. She is wasted by little
brother's rival gang.
Boulevard Nights is unable
even to exploit the melodrama

tic possibilities of this occurr
ence, much less go on to any
deeper explorations of what
such an event might have on
this family. The filmmakers
don't depict the sense of shock
that must surely come with
such a murder. The death
comes at a wedding party
(another one of those ironic
situations the writers have de
ftly cooked up but don't use),
but there's no hysteria, only a
sort of mournful confusion. If
the filmmakers are trying to say
that life is cheap in this envi

ronment, their message seems
to have been warped on the
way.
To escape some of the con
troversy that has risen up
around The Warriors, the ads
for Boulevard Nights make no
mention of gangs. "Everything
happens on the boulevard,"
they say, "and the boulevard
happens at night." Regardless
of what happens on the
boulevard, Boulevard Slights
seems to have been lost in the
twilight zone between social
comment and pulp fiction.


Janina Fiaikowska, pianist, will present music by Bach, Schoenberg,
Schumann and Chopin at her 8 p.m. concert Tuesday, April 10, in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The event is part of The Lively Arts series.
Fiaikowska is a frequent guest soloist with major orchestras in North
America and Europe, and among her engagements this season are
appearances with the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, the Warsaw
Philharmonic and several orchestras in her native Canada.
If Boulevard Nights had even
a few more pretensions about
itself , it would be a disaster of a
movie. As it is, however, it slips
by with just being a minor
mess. The film mixes gang war
fare with a silly "socially re
deeming" love story. The
end-product looks as if West
Side Story was re-edited with a
blender.
If a movie sets out to be bad,
it might at least have the de
cency to move quickly enough
to stay interesting. No matter
how bad this season's most
notorious gang-flick, The War
riors was, at least it was never
boring. Boulevard Nights may
be the first movie to success
fully make gang warfare unat
tractive by making it seem
deathly dull.
Positives
It's always nice to preface a
critical statement with some
thing positive. Like virtually
every movie, Boulevard Nights
has a couple of things going for
it. One is some snazzy night
photography, which makes
greater Los Angeles look like
the world's largest carnival.
Another nice thing is the
dialogue track, which intelli
gently mixes segments of En
glish and Spanish. It is this use
of dialogue as much as any
