## Generation X lacks lead 
### 
There's almost nothing you
could call outstanding about
the British New Wave band
Generation X.
The group's most glaring
weakness is the lack of a strong
lead guitarist. Bob "Derwood"
Andrews, though his chord
work is quite good throughout
the album, often wields his
guitar with obnoxious harsh
ness when he takes the lead.
Instrumentally, the group is
carried by good, consistent
rhythm work from bassist Tony
)ames and drummer Mark Laff.
Vocalist Billy Idol, the most

talented individual member of
the band, makes a few other
wise weak songs listenable.
The best piece on the record
is easily a track called "English
Dream," a driving rock melody
that showcases the best
abilities of each of the group
members.
Generation X does have the
potential to be a very good
band in the mold of The Clash
or The ]am. But some changes
are definitely needed, begin
ning with the addition of a ver
satile lead guitarist so Andrews

can concentrate on the rhythm
work which he does best.
