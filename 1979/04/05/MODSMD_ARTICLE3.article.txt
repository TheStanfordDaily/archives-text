# At both Coffeehouse & Transition
## Tresidder to begin selling beer, wine 
### Brian Wright 
Answering students' desire for a
central gathering place that serves
alcohol, Tresidder Union will be
serving beer and wine probably by
the middle of this month.
TDS, Inc., a privately-ov\ned firm
under contract to manage food ser
vices at Tresidder, holds a beer and
wine license for the first floor of the
Union.
Andy Brooks, TDS's on-campus
manager, said they received the go
ahead to serve beer and wine last
week in a note from Tresidder Direc
tor Dan Williams.
Transition and Coffeehouse
He said Tresidder will begin serv
ing once it lines up suppliers and it
has installed the necessary equip
ment. The beer and wine will be
served in both The Transition and
The Coffeehouse, he said.
The Transition extended its week
night hours in February to 11 p.m.
"The target date for serving beer
and wine is April 16," said Brooks,
but so far TDS hasn't decided what
brands to serve.
TDS has held the license since |an.
1, said Brooks, and the Board of Trus
tees had been notified of the plans to
sell alcohol in October. But some de
tails had to be settled before the go
ahead to serve could be given.
Proposals
Williams said Tresidder adminis
trators first had to receive TDS'
proposals for implementation of the
license. They also had to notify the
University's legal staff, he said.
Williams said TDS submitted the
proposals in February. They were
evaluated by Tresidder, then pre
sented by Williams in March to Dean
of Student Affairs James I yons and to
the legal staff.
Neither Lyons nor the legal staff
had any objections, said Williams, so
Williams was able to give the go
ahead.
The Stanford Public Interest Re
search Group (PIRG), a student
group here, has followed the prog
ress of the plans to serve alcohol.
One of the projects PIRG decided to
undertake was a study of campus

food facilities and formed the Com
mittee to Research Available Eateries
(CRAVE).
Hang out'
"Students are just waiting for
something to open up in general
where they can go and hang out,"
said Mark Breier, a coordinating
member of PIRG who was head of
CRAVE last quarter.
And although Encina Station al
ready serves beer, Tresidder appears
to be the answer.
"Encina is a nice place for events
and activities," said Williams, "but its
primary function is to serve food dur
ing the day to staff in that area, and
that's a good way to use it." He said
the Station isn't conducive to being a
"daytime hangout."
Encina isn't open at night during
the week. Williams said because
most students are on meal plans and
staff are not on campus in the even
ing, there wouldn't be enough busi
ness to justify keeping it open.
Betty Gontero, also a member of
CRAVE, said industrial engineering
students here have made studies to
redesign Tresidder. She said they
have one proposal which calls for a
pub with a dance floor to replace the
bowling alley or reduce the alley's
size. Other ideas are for a beer and
pizza place or a "ski lodge type of
atmosphere."
Union needs pub
Contero said th& union needs a
pub. "A pub type of thing could re
solve alienation problems at Stan
ford," she said, "but I get the feeling
that Williams and the others aren't
gung-ho on the pub idea."
Williams said, though, that it
would be nice to have "an Oasis-type
atmosphere," somewhere in Tresid
der, referring to a popular bar in the
area.
"We want to find what makes
some places so attractive and if there
are characteristics we can dupli
cate," he said.
Williams said about $100,000 has
been budgeted by Tresidder for re
novations in the Transition over the
next two years. But he said costs di

rectly related to serving beer and
wine consist of only a few hundred
dollars for the equipment.
Major renovations
Brooks said Tresidder is "getting
ready to make a decision of some
sort" regarding possible major reno
vations. He said if such changes were
made they could cost anywhere from
"half a million to several million dol

lars."
But he indicated such major reno
vations have not yet reached the
planning stage. "I don't know if Wil
liams has any more money to
spend," he said.
Whatever happens in Tresidder's
more distant future, students soon
won't have to leave campus for that
late night brew.
