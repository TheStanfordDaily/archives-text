Radiation in Pennsylvania dwindles
Harrisburg, Pa. — Radiation levels dwindled to near
normal around the Three Mile Island nuclear power
plant yesterday, and federal officials said they were con
sidering a proposal to take the disabled reactor into cold
shutdown.
And while officials are concerned about the durability
of vital instruments inside the reactor, conditions at the
plant remain "stable," Harold Denton, of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC), said at a briefing.
He confirmed that human error had contributed to the
reactor accident. In Washington, NRC officials de
scribed three separate human errors that contributed to
the crisis.
The first error came when valves on an emergency
pumping system — part of the reactor's coolant system
— were closed, when they should have been open.
Later, an operator turned off the plant's main emergency
core cooling system at the wrong time. Finally, four
standby water pumps were disengaged when there was
no apparent reason for them not to be working.
The string of human errors complicated a situation
that began with the unexplained failure of a water purify
ing unit. Darrell Eisenhut, an NRC engineer, said
mechanical and design problems were major con
tributors to the accident.
Despite evidence of human error, NRC staff members
told the commissioners the plant's operators are "a
well-qualified group."
Rioters protest Bhutto execution
Rawalpindi, Pakistan — Rioting and demonstrations
erupted here and in the neighboring Indian state of
Kashmir yesterday protesting the hanging of former
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. World leaders, who
had tried to save him from the gallows, expressed regret

and anger at the execution.
In Washington, the State Department expressed re
gret over the execution. Spokesman Hodding Carter
noted that President Jimmy Carter had asked for mercy
for Bhutto on humanitarian grounds. A department offi
cial said privately that the president's plea was based in
part on fears of political violence after the hanging.
Bhutto, convicted of ordering the murder of a political
opponent, was taken from his tiny death-row cell and
hanged at 2 a.m. President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who
installed a strict Moslem penal code when he toppled
Bhutto, refused pleas to commute Bhutto's sentence.
Tanzanians sweep into Kampala
Nairobi, Kenya — Tanzanian and Ugandan-exile infan
trymen swept into the downtown area of the Ugandan
capital of Kampala yesterday night, sending President Idi
Amin's cadre of Libyan soldiers fleeing into the coun
tryside, residents reported.
Exile sources said the government of Amin, who has
been accused of murdering tens of thousands of his
countrymen, could fall in a few days or a few hours.
Amin's regular army had already disintegrated, the
exile sources said, claiming the troops sent by Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Khaddafy to aid Amin, a fellow
Moslem, were the only force preserving Amin's eight
year reign.
The Tanzanian-Ugandan war began last October when
Amin sent troops into Tanzania to annex land he said
belonged to Uganda.
