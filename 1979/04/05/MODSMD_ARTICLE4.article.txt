# Senate considers election reform proposals for ballot
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Since the investigations and sub
sequent report of the Election Re
view Board (ERB), which examined
irregularities in the autumn 1977
ASSU Senate elections, the senate
has been embroiled in a battle for
election revision. Spurred onward by
the efforts of the Committee to Re
tire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) last au
tumn to dissolve it, the senate is pre
paring to place constitutional
amendments concerning election re
form on the spring quarter ballot.
The senate voted on preliminary
proposals presented by its Rules
Committee in a meeting Tuesday
night. After these proposals are put
into ballot form by the committee,
thesenatewill holdaspecial meeting
next Tuesday night to ratify the actual
language, which will appear on the
ballot. A two-thirds majority is re
quired for passage.
Five areas
The Rules Committee proposed
reform in five areas: (1) the number
of senators, (2) staggered elections,

(3) districting, (4) ratio of graduate to
undergraduate senators and (5)
slates. According to newly elected
chairperson, George Drysdale, a
third-year law-business student, the
senate was "pretty divided on all is
sues."
The widely diverse opinions of the
senators make consensus on such a
complex issue extremely difficult.
Drysdale said that the aim of the se
nate is to integrate the varying ideas
to "create an optimal system," which
will be acceptable and useful to the
student body.
The Rules Committee's motion to
restructure the current 40-member
senate, 20 senators and 20 alternates,
into a body comprised of 30 voting
members and no alternates, "re
ceived probably the least opposi
tion," Drysdale said. The purpose of
a larger voting membership is to en
courage more participation in com
mittees and in senate activities while
eliminating the apathy inherent in al
ternate positions.
The concept of staggered elec
tions, where 20 senators would be
elected in the autumn and 10 in the
spring, was endorsed 7-5 by the
senators. By staggering the election
periods, as does the U.S. Senate,
continuity and efficiency would be
promoted.
Districting approved
The senate approved districting for
the autumn elections for both
graduates (8-5) and undergraduates
(6-4 with 3 abstentions), although the
Rules Committee originally proposed
only undergraduate districting.
There will be 10 undergraduate
precincts based on residential loca
tions. Separate elections will be held

in each district. Graduates will vote
for their 10 senators on a departmen
tal basis. Representation will be ap
proximately in proportion to the
number of students in a department
or group of departments.
The senators said districting would
provide tighter links between the
senators and their constituents.
Campaigns would be restricted to
one area and senators would be re
sponsible for reporting to a specific
group of students.
By a 7-6 vote, the senate rejected
the committee's recommendation to
hold at-large spring elections with no
distinction between graduates and
undergraduates. Rather than an at
large election, the senate agreed to
hold an election for five graduate and
five undergraduate spots, which
would essentially copy the present
election format.
Low graduate voting
The committee, in observing the
graduate voting turnout, said an end
to distinction between graduate and
undergraduate candidates would
more accurately reflect "the amount
of interest of graduate versus under
graduate students."
That contention was hotly con
tested by senators who defended
equal representation as the tradi
tional tie between the graduate and
undergraduate communities. Drys
dale maintained that an at-large
spring ballot would practically result
in the selection of 10 undergraduate
senators. As the senate conducts
most of its business by majority vote,

a senate dominated by under
graduates "could create dangerous
precedents," he said.
"The general tenet of the senate is
to try to restrict slates (those students
who campaign together)," and to
encourage individual action, accord
ing to Drysdale. Therefore, the se
nate decided to limit campaign
spending to $50 per slate instead of
the currently enforced $50 per per
son restriction. Thus, the financial
incentive to run in groups would be
dissolved.
Besides election reform proposals,
fee assessments and candidates for
senior class presidents, Council of
Presidents and a graduate senate seat
to replace Drysdale as a voting
member will appear on the spring
ballot.

language, which will appear on the
ballot. A two-thirds majority is re
quired for passage.
Five areas
The Rules Committee proposed
reform in five areas: (1) the number
of senators, (2) staggered elections,

(3) districting, (4) ratio of graduate to
undergraduate senators and (5)
slates. According to newly elected
chairperson, George Drysdale, a
third-year law-business student, the
senate was "pretty divided on all is
sues."
The widely diverse opinions of the
senators make consensus on such a
complex issue extremely difficult.
Drysdale said that the aim of the se
nate is to integrate the varying ideas
to "create an optimal system," which
will be acceptable and useful to the
student body.
The Rules Committee's motion to
restructure the current 40-member
senate, 20 senators and 20 alternates,
into a body comprised of 30 voting
members and no alternates, "re
ceived probably the least opposi
tion," Drysdale said. The purpose of
a larger voting membership is to en
courage more participation in com
mittees and in senate activities while
eliminating the apathy inherent in al
ternate positions.
The concept of staggered elec
tions, where 20 senators would be
elected in the autumn and 10 in the
spring, was endorsed 7-5 by the
senators. By staggering the election
periods, as does the U.S. Senate,
continuity and efficiency would be
promoted.
Districting approved
The senate approved districting for
the autumn elections for both
graduates (8-5) and undergraduates
(6-4 with 3 abstentions), although the
Rules Committee originally proposed
only undergraduate districting.
There will be 10 undergraduate
precincts based on residential loca
tions. Separate elections will be held

in each district. Graduates will vote
for their 10 senators on a departmen
tal basis. Representation will be ap
proximately in proportion to the
number of students in a department
or group of departments.
The senators said districting would
provide tighter links between the
senators and their constituents.
Campaigns would be restricted to
one area and senators would be re
sponsible for reporting to a specific
group of students.
By a 7-6 vote, the senate rejected
the committee's recommendation to
hold at-large spring elections with no
distinction between graduates and
undergraduates. Rather than an at
large election, the senate agreed to
hold an election for five graduate and
five undergraduate spots, which
would essentially copy the present
election format.
Low graduate voting
The committee, in observing the
graduate voting turnout, said an end
to distinction between graduate and
undergraduate candidates would
more accurately reflect "the amount
of interest of graduate versus under
graduate students."
That contention was hotly con
tested by senators who defended
equal representation as the tradi
tional tie between the graduate and
undergraduate communities. Drys
dale maintained that an at-large
spring ballot would practically result
in the selection of 10 undergraduate
senators. As the senate conducts
most of its business by majority vote,

a senate dominated by under
graduates "could create dangerous
precedents," he said.
"The general tenet of the senate is
to try to restrict slates (those students
who campaign together)," and to
encourage individual action, accord
ing to Drysdale. Therefore, the se
nate decided to limit campaign
spending to $50 per slate instead of
the currently enforced $50 per per
son restriction. Thus, the financial
incentive to run in groups would be
dissolved.
Besides election reform proposals,
fee assessments and candidates for
senior class presidents, Council of
Presidents and a graduate senate seat
to replace Drysdale as a voting
member will appear on the spring
ballot.
Since the investigations and sub
sequent report of the Election Re
view Board (ERB), which examined
irregularities in the autumn 1977
ASSU Senate elections, the senate
has been embroiled in a battle for
election revision. Spurred onward by
the efforts of the Committee to Re
tire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) last au
tumn to dissolve it, the senate is pre
paring to place constitutional
amendments concerning election re
form on the spring quarter ballot.
The senate voted on preliminary
proposals presented by its Rules
Committee in a meeting Tuesday
night. After these proposals are put
into ballot form by the committee,
thesenatewill holdaspecial meeting
next Tuesday night to ratify the actual
language, which will appear on the
ballot. A two-thirds majority is re
quired for passage.
