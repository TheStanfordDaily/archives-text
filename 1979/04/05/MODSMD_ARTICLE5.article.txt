# Undergrads face changes
## Harvard's new curriculum 
### Dianne Cahoon 
The infamous Stanford of the East,
none other than Harvard University,
will institute a new undergraduate
general education program — enti
tled the Core Curriculum — when
classes commence next fall.
The purpose of the revised cur
riculum is similar to that of Stanford's
familiar distribution requirements:
to establish "minimum standards" of
higher education while asserting
educational priorities, according to a
report presented to the Faculty
Council by Dean of Arts and Sciences
Henry Rosovsky.
The idea of a general education
system at Harvard began in 1945 with
a report, "On the Principles of a
General Education," more com
monly known as the "Red Book," ac
cording to Harvard Crimson reporter
Amy Mcintosh. Thus, a curriculum
termed General Education was estab
lished.
Three areas
That system required students to
pursue two semester courses in each
of three General Education depart
ment areas: Humanities, Social Sci
ences and Natural Sciences. De
partmental courses could be substi
tuted for these classes on a two-for
one basis.
Distribution requirements also
mandated that a student take at least
two classes in each of the two major
divisions outside his concentration
or major. Thus, Harvard adminis
trators anticipated that a student

would allot one-half of his under
graduate life to his concentration
and split the other half of his time
evenly between General Education
requisites and electives.
Maxine Pfeffer, a sophomore
member of a Core standing commit
tee and original head of the recently
created Student Assembly, remarked
that the Core would not change that
basic format. Rather, Rosovsky's re
port emphasized that "the proposal
of the Core Curriculum is merely a
structural change of General Educa
tion intended to facilitate future
educational improvements at Har
vard."
Eliminate vague subjects
The Core Curriculum will attempt
to eliminate the overbroad and
vague subjects of General Education,
Rosovsky's memorandum to the fa
culty stated, "The goal of the Core is
to encourage a critical appreciation
of and informed acquaintance with
major approaches to knowledge . . .
in substantive terms."
Sophomore Skip Stern, a Harvard
representative at the Little Eleven
conference and a member of the
Core standing committee on applied
sciences, said that Rosovsky claimed,
"There will be no guts ('micks' or
easy classes) in the Core."
The Core Curriculum will be com
prised of five areas, 10 subareas with
around 10 courses per subarea, in an
effort to focus upon the individual
student and successfully answer the
question: "What does Harvard mean

when it welcomes a student at
graduation 'to the company of edu
cated men and women?' "
Specifically, the five major areas
and their subareas are: 1) Literature
and the Arts, 2) History, 3) Social and
Philosophical Analysis, 4) Science
and Mathematics, and 5) Foreign
Languages and Cultures.
A semester apiece of Expository
Writing, General Mathematics with
minimal computer familiarity and
foreign languages will also be re
quired with several means for
exemption. Details are still being de
bated on all these requirements.
Students must take one semester
course from each subarea, but be
cause of the interdisciplinary nature
of many of these fields, one course
could conceivably fulfill more than
one requirement. Rosovsky, in his
study, foresaw a maximum of eight
semester courses necessary to meet
the Core demands.
Purpose eroded
Although the immediate reason
for the curriculum change in Rosovs
ky's report as a "wide agreement that
the proliferation of courses had
eroded the purpose of the existing
General Education Program," the
roots of the revision date back much
further. Dean Charles Whitlock said
that when Derek Bok took office as
the president of Harvard in 1971 he
said his "first priority was to review
the undergraduate curriculum."
