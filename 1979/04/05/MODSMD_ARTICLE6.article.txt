# Gas leak caused by workmen
## 
### Nancy Koehn Michael Prince 
Valley Electric Co. workmen, dig
ging a ditch near Encina Gym, acci
dently ruptured the main gas line for
the gymnasium releasing flammable
natural gas into the air in front of the
athletic complex here yesterday
morning.
Workers from the Bay Area utility
sliced through a Pacific Gas and Elec
tric Co. (PG&E) gas line with an au
tomatic ditch-digger as they attemp
ted to install wiring for a new set of
gym lights. According to Jack Setney,
general foreman for PG&E, Valley
Electric Co. workers did attempt to
locate sunken gas lines before be
ginning ditch work, but failed to de
tect this line.
The line was under 30 to 50 pounds
of pressure, according to Setney.
The escaping natural gas did not en
danger public safety because it was
released in an open area, he said.
Palo Alto firefighters were sum
moned to Encina Gym. Fire Dept.
Captain Harold Callaway said, "A gas
leak is always dangerous, but there
was no immediate danger to public
safety in an open area. It was a minor
incident."
According to Callaway, the fire de
partment was contacted at approxi
mately 11:20 yesterday morning and
responded immediately. Firefighters
and University police officials re
mained at the accident site until the
leak was repaired in order to keep
the public away from the area.
Setney reported that the leak was
repaired by a PG&E crew. Repairmen
shut off the gas meter and clamped
the flexible plastic pipes shut until
the leak was closed. The repair work
took about an hour, according to
Setney.
Setney also said PG&E would
probably not charge Valley Electric
Co. for the repair work. He
explained, "In this case, we wouldn't
charge them. If they hadn't made an
effort to locate sunken gas lines, we
would. However, they did make this
effort."
Encina Gym staffers reported that
few persons were present outside
the gym at the time of the rupture
and dismissed the incident as insig
nificant.
