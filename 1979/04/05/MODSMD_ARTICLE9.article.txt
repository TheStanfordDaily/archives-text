# Evans awaits electric chair
## Americans favor death penalty 
### 
New York (AP) â€” With the first execution in
this country in more than two years scheduled
for tomorrow, most Americans remain in favor
of the death penalty for those convicted of mur
der, an Associated Press-NBC News poll shows.
And the public is convinced capital punish
ment does deter some people from committing
murder.
Sixty-two percent of those interviewed March
19 and 20 said they favor the death penalty for
/persons convicted of murder.
That support is down somewhat from levels
found last year. It is four points below the find
ing of the November AP-NBC News poll and
seven points below the September survey.
Last month, 24 percent opposed the death
penalty and 14 percent were not sure.
This finding comes as convicted murderers
are scheduled to die soon in Alabama and
Florida.
No one has been executed in the United
States since |an. 17, 1977, when a Utah firing
squad killed Gary Cilmore. Gilmore, who said
he wanted to die, was the first person to suffer
capital punishment in this country after 10 years
of Supreme Court challenges of death penalty
laws in individual states.
The next man to be executed could be John
Louis Evans 111, scheduled to die in the early
morning hours of April 6 at Holman Prison in

Atmore, Ala. The 29-year-old native of Beaum
ont, Texas, was sentenced to the electric chair
for the jan. 5, 1977, shooting death of a
pawnshop owner in Mobile, Ala.
Also close to the electric chair is John Spen
kelink, who is on Florida's death row awaiting
the outcome of a final clemency hearing. That
hearing is scheduled April 20. The U.S. Supreme
Court refused March 26 to review his case.
Many supporters of the death penalty argue
that the threat of the ultimate punishment de
ters some people from committing murder.
Most Americans agree with that argument, the
AP-NBC Poll shows.
Seventy-one percent of those questioned ag
reed that the death penalty is a deterrent and 25
percent disagreed. Four percent of the 1600
adults interviewed nationwide by telephone
said they were not sure.
As with any sample survey, the results of the
AP-NBC News polls could differ from the results
of interviews with all Americans with telephones
because of chance variations in the sample.
For polls with 1600 interviews, the results
should vary no more than three percentage
points either way simply because of sample er
rors. That is, there is only one chance out of 20
that the results of interviews with all American
adults would vary from these results by more
than three percentage points.
