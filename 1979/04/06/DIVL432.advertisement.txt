The lighter the car, the
less power it takes to move it.
That's the most important
thing to know when you're
trying to decide what engine
to order for your car.
The power-to-weight
theory holds true no matter
how you intend to use your
car: city, highway or subur
ban driving; with two passen
gers or six; with a small
trailer or pulling a heavy
boat.
Since we redesigned al
most all our cars to make
them lighter and more effi
cient, the power-to-weight
theory enables us to move
them with smaller engines
that use less gas. You can get
good performance from a
full-size GM car under most
conditions with a six-cylinder
or a small eight-cylinder en
gine instead of a larger op
tional VB. Mid-size cars,
luxury cars, and redesigned
compacts to be introduced
this spring follow the same
pattern.
