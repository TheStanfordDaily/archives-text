Rom the folks who brought us BART.
The very same companies responsible for
our "fail-safe" BART system now present the
Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.
With a lot of help from PG&E, they
managed to complete the plant six years behind
schedule and $1,000,000,000 over bid.
They also managed to place the plant
within three miles of a massive earthquake fault.
Now they want us to pay for it.
Join Ralph Nader, Bonnie Raitt and
thousands more at the Stop Diablo Rally and
Alternative Energy Fair, noon on Saturday,
April 7, at the San Francisco Civic Center.
PG&E is making the mistake of our lives.
We have the power to stop them.

RUSH IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET NEW PEOPLE AND
GET A FIRST-HAND IDEA OF SORORITIES AT STANFORD.
HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE!!!
RUSH IN A NUTSHELL — We've designed this rush to be open, casual and fun! The first
night you'll have a chance to meet all eight groups. The open houses that follow both weeks
are OPEN open houses — that means that they are open to anyone whether or not you've
been to other events. Coming to as many events as possible makes it easier for you to get to
know us and vice versa. You'll be invited to different parties over the weekend and the
following Monday, invitations will go out for preference parties. You can go to a maximum
of two parties on Tuetday, so you're narrowing down your choices. After the second
party, you'll sign a card ranking your top choices. On Wednesday, bids will be distributed all
afternoon.
