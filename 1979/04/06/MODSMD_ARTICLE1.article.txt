# U.S. used nuclear threat in Vietnam, Ellsberg says
## 
### Fran Miller 
In a lecture laden with witty anecdotes and per
sonal asides, Daniel Ellsberg said in Kresge Au
ditorium Wednesday night that the United States
has threatened the first-strike use of nuclear
weapons as a foreign policy bargaining tool.
Ellsberg, who became famous upon his release
of the Pentagon Papers in 1971, said that sources
told him that part of then-President Richard Ni
xon's secret strategy to end the Vietnam War was
to force the North Vietnamese to accept American
terms by threatening nuclear war.
Expressing his frustration at the administration's
theory that one cannot negotiate without a threat
of escalation, the former White House consultant
said the idea behind this policy was "to find the
breaking point of Vietnam and exceed it."
Newly appointed ASSU Guest Professor
Ellsberg's lecture opened his course "Nuclear
Weapons and U.S. Foreign Policy." He told an
audience of more than 600 of the decision process
which led to the escalation of U.S. involvement in
Vietnam.
"I was 14 when the atom bomb was dropped on
Hiroshima," Ellsberg said. "The idea of initiating
nuclear war, which (then-Secretary of State Henry)
Kissinger was recommending . . . struck me as evil
an act as could be imagined for the survival of the
human species. I always felt I would give my life to
avert a small nuclear war of the kind Kissinger was
talking about as an instrument of policy. I still feel
that way."

Ellsberg said he returned from a government
assignment in Vietnam "determined to see us get
out."When Kissingerasked him todrawupa set of
policies to deal with the war situation, nuclear
weapons were not included. Ellsberg also did not
include in the policies a "win option," because, he
said, he did not feel there was any way to win the
war.
Ellsberg said he was anguished that not even the
biggest anti-war movement in history deterred
Nixon from employing a "madman theory" — an
approach used by Adolf Hitler which Ellsberg had
analyzed in lectures he gave in 1959. Ellsberg said
Nixon planned to "use his madness" and to man
ipulate North Vietnam's fear of him to get what he
wanted.
"Every president has made such threats,"
Ellsberg said. This form of diplomacy, he added,
has been in existence for 5000 years.
The recipient of a Ph.U. in economics from Har
vard, Ellsberg studied decision and game theory
and their applications to conflict. He also received
a B.A. in economics from Harvard in 1952, when
the most important problem in the world was
"preventing the Soviets from being tempted to
use what we assumed would be an overwhelming
advantage and strike force."
In 1959, tllsberg said, he delivered a lecture at
Boston's Lowell Institute on "The Art of Coer
cion," and Kissinger was among the listeners.
Asserting that the former Secretary is "very intel
ligent" but "not a man for footnotes — a

plagiarist," Ellsberg criticized Kissinger's theory
that advocates the limited use of tactical nuclear
weapons. This policy, Ellsberg said, was "oppor
tunistic and not sound"; a threat like nuclear
weapons does not have to be perfectly credible to
work.
Ellsberg ended his lecture with a quote from his
son Robert, who was tried for protesting against
the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Production Facil
ity: "Rocky Flats is the Auschwitz of our time. In
each bomb is another holocaust, perhaps for the
children of Moscow, Peking (or) Hanoi."
Ellsberg received a standing ovation at the con
clusion of the lecture. One student commented,
"To be able to talk for an hour and a half and still
get laughs is pretty amazing." Although another
said that the subject was "frightening as hell,"
others said that the lecture dragged and included
too many digressions, making it hard to follow.
One political science major declared that "al
though the subject matter is fascinating and
Ellsberg is an eminent authority on it, he should
have been sentenced to 115 years in prison for his
release of the papers."
Ellsberg's course, an Undergraduate Special,
has an extensive reading list, including selections
from H.R. Haldeman's The Ends of Power, and
Richard Nixon's Memoirs. It has been approved by
the history department for credit toward their
major.
