## Shut down Rancho Seco 
### 
The week-long drama that continues
to unfold at the Three Mile Island nuc
lear plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
will clearly have a major impact on the
future of nuclear power in the United
States. Although the exact cause of the
accident is as yet undetermined, the
events of the past nine days have
sparked what promises to be — and
should be — a comprehensive revalua
tion of the risks involved with nuclear
power.
As part of this essential reevaluation,
we support Gov. Jerry Brown's desire to
"err on the side of caution" in his re
quest to the Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission to close the Rancho Seco nuc
lear plant near Sacramento temporarily
as a precautionary measure. The Rancho
Seco plant was built by the Babcock &
Wilcox Company, one of the nation's
major builders of nuclear power plants,
which also built the Three Mile Island
reactor.
According to the New York Times,
Babcock & Wilcox reactors have appa
rently been plagued by a considerable
number of deficiencies over the past few
years. Last August 9, a Babcock & Wilcox
official said in a letter to the Toledo Edi
son Company of Ohio that a severe and
unexpected change in the temperature
of the Rancho Seco reactor in California
might indicate problems for the Edison
reactor in Ohio.

In the light of the Three Mile Island
accident, we also find Energy Secretary
James Schlesinger's recent statement
that Congress snould act to speed up
licensing for nuclear power plants to be
ill-advised. Despite his assurances that
legislation whicn would reduce from 11
years to about six years the time it takes
to approve, license and begin building a
nuclear plant would only cut back on
paperwork, not consideration of safety
issues. Such a move would only encour
age the proliferation of nuclear energy at
a time when serious questions about
safety continue to be raised and remain
unsolved.
One factor that has encouraged the
utilities to press forward in their advo
cacy of nuclear power has been the
Price-Anderson Act, a piece of legisla
tion which limits the liability of the
utilities for death, injury or property
damage in the event of a nuclear acci
dent to a total of $550 million.
Putting a price on human life is repug
nant, but when one considers that the
Three Mile Island accident potentially
threatened 950,000 people, $550 million
becomes a paltry figure. The repeal of
this legislation would certainly make the
companies involved more accountable
and force them in their own self-interest
to assess the risks of nuclear power more
carefully. The chilling example of the
Three Mile Island incident demands this
type of reassessment.
