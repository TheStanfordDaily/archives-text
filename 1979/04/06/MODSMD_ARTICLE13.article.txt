# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Charlson et al. Dissent: more facts needed 
### 
Certainly the accident at
Three Mile Island was serious
and without question it points
up the need for development
of alternative energy sources
now. But everyone agreed on
these points in the consensus
editorial.
What we are unwilling to do
is to condemn the entire nuc
lear industry because of one
mishap. Certain new
safeguards may be necessary,
but this can only be deter
mined after the NRC has de

termined actually what hap
pened in Pennsylvania. Com
ments concerning the cause of
the accident are little more
than speculation at this point.
Gov. Jerry Brown's re
quested closure of the Rancho
Seco nuclear plant was purely a
political move, and there is no
thing to indicate such a move,
against that or any other plant,
is warranted.
Moreover, because the de
tails of James Schlesinger's
plan to shorten the number of

years required for reactor
licensing are less than com
plete, we feel it is at best pre
mature to condemn the plan.
Most people who have had a
reasonable exposure to gov
ernment regulatory agencies
know that there is often an in
ordinate amount of red tape,
much of which is totally mean
ingless.
If Schlesinger's motive is, as
he states, just to remove a
bunch of red tape, we support
the idea. If he plans to in any
way alter the safeguards re
quired in the direction of more
leniency, we do not. But until
the plan is released in toto, it
seems foolish to label it "un
wise."
Overall, in view of the en
vironmental problems with
coal and oil-fired plants, not to
mention the soaring cost of
them, the most unwise move
would appear to be scrapping
nuclear power â€” at least be
fore we even have a chance to
find out what happened.
(Mike Charlson wrote this
minority opinion on behalf of
editorial board members Emily
Sachar, Sara Lessley, Craig De
nnis and himself.)
