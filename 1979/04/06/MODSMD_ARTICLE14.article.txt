## Dissent: attend rally 
### 
The past record of the nuc
lear industry does not justify
the risks that are currently
being taken with innocent
lives. Space here is inadequate
to fully present the case against
nuclear power. But until reac
tor safety problems, nuclear
waste disposal problems,
thermal pollution, and ques
tions about private control of
nuclear plants are resolved, we
believe that opposition to nuc-

Lear power is essential. We
therefore urge everyone to ex
press their opposition to nuc
lear power in general and the
Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in
particular by attending the
noon rally tomorrow at the San
Francisco Civic Center.
