## Down with controversial ideas 
### 
You, the reader, are accus
tomed to looking at this part of
the paper and seeing a con
troversial issue discussed in
lumbering prose. You read a
ripping editorial that eventu
ally rolls to a stop over a space
marked, "Yes, I'm for it" or a
space which firmly pro
nounces, "No, I'm against it."
Then you arrive at a soggy
cornflake, an angel fallen from
your gaping mouth.
Why is your mouth open,
you may be asking. Perhaps
because you are yawning,
bored with the fiery prose of
the article? No, you are angry.
Of course you are! You are
wondering: "How can any
thing be so opinionated, so
biased, so one-sided and so
basically uncool?" You are flus
tered and insulted, as well you
should be.
Hey! Out there! Yes,
people, you are Stanford stu
dents! That's right, the pick of
the litter, the bee's knees, top
two percentile â€” whatever you
want to call it. You don't have
to listen to some moron who
owns a pen and a postage
stamp. Why should you? All he
does is try to give you indiges
tion at breakfast by spouting
off some strong sentiment
that, chances are, is clouded
and colored by some personal
prejudice.
Nobody likes to be pushed
around, let alone people who,
once given their diplomas, will
be out there doing most of the
pushing in this world. That's
right, cream of the crop, you
know what you want to hear.
Controversial issues can only
cause stress and general up

tightness. Besides, eating stale
donuts and drinking brown
battery acid is bad enough
without having to deal with
some opinionated statement
from some pointy-headed
graduate student who doesn't
have enough work.
Enough is enough! We need
editorials that take a softer
stand or at least come out in

How can anything be so opinionated, so
biased, so one-sided and so basically
uncool?

the wash. Whatever happened
to editorial titles like, "Tuition
needs to be lowered," "Food
service could use some im
provement," "There are too
many bikes" and "People
should be nice?" Instead, we
get editorials that cover goopy,
messy issues like South Africa,
rape and the Honor Code.
Yecch! Who really wants to

deal with such bummer, nega
tive issues that only serve to
confuse people? This colum
nist would rather remove the
contact lenses of a great white
shark with a pitchfork.
Now that you agree with me,
we can all work together to
make the editorial page fun
again. Let's hear it for articles
like: "Up with study breaks,"

"Up with classes that are pretty
easy but are not really micks,"
"Up with happiness, "Up with
anything. . .
Of course, we will have to
draw the line at "Up with Free
Speech. .. ."
