## Zen and the art of self-definition 
### 
Two of the most fundamental questions
we ask in defining ourselves are "Who am
I and what do I believe?" As we grow, we
look around us at the great variety of val
ues and beliefs and weigh them, eventu
ally adopting some and rejecting others.
Thus we decide who we are and what we
believe.
Once we begin to look outward for the
terms by which we define ourselves, how
ever, those terms begin to define us. We
begin taking our feelings of self-worth
from factors which are startlingly external
to what we are as people, as human be
ings.
Take, for instance, the ever-recurring
phenomenon of college ratings. When
one recent rating received publicity in the
Daily, I heard various people primping
their feathers; since Stanford was rated
number one, that cast them in a similar
light. Certainly there is a connection bet
ween a student and his or her university.
Sometimes, though, it seems that instead
of looking inward and evolving a self
definition and sense of worth from our
own personal qualities and beliefs, our
first impulse is to look to systems and in
stitutions for the answers we seek. We
take on a passive posture; we allow the
University, for instance, to define us, to
mold our self-images. I find this both limit
ing and frightening.

The same process is evident in the grad
ing system. We learn early on that good
grades mean we are doing well. We get
patted on the head; we begin to feel we
are good people. The fine lines and links
here often become blurred.
This is the crux of the problem: we learn
to link our schoolwork with our self
worth. I hasten tosaythisisn'tafaultylink,
but it is potentially destructive. We have
come to define ourselves so wholly in
terms of our grades that our self-worth is
directly hooked up to someone else's
judgment of our performance. We
generalize our grades to reflect our worth
as human beings.
If we can keep our perspective and
realize such things are only facets of what
and who we are, the destructiveness of
such links is minimal. However, in an at
mosphere which is so highly competitive,
we must work at retaining such a perspec
tive. We must not allow ourselves to ba
lance our feelings of self-esteem so wholly
and precariously upon something which is
more external to us than we may at times
(during finals, for instance) believe.
We allow external factors to define us in
aligning ourselves with sets of political be
liefs as well. Indeed, we adopt values be
cause we agree with them, because we
believe in them. (I ignore here values
"adopted" for reasons of status or pre
stige.) But often we find that political be

liefs "come in sets" â€” they "go together,"
and because we believe one thing, we
adopt the others in the package. We do it
to Be Consistent. Everyone wants to Be
Consistent.
True, if we have certain general values
we will be prone to believe in specific
modes of change or of government. But
the demand for consistency leaves no
room for second thoughts; people won't
tolerate you if you appear to be inconsis
tent. If your beliefs don't fall into a pre
arranged pattern, you're an enigma no
one knows how to deal with.
I have often found myself feeling pres
sured to adopt beliefs in sets, and I find I
don't agree with all the values which are
supposed to go together. I find I have too
many questions the proposed catechism
won't answer. I find the only way I can
think and question freely is if I defy all
definitions and categories.
In our search for self-definition, we
often seek a clear, well-defined image of
who we are to pin on our wall and
double-check for consistency. I feel, how
ever, that the sharper the lines with which
we define ourselves, the narrower is the
space we allow ourselves to fly in. The
fewer definitions we place on ourselves,
the more boundless we become.
