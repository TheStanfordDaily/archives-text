## Live by morality, not rationalism 
### 
America's inability to create
institutions within its borders
that people trust, and its impo
tence in the world arena are
the inevitable result of two
fundamental beliefs in current
society; the belief in
rationalism and the belief that
people are basically good.
Rationalism destroys our abil
ity to take firm stances based
on the concepts of right and
wrong, forin a rationalist world
there can be no true moral
principles.
The belief in people's inhe
rent goodness forces us away
from trying to change people
or attack them because they
are evil. It moves us toward the
destruction of the institutions
in our society which have made
it possible for us to prosper.
Both make it difficult for us to
condemn even Hitler or the
Khmer Rouge.
Rationalism and goodness
make us look for reasons why
evil is committed and take
away the concept of personal
responsibility. Recently, two
14-year-olds in New York City
sprayed gasoline into a subway
token change booth and ig
nited it, killing one woman and
critically burning another.
They did it because the women
pointed them out to a police
man when they jumped the
turnstile a few days before.
Our rationalism forces us to
ask why they did something so
horrible. Because we believe
people are good, some force
must have perverted their
basic goodness. The forces we
damn are those that create the
structure, the schools, the

economic system and the
courts of our society. Though
they may have played a part,
what of the thousands and mill
ions of other disadvantaged
children who do not kill
people? The idea that some
people are predisposed to
ward good and some toward
evil would explain this. In
stead, we deny free will and
force ourselves to put the
blame on ourselves in some
masochistic orgy.
The concept that people are
basically good has an inevita
ble corollary: that I, an indi
vidual, am basically good. This
concept is the moral shield
which the revolutionists of the
world polish and use as a mir
ror. Since they and all people
are good and yet there is evil,
this evil is a result of bad in
stitutions. Hence, when they
go forth to bomb buildings and
destroy the people inside
them, they can be confident
they are good and whatever
means they use are justified
because they are fighting evil.
When it comes to dealing
with the world, America has
been repeatedly trapped in a
quagmire caused by a gut-level
feeling that some things are
wrong and cannot be toler
ated. Americans then attempt
to justify actions that would
stem from this with rational ar
guments. Any morality which is
not based on the concept of a
divine law is subjective and
what little meaning it has oper
ates only within the confines of
one society. There can be no
absolutes. As a result, Ameri

cans manage to get very
worked up over some action
that they have taken, like the
ClA's role in Chile or our role
in Vietnam, but one must have
a keen ear to hear a murmur
about two million people killed
by the Khmer Rouge in Cam
bodia.
The frightening product of
the concept that right and
wrong are determined within
each person are that even the
Nuremberg trials have been at
tacked as improper.
Some claim we were trying
to impose our own morality on
the society of the Third Reich
and that within that society,
Eichmann and Hitler were
doing what they considered
good. Rationalism can go no
further than saying that "what
was wrong with Hitler or is
wrong with Idi Amin is that we
don't like it."
While Western society be
lieves that reason can lead to
good, the United States and

the West will remain in their
current impotent state. It is un
likely that a religious re
surgence in the West based on
principles claimed to be from
Cod (hence absolute and not
relative) is going to take place
and give us some clear direc
tion. If the United States is to
regain its role as leader of the
world it has to have more faith
and less rationality in its sys
tem.
It has to concentrate on the
standards which it does have,
freedom of speech, religion
and economic opportunity. It
has to stop browbeating itself
about what is right and wrong
on an intellectual level. It must
go forth with strength and de
termination based on gut-level
feelings that the deprivation of
people's freedom and totalita
rian butchery are wrong and
must be fought before those
evils enslave the world.

further than saying that "what
was wrong with Hitler or is
wrong with Idi Amin is that we
don't like it."
While Western society be
lieves that reason can lead to
good, the United States and

the West will remain in their
current impotent state. It is un
likely that a religious re
surgence in the West based on
principles claimed to be from
Cod (hence absolute and not
relative) is going to take place
and give us some clear direc
tion. If the United States is to
regain its role as leader of the
world it has to have more faith
and less rationality in its sys
tem.
It has to concentrate on the
standards which it does have,
freedom of speech, religion
and economic opportunity. It
has to stop browbeating itself
about what is right and wrong
on an intellectual level. It must
go forth with strength and de
termination based on gut-level
feelings that the deprivation of
people's freedom and totalita
rian butchery are wrong and
must be fought before those
evils enslave the world.

America's inability to create
institutions within its borders
that people trust, and its impo
tence in the world arena are
the inevitable result of two
fundamental beliefs in current
society; the belief in
rationalism and the belief that
people are basically good.
Rationalism destroys our abil
ity to take firm stances based
on the concepts of right and
wrong, forin a rationalist world
there can be no true moral
principles.
The belief in people's inhe
rent goodness forces us away
from trying to change people
or attack them because they
are evil. It moves us toward the
destruction of the institutions
in our society which have made
it possible for us to prosper.
Both make it difficult for us to
condemn even Hitler or the
Khmer Rouge.
Rationalism and goodness
make us look for reasons why
evil is committed and take
away the concept of personal
responsibility. Recently, two
14-year-olds in New York City
sprayed gasoline into a subway
token change booth and ig
nited it, killing one woman and
critically burning another.
They did it because the women
pointed them out to a police
man when they jumped the
turnstile a few days before.
Our rationalism forces us to
ask why they did something so
horrible. Because we believe
people are good, some force
must have perverted their
basic goodness. The forces we
damn are those that create the
structure, the schools, the

economic system and the
courts of our society. Though
they may have played a part,
what of the thousands and mill
ions of other disadvantaged
children who do not kill
people? The idea that some
people are predisposed to
ward good and some toward
evil would explain this. In
stead, we deny free will and
force ourselves to put the
blame on ourselves in some
masochistic orgy.
The concept that people are
basically good has an inevita
ble corollary: that I, an indi
vidual, am basically good. This
concept is the moral shield
which the revolutionists of the
world polish and use as a mir
ror. Since they and all people
are good and yet there is evil,
this evil is a result of bad in
stitutions. Hence, when they
go forth to bomb buildings and
destroy the people inside
them, they can be confident
they are good and whatever
means they use are justified
because they are fighting evil.
When it comes to dealing
with the world, America has
been repeatedly trapped in a
quagmire caused by a gut-level
feeling that some things are
wrong and cannot be toler
ated. Americans then attempt
to justify actions that would
stem from this with rational ar
guments. Any morality which is
not based on the concept of a
divine law is subjective and
what little meaning it has oper
ates only within the confines of
one society. There can be no
absolutes. As a result, Ameri

cans manage to get very
worked up over some action
that they have taken, like the
ClA's role in Chile or our role
in Vietnam, but one must have
a keen ear to hear a murmur
about two million people killed
by the Khmer Rouge in Cam
bodia.
The frightening product of
the concept that right and
wrong are determined within
each person are that even the
Nuremberg trials have been at
tacked as improper.
Some claim we were trying
to impose our own morality on
the society of the Third Reich
and that within that society,
Eichmann and Hitler were
doing what they considered
good. Rationalism can go no
further than saying that "what
was wrong with Hitler or is
wrong with Idi Amin is that we
don't like it."
