Meat-cleaver
fantasy
The recent libertarian diat
ribe by David Miller (Daily,
March 6) in which he calls for a
policy of isolationism by the
United States, smacks of the
meat-cleaver' approach to
problem-solving so typical in
libertarian writing. Miller
would prevent the U.S. gov
ernment from bungling
foreign affairs by terminating
virtually all such affairs. Al
though our foreign policy has
been badly, if not corruptly,

managed, this is hardly the way
to correct our mistakes.
Miller calls for a termination
ofall military and economicaid
to foreign countries, and
further says: "We should not
oppose but welcome the over
throw of most of the current
governments on this planet."
Simple, isn't it? We just sit at
home, fat and happy, and let
the world go to hell in its own
way! The trouble with this
simple-minded approach is
that the fat-and-happy days
would soon be gone.
The United States imports
many materials essential to our

industries and our national de
fense. If such resources are
locked up by countries un
friendly to Americans, we've
got trouble.
Isolationism might work in a
nontechnological world, or
one comprising totally self
sufficient nations. Unfortu
nately, this planet does not fit
either description. The liberta
rian approach to foreign policy
— eliminating it — belongs to
the world of fantasy.
