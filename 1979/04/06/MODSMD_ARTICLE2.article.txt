# Campus police test broader probe powers to save time
## 
### Liz Schermer 
Officers of the Dept. of Public Safety here will be
permitted to conduct field investigations on all campus
crimes for a 90-day trial period under a new agreement
between the University and Santa Clara County Sheriff
Robert Winter. The trial period began April 1.
Previously, University police could investigate only
non-felony crimes against persons and property crimes
involving less than $1000.
According to Director of Public Safety Marvin Her
rington, the previous procedure was awkward for the
victims and excessively time consuming. "Many times
the victim didn't understand why we were doing it (the
old) way," he s.iid.
Repeat interviews
Under the former policy, a University police officer
could begin an investigation, but after establishing that
the crime involved more than $1000, the officer would
have to wait while a sheriff's deputy arrived to continue
the investigation.
The deputy often had to repeat interviews with victims
and witnesses, resulting in delays in the investigations.
The new procedure will save time for the victim as well as
police here and the sheriff's officers, according to Her
rington.
Herrington said that the sheriff's office still reserves
the right to conduct follow-up investigations while the
new agreement is in effect.
The new policy will not cause any changes in staffing
or costs for the police department here, according to
Herrington. He noted, "It's not a massive change. It's a
more efficient way of conducting our business."
Less than 5 percent of police activity will be affected by
the new procedure. Herrington stated that out of ap
proximately 600 crimes committed over the past six
months, only 21 had to be referred to the sheriff's office.

The addition of this number of cases would not substan
tially increase the workload of University police officers,
according to Herrington.
After the three-month trial period is over, the new
procedure will be evaluated and a decision will be made
on whether to continue it.
Benefits, costs reduced
According to Herrington, other changes in police ser
vices will occur at the end of spring quarter in order to
save approximately $50,000 annually. Following a zero
based budgeting review by the police department and
the Office of Business and Finance, bicycle licensing,
fingerprinting and evening police office hours will be
curtailed.
Staff benefits and overtime costs will be reduced and
two of the 22 community service officer positions will be
eliminated. Community service officers are non
deputized and are responsible for such jobs as parking
enforcement and building checks. Herrington said that
he will cut no police positions.
Herrington explained that zero-based budgeting
meansÂ«ach area of the department starts with no money
and must justify every expense, not just new ones. Often
new budgets are based on the previous year's budget,
requiring an explanation only for increases.
Services eliminated
Although services such as bike licensing and finger
printing will be phased out over the summer, Her
rington said, he will "try to provide some sort of service
for the fall."
He hopes to be able to have a short period at the
beginning of each quarter for licensing and the finger
printing of law, education and other students seeking
certain professional jobs. The police department re
ceives no money for either bike licensing or the finger
printing service, according to Herrington.
