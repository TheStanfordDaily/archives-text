# As a 'last resort' for patients
## American Cancer Society chief backs marijuana treatment 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The pres
ident of the American Cancer
Society (ACS) says marijuana
seems to relieve the cruel side
effects of some cancer
therapies and doctors should
be able to use the controversial
drug as a last resort.
"The physician who is treat
ing patients with cancer . . .
should have everything at his
disposal and be able to use it if
it will help," Dr. LaSalle Leffall
said in an interview this week.
"The evidence does support
the fact that it (marijuana) can
help the patient."
That conclusion is supported
by a growing body of scientific
research and a long history of
informal — and illegal — use of
the drug by many cancer pa
tients undergoing
chemotherapy.
"The role of the physician is
to cure whenever possible. But
if you can't cure, the least you
should be able to do is give the

patient some relief from his
pain and suffering," said Lef
fall, chairman of the surgery
department at Howard Univer
sity Medical School in
Washington, D.C. He was in
Los Angeles for this week's
ACS-sponsored cancer con
ference.
The federal government still
classifies marijuana, along with
heroin, LSD and other drugs,
as a Schedule I substance: No
medical value and high poten
tial for abuse.
The Cancer Society's official
position, adopted last year,
says only that marijuana has
promise and warrants more
"controlled clinical trials," a
spokesman said.
But since 1978, at least a
half-dozen legislatures have
passed state laws allowing doc
tors to prescribe marijuana for
some chemotherapy patients.
Such programs usually are de
scribed officially as research

and require case-by-case re
view by a medical board. Simi
lar measures are generating
controversy in other states.
Leffall said neither he nor the
society would become in
volved in legislative debates,
although such state action "is
not totally inappropriate."
Marijuana is being discus
sed, not as a treatment of
cancer, but as a way to relieve
the sometimes-devastating
side effects of potent anti
cancer drugs.
Letall said the side effects
often include severe nausea,
vomiting and loss of appetite.
"More and more we hear pa
tients say, 'I'm not going to
take this chemotherapy be
cause I hear the treatment is
worse than the disease,' " he
said. That fear can mean ac
cepting almost inevitable
death or turning to unproven
and often useless treatments.
Several approved drugs are

used to combat the side-effects
but, Leffall said, "if it seems
that other forms of treatment
are not effective, then the use
of marijuana under a physi
cian's care does seem war
ranted. I would be in favor of
using it."
In New Mexico, first of the
states to approve marijuana
therapy laws, the program's
administrator said, "I'd say we
have a resounding success on
our hands. We have people
who, for the first time, are not
only not experiencing nausea
and vomiting, but they've been
eating a full meal" after the
chemotherapy treatments.
Dr. Edward Deaux said 12 pa
tients are now in the program,
which will ultimately total
perhaps 150 people. ,
New Mexico gets its
marijuana cigarettes from a
five-acre plot cultivated for the
federal government in Missis
sippi. Deaux said the program

also uses a synthetic version of
marijuana's active ingredient,
called THC.
Dr. Sidney Cohen, a recog
nized drug expert at UCLA's
Neuropsychiatric Institute,
said at least four medical
studies support marijuana's
value in treating chemotherapy
patients, "but according to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administ
ration, that's still not proof. If it
were a drug firm trying to get
approval for a new drug they'd
have to do a hell of a lot more
work."
Cohen said marijuana itself
has no known adverse side ef
fects from the small doses used
for chemotherapy treatment
although "some people don't

appreciate what the young
people called 'feeling
stoned.' "
He noted the drug's long and
often-exaggerated reputation
"among many older people —
sometimes they're just hor
rified at the thought of using
marijuana."
He said marijuana should fol
low the same federal approval
process required of other
medicinal drugs rather than
pass through the current rash
of state-by-state legislation be
cause "I hate to see medicinal
decisions made by politi
cians."
Cohen said, "Everybody
knows marijuana may be good
for vomiting, but it may not be

all that much better than Com
pazine (a standard treatment
for chemotherapy effects)."
A major research project at
UCLA Medical School is trying
to answer that question. Dr. J.
Thomas Ungerleider said his
research is comparing the ef
fectiveness of Compazine with
marijuana for about 250
chemotherapy patients.
Most opposition to its use,
i.e said, is the "moral prohibi
tion" and the result is that
cancer patients often become
criminals by purchasing illicit
marijuana of unknown quality.
"That's a social policy . . .
but my God, these are cancer
patients and most of them are
dying."

UCLA Medical School is trying
to answer that question. Dr. J.
Thomas Ungerleider said his
research is comparing the ef
fectiveness of Compazine with
marijuana for about 250
chemotherapy patients.
Most opposition to its use,
i.e said, is the "moral prohibi
tion" and the result is that
cancer patients often become
criminals by purchasing illicit
marijuana of unknown quality.
"That's a social policy . . .
but my God, these are cancer
patients and most of them are
dying."
Los Angeles (AP) — The pres
ident of the American Cancer
Society (ACS) says marijuana
seems to relieve the cruel side
effects of some cancer
therapies and doctors should
be able to use the controversial
drug as a last resort.
"The physician who is treat
ing patients with cancer . . .
should have everything at his
disposal and be able to use it if
it will help," Dr. LaSalle Leffall
said in an interview this week.
"The evidence does support
the fact that it (marijuana) can
help the patient."
That conclusion is supported
by a growing body of scientific
research and a long history of
informal — and illegal — use of
the drug by many cancer pa
tients undergoing
chemotherapy.
"The role of the physician is
to cure whenever possible. But
if you can't cure, the least you
should be able to do is give the

patient some relief from his
pain and suffering," said Lef
fall, chairman of the surgery
department at Howard Univer
sity Medical School in
Washington, D.C. He was in
Los Angeles for this week's
ACS-sponsored cancer con
ference.
The federal government still
classifies marijuana, along with
heroin, LSD and other drugs,
as a Schedule I substance: No
medical value and high poten
tial for abuse.
The Cancer Society's official
position, adopted last year,
says only that marijuana has
promise and warrants more
"controlled clinical trials," a
spokesman said.
But since 1978, at least a
half-dozen legislatures have
passed state laws allowing doc
tors to prescribe marijuana for
some chemotherapy patients.
Such programs usually are de
scribed officially as research

and require case-by-case re
view by a medical board. Simi
lar measures are generating
controversy in other states.
Leffall said neither he nor the
society would become in
volved in legislative debates,
although such state action "is
not totally inappropriate."
Marijuana is being discus
sed, not as a treatment of
cancer, but as a way to relieve
the sometimes-devastating
side effects of potent anti
cancer drugs.
Letall said the side effects
often include severe nausea,
vomiting and loss of appetite.
"More and more we hear pa
tients say, 'I'm not going to
take this chemotherapy be
cause I hear the treatment is
worse than the disease,' " he
said. That fear can mean ac
cepting almost inevitable
death or turning to unproven
and often useless treatments.
Several approved drugs are

used to combat the side-effects
but, Leffall said, "if it seems
that other forms of treatment
are not effective, then the use
of marijuana under a physi
cian's care does seem war
ranted. I would be in favor of
using it."
In New Mexico, first of the
states to approve marijuana
therapy laws, the program's
administrator said, "I'd say we
have a resounding success on
our hands. We have people
who, for the first time, are not
only not experiencing nausea
and vomiting, but they've been
eating a full meal" after the
chemotherapy treatments.
Dr. Edward Deaux said 12 pa
tients are now in the program,
which will ultimately total
perhaps 150 people. ,
New Mexico gets its
marijuana cigarettes from a
five-acre plot cultivated for the
federal government in Missis
sippi. Deaux said the program

also uses a synthetic version of
marijuana's active ingredient,
called THC.
Dr. Sidney Cohen, a recog
nized drug expert at UCLA's
Neuropsychiatric Institute,
said at least four medical
studies support marijuana's
value in treating chemotherapy
patients, "but according to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administ
ration, that's still not proof. If it
were a drug firm trying to get
approval for a new drug they'd
have to do a hell of a lot more
work."
Cohen said marijuana itself
has no known adverse side ef
fects from the small doses used
for chemotherapy treatment
although "some people don't

appreciate what the young
people called 'feeling
stoned.' "
He noted the drug's long and
often-exaggerated reputation
"among many older people —
sometimes they're just hor
rified at the thought of using
marijuana."
He said marijuana should fol
low the same federal approval
process required of other
medicinal drugs rather than
pass through the current rash
of state-by-state legislation be
cause "I hate to see medicinal
decisions made by politi
cians."
Cohen said, "Everybody
knows marijuana may be good
for vomiting, but it may not be

all that much better than Com
pazine (a standard treatment
for chemotherapy effects)."
