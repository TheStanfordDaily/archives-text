## Beautiful location for a very enjoyable evening

THE CASTAWAYS
Coyote Point
San Mateo
347-1027
Ask for a quiet table for two
by the big picture windows and
settle back to enjoy a pleasant
evening at the Castaways in
Mateo. Set in a spectacular
location on Point Coyote over
looking the Bay, the restaurant
blends gracefully into the tall
trees which surround it.
About 20 minutes from the
University, north on 101, the
Castaways is a good choice for
a special evening. The exten
sive Polynesian drink menu is a
clue to the original theme of
the restaurant when it opened
in J964. According to assistant
manager Ed Taylor, only a few
items are left on what was
once an almost exclusive
Polynesian menu. "I like to call
our theme California antique,"
he added.
The featured drink, a Pas
sionate Virgin ($4.50) is served
in a whole pineapple which has
been hollowed out and refilled
with a blend of rums and fruit
juices. Sipping your drinks,
you can watch the lights of the
City across the Bay and the jet
liners taking off from San Fran
cisco International Airport.
Consisting of cauliflower, car
rots and celery, a raw vegetable
tray starts out the meal. Choos
ing from the "taste tempters,"
the deep-fried mushrooms in
sweet and sour sauce was an

interesting if not inspiring
dish. Mushrooms dipped in
batter and deep-fried were
served with a tomato-based
sweet-and-sour sauce. An in
teresting texture but rather
bland in taste.
A choice of soup or salad,
baked potato, noodles or rice
is offered with the entree.
Soups are a choice between
clam chowder or beer and
cheese soup while salads are
tossed greens or spinach with
hot bacon dressing.
Basic steak entrees comprise
one side of the menu, offering
selections such as steak and
lobster ($14.25). Seafood and
poultry dishes make up the rest
of the menu. Mahi Mahi
($6.50), Fresh Petrale Sole
($7.25), Shrimp in Sauterne
($7.95) are just a few of the fish
dishes. Breast of chicken Kona
Kai, sauteed in plum sauce and
topped with toasted coconut is
one example of the Polynesian
influence.
Fresh spinach topped with
mushrooms and grated cheese
and hot bacon dressing was a
good choice from the soup and
salads offered. A fresh, round
loaf of brown bread and butter
was served with the salad. Al
though a little tough to cut
through the thick crust, the
bread was fresh and warm.
Java Seafood Curry ($7.80)
was a tasty, spicy dish of
shrimp, scallops, crab and
white fish served with raisins,

Spanish peanuts and chutney
on the side. The distinctive
dish was accompanied by a
boring rice pilaf. Filet of sole
Oscar ($8.75) was good but the
two asparagus spears and the
strip of crab meat covered in
white sauce did not really add
anything special to the basic
sole.
Black Bottom pie ($1.25) was
a tastier dessert than the
cheesecake selection ($1.25). A
good cup of coffee topped off a
pleasant dinner at the Casta
ways.
With a seating capacity of
240, the Castaways does a good
job in providing a meal well
worth the price. Owned by
Specialty Restaurants, a coast
to-coast chain of individual re
staurants, the dinner lacked
that special touch to make it
truly unique or memorable.
Service was good if a bit slow,
and the dishes sampled were
well-prepared but not spec
tacular.
The strongest recommenda
tion for the Castaways is its
tremendous location. Vou
have to watch carefully for the
Coyote Point signs once off the
freeway but it is definitely
worth the effort. If you're look
ing for a beautiful spot for a
good and reasonable meal on a
special evening out, the Cas
taways merits serious consid
eration.

With a seating capacity of
240, the Castaways does a good
job in providing a meal well
worth the price. Owned by
Specialty Restaurants, a coast
to-coast chain of individual re
staurants, the dinner lacked
that special touch to make it
truly unique or memorable.
Service was good if a bit slow,
and the dishes sampled were
well-prepared but not spec
tacular.
The strongest recommenda
tion for the Castaways is its
tremendous location. Vou
have to watch carefully for the
Coyote Point signs once off the
freeway but it is definitely
worth the effort. If you're look
ing for a beautiful spot for a
good and reasonable meal on a
special evening out, the Cas
taways merits serious consid

THE CASTAWAYS
Coyote Point
San Mateo
347-1027
Ask for a quiet table for two
by the big picture windows and
settle back to enjoy a pleasant
evening at the Castaways in
Mateo. Set in a spectacular
location on Point Coyote over
looking the Bay, the restaurant
blends gracefully into the tall
trees which surround it.
About 20 minutes from the
University, north on 101, the
Castaways is a good choice for
a special evening. The exten
sive Polynesian drink menu is a
clue to the original theme of
the restaurant when it opened
in J964. According to assistant
manager Ed Taylor, only a few
items are left on what was
once an almost exclusive
Polynesian menu. "I like to call
our theme California antique,"
he added.
The featured drink, a Pas
sionate Virgin ($4.50) is served
in a whole pineapple which has
been hollowed out and refilled
with a blend of rums and fruit
juices. Sipping your drinks,
you can watch the lights of the
City across the Bay and the jet
liners taking off from San Fran
cisco International Airport.
Consisting of cauliflower, car
rots and celery, a raw vegetable
tray starts out the meal. Choos
ing from the "taste tempters,"
the deep-fried mushrooms in
sweet and sour sauce was an

interesting if not inspiring
dish. Mushrooms dipped in
batter and deep-fried were
served with a tomato-based
sweet-and-sour sauce. An in
teresting texture but rather
bland in taste.
A choice of soup or salad,
baked potato, noodles or rice
is offered with the entree.
Soups are a choice between
clam chowder or beer and
cheese soup while salads are
tossed greens or spinach with
hot bacon dressing.
Basic steak entrees comprise
one side of the menu, offering
selections such as steak and
lobster ($14.25). Seafood and
poultry dishes make up the rest
of the menu. Mahi Mahi
($6.50), Fresh Petrale Sole
($7.25), Shrimp in Sauterne
($7.95) are just a few of the fish
dishes. Breast of chicken Kona
Kai, sauteed in plum sauce and
topped with toasted coconut is
one example of the Polynesian
influence.
Fresh spinach topped with
mushrooms and grated cheese
and hot bacon dressing was a
good choice from the soup and
salads offered. A fresh, round
loaf of brown bread and butter
was served with the salad. Al
though a little tough to cut
through the thick crust, the
bread was fresh and warm.
Java Seafood Curry ($7.80)
was a tasty, spicy dish of
shrimp, scallops, crab and
white fish served with raisins,

Spanish peanuts and chutney
on the side. The distinctive
dish was accompanied by a
boring rice pilaf. Filet of sole
Oscar ($8.75) was good but the
two asparagus spears and the
strip of crab meat covered in
white sauce did not really add
anything special to the basic
sole.
Black Bottom pie ($1.25) was
a tastier dessert than the
cheesecake selection ($1.25). A
good cup of coffee topped off a
pleasant dinner at the Casta
ways.
With a seating capacity of
240, the Castaways does a good
job in providing a meal well
worth the price. Owned by
Specialty Restaurants, a coast
to-coast chain of individual re
staurants, the dinner lacked
that special touch to make it
