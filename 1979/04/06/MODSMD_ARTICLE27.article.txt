EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.

928-2279
At last there is a restaurant in the Bay Area
that offers the fine Mediterranean food of
southern Europe. I had given up on trying to
locate a restaurant with good Creek food
here some time ago. It has been up to the
Sicilians with the successful Caffe Sport and,
lately, the Spanish with El Meson to represent
the greatness of the much-maligned cuisine
of the Mediterranean.
El Meson ("The Inn") is a restaurant near
Chirardelli Square. Casual, tending to bois
terous, medium-priced, and a lot of fun. The
Spanish waiters have thick accents; they rush
around the restaurant and in their speed al
most throw your dishes of food on the table.
At first this may be disconcerting, but it is all
in the spirit of the inn. The walls are
whitewashed and lined with art. Dark
wooden beams and tile floor complete the
decor. Tables are scrunched together and al
though at times it seems claustrophobic, it
does contribute to the convivial atmosphere.
Flamenco music creeps into the background
hum of chatter, of the waiters' bustling
throughout the restaurant and of the bottles
of wine being uncorked.
Tapas are the appetizers or meze that the
Spanish eat before, throughout or even in
stead of their main course. El Meson's ap
petizers are extensive and, compared to ev
erything sampled, clearly were the best items
on the menu. Callos a la Madrilena (Tripe
Madrid style $2.50), Fabadana Asturiana (cas
seroleof white beans, ham, chorizoand pork
$2.75) and Chorizo Salteado (sauteed chorizo
$2.50) are three of the rarer items in the ap
petizer category. Calamares Rebozados
(breaded baby squid with lemon) is a best
buy at $2.50. A huge plate of the squid would
have been more than enough for a main
course. And they were excellent.
Outstanding as well were the Gambas <a la
Plancha (prawns grilled on the shell) and the
Gambas al Ajillo (prawns sauteed with garlic
and wine) both of which cost $3.75, and
which were some of the finest prawns that I
can remember having eaten.
El Meson offers three soups: soup of the
day, Crema Escorial (seafood bisque with
sherry $2) and a Gazpacho, a thin and fully
pureed version of the classic Spanish soup,

unfortunately with so much vinegar that it
made it unpleasant to eat.
The house salad — Ensalada Espanola — a
mixture of onion, tomatoes, lettuce, with an
oil and vinegar dressing, is superb.
In keeping with the cuisine of Spain and
also of the Mediterranean, El Meson's menu
is biased towards seafood. Except for the
lobster and paella dishes, both of which serve
two persons, all the seafood entrees are
priced between $6.25 and $8.50. These are
reasonable prices, especially when one con
siders that or salad, rice and vegetables
are included in the meal. Moreover, I cannot
stress enough the size of the portions. If the
appetizers were enough for a main course,
then perhaps the single entrees are enough
for two people. One of the house specialties,
Paella Marinera ($16.50 for two), a huge and
colorful saffron rice paella with assorted sea
food, shellfish and vegetables, was more
than enough for three persons. The paella,
however, along with the gazpacho, were the
weak links in the meal at El Meson. The paella
was rather characterless and the scallops and
squid tough and unenjoyable. My best advice
would be to avoid this dish and opt instead
for the Paella Valenciana, a paella with chic
ken, pork, chorizo shellfish and seafood.
Other sure bets are two of the chef's spe
cials: The Filete de Pargo a la Batelera (red
snapper $6.75) and the Zarzuela Costa Brava
(assorted seafood and shellfish in a "magnifi
cent'' sauce). Two other dishes demonstrate
the eclecticism of a Spanish menu that draws
from all the regions of Spain: Ostras El Meson
(oysters in the house sauce) and the Basque
dish Merluza a la Vasca ($7.50).
Of the ten chicken and meat entrees, the
Cordero a la Manchega (marinated and gril
led lamb $8.25) is outstanding. Served with
wedges of lemon, rice and vegetables, this
dish would be a "must" in any restaurant.
El Meson is a fine restaurant that serves
unpretentious food in an unpretentious set
ting. My guess is that it would be a terrific
place to dine in a large group — to gab and
pass around the tapas, to keep the wines
(from the extensive Spanish winelist) flow
ing, and to pay reasonable amounts of money
for a great amount of quality food.
And to end your meal, you can choose
between the classic flan, the Budin de Pan
(bread pudding) or the Naiillas (special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
