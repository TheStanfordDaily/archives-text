# 'Tofu goes Wesf' – a book for the curds
## 
### 
My mother has 150 cook
books, but I wouldn't make
Tofu Goes West part of her col
lection. Tofu proves once
again that anything will be pub
lished if it follows fashions and
fads closely enough. Don't
spend your $5 plus tax on this
one.
No more classic French
cookbooks. No American
heritage cooking, no far-away,
exotic recipes orethnic variety.
There is no joy in cooking. )ust
tofu: Tofu Tamale Pie, Tofu
Nut Loaf, Tofu Zabaglione,
Chile con Tofu, even Tofu ala
King. First it was hot-tubs. Now
it's tofu. Welcome to Califor
nia.
Tofu is the curd made from
soybeans and soy milk, and is
often solidified with a chemical
compound. One of the great
protein staples of the Orient, it
is often used with vegetables.
It is not that tofu is without
merit. Tofu is an ideal food for
vegetarians, weight-watchers
and people concerned about
what they eat. It is a great sub
stitute for cholesterol-ridden
recipes.
Tofu has a wide variety of re
cipes that incorporate the fam
ous bean curd, but the recipes
are strained. Tofu itself is not
available in all supermarkets. It
is unlikely that the average
home or even off-campus stu
dent pad will find this book
either interesting, useful or
necessary.
No doubt there will be many
intrigued with the idea of Tofu
Crepes, Tofu Yam Pie and Tofu
Mellow Pudding. Thrills, kids,
but I prefer my tofu in my Hot
and Sour Soup.
