Claude Lelouch tries to do too
much too quickly in this over
loaded and overblown murder
mystery. The Michele Morgan-
Serge Reggiani pairing works
well enough, but Lelouch can't
leave it alone. He's always trying
to extend his takes to their
maximum possible length, and
his shots of high speed driving
from a subjective viewpoint are
particularly irritating. By the time
you're done with Lelouch's
empty thrills, you may want to go
back to the functional mystery
plot, or else you will get tired of
getting pushed around and leave
the theater.

Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
While sporadically very funny,
Tom tones now seems dated by
its self-consciously clever style.
The film mixes cutesy optical
techniques — a surfeit of
television-style trick wipes and
swish pans — with a chronic con
fusion about whether it is laugh
ing with its characters or at them.
The movie's unconventional nar
rative technique must have been
startling in the early '60s; today
it's at best ignorable and at worst
downright irritating. Tony
Richardson directed; Albert Fin

Watership Down #
New Varsity
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the

Animal House ★ jrft
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is a slightly crazed, gener

movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst

whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.

One of the best comedies ever

around, Allen loses his freakish

The Buddy Holly Story it * #

Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the

Boulevard Nights *
Serramonte 6
From its Muzak-Salsa sound
track to its love story fought out
in the midst of gang warfare, this
movie fails to be convincing. It
has two or three things going for
it: some attractive night photo
graphy (which, however, makes
Los Angeles low-riding look little
different from American Graffiti's
midwest cruisin') and a couple of
interesting performances. These
can't make up for the plot, which
is botched even by standards of
melodrama. This may be the first
movie to make gang warfare un

Fantastic Planet * * *

Rene Laloux directed this
nicely drawn feature cartoon.
Fantastic Planet deals with a fu

The China Syndrome it it it *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political • commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
—R.L.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

The Deer Hunter -kick
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwiters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made—
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.

Norma Rae * ★ * *
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.

Midnight Express
Palo Alto Square
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop-out imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. The movie self
righteously bills itself as retelling
a true story; if this is so then why
did the screenwriters choose to
fabricate violent episodes — a
man having his tongue bitten off
in looming close-up, a Turkish
guard (there are no good Turks in
this movie) being impaled on a
coat hook — which never hap
pened to the real Mr. Hayes? If
you should hear Midnight Ex
press' whistle a'blowing, take the
bus instead.

Cef Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Cet Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.
Days of Heaven * * * ★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.

well enough, but Lelouch can't
leave it alone. He's always trying
to extend his takes to their
maximum possible length, and
his shots of high speed driving
from a subjective viewpoint are
particularly irritating. By the time
you're done with Lelouch's
empty thrills, you may want to go
back to the functional mystery
plot, or else you will get tired of
getting pushed around and leave
the theater.

Tom lones * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
While sporadically very funny,
Tom tones now seems dated by
its self-consciously clever style.
The film mixes cutesy optical
techniques — a surfeit of
television-style trick wipes and
swish pans — with a chronic con
fusion about whether it is laugh
ing with its characters or at them.
The movie's unconventional nar
rative technique must have been
startling in the early '60s; today
it's at best ignorable and at worst
downright irritating. Tony
Richardson directed; Albert Fin
ney has the title role.

Buck Rogers in the 25th Century
*Vr
Guild, Menlo Park
This movie is so bad that it
makes Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians look like Citizen Kane. It
features yecchv acting, wretched
dialogue, putrid sets, and abys
mal Buck Ro
gers was made for TV and then
distributed for theatrical use after
the producers found out how
much money Hattlestar Calactica
was making in its Canadian theat
rical run. This explains the film's
rating: "M" for mindless.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Theatre, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.

Watership Down #
New Varsity
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the
ater feeling as if you've slept all
night with your mouth open.
—J.M.
Animal House ★ jrft
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is a slightly crazed, gener
ally sophomoric and mindless
movie which serves as one big
glorification of white male fan
tasies. And because of this, this
story concerning various forms
of frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
—R.L.

Annie Hall * * ★ ★
Sunday, Mem Aud
One of the best comedies ever
made. Woody Allen's personal
masterpiece has no weak mo
ments; it's his most consistently
effective film. Allen and his co
star, Diane Keaton, are wonder
ful together. When Keaton's
around, Allen loses his freakish
ness and becomes, if still not
normal, then a very special
human being. The film netted last
year's Academy Award for best
picture (a victory of humanity
over the technology of Star
Wars), garnered Allen the awards
for best director and best
screenplay, and pronounced
Keaton best actress. A magnifi
cent film.

The Buddy Holly Story it * #
Palo Alto Square
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hdoey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.

Boulevard Nights *
Serramonte 6
From its Muzak-Salsa sound
track to its love story fought out
in the midst of gang warfare, this
movie fails to be convincing. It
has two or three things going for
it: some attractive night photo
graphy (which, however, makes
Los Angeles low-riding look little
different from American Graffiti's
midwest cruisin') and a couple of
interesting performances. These
can't make up for the plot, which
is botched even by standards of
melodrama. This may be the first
movie to make gang warfare un
attractive by making it seem like a
bo re.
-J.M.

Fantastic Planet * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rene Laloux directed this
nicely drawn feature cartoon.
Fantastic Planet deals with a fu
ture society where men are kept
as pets of the children of giants.
The allegory never gets too heavy
and Laloux keeps his animated
action moving swiftly. This ani
mated fare, while suitable for
children, is probably best ap
preciated by adults.
—J.M.
The China Syndrome it it it *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political • commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
—R.L.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

The Deer Hunter -kick
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwiters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made—
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.

Norma Rae * ★ * *
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.

Midnight Express
Palo Alto Square
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop-out imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. The movie self
righteously bills itself as retelling
a true story; if this is so then why
did the screenwriters choose to
fabricate violent episodes — a
man having his tongue bitten off
in looming close-up, a Turkish
guard (there are no good Turks in
this movie) being impaled on a
coat hook — which never hap
pened to the real Mr. Hayes? If
you should hear Midnight Ex
press' whistle a'blowing, take the
bus instead.

Cef Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Cet Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.
Days of Heaven * * * ★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Terence Malick directed this
almost hypnotically beautiful
examination of the way four main
characters react to their envi
ronment and to each other. The
setting is the Texas Panhandle;
the time is 1916, and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to
be made up of wheat fields and
sky; Malick makes his characters
seem both mythic and insignific
ant in their magnificent sur
roundings. Brooke Adams, the
heroine of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, gives a fine perfor
mance as the refugee from the
slums of Chicago who finds her
self in a radically different world.
