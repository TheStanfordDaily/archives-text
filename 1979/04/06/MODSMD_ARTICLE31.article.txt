# Men munch Bears, women whip Spartans
## SPORTS 
### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's men's tennis team
re-established its claim as the
top team in Northern Califor
nia by defeating California
Wednesday, 7-2.
Cal had earlier unseated the
Cardinals as the Northern
California Intercollegiate
Champions when they out
pointed Stanford in February.
The win broke a nine-year
winning streak for the Cards
and gave the Bears hope that
this would be the vear that they
turned the tables on Stanford.
However, this chance may
have put extra pressure on the
Bears and may have cost them
Wednesday's match.
"The whole Cal team was

very nervous," noted Peter
Rennert, Stanford's top player.
"I think they might have been
overly psyched."
Jim IHodges, who played No.
6 singles, concurred. "Their
whole team looked nervous.
|im Harper started off our
match with a double-fault. He
got a slow start and I never re
ally let him in the match."
Hodges, who didn't find out
he was playing until 20 minutes
before the match when Scott
Bondurant pulled out with a
sore shoulder, took care of
Harper 6-1, 6-3. In typical
Hodges form, he completely
dominated the match and
spent just 40 minutes in doing
so.

However, Stanford's win
cannot be attributed solely to
Cal's nervousness. The Cards
had a fresh mental attitude, as
witnessed by co-captain |ohn
Rast.
"In the SMU match I noticed
a lot of heads down," said Rast.
"Yesterday everybody looked
different. I think now every
body realizes we have a shot at
winning the whole thing. Butat
the same time I think we all
realize we're all going to have
to play well to do it."
Rast made a successful re
turn to the lineup yesterday,
defeating Yair Wertheimer fa- J,
J-6, 6-2. It was Rast's first com
petitive match in seven
months, as he has been
sidelined with a bad back.
"I was really pleased to see
|ohn win," said Stanford coach
Dick Gould. "Wertheimer is a
good player; he beat Larry
Gottfried earlier this year."
Rast was also pleased with
his performance. "I felt I
played pretty well considering
it was my first match of the
year," he commented. "I'm
not very competitive at this
point; it's very hard for me to
sustain concentration. I missed
a lot of easy shots I couldn't
believe I missed. I really
needed a tournament to
toughen up mentally, but after
a couple of matches I think I'll
be sharp."
Rennert felt that just having
Rast in the lineup might have
been the lift the team needed.
"I think we might have felt
we were just a bit weak," said
Rennert. "But when we put

Rast in the lineup, a guy who
could play No. 1, 2 or 3, I think
it makes us that much stronger
and because of that we all felt
more confident. I'm happy to
see him back in the lineup."
Rennert gained revenge
when he beat Larry Stefanki
6-4, 6-7, 6-3. Stefanki elimi
nated Rennert in the quarter
finals of the Nor-Cal Intercol
legiates in February en route to
the title.
"I think the difference today
was that I was able to serve
wide to his backhand and, on
the big points, come down the
middle," pointed out Rennert.
"I didn't play that great, al
though I started well, but now
I'm confident I can win
matches at No. 1, a feeling I
didn't have before."
Gould was impressed with
the ability of his team to win
the close matches.
"All the matches today were
close," he said. "In some we
played well, but so did they. In
others we didn't play that well,
but neither did they. We could
have just as well been behind
5-1 after the singles instead of
up 5-1. I was very impressed
with our mental toughness.
That's how we're going to have
to play all our matches if we're
going to win it."
The Cards battle the Sun De
vils from Arizona State today
and Arizona tomorrow. ASU,
ranked 12th in the nation, fea
tures Mike Waldman, who has
scored wins over Andy
Kohlberg (the No. 1-ranked
college player) and UCLA's
Fritz Buehning.

The win broke a nine-year
winning streak for the Cards
and gave the Bears hope that
this would be the vear that they
turned the tables on Stanford.
However, this chance may
have put extra pressure on the
Bears and may have cost them
Wednesday's match.
"The whole Cal team was

very nervous," noted Peter
Rennert, Stanford's top player.
"I think they might have been
overly psyched."
Jim IHodges, who played No.
6 singles, concurred. "Their
whole team looked nervous.
|im Harper started off our
match with a double-fault. He
got a slow start and I never re
ally let him in the match."
Hodges, who didn't find out
he was playing until 20 minutes
before the match when Scott
Bondurant pulled out with a
sore shoulder, took care of
Harper 6-1, 6-3. In typical
Hodges form, he completely
dominated the match and
spent just 40 minutes in doing
so.

However, Stanford's win
cannot be attributed solely to
Cal's nervousness. The Cards
had a fresh mental attitude, as
witnessed by co-captain |ohn
Rast.
"In the SMU match I noticed
a lot of heads down," said Rast.
"Yesterday everybody looked
different. I think now every
body realizes we have a shot at
winning the whole thing. Butat
the same time I think we all
realize we're all going to have
to play well to do it."
Rast made a successful re
turn to the lineup yesterday,
defeating Yair Wertheimer fa- J,
J-6, 6-2. It was Rast's first com
petitive match in seven
months, as he has been
sidelined with a bad back.
"I was really pleased to see
|ohn win," said Stanford coach
Dick Gould. "Wertheimer is a
good player; he beat Larry
Gottfried earlier this year."
Rast was also pleased with
his performance. "I felt I
played pretty well considering
it was my first match of the
year," he commented. "I'm
not very competitive at this
point; it's very hard for me to
sustain concentration. I missed
a lot of easy shots I couldn't
believe I missed. I really
needed a tournament to
toughen up mentally, but after
a couple of matches I think I'll
be sharp."
Rennert felt that just having
Rast in the lineup might have
been the lift the team needed.
"I think we might have felt
we were just a bit weak," said
Rennert. "But when we put

Rast in the lineup, a guy who
could play No. 1, 2 or 3, I think
it makes us that much stronger
and because of that we all felt
more confident. I'm happy to
see him back in the lineup."
Rennert gained revenge
when he beat Larry Stefanki
6-4, 6-7, 6-3. Stefanki elimi
nated Rennert in the quarter
finals of the Nor-Cal Intercol
legiates in February en route to
the title.
"I think the difference today
was that I was able to serve
wide to his backhand and, on
the big points, come down the
middle," pointed out Rennert.
"I didn't play that great, al
though I started well, but now
I'm confident I can win
matches at No. 1, a feeling I
didn't have before."
Gould was impressed with
the ability of his team to win
the close matches.
"All the matches today were
close," he said. "In some we
played well, but so did they. In
others we didn't play that well,
but neither did they. We could
have just as well been behind
5-1 after the singles instead of
up 5-1. I was very impressed
with our mental toughness.
That's how we're going to have
to play all our matches if we're
going to win it."
