Cardinal women's coach
Anne Gould was pleased with
the performance of her team.
The match was a tune-up for
many of the top Cardinal

players, but it was also a
chance for players like
freshman Andrea Markl to get
some competitive experience.

recently joined the team, this
was her first match play.

pose a formidable obstacle to
the continuation of the Cards'
undefeated season. The Bruins
boast a strong and deep squad,
while USC's awesome lineup
of such top players as Barbara
Hallquist and Stacy Margolin
often leaves opponents point
less.
Gould said that her team was
looking forward to the chal
lenge. "We're really excited
about this weekend. UCLA and
USC are both excellent and
well-coached teams. We're de
finitely going to have to play
our very best to win."

Stanford's top seven players
face UCLA at 2 p.m. today, and
then go cross-town .to meet
USC at 11 a.m. tomorrow.
Competing for the Cardinals

the importance of these up
coming matches to the Cardi
nal hopes: "These matches are
early in the season. But for us
they're most important learn
