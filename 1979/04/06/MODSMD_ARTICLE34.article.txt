# Spring football begins
## 
### 
Most college athletes devote
a year-round commitment to
their sport, and Stanford's
football players are-no excep
tion. The Cardinals begin
spring practice with a 9 a.m.
workout tomorrow and will
continue for five weeks, prac
ticing Monday, Wednesday
and Friday afternoons at 3 and
Saturday mornings at 9.
Coach Rod Dowhower will
get a good look at everyone,
but figures to concentrate
primarily on Turk Schonert and
the quarterback spot. The
fifth-year senior completed
four of nine passes for four
yards and two touchdowns last
year.
"Our biggest priority will be
to develop Schonert," said
Dowhower. "Turk is inexperi
enced, but we feel hewill bean
excellent college quarterback.
He provides savvy leadership,
he throws the ball well, and
he's a fine runner. His coaches
and teammates have confi
dence in his ability to execute a
complex offense where the
quarterback is the focal point."

Another spot that
Dowhower will give attention
to is inside linebacker, where
two-year letterman Bo Boxold
replaces Steve Budinger, who
was injured nearly two months
ago in a head-on automobile
collision and will miss the 1979
season.
Sophomore Craig Zellmer,
who turned in an impressive
19-tackle performance against
USC in place of Cordy Cere
sino, now takes over Cere
si no's spot permanently. Back
ing up /ellmer is Dave Morze,
who was the most highly
recruited player in Northern
California last year at St. Fran
cis High School.
Besides the losses of
Budinger to injury and Cere
sino to graduation, the Cards
will also be without the ser
vices of safety Robby Chap
man, the team's pass intercep
tion leader and No. 2 tackier
last season.
Chapman plans to enroll in
Cal State Los Angeles this
summer for two semesters of
academic work before return

ing to Stanford in the spring of
1980. He will be eligible forthe
1980 football season.
Without Chapman, Rick
Parker and Steve Foley are left
as the secondary's two return
ing starters. Rick Cervais, Rod
ney Cilmore and Keith Bur
cham should contend for the
two open spots.
On offense, the Cards' two
biggest weapons, halfback
Darrin Nelson and split end
Ken Margerum, will miss
spring practice.
Nelson, of course, under
went surgery last Sunday for a
torn left hamstring tendon suf
fered last week at the
Stanford-UCLA track meet,
and Margerum is still compet
ing for the track team as a hur
dler and sprinter.
Stalwart offensive returnees
include fullback Jim Brown,
who gained 209 yards in the
final two 1978 games; flankers
Cordon Banks and Andre
Tyler, tight end Pat Bowe and
center John Macaulay.
