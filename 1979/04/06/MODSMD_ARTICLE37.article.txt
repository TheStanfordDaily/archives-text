The Stanford Crew opens its 1979 racing season tomorrow in
San Diego and Eureka. The men's varsity 8 will race in the annual
San Diego Crew Classic, the only regatta on the West Coast which
Eastern rowing powers such as Harvard, Penn, Navy and Cornell
attend.
Stanford's men will line up at 12:15 p.m. on Mission Bay with
USC, Long Beach State, Loyola, San Diego State and California
Maritime Academy to race for the regatta's California Cup.
The remainder of Stanford's squad, a men's JV 8, freshman 8
and novice 8, and a women's 8 and 4, will race in Eureka at the
home course of Humboldt State. Oregon and Oregon Tech will
also be bringing their teams to Eureka.
In the annual interclass race held last Thursday at the Redwood
City Harbor, the freshman crew opened its racing season with an
impressive victory over the sophomore, junior and senior boats.
The victory was the first a frosh boat has notched since 1961.
The crew rowed exceptionally well together, despite having
only three oarsmen with previous experience. Starting at a brisk
35 strokes per minute, the eight-oared shell pulled away from the
sophomore and junior boats and had open water over the two by
the first 600 meters.
The seniors sprinted early in the final 500, but the trosh 8
responded with its own sprint and pulled away to a two-length
victory over the upperclassmen, crossing the line at 6:16, eight
seconds ahead of the senior boat. The race capped a week of
intensive training, during which both the men's and women's
crews stayed at Stanford. Workouts were held on the water twice
daily and were supplemented with land training.
