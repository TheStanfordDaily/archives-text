# Booters corral Colorado, 5-1

Although it probably won't
become a standard prescrip
tion of athletic trainers, a road
trip to Hawaii over the break
proved beneficial for the wo
men's soccer team as it beat
Colorado College 5-1 Wed
nesday afternoon at Roble
Field.
The squad still has a ways to
go before reaching the polish
of last year's team, but the Car
dinals played more effectively
against Colorado than they did
in their previous pair of local
matches with the University of
Northern Colorado and Santa
Cruz.
A part of the reason tor the
Cards' stronger showing Wed
nesday was the return of Kris
McGarrey Irom Tours. As a
freshman last year, McGarrey
was the club's scoring leader,
and she wasted little time in
making her presence felt
against Colorado by putting in
the first Card goal with only
i:5O tic ked down on the game
clock.
However, it was two-time
all-league selection Ellen Griep
who provided most of the Stan
lord firepower.
Griep put Stanford ahead 2-0
1 ( minutes into the game.
lust when the game ap
peared to be a runaway, CC's
judy Sondermann countered a
minute and a half later. Griep

then earned a hat trick by tally
ing twice within 10 seconds just
before the first half ended.
Theresa Bertsch scored the
tinal Stanford goal of the match
after 16:27 had elapsed in the
second half.
Assistant coach Tom Miller
noted that there were "long
periods where they just did ev
erything — a lot of good hustl
ing on the front line, especially
from lulie Zender."
Besides McCarrey's addition
to the team, rookie all-league
pick Sue Handel is another im
portant returnee for the Cards.
Handel came back to her mid
field position after studying at
Cliveden.
While competing in the
Rainbow Invitational Tourna
ment in Honolulu, the team
split four games. Stanford lost
to Leahi 2-1 and He Pua Pa'ani
1-0 before turning things
around to beat kuhina Nui 2-1
and Na Alapa 4-1.
Despite a whirlwind agenda
which pitted them against Uni
versity of North Carolina dur
ing finals and right before their
flight to Honolulu, the Cards
are on the road again, headed
for the Westmont Tournament
in Santa Barbara. Following
that tourney, fans can
catch the globetrotting squad
when Cal State-Hayward visits
Wednesday at 3: iO p.m. at
Roble Field.
