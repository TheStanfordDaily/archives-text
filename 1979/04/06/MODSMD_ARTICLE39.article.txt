# White departs for Netherlands
## 
### Julie Hill 
Even though the Stanford
women's field hockey team
completed its season last fall,
Nancy White has lengthened
her own season by several
months. She qualified last
Sunday to travel with the U.S.
field hockey team to the
Netherlands this weekend.
White has spent the last six
weeks flying back and torth
from Philadelphia, where the
team has been practicing, and
today she leaves for the
three-week European tour.
Wednesday the U.S. team will
face one of the teams from a
field that includes Scotland,
Wales, Ireland, Holland,
Czechoslovakia, Cermany,
Russia and England.
The tall, blond Human Biol
ogy major qualified last sum
mer to try out for the U.S.
team. A year ago, her team rep
resented the U.S. at Trinidad in
the West Indies.
Throughout this current
European tour, it is "really im
portant we do well," according
to White. The United States is
now seeded 11th in interna
tional competition and must
fare well to increase their
standing before the World
Championships held in Van
couver, B.C. The top five teams
in that tournament go to the
Olympics in 1980.

Concerning the United States'
chances to go to the '80 Olym
pics, White said, "We've im
proved so much that we should
have a good team. We're get
ting more organized, which is
exciting."
The two other Bay Area U.S.
team members are Sheryl
lohnson of Berkeley and
Onnie Killefer, who was Stan
ford's field hockey captain in
1977.
Even though White began
playing field hockey in eighth
grade and later in her Virginia
high school, she says she'll
probably be through with the
sport atter she graduates in
1980.
Since she has "always
dreamed of being in the Olym
pics," however, the "tempta
tion'' to play in the 1984 games
may keep her swinging a stick a
little while longer.
Right now, though, White is
"really excited" about the up
coming competition. She said
that the young team (only three
veterans) is a "neat group of
people," and she is looking
forward to playing with them
again.
White will be taking spring
quarter off, but will be return
ing in the fall as a senior for her
fourth consecutive year as a
Stanford scotcher.
