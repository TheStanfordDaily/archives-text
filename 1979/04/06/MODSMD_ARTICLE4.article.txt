# Windfall tax proposed
## Carter to remove price ceiling on U.S. crude oil 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter told the American
people last night "each one of you
will have to use less oil and pay more
for it" as he announced plans to
gradually lift ceilings on U.S. pro
duced crude oil by 1981.
Carter's plan is aimed at boosting
U.S. oil output and discouraging
consumption at the cost of more in
flation and higher gasoline prices.
Estimates of how much more
motorists will pay for gasoline over a
two year period under the Carter
proposal range from 5 cents to 15
cents a gallon.
Carter asked Congress for a
"windfall profits tax" that would
claim half the extra revenues oil
companies would get from higher
prices caused by decontrol or the
policies of the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries.
The decontrol portion of Carter's
new energy plan does not require
action by Congress. Officials say the
president will go ahead with it re
gardless of whether Congress ap
proves the windfall tax proposal.
Emphasizing in his Oval Office
speech that revenues from the tax
would go to poor families, mass
transit projects and efforts to de
velop new energy sources, Carter
sought to put lawmakers on the spot
by declaring:
"Every vote against it will be a vote
for excessive oil company profits and
for reliance on the whims of the
foreign oil cartel."
Carter said that even with the
windfall profits tax, oil company re
venues will still provide "plenty of
incentive" to increase production.
Carter said he will demand that the
oil industry use the extra income for

energy development "and not to buy
department stores and hotels as
some have done in the past."
Administration officials, briefing
reporters on condition that they not
be identified publicly, asserted that
the gradual oil decontrol proposal
will add 4 to 5 cents per gallon to the
price of gasoline and home heating
oil by September 1981.
Some other estimates have ranged
as high as 15 cents a gallon.
The implementation of oil price
decontrol will be designed to reduce

the inflationary impact in 1979, when
living costs are rising at an annual
rate in excess of 10 percent. The ad
ministration officials estimated that
decontrol would increase living costs
by just one-tenth of 1 percent this
year.
In 1980 and 1981, they said, the in
creases would amount to two-tenths
to three-tenths of 1 percent in each
of the two years.
Carter and his aides acknowledge
that the administration plan will hit
everv American in the pocketbook,

yet argue it is a necessary answer to
increased reliance on imported oil.
They also are braced, White House
sources said, for political fallout that
could carry over into the 1980 elec
tion year.
A number of congressional
sources express doubt that Carter's
proposed energy tax can be enacted.
However, the president is ex
pected to sweeten the pot by
suggesting the extra tax revenues he
wants from the oil companies be

earmarked for programs designed to
encourage production of gasohol —
a blend of unleaded gasoline and
grain alcohol — and the develop
ment of solar and other energy
sources, all of which have support in
Congress.
Carter also said an independent
presidential commission of experts is
being established to investigate the
Three Mile Island nuclear plant acci
dent and "make recommendations
on how we can improve the safety of
nuclear power plants."
