# Discrimination OK in some areas
## Faculty Senate backs research contracts discrimination plan 
### Tony Rupert 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
overwhelmingly approved a prop
osal from its Committee on Research
that would make citizenship dis
crimination in contracts between the
University and foreign governments
permissible in some instances.
Under the newly adopted mea
sure, a research contract involving
travel to a foreign country that re
stricts the entry of citizens of some

countries would be subjected to ad
ministrative review.
The Dean of Research would first
determine which contracts have a
"potentially significant discriminat
ory impact" on Stanford personnel;
that is, if some student-researchers
would be unable to participate be
cause the country won't admit stu
dents of their citizenship. The Dean
of Research would then ask an advis
ory panel of three faculty members

to consider whether the contract is in
the best interests of the University.
The advisory panel would not re
commend acceptance of the contract
unless the principal faculty member
involved in the research could show
that the contract is in the best in
terests of the University in light of the
following criteria:
— the probability and extent of
discrimination;
— how reasonable the discrimina
tion would be;
— the benefits the sponsoring
country would receive from the pro
ject;
— the benefits to the participating
faculty;
— the interests of the students in
being able to participate in all Uni
versity activities.
In other business, Provost Gerald
Lieberman reported that President
Richard Lyman had not yet made a
final decision but probably will ac
cept the retirement policy recom
mended at the Faculty Senate's
March 15 meeting. That recommen
dation was that the University con
tinue to require mandatory retire
ment of professors at age 65 until July
1, 1982, when state law prohibiting
mandatory retirement takes effect.
In the meantime full use of the power
to make discretionary recalls of pro
fessors past retirement age was also
recommended.
Lieberman said that an informal
survey had shown that most faculty
members who will be forced to retire
before the new law lakes effect have
indicated that they would like tocon
tinue teaching at least on a part-time
basis.
Joel Smith, vice president for de
velopment, reported that the Uni
versity expects to spend $4.5 million
this year in its fund-raising efforts
and expects this to yield a return of
$55 million in gifts. This averages out
to about 8 cents expended per dollar
raised, which is just slightly high..
Similar universities average 6 to 7Vi
cents.
