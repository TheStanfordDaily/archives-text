In the first part of the profile on
Richard Lyman (Daily, April 4), there
is a statement that the University was
shut down for two weeks because of
a student strike in the spring of 1970.
The statement, based on a Daily
article published later that year, was
incorrect. The article stated that the
University was "effectively" shut
down for two weeks, but no general
( losing of the University took place.
