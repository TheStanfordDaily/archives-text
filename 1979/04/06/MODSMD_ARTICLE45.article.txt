Terrorists hit Jerusalem bus stop
Terrorists waging an underground war against the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty bombed a bus stop in Arab
Jerusalem and struck Israeli and Egyptian targets in Cyp
rus yesterday. In Cairo, President Anwar Sadat told the
Palestinians "a bomb here and there" will not build a
homeland and appealed to them to join in the peace
process.
Sadat also warned of stern retribution for attacks
against Egypt.
Meanwhile, Egypt and Israel continued moving to
ward normal relations.
In the Sinai Peninsula, Egyptian civilians were allowed
for the first time since the 1 %7 Middle East War to come
and go as they pleased, without military passes, along
the main roads and in the villages of Egyptian-held areas.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin was booed by
settlers when he visited the Israeli settlement of Yamit in
the occupied Sinai, scheduled to be abandoned in the
Israeli withdrawal from the peninsula, and appealed to
residents to "accept the situation" for "the sake of
peace, for the sake of your children."
The bombing in Arab East Jerusalem wounded 10
Arabs and three Israelis, none seriously, authorities re
ported. Authorities said the bomb was in a bag placed
beside a bus that follows a route through both Arab and
lewish Jerusalem.
Police, rioters clash in Pakistan
Rawalpindi, Pakistan — Police fired tear x gas, ducked
barrages of rocks and bricks and arrested hundreds of
demonstrators yesterday as prayer meetings for exe
cuted former Prime Minister Zulfikar AM Bhutto turned
violent.
Demonstrators put up rock and barbed-wire bar
ricades on the street between Rawalpindi, where Bhutto
was hanged Wednesday, and the adjacent capital of
Islamabad to try to block police reinforcements.
Pakistani newspapers said Bhutto, 51, normally a pic
ture of self-control, broke down minutes before his
hanging, was forced from his cell and carried to the
gallows on a stretcher.
Disturbances also occurred in Lahore and Karachi, but
few injuries were reported. Protesters shouted slogans
against President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who ousted
Bhutto 21 months ago and refused to commute his death
sentence. Bhutto was convicted of ordering the murder
of a political opponent.
Amin claims attackers surrounded
Nairobi, Kenya — Ugandan President Idi Amin repor
tedly slipped into his capital of Kampala yesterday and
claimed his forces surrounded the Tanzanians and
Ugandan exiles besieging the city. Several of his top
aides fled to Kenya, however.
Military observers generally discounted Amin's claim
as another of the dramatic concoctions for which he is
famous, and a Tanzanian government spokesman in Dar
es Salaam said, "The push to Kampala is going steadily as
planned."

There was no independent confirmation of either
claim, although by most accounts Amin's eight-year-old
regime was on its last legs.
Meanwhile, there was a lull in the fighting, sources
said, possibly because the invaders wanted to give
Amin's forces, including his Libyan cadre, time to flee
and avoid a major battle.
However, diplomats and exiles reported the invaders
occupied Entebbe International Airport, 21 miles from
Kampala, following the departure yesterday of Libyan
defenders. The airport had been Amin's lifeline to his
Libyan backers, as well as an escape route.
Exile sources had said Wednesday night that Amin's
regime could fall in a few hours or a few days, depending
on how much resistance the Libyans put up.

Terrorists hit Jerusalem bus stop
Terrorists waging an underground war against the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty bombed a bus stop in Arab
Jerusalem and struck Israeli and Egyptian targets in Cyp
rus yesterday. In Cairo, President Anwar Sadat told the
Palestinians "a bomb here and there" will not build a
homeland and appealed to them to join in the peace
process.
Sadat also warned of stern retribution for attacks
against Egypt.
Meanwhile, Egypt and Israel continued moving to
ward normal relations.
In the Sinai Peninsula, Egyptian civilians were allowed
for the first time since the 1 %7 Middle East War to come
and go as they pleased, without military passes, along
the main roads and in the villages of Egyptian-held areas.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin was booed by
settlers when he visited the Israeli settlement of Yamit in
the occupied Sinai, scheduled to be abandoned in the
Israeli withdrawal from the peninsula, and appealed to
residents to "accept the situation" for "the sake of
peace, for the sake of your children."

ported. Authorities said the bomb was in a bag placed

Police, rioters clash in Pakistan
Rawalpindi, Pakistan — Police fired tear x gas, ducked
barrages of rocks and bricks and arrested hundreds of
demonstrators yesterday as prayer meetings for exe
cuted former Prime Minister Zulfikar AM Bhutto turned
violent.
Demonstrators put up rock and barbed-wire bar
ricades on the street between Rawalpindi, where Bhutto
was hanged Wednesday, and the adjacent capital of
Islamabad to try to block police reinforcements.
Pakistani newspapers said Bhutto, 51, normally a pic
ture of self-control, broke down minutes before his
hanging, was forced from his cell and carried to the
gallows on a stretcher.
Disturbances also occurred in Lahore and Karachi, but
few injuries were reported. Protesters shouted slogans
against President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who ousted
Bhutto 21 months ago and refused to commute his death
sentence. Bhutto was convicted of ordering the murder
of a political opponent.
Amin claims attackers surrounded
Nairobi, Kenya — Ugandan President Idi Amin repor
tedly slipped into his capital of Kampala yesterday and
claimed his forces surrounded the Tanzanians and
Ugandan exiles besieging the city. Several of his top
aides fled to Kenya, however.
Military observers generally discounted Amin's claim
as another of the dramatic concoctions for which he is
famous, and a Tanzanian government spokesman in Dar
es Salaam said, "The push to Kampala is going steadily as
planned."

There was no independent confirmation of either
claim, although by most accounts Amin's eight-year-old
regime was on its last legs.
Meanwhile, there was a lull in the fighting, sources
said, possibly because the invaders wanted to give
Amin's forces, including his Libyan cadre, time to flee
and avoid a major battle.
However, diplomats and exiles reported the invaders
occupied Entebbe International Airport, 21 miles from
Kampala, following the departure yesterday of Libyan
defenders. The airport had been Amin's lifeline to his
Libyan backers, as well as an escape route.
Exile sources had said Wednesday night that Amin's
regime could fall in a few hours or a few days, depending
on how much resistance the Libyans put up.
