# Campus begins to feel gasoline pinch
## 
### Gayle Mayers 
The recent 9 percent rise in oil
prices set by Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) and resulting gasoline
shortages will not immediately af
fect University services, but the
private motorist is already having
to cope with lines at the gas sta
tion, shorter service hours and
higher prices.
Gary Andrews, owner of the
Campus Shell station here, said
he expects to be allocated only 90
percent of his normal April gas
supply and as a result he has re
duced his service by 20 hours a
week.
Andrews said that Campus Shell
will close one hour earlier (8 p.m.
instead of 9 p.m.), reduce Satur
day service by three hours and
close all day Sunday.
Andrews said he raised his'gas
prices by one cent a gallon foflow
ing the most recent price rise and
said that he has only passed on

wholesale price increases to his
customers.
Motorists are less concerned
about price than they are about
availability, according to An
drews, but he added that it is dif
ficult to tell whether motorists are
cutting back on the use of their
cars because demand always rises
at the beginning of the quarter.
No choice for some
Higher gas prices may force
some off-campus students to ride
their bikes to school instead of
driving but others have no choice.
Paul Ahrens, an undergraduate
who works in Los Altos, said "I am
not going to change my driving
habits because there is not any al
ternative, but if prices got up to $2
a gallon and I didn't get a raise I
might consider quitting my job
and getting something closer to
campus."
Another student, who prefer
red to remain anonymous,
explained that "I have my father's

credit card."
Higher fuel prices will not affect
the Marguerite shuttle service,
according to Michael Demeter of
Peninsula Charter Buses, the
company which operates the ser
vice. Demeter said that fuel costs
are not a major factor in operating
a bus service because any price
rise is spread out over so many
people.
It currently costs 36 cents per
person pei mile and even if gas
prices were to double, the cost
would only go up 3.4 cents per
person per mile, Demeter
explained.
Demeter does not expect any
problems in securing gas supplies
for the Marguerite because public
transit systems receive priority al
location of fuel.
The Marguerite buses receive
gas supplies from the University's
Garage and Service Station, and
lerry Cunningham, supervisor at
the station, does not expect any

problems with University fuel
supplies until May at the earliest.
Priority service
Cunningham did not specify
which services would be curtailed
in the event of a shortage, but he
confirmed that the Marguerite
service would receive priority.
Frank Lara, spokesman for the
Santa Clara County Transit
Agency, said he expects the
number of bus passengers to in
crease as oil prices rise but bus
fares will not rise, as only about 40
percent of the fleet runs on diesel
fuel and the rest of the buses use
propane.
Phil Rector, associate director
of Service Operations for Utilities,
does not foresee any direct im
pact of oil shortages on the Uni
versity's Utility Service because
natural gas is the prime source of
heating and cooling energy and it
is supplemented by hydroelectric
power.
