# Med students rap proposed requirements

### Andrea James 
Students at the Medical School
here have posted an anonymous let
ter in their student lounge which ac
cuses faculty of "constant inter
departmental bickering" and of
"showing as little interest as possible
in the social, political, philosophical
or moral consequences of their
work."
The letter came in retaliation to a
memo signed by 41 faculty members
that endorsed more rigorous
scholastic standards in school be
cause of the students' lower scores
this year on National Board exams.
The Faculty Senate at the Med
School is currently debating whether
to reinstate a grading system and
whether current policies should be
changed so that failing grades are
placed on a student's record.
Some students have openly stated,
however, that a non-competitive
academic environment is more con
ducive to learning. They are prepar
ing alternative suggestions to the fa
culty recommendations for grades.
Lower scores
But the 41 faculty members who
signed the memo agreed that the
current policies contributed to lower
student test scores this year.
"If we had set out deliberately to
lower our academic standards and
the performance of our students,
here are some of the things we might
have done," the faculty memo states.
Listed are nine current policies of
the Med School including "Abolish
letter grades."
"As we have sown, so we have
reaped," the letter concludes.
"As you drone, so shall we sleep,"
the students retaliated in their
anonymous letter.
Student response
"If the faculty of Stanford Medical
School deliberately set about to dis
courage students from pursuing
careers in academic medicine . . .
they would:
"On all possible occasions express
contempt toward student opinion
and ability on the ground that if we
came to Stanford we must be lacking
in judgment."
Five additional conditions are
listed, one of which states that fa
culty deliberately designed courses
to be "excrutiatingly tedious" and
"longwinded."
Conflict over recommendation
This conflict between students and
faculty members was triggered by
last month's release of a Faculty Se
nate ad hoc committee recommen
dation to follow general student pre
ferences and not reinstate grading at
the Med School.
The committee, headed by Dr.
Ruth Gross, analyzed questionnaires
distributed to faculty, preclinical and
clinical students before making its
recommendation.
In its report, the committee states
the majority of the faculty feels that
the present pass-fail system of evalu
ation is inadequate.
Knowledge below standards?
Questionnaires also revealed that
one-fourth of the faculty thinks that
"Stanford is graduating a significant
number of students whose know
ledge is below acceptable stan
dards."
