# At 89, Lillie Mayer stays busy
## 
### Debbie Walker 
The old-fashioned desk lamp
illuminates the small room.
Creased paperbacks written by
Walt Whitman and Doris Les
sing lie atop an Early American
style dresser and detailed
weekly schedules are tacked
above them on the wall. A
painted orange juice can holds
a collection of pens and pen
cils. All is neat and orderly.
The burnished gold beads of
Lillie Mayer's necklace catch
the lamp's intense light, glitter
ing against her beige sweater.
She smiles and her darting eyes
crinkle behind her thick glas
ses. Grasping a pencil from the
homemade holder, she writes
a brief note to herself, her
wrinkled hands quickly form
ing a clear, legible script even
though she is 89 years old.
"The only trouble I have is

walking," Mayer reveals in a
subdued voice. Her bent hand
pats her short, curling white
hair. "That slows me down, but
I've always been busy and I still
am. I want to keep busy as long
as I can."
Mayer's wish appears to
have come true, for she has lit
tle spare time during her stay
here. Last quarter she was en
rolled in a literature courseand
she tilts her head toward the
paperbacks on her dresser as
she expresses her enthusiasm
for the class.
Her eyes sparkle as she
speaks of the Walt Whitman
readings, and she admits that
her love for English inspires
her to take a class every quar
ter. She is provided with a wide
range of courses to choose
from as she and her husband,
film critic Arthur Mayer, travel
. annually between USC, Stan
ford and Dartmouth.
Her husband comes to Stan
ford every winter quarter to
teach History of Film, and
Mayer spends much of her
! time arranging class-related ac
| tivities.
She says confidingly, "I'm
kind of his secretary, you
know."
Mayer supports women's
fight for equal rights and says
that her husband does also,
even though he has been
known to make such com
ments as "We got Nixon be
cause all the women voted."
They marched together in a
suffragette parade about 50
years ago and continue to be
strong for women's liberation.
"We're living in a whole new
time," she said. "I think it's
high time women find out
what's going on.
"It was different before,"

she confided, leaning forward
in her chair. "I always wanted
to be a doctor, ever since I cut
open a lobster in biology class
— I loved that.'' She laughs at
the memory. "But it never
struck me that I could have
gone to medical school. A
woman had a career only if she
had to support her children.
Most women did volunteer
work or painting and draw
ing."
And she did a great deal of
volunteer work following her
marriage to Arthur in 1913. She

'The only trouble I have is walking. That
slows me down, but I've always been busy
and I still am. I want to keep busy as long as I
can/

is also an accomplished artist.
Her painting has lagged dur
ing her stay here because of
herfull schedule, butshelooks
forward to Dartmouth where
she will have more time to
paint with an old friend.
"I do it for inner joy," she
explained. "I have a good time
when I'm working and I think
I'm quite free and frank in my
work."
As for volunteer work,
Mayer represented the Ameri
can Jewish Committee on the
Greensheet movie review
board, the predecessor of to
day's Motion Picture Associa
tion Rating Board. Meanwhile
her husband pursued his
career as a motion picture pub
licist at Paramount.
She remembered the post
war position as being very
time-consuming because
"there was a great diversity of

opinion and we had to try to
make concessions. Everyone
was always looking for some
thing against their religion or
particular interests."
But her voice became defiant
as she said, "We never said,
'You cannot send your child to
this movie.' People would only
know what we thought by read
ing the Greensheet."
Her hands emphasizing her
point, she said forcefully, "I
don't believe in any censor
ship. I don't believe movies are

going to hurt children."
Because of her positive at
titude toward films and be
cause of the involve
ment in the motion picture in
dustry, it is not surprising that
many of their children and
grandchildren are also in
volved in the movies.
Mayer tells eagerly of a call
she received from her son who
is on the Appeals Board, the
legislative body which can
overrule ratings designated by
the MPA Rating Board. He had
called to inform her of a sig
nificant decision made by the
Appeals Board.
"There used to be a four let
ter swear word that would ab
solutely give a movie an R rat
ing if it was included in the
script, but today a picture con
taining that one word got a PC
rating," she revealed. But she
is not upset by this signal of
changing times.
"The word is in common us
age. I don't happen to use it,
but I know Arthur does in his
lectures," she said with a
smile.
"We love talking to young
people," she said. "You have
to understand that most of our
generation is gone. I'm very
glad that we've made young
friends everywhere."
Young people also benefit
from having Mayer as a friend.
Marilyn Waldrom, a chauffeur
for the couple, said admiringly,
"She's really independent and
very active. She's a vital lady for
89. I hope I remember my
name when I'm that age."
But Mayer isn't as impressed
with her unusual energy and
vitality as are those around her.
She said with finality, "I
don't think the golden years
are the best years. I would love
to be young again and I would
love to make all the mistakes
again. But let me say that it is
better than the alternative."
She turned off the desk lamp
and rose from the small chair, a
woman from the past who par
ticipates and thrives in the pre
sent.
