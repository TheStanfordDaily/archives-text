# Loneliness inherent in Stanford's system
## Zimbardo's classes try to combat alienation 
### Pete Van Sickel 
Loneliness and alienation
are problems inherent in Stan
ford's system of education.
This is the opinion of Dr.
Philip Zimbardo, professor of
psychology here. But his opin
ion is exactly the opposite of
the opinion at Cowell Student
Health Center, according to
Zimbardo's graduate assistant,
Susan Andersen.
"The attitude at Cowell is
that loneliness and alienation
are the student's problem and
the student is dealt with on an
individual basis in some kind of
psychoanalysis to try to dis
cover why he feels lonely or
alienated," she explained.
But in the average year, 600
students report to Cowell with
complaints of feeling lonely.
"What if all 600 students
showed up at the same time
complaining about loneli
ness?" Zimbardo asked. "Then
you would be less likely to say
it's any one individual's prob
lem. You would begin to sus
pect there is something about
the Stanford environment that
promotes loneliness."
Students in last quarter's
class "The Human Connec
tion" worked with Zimbardo in
trying to analyze what it is
about the Stanford system that
fosters loneliness and aliena
tion. Among those ideas
studied were competition
among students for grades,
lack of student participation in
the teaching process, lack of a
central gathering place where
students can meet and be to
gether in a casual environ
ment, the structured course
curricula and the strong em
phasi;, on early commitment to
a career.
Competition for grades is
indeed a component of the
education system here that
promotes alienation and lonel
iness, the students found.
Using the normal distribution

of test scores to determine
course grades insures that
some students will be winners
and some will be losers in the
game of getting grades.
To combat this, Zimbardo
uses a grading system that
eliminates competition and
redirects the competitive drive
into a learning drive. He said
he uses the idea of grading on a
"mastery" of the course mate
rial. He sets the criteria that a
student has to score 85 percent
or better on a test to pass or get
credit for having "mastered"
the material presented. The
grade is then determined by
how much material is "mas
tered."
Zimbardo used the mastery
system in "The Human Con
nection." Those choosing to
get a C for the course had to
read the four books on the
reading list, pass a test on two
of the books and write an ac
ceptable critique of the other
two. To get a B a student had to
do the work required of a C,
come to lecture and pass a test
on the lecture material. The
student who wanted an A fulfil
led those requirements and
did the alienation and loneli
ness project.

"One of the great things
about the mastery system is
that students can determine
for themselves how much time
they want to put into the
course," Andersen said. "The
students are not forced into an
intense study of something
that maybe they only have a
casual interest in at the mo
ment."
To encourage student in
teraction and cooperation in
the learning process Zimbardo
made it mandatory that each
student have a partner of the
opposite sex to work with on
fulfilling class requirements;
only the lecture test was re
quired to be taken alone.
These teams were determined
arbitrarily so people who were
less assertive in choosing
partners felt no pressure to
find a teammate. The arbit
rary selection also reduced the
tendency of people to choose
friends for partners, thereby
widening the circle of people
each student got to know in the
class.
Andersen said the education
system here promotes a pas
sive, uninvolved role for the
undergraduates.
"Their model is to be a pas

sive listener and notetaker at
lectures and then to regurgi
tate those notes for the exam,"
she explained. And it's this
kind of passive role that prom
otes a sense of alienation from
the process of learning, she
added.
The lack of student involve
ment is another factor of lonel
iness that Zimbardo tried to
change. In his course, under
graduates lead the sections
and small groups met outside
of the regular lecture to discuss
course topics.
Another way Zimbardo gets
students involved in the teach
ing process is in the "proctor
method," which is being used
this term in Psychology 1. With
this method an undergraduate
who has previously taken the
course gets course credit for
helping other students learn.
The proctor is responsible to a
small number of students and
meets with them to administer
weekly tests. The proctor and
student go over the test im
mediately after the student is
finished to discuss any material
that the student didn't under
stand. If it is decided the stu
dent needs some further assis
tance, the proctor serves as a

direct link to the graduate as
sistants and Zimbardo.
Jeff Wachtel, another un
dergraduate assistant for Zim
bardo's Human Connection
class, said that an important
thing the students get from the
course is an awareness that
there are a lot of people who
have been alienated by the en
vironment here.
"It's very easy for some
people to just fade into the
background to the extent that
they become anonymous," he
said. "Zimbardo has said in
class, 'You can go through four
years of school here and do
well without having to ever talk
to anyone.' When the sections
meet we tell the section lead
ers to be particularly aware of
the students who don't partici
pate and to try to bring them
into the discussion."
Andersen said that one
reason why systems are slow to
change is that people don't
realize there are viable alterna
tives to that system. One of the
goals of the Human Connec
tion course was to let people
know there are alternatives to
competition, passive accep
tance, alienation and loneli
ness. '

the teaching process, lack of a
central gathering place where
students can meet and be to
gether in a casual environ
ment, the structured course
curricula and the strong em
phasi;, on early commitment to
a career.
Competition for grades is
indeed a component of the
education system here that
promotes alienation and lonel
iness, the students found.
Using the normal distribution

of test scores to determine
course grades insures that
some students will be winners
and some will be losers in the
game of getting grades.
To combat this, Zimbardo
uses a grading system that
eliminates competition and
redirects the competitive drive
into a learning drive. He said
he uses the idea of grading on a
"mastery" of the course mate
rial. He sets the criteria that a
student has to score 85 percent
or better on a test to pass or get
credit for having "mastered"
the material presented. The
grade is then determined by
how much material is "mas
tered."
Zimbardo used the mastery
system in "The Human Con
nection." Those choosing to
get a C for the course had to
read the four books on the
reading list, pass a test on two
of the books and write an ac
ceptable critique of the other
two. To get a B a student had to
do the work required of a C,
come to lecture and pass a test
on the lecture material. The
student who wanted an A fulfil
led those requirements and
did the alienation and loneli
ness project.

"One of the great things
about the mastery system is
that students can determine
for themselves how much time
they want to put into the
course," Andersen said. "The
students are not forced into an
intense study of something
that maybe they only have a
casual interest in at the mo
ment."
To encourage student in
teraction and cooperation in
the learning process Zimbardo
made it mandatory that each
student have a partner of the
opposite sex to work with on
fulfilling class requirements;
only the lecture test was re
quired to be taken alone.
These teams were determined
arbitrarily so people who were
less assertive in choosing
partners felt no pressure to
find a teammate. The arbit
rary selection also reduced the
tendency of people to choose
friends for partners, thereby
widening the circle of people
each student got to know in the
class.
Andersen said the education
system here promotes a pas
sive, uninvolved role for the
undergraduates.
"Their model is to be a pas

sive listener and notetaker at
lectures and then to regurgi
tate those notes for the exam,"
she explained. And it's this
kind of passive role that prom
otes a sense of alienation from
the process of learning, she
added.
The lack of student involve
ment is another factor of lonel
iness that Zimbardo tried to
change. In his course, under
graduates lead the sections
and small groups met outside
of the regular lecture to discuss
course topics.
Another way Zimbardo gets
students involved in the teach
ing process is in the "proctor
method," which is being used
this term in Psychology 1. With
this method an undergraduate
who has previously taken the
course gets course credit for
helping other students learn.
The proctor is responsible to a
small number of students and
meets with them to administer
weekly tests. The proctor and
student go over the test im
mediately after the student is
finished to discuss any material
that the student didn't under
stand. If it is decided the stu
dent needs some further assis
tance, the proctor serves as a

direct link to the graduate as
sistants and Zimbardo.
Jeff Wachtel, another un
dergraduate assistant for Zim
bardo's Human Connection
class, said that an important
thing the students get from the
course is an awareness that
there are a lot of people who
have been alienated by the en
vironment here.
"It's very easy for some
people to just fade into the
background to the extent that
they become anonymous," he
said. "Zimbardo has said in
class, 'You can go through four
years of school here and do
well without having to ever talk
to anyone.' When the sections
meet we tell the section lead
ers to be particularly aware of
the students who don't partici
pate and to try to bring them
into the discussion."
Andersen said that one
reason why systems are slow to
change is that people don't
realize there are viable alterna
tives to that system. One of the
goals of the Human Connec
tion course was to let people
know there are alternatives to
competition, passive accep
tance, alienation and loneli
ness. '


Philip Zimbardo
Loneliness and alienation
are problems inherent in Stan
ford's system of education.
This is the opinion of Dr.
Philip Zimbardo, professor of
psychology here. But his opin
ion is exactly the opposite of
the opinion at Cowell Student
Health Center, according to
Zimbardo's graduate assistant,
Susan Andersen.
"The attitude at Cowell is
that loneliness and alienation
are the student's problem and
the student is dealt with on an
individual basis in some kind of
psychoanalysis to try to dis
cover why he feels lonely or
alienated," she explained.
But in the average year, 600
students report to Cowell with
complaints of feeling lonely.
"What if all 600 students
showed up at the same time
complaining about loneli
ness?" Zimbardo asked. "Then
you would be less likely to say
it's any one individual's prob
lem. You would begin to sus
pect there is something about
the Stanford environment that
promotes loneliness."
Students in last quarter's
class "The Human Connec
tion" worked with Zimbardo in
trying to analyze what it is
about the Stanford system that
fosters loneliness and aliena
tion. Among those ideas
studied were competition
among students for grades,
lack of student participation in
