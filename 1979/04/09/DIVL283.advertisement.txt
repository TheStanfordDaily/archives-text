VISTA
Are you a self-starter who believes that social change on
behalf of the poor and powerless in America is possible?
If so, you belong in VISTA.
VISTA volunteers serve one year working with non-profit
organizations, neighborhood self-help groups and social
service agencies. Their goal is to help the poor and power
less in our society have a greater voice in the decisions that
affect their lives.
As a VISTA you may organize community action groups to
deal with neighborhood issues, or work on projects related
to consumer affairs, legal services, business and economic
development, housing, education, youth counseling, or
health and nutrition.
Your degree or relevant community work experience may
qualify you for the experience of your life. See our repre
sentatives for information on current and future openings
