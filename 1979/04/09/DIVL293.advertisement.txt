A QUOTE FROM A VERY SUCCESSFUL PERSON
"I like working at something where the sky is the limit, I like knowing that my boss won't
be mad if I make more money than he does. I like knowing that no one has to die or retire
in order for me to make progress. I like knowing that when I made a dollar, my clients
make many more. I like the security which comes from my skill in selling which, once I've
got it, nobody can take it away from me. I get a thrill out of influencing men's minds to
sound conclusion for their own benefit, and I like my independence."
