# Celebrities' children don't flaunt their family ties
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
"And what do your parents
do?" asks the bleary-eyed indi
vidual to your right. You re
spond in an equally noncom
mittal fashion and your inter
rogator nods his disinterest.
This may be a common oc
currence in your life, but for
some students here such a
banal experience would be
considered atypical. Members
of this select group cannot
honestly answer a question
concerning their parents with
out getting attention, for they
are the offspring of famous fi
gures.
Whereas these celebrities'
children may not purposely
conceal their parents' iden
tities, neither do they flaunt
their extraordinary familial
ties.
Senior Jon Gibson, the son
of Nashville star and Laugh-In

poet Henry Gibson, said, "I
certainly don't try to hide it,
but I try never to drop it," in
reference to his father's status.
Jamie MacDougall, the son
of actress Nanette Fabray, ag
reed that he doesn't bring up
the subject of parental occupa
tions, but added that if he's
asked who his mother is, he'll
tell the truth.
Fred Cheever, a junior
whose father is author John
Cheever, commented, "I don't
advertise it. I play a guessing
game with English teachers
since my last name is not very
common. The Stanford English
department has me pegged."
Senior economics major
Steve Hailey, son of novelist
Arthur Hailey, said, "At first I
didn't tell anyone, but people
found out. I don't deny it any
more, but it's a subject I try to
avoid."
Even though a conversation
may be manipulated to evade
parental discussion, family
background will eventually re
veal itself. Then, the inclina
tion for acquaintances to react
differently toward the progeny
of well-known personalities
may be overwhelming and al
most inescapable.
"I understand why people
do that, but it's still funny for
me," MacDougall said. "I con
tinue to deal with them in the
same manner when, all of a
sudden, they have a different
attitude of me."
Gibson said, "With close
friends, it makes absolutely no
difference, but with superficial
acquaintances, I'm sure it af
fects them and that they act dif

ferently. It really doesn't mat
ter, though."
Hailey agreed that "my
friends don't care about it. It's
not really a big deal."
Claiming that "this is
California (where) most people
don't read," Cheever alleged
that his father is generally "not
visible at all out here."
"It's not as if I can get stu
dents a job," he said. "It's hard
enough for me to find a job
myself."
People want recognition on
their own merits, and the chil
dren of headline-makers seem
no different in this respect, but
they may be hindered by their
parents' names.
Remarking on his father's
success, Cheever said, "Basi
cally it's a bother because at
Stanford, if you're complacent,
you want to do as well as your
parents, and if you're ambiti
ous, you want to do better.
This is unrealistic for the child
of a famous person. I'll never
be as good at anything as my
father is at what he does, and
this cuts into my identity."
"I like to be known as my
self, not as my father's son,"
Hailey explained, while Mac-
Dougall said he wished that
"people would ask me for my
autograph. I try to get people
to accept me for me. I want to
be known as Jamie Mac-
Dougall, not Jamie Fabray."
According to all four, their
parents tried to instill a sense
of independence in their chil
dren.
So although they are rather
reluctant to follow in their pa
rents' footsteps, Gibson,

MacDougall and Cheever said
they have entertained
thoughts of entering their pa
rents' professional field.
As his father was a writer and
at one time president of the
Screenwriters' Guild, Mac-
Dougall admitted that with
both his parents' experience,
"I had a really good in into
show business." He has per
formed in a few sequences of
his mother's early 1960s televi
sion series, Ves, Yes, Nanette,
had a leading role in Magic
Carpet and played bit parts in
his father's film, The Cockeyed
Cowboys of Calico County. He
has also done several commer
cials and acted in his high
school productions.
"Now, here I ama pre-med,"
MacDougall concluded. "I
could have gone into acting if I
had wanted to, but I guess that
I subconsciously decided that
there was no way I could follow

in my parents' footsteps with
out being compared."
Cheever, a history major,
confessed that he still has de
signs of becoming a writer. He
is, however, aware of a stigma
attached to that goal.
"It's like resigning yourself
to always being the second
Cheever â€” Cheever the
minor," he said. He added that
his brother and sister are both
full-time journalists, "so it's in
the family."
Gibson acted in high school
and starred in a play staged by
La Maison Francaise last quar
ter. A comparative literature
major, he plans to attend law
school and hopes to assume a
production capacity or write in
the entertainment sphere. "I
plan to put myself in a position
where actors would die to
work for me," he said.
Gibson summarized his re
servation about an acting
career. "Most people assume
that I would somehow natur
ally be a talented person. This,
per se, is a ludicrous assump

tion. I like to act, and I find it
even artistically fulfilling, but I
wouldn't say that talent is
hereditary. Look at the Sinatra
children, for example.
"I would never be foolish
enough to want to become an
actor," he continued. "I heard
once that 5 percent or less of all
union actors are able to earn a
self-sufficient wage. Acting's
great, but it's not worth that
kind of aggravation."
Hailey immediately dismis
sed the thought of entering a
writing career. "It just doesn't
appeal to me," he said.
These celebrity children re
flected positively upon their
parents' accomplishments, but
they maintained that having a
nationally acclaimed parent
can become confusing.
"I get a weird feeling seeing
my mother on TV," Mac-
Dougall said. "I see two diffe
rent people at the same time:
Mom and Her.' " Her is a part
of a family joke and refers to
"the person wearing the
make-up," he explained.

Besides the notoriety, the
claim to fame, the attached
glory and the material benefits,
how would you feel if your pa
rent's name became a house
hold word, plastered across
the country? Cheever provided
a little insight when he discus
sed the appearance of his
father's picture on the cover of
Newsweek last year. "It's a
shock to see your father's pic
ture in lunches and trash
cans," he said.
