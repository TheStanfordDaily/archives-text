## Nuclear dangers not exaggerated 
### 
In a Daily article titled,
"Media accused of 'sen
sationalizing' nukes"( April 4),
Dr. Edward Teller of the
Hoover Institution distorted
information and took far too
lightly the most serious com
mercial nuclear accident in
U.S. history, that at Three Mile
Island.
Authorities agree that the
plant was on the verge of blow
ing up. The media has not
exaggerated the seriousness of
the event.According to the
Rasmussen Report, a major
nuclear accident could kill
3300' people, injure 330,000
others and cause $14 billion
worth of property damage.
It is not true, as Teller said,
that "nobody suffered." From
80,000 to 250,000 people fled;
they were highly inconveni
enced and mentally abused.
Many have sought psychiatric
treatment because of the
trauma of the experience.
The nuclear industry might
have lost only $200 million, as
Teller suggests, but this is un
likely. The estimate is far too
low since the $1 billion plant
may have to be shut down
permanently. The real losers,
as Teller neglects to point out,
are the consumers of Met
ropolitan Edison Company

who must foot the bill replac
ing energy lost at Three Mile Is
land, the initial cost of the
plant, and the cost of decom
missioning and guarding it.
Teller says, "we need more
energy and less horror
stories." However, nuclear
power provides only about 13
percent of our electricity and
electricity provides 28 percent
of U.S. energy needs. There
fore only about .1.6 percent of
our country's energy is nuc
lear. Teller fails to point out
that we can have as much
energy as all nuclear plants
provide merely by increasing
our energy efficiency through
conservation efforts or
through the use of alternative
energy sources.
According to a Dow study,
U.S. industry by 1985 could
economically use "cogenera
tion" to provide half of its own
electrical needs from industrial
waste heat. This would save the
equivalent of two to three mill
ion barrels of oil per day or the
output of fifty large reactors.
(There are now 36 large reac
tors in the United States.)
The American Institute of
Architects has calculated that a
massive program to make
buildings energy-efficient
would save 12.5 million barrels

of oil per day by 1990. This
equals one-third of current na
tional energy use or about 10
times as much energy as U.S.
nuclear reactors currently pro
vide.
Because of the inefficiency
of producing electricity from
fossil fuels or uranium, every
unit of energy saved by the
consumer saves three units of
fuel at the power plant.
Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Paul Kruger said "one
should not expect 100 percent
safety." But he neglects to
point out that other energy
sources — solar, wind and
conservation — are capable of
providing the same amount of
power and are far safer. A large
accident at a wind or solar
generator would not force tens
of thousands of people to flee,
schools to be closed and
cancer-causing radiation to be
released into the environment.
"The profit motive," as Tel
ler said "is not absent even in
reporters." But it is only fair to
add that the profit motive is
also far from absent in those
who control the nuclear indus
try. They have invested bill
ions, and one can't seriously
expect true objectivity from
them. Their entire livelihoods

and fortunes are at stake.
How can Teller compare a
possible nuclearaccident to an
airplane crash when perhaps
200 people would be killed in a
plane crash, and thousands
could be killed or seriously ir
radiated in a nuclear accident
with a large area abandoned
due to radioactivity?
It is foolish to take such
enormous risks for only J. 6
percent of our energy when
other proven alternatives exist
that are far cheaper and safer.

In a Daily article titled,
"Media accused of 'sen
sationalizing' nukes"( April 4),
Dr. Edward Teller of the
Hoover Institution distorted
information and took far too
lightly the most serious com
mercial nuclear accident in
U.S. history, that at Three Mile
Island.
Authorities agree that the
plant was on the verge of blow
ing up. The media has not
exaggerated the seriousness of
the event.According to the
Rasmussen Report, a major
nuclear accident could kill
3300' people, injure 330,000
others and cause $14 billion
worth of property damage.
It is not true, as Teller said,
that "nobody suffered." From
80,000 to 250,000 people fled;
they were highly inconveni
enced and mentally abused.
Many have sought psychiatric
treatment because of the
trauma of the experience.
The nuclear industry might
have lost only $200 million, as
Teller suggests, but this is un
likely. The estimate is far too
low since the $1 billion plant
may have to be shut down
permanently. The real losers,
as Teller neglects to point out,
are the consumers of Met
ropolitan Edison Company

who must foot the bill replac
ing energy lost at Three Mile Is
land, the initial cost of the
plant, and the cost of decom
missioning and guarding it.
Teller says, "we need more
energy and less horror
stories." However, nuclear
power provides only about 13
percent of our electricity and
electricity provides 28 percent
of U.S. energy needs. There
fore only about .1.6 percent of
our country's energy is nuc
lear. Teller fails to point out
that we can have as much
energy as all nuclear plants
provide merely by increasing
our energy efficiency through
conservation efforts or
through the use of alternative
energy sources.
According to a Dow study,
U.S. industry by 1985 could
economically use "cogenera
tion" to provide half of its own
electrical needs from industrial
waste heat. This would save the
equivalent of two to three mill
ion barrels of oil per day or the
output of fifty large reactors.
(There are now 36 large reac
tors in the United States.)
The American Institute of
Architects has calculated that a
massive program to make
buildings energy-efficient
would save 12.5 million barrels

of oil per day by 1990. This
equals one-third of current na
tional energy use or about 10
times as much energy as U.S.
nuclear reactors currently pro
vide.
Because of the inefficiency
of producing electricity from
fossil fuels or uranium, every
unit of energy saved by the
consumer saves three units of
fuel at the power plant.
