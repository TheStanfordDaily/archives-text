## Forced retirement unwise 
### 
Since I'm scheduled to re
tire from Stanford in 2005,1 can
speak on the question of man
datory retirement at age 65
without arousing suspicion of
gross self-interest.
The argument in favor of
maintaining the present regu
lation until 1982 is basically fi
nancial (i.e. these professors
cost us too much), though it is
dressed out with humane de
coration (i.e. we must make
roomforyoungerscholars). In
terms of the oversupply of
Ph.D. s, sticking to the current
rules will hardly make a dent.
So let me address the financial
proposition, which, cynic that I
am, I believe is at the heart of
the matter.
How much will these scho
lars and teachers cost the Uni

versity? And how much are
they worth?
I would submit that they are,
in many instances, our most
valuable asset, and only
false economy would lead us to
conclude that we can't afford
them. Let me cite inevitably
two examples from my own
immediate field of expertise:
modern European history. The
University has the country's
leading historian of modern
Germany and the country's
leading historian of modern
France, the former just reach
ing retirement, the latter just
past it.
These scholars put us on the
academic map: they attract in
teresting graduate students
and induce distinguished intel
lectuals at other universities to
think that Stanford might not

be such a bad place to work.
They are also two of the best
teachers in the University.
Students who take their
courses suddenly find that
Stanford might be worth all
that money.
These men are at the same
time effective administrators
who care about the University
and have improved it in in
numerable ways. And they are
splendid colleagues, by which
I mean not merely that they
make good company, are witty
and humane, but, above all,
they know things, lots of
things, about lots of different
subjects. In short, they are the
University's supreme asset:
knowledgeable human beings
who are willing to share their
knowledge and do so effec
tively.
And we can't afford them?
When we can afford a new lib
rary, a new engineering build
ing, a new history corner? At
the risk of sounding like a poor
man's John Henry Newman, I
would suggest we should re
member that a university is an
idea. It is an intellectual, not a
physical event.
Moreover I suspect that it is
precisely because of our
forgetfulness about the Uni
versity's fundamentally intel
lectual nature that we do such a
rotten job with the University
as a set of physical artifacts.
Stanford is an architectural dis
aster area. Only mindlessness
can account for the great
majority of buildings put up
during the past two decades,
many of which, before long,
are going to be such an embar
rassment that we'll have them
dismantled or simply plowed
under. The same mindlessness
accounts for the miserable
condition of our classrooms
and the nightmare of the
bookstore.
Since our hold on the life of
the mind is tenuous already, to
unload precisely those persons
who do most to keep us in
touch with it would be sheer
intellectual masochism.
