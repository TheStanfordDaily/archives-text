# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Yehudi Busaibis Leave Soviet Jews alone 
### 
Attending the Shcharansky rally, I could not
help sympathizing with Avital Shcharansky's
personal ordeal. Nonetheless, I was angered by
the fact that the rally sponsors, who have or
ganized a nation-wide "Free Shcharansky"
campaign, were actually fooling everyone.
Shcharansky, a Soviet citizen, was tried in
Moscow and found guilty of anti-Soviet prop
aganda, high treason, espionage and spying.
Unofficial sources in Washington confirmed
these accusations and the American press, e.g.
Time and Newsweek, reported it.
Charges against Shcharansky are in many
ways similar, in nature if not in magnitude, to
the charges once pressed against Ethel and
Julius Rosenberg. Vet the Rosenbergs, who
were American citizens, were electrocuted for
treason in the United States whereas
Shcharansky is lucky enough to get away with
only 13 years in a Soviet prison.
I am not trying to propagate Soviet justice; I
am only saying that the American people are
being made fools of by the Shcharansky cam
paign.
The question then is: Why the Shcharansky
campaign? Who benefits from it? The answer is
simple: Israel.
Israel needs European and American Jewish
immigrants and needs them desperately. The
moment they set foot on Israeli soil they au
tomatically become Israeli citizens.
Ever since its establishment in 1948, Israeli
authorities have been alarmed by the fact that
Oriental Jews are a majority in Israel. Further,
the Arabs of Israel make up about 16 percent of
the total population.
Both Arabs and Oriental Jews are considered
less developed than European or American Jews
and, thus, do not "contribute" as much to Israeli
society. So where does Israel get her precious
European and American Jews?
Almost everywhere in Europe, the Americas
and Australia, Jews are much better off than they
are in Israel. Besides, Israel cannot accuse the
governments of these countries of discrimina
tion against jews. Instead, Israel presses the

issue of discrimination against the Soviet Union
where there is a tremendously large potential
resource of highly skilled Jews. Under all-too
familiar slogans such as anti-Semitism and
human rights, it has launched a campaign
against the Soviet Union aimed at getting as
many of its Jews out into Israel as possible.
The Soviet Union is a Marxist country commit
ted to both atheism and collective ownership, it
is true that Soviet lews are discouraged from
worship but so are Soviet Christians and Mos
lems. It is true the Jews cannot own much prop
erty in the Soviet Union but this is also true of
everybody else. As far as the Soviet bureaucracy
and other institutions are concerned, discrimi
nation against Jews simply does not exist. Jews
who make up 1.5 percent of the Soviet people
have been, since the 1917 Revolution, over
represented in positions of political, bureaucra
tic and scientific leadership.
If any discrimination against Soviet Jews takes
place in the Soviet Union, it will be a by-product
of Israeli and international Zionist campaigns
aimed at creating an air of suspicion and hate
between Soviet Jews and non-Jews. The suspi
cion and hate will make Soviet leaders and even
the public distrust Jews. Distrust is hoped to
cause discrimination against Jews. Discrimina
tion will cause more hate, more distrust, more
dissent and more emigrants to Israel.
Indeed, it is only likely that the Soviet leader
ship will find it more and more difficult to en
trust military, scientific or any strategic secrets
to citizens whose loyalty is suspected. Nor is the
Soviet Union expected to admit Soviet Jews into
expensive institutions of higher training if Is
rael is the country to reap the fruits of their
training.
Discrimination, if the present feverish cam
paign continues, is unfortunately a future likeli
hood for Soviet Jews. Israel may gain a few
thousand of these highly trained Jews. The
majority will remain in their homeland to payfor
Israel's malicipus paranoia.

being made fools of by the Shcharansky cam
paign.
The question then is: Why the Shcharansky
campaign? Who benefits from it? The answer is
simple: Israel.
Israel needs European and American Jewish
immigrants and needs them desperately. The
moment they set foot on Israeli soil they au
tomatically become Israeli citizens.
Ever since its establishment in 1948, Israeli
authorities have been alarmed by the fact that
Oriental Jews are a majority in Israel. Further,
the Arabs of Israel make up about 16 percent of
the total population.
Both Arabs and Oriental Jews are considered
less developed than European or American Jews
and, thus, do not "contribute" as much to Israeli
society. So where does Israel get her precious
European and American Jews?
Almost everywhere in Europe, the Americas
and Australia, Jews are much better off than they
are in Israel. Besides, Israel cannot accuse the
governments of these countries of discrimina
tion against jews. Instead, Israel presses the

issue of discrimination against the Soviet Union
where there is a tremendously large potential
resource of highly skilled Jews. Under all-too
familiar slogans such as anti-Semitism and
human rights, it has launched a campaign
against the Soviet Union aimed at getting as
many of its Jews out into Israel as possible.
The Soviet Union is a Marxist country commit
ted to both atheism and collective ownership, it
is true that Soviet lews are discouraged from
worship but so are Soviet Christians and Mos
lems. It is true the Jews cannot own much prop
erty in the Soviet Union but this is also true of
everybody else. As far as the Soviet bureaucracy
and other institutions are concerned, discrimi
nation against Jews simply does not exist. Jews
who make up 1.5 percent of the Soviet people
have been, since the 1917 Revolution, over
represented in positions of political, bureaucra
tic and scientific leadership.
If any discrimination against Soviet Jews takes
place in the Soviet Union, it will be a by-product
of Israeli and international Zionist campaigns
aimed at creating an air of suspicion and hate
between Soviet Jews and non-Jews. The suspi
cion and hate will make Soviet leaders and even
the public distrust Jews. Distrust is hoped to
cause discrimination against Jews. Discrimina
tion will cause more hate, more distrust, more
dissent and more emigrants to Israel.
Indeed, it is only likely that the Soviet leader
ship will find it more and more difficult to en
trust military, scientific or any strategic secrets
to citizens whose loyalty is suspected. Nor is the
Soviet Union expected to admit Soviet Jews into
expensive institutions of higher training if Is
rael is the country to reap the fruits of their
training.
Discrimination, if the present feverish cam
paign continues, is unfortunately a future likeli
hood for Soviet Jews. Israel may gain a few
thousand of these highly trained Jews. The
majority will remain in their homeland to payfor
Israel's malicipus paranoia.
