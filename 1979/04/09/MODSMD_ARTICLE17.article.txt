Near libel
The article appearing in the
Daily (April 2) entitled "Inves
tigation in Pizza Express theft"
is an extremely poor example
of objective journalism. Al
though I am not a member of
any fraternity oq campus I must
sympathize with Delta Tau
Delta for the near-libel you
have perpetrated.
Although the article clearly
states that it is pure "specula
tion" that a Delt was involved,
the name of the fraternity ap
pears no less than 15 times. Six
teen column inches are de
voted to dredging up past
events involving Delts.
This exhibition of mudsling
ing ought to be roundly con
demned. It is interesting to
note that this was the only arti
cle to appear without a byline.

Editor's note: The only reason
that article did not have a
byline was because I wrote it; it
took me only a short time to
complete and I therefore did
not feel the credit of a byline
was warranted. Nothing sinis
ter was intended or implied by
the fact. Often Daily editors
print articles without bylines
because they are short, easy
pieces, and not because the
editor wishes to avoid identifi
cation.
As for the charge of "near
libel," I suggest you read the
law. No individuals were
named in the story. Guilt-by
association was possible based
on facts presented in the arti
cle. Group libel is a difficult
thing to accomplish. Courts
have held that groups of grea
ter than 15 cannot bring an ac
tion for libel.
But the best defense for
libel is of course the truth. Ev
erything in ths article is fact,
and though you may consider it
unfair, "near libel" it certainly
is not.
Personally, I do not feel the
Delts were dealt with unfairly. I
made a special effort to be
quite objective in the report
ing. You are correct about the
number of times the word
"Delt" is included in the story;
however, if you read the story,
no intimation of any kind that
the Delts may have been in
volved was made until the story
was nearly half over.
Some administrators here
seemed to feel the Delts were
quite possibly involved, and
the offense would be consi
dered more serious, if true, in
light of the very relevant past
offenses of the organization.
Those offenses were not elabo
rated upon. They were merely
mentioned briefly as
background.
I stand by the story com
pletely.

Ecology events
This is the University's first
Environment Month. The
month is dedicated to explor
ing the causes of our environ
mental problems — pollution,
energy, resource depletion
and population growth — and
looking at possible solutions.
There will be speakers, panel
discussions, workshops, dis
plays, slide shows, an alterna
tive energy fair and entertain
ment.
The Environment Month
Committee, composed of the
Speaker's Bureau, Stanford
Energy Action, the SWOPSI
"Wilderness Policy" class, and
others have worked very hard
to make this an exciting, edu
cational and objective series of
events involving many distin
guished government, busi
ness, university and environ
mental experts.
We feel there is a strong link
between environmental prob
lems and inflation, resource
shortages and cartels, un
employment and public health
and safety. Emphasis will be
given more to discussion of
possible solutions to problems
rather than just dwelling on the
problems themselves.
Environment Month will be
an important forum for discus
sion of our country's most
seriotis problems.

A SURE bet
In line with our aim of
educating the Stanford com
munity about rape, we would
like to register our support and
endorsement of Students Un
ited for Rape Elimination, the
escort service.
Ron Lepow has worked dili
gently to organize this coed
group and we commend him
for his efforts. These Stanford
students have volunteered
their time to help other mem
bers of the campus commun
ity.
The service operates six days
a week, and is still taking
people who would like to be
escorts.

Draft threatening
In his column (Daily, March
7), Ted Andrews complains
that many of the arguments
against the draft sound self
serving. Indeed they are, and
quite deservedly so. If the
youth of America don't speak
up for their own interest, they
will allow a combination of
right-wing militarists and left
wing social engineers to drag
them off, disrupt their lives,
and force them to serve the

grand designs ot a myopic few.
A couple of points must be
made about Andrews' argu
ments in favor of national ser
vice. First, a volunteer army
does indeed, as he claims, be
come a way for the poor to
fight the wars. However, they
are doing so voluntarily; this is
certainly better than in the
past, when the poor were in
voluntarily pressed into ser
vice.
Second, a draft is more than
merely "service for a limited
period of time to the rest of
society." It is involuntary ser
vice — and no matter how li
mited the service or noble the
purpose, "involuntary service"
is but a glorified and
euphemistic description of
slavery.
Third, Andrews complains
that "it's very impractical, and
expensive" to have the un
pleasant jobs done by people

voluntarily, because wages
must be too high, etc. This ar
gument is quite insidious, and
is simply wrong.
Costs would not disappear
merely because young people
were forced to perform tasks at
low wages; rather, the costs
would be borne solely by the
young.
Finally, national service is
justified because "a little bed
pan scrubbing could do a lot of
people here a lot of good."
That might be true, but so
what? What gives Andrews the
right to force people to do it?
National service is a funda
mental threat to us all: the right
wants cannon fodder, and the
left wants to turn us all into
smiling cherubs. If that is An
drews' bag, he can join — vol
untarily. But he has no right to
drag the rest of us along too.
