## Keep life rights 
### 
Men have written articles in
publications here against abor
tion rights recently. Here is a
different view.
I'm not going to say we need
abortion rights for population
control or as a way to solve our
economic troubles. I look at
abortion rights as a solution to
problems caused by cir
cumstances of birth arising
from biological and cultural
disparities. This inequity harms
women in our society and is to
everybody's detriment.
First there is the double
standard. A common attitude
still is that if you are "good"
you won't be pregnant, so if
you are "bad" you should pay
retribution for it. One "pays"
by becoming an outcast, stig
matized and bringing disgrace
to the family. This is a social
more, not an attitude that is
based on concern for indi
vidual human life.
Second, only the pregnant
woman bears the social burden
— the man doesn't. A female is
born with biological inequity
— again, only she bears the
burden. If the man chooses not
to help, women's problems are
compounded.
Some might counter this
with "So what? Human life is
beautiful and sacred, and once
it gets going, a woman should
be able to keep it going. The
life that has been created is
more important than either
harm to her social standing, fi
nancial circumstances, or a po
tentially bad future for the
child. If the fetus could speak it
would agree."
This argument fails to look at
life with a biological perspec
tive. Life started millions of
years ago and hasn't stopped
yet. Our lives are links in a long
chain of events and processes.

Life cycles have two parts.
Adults are only one phase, sex
cells are another. They are as
alive as we are. Life doesn't
begin at conception, and de
velopment of an individual
doesn't stop at birth.
I'm not saying that the dip
loid individual is unimportant;
as a species and as a society we
devote a huge amount of
energy and time to creating an
adult who is able to reproduce.
I would like to suggest that be
cause of this very investment,
an adult life deserves perhaps
more concern than that of the
fetus.
When women commit
suicide and risk their lives with
illegal procedures because of
the twin burdens created by
social and biological in
equities, and we have the
power and ability to change
this fate, it is our obligation to
let the woman have the right to
choose life.
The fetus that is aborted may
have had a potential, but it may
also be viewed as a cancerous
growth or parasite by the
woman who hates it due to the
extremely powerful effect it
has on her life. No wonder we
go to such extremes to find a
cure. Does a malignant tumor
have a right to life? I claim that
the adult has a right to life too.
Moreover economic dispar
ity unfairly harms poor wo
men's lives but rich women es
cape unscathed. It is impera
tive that we correct this. Men
and rich women must recog
nize a poor woman's right to
life.
I see abortion rights as rights
to life and would like to see a
unified effort to ensure them
for all women.
