# Board of Trustees to consider investment recommendations
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The first of the year's proxy re
ferenda concerning University social
responsibility in investments will
come before the Board of Trustees
today.
Seventeen different proxy ques
tions affecting 11 corporations will
be considered by the full board at its
meeting in Los Angeles today.
The proxy issues were transmitted
to the board's Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility Saturday
by the University Committee on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) along
with CIR recommendations on what
action the trustees should take.
The proxy proposals in question
deal with issues concerning social
responsibility in investment. In the
past, many of these issues have dealt
with investment by corporations in
South Africa.
South Africa
This year's first set of proxy issues
included three South African in
vestment issues, according to CIR
Chairman Frederick Hillier.
Hillier, a professor of operations

research, said trustee select commit
tee members met with the CIR on
campus Saturday, and he said trus
tees were "responsive" to the CIR
recommendations. "There were in
dications that they (the trustees)
would be giving very serious consid
eration to adopting our (the ClR's)
position on most of the issues," Hill
ier said yesterday.
The select committee met yester
day in Los Angeles, and the results of
that meeting will be presented to the
full board at its meeting today.
Among issues to be considered is a
Caterpillar Tractor Company re
ferendum calling for the company to
establish a committee to review
whether Caterpillar products could
be used by South African police or
other authorities to oppress South
African citizens. The CIR recom
mended the trustees vote against the
proposal, Hillier said.
Wells Fargo loans
The other South Africa-related is
sues would prohibit both the Bank of
America and Wells Fargo Bank from
extending new loans or renewing old
loans to the South African govern
ment. The CIR recommended a posi
tive vote on both issues.
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)
shareholders will consider two is
suesdealingwith nuclear power. The
first calls for conversion of the Diablo
Canyon nuclear power plant from a
nuclear facility to a solar or wind
energy plant. The CIR recommended
voting against this because the
"committee felt it wasn't feasible" to
convert to solar or wind power, Hill
ier said.
A second PC&E proposal calls for
"a moratorium on nuclear power
plants for PG&E." The CIR recom
mended abstention because the
wording was unclear. Hillier said the
committee didn't know whether the
issues would have PG&E stop build
ing new plants or shut down nuclear
plants presently in operation.

Three proposals calling for the es
tablishment of review boards to de
velop a more responsible policy on
promotion and distribution of infant
formula to underdeveloped coun
tries were also forwarded to trustees.
The CIR recommended the trus
tees vote against two proposals put
to shareholders of DuPont Corpora
tion which would direct the company
to halt support to schools or organi
zations which "employ avowed
communists, Leninists, Marxists or
Maoists."
A third DuPont issue would dis
courage grants to schools which
prohibit employees from engaging in
covert activities for the CIA. The CIR
also recommended a "no" vote on
this issue, Hillier said.
The CIR also sent trustees recom
mendations to vote "yes" on Wells
Fargo Bank and Chase Manhattan
Bank proposals which would pro
hibit loans to the present govern
ment in Chile.
Other proxies
The trustees were also given a
Bank of America proxy calling for the
company to release information on
loans and perquisites to officers and
directors of the company. The CIR
made no recommendation on this is
sue, leaving it for the trustees to de
cide.
The CIR gave trustees, also without
recommendation, proposals from
Bristol-Myers, U.S. Steel and Gen
eral Electric calling forthe companies
to compile details on former gov
ernment officials who are now with
the companies.
Finally, the CIR recommended that
trustees send a letter to the com
panies explaining the University ac
tion when the University has voted
against the management position.
Hillier said the full text of the re
port given to trustees Saturday will
be released today. Fie said the report
details the CIR reasoning behind its
recommendations.

A second PC&E proposal calls for
"a moratorium on nuclear power
plants for PG&E." The CIR recom
mended abstention because the
wording was unclear. Hillier said the
committee didn't know whether the
issues would have PG&E stop build
ing new plants or shut down nuclear
plants presently in operation.

Three proposals calling for the es
tablishment of review boards to de
velop a more responsible policy on
promotion and distribution of infant
formula to underdeveloped coun
tries were also forwarded to trustees.
The CIR recommended the trus
tees vote against two proposals put
to shareholders of DuPont Corpora
tion which would direct the company
to halt support to schools or organi
zations which "employ avowed
communists, Leninists, Marxists or
Maoists."
A third DuPont issue would dis
courage grants to schools which
prohibit employees from engaging in
covert activities for the CIA. The CIR
also recommended a "no" vote on
this issue, Hillier said.
The CIR also sent trustees recom
mendations to vote "yes" on Wells
Fargo Bank and Chase Manhattan
Bank proposals which would pro
hibit loans to the present govern
ment in Chile.
Other proxies
The trustees were also given a
Bank of America proxy calling for the
company to release information on
loans and perquisites to officers and
directors of the company. The CIR
made no recommendation on this is
sue, leaving it for the trustees to de
cide.
The CIR gave trustees, also without
recommendation, proposals from
Bristol-Myers, U.S. Steel and Gen
eral Electric calling forthe companies
to compile details on former gov
ernment officials who are now with
the companies.
Finally, the CIR recommended that
trustees send a letter to the com
panies explaining the University ac
tion when the University has voted
against the management position.
Hillier said the full text of the re
port given to trustees Saturday will
be released today. Fie said the report
details the CIR reasoning behind its
recommendations.
The first of the year's proxy re
ferenda concerning University social
responsibility in investments will
come before the Board of Trustees
today.
Seventeen different proxy ques
tions affecting 11 corporations will
be considered by the full board at its
meeting in Los Angeles today.
The proxy issues were transmitted
to the board's Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility Saturday
by the University Committee on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) along
with CIR recommendations on what
action the trustees should take.
The proxy proposals in question
deal with issues concerning social
responsibility in investment. In the
past, many of these issues have dealt
with investment by corporations in
South Africa.
South Africa
This year's first set of proxy issues
included three South African in
vestment issues, according to CIR
Chairman Frederick Hillier.
Hillier, a professor of operations

research, said trustee select commit
tee members met with the CIR on
campus Saturday, and he said trus
tees were "responsive" to the CIR
recommendations. "There were in
dications that they (the trustees)
would be giving very serious consid
eration to adopting our (the ClR's)
position on most of the issues," Hill
ier said yesterday.
The select committee met yester
day in Los Angeles, and the results of
that meeting will be presented to the
full board at its meeting today.
Among issues to be considered is a
Caterpillar Tractor Company re
ferendum calling for the company to
establish a committee to review
whether Caterpillar products could
be used by South African police or
other authorities to oppress South
African citizens. The CIR recom
mended the trustees vote against the
proposal, Hillier said.
Wells Fargo loans
The other South Africa-related is
sues would prohibit both the Bank of
America and Wells Fargo Bank from
extending new loans or renewing old
loans to the South African govern
ment. The CIR recommended a posi
tive vote on both issues.
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)
shareholders will consider two is
suesdealingwith nuclear power. The
first calls for conversion of the Diablo
Canyon nuclear power plant from a
nuclear facility to a solar or wind
energy plant. The CIR recommended
voting against this because the
"committee felt it wasn't feasible" to
convert to solar or wind power, Hill
ier said.
A second PC&E proposal calls for
"a moratorium on nuclear power
plants for PG&E." The CIR recom
mended abstention because the
wording was unclear. Hillier said the
committee didn't know whether the
issues would have PG&E stop build
ing new plants or shut down nuclear
plants presently in operation.
