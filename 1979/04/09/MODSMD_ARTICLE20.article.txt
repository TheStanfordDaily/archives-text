# Alcohol stimulates cars rather than people
## 
### 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (AP) —
Brazil wants its cars to run on
alcohol made from home
grown sugar cane instead of on
gasoline made from imported
oil. This could allow the fast
industrializing nation to es
cape from the economic
domination of the OPEC oil
cartel.
There are critics, though,
who say the country's much
heralded alcohol conversion
plan is not ambitious enough
and the military-run govern
ment really hasn't gotten seri
ous about alcohol power.
Under an alcohol program
that began in 1975, the annual
alcohol production here has
increased from 160 million gal
lons to nearly 700 million gal
lons, with a 1 billion-gallon
jump forecast for next year.
The government oil
monopoly, Petrobras, is ad
ding alcohol in steadily increas
ing amounts to the gasoline it
distributes throughout the
country, thereby making im

ported crude oil "stretch."
More than 700 cars in Brazil
— ranging from the official
limousine of the governor of
the southern state of Parana to
the repair fleet of the phone
company in Sao Paulo, the na
tion's largest city— now run on
pure alcohol. There are plans
to increase the number of all
alcohol vehicles to 10,000.
Run just as well
Drivers of alcohol cars say
they run just as well as on
gasoline and that sometimes
they get better mileage and
less engine wear.
A typical car engine can op
erate on gasoline diluted with
20 percent alcohol without
need for major modification.
Technicians have developed
techniques for converting a
small gasoline engine — that of
a Volkswagen "Beetle," for
example — to run on 100 per
cent alcohol by making 40 easy
and inexpensive adjustments
and parts changes.
The critics, however, point

out that Brazil now imports al
most 85 percent of the nearly 1
million barrels a day of crude
oil it uses and that this year's
oil-import bill will be a record,
more than $5 billion.
They also note that Brazilians
are driving more cars than ever
before, with annual produc
tion here now above the 1 mill
ion mark.
Alcohol supporters argue
that the government should
pour massive resources into
this fuel, raising production to
8 billion gallons a year. They
say plans should call for the
conversion of millions — not
just thousands — of Brazilian
cars. About one-fourth of all
the oil Brazil imports is used for
making gasoline for passenger
cars.
Research supported
Brazil's new president, Joao
Baptista Figueiredo, a retired
army general who took office
in March for a six-year term,
has promised to "intensify"
the alcohol program and to

support alcohol research.
But he also has pledged to
back increased domestic oil
prospecting — despite the fact
that Petrobras now spends a
record $1.5 billion a year to dril I
wells at home but has been un
able to increase output.
One of the most persistent
critics of Brazil's alcohol prog
ram is Jaime Rotstein, head of a
iarge Rio-based engineering
firm. "It's very simple. Brazil
has hardly any oil. It could have
lots of alcohol," says Rotstein,
who has just written a book,
Alcohol - An Agenda for the
Present.
Slow process
Rotstein says Brazil's alcohol
program is "slow and unam
bitious," and he sees the cur
rent OPEC oil price increases
as "a declaration of war from a
powerful foreign enemy." He
says Brazil could become "a
world leader in renewable
sources of energy — im
mediately."
Brazil is the world's biggest

sugar cane grower, and for
generations sugar mills here
have been producing alcohol
for a cheap and popular rum
like drink. Brazil also is No. 1 in
cassava root, a plant that can be
made to yield alcohol. And the
country has vast amounts of
idle farmland that could be
used for alcohol-producing
crops.
And Antonio Evaldo Inojosa,
the president of a large sugar
growers' cooperative near Rio,
says: "If the government really
wants to solve the energy prog
ram, it should invest in al
cohol." He claims Brazil could
produce enough alcohol to run
all its cars by spending $15 bill
ion — about three years' worth
of oil imports at today's prices.
To unravel bureaucratic
tangles that now surround
Brazil's alcohol conversion
program, alcohol boosters
propose the creation of a cen
tralized agency to implement
alcohol policy.

cassava root, a plant that can be
made to yield alcohol. And the

idle farmland that could be
used for alcohol-producing
crops.

the president of a large sugar

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (AP) —
Brazil wants its cars to run on
alcohol made from home
grown sugar cane instead of on
gasoline made from imported
oil. This could allow the fast
industrializing nation to es
cape from the economic
domination of the OPEC oil
cartel.
There are critics, though,
who say the country's much
heralded alcohol conversion
plan is not ambitious enough
and the military-run govern
ment really hasn't gotten seri
ous about alcohol power.
Under an alcohol program
that began in 1975, the annual
alcohol production here has
increased from 160 million gal
lons to nearly 700 million gal
lons, with a 1 billion-gallon
jump forecast for next year.
The government oil
monopoly, Petrobras, is ad
ding alcohol in steadily increas
ing amounts to the gasoline it
distributes throughout the
country, thereby making im

ported crude oil "stretch."
More than 700 cars in Brazil
— ranging from the official
limousine of the governor of
the southern state of Parana to
the repair fleet of the phone
company in Sao Paulo, the na
tion's largest city— now run on
pure alcohol. There are plans
to increase the number of all
alcohol vehicles to 10,000.
Run just as well
Drivers of alcohol cars say
they run just as well as on
gasoline and that sometimes
they get better mileage and
less engine wear.
A typical car engine can op
erate on gasoline diluted with
20 percent alcohol without
need for major modification.
Technicians have developed
techniques for converting a
small gasoline engine — that of
a Volkswagen "Beetle," for
example — to run on 100 per
cent alcohol by making 40 easy
and inexpensive adjustments
and parts changes.
The critics, however, point

out that Brazil now imports al
most 85 percent of the nearly 1
million barrels a day of crude
oil it uses and that this year's
oil-import bill will be a record,
more than $5 billion.
They also note that Brazilians
are driving more cars than ever
before, with annual produc
tion here now above the 1 mill
ion mark.
Alcohol supporters argue
that the government should
pour massive resources into
this fuel, raising production to
8 billion gallons a year. They
say plans should call for the
conversion of millions — not
just thousands — of Brazilian
cars. About one-fourth of all
the oil Brazil imports is used for
making gasoline for passenger
cars.
Research supported
Brazil's new president, Joao
Baptista Figueiredo, a retired
army general who took office
in March for a six-year term,
has promised to "intensify"
the alcohol program and to

support alcohol research.
But he also has pledged to
back increased domestic oil
prospecting — despite the fact
that Petrobras now spends a
record $1.5 billion a year to dril I
wells at home but has been un
able to increase output.
One of the most persistent
critics of Brazil's alcohol prog
ram is Jaime Rotstein, head of a
iarge Rio-based engineering
firm. "It's very simple. Brazil
has hardly any oil. It could have
lots of alcohol," says Rotstein,
who has just written a book,
Alcohol - An Agenda for the
Present.
Slow process
Rotstein says Brazil's alcohol
program is "slow and unam
bitious," and he sees the cur
rent OPEC oil price increases
as "a declaration of war from a
powerful foreign enemy." He
says Brazil could become "a
world leader in renewable
sources of energy — im
mediately."
Brazil is the world's biggest

sugar cane grower, and for
generations sugar mills here
have been producing alcohol
for a cheap and popular rum
like drink. Brazil also is No. 1 in
