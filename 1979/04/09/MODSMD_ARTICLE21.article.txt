# Netters defeat Arizona, ASU
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's men's tennis team
survived a doubles test against
Arizona to defeat the Wildcats
6-3. On Friday the Cards
started slow, at one time trail
ing in five of the six singles
matches, but once on track had
no trouble with Arizona State,

trouncing them, 8-1.
Against Arizona the Cards
split the six singles matches,
leaving the outcome of the
dual match dependent upon
the doubles. However, the
Cards were equal to the test
and passed with flying colors.

Scott Bondurant, bothered
by a sore shoulder, had trou
bles serving but had no trouble
angling volleys off for winners.
He teamed with Tim Mayotte
and they routinely won the
second doubles match 6-3,6-2.
In the most entertaining
doubles match of the day, the
emotional team of Jim Hodges
and Jeff Arons teamed for the
third doubles victory 6-2,6-4.
Hodges and Arons, playing an
aggressive net game, won the
first five games of the first set
before cruising to the first set
victory and in the ninth game
of the second set broke service
and then Arons served out the
match.
Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne completed the doubles
sweep with a three-set win at
the first doubles slot 4-6, 6-3,
6-2.
"Peter did a real good job
this weekend,'' said Stanford
coach Dick Gould. "He really
looked like a player out there."
Lloyd Bourne, who out
steadied Eric Sherbeck of ASU
Friday 6-3, 6-2, had his hands
full with the big forehand of
Andy Cordon of Arizona and as
Could commented was just
"outplayed'by Cordon 6-7,
6-4, 6-3
The match was marred by a
rash of questionable calls by
both players, causing play to
be interrupted several times as
both players tried to negotiate
the calls their way.
Tim Mayotte survived slow
starts both days but really
poured it on at the finish and
ended the weekend unde
feated in both singles and
doubles.
Jim Hodges also went unde
feated for the weekend.
Hodges, who Could described
as "a winner" took three sets
against ASU's Archie Bouwer,
but easily defeated Billy Moss
of Arizona on Saturday.
Arons did not lose a
game Friday against Mike Car
ruthers, but Saturday against
Tim Ma rein he was a little tenta
tive on the big points.
"Jeff's going to be a tough
player," said Could. "Friday he
kept the pressure on through
out the match. Saturday, how

ever, he played a player who
got a lot more balls back and he
played a little scared on the key
points."
The Cards continued to be
held back by injuries. John Rast
who still lacks the competitive
edge, having played seven
months, dropped the lone
Stanford match to ASU, a 7-6,
6-2 decision, to Tim Anderson.
Rast, however, had his back
tighten up on him and was un
able to take part in Saturday's
match.
Bondurant, who sat out Fri
day's match, played Saturday
but was definitely hampered
by his sore shoulder. Bondur
ant was only able to hold serve
once in the match and despite
breaking serve six times in two
sets, dropped the match.
"We're still having health
problems but I'm still pleased
with our performance so far,"
stated Could. "It was good to
see our doubles come through
when it counted. Last week we
played three teams in the top
15 and we did well against all of
them. We're getting better
every time we step on the
court. But we can play better
and we'll have to play better to
beat who I consider the No. 1
and 2 teams, USC and UCLA."
USC defeated UCLA in a dual
match Friday 5-4. The Cards
travel to Southern California
this weekend to play USC Fri
day and UCLA Saturday.

Lloyd Bourne, who out
steadied Eric Sherbeck of ASU
Friday 6-3, 6-2, had his hands
full with the big forehand of
Andy Cordon of Arizona and as
Could commented was just
"outplayed'by Cordon 6-7,
6-4, 6-3
The match was marred by a
rash of questionable calls by
both players, causing play to
be interrupted several times as
both players tried to negotiate
the calls their way.
Tim Mayotte survived slow
starts both days but really
poured it on at the finish and
ended the weekend unde
feated in both singles and
doubles.
Jim Hodges also went unde
feated for the weekend.
Hodges, who Could described
as "a winner" took three sets
against ASU's Archie Bouwer,
but easily defeated Billy Moss
of Arizona on Saturday.
Arons did not lose a
game Friday against Mike Car
ruthers, but Saturday against
Tim Ma rein he was a little tenta
tive on the big points.
"Jeff's going to be a tough
player," said Could. "Friday he
kept the pressure on through
out the match. Saturday, how

ever, he played a player who
got a lot more balls back and he
played a little scared on the key
points."
The Cards continued to be
held back by injuries. John Rast
who still lacks the competitive
edge, having played seven
months, dropped the lone
Stanford match to ASU, a 7-6,
6-2 decision, to Tim Anderson.
Rast, however, had his back
tighten up on him and was un
able to take part in Saturday's
match.
Bondurant, who sat out Fri
day's match, played Saturday
but was definitely hampered
by his sore shoulder. Bondur
ant was only able to hold serve
once in the match and despite
breaking serve six times in two
sets, dropped the match.
"We're still having health
problems but I'm still pleased
with our performance so far,"
stated Could. "It was good to
see our doubles come through
when it counted. Last week we
played three teams in the top
15 and we did well against all of
them. We're getting better
every time we step on the
court. But we can play better
and we'll have to play better to
beat who I consider the No. 1
and 2 teams, USC and UCLA."
USC defeated UCLA in a dual
match Friday 5-4. The Cards
travel to Southern California
this weekend to play USC Fri
day and UCLA Saturday.

Stanford's men's tennis team
survived a doubles test against
Arizona to defeat the Wildcats
6-3. On Friday the Cards
started slow, at one time trail
ing in five of the six singles
matches, but once on track had
no trouble with Arizona State,

trouncing them, 8-1.
Against Arizona the Cards
split the six singles matches,
leaving the outcome of the
dual match dependent upon
the doubles. However, the
Cards were equal to the test
and passed with flying colors.

Scott Bondurant, bothered
by a sore shoulder, had trou
bles serving but had no trouble
angling volleys off for winners.
He teamed with Tim Mayotte
and they routinely won the
second doubles match 6-3,6-2.
In the most entertaining
doubles match of the day, the
emotional team of Jim Hodges
and Jeff Arons teamed for the
third doubles victory 6-2,6-4.
Hodges and Arons, playing an
aggressive net game, won the
first five games of the first set
before cruising to the first set
victory and in the ninth game
of the second set broke service
and then Arons served out the
match.
Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne completed the doubles
sweep with a three-set win at
the first doubles slot 4-6, 6-3,
6-2.
"Peter did a real good job
this weekend,'' said Stanford
coach Dick Gould. "He really
looked like a player out there."
