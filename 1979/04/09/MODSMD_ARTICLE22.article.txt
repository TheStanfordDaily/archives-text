# Women defeated in So. Cal play
## 
### Steve Pearson 
Stanford's women's tennis team knew that their consecutive
away matches at UCLA and USC would be tough. The Cardinals'
Southern California rivals have perennially strong teams, particu
larly hard to beat at home. When Stanford's women returned this
weekend on the losing end of two closely fought matches, they
realized the hard work in front of them.
In the doubles, Stanford's Kathy Jordan and Alycia Moulton
defeated Dana Gilbert and Lucy Gordon of UCLA 6-4, 6-2, while
their teammates Donna Rubin and Sue Rasmussen were losing to
Bruins Liz Stalder and Shannon Gordon 6-1, 6-4. Still in conten
tion was the No. 2 doubles match between Cardinals Susie Hagey
and Diane Morrison and UCLA's Kathy O'Brien and Becky Bell.
The match went three sets, and in the last few games darkness
nearly forced a halt from play. And then it was over. Morrison
netted a backhand volley that gave O'Brien and Bell a 6-3,4-6, 7-5
victory, and the ecstatic UCLA team the match at 5-4.
Saturday the Cardinals had to pull themselves together to face
the No. 1 ranked team in the nation, USC. Featured in this match
was the confrontation of USC's Stacy Margolin and Stanford's
Jordan. Rated 21st and 22nd in women's tennis respectively,
Margolin and Jordan are the top two amateurs in the world, and
the best of the collegiate ranks.
Their match was all that it was supposed to be. Maintaining an
exceptionally high level of tennis throughout, both players bat
tled each other through serve and volley, lobbing long points
from the baseline. Momentum shifted time and again, but Jor
dan, who had had problems serving all day, was broken at 4-5 in
the final set, relinquishing a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory to Margolin.
At the end of the singles competition USC had a 5-1 lead and
had already clenched the team victory.
Particularly encouraging was the play of freshman Moulton,
who won two singles and two doubles matches without a loss.
Gould said, "Alycia really played well this weekend. It's tough
for freshmen to come in and play such high-powered and pres
sured matches. She did a beautiful job."
Stanford looks forward to rematches with USC on April 21 and
UCLA on May 11, both at Stanford. The women resume match
play tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. against USF at the Stanford courts.

Stanford's women's tennis team knew that their consecutive
away matches at UCLA and USC would be tough. The Cardinals'
Southern California rivals have perennially strong teams, particu
larly hard to beat at home. When Stanford's women returned this
weekend on the losing end of two closely fought matches, they
realized the hard work in front of them.
In the doubles, Stanford's Kathy Jordan and Alycia Moulton
defeated Dana Gilbert and Lucy Gordon of UCLA 6-4, 6-2, while
their teammates Donna Rubin and Sue Rasmussen were losing to
Bruins Liz Stalder and Shannon Gordon 6-1, 6-4. Still in conten
tion was the No. 2 doubles match between Cardinals Susie Hagey
and Diane Morrison and UCLA's Kathy O'Brien and Becky Bell.
The match went three sets, and in the last few games darkness
nearly forced a halt from play. And then it was over. Morrison
netted a backhand volley that gave O'Brien and Bell a 6-3,4-6, 7-5
victory, and the ecstatic UCLA team the match at 5-4.
Saturday the Cardinals had to pull themselves together to face
the No. 1 ranked team in the nation, USC. Featured in this match
was the confrontation of USC's Stacy Margolin and Stanford's
Jordan. Rated 21st and 22nd in women's tennis respectively,
Margolin and Jordan are the top two amateurs in the world, and
the best of the collegiate ranks.
Their match was all that it was supposed to be. Maintaining an
exceptionally high level of tennis throughout, both players bat
tled each other through serve and volley, lobbing long points
from the baseline. Momentum shifted time and again, but Jor
dan, who had had problems serving all day, was broken at 4-5 in
the final set, relinquishing a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory to Margolin.
At the end of the singles competition USC had a 5-1 lead and
had already clenched the team victory.
Particularly encouraging was the play of freshman Moulton,
who won two singles and two doubles matches without a loss.
Gould said, "Alycia really played well this weekend. It's tough
for freshmen to come in and play such high-powered and pres
sured matches. She did a beautiful job."
Stanford looks forward to rematches with USC on April 21 and
UCLA on May 11, both at Stanford. The women resume match
play tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. against USF at the Stanford courts.
