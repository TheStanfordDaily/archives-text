Two visitors from the south, USC and UCLA,
trounced Stanford and Cal in a double dual meet
in Edwards Stadium at Cal Saturday. Stanford fell
105-43 to USC and Cal lost to UCLA, 86-68.
For Stanford it was a day of adjustments. Five
consistent performers (Darrin Nelson, Robert
Maiocco, Larry Harris, Brian Holloway and Rick
Gervais) are out, three due to injury and two
others due to spring football training.
"It hurt us not having them, naturally," said
Stanford coach Payton Jordan. "But we did what
we could, moved some people around, and
tried to make things hold together. The team
fought every inch of the way and I'm proud."
The highlight of the meet was the longest run
of the day, the 5000-meters. A group of four
outstanding runners traded the lead for most of
the race. Stanford's Bill Gail and Rod Berry were
amongst the four, with Cal runner Gary Blume
and Vicken Simonian of UCLA alongside.
With 800 meters to go, both Simonian and Gail
began to produce what appeared to be the
necessary kick to win but with slightly less than
400 left, Gary Blume fired away from the pack at
a sprint. The Cal fans went wild and cheered
Blume to victory and a 14:23.2 effort.
"I knew I had enough to take it but I didn't
know I had that much," said Blume. "I was in
spired by the cheering; it's neat, I can't believe
it."

Blume was also victorious forCal in the steep
lechase. Shortly after he completed the barrier
ridden 3000-meter run in 9:00.4, he jogged to his
home a few blocks away to change into dry
clothes for the 5000.
Bill Haldeman defeated the USC runner in the
steeple to collect first place points for Stanford.
John Schaer won the 1500 meter run in 3:48.3
with Stanford teammate Roy Kissin close behind
for second.
Another strong Stanford finish came in the
high jump, an event that not long ago was a sore
spot for the team. Second and third place points
were taken by Sean Winterer and Kent Doyle,
who both cleared 6-foot-2.
Hurdler and sprinter Ken Margerum survived
a 100-meter dash that took four tries to start
correctly only to lose narrowly to USC's Colin
Bradford. Clay Bullwinkle and Kurt Roessler
picked up second and third, respectively, in the
triple jump for Stanford. First was USC's Dan
Jackson with a mark of 4-foot-11'/4.
When asked if the day's results might create a
morale problem for Stanford at the upcoming
San lose Relays (April 14), Jordan replied with
confidence.
"We have no morale problem," he said.
"None at all. These are some of the best (track
teams) anywhere. No, we don't have to hang our
heads after this one."
