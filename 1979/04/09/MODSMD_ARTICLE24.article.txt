# Spikers outvolleyed by SB Gauchos

Santa Barbara — Down in
Santa Barbara, volleyball is
more than just a game. For
here, in this sun-drenched col
lege town, volleyball matches
are major social happenings,
where post-game parties are
announced during the
matches.
But despite the numerous
parties and the refreshing dis
play of pulchritude, the major
ity of UCSB students crowd
Robertson Gym for one
reason. As one girl remarked,
"We're here to see our boys
play ball."
UCSB's "boys" added to the
festivities in Saturday night's
match with Stanford by sweep
ing the Cardinals 15-10, 15-8
and 15-9.
Blessed with depth, talent
and experience, UCSB coach
Ken Preston shuttled in fresh

Gauchos at the slightest hint of
fatigue.
Said one knowledgeable fan,
"UCSB has 12 good players.
They are so good that their
second team often beats the
first team in practice."
But road-weary Stanford had
no such depth Saturday night.
Their playing ranks thinned by
traveling limitations and an un
timely injury, the Cardinals ran
out of steam midway through
the second game, dashing
their hopes for an upset.
With Stanford leading 4-3 in
that second game, Card middle
blocker Rod Fletcher landed
on the foot of UCSB's Dave
Lundin. Fletcher fell to the
floor with a grimace, having
severely sprained his ankle,
and was lost for the rest of the
match.
"Rod's injury wasn't the only
reason we lost," said Stanford
coach Fred Sturm, "but it was

definitely a factor."
Sturm then began a series of
substitutions, trying to find a
winning combination.
Sturm lauded the set selec
tion of freshman Kip Engen,
who tried in vain to spark the
Stanford squad.'
Sturm also praised the play
of substitutes Dave Carico and
Don Brewster.
Carico brought Stanford
back from a 9-0 deficit to 11-9 in
the third game with steady all
around play. His vicious top
spin serve produced the only
Stanford ace of the night and
several fine digs kept Stanford
going in the third game.
Brewster, Fletcher's re
placement, was faced with the
difficult task of stopping
UCSB's middle attack and was
the most effective Card in that
respect. But such success was
limited.
UCSB middle blocker Glen

Duvall completely dominated
the net, both with his blocking
and hitting. The 6-foot*-3
Gaucho consistently pounded
Scott Steele's quick shoot-sets
and was extremely effective
blocking, as he soared even
above the hitting reach of 6-7
Card Rich Yardley.
The brief road trip started on
a sour note Friday, as the Cards
ran into another tough Califor
nia Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association (CIVA) foe in Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo.
The Mustangs, currently in
fourth place behind Santa Bar
bara, kept pace with the
Gauchos by dumping Stanford
15-10, 15-6 and 16-14.
The pair of defeats dropped
Stanford to a 3-11 season re
cord, and play will continue
this weekend when Stanford
hosts No. 1-ranked UCLA and
defending NCAA champion
Pepperdine.
