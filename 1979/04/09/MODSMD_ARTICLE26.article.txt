### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
demolished the California
Golden Bears 12-4 in the sec
ond game of Saturday's
double-header to claim a sec
ond win in the three-game
series with the cross-bay rivals.
Stanford won the Friday af
ternoon opener 4-2 in 10 in
nings at Berkeley's Evans Field,
but lost the first game of the
twinbill played the following
day at Sunken Diamond, 4-1.
"We wanted to take all three
games," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess, "but
this is the first series we've won
. . . I'm happy with that."
Until this past weekend, the
Cardinals had failed to take
more than one game from any
of their Pacific-10 Southern Di
vision opponents. Now half
way through the 30-game
league schedule, the Cards
hold a 5-9 record in league play
and are 22-13 overall.
Friday's game was a pitchers'
duel between |oe LoPresti,
senior left hander on the Car
dinal staff and Brian Duffy,
junior left handerand two-year
letterman at California.
Both pitchers worked the en
tire 10 innings, refusing to yield
to relievers who were up and
down in both bullpens
throughout the game.
Stanford fell behind when
the Bears scored once in the
fifth inning. Left fielder Don
Driscoll followed lead-off bat
ter Greg Thys' two-out single

with an RBI double hit deep
into center field.
Duffy held on to Cal's 1-0
lead through the next four in
nings, giving up only one hit to
the restless Cardinals, but
freshman Mike Toothman

broke Duffy's rhythm in the
top of the ninth.
Toothman tripled to center
to start off what could have
been Stanford's last at-bat.
Larry Reynolds followed with a
clutch single to right field scor
ing Billy Casey who was pinch

running for Toothman.
A ground out and double
play got Duffy out of the inning
with Stanford having scored
only once. But the Cards knew
that victory was within their
reach, and that a win would be

the only way to quiet the Cal
rooters who had become quite
noisy once the keg ran dry
halfway through the game.
LoPresti knuckled down and
retired the side in the bottom
of the ninth, allowing no runs
(in spite of two Stanford errors)

thanks to a diving stop by sec
ond baseman Paul Zuvella.
All nine of Stanford's batters
came to the plate in the first
half of the tenth.
Catcher Bruce Walters led
off with a double that rattled

Duffy and the other Cal fiel
ders. )ohn Pyle then hit into a
lielders' choice removing the
lead runner, but a Cal error and
an infield hit loaded the bases.
Duffy walked the next batter,
Reynolds, giving him a gift RBI
and the Cardinals a 2-1 lead.

With the bases still loaded, Phil
Wilson hit a ground ball that
took a timely hop over the
shortstop's head and scored
two more runs for Stanford.
Cal first baseman Kelly
Wood, the first batter in the
last half of the extra inning,
knocked LoPresti's third pitch
out of the ballpark over the left
field fence. The score became
4-2, but that was all the Bears
would get.
The loss on Saturday dam
pened Bruce Fiala's impressive
season record to 7-3. "Bruce
pitched a good game," said
Marquess, "we just couldn't
hit the ball."
Fiala battled the Bears
through eight innings before
Paul Grame stepped in for one
strong inning of relief. The
Bears chipped away at Hala,
scattering nine hits and earn
ing four runs in the contest.
The Cards managed seven
hits off Cal starter Dave
)ohnson, but scored only once
while stranding six men.
In the final game of the
series, the two teams com
bined used eight pitchers. The
five Cal pitchers gave up 10
walks, as did the three for Sta
nford. But the Cards' seven hits
along with the Bears' three er
rors gave Stanford its 12 runs.
Stanford's three four-run in
nings provided Cardinal fans
with something to cheer about
in between lulls in the action
tor pitching changes.
Meanwhile, in the southern
half of the state, UCLA swept a
three-game series from last
year's NCAA baseball champ
ion USC. Thp Bruins now lead
the division with a handsome
10-3 record. USC is now even,
showing seven wins against as
many losses.

junior left handerand two-year
letterman at California.
Both pitchers worked the en
tire 10 innings, refusing to yield
to relievers who were up and
down in both bullpens
throughout the game.
Stanford fell behind when
the Bears scored once in the
fifth inning. Left fielder Don
Driscoll followed lead-off bat
ter Greg Thys' two-out single

with an RBI double hit deep
into center field.
Duffy held on to Cal's 1-0
lead through the next four in
nings, giving up only one hit to
the restless Cardinals, but
freshman Mike Toothman

broke Duffy's rhythm in the
top of the ninth.
Toothman tripled to center
to start off what could have
been Stanford's last at-bat.
Larry Reynolds followed with a
clutch single to right field scor
ing Billy Casey who was pinch

running for Toothman.
A ground out and double
play got Duffy out of the inning
with Stanford having scored
only once. But the Cards knew
that victory was within their
reach, and that a win would be

the only way to quiet the Cal
rooters who had become quite
noisy once the keg ran dry
halfway through the game.
LoPresti knuckled down and
retired the side in the bottom
of the ninth, allowing no runs
(in spite of two Stanford errors)

thanks to a diving stop by sec
ond baseman Paul Zuvella.
All nine of Stanford's batters
came to the plate in the first
half of the tenth.
Catcher Bruce Walters led
off with a double that rattled

Duffy and the other Cal fiel
ders. )ohn Pyle then hit into a
lielders' choice removing the
lead runner, but a Cal error and
an infield hit loaded the bases.
Duffy walked the next batter,
Reynolds, giving him a gift RBI
and the Cardinals a 2-1 lead.

With the bases still loaded, Phil
Wilson hit a ground ball that
took a timely hop over the
shortstop's head and scored
two more runs for Stanford.
Cal first baseman Kelly
Wood, the first batter in the
last half of the extra inning,
knocked LoPresti's third pitch
out of the ballpark over the left
field fence. The score became
4-2, but that was all the Bears
would get.
The loss on Saturday dam
pened Bruce Fiala's impressive
season record to 7-3. "Bruce
pitched a good game," said
Marquess, "we just couldn't
hit the ball."
Fiala battled the Bears
through eight innings before
Paul Grame stepped in for one
strong inning of relief. The
Bears chipped away at Hala,
scattering nine hits and earn
ing four runs in the contest.
The Cards managed seven
hits off Cal starter Dave
)ohnson, but scored only once
while stranding six men.
In the final game of the
series, the two teams com
bined used eight pitchers. The
five Cal pitchers gave up 10
walks, as did the three for Sta
nford. But the Cards' seven hits
along with the Bears' three er
rors gave Stanford its 12 runs.
Stanford's three four-run in

The Stanford baseball team
demolished the California
Golden Bears 12-4 in the sec

Until this past weekend, the
Cardinals had failed to take
more than one game from any

league schedule, the Cards
hold a 5-9 record in league play
and are 22-13 overall.
