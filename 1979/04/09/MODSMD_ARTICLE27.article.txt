The women's track team competed in a meet, "like the Nation
als," at the University of California at Berkeley yesterday, accord
ing to assistant coach Ron Grayson. "The girls ran well, but they
were up against fantastic competition," he said.
Squads from Arizona State, California College at Los Angeles,
Cal State-Northridge, Cal and UCLA, possibly the top five wo
men's track teams in the nation, participated in the meet, so
"they saw some good competition," Grayson said in reference to
his team's experience.
The Cards did not score any points, but they recorded some
best performances anyway. Sophomore Andrea Cheek ran a 61.1,
the best time for any Cardinal runner this year, in an unseeded
heat of the 400-meters.
The 400-meter relay set a new school record off of Denise
Torrey's under-13-second anchor leg. Sprinters Torrey, Leslie
Turner and Deena Martinez returned from the injured list to post
improved times. Considering that the utilized electronic device

substantially slows down a sprint event, their times were espe
cially notable.
Meg Gardner ran the 800-meters in 2: JO, and Susan Bragdon
and Carolyn Layzer notched times of 4:54 and 5:09 respectively
against the wind in the 500.
Grayson classified the mile-relay team's showing as "respecta
ble."
In the field, Hillary Hall continued to consistently long jump
with an effort of 15-fooMO'i. Sophomore Colleen Dolan, the
Cards' sole weight performer is suffering from a sore arm and was
unable to achieve her usual level of competence.
Last Friday, the Cards held a non-scoring meet at the track
against USC "to get in tune" for yesterday's competition, accord
ing to Grayson. "The meet was really low-key, and USC ran very
few people," he added. Nonetheless, "a lot of new personal
records were set, and people were looking better," he con
cluded.
This Saturday, the Cardinal women wHI host a meet against
UC-Davis, Hayward State and San Francisco State.
