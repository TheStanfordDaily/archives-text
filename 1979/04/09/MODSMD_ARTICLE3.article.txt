# Medical School Faculty Senate considers restructuring student evaluation process
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
The Medical School Faculty Senate
approved Friday afternoon five re
commendations tor preclinical stu
dent evaluation. The recommenda
tions were formulated in a report by
an ad hoc committee. About 75 stu
dents, described by one observer as
"the furies in the back," attended the
meeting to vocalize their dissatisfac
tion with the report.
The committee, chaired by Dr.
Ruth Cross, professor of pediatrics,
began to research the effects of the
current Mer) School requirements in
lanuary, 1978. Questionnaires were
distributed to faculty and students to
solicit and subsequently review the
prevalent attitudes towards grading
and advising policies.
An anonymous letter posted by
students last week underscored the
festering rupture between students
and their professors concerning the
structure and impact of scholastic
approach at the Med School.
At the beginning of the meeting,

Deputy Dean Lawrence Crowley ad
vised the senate to carefully consider
the content ot a faculty petition con
demning the current grading system
and admonished students "to not
overreact.''
Lack of preparation?
The Gross Report noted that "the
committee is particularly concerned
that 25 percent of the faculty respon
dents think that students are enter
ing their clinical clerkships without
adequate basic science preparation
and that a significant number of stu
dents are graduating with knowledge
that is below acceptable standards."
The substantial rise in the failure
rate of med students here on Part 1,
the basic science or pre-clinical sec
tion, of the National Board Examina
tion this year sparked a renewed in
terest among faculty members in
academic standards and student
preparation for clinical study.
Forty-one Med School faculty
members signed the petition, origi
nally circulated recently by Dr.

Avram Goldstein, professor of
pharmacology. The letter criticized,
among other points, the mandatory
pass/fail grading policy and elective
curriculum of the school as con
tributing to a reduction in student
achievement and professional com
petence.
The Cross report, however, did
endorse the elective curriculum and
the fundamental pass/fail system.
In response to a "strong disap
proval among the basic science fa
culty for the policy which allows stu
dents to drop a course any time up to
24 hours prior to the final examina
tion," the committee proposed that
"No student will be allowed to drop a
preclinical course later than four
weeks after the beginning of the
course without concurrence of the
instructor."
'Breach of contract' implications
Whereas "responsible faculty"
may exempt certain courses from
this category, a student dropping an
applicable course after the four week

period would be penalized with a fai
lure.
Students contended that such a
system would limit student ex
perimentation and discourage intel
lectual pursuit. While realizing that
such a policy is contradictory to Uni-"
versity policy and could conflict with
federal "breach of contract" laws, as
pertaining to already matriculated
students, the senate passed the
proposal.
Appeal method discussed
* The second recommendation, al
lowing that "Any student who fails a
preclinical course must pass that
course (by requirements determined
by the responsible faculty) prior to
undertaking clinical clerkships,"
passed the senate, as did Item 10,
calling for "the right of students to
due process" and an established un
iform method of appeal.
Item 3, which passed next, re
commended that "faculty of every
course must identify those students
whose performances are marginal by
a uniform standard, appropriate to
each department, developed by the
individual departments and re
viewed by the Committee on
Courses and Curriculum."
The next recommendation to be
approved, Item 4, specified that
"each student must receive an over
all pass of Part 1 of the National
Boards at the presently required per
centile (13) prior to the end of the
first clinical year." Either a subset on
the test, the successful completion
of a related Stanford course or ap
proval by the faculty in that area is
also mandatory.
Five more recommendations for
the preclinical years plus seven
proposals for the clinical years and
three general recommendations
concerning methods for final as
sessment of student performance
remain on the senate agenda to be
considered at the next session, to be
held within three weeks.
