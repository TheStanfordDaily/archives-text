Iranian officials executed
Tehran, Iran — Ten more persons, including
several top officials in the shah's government,
were executed by revolutionary firing squads yes
terday and today, reports here said.
Tehran Radio reported early today that former
air force commander, Gen. Amir Hossein Rabii,
Gen. Mohammad Ali khajehnuri, a former section
chief under the army chief of staff, Dr. Manuchehr
Azmun, former minister of labor and a senior
police constable identified only as Balili, accused
of killing people in a public bath, were the latest to
be executed.
The radio said the four were all "corrupt to the
core," and "traitors to the Iranian people."
Six others died before Islamic firing squads yes
terday, Tehran newspapers reported.
New violence flared in the streets of Tehran in
the aftermath of Saturday's execution of Amir
Abbas Hoveida, who served as prime minister
under the now-exiled shah for 13 years.
In the capital's eastern section, women fired
from a passing car at a group of militia guards of
the Islamic revolutionary government, wounding
several of them, news reports said. The women
were reported to have escaped.
Tanzanians approach Kampala
Nairobi, Kenya — Tanzanian forces pounded the
southern approaches to Kampala with heavy artil
lery fire yesterday after apparently being stopped
by unexpected resistance from fresh Ugandan
troops, according to exile sources and residents of
the Ugandan capital.
Travelers arriving from northeastern Uganda
reported, meanwhile, that President Idi Amin's
soldiers were rounding up members of two Christ
ian tribes that have been persecuted repeatedly in
the past for alleged disloyalty to the Moslem
Ugandan strongman. Their fate was unknown.
Amin's harsh eight-year rule seemed in its final
hours Saturday when the last of an estimated 2600
Libyan troops defending him were reported to
have fled toward an air base in the north, evidently
to fly back to Libya.
But exile sources said yesterday the invasion
lorce of Tanzanian soldiers and anti-Amin Ugan
dan rebels had run into new opposition — the

Bondo Battalion, loyal troops recently brought
down from Amin's home area of West Nile pro
vince in north-western Uganda.
In a related development, the London Daily Ex
press reported today that four journalists — two
Swedes and two West Germans — were reportedly
captured by Amin's secret police and shot to death
as they tried to sneak into Uganda.
Pa. governor may lift advisory
Harrisburg, Pa. — Gov. Dick Thornburgh's ad
visory that pre-school children and pregnant
women stay outside a five-mile radius of the dam
aged Three Mile Island nuclear reactor may be
lifted today, the governor's spokesman said.
Thornburgh decided yesterday to continue the
advisory for at least another day after meeting for
about an hour and a half with )oseph Hendrie,
chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC), and NRC operations chief Harold Denton.
Thornburgh issued his directive on March 30
after several leaks of radiation from the nuclear
power plant.
Paul Critchlow, Thornburgh's press secretary,
said the decision to lift the advisory "will be based
on the fact that the NRC officials believe they can
continue the cleanup without further significant
escapes of radioactivity."
Earlier yesterday, sign-carrying demonstrators
conducted "last rites for Three Mile Island'' on the
capitol steps here, saying it is time to bury the
damaged plant.
Eleven miles away, engineers continued the
tedious task of bringing the damaged reactor to a
cold shutdown, a job that authorities say could
take at least five more days.
Strike causes shortages, layoffs
Detroit — A shortage of vital parts normally
supplied by trucks threatens to choke the auto
industry as a Teamsters trucking lockout and strike
enters its second week.
Automakers depend on day-to-day shipments of
supplies and parts for vehicle assembly because
the huge assembly plants do not have room to
hold large steel inventories.
As the Labor Department kept watch over the
strike's effects, it was estimated yesterday that

200,000 auto workers — or a quarter of the hourly
work force — would be laid off this week.
Elsewhere, the impact has been slight.
The industry — the five major U.S. manufactur
ers — already had laid off 56,275 workers last Fri
day and had 74,200 on short-hour shifts.
Today, Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 national au
tomaker, will be virtually shut down. Thecompany
said last week that 85,000 workers would be laid off
at about 40 plants until a settlement between the
trucking industry and the Teamsters Union was
reached.
Bargaining is scheduled to resume today in
Washington between officials representing 500
major trucking firms and 235,000 Teamsters. Two
days of apparently fruitless negotiations broke off
Friday. Both sides, divided largely over President
jimmy Carter's anti-inflation wage guidelines, said
they would not budge from bargaining positions
that prompted the work stoppage.
Police look for murder suspect
Paxton, 111. — Authorities continued to search
yesterday for an armed and wounded man who
escaped a gun battle that left five people dead,
including two police officers and two of his
brothers.
Twenty officers scoured the farmland of east
central Illinois searching for Monroe Lampkin,
named in a murder warrant after the Saturday
night gunbattle, police said. Lampkin's age and
hometown were unavailable.
Two of Lampkin's brothers, Cleveland, 46, of
Harvey, 111., and Davis, 32, hometown unknown,
were killed in the gunbattle, authorities said. A
third was taken into custody.
State police investigator Clay Boyer said three
.357 magnum pistols were found in two pickup
trucks and a Thunderbird that had stopped by one
of the slain officers. Police added that shell casing
found at the scene led police to believe that
Lampkin was armed.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows in 40s to low 50s,
highs in mid 50s to mid 60s. Small craft advisory for
west to northwest winds 15 to 30 mph.

Swedes and two West Germans — were reportedly
captured by Amin's secret police and shot to death
as they tried to sneak into Uganda.
Pa. governor may lift advisory
Harrisburg, Pa. — Gov. Dick Thornburgh's ad
visory that pre-school children and pregnant
women stay outside a five-mile radius of the dam
aged Three Mile Island nuclear reactor may be
lifted today, the governor's spokesman said.
Thornburgh decided yesterday to continue the
advisory for at least another day after meeting for
about an hour and a half with )oseph Hendrie,
chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC), and NRC operations chief Harold Denton.
Thornburgh issued his directive on March 30
after several leaks of radiation from the nuclear
power plant.
Paul Critchlow, Thornburgh's press secretary,
said the decision to lift the advisory "will be based
on the fact that the NRC officials believe they can
continue the cleanup without further significant
escapes of radioactivity."
Earlier yesterday, sign-carrying demonstrators
conducted "last rites for Three Mile Island'' on the
capitol steps here, saying it is time to bury the
damaged plant.
Eleven miles away, engineers continued the
tedious task of bringing the damaged reactor to a
cold shutdown, a job that authorities say could
take at least five more days.
Strike causes shortages, layoffs
Detroit — A shortage of vital parts normally
supplied by trucks threatens to choke the auto
industry as a Teamsters trucking lockout and strike
enters its second week.
Automakers depend on day-to-day shipments of
supplies and parts for vehicle assembly because
the huge assembly plants do not have room to
hold large steel inventories.
As the Labor Department kept watch over the
strike's effects, it was estimated yesterday that

200,000 auto workers — or a quarter of the hourly
work force — would be laid off this week.
Elsewhere, the impact has been slight.
The industry — the five major U.S. manufactur
ers — already had laid off 56,275 workers last Fri
day and had 74,200 on short-hour shifts.
Today, Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 national au
tomaker, will be virtually shut down. Thecompany
said last week that 85,000 workers would be laid off
at about 40 plants until a settlement between the
trucking industry and the Teamsters Union was
reached.
Bargaining is scheduled to resume today in
Washington between officials representing 500
major trucking firms and 235,000 Teamsters. Two
days of apparently fruitless negotiations broke off
Friday. Both sides, divided largely over President
jimmy Carter's anti-inflation wage guidelines, said
they would not budge from bargaining positions
that prompted the work stoppage.
Police look for murder suspect
Paxton, 111. — Authorities continued to search
yesterday for an armed and wounded man who
escaped a gun battle that left five people dead,
including two police officers and two of his
brothers.
Twenty officers scoured the farmland of east
central Illinois searching for Monroe Lampkin,
named in a murder warrant after the Saturday
night gunbattle, police said. Lampkin's age and
hometown were unavailable.
Two of Lampkin's brothers, Cleveland, 46, of
Harvey, 111., and Davis, 32, hometown unknown,
were killed in the gunbattle, authorities said. A
third was taken into custody.
State police investigator Clay Boyer said three
.357 magnum pistols were found in two pickup
trucks and a Thunderbird that had stopped by one
of the slain officers. Police added that shell casing
found at the scene led police to believe that
Lampkin was armed.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows in 40s to low 50s,
highs in mid 50s to mid 60s. Small craft advisory for
west to northwest winds 15 to 30 mph.
Iranian officials executed
Tehran, Iran — Ten more persons, including
several top officials in the shah's government,
were executed by revolutionary firing squads yes
terday and today, reports here said.
Tehran Radio reported early today that former
air force commander, Gen. Amir Hossein Rabii,
Gen. Mohammad Ali khajehnuri, a former section
chief under the army chief of staff, Dr. Manuchehr
Azmun, former minister of labor and a senior
police constable identified only as Balili, accused
of killing people in a public bath, were the latest to
be executed.
The radio said the four were all "corrupt to the
core," and "traitors to the Iranian people."
Six others died before Islamic firing squads yes
terday, Tehran newspapers reported.
New violence flared in the streets of Tehran in
the aftermath of Saturday's execution of Amir
Abbas Hoveida, who served as prime minister
under the now-exiled shah for 13 years.
In the capital's eastern section, women fired
from a passing car at a group of militia guards of
the Islamic revolutionary government, wounding
several of them, news reports said. The women
were reported to have escaped.
Tanzanians approach Kampala
Nairobi, Kenya — Tanzanian forces pounded the
southern approaches to Kampala with heavy artil
lery fire yesterday after apparently being stopped
by unexpected resistance from fresh Ugandan
troops, according to exile sources and residents of
the Ugandan capital.
Travelers arriving from northeastern Uganda
reported, meanwhile, that President Idi Amin's
soldiers were rounding up members of two Christ
ian tribes that have been persecuted repeatedly in
the past for alleged disloyalty to the Moslem
Ugandan strongman. Their fate was unknown.
Amin's harsh eight-year rule seemed in its final
hours Saturday when the last of an estimated 2600
Libyan troops defending him were reported to
have fled toward an air base in the north, evidently
to fly back to Libya.
But exile sources said yesterday the invasion
lorce of Tanzanian soldiers and anti-Amin Ugan
dan rebels had run into new opposition — the

Bondo Battalion, loyal troops recently brought
down from Amin's home area of West Nile pro
vince in north-western Uganda.
In a related development, the London Daily Ex
press reported today that four journalists — two
Swedes and two West Germans — were reportedly
captured by Amin's secret police and shot to death
as they tried to sneak into Uganda.
