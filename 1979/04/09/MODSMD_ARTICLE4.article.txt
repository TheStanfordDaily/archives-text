# Co SS agrees on a new charge for minorities subcommittee
## 
### Robert Reed 
Though some dissatisfaction still
remains, the University's Committee
on Student Services (CoSS) has
adopted tor its Subcommittee on
Minority Affairs (CoSS-M) a charge
that finally has the support of the
minority community.
The old charge, drawn up by CoSS
without minority input, basically cal
led upon CoSS-M to find avenues for
more open communication among
minorities, CoSS, and the Office of
Student Affairs, and to carry out spe
cial assignments from CoSS from
time to time.
In contrast to that general prog
ram, members of the minority com
munity had at that time s. omitted
(without approval) a proposal that
listed several specific responsibilities
tor CoSS-M, including the evaluation
of programs for minorities in Univer
sity residences, the vitality of minor
ity student organizations, the Career
Planning and Placement Center's
(CPPC) services for minorities,
psychological counseling services,
minority freshmen orientation and
the adequacy of the Stanford
Bookstore inventory with regard to
publications written by minorities
and concerning minority issues.
The new charge, while having a
somewhat general theme listed as an
objective and while specifying that
the subcommittee shall conduct
special assignments from CoSS, lists
almost verbatim the specific tasks
previously submitted by members of
the minority â€” the one exception
being the Bookstore provision,
which was'left out entirely.
The reason we could not give
CoSS-M the power (to monitor the
Bookstore) is because CoSS does not
have this power itself," said CoSS
chairperson Sara Beckham, claiming
that because the Bookstore is a pri
vate company, it is not within the
jurisdiction of an advisory committee
on University-provided student ser
vices.
Dissatisfaction with old charge
At a Feb. 21 meeting of CoSS, some
25 minority students voiced their dis
satisfaction with the then-adopted

charge tor CoSS-M. In response to
that dissatisfaction, a new charge was
drawn up.
"We wanted a charge that would
be effective, workable, and benefi
cial to all parties concerned," said
Beckham. Members of the minority
community felt the old charge had
not achieved these goals.
"We thought a general charge
would help with continuity," said
Beckham, explaining that CoSS had
felt that a less specific charge would
allow more leeway in the years to
come. However, the feelings of CoSS
at this time did not agree with those
of members of the minority com
munity.
According to COP member Regina
Petty, because there was "no

specificity involved" in the old
charge, "it was creating a committee
doomed to failure."
After the Feb. 21 meeting, CoSS
had proposed an open meeting with
the minority community for the pur
pose of adopting a new charge.
However, this plan was docked in
order to avoid a useless confronta
tion of opposing camps, Beckham
said. According to her, CoSS didn't
want members of the minority com
munity to make up a charge on their
own that would have difficulty pas
sing. Members of CoSS felt it would
need a group effort to get the charge
passed. Instead of a formal open
meeting presenting two opposing
proposals, selected members of
