Twq freshmen scrutinized the ad
vertisement for the "Legacy of
McCarthy" film and lecture series.
The ad displays a caricature of Sen.
Joseph McCarthy. The symbol of the
Nazi Party is subtly engraved on his
chin.
"What's that swastika doing on
that man?" one of the students asked
the other. Neither had heard of
loseph McCarthy before.
The McCarthy series, sponsored
by the Center for East Asian Studies
and the ASSU Speakers Bureau, is a
retrospective of the period in Ameri
can history — from the end of World
War II through the late 1950s — that
saw the lives and careers of
many Americans destroyed
by anti-communist sentiment.
loseph McCarthy, senator from
Wisconsin from 1947 to 1957, was
perhaps the most notorious scourge
of communists and communist sym
pathizers during the Cold War
period.
"We hope to introduce people
who didn't live through the period to
this period in history and to remind
those who did live through the

period to keep it in perspective as
relations with China improve," Asst.
History Prof. Harold Kahn said. Kahn
is a member of the Center for East
Asian Studies.
The program, which began last
Thursday and will run through the
end of May, is divided into two parts.
The first half, featuring three speak
ers and three films, will discuss anti
communism in the United States
(". . . which is as American as apple
pie,' Kahn said). The second and
more substantial half of the series
will consider the "Asian Connec
tion" — the McCarthy period as it
affected U.S. ties with China.
On April 23, two former Foreign
Service officers, John Emmerson and
lohn Service, will discuss the State
Department's policy toward China
prior to the Chinese Revolution. In
the late 19405, Emmerson and Service
were stationed in Yenan, the hub of
Mao Zedong's revolutionary activity.
Other highlights of the series will
include the renowned scholar Owen
Lattimore, China scholar William
Hinton and Woody Allen's film The
Front.
