# Author refutes myth of 'skulking Communists'
## Mitford describes Communist career 
### Leslie Phillips 
Wearing her favorite purple socks,
Jessica Mitford, renowned author
and social commentator, debunked
the myth of the Communist Party
cadre of the 1950s skulking about
dark alleyways.
Kicking off the "Legacy of McCar
thy" film and lecture series before a
crowd of 150 people in Braun Au
ditorium last Thursday evening, Mit
ford said she wanted to demystify the
Communist Party (CP). Her second
autobiography, A Fine Old Conflict
was written with that purpose also.
Published in 1977, the book deals
with her life in the party before and
during the McCarthy era.
If everyone in the party had had as
much fun as Mitford seemed to have
had, they might have spread the gos
pel more effectively. Mitford was not
a very good Stalinist.
Forexample, Mitford tells the story
of the time she ordered 1000 "un
dressed" chickens from Petaluma.
As financial director of the San Fran
cisco branch of the CP, she was re
sponsible for organizing a huge pic
nic for the Bay Area comrades. The

menu included fried chicken. The
day before the scheduled event,
crateloads of feathered chickens ar
rived in San Francisco.
Undressed chickens
"I ordered them undressed be
cause . . . well . . . that's the way I
thought they should be," Mitford
said.
Mitford is best known forexposing
the funeral industry in her irreve
rently witty book The American Way
of Death.
She digressed from the subject of
communism several times through
out her speech, and instead shed
light on peculiarities such as Fitafuts
— funerary shoes designed to fit a
foot already set in rigor mortis.
Liberals 'turning tail'
Mitford first subscribed to com
munism as a teenager in Britain dur
ing the rise of fascism in Germany
and Italy. In the mid-19405, she was
invited to join the party.
"In the late '40s, liberals were turn
ing tail. The ACLU, supposedly a
staunch defender of civil rights and
Ireedom of speech, was itself feed
ing information about its own mem

bers to the FBI. The only organization
that was continuing without turning
around, without fear, fightingforthe
things I believed in was the Com
munist Party," she said.
Persecution of Hollywood stars in
the 1950s is well known, but other
activities of the House Un-American
Activities Committee (HUAC) have
not been so well publicized, she
said.
Trial for communist involvement
In 1951, Mitford was subpoenaed
before the California Committee on
Un-American Activities to testify
about her own involvement in the
Communist Party. At the time, she
was Secretary of the Civil Rights
Congress, a radical left organization
which defended civil liberties.
Mitford responded to each of the
committee's questions in the same
way: "I refuse to answer on the
ground that I might incriminate my
self."
Finally, in exasperation, the com
mittee counsel asked her if she was a
member of the Berkeley Tenants
Club — at least that's what Mitford
