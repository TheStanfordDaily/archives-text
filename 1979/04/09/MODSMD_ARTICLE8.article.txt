# Skiing, sporting events to kick off Aqua Follies
## 
### Kathy Bowman 
If there's water in Lake Lagunita and sun
shine over it, the Aqua Follies will be held
Sunday. The traditional water carnival in
cludes water races and demonstrations.
The Band will open the day's events by
marching across campus from Wilbur Hall to
the lake. Activities begin with a waterskiing
show, followed by intramural canoe racing,
sailing and windsurfing demonstrations, a
rescue demonstration by the Coast Guard, a
dorm tug-of-warcompetition, and a waterski
ing exhibition. Also tentatively scheduled are
an appearance by the Mendicants, a hot air
balloon demonstration and a hydroplane
exhibition.
All proceeds from entry fees and some
concessions will be donated to the Stanford
Childien's Hospital.
According to senior Bill Maloney, Aqua Fol
lies coordinator, the traditional Follies disap
peared during recent droughts, and were
not held after 1975. Last spring, when the lake
filled, the Follies returned. Maloney said he
hopes for an attendance of approximately
5000 people.
Aqua Follies is being jointly sponsored by
the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), Tresidder
Recreation Center, Pepsi-Cola and Bud

weiser.
Maloney estimates the total cost of the
event at $600 as compared to last year's $1200.
This year, "The people selling food aredonat
ing 20 percent of their profits," which will
help cut costs, Maloney said.
In order to participate in Aqua Follies
events, dorms and fraternities with fewer
than 100 residents must pay a $20 entry fee
and fraternities and dorms with more than
100 residents must pay $30. Senior Melinda
Smith is organizing dorm competitions.
Smith said,"Because of the time limitation,
we are only allowing one all-university team
and one all-women's team from each dorm in
the canoe races, and one all-university tug
of-war team from each dorm. Intramural
points will be awarded for the canoe race
only.
Aqua Follies originated many years ago as a
benefit to Stanford Children's Hospital, but
proceeds from the event have been distri
buted to a number of organizations and pro
jects.
Members of the IFC will clean up the lake
area following the event; Greg Larson of Tre
sidder Recreation Center has organized the
finances and made arrangements for conces
sions.
