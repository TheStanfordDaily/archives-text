# Serra Street reconstruction set
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Serra Street in front of the Quad,
beaten by years of abuse from buses
and construction equipment, will be
reconstructed this summer, the
Board of Trustees decided yesterday.
The action came as the board ap
proved the $1.6 million General Plant
Improvements Program for the
1979-80 year. The Serra Street recon
struction is the single most expen
sive project in the program at a cost
of $465,000.
The program is a routine series of
maintenance projects dealing with
electrical, steam, chilled water and
water pipelines plus roads, walk
ways, sewers, landscaping and the
like.
It will be financed through the
proceeds of the sale of California
Educational Facilities Authority
bonds and th rough pro rated charges
to building projects already under
way.
The Serra Street reconstruction,
first recommended in a report writ
ten 10 years ago, will include a total
reworking of the present road bed
from Tanner Fountain to Via Palou.
The new road will prevent poten
tial damage to several utility systems
presently under the damaged road,
according to a trustee background
report. Damage could result if the
present surface should fail.

Asphalt costs will account for 60
percent of the reconstruction costs,
according to the report, but it is not
yet clear that the road will be rebuilt
in exactly the form in which it pre
sently exists. There is a chance the
road will be narrower when rebuilt,
eliminating the nearly 100 parking
spaces which presently exist along
the stretch of road.
Committee on Parking and Trans
portation Chairman Robert Hamrdla
said last week his committee had ad
vised against eliminating the spaces,
but Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig said it was not yet
finalized whether the road would be
redesigned when it is rebuilt.
Other program projects include
expenditure of over $125,000 for im
proved lighting on campus; $150,000
for increased vehicular control, bicy
cle parking and signs; and $60,000f0r
landscaping in the Press Courtyard,
the Bookstore-Post Office concourse
and at the Organic Chemistry Build
ing.
Electrical projects totaling $245,000
were also approved. One, costing
$175,000, will provide improved elec
trical service to the northeast Quad.
The service is necessitated by the re
construction of Building 120 (Sociol
ogy) in the Quad, slated to begin
later this year.
Two sanitary sewer projects will

improve existing lines in White Plaza
and at Bleeker Hall at a cost of
$86,500. In addition, $18,000 will be
spent to improve storm sewers on
Serra Street near the campus compu
ter facility.
Three improvements in chilled
water and steam pipelines will result
in replacement of the Calvez Mall
condensate line, addition of air
compressors for the central chilled
water plant and the addition of water
pumps to return condensate directly
to the high pressure chiller at the
plant. Those projects will cost
$245,000.
The CPI program last year totaled
$3.5 million, while the 1977-78 prog
ram cost $3.6 million and the 1976-77
program cost $5.3 million.
According to Rosenzweig, despite
the seeming size of this year's figure,
the University is still postponing
many important maintenance ex
penditures.


The Board of Trustees yesterday approved $465,000 fof the
reconstruction of Serra Street in front of the Quad. The

Plant Improvements Program for 1979-80.
