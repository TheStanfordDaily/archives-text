Space. Can it be the answer
to many of the problems which
plague mankind? Can it pro
vide the solar energy that the
world needs to meet its ever
dwindling energy supply? Is it
within the scope of our
technology to create large
structures in space to house
billions of people? The Stan
ford Center for Space De
velopment (SCSD), an organi
zation led by Michael Simon
and David Ross, is examining
these prospects.
Formerly the Stanford Space
Development Institute, SCSD
is an outgrowth of a SWOPSI
course entitled "Space Coloni
zation," first taught fall quar
ter. Simon, who worked on the
1977 NASA Ames Summer
Study which examined the
feasibility of large structures in
space, originally designed the
course. The SCSD was formed
for students unable to take the
class.
Simon, a junior majoring in
engineering-economic systems
and president of the SCSD,
said the SCSD is "dedicated to
the realization of man's full po
tential for utilizing outer space
resources."
Ross, a doctoral candidate in
aeronautics and astronautics,
also worked on the NASA
Ames study and is chairman of
the SCSD. He said the SCSD
has two goals. The first is to
educate the public. The SCSD,
in conjunction with the
SWOPSI class, held a Space

Settlements Symposium here
fall quarter. Experts from the
NASA Ames Research Center,
among others, spoke. A Space
Day is planned for later this
quarter.
The second goal of the
SCSD, according to Ross, is to
do some of the technical work
in the field. The work will deal
primarily with overcoming the
obstacles in the path of space
development.
There are three areas in
which space development will
have major impact, according
to Ross. In the short term,
he said he foresees rapid and
cheap communication such as
the wrist telephone,
emergency medical service,
satellite relays and satellite
navigation. Another major im
pact is in the area of commer
cial goods such as ultrapure
pharmaceuticals and heart and
burn clinics.
The most use of space, Ross
said, will be for the construc
tion of large space structures
such as space colonies and
solar power satellites which he

believes will be able to meet all
increasing electrical usage in
the world by the early 2000s.
The beginnings of this prog
ram will be either American or
Soviet because these are the
only two nations which have
the capacity to do it, Ross said.
Eventually, however, he be
lieves that the program will be
set up along the lines of INTEL
SAT, an internationally char
tered corporation with strong
government and United Na
tions ties. He said "the benefits
(of the project) overwhelm
other national considera
tions."
Ross said the Carter ad
ministration is "very timid —
afraid of innovation in almost
any field and will proceed ex
tremely cautiously if at all with
something this progressive."
However, he said that as the
American public becomes
more aware of the possibilities
of space development, public
support will become an over
whelming factor to force ad
ministrative action.
