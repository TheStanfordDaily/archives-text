## An invalid prior restraint 
### 
On March 9, Federal District Court
Judge Robert Warren became the first
American jurist ever to grant an injunc
tion to silence a publication for reasons
of "national security." The subject of
Warren's ruling was an article in The
Progressive magazine entitled "The
H-Bomb Secret: How We Got It, Why
We're Telling It," which President Jimmy
Carter's administration claims is in viola
tion of the 1946 Atomic Energy Act's pro
hibition of the disclosure of "restricted
data." The secretary of state, the secret
ary of defense, and the secretary of
energy, among others, have all sworn
that some information in the article
would result in certain and irreparable
harm to the nation by helping other
countries to build hydrogen bombs.
This case of prior restraint — the clas
sic form of censorship — is yet another
ominous sign in an era when First
Amendment rights are rapidly being
eroded by the nation's judiciary. We join
with the New York Times in strongly
condemning Warren's decision as a
dangerous precedent "not only uncon
stitutional, but also unnecessary, arbit
rary, and ill-informed."
The government does not dispute that
the information they want suppressed
was obtained by a writer with no special
expertise, by legal means from public
sources, including encyclopedias and a
college physics text. What the govern
ment does claim is that even if synth
esized from information in the public
domain, such information is in effect
"born classified" and should remain
classified until a decision is made other

wise — a definition of what material may
be censored that is far broader than any
other previously upheld by the courts.
Warren said in his decision that he
wanted time to think "before I'd give the
hydrogen bomb to Idi Amin." Such fears
are spurious: it is not a secret that stops
the next bomb but the lack of the neces
sary industrial and scientific base on
which to proceed. India, Israel, and
other countries have held back produc
tion of the H-bomb for political,
economic or diplomatic reasons, not
because of the lack of proper informa
tion.
What the government really wishes to
protect is a system of secrecy which, for
the past four decades, has prevented
public scrutiny of and informed debate
on the true political and economic factors
that determine government policy in this
area. By bowing submissively to the au
thority of impressive government wit
nesses he felt too ignorant to challenge,
Warren merely perpetuated the unjus
tified official emphasis on secrecy which
serves only to keep the public in ignor
ance and obscure the very real dangers
of nuclear weapons proliferation.
The last time the government attemp
ted — unsuccessfully — to exercise prior
restraint was in the case of the Pentagon
Papers, when government claims that
national security was threatened were
dismissed by the Supreme Court specifi
cally on First Amendment grounds. Such
a precedent offers no grounds to trust
government claims of national security
today.
