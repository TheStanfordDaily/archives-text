## Individualism, landscape cause isolation 
### 
Isolation. It's what you feel
when you're too alone to be
comfortable. Outside of Tre
sidder — when you gulp down
big foam cups of black coffee
as you watch the black birds
gulp discarded french fries and
you swear you see gnomes
with growths on their backs
and not students with gnostic

What one student experiences as social
isolation is what a professor calls the too
quiet voice of the student body. It is not
surprising that Stanford is sometimes
described as complacent.

sacks on their backs. Isolation
in a crowd is alienation. It's a
tacky word these days, but it
exists here on this campus
among this fairly homogenous
bunch of students.
Granted, it's a symptom of a
stage of life: budding adult
hood; yet Stanford suffers
from social isolation in diffe
rent ways from other cam
puses.
In some ways, the University
is physically conducive to so
cial isolation. There is no cent
ral focal point people stream
through; White Plaza, while
functional, wanders and is
open to social diffusion. The
student union is better as a
transition for noon-hour
people than as a place to settle
back with a friend or two foran
hour or so.
The main staircase at UGLY,
a natural point for social in

teraction, is closed off. The
University, spread out ar
chitecturally in its discon
nected fashion, is a dif
fused spatial network which
creates a diffused social net
work, which means it's not
easy to meet with people in a
casual, comfortable way.
Imagine how the landscape

would change if the main stair
case at Meyer Undergraduate
Library were used and students
flowed out into that space of
grass between UGLY and the
Law School. Tresidder with its
smudge-dirty walls has a re
markably uninviting ambience
— McDonald's in the shopping
center creates a better atmos
phere. Imagine what Tresidder
would be like just with the
walls painted brighter than the
blue of a bluejay with indoor/
outdoor carpet to match — it'd
be a cheery alternative to the
Coffee House which is just too
small to serve all the chatty
needs of the University.
Then there are the students.
On the whole, we're not radi
cal to the establishment any
more. We pay tuition, go to
classes, take the question of
professional life very seriously.
Sometimes we're voiceless,
like good kids who are seen

and not heard. Some disdain
fully say we lack the heart of
the '60s.
But is it because we lack
heart or simply that we don't
have much in common to talk
about? Every kid in the '60s was
confronted with the draft and
Vietnam; we in the'7os don't
even take Western Civ to
gether. One professor com
plained the closest Stanford
students come to being riled in
rabid dialogue over the dinner
table is about Chem 31.
Isotopes are not particularly
conscience-provoking, but
given the lack of other things in
common to talk about, it is not
surprising. Perhaps a Western
Civ requirement would be a
good thing in terms of dinner
table talk. At the very least,
students can complain about
the inadequate teaching of the
course or maybe even get ex
cited about some idea.
The University rarely insists
on participation by students in
anything particular. It seems
we're supposed to be quite
capable of judging our own
needs at 17 or 18. While I am
highly individualistic and
idealistic, I think that approach
is counterproductive to a
dynamic student body.
Yes, there are theme houses
SLE, attempts at common core
experiences, yet these are vol
untary experiences that allow a
student to passively opt out.
While I like having the rights
of an adult, a few common core
experiences impressed upon
me might not have been a bad
thing. If a student really didn't
want to participate, then let
him or her battle it out — slay
the mother/father figure — it's
suppose to be cathartic.
We were proven achievers
before we eot here, and cer

tainly achievement and indi
vidualism are reinforced here.
What one student experiences
as social isolation is what a pro
fessor or a president of the
University calls the too quiet
voice of the student body. It is
not surprising that Stanford is
sometimes described as com
placent.
Still, many professors and
students are hungry for that
ambience taut with the discus
sion of ideas. Given the dif
fused social network of Stan-

ford, a socially dynamic at
mosphere needs to be en
gineered, not passively
sought. It should be possible:
after all Stanford has one of the
leading communication de
partments in the country.
But that investment, how
ever exciting, depends as
much on the people that run
this place as any of us 70s kids
that go here.

The main staircase at UGLY,
a natural point for social in

teraction, is closed off. The
University, spread out ar
chitecturally in its discon
nected fashion, is a dif
fused spatial network which
creates a diffused social net
work, which means it's not
easy to meet with people in a
casual, comfortable way.
Imagine how the landscape

would change if the main stair
case at Meyer Undergraduate
Library were used and students
flowed out into that space of
grass between UGLY and the
Law School. Tresidder with its
smudge-dirty walls has a re
markably uninviting ambience
— McDonald's in the shopping
center creates a better atmos
phere. Imagine what Tresidder
would be like just with the
walls painted brighter than the
blue of a bluejay with indoor/
outdoor carpet to match — it'd
be a cheery alternative to the
Coffee House which is just too
small to serve all the chatty
needs of the University.
Then there are the students.
On the whole, we're not radi
cal to the establishment any
more. We pay tuition, go to
classes, take the question of
professional life very seriously.
Sometimes we're voiceless,
like good kids who are seen

and not heard. Some disdain
fully say we lack the heart of
the '60s.
But is it because we lack
heart or simply that we don't
have much in common to talk
about? Every kid in the '60s was
confronted with the draft and
Vietnam; we in the'7os don't
even take Western Civ to
gether. One professor com
plained the closest Stanford
students come to being riled in
rabid dialogue over the dinner
table is about Chem 31.
Isotopes are not particularly
conscience-provoking, but
given the lack of other things in
common to talk about, it is not
surprising. Perhaps a Western
Civ requirement would be a
good thing in terms of dinner
table talk. At the very least,
students can complain about
the inadequate teaching of the
course or maybe even get ex
cited about some idea.
The University rarely insists
on participation by students in
anything particular. It seems
we're supposed to be quite
capable of judging our own
needs at 17 or 18. While I am
highly individualistic and
idealistic, I think that approach
is counterproductive to a
dynamic student body.
Yes, there are theme houses
SLE, attempts at common core
experiences, yet these are vol
untary experiences that allow a
student to passively opt out.
While I like having the rights
of an adult, a few common core
experiences impressed upon
me might not have been a bad
thing. If a student really didn't
want to participate, then let
him or her battle it out — slay
the mother/father figure — it's
suppose to be cathartic.
We were proven achievers
before we eot here, and cer

tainly achievement and indi
vidualism are reinforced here.
What one student experiences
as social isolation is what a pro
fessor or a president of the
University calls the too quiet
voice of the student body. It is
not surprising that Stanford is
sometimes described as com
placent.
Still, many professors and
students are hungry for that
ambience taut with the discus
sion of ideas. Given the dif
fused social network of Stan-

ford, a socially dynamic at
mosphere needs to be en
gineered, not passively
sought. It should be possible:
after all Stanford has one of the
leading communication de
partments in the country.
But that investment, how
ever exciting, depends as
much on the people that run
this place as any of us 70s kids
that go here.

in a crowd is alienation. It's a
tacky word these days, but it
exists here on this campus
among this fairly homogenous
bunch of students.
Granted, it's a symptom of a
stage of life: budding adult
hood; yet Stanford suffers
from social isolation in diffe
rent ways from other cam
puses.
In some ways, the University
is physically conducive to so
cial isolation. There is no cent
ral focal point people stream
through; White Plaza, while
functional, wanders and is
open to social diffusion. The
student union is better as a
transition for noon-hour
people than as a place to settle
back with a friend or two foran
hour or so.
