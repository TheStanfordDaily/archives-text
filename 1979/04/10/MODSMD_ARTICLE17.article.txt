## Doug Bandow Deregulate admission to the Bar 
### 
Since I'm Hearing graduation
from law school, I recently
picked up my State Bar Exam
application. I found, to my
chagrin, that I have to pay the
State Bar $182 for the privilege
of taking the Bar Exam. And
that's not all — I'll have to shell
out another $400 to take a re
view course to prepare for it.
Now, $600 may not seem like
much to pay for the right to a
wonderful career in "The
Law." But I resent the fact that
this elitist professional group is
endowed with the legal right to
extort money from me; unless
I buy their approval, I can't
practice law.
Of course, lawyers are not
the only people who have suc
cessfully monopolized their
profession. Doctors, TV re
pairmen, cosmetologists and
the like have all gained state
sanction for various degrees of
exclusionary state regulation.
But the case of attorneys is all
the more egregious because of
lawyers' over-representation in
the government; the conflict
of interest is all too obvious.
The theory of the Bar Exam is
to permit only minimally com
petent people to practice law.
However, it is still not clear that

the Bar Exam is a good device
to measure such competence:
it tests for an analytical ability
which may be crucial for a con
stitutional scholar arguing be
fore the U.S. Supreme Court
but which, though helpful, is
not necessary for someone at
tempting to collect a small
debt.

There is no justification for excluding
everyone who fails the bar exam from
practicing law.

But even assuming that it is
an accurate measuring device,
there is no justification for
excluding everyone who fails it
from the practice of law. Such
exclusion is, among other
things, an intolerable interfer
ence with the rights of the indi
vidual who, after enduring
three to four years of legal
training, is not allowed to try to
make a living at it.
In fact, it is the threat of
competition from these poten
tial attorneys that leads estab
lished attorneys to shut them
out. High-minded claims of the

"public interest" merely mask
the most blatant economic
self-interest: the fewer attor
neys, the higher the fees and
the more exclusive the profes
sion.
Thus, the Bar Exam hurts
precisely those people that it is
supposed to "protect" — the
consumer. The exclusion of

potential competitors under
the guise of quality protection
inevitably increases the cost of
legal services.
Moreover, this pernicious
effect is felt hardest by middle
and lower income groups. The
potential attorneys who are not
allowed to practice would not
be the six-figure salary partners
of major urban law firms. They
would not be the top antitrust
litigators, the best tax
specialists, nor the most ex
perienced corporate attor
neys. On the whole, they
probably don't possess the
analytical skill, the prestigious
schooling and the innate abil
ity necessary for such jobs.
Rather, these potential at
torneys would be handling the
small cases of the common
man: debts, rent deposits and
soon. They are the people who
would handle those cases that
have been priced out of the
market today — priced out by
the use of the Bar Exam to
exclude these very same
people. A person with few re
sources could go to his $10 an
hour attorney to see if his $200
claim against his neighbor was
viable. Cases which are simply
not economical these days
would be put back within the
reach of the hands of those of
only limited means.
And how to control quality?

Granted, these attorneys will
not be the cream of the crop.
But the cases they will be in
volved in do not require the
finest skills; what they do re
quire is an adequate know
ledge of the law, a rudimentary
understanding of the legal
process and a fee small enough
to justify bringing the case. The
cases these attorneys would
handle would be small enough
that they would involve little
risk to the clients.
Moreover, without a state
mandated Bar Exam, consum
ers would no longer be lulled
into complacency by the offi
cial all attorneys
— even incompetents — pos
sess. Consumers would then
have an adequate incentive to
closely check the credentials
and reputation of attorneys.
Nor would total incompe
tents who were unable to
handle even the most simple
cases survive easily in a free,
competitive market. This type
of attorney must build up a
local reputation and gain refer
rals to survive; failure to do so
would likely yield starvation.
A compromise would be to
offer the Bar Exam as an option.
Those attorneys who wanted to
maximize their legal creden
tials could so do, and those
consumers who desire official
certification of an attorney's
skills could seek out attorneys
who had passed it. But others
would be able to make the ra
tional choice of accepting a
lesser degree of skill in the
hope of winning a case they
could not otherwise have
brought.
The end of the lawyers'
state-sanctioned monopoly
would give the consumer more
freedom of choice and lower
fees; the only people who have
anything to fear from it are the
established attorneys them
selves.

would be able to make the ra
tional choice of accepting a
lesser degree of skill in the
hope of winning a case they
could not otherwise have
brought.

state-sanctioned monopoly

Since I'm Hearing graduation
from law school, I recently
picked up my State Bar Exam
application. I found, to my
chagrin, that I have to pay the
State Bar $182 for the privilege
of taking the Bar Exam. And
that's not all — I'll have to shell
out another $400 to take a re
view course to prepare for it.
Now, $600 may not seem like
much to pay for the right to a
wonderful career in "The
Law." But I resent the fact that
this elitist professional group is
endowed with the legal right to
extort money from me; unless
I buy their approval, I can't
practice law.
Of course, lawyers are not
the only people who have suc
cessfully monopolized their
profession. Doctors, TV re
pairmen, cosmetologists and
the like have all gained state
sanction for various degrees of
exclusionary state regulation.
But the case of attorneys is all
the more egregious because of
lawyers' over-representation in
the government; the conflict
of interest is all too obvious.
The theory of the Bar Exam is
to permit only minimally com
petent people to practice law.
However, it is still not clear that

the Bar Exam is a good device
to measure such competence:
it tests for an analytical ability
which may be crucial for a con
stitutional scholar arguing be
fore the U.S. Supreme Court
but which, though helpful, is
not necessary for someone at
tempting to collect a small
debt.

There is no justification for excluding
everyone who fails the bar exam from
practicing law.

But even assuming that it is
an accurate measuring device,
there is no justification for
excluding everyone who fails it
from the practice of law. Such
exclusion is, among other
things, an intolerable interfer
ence with the rights of the indi
vidual who, after enduring
three to four years of legal
training, is not allowed to try to
make a living at it.
In fact, it is the threat of
competition from these poten
tial attorneys that leads estab
lished attorneys to shut them
out. High-minded claims of the

"public interest" merely mask
the most blatant economic
self-interest: the fewer attor
neys, the higher the fees and
the more exclusive the profes
sion.
Thus, the Bar Exam hurts
precisely those people that it is
supposed to "protect" — the
consumer. The exclusion of

potential competitors under
the guise of quality protection
inevitably increases the cost of
legal services.
Moreover, this pernicious
effect is felt hardest by middle
and lower income groups. The
potential attorneys who are not
allowed to practice would not
be the six-figure salary partners
of major urban law firms. They
would not be the top antitrust
litigators, the best tax
specialists, nor the most ex
perienced corporate attor
neys. On the whole, they
probably don't possess the
analytical skill, the prestigious
schooling and the innate abil
ity necessary for such jobs.
Rather, these potential at
torneys would be handling the
small cases of the common
man: debts, rent deposits and
soon. They are the people who
would handle those cases that
have been priced out of the
market today — priced out by
the use of the Bar Exam to
exclude these very same
people. A person with few re
sources could go to his $10 an
hour attorney to see if his $200
claim against his neighbor was
viable. Cases which are simply
not economical these days
would be put back within the
reach of the hands of those of
only limited means.
And how to control quality?

Granted, these attorneys will
not be the cream of the crop.
But the cases they will be in
volved in do not require the
finest skills; what they do re
quire is an adequate know
ledge of the law, a rudimentary
understanding of the legal
process and a fee small enough
to justify bringing the case. The
cases these attorneys would
handle would be small enough
that they would involve little
risk to the clients.
Moreover, without a state
mandated Bar Exam, consum
ers would no longer be lulled
into complacency by the offi
cial all attorneys
— even incompetents — pos
sess. Consumers would then
have an adequate incentive to
closely check the credentials
and reputation of attorneys.
Nor would total incompe
tents who were unable to
handle even the most simple
cases survive easily in a free,
competitive market. This type
of attorney must build up a
local reputation and gain refer
rals to survive; failure to do so
would likely yield starvation.
A compromise would be to
offer the Bar Exam as an option.
Those attorneys who wanted to
maximize their legal creden
tials could so do, and those
consumers who desire official
certification of an attorney's
skills could seek out attorneys
who had passed it. But others
would be able to make the ra
tional choice of accepting a
lesser degree of skill in the
hope of winning a case they
could not otherwise have
brought.
