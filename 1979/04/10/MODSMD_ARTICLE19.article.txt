## The 						weight room is a refuge from sexism 
### 
I feel a sex traitor writing this, and I
am especially pained to have to con
tradict Valerie Lee, whom I first saw
cleaving the water at a speed I had
thought unattainable by humankind
and have deeply admired ever since.
But, in all loyalty to my new-found
friends (and some of my best friends
are incredible hulks), I cannot let her —
and Cuardo-Lesjak's — piece, "Woman
Athletes Slighted" (Daily, April 5), go
uncontested.
I have an unblemished record of
criticizing this University, from its trus
tees on down to my immediate hierar
chical superiors, and from its foreign
and domestic policy to its employment
policy, and I have fought — and won —
several sexism grievances.
Still, fair is fair. There are two places
on campus where heaven and earth
meet to provide a halcyon retreat from
all the evils of the world and the institu
tion. One is the beautiful DeCuerre
pools where the people who run them
have found the grace to imbue a superb
facility, physically maintained as a very
taut ship, with an atmosphere of ease
and joy.
The other, somewhat less scenic, is

the weight room.
To say that "no woman feels comfort
able there" is totally false. I, for one,
simply groove on it. I find spiritual sol
ace there and, in all senses, the warm
glow of humanity straining mightily in
common endeavor. I feel wonderful
while I am there and I feel wonderful
afterwards.
The place is, to be sure, unnerving at
first glance. First, one has to cross a sort
of ante-room where spectacular speci
mens of musculature — some wearing
wide leather belts, presumably to keep
their insides from spilling— heave, with
contorted faces, some barbells
ceilingward that look as if their inadver
tent fall could crush a locomotive.
One then comes into another room
that looks like the new, improved ver
sion of the medieval torture chamber.
The noise of crashing weights and
human grunts is deafening, and the un
conquerable smell of collective sweat
defies the open door and windows. All
that is missing, surprisingly, is the
blood.
This is the place where I, largely
thanks to the people who use it, have
found bliss.

It took me a while to get up the cour
age. I had feared that I would instantly
be detected as material unsuitable for
the football squad and laughed out of
Encina Gym. Nothing could have been
farther from the truth.
I had particularly steeled myself to
meet the gawks and snickers Guardo et
al. claim greet every member of our
sex, since I am not only a woman —
admittedly a minority in the weight
room — but also about two and a half
times the age of the nearest female
runner-up. (There are absolutely no
women over 20 or so there, which is
their loss, since a few hours in the
weight room will do more for one than
a week at the Golden Door, and gratis,
too.) But I have found nothing but un
failing good manners.
I have never been given to under
stand, by word or glance, that I was any
less entitled to the use of a machine
than the owner of a 58-inch chest or
some lissome Adonis in a sweatshirt
that reads "Harvard Crew" or "I'd
rather be in Aspen."
Far from being made to feel I "do not
belong," I have, in the year that I have
now used the weight room, been ap

proached several times by men who
told me they were glad to have me
there. Since I had never thus been wel
comed to any other place on campus, I
take this, not as a tribute to my charms
but as testimony to male recognition
that the weight room should not be the
sole preserve of body-building jocks.
Guardo et al. speak of "An underly
ing spirit of tension and competition,"
and it is indeed quite possible that their
prowess on the Universals elicits such
more than mine. But I find that, though
I am the one always sneaking envious
glances at the tonnage others raise, no
one ever pays the slightest attention to
what I heave in the sweat of my brow.
When it comes to sexism and the
weight room, it seems to me it is our sex
that needs the education more.
Women have looked at me with total
incredulity or disgust when I tell them I
work out in the weight room — some, I
might add, while sporting an impres
sive amount of flab, which must qualify
them even less for the Playboy center
fold than the shrinking waist and toned
pectorals weight work can provide.

and it is indeed quite possible that their
prowess on the Universals elicits such
more than mine. But I find that, though
I am the one always sneaking envious
glances at the tonnage others raise, no
one ever pays the slightest attention to
what I heave in the sweat of my brow.
When it comes to sexism and the
weight room, it seems to me it is our sex
that needs the education more.
Women have looked at me with total
incredulity or disgust when I tell them I
work out in the weight room — some, I
might add, while sporting an impres
sive amount of flab, which must qualify
them even less for the Playboy center
fold than the shrinking waist and toned
pectorals weight work can provide.

I feel a sex traitor writing this, and I
am especially pained to have to con
tradict Valerie Lee, whom I first saw
cleaving the water at a speed I had
thought unattainable by humankind
and have deeply admired ever since.
But, in all loyalty to my new-found
friends (and some of my best friends
are incredible hulks), I cannot let her —
and Cuardo-Lesjak's — piece, "Woman
Athletes Slighted" (Daily, April 5), go
uncontested.
I have an unblemished record of
criticizing this University, from its trus
tees on down to my immediate hierar
chical superiors, and from its foreign
and domestic policy to its employment
policy, and I have fought — and won —
several sexism grievances.
Still, fair is fair. There are two places
on campus where heaven and earth
meet to provide a halcyon retreat from
all the evils of the world and the institu
tion. One is the beautiful DeCuerre
pools where the people who run them
have found the grace to imbue a superb
facility, physically maintained as a very
taut ship, with an atmosphere of ease
and joy.
The other, somewhat less scenic, is

the weight room.
To say that "no woman feels comfort
able there" is totally false. I, for one,
simply groove on it. I find spiritual sol
ace there and, in all senses, the warm
glow of humanity straining mightily in
common endeavor. I feel wonderful
while I am there and I feel wonderful
afterwards.
The place is, to be sure, unnerving at
first glance. First, one has to cross a sort
of ante-room where spectacular speci
mens of musculature — some wearing
wide leather belts, presumably to keep
their insides from spilling— heave, with
contorted faces, some barbells
ceilingward that look as if their inadver
tent fall could crush a locomotive.
One then comes into another room
that looks like the new, improved ver
sion of the medieval torture chamber.
The noise of crashing weights and
human grunts is deafening, and the un
conquerable smell of collective sweat
defies the open door and windows. All
that is missing, surprisingly, is the
blood.
This is the place where I, largely
thanks to the people who use it, have
found bliss.

It took me a while to get up the cour
age. I had feared that I would instantly
be detected as material unsuitable for
the football squad and laughed out of
Encina Gym. Nothing could have been
farther from the truth.
I had particularly steeled myself to
meet the gawks and snickers Guardo et
al. claim greet every member of our
sex, since I am not only a woman —
admittedly a minority in the weight
room — but also about two and a half
times the age of the nearest female
runner-up. (There are absolutely no
women over 20 or so there, which is
their loss, since a few hours in the
weight room will do more for one than
a week at the Golden Door, and gratis,
too.) But I have found nothing but un
failing good manners.
I have never been given to under
stand, by word or glance, that I was any
less entitled to the use of a machine
than the owner of a 58-inch chest or
some lissome Adonis in a sweatshirt
that reads "Harvard Crew" or "I'd
rather be in Aspen."
Far from being made to feel I "do not
belong," I have, in the year that I have
now used the weight room, been ap

proached several times by men who
told me they were glad to have me
there. Since I had never thus been wel
comed to any other place on campus, I
take this, not as a tribute to my charms
but as testimony to male recognition
that the weight room should not be the
sole preserve of body-building jocks.
Guardo et al. speak of "An underly
ing spirit of tension and competition,"
and it is indeed quite possible that their
prowess on the Universals elicits such
more than mine. But I find that, though
I am the one always sneaking envious
glances at the tonnage others raise, no
one ever pays the slightest attention to
what I heave in the sweat of my brow.
