# Dorm plan advances
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Plans for adding some 800 student
spaces to the University housing sys
tem were advanced last week with
the disclosure that the Advisory
Committee on New Residences has
narrowed to three the list of architec
tural firms being considered for re
commendation to the Board of Trus
tees.
The advisory committee has also
formulated "very tentative" plans for
the configuration of the 800 resi
dence spaces which would include a
few row houses, a large dormitory,
and a small number of buildings con
taining suites, according to Sally
Cole, director of research in the Stu
dent Affairs office and a member of
the committee.
Cole, who is also a member of a
subcommittee on architect selec
tion, said the number of potential ar
chitects was narrowed from six to
three over the spring break, and that
these three firms would be further
interviewed on campus April 23.
After these "more specialized pre
sentations," Cole said, it is very likely
that the sub-committee will make its
final choice in a matter of days.
While it is possible that architec
tural responsibilities might be split
among two or even all three of the
firms, it is probable that only one will
be chosen, according to both Cole
and fames Lyons, dean of student af
fairs.
Comprised of 10 administration
members and 10 students, the com
mittee is charged with making re
commendations to the trustees on
the new residences which are ex
pected to be completed by or near
the beginning of the 1982-83
academic year. Configuration plans
are still tentative, emphasized Norm
Robinson, associate dean for resi
dential education and chairman of
the committee. "We're trying to de
cide in words, not drawings," Robin
son said.
If a recommendation for an ar
chitect is made this spring and ap
proved by the trustees, the commit
tee will begin to draw up more defi
nite plans in consultation with the
architect. These recommendations,
if approved by the board after finan
cial considerations, will be the basis
for construction of the new resi
dences here.
Lyons said that although this pro

cess could take several months, if all
goes well the University could begin
accepting bids on construction by
the middle of the coming academic
year.
The committee has deemed it im
portant that there be a mix in the type
of residence facilities offered by the
University, including a substantial
number of suites and apartments.
Current plans being discussed
would allocate some 150 to 200
spaces in a small number (three to
five) of row houses. About 300 to 350
spaces would be taken up by a
number of smaller contiguous
houses within a large complex,
rather than one large building. The
plan is similar to the configuration of
dormitories within Lagunita Cciurt,
Robinson said.
Although a number of locations for
this large dormitory are being consi
dered and there is a possibility of
split construction, Robinson said
that the field beyond the Lagunita
parking lot is the "primary site being
considered."
Lyons said that he was "enthusias
tic" about row houses because their
smaller size and independent opera
tion is conducive to the establish
ment of theme houses. But, he said,
"if we can accommodate themes
elsewhere (e.g. within a dormitory)
and the themes don't need a kitchen,
then we might not need so many row
houses."
A row house is a free-standing
building (unattached to any larger
complex) with its own common
facilities, such as a kitchen and a din
ing room, Lyons said.
He also said that the demand by
special groups for new houses could
be met by the exodus of students
from certain houses once more at
tractive residence spaces become
available. He said that certain frater
nities and co-ops may have to dis
band after there are more housing
alternatives, because "students
(now) are choosing frats (and other
row houses) as places to live rather
than organizations to belong to.
Sometimes frats are seen as an alter
native to living off campus."
Some problems would remain
with the selection of the land beyond
Lagunita for a new residence. Al
though it is "the biggest site we've
got," Cole said there are problems
with parking and with drainage be
cause the land is so close to the lake.
The committee has batted around
the idea of underground parking,
which Cole said would be very ex
pensive. The area could be expanded
over onto the current site of the driv
ing range of the golf course.
Lyons said that while the Univer
sity is "targeting" at construction of
the 800 spaces, "it doesn't hold that
we'll get them all at once." The fi
nancial implications of the plans will
be scrutinized by both the office of
the vice president for business and

finances and by the trustees.
Money spent must be justified,
Lyons said, because "almost surely
we're talking about debt."
Under the plans, there will proba
bly be an increase of only about 400
spaces for undergraduates, as the
450 spaces provided now by the
Manzanita trailer park would be allo
cated almost exclusively to single
graduate students, who would prefer
the apartment style of the trailers.
However, about 100 students indi
cated Manzanita as a first choice in
the housing draw last spring.

be scrutinized by both the office of
the vice president for business and

finances and by the trustees.
Money spent must be justified,
Lyons said, because "almost surely
we're talking about debt."
Under the plans, there will proba
bly be an increase of only about 400
spaces for undergraduates, as the
450 spaces provided now by the
Manzanita trailer park would be allo
cated almost exclusively to single
graduate students, who would prefer
the apartment style of the trailers.
However, about 100 students indi
cated Manzanita as a first choice in
the housing draw last spring.
Plans for adding some 800 student
spaces to the University housing sys
tem were advanced last week with
the disclosure that the Advisory
Committee on New Residences has
narrowed to three the list of architec
tural firms being considered for re
commendation to the Board of Trus
tees.
The advisory committee has also
formulated "very tentative" plans for
the configuration of the 800 resi
dence spaces which would include a
few row houses, a large dormitory,
and a small number of buildings con
taining suites, according to Sally
Cole, director of research in the Stu
dent Affairs office and a member of
the committee.
Cole, who is also a member of a
subcommittee on architect selec
tion, said the number of potential ar
chitects was narrowed from six to
three over the spring break, and that
these three firms would be further
interviewed on campus April 23.
After these "more specialized pre
sentations," Cole said, it is very likely
that the sub-committee will make its
final choice in a matter of days.
While it is possible that architec
tural responsibilities might be split
among two or even all three of the
firms, it is probable that only one will
be chosen, according to both Cole
and fames Lyons, dean of student af
fairs.
Comprised of 10 administration
members and 10 students, the com
mittee is charged with making re
commendations to the trustees on
the new residences which are ex
pected to be completed by or near
the beginning of the 1982-83
academic year. Configuration plans
are still tentative, emphasized Norm
Robinson, associate dean for resi
dential education and chairman of
the committee. "We're trying to de
cide in words, not drawings," Robin
son said.
If a recommendation for an ar
chitect is made this spring and ap
proved by the trustees, the commit
tee will begin to draw up more defi
nite plans in consultation with the
architect. These recommendations,
if approved by the board after finan
cial considerations, will be the basis
for construction of the new resi
dences here.
Lyons said that although this pro

cess could take several months, if all
goes well the University could begin
accepting bids on construction by
the middle of the coming academic
year.
The committee has deemed it im
portant that there be a mix in the type
of residence facilities offered by the
University, including a substantial
number of suites and apartments.
Current plans being discussed
would allocate some 150 to 200
spaces in a small number (three to
five) of row houses. About 300 to 350
spaces would be taken up by a
number of smaller contiguous
houses within a large complex,
rather than one large building. The
plan is similar to the configuration of
dormitories within Lagunita Cciurt,
Robinson said.
Although a number of locations for
this large dormitory are being consi
dered and there is a possibility of
split construction, Robinson said
that the field beyond the Lagunita
parking lot is the "primary site being
considered."
Lyons said that he was "enthusias
tic" about row houses because their
smaller size and independent opera
tion is conducive to the establish
ment of theme houses. But, he said,
"if we can accommodate themes
elsewhere (e.g. within a dormitory)
and the themes don't need a kitchen,
then we might not need so many row
houses."
A row house is a free-standing
building (unattached to any larger
complex) with its own common
facilities, such as a kitchen and a din
ing room, Lyons said.
He also said that the demand by
special groups for new houses could
be met by the exodus of students
from certain houses once more at
tractive residence spaces become
available. He said that certain frater
nities and co-ops may have to dis
band after there are more housing
alternatives, because "students
(now) are choosing frats (and other
row houses) as places to live rather
than organizations to belong to.
Sometimes frats are seen as an alter
native to living off campus."
Some problems would remain
with the selection of the land beyond
Lagunita for a new residence. Al
though it is "the biggest site we've
got," Cole said there are problems
with parking and with drainage be
cause the land is so close to the lake.
The committee has batted around
the idea of underground parking,
which Cole said would be very ex
pensive. The area could be expanded
over onto the current site of the driv
ing range of the golf course.
Lyons said that while the Univer
sity is "targeting" at construction of
the 800 spaces, "it doesn't hold that
we'll get them all at once." The fi
nancial implications of the plans will
be scrutinized by both the office of
the vice president for business and

finances and by the trustees.
