housing available through the
University draw. Tomorrow,
other housing options will be
examined.)

Although dormitories here
may seem similar in appear
ance and in living styles, they
actually vary to a considerable
degree. It is these differing at
mospheres and living condi
tions that attract students to
the six four-class dorm com
plexes on campus, which in
clude Florence Moore, Roble,
Lagunita, Stern, Wilbur and
Toyon.
Florence Moore Hall, with
four four-class and four
freshman dorms, consists
mostly of double rooms with a
few singles, triples and quads.
"Flo Mo is closer to my ideal
for a dorm than the other
dorms I've seen," resident
Mark Borowasky said. "It
doesn't have the 'hotelish' feel
ing that you get in other
dorms."
Students in Flo Mo identified
as advantages the unusual
unity existing between the
houses and the comparatively

high number of projects that
involve the whole dorm.
jack Trumpbour, a Loro resi
dent, commented on the per
sonalities of the different
houses. "The people in Car
denal and Faisan are more in
terested in studying. Mirlo and
Loro have reputations as being
the rowdier of the four-class
dorms."
Satisfied
The social life offered at Flo
Mo seems to satisfy most of the
residents. House Associate
(RA) Claudia Baker explained,
"Though the social activities of
each house tend to vary, I
wouldn't say the complex as a
whole is quiet."
Roble Hall, also situated near
Lake Lagunita, was described
by some as "too removed" and
by others as "ideal." It houses
281 students and contains 10
upper-class triples and four
upper-class doubles and over
100 single rooms.
Dave Blanchard, an RA at
Roble, said that the social life
has been particularly good this
year. "In the past, people have
been drawn to Roble who have
a lot of outside interests and
this weakened social unity, but

this has had less influence this
year."
Sophomore John Lamb said
he was intimidated at first by
Roble's size, but eventually
found it to be an advantage be
cause of the chance to meet so
many people. In regard to the
social life, he said "most dorms
arewhatyou makethem. If you
want to get rowdy, heck,
maybe someone will joinyou."
Blanchard named many of
the physical advantages of liv
ing in Roble. "We have a canoe
so there's always the possibility
of taking midnight canoe
rides," he said with a smile.
"Our sundeck is also very
popular."
Lagunita is next to Roble and
was praised highly for its beaut
iful setting. The five houses
enclose a grassy, inner cour
tyard which attracts many stu
dents during the sunny
months. Most of the rooms in
Lagunita are singles, and, of
particular interest is Granada,
the house with the highest
percentage of single rooms for
upperclassmen in the housing
system. There are only two
large doubles and the remain

der of the rooms are singles.
Jeanine Valadez, a second
year resident of Lag, points to
the high draw numbers
needed to get into Lagunita as
proof of its desirability. "I think
it's the optimum dorm," she
said. "I like the smaller houses,
and if you make an effort, you
can really become a part of
your dorm. Of course it's easy
to be isolated with all the sing
les, but it's up to you."
She classified it as a quiet
atmosphere with the exception
of the dining hall which is very
noisy. All Lagunita residents
meet in a huge central dining
hall for meals which Valadez
said contributes to the close
ness of the houses.
Tom Tolles, a resident of
Granada, named "the high
chance of a single, Roble field
and Lake Lag" as the biggest
advantages of the dorm.
"However," he added, "you
can't rely on it for your social
activity."
Sinks
Lagunita has the added ad
vantage of sinks in each room.
Rooms in Toyon and Roble also
have sinks.

Stern Hall is praised for its
proximity to the center of cam
pus and the athletic fields.
Contrary to many rumors
concerning the Stern food
service, freshman Bruce
Hedges said, "I don't think the
food here is that much diffe
rent. Of course that is not
necessarily a compliment."
Lack of unity
"There's not a whole lot of
unity," resident David Frank
explained. "With the disper
sion of classes, you have a lot
of people doing separate
things. A lot of people stay
here for a quarter and then
move out."
A resident of Serra described
the atmosphere as quiet and
more conducive to studying.
"But it's still really social," she
said, "because most people
have learned the philosophy of
live hard, play hard."
Wilbur Hall is next to Stern.
Very similar to Stern, it consists
of eight houses with most
rooms single-room doubles.
Mary Ward, an RA in Otero,

said "some people complain
about the large houses, but it's
much easier to get together
and do things."
Toyon Hall could be easily
mistaken for a medieval struc
ture with its imposing towers,
stone columns and curling
stairways. There are 14 singles
in Toyon, but most of the
rooms are spacious two-room
triples.
RA Ann Jennings praised the
character of the dorm and said,
"it makes me feel like putting
down roots for the first time."
In describing the atmosphere
of the dorm, she mentioned
the abundance of enthusiasm
and activity. "I think people
tend to expect an extremely
theater-oriented dorm, but it is
really much morediverse," she
said. "Though there is em
phasis on drama, it is not that
heavy."
One advantage recognized
by many Toyon residents is the
eating club system. Toyon is
the only dorm without Univer
sity food service, so students

are guaranteed membership in
one of the five student-run eat
ing clubs.
Ann Ezra, president of El
Cuadro, named the 24-hour
snacking privileges as the eat
ing clubs' big edge over dorm
food service. "There is also a
big advantage in having access
to a stove and club supplies,"
Ezra said. "Also, besides just
eating with people in your
dorm, you get exposure to
people who live off campus or
in the trailers who have joined
the clubs." Ezra described the
clubs as centers of social ac
tivities.
As the draw approaches and
the anxiety concerning next
year's housing mounts, it is
important to remember that no
matter how desirable your liv
ing conditions are, it is the
people who surround you that
make the difference. "You're
happy when you're living with
good people," Lamb said;
"and the Stanford student
body is a group of good
people."

Lagunita Court, consisting of five four-class dorms, is praised for its beautiful setting. In addition, it has
the highest percentage of singles of any dorm complex. All residents eat in one central dining hall.
(Editor's Note: The following
story is the first of a series on
housing available through the
University draw. Tomorrow,
other housing options will be
examined.)

Although dormitories here
may seem similar in appear
ance and in living styles, they
actually vary to a considerable
degree. It is these differing at
mospheres and living condi
tions that attract students to
the six four-class dorm com
plexes on campus, which in
clude Florence Moore, Roble,
Lagunita, Stern, Wilbur and
Toyon.
Florence Moore Hall, with
four four-class and four
freshman dorms, consists
mostly of double rooms with a
few singles, triples and quads.
"Flo Mo is closer to my ideal
for a dorm than the other
dorms I've seen," resident
Mark Borowasky said. "It
doesn't have the 'hotelish' feel
ing that you get in other
dorms."
Students in Flo Mo identified
as advantages the unusual
unity existing between the
houses and the comparatively

high number of projects that
involve the whole dorm.
jack Trumpbour, a Loro resi
dent, commented on the per
sonalities of the different
houses. "The people in Car
denal and Faisan are more in
terested in studying. Mirlo and
Loro have reputations as being
the rowdier of the four-class
dorms."
Satisfied
The social life offered at Flo
Mo seems to satisfy most of the
residents. House Associate
(RA) Claudia Baker explained,
"Though the social activities of
each house tend to vary, I
wouldn't say the complex as a
whole is quiet."
Roble Hall, also situated near
Lake Lagunita, was described
by some as "too removed" and
by others as "ideal." It houses
281 students and contains 10
upper-class triples and four
upper-class doubles and over
100 single rooms.
Dave Blanchard, an RA at
Roble, said that the social life
has been particularly good this
year. "In the past, people have
been drawn to Roble who have
a lot of outside interests and
this weakened social unity, but

this has had less influence this
year."
Sophomore John Lamb said
he was intimidated at first by
Roble's size, but eventually
found it to be an advantage be
cause of the chance to meet so
many people. In regard to the
social life, he said "most dorms
arewhatyou makethem. If you
want to get rowdy, heck,
maybe someone will joinyou."
Blanchard named many of
the physical advantages of liv
ing in Roble. "We have a canoe
so there's always the possibility
of taking midnight canoe
rides," he said with a smile.
"Our sundeck is also very
popular."
Lagunita is next to Roble and
was praised highly for its beaut
iful setting. The five houses
enclose a grassy, inner cour
tyard which attracts many stu
dents during the sunny
months. Most of the rooms in
Lagunita are singles, and, of
particular interest is Granada,
the house with the highest
percentage of single rooms for
upperclassmen in the housing
system. There are only two
large doubles and the remain

der of the rooms are singles.
Jeanine Valadez, a second
year resident of Lag, points to
the high draw numbers
needed to get into Lagunita as
proof of its desirability. "I think
it's the optimum dorm," she
said. "I like the smaller houses,
and if you make an effort, you
can really become a part of
your dorm. Of course it's easy
to be isolated with all the sing
les, but it's up to you."
She classified it as a quiet
atmosphere with the exception
of the dining hall which is very
noisy. All Lagunita residents
meet in a huge central dining
hall for meals which Valadez
said contributes to the close
ness of the houses.
Tom Tolles, a resident of
Granada, named "the high
chance of a single, Roble field
and Lake Lag" as the biggest
advantages of the dorm.
"However," he added, "you
can't rely on it for your social
activity."
Sinks
Lagunita has the added ad
vantage of sinks in each room.
Rooms in Toyon and Roble also
have sinks.

Stern Hall is praised for its
proximity to the center of cam
pus and the athletic fields.
Contrary to many rumors
concerning the Stern food
service, freshman Bruce
Hedges said, "I don't think the
food here is that much diffe
rent. Of course that is not
necessarily a compliment."
Lack of unity
"There's not a whole lot of
unity," resident David Frank
explained. "With the disper
sion of classes, you have a lot
of people doing separate
things. A lot of people stay
here for a quarter and then
move out."
A resident of Serra described
the atmosphere as quiet and
more conducive to studying.
"But it's still really social," she
said, "because most people
have learned the philosophy of
live hard, play hard."
Wilbur Hall is next to Stern.
Very similar to Stern, it consists
of eight houses with most
rooms single-room doubles.
Mary Ward, an RA in Otero,

said "some people complain
about the large houses, but it's
much easier to get together
and do things."
Toyon Hall could be easily
mistaken for a medieval struc
ture with its imposing towers,
stone columns and curling
stairways. There are 14 singles
in Toyon, but most of the
rooms are spacious two-room
triples.
RA Ann Jennings praised the
character of the dorm and said,
"it makes me feel like putting
down roots for the first time."
In describing the atmosphere
of the dorm, she mentioned
the abundance of enthusiasm
and activity. "I think people
tend to expect an extremely
theater-oriented dorm, but it is
really much morediverse," she
said. "Though there is em
phasis on drama, it is not that
heavy."
One advantage recognized
by many Toyon residents is the
eating club system. Toyon is
the only dorm without Univer
sity food service, so students

are guaranteed membership in
one of the five student-run eat
ing clubs.
Ann Ezra, president of El
Cuadro, named the 24-hour
snacking privileges as the eat
ing clubs' big edge over dorm
food service. "There is also a
big advantage in having access
to a stove and club supplies,"
Ezra said. "Also, besides just
eating with people in your
dorm, you get exposure to
people who live off campus or
in the trailers who have joined
the clubs." Ezra described the
clubs as centers of social ac
tivities.
As the draw approaches and
the anxiety concerning next
year's housing mounts, it is
important to remember that no
matter how desirable your liv
ing conditions are, it is the
people who surround you that
make the difference. "You're
happy when you're living with
good people," Lamb said;
"and the Stanford student
body is a group of good
people."

(Editor's Note: The following
story is the first of a series on
housing available through the
University draw. Tomorrow,
other housing options will be
examined.)

Although dormitories here
may seem similar in appear
ance and in living styles, they
actually vary to a considerable
degree. It is these differing at
mospheres and living condi
tions that attract students to
the six four-class dorm com
plexes on campus, which in
clude Florence Moore, Roble,
Lagunita, Stern, Wilbur and
Toyon.
Florence Moore Hall, with
four four-class and four
freshman dorms, consists
mostly of double rooms with a
few singles, triples and quads.
"Flo Mo is closer to my ideal
for a dorm than the other
dorms I've seen," resident
Mark Borowasky said. "It
doesn't have the 'hotelish' feel
ing that you get in other
dorms."
Students in Flo Mo identified
as advantages the unusual
unity existing between the
houses and the comparatively

high number of projects that
involve the whole dorm.
jack Trumpbour, a Loro resi
dent, commented on the per
sonalities of the different
houses. "The people in Car
denal and Faisan are more in
terested in studying. Mirlo and
Loro have reputations as being
the rowdier of the four-class
dorms."
Satisfied
The social life offered at Flo
Mo seems to satisfy most of the
residents. House Associate
(RA) Claudia Baker explained,
"Though the social activities of
each house tend to vary, I
wouldn't say the complex as a
whole is quiet."
Roble Hall, also situated near
Lake Lagunita, was described
by some as "too removed" and
by others as "ideal." It houses
281 students and contains 10
upper-class triples and four
upper-class doubles and over
100 single rooms.
Dave Blanchard, an RA at
Roble, said that the social life
has been particularly good this
year. "In the past, people have
been drawn to Roble who have
a lot of outside interests and
this weakened social unity, but

this has had less influence this
year."
Sophomore John Lamb said
he was intimidated at first by
Roble's size, but eventually
found it to be an advantage be
cause of the chance to meet so
many people. In regard to the
social life, he said "most dorms
arewhatyou makethem. If you
want to get rowdy, heck,
maybe someone will joinyou."
Blanchard named many of
the physical advantages of liv
ing in Roble. "We have a canoe
so there's always the possibility
of taking midnight canoe
rides," he said with a smile.
"Our sundeck is also very
popular."
Lagunita is next to Roble and
was praised highly for its beaut
iful setting. The five houses
enclose a grassy, inner cour
tyard which attracts many stu
dents during the sunny
months. Most of the rooms in
Lagunita are singles, and, of
particular interest is Granada,
the house with the highest
percentage of single rooms for
upperclassmen in the housing
system. There are only two
large doubles and the remain

der of the rooms are singles.
Jeanine Valadez, a second
year resident of Lag, points to
the high draw numbers
needed to get into Lagunita as
proof of its desirability. "I think
it's the optimum dorm," she
said. "I like the smaller houses,
and if you make an effort, you
can really become a part of
your dorm. Of course it's easy
to be isolated with all the sing
les, but it's up to you."
She classified it as a quiet
atmosphere with the exception
of the dining hall which is very
noisy. All Lagunita residents
meet in a huge central dining
hall for meals which Valadez
said contributes to the close
ness of the houses.
Tom Tolles, a resident of
Granada, named "the high
chance of a single, Roble field
and Lake Lag" as the biggest
advantages of the dorm.
"However," he added, "you
can't rely on it for your social
activity."
Sinks
Lagunita has the added ad
vantage of sinks in each room.
Rooms in Toyon and Roble also
have sinks.

Stern Hall is praised for its
proximity to the center of cam
pus and the athletic fields.
Contrary to many rumors
concerning the Stern food
service, freshman Bruce
Hedges said, "I don't think the
food here is that much diffe
rent. Of course that is not
necessarily a compliment."
Lack of unity
"There's not a whole lot of
unity," resident David Frank
explained. "With the disper
sion of classes, you have a lot
of people doing separate
things. A lot of people stay
here for a quarter and then
move out."
A resident of Serra described
the atmosphere as quiet and
more conducive to studying.
"But it's still really social," she
said, "because most people
have learned the philosophy of
live hard, play hard."
Wilbur Hall is next to Stern.
Very similar to Stern, it consists
of eight houses with most
rooms single-room doubles.
Mary Ward, an RA in Otero,

said "some people complain
about the large houses, but it's
much easier to get together
and do things."
Toyon Hall could be easily
mistaken for a medieval struc
ture with its imposing towers,
stone columns and curling
stairways. There are 14 singles
in Toyon, but most of the
rooms are spacious two-room
triples.
RA Ann Jennings praised the
character of the dorm and said,
"it makes me feel like putting
down roots for the first time."
In describing the atmosphere
of the dorm, she mentioned
the abundance of enthusiasm
and activity. "I think people
tend to expect an extremely
theater-oriented dorm, but it is
really much morediverse," she
said. "Though there is em
phasis on drama, it is not that
heavy."
One advantage recognized
by many Toyon residents is the
eating club system. Toyon is
the only dorm without Univer
sity food service, so students

are guaranteed membership in
one of the five student-run eat
ing clubs.
Ann Ezra, president of El
Cuadro, named the 24-hour
snacking privileges as the eat
ing clubs' big edge over dorm
food service. "There is also a
big advantage in having access
to a stove and club supplies,"
Ezra said. "Also, besides just
eating with people in your
dorm, you get exposure to
people who live off campus or
in the trailers who have joined
the clubs." Ezra described the
clubs as centers of social ac
tivities.
As the draw approaches and
the anxiety concerning next
year's housing mounts, it is
important to remember that no
matter how desirable your liv
ing conditions are, it is the
people who surround you that
make the difference. "You're
happy when you're living with
good people," Lamb said;
"and the Stanford student
body is a group of good
people."
