# Housing draw approaching
## 
### Andrew Rich 
Students planning to enter the housing
draw next week are faced with over 50
choices. These range from the new row
houses, such as 558 Mayfield, to older dorms,
such as Roble; from single-sex houses to
coed-by-corridor environments; and from
co-op to self-op to University-op.
Narrowing down the 50 alternatives to your
top eight choices can be difficult, especially
with the limited information available about
each house in the Draw Book. Ideally, the
solution is to "visit the houses you think
you'd be interested in," said Assoc. Dean of
Residential Education Norm Robinson.
"People should be doing this throughout the
year," he added.
Unfortunately, the draw is already under
way and probably most people have waited
until this week to begin considering their
prospects for on-campus housing next year.
One quick way of choosing houses has al
ways been to list the most popular ones, rely
ing on the past preferences of the overall
student body. But this often leads to disap
pointments, because, as Robinson said in re
gard to the popular houses, "people have
unreal expectations." The best way to choose
a house, he said, is to first decide "what's
important to you in a residential situation."
Choices might take into consideration the
size of the house; the University has
personal-sized residences with as few as 25
inhabitants, and community-sized dorms
with as many as 280. There are four-class
dorms, apartments, ethnic theme houses,

special priority houses and of course the
trailers all offering their own particular varia
tion of the "Stanford experience."
Though "houses go through cycles," ac
cording to Robinson, the most often re
quested houses in last year's draw were the
row houses and the Cowell cluster; the least
requested were the individual dorms in Stern
and Wilbur, and a couple of the co-ops.
This tremendous diversity in both type of
house and in demand for houses leads to a
great deal of mobility in the housing system.
At the beginning of this academic year, for
example, there were close to 1000 students
still on waiting lists. Of these, 438 were stu
dents who had not been assigned at all in the
spring draw, and 487 were students with as
signments, wishing to be reassigned to a dif
ferent house.
By the end of the first quarter, the size of
the waiting list diminishes substantially, and
although some houses have long waiting lists
all year, Jean Kitaji, Housing Office super
visor, said there are housing vacancies by
winter quarter.
The purpose of the Draw, after all, is to
"allocate a scarce resource — housing — to
students in a fair and equitable manner," ac
cording to a publication of the Residential
Education Office. Obviously, every student
cannot be put into 558 Mayfield or Lambda
Nu. But there is more to a house than
its facilities, age or food. As Robinson
said, students should look less at what the
house itself offers, and think more about
"what they feel they can bring to the house."
