Breakfast in America
Supertramp
A&M Records
Breakfast in America seems
to be quite an appropriate title
for Supertramp's latest album
because, as proven by Thurs
day night'sconcert in Oakland,
the sun is definitely rising on
the group's popular success.
With the release of its most
commercially successful LP,
new followers have joined the
many cult-like, die-hard fans
from the past to support Super
tramp.
The question that must have
been lurking in the minds of
the band's perennial fans was
"Will the commercial exposure
hurt the group's innovative ex
cellence?" Unlike Peter
Frampton, E.L.O. et al., Super
tramp has forgotten neither its
roots nor its faithful followers.
A rock band with such a con
science is hard to find these
days.

Canning the conventional
mode of starting the show with
a hit off the new album, the
band commenced the evening
with its classic opener
"School." One could hear the
sighs of relief mingled with
applause as the first, so distin
guishable waning notes of the
harmonica filled the dark
arena. Supertramp hadn't let
us down! The band's vision
hadn't been blurred by dollar
signs.
Lively brew
The Anglo-American quintet
(now Los Angeles residents)
performed a 22 song, 2V2-hour
show that highlighted its finest
qualities. The band's lively
brew of folk, progressive and
pop elements features a win
some melodiousness and a
deep, richly textured canvas.
The music hits a sprightly
stride, most often with a
catchy, double-time keyboard
pattern that dissolves into all
out instrumental excursions
whose jazz and classical
touches recall Traffic and Pro
col Harum.
The theme that emerged
most prominently in the
group's effectively enigmatic
lyrics was one of innocence
corrupted. From the old classic
"School" to the newly popular
"Logical Song," the biting,
ironical look at this society's
lifestyle is strikingly effective.
Sometimes a mildly humorous
method is utilized, as in
"Asylum" and "Breakfast in
America."
Self-confidence
Supertramp's set in
terspersed pieces from Crime
of the Century — still its most
consistent work — with more
recent material. In fact, the
band played the entire Crime
LP while performing only five
of the latest 10 songs. That in

itself shows Supertramp's in
tegrity and self-confidence.
Unlike many of today's enter
tainers, the band is composed
of true performers, not sales
men pushing a new commod
ity.
The group blends the preci
sion instrumentation of
Genesis, the tight stage show
of Pink Floyd, the pop accessi
bility of Fleetwood Mac and
then adds its own touches of
personality and humor to en
dear itself — not just its music
— to the audience. From "Hide
in Your Shell" to "Dreamer" to
its magnum opus "Fool's Over
ture," the technical quality of
the music was not diminished
but rather enhanced by the live
performance.
Visually intense
Utilizing the finest visual ef
fects I've seen since Pink Floyd,
the show didn't become ob
sessed with wowing its audi
ence with wizardry but by
complementing such visually
intense songs as "Rudy,"
"Crime of the Century," and
"Fool's Overture."
Roger Hodgson and Rick
Davies provide vocal balance
comparable to Graham Nash
and David Crosby. Hodgson's
mellifluous, higher-pitched
voice champions the
acoustic-based love songs
while Davies counters with a
gruffer voice and a somewhat
devilish sensibility.
As the two were singing the
final line from "If Everyone
Was Listening," surely all of
the near-capacity Oakland
crowd vehemently agreed:
"Oh, no, please no, don't let
the curtain fall. . . ."There will
be much more heard from
Supertramp. Although five
years old, their day is just
dawning. And you can bet that
I'm bloody well right!

itself shows Supertramp's in
tegrity and self-confidence.
Unlike many of today's enter
tainers, the band is composed
of true performers, not sales
men pushing a new commod
ity.
The group blends the preci
sion instrumentation of
Genesis, the tight stage show
of Pink Floyd, the pop accessi

then adds its own touches of
personality and humor to en
dear itself — not just its music
— to the audience. From "Hide
in Your Shell" to "Dreamer" to
its magnum opus "Fool's Over
ture," the technical quality of
the music was not diminished
but rather enhanced by the live
performance.
Visually intense
Utilizing the finest visual ef
fects I've seen since Pink Floyd,
the show didn't become ob
sessed with wowing its audi
ence with wizardry but by
complementing such visually
intense songs as "Rudy,"
"Crime of the Century," and
"Fool's Overture."
Roger Hodgson and Rick
Davies provide vocal balance
comparable to Graham Nash
and David Crosby. Hodgson's
mellifluous, higher-pitched
voice champions the
acoustic-based love songs
while Davies counters with a
gruffer voice and a somewhat
devilish sensibility.
As the two were singing the
final line from "If Everyone
Was Listening," surely all of
the near-capacity Oakland
crowd vehemently agreed:
"Oh, no, please no, don't let
the curtain fall. . . ."There will
be much more heard from
Supertramp. Although five
years old, their day is just
dawning. And you can bet that
I'm bloody well right!

Breakfast in America
Supertramp
A&M Records
Breakfast in America seems
to be quite an appropriate title
for Supertramp's latest album
because, as proven by Thurs
day night'sconcert in Oakland,
the sun is definitely rising on
the group's popular success.
With the release of its most
commercially successful LP,
new followers have joined the
many cult-like, die-hard fans
from the past to support Super
tramp.
The question that must have
been lurking in the minds of
the band's perennial fans was
"Will the commercial exposure
hurt the group's innovative ex
cellence?" Unlike Peter
Frampton, E.L.O. et al., Super
tramp has forgotten neither its
roots nor its faithful followers.
A rock band with such a con
science is hard to find these
days.

Canning the conventional
mode of starting the show with
a hit off the new album, the
band commenced the evening
with its classic opener
"School." One could hear the
sighs of relief mingled with
applause as the first, so distin
guishable waning notes of the
harmonica filled the dark
arena. Supertramp hadn't let
us down! The band's vision
hadn't been blurred by dollar
signs.
Lively brew
The Anglo-American quintet
(now Los Angeles residents)
performed a 22 song, 2V2-hour
show that highlighted its finest
qualities. The band's lively
brew of folk, progressive and
pop elements features a win
some melodiousness and a
deep, richly textured canvas.
The music hits a sprightly
stride, most often with a
catchy, double-time keyboard
pattern that dissolves into all
out instrumental excursions
whose jazz and classical
touches recall Traffic and Pro
col Harum.
The theme that emerged
most prominently in the
group's effectively enigmatic
lyrics was one of innocence
corrupted. From the old classic
"School" to the newly popular
"Logical Song," the biting,
ironical look at this society's
lifestyle is strikingly effective.
Sometimes a mildly humorous
method is utilized, as in
"Asylum" and "Breakfast in
America."
Self-confidence
Supertramp's set in
terspersed pieces from Crime
of the Century — still its most
consistent work — with more
recent material. In fact, the
band played the entire Crime
LP while performing only five
of the latest 10 songs. That in

itself shows Supertramp's in
tegrity and self-confidence.
Unlike many of today's enter
tainers, the band is composed
of true performers, not sales
men pushing a new commod
ity.
The group blends the preci
