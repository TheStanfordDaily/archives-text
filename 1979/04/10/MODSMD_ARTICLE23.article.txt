## Gillespie aging with style 
### 
Lively Arts scored another
coup with their presentation of
Dizzy Gillespie at Memorial
Auditorium. Gillespie is one of
the few remaining legendary
figures in jazz; the modern
tradition in jazz trumpet play
ing stems from Dizzy; at his
Stanford concert Gillespie
showed that he still had a lot to
teach younger musicians.
It is impossible to deny that
Dizzy's technique has suffered
during the past decade. Any
trumpeter who blows consis
tently for four decades is
bound to show the wear and
tear on his lip. The amazing
thing, however, is how Dizzy
has offset this problem.
Twenty years ago Dizzy was all
technique — hitting soaring
high notes and tonguing fast
double-time passages. Instead
the Dizzy of recent years has
come to rely increasingly on
his tone. The biting attack of
the past has been replaced by a
warm and rich, very human
tone.
Dizzy has begun to sound
more and more like Miles
Davis every year. There is a
good deal of irony in this. Miles

developed his own melodic
style because he couldn't play
like Dizzy — he simply did not
have the technique. Two de
cades later the tables are
turned; Dizzy's chops are
gone, and his tone must carry
him through.
In many waysGillespie's new
style is even more intense than
before. The powerful and vib
rant way in which he plays bal
lads is truly moving. The
rhythmic control is absolutely
stunning. Few laymen realize
that it is in many ways more
difficult to play a slow number
than a fast one.
I daresay that Gillespie still
has the best sense of time in
jazz today. His long willowy
phrases bob up and down bet
ween the beats like a swimmer
coming up for air.
Gillespie's group is a con
cession to modern tastes. His
guitarist — no pianist to be
found — sounds, looks and
acts like a cross between
George Benson and Wes
Montgomery. Still he is re
markably listenable and ex
tremely fluent. Ed Cherry is his

name (although the program
incorrectly named him — a trap
tor unwary reviewers), and he
could well be a guitar star of
the future, although the
crowded ranks of young jazz
guitarists threatens to engulf
even the most talented.
The concert, as a whole, was
a true jazz event. As Woody
Shaw recently commented:
"people want to hear real
music and hear it from the mas
ters." If that is the case, there is
no better place to start than
with Dizzy Gillespie.
