## Reggae rocker a success for Police 
### 
From Britain, the primordial soup of
rock and roll, comes a new mutation:
reggae-punk. The result is Outlandos
d'Amour, a surprisingly likeable debut
album by the Police.
Like other punk and New Wave
groups, the Police avoid the excesses of
commercial rock. Outlandos is very
simply produced, with little technical
polish. The band consists of only a
drummer and two guitarists. Their
music is coarse by American standards,
but it is refreshingly engaging because
they discard the showy hostility and
politics so popular with the punks.
Reggae
Other British rockers, especially the
Clash, have experimented with reggae.
The Police use it in a uniquely effective
way. On the album's strongest cuts —
"So Lonely," "Can't Stand Losing You"
and "Roxanne" — the verses have a
spare and halting reggae beat.
The choruses are straight out rock 'n'
roll, dense and driving. On "So Lonely"
the contrast works especially well; the

syncopated reggae rhythm builds a
powerful tension which explodes in the
surging refrain.
The backbone of the Police is their
lead singer and chief songwriter, iden
tified only as "Sting" on the cryptic
album cover. His vocals are frighten
ingly sincere, bursting with desire and
frustration. He sings in an oddly ex
pressive thin, high voice, punctuating
his words with thick growls and pierc
ing yelps.
Loss
Sting's songs convey familiar themes
of loss, but with new urgency. "Hole in
My Life" and"Truth Hits Everybody," in
particular, are deeply anguished
pieces, both propelled by Stewart
Copeland's relentless drums. "Born in
the Fifties" takes up the current genera
tion: "We lost our faith and prayed to
the TV — Oh, we should have known
better!"
When the Police do manage to find
"love," the females are, well, different

— a prostitute in "Roxanne," an inflat
able doll in (the tongue-in-cheek) "Be
My Girl Sally." "Roxanne," originally
released as a single, suggests the Kinks'
classic "Lola" with its unlikely heroine.
Like Ray Davies, Sting in "Roxanne"
is at once man and child, mixing de
fiance and vulnerability. What begins as
a proclamation of love becomes a plea
and then a prayer, all echoed in the
aching cries for "Roxanne."
The most bitter track on Outlandos is
"Peanuts"; the songtitle expresses the
Police's opinion of rock stars and star
dom. Hopefully success won't change
their minds, or their egos. Their
strength is in their disarming innocence
and honesty, set to inventive pop
melodies.
Maybe this sincerity survived be
cause the Police recorded the album
themselves, after being turned down
by several record companies. It's al
most too bad that they won't be so
lucky on their next album.
