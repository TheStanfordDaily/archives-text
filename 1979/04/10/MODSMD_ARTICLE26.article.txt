Iran courts show first leniency
Tehran, Iran — Seven more "enemies of the revolu
tion" fell before firing squads yesterday and today, but
the strict Islamic courts showed their first sign of le
niency in other cases — issuing a one-year sentence to
an alleged secret-police torturer and freeing 16 other
members of the old regime.
It was the first time since the courts began functioning
in February that punishments less than the death sen
tence were announced.
Besides the seven executed, unconfirmed reports said
four policemen were put to death in the southwestern
city of Behbahan.
The 11 new deaths would bring to 87 the number of
men shot by firing squads since the mass movement led
by Moslem spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
toppled the monarchy of the now-exiled Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi in mid-February.
The official Iran news agency identified the last person
executed, early today, as army Col. Houshang Tavana, a
former official in Tehran's martial law administration.
Twenty persons have been executed since
last Thursday, when the largely secret tribunals resumed
their work after a three-week suspension. Among them
was former Prime Minister Amir Abbas Hoveida.
Amin's troops defend Kampala
Nairobi, Kenya — Fresh Ugandan troops loyal to Idi
Amin took up new positions east of Kampala yesterday
after Tanzanian forces blunted a last-ditch Ugandan
counterattack in bloody fighting south of the city, anti-
Amin exiles said.
The invasion force of Tanzanian troops and Ugandan
exiles has been poised at Kampala's southern and west
ern outskirts for the past week.
Exile sources, quoting eyewitnesses, said Ugandan
reinforcements led by tanks and armored cars launched
an assault against the invaders over the weekend on the
road to Entebbe airport, 21 miles south of Kampala.
But the invaders held off the attack and inflicted the
heaviest casualties of the war on the pro-Amin forces,
one exile said.
l ike other battle reports from the largely secret war,
this one could not be easily verified.
Pope upholds priestly celibacy
Vatican City — Calling it a "gift," Pope John Paul II
yesterday upheld mandatory celibacy for Roman
Catholic priests and took a tough stance against those
seeking dispensation from their vows.
The pope issued a strong reaffirmation of the 1500-
year-old ban on priestly marriage in a 35-page pastoral
letter to all priests of the church and in a separate eight
page letter to the church's bishops.
"Since the priesthood is given to us so that we can
unceasingly serve others after the example of Christ the
Lord, the priesthood cannot be renounced because of
the difficulties that we meet and the sacrifices asked of
us," the pope wrote.
Priests in the Eastern rite of the Roman Catholic
Church and ministers in most non-Catholic Christian
churches may marry.
The celibacy rule is believed to be a major reason
behind the startling jump in the defections of Roman

Catholic priests in recent years.
About 1000 left the priesthood in 1965, and the annual
rate has risen to 4000, or 1 percent of the world's 400,000
priests. It is estimated that more than 8000 priests in the
United States have resigned since 1965.
Vietnam War star of 51st Oscars
Hollywood — The Vietnam War was the star of last
night's 51st Academy Awards as The Deer Hunter was
named best picture and Coming Home's Jon Voight and
Jane Fonda were picked best actor and actress.
Michael Cimino won best director honors for The
Deer Hunter, which showed the war's effect on three
Pennsylvania mill workers.
Coming Home is the story of two very different victims
of the Vietnam War and the woman who loves them
both.
Christopher Walken was picked best supporting actor
for The Deer Hunter, while Maggie Smith won support
ing actress honors for her role as a nervous Oscar
nominee in California Suite.
The motion picture academy paid tribute to Sir Laur
ence Olivier for his entire career in films. He had been
nominated this year for best actor in The Boys from
Brazil.
Kahn says price controls possible
Washington — A nationwide citizens' crusade against
rising prices got under way yesterday with President
Jimmy Carter's chief inflation fighter saying if voluntary
anti-inflation efforts fail, it could lead to mandatory con
trols or a recession.
But White House Press Secretary Jody Powell said
Carter would not consider imposing mandatory con
trols.
Alfred Kahn told 250 labor leaders the alternatives to
Carter's voluntary wage and price guidelines "are un
thinkably worse."
But, he added, "An honest person has to admit that if
thisvoluntary program doesn't work, we may get one or
another of those alternatives, whether we like it or not.
"I refer, of course, to the option of clamping down on
the economy so severely that we bring on a serious
recession and throw millions of people out of work."
Kahn said the president is determined to avoid both
mandatory controls and policies that would induce re
cession in his anti-inflation fight.

New York — Gambling stocks jumped ahead while the
rest of the market drifted lower in slackened trading

climbed almost 60 points over the past five weeks, slip
ped 1.99 to 873.70.
New York Stock Exchange volume dropped off to
27.23 million shares from Friday's total of 34.71 million.
