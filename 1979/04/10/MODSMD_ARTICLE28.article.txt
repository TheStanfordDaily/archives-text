### Gary Furlong 
Associate Anatomy Prof. Donald
Stilwell has been officially discip
lined for striking two students while
teaching, President Richard Lyman
has disclosed.
The two incidents cost Stilwell
$2 000 in the form of a one-year dis
criminatory salary reduction, and a
warning that any recurrence of such
behaviorcould lead to termination of
his employment here.
An investigation was launched fol
lowing written complaints from two
medical students that they had been
struck in separate incidents in Stil
well's Anatomy 208 class in lanuary
and February of 1978.
Stilwell maintained his contact was
nothing more than a slight tapping or
nudging, and that he had no intentto
harm the students. Witnesses to
both incidents, however, said that
the force used was not appropriate.

Stilwell met with Lyman in Feb
ruary and agreed to the University
sanctions on March 11.
"The fact that neither student suf
fered serious physical injury," Lyman
said, does not excuse such behavior
on the part of a faculty member.
"A member of the faculty must
scrupulously avoid the use of his or
her control or authority for anything
but entirely appropriate academic
purposes."
For a faculty member to push,
shove, or manhandle a student in any
way "displays an acute disregard if
not contempt for scholarly interac
tion, and is demeaning of the stu
dents and faculty of this University
alike," Lyman added.
Stilwell, who could not be reached
for comment, was officially censured
by the University two years ago when
he sent unsolicited letters of recom
mendation to medical schools about
some undergraduates here.
