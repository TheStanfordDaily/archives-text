# Trustees reverse stand, support move to end loans to S. Africa
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The Board of Trustees, reversing its past position,
voted yesterday to support a shareholder resolution
which would force a major U.S. bank to halt new loans
and renewal of old loans to the apartheid regime in
South Africa.
The action came at the board meeting in Los Angeles
following a recommendation from the University Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility that the trustee
Select Committee on Investment Responsibility vote to
support a shareholder resolution before Wells Fargo
Bank stockholders calling for an end to the loans. The
vote in both committees was unanimous.
The trustee action was in contrast to the board's action
last year when similar resolutions were presented. Last
year the board elected to abstain on the proxy issues and
send a letter to the companies explaining their reasons
for the action. The University owns 186,250 shares of
Wells Fargo.
Trustees postponed action on a similar proposal be
fore the BankAmerica Corporation, electing to wait until
the CIR acted on an additional B of A resolution dealing
with loans to communist bloc countries. The trustees
apparently wished to wait until all B of A resolutions had
received CIR consideration before deciding how to vote
its 100,900 Bank of America shares.
Abstention
However, the board went against the wishes of the
CIR when it decided to abstain on proposals which
would have required Chase Manhattan Bank and Wells
Fargo Bank to halt loans to the present government in
Chile.
The CIR had urged the board to support both resolu
tions, but CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier told the Daily
Sunday that he thought the proxies concerning Chile
contained the issues the board would be most likely to
disagree with the CIR on.
Fie made the comment following a 2'/2-hour meeting
between the CIR and the trustee select committee on
Saturday. At that meeting, the CIR presented the trus
tees with its views on proxy issues affecting 11 different
corporations that will be voted on in the next three
weeks.
In the only other proxy concerning South Africa, the
trustees accepted a CIR recommendation tovote against
a proposal to require Caterpillar Tractor to establish a
review board which would determine if its products are
or could be used by police and other authorities to
oppress South African citizens. The University owns

31,520 shares of Caterpillar.
The trustees also agreed with the CI R in voting against
a proposal before DuPont shareholders which would
require directors to cut off grants to schools and organi
zations which employ "avowed communists, Leninists,
Marxists and Maoists." Both groups also rejected a DuP
ont proposal to discourage grants to schools which pro
hibit employees from engaging in covert activities for the
CIA.
The CIR recommendation that the University vote its
6880 shares of Pacific Gas & Electric against a proposal to
convert the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant to either
solar or wind power was also accepted by the board.
But on a PG&E proposal to impose a moratorium on
nuclear power, the trustees decided to vote "no," in
contrast to the CIR recommendation. The CIR had felt
the wording of the proposal unclear, so it had recom
mended an abstention.
The board also rejected CIR positions on two of three
resolutions dealing with sale of infant formulas in de
veloping countries.
Review boards
In resolutions before Bristol-Myers, American Home
Products Corporation and Abbott Laboratories, the
companies would be forced to set up review boards to
develop a more responsible policy on promotion and
distribution of infant formula to developing countries.
The trustees agreed with the CIR in voting the Univer
sity's 300 shares of American Home Products in favor of
the resolution. However, the board voted to abstain on
the Bristol-Myers proxy and voted against the Abbott
Labs proxy. The CIR had recommended an abstention
vote on the University's 92,380 Abbott shares and a vote
in favor of the Bristol-Myers proxy.
The trustees also voted against shareholder proposals
which would require Bristol-Myers and General Electric
to release information on previous government service
of officers of the corporations. The CIR had made no
recommendations on the issues. The board action on a
similar resolution concerning U.S. Steel Corporation
was not available last night.
Details of the trustees' rationale in its decisions were
not available last night as many key administrators were
enroute home from the Los Angeles meetipg.
According to Robert Beyers, director of the University
News Service, all details available last night were re
ported by Director of Finance Rodney Aaams. Beyers
said Vice President for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig
would release details of the board's rationale today.

review board which would determine if its products are
or could be used by police and other authorities to
oppress South African citizens. The University owns

31,520 shares of Caterpillar.
The trustees also agreed with the CI R in voting against
a proposal before DuPont shareholders which would
require directors to cut off grants to schools and organi
zations which employ "avowed communists, Leninists,
Marxists and Maoists." Both groups also rejected a DuP
ont proposal to discourage grants to schools which pro
hibit employees from engaging in covert activities for the
CIA.
The CIR recommendation that the University vote its
6880 shares of Pacific Gas & Electric against a proposal to
convert the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant to either
solar or wind power was also accepted by the board.
But on a PG&E proposal to impose a moratorium on
nuclear power, the trustees decided to vote "no," in
contrast to the CIR recommendation. The CIR had felt
the wording of the proposal unclear, so it had recom
mended an abstention.
The board also rejected CIR positions on two of three
resolutions dealing with sale of infant formulas in de
veloping countries.
Review boards
In resolutions before Bristol-Myers, American Home
Products Corporation and Abbott Laboratories, the
companies would be forced to set up review boards to
develop a more responsible policy on promotion and
distribution of infant formula to developing countries.
The trustees agreed with the CIR in voting the Univer
sity's 300 shares of American Home Products in favor of
the resolution. However, the board voted to abstain on
the Bristol-Myers proxy and voted against the Abbott
Labs proxy. The CIR had recommended an abstention
vote on the University's 92,380 Abbott shares and a vote
in favor of the Bristol-Myers proxy.
The trustees also voted against shareholder proposals
which would require Bristol-Myers and General Electric
to release information on previous government service
of officers of the corporations. The CIR had made no
recommendations on the issues. The board action on a
similar resolution concerning U.S. Steel Corporation
was not available last night.
Details of the trustees' rationale in its decisions were
not available last night as many key administrators were
enroute home from the Los Angeles meetipg.
According to Robert Beyers, director of the University
News Service, all details available last night were re
ported by Director of Finance Rodney Aaams. Beyers
said Vice President for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig
would release details of the board's rationale today.
The Board of Trustees, reversing its past position,
voted yesterday to support a shareholder resolution
which would force a major U.S. bank to halt new loans
and renewal of old loans to the apartheid regime in
South Africa.
The action came at the board meeting in Los Angeles
following a recommendation from the University Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility that the trustee
Select Committee on Investment Responsibility vote to
support a shareholder resolution before Wells Fargo
Bank stockholders calling for an end to the loans. The
vote in both committees was unanimous.
The trustee action was in contrast to the board's action
last year when similar resolutions were presented. Last
year the board elected to abstain on the proxy issues and
send a letter to the companies explaining their reasons
for the action. The University owns 186,250 shares of
Wells Fargo.
Trustees postponed action on a similar proposal be
fore the BankAmerica Corporation, electing to wait until
the CIR acted on an additional B of A resolution dealing
with loans to communist bloc countries. The trustees
apparently wished to wait until all B of A resolutions had
received CIR consideration before deciding how to vote
its 100,900 Bank of America shares.
Abstention
However, the board went against the wishes of the
CIR when it decided to abstain on proposals which
would have required Chase Manhattan Bank and Wells
Fargo Bank to halt loans to the present government in
Chile.
The CIR had urged the board to support both resolu
tions, but CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier told the Daily
Sunday that he thought the proxies concerning Chile
contained the issues the board would be most likely to
disagree with the CIR on.
Fie made the comment following a 2'/2-hour meeting
between the CIR and the trustee select committee on
Saturday. At that meeting, the CIR presented the trus
tees with its views on proxy issues affecting 11 different
corporations that will be voted on in the next three
weeks.
In the only other proxy concerning South Africa, the
trustees accepted a CIR recommendation tovote against
a proposal to require Caterpillar Tractor to establish a
review board which would determine if its products are
or could be used by police and other authorities to
oppress South African citizens. The University owns

31,520 shares of Caterpillar.
The trustees also agreed with the CI R in voting against

The CIR recommendation that the University vote its
6880 shares of Pacific Gas & Electric against a proposal to
