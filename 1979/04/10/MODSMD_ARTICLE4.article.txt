The structure of Stanford's ath
letic department, in a state of flux
since Andy Geiger took over as
athletic director in January, ex
perienced another major change
yesterday as Gary Cavalli, sports
information director here for the
past five years, was named as
sociate director of athletics.
Cavalli's duties will focus on
athletically-related public affairs
such as ticket operations, promo
tion and publications, explained
Geiger, who made the an
nouncement.
"I'm really pleased to appoint
Gary," said Geiger. "He has excel
lent credentials, and I'm pleased
to have him on our management
team."
Cavalli, who assumes his new
position today, commented, "It's
just a great thrill and honor for me
to get a position like this."
A 1971 Stanford graduate,
Cavalli knows the University well
and should help Geiger become
more accustomed to his head post
here.
"Gary not only knows a lot
about the University, but also has
sound judgment about what will
work with new things being
tried," said Bob Rose, assistant
sports information director.

The appointment was no sur
prise to Rose and others close to
the athletic department, and
Cavalli related that he had been
thinking of trying a new occupa
tion for some time.
"A person in sports information
has a lot of different ways to go —
corporate publicity, radio and
television — and athletic ad
ministration is another avenue,"
Cavalli said. "When the opportun
ity became available I thought it
was ideal."
The new athletic director defi
nitely holds Cavalli in high regard.
"I've been very impressed with
everything Gary has handled
since I've been here — my arrival,
the transition from Bill Walsh to
Rod Dowhower (as football
coach)," Geiger said. "He's very
professional."
Two of Cavalli's objectives will
be to "put as many people in the
stadium as possible" and "offer
the best service to the media."
Cavalli is also pledged to con
tinue the University's practice of
establishing high-quality athletic
programs while keeping strong
scholastic standards.
"What we are doing in athletics
at Stanford is unique," Cavalli
said, "and I think we're approach
ing it in the right way. We want to

be as good (in athletics) as we
possibly can and still maintain ex
cellence in academics. My goal is
to spread that message as far as
possible, and to show that it can
be done here."
Cavalli will supervise the sports
information department, which
won 11 national publication
awards under his leadership, as
part of his duties.
In fact, it will be a changed de
partment, with two directors
handling different publicity as
pects.
One director will be responsi
ble for day-to-day media services

such as press releases and statis
tics. Another will direct the com
posing of the many publications
that the office puts out — game
programs, press guides, posters
and schedule cards.
Ceiger did not rule out the pos
sibility that Rose and Nancy Peter
son, Cavalli's assistants, might be
elevated to the new directors'
posts, though he did say that other
applicants will be considered.
"It'll take some time (to fill the
positions)," Geiger said. "We
want to conduct a national search
just to make sure we're finding
the best persons in the country."
