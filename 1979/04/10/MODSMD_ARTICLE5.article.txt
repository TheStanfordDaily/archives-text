# Kaplan opposes legalization of heroin use
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Almost a decade ago, Law School Prof. John
Kaplan planted the seeds of a national controversy
with the publication of Marijuana - The New Pro
hibition. In his book Kaplan accurately predicted
the continued relaxation of the enforcement of
marijuana laws as the use of marijuana became an
increasingly accepted social custom.
Now Kaplan is conducting a major study of the
use of heroin, with financial assistance from the
federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administra
tion.
While Kaplan has suggested that marijuana may
eventually be legalized and sold publicly, he says
that he does not believe heroin will or should
become so available.
For while the legalization of heroin might go a
long way toward eliminating the current connec
tion between serious crime and heroin use (ad
dicts who resort to crime to support their habit, for
example), it would replace this problem with a
dangerous public health problem, according to
Kaplan.
In fact, Kaplan contends that the legalization of
heroin could double the level of addiction, or
even increase it by as much as 50 times.
Heroin users
The number of heroin users in the United States
is estimated at between 500,000 and 700,000. How
ever, Kaplan believes that only about 20,000 of the
users can be classified as serious addicts who

would commit dangerous crimes in order to main
tain their habit. He also estimates that there are at
least as many "recreational users" of heroin as
addicts.
There is relatively little that the public or the
government can do to lessen heroin use, Kaplan
said, and most proposed remedies would proba
bly create new, and worse, problems.
Among the solutions which Kaplan deems, in
the long run, unworkable, are:
— Increased pressure to catch foreign growers
of opium poppies, international drug traffickers,
and pushers in this country;
— Efforts to help addicts maintain their habit,
either through prescriptions or in a controlled en
vironment; and
— Legalization of heroin, which would knock
down the high costs for heroin addicts.
'Won't work'
"Heroin maintenance is an absolutely terrific
idea — except it won't work," Kaplan said. "It
would create another new and dangerous form of
government welfare."
He said that those who could get heroin by pre
scription would have much incentive to become
dealers, obtaining the drug very inexpensively and
selling it at high cost.
Such a proposal also wouldn't be practical, he
said, because addicts need "a hit" every four
hours, and thus a maintenance program would
likely be beset by many logistical problems, such

as transportation to and from the clinic for those
still under the influence of the drug.
In comparison, he said, many similar mainte
nance programs with methadone have been suc
cessful because the drug can be taken orally and
the effects last for a full day.
Can heroin addicts be cured? Yes, Kaplan said,
though the cure often proves to be extremely dif
ficult. "It's myth to believe it's easy for us to cure
them," he said, because like cigarette smoking, it
takes strong motivation to stop heroin use, even
after treatment. While many addicts are able to
give upaftergoingthroughwithdrawal, "adiscon
certing proportion return to the habit."
'Complete nonsense'
Kaplan said that the traditional picture of heroin
pushers convincing innocent victims to try a hit is
"utter, complete nonsense. The vast majority of
heroin users are introduced to the drug by their
friends." And, he said, "most heroin addicts were
criminals before they were addicts. Their motiva
tion isn't all that different from those who commit
crimes to get the funds needed for expensive wo
men, flashy clothes or costly automobiles."
While the fact that the high price of heroin ac
counts for a serious crime problem, Kaplan also
said that it accounts for some of the current level
of control of the drug. Legalization would make it
that much more available, he claimed.
Still, Kaplan contended that "there are no easy
answers" for the heroin question. He called use of
the drug one of the worst "victimless" crimes.
