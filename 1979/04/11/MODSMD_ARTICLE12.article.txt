## Fee Assessment recommendations 
### 
On Wednesday and Thursday of
next week an unprecedented 17 diffe
rent fee assessment requests will
come before ASSU voters for ap
proval. For the wide spectrum of
groups requesting fee assessments,
from specific organizations like the
Band and KZSU to umbrella organiza
tions like the Program Fee and the
Publications Board that in turn serve a
variety of other student programs, the
assessments are often the major — or
only — source of funding for their
programs. Many would be forced to
severely curtail their activities or even
shut down completely without these
funds.
Because of increasing costs and a
general tightening of University
funds, this year students are being
asked to pay next year the single
largest total of fee assessments — $32
per student — in history. It is essential
that everyone make the effort to get
out and vote, not only because of the
large amount of voters' money at
stake, but also because it takes a
minimum of 20 percent of the ASSU to
certify an election and approve an as
sessment. Last year, eight of 11 as
sessments failed to receive 20 percent
of the vote, placing the funding of the
corresponding organizations in
jeopardy and necessitating a special
election which cost the ASSU around
$600.
We make the following recommen
dations in regard to the 17 fee assess
ments that will be on the ballot.
KZSU Radio — Yes
The student radio station here has for
years received virtually all its funding from
the annual fee assessment. This year will
be no exception. Estimates are that 88 per
cent of the station budget will come from
the student assessment.
KZSU cannot accept advertising, and it
needs money to provide interesting prog-,
ramming with a good mix of news and
sports. Despite the fact that the station is
requesting an increase to a four-quarter, $1
assessment, we feel it is justified. Without
the money, the station will have to shut
down.
Hillel — No
Stanford Hillel is asking for a $1 assess
ment for autumn and winter quarters to
fund the refurbishing of a kitchen in the
Old Union Clubhouse and make it suita
ble for use by students who keep kosher.
The organization feels students should
support the referendum because all stu
dents could use the facility, with Hillel
supervision, and because there is no
guarantee the organization could keep the
space beyond the two years they presently
have it allotted for. The feeling is that since
the University could take back the kitchen
and because if that happens, Hillel could
not recoup its loss, the entire student
body should support the project.
We feel strongly that kosher facilities are
needed on a campus where 16 percent of
the students are Jewish, and we cannot
deny the cost of refurbishing the facility
Hillel has been given. But we feel that
since lewish students would be the most
direct recipients of such an assessment,
then Hillel should make a concerted effort
to raise money within its own ranks first.
Since the claim that such a facility is
widely needed and is widely supported, it
would be relatively easy for Hillel to de
monstrate this by getting lews here to con
tribute half of the cost. If this were to oc
cur, we feel it would be totally reasonable
to ask the general student body to kick in
the remainder with a one-quarter assess
ment. But until Hillel demonstrates sup
port within its own ranks, we consider this
an unreasonable request of the students.
Rounding up money on its own could, in
fact, help Hillel keep the kitchen in the

end. If Hillel can demonstrate that it has
put an extremely large financial outlay into
the facility, not to mention the time mem
bers spent fixing up the dilapidated struc
ture, it seems to us less likely that the stu
dent affairs office would take the space
away than if general student funds were
used to build and equip the facility.
Stanford Committee on Political
Education — Yes
SCOPE attempts to foster political edu
cation on campus by bringing speakers
here to speak on various subjects of in
terest to students. Its request for a $1 as
sessment autumn quarter is not excessive.
In this, SCOPE'S first year of fee assess
ment funding, it proved itself a viable or
ganization sponsoring a number of
speeches on campus including a major
forum on the McCloskey National Service
Plan.
Though its presentations are political in
nature, they are not partisan. SCOPE tradi
tionally goes out of its way to ensure that
all sides of an issue are given the oppor
tunity to speak. With 1980 a presidential
election year, we feel the SCOPE request
deserves student support.
New Directions — No
New Directions is an organization which
wishes to increase the community's
awareness of issues involving interna
tional relations, and it is asking for an au
tumn quarter $1 assessment to pay for its
two monthly publications and its various
symposia and bag lunches.
We do not feel students should support
the request because of several factors.
First of all, the publications themselves
appear to us to be of dubious worth. The
information contained in them is readily
available elsewhere and involves less
than-incisive analysis. Contributors to the
publications often complain of poor edit
ing.
In addition, the organization has seem
ingly made no effort to try to cut the cost
of its newsletter and its Update publica
tion. Combining the two could conceiva
bly cut costs. So could an effort by mem
bers to do more of their own production
work instead of paying others. Most on
campus publications do their own make
up for example, but this significant cost is
still being paid out by New Directions.
The members claim they cannot get
enough support from the membership to
do things like make-up. Well, if so, we see
very little reason to ask the entire student
body to spend money on a less-than-viable
student group.
The most valuable contribution the or
ganization makes to student life here is its
series of symposia and bag lunches. How
ever, bag iunches do not cost very much.
People bring their own food and the
speakers are generally on-campus experts
or people already visiting here for one
reason or another.
In addition, symposia can be funded
from other sources like the Dickenson
Fund, the Speakers Bureau and SCOPE.
Fee assessment money is not needed to
continue this valuable service.
In essence, the fee assessment would go
to pay for two newsletters which are not
cost effective and are of dubious worth.
Student money can be better spent
elsewhere.
Boathouse — No
It is our view that a student activity
center around the lake should be paid for
from the already-exorbitant tuition
charges the University assesses. ASSU of
ficials insist that the fee assessment is
needed to make up a deficit which will
occur when scheduled improvements are
completed this spring. We grant that the
improvements are needed, but we are
upset with the misguided manner officials
use to secure funding.
In our view, the fee assessment route
should be employed only as a last resort,
when other sources of funding within the
University are exhausted. We were con
vinced that the problems at the boathouse
arose with University budget cutting dur
ing the drought when the boathouse was
not in use. But now, with the lake full and
the boathouse in use, rather than coming

to students with a fee assessment, the
ASSU should make a serious effort to sec
ure funding from the University. This ar
gument is even more compelling now that
the University plans a new 800-person
dormitory along the lake further increas
ing boathouse use. If after all other
sources of funding appeardried up, then it
is appropriate to come to the students.
Until then, students should reject this
proposal.
Public Interest Research Group
— No
PIRG is an organization which was
formed to "promote progressive social
change by providing accurate information
and taking action on pressing social is
sues." An admirable goal. But in our view,
PIRG's request for a $1 assessment Au
tumn and Winter Quarters next year is not
worthy of student support.
For one thing, PIRC has failed to de
monstrate that it has any significant sup
port from the community. Organizers
claim that it takes money to get members,
but we disagree. Many organizations have
huge memberships without huge
budgets. Moreover, PIRG claims it has to
date been unable to perform any big ser
vice projects because of its lack of funds.
Yet when questioned by the editorial
board, organizers were unable to give
even one example of a planned project
which was held up due to funding prob
lems.
PIRG would use its $20,000 from the fee
assessment in large part to hire an outside
staff person to take care of organizing, get
ting grant money and sending for litera
ture. We do not feel these are duties any
large and active membership cannot ac
complish at a relatively low cost. PIRG
would be sending at least 5 percent of its
fee assessment to a state organization,
another use of student funds we cannot
consider fair.
Basically, before PIRG is to receive stu
dent fee monies, the organizations should
show the community that it has real poten
tial by accomplishing a rather modest, but
inexpensive project for students. It should
also prove it has some backing by de
monstrating a membership.
Finally, since it purports to serve not
only students but also the community at
large, we feel it only fitting that the group
solicit funding from some other sources
outside the University. So far this has not
happened. If these conditions are met, we
feel PIRG may deserve a fee assessment,
but under the present circumstances, we
cannot support one.
The Stanford Daily — Yes
We recognize that we are not the most
objective group to speak to this issue, yet
when all issues are considered, we believe
we deserve a three-quarter, $1 assessment
next year.
Over the past few years, the Daily has
worked toward building a reserve fund to
a level both the University and the Daily
considered prudent. Bui while we were
building reserves to stave off near ban
kruptcy four years ago, necessary purch
ases of supplies and equipment fell by the
wayside. Even as the reserve grew to its
present safe level, the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference between
profit and loss in a given year. To insure
that our financial situation remains healthy
and that the purchases needed to make
the Daily a better product for the com
munity and a better training ground for the
up-and-coming journalists who work
here, it is necessary that we receive the fee
assessment.
This year the Daily has increased in size
from an average 7.9 to 10 pages per day.
Besides the services provided, unavailable
anywhere else, like Once Around the
Quad and Time Schedule Changes, we are
printing more news, more features, more
sports, more entertainment and more
community opinions than ever before.
Having a healthy reserve has allowed us to
run papers with smaller advertising per
centages, thus giving you the readers
more of what you want. We feel our per
formance has more than justified asking
students for 2 cents per issue. We hope for
your support.
On Wednesday and Thursday of
next week an unprecedented 17 diffe
rent fee assessment requests will
come before ASSU voters for ap
proval. For the wide spectrum of

kruptcy four years ago, necessary purch
ases of supplies and equipment fell by the
wayside. Even as the reserve grew to its
present safe level, the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference between
profit and loss in a given year. To insure
that our financial situation remains healthy
and that the purchases needed to make
the Daily a better product for the com
munity and a better training ground for the
up-and-coming journalists who work
here, it is necessary that we receive the fee
assessment.
This year the Daily has increased in size
from an average 7.9 to 10 pages per day.
Besides the services provided, unavailable
anywhere else, like Once Around the
Quad and Time Schedule Changes, we are
printing more news, more features, more
sports, more entertainment and more
community opinions than ever before.
Having a healthy reserve has allowed us to
run papers with smaller advertising per
centages, thus giving you the readers
more of what you want. We feel our per
formance has more than justified asking
students for 2 cents per issue. We hope for
your support.
On Wednesday and Thursday of
next week an unprecedented 17 diffe
rent fee assessment requests will
come before ASSU voters for ap
proval. For the wide spectrum of
groups requesting fee assessments,
from specific organizations like the
Band and KZSU to umbrella organiza
tions like the Program Fee and the
Publications Board that in turn serve a
variety of other student programs, the
assessments are often the major — or
only — source of funding for their
programs. Many would be forced to
severely curtail their activities or even
shut down completely without these
funds.
Because of increasing costs and a
general tightening of University
funds, this year students are being
asked to pay next year the single
largest total of fee assessments — $32
per student — in history. It is essential
that everyone make the effort to get
out and vote, not only because of the
large amount of voters' money at
stake, but also because it takes a
minimum of 20 percent of the ASSU to
certify an election and approve an as
sessment. Last year, eight of 11 as
sessments failed to receive 20 percent
of the vote, placing the funding of the
corresponding organizations in
jeopardy and necessitating a special
election which cost the ASSU around
$600.
We make the following recommen
dations in regard to the 17 fee assess
ments that will be on the ballot.
KZSU Radio — Yes
The student radio station here has for
years received virtually all its funding from
the annual fee assessment. This year will
be no exception. Estimates are that 88 per
cent of the station budget will come from
the student assessment.
KZSU cannot accept advertising, and it
needs money to provide interesting prog-,
ramming with a good mix of news and
sports. Despite the fact that the station is
requesting an increase to a four-quarter, $1
assessment, we feel it is justified. Without
the money, the station will have to shut
down.
Hillel — No
Stanford Hillel is asking for a $1 assess
ment for autumn and winter quarters to
fund the refurbishing of a kitchen in the
Old Union Clubhouse and make it suita
ble for use by students who keep kosher.
The organization feels students should
support the referendum because all stu
dents could use the facility, with Hillel
supervision, and because there is no
guarantee the organization could keep the
space beyond the two years they presently
have it allotted for. The feeling is that since
the University could take back the kitchen
and because if that happens, Hillel could
not recoup its loss, the entire student
body should support the project.
We feel strongly that kosher facilities are
needed on a campus where 16 percent of
the students are Jewish, and we cannot
deny the cost of refurbishing the facility
Hillel has been given. But we feel that
since lewish students would be the most
direct recipients of such an assessment,
then Hillel should make a concerted effort
to raise money within its own ranks first.
Since the claim that such a facility is
widely needed and is widely supported, it
would be relatively easy for Hillel to de
monstrate this by getting lews here to con
tribute half of the cost. If this were to oc
cur, we feel it would be totally reasonable
to ask the general student body to kick in
the remainder with a one-quarter assess
ment. But until Hillel demonstrates sup
port within its own ranks, we consider this
an unreasonable request of the students.
Rounding up money on its own could, in
fact, help Hillel keep the kitchen in the

end. If Hillel can demonstrate that it has
put an extremely large financial outlay into
the facility, not to mention the time mem
bers spent fixing up the dilapidated struc
ture, it seems to us less likely that the stu
dent affairs office would take the space
away than if general student funds were
used to build and equip the facility.
Stanford Committee on Political
Education — Yes
SCOPE attempts to foster political edu
cation on campus by bringing speakers
here to speak on various subjects of in
terest to students. Its request for a $1 as
sessment autumn quarter is not excessive.
In this, SCOPE'S first year of fee assess
ment funding, it proved itself a viable or
ganization sponsoring a number of
speeches on campus including a major
forum on the McCloskey National Service
Plan.
Though its presentations are political in
nature, they are not partisan. SCOPE tradi
tionally goes out of its way to ensure that
all sides of an issue are given the oppor
tunity to speak. With 1980 a presidential
election year, we feel the SCOPE request
deserves student support.
New Directions — No
New Directions is an organization which
wishes to increase the community's
awareness of issues involving interna
tional relations, and it is asking for an au
tumn quarter $1 assessment to pay for its
two monthly publications and its various
symposia and bag lunches.
We do not feel students should support
the request because of several factors.
First of all, the publications themselves
appear to us to be of dubious worth. The
information contained in them is readily
available elsewhere and involves less
than-incisive analysis. Contributors to the
publications often complain of poor edit
ing.
In addition, the organization has seem
ingly made no effort to try to cut the cost
of its newsletter and its Update publica
tion. Combining the two could conceiva
bly cut costs. So could an effort by mem
bers to do more of their own production
work instead of paying others. Most on
campus publications do their own make
up for example, but this significant cost is
still being paid out by New Directions.
The members claim they cannot get
enough support from the membership to
do things like make-up. Well, if so, we see
very little reason to ask the entire student
body to spend money on a less-than-viable
student group.
The most valuable contribution the or
ganization makes to student life here is its
series of symposia and bag lunches. How
ever, bag iunches do not cost very much.
People bring their own food and the
speakers are generally on-campus experts
or people already visiting here for one
reason or another.
In addition, symposia can be funded
from other sources like the Dickenson
Fund, the Speakers Bureau and SCOPE.
Fee assessment money is not needed to
continue this valuable service.
In essence, the fee assessment would go
to pay for two newsletters which are not
cost effective and are of dubious worth.
Student money can be better spent
elsewhere.
Boathouse — No
It is our view that a student activity
center around the lake should be paid for
from the already-exorbitant tuition
charges the University assesses. ASSU of
ficials insist that the fee assessment is
needed to make up a deficit which will
occur when scheduled improvements are
completed this spring. We grant that the
improvements are needed, but we are
upset with the misguided manner officials
use to secure funding.
In our view, the fee assessment route
should be employed only as a last resort,
when other sources of funding within the
University are exhausted. We were con
vinced that the problems at the boathouse
arose with University budget cutting dur
ing the drought when the boathouse was
not in use. But now, with the lake full and
the boathouse in use, rather than coming

to students with a fee assessment, the
ASSU should make a serious effort to sec
ure funding from the University. This ar
gument is even more compelling now that
the University plans a new 800-person
dormitory along the lake further increas
ing boathouse use. If after all other
sources of funding appeardried up, then it
is appropriate to come to the students.
Until then, students should reject this
proposal.
Public Interest Research Group
— No
PIRG is an organization which was
formed to "promote progressive social
change by providing accurate information
and taking action on pressing social is
sues." An admirable goal. But in our view,
PIRG's request for a $1 assessment Au
tumn and Winter Quarters next year is not
worthy of student support.
For one thing, PIRC has failed to de
monstrate that it has any significant sup
port from the community. Organizers
claim that it takes money to get members,
but we disagree. Many organizations have
huge memberships without huge
budgets. Moreover, PIRG claims it has to
date been unable to perform any big ser
vice projects because of its lack of funds.
Yet when questioned by the editorial
board, organizers were unable to give
even one example of a planned project
which was held up due to funding prob
lems.
PIRG would use its $20,000 from the fee
assessment in large part to hire an outside
staff person to take care of organizing, get
ting grant money and sending for litera
ture. We do not feel these are duties any
large and active membership cannot ac
complish at a relatively low cost. PIRG
would be sending at least 5 percent of its
fee assessment to a state organization,
another use of student funds we cannot
consider fair.
Basically, before PIRG is to receive stu
dent fee monies, the organizations should
show the community that it has real poten
tial by accomplishing a rather modest, but
inexpensive project for students. It should
also prove it has some backing by de
monstrating a membership.
Finally, since it purports to serve not
only students but also the community at
large, we feel it only fitting that the group
solicit funding from some other sources
outside the University. So far this has not
happened. If these conditions are met, we
feel PIRG may deserve a fee assessment,
but under the present circumstances, we
cannot support one.
The Stanford Daily — Yes
We recognize that we are not the most
objective group to speak to this issue, yet
when all issues are considered, we believe
we deserve a three-quarter, $1 assessment
next year.
Over the past few years, the Daily has
worked toward building a reserve fund to
a level both the University and the Daily
considered prudent. Bui while we were
building reserves to stave off near ban
kruptcy four years ago, necessary purch
ases of supplies and equipment fell by the
wayside. Even as the reserve grew to its
present safe level, the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference between
profit and loss in a given year. To insure

another use of student funds we cannot
consider fair.
Basically, before PIRG is to receive stu
dent fee monies, the organizations should
show the community that it has real poten
tial by accomplishing a rather modest, but
inexpensive project for students. It should
also prove it has some backing by de
monstrating a membership.
Finally, since it purports to serve not
only students but also the community at
large, we feel it only fitting that the group
solicit funding from some other sources
outside the University. So far this has not
happened. If these conditions are met, we
feel PIRG may deserve a fee assessment,
but under the present circumstances, we
cannot support one.
The Stanford Daily — Yes
We recognize that we are not the most
objective group to speak to this issue, yet
when all issues are considered, we believe
we deserve a three-quarter, $1 assessment
next year.
Over the past few years, the Daily has
worked toward building a reserve fund to
a level both the University and the Daily
considered prudent. Bui while we were
building reserves to stave off near ban
kruptcy four years ago, necessary purch
ases of supplies and equipment fell by the
wayside. Even as the reserve grew to its
present safe level, the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference between
profit and loss in a given year. To insure
that our financial situation remains healthy
and that the purchases needed to make
the Daily a better product for the com
munity and a better training ground for the
up-and-coming journalists who work
here, it is necessary that we receive the fee
assessment.
This year the Daily has increased in size
from an average 7.9 to 10 pages per day.
Besides the services provided, unavailable
anywhere else, like Once Around the
Quad and Time Schedule Changes, we are
printing more news, more features, more
sports, more entertainment and more
community opinions than ever before.
Having a healthy reserve has allowed us to
run papers with smaller advertising per
centages, thus giving you the readers
more of what you want. We feel our per
formance has more than justified asking
students for 2 cents per issue. We hope for
your support.
On Wednesday and Thursday of
next week an unprecedented 17 diffe
rent fee assessment requests will
come before ASSU voters for ap
proval. For the wide spectrum of
groups requesting fee assessments,
from specific organizations like the
Band and KZSU to umbrella organiza
tions like the Program Fee and the
Publications Board that in turn serve a
variety of other student programs, the
assessments are often the major — or
only — source of funding for their
programs. Many would be forced to
severely curtail their activities or even
shut down completely without these
funds.
Because of increasing costs and a
general tightening of University
funds, this year students are being
asked to pay next year the single
largest total of fee assessments — $32
per student — in history. It is essential
that everyone make the effort to get
out and vote, not only because of the
large amount of voters' money at
stake, but also because it takes a
minimum of 20 percent of the ASSU to
certify an election and approve an as
sessment. Last year, eight of 11 as
sessments failed to receive 20 percent
of the vote, placing the funding of the
corresponding organizations in
jeopardy and necessitating a special
election which cost the ASSU around
$600.
We make the following recommen
dations in regard to the 17 fee assess
ments that will be on the ballot.
KZSU Radio — Yes
The student radio station here has for
years received virtually all its funding from
the annual fee assessment. This year will
be no exception. Estimates are that 88 per
cent of the station budget will come from
the student assessment.
KZSU cannot accept advertising, and it
needs money to provide interesting prog-,
ramming with a good mix of news and
sports. Despite the fact that the station is
requesting an increase to a four-quarter, $1
assessment, we feel it is justified. Without
the money, the station will have to shut
down.
Hillel — No
Stanford Hillel is asking for a $1 assess
ment for autumn and winter quarters to
fund the refurbishing of a kitchen in the
Old Union Clubhouse and make it suita
ble for use by students who keep kosher.
The organization feels students should
support the referendum because all stu
dents could use the facility, with Hillel
supervision, and because there is no
guarantee the organization could keep the
space beyond the two years they presently
have it allotted for. The feeling is that since
the University could take back the kitchen
and because if that happens, Hillel could
not recoup its loss, the entire student
body should support the project.
We feel strongly that kosher facilities are
needed on a campus where 16 percent of
the students are Jewish, and we cannot
deny the cost of refurbishing the facility
Hillel has been given. But we feel that
since lewish students would be the most
direct recipients of such an assessment,
then Hillel should make a concerted effort
to raise money within its own ranks first.
Since the claim that such a facility is
widely needed and is widely supported, it
would be relatively easy for Hillel to de
monstrate this by getting lews here to con
tribute half of the cost. If this were to oc
cur, we feel it would be totally reasonable
to ask the general student body to kick in
the remainder with a one-quarter assess
ment. But until Hillel demonstrates sup
port within its own ranks, we consider this
an unreasonable request of the students.
Rounding up money on its own could, in
fact, help Hillel keep the kitchen in the

end. If Hillel can demonstrate that it has
put an extremely large financial outlay into
the facility, not to mention the time mem
bers spent fixing up the dilapidated struc
ture, it seems to us less likely that the stu
dent affairs office would take the space
away than if general student funds were
used to build and equip the facility.
Stanford Committee on Political
Education — Yes
SCOPE attempts to foster political edu
cation on campus by bringing speakers
here to speak on various subjects of in
terest to students. Its request for a $1 as
sessment autumn quarter is not excessive.
In this, SCOPE'S first year of fee assess
ment funding, it proved itself a viable or
ganization sponsoring a number of
speeches on campus including a major
forum on the McCloskey National Service
Plan.
Though its presentations are political in
nature, they are not partisan. SCOPE tradi
tionally goes out of its way to ensure that
all sides of an issue are given the oppor
tunity to speak. With 1980 a presidential
election year, we feel the SCOPE request
deserves student support.
New Directions — No
New Directions is an organization which
wishes to increase the community's
awareness of issues involving interna
tional relations, and it is asking for an au
tumn quarter $1 assessment to pay for its
two monthly publications and its various
symposia and bag lunches.
We do not feel students should support
the request because of several factors.
First of all, the publications themselves
appear to us to be of dubious worth. The
information contained in them is readily
available elsewhere and involves less
than-incisive analysis. Contributors to the
publications often complain of poor edit
ing.
In addition, the organization has seem
ingly made no effort to try to cut the cost
of its newsletter and its Update publica
tion. Combining the two could conceiva
bly cut costs. So could an effort by mem
bers to do more of their own production
work instead of paying others. Most on
campus publications do their own make
up for example, but this significant cost is
still being paid out by New Directions.
The members claim they cannot get
enough support from the membership to
do things like make-up. Well, if so, we see
very little reason to ask the entire student
body to spend money on a less-than-viable
student group.
The most valuable contribution the or
ganization makes to student life here is its
series of symposia and bag lunches. How
ever, bag iunches do not cost very much.
People bring their own food and the
speakers are generally on-campus experts
or people already visiting here for one
reason or another.
In addition, symposia can be funded
from other sources like the Dickenson
Fund, the Speakers Bureau and SCOPE.
Fee assessment money is not needed to
continue this valuable service.
In essence, the fee assessment would go
to pay for two newsletters which are not
cost effective and are of dubious worth.
Student money can be better spent
elsewhere.
Boathouse — No
It is our view that a student activity
center around the lake should be paid for
from the already-exorbitant tuition
charges the University assesses. ASSU of
ficials insist that the fee assessment is
needed to make up a deficit which will
occur when scheduled improvements are
completed this spring. We grant that the
improvements are needed, but we are
upset with the misguided manner officials
use to secure funding.
In our view, the fee assessment route
should be employed only as a last resort,
when other sources of funding within the
University are exhausted. We were con
vinced that the problems at the boathouse
arose with University budget cutting dur
ing the drought when the boathouse was
not in use. But now, with the lake full and
the boathouse in use, rather than coming

to students with a fee assessment, the
ASSU should make a serious effort to sec
ure funding from the University. This ar
gument is even more compelling now that
the University plans a new 800-person
dormitory along the lake further increas
ing boathouse use. If after all other
sources of funding appeardried up, then it
is appropriate to come to the students.
Until then, students should reject this
proposal.
Public Interest Research Group
— No
PIRG is an organization which was
formed to "promote progressive social
change by providing accurate information
and taking action on pressing social is
sues." An admirable goal. But in our view,
PIRG's request for a $1 assessment Au
tumn and Winter Quarters next year is not
worthy of student support.
For one thing, PIRC has failed to de
monstrate that it has any significant sup
port from the community. Organizers
claim that it takes money to get members,
but we disagree. Many organizations have
huge memberships without huge
budgets. Moreover, PIRG claims it has to
date been unable to perform any big ser
vice projects because of its lack of funds.
Yet when questioned by the editorial
board, organizers were unable to give
even one example of a planned project
which was held up due to funding prob
lems.
PIRG would use its $20,000 from the fee
assessment in large part to hire an outside
staff person to take care of organizing, get
ting grant money and sending for litera
ture. We do not feel these are duties any
large and active membership cannot ac
complish at a relatively low cost. PIRG
would be sending at least 5 percent of its
fee assessment to a state organization,
another use of student funds we cannot
consider fair.
Basically, before PIRG is to receive stu
dent fee monies, the organizations should
show the community that it has real poten

sues." An admirable goal. But in our view,
PIRG's request for a $1 assessment Au
tumn and Winter Quarters next year is not
worthy of student support.
For one thing, PIRC has failed to de
monstrate that it has any significant sup
port from the community. Organizers
claim that it takes money to get members,
but we disagree. Many organizations have
huge memberships without huge
budgets. Moreover, PIRG claims it has to
date been unable to perform any big ser
vice projects because of its lack of funds.
Yet when questioned by the editorial
board, organizers were unable to give
even one example of a planned project
which was held up due to funding prob
lems.
PIRG would use its $20,000 from the fee
assessment in large part to hire an outside
staff person to take care of organizing, get
ting grant money and sending for litera
ture. We do not feel these are duties any
large and active membership cannot ac
complish at a relatively low cost. PIRG
would be sending at least 5 percent of its
fee assessment to a state organization,
another use of student funds we cannot
consider fair.
Basically, before PIRG is to receive stu
dent fee monies, the organizations should
show the community that it has real poten
tial by accomplishing a rather modest, but
inexpensive project for students. It should
also prove it has some backing by de
monstrating a membership.
Finally, since it purports to serve not
only students but also the community at
large, we feel it only fitting that the group
solicit funding from some other sources
outside the University. So far this has not
happened. If these conditions are met, we
feel PIRG may deserve a fee assessment,
but under the present circumstances, we
cannot support one.
The Stanford Daily — Yes
We recognize that we are not the most
objective group to speak to this issue, yet
when all issues are considered, we believe
we deserve a three-quarter, $1 assessment
next year.
Over the past few years, the Daily has
worked toward building a reserve fund to
a level both the University and the Daily
considered prudent. Bui while we were
building reserves to stave off near ban
kruptcy four years ago, necessary purch
ases of supplies and equipment fell by the
wayside. Even as the reserve grew to its
present safe level, the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference between
profit and loss in a given year. To insure
that our financial situation remains healthy
and that the purchases needed to make
the Daily a better product for the com
munity and a better training ground for the
up-and-coming journalists who work
here, it is necessary that we receive the fee
assessment.
This year the Daily has increased in size
from an average 7.9 to 10 pages per day.
Besides the services provided, unavailable
anywhere else, like Once Around the
Quad and Time Schedule Changes, we are
printing more news, more features, more
sports, more entertainment and more
community opinions than ever before.
Having a healthy reserve has allowed us to
run papers with smaller advertising per
centages, thus giving you the readers
more of what you want. We feel our per
formance has more than justified asking
students for 2 cents per issue. We hope for
your support.
