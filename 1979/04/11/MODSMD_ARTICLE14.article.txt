## Mark Swanson Create a Dept. of Education

July 1976 witnessed then-candidate Jimmy
Carter's appearance before the National Educa
tional Association, and the enunciation of his
solemn commitment to an "overall reorganiza
tion of government." Carter's first plan to fulfill
this commitment was his pledge to the NEA to
push for a separate, independent, Cabinet-level
Department of Education. Three bills on the
issue were introduced during the waning hours
of the 95th Congress, but all died when it ad
journed.
There are several reasons why the establish
ment of an independent Department of Educa
tion is necessary, and why it should take high
priority among congressional business this ses
sion.
Recently, America has faced severe problems
in education. There has been as appreciable de
cline in the level of student academic achieve
ment and therefore in the extent of domestic
confidence in the quality of education. Accom
panying these phenomena has been a parallel
increase in the number of unemployed, under
skilled youths.
Furthermore, an extensive demographic shift
has recently occasioned a decline in the number
of citizens of school age — as well as a corres
ponding rise in the number of older citizens.
These social changes will soon intensify and
multiply future demands for life-long educa
tional opportunities. The need to retrain people
whose occupational skills become increasingly
outmoded and useless will become terribly
acute as the technological level of our industrial
society advances.
The existing Department of Health, Educa
tion, and Welfare is too bulky to make these
pressing problems of education nationally visi
ble. Also, the greatest proportion of dollars fun
nelled into education is at the state and local
levels. Total federal expenditures in most school
years amount to little more than 10 percent of
total nationwide expenditures for education.
By establishing a separate Department of Edu
cation, these decentralized programs could be
consolidated, and the numerous crises facing
education in America more properly addressed.
Along with the complete inclusion of the pre
sent Education division of HEW, programs from
the departments of Defense, Housing and
Urban Development Justice could be similarly
transferred to the new department.
Money is power — the fact that the federal
government subsidizes only one-tenth of all
education will preclude an excess of national
level influence in what most people would like

to see remain a predominantly local concern —
the education of their children. Certainly, edu
cational programs should vary according to the
employment needs and orientation of each par
ticular community. But local educational au
tonomy will not be curbed by greater centraliza
tion of educational programs at the federal
level. Congress will still maintain ultimate con
trol over the appropriation of funds for edua
tion.
It is highly unlikely that the increasingly con
servative, pennypinching Congress will approp
riate more funds for education than are abso
lutely necessary. In any case, such centralization
at the federal level can help clarify community
responsibilities to public education by specify
ing what precisely the federal government itself
will provide to fulfill local eduational needs —
tederal intervention in a decentralized system of
education will be both limited and delineated.
Because educational programs are presently
distributed among various federal bureauc
racies, the individual programs are "colored"
according to the "missions" or institutional in
terests of that particular bureaucracy. With one
Department of Education, a single policy could
be formulated and our national commitment to
excellent and equitable education could be reaf
firmed.
Centralization will also help to further na
tional goals'of equality of educational opportun
ity and program quality. With the increasing re
sistance of state and local governments in the
wake of Proposition 13 to pump more money
into their educational systems, there is a poten
tial for a reduction in the equal access to quality
education. In such a scenario — which, unfor
tunately, is not only plausible but probable —
asymmetry of quality and opportunity from
school district to school district, which are al
ready well-pronounced, would gradually be
come more markedly obvious and discriminat
ory. The new Department of Education can be
organized to bridge this gap.
An independent Department of Education can
serve to reinforce national priorities for educa
tion, help centralize policy aims, increase equal
ity of educational opportunity across the nation,
and ameliorate the standard of education qual
ity. With these potential benefits so manifest,
the establishment of such a department be
comes an urgent and consequential matter.
