## Closing reactors unfeasible 
### 
The attitude underlying your
editorial on the Rancho Seco
nuclear power plant is one
which wants all nuclear plants
closed down. To achieve this,
all sorts of issues are raised,
and the solutions you suggest
would stop nuclear power en
tirely. For example, you would
have the Price-Anderson Act
repealed, ostensibly because a
$550 million limit on liability is
not enough. (I was amused to
see you decide $550 million
isn't enough, after loftily dec
laring how repugnant it is to
place monetary value on
human life. Are insurance
companies tainted? Are
economists and others?)
You know but do not state
that without the limit the nuc
lear industry would not have
been started. Your unspoken
justified belief is that no nuc
lear plants would be built, and
those operating shut down, if

the limit were lifted.
So why not openly admit
you'd prefer to have all nuclear
power generation in the Un
ited States halted tomorrow?
(Come to think of it, why not
the world? I'm sure you think
you know more about what's
good for the French than they
do.)
Consider, however, how
much more coal and oil would
be burned. It is generally con
ceded that the burning of coal
alone costs 15,000 lives per
year. These deaths, indirectly
caused by coal burning, are di
rectly caused by exacerbated
lung diseases (e.g., em
physema, black lung, mining
and transport accidents).
Note that this casualty rate is
annual. No nuclear-related
deaths (e.g., not slip-and-fall)
from commercial nuclear
plants in the United States have
occurred in the history of the
industry.
The estimated casualties
caused by the nuclear industry
are 15,000 deaths over 30 years.

Coal, 'by comparison, is 30
times more deadly, yet you
think we should burn more
coal? Alas, coal is trendy and
nuclear power is not.
More power has to come
from some place and nuclear
fission is a necessary stopgap
until fusion and solar are prac
tical. Conservation helps, but
doesn't look like a long-term
solution.
Anything non-nuclear gets
extra consideration from
people of your persuasion. For
example, you think solar
technology can bail us out of
this mess, but you have no
similar confidence in nuclear
technology. You insist on per
fection from nuclear power
plants, but will let coal get away
with murder. Your attitude is
based not on a realistic as
sessment of the benfits and
risks of various energy alterna
tives, but on trendy
emotionalism.
