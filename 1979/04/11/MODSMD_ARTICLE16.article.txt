Cover Banks, too
In light of all the controversy
that erupted over the selection
of Dennis Banks as an ASSU
guest professor, I was some
what dismayed to discover that
the Daily favored Ellsberg with
a full-blown article (Daily, April
6), and conceded Banks only a
picture and caption (Daily,
April 4) on the event of their
first lectures. This is even more
unbelievable when you con
sider that the Daily usually
covers just about everyone
who gives a speech on this
campus with blow-by-blow de
scriptions. ,
Is Banks not famous enough
or erudite enough to warrant a
description of what he had to
say? Has he not made a sig
nificant enough contribution
to American history that no
one would care to hear or read
about him? I can't think of a
single good reason why this
happened, but no one has to
detail all the bad reasons that it
might have. It makes me won
der if the Daily isn't as racist,
sexist and one-sided as its cri
tics say. I always stood up for
the Daily, I even worked for it
and I'm really sad that I may
have finally found a reason to
condemn it.
