# Small Row houses, co-ops offer unique living experiences
## 
### Andrew Rich 
To most undergraduates
here, the independent and
Row houses are often spoken
of, but seldom known about.
There are 24 of these "anti
dorms" on campus, and al
though all are similar in that
they house and feed no more
than 50 students, each is un
ique.
In an effort to broadly clas
sify them, these residences can
be roughly grouped into four
categories: Row houses,
theme houses, self-operatives,
and co-operatives.
There are seven University
run Row houses with no spe
cial priorities. Most famous is
the newest, 558 Mayfield. Be
cause of its young age and the
absence of priorities, it is the
most requested house every
year in the draw. Its present
occupants list as its qualities
the location, rooms and
facilities. But some residents
complained of the lack of
house unity, saying "My
friends are all in other
houses," and "Everyone basi
cally does their own thing."
The other Row houses are
described by their occupants in
different ways. Each has its
own character, yet there are
basic similarities:
"I liked it because it looked
like a neighborhood atmos
phere," says Don Rifkin about
Hurlburt. "And I liked the
people that showed me
around." Also praised by resi
dents of the Row is the food
service there, which seems to
be better than that of the larger
dorms.
Roth and Storey
Two of the Row houses are
especially unique not just be
cause of their size, food and
location, but also because of
their occupants. These are
Roth and Storey, the only all
women houses on campus.
Many of the women in these
houses did not specifically re
quest them. Vet, almost all de
scribed themselves as being
"pleasantly surprised" to find
something different than they
had expected. As Storey House
house associate (RA) Laurel
Chun says,"The Storey
otypical woman was rich,
pretty and fraternity orientt

Like all stereotypes, this one
doesn't hold up in truth. Both
houses maintain that there is
no sorority attention there. In
fact Chun says that the woman
who are in sororities are "ex
tremely conscientious about
not bringing sororities into the
house."
The women in both houses
described their residences as
being composed of very inde
pendent members, who are in
volved in more outside ac
tivities than house functions,
yet are supportive of the house
and its residents. Most said
they will return next year if they
have the choice.
Most well known of the
theme houses are the three
cultural residences: La Maison
Francaise (French), La Casa
Italiana (Italian), and Haus
Mitteleuropa (German).
Theme houses
Students in these houses
were attracted for a number of
reasons. Many said they plan to
go to overseas campuses and
are using these houses as an
introduction to the culture
they will soon experience
first hand. Others have just re
turned from overseas, and
want to continue using the lan
guage they have picked up.
Some simply view them as a
good residential-education
experience and a place to prac
tice foreign languages.
Kamal Zein, resident fellow
of the French House, says that
students choose that house
because of "the reputation for
the food, the language" and
what he calls "the mystique of
the French." While voicing a
comment which seems com
mon to most of the theme
houses, that it is "the kids that
make the house," as well as the
theme, he still adds that La
Maison Francaise is, for exam
ple, "the next best thing to
going to France."
American Studies is de
scribed by some of its residents
as having "ideal rooms, ideal
location and a theme as an
extra bonus." While the physi
cal attributes of the house ini
tially attracted many of the
members, the programs have
sparked much in-house in
volvement.

The rest of the independent
houses are either self
operated, meaning they hire a
cook and hashers but do the
house-cleaning themselves, or
they are cooperative in all as
pects.
Some have specific dif
ferences, such as a theme
or being a fraternity.
Whitman House, in the Cowell
Cluster, is described in the
draw book as a "residential
education" theme house; this
has led to the derogatory
nickname of the"the nerd
theme house."Resident Jean
Noble countered that "the repu
tation is so old, it doesn't hold
up anymore. Whitman is quie
ter, but that doesn't mean it's
boring." She said she chose
Whitman because of the physi
cal set-up and the people
there. Another student at
Whitman, Janice Tu, said she
likes the fact that individuals
are encouraged to initiate and
promote activities. "In big
dorms things are organized for
you, but here you have to do it
for yourself."
Alpha Sigma Phi, also in the
Cowell Cluster, has the most
obvious distinguishing feature
of the self-ops: it's a fraternity.
It's also the only coed fraternity
on campus. As well as the
structure of the house and its
assets, says resident John Gon
zales,"everybody has a com
mon social interest."
Gonzales said he chose
Alpha Sig because "the best
houses are the ones which start
out with a selection factor that
generates a common in
terest; diverse people can't
successfully bring themselves
together otherwise." He says
that although everbody has a
personal notion of what the
fraternity actually means to
them, the initiation and the so
cial activities bring people to
gether.
Each of the other self-ops has
its own particular atmosphere.
Often cited are their family
type environments, and the
idea that the houses aren't total
co-ops.
ZAP members distinguish
their house by its continuity as
well as a high level of activity.
"Tradition" is an often-heard
term, and stories of old house

members, many of whom keep
in contact with the house,
abound.
Lambda Nu
Lambda Nu, another often
requested house, becomes
particularly popular in the
spring when Lake Lagunita fills.
Resident Walter Euyang said
"the food is better than in the
dorms, its on the lake, the
rooms are nice," and that as a
self-op, there's an option of
working if you want.
As for the general nature of
Lambda Nu, members say it's
changing. "Lambda Nu used
to be a real party house, but it's
quieter," says Phil Anderson.
Barbara Bacon agrees: "the
house has changed so much in
two years. It's more of a cohe
rent house."
The smallest house featured
in the draw is Phi Sig, a 25-
member self-op on Campus
Drive. Residents such as Steve
Swisher describe it as "defi
nitely unique. It's a quieter
house; peopleare in it because
they like that aspect."Another
resident, Susan Holmes, ag
rees. "It's a small, comforta
ble type of place, almost like a
family."
Co-ops
The co-operative house of
fers the farthest extreme to the
standard dormitory as an alter
native experience for students
here. There is no University
food service, cleaning service
or resident fellow. Finances are
worked out by the students
themselves, as are all social ac
tivities.
Of the six co-ops, Columbae
is one of the most well-known,
both because of its location
and because of the high level
of political consciousness as
sociated with its inhabitants.
Resident Carol Putnam agrees
that there is "a lot of con
sciousness" in the house, but
that there's no pressure on
members to get involved if
they choose not to. The at
mosphere and activity of the
house "changes with the
people," she adds. "We're to
tally self-determined."
Putnam's strongest praise of
the house is the type of person
she finds there: "A person wil
ling to give time to things that
you don't get academic credit,
or pay, for."
Carol Zarucchi, a resident of
Terra, chose herco-op forsimi

lar reasons. She said she liked
the idea of "a place you can call
home, rather than a hotel,"
with a vegetarian food alterna
tive. Other members of Terra
also liked the toleration they
found there, the absence of
peer pressure and high politi
cal commitment.
Every house boasts some
form of individuality and diver
sity of members, just as each
has its own set of facilities,
rooming structure and social
organization. But equally im
portant in every case is the
people who comprise the
house, and that, of course,
changes every year. The best
way to judge whether you
would like a particular house
seems not to be seeing its
ping-pong table and sun
decks, but meeting the mem
bers of the house and finding
out what the people there are
like.

The beautiful European architecture of Roth House attracts many to this all-women facility.


University Row houses and independent co-ops include American
Studies (top), 558 Mayfield (right) and the French House (bottom).

of Campus and Mayfield, and 558 Mayfield are two of the newest
