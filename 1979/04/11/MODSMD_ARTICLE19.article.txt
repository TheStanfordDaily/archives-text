# Netters rip USF
## 
### Steve Pearson 
In a match that was about as
exciting as a textbook index,
Stanford's women's tennis
team whipped the visiting Uni
versity of San Francisco Dons
yesterday, 9-0.
USF, a member of Stanford's
NorCal women's tennis
league, was clearly over
matched by the Cardinals, who
ran quickly through the match
without dropping a set.
In fact, in a total of 18 sets,
USF won the sparse number of
13 games.
Stanford's No. 1 singles
player, Kathy Jordan, defeated
scrappy Lisa Beritzhoff of
USF, 6-3, 6-0. Alycia Moulton
won the No. 2 singles contest
for Stanford by an identical 6-3,
6-0 score over Carol Young of
USF.
Stanford's Lisa Gordon, Julia
Leighton and Marianne Ingard
all dispatched their oppo
nents 6-0, 6-0.
In the doubles, Stanford's
No. 1 team of Caryn Hertel and
Donna Rubin defeated USF's
Beritzhoff and Young 6-4, 6-1.
Cordon and Leighton won
their No. 2 doubles match 6-0,

6-0, and in the No. 3 doubles,
Ingard and Corinne Nevinny
were 6-0, 6-1 victors over their
USF opponents.
Nevinny, who also won her
No. 6 singles match, com
mented on a difficulty that the
Stanford team often faces in its
league matches: "Sometimes
it's really hard to concentrate
in a match that's too easy.
Today it was windy and cold,
which made it even harder to
get really warmed up and in a
groove."
