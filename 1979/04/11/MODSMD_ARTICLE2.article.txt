## Board holds to S. Africa line

The Board of Trustees did not
change its stand on loans to South
Africa in supporting a shareholder
resolution against Wells Fargo Bank
on Monday, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for pub
lic affairs.
The trustees' action followed
unanimous votes in both the Univer
sity Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) and the trustee
Select Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility.
But the board rejected CIR re
commendations on similar proposals
involving loans by Wells Fargo and
Chase Manhattan Bank to the pre
sent government in Chile.
The Wells Fargo resolution sup
ported by the trustees called for an
end to bank loans to the South Afri
can government, its agencies and its
instrumentalities.
Last year, the board abstained on a
similar proposal involving loans by
Bank of America to South Africa.
But Rosenzweig said the two
proposals differed in their scope.
"The proxy resolution on Bank of
America covered loans to the public
and private sector," he said, while
the resolution on Wells Fargo refer
red only to loans to the public sector.
The trustees went on record op
posing loans to the South African
government last year, but were un
willing to oppose loans to private in
stitutions in South Africa, and ac
cordingly abstained, Rosenzweig
said.
The CIR position on Chile sup
ported a moratorium on loans to the
present regime by both Wells Fargo
and Chase Manhattan banks, con
cluding that their loans "contribute
to substantial social injury."
However, the board voted to abs
tain on, rather than vote in favor of,
the shareholder resolution.
According to a statement released

yesterday, the trustees deplored
human rights violations in Chile but
said that if political repression were
the sole test, both American busi
ness and universities would have to
"avoid most of the nations of the
world."
The statement said that the case of
South Africa involved "blatant, sys
tematic, legally sanctioned repres
sion of the nation's majority, based
solely on their race or color" and
presented "a clear instance" justify
ing halting loans to the government.
"The case is less clear in Chile,"
the statement said.
Other board actions included
votes on proposals regarding Pacific
Gas & Electric's Diablo Canyon plant
and the sale of infant formula in de
veloping countries.
Rosenzweig said the board ac
cepted the CIR recommendation
against converting the Diablo Ca
nyon nuclear plant to solar or wind
power because it was "unrealistic."
Rosenzweig said the board re
jected the CIR recommendation to
abstain on the issue of a moratorium
on nuclear power because it felt it
was "premature to make a decision."
The board accepted CIR recom
mendations on only one out of three
resolutions on infant formula in de
veloping nations.
According to Rosenzweig, the
board's action on American Home
Products was consistent with last
year's action, when they also voted
against management.
But the vote on the Bristol-Myers
resolution was counter to the CIR
stance. The board's statement stated
its unhappiness with the perfor
mance of Bristol-Myers, but said
that "the recommendation that the
company end the distribution of all
free samples . . . might work against
the goal of responsible use of a pro
duct."
Rosenzweig said the trustees

thought infant formula was harmful
only if improperly used, and that not
distributing samples to the medical
profession could prevent its proper
usage.
The resolution on Abbott
Laboratories recommended estab
lishment of a review committee to
handle the infant formula con
troversy. The trustees stated that
they were "impressed by the dili
gence with which Abbott
Laboratories has addressed the prob
lem'and that"the establishment of a
review committee . . . would add lit
tle to the company's own efforts."
