# Rowers start rough

The Stanford Crew opened
its season this past weekend
with the men's varsity 8 com
peting in the San Diego Crew
Classic. The remainder of the
men's team, a JV 8, frosh 8 and
novice 8 raced in Eureka on
Humboldt State's home
course.
Held on Mission Bay, the San
Diego Crew Classic annually
attracts eastern rowing powers
such as Harvard and Penn, and
this year was no exception.
Perennial power Harvard
captured the varsity 8 champ
ionship, edging Cal by a
length. Racing for the regatta's
California Cup, Stanford
placed third behind Long
Beach and San Diego State.
Varsity coach Phil Waters
was pleased with the B's per
formance and noted that "if
they rowed a little higher (at a
higher stroke rate), they would
have won."
Despite being overstroked,
they crossed the finish line of
the 2000-meter course in 6:30,

one second behind San Diego
State, and only five seconds
behind Long Beach State.
In Eureka, the JV 8 put on a
spectacular sprint in the final
500 meters to defeat Hum
boldt's JV boat by half a length.
Finishing third and fourth in
the race were Oregon and
Oregon Tech's varsity boats.
The frosh 8 opened up a
two-length lead over Hum
boldt's freshmen in the first
500, and that lead never di
minished as they, too, were
victorious, winning by seven
seconds.
Stanford's novice (no previ
ous experience) 8, composed
entirely of freshmen, was de
feated by a larger Humboldt
squad by a length and a half.
Both the men's and women's
teams open the home season
this upcoming weekend, rac
ing against USC and Santa
Clara at Redwood Shores.
The women's crew team
traveled to Humboldt State this
weekend for the opening races
of its season. The women
competed in four events over

the 1000-meter course. These
included novice and open Bs,
and novice and open 4s.
Although open competition
is not usually filled with novice
rowers, the onfy Stanford
woman at Humboldt with pre
vious experience was team
captain Patty Cashman. The
women put in good efforts, but
their inexperience was evi
dent, as they were defeated in
all four events by the more sea
soned Humboldt varsity.
The best showing of the day
for Stanford was the open 8.
Stanford fell behind at the
start, but at the 600-meter mark
began to close the gap. Hum
boldt was able to hold off Stan
ford's surge, however, and
prevailed at the finish.
The women have races every
weekend throughout spring
quarter in preparation for reg
ional and the Pac-10 Champ
ionships. They have been train
ing throughout the year and
are coached by Bif Brisbin.
Brisbin, a Stanford Biz student,
rowed as an undergraduate at
MIT.
