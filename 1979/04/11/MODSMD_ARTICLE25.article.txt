# Mayotte rallies for success

"I think we have the best
group of freshmen in the na
tion this year," boasted Stan
ford tennis coach Dick Gould.
At the top of that class is shy,
unassuming Tim Mayotte from
Springfield, Mass. Mayotte was
ranked No. 27 in the United
States juniors in 1977. He made
such a rapid improvement last
year that he claimed the top
spot in this year's rankings. Al
ready this year he teamed with
Scott Bondurant to win the
Northern California Intercol
legiate Doubles Champion
ship.
"I credit my improvement to
a lot of hard work and a good
coach," said Mayotte. "My
coach (Bruce Wright) and I de
vised a much better practice
schedule for me last year and I
felt I got much more out of my
practice sessions. Instead of
just playing all the time, I
would work on some part of
my game every day. I felt I got a
lot more out of this and it
helped lift my game."
A family affair
Mayotte comes from a tennis
family that includes eight chil
dren who Mayotte says are "all
good players."
Most notable are his
brothers. John Mayotte is cur
rently the No. 3 ranking player
in the New England section,
and Chris Mayotte, a senior at
the University of South
Carolina and a two time All-
American, is formerly the top
ranked 21-and-under player in

the nation.
"I can't really remember
when I didn't have a racket in
my hand," Mayotte said.
"There was always someone to
help me and I always had
somebody good to play with."
Despite his family's tennis
background, Mayotte did not
really begin to take tennis seri
ously until he was in high
school. However, once he
started to take it seriously,
people started to take notice.
Prep success
Because of his play at
Springfield's Cathedral High
School, Mayotte was named to
the prep All-American team.
Last summer he won the Na
tional Junior Clay Courts, the
Western Championships and
was a semifinalist at the Na
tional Junior Championships.
He also won the New Hamp
shire Open pro tournament in
which he scored a win over
highly touted pro, Woody
Blacker.
"That's the best tennis I've
played in my life,'' said
Mayotte, looking back on the
biggest win of his career so far.
Transition
Coming to Stanford, how
ever, hindered Mayotte'sgame
at first.
"This was the first time in my
life tennis was forced to take a
back seat," he said. "My first
quarter I studied a lot and was
not able to get in the practice I
needed. For me it's not so
much a mental thing as a physi
cal thing. I have to hit a lot of

tennis balls to be sharp. I've
rearranged my schedule now
so I can get in four hours of
practice. I think being 3000
miles away from home may
have hurt me a bit, too."
"It's a big transition for any
freshman here both socially
and academically," said Could.
"This summer Tim came off a
circuit where he had nothing to
worry about but tennis. Now
besides tennis he must worry
about social and academic
pressures of college life."
Mayotte chose Stanford over
Princeton (his second choice)
because he felt this was "the
best balance of great tennis
and academics in the nation."
"I'm really glad to have Tim
here at Stanford, and I think
Stanford is really lucky to have
him, not just off his tennis
either, because he's one of the
nicest kids you'll meet," com
plimented Could. "Nobody
works any harder than Tim
does either. I think that's im
portant, because after a while
your success in tennis depends
on how much you want it.
Tim s got the big shots. He can
punish you off the ground and
at the net. He's got the penet
rating volley. His serve is also a
very tough shot."
A bright prospect
In the short time he has been
here Mayotte has already
gained the respect of his
teammates with his aggressive
style of play.
"I think Tim has an excellent
chance at winning the NCAA

singles title before he's
through here at Stanford,"
stated Peter Rennert, Stan
ford's top player. "I'm really
glad to have him here on the
team."
Mayotte admits that his
serve, when he's serving well,
and his backhand are his bread
and butter shots. He's also
pleased that his movement,
which he considers to be his
biggest weakness, is also im
proving.
However, playing college
tennis at Stanford is a tough
transition for any freshman be
cause of the intense inter-team
competition for spots.
"It's very tough mentally for
anyone on the team," Mayotte
said. "We all are used to being
the best player around but
here everybody on the team is
good. It's still tough for me to
get up forall our matches, but I
think in the long run this com
petitive atmosphere will help
my game."
Mayotte, who cited photo
graphy, going to concerts and
going to the beach as a few of
his spare-time activities, com
mented that his long range
goal is to improve his game to
the point that he can play pro
fessional tennis. But his pre
sent goals are totally team
oriented.
"For us to win the NCAA's
this year would be a great feat,
especially with the loss of
Mitch (Matt Mitchell),"
Mayotte said. "That's what I'm
pointing for right now."
