# Shutout drought ends for Cards
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Stanford's varsity baseball
team recorded its first shutout
of the past two years yesterday
afternoon at Sunken Diamond,
blanking the UC-Davis Aggies
11-0.
Cardinal hurlers Larry Kuhn,
Mark Abbondola and Jerry Bat
tenberg combined efforts and
limited the Aggies to a meager
four hits in the rout.
Stanford's last shutout on
record occurred in early April
of the 1977 season in the San
lose State Tournament. Bruce
Fiala, now a senior on the Car
dinal pitching staff, claimed
that 9-0 victory over Oregon
State.
Phil Wilson and Mike
Codiroli led the Stanford of
fense yesterday, each collect
ing three RBI. Wilson managed
three hits in his four at-bats
while Codiroli went two-for
four.
The Cardinals dominated the
non-league contest from the
word go, but the Aggies
threatened both in the fifth and
seventh innings. Both Batten
berg and Abbondola handled
the scoring threats with rela
tive ease to preserve the shut
out.
Kuhn pitched three innings
of three-up and three-down
baseball to start the game,
whiffing three batters in the
process.
On this high note, the Car
dinals head for Tempe and a
four-game series with Arizona

State. Stanford will play a
fourth game after the regular
three games have been played
to make up for a rainout that
occurred when Arizona State
was here at Stanford earlier this
season.

Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess fears a tough series
with the Sun Devils even
though the ' Cardinals left
Arizona State alone in the
Pac-10 Southern Division cellar
this past weekend by winning

two of their games against Cal.
"We have a really limited
travel squad," said Marquess.
"We can only take seven pitch
ers."
So, seven pitchers are going
to have to handle four full
games with the Sun Devils.
Marquess plans to pitch Joe
LoPresti, Fiala, Paul Grame and
Brian Harrison (in that order)
over the weekend.
The series will open with a 7
p.m. game on Thursday. The
two teams will pair up again at 7
p.m. Friday, and twice on
Saturday — once at 2 p.m. and
finally at 7 p.m.
|Vs win again
The undefeated junior var
sity baseball team extended its
record to 7-0 Monday after
noon with a doubleheader
sweep of the Cal JVs at Ber
keley.
Mike Zboralske went nine
innings in the first game which
Stanford won 8-5, and
freshman Mike Sullivan picked
up thell-2 win in the nightcap.
Today the JVs play a single
game at Santa Clara.
