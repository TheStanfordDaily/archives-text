## Women booters win again 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's women soccer players have been
working overtime lately but unless the game
becomes organized by a trade union the effort
will only show in match scores.
Of Stanford's three victories in sweeping the
Westmont Tournament last weekend in Santa
Barbara, two were decided after regulation time
had run out.
Unfortunately, instead of the "real" arbitrator
of a deadheat finish — overtime playoff periods,
the tourney rules stipulated the inclusion of
shootouts. Players from the two teams take
turns shooting on goal. The ball is placed 35
yards away from the goal and the kicker has five
seconds to attempt getting the ball past the
goalie. The team with the most shots made good
on five attempts wins the shootout and the
match.
In round one, the Cardinals beat the host
Westmont squad 1-0 on a goal with 12 minutes
remaining in the game by Sarah Little, moved
from her usual fullback position to wing.
Although Stanford took the game, a poten
tially serious loss was suffered by the Cards — an
injury to forward Kris McGarrey's knee. She will
be out for the rest of the season and will likely
have to undergo surgery and therapy to have a
chance of playing again.
Other first-round results included UC-Santa
Barbara defeating UC-Davis 3-0, Western
Washngton outlasting Chico State 2-1 and UCLA
forfeiting to California.
Against Cal in the second round match-up,
the Golden Bears jumped out to a quick I-0 lead

only one minute into the game. Sue Handel
evened up the game at a goal apiece by scoring a
goal with five minutes left in the first half. "An
excellent job" by Card goalie Joan Sanders and
accurate shots by Cindy Shorney and Ellen Griep
allowed Stanford to win the shootout and break
the tie, according to assistant coach Tom Miller.
In the tourney finals, Stanford faced Santa
Barbara, the same pairing as last year's Stanford
Invitational finals. After a 0-0 deadlock at
halftime, Santa Barbara took a one-goal lead five
minutes into the second half.
Julie Zender scored a goal on a head shot to tie
the game. Following regulation time, Shorney
and Maria Duryea tallied shootout goals while
UCSB was shut out, earning Stanford the tieb
reaker, the game and the tourney title.
Western Washington took third by beating
Cal, Chico won the consolation title by defeat
ing UCLA and Westmont placed seventh by
besting Davis.
Cards Pauline McNanmara, Shorney, Duryea
and Griep all were selected for the first All-
Tournament team. Stanford now posts a 7-0-1
record against college teams, with a 9-2-1 mark
overall.
According to head coach Phil Wright, the
Southern California effort was "successful, and
reestablished Stanford as the best women's soc
cer team in California, one of the top two in the
West, and among the top five in the nation."
Wednesday's game against Hayward State has
been postponed. The next match will be Satur
day at 2 p.m. at Davis.
