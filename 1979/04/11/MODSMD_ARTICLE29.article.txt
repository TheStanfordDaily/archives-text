Carter favors oil exploration
Washington — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday he favors government action, if necessary,
to require oil companies to explore for new pet
roleum and gas with the money they received from
decontrolled oil prices.
He also said at a nationally-broadcast news con
ference proposals to bar the oil companies from
ownership of competing energy sources, such as
coal mines, "should be explored thoroughly."
Carter said even if Congress enacts his prop
osed oil profits tax, which he expects, the oil com
panies would receive a net boost in profits of $6
billion over the next three years.
The president has said he will begin phasing out
controls on domestic oil prices this June. All price
controls will be lifted by October 1981 under pre
sent law.
Carter said despite the accident at Pennsyl
vania's Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the nation
cannot abandon nuclear power, which supplies
about 13 percent of America's electricity.
But he said the nation must "move more aggres
sively" to expand use of its abundant coal re
sources.
Carter acknowledged that inflation is still a prob
lem', but said "I believe we will see a turn down
ward, very shortly." He repeated that mandatory
wage and price controls or an economic recession
both "are unacceptable to me."
He said he still hopes to submit a balanced fed
eral budget next January for fiscal 1981. "It would
be very attractive politically" and also in tune with
his own fiscal philosophy, the president said.
But he cautioned, "Obviously, you can't predict
what economic conditions will be."
Carter said he sees no prospect of a need for
reinstating the military draft, but added that if con
scription is ever reinstated, "I would like to make it
universal in its scope," with no special treatment
of college students.
Carter also repeated his opposition to legisla
tion that would allow schools to reinstate clas
sroom prayer sessions, even if prayer is voluntary
for students.

Reactor gauges could be faulty
Washington — Forty-two nuclear power plants
have been notified they have water-level gauges that
t;ould give faulty readings during an accident like the
one at Three Mile Island, the chairman of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said yesterday.
Joseph Hendrie told the Senate nuclear regula
tion subcommittee that each of these plants —
well over half of the total 72 operating reactors in
the United States — have gauges like the one
which he said played a role in the accident near
Harrisburg, Pa.
Hendrie said a misleading reading on a pressure
gauge in the control room apparently led
operators to shut off the emergency reactor cool
ifig system prematurely in the early stages of the

March 28 accident.
Hendrie said the gauge had suggested a higher
level of water in the reactor than actually existed.
If the emergency cooling system hadn't been
turned off, he said, the reactor might have been
brought under control then instead of continuing
to heat up — damaging the core and posing the
possibility of a core meltdown that would have
released large amounts of radiation to the central
Pennsylvania countryside.
However, Hendrie said there are no plans to
shut down the other 42 reactors. He said other
gauges in the control room would indicate the true
situation inside the reactor.
Israeli jets blast Lebanon
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli jets flying their first
mission of war since peace was made with Egypt
blasted Palestinian positions in Lebanon yesterday
in retaliation for a bloody terrorist bombing in a
Tel Aviv market.
The explosion in the open-air Carmel market,
crowded with pre-Passover shoppers, killed one
Israeli man and wounded 33 other persons, eight
of them seriously, authorities reported.
The bombing and air raids dampened events in
Cairo later in the day where the 360-member Egyp
tian Parliament overwhelmingly ratified the peace
treaty. The roll call vote was 329-13 with one
abstention and 17 absent.
A Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman
in Beirut reported "dozens" of casualties in the air
raids. A radical Palestinian group said at least three
persons were killed.
Tanzanians march into Kampala
Nairobi, Kenya — Tanzanian troops marched into
the Ugandan capital of Kampala yesterday, follow
ing a jet fighter attack and fierce rocket and artil
lery barrages that appeared to signal imminent
victory in the war against President Idi Amin, resi
dents of the city reported.
There was no word on the whereabouts of the
Ugandan dictator, who started the war six months
ago by occupying a 710-square-mile area of the
Tanzania. Uganda radio broadcast opera from its
transmitters in the center of the city. Telephone
calls to the station went unanswered.
Residents reached by telephone said the Tanza
nian troops entered the city from several direc
tions. They said the Tanzanians were greeted by
dancing in the streets at the outskirts of Kampala.
There were reports of looting after the soldiers
passed.
Earlier, residents in the capital said troops loyal
to Amin were still firing artillary at the invaders
from the town's highest hill.
The Tanzanian attack, including strikes by
MiG-21 jets, came after a night of shelling by forces
located south and southwest of the city. The Tan

zanians have been advancing since defeating
some of Amin's troops in a weekend battle near
Entebbe, 21 miles south of Kampala.
Contract ends Teamsters' strike
Washington — Bargainers for the striking
Teamsters union and idle trucking companies
reached tentative agreement late yesterday on a
new contract to immediately end a 10-day nation
wide work stoppage, a federal mediator said.
Chief federal mediator Wayne Horvitz an
nounced the settlement after more than 12 hours
of intense negotiations yesterday, saying: "The
strike and defensive shutdown by the industry are
being terminated."
Horvitz said procedures for returning about
235,000 Teamsters to work would be implemented
within 24 hours, ending the longest trucking shut
down in the nation's history.
Horvitz emphasized that the tentative pact is
subject to ratification by the Teamsters' rank and
file.
He declined to say whether the new contract
falls within President ]immy Carter's voluntary
wage guidelines. "That matter must await the de
cision of the ratification process," he said.
Tornadoes kill 35
At least 35 people were killed and more than 850
injured yesterday when twisters rampaged across
an area of Texas and Oklahoma known as "Tor
nado Alley." Witnesses counted at least 20 dead in
Wichita Falls, Texas, where two busy shopping
centers were leveled.
An estimated 700 people were treated for in
juries in Wichita Falls, said Dr. James Lee, Civil
Defense medical coordinator. He said at least 500
people would require surgery, hospitalization or
extended doctor's care.
Nursing homes in the area said they had treated
at least 200 persons for minor injuries in addition
to those seeking aid at Bethania Hospital and
Wichita General Hospital.
An undetermined number of people were trap
ped in the rubble of the Sikes and Southmoor
shopping centers, and others were trapped in de
molished buildings elsewhere in Wichita Falls, au
thorities said.
Dow rises to new 1979 high
New York — Reports of progress toward settle
ment of the Teamsters strike helped the stock
market stage a moderate rally yesterday, putting
the Dow Jones industrial average at a new 1979
high. The widely recognized average of 30 blue
chips rose 5.02 to 878.72, its highest close since it
stood at 897.09 last Oct. 13.
Today's weather

Reactor gauges could be faulty
Washington — Forty-two nuclear power plants
have been notified they have water-level gauges that
t;ould give faulty readings during an accident like the
one at Three Mile Island, the chairman of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said yesterday.
Joseph Hendrie told the Senate nuclear regula
tion subcommittee that each of these plants —
well over half of the total 72 operating reactors in
the United States — have gauges like the one
which he said played a role in the accident near
Harrisburg, Pa.
Hendrie said a misleading reading on a pressure
gauge in the control room apparently led
operators to shut off the emergency reactor cool
ifig system prematurely in the early stages of the

March 28 accident.
Hendrie said the gauge had suggested a higher
level of water in the reactor than actually existed.
If the emergency cooling system hadn't been
turned off, he said, the reactor might have been
brought under control then instead of continuing
to heat up — damaging the core and posing the
possibility of a core meltdown that would have
released large amounts of radiation to the central
Pennsylvania countryside.
However, Hendrie said there are no plans to
shut down the other 42 reactors. He said other
gauges in the control room would indicate the true
situation inside the reactor.
Israeli jets blast Lebanon
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli jets flying their first
mission of war since peace was made with Egypt
blasted Palestinian positions in Lebanon yesterday
in retaliation for a bloody terrorist bombing in a
Tel Aviv market.
The explosion in the open-air Carmel market,
crowded with pre-Passover shoppers, killed one
Israeli man and wounded 33 other persons, eight
of them seriously, authorities reported.
The bombing and air raids dampened events in
Cairo later in the day where the 360-member Egyp
tian Parliament overwhelmingly ratified the peace
treaty. The roll call vote was 329-13 with one
abstention and 17 absent.
A Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman
in Beirut reported "dozens" of casualties in the air
raids. A radical Palestinian group said at least three
persons were killed.
Tanzanians march into Kampala
Nairobi, Kenya — Tanzanian troops marched into
the Ugandan capital of Kampala yesterday, follow
ing a jet fighter attack and fierce rocket and artil
lery barrages that appeared to signal imminent
victory in the war against President Idi Amin, resi
dents of the city reported.
There was no word on the whereabouts of the
Ugandan dictator, who started the war six months
ago by occupying a 710-square-mile area of the
Tanzania. Uganda radio broadcast opera from its
transmitters in the center of the city. Telephone
calls to the station went unanswered.
Residents reached by telephone said the Tanza
nian troops entered the city from several direc
tions. They said the Tanzanians were greeted by
dancing in the streets at the outskirts of Kampala.
There were reports of looting after the soldiers
passed.
Earlier, residents in the capital said troops loyal
to Amin were still firing artillary at the invaders
from the town's highest hill.
The Tanzanian attack, including strikes by
MiG-21 jets, came after a night of shelling by forces
located south and southwest of the city. The Tan

zanians have been advancing since defeating
some of Amin's troops in a weekend battle near
Entebbe, 21 miles south of Kampala.
Contract ends Teamsters' strike
Washington — Bargainers for the striking
Teamsters union and idle trucking companies
reached tentative agreement late yesterday on a
new contract to immediately end a 10-day nation
wide work stoppage, a federal mediator said.
Chief federal mediator Wayne Horvitz an
nounced the settlement after more than 12 hours
of intense negotiations yesterday, saying: "The
strike and defensive shutdown by the industry are
being terminated."
Horvitz said procedures for returning about
235,000 Teamsters to work would be implemented
within 24 hours, ending the longest trucking shut
down in the nation's history.
Horvitz emphasized that the tentative pact is
subject to ratification by the Teamsters' rank and
file.
He declined to say whether the new contract
falls within President ]immy Carter's voluntary
wage guidelines. "That matter must await the de
cision of the ratification process," he said.
Tornadoes kill 35
At least 35 people were killed and more than 850
injured yesterday when twisters rampaged across
an area of Texas and Oklahoma known as "Tor
nado Alley." Witnesses counted at least 20 dead in
Wichita Falls, Texas, where two busy shopping
centers were leveled.
An estimated 700 people were treated for in
juries in Wichita Falls, said Dr. James Lee, Civil
Defense medical coordinator. He said at least 500
people would require surgery, hospitalization or
extended doctor's care.
Nursing homes in the area said they had treated
at least 200 persons for minor injuries in addition
to those seeking aid at Bethania Hospital and
Wichita General Hospital.
An undetermined number of people were trap
ped in the rubble of the Sikes and Southmoor
shopping centers, and others were trapped in de
molished buildings elsewhere in Wichita Falls, au
thorities said.
Dow rises to new 1979 high
New York — Reports of progress toward settle

market stage a moderate rally yesterday, putting
the Dow Jones industrial average at a new 1979
high. The widely recognized average of 30 blue
chips rose 5.02 to 878.72, its highest close since it
stood at 897.09 last Oct. 13.

Fair through Thursday but low clouds night and
morning. Warmer Wednesday. Lows in 40s to low
50s, highs in 60s to low 70s.
Carter favors oil exploration
Washington — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday he favors government action, if necessary,
to require oil companies to explore for new pet
roleum and gas with the money they received from
decontrolled oil prices.
He also said at a nationally-broadcast news con
ference proposals to bar the oil companies from
ownership of competing energy sources, such as
coal mines, "should be explored thoroughly."
Carter said even if Congress enacts his prop
osed oil profits tax, which he expects, the oil com
panies would receive a net boost in profits of $6
billion over the next three years.
The president has said he will begin phasing out
controls on domestic oil prices this June. All price
controls will be lifted by October 1981 under pre
sent law.
Carter said despite the accident at Pennsyl
vania's Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the nation
cannot abandon nuclear power, which supplies
about 13 percent of America's electricity.
But he said the nation must "move more aggres
sively" to expand use of its abundant coal re
sources.
Carter acknowledged that inflation is still a prob
lem', but said "I believe we will see a turn down
ward, very shortly." He repeated that mandatory
wage and price controls or an economic recession
both "are unacceptable to me."
He said he still hopes to submit a balanced fed
eral budget next January for fiscal 1981. "It would
be very attractive politically" and also in tune with
his own fiscal philosophy, the president said.
But he cautioned, "Obviously, you can't predict
what economic conditions will be."
Carter said he sees no prospect of a need for
reinstating the military draft, but added that if con

Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli jets flying their first
mission of war since peace was made with Egypt
blasted Palestinian positions in Lebanon yesterday
in retaliation for a bloody terrorist bombing in a
Tel Aviv market.
The explosion in the open-air Carmel market,
crowded with pre-Passover shoppers, killed one
Israeli man and wounded 33 other persons, eight
of them seriously, authorities reported.
The bombing and air raids dampened events in
Cairo later in the day where the 360-member Egyp
tian Parliament overwhelmingly ratified the peace
treaty. The roll call vote was 329-13 with one
abstention and 17 absent.
A Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman
in Beirut reported "dozens" of casualties in the air
raids. A radical Palestinian group said at least three
persons were killed.
Tanzanians march into Kampala
Nairobi, Kenya — Tanzanian troops marched into
the Ugandan capital of Kampala yesterday, follow
ing a jet fighter attack and fierce rocket and artil
lery barrages that appeared to signal imminent
victory in the war against President Idi Amin, resi
dents of the city reported.
There was no word on the whereabouts of the
Ugandan dictator, who started the war six months
ago by occupying a 710-square-mile area of the
Tanzania. Uganda radio broadcast opera from its
transmitters in the center of the city. Telephone
calls to the station went unanswered.
Residents reached by telephone said the Tanza
nian troops entered the city from several direc
tions. They said the Tanzanians were greeted by
dancing in the streets at the outskirts of Kampala.
There were reports of looting after the soldiers
passed.
Earlier, residents in the capital said troops loyal
to Amin were still firing artillary at the invaders
from the town's highest hill.
The Tanzanian attack, including strikes by
MiG-21 jets, came after a night of shelling by forces
located south and southwest of the city. The Tan

zanians have been advancing since defeating
some of Amin's troops in a weekend battle near
Entebbe, 21 miles south of Kampala.
Contract ends Teamsters' strike
Washington — Bargainers for the striking
Teamsters union and idle trucking companies
reached tentative agreement late yesterday on a
new contract to immediately end a 10-day nation
wide work stoppage, a federal mediator said.
Chief federal mediator Wayne Horvitz an
nounced the settlement after more than 12 hours
of intense negotiations yesterday, saying: "The
strike and defensive shutdown by the industry are
being terminated."
Horvitz said procedures for returning about
235,000 Teamsters to work would be implemented
within 24 hours, ending the longest trucking shut
down in the nation's history.
Horvitz emphasized that the tentative pact is
subject to ratification by the Teamsters' rank and
file.
He declined to say whether the new contract
falls within President ]immy Carter's voluntary
wage guidelines. "That matter must await the de
cision of the ratification process," he said.
