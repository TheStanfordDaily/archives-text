### Ben Pollock 
License plates from at least 15 veh
icles parked in campus parking lots
have been stolen since Sunday, ac
cording to Dept. of Public Safety
lieutenant Marvin Moore.
"An officer on patrol noticed there
were plates missing from nine vehi
cles in the Crothers Hall parking lot
late Sunday night," Moore said. "The
victims didn't start calling us until
Monday."
Generally, one plate per car was
taken, Moore said. The missing
plates included out-of-state plates
from Montana and New York as well
as California.
"We have no real leads on it;
there's really no way to follow it up,"
Moore said. Thefts from parking lots
near "Crothers, Mirrielees, and
other places on campus are still
being reported."

Moore said it was possible the thief
could use the plates when commit
ting crimes, and "stealing license
plates for a prank isn't unheard of.
People collect them, too."
While the theft of license plates is a
misdemeanor, Moore added, pos
sesssion of stolen property is a
felony.

to find one of the two New York

"I was out of town for an interview.
When I came back to Crothers, I saw
a sign posted that said to check your
car. And one of my plates was gone,"
Parlini said.
Moore said police began an inves
tigation immediately. More attention
than usual will be paid to campus
parking lots by officers on patrol, he
said.
