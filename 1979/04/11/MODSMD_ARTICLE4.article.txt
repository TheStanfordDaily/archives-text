# During 'zoo and circus
## Senate sets districting plan as referendum issue only 
### Dianne Cahoon 
After much finagling, the ASSU
Senate voted 14-1 last night to place
the districting proposals of its Rules
Committee's election reform re
commendations on the spring ballot
as a referendum issue. The remain
der of the committee's constitutional
proposals will appear on the ballot in
the form of constitutional amend
ments, which must be passed by a 2/3
vote of the students.
Election commissioner Dayna
Coldfine had earlier informed the
senate that the ballot would also con
tain two Council of Presidents slates,
four senior class presidents slates,
two candidates for the Student Con
duct Legislative Council, fee assess
ments and referenda on the draft and
mascot proposals.
Besides election reform, the Rules
Committee proposed constitutional
amendments to eliminate sexist
wording in the constitution, to alter
the specific membership and the
method of removal of student mem
bers of the Committee on Nomina
tions, to clarify the senate voting
procedure on special fee assess
ments and to denote the enactment
timing of the amendments.
'Zoo and a circus'
Drysdale emphasized at the be
ginning of the meeting the impor
tance of "keeping meetings short
and to the point." Nevertheless,
when the senators began to debate
undergraduate and graduate district
ing proposals, Drysdale admitted
that "this is turning into a zoo and a
circus at the same time."
For students to vote on the ratifica
tion of a constitutional amendment,
the constitution requires a 2/3 vote of
the senate to put the proposed mea
sure on the ballot, which means the
support of at least 14 senators. Only
15 senators attended the meeting,
making consensus a necessity for

placing on the ballot the amend
ments as a whole.
"Obviously there is no agreement,
no spirit of compromise, nothing,"
Drysdale lamented on the senate's
inability to reach a working solution.
Senators Geoff Baskir, Erik
Thompson and Dave Steuer were
adamantly opposed to senate ap
proval of districting. Baskir said, "I
don't want to rush this thing
through," while Steuer claimed that
"I just don't want districting on the
ballot." Steuer said that he was
afraid that students might vote for
districting.
Senator Brett Kingstone inter
preted the action of those three
senators as high-handed and irres
ponsible. "Three people want to
make the decision for 12,000 stu
dents," he said.
Several senators opposed district
ing on the grounds that it would un
fairly discriminate between the rights
of the candidates and the voters.
"I think it is unjust for a candidate
to be able to run in any district while
voters are restricted to voting in their
districts," said COP member Regina

Petty. She also contended that dis
tricting would not allow adequate
representation of special interest
groups, such as minority students.
Only the last-minute return of Sen.
Alex Alben and changes in voting by
Baskir and Steuer salvaged the mo
tion for the districting referendum
and the other constitutional
amendments. The senate had al
ready conceded the impossibility of a
districting amendment.
Even if the districting referendum
passes, districting will still depend
upon the senate approving the idea
and then a possible run-off election
for the requisite 2/3 student ap
proval.
Drysdale noted that "If districting
doesn't pass, the rest (of the propos
als) means nothing." He cited dis
tricting as the action that "could save
the senate" by enforcing senator ac
countability.
A special senate meeting, called
for tomorrow, will entail the ap
pointment of two more student
members of the Committee on
Nominations and a speech by Presi
dent Richard Lyman.
