# Over student funds
## Social Security rule changes proposed 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
Students receiving Social Security
benefits will now not only be re
quired to follow more stringent pro
cedures for proof of registration in
order to get their money, but under a
new proposal from President Jimmy
Carter they may lose them all to
gether.
Since 1965, social security pay
ments have been made to unmarried
students 18 to 22 years of age on the
social security record of a parent who
gets retirement or disability pay
ments or has died. In 1978, over
850,000 students received about $1.7
billion in benefits, with an average
monthly payment of $1 f>4, according
to a report from the San Jose Social
Security office.
But the Carter Administration
wants these benefits phased out,
based on the recent findings of the
General Accounting Office that at
least 100,000 students receive more
educational assistance from the gov
ernment than they need to cover col
lege costs.
There are other, duplicate aid
programs available which have come
into effect since the Social Security
student aid program started in 1965
that could meet students' needs, ac
cording to the GAO.
As a result of the GAO report, the
House Ways and Means Committee
is currently considering a proposal
that would phase out student pay
ments completely over a four-year
period ending in 1984. Such a move
would save the government $162
million next year, a savings that
would increase to $1.8 billion by

1984, according to the San Jose re
port.
At the same time, the Social Sec
urity Administration (SSA) has de
cided to toughen its proof of enroll
ment requirements due to an esti
mated $100 to $300 million in over
payment of student benefits every
year. Until now, the SSA has relied
on an "honor system," accepting the
student's word that he or she was in
school.
Starting at the end of this academic
year, however, students will have to
obtain the signature of the registrar
on a certification statement twice a
year to prove they are enrolled.
Otherwise payments will be sus
pended and eventually terminated.
Under the old system, the SSA
could prosecute fraud cases but
rarely verified student reports of en
rollment. With the new system, if the
completed certification form is not
returned within 60 days, benefits will
be suspended. The student will then
receive a second notice and if he fails
to return it, payments will be termi
nated and an investigation of previ
ous payments will be made. The
new system will not require a large
reporting burden for school officials,
according to the San Jose report, as
merely their signature on the verifi
cation statement will be required.
Proponents of the student benefits
program believe that it was designed
not only to cover the costs of educa
tion, but to provide extra income for
the student's family. They feel that
like other forms of social security,
student benefits should not be based
on need.
