# Lyman: A decision-maker outside of the University
## 
### Kurt Cobb First of two parts 
Since becoming president of the
University in 1970, Richard Lyman
has been admitted to that small circle
of foundation trustees, corporate di
rectors and association bigwigs who
run this country's major institutions.
While some may consider the re
sponsibilities of running a major uni
versity a sufficient challenge, Lyman
currently must devote time to five
other organizations to which he be
longs in the capacity of a decision
maker.
Lyman is a trustee for The Roc
kefeller Foundation and The Car
negie Foundation for the Advance
ment of Teaching (CFAT), both
headquartered in New York. He is
also a member of the National Coun
cil on the Humanities which gives
grants much as private foundations
do, but which administers the Na
tional Endowment for the
Humanities set up and funded
primarily by Congress.
He is also currently the chairman
of the executive committee of the
Association of American Univer
sities, a consortium of 50 research
oriented universities, having served
on that executive committee since

1971.
And last December he was elected
to the board of directors of Interna
tional Business Machines Corp.
(IBM).
Even Lyman admits that "one has
to watch that (commitments outside
of the University). It could get to be
too much."
The National Council meets four
times a year, the Rockefeller board
three times, and the CFAT board
twice. Though the time commitment
may seem great, "I think there is
some reason to believe that the Uni
versity benefits from what might be
considered pro bono (for the public
good) work to a certain extent" by its
president, Lyman said.
"I don't think there is anything in
all these organizations that could be
described as totally unrelated to
Stanford," he explained.
Lyman's position on the boards of
the Rockefeller foundation and CFAT
make him one of about 100,000
foundation trustees in the country
who control $31 billion in assets and
give away $2 to $3 billion yearly to
some 26,000 different organizations.
According to Rockefeller's 1977
annual report, the foundation has as
sets of $750 million and gave away

almost $40 million in 1976, the year
Lyman first became a trustee.
The foundation was originally set
up by oil millionaire John D. Roc
kefeller in 1913 and concentrates its
giving to solve problems in the areas
of hunger, health and population,
though it is also concerned with edu
cation, civil rights and the arts.
CFAT is the smaller of the two, hav
ing only $21 million in assets accord
ing to its 1978 annual report. It does
not make grants, but was set up in
1905 by industrialist Andrew Car
negie to provide pensions for retired
university, college and technical
school teachers. It also conducts and
publishes research on higher educa
tion.
The National Endowment for the
Humanities, though funded by the
U.S. government, acts much like a
foundation. Total grants for the fiscal
year ending July 1976 were $86 mill
ion. Congress authorized $120 mill
ion for 1979.
Lyman is one of 25 members of the
administering National Council, ap
pointed by the President of the Un
ited States and confirmed by the Se
nate for six-year terms.
According to Lyman, private foun
dations are an important force for

pluralism in this country. He added
that it is important that organizations
outside the government be able to
pursue projects that are in the public
interest.
"Most of the societies in the world
that don't have this tradition have a
harder time maintaining freedom,"
he explained.
"The foundation as a force for
pluralism has been called into ques
tion by some who say foundation
leadership has become too
homogeneous."
John Nason, in a study entitled,
"Trustees and the Future of Founda
tions," wrote that foundation trus
tees "are overwhelmingly male, Pro
testant, university educated, well to
do, and in their latesos orearly6os."
Trustees are drawn chiefly from
the legal and business professions
"with a fair sprinkling of educators,"
according to Nason. Women com
promise only 19 percent of all trus
tees and minorities only 0.3 percent.
Lyman himself fits Nason's de
scription of the typical trustee well,
but Lyman pointed out that the
Nason study included the numeri
cally preponderant smaller founda
tionswhich are still dominated by the
families or individuals who set them

up. The big national foundations
have made an attempt to diversify
their memberships, he said.
In fact, the 24-member board of
Rockefeller now has two women and
four male minority members. CFAT's
25-member board has seven women,
two of whom are minority members,
and three other male minority mem
bers.
But the method of selecting trus
tees continues to isolate those
boards. Currently, there is not one
"foundation (board) in the country
that isn't self-perpetuating that I
know of," said Robert Bothwell,
executive director of the National
Committee for Responsive Philan
thropy in Washington, D.C.
"It's sort of like incest," Bothwell
said.
Initially foundation trustees are
chosen by the donor who sets up the
foundation. Thereafter vacancies on
the board are filled by a vote of the
board.
Rockefeller has three-year terms
for its trustees, but according to Roc
kefeller spokesman Henry Romney
trustees have "generally served until
their retirement."
CFAT has four-year terms for its
trustees which are routinely re

newed, according to CFAT spokes
person Dee Holder. No trustee can
serve for more than eight years.
Given this method of selection it is
not surprising to find people of simi
lar attitudes and backgrounds on the
same board, Bothwell said. After all,
it is natural for donors or current
members to put persons on their
boards who are like themselves, he
explained.
Lyman also voiced a similar con
cern saying, "I think when a board of
any kind is too homogeneous things
are likely to slip through by not ar
ousing anybody's curiosity or oppos
ition. If everyone in the room has a
common background it is only too
likely that on many subjects they will
share common prejudices or com
mon failures of vision."
Nason said this homogeneity in at
titudes has led to what he called a
"lack of imagination" in foundation
giving. For example, Nason wrote, it
is easier to give money to a museum
of art than to search out struggling
artists, or to give to a city's symphony
orchestra rather than seek out new
dance groups or experimental theat
ers.
Lyman agreed that "on the balance
foundations are more conservative
and traditionalist than they ought to
be." But foundations are weary of
making unconventional grants be
cause such grants "tend to invite
criticism which quickly gets trans
lated into political pressures," he
added.
Because boards are self
perpetuating they "aren't accounta
ble to anyone in a practical sense,"
said Mary Anna Colwell, a UC-
Berkeley sociologist doing doctoral
work on foundations.
But Lyman sees this as an advan
tage. "The more you try to make
them (foundations) formally ac
countable to any human group, the
more you'redrawn into makingthem
an adjunct of government rather
than leaving them to be in some
sense an offsetting force in society,"
he said.
Private foundations are "a force
that can speak independently of
political pressures to a far greater ex
tent than democratically elected offi
cials do," he explained.
However, because there is no
body to which trustees are formally
responsible, conflict of interest
raises a particularly difficult ques
tion.

Tax reform laws now on the books
require thorough disclosure of
foundation grants and heavy penal
ties for failures to disclose, according
to Nason. This makes it difficult for
trustees to conceal any illicit grants
that would give them direct financial
gain. But there remains the problem
of grants to institutions with which a
trustee may be affiliated.
A case in point is the fact that the
Rockefeller Foundation has made
some grants to Stanford personnel
since Lyman became a trustee.
Lyman explained, however, that
Rockefeller's policy expressly bars
trustees from discussion and voting
on grants to institutions with which
they are affiliated.
Bothwell pointed out, however,
that such restrictions will not stop
trustees from seeking advice infor
mally from a trustee affiliated with
the institution in question.
Colwell, once a foundation direc
tor herself, said that some founda
tions do not even consider affilia
tions with the recipient organization
a conflict of interest. In fact, these
foundations believe that the board
member who can inform them best
about the needs of a symphony, for
example, is someone directly af
filiated with that symphony.
