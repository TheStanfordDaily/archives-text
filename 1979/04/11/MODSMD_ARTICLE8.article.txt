# HEW withholding documents
## 
### Associated Press 
The Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW)
is witholding documents that
show it spent more than
$100,000 — at least six times
more than the $15,000 it admit
ted — in celebrating the de
partment's 25th birthday last
year, government sources say.
One source, who asked not
to be identified, said: "Any
comprehensive accounting of
the staff time that went into it,
the money spent on exhibits,
printing, expenses and ev
erything, would put it well over
$100,000."
The official cost estimate
made by HEW's Office of Pub
lic Affairs at the time of the

two-day celebration of the
agency's 25th anniversary a
year ago was $15,000.
The celebration took place
last May 23-24. HEW's actual
anniversary was last April 11.
The birthday party featured
an outdoor celebration star
ring Big Bird of the HEW
financed "Sesame Street" tele
vision show and HEW Secret
ary Joseph Califano Jr. There
were concerts and booths and
exhibits showing some of the
work performed by the de
partment.
There also was a $10-per
ticket "hoedown" in HEW's
penthouse cafeteria, an even
ing gala with square dancing
and ranch-style food. Offi
cials said the events, which re
quired tickets for admission,
would be self-supporting.
Last June, The Associated
Press filed a request under the
Freedom of Information Act
seeking any records relating to

the cost of the birthday celeb
ration.
The department said that the
records would be made availa
ble, but none of the materials
has ever been released.
HEW spokesman John Blam
phin, who hadbeen designated
to collect the materials, said
the materials still were being
compiled.
Department sources said the
materials that had been as
sembled showed the expendi
tures "substantially surpassed
the $15,000 figure." But they
said many of the funds were
spent from accounts that.
would not be likely to turn up
in a routine records search.
"There were work crews
working practically around the
clock for days," one source
said. "But those costs and the
overtime they ran up were ap
parently charged to facilities
management."
