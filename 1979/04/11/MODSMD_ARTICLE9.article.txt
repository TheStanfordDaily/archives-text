sity housing available through

examined on page 5.)

Next week many under
graduates will turn away from
their studying for a brief look
to the future; the question of
where to live during the next
school year will become of
paramount importance.
Among the housing options,
probably the two most con
troversial and misconceived
are the Manzanita Park trailers
and Mirrielees apartments.
For some, these names will
conjure up visions of
aluminum boxes that turn to
ovens in the late spring and
summer, and become freezers
when the temperatures drop at
night; of walls so thin that they
seem to amplify the voices
within; or of tomblike halls
where even one's neighbor
remains a mystery behind
closed doors.
However, residents of Mir
rielees and Manzanita said that
many of the horrors en
visioned never come true.
They said that one begins to

realize that a good life can be
had in these alternatives to the
dorms, houses or off-campus
living if one goes into it with
the proper frame of mind.
Physically the two student
residences are quite different.
Manzanita, a cluster of mobile
homes, was originally con
ceived in 1969 as a means of
temporarily easing the "hous
ing crunch." Mirrielees, on the
other hand, is a permanent
apartment building, occupied
by both graduates and under
graduates. Yet residents from
both complexes agreed that
the greatest advantage to living
in these areas is the freedom
and independence. Residents
have their own bathroom and
kitchen in their apartment and
many have their own bed
room.
In Manzanita, students have
a choice between joining an
eating club or cooking their
own meals, which can often be
cheaper than University food
service. "The advantage a
trailer has is you get to cook for
yourself and you can have din
ner parties there,"commented
three-year veteran "Manzani
tan" Kathy Rappaport.
Mirrielees inhabitant Jane

Leonard said her favorite
points about living in the
apartments were that she
could cook for herself and eat
what and when she wanted.
She added that because of
food, the actual housing bill
was lower in Mirrielees than in
the dorms.
In general these two resi
dences seem to offer many of
the advantages of living in an
off-campus apartment with
none of the problems of com
muting to class.
A disadvantage of the trailers
is that they are not the place to
meet other people, Rappaport
said. The view of a social life in
the trailers and Mirrielees was
generally fairly negative. Little
interaction occurs among the
trailers or apartment residents,
and there is little of the spirit
found in houses and most
dorms. People felt that it was
harder to meet other students
outside the trailer or apart
ment.
Isolation
Social life is not too "wild" in
either residence. "This is just
not a fun place to live," one
Mirrielees resident said. In Mir
rielees some people said they
felt that the cause of the isola
tion in the apartments was
partly due to the attitudes of
those living there. People
seem to move there for both
the nicer living conditions and
the privacy, and this shows
greatly in the party attendance.
In Manzanita, on the other
hand, the problem was diffe
rent. "The anti-social life
doesn't come from the type of
people but from the fact you're
living in a partitioned house,"
said one resident. There is
some interaction between the
trailers, particularly in the
spring when oven-like temper
atures force people to open up
their doors and meet their
neighbors. In addition, there
are inter-trailer parties, plays
and other functions which
bring people together.
Other good and bad points
found in these clusters are
peculiar only to Manzanita.
Though much of what is said of
these trailers is exaggerated, it
is undeniable that the furnace
like atmosphere does exist dur
ing hot weather and that at

night, when the temperatures
outside drop, so do room
temperatures. In addition, the
trailer walls are thin and
everyone interviewed agreed
that privacy is somewhat li
mited by the ability to hear
what is going on three trailers
away.
In contrast, Mirrielees is re
latively quiet. One resident
admitted never having to go to
the library since it was always
quiet in her apartment.
One problem is found in
both Manzanita and Mirrielees
— the age-old war of man ver
sus insect. During the warmer
months of the year, ants infest
the residences. In Mirrielees,
Leonard said, "Believe it or
not, ants got up to the third
floor and came out our drain
into the shower."
In the final analysis, each of
these housing options has
something positive to offer
particular students. Ants and
all, many students choose Mir
rielees or Manzanita as their
first choice in the draw.

The trailers in Manzanita Park offer more than paper-thin walls. According to one resident, being able to
cook for yourself and having your own dinner parties is a major advantage to Manzanita.

said one resident. There is
some interaction between the
trailers, particularly in the
spring when oven-like temper
atures force people to open up
their doors and meet their
neighbors. In addition, there
are inter-trailer parties, plays
and other functions which
bring people together.
Other good and bad points
found in these clusters are
peculiar only to Manzanita.
Though much of what is said of
these trailers is exaggerated, it
is undeniable that the furnace
like atmosphere does exist dur
ing hot weather and that at

night, when the temperatures
outside drop, so do room
temperatures. In addition, the
trailer walls are thin and
everyone interviewed agreed
that privacy is somewhat li
mited by the ability to hear
what is going on three trailers
away.
In contrast, Mirrielees is re
latively quiet. One resident
admitted never having to go to
the library since it was always
quiet in her apartment.
One problem is found in
both Manzanita and Mirrielees
— the age-old war of man ver
sus insect. During the warmer
months of the year, ants infest
the residences. In Mirrielees,
Leonard said, "Believe it or
not, ants got up to the third
floor and came out our drain
into the shower."
In the final analysis, each of
these housing options has
something positive to offer
particular students. Ants and
all, many students choose Mir
rielees or Manzanita as their
first choice in the draw.

The trailers in Manzanita Park offer more than paper-thin walls. According to one resident, being able to
cook for yourself and having your own dinner parties is a major advantage to Manzanita.
(Editor's note: This is the last
in a two-part series on Univer
sity housing available through
the draw. Row houses, co-ops,
self-ops and theme houses are
examined on page 5.)

Next week many under
graduates will turn away from
their studying for a brief look
to the future; the question of
where to live during the next
school year will become of
paramount importance.
Among the housing options,
probably the two most con
troversial and misconceived
are the Manzanita Park trailers
and Mirrielees apartments.
For some, these names will
conjure up visions of
aluminum boxes that turn to
ovens in the late spring and
summer, and become freezers
when the temperatures drop at
night; of walls so thin that they
seem to amplify the voices
within; or of tomblike halls
where even one's neighbor
remains a mystery behind
closed doors.
However, residents of Mir
rielees and Manzanita said that
many of the horrors en
visioned never come true.
They said that one begins to

realize that a good life can be
had in these alternatives to the
dorms, houses or off-campus
living if one goes into it with
the proper frame of mind.
Physically the two student
residences are quite different.
Manzanita, a cluster of mobile
homes, was originally con
ceived in 1969 as a means of
temporarily easing the "hous
ing crunch." Mirrielees, on the
other hand, is a permanent
apartment building, occupied
by both graduates and under
graduates. Yet residents from
both complexes agreed that
the greatest advantage to living
in these areas is the freedom
and independence. Residents
have their own bathroom and
kitchen in their apartment and
many have their own bed
room.
In Manzanita, students have
a choice between joining an
eating club or cooking their
own meals, which can often be
cheaper than University food
service. "The advantage a
trailer has is you get to cook for
yourself and you can have din
ner parties there,"commented
three-year veteran "Manzani
tan" Kathy Rappaport.
Mirrielees inhabitant Jane

Leonard said her favorite
points about living in the
apartments were that she
could cook for herself and eat
what and when she wanted.
She added that because of
food, the actual housing bill
was lower in Mirrielees than in
the dorms.
In general these two resi
dences seem to offer many of
the advantages of living in an
off-campus apartment with
none of the problems of com
muting to class.
A disadvantage of the trailers
is that they are not the place to
meet other people, Rappaport
said. The view of a social life in
the trailers and Mirrielees was
generally fairly negative. Little
interaction occurs among the
trailers or apartment residents,
and there is little of the spirit
found in houses and most
dorms. People felt that it was
harder to meet other students
outside the trailer or apart
ment.
Isolation
Social life is not too "wild" in
either residence. "This is just
not a fun place to live," one
Mirrielees resident said. In Mir
rielees some people said they
felt that the cause of the isola
tion in the apartments was
partly due to the attitudes of
those living there. People
seem to move there for both
the nicer living conditions and
the privacy, and this shows
greatly in the party attendance.
In Manzanita, on the other
hand, the problem was diffe
rent. "The anti-social life
doesn't come from the type of
people but from the fact you're
living in a partitioned house,"
said one resident. There is
some interaction between the
trailers, particularly in the
spring when oven-like temper
atures force people to open up
their doors and meet their
