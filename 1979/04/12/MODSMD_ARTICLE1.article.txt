# Brower: End nuke power proliferation
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Environmentalist David Brower
attacked the spread of nuclear
power and the dangers of radia
tion before a receptive audience
of about 250 in Kresge Auditorium
Tuesday night.
Brower, the keynote speaker
for Environment Month here, said
that if this country "does not pay
attention to the ending of nuclear
proliferation. . . every other con
cern is academic." He also told his
audience, "It's your turn" to
explore the causes of environ
mental problems and to take re
sponsibility for solving them.
Founder and president of
Friends of the Earth, a Bay Area
based international organization
which lobbies for environmental
protection measures, Brower said
that it is "reckless" for our coun
try "to pretend to have a national
defense . . . but leave yourself
open through the back door" by
pursuing a policy of reliance on
nuclear power with its potential
for destructive radiation poison
ing.
Safety possible?
Director of the Sierra Club from
1952-69, Brower quipped that it
certainly is possible to build a
"safe" nuclear power plant "if you
make sure that there will be no
operator error, no construction
error, no sabotage and no act of
Cod."
He said that as long as these
possibilities exist, infallibility is
necessary to guarantee safety
from the effects of a possible re
lease of radiation.
Brower, who has been nomi
nated by a California con
gressman for a Nobel Peace Prize
because of his anti-nuclear ef
forts, sharply criticized the Carter
administration's energy policy of
"strength through exhaustion."
The administration favors using
precious U.S. reserves of fuel to
avoid dependence on foreign
sources of energy, he said.
While praising certain efforts of
President jimmy Carter to end

nuclear proliferation, such as his
veto of the breeder reactor ap
propriation, Brower said that Car
ter has fallen under "bad influ
ences," particularly those of
Energy Secretary lames
Schlesinger.
Exponential rate
"Any society that depends
upon the use of its resources at an
exponential rate cannot survive if
those resources are not increas
ing exponentially — and ours are
not," Brower said.
He warned of the perils of
"wanton use" of land, air, water
and other resources and said,
"I've seen it destroy a state — this
one."
Brower said that it is far too easy
for citizens to lose sight of "just
how precious our resources are."
If the entire history of the earth
were reduced to a period of six
days, Brower claimed that all that
is known about agriculture and
the employment of other re
sources has been learned in the
last Vh seconds.
And, he said, the idea that "we
could get away with exponential
growth" has been around for just
one five-hundredth of a second.
But, he said, that is long enough.
"Grosser national product'
He said that the United States
by being "anxious that no one
have a 'grosser national pro
duct,' " is showing negligence for
important environmental con
cerns and for life itself. The Un

ited States must learn "that DNA is
greater than GNP," Brower said.
Brower also said, in discussing
nuclear power, that "to take the
miracle of DNA and expose it to
radiation is reckless . . . and ir
responsible." He explained that,
although he had been an advocate
of nuclear power for 23 years,
"when you're wrong you don't
have to stay wrong."
"What I inherited, my children
have not inherited," Brower said,
in explaining that when he grew
up in Berkeley, he had been bles
sed with "a bay bigger than the
one now, air you could look
through, blossoms on both sides
of the bay, wild hills behind (the
UC-Berkeley) campus, more ag
ricultural land (which is) now
down the drain, fine forests not
there anymore and a time with no
problem of nuclear waste or war."
'Stay and fix it'
But, he said, when his son once
said to him, "Let's get out of here
(Berkeley)," he replied, "No, let's
stay and fix it."
He cited several members of
the friends of the Farth who had
been effective in lobbying for
changes in resource policy and
who had successfully blocked
nuclear power development.
The speech was the keynote
address for Environment Month
here, which will continue into
early May with a number of
speakers, panel discussions and
other presentations.
