Eliminate inserts
From afar it appeared to be
the scene of a horrible bicycle
accident. Students were
gathering and a brisk spring
wind was blowing massive
amounts of paper in alt direc
tions. "Bio. 23 notes where
they belong," I thought as I
peddled to the scene. How
ever, as I drew nearer I realized
there were no injured persons
or twisted bicycles, only a
group of harried students
grasping Dailys on the way to
class. But whence all this
paper, creating such an eye
sore and interfering with the
bicyclists? I cringed, "Daily in
serts . . . again."
I resent the fact that my
school paper is primarily re
sponsible for an action which is
not only terribly wasteful, but
in addition results in the equi
valent of numerous cans of
trash being scattered all about
campus. I like to think that our
Daily staff is aware of the plight
of the environment on this

planet, and is sufficiently intel
ligent to take actions which
would eliminate such irres
ponsible practices at this uni
versity.

that you should be condemn
ing those individuals who are
not clean enough to throw the
Daily inserts away if they do not
wish to keep them. We recog
nize that the inserts are poten
tially wasteful, but we insert
them because people pay us to
do so. If advertisers pay us,
students don't have to. In
order to keep the Daily free
(except for the nominal fee as
sessment charge) every day,
advertising revenues must
continue to come in.
We are concerned with the
problem of Daily inserts, but
the only reasonable solution
we can see to the problem is to
sell individual subscriptions at
a substantially higher price and
to distribute the paper to the

individuals. For a variety of
reasons, including our com
mitment to informing the
community at low cost, we do
not feel this is a viable alterna
tive. We therefore must ask
Daily readers to have enough
courtesy for others to pick up
their inserts when they pick up
the Daily.

Don't get involved
Joe Walder's recent diat
ribe against a sane foreign pol
icy (Daily, April 6) ignores sev
eral crucial considerations.
Walder errs in several respects
in claiming that America's need
for natural resources necessi
tates a policy of foreign inter
ventionism.
First, nations far less exten
sive and far less resource-rich
than the United States have
historically demonstrated an
ability to survive for a consid
erable period even though cut
off from "vital" resources
(e.g., Germany).

Second, modern technology
makes us not more but less de
pendent on any particular re
source. During the Bronze
Age, if one were cut off from
one's supply of tin, one was un
able to manufacture "modern"
weapons. Modern technology,
on the other hand, makes pos
sible an impressive degree of
substitution among alternative
resources.
Finally, it is American foreign
policy itself which constitutes
the greatest threat to a continu
ing flow of resources from ab
road: let us recall that the Arab
oil embargo was the result of
the American policy of meddl
ing in the affairs of the Mideast.
In reality, both the material
and moral interests of the Un
ited States and of the rest of the
world are best served by
America's adhering to a liberta
rian foreign policy of military
and political non-intervention.
