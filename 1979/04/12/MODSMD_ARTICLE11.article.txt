## Decontrol helps reduce inflation 
### 
The strength of American
competition, the invisible
hand of Adam Smith, has been
stifled. Today we are faced with
"stagflation" â€” nearly
double-digit price inflation,
simultaneously growing un
employment and a possible re
cession in the future. We are
also hampered by unnecessary
governmental regulations.
President Jimmy Carter took
an important step toward al
lowing prices to be determined
by free competition, by calling
for the deregulation of oil
prices recently.
The Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) has just announced
that oil prices will increase by
14.5 percent. The Department
of Energy predicted a gasoline
price rise of 9 cents a gallon by
1980, and decontrol would add
another 3.7 cents a gallon. But
oil prices could rise 12.4 cents a
gallon by 1980, almost as much
as under decontrol.
Higher prices at the pump
encourage conservation,
domestic production and in
vestigation into alternative
energy sources, and
strengthen the dollar. Saudi
Arabia is deadly serious about
its limits on output and world
petroleum supplies are
stretched thin by the Iranian
crisis. Decontrol is the most ef
ficient means of reducing the
nation's dependence on
foreign oil and helping to nar
row the trade gap.
Means to achieve deregula
tion will become possible in
|une and automatic in 1981
when the control law expires.
This is the feasible remedy for
inflation. In addition, moder
ate restraints on government
spending and on the money
supply, along with increased
productivity, are needed to
pull us out of stagflation.
Recognizing the seriousness
of our current economic situa
tion, Carter named former
Civil Aeronautics Board
Chairman Alfred Kahn as his
chief inflation fighter. Kahn
remembered Adam Smith. He
tore red tape into shreds,
largely deregulated airlines,
restoring healthy competition
with lower air fares. Clearly,
anything that can be done to
deregulate transportation in
dustries and lower their rates
will show up in price indexes
and reduce the pressure for
wage increases.
That means that Carter's
mandatory wage and price
controls would be unneces

sary. Presently, his plan sets a
limit of 7 percent on total wage
increases, and 6 percent on
annual price increases. If Car
ter imposes these guidelines,
he faces the record of the past
three decades.
Three times since World War
11, presidents have tried to deal
with inflation by using controls
without success. In 1952 Tru
man froze prices and wages;
starting in 1962, Kennedy and
then Johnson tried to hold
down productivity increases;
and in 1971 Nixon became the
first president to invoke man
datory wage and price freezes
in peacetime.
During these years, any
moderate success was due to a
slowing down of the whole
economy through tighter fiscal
policy, tax increases and the
end of panic buying. The con
trols may have seemed politi
cally effective to suppress infla
tion, but mainly they served
only as a lid, which burst once
controls were lifted, causing
faster inflation than would
have occurred without con
trols.
If similar mandatory controls
are implemented today, the
economic slowdown could

send the country into a deep
recession. Businesses will
comply only if the guidelines
are fairly loose and voluntary,
so that wages covered by con
tracts with escalator clauses
can be kept within standards,
and raw material prices can
fluctuate.
Economists must not be
fooled by history. Controls
were implemented in the past
to protect the success of the
politician in office. In the long
run these controls have dis
torted and disrupted the
economy, causing prices to be
higher than they would be had
they been allowed to move
freely all along.
Both liberal and conservative
economists agree that compul
sory regulations are not the
answer. Experts agree because
controls are inherently unfair.
Controls freeze wage/price re
lationships and prevent neces
sary adjustments.
Controls only affect domes
tic prices. If prices are held
below those in world markets,
the United States will export
more, causing inflationary
domestic shortages.
Controls distort the normal
allocation of resources. Under

controls, free market price sig
nals vanish and shortages be
come frequent.
Controls only delay infla
tion. In 1972 when controls
were lifted, prices shot up in
double-digit percentages.
Controls deal only with the
symptoms, not the causes of
inflation. Inflation comes from
an increase in the supply of
money exceeding the supply of
goods and services. Controls
do not stop this condition.
Governmental control is not
the device for tackling infla
tion. Decontrol is. Deregulat
ing transportation industries,
wages and oil prices will expe
dite the reduction of inflation.
Competition has always
been of key importance to the
American economic system.
We must unleash the competi
tive profit motive to make con
tinued advancement possible.
The government must elimi
nate impediments to the work
ings of our free market system.
And in order to ameliorate the
flaws in our economy, we must
shake, rather than glove, the
invisible hand of Adam Smith.
