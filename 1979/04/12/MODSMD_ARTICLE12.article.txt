## Nuclear draft a possibility 
### 
Once upon a time there
were nuclear power plants ac
ross the United States. The na
tion was firmly committed to
the development and use of
nuclear power as an energy
source. But then something
unexpected happened. De
spite the calm assurances of
experts everywhere, a serious
accident occurred at the Three
Mile Island nuclear plant near
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
Fordaysa meltdown or other
disaster was feared, but none
took place. The experts were
again quick to assure the pub
lic that the radiation released
into the air and ground for
miles surrounding the plant
was harmless. Secretary of
Energy lames Schlesinger said
soothingly, "The incident near
Harrisburg underscores how
safe nuclear power has always
been."Those who fled the area
returned to their homes. Every
thing seemed to be returning
to normal.
But then something unex
pected happened again. Afraid
of another nuclear accident,
hundreds of workers at atomic
plants throughout the country
quit their jobs. Except for the
poor and minorities who
couldn't find jobs elsewhere,
few people were willing to
apply to take the place of the
workers who had quit. The
atomic industry reported that
for the first time it was not able
to meet its quotas for the vol
unteer nuclear working force,
despite increased salaries and
benefits.
In the midst of this crisis,
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Calif.)
rose to the challenge. He
proposed a National Nuclear
Service plan, requiring all
youths between the ages of 17
and 26 to register for a nuclear
draft. In return for four years of
ca'lege benefits, those actually
drafted would serve six months
of basic training, followed by
18 months of actual service in
one of the country's nuclear
power plants.
When questioned about his
plan, McCloskey replied, "No
reasonable young person
today wants to serve in a nuc
lear power plant. That's why

the volunteer nuclear working
force has too many blacks and
poor people in it. In a democ
ratic society we should have a
cross-section of young citizens
working in atomic plants.
Young people should serve
their country in this manner in
return forthe privilege of living
in America."
Swayed by the brilliance of
McCloskey's proposal and by
the promise of campaign con
tributions from the atomic in
dustry, Congress passed his
National Nuclear Service plan
by a small majority. Soon
enough workers would be
drafted to serve in nuclear
plants. Everything seemed to
be returning to normal.
But then the unexpected oc
curred once more. Tens of
thousands of young people ac
ross the nation refused to re
gister for McCloskey's nuclear

draft. Many others went to
Canada. Though some of
those refusing to register were
sent to jail, the sheer numbers
of the nuclear draft resisters
clogged up the courts and ef
fectively prevented prosecu
tion.
There could be only one
consequence of the nation
wide nuclear draft resistance
and the new membership in
Congress. All of the country's
nuclear power plants were
shut down forever, and plans
to build new ones were can
celed. The young nuclear draft
resisters in jail and those who
went to Canada were all given
amnesty, returning home to
their towhs and families as
heroes.
And everyone lived happily
ever after.
