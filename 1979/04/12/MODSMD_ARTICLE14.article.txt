# Lecturer Patricia Ryan lives each day to the fullest

### Wendy Ikeguchi 
"I don't have any aspirations
toward fame, glory or perma
nence. I don't think about the
future. I think about the pre
sent. That, to me, is the real
work of life."
Living each day to the fullest
is basic to the life philosophy of
Patricia Ryan, a senior lecturer
in voice and acting, and she
applies it to almost every facet
of her life.
In the semi-darkened drama
classroom, students sit in
chairs and on pillows on the
floor and listen raptly to Ryan
talk about finding the "vocal
essence" of a scene. Her
tousled blonde locks are tied
up and away from her large
oval face in which round blue
eyes grin and wink at you.
She rises now, her ballet
style, lace-up clogs making her
even taller, and she does not
hesitate to gesture, grimace
and utter odd sounds to get her
point across. Her baggy blouse
and flowing avant-garde print
skirt allow for maximum flexi
bility.
She sits down in a chair lit by
overhead lamps, unaware that
she is bathed in a spotlight. Her
voice is mellifluous, confident
and clear, and bears only a hint
of her former Richmond, Va.
accent. In this simulated
limelight, Ryan seems every
inch the dedicated actress.
Vet, Ryan insists, she would
rather be a teacher than an ac
tress. She said she doesn't care
for the career of an actress be

cause it "is not acting, it's look
ing for jobs'." She would rather
"help people learn about
themselves."
One of her students, Los
Angeles Times theater critic
Dan Sullivan, agreed that "Pat
is a very, very fine teacher"
whose method takes acting
from the "inside out" to allow
the student to examine some
elements of his own personal
ity.
"I don't like to pin things
down," Ryan said, "because I
don't think teaching is this or
that, it's a lot of things. And I
don't believe there's a right
way to do something, any
thing."
Teaching was not Ryan's
original ambition in college.
She said she put herself
through the University of
Richmond as a philosophy and
Greek major by working 40
hours a week in a shoe store.
"I didn't want to do any
thing; I just wanted to expand
myself. I went to a university to
learn about myself. Me. I was
the curriculum. So I finished
my B.A. and I was absolutely fit
to do nothing."
When she was offered a job
teaching drama, Ryan went to
graduate school to learn the
craft only to find that
most of her own teaching in
stincts were correct. She then
went on to teach at four uni
versities, including Denison in
Ohio, and Pennsylvania State
University.

As for the drama depart
ment, Ryan "likes it small" be
cause it allows for "one-on
one attention, growth in its
humanity and improvement in
the quality of the work."
Although Ryan said she feels
her contribution to society is
"hardly profound," she said
she believes she functions to
"make the little connections.
"I've endeavored with my
life and my work to make con
tact with individuals, students
and audiences. I hope that at
different points along the way
different parts ot my sharings
with them have been helpful in
that moment to help them to
see something of themselves."
Ryan said she sees students
here as being overly competi
tive and interested in "finding
careers for themselves, sec
urity and money â€” those
things that are part of the con
servative American work ethic.

"The sad thing about the
competition here is that it
creates a kind of tension that is
debilitating and creates knots
that stop students from having
experiences, from learning by
doing things they want to do
and inhibiting them from real
education. If, indeed, it does
have some motivational be
nefits, then that is a sad com
ment about our society."
She suggests a better motiva
tional model would be one
"concerned about myself only,
my values and the work that I
do without making compari
sons."
However, Ryan said she does
teach some students who are
genuinely motivated every
week at St. Patrick's Seminary.
"The seminary faculty disco
vered that the young men who
were being called to the
priesthood might well have a
strong calling and an aptitude
for the work of the priesthood,

but they couldn't be counted
upon to speak the English lan
guage. I told the dean of the
seminary, 'Are you sure you
want me? We may do some
things that are not too dig
nified. We may be rolling on
the floor and being animals
and making all sorts of
sounds.' And he said, 'No,
that's exactly what we want.
Shake 'em up.' "
When she isn't teaching,
Ryan said she practices Tai Chi
Chuan, an ancient Chinese sys
tem of gentle movement and
breathing that balances the
body's mental and physical
energies "to live in the present
moment of an experience and
become aware of what's
around you, the birds, trees,
cars . . . and to accept what's
around you. "
Last year, one great crisis in
particular put her personal
philosophy to the test.
"I was attacked and raped by
a burglar in my own apartment
last fall. This has profoundly in
fluenced my life. To survive an
attack like that and come out of
it strong of body and limb has
given me a second chance and
made the moment-taking ex
perience, at face value, really
very important to me. Living in

the present becomes one of
the jobs I see for myself, mak
ing sure that I'm not just tread
ing water for some sort of fu
ture experience."
Ryan said she related the ex
perience to her students and
friends in an effort to de
monstrate that "one can
bounce back from this sort of
thing" and to help alleviate
other women's fears concern
ing the disclosure of a rape ex
perience.
"I'm the last person in the
world that it should happen to.
I'm capable, I take care of my
self, I had my doors locked . . .
so then the unthinkable hap
pens. I survived it rather well,
and it gave me a sense of my
own personal power and a
sense of dignity to know that
I've weathered through the
most horrible thing a woman
can imagine happening to her
and it's been okay ... I'm okay
now."
At the end of class she
bounces lightly down the
drama department stairs
whistling "No They Can't Take
That Away From Me." The tune
echoes off the bare walls and
its title seems fitting. No, they
can't take anything away from
Patricia Ryan.
