# New SAE jacuzzi installed â€”finally
## 
### Linda Hardesty Andrea lames 
Except for installing a sun
deck and finishing landscap
ing, the work is completed on
Sigma Alpha Epsilon's new
eight-foot jacuzzi. Holding 750
gallons of swirling, bubbling
water heated to a pleasant 106
degrees Fahrenheit, the
jacuzzi is being used almost
every day by SAE members.

News analysis

But some students are ques
tioning the decision to install
this water- and energy
consuming luxury item in
campus housing in view of the
continuing need for water and
energy conservation. Although
the fraternity is to bear all costs
relating to the installation, op
eration and maintenance of its
new facility, some still feel the
jacuzzi is inappropriate.
As one student put it,
"Could we each pay 10 cents
extra to get the old shower
heads back?"

The SAEs were not the first to
propose a jacuzzi in campus
housing. According to au
thorities in the housing office
and to members of other
fraternities, Delta Upsilon, Phi
Delta Theta, Kappa Alpha and
Theta Delta Chi had previously
discussed or taken preliminary
steps toward acquiring a
jacuzzi.
But, they added, they were
denied permission to install
the devices because jacuzzis
were considered to be luxury,
non-conserving ite/ns.
The SAE jacuzzi does not
necessarily indicate a change
in this philosophy.
This decision "does not es
tablish a policy for jacuzzis,"
said Dean of Students James
Lyons.
So why the exception for the
SAEs?
According to some, the final
approval may have been made
only to compensate for the
bureaucratic run-around given
to the fraternity members in
their quest for permission to

install the jacuzzi.
On Oct. 6, the SAEs met with
Robert Ramirez, manager of
the housing management of
fice. Ramirez said he told them
the series of steps they had to
follow before the jacuzzi idea
could be considered.
"They did everything they
were supposed to do, saw
everyone they were required
to see," Ramirez explained.
Following precedents for
similar projects, SAE president
Dan Wessner said he viewed
this as an approval for the
jacuzzi.
However, Ramirez argued,
"I had no absolute authority in
this project."
Meanwhile the SAE mem
bers raised more than $2700 by
working in warehouses, for
concerts and in the Stanford
Alumni Association to cover
the cost of installation, Wess
ner said. With the additional
$1300 from house savings, the
fraternity was able to cover the
cost.
"It was then a matter of pol

icy decision making,"
explained Ramirez. "First there
was the energy question and
then we had to decide if such a
device was appropriate for a
major university."
But on Nov. 9, Edward
Scoles, director of housing
management, and Norm
Robinson, director of residen
tial education, decided against
the jacuzzi installation for both
reasons, Ramirez said. The
Santa Clara County Health
Dept. had already approved
the project but the county
permit for the jacuzzi required
a University administrator's
signature, according to Wqss
ner.
"We hassled with housjng
management until Nov. 28,"
Wessner said. He added that
the ombudsman's office was
instrumental in convincing fhe
housing office to change its
stand.
"The point was that the SAEs
had received permission from
one person and then that per
mission was taken away by
someone else," explained
Ombudsman John Goheen.
"One can't proceed with con
tradictory orders."
Lyons agreed that the SAEs
"along the way weren't given
very clear answers. They were
justifiably upset at getting the
run-around." The SAEs got the
go-ahead from housing man
agement during finals week fall
quarter.
"We decided that if the SAEs
were to absorb total costs and
that if they met all codes and
regulations, they should be al
lowed to build the jacuzzi,"
Ramirez explained. "We also
decided that the jacuzzi was
not a negative image on Stan
ford and hence was an approp
riate project."
According to Ramirez, there
may still be hope for the Phi
Delts, Theta Delts and other
fraternities who are trying to
install their own jacuzzis now
that the SAEs have one.
"This now opens the doors
for other jacuzzi proposals,"
Ramirez said. "I don't see why
they can't have them, too, if
they conform to all codes,
meet all regulations and do
quality work. I simply don't see
how we can reject them."
But Robinson has another
opinion. When asked if more
jacuzzis will be approved in the
future, he replied, "I don't
think we will find ourselves in
that position in the future."

bers raised more than $2700 by
working in warehouses, for
concerts and in the Stanford
Alumni Association to cover
the cost of installation, Wess
ner said. With the additional
$1300 from house savings, the
fraternity was able to cover the
cost.
"It was then a matter of pol

icy decision making,"
explained Ramirez. "First there
was the energy question and
then we had to decide if such a
device was appropriate for a
major university."
But on Nov. 9, Edward
Scoles, director of housing
management, and Norm
Robinson, director of residen
tial education, decided against
the jacuzzi installation for both
reasons, Ramirez said. The
Santa Clara County Health
Dept. had already approved
the project but the county
permit for the jacuzzi required
a University administrator's
signature, according to Wqss
ner.
"We hassled with housjng
management until Nov. 28,"
Wessner said. He added that
the ombudsman's office was
instrumental in convincing fhe
housing office to change its
stand.
"The point was that the SAEs
had received permission from
one person and then that per
mission was taken away by
someone else," explained
Ombudsman John Goheen.
"One can't proceed with con
tradictory orders."
Lyons agreed that the SAEs
"along the way weren't given
very clear answers. They were
justifiably upset at getting the
run-around." The SAEs got the
go-ahead from housing man
agement during finals week fall
quarter.
"We decided that if the SAEs
were to absorb total costs and
that if they met all codes and
regulations, they should be al
lowed to build the jacuzzi,"
Ramirez explained. "We also
decided that the jacuzzi was
not a negative image on Stan
ford and hence was an approp
riate project."
According to Ramirez, there
may still be hope for the Phi
Delts, Theta Delts and other
fraternities who are trying to
install their own jacuzzis now
that the SAEs have one.
"This now opens the doors
for other jacuzzi proposals,"
Ramirez said. "I don't see why
they can't have them, too, if
they conform to all codes,
meet all regulations and do
quality work. I simply don't see
how we can reject them."
But Robinson has another
opinion. When asked if more
jacuzzis will be approved in the
future, he replied, "I don't
think we will find ourselves in
that position in the future."
Except for installing a sun
deck and finishing landscap
ing, the work is completed on
Sigma Alpha Epsilon's new
eight-foot jacuzzi. Holding 750
gallons of swirling, bubbling
water heated to a pleasant 106
degrees Fahrenheit, the
jacuzzi is being used almost
every day by SAE members.

News analysis

But some students are ques
tioning the decision to install
this water- and energy
consuming luxury item in
campus housing in view of the
continuing need for water and
energy conservation. Although
the fraternity is to bear all costs
relating to the installation, op
eration and maintenance of its
new facility, some still feel the
jacuzzi is inappropriate.
As one student put it,
"Could we each pay 10 cents
extra to get the old shower
heads back?"

The SAEs were not the first to
propose a jacuzzi in campus
housing. According to au
thorities in the housing office
and to members of other
fraternities, Delta Upsilon, Phi
Delta Theta, Kappa Alpha and
Theta Delta Chi had previously
discussed or taken preliminary
steps toward acquiring a
jacuzzi.
But, they added, they were
denied permission to install
the devices because jacuzzis
were considered to be luxury,
non-conserving ite/ns.
The SAE jacuzzi does not
necessarily indicate a change
in this philosophy.
This decision "does not es
tablish a policy for jacuzzis,"
said Dean of Students James
Lyons.
So why the exception for the
SAEs?
According to some, the final
approval may have been made
only to compensate for the
bureaucratic run-around given
to the fraternity members in
their quest for permission to

install the jacuzzi.
On Oct. 6, the SAEs met with
Robert Ramirez, manager of
the housing management of
fice. Ramirez said he told them
the series of steps they had to
follow before the jacuzzi idea
could be considered.
"They did everything they
were supposed to do, saw
everyone they were required
to see," Ramirez explained.
Following precedents for
similar projects, SAE president
Dan Wessner said he viewed
this as an approval for the
jacuzzi.
However, Ramirez argued,
"I had no absolute authority in
this project."
