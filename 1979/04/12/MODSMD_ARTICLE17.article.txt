## jimmy buffett/marvin gardens Burrito, brew and Jimmy Buffett cruisin' in Margaritaville 
### 
Twenty pages to type by4:oo
p.m. Tuesday and there I was at
the corner of Grove and
Allston Way wolfing down a
burrito and brew. )immy Buf
fett always has played hell with
my midwestern work ethic.
Anyway, KFAT and Bill Graham
were bringing )immy Buffett
back to the Berkeley Commun
ity Theater and come term
papers and/or finals I was going
to catch this concert.
I ask myself now if seeing the
concert was worth the C-plus
in history? Then I think did
Savonarola anticipate the gal
lows? Did Eleanor marry
Franklin for his money? Did the
Reds really fire Sparky? Some
how I get lost in my thoughts,
flash back to the concert, recall
the excitement, and conclude
that each one of the five units
of C-plus was worth it. The
concert was awesome. (See,
anyone can write an article for
the Daily.)
I went to the concert with a
group of scholastically apathe
tic students who didn't give
any more of a damn about typ
ing papers or completing prob
lem sets than I did. We were
primed for a pre-finals fling and
Buffett delivered. He played
two solid hours of Caribbean,
disco sucks rock and roll
music. Buffett opened the set
with the title song from his
latest LP of new releases, Son

of a Son of a Sailor. The energy
level of the drug mellowed
crowd was adroitly diverted
into laughterby Buffett'scomic
alteration of the lyrics to "Miss
Vou So Badly:"
We're stayin' in a Holiday Inn
full of coneheads I guess they
meet there once a year. They
consume mass quantities of
fiberglass and get drunk on
cheap-ass beer.
However, Buffett never
super-charged the audience
with a succession of intense
rock and roll. Instead Buffett
chose to crank up the two
thousand crazies with foot
stomping songs like
"Cheeseburger in Paradise,"
"Tampico Trauma" and "Land
fall" and then wind the crowd
down with softer tunes like
"Havana Daydreamin'," "A Pi
rate Looks at Forty" and
"Lovely Cruise."

The consideration of Buf
fer's song selection brings us
around to J.B.'s musical
philosophy. When asked how
he can write sensitive songs
like "Come Monday," "The
Captain and the Kid" and"He
Went to Paris" then switch
course and write bawdy songs
like "Why Don't We Get Drunk
and Screw," "Margaritaville"
and a new song called "Boat
Drinks," Buffett replies coyly
that there are times when he
feels very sensitive and that
there are other times when he
feels incredibly trashy. Well
that's how the concert went.
No esoteric lyrics here.
Buffett was in rare form. I
had never before heard his 32-
year-old voice so crisp and so
melodic. Characteristically
Buffett's voice comes across in
concert as if he is engaged in a
shouting match with a band of
rum-crazed musicians. But
somehow, somewhere bet
ween this concert and the
pressing of his live album, You
Had to be There, Buffett
learned to sing in concert.
Perhaps J.B. is being coached
by the newest Coral Reefer,
back-up singer Deborah
McCall. {Buffett and McCall are
justly labeled the Donny and
Marie of the drug culture.)
There can be no doubt about
McCall's splendid harmoniza
tion with Buffett. Unfortu

nately her talent wasn't high
lighted on You Had to be There
and I regret that absence now
after hearing her accompany
Buffett on Keith Sykes' "Coast
of Marseilles" and Tom Waits'
"Shiver me Timbers." Buffett
demonstrated that he has now
fully integrated a female voice
into his drunk, Caribbean rock
and roll sound.
Five years of drunches
(drunk lunches), Mount Gay
rum Pina Coladas, and recrea
tional abuse of marijuana have
taken their toll on the mem
bership of the Coral Reefer
Band. Bass player Harry Dailey
and harpoon man Fingers
Taylor are the only original
Coral Reefers surviving the
madness. Taylor never fails to
fill out the sound with blinding
speed and total command of
the harmonica. Taylor even
took the spotlight for a vocal
solo of "Big Rig" and did what
he does best by wailing away

during the encore of "Dixie
Diner." Around the veteran
Reefers is a very tight and
well-schooled group of south
ern musicians. The best of
which is Nashville's Barry
Chance on lead guitar. Chance
has taken Buffett's simply writ
ten songs into a higher level of
professionalism as witnessed
by Chance's riotous solo dur
ing "Landfall."
Closing the concert out Buf
fett wound the crazies down
with a few mellow tunes from
his older albums. But before it
was all over, Fingers Taylor
sparked the crowd for the drive
home with his shrill and hard
driving solo of "Dixie Diner."
So the concert was over. We
drank a few beers in a deserted
bar . . . recalled the night's
pleasures . . . forgot about the
deadlines . . . and passed into
the euphoric stupor of that
Margaritaville state of mind. It
was a lovely cruise.

Closing the concert out Buf
fett wound the crazies down
with a few mellow tunes from
his older albums. But before it
was all over, Fingers Taylor
sparked the crowd for the drive
home with his shrill and hard
driving solo of "Dixie Diner."
So the concert was over. We
drank a few beers in a deserted
bar . . . recalled the night's
pleasures . . . forgot about the
deadlines . . . and passed into
the euphoric stupor of that
Margaritaville state of mind. It
was a lovely cruise.

p.m. Tuesday and there I was at
the corner of Grove and
Allston Way wolfing down a
burrito and brew. )immy Buf
fett always has played hell with
my midwestern work ethic.
Anyway, KFAT and Bill Graham
were bringing )immy Buffett
back to the Berkeley Commun
ity Theater and come term
papers and/or finals I was going
to catch this concert.
I ask myself now if seeing the
concert was worth the C-plus
in history? Then I think did
Savonarola anticipate the gal
lows? Did Eleanor marry
Franklin for his money? Did the
Reds really fire Sparky? Some
how I get lost in my thoughts,
flash back to the concert, recall
the excitement, and conclude
that each one of the five units
of C-plus was worth it. The
concert was awesome. (See,
anyone can write an article for
the Daily.)
I went to the concert with a
group of scholastically apathe
tic students who didn't give
any more of a damn about typ
ing papers or completing prob
lem sets than I did. We were
primed for a pre-finals fling and
Buffett delivered. He played
two solid hours of Caribbean,
disco sucks rock and roll
music. Buffett opened the set
with the title song from his
latest LP of new releases, Son

of a Son of a Sailor. The energy
level of the drug mellowed
crowd was adroitly diverted
into laughterby Buffett'scomic
alteration of the lyrics to "Miss
Vou So Badly:"
We're stayin' in a Holiday Inn
full of coneheads I guess they
meet there once a year. They
consume mass quantities of
fiberglass and get drunk on
cheap-ass beer.
However, Buffett never
super-charged the audience
with a succession of intense
rock and roll. Instead Buffett
chose to crank up the two
thousand crazies with foot
stomping songs like
"Cheeseburger in Paradise,"
"Tampico Trauma" and "Land
fall" and then wind the crowd
down with softer tunes like
"Havana Daydreamin'," "A Pi
rate Looks at Forty" and
"Lovely Cruise."

The consideration of Buf
fer's song selection brings us
around to J.B.'s musical
philosophy. When asked how
he can write sensitive songs
like "Come Monday," "The
Captain and the Kid" and"He
Went to Paris" then switch
course and write bawdy songs
like "Why Don't We Get Drunk
and Screw," "Margaritaville"
and a new song called "Boat
Drinks," Buffett replies coyly
that there are times when he
feels very sensitive and that
there are other times when he
feels incredibly trashy. Well
that's how the concert went.
No esoteric lyrics here.
Buffett was in rare form. I
had never before heard his 32-
year-old voice so crisp and so
melodic. Characteristically
Buffett's voice comes across in
concert as if he is engaged in a
shouting match with a band of
rum-crazed musicians. But
somehow, somewhere bet
ween this concert and the
pressing of his live album, You
Had to be There, Buffett
learned to sing in concert.
Perhaps J.B. is being coached
by the newest Coral Reefer,
back-up singer Deborah
McCall. {Buffett and McCall are
justly labeled the Donny and
Marie of the drug culture.)
There can be no doubt about
McCall's splendid harmoniza
tion with Buffett. Unfortu

nately her talent wasn't high
lighted on You Had to be There
and I regret that absence now
after hearing her accompany
Buffett on Keith Sykes' "Coast
of Marseilles" and Tom Waits'
"Shiver me Timbers." Buffett
demonstrated that he has now
fully integrated a female voice
into his drunk, Caribbean rock
and roll sound.
Five years of drunches
(drunk lunches), Mount Gay
rum Pina Coladas, and recrea
tional abuse of marijuana have
taken their toll on the mem
bership of the Coral Reefer
Band. Bass player Harry Dailey
and harpoon man Fingers
Taylor are the only original
Coral Reefers surviving the
madness. Taylor never fails to
fill out the sound with blinding
speed and total command of
the harmonica. Taylor even
took the spotlight for a vocal
solo of "Big Rig" and did what
he does best by wailing away

during the encore of "Dixie
Diner." Around the veteran
Reefers is a very tight and
well-schooled group of south
ern musicians. The best of
which is Nashville's Barry
Chance on lead guitar. Chance
has taken Buffett's simply writ
ten songs into a higher level of
professionalism as witnessed
by Chance's riotous solo dur
ing "Landfall."
