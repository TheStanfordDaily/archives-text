## Lots of water— no boxing 
### 
The couple on my left kept
asking each other when the
boxing was going to begin. The
two women on my left tearfully
shared a package of tissues.
This was when The Champ had
been on the screen scarcely
half an hour.
Anyone who thinks that a
movie with a title like The
Champ has to be another
Rocky is advised to try another
theater. If you're not attached
to boxing but aren't suscepti
ble to soap opera, that other
theater still isn't such a bad
idea. Only if you're in the
mood for a lushly orches
trated, high-class weeper
should you consider laying
down your bucks and going in
to confront the screen.
Soggy
Taken on its own soggy level,
The Champ is a competently
put-together mass of slush.
Franco Zeffirelli, the man who
gave Romeo and luliet the
handkerchief treatment 10
years ago, directed. It's clear
from the beginning that he's
out for the same effect today.
The story is so carefully cont
rived to create this singular ef
fect that it might better be de
scribed as hard milled, like
soap. Those who get tired of
watching the characters sob
(there hasn't been this much
water in a movie since The
Poseidon Adventure) might get
some perverse pleasure out of
predicting what emotional
maelstrom the characters will
get caught in next. Zeffirelli's
approach to tragedy is such a
frighteningly logical one that
prediction becomes a matter of
listening for the music cues
and looking for any character
who seems too happy.
Money
The story seems simple
enough. An ex-boxer and his
8-year-old son are happy until
the boy's mother, now a weal
thy fashion designer who has
remarried money, comes back
on the scene. That's about all

there is to it: add a subplot
about horse racing and the in
evitable boxing finale (which
the screenwriters gleefully
turn totheirown melodramatic
ends), and you've nearly got it.
Put in some glycerine tears and
soft-focus photography and
you could write the script with
a typewriter tied behind your
back.
Faye Dunaway got it in the
eyes in her last venture, the
flyweight Eyes of Laura Mars. In
The Champ she doesn't need
to worry about ice picks but is
otherwise little more fortu
nate. Dunaway's not comfort
able in her part and her per
formance is an uncertain one.
Her hysterical scenes are al
most laughably overdone. Her
quiet scenes with the boy re
veal an uncertainty about how
her character should react to a
child she's ignored but now
finds herself attracted to. The
actress who gave Bonnie
Parker an inner fire in Bonnie
and Clyde can't ignite this wo
man's icy self-control.

Jon Voight is a little more
successful. His character
(which at times bears an un
comfortable resemblance to
the persona Voight adopted
for Midnight Cowboy) is better
defined than Dunaway's; he's
not all that bright but at least he
knows what he wants.
There is a rumor going
around that Ricky Schroder,
who plays the 8-year-old boy, is
in actuality a 40-year-old
midget who makes a living out
of blue-eyed cuteness. He's
certain to have a great future
ahead of him in Disney pot
boilers.
About the best thing that can
be said of The Champ is that its
makers have managed to con
ceal most of their cynicism
about the project. At times,
one could begin to believe that
they were serious about this
wholething. Butthen the score
— heavy on the violins, light on
quality — wafts across the
sound track, and one's faith in
the heartlessness of the big
budget tearjerker is restored.

This was when The Champ had
been on the screen scarcely
half an hour.
Anyone who thinks that a
movie with a title like The
Champ has to be another
Rocky is advised to try another
theater. If you're not attached
to boxing but aren't suscepti
ble to soap opera, that other
theater still isn't such a bad
idea. Only if you're in the
mood for a lushly orches
trated, high-class weeper
should you consider laying
down your bucks and going in
to confront the screen.
Soggy
Taken on its own soggy level,
The Champ is a competently
put-together mass of slush.
Franco Zeffirelli, the man who
gave Romeo and luliet the
handkerchief treatment 10
years ago, directed. It's clear
from the beginning that he's
out for the same effect today.
The story is so carefully cont
rived to create this singular ef
fect that it might better be de
scribed as hard milled, like
soap. Those who get tired of
watching the characters sob
(there hasn't been this much
water in a movie since The
Poseidon Adventure) might get
some perverse pleasure out of
predicting what emotional
maelstrom the characters will
get caught in next. Zeffirelli's
approach to tragedy is such a
frighteningly logical one that
prediction becomes a matter of
listening for the music cues
and looking for any character
who seems too happy.
Money
The story seems simple
enough. An ex-boxer and his
8-year-old son are happy until
the boy's mother, now a weal
thy fashion designer who has
remarried money, comes back
on the scene. That's about all

there is to it: add a subplot
about horse racing and the in
evitable boxing finale (which
the screenwriters gleefully
turn totheirown melodramatic
ends), and you've nearly got it.
Put in some glycerine tears and
soft-focus photography and
you could write the script with
a typewriter tied behind your
back.
Faye Dunaway got it in the
eyes in her last venture, the
flyweight Eyes of Laura Mars. In
The Champ she doesn't need
to worry about ice picks but is
otherwise little more fortu
nate. Dunaway's not comfort
able in her part and her per
formance is an uncertain one.
Her hysterical scenes are al
most laughably overdone. Her
quiet scenes with the boy re
veal an uncertainty about how
her character should react to a
child she's ignored but now
finds herself attracted to. The
actress who gave Bonnie
Parker an inner fire in Bonnie
and Clyde can't ignite this wo
man's icy self-control.

Jon Voight is a little more
successful. His character
(which at times bears an un
comfortable resemblance to
the persona Voight adopted
for Midnight Cowboy) is better
defined than Dunaway's; he's
not all that bright but at least he
knows what he wants.
There is a rumor going
around that Ricky Schroder,
who plays the 8-year-old boy, is
in actuality a 40-year-old
midget who makes a living out
of blue-eyed cuteness. He's
certain to have a great future
ahead of him in Disney pot
boilers.
About the best thing that can
be said of The Champ is that its
makers have managed to con
ceal most of their cynicism
about the project. At times,
one could begin to believe that
they were serious about this
wholething. Butthen the score
— heavy on the violins, light on
quality — wafts across the
sound track, and one's faith in
the heartlessness of the big
budget tearjerker is restored.
