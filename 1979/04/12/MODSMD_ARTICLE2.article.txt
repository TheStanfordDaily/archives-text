# Campus remodeling to aid disabled begins
## 
### Laurie Bennett 
The University is nowcompletinga
plan for modifications that will make
campus programs accessible to phys
ically limited students, staff and vis
itors, according to Assoc. Provost
Wayne Price.
The Accessibility Transition Plan
was developed over the past year by
the University Evaluation Working
Committee on Resources for the
Physically Limited, he said. The plan
has already been partially im
plemented.
The committee, chaired by Price,
includes disabled students and staff
as well as Medical School representa
tives and University planning offi
cials.
The University is required by Sec
tion 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
197.3 to produce a transition plan with
guidelines for making all University
programs accessible by |une 1980. All
institutions receiving federal funds
must comply with the Act.
Some campus remodeling has al
ready taken place, funded by an
$80,000 government grant. "We've
done a good number of site modifi
cations with assistance from the fed
eral government," said Steve
Schmidt of Facilities Planning.
Schmidt conducted a detailed survey
of the campus in 1977.
Curb cuts and ramps
The federal grant has been used to
construct curb cuts and ramps along
Santa Teresa and Escondido Roads as
well as access ramps around Stern
Hall and the Little Theater, Schmidt
said.
He said the second phase of access
remodeling, for which the University
will pay, will involve buildings that
already have renovation planned or
under way, such as the Margaret
lacks Hall and the history corner of
the Quad.
"One of the highest priority items
is the front of the Quad," Schmidt
said. Drawings are complete for a
ramp that will make Memorial
Church and other Quad buildings
accessible from the front to elderly
members of the Palo Altocommunity
as well as physically limited students
and staff.
Schmidt said he expects construc
tion of the ramp to begin within the
next two months. A freight elevator
in the Nathan Cummings Art Build
ing will be converted to a passenger

elevator by autumn quarter.
The Transition Plan considers the
needs of blind and deaf students as
well as persons who use wheelchairs
or crutches, according to Theresa-
Marie Rhyne, a member of the com
mittee. A Low Overhead Time Shar
ing (LOTS) computer terminal that
prints Braille has been installed at the
Center for Educational Research at
Stanford (CERAS), and public tele
phones with modifications for the
hearing-impaired have been made
available by Pacific Telephone.
University funds
The University has footed the bill
for much of the special renovation,
but Price said he is looking into other
sources of money. "There is a move
nationally to ask Congress for
funds," he said.
According to Rhyne, also research
assistant in Academic Planning, the
University's Transition Plan was not
produced solely in response to the
1973 Act. "The University really
wants to do this," she said. "It's not
like you're breaking people's arms to

get them to understand."
The immediate objective of the
Transition Plan is to make all prog
rams, although not necessarily all
buildings, available to physically li
mited students. Often this can be ac
complished by rescheduling a class
that would normally meet in an inac
cessible room, said Rhyne.
The ultimate goal of the plan is a
"readily accessible environment" in
which a physically limited person can
get into major buildings and use all
major services, she said.
Not every corner
Most of the plan was compiled by
Nicholas Zirpolo, a physically limited
graduate student. Zirpolo said the
plan does not totally reconstruct the
campus. "It's not like every corner of
a building has to be accessible," he
said.
Although an early estimate pro
jected a cost of $11,000,000 to make
all University facilities conform to
American National Standards Insti
tute guidelines, the Transition Plan
suggests that costs will be approxi
mately $600,000. Price said the Work

ing Committee will meet to decide
which areas requiring modification
should have highest priority.
The committee is composed of
"students, faculty and staff who basi
cally care about the issue," said
Price.
"Something I'd really like to celeb
rate is the involvement in this project
of members of the Stanford com
munity, especially students, who
happen to have physical limitations,"
he said. "They have contributed
enormously to the quality and feasi
bility of our plan."
A brochure entitled "Things to
Know and the Places to Go: A Guide
for the Physically Limited at Stan
ford'' has been produced through
the efforts of Zirpolo, Robert
McCann of the University News and
Publications Service and physically
limited undergraduate Peter Axel
son.
Several copies are available in
Braille at the Dean of Student Affairs
Office along with a map of accessibil
ity features on campus, also pro
duced by McCann.

tion 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
197.3 to produce a transition plan with
guidelines for making all University
programs accessible by |une 1980. All
institutions receiving federal funds
must comply with the Act.
Some campus remodeling has al
ready taken place, funded by an
$80,000 government grant. "We've
done a good number of site modifi
cations with assistance from the fed
eral government," said Steve
Schmidt of Facilities Planning.
Schmidt conducted a detailed survey
of the campus in 1977.
Curb cuts and ramps
The federal grant has been used to
construct curb cuts and ramps along
Santa Teresa and Escondido Roads as
well as access ramps around Stern
Hall and the Little Theater, Schmidt
said.
He said the second phase of access
remodeling, for which the University
will pay, will involve buildings that
already have renovation planned or
under way, such as the Margaret
lacks Hall and the history corner of
the Quad.
"One of the highest priority items
is the front of the Quad," Schmidt
said. Drawings are complete for a
ramp that will make Memorial
Church and other Quad buildings
accessible from the front to elderly
members of the Palo Altocommunity
as well as physically limited students
and staff.
Schmidt said he expects construc
tion of the ramp to begin within the
next two months. A freight elevator
in the Nathan Cummings Art Build
ing will be converted to a passenger

elevator by autumn quarter.
The Transition Plan considers the
needs of blind and deaf students as
well as persons who use wheelchairs
or crutches, according to Theresa-
Marie Rhyne, a member of the com
mittee. A Low Overhead Time Shar
ing (LOTS) computer terminal that
prints Braille has been installed at the
Center for Educational Research at
Stanford (CERAS), and public tele
phones with modifications for the
hearing-impaired have been made
available by Pacific Telephone.
University funds
The University has footed the bill
for much of the special renovation,
but Price said he is looking into other
sources of money. "There is a move
nationally to ask Congress for
funds," he said.
According to Rhyne, also research
assistant in Academic Planning, the
University's Transition Plan was not
produced solely in response to the
1973 Act. "The University really
wants to do this," she said. "It's not
like you're breaking people's arms to

get them to understand."
The immediate objective of the
Transition Plan is to make all prog
rams, although not necessarily all
buildings, available to physically li
mited students. Often this can be ac
complished by rescheduling a class
that would normally meet in an inac
cessible room, said Rhyne.
The ultimate goal of the plan is a
"readily accessible environment" in
which a physically limited person can
get into major buildings and use all
major services, she said.
Not every corner
Most of the plan was compiled by
Nicholas Zirpolo, a physically limited
graduate student. Zirpolo said the
plan does not totally reconstruct the
campus. "It's not like every corner of
a building has to be accessible," he
said.
Although an early estimate pro
jected a cost of $11,000,000 to make
all University facilities conform to
American National Standards Insti
tute guidelines, the Transition Plan
suggests that costs will be approxi
mately $600,000. Price said the Work

ing Committee will meet to decide
which areas requiring modification
should have highest priority.
The committee is composed of
"students, faculty and staff who basi
cally care about the issue," said
Price.
"Something I'd really like to celeb
rate is the involvement in this project
of members of the Stanford com
munity, especially students, who
happen to have physical limitations,"
he said. "They have contributed
enormously to the quality and feasi
bility of our plan."
A brochure entitled "Things to
Know and the Places to Go: A Guide
for the Physically Limited at Stan
ford'' has been produced through
the efforts of Zirpolo, Robert
McCann of the University News and
Publications Service and physically
limited undergraduate Peter Axel
son.
Several copies are available in
Braille at the Dean of Student Affairs
Office along with a map of accessibil
ity features on campus, also pro
duced by McCann.
