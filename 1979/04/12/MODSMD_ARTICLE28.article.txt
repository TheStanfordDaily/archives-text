Uganda announces new gov't.
Kampala, Uganda — Tanzanian troops and
Ugandan rebels, showered with flowers by de
lirious civilians, entered Idi Amin's capital in
triumph yesterday after a five-month war to
drive the dreaded dictator from power.
The victors promised to return "the good
life" to this bloodstained land and said they
expect the United States to play a major role in
helping them do it.
U.S. officials in Washington said they would
recognize the new government and took steps
in Congress to restore U.S. aid to Uganda.
Jubilant residents of Kampala greeted their
"liberators" in the streets, cheering wildly and
swarming over the Tanzanian tanks, offering
the soldiers flowers and bananas. There were
also reports that shops were looted and that
stragglers from Amin's army were beaten to
death by groups of long-repressed citizens.
The Tanzanian-sponsored Ugandan Na
tional I iberation Front quickly announced es
tablishment of a provisional government with
former Ugandan university official Vussufu
l.ule as president, defense minister and armed
forces chief.
Lule, 67, in a broadcast statement Irom Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, promised a "rule of law"
and said Uganda's first elections since 1962
would be held "as soon as conditions permit."
Iran execution toll mounts
Tehran, Iran — Firing squads shot 11 gener
als, diplomats and politicians yesterday — the
highest execution toll in the capital in one
night.
The latest executions in Tehran pushed to at
least 101 the number of men put to death since
the revolutionary forces of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini took over two months ago.

More trials were reported in progress yes
terday, including those of three police officers
suspected of torture.
Charges against the 11 executed men ranged
from treason and corruption to "acts against
the people." Nearly half of them were shot for
white-collar crimes or sanctioning murder,
rather than the direct murder and torture
charges that have dominated past court hear
in K s - .
The new Iranian government has defended
the trials and executions, saying the numbers
put to death by the revolutionary courts are
minimal compared to those executed under
the shah.
NRC calls for new safeguards
Washington — The Three Mile Island acci
dent has revealed the need for new safety
measures that could affect nearly half of the
atomic power plants in the country, the Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission staff said yester
day.
The commission staff declared that the acci
dent requires consideration of additional
safety measures "on a priority basis," and the
agency expects to issue a new directive today.
In a preliminary notification to the commis
sion, the NRC staff said further "actions"
should be considered "for all light water
power reactor facilities." All but one of the
nation's 72 licensed nuclear plants — Fort Saint
Vrain at Plattville, Colo. — are light water
facilities.
Darrell Eisenhut, deputy director of the
NRC's Division of Operating Reactors, said the
mainproblem involves pressurized water reac
tors like the Three Mile Island unit. Eisenhut
said boiling water reactors — a second type —
also will be reviewed, but on a less urgent
basis.

Officials claim the NRC is not considering
shutting down any nuclear plants.
Soviet space rendezvous fails
Moscow — The first Bulgarian spaceman and
his Soviet commander failed today in an at
tempt to link up with the orbiting Salyut 6
space station and prepared to return to Earth,
the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
"In the process of approach there arose de
viations from the regular mode of operation of
the approach-correction power unit of the
Soyuz 33 spaceship and the linkup with the
Salyut 6 station was cancelled," Tass reported
in a 100-word disoatch.
Bulgarian Georgi Ivanov, 38, and Nikolai
Rukavishnikov, 46, of the U.S.S.R., on his third
space flight, had switched off their engines
during their fourth and fifth orbits of the earth,
Tass reported earlier.
This put the spacecraft on course after what
Tass called the shakiest blastoff in Soviet his-
Rancho Seco close would cost
Sacramento — A shutdown of Rancho Seco
would require imports of power from South
ern California in order to avoid brownouts this
summer, a state energy official reported yes
terday.
Gary Simon, chief of the California Energy
Commission assessments division, also said
that shutting down the nuclear power plant
would raise power bills anywhere from IVi
percent to 80 percent.
Simon gave his report at a briefing of the
state Energy Commission on the Three Mile
Island accident.
At the same briefing, a state engineer re

commended running Rancho Seco at 70 per
cent of capacity to increase safety.
Environmental and anti-nuclear groups have
called for a shutdown of Rancho Seco because
it is a near-twin to the Three Mile Island plant
near Harrisburg, Pa., the site of the nation's
worst nuclear accident March 28, and because
a similar but less serious accident was reported
at the Sacramento plant more than a year ago.
In his report to the commission, Simon set
the gross cost of shutting down Rancho Seco
for six months at $108 million, based on a 95
percent operating capacity. The net cost, less
the avoided cost of nuclear fuel, would be $86
million with a net average monthly cost of
$14.5 million. He said nearly 4 million barrels of
oil would be needed to replace the power.
