# Lyman opposes separate Department of Education

University President Richard
Lyman urged the U.S. House of Rep
resentative's Committee on Cov
ernment Operations to reject a Con
gressional bill calling for the estab
lishment of a Department of Educa
tion in a statement delivered before
its Subcommittee on Legislation and
National Security in Washington,
D.C. last Thursday.
Lyman told subcommittee mem
bers that "a Department of Educa
tion, if it were to succeed in achiev
ing its sponsors' hopes . . . would be
far more damaging to the true
sources of our strength and vitality
(in education) than would our pre
sent arrangements."
According to Lyman, American
higher education, "the envy of the
world," derives its strength from
"the intellectual vitality that is gener
ated by diversity and dispersed re
sponsibility." Lyman said yesterday
that "we (Americans) would find the
centralized authority (of a Depart
ment of Education) undesirable."
Separate department
According to Robert Freelan, as
sociate vice president for public af
fairs, the proposed bill would "take
the F' out of. HEW (Department of
Health, Education and Welfare) by
creating a separate Department of
Education."
Freelan said the bill would "take
any programs dealing with elemen
tary, secondary and post-secondary
education and put them in a separate
department under a cabinet secret
ary."
Introduced on the floor of the
House in August last year, the bill is

currently being debated in the Se
nate, according to Michelle Farrar,
press secretary for Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Calif.), a member of
the Government Operations Com
mittee.
After numerous subcommittee
hearings and statements from educa
tion authorities, the bill will now
come up for vote in the full Govern
ment Operations Committee. The
bill is expected to reach the full
Flouse sometime next month.
Cost will be $14 billion
According to Farrar, the first-year
cost of establishing the new cabinet
level position and department would
be approximately $14 billion. The
new department would employ
16,000 persons and control more
than 150 educational programs cur
rently administered by a variety of
organizations and offices, including
the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and HEW.
In its current form the bill would
put all NSF programs under the di
rection of the new Education De
partment except those programs de
aling directly with university re
search.
Lyman said the Carter administra
tion's strong support of the bill stems
from the president's campaign prom
ise to the National Educational As
sociation (NEA).
Lyman said yesterday that "a good
many institutions are opposing the
bill, individually." He said, "Over the
long haul, it (a Department of Educa
tion) would have considerably bad
effects on the University. We benefit
from having a large variety of sources
of support."
Lyman also urged rejection of the

measure on the grounds that a sepa
rate Department of Education is un
necessary. He told subcommittee
members that while education "is
not effectively or even sensibly or
ganized within HEW," this could be
corrected by creating "an assistant
secretaryship which is the undis
puted educational leadership post
within the department."
Reorganization
Lyman added that "such a reor
ganization would be applauded by
every educator in the country, and
has been recommended re
peatedly."
Lewis Mayhew, chairman of the
Administration and Policy Analysis
Committee of the School of Educa
tion here, also opposes the bill. He
explained that a Department of Edu
cation "will be harmful to higher
education because it will be chiefly
concerned with elementary and sec
ondary education."
Competition
Mayhew said that he was "not at all
dissatisfied with the (present) com
petition between varying educa
tional elements."
McCloskey opposes the estab
lishment of a Department of Educa
tion because he "thinks education
should be left to local levels," noted
Farrar. She added that McCloskey
"does not think any of these educa
tional programs deserve cabinet
status."
Both Lyman and Mayhew expres
sed doubts that the bill will pass in
Congress. Lyman said, "There is a
reasonable chance of stopping it in
the House." Mayhew said, "My in
stincts tell me it won't pass, but it's
hard to say."
