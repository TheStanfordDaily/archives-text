# Lyman serves education groups
## 
### Kurt Cobb Second of two parts 
University President Richard
Lyman is worried about the gap bet
ween the cost of going to a private
university and that of attending a
public one. This is one reason he be
came involved with the National As
sociation of Independent Colleges
and Universities (NAICU) which es

sentially acts as a lobby in
Washington, D.C., for its 775 mem
bers.
Lyman has also been active in a
group that works to protect the in
terests of 50 research universities,
including Stanford, called the As
sociation of American Universities
(AAU). Lyman has been on the
executive committee of the organiza
tion since 1971 and became chairman
of that committee this year.
Lyman was a member of the found
ing board of directors of the NAICU
in 1976, but has since stepped down.
|im Sullivan, vice president of
NAICU, explained that while most
other organizations had a national
association, private independent col
leges and universities did not.
Government relations
In 1976 the decision was finally
made to form the NAICU and while
there are several other groups in
Washington representing private
higher education, the NAICU con
centrates on government relations.
Lyman said that the most impor
tant problem for NAICU members is
the "tuition gap" between private
and public universities. "We, the in
dependent sector, have to rely on tui
tion for unrestricted income, while
public sector institutions receive
large subsidies from the state, plus
the kind of support we get from the
federal government.
"It means it costs relatively more
each succeeding year to come to an
independent sector institution than
it does to attend a public sector in
stitution," he explained.
The NAICU was active in support
ing the Middle Income Assistance
Program. The program will make it
easier to go to more expensive pri
vate universities because it opens up
more opportunities to middle
income families for aid, according to
Sullivan.
Charitable giving
Sullivan said the NAICU is also try
ing "to protect charitable giving" to
higTier education. Currently, per
sons who use the Internal Revenue
Service's (IRS) short form for income
tax (something promoted by the IRS)
receive no tax break for charitable
giving, he said.
The NAICU wants the IRS to in
clude a place for deductions on the
short form. This will make donors
who use the form more willing to
give to universities because they will
be able to declare their gifts.
Lyman noted that for the first time
the independent sector of education
has an organized advocate to lobby
for such changes.
The NAICU is supported by mem
bership dues and has a budget close
to $500,000 this year. A parallel cor

poration called the National Institute
of Independent Colleges and Uni
versities is the research arm of the
NAICU.
The AAU is primarily concerned
with science research and graduate
education, according to executive
assistant to AAU president, Barbara
Turlington. The president or chan
cellor of each university represents
his member university in twice yearly
meetings.
Turlington explained that the AAU
deals with Congress and various
government agencies and keeps the
membership informed about gov
ernment action in the funding of re
search. The AAU, also funded by
membership dues, has a budget of
$600,000 this year.
Federal regulations
One of the AAU's current con
cerns is new federal regulations per
taining to reimbursement of indirect
research costs. The regulations orig
inally would have cost this and other
universities millions of dollars. But
pressure from the AAU and other
groups has forced the government to
reconsider its stand.
Lyman now heads the nine
member executive committee of the
AAU which meets four times a year
and is consulted frequently by tele
phone in conference calls, Tur
lington said.
In addition to his ties with these
organizations and with The Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching, The Rockefeller Founda
tion and the National Council on the
Humanities, Lyman recently became
a member of the board of directors of
International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM). The board meets every
month except August.
Lyman, who has been a director
only since December, said he ac
cepted the position because IBM has
developed technology "that's in
fluencing our lives in matters of edu
cation at all levels" and will continue
to do so.
"One can imagine that before the
computer has run its course, educa
tion is going to look very different,"
he said.
Lyman said he feels that this posi
tion, like the others, has some rele
vance to his primary occupation be
cause large organizations often share
common problems.
Lyman's involvement with these
organizations is not unlike that of
other university presidents. Current
speculation, however, is that Ly
man's broad experience with these
other organizations may lead to of
fers, perhaps from the foundation
world, that will result in his depar
ture from the presidency here.
