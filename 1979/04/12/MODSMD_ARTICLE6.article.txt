# Becker resigns position
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
Brian Becker, director of ASSU Special
Events, resigned Monday over what he
termed "a professional disagreement."
Becker felt Special Events should work
more with big promoters such as Bill
Graham.
Becker said, "I "felt that co-promoting
would allow us to make more money which
would assure the future of Special Events and
allow the initiation of new projects. I feel the
advantages of bigger shows and more profits
outweighed the arguments for indepen
dence and autonomy."
Becker's policy is opposed by ASSU Finan
cial Manager Bill Lape, John Harris, the new
director and next year's Financial Manager
Bruce Bendix.
Harris, Lape and Bendix were opposed to
working with outside promoters, Harris said,
because they are concerned with maintain
ing Special Events as an independent promo
ter.
Harris explained, "We'd love to work with
the big promoters if the circumstances are
right. We don't have anything against Bill
Graham."
Independence
Bendix said, "It hasn't been shown that we
have to rely on outside promoters; we want
to maintain the independence of ASSU Spe
cial Events."
Harris added that working with bigger
promoters would entail losing some control
over the production and allow the promoters
to employ persons other than students in
security and set-up. Harris said he felt one of

the purposes of Special Events is to provide
students with experience in the entertain
ment field; co-promotion would sacrifice
some opportunities for students.
While Becker agreed with Harris on the
basic purposes of Special Events, Becker said
he felt that it was important to work with
outside promoters in order to bring big
names to the University and earn more
money for the ASSU.
"Coming off a $27,000 deficit from last
year, I was forced to be very cautious and
very aware of the money aspects of concerts
because the future of Special Events was at
stake," Becker said.
He added that when he took the position,
he was told by Lape that if Special Events did
not at least break even this year, it might be
eliminated.
'In the black'
Asked about the financial status of Special
Events, Becker said, "I believe we will be in
the black this year."
Harris praised Becker for the job he did this
year, pointing to his initiation of The Station
jazz series. Becker resigned because "he felt
his policies weren't being implemented,"
Harris said.
"We were not getting anywhere," Becker
said, "and next year the policy will be the
same one that I oppose, so I decided to res
ign. I would have had to negotiate from
points of view that I do not hold, and I
couldn't do it."
Both Harris and Becker emphasized that
there was nothing personal in the dispute.
Lape could not be reached for comment.
