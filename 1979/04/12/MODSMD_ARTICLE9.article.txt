# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Fee assessments evaluated 
### 
We make the following recommenda
tions in regard to the 17 fee assessments
that will appear on the ASSU election
ballot on Wednesday and Thursday of
next week. We urge all students to vote
as at least 20 percent of the ASSU has to
vote to certify the election and approve
the fee assessments. All fee assessments
are refundable.
Stanford Band — Yes
The Band, as in past years, is asking for
a two-quarter, $1 fee assessment to fi
nance a preseason halftime appearance
in the fall and a short string of appear
ances at away basketball games next
winter. The money is to go almost en
tirely to transportation costs, as the Band
customarily is accommodated in gym
nasiums and the like on its road trips.
We encourage students to approve
the assessment to enable the Band to
continue its support of University athle
tic programs and its mystification of
sports announcers everywhere.
Glee Club — Yes
Every other year, the Glee Club goes
on tour. In the past, they have been
heavily dependent on local alumni to
provide food, accommodations and a
sizeable portion of their expenses. Ris
ing costs — particularly transportation —
have caused the Glee Club to ask for a
one-quarter, $1 fee assessment that
would enable them to tour next year.
Despite the valuable public relations
function performed by the Glee Club,
no University funding has been forth
coming. Only the passage of a fee as
sessment will provide the funds neces
sary to send the 60-member glee club
and 20-piece orchestra on the road. We
recommend a "yes" vote on this assess
ment, and further urge the University to
consider partially funding the Club's
touring, in light of the service it renders
alumni and students.
Club Sports — Yes
Formerly, Club Sports has not re
quested a fee assessment because of
fears that the Athletic Dept. would cut
off its stipend as a result. This year, how
ever, Club Sports received funding re
quests of $70,000 of which it had funds to
grant less than half. It has now received
assurance that its stipend will not be
jeopardized, and is therefore requesting
a three-quarter, $1 fee assessment. We
encourage students to approve this fee
assessment that will enable even more
people to participate and keep viable
athletic prograns — including those
dropped from varsity status by the Athle
tic Dept. — that have little other financial
recourse.
ASSU Guest Professorship Board —
Yes
The ASSU Guest Professorship Board,
which is entirely dependent on student
funding through its fee assessment,
gives students the power to bring the
faculty they want to the University,
teachers that are more responsive and
accessible as a result. The Board has al
ready begun to explore possibilities for
next year, and is pledged toward a grea
ter diversity of scientists and humanists
as opposed to the predominance of
political activists of the past. We there
fore recommend passage of the one
quarter, $1 fee assessment for the Board.
Program Fee — Yes
This year the Program Fee received
funding requests totaling $74,000 from
58 different student groups — for many
the only available source of funds — but
was actually able to provide less than
one third of desired funds. Among the
groups dependent on the Program Fee

for funding are many of the minority
student groups on campus. In view of
the essential services the program fee
provides to so many, we hope students
will support the two-quarter, $1 fee as
sessment.
ASSU Speakers Bureau — Yes
Big-name speakers with a broad ap
peal are becoming ever more expensive,
and the Speakers Bureau is feeling the
pinch. Exacerbating the problem is the
fact that the Bureau has turned into a
clearinghouse for other groups who
want to arrange for speakers, having re
ceived $8000 in funding proposals this
year. Like the Guest Professorship
Board, the Speakers Bureau has pledged
itself to a greater diversity of speakers in
the future, placing more emphasis on
series than on individual speakers. We
feel the Bureau's request for a two
quarter, $1 fee assessment deserves stu
dent support.
ASSU Recycling Center — Yes
In October 1977 students approved
what they thought would be a "one-time
only" fee assessment for the recycling
center, based on estimates that the
center would become self-sufficient in a
year. The estimates have proved to be
overly optimistic, and the recycling
center is again requesting a two-quarter,
$1 fee assessment. It is now estimated
that the center will reach the break-even
point in another two years.
Despite this setback, we hope stu
dents will support the center's request
for a fee assessment. The center cur
rently recycles over 32 tons of paper,
glass and aluminum a month, serving
both students and the University at
large. Monies from the fee assessment
would go towards the purchase of a new
truck, and a bailer that would enable the
center to sell its materials for higher
rates than it currently receives.
Academic Organizations Board —
Yes
Like the Publications Board and the
Program Fee, the AOB provides funding
for a wide variety of programs — in this
case student departmental and pre
professional societies — that' have no
other sources of funding. We recommend
the approval of its one-quarter, $1 fee as
sessment.
Legal Counseling Office — Yes
The LCO provides legal advice to stu
dents on problems ranging from traffic
violations to landlord-tenant controver
sies. Its services can save students from
unnecessary hassle and expense for a
very modest cost to students.
Since the fee assessment is the only
possible form of funding for this service,
and because the service is so useful, we
encourage students to approve the $1
assessment for autumn, winter and
summer quarters.
Publications Board — Yes
The only way to ensure alternative
viewpoints continue to be expressed in
the press on campus is to vote "yes" on
the Pub Board $1 Winter Quarter as
sessment proposal. Some 19 publica
tions on campus, which are ethnically or
politically oriented, received significant
support from the Pub Board, which
works hard to secure funds from several
sources other than fee assessment.
Without this support, most of these pub
lications would perish, leaving the cam
pus to read only those views expressed
in the more established, mainstream
student and administration press. Alter
native publications have a valuable place
in this community, and the Pub Board
fee assessment deserves your support.
