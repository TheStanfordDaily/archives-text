# 'National Service' proposals blasted in White Plaza rally
## 
### Nancy Koehn Joel Dickholtz 
Daniel Ellsberg told a White Plaza
crowd of more than 500 yesterday
that "signing up for the draft is like
signing up for the Kool-Aid at
Guyana."
Speaking at a noon anti-draft rally,
Ellsberg, an ASSU Guest Professor
here, compared the draft to the
"white knight rehearsals (in Guyana)
in which people prepared them
selves to die." He urged students to
"say no when selective service calls."
The rally, the first in the nation to
protest any return to conscription,
was sponsored by the Students
Against Conscription (SAC), a coali
tion of political, religious and anti
draft groups organized in March to
protest eight congressional bills cal
ling for reinstitution of the draft.
Immediately after the rally, ap
proximately 175 students marched
down El Camino Avenue to the Grant
Avenue district office of Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), co
sponsor of selective service legisla
tion.
Speaking at the rally for SAC was
sophomore Lisa Hogeland, who said,
"It is imperative that we all work to
fight this thing (the draft) now."
Hogeland asserted that "this is an
emergency situation. The bill is
scheduled to go on to the (congres
sional) floors by late May."
'Do your fighting now'
Stanford library staffer Lise Giraud
also spoke against the draft, telling
students that "men and women
should fight together in any just
struggle." She added that Americans
are likely to be fighting "on the side
of repression" in any future war.
Giraud urged an enthusiastic
crowd to "do your fighting now, in
order not to be enslaved later."
The SAC rally included a short
speech by Palo Alto High School
junior Bruce Nordman, who told the
crowd, "At least you all got into col

lege. We may be drafted before we
get in." Nordman added, "High
school students don't want the draft.
We feel the same as Stanford stu
dents."
Ellsberg, the final speaker at the
rally, arrived late after testifying at
the Dept. of Energy hearings on the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, an
atomic research facility under the au
spices of the University of California.
McCloskey criticized
Ellsberg, known for his release of
the Pentagon Papers, criticized
McCloskey's support of the National
Service Act, saying that "he
(McCloskey) has a lousy idea in this
bill."
Praising students for their role in
the Vietnam War protests, Ellsberg
said that these protests "kept (then-
President Richard Nixon) from carry
ing out explicit nuclear threats"
against North Vietnam. After the rally
Ellsberg told reporters, "The cam
puses deserve enormous credit for
ending the (Vietnam) war."
Now, Ellsberg added, with the
knowledge that student demonstra
tions can affect governmental deci
sions, "we can focus ourattention on
an anti-war effort before the draft."
Ellsberg told reporters he didn't
think McCloskey's National Service
Act would pass, saying he believed
that "the people of this country will
stop it."
Crucial role here
Ellsberg, who attracted attention
as early as 1959 with a series of lec
tures on coercion at the Lowell Insti
tute in Boston, called the university
"a crucial place, a hotbed of West
Coast resistance that played a crucial
role in preventing nuclear war (dur
ing the Vietnam war), in ending the
war and in ending the draft."
According to Ellsberg, the United
States is "going into an era when the
people in the Pentagon are envision
ing more intervention, not less," in
foreign countries. As a result, he

said, casualty rates will be different
as "more manpower, not less" will
be required to replace entire combat
units.
SAC collected over 1000 signatures
on petitions protesting any return to
conscription, and it surveyed 850
students about their opinions on the
draft. According to the survey, 78
percent said they opposed registra
tion and 70 percent reported that
they would refuse to register at all or
seek conscientious objector status.
Traffic blocked off
As the protesters marched to
McCloskey's office chanting slo
gans like "Hell no, we won't go" and
"One, two, three four, we don't want
another war," traffic was blocked off
by the Palo Alto Police Dept. and car
drivers honked approval of the
march. Their numbers grew as they
approached McCloskey's office and
were joined by kids and adults on the
streets of Palo Alto.
"I think this is great," commented
Mike Grace, who joined the march as
it passed him. "Hell, I don't want to
go to war. We have no reason to
fight. I didn't even know about the
march."
McCloskey didn't receive the peti
tions personally, as he is in Geneva
for a "law of the seas conference."
Helen Pickering, field representative
for McCloskey, greeted the protes
ters for him.
Vocal crowd
"The congressman wants a na
tional debate on the rssue," Picker
ing said, accepting the petitions. "I
hope you all know specifically what
he's proposing," she added.
One protester yelled in response,
"Pete should know exactly what
we're proposing. We want no more
war and no more draft."
Matt Haber, a junior here, acted as
spokesperson for the marchers.
"Give these petitions to Pete and tell
him we're not willing to fight another
unjust war," Haber said. "We don't
care about his civilian service op
tions. We will not debate what kind
of involuntary servitude we prefer."
Several of the marchers had been
active during the anti-war protests of
the late '60s and early '70s. Eric Es
chleman, who resisted the draft
then, burned his old draft card be
fore the crowd yesterday.
"This is more covert," he said. "I
think the public is being prepared by
the media for wars that are essen
tially imperialistic," he added.
Mixed reactions
The workers in McCloskey's office
had mixed reactions about the
march, as well as the bill itself.
John Struthers, an ASSU senator
and intern for McCloskey, said that
the bill is "probably the best of the
draft bills before Congress, but I
don't think there's any need for a
peacetime draft. I don't fully agree
with him on this subject," he said.
Jane McKean, a student at Com
mon College in Woodside, sup
ported McCloskey's bill. "I marched
against the draft in the Vietnam
War," she said, "but now I'm disap
pointed with my peers. I think this
bill is really a good thing. This is a
totally different situation than the
Vietnam War," she said.
