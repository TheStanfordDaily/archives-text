## Editorial COP: Vote Freeman slate 
### 
This Wednesday and Thursday stu
dents will have only two slates to choose
from for next year's Council of Presi
dents. In the past there have been three
or four. Despite the dearth of candi
dates, we feel the slate of Sibby
I reeman, Laura Mead, Mary Leßlancand
l orn Cart is a slate that students can vote
for with confidence.
fhe Freeman slate offers students a
wide-ranging platform based on exten
sive experience. All four candidates have
served on a variety of University commit
tees, while Cart is currently serving as an
ASSU senator. Not only do they have a
working knowledge of how the Univer
ily is run and how decisions are made,
I'm it it is clear that their enthusiasm is
tampered with a lucid perception of the
pt v. tical limitations of the COP's pow
i sand which election promises can be
fulfilled.
fhe slate's platform reflects this pei
(• ption. There are few proposals for en
li<ely new programs or radical reforms.
Instead the slate is realistically concen
trating its efforts on improving ana/or
t p.'tiling existing programs, based not
on an adveisary relationship with the
University but on efforts to foster in
reased communication and under
■ nding between students and the ad
ministration.
I lie I reeman slate's program also fea
tures .1 de-emphasis of the pe'ipheial
national political issues that have often
dominated the proceedings of the se
nati over the past year. While emphasiz
ing they are not opposed in principle to
-• aling with political issues, they will ask

the senate to spend its regularly
scheduled meetings on more student
oriented issues.
Such an approach to student politics
here does not make for flashy rhetoric
and a dramatic campaign, but we feel it is
the most effective means of promoting
student interests.
The other COP slate of Liat
Applewhite, John Pomfret, Bambi Mar
kel and Nathan Sarkisian has neither the
experience nor the pragmatic attitudes
of the Freeman slate. Their campaign lit
erature, which paints a picture of a un
ited student body dealing effectively
with such issues as faculty selection and
tenure decisions and the creation of a
Department of Womans Studies, shows
an admirable level of enthusiasm but lit
tle grasp of the realities of student gov
ernment here.
None of the four candidates on the
Applewhite slate has had any experience
on either University committees or in
student government. Their declaration
that "the administrative decision
making process is a mystery to us all"
does not inspire confidence in their
leadership abilities.
Nor is there any mention by the
Applewhite slate of the concerns of
graduate students, who comprise about
half the entire student body — certainly
a glaring omission. In contrast, the
Freeman slate is headed by Freeman, a
graduate student himself, and devotes
much of its platform to graduate issues.
Vote Freeman — Mead — Leßlanc —
Cart.
