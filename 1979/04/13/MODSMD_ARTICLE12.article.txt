In my opinion the word has

' i each of these instances

massive means something
quite distin< t and yet the same
word is used.
The primary meaning of
"massive" is "having great
mass or bulk." The array of
secondary meanings do not
work well either in the situa
tions above. If you find your
self confused by what a writer
means by "massive," join my
large and great war against it.
lournalism is partly the art of
summing up and thus, of
necessity, it is sometimes gen
eral in its language. But
buzzwords such as massive are
downright vague and ambigu
ous. Buzzwords and jargon are
the lazy man's tools in writing
and speaking.
We all get lazy sometimes,
but I am beginning to think that
most journalists string ham
mocks next to their typewriters
so they can put out the
minimum effort when writing.
Poor research by a reporter be
comes evident no matter how
well a piece is written. But un

fortunately, I have seen poor
writing obscure many good re
search jobs.
Here are a few more speci
mens to help you start your
own war.
I could swear that liberals
and conservatives are all
Boy Scouts because they are
always in camps. I am
perplexed by the fact that stu
dent activists almost never do
calisthenics.
Most governments have
funds or resources rather than
money. I have surmised how
ever, that these funds or re
sources are actually raised by
deducting from our paychecks
what we call money.
In the world of big business
and high finance plans are fre
quently finalized. Well, this ar
ticle has not yet and never will
be finalized. It has simply been
completed.

massive means something
quite distin< t and yet the same
word is used.
The primary meaning of
"massive" is "having great
mass or bulk." The array of
secondary meanings do not
work well either in the situa

self confused by what a writer
means by "massive," join my
large and great war against it.
lournalism is partly the art of
summing up and thus, of
necessity, it is sometimes gen

buzzwords such as massive are
downright vague and ambigu

the lazy man's tools in writing
and speaking.
We all get lazy sometimes,
but I am beginning to think that
most journalists string ham
mocks next to their typewriters
so they can put out the
minimum effort when writing.
Poor research by a reporter be
comes evident no matter how
well a piece is written. But un

fortunately, I have seen poor
writing obscure many good re
search jobs.
Here are a few more speci

own war.
I could swear that liberals
and conservatives are all
Boy Scouts because they are
always in camps. I am
perplexed by the fact that stu
dent activists almost never do
calisthenics.
Most governments have
funds or resources rather than
money. I have surmised how
ever, that these funds or re
sources are actually raised by
deducting from our paychecks
what we call money.
In the world of big business
and high finance plans are fre
quently finalized. Well, this ar
ticle has not yet and never will
be finalized. It has simply been
completed.
