New Directions
Stanford New Directions re
grets that the Daily is opposed
to increasing the level of in
terest and understanding of in
ternational issues on campus
by approving the New Direc
tions fee assessment. It is clear
the editorial staff feels that a
two-paragraph treatment of in
ternational issues is sufficient
for an educated citizenry. We
disagree. And we would like to
make our publications availa
ble free of charge.
Our newsletters, New Direc
tions and New Directions Up
date have established a profes
sional track record during their
two years of publication. The
newsletters probe beyond the
level of a headline story, focus
sing on such issues as arms
control, the Third World,
scarce energy and the dollar, in
order to help make these ex
tremely complex topics com
prehensible. This service is not
available elsewhere, and cer
tainly not elsewhere on cam
pus. These publications are
written for all students and not
just for international relations
majors.
Not enough'students have
been willing to pay the $3 an
nual fee to make our publica
tions financially viable. But the
$1 refundable fee assessment
will enable us to put New Di
rections in your mailbox next
year. And that dollar will pay
for numerous symposia on in
ternational affairs as well.
The Daily claims that New
Directions is not cost-effective.
But one must ask, "cost
effective compared to what?"
Other students publications
come out only infrequently
and thus may have no problem
finding the people to put in the
amazing number of hours re
quired for each edition. But
this year we publish three
times each quarter (on the av
erage of every three weeks).
Moreover, the amount of time

the newsletter is at press must
be minimized in order to pre
serve its newsworthiness.
No organization with busy
students as its members can
muster the kind of person
power the Daily expects us to.
Are we cost-effective com
pared to the more frequently
published Daily? The Daily
editorial (April 4) does not give
us any information about the
Daily's spending thrift. Yet it is
public (i.e. the Daily staff) in
formation that the paper is
considering the expenditure of
$100,000 on a computer system
so that its reporters can learn to
type on a computer terminal
instead of a normal typewriter.
Thus, we are sure the Daily
would agree that good quality
costs a little money. We hope
that students will elect to
spend $1 for a quality publica
tion such as New Directions,
and support our efforts to in
crease discussion of world af
fairs here.

Kosher Kitchen
Stanford Hillel is not asking
for a fee assessment. An out
side organization is not asking
for a fee assessment. A group
of Stanford students is asking
for a fee assessment for a
Community Kosher Kitchen for
the Clubhouse. While it is true
that Hillel supports the
kitchen, other groups such as
United Campus Christian
Ministry, Volunteers in Asia
and Stanford American Indian
Organization also support this
fee assessment for the
Clubhouse Kosher Kitchen.
The Kitchen will not serve
merely one group of kosher
eating students; all students
will benefit from a kitchen in
the Clubhouse.
A community kitchen in the
center of campus has been

needed for quite some time —
groups of students often want
to serve a meal for 50 people or
more. The Clubhouse Com
munity Kosher Kitchen will fill
this need. The University has
allocated some space in the
Clubhouse for Hillel for three
years. Hillel is offering to build
a kitchen in this space provid
ing it is a kosher kitchen for this
period. During this period,any
student group can use the
kitchen provided they follow
the rules set by the group of
students who are organizing
the kitchen. Afer two more
years, the University may real
locate the facility to another
student group.
The Community Kosher
Kitchen is being b'j'lt by Stan
ford students, a r id will be used
by all Stanford students *and
every Stanfo.d student's sup
port is needed to create it.

Stanford Kosher Coop.)
PIRG
Stanford Public Interest
Group (PIRG) feels that it is im
portant that students receive
correct and unbiased informa
tion concerning PIRG. Accu
rate information becomes
even more significant when
students realize that their deci
sion to fund PI RG will probably
be the most important this year.
The Daily editorial (April 4)
mentioned that, so far, Stan
ford PIRG has not de
monstrated a membership and
that PIRG lacks student sup
port. The fact is that over 400
people expressed interest in
Ralph Nader at Kresge au
ditorium in autumn quarter, 70
to 100 students have expressed
interest in establishing PIRG on
campus, the PIRG mailing list
consists of over 100 members,
the ASSU Senate after discus
sing the issue for one hour put
PIRG on the ballot for a fee as

sessment by a vote of 12 to 2
and the PIRG petition drive ob
tained 900 signatures, with one
week before the deadline.
Student support for PIRG is
evident.
The Daily's editorial also
trivialized the significance of
the PIRG staff persons. Staff
persons hired by students are
usually lawyers, ex-professors
or researchers; they are
trained organizers. Their pur
pose is to direct students in a
professional manner to pro
vide effective solutions. Pro
fessional staff persons provide
continuity and expertise,
something sorely needed
here.
Stanford PIRG, contrary to
the Daily's report, has taken on
two modest projects without
the help of student funds. A
food options research inves
tigating all food-serving ser
vices was started. The Coors
boycott issue was researched.
A PIRG member was assigned
to the ASSU task force that
went to Colorado. Modest pro
jects? Yes, but impressive. As
far as the state organization is
concerned Stanford PIRG w'i\\
send "at most" five percent of
the fee assessment to the state
PIRG. The Daily incorrectly
stated that "at least" five per
cent would be sent.
Important problems face
students at the University and
in the immediate community.
PIRG, with the help of stu
dents, can provide a vehiclefor
alleviating these problems. It
has the potential to become a
student-conscience resource
center. No organization on
campus can accomplish these
goals now. It is time that Stan
ford students recognize this. It
is time that the Daily recognize
this. Let us accomplish these
goals together. Show your
support: vote yes on PIRG.

PIRG
Stanford Public Interest
Group (PIRG) feels that it is im

correct and unbiased informa

rate information becomes
even more significant when
students realize that their deci
sion to fund PI RG will probably
be the most important this year.
The Daily editorial (April 4)
mentioned that, so far, Stan
ford PIRG has not de
monstrated a membership and
that PIRG lacks student sup
port. The fact is that over 400
people expressed interest in
Ralph Nader at Kresge au
ditorium in autumn quarter, 70
to 100 students have expressed
interest in establishing PIRG on
campus, the PIRG mailing list
consists of over 100 members,
the ASSU Senate after discus
sing the issue for one hour put
PIRG on the ballot for a fee as

sessment by a vote of 12 to 2
and the PIRG petition drive ob
tained 900 signatures, with one
week before the deadline.
Student support for PIRG is
evident.
The Daily's editorial also
trivialized the significance of
the PIRG staff persons. Staff
persons hired by students are
usually lawyers, ex-professors
or researchers; they are
trained organizers. Their pur
pose is to direct students in a
professional manner to pro
vide effective solutions. Pro
fessional staff persons provide
continuity and expertise,
something sorely needed
here.
Stanford PIRG, contrary to
the Daily's report, has taken on
two modest projects without
the help of student funds. A
food options research inves
tigating all food-serving ser
vices was started. The Coors
boycott issue was researched.
A PIRG member was assigned
to the ASSU task force that
went to Colorado. Modest pro
jects? Yes, but impressive. As
far as the state organization is
concerned Stanford PIRG w'i\\
send "at most" five percent of
the fee assessment to the state
PIRG. The Daily incorrectly
stated that "at least" five per
cent would be sent.
Important problems face
students at the University and
in the immediate community.
PIRG, with the help of stu
dents, can provide a vehiclefor
alleviating these problems. It
has the potential to become a
student-conscience resource
center. No organization on
campus can accomplish these
goals now. It is time that Stan
ford students recognize this. It
is time that the Daily recognize
this. Let us accomplish these
goals together. Show your
support: vote yes on PIRG.

New Directions
Stanford New Directions re
grets that the Daily is opposed
to increasing the level of in
terest and understanding of in
ternational issues on campus
by approving the New Direc
tions fee assessment. It is clear
the editorial staff feels that a
two-paragraph treatment of in
ternational issues is sufficient
for an educated citizenry. We
disagree. And we would like to
make our publications availa
ble free of charge.
Our newsletters, New Direc
tions and New Directions Up
date have established a profes
sional track record during their
two years of publication. The
newsletters probe beyond the
level of a headline story, focus
sing on such issues as arms
control, the Third World,
scarce energy and the dollar, in
order to help make these ex
tremely complex topics com
prehensible. This service is not
available elsewhere, and cer
tainly not elsewhere on cam
pus. These publications are
written for all students and not
just for international relations
majors.
Not enough'students have
been willing to pay the $3 an
nual fee to make our publica
tions financially viable. But the
$1 refundable fee assessment
will enable us to put New Di
rections in your mailbox next
year. And that dollar will pay
for numerous symposia on in
ternational affairs as well.
The Daily claims that New
Directions is not cost-effective.
But one must ask, "cost
effective compared to what?"
Other students publications
come out only infrequently
and thus may have no problem
finding the people to put in the
amazing number of hours re
quired for each edition. But
this year we publish three
times each quarter (on the av
erage of every three weeks).
Moreover, the amount of time

the newsletter is at press must
be minimized in order to pre
serve its newsworthiness.
No organization with busy
students as its members can
muster the kind of person
power the Daily expects us to.
Are we cost-effective com
pared to the more frequently
published Daily? The Daily
editorial (April 4) does not give
us any information about the
Daily's spending thrift. Yet it is
public (i.e. the Daily staff) in
formation that the paper is
considering the expenditure of
$100,000 on a computer system
so that its reporters can learn to
type on a computer terminal
instead of a normal typewriter.
Thus, we are sure the Daily
would agree that good quality
costs a little money. We hope
that students will elect to
spend $1 for a quality publica
tion such as New Directions,
and support our efforts to in
crease discussion of world af
fairs here.
