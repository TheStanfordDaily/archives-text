Covering rape
As co-owner with my wife of
a small weekly newspaper in
Colorado, I was most in
terested in your March 2 "Vie
wpoint" column, "How the
Daily covers rape."
I understand the logic be
hind your policy of not reveal
ing the name of the victi m. Lots
of papers — ours included —
follow that policy.
But your column doesn't say
how the Daily handles the
name of the suspect, after he
has been arrested. Do you
print it? Or do you grant him
the same anonymity you give
the woman?
And what do you do when
the case moves to trial in an
open courtroom — where
anyone can walk in off the
street, sit down and listen to
the testimony? Do you print
the man's name — even
though he may not have been
convicted yet? Do you print the
woman's name when she tes
tifies against him?Ordon'tyou
identify one or the other — or
both?
Unless I misread the tone of
your column, it would seem
that the Daily presumes that
the suspect is guilty and there
fore would have no qualms
about printing his name once
he has been arrested. "We are
not out 'to get' anyone — ex
cept the alleged rapist," you
write.
My questions here are not
merely rhetorical. My wife and
I have spent hours debating
this problem, as you and your
staff appear to have, too. And
we honestly would like to
know how you would handle

rape stories when they move
into the judicial arena.
Our experience in this area
has been pretty limited — and
dismal. In the six years we have
been publishing our news
paper, we have had only one
rape case that moved to the
trial stage (ours is a small, rural
county). And we botched the
story, I feel now.
Before the trial, we dutifully
carried a brief advance story,
outlining the circumstances in
the case as reported by the
police, printing the man's
nameand address forall to see,
and protecting the victim by
not publishing her name, nor
even her age or the town she
lived in.
Then, at the conclusion of
the trial the "alleged rapist"
was acquitted of all wrongdo
ing. The jury didn't buy the
woman's story. And there we
were with eggon our journalis
tic face, having smeared the
man's reputation in the public
print at the same time we pro
tected the reputation of the
"victim" whose accusations
turned out to be of little merit
(in the jury's opinion).
I'm sorry to report that, in
our confusion and ineptitude,
we dropped the story like an
angry porcupine and never did
report the outcome of the trial,
fearing we would only make a
messy ethical problem worse.
We neither cleared the man's
reputation nor identified the
woman who had brought
"false" testimony against him.
I'm curious. What would the
Daily have done? Printed a full
report? A partial report? Or
none at all?

Which would serve the
community best?

Editor's note: Obviously the
situation you present is a dif
ficult one, and our exact handl
ing of such a situation would
have to be determined on a
case-by-case basis much the
same way we would have to
decide on what information
about the victirr) should be
published.
Having said that, I should
point out that we would not
tend to assume a suspect's
guilt. I hope the viewpoint did
not imply that we are pre
judiced in favor of the victim.
We hold no prejudice either
way.
If someone were arrested
and charged with an assault
which occurred on campus, I
would tend to report the fact
and not the name of the indi
vidual arrested. This would be
in keeping with the Daily's al
most phobic paranoia about
libel suits.
Moreover, in the one situa
tion I can remember in which
police actually held a suspect
in a sex-related crime, the Daily
merely reported the fact. No
name was ever released. This
later proved to be the correct
decision because the person
was released and was never
charged.
After a case comes to trial, a
different situation would hold,
I believe. Certainly at trial, the
case itself is the news, not the
fact that an assault occurred.
Reporting that an assault occur
red r erves an educational pur
pose. Our purpose is to inform,
not to subject a victim to

ridicule.
But in fairness, if we did de
cide to report on a trial and we
did identify the defendant,
then identification of the ac
cuser would only be approp
riate. I would certainly follow a
case through to its completion
and report fairly and accurately
the verdict of a jury whether it
tended to put "egg on our
face" or not.
The Daily recognizes that we
are student journalists subject
to judgment and procedural er
rors; therefore, we have a pol
icy of correcting the record
whenever we make a mistake.
This is seen in our liberal cor
rection policy which results in
our inclusion of a number of
corrections on points I con
sider trivial or peripheral to a
story.
Your point is well taken,
however, and if such a situa
tion ever arose, it would be a
very difficult one to deal with.

Combat alienation
The recent Daily article (April
6) accurately expressed my
concern for the alienation all
too many students (and staff
and faculty) are currently ex
periencing here.
It was heartening to discover
as a consequence of a session
of my Human Connection
course (Psych 161) last quarter,
that indeed many representa
tives of the administration are
aware of the extent of such
problems and are trying to de
velop strategies for alleviating
them.
In this regard, Dave Dorosin
and the rest of the staff at the

Cowell Student Health Center
are particularly sensitive to the
needs of the individuals who
are feeling lonely, depressed
and without meaningful at
tachments. But unlike the
characterization in the Daily ar
ticle, Cowell is indeed attend
ing to the situational and sys
temic sources of these
psychological states that are

revealed in the unhappiness of
individuals.
It may be however, that the
best way to start to stomp out
alienation is for you (the read
ers) to care more about other
people in our Stanford com
munity — and to show them
that you care.

Combat alienation
The recent Daily article (April
6) accurately expressed my
concern for the alienation all
too many students (and staff
and faculty) are currently ex
periencing here.
It was heartening to discover
as a consequence of a session
of my Human Connection
course (Psych 161) last quarter,
that indeed many representa
tives of the administration are
aware of the extent of such
problems and are trying to de
velop strategies for alleviating
them.
In this regard, Dave Dorosin
and the rest of the staff at the

Cowell Student Health Center
are particularly sensitive to the
needs of the individuals who
are feeling lonely, depressed
and without meaningful at
tachments. But unlike the
characterization in the Daily ar
ticle, Cowell is indeed attend
ing to the situational and sys
temic sources of these
psychological states that are

revealed in the unhappiness of
individuals.
It may be however, that the
best way to start to stomp out
alienation is for you (the read
ers) to care more about other
people in our Stanford com
munity — and to show them
that you care.

Covering rape
As co-owner with my wife of
a small weekly newspaper in
Colorado, I was most in
terested in your March 2 "Vie
wpoint" column, "How the
Daily covers rape."
I understand the logic be
hind your policy of not reveal
ing the name of the victi m. Lots
of papers — ours included —
follow that policy.
But your column doesn't say
how the Daily handles the
name of the suspect, after he
has been arrested. Do you
print it? Or do you grant him
the same anonymity you give
the woman?
And what do you do when
the case moves to trial in an
open courtroom — where
anyone can walk in off the
street, sit down and listen to
the testimony? Do you print
the man's name — even
though he may not have been
convicted yet? Do you print the
woman's name when she tes
tifies against him?Ordon'tyou
identify one or the other — or
both?
Unless I misread the tone of
your column, it would seem
that the Daily presumes that
the suspect is guilty and there
fore would have no qualms
about printing his name once
he has been arrested. "We are
not out 'to get' anyone — ex
cept the alleged rapist," you
write.
My questions here are not
merely rhetorical. My wife and
I have spent hours debating
this problem, as you and your
staff appear to have, too. And
we honestly would like to
know how you would handle

rape stories when they move
into the judicial arena.
Our experience in this area
has been pretty limited — and
dismal. In the six years we have
been publishing our news
paper, we have had only one
rape case that moved to the
trial stage (ours is a small, rural
county). And we botched the
story, I feel now.
Before the trial, we dutifully
carried a brief advance story,
outlining the circumstances in
the case as reported by the
police, printing the man's
nameand address forall to see,
and protecting the victim by
not publishing her name, nor
even her age or the town she
lived in.
Then, at the conclusion of
the trial the "alleged rapist"
was acquitted of all wrongdo
ing. The jury didn't buy the
woman's story. And there we
were with eggon our journalis
tic face, having smeared the
man's reputation in the public
print at the same time we pro
tected the reputation of the
"victim" whose accusations
turned out to be of little merit
(in the jury's opinion).
I'm sorry to report that, in
our confusion and ineptitude,
we dropped the story like an
angry porcupine and never did
report the outcome of the trial,
fearing we would only make a
messy ethical problem worse.
We neither cleared the man's
reputation nor identified the
woman who had brought
"false" testimony against him.
I'm curious. What would the
Daily have done? Printed a full
report? A partial report? Or
none at all?

Which would serve the
community best?

Editor's note: Obviously the
situation you present is a dif
ficult one, and our exact handl
ing of such a situation would
have to be determined on a
case-by-case basis much the
same way we would have to
decide on what information
about the victirr) should be
published.
Having said that, I should
point out that we would not
tend to assume a suspect's
guilt. I hope the viewpoint did
not imply that we are pre
judiced in favor of the victim.
We hold no prejudice either
way.
If someone were arrested
and charged with an assault
which occurred on campus, I
would tend to report the fact
and not the name of the indi
vidual arrested. This would be
in keeping with the Daily's al
most phobic paranoia about
libel suits.
Moreover, in the one situa
tion I can remember in which
police actually held a suspect
in a sex-related crime, the Daily
merely reported the fact. No
name was ever released. This
later proved to be the correct
decision because the person
was released and was never
charged.
After a case comes to trial, a
different situation would hold,
I believe. Certainly at trial, the
case itself is the news, not the
fact that an assault occurred.
Reporting that an assault occur
red r erves an educational pur
pose. Our purpose is to inform,
not to subject a victim to

ridicule.
But in fairness, if we did de
cide to report on a trial and we
did identify the defendant,
then identification of the ac
cuser would only be approp
riate. I would certainly follow a
case through to its completion
and report fairly and accurately
the verdict of a jury whether it
tended to put "egg on our
face" or not.
