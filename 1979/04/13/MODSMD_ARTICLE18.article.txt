It's well known that lots of
people in waiting rooms across
the country somehow manage
to skip The New Yorker's 72-
page articles on recombinant
DNA and read just the car
toons. At least when they're
not flipping through the cute
children's Bible storybooks
provided by all the good doc
tors. So. You people with cof
fee tables who have languished
in waiting rooms should buy
The New Yorker Album of
Drawings: 1925-1975 and save
yourselves a trip.


"Do / really all this
power? I think I do."



"Ml right, have it your way —you
heard a sea/ hark!"


"/•rom the cyclotron of Jierheley to the labs of M.1.1'.,
II e're the Lhls that yon can trust to keep our country strong an,l free."


"The air I breathe is filthy, my fooil is poisotiej, my automobile is a gas-guzzling behemoth,
my school taxes have doubled, the Internal Revenue Service plans to take the fillings out of my
teeth, my wife is fifty-three and pregnant, my dog bit a lawyer's hid, my son steals, my mother
in-law is a Communist, my daughter ran off with a fink, and now you tell me that if I don't
back up and let you have the right-of-way I'll be in trouble."
