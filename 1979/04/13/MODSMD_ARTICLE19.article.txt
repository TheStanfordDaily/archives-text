An American in Paris * * * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Perhaps the greatest of the big
musicals, this MGM masterpiece
has some mighty impressive
names on its title credits. Arthur
Freed, head of the studio's
legendary musical department,
produced. The score is the best
of George and Ira Gershwin, with
a representative of everything
from the jazzy "I'll Build a Stair
way to Paradise" to the rumbling
"Concerto in F." Vincent Minelli
directed, his eye for spectacle in
top form. Gene Kelly never
danced or sang better than here;
his dancing partner is Leslie
Caron in her first film. The plot,
as the title suggests, deals with
"an American in Paris." This film
is one of the most visually stun
ning and entertaining of all Hol
lywood movies.
—Jim Mattson

Midnight Express BM
Aquarius, Palo Alto^'
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop-out imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. The movie self
righteously bills itself as retelling
a true story; if this is so then why
did the screenwriters choose to
fabricate violent episodes — a
man having his tongue bitten off
in looming close-up, a Turkish
guard (there are no good Turks in
this movie) being impaled on a
coat hook — which never hap
pened to the real Mr. Hayes? If
you should hear Midnight Ex
press' whistle a'blowing, take the
bus instead.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
* * #
Friday, Kresge
The 1956 version of fraternity
arid sorority rush. Director
Donald Siegel doesn't give us any
window dressing in this feisty,
funny, campy suspense movie.
The pods from outer space are
out to get everyone here; be
sides being great for allegory,
this premise pretty well closes
the necessity for subplots. As the
pursued doctor, Kevin McCarthy
wears what seems to be perma
nent look of despair on his face.
The material was remade with
much more care and balance by
Philip Kaufman last year, but this
original still is great fun. Watch
out for the pods, kiddies!
—Ron Lillejord
Julia * * * *
New Varsity
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftmanship dominates
this movie about friendship and
its responsibilities. Jane Fonda
and Vanessa Redgrave star in this
true story based on a chapter of
Lillian Hellman's autobiographi
cal book Pentimento. Both are
brilliant; Fonda effectively cap
tures Hellman's spirited person
ality, and Redgrave delivers a
fine, understated performance as
the idealistic Julia.
—R.L.
The Deer Hunter ★★★ Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made—
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen

The Day the Earth Stood Still
Friday, Kresge * ★ ★
Even with the past decade's re
naissance of the science fiction
movie, this tightly constructed
film from the '50s holds its posi
tion as one of the best of the
genre. A man from another
planet brings a chance for peace
on Earth; he is met with only mis
understanding and fear. It can be
viewed as a condemnation of
McCarthyism or as a movie fulfil
ling the desire to create modern
myth. Whatever one reads into
the film, it remains consistently
entertaining. Julian Blaustein,
now a faculty member of the
Stanford communication de
partment, produced.
—J.M.
Isadora *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Supremely silly biopic about
Isadora Duncan. Vanessa Red
grave plays the great modern
dancer as if her main motivation
in life was being weird; the result
is about as serious as a Looney
Tune cartoon. I'd love to be able
to see the list of the film's prop
erty master where he must have
been required to find "one scarf,
long enough to be caught in the
wheel of a speeding roadster."
James Fox and |ason Robards are
also along for the ride. Karel
Reisz directed.
—J.M.
Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Harold and Maude * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals
and committing suicide. Maude
is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodrtess of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, recently nominated for an
Oscar for Coming Home, di
rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Gordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack.
—J.M.
Cigi * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The last gasp of the MCM mus
ical. It's entertaining enough, but
most of the studio's creative fire
is gone and we're left with a
movie that's colorful on the out
side but rather cold at its center.
Leslie Caron, though a charming
actress, has trouble maintaining
her role as Colette's scarcely
pubescent French girl. Louis Jor
dan, recent star of FTD Florists
commercials, is a very distant
mentor to the nymphet. Even
Maurice Chevalier seems to
spend more of his time mugging
at the camera than usual. Some
nice tunes and a couple of funny
scenes manage to bail out quite a
bit of the movie. Vincent Minelli
directed; Arthur Freed pro
duced.
—J.M.
The Champ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of Jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.
—J.M.
Foul Play ★ *
Sunday, Mem Aud
This movie entertains you, all
right; but it's entertainment by
the numbers. Colin Higgins
wrote and directed this piece of
cloned Hitchcock; he relies on
his stars and his big, dumb music
to get by. Thank Cod one of his
stars is Coldie Hawn. She gets a
chance to strut here, and in this
movie she's a gem lying amohgst
the ordinary. Featuring the
California coastline, San Fran
cisco and, oh yes, Chevy Chase.
—R.L.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.
—R.L.
Norma Rae * * # *
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.
The China Syndrome * # * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
■ —R.L.

The Buddy Holly Story * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.
—J.N.
Cet Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQoflsB.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.
Buck Rouen in the 25th Century
Guild, Menlo Park
This movie is so bad that it
makes Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians look like Of/zen Kane. It
features yecchv acting, wretched
dialogue, putrid sets, and abys
mal double-entendres. Buck Ro
gers was made for TV and then
distributed fortheatrical use after
the producers found out how
much money Battlestar Calactica
was making in its Canadian theat
rical run. This explains the film's
rating: "M" for mindless.

Though they're set over two decades apart, both Hair (above) and

Michael Ronnie and Patricia Neal are chaparoned by the robot
Gort in The Day the Earth Stood Still. The 1951 movie plays

tion as one of the best of the
genre. A man from another
planet brings a chance for peace
on Earth; he is met with only mis
understanding and fear. It can be
viewed as a condemnation of
McCarthyism or as a movie fulfil
ling the desire to create modern
myth. Whatever one reads into
the film, it remains consistently
entertaining. Julian Blaustein,
now a faculty member of the
Stanford communication de
partment, produced.

Isadora *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Supremely silly biopic about
Isadora Duncan. Vanessa Red
grave plays the great modern
dancer as if her main motivation
in life was being weird; the result
is about as serious as a Looney
Tune cartoon. I'd love to be able
to see the list of the film's prop
erty master where he must have
been required to find "one scarf,
long enough to be caught in the
wheel of a speeding roadster."
James Fox and |ason Robards are
also along for the ride. Karel
Reisz directed.
—J.M.
Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Harold and Maude * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals
and committing suicide. Maude
is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodrtess of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, recently nominated for an
Oscar for Coming Home, di
rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Gordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack.

Cigi * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The last gasp of the MCM mus
ical. It's entertaining enough, but
most of the studio's creative fire
is gone and we're left with a
movie that's colorful on the out
side but rather cold at its center.
Leslie Caron, though a charming
actress, has trouble maintaining
her role as Colette's scarcely
pubescent French girl. Louis Jor
dan, recent star of FTD Florists
commercials, is a very distant
mentor to the nymphet. Even
Maurice Chevalier seems to
spend more of his time mugging
at the camera than usual. Some
nice tunes and a couple of funny
scenes manage to bail out quite a
bit of the movie. Vincent Minelli
directed; Arthur Freed pro
duced.

The Champ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of Jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.
—J.M.
Foul Play ★ *
Sunday, Mem Aud
This movie entertains you, all
right; but it's entertainment by
the numbers. Colin Higgins
wrote and directed this piece of
cloned Hitchcock; he relies on
his stars and his big, dumb music
to get by. Thank Cod one of his
stars is Coldie Hawn. She gets a
chance to strut here, and in this
movie she's a gem lying amohgst
the ordinary. Featuring the
California coastline, San Fran
cisco and, oh yes, Chevy Chase.
—R.L.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.
—R.L.
Norma Rae * * # *
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.
The China Syndrome * # * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
■ —R.L.

The Buddy Holly Story * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.
—J.N.
Cet Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQoflsB.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.

Buck Rouen in the 25th Century
Guild, Menlo Park
This movie is so bad that it

mal double-entendres. Buck Ro
gers was made for TV and then
distributed fortheatrical use after
the producers found out how
much money Battlestar Calactica
was making in its Canadian theat
rical run. This explains the film's
rating: "M" for mindless.

An American in Paris * * * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Perhaps the greatest of the big
musicals, this MGM masterpiece
has some mighty impressive
names on its title credits. Arthur
Freed, head of the studio's
legendary musical department,
produced. The score is the best
of George and Ira Gershwin, with
a representative of everything
from the jazzy "I'll Build a Stair
way to Paradise" to the rumbling
"Concerto in F." Vincent Minelli
directed, his eye for spectacle in
top form. Gene Kelly never
danced or sang better than here;
his dancing partner is Leslie
Caron in her first film. The plot,
as the title suggests, deals with
"an American in Paris." This film
is one of the most visually stun
ning and entertaining of all Hol
lywood movies.

Midnight Express BM
Aquarius, Palo Alto^'
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop-out imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. The movie self
righteously bills itself as retelling
a true story; if this is so then why
did the screenwriters choose to
fabricate violent episodes — a
man having his tongue bitten off
in looming close-up, a Turkish
guard (there are no good Turks in
this movie) being impaled on a
coat hook — which never hap
pened to the real Mr. Hayes? If
you should hear Midnight Ex
press' whistle a'blowing, take the

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
* * #
Friday, Kresge
The 1956 version of fraternity
arid sorority rush. Director
Donald Siegel doesn't give us any
window dressing in this feisty,
funny, campy suspense movie.
The pods from outer space are
out to get everyone here; be
sides being great for allegory,
this premise pretty well closes
the necessity for subplots. As the
pursued doctor, Kevin McCarthy
wears what seems to be perma
nent look of despair on his face.
The material was remade with
much more care and balance by
Philip Kaufman last year, but this
original still is great fun. Watch
out for the pods, kiddies!
—Ron Lillejord
Julia * * * *
New Varsity
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftmanship dominates
this movie about friendship and
its responsibilities. Jane Fonda
and Vanessa Redgrave star in this
true story based on a chapter of
Lillian Hellman's autobiographi
cal book Pentimento. Both are
brilliant; Fonda effectively cap
tures Hellman's spirited person
ality, and Redgrave delivers a
fine, understated performance as
the idealistic Julia.
—R.L.
The Deer Hunter ★★★ Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made—
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.

wrote and directed this piece of
cloned Hitchcock; he relies on
his stars and his big, dumb music
to get by. Thank Cod one of his
stars is Coldie Hawn. She gets a
chance to strut here, and in this
movie she's a gem lying amohgst
the ordinary. Featuring the
California coastline, San Fran
cisco and, oh yes, Chevy Chase.
—R.L.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.
—R.L.
Norma Rae * * # *
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.
The China Syndrome * # * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
■ —R.L.

The Buddy Holly Story * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.
—J.N.
Cet Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQoflsB.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.

Buck Rouen in the 25th Century
Guild, Menlo Park
This movie is so bad that it
makes Santa Claus Conquers the

features yecchv acting, wretched

mal double-entendres. Buck Ro
gers was made for TV and then
distributed fortheatrical use after
the producers found out how
much money Battlestar Calactica
was making in its Canadian theat
rical run. This explains the film's
rating: "M" for mindless.

Though they're set over two decades apart, both Hair (above) and

An American in Paris * * * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Perhaps the greatest of the big
musicals, this MGM masterpiece
has some mighty impressive
names on its title credits. Arthur
Freed, head of the studio's
legendary musical department,
produced. The score is the best
of George and Ira Gershwin, with
a representative of everything
from the jazzy "I'll Build a Stair
way to Paradise" to the rumbling
"Concerto in F." Vincent Minelli
directed, his eye for spectacle in
top form. Gene Kelly never
danced or sang better than here;
his dancing partner is Leslie
Caron in her first film. The plot,
as the title suggests, deals with
"an American in Paris." This film
is one of the most visually stun
ning and entertaining of all Hol
lywood movies.

Midnight Express BM
Aquarius, Palo Alto^'
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop-out imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. The movie self
righteously bills itself as retelling
a true story; if this is so then why
did the screenwriters choose to
fabricate violent episodes — a
man having his tongue bitten off
in looming close-up, a Turkish
guard (there are no good Turks in
this movie) being impaled on a
coat hook — which never hap
pened to the real Mr. Hayes? If
you should hear Midnight Ex
press' whistle a'blowing, take the
bus instead.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
* * #
Friday, Kresge
The 1956 version of fraternity
arid sorority rush. Director
Donald Siegel doesn't give us any
window dressing in this feisty,
funny, campy suspense movie.
The pods from outer space are
out to get everyone here; be
sides being great for allegory,
this premise pretty well closes
the necessity for subplots. As the
pursued doctor, Kevin McCarthy
wears what seems to be perma
nent look of despair on his face.
The material was remade with
much more care and balance by
Philip Kaufman last year, but this
original still is great fun. Watch
out for the pods, kiddies!
—Ron Lillejord
Julia * * * *
New Varsity
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftmanship dominates
this movie about friendship and
its responsibilities. Jane Fonda
and Vanessa Redgrave star in this
true story based on a chapter of
Lillian Hellman's autobiographi
cal book Pentimento. Both are
brilliant; Fonda effectively cap
tures Hellman's spirited person
ality, and Redgrave delivers a
fine, understated performance as
the idealistic Julia.
—R.L.
The Deer Hunter ★★★ Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made—
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen

The Day the Earth Stood Still
Friday, Kresge * ★ ★
Even with the past decade's re
naissance of the science fiction
movie, this tightly constructed
film from the '50s holds its posi
tion as one of the best of the
genre. A man from another
planet brings a chance for peace
on Earth; he is met with only mis
understanding and fear. It can be
viewed as a condemnation of
McCarthyism or as a movie fulfil
ling the desire to create modern
myth. Whatever one reads into
the film, it remains consistently
entertaining. Julian Blaustein,
now a faculty member of the
Stanford communication de
partment, produced.
—J.M.
Isadora *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Supremely silly biopic about
Isadora Duncan. Vanessa Red
grave plays the great modern
dancer as if her main motivation
in life was being weird; the result
is about as serious as a Looney
Tune cartoon. I'd love to be able
to see the list of the film's prop
erty master where he must have
been required to find "one scarf,
long enough to be caught in the
wheel of a speeding roadster."
James Fox and |ason Robards are
also along for the ride. Karel

—J.M.
Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Harold is a young man whose

is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodrtess of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal

rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Gordon. Songs by Cat Stevens

The last gasp of the MCM mus

most of the studio's creative fire
is gone and we're left with a
movie that's colorful on the out
side but rather cold at its center.
Leslie Caron, though a charming
actress, has trouble maintaining
her role as Colette's scarcely
pubescent French girl. Louis Jor
dan, recent star of FTD Florists
commercials, is a very distant
mentor to the nymphet. Even
Maurice Chevalier seems to
spend more of his time mugging
at the camera than usual. Some
nice tunes and a couple of funny
scenes manage to bail out quite a
bit of the movie. Vincent Minelli
directed; Arthur Freed pro

The Champ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac

start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of Jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.

almost certain to be controver

This movie is so bad that it

Though they're set over two decades apart, both Hair (above) and
An American in Paris (below) rely on song and dance to tell a
story. Hair is showing now at the Menlo Cinema, and An Ameri

Michael Ronnie and Patricia Neal are chaparoned by the robot

An American in Paris * * * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Perhaps the greatest of the big
musicals, this MGM masterpiece
has some mighty impressive
names on its title credits. Arthur
Freed, head of the studio's
legendary musical department,
produced. The score is the best
of George and Ira Gershwin, with
a representative of everything
from the jazzy "I'll Build a Stair
way to Paradise" to the rumbling
"Concerto in F." Vincent Minelli
directed, his eye for spectacle in
top form. Gene Kelly never
danced or sang better than here;
his dancing partner is Leslie
Caron in her first film. The plot,
as the title suggests, deals with
"an American in Paris." This film
is one of the most visually stun
ning and entertaining of all Hol
lywood movies.

Midnight Express BM
Aquarius, Palo Alto^'
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop-out imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. The movie self
righteously bills itself as retelling
a true story; if this is so then why
did the screenwriters choose to
fabricate violent episodes — a
man having his tongue bitten off
in looming close-up, a Turkish
guard (there are no good Turks in
this movie) being impaled on a
coat hook — which never hap
pened to the real Mr. Hayes? If
you should hear Midnight Ex
press' whistle a'blowing, take the
bus instead.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
* * #
Friday, Kresge
The 1956 version of fraternity
arid sorority rush. Director
Donald Siegel doesn't give us any
window dressing in this feisty,
funny, campy suspense movie.
The pods from outer space are
out to get everyone here; be
sides being great for allegory,
this premise pretty well closes
the necessity for subplots. As the
pursued doctor, Kevin McCarthy
wears what seems to be perma
nent look of despair on his face.
The material was remade with
much more care and balance by
Philip Kaufman last year, but this
original still is great fun. Watch
out for the pods, kiddies!
—Ron Lillejord
Julia * * * *
New Varsity
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftmanship dominates
this movie about friendship and
its responsibilities. Jane Fonda
and Vanessa Redgrave star in this
true story based on a chapter of
Lillian Hellman's autobiographi
cal book Pentimento. Both are
brilliant; Fonda effectively cap
tures Hellman's spirited person
ality, and Redgrave delivers a
fine, understated performance as
the idealistic Julia.
—R.L.
The Deer Hunter ★★★ Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made—
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen

The Day the Earth Stood Still
Friday, Kresge * ★ ★
Even with the past decade's re
naissance of the science fiction
movie, this tightly constructed
film from the '50s holds its posi
tion as one of the best of the
genre. A man from another
planet brings a chance for peace
on Earth; he is met with only mis
understanding and fear. It can be
viewed as a condemnation of
McCarthyism or as a movie fulfil
ling the desire to create modern
myth. Whatever one reads into
the film, it remains consistently
entertaining. Julian Blaustein,
now a faculty member of the
Stanford communication de
partment, produced.
—J.M.
Isadora *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Supremely silly biopic about
Isadora Duncan. Vanessa Red
grave plays the great modern
dancer as if her main motivation
in life was being weird; the result
is about as serious as a Looney
Tune cartoon. I'd love to be able
to see the list of the film's prop
erty master where he must have
been required to find "one scarf,
long enough to be caught in the
wheel of a speeding roadster."
James Fox and |ason Robards are
also along for the ride. Karel
Reisz directed.
—J.M.
Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Harold and Maude * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals
and committing suicide. Maude
is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodrtess of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, recently nominated for an
Oscar for Coming Home, di
rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Gordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack.

Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The last gasp of the MCM mus
ical. It's entertaining enough, but
most of the studio's creative fire
is gone and we're left with a
movie that's colorful on the out
side but rather cold at its center.
Leslie Caron, though a charming
actress, has trouble maintaining
her role as Colette's scarcely
pubescent French girl. Louis Jor
dan, recent star of FTD Florists
commercials, is a very distant
mentor to the nymphet. Even
Maurice Chevalier seems to
spend more of his time mugging
at the camera than usual. Some
nice tunes and a couple of funny
scenes manage to bail out quite a
bit of the movie. Vincent Minelli
directed; Arthur Freed pro
duced.

The Champ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of Jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.
—J.M.
Foul Play ★ *
Sunday, Mem Aud
This movie entertains you, all
right; but it's entertainment by
the numbers. Colin Higgins
wrote and directed this piece of
cloned Hitchcock; he relies on
his stars and his big, dumb music
to get by. Thank Cod one of his
stars is Coldie Hawn. She gets a
chance to strut here, and in this
movie she's a gem lying amohgst
the ordinary. Featuring the
California coastline, San Fran
cisco and, oh yes, Chevy Chase.
—R.L.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.

Norma Rae * * # *
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.
The China Syndrome * # * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov

its politics.

The Buddy Holly Story * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.

Cet Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this

with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQoflsB.
The twist is that the story is told
