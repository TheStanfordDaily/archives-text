# Walker chosen secretary
## USE elects Harris president 
### Mark Nassutti 
Mike Harris, a maintenance per
son at the Tresidder bowling alley,
was elected president of the United
Stanford Employees (USE) Wednes
day by a vote of 203 to 80.
Harris' opponent in the election,
David Walker, was elected secretary
of USE on the basis of 39 write-in
votes, as there had been no candi
date for secretary on the ballot. Both
Harris and Walker, a technician at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
were union officers in the last ad
ministration headed by Bob Britton.
Harris' reaction to his victory was
"I'm glad I got it." He said, "My prin
cipal objective is the contract; we're
gearing up for that." (The current
contract with the University expires
Aug. 31.) He went on to say that "I
hope we can not only get a contract
the workers can livewith, but one we
can actually be proud of."
USE is the official representative
for the technical maintenance and
service bargaining unit which covers
approximately 1000 of the 5000 staff
employees at the University.
USE benefits to all staff employees?
Britton, the outgoing president,
indicated that historically, benefits
obtained by the union through
negotiation with the University have
generally become available to or
been applied to all other University
staff employees as well.
Britton commented, "I thought
both candidates (for president) were
well qualified and will be able to
work together. I don't see any dis

sension revolving around it (the elec
tion). I'm happy."
In last year's election, Britton —
along with Harris and Walker — ran
on a slate against jim Berk, a former
union member. The election caused
a serious rift in the union, according
to Britton. Britton affirmed that no
such rift arose this year.
'A matter of style'
Asked about the differences bet
ween himself and Walker, Harris
said, "The difference between us
was a matter of style." Harris said his
style would consist of actively pursu
ing worker involvement in the
negotiation process. He pointed to
the recent contract representative
elections (by geographical rather
than occupational areas) as a positive
step taken during the Britton leader
ship.
"As far as negotiations go, Stan
ford doesn't respond to phone calls,
but they do respond to solid bargain
ing, in good faith, well organized,
but more importantly to a unified
membership. I'm out there to make
sure to get workers involved."
In order to get what he considers a
good contract, Harris said he would
do everything up to and including
strike against the University.
A chance to serve
Asked why he did not run for
reelection, Britton explained that he
felt the leadership of the union
should be passed around. He said he
felt that others in the union should
get a chance to serve the member
ship.

Neither of the candidates voiced
any major criticism of the Britton
administration.
The other union offices were not
contested, with only write-in candi
dates posing any challenge. Paul
Stuart, a sprinkler specialist for the
Grounds Department, was elected
vice president. Bente Galle was
elected treasurer, and Linda Crouse
was elected reporter.
