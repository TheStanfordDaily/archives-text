# Engen 'set' to face Bruins, Waves
## SPORTS 
### Dean Eyre 
It could be difficult for a young vol
leyball player to live up to the reputa
tion of his father, a 10-time Ail-
American and the first person named to
the sport's Hall of Fame.
But if Kip Engen's feet don't exactly fit
his father's footsteps, they already have
carried him a long way along a path of
his choice. Engen's childhood begin
nings in volleyball, rather than placing
any pressure on him, have proven a
valuable asset.
Just how valuable Engen's setting
role is can be evidenced as the Cardi
nals take on some prime Southern
California talent at Maples Pavilion. To
night Stanford faces UCLA and tomor
row's match is with Pepperdine. Both
games are at 7:30 p.m.
"Kip's better than any setter I've seen
as an incoming freshman," said Stan
ford's coach Fred Sturm. That's quite a
compliment, for Sturm was an All-
America with three national champion
UCLA squads, in 1972, 1975 and 1976.
Engen, although only 5-foot-8, was
Southern California Player of the Year
in 1977 for his part in Laguna Beach

High School's state championship.
Now he's an important part of Stan
ford's team in its first season as a
California Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation member.
"I never thought I'd go to Stanford —
I thought that it was mostly for scho
lars," Engen reflects. "I spent some
time up here and liked it. I figured I
would get a good education here and
still have fun playing volleyball rather
than going to UCLA or someplace and
just playing volleyball. You can't play
volleyball your whole life. It's fun right
now, but I know I won't be doing it for
more than three or four years, so I want
to be able to do something else."
Engen's playing experience origi
nated on the Southern California
beaches as a "little kid" rallying with his
father, but it wasn't until high school
that the sport took on real significance.
"I couldn't decide between tennis
and volleyball," he recalled. "I didn't
really get serious until my junior year."
With an established player for a
father and early tutor, was there any
pressure to pursue volleyball?

"No, just because of the way my dad
was," Engen said. "He thought I might
be able to do better in tennis, but he
didn't care either way — he just en
couraged whatever I wanted to do (En
gen's father starred at UCLA and later
made All-American status on the U.S.
national team)."
And the most obvious difference be
tween the high school and college
game? Well, it was a big difference —
"the players are a lot bigger, they go
from 6-feet to 6-3 average," Engen said.
"That's what I notice, I have an O.K.
jump, so I get away with being small."
Although height is important for the
net game, Sturm notes there could be a
payoff in a setter who is not so tall.
"There might be an advantage in being
short because you can run down passes
and set balls that are lower, that a taller
person may have a more difficult time
handling," he said.
Learning to utilize his size, jumping
and setting to his best advantage,
Engen is getting pointers from assistant
coach John Bekins, who also brings top
credentials to the Card program.

An alumnus of UCLA, Bekins played
on the 1974 and 1975 national champ
Bruin squads, was named NCAA Player
of the Year in '75 and then joined the
U.S. national team for two years.
"Cod's gift to volleyball," as Engen
describes UCLA, is tough enough in
any season of volleyball, but this year
they just happen to be off to the best
start in Bruin history. Sporting a spot
less 24-0 record overall and an equally
unblemished 13-0 mark in league play,
UCLA seems well on its way to a
seventh national title.
After Stanford takes on the awesome
Uclan tonight, there's not much of a
breather before playing defending na
tional champion Pepperdine. While the
Waves have seemingly lost their bid for
back-to-back national titles with an 8-4
record, they are still a strong squad to
deal with.
The Cards hope to get back on the
winning track after suffering a five
game losing streak, but with the pow
erhouses in town, Stanford will have
quite a task improving its 1-12 league,
4-12 overall record.

beaches as a "little kid" rallying with his
father, but it wasn't until high school
that the sport took on real significance.
"I couldn't decide between tennis
and volleyball," he recalled. "I didn't
really get serious until my junior year."
With an established player for a
father and early tutor, was there any
pressure to pursue volleyball?

"No, just because of the way my dad
was," Engen said. "He thought I might
be able to do better in tennis, but he
didn't care either way — he just en
couraged whatever I wanted to do (En
gen's father starred at UCLA and later
made All-American status on the U.S.
national team)."
And the most obvious difference be
tween the high school and college
game? Well, it was a big difference —
"the players are a lot bigger, they go
from 6-feet to 6-3 average," Engen said.
"That's what I notice, I have an O.K.
jump, so I get away with being small."
Although height is important for the
net game, Sturm notes there could be a
payoff in a setter who is not so tall.
"There might be an advantage in being
short because you can run down passes
and set balls that are lower, that a taller
person may have a more difficult time
handling," he said.
Learning to utilize his size, jumping
and setting to his best advantage,
Engen is getting pointers from assistant
coach John Bekins, who also brings top
credentials to the Card program.

An alumnus of UCLA, Bekins played
on the 1974 and 1975 national champ
Bruin squads, was named NCAA Player
of the Year in '75 and then joined the
U.S. national team for two years.
"Cod's gift to volleyball," as Engen
describes UCLA, is tough enough in
any season of volleyball, but this year
they just happen to be off to the best
start in Bruin history. Sporting a spot
less 24-0 record overall and an equally
unblemished 13-0 mark in league play,
UCLA seems well on its way to a
seventh national title.
After Stanford takes on the awesome
Uclan tonight, there's not much of a
breather before playing defending na
tional champion Pepperdine. While the
Waves have seemingly lost their bid for
back-to-back national titles with an 8-4
record, they are still a strong squad to
deal with.
The Cards hope to get back on the
winning track after suffering a five
game losing streak, but with the pow
erhouses in town, Stanford will have
quite a task improving its 1-12 league,
4-12 overall record.

TRESHMAN SETTER Kip Engen serves as the Stanford volleyball
team's "quarterback" by organizing the court action and feeding the
ball to Card spikers. Maples Pavilion will be the site of hard-hitting
play as Stanford hosts UCLA tonight and Pepperdine tomorrow.
It could be difficult for a young vol
leyball player to live up to the reputa
tion of his father, a 10-time Ail-
American and the first person named to
the sport's Hall of Fame.
But if Kip Engen's feet don't exactly fit
his father's footsteps, they already have
carried him a long way along a path of
his choice. Engen's childhood begin
nings in volleyball, rather than placing
any pressure on him, have proven a
valuable asset.
Just how valuable Engen's setting
role is can be evidenced as the Cardi
nals take on some prime Southern
California talent at Maples Pavilion. To
night Stanford faces UCLA and tomor
row's match is with Pepperdine. Both
games are at 7:30 p.m.
"Kip's better than any setter I've seen
as an incoming freshman," said Stan
ford's coach Fred Sturm. That's quite a
compliment, for Sturm was an All-
America with three national champion
UCLA squads, in 1972, 1975 and 1976.
Engen, although only 5-foot-8, was
Southern California Player of the Year
in 1977 for his part in Laguna Beach

High School's state championship.
Now he's an important part of Stan
ford's team in its first season as a
California Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation member.
"I never thought I'd go to Stanford —
I thought that it was mostly for scho
lars," Engen reflects. "I spent some
time up here and liked it. I figured I
would get a good education here and
still have fun playing volleyball rather
than going to UCLA or someplace and
just playing volleyball. You can't play
volleyball your whole life. It's fun right
now, but I know I won't be doing it for
more than three or four years, so I want
to be able to do something else."

nated on the Southern California
