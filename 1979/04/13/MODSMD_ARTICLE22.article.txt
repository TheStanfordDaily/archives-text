# Treon's women improve with status

With the possible exception
of jogging's mass popularity,
an oft-applied portrayal of
track devotees is the "loneli
ness of the long-distance run
ner."
Well, at least for Stanford's
women tracksters, things have
gotten a lot less lonely this
year; in fact, they've found a
new friend in the person of
Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
And with improved oppor
tunities to recruit athletes, next
year promises to bring quite a
gathering to Stanford's newest
varsity sport.
In their last home meet of
the season, the Cardinals host
Hayward State, San Francisco
State, Stanislaus State and
UC-Davis. Competition at
Stanford Stadium commences
tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. for the
first field events, with the initial
running event slated for 1 p.m.
Five notable performers in
the meet are Hayward's
Michelle Aubuchon and Stan
ford's Denise Torrey, Andrea
Cheek, Joanne Ernst and Ann

Thrupp. Aubuchon surpassed
the qualifying time for the
5000-meter run of the AIAW
Nationals during last Sunday's
invitiational meet at Berkeley.
Torrey posts a best of 13.1 in
the 100 while quarter-miler
Cheek ran two consecutive
61-second 440s at the Berkeley
meet. In the 5000 meters, Ernst
has a best of 18:35.4 and clip
ped half a minute off of her

personal best last Sunday.
All-America Thrupp, although
competing in cross-country
rather than track since 1976, set
a University record of 18:15.2
at Berkeley.
The invitational meet is indi
cative of the rapid progress
shown by the track team mem
bers, due in part to the dedica
tion of the athletes and en
couragement from head coach

Laurel Treon.
In talking with Treon, it is
readily apparent that for her,
the attitude of dedication is a
fundamental element of a
good athlete. With a snowball
effect, this attitude in turn
strengthens the track program
and draws new athletes to the
team.
"I think all we have to do is
let people know we are com

mitted to developing a quality
program, that we are commit
ted to becoming as competi
tive as we can be with estab
lished programs at major uni
versities," Treon said. "Our
environment here, at the Uni
versity, in the (Athletic) De
partment — the support we are
receiving is the best aspect in
realizing those goals."
Varsity status alone won't
carry a team. There needs to be
a team enthusiasm to really ex
cel. Treon noted this trait when
workouts began in January.
"My number one observa
tion about the beginning of the
program was the fact that there
was definitely a strong in
terest," Treon recalled. "We
had over 30 girls turn out.
That's based on very little pub
licity of the past two years of a
limited club sport situation, so
I was encouraged that there'd
be this much interest.
"It's been a difficult season
in some ways — injuries, lack
of experience, having a meet
rained out, disruptions in train
ing. I've been reflecting on
what we've gone through and
I've been truly impressed. A lot
of these girls are out here with
very little experience and just
saying 'I'm going to go for it
anyway, I'm going to see what I
can do here.' They're not afraid
to really put out. That is the
attitude we need to build a
program."
I
The first indication of the
changing attitude towards
women's track came with the
inclusion of Treon as coach.
With a young team (16
freshmen and 10 sophomores
of the 30 athletes listed on the
roster), University recognition
and an enthusiastic coach, the
women's track program here is
definitely taking great strides
out ot the starting blocks.
Add to that a team determi
nation and increasing competi
tive experience and it's clear
Stanford's women will be giv
ing the opposition a run for
their money.
