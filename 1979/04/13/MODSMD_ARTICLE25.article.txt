# Stanford seeks sailing success

### Holly North 
As Stanford's sailing team
enters mid-season, it is plan
ning to make strong bids in up
coming championship regat
tas.
A two-day regatta at Berkeley
last weekend concluded the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
Yacht Racing Association
(PCIYRA) Northern California
Series which began in January.
Teams from California, UC-
Santa Cruz, USF, Sonoma
State, Chico State and Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo com
peted in the series. Two diffe
rent classes of boats used were
one-man Lasers and two-man
Flying Juniors.
Last weekend's regatta on
the choppy waters of San Fran
cisco Bay was exciting, as Stan
ford wrapped up the Laser divi
sion with first-place finishes on
both days and ended up sec
ond toCal in the Flying Juniors.
The team recently proved it
self on a national level when it
went to Annapolis, Md., during
spring break to compete in the
Trux Umsted intersectional re
gatta hosted by the Naval
Academy.
Chuck Lamphere and Alan
Norman skippered 420s in the
two-man dinghy division, with
Russ Winslow, John Friend and
Brad Melmon crewing. Bill Kel
ler and Paul Yost sailed Lasers
in the singlehanded category.

Stanford finished ninth out
of 20 schools in the overall
standings, beating two schools
from the top 10 rankings and
squeezing by Cal by four
points. Stanford's current na
tional ranking in Yacht Racing
is 15th, and these results
should raise it.
Stanford has also qualified
for the PCIYRA team race finals
which will be sailed at Berkeley
May 4. Coach Chris Wilson
feels, "Our chances are good
for earning a qualifying slot for
the nationals, although I think
our best chances are in the
singlehanded (Laser) divi
sion."
West Coast championship
regattas will be held in May,
with qualifying sailors advanc
ing to nationals in June. The
singlehanded event is in Gal
veston, the two-man dinghies
and team racing are in Chicago
and the women's regatta is at
Vale.
Stanford's team consists of
25 members, nearly half of
whom are freshmen. Practice is
held on Lake Lagunita, with
some sessions at Santa Cruz
and San Francisco Bay for more
challenging conditions.
Wilson, the volunteercoach,
is new to Stanford this year. He
began sailing on the East Coast,
co-captained Princeton's team
in 1973 and has since coached
Princeton's women's team to
two national championships.
