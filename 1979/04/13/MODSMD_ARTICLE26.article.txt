# Racketeers at UCLA, USC
## Cards meet tough foes 
### Jeff Brandon 
"This is the first test of a new
team," said freshman Tim
Mayotte. "I think we're a diffe
rent team since spring break,
and with everybody playing
better, it should be an interest
ing weekend."
So it is with optimism that
the Stanford men's tennis team
travels down to Los Angeles
this weekend to meet pow
erhouses UCLA today and USC
tomorrow.
The Cardinals, however,
have achieved the L.A. sweep
only once. That was last year,
and even then it wasn't easy. It
took a diving, angled backhand
winner by John McEnroe to
save a match point and the
match for the Cards as they
broke UCLA's 58-match home
winning streak.
The Bruins (15-1) are unde
feated so far this season at
UCLA Stadium, where they
have dropped just five matches
since 1967.
The Trojans (12-0) are also
tough at home, as just last
week they defeated UCLA
there 5-4.
The Bruins have been
world-beaters, stunning all the
top teams in what was sup

posed to be a rebuilding year
for them.
"This is the youngest and
most inexperienced team I've
coached at UCLA," said Bruin
coach Glenn Bassett of his
squad that includes three
freshmen and a sophomore in
the starting lineup. "It can also
be said that at this point this is
my most suprising Bruin
team," he added.
UCLA has so far won the Na
tional Intercollegiate Tennis
Classic, defeating No.
3-ranked Southern Methodist
6-3, No. 4 Trinity 7-2, No. 6 Ar
kansas 5-4 and No. 7 Pepper
dine 7-2.
The Bruins are led by
sophomore Fritz Buehning,
who has recorded dual-match
wins over Andy Kohlberg and
Eric Ishersky, the No. 1 and No.
2-ranked collegians respec
tively.
Buehning is backed up by
juniors Mike Harrington and
Dick Metz and freshmen Mar
cel Freeman, Blaine Willen
borg and Bruce Brescia.
"They've got to be favored,"
said Stanford's Peter Rennert.
"On paper we match up really
well with them; in fact I think
we might have the edge.

"But 'on paper' meant no
thing this year," Rennert
laughed.
"Individually they don't look
that impressive, but as a team
they do amazing things," Re
nnert continued. "I wish (John)
Rast was healthy for this match.
Just having him in the lineup
seemed to help our team's
confidence."
Rast, who played against
California and Arizona State, is
once again having back prob
lems and will be sidelined for
another three weeks.
USC is also a young team,
returning just one starter,
Robert Van't Hot. Van't Hot,
who last year was one of the
few to extend McEnroe to
three sets, is again at the top of
the Trojan ladder.
Three freshmen — Billy
Nealon, Roger Knapp and Sean
Brawley — are also in the top
six. Doug Adler and Jack
Kruger round out the Trojan
lineup.
USC is the undisputed No. 1
team in the nation, being the
only undefeated squad in
major college tennis.
"These are three good,
young, hungry teams," said
Card coach Dick Gould. "In
fact, they're borderline to
being outstanding. Win or lose
we're going to learn some
thing. It's a real opportunity
and a real challenge for us."
