singles player, Susie Schmidt, with consecutive 6-0, 6-0 sets. Lisa
Gordon, Marianne Ingard, and Andrea Markl, rounding out the
six singles positions for Stanford, each won with a minimum of
trouble and, as so often happens, the Cardinals had clinched the
team match before the beginning of the doubles.
