# Districting on ballot as constitutional revision
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
ASSU senators obtained last night
the necessary 611 student signatures
required to place their Rules Com
mittee's election districting propos
als on the spring quarter ballot as a
constitutional amendment.
The ASSU Constitution stipulates
that an amendment will be placed
before the students for ratification
upon approval by two-thirds of the
senate or upon petition by 5 percent
of the student body.
Unable to achieve the required 14
votes in favor of the amendment at its
Tuesday night meeting, the senate
voted instead to submit a districting
plan to the students as a referendum
issue. By doing that, the senate
would merely be given an indication
of student opinion toward district
ing.
Assuming that a majority of the
student body approved the referen
dum, the senate would still have to
acquire its own 14 votes to solicit a
final student decision on the con
stitutional question in a run-off elec
tion.
By gathering the6ll signatures in a
harried, two-day rush, the senators
circumvented that potential com
plexity. Now both the constitutional
amendment, which must be passed
bya2/3vote, and the referendum will
appear on the ballot.

No decisions could be made at last
night's meeting because the 11-
senator quorum was not reached. In
stead, University President Richard
Lyman addressed the queries of the
seven senators in attendance.
Lyman remarked that last night set
a precedent for him in that "this is
the first time that I can recall that I
have been asked to talk to the senate
twice in one year."
Lyman said he observed an "en
demic problem," which perennially
endangers the effectiveness of the
senate â€” "the tendency to get de
railed over and over again" from
stated intentions to momentary con
troversies. He advised the senate
that more concentration on outlining
specific plans at the beginning of its
session and a subsequent emphasis
on sustained power throughout the
year could have more impact on the
University.
Lyman also argued that a student
member on the Board of Trustees
would further politicize that body
and confuse its actual purpose, that
of a removed liaison between the
University and outside society.
He expressed frustration at local
government blockage of University
road construction, which could mol
lify the Lomita extension debate.
"Roadways and parking are far more
insoluble than curriculum," he said.
