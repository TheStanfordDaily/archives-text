NRC warns 34 nuclear plants
Washington — The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
told operators of 34 atomic power plants yesterday to
beware of the kinds of mistakes and breakdowns that
plunged the Three Mile Island plant to the brink of
disaster.
The NRC had already issued new orders, shortly after
the March 28 accident near Harrisburg, Pa., to the
operators of the nine nuclear plants designed by Three
Mile Island's builder, Babcock & Wilcox. The new direc
tive went to 34 plants designed by Westinghouse Corp.
and Combustion Engineering Corp.
The NRC made clear for the first time that all 34 of the
"pressurized water reactors" in the nation might be
vulnerable to the same kinds of mishaps that damaged
the nuclear core of Three Mile Island's Unit 2 and raised
the danger of a melt-down that could have released large
amounts of radioactivity.
The N RC ordered the operators of the 34 plants to take
steps to either avoid or learn how to cope with the kind
of problems that plagued Three Mile Island.
U.S. diplomats accused of spying
Cape Town, South Africa — Prime Minister Pieter Botha
charged yesterday that some U.S. Embassy personnel
have snooped on sensitive areas of South Africa with a
specially equipped "spy plane," and he ordered them to
leave the country within a week.
The embassy said it would have no comment, but the
State Department in Washington said three U.S. Air
Force personnel assigned to the embassy were ordered
out.
The prime minister identified the spy plane as the
private aircraft of U.S. Ambassador William Edmonson.
He did not announce the name of anyone charged with
spying, nor did he say how many people were allegedly
involved.
The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria said the plane, a twin
engine C-124A, was equipped with a camera and took
aerial photographs, but a spokesman said he would not
call the photography espionage.
Manhunt for Amin is urged
Kampala, Uganda — A frenzy of looting swept Kampala
yesterday and thousands of joyous Ugandans rallied in a
city square to cheer the fall of Idi Amin.
"All Ugandans who love their motherland must from
now on help find Idi Amin wherever he is. He deserves
the gallows," the victorious exiles in command of Kam
pala radio declared yesterday.
But the defeated dictator, broadcasting from some
where in eastern Uganda, insisted the country was still
his.
"We have got our soliders controlling the country,"
Amin declared. His troops were reported streaming to

ward the Kenyan border in a chaotic rout, however,
fleeing the Tanzanian forces and Ugandan rebels who
captured Kampala late Tuesday.
Residents of towns east of the capital said the ragged
soldiers were looting, harassing local residents at gun
point, stealing cars and retreating beyond Jinja, the city
50 miles east of here said to be Amin's new headquar
ters, to Mbale and Tororo near Kenya.
Iranian minister now backs purge
Tehran, Iran — Despite Western protests, Iran's Is
lamic tribunals continue to dispense revolutionary jus
tice in nightly rounds of executions. More and more the
victims, who at first tended to be generals and police
chiefs, are diplomats, mayors and other politicians.
More than 5000 members of the old regime are be
lieved to be in jail now.
The provisional prime minister appointed by Kho
meini, Mehdi Bazargan, said in an interview published
yesterday that he hopes the revolutionary courts "will
stop within a year and . . . our Justice Ministry will take
over this work."
It was Bazargan's first comment on the executions
since the firing squads resumed their work a week ago
after a three-week suspension.
Last month his denunciations of summary revolutio
nary justice as "irreligious, inhumane and disgraceful"
led to the suspension and a supposed review of the
system by Khomeini.
As other officials of his government have done, Bazar
gan in the interview in effect washed his hands of the
bloody purge, saying he supports the executions but
"that's the business of the courts. We don't stick our
noses in there." He was interviewed by West Germany's
Bild Zeitung newspaper.
Holidays cause listless trading
New York — Stock prices declined slightly yesterday in
a listless pre-holiday session.

Declines nosed out advances by a 4-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume came to 26.78 million shares against
32.90 million in the previous session.

clouds extending inland nights and mornings. Warming
trend. Lows in the 40s to low 50s. Highs in the upper 60s
and 70s.

chiefs, are diplomats, mayors and other politicians.
More than 5000 members of the old regime are be
lieved to be in jail now.
The provisional prime minister appointed by Kho
meini, Mehdi Bazargan, said in an interview published
yesterday that he hopes the revolutionary courts "will
stop within a year and . . . our Justice Ministry will take
over this work."
It was Bazargan's first comment on the executions
since the firing squads resumed their work a week ago
after a three-week suspension.
Last month his denunciations of summary revolutio
nary justice as "irreligious, inhumane and disgraceful"
led to the suspension and a supposed review of the
system by Khomeini.
As other officials of his government have done, Bazar
gan in the interview in effect washed his hands of the
bloody purge, saying he supports the executions but
"that's the business of the courts. We don't stick our
noses in there." He was interviewed by West Germany's
Bild Zeitung newspaper.

NRC warns 34 nuclear plants
Washington — The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
told operators of 34 atomic power plants yesterday to
beware of the kinds of mistakes and breakdowns that
plunged the Three Mile Island plant to the brink of
disaster.
The NRC had already issued new orders, shortly after
the March 28 accident near Harrisburg, Pa., to the
operators of the nine nuclear plants designed by Three
Mile Island's builder, Babcock & Wilcox. The new direc
tive went to 34 plants designed by Westinghouse Corp.
and Combustion Engineering Corp.
The NRC made clear for the first time that all 34 of the
"pressurized water reactors" in the nation might be
vulnerable to the same kinds of mishaps that damaged
the nuclear core of Three Mile Island's Unit 2 and raised
the danger of a melt-down that could have released large
amounts of radioactivity.
The N RC ordered the operators of the 34 plants to take
steps to either avoid or learn how to cope with the kind
of problems that plagued Three Mile Island.
U.S. diplomats accused of spying
Cape Town, South Africa — Prime Minister Pieter Botha
charged yesterday that some U.S. Embassy personnel
have snooped on sensitive areas of South Africa with a
specially equipped "spy plane," and he ordered them to
leave the country within a week.
The embassy said it would have no comment, but the
State Department in Washington said three U.S. Air
Force personnel assigned to the embassy were ordered
out.
The prime minister identified the spy plane as the
private aircraft of U.S. Ambassador William Edmonson.
He did not announce the name of anyone charged with
spying, nor did he say how many people were allegedly
involved.
The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria said the plane, a twin
engine C-124A, was equipped with a camera and took
aerial photographs, but a spokesman said he would not
call the photography espionage.
Manhunt for Amin is urged
Kampala, Uganda — A frenzy of looting swept Kampala
yesterday and thousands of joyous Ugandans rallied in a
city square to cheer the fall of Idi Amin.
"All Ugandans who love their motherland must from
now on help find Idi Amin wherever he is. He deserves
the gallows," the victorious exiles in command of Kam
pala radio declared yesterday.
But the defeated dictator, broadcasting from some
where in eastern Uganda, insisted the country was still
his.
"We have got our soliders controlling the country,"
Amin declared. His troops were reported streaming to

ward the Kenyan border in a chaotic rout, however,
fleeing the Tanzanian forces and Ugandan rebels who
captured Kampala late Tuesday.
Residents of towns east of the capital said the ragged
soldiers were looting, harassing local residents at gun
point, stealing cars and retreating beyond Jinja, the city
50 miles east of here said to be Amin's new headquar
ters, to Mbale and Tororo near Kenya.
Iranian minister now backs purge

lamic tribunals continue to dispense revolutionary jus
tice in nightly rounds of executions. More and more the

chiefs, are diplomats, mayors and other politicians.
