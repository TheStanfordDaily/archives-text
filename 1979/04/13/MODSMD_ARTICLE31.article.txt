# Environment Month underway
## 
### 
A series of speeches and panel dis
cussions, along with an alternative
energy fair, will be the featured
events of Environment Month here.
The month, which opened Tues
day night with a keynote speech by
David Brower, president of Friends
of the Earth, will cover many aspects
of environmental and energy issues.
A panel discussion on the
economics of environmental regula
tion was held here Wednesday night,
and other discussions will be on nuc
lear power, forest policy, and future
Calfornia energy policies. Speeches
on energy-efficient architecture, al
ternative energy sources, Alaska and
recycling will also occur throughout
the month, which will end on May 3.
The month's activities were or
ganized by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, Stanford Energy Action and
the students in the SWOPSI course
"American Wilderness: Politics of

Preservation."
According to junior Harvey Rose,
one of the founders of Stanford
Energy Action, the three groups each
had plans for a week of environmen
tally related events, but after combin
ing forces, decided to change it to a
month.
Rose said the month is "dedicated
to exploring energy resource prob
lems and to studying the environ
ment." He added, "it is not just a
focus on the problems," but also on
their causes and solutions.
Funding for the speakers and ac

tivities, which will cost approxi
mately $2800, according to Greg Call
of the ASSU Speakers Bureau, is
being partially provided by the
Speakers Bureau, the Institute for
Energy Studies, the Office of Student
Activities, the Environmental Law
Society, and by a benefit concert by
local artists planned for May 4. Rose
said he hopes the project will also
receive funding from SWOPSI and
the Dickenson fund, a program fund
of the Office of Undergraduate
Studies. Call said that $500 is still
needed.
