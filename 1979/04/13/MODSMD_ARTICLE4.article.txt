# S. Africa investment protest spreads

Protesting the apartheid regime in South Africa, a
growing number of college students across the country
have been demanding that their schools divest of stocks
from banks and companies which have business in
South Africa.
Students at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.,
called a two-day strike on April 5 and 6 and occupied the
administration building over the weekend, according to
Mark Horawitz, news editor of the university's student
newspaper.
Horawitz said the strike was called by The Disinvest
ment Movement, a group of students who are demand
ing total divestment of approximately $6 million of uni
versity funds from 28 corporations and banks which
have business in South Africa.
The Disinvestment Movement asked students and fa
culty to support divestment by missing class for the two
days which coincided with the Brandeis Board of Trus
tees' budget meeting.
Horawitz said it was difficult to judge how many
people complied with the request, because many stu
dents leave the campus early for the weekend.
Shareholder activity
On Friday afternoon the Board of Trustees issued a
statement which said that the university would try to
change the corporations' policies through a program of
rigorous shareholder activity. Where this failed, the

trustees said, the university would divest.
The Disinvestment Movement was not satisfied by this
statement, and, Horawitz said, between 40 and 120 stu
dents occupied the administration building over the
weekend.
The sit-in was supported by a cross section of the
campus community, including three members of the
faculty. Although the student senate did not officially
endorse the action, all the senators participated in it,
Horawitz said. There was no official faculty response to
the sit-in.
No students removed
The University made no attempt to remove students
from the building, Horawitz said, and the sit-in ended
peacefully on Monday morning, when the protesters
held a press conference.
On Monday afternoon the Board of Trustees issued a
clarification of their previous statement, declaring a
moratorium on the stocks and bonds of those corpora
tions doing business in South Africa which they deemed
to be "causing severe social injury." The trustees de
fined injury according to three criteria:
'Sullivan Principles'
— Companies with offices or subsidiaries in South
Africa which supply services or products to the military,
the police or government agencies in South Africa;
— All banks making loans to the South African gov-
