# S. Africa investment protest spreads

### Gayle Mayers 
Protesting the apartheid regime in South Africa, a
growing number of college students across the country
have been demanding that their schools divest of stocks
from banks and companies which have business in
South Africa.
Students at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.,
called a two-day strike on April 5 and 6 and occupied the
administration building over the weekend, according to
Mark Horawitz, news editor of the university's student
newspaper.
Horawitz said the strike was called by The Disinvest
ment Movement, a group of students who are demand
ing total divestment of approximately $6 million of uni
versity funds from 28 corporations and banks which
have business in South Africa.
The Disinvestment Movement asked students and fa
culty to support divestment by missing class for the two
days which coincided with the Brandeis Board of Trus
tees' budget meeting.
Horawitz said it was difficult to judge how many
people complied with the request, because many stu
dents leave the campus early for the weekend.
Shareholder activity
On Friday afternoon the Board of Trustees issued a
statement which said that the university would try to
change the corporations' policies through a program of
rigorous shareholder activity. Where this failed, the

trustees said, the university would divest.
The Disinvestment Movement was not satisfied by this
statement, and, Horawitz said, between 40 and 120 stu
dents occupied the administration building over the
weekend.
The sit-in was supported by a cross section of the
campus community, including three members of the
faculty. Although the student senate did not officially
endorse the action, all the senators participated in it,
Horawitz said. There was no official faculty response to
the sit-in.
No students removed
The University made no attempt to remove students
from the building, Horawitz said, and the sit-in ended
peacefully on Monday morning, when the protesters
held a press conference.
On Monday afternoon the Board of Trustees issued a
clarification of their previous statement, declaring a
moratorium on the stocks and bonds of those corpora
tions doing business in South Africa which they deemed
to be "causing severe social injury." The trustees de
fined injury according to three criteria:
'Sullivan Principles'
— Companies with offices or subsidiaries in South
Africa which supply services or products to the military,
the police or government agencies in South Africa;
— All banks making loans to the South African gov-
ernment; and
— All corporations which have not signed either the
expanded "Sullivan Principles" (a set of progressive
guidelines demanding equal pay, no segregation and
other moves toward equality) or a similar set of princi
ples.
Horawitz said the trustees will issue another detailed
statement on April 27.
Divestment at Columbia
The Board of Trustees of Columbia University in New
York City has decided to divest $2.7 million of university
funds from three banks with investment in South Africa,
said Jill Bower of The Columbian Daily Spectator.
Bower said that Columbia has $89 million invested in
companies with business in South Africa and that in
)une 1978, the Board of Trustees sent them question
naires about their investments. As a result of the re
sponses they received, the Board of Trustees decided to
divest from three banks.
Bower said that on April 2, between 300 and 400 stu
dents held a rally outside the administration building in
protest of the university's investment policy and that
they were joined by anti-nuclear demonstrators and
campus workers who were on strike.
Michigan policies
At the University of Michigan, the regents' meeting
was disrupted on March 15 and 16 by about 200 members
of the "Washtenow County Coalition Against Apar

theid," a student and community group demanding di
vestment from organizations with business in South Af
rica, a spokesman for The Michigan Daily said.
The spokesman said that in March 1978, the regents
voted not to divest but promised to review the policy this
year.
In October 1978, the regents sent letters to banks and
corporations with investments in South Africa asking
whether they supported the "Sullivan Principles." The
corporations all said that they did and so the question of
divestment was removed from the March agenda.
The regents got a temporary restraining order barring
access to the March meeting after it was disrupted, and
The Michigan Daily spokesman said, they are trying to
get another one issued for the April meeting.
Tigers lunge at trustees
At Princeton University in New Jersey, daily rallies are
being held in front of the administration building by a
student group called "The People's Front for the Libera
tion of South Africa," a spokesman for the Princeton
newspaper said.
The spokesman said that the People's Front called for
a student and faculty strike of classes on April 4 in sup
port of divestment and to coincide with the anniversary
of Martin Luther King's assassination.
Last spring the Board of Trustees rejected all demands
for divestment from firms dealing with South Africa,
saying it was inappropriate to take such a political posi
tion, the spokesman for The Daily Princetonian said.
