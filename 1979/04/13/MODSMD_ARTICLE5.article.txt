# Lyman: not looking for another job
## 
### Kevin Cox 
President Richard Lyman told
KZSU's Campus Conference lis
teners last night that he isn't look
ing for another job, despite re
ports that Food and Drug Ad
ministration Commissioner and
human biology professor Donald
Kennedy will be named provost
and eventually succeed him.
"It wouldn't free me fora job to
get Cod's first lieutenant as pro
vost because this University, like
most, needs both offices to be fil
led," Lyman said at Storey House,
where Campus Conference was
taped.
"I haven't looked fora job since
I looked for a teaching job at
Washington University that I got
in the fall of 1953, and I don't see
any reason to start changing that
well-established habit."
Lyman said that the search
committee assigned to replace
former provost William Miller has
given him 12 names, but he would
not comment on who is being
considered for the post.
On the proposed return of the
U.S. military draft, Lyman said he
was against the implementation of
any college student exemption or
deferral similar to the one used by
students to avoid serving in the
Vietnam War, calling it "one of
,the most socially divisive things

... in the 19605.
"It (the deferral) pitted the
well-to-do and educated against
the poor and uneducated in a dis
asterous fashion," said Lyman.
Necessity of draft discussed
While saying that he didn't have
an "informed view" on the neces
sity of a draft to maintain adequate
personnel in the armed forces,
Lyman did have first-hand know
ledge about the life of a soldier.
"I was drafted — I know in a
very different context, a very dif
ferent war, and so on," said Ly
man, who served three years as an
enlisted man in the U.S. Army
("Army Air Force, as it was then
called," he chuckled).
"One of the things that hap
pened to me . . . was that I met a
range of American people that I
never would have met as a subur
ban kid going to a selective private
college," he said. "A lot of people
would find an interesting educa
tion if they were drafted in the
armed services.
"I'm not really recommending
it for that purpose, because I
didn't like it,(and) I don't like the
government's having coercive
power over people.
"I didn't by any means wholly
enjoy my service in the Army my
self."
Turning to nuclear power,

Lyman was more ambivalent.
"I think the whole thing (the
nuclear accident in Pennsylvania)
is something of a tragedy because
I really don't believe we are going
to do without nuclear power,"
said Lyman.
"People are tending to forget
there wasn't a tragedy. There was
a very serious threat of a massive
tragedy . . . but to listen to some
people's reaction, you'd almost
think we'd actually killed millions
of people in Pennsylvania."
(The University's board of trus
tees voted Stanford's proxy on
6880 shares of Pacific Cas & Elec
tric Co. against a shareholder
proposal to impose a moratorium
on PG&E's construction of new
nuclear power plants because the
wording of the proposal was
"ambiguous," a trustee report
said.)
'Didn't know what to do with it'
"The pro-nuclear advocates
were not helping themselves by
talking as though they had solved
all the problems (with nuclear
power) when everybody knows
perfectly well they have not,"
Lyman admitted. "The federal
regulators weren't prepared for
the bubble when it showed up,
didn't know why it happened, and
didn't know what to do with it."
Asked why Henry Ford II and

Shirley Temple Black were al
lowed to request that portions of
public addresses here last quarter
be off-the-record and unavailable
for use by the media, Lyman said
he couldn't "guarantee" that
speech organizers would advise
speakers about the University's
policy prohibiting such a practice.
He called the University's rule
against off-the-record remarks
during public speeches "clear
cut."

"It (the deferral) pitted the
well-to-do and educated against
the poor and uneducated in a dis
asterous fashion," said Lyman.
Necessity of draft discussed
While saying that he didn't have
an "informed view" on the neces
sity of a draft to maintain adequate
personnel in the armed forces,
Lyman did have first-hand know
ledge about the life of a soldier.
"I was drafted — I know in a
very different context, a very dif
ferent war, and so on," said Ly
man, who served three years as an
enlisted man in the U.S. Army
("Army Air Force, as it was then
called," he chuckled).
"One of the things that hap
pened to me . . . was that I met a
range of American people that I
never would have met as a subur
ban kid going to a selective private
college," he said. "A lot of people
would find an interesting educa
tion if they were drafted in the
armed services.
"I'm not really recommending
it for that purpose, because I
didn't like it,(and) I don't like the
government's having coercive
power over people.
"I didn't by any means wholly
enjoy my service in the Army my
self."
Turning to nuclear power,

Lyman was more ambivalent.
"I think the whole thing (the
nuclear accident in Pennsylvania)
is something of a tragedy because
I really don't believe we are going
to do without nuclear power,"
said Lyman.
"People are tending to forget
there wasn't a tragedy. There was
a very serious threat of a massive
tragedy . . . but to listen to some
people's reaction, you'd almost
think we'd actually killed millions
of people in Pennsylvania."
(The University's board of trus
tees voted Stanford's proxy on
6880 shares of Pacific Cas & Elec
tric Co. against a shareholder
proposal to impose a moratorium
on PG&E's construction of new
nuclear power plants because the
wording of the proposal was
"ambiguous," a trustee report
said.)
'Didn't know what to do with it'
"The pro-nuclear advocates
were not helping themselves by
talking as though they had solved
all the problems (with nuclear
power) when everybody knows
perfectly well they have not,"
Lyman admitted. "The federal
regulators weren't prepared for
the bubble when it showed up,
didn't know why it happened, and
didn't know what to do with it."
Asked why Henry Ford II and

Shirley Temple Black were al
lowed to request that portions of
public addresses here last quarter
be off-the-record and unavailable
for use by the media, Lyman said
he couldn't "guarantee" that
speech organizers would advise
speakers about the University's
policy prohibiting such a practice.
He called the University's rule
against off-the-record remarks
during public speeches "clear
cut."

Discussing such issues as nuclear
power and the draft, President
Richard Lyman visited students at
Storey House last night.
President Richard Lyman told
KZSU's Campus Conference lis
teners last night that he isn't look
ing for another job, despite re
ports that Food and Drug Ad
ministration Commissioner and
human biology professor Donald
Kennedy will be named provost
and eventually succeed him.
"It wouldn't free me fora job to
get Cod's first lieutenant as pro
vost because this University, like
most, needs both offices to be fil
led," Lyman said at Storey House,
where Campus Conference was
taped.
"I haven't looked fora job since
I looked for a teaching job at
Washington University that I got
in the fall of 1953, and I don't see
any reason to start changing that
well-established habit."
Lyman said that the search
committee assigned to replace
former provost William Miller has
given him 12 names, but he would
not comment on who is being
considered for the post.
On the proposed return of the
U.S. military draft, Lyman said he
was against the implementation of
any college student exemption or
deferral similar to the one used by
students to avoid serving in the
Vietnam War, calling it "one of
,the most socially divisive things

... in the 19605.
"It (the deferral) pitted the
well-to-do and educated against
the poor and uneducated in a dis
asterous fashion," said Lyman.
