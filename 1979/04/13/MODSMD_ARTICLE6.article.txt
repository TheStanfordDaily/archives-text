# Text of proposed amendments to the ASSU constitution
## 
### 
At next week's annual ASSU spring election, students
will vote on several constitutional amendments.
Amendment I provides for3o full senators and staggered
spring-fall elections but maintains the present system of
at-large selection of senators. Amendment II makes alt
erations in the Nominations Committee (Nom Com) by
placing a senator on that committee. It also provides for
a method by which student committee members may be
removed. Amendment 111 provides for the use of non
sexist language in the ASSU Constitution. Amendment
IV details new procedures by which fee assessments are
placed on the ballot. Amendment V details the time at
which amendments, if passed, will become operative.
Finally, Amendment VI outlines another proposal for
election reform in which 30 full senators are elected and
staggered spring-fall elections are held. It differs from
Amendment I in its provision for district elections. The
campus would be divided into 10 districts. Twenty
senators would be elected in the fall through district
elections. The 10 additional senators would be elected
at-large in a spring election.
Below is the text of both the present constitution
sections and the proposed changes.
