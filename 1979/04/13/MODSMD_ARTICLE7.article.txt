Dear Bug Me:
An old Stanford friend told me that the Stan
ford Chinese Students Association had or
ganized some variety shows - like the present
China Night - some 25 years ago. Do you know
where I can get old pictures of such occasions?
-M.S.C.
Louis Wu of the Chinese Students Associa
tion, said the group has no such pictures, and
that the present show has been going only since
1973. Peggy Coesfeld, library specialist at the
University Archives, also said they have no
material on such shows, although they have re
cords of the parties and dances.
This year's China Night will be Sunday in Din
kelspiel Auditorium at 8 p.m. and according to
Wu, will feature dancing, singing and martial
acts demonstrations, as well as a skit in English
that portrays the lives of Asian-American stu
dents here.

Dear Bug Me:
The University staff was requested to enroll in
the new Stanford Disability Plan because it of
fered many advantages. These monetary advan
tages to the University were not given. Could
you please obtain the estimated annual savings
that the University anticipates as a result of shift
ing to this plan?
-C.R.
According to Robert Beth, director of Risk
Management, the University will not save any
thing in shifting over from the state
administered disability plan to its own scheme,
but it will gain control of the $400,000 in pre
mium reserves not paid out.
Under state law, employees must pay one
percent of the first $11,000 of their wages for

disability insurance. Beth said that under the
University plan, benefits are larger, and the in
stitution benefits from the reserves. Employees
have to contribute the same amount under any
plan, but because the faculty and staff here have
a better working record than the average
employee (the record shows that professionals
lose less time to sickness than the population at
large), this reserve has accumulated.

Dear Bug Me:
After the "Cliveden Experience" we are curi
ous as to how the Overseas Studies Office picks
its group leaders.
-/./?. and Y.R.
Brad Roberts, staff assistant at Overseas
Studies, said his office usually asks "someone
we've worked with through the quarter here at
Stanford, and gotten to know in more than a
perfunctory way" to assume the volunteer job.
The group leader is responsible for carrying
packets of materials destined for the campuses
and group tickets for students on their way over.
The leaders, sometimes maligned for their ina
bility to resist seasickness or disorientation in
Old World capitals, may also be responsible for
directing his companions through customs, to
connecting buses, or to the security of their first
night's lodging abroad. Roberts said his office
generally has had few complaints about group
leaders, especially as more and more students
travel abroad before their stay at a foreign cam
pus.
