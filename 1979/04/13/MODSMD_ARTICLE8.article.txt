For the adventurous stu
dent, spring quarter means
good flying weather. The Stan
ford Flying Club, known to
many because of its planes
parked in White Plaza every re
gistration week, offers an op
portunity to both fly and learn
about aviation. It is open to all
students, alumni and other
persons associated with the

University.
According to Stan Allison,
president of the club, there are
now about 130 members, 50 of
whom are pilots. Dave
Carlson, adviser and past pres
ident of the club, explained
that many of those who join
have an interest in aviation, but
might not have the time, the
money or the inclination to
learn how to fly. But, he added,

the non-flying members be
nefit from the seminars,
movies, speakers and field
trips which are only available to
club members.
Of the members who do fly,
Bert Postma, flight instructor,
estimates that 80 percent are
beginners who have not yet
earned their pilot's licenses.
Most people can obtain their
solo license with a minimum of
nine to 18 hours in the air with
an instructor. To be able to
carry passengers one needs to
earn a private pilot license that
requires a minimum of 40
hours in the air and the com
pletion of a written exam.
"Most pilots complete their
private license in approxi
mately 16 weeks," according to
the club's brochure.
The flying club has nine
planes which it leases from pri
vate owners. This way the Uni
versity is not responsible for
the insurance nor is it liable for
any accident, should one oc
cur. According to Allison,
there have been no accidents
affiliated with the club. This is
due to the extensive precau
tions and safety checks taken
by the members, he added.
"We're very careful, we look
out for ourselves," Allison
said.

The cost of a pilot education
is high, but figures show it is
considerably lowerwith the fly
ing club than with flight
schools. The club charges $15
an hour forthe Cessna-150, the
plane in which most beginners
learn to fly, and $13 an hour for
the instructor's time. The
club's brochure claims that
many of those who me» the re
quirements for a solo license
last year did so for less than
$350.
Besides the practical aspect
of being able to save money on
long distance flights, a pilot's
license enables students to
take "joy rides" over the city,
up the San Andreas fault, along
the coast and over the moun
tains for a novel perspective of
the Bay Area.
Members said that another
attraction to filing is the
eight-minute flight to Half
Moon Bay for a picnic on the
beach.
In addition, "there's nothing
more exciting than if you get
into the competition aspect of
flying," one member said.
Carlson, a stunt pilot, said
that when flying, "you have a
lot more feeling of control than
when you're driving. It can be
everything from exhilarating
on a good day to humbling if
the weather is bad."
