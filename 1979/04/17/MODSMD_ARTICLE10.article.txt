# Staff members here write fiction in their 'spare time'

### Krisan Froelich 
Many professors here, in
addition to having their teach
ing commitments and research
obligations, somehow find
time to write novels. While
many professors have written
academic books, there are also
many who have written fiction,
and reasons for this vary with
the individual.
Prof. Albert Cuerard, who
teaches English and
humanities courses, said he
writes because he has to.
"People need to externalize
themselves," he explained.
A former Daily sportswriter
and a professor here since
1961, Guerard is the author of
six novels, several critical
books and numerous essays
and articles, some of which
explain how he gets his ideas
for his books.
Cuerard wrote his fifth
novel, The Bystander, in about
five weeks and revised it in one
month. This is an exception, he
said, adding that he usually
works on a novel about five or
six years.
Guerard has taken experi
ences and memories from his
life and has expanded them
into three of his novels, or as
he put it: "Reality turns into
fiction."
"Many people do not realize
that they are writing a novel,"
he said. "They write a couple of
short stories and do not realize
that those stories are feeding
into a novel."
Cuerard is now working on
another novel, and although

three chapters have already
been published in a literary
journal, he said he is now hav
ing second thoughts about the
book, which consists of two re
lated, fictional short stories.
"I have a reason for inter
locking them, although most
people think Jhe two are sepa
rate. I thought I had finished
the novel but now I'm not so
sure," he said.'
But he is confident he will
eventually complete it.
"I'll finish it before I die," he
laughed.
Mark Kelman, an associate
professor at the Law School
also writes from personal ex

periences. Kelman, a graduate
of Harvard Law School, said his
writing comes from an "im
petus" to express himself and
from "an enormous burst of
neurotic energy."
"If I knew the root of my writ
ing, I wouldn't need to write
it,"he added.
Kelman said he wrote his first
novel in seven weeks and re
vised it in nine. He is now
working on his second novel
and expects to finish it some
time next summer. Viewing
writing as a hobby, Kelman said
when he wants to write, he
"creates a world."
"Once I find a created world,
the writing is easy," he said.
Kelman's first novel, What
Followed was Pure Leslie, is the
diary of a younger brother writ
ing about his older sister. Kel
man described it as a "disillu
sionment" novel that is "mys
terious" in tone but not a mys
tery. His second novel centers
around two crises of a man in
his early 30s.
Herbert Lindenberger,
chairman of comparative litera
ture, has written four "scho
larly" books and expects his
first fictional work, Saul's Fall,
to be published in May.
"I started writing fiction in
college and I wrote one novel
that was never published. But
lately, my scholarly work has
been moving toward fiction.
My last book had a very playful
quality."
Describing Saul's Fall as "like
no book I've ever heard of,"
Lindenberger said it contains

as many forms of writing as he
could handle. The book is bas
ically a play but also contains
poetry and fiction. Linden
berger wrote the novel over a
two and a half year time period.
"If I write any more fiction,
I'd like to do something even
stranger," he laughed.
Spyros Andreopoulos, a sci
ence writer and director of the
news bureau for the Medical
Center, writes fiction for a dif
ferent reason. Andreopoulos,
who co-authored the novel
Heart Beat, with Eugene Dong,
a cardiovascular surgeon here,
said they wrote the novel "to
alert people to some of the
problems with using nuclear
energy in medicine."
Heart Beat is a fictional ac
count of a man with an artificial
heart powered by Plutonium
238. The novel suggests that
people would be exposed to
radiation from these patients
and that the patients them
selves would be exposed to
terrorism. The book is now
being considered as the basis

for a television movie.
Andreopoulos is now work
ing on another novel, which he
expects to finish next February,
about his experiences in
Greece during World War 11.
All four authors agreed that
finding time to write was a
serious problem. Kelman,
Guerard and Lindenberger
said they did not write when
they had teaching commit
ments and Andreopoulos said
he spent many late hours and
holidays writing. Guerard
commented that he usually
does his writings during school
breaks.
"To write, you need lots of
time when you are absolutely
free," Lindenberger agreed.
He said he does not expect to
be writing for a few years due
to his teaching commitments.
Another problem cited by all
four authors is publishing,
which Lindenberger called a
"process of rejection." His
new book is being published
by a university press because it
is a "commentary of litera

ture." He said he didn't even
try a commercial press.
Guerard said that being an
unknown writer is an obstacle
to having a book published and
added that a good agent or a
friend is important. Kelman
gives testimony to this fact,

claiming that his book was pub
lished in a "peculiar way." A
friend of his family's worked
for Saturday Review Press,
which accepted his novel.
Dong and Andreopoulos's
book was, in contrast, ac
cepted in two weeks by a New
York publisher.
"If I had fully appreciated the
rejection rate for first novels, I
might have chosen a different
vehicle," Dong said. "It was
not until recently that I learned
the publication statistics of one
publishing house â€” 2000-plus
manuscripts received and only
eight published."
All authors agreed that being
connected with Stanford had
little or no effect on the suc
cess of their writing. Kelman
predicted the only effect it
might have would be that a
"fairly large number of my stu
dents might buy the book out
of curiosity about their
teacher."
"What really counts is a good
publisher," Lindenberger con
cluded.
