## Amendments scrutinized 
### 
Besides fee assessments and the Council
of Presidents race (and senior class officers
which only juniors will vote on), students
will be faced with proposed constitutional
amendments and referenda tomorrow and
Thursday. We make the following recom
mendations:
Amendment I: 30 members, staggered elec
tions — No
This amendment would change the
number of senators to 30, eliminate all al
ternate senators and allow for election of
senators in separate elections. We urge
students to vote "no" on this amendment
and instead vote "yes" on Amendment VI,
which contains all the provisions of
Amendment I and also allows for students
to vote by districts. Districting has its prob
lems, but we feel it is a more effective and
rational means of representation. It would
force senators to be more accountable to
their specific constituents.
We also wish to point out that the senate
did not include provisions forany elections
except during Spring Quarter in Amend
ment I, and if it passes, the senate will then
be allowed to decide when to hold the
other election. Besides lacking the district
ing provisions, this amendment is poorly
constructed. Vote "no."
Amendment II: NomCom — No
This would allow for the ASSU committee
staff assistant to serve ex officio on the
Committee on Nominations and would

also institute provisions for replacing
NomCom members. Unfortunately, it
would also provide for at least one senator
to serve on NomCom. Senators have no
business on NomCom. Even if only one of
them is on it, NomCom will become more
political, not less.
Amendment III: Non-sexist language — Yes
This amendment would change the lan
guage of the ASSU Constitution to make it
non-sexist. As we have urged twice in the
past five years, please vote "yes."
Amendment IV: Fee assessment — Yes
This would allow senators to put fee as
sessment requests on the ballot based on
the number of senators at a meeting in
stead of the total senate membership. This
will allow for voters to decide on at least as
many fee assessments as they now do.
Since the approval of the requests will still
rest with voters, we recommend a "yes"
vote.
Amendment V: Enactment — Yes
This amendment simply provides for the
enactment of the other amendments. Vote
"yes."
Amendment VI: 30 members, districting —
Yes
For reasons stated under Amendment I
above, we urge a "yes" vote. Voters should
note that the ballot will include a referen
dum item on the same subject. If voters
favor districting, they must vote for this
amendment, not just the referendum.
