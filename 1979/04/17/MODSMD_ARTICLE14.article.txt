# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Pomfret, et al Unendorsed COP slate responds 
### 
The Applewhite — or CRIP
— slate, composed of Liat
Applewhite, John Pomfret,
Bambi Markel and Nathan Sar
kisian, regrets the Stanford
Daily's conservative view of
student government. By en
dorsing the Freeman slate for
the ASSU Council of Presidents
(Daily, April 13), the Daily has
in effect made a plea for the
continuation of the status quo
— for the continuation of the
ASSU as a weak, ineffective
and unrepresentative body.
The Daily's endorsement of
the Freeman slate centers on
that slate's supposed prag
matism. The Freeman slate, ac
cording to the Daily, calls for
"few proposals for entirely
new programs or radical re
forms." This is true. But it is not
pragmatic if pragmatism means
looking at the real problems
and proposing viable solu
tions. The real problem is the

nature of the ASSU. The senate
itself and the committee mem
bers it appoints through the
Nominations Committee (Nom
Com) do not represent student
interests.
The Freeman slate proposes
to make the senate reflect stu
dent opinion through the elec
tion of students by district. But,
even if senators are elected by
district, there still will be no
mechanism to obligate those
senators to return to the
people they represent and sol
icit their opinions. The
Freeman slate assumes that
elections by district and "their
efforts to foster increased un
derstanding and communica
tion between students and the
administration" will make
senators represent student in
terests. In short, the Freeman
slate calls for senators to think
differently, but it provides no
mechanism to force them to

act differently. This is idealism,
not pragmatism.
The Freeman slate, further
more, does not adequately ad
dress the issue of student rep
resentation on University
committees. NomCom, ap
pointed by the ASSU Senate,
places students on University
committees. From then on
committee members are for
the most part autonomous in
dividuals. They never have to
solicit student opinion.
A perfect example of this
dearth of representation on
the part of committee mem
bers is the Lomita Road Pro
ject.The students on the Land
and Housing Committee, con
sidering themselves to have
their fingers on the pulse of the
student body, supported this
proposal without going back to
students and soliciting their
opinions because there was
and is no mechanism requiring

them to do so.
This leaves the students at
the mercy of the committee
members acting in a vacuum.
The Freeman slate, through
"increased understanding and
communication" hopes that
committee members in this
vacuum will reflect student in
terests. This is again a call for
an attitudinal change — an
idealistic stance that calls for
change without creating a
structure for such change.
In contrast to the Freeman
slate, we propose to change
the structure of the ASSU such
that the decisions of student
representatives are deter
mined by the wishes of the
students they represent. Stu
dent committee members
must be linked directly to the
ASSU Senate whose members
in turn must systematically
consult their constituencies.
Under our system, when
major policy issues affecting
student interests are proposed
in University committees, stu
dent committee members will
take such proposals along with
the relevant information back
to the senate. Senators in turn
will be obligated to take these
proposals back to their con
stituents through dorm rep
resentatives for under
graduates and departmental
representatives for graduates.
These student groups will then
vote on the issue and represen
tatives will relay the students'
decision to their senator. The
senator will then be obligated
to vote as his or her con
stituents have voted.
The decision of the senate as
a whole will be relayed to the
committee member. The
committee member will not be
strictly bound by the senate's
decisions, however, since he
or she will likely have greater
expertise on the matter. If the
committee member votes con
trary to the wishes of the stu
dent body, this action will be
subject to the review of the Se
nate Committee on Commit
tees (Com Com). This struc
tural reform will tie committee
members and senators directly,
to the students while not ignor
ing the expertise of committee,
members.
The Daily quoted our leaflet
which stated that "the adminis
trative process is a mystery to
us all" and used that statement
to charge us with incompe
tance. The Daily has missed
our point, however. The ad--
ministrative process is and will
remain a mystery to the stu
dents as long as there is no
structure unifying the student
body in the decision-making
process. The students cannot
take part in this process unless
they themselves are unified
with their representatives and
informed.
Our structural reforms go
beyond idealistic philosophy
hoping for "increased under
standing and communica
tion." We propose to make this
communication necessary.
Who is pragmatic here? Not
the Daily. Vote for the
Applewhite slate.

slate.)
