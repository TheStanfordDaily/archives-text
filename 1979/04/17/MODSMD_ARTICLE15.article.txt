No courage
Although some of the criti
cisms of the Daily in the circu
lar entitled "Keep your Dol
lars" might be considered
valid, it is a shame that there
was no group to receive credit.
At least Daily editorial writ
ers have the courage to take
credit (or blame) for their opin
ions.
One can only conclude that
authors of the circular had
their fee assessment request
denied by the Daily. They
probably remained anonym
ous fearing identification
might detract from the credibil
ity of their criticisms.

"The shady oak; the stately
palm; the fragrant eucalyptus;
the towering redwood; old El
Palo Alto: These are the Stan
ford Trees, enduring symbols
of a great Western university."
If you were present and sen
tient at some recent football
games, you may have heard the
band announcer (me) mumble
such words as part of the pre
game obsequies, just before
the Incomparables began to
perform their usual depreda
tions. The message was a
crassly fashioned plug for the
views of one faction in the
mascot controversy. The time
has come to reiterate those
views, with equal crassitude
and in somewhat greater de
tail.
The partisans of the griffin
gryphon have ably shown that
their candidate is noble, pow
erful and replete with heraldic
and mythological significance.
That's precisely the point. The
griffin-gryphon would present
an appropriate image for an in
fant University of California at
Sunnyvale, starting from
scratch with fresh paint on
stucco buildings and no tradi
tions of its own. Stanford, as a
going operation, doesn't have
to reach for that kind of new
minted dignity.
The alternative candidate,
the Stanford Tree, is already an
emblem of the University,
painted on the side of trucks
and embossed on all of that
stationery you bought for all
those letters you haven't writ
ten. In this semblance, it de
picts the two-trunked speci
men of Sequoia sempervirens
which provided the name and a
boundary mark for Senator
Stanford's Palo Alto Farm. As a
traditional symbol, it is thus
(execrable pun here) rooted in
historical and geographic fact.
The Tree has other meanings
as well. The selection of a
"vegetable" as a mascot would
operate as a subtle comment
on the macho orcutsy-poo im
ages chosen as totems by other
institutions.
Indiana State has its "Syca
mores." UC-lrvine has its "An
teaters." Harvard College has
its "Johns." Will Stanford join
this motley company? Will you
settle for being fierce and no
ble, or will you dare to be
obscure but great?
Vote early, vote often, vote
Trees.

No fee for Daily
Last Sunday afternoon, 15
Daily editors and staff grilled
representatives of various

campus organizations request
ing fee assessments; all or
ganizations that is, but one —
the Stanford Daily.
We will try here to analyze
the Daily's arguments for their
own three-quarter, $30,000 fee
assessment request.
First, the Daily argues that a
fee assessment is necessary to
maintain the reserve fund. The
reserve fund, however, which
represents total assets minus
total liabilities, has climbed
from $19,300 in 1975 to $128,000
in 1978. According to the
Jan. 23 issue of the
Daily, the reserve fund goal of
one-third of operating re
venues had already been
reached.
Although a reserve fund is
certainly necessary to meet un
foreseen costs of supplies and
equipment, any additions to
the presently healthy fund
would be an inefficient alloca
tion of resources. Other or
ganizations on campus re
questing fee assessments
could put that money to pro
ductive use.
Second, the Daily argues
that "the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference
between profit and loss in a
given year." The financial
statement published in
January, however, indicates
that the Daily had a net profit of
$52,400 in 1977 and $39,900 in
1978. Even without the fee as
sessment which the Daily has
received in 1977 and 1978, it
would have shown a profit of
$23,000 in two years — hardly a
desperate financial condition,
especially compared to the fi
nancial statements of the other
campus organizations request
ing fee assessment aid. Furth
ermore, Editor Mike Charlson
states that advertisements are
bringing in more revenue this
year than in any previous year,
although this rosy picture is
somewhat blemished by in
creasing paper costs.
Third, and most important,
the Daily argues that neglect of
building maintenance and
equipment purchases during
the last few years must now be
remedied. It is true that the 10
typewriters in the Daily office
are not in top condition, and
some building maintenance on
doors and chairs is required.
Putting the building in respect
able condition, however, re
quires hundreds of dollars, not
tens of thousands.
Charlson, however, argues
that the Daily needs seven
selectric IBM machines for
manuscript preparation. We
feel that IBM selectrics are a
luxury that bear no relation to
the quality of the Daily and
should not be financed from
student pocketbooks.
Speaking of luxuries,
Charlson and Associate Editor
Dan Fiduccia claim that two
thirds of the fee assessment
money has been requested so
that the Daily can purchase a
$75,000-$125,000 Video Display
Terminal (VDT) and an in
house computer for billing ad
vertising clients. The VDT is
said to be of educational value
and may cut some typesetting
expenses, but the Daily, in fact,
has not yet decided to purch
ase the system. Two of the four
editors on the review commit
tee, in fact, oppose the system,
according to Charlson. We feel
that the Daily is not justified in
asking for a fee assessment for
equipment it has not even de
cided to buy.
As for the in-house compu
ter, the Daily staff believes that

a $25,000 system would replace
the billing work that is already
being done by a San jose com
puter system at a cost of $4,500
per year. Conceivably, the
Daily could finance the purch
ase of the new machine over a
period of five years, annually
paying approximately what
they do now for the San Jose
services, without the need of
any fee assessment money.
Finally, the Daily claims that
past fee assessments have al
lowed the Daily to increase the
newspaper's size from an aver
age of 7.9 to 10 pages, and to
"run papers with smaller ad
vertising percentages." This is
not the case. First, Charlson
stated that a "six to eight-page
paper barely breaks even or
loses money" while a 10-page
paper makes money because it
can run more advertisements.
So increasing the number of
pages actually increases re
venues, rather than demand
ing more! Second, although
the percentage of space de
voted to advertisements may
have declined slightly,
Charlson states that a general
40 percent advertisement
space rule was followed last
year as well as this year. In fact,
contrary to what the Daily
printed in its pro-fee assess
ment article, no precise adver
tising percentages have been
calculated.
An analysis of the Daily's
need for a three-quarter fee as
sessment reflects a total ab
sence of reasonable justifica
tion. The assessment is not jus
tified by the reserve fund, the
profit-loss picture, equipment
needs or the maintenance of
size and quality.
The Daily is on sound finan
cial grounds compared to
the other organizations that
are requesting fee assess
ments, as demonstrated by the
fact that they were able to fi
nance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. Although an
eventual decision to obtain a
VDT system may require a fee
assessment in the future, until
then the appropriate vote on
the Daily's request is No.

Editor's note: Certainly
everyone is entitled to his opin
ion, but there are some serious
misstatements of fact above.
First off, it should be clear
that the purpose of a reserve
fund is to guard against unan
ticipated losses of revenue or
increases in expense. In other
words, it is an emergency fund,
and it is not our desire or intent
to spend the reserve fund in
order to meet extraordinary
costs of new capital equipment
here.
It is true that the fee assess
ment has generally meant the
difference between profit and
loss in a given year if all the
facts are included. For one
thing, the Daily does not just
receive an assessment from
students. An amount totaling
$14,000 per year for faculty and
staff bulk subscriptions is also
assessed. The two assessments
are linked - we get both or
neither - meaning that we are
speaking of $44,000 when we
make that claim.
Over the two years men
tioned above, we had a net in
come of $92,300, but $88,000 of
revenue came in from our as
sessments. Therefore, it is easy
to see that we would have
hardly broken even, no less
realize a $23,000 profit, had the

assessments not been levied.
That notwithstanding, we
have never said we are pre
sently in desperate financial
straits. We make no bones
about it. We are financially
sound for normal operations.
But there are literally
thousands (not hundreds) of
dollars of improvements and
required maintainence which
must be completed in the near
future. If a reliable typewriter is
not a necessity for a daily
newspaper, then what is?
It is true that the Daily has
not yet made a decision on
VDTs, but it is also true that the
Board of Directors of our cor
poration, always concerned
that Daily money is being
properly spent, directed our
staff to form a committee to be
certain that a system was in our
best interests in the long term.
While forming that committee
we purposefully looked for two
people who had a predisposi
tion against VDTs so that the
negative aspects of the idea
could be heard thoroughly, as
we feel they should before
such an expenditure, and so
the committee would not be
stacked either way.
As was stated in the interview
with Merkley and Novacek, the
Daily is presently formulating a
capital expenditures program
which will include a decision
on VDTs. If we do not antici
pate using the funds, it is likely
that we will simply ask the re
gistrar not to collect the entire
approved assessment. But
prudence dictates that before
we buy such an expensive
item, we must be certain the
money is there.
The paragraph concerning
advertising percentages is re
ally quite garbled. This is a
complex business, and it pains
me to have to go through it
here because this issue points
up the complexity of running a
$400,000-a-year corporation.
But here are the facts. This year
we have generally run smaller
ad percentage newspapers,
and the papers have been
about TO pages per issue on av
erage. It is true that we cannot
make money on six- or eight
page papers because of the
fixed costs, but the point dur
ing the interview with Merkley
and Novacek was that this year
we are more at liberty to au
thorize larger papers even if the
inches of advertising do not re
ally justify it.
For example, the choice be
tween running a 36 percent 10
page paper and a 45 percent
eight involves the same adver
tising revenues. Last year, there
would almost never be a ques
tion - we would go with the
eight because we were watch
ing costs. This year the oppo
site is true - we almost always
go with the 10 to allow for more
editorial material.
In fact, despite the claim
above, the Daily does calculate
advertising percentages on
every paper. Anyone who
wishes is welcome to see them.
The last factual item involves
the claim that we were able to
finance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. The number is
correct, but the percentage is
meaningless unless we include
dollar figures.
The 30 percent raise allowed
editorial staff members to
move from a salary well below
$1 per hour to about that level.
It can hardly be fairly implied or
stated that the Daily staff is
overpaid. In fact, the low level
of pay is a large reason our staff
is smaller and more uniform in

composition than we would
like.
Students should note that
with the assessment, the Daily
would still be only two pennies
a day. And that assumes you
don't claim the refund possi
ble. Many organizations are im
portant to Stanford, but no
other can claim that for only
two cents a day, five days a
week, it performs the service to
this community the Daily pro
vides. The Daily is a complex
organization which is not en
tirely understood even by
many with its walls, not to men
tion those outside. But we have
tried to be open. We published
our financial statements this
year. We are scrutinized in ex
penditures closely by our
Board of Directors and by in
dependent auditors. Never has
anyone claimed that one
penny of Daily funds were
being in any way misused.
Finally, it is simply ludicrous
to imply that financial stability
is the one criterion to be usee/
in making judgements about
assessments. We used several
criteria in making our judge
ments on all 17 assessments,
including our own.
Reserve funds are not made
to be spent on normal opera
tions. If they were, then it
would be logical to ask ASSU to
deplete its $350,000 in reserves
to pay for the eight assess
ments on the ballot associated
directly with that parent or
ganization.
But just as it is unreasonable
to ask ASSU to do that, so it is
unreasonable to ask the Daily
to either pay for these long
needed improvements out of
reserves or to continue to do
without them.
We would like to thank
Merkley and Novacek for ask
ing about our operations and
for having the courage to sign
their statement concerning our
organization. We certainly
must respect such a sincere
statement of views more seri
ously than those of many Daily
critics which go unsigned.

Erratic hand
TheDa//y's recommendation
on the New Directions fee as
sessment seemed to me both
narrow in its criteria and based
on a hypercritical view of New
Directions as an organization.
Students must decide for
themselves whether to support
New Directions, but they
should not do so on the basis
of supercilious and superficial
evaluations by the Daily staff.
I find the New Directions
newsletter to be of remarkably
high quality. It is informative,
concise and presents informa
tion that is not readily available
elsewhere to students. Each
issue of the newsletter focuses
on a particular set of world
problems: this year, New Di
rections has considered nuc
lear proliferation, agricultural
development in the Third
World and politics in the Mid
dle East. The choice of topics
shows good judgment, and the
lead articles have been excel
lent. *
Temptations to ignore world
affairs are great here. Perhaps
the pages of the Daily illustrate
how easily local and somewhat
parochial concerns overwhelm
the attention paid to more im
portant, but more distant,
events. Students in New Direc
tions have tried, in a responsi

ble way, to discuss world prob
lems that affect people here
and that we may be able to do
something about. Such efforts
should in my view be sup
ported, not dismissed with a
superficial wave of the Daily's
rather erratic editorial hand.

No on II
We strongly object to certain
provisions in Constitutional
Amendment 11, and urge its
defeat at the polls Wednesday
and Thursday.
The Nominations Commit
tee is a non-political body,
charged with nominating stu
dents to the university commit
tee system, on the basis of
merit alone. We fear that if a
member of the ASSU Senate is
automatically granted a seat on
that committee, its non
political nature will change.
The senate has shown itself to
be almost wholly concerned
with politics in the past; this
bent cannot fail to show up in
the Nom Corn's work in the fu
ture if this amendment passes.
Because no senator is pre
vented from applying to the
Nom Com, because the senate
confirms all appointments to
the Nom Com, and because
the senate has already set up a
review Committee on Commit
tees to monitor committee ac
tivities, we see no useful pur
pose in giving the senate one
seat on the Nom Com to play
with.
If this measure passes, the
senate risks the resignation of
one or more Nom Com mem
bers, because the Nom Com
may become no more than an
extension of the senate. Pro
tect the non-political nature of
the Nom Com. Vote no on
Constitutional Amendment 11.

feel that IBM selectrics are a

Speaking of luxuries,
Charlson and Associate Editor
Dan Fiduccia claim that two
thirds of the fee assessment

that the Daily can purchase a

being in any way misused.
Finally, it is simply ludicrous
to imply that financial stability
is the one criterion to be usee/
in making judgements about
assessments. We used several
criteria in making our judge
ments on all 17 assessments,
including our own.
Reserve funds are not made
to be spent on normal opera
tions. If they were, then it
would be logical to ask ASSU to
deplete its $350,000 in reserves
to pay for the eight assess
ments on the ballot associated
directly with that parent or
ganization.
But just as it is unreasonable
to ask ASSU to do that, so it is
unreasonable to ask the Daily
to either pay for these long
needed improvements out of
reserves or to continue to do
without them.
We would like to thank
Merkley and Novacek for ask
ing about our operations and
for having the courage to sign
their statement concerning our
organization. We certainly
must respect such a sincere
statement of views more seri
ously than those of many Daily
critics which go unsigned.

Erratic hand
TheDa//y's recommendation
on the New Directions fee as
sessment seemed to me both
narrow in its criteria and based
on a hypercritical view of New
Directions as an organization.
Students must decide for
themselves whether to support
New Directions, but they
should not do so on the basis
of supercilious and superficial
evaluations by the Daily staff.
I find the New Directions
newsletter to be of remarkably
high quality. It is informative,
concise and presents informa
tion that is not readily available
elsewhere to students. Each
issue of the newsletter focuses
on a particular set of world
problems: this year, New Di
rections has considered nuc
lear proliferation, agricultural
development in the Third
World and politics in the Mid
dle East. The choice of topics
shows good judgment, and the
lead articles have been excel
lent. *
Temptations to ignore world
affairs are great here. Perhaps
the pages of the Daily illustrate
how easily local and somewhat
parochial concerns overwhelm
the attention paid to more im
portant, but more distant,
events. Students in New Direc
tions have tried, in a responsi

ble way, to discuss world prob
lems that affect people here
and that we may be able to do
something about. Such efforts
should in my view be sup
ported, not dismissed with a
superficial wave of the Daily's
rather erratic editorial hand.

The Nominations Commit

The senate has shown itself to
be almost wholly concerned
with politics in the past; this
bent cannot fail to show up in
the Nom Corn's work in the fu

Because no senator is pre

confirms all appointments to
the Nom Com, and because
the senate has already set up a

If this measure passes, the

No courage
Although some of the criti

valid, it is a shame that there
was no group to receive credit.
At least Daily editorial writ
ers have the courage to take
credit (or blame) for their opin
ions.
One can only conclude that
authors of the circular had
their fee assessment request
denied by the Daily. They
probably remained anonym

"The shady oak; the stately

If you were present and sen

games, you may have heard the
band announcer (me) mumble
such words as part of the pre

the Incomparables began to
perform their usual depreda

crassly fashioned plug for the
views of one faction in the
mascot controversy. The time
has come to reiterate those
views, with equal crassitude
and in somewhat greater de

The partisans of the griffin
gryphon have ably shown that
their candidate is noble, pow

That's precisely the point. The
griffin-gryphon would present
an appropriate image for an in

Sunnyvale, starting from
scratch with fresh paint on
stucco buildings and no tradi

to reach for that kind of new

The alternative candidate,
the Stanford Tree, is already an
emblem of the University,
painted on the side of trucks

Stanford's Palo Alto Farm. As a
traditional symbol, it is thus
(execrable pun here) rooted in
historical and geographic fact.
The Tree has other meanings
as well. The selection of a
"vegetable" as a mascot would
operate as a subtle comment
on the macho orcutsy-poo im

institutions.
Indiana State has its "Syca

No fee for Daily
Last Sunday afternoon, 15
Daily editors and staff grilled
representatives of various

campus organizations request
ing fee assessments; all or
ganizations that is, but one —
the Stanford Daily.
We will try here to analyze
the Daily's arguments for their
own three-quarter, $30,000 fee
assessment request.
First, the Daily argues that a
fee assessment is necessary to
maintain the reserve fund. The
reserve fund, however, which
represents total assets minus
total liabilities, has climbed
from $19,300 in 1975 to $128,000
in 1978. According to the
Jan. 23 issue of the
Daily, the reserve fund goal of
one-third of operating re
venues had already been
reached.
Although a reserve fund is
certainly necessary to meet un
foreseen costs of supplies and
equipment, any additions to
the presently healthy fund
would be an inefficient alloca
tion of resources. Other or
ganizations on campus re
questing fee assessments
could put that money to pro
ductive use.
Second, the Daily argues
that "the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference
between profit and loss in a
given year." The financial
statement published in
January, however, indicates
that the Daily had a net profit of
$52,400 in 1977 and $39,900 in
1978. Even without the fee as
sessment which the Daily has
received in 1977 and 1978, it
would have shown a profit of
$23,000 in two years — hardly a
desperate financial condition,
especially compared to the fi
nancial statements of the other
campus organizations request
ing fee assessment aid. Furth
ermore, Editor Mike Charlson
states that advertisements are
bringing in more revenue this
year than in any previous year,
although this rosy picture is
somewhat blemished by in
creasing paper costs.
Third, and most important,
the Daily argues that neglect of
building maintenance and
equipment purchases during
the last few years must now be
remedied. It is true that the 10
typewriters in the Daily office
are not in top condition, and
some building maintenance on
doors and chairs is required.
Putting the building in respect
able condition, however, re
quires hundreds of dollars, not
tens of thousands.
Charlson, however, argues
that the Daily needs seven
selectric IBM machines for
manuscript preparation. We
feel that IBM selectrics are a
luxury that bear no relation to
the quality of the Daily and
should not be financed from
student pocketbooks.
Speaking of luxuries,
Charlson and Associate Editor
Dan Fiduccia claim that two
thirds of the fee assessment
money has been requested so
that the Daily can purchase a
$75,000-$125,000 Video Display
Terminal (VDT) and an in
house computer for billing ad
vertising clients. The VDT is
said to be of educational value
and may cut some typesetting
expenses, but the Daily, in fact,
has not yet decided to purch
ase the system. Two of the four
editors on the review commit
tee, in fact, oppose the system,
according to Charlson. We feel
that the Daily is not justified in
asking for a fee assessment for
equipment it has not even de
cided to buy.
As for the in-house compu
ter, the Daily staff believes that

a $25,000 system would replace
the billing work that is already
being done by a San jose com
puter system at a cost of $4,500
per year. Conceivably, the
Daily could finance the purch
ase of the new machine over a
period of five years, annually
paying approximately what
they do now for the San Jose
services, without the need of
any fee assessment money.
Finally, the Daily claims that
past fee assessments have al
lowed the Daily to increase the
newspaper's size from an aver
age of 7.9 to 10 pages, and to
"run papers with smaller ad
vertising percentages." This is
not the case. First, Charlson
stated that a "six to eight-page
paper barely breaks even or
loses money" while a 10-page
paper makes money because it
can run more advertisements.
So increasing the number of
pages actually increases re
venues, rather than demand
ing more! Second, although
the percentage of space de
voted to advertisements may
have declined slightly,
Charlson states that a general
40 percent advertisement
space rule was followed last
year as well as this year. In fact,
contrary to what the Daily
printed in its pro-fee assess
ment article, no precise adver
tising percentages have been
calculated.
An analysis of the Daily's
need for a three-quarter fee as
sessment reflects a total ab
sence of reasonable justifica
tion. The assessment is not jus
tified by the reserve fund, the
profit-loss picture, equipment
needs or the maintenance of
size and quality.
The Daily is on sound finan
cial grounds compared to
the other organizations that
are requesting fee assess
ments, as demonstrated by the
fact that they were able to fi
nance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. Although an
eventual decision to obtain a
VDT system may require a fee
assessment in the future, until
then the appropriate vote on
the Daily's request is No.

Editor's note: Certainly
everyone is entitled to his opin
ion, but there are some serious
misstatements of fact above.
First off, it should be clear
that the purpose of a reserve
fund is to guard against unan
ticipated losses of revenue or
increases in expense. In other
words, it is an emergency fund,
and it is not our desire or intent
to spend the reserve fund in
order to meet extraordinary
costs of new capital equipment
here.
It is true that the fee assess
ment has generally meant the
difference between profit and
loss in a given year if all the
facts are included. For one
thing, the Daily does not just
receive an assessment from
students. An amount totaling
$14,000 per year for faculty and
staff bulk subscriptions is also
assessed. The two assessments
are linked - we get both or
neither - meaning that we are
speaking of $44,000 when we
make that claim.
Over the two years men
tioned above, we had a net in
come of $92,300, but $88,000 of
revenue came in from our as
sessments. Therefore, it is easy
to see that we would have
hardly broken even, no less
realize a $23,000 profit, had the

assessments not been levied.
That notwithstanding, we
have never said we are pre
sently in desperate financial
straits. We make no bones
about it. We are financially
sound for normal operations.
But there are literally
thousands (not hundreds) of
dollars of improvements and
required maintainence which
must be completed in the near
future. If a reliable typewriter is
not a necessity for a daily
newspaper, then what is?
It is true that the Daily has
not yet made a decision on
VDTs, but it is also true that the
Board of Directors of our cor
poration, always concerned
that Daily money is being
properly spent, directed our
staff to form a committee to be
certain that a system was in our
best interests in the long term.
While forming that committee
we purposefully looked for two
people who had a predisposi
tion against VDTs so that the
negative aspects of the idea
could be heard thoroughly, as
we feel they should before
such an expenditure, and so
the committee would not be
stacked either way.
As was stated in the interview
with Merkley and Novacek, the
Daily is presently formulating a
capital expenditures program
which will include a decision
on VDTs. If we do not antici
pate using the funds, it is likely
that we will simply ask the re
gistrar not to collect the entire
approved assessment. But
prudence dictates that before
we buy such an expensive
item, we must be certain the
money is there.
The paragraph concerning
advertising percentages is re
ally quite garbled. This is a
complex business, and it pains
me to have to go through it
here because this issue points
up the complexity of running a
$400,000-a-year corporation.
But here are the facts. This year
we have generally run smaller
ad percentage newspapers,
and the papers have been
about TO pages per issue on av
erage. It is true that we cannot
make money on six- or eight
page papers because of the
fixed costs, but the point dur
ing the interview with Merkley
and Novacek was that this year
we are more at liberty to au
thorize larger papers even if the
inches of advertising do not re
ally justify it.
For example, the choice be
tween running a 36 percent 10
page paper and a 45 percent
eight involves the same adver
tising revenues. Last year, there
would almost never be a ques
tion - we would go with the
eight because we were watch
ing costs. This year the oppo
site is true - we almost always
go with the 10 to allow for more
editorial material.
In fact, despite the claim
above, the Daily does calculate
advertising percentages on
every paper. Anyone who
wishes is welcome to see them.
The last factual item involves
the claim that we were able to
finance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. The number is
correct, but the percentage is
meaningless unless we include
dollar figures.
The 30 percent raise allowed
editorial staff members to
move from a salary well below
$1 per hour to about that level.
It can hardly be fairly implied or
stated that the Daily staff is
overpaid. In fact, the low level
of pay is a large reason our staff
is smaller and more uniform in

composition than we would
like.
Students should note that
with the assessment, the Daily
would still be only two pennies
a day. And that assumes you
don't claim the refund possi
ble. Many organizations are im
portant to Stanford, but no
other can claim that for only
two cents a day, five days a
week, it performs the service to
this community the Daily pro
vides. The Daily is a complex
organization which is not en
tirely understood even by
many with its walls, not to men
tion those outside. But we have
tried to be open. We published
our financial statements this
year. We are scrutinized in ex
penditures closely by our
Board of Directors and by in
dependent auditors. Never has
anyone claimed that one
penny of Daily funds were
being in any way misused.
Finally, it is simply ludicrous
to imply that financial stability
is the one criterion to be usee/
in making judgements about
assessments. We used several
criteria in making our judge
ments on all 17 assessments,
including our own.
Reserve funds are not made

tions. If they were, then it
would be logical to ask ASSU to
deplete its $350,000 in reserves
to pay for the eight assess
ments on the ballot associated
directly with that parent or
ganization.
But just as it is unreasonable
to ask ASSU to do that, so it is
unreasonable to ask the Daily
to either pay for these long
needed improvements out of
reserves or to continue to do
without them.
We would like to thank
Merkley and Novacek for ask
ing about our operations and
for having the courage to sign
their statement concerning our
organization. We certainly
must respect such a sincere
statement of views more seri
ously than those of many Daily
critics which go unsigned.

Putting the building in respect

manuscript preparation. We
feel that IBM selectrics are a

should not be financed from

Speaking of luxuries,
Charlson and Associate Editor
Dan Fiduccia claim that two
thirds of the fee assessment
money has been requested so
that the Daily can purchase a
$75,000-$125,000 Video Display

Finally, the Daily claims that
past fee assessments have al
lowed the Daily to increase the
newspaper's size from an aver
age of 7.9 to 10 pages, and to
"run papers with smaller ad

not the case. First, Charlson
stated that a "six to eight-page
paper barely breaks even or
loses money" while a 10-page
paper makes money because it
can run more advertisements.
So increasing the number of
pages actually increases re
venues, rather than demand

sound for normal operations.
But there are literally
thousands (not hundreds) of
dollars of improvements and
required maintainence which
must be completed in the near
future. If a reliable typewriter is
not a necessity for a daily
newspaper, then what is?
It is true that the Daily has
not yet made a decision on
VDTs, but it is also true that the
Board of Directors of our cor
poration, always concerned
that Daily money is being
properly spent, directed our
staff to form a committee to be
certain that a system was in our
best interests in the long term.
While forming that committee
we purposefully looked for two
people who had a predisposi
tion against VDTs so that the
negative aspects of the idea
could be heard thoroughly, as
we feel they should before
such an expenditure, and so
the committee would not be
stacked either way.
As was stated in the interview
with Merkley and Novacek, the
Daily is presently formulating a
capital expenditures program
which will include a decision
on VDTs. If we do not antici
pate using the funds, it is likely
that we will simply ask the re
gistrar not to collect the entire
approved assessment. But
prudence dictates that before
we buy such an expensive
item, we must be certain the
money is there.
The paragraph concerning
advertising percentages is re
ally quite garbled. This is a
complex business, and it pains
me to have to go through it
here because this issue points
up the complexity of running a
$400,000-a-year corporation.
But here are the facts. This year
we have generally run smaller
ad percentage newspapers,
and the papers have been
about TO pages per issue on av
erage. It is true that we cannot
make money on six- or eight
page papers because of the
fixed costs, but the point dur
ing the interview with Merkley
and Novacek was that this year
we are more at liberty to au
thorize larger papers even if the
inches of advertising do not re
ally justify it.
For example, the choice be
tween running a 36 percent 10
page paper and a 45 percent
eight involves the same adver
tising revenues. Last year, there
would almost never be a ques
tion - we would go with the
eight because we were watch
ing costs. This year the oppo
site is true - we almost always
go with the 10 to allow for more
editorial material.
In fact, despite the claim
above, the Daily does calculate
advertising percentages on
every paper. Anyone who
wishes is welcome to see them.
The last factual item involves
the claim that we were able to
finance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. The number is
correct, but the percentage is
meaningless unless we include
dollar figures.
The 30 percent raise allowed
editorial staff members to
move from a salary well below
$1 per hour to about that level.
It can hardly be fairly implied or
stated that the Daily staff is
overpaid. In fact, the low level
of pay is a large reason our staff
is smaller and more uniform in

composition than we would
like.
Students should note that
with the assessment, the Daily
would still be only two pennies
a day. And that assumes you
don't claim the refund possi
ble. Many organizations are im
portant to Stanford, but no
other can claim that for only
two cents a day, five days a
week, it performs the service to
this community the Daily pro
vides. The Daily is a complex
organization which is not en
tirely understood even by
many with its walls, not to men
tion those outside. But we have
tried to be open. We published
our financial statements this
year. We are scrutinized in ex
penditures closely by our
Board of Directors and by in
dependent auditors. Never has
anyone claimed that one
penny of Daily funds were
being in any way misused.
Finally, it is simply ludicrous
to imply that financial stability
is the one criterion to be usee/
in making judgements about
assessments. We used several
criteria in making our judge
ments on all 17 assessments,
including our own.
Reserve funds are not made
to be spent on normal opera
tions. If they were, then it
would be logical to ask ASSU to
deplete its $350,000 in reserves
to pay for the eight assess
ments on the ballot associated
directly with that parent or
ganization.
But just as it is unreasonable
to ask ASSU to do that, so it is
unreasonable to ask the Daily
to either pay for these long
needed improvements out of
reserves or to continue to do
without them.
We would like to thank
Merkley and Novacek for ask
ing about our operations and
for having the courage to sign
their statement concerning our
organization. We certainly
must respect such a sincere
statement of views more seri
ously than those of many Daily
critics which go unsigned.

Erratic hand
TheDa//y's recommendation
on the New Directions fee as
sessment seemed to me both
narrow in its criteria and based
on a hypercritical view of New
Directions as an organization.
Students must decide for
themselves whether to support
New Directions, but they
should not do so on the basis
of supercilious and superficial
evaluations by the Daily staff.
I find the New Directions
newsletter to be of remarkably
high quality. It is informative,
concise and presents informa
tion that is not readily available
elsewhere to students. Each
issue of the newsletter focuses
on a particular set of world
problems: this year, New Di
rections has considered nuc
lear proliferation, agricultural
development in the Third
World and politics in the Mid
dle East. The choice of topics
shows good judgment, and the
lead articles have been excel
lent. *
Temptations to ignore world
affairs are great here. Perhaps
the pages of the Daily illustrate
how easily local and somewhat
parochial concerns overwhelm
the attention paid to more im
portant, but more distant,
events. Students in New Direc
tions have tried, in a responsi

ble way, to discuss world prob
lems that affect people here
and that we may be able to do
something about. Such efforts
should in my view be sup
ported, not dismissed with a
superficial wave of the Daily's
rather erratic editorial hand.

Although some of the criti

At least Daily editorial writ

The partisans of the griffin

That's precisely the point. The

No fee for Daily
Last Sunday afternoon, 15
Daily editors and staff grilled
representatives of various

campus organizations request
ing fee assessments; all or
ganizations that is, but one —
the Stanford Daily.
We will try here to analyze
the Daily's arguments for their
own three-quarter, $30,000 fee
assessment request.
First, the Daily argues that a
fee assessment is necessary to
maintain the reserve fund. The
reserve fund, however, which
represents total assets minus
total liabilities, has climbed
from $19,300 in 1975 to $128,000
in 1978. According to the
Jan. 23 issue of the
Daily, the reserve fund goal of
one-third of operating re
venues had already been
reached.
Although a reserve fund is
certainly necessary to meet un
foreseen costs of supplies and
equipment, any additions to
the presently healthy fund
would be an inefficient alloca
tion of resources. Other or
ganizations on campus re
questing fee assessments
could put that money to pro
ductive use.
Second, the Daily argues
that "the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference
between profit and loss in a
given year." The financial
statement published in
January, however, indicates
that the Daily had a net profit of
$52,400 in 1977 and $39,900 in
1978. Even without the fee as
sessment which the Daily has
received in 1977 and 1978, it
would have shown a profit of
$23,000 in two years — hardly a
desperate financial condition,
especially compared to the fi
nancial statements of the other
campus organizations request
ing fee assessment aid. Furth
ermore, Editor Mike Charlson
states that advertisements are
bringing in more revenue this
year than in any previous year,
although this rosy picture is
somewhat blemished by in
creasing paper costs.
Third, and most important,
the Daily argues that neglect of
building maintenance and
equipment purchases during
the last few years must now be
remedied. It is true that the 10
typewriters in the Daily office
are not in top condition, and
some building maintenance on
doors and chairs is required.
Putting the building in respect
able condition, however, re
quires hundreds of dollars, not
tens of thousands.
Charlson, however, argues
that the Daily needs seven
selectric IBM machines for
manuscript preparation. We
feel that IBM selectrics are a
luxury that bear no relation to
the quality of the Daily and
should not be financed from
student pocketbooks.
Speaking of luxuries,
Charlson and Associate Editor
Dan Fiduccia claim that two
thirds of the fee assessment
money has been requested so
that the Daily can purchase a
$75,000-$125,000 Video Display
Terminal (VDT) and an in
house computer for billing ad
vertising clients. The VDT is
said to be of educational value
and may cut some typesetting
expenses, but the Daily, in fact,
has not yet decided to purch
ase the system. Two of the four
editors on the review commit
tee, in fact, oppose the system,
according to Charlson. We feel
that the Daily is not justified in
asking for a fee assessment for
equipment it has not even de
cided to buy.
As for the in-house compu
ter, the Daily staff believes that

a $25,000 system would replace
the billing work that is already
being done by a San jose com
puter system at a cost of $4,500
per year. Conceivably, the
Daily could finance the purch
ase of the new machine over a
period of five years, annually
paying approximately what
they do now for the San Jose
services, without the need of
any fee assessment money.
Finally, the Daily claims that
past fee assessments have al
lowed the Daily to increase the
newspaper's size from an aver
age of 7.9 to 10 pages, and to
"run papers with smaller ad
vertising percentages." This is
not the case. First, Charlson
stated that a "six to eight-page
paper barely breaks even or
loses money" while a 10-page
paper makes money because it
can run more advertisements.
So increasing the number of
pages actually increases re
venues, rather than demand
ing more! Second, although
the percentage of space de
voted to advertisements may
have declined slightly,
Charlson states that a general
40 percent advertisement
space rule was followed last
year as well as this year. In fact,
contrary to what the Daily
printed in its pro-fee assess
ment article, no precise adver
tising percentages have been
calculated.
An analysis of the Daily's
need for a three-quarter fee as
sessment reflects a total ab
sence of reasonable justifica
tion. The assessment is not jus
tified by the reserve fund, the
profit-loss picture, equipment
needs or the maintenance of
size and quality.
The Daily is on sound finan
cial grounds compared to
the other organizations that
are requesting fee assess
ments, as demonstrated by the
fact that they were able to fi
nance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. Although an
eventual decision to obtain a
VDT system may require a fee
assessment in the future, until
then the appropriate vote on
the Daily's request is No.

Editor's note: Certainly
everyone is entitled to his opin
ion, but there are some serious
misstatements of fact above.
First off, it should be clear
that the purpose of a reserve
fund is to guard against unan
ticipated losses of revenue or
increases in expense. In other
words, it is an emergency fund,
and it is not our desire or intent
to spend the reserve fund in
order to meet extraordinary
costs of new capital equipment
here.
It is true that the fee assess
ment has generally meant the
difference between profit and
loss in a given year if all the
facts are included. For one
thing, the Daily does not just
receive an assessment from
students. An amount totaling
$14,000 per year for faculty and
staff bulk subscriptions is also
assessed. The two assessments
are linked - we get both or
neither - meaning that we are
speaking of $44,000 when we
make that claim.
Over the two years men
tioned above, we had a net in
come of $92,300, but $88,000 of
revenue came in from our as
sessments. Therefore, it is easy
to see that we would have
hardly broken even, no less
realize a $23,000 profit, had the

assessments not been levied.
That notwithstanding, we
have never said we are pre
sently in desperate financial
straits. We make no bones
about it. We are financially
sound for normal operations.
But there are literally
thousands (not hundreds) of
dollars of improvements and
required maintainence which
must be completed in the near
future. If a reliable typewriter is
not a necessity for a daily
newspaper, then what is?
It is true that the Daily has
not yet made a decision on
VDTs, but it is also true that the

has not yet decided to purch
ase the system. Two of the four
editors on the review commit
tee, in fact, oppose the system,
according to Charlson. We feel
that the Daily is not justified in
asking for a fee assessment for
equipment it has not even de
cided to buy.
As for the in-house compu
ter, the Daily staff believes that

a $25,000 system would replace
the billing work that is already
being done by a San jose com
puter system at a cost of $4,500
per year. Conceivably, the
Daily could finance the purch
ase of the new machine over a
period of five years, annually
paying approximately what
they do now for the San Jose
services, without the need of
any fee assessment money.
Finally, the Daily claims that
past fee assessments have al
lowed the Daily to increase the
newspaper's size from an aver
age of 7.9 to 10 pages, and to
"run papers with smaller ad
vertising percentages." This is
not the case. First, Charlson
stated that a "six to eight-page
paper barely breaks even or
loses money" while a 10-page
paper makes money because it
can run more advertisements.
So increasing the number of
pages actually increases re
venues, rather than demand
ing more! Second, although
the percentage of space de
voted to advertisements may
have declined slightly,
Charlson states that a general
40 percent advertisement
space rule was followed last
year as well as this year. In fact,
contrary to what the Daily
printed in its pro-fee assess
ment article, no precise adver
tising percentages have been
calculated.
An analysis of the Daily's
need for a three-quarter fee as
sessment reflects a total ab
sence of reasonable justifica
tion. The assessment is not jus
tified by the reserve fund, the
profit-loss picture, equipment
needs or the maintenance of
size and quality.
The Daily is on sound finan
cial grounds compared to
the other organizations that
are requesting fee assess
ments, as demonstrated by the
fact that they were able to fi
nance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. Although an
eventual decision to obtain a
VDT system may require a fee
assessment in the future, until
then the appropriate vote on
the Daily's request is No.

Editor's note: Certainly
everyone is entitled to his opin
ion, but there are some serious
misstatements of fact above.
First off, it should be clear
that the purpose of a reserve
fund is to guard against unan
ticipated losses of revenue or
increases in expense. In other
words, it is an emergency fund,
and it is not our desire or intent
to spend the reserve fund in
order to meet extraordinary
costs of new capital equipment
here.
It is true that the fee assess
ment has generally meant the
difference between profit and
loss in a given year if all the
facts are included. For one
thing, the Daily does not just
receive an assessment from
students. An amount totaling
$14,000 per year for faculty and
staff bulk subscriptions is also
assessed. The two assessments
are linked - we get both or
neither - meaning that we are
speaking of $44,000 when we
make that claim.
Over the two years men
tioned above, we had a net in
come of $92,300, but $88,000 of
revenue came in from our as
sessments. Therefore, it is easy
to see that we would have
hardly broken even, no less
realize a $23,000 profit, had the

assessments not been levied.
That notwithstanding, we
have never said we are pre
sently in desperate financial
straits. We make no bones
about it. We are financially
sound for normal operations.
But there are literally
thousands (not hundreds) of
dollars of improvements and
required maintainence which
must be completed in the near
future. If a reliable typewriter is
not a necessity for a daily
newspaper, then what is?
It is true that the Daily has
not yet made a decision on
VDTs, but it is also true that the
Board of Directors of our cor
poration, always concerned
that Daily money is being
properly spent, directed our
staff to form a committee to be
certain that a system was in our
best interests in the long term.
While forming that committee
we purposefully looked for two
people who had a predisposi
tion against VDTs so that the
negative aspects of the idea
could be heard thoroughly, as
we feel they should before
such an expenditure, and so
the committee would not be
stacked either way.
As was stated in the interview
with Merkley and Novacek, the
Daily is presently formulating a
capital expenditures program
which will include a decision
on VDTs. If we do not antici
pate using the funds, it is likely
that we will simply ask the re
gistrar not to collect the entire
approved assessment. But
prudence dictates that before
we buy such an expensive
item, we must be certain the
money is there.
The paragraph concerning
advertising percentages is re
ally quite garbled. This is a
complex business, and it pains
me to have to go through it
here because this issue points
up the complexity of running a
$400,000-a-year corporation.
But here are the facts. This year
we have generally run smaller
ad percentage newspapers,
and the papers have been
about TO pages per issue on av
erage. It is true that we cannot
make money on six- or eight
page papers because of the
fixed costs, but the point dur
ing the interview with Merkley
and Novacek was that this year
we are more at liberty to au
thorize larger papers even if the
inches of advertising do not re
ally justify it.
For example, the choice be
tween running a 36 percent 10
page paper and a 45 percent
eight involves the same adver
tising revenues. Last year, there
would almost never be a ques
tion - we would go with the
eight because we were watch
ing costs. This year the oppo
site is true - we almost always
go with the 10 to allow for more
editorial material.
In fact, despite the claim
above, the Daily does calculate
advertising percentages on
every paper. Anyone who
wishes is welcome to see them.
The last factual item involves
the claim that we were able to
finance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. The number is
correct, but the percentage is
meaningless unless we include
dollar figures.
The 30 percent raise allowed
editorial staff members to
move from a salary well below
$1 per hour to about that level.
It can hardly be fairly implied or
stated that the Daily staff is
overpaid. In fact, the low level
of pay is a large reason our staff
is smaller and more uniform in

composition than we would
like.
Students should note that
with the assessment, the Daily
would still be only two pennies
a day. And that assumes you
don't claim the refund possi
ble. Many organizations are im
portant to Stanford, but no
other can claim that for only
two cents a day, five days a
week, it performs the service to
this community the Daily pro
vides. The Daily is a complex
organization which is not en
tirely understood even by
many with its walls, not to men
tion those outside. But we have
tried to be open. We published
our financial statements this
year. We are scrutinized in ex
penditures closely by our
Board of Directors and by in
dependent auditors. Never has
anyone claimed that one
penny of Daily funds were
being in any way misused.
Finally, it is simply ludicrous
to imply that financial stability
is the one criterion to be usee/
in making judgements about
assessments. We used several
criteria in making our judge
ments on all 17 assessments,
including our own.
Reserve funds are not made
to be spent on normal opera
tions. If they were, then it
would be logical to ask ASSU to
deplete its $350,000 in reserves
to pay for the eight assess
ments on the ballot associated
directly with that parent or
ganization.
But just as it is unreasonable
to ask ASSU to do that, so it is
unreasonable to ask the Daily
to either pay for these long
needed improvements out of
reserves or to continue to do
without them.
We would like to thank
Merkley and Novacek for ask
ing about our operations and
for having the courage to sign
their statement concerning our
organization. We certainly
must respect such a sincere
statement of views more seri
ously than those of many Daily
critics which go unsigned.

Erratic hand
TheDa//y's recommendation
on the New Directions fee as
sessment seemed to me both
narrow in its criteria and based
on a hypercritical view of New
Directions as an organization.
Students must decide for
themselves whether to support
New Directions, but they
should not do so on the basis
of supercilious and superficial
evaluations by the Daily staff.
I find the New Directions
newsletter to be of remarkably
high quality. It is informative,
concise and presents informa
tion that is not readily available
elsewhere to students. Each
issue of the newsletter focuses
on a particular set of world
problems: this year, New Di
rections has considered nuc
lear proliferation, agricultural
development in the Third
World and politics in the Mid
dle East. The choice of topics
shows good judgment, and the
lead articles have been excel
lent. *
Temptations to ignore world
affairs are great here. Perhaps
the pages of the Daily illustrate
how easily local and somewhat
parochial concerns overwhelm
the attention paid to more im
portant, but more distant,
events. Students in New Direc
tions have tried, in a responsi

ble way, to discuss world prob
lems that affect people here
and that we may be able to do
something about. Such efforts
should in my view be sup
ported, not dismissed with a
superficial wave of the Daily's
rather erratic editorial hand.

At least Daily editorial writ

"The shady oak; the stately

If you were present and sen

games, you may have heard the

such words as part of the pre

the Incomparables began to
perform their usual depreda

crassly fashioned plug for the
views of one faction in the
mascot controversy. The time
has come to reiterate those
views, with equal crassitude
and in somewhat greater de

The partisans of the griffin

their candidate is noble, pow

That's precisely the point. The
griffin-gryphon would present
an appropriate image for an in

Sunnyvale, starting from
scratch with fresh paint on
stucco buildings and no tradi

to reach for that kind of new

The alternative candidate,
the Stanford Tree, is already an

painted on the side of trucks

Stanford's Palo Alto Farm. As a
traditional symbol, it is thus
(execrable pun here) rooted in
historical and geographic fact.
The Tree has other meanings
as well. The selection of a
"vegetable" as a mascot would
operate as a subtle comment
on the macho orcutsy-poo im

institutions.
Indiana State has its "Syca

obscure but great?
Vote early, vote often, vote

No fee for Daily
Last Sunday afternoon, 15
Daily editors and staff grilled
representatives of various

campus organizations request
ing fee assessments; all or
ganizations that is, but one —
the Stanford Daily.
We will try here to analyze
the Daily's arguments for their
own three-quarter, $30,000 fee
assessment request.
First, the Daily argues that a
fee assessment is necessary to
maintain the reserve fund. The
reserve fund, however, which
represents total assets minus
total liabilities, has climbed
from $19,300 in 1975 to $128,000
in 1978. According to the
Jan. 23 issue of the
Daily, the reserve fund goal of
one-third of operating re
venues had already been
reached.
Although a reserve fund is
certainly necessary to meet un
foreseen costs of supplies and
equipment, any additions to
the presently healthy fund
would be an inefficient alloca
tion of resources. Other or
ganizations on campus re
questing fee assessments
could put that money to pro
ductive use.
Second, the Daily argues
that "the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference
between profit and loss in a
given year." The financial
statement published in
January, however, indicates
that the Daily had a net profit of
$52,400 in 1977 and $39,900 in
1978. Even without the fee as
sessment which the Daily has
received in 1977 and 1978, it
would have shown a profit of
$23,000 in two years — hardly a
desperate financial condition,
especially compared to the fi
nancial statements of the other
campus organizations request
ing fee assessment aid. Furth
ermore, Editor Mike Charlson
states that advertisements are
bringing in more revenue this
year than in any previous year,
although this rosy picture is
somewhat blemished by in
creasing paper costs.
Third, and most important,
the Daily argues that neglect of
building maintenance and
equipment purchases during
the last few years must now be
remedied. It is true that the 10
typewriters in the Daily office
are not in top condition, and
some building maintenance on
doors and chairs is required.
Putting the building in respect
able condition, however, re
quires hundreds of dollars, not
tens of thousands.
Charlson, however, argues
that the Daily needs seven
selectric IBM machines for
manuscript preparation. We
feel that IBM selectrics are a
luxury that bear no relation to
the quality of the Daily and
should not be financed from
student pocketbooks.
Speaking of luxuries,
Charlson and Associate Editor
Dan Fiduccia claim that two
thirds of the fee assessment
money has been requested so
that the Daily can purchase a
$75,000-$125,000 Video Display
Terminal (VDT) and an in
house computer for billing ad
vertising clients. The VDT is
said to be of educational value
and may cut some typesetting
expenses, but the Daily, in fact,
has not yet decided to purch
ase the system. Two of the four
editors on the review commit
tee, in fact, oppose the system,
according to Charlson. We feel
that the Daily is not justified in
asking for a fee assessment for
equipment it has not even de
cided to buy.
As for the in-house compu
ter, the Daily staff believes that

a $25,000 system would replace
the billing work that is already
being done by a San jose com
puter system at a cost of $4,500
per year. Conceivably, the
Daily could finance the purch
ase of the new machine over a
period of five years, annually
paying approximately what
they do now for the San Jose
services, without the need of
any fee assessment money.
Finally, the Daily claims that
past fee assessments have al
lowed the Daily to increase the
newspaper's size from an aver
age of 7.9 to 10 pages, and to
"run papers with smaller ad
vertising percentages." This is
not the case. First, Charlson
stated that a "six to eight-page
paper barely breaks even or
loses money" while a 10-page
paper makes money because it
can run more advertisements.
So increasing the number of
pages actually increases re
venues, rather than demand
ing more! Second, although
the percentage of space de
voted to advertisements may
have declined slightly,
Charlson states that a general
40 percent advertisement
space rule was followed last
year as well as this year. In fact,
contrary to what the Daily
printed in its pro-fee assess
ment article, no precise adver
tising percentages have been
calculated.
An analysis of the Daily's
need for a three-quarter fee as
sessment reflects a total ab
sence of reasonable justifica
tion. The assessment is not jus
tified by the reserve fund, the
profit-loss picture, equipment
needs or the maintenance of
size and quality.
The Daily is on sound finan
cial grounds compared to
the other organizations that
are requesting fee assess
ments, as demonstrated by the
fact that they were able to fi
nance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. Although an
eventual decision to obtain a
VDT system may require a fee
assessment in the future, until
then the appropriate vote on
the Daily's request is No.

which provided the name and a
boundary mark for Senator
Stanford's Palo Alto Farm. As a
traditional symbol, it is thus
(execrable pun here) rooted in
historical and geographic fact.
The Tree has other meanings
as well. The selection of a
"vegetable" as a mascot would
operate as a subtle comment
on the macho orcutsy-poo im
ages chosen as totems by other
institutions.
Indiana State has its "Syca

No fee for Daily
Last Sunday afternoon, 15
Daily editors and staff grilled
representatives of various

campus organizations request
ing fee assessments; all or
ganizations that is, but one —
the Stanford Daily.
We will try here to analyze
the Daily's arguments for their
own three-quarter, $30,000 fee
assessment request.
First, the Daily argues that a
fee assessment is necessary to
maintain the reserve fund. The
reserve fund, however, which
represents total assets minus
total liabilities, has climbed
from $19,300 in 1975 to $128,000
in 1978. According to the
Jan. 23 issue of the
Daily, the reserve fund goal of
one-third of operating re
venues had already been
reached.
Although a reserve fund is
certainly necessary to meet un
foreseen costs of supplies and
equipment, any additions to
the presently healthy fund
would be an inefficient alloca
tion of resources. Other or
ganizations on campus re
questing fee assessments
could put that money to pro
ductive use.
Second, the Daily argues
that "the fee assessment has
generally meant the difference
between profit and loss in a
given year." The financial
statement published in
January, however, indicates
that the Daily had a net profit of
$52,400 in 1977 and $39,900 in
1978. Even without the fee as
sessment which the Daily has
received in 1977 and 1978, it
would have shown a profit of
$23,000 in two years — hardly a
desperate financial condition,
especially compared to the fi
nancial statements of the other
campus organizations request
ing fee assessment aid. Furth
ermore, Editor Mike Charlson
states that advertisements are
bringing in more revenue this
year than in any previous year,
although this rosy picture is
somewhat blemished by in
creasing paper costs.
Third, and most important,
the Daily argues that neglect of
building maintenance and
equipment purchases during
the last few years must now be
remedied. It is true that the 10
typewriters in the Daily office
are not in top condition, and
some building maintenance on
doors and chairs is required.
Putting the building in respect
able condition, however, re
quires hundreds of dollars, not
tens of thousands.
Charlson, however, argues
that the Daily needs seven
selectric IBM machines for
manuscript preparation. We
feel that IBM selectrics are a
luxury that bear no relation to
the quality of the Daily and
should not be financed from
student pocketbooks.
Speaking of luxuries,
Charlson and Associate Editor
Dan Fiduccia claim that two
thirds of the fee assessment
money has been requested so
that the Daily can purchase a
$75,000-$125,000 Video Display
Terminal (VDT) and an in
house computer for billing ad
vertising clients. The VDT is
said to be of educational value
and may cut some typesetting
expenses, but the Daily, in fact,
has not yet decided to purch
ase the system. Two of the four
editors on the review commit
tee, in fact, oppose the system,
according to Charlson. We feel
that the Daily is not justified in
asking for a fee assessment for
equipment it has not even de
cided to buy.
As for the in-house compu
ter, the Daily staff believes that

a $25,000 system would replace
the billing work that is already
being done by a San jose com
puter system at a cost of $4,500
per year. Conceivably, the
Daily could finance the purch
ase of the new machine over a
period of five years, annually
paying approximately what
they do now for the San Jose
services, without the need of
any fee assessment money.
Finally, the Daily claims that
past fee assessments have al
lowed the Daily to increase the
newspaper's size from an aver
age of 7.9 to 10 pages, and to
"run papers with smaller ad
vertising percentages." This is
not the case. First, Charlson
stated that a "six to eight-page
paper barely breaks even or
loses money" while a 10-page
paper makes money because it
can run more advertisements.
So increasing the number of
pages actually increases re
venues, rather than demand
ing more! Second, although
the percentage of space de
voted to advertisements may
have declined slightly,
Charlson states that a general
40 percent advertisement
space rule was followed last
year as well as this year. In fact,
contrary to what the Daily
printed in its pro-fee assess
ment article, no precise adver
tising percentages have been
calculated.
An analysis of the Daily's
need for a three-quarter fee as
sessment reflects a total ab
sence of reasonable justifica
tion. The assessment is not jus
tified by the reserve fund, the
profit-loss picture, equipment
needs or the maintenance of
size and quality.
The Daily is on sound finan
cial grounds compared to
the other organizations that
are requesting fee assess
ments, as demonstrated by the
fact that they were able to fi
nance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. Although an
eventual decision to obtain a
VDT system may require a fee
assessment in the future, until
then the appropriate vote on
the Daily's request is No.

Editor's note: Certainly
everyone is entitled to his opin
ion, but there are some serious
misstatements of fact above.
First off, it should be clear
that the purpose of a reserve
fund is to guard against unan
ticipated losses of revenue or
increases in expense. In other
words, it is an emergency fund,
and it is not our desire or intent
to spend the reserve fund in
order to meet extraordinary
costs of new capital equipment
here.
It is true that the fee assess
ment has generally meant the
difference between profit and
loss in a given year if all the
facts are included. For one
thing, the Daily does not just
receive an assessment from
students. An amount totaling
$14,000 per year for faculty and
staff bulk subscriptions is also
assessed. The two assessments
are linked - we get both or
neither - meaning that we are
speaking of $44,000 when we
make that claim.
Over the two years men
tioned above, we had a net in
come of $92,300, but $88,000 of
revenue came in from our as
sessments. Therefore, it is easy
to see that we would have
hardly broken even, no less
realize a $23,000 profit, had the

assessments not been levied.
That notwithstanding, we
have never said we are pre
sently in desperate financial
straits. We make no bones
about it. We are financially
sound for normal operations.
But there are literally
thousands (not hundreds) of
dollars of improvements and
required maintainence which
must be completed in the near
future. If a reliable typewriter is
not a necessity for a daily
newspaper, then what is?
It is true that the Daily has
not yet made a decision on
VDTs, but it is also true that the
Board of Directors of our cor
poration, always concerned
that Daily money is being
properly spent, directed our
staff to form a committee to be
certain that a system was in our
best interests in the long term.
While forming that committee
we purposefully looked for two
people who had a predisposi
tion against VDTs so that the
negative aspects of the idea
could be heard thoroughly, as
we feel they should before
such an expenditure, and so
the committee would not be
stacked either way.
As was stated in the interview
with Merkley and Novacek, the
Daily is presently formulating a
capital expenditures program
which will include a decision
on VDTs. If we do not antici
pate using the funds, it is likely
that we will simply ask the re
gistrar not to collect the entire
approved assessment. But
prudence dictates that before
we buy such an expensive
item, we must be certain the
money is there.
The paragraph concerning
advertising percentages is re
ally quite garbled. This is a
complex business, and it pains
me to have to go through it
here because this issue points
up the complexity of running a
$400,000-a-year corporation.
But here are the facts. This year
we have generally run smaller
ad percentage newspapers,
and the papers have been
about TO pages per issue on av
erage. It is true that we cannot
make money on six- or eight
page papers because of the
fixed costs, but the point dur
ing the interview with Merkley
and Novacek was that this year
we are more at liberty to au
thorize larger papers even if the
inches of advertising do not re
ally justify it.
For example, the choice be
tween running a 36 percent 10
page paper and a 45 percent
eight involves the same adver
tising revenues. Last year, there
would almost never be a ques
tion - we would go with the
eight because we were watch
ing costs. This year the oppo
site is true - we almost always
go with the 10 to allow for more
editorial material.
In fact, despite the claim
above, the Daily does calculate
advertising percentages on
every paper. Anyone who
wishes is welcome to see them.
The last factual item involves
the claim that we were able to
finance a 30 percent wage in
crease this year. The number is
correct, but the percentage is
meaningless unless we include
dollar figures.
The 30 percent raise allowed
editorial staff members to
move from a salary well below
$1 per hour to about that level.
It can hardly be fairly implied or
stated that the Daily staff is
overpaid. In fact, the low level
of pay is a large reason our staff
is smaller and more uniform in

composition than we would
like.
Students should note that
with the assessment, the Daily
would still be only two pennies
a day. And that assumes you
don't claim the refund possi
ble. Many organizations are im
portant to Stanford, but no
other can claim that for only
two cents a day, five days a
week, it performs the service to
this community the Daily pro
vides. The Daily is a complex
organization which is not en
tirely understood even by
many with its walls, not to men
tion those outside. But we have
tried to be open. We published
our financial statements this
year. We are scrutinized in ex
penditures closely by our
Board of Directors and by in
dependent auditors. Never has
anyone claimed that one
penny of Daily funds were
being in any way misused.
Finally, it is simply ludicrous
to imply that financial stability
is the one criterion to be usee/
in making judgements about
assessments. We used several
criteria in making our judge
ments on all 17 assessments,
including our own.
Reserve funds are not made
to be spent on normal opera
tions. If they were, then it
would be logical to ask ASSU to
deplete its $350,000 in reserves
to pay for the eight assess
ments on the ballot associated
directly with that parent or
ganization.
But just as it is unreasonable
to ask ASSU to do that, so it is
unreasonable to ask the Daily
to either pay for these long
needed improvements out of
reserves or to continue to do
without them.
We would like to thank
Merkley and Novacek for ask
ing about our operations and
for having the courage to sign
their statement concerning our
organization. We certainly
must respect such a sincere
statement of views more seri
ously than those of many Daily
critics which go unsigned.

Erratic hand
TheDa//y's recommendation
on the New Directions fee as
sessment seemed to me both
narrow in its criteria and based
on a hypercritical view of New
Directions as an organization.
Students must decide for
themselves whether to support
New Directions, but they
should not do so on the basis
of supercilious and superficial
evaluations by the Daily staff.
I find the New Directions
newsletter to be of remarkably
high quality. It is informative,
concise and presents informa
tion that is not readily available
elsewhere to students. Each
issue of the newsletter focuses
on a particular set of world
problems: this year, New Di
rections has considered nuc
lear proliferation, agricultural
development in the Third
World and politics in the Mid
dle East. The choice of topics
shows good judgment, and the
lead articles have been excel
lent. *
Temptations to ignore world
affairs are great here. Perhaps
the pages of the Daily illustrate
how easily local and somewhat
parochial concerns overwhelm
the attention paid to more im
portant, but more distant,
events. Students in New Direc
tions have tried, in a responsi

ble way, to discuss world prob
lems that affect people here
and that we may be able to do
something about. Such efforts
should in my view be sup
ported, not dismissed with a
superficial wave of the Daily's
rather erratic editorial hand.

No on II
We strongly object to certain
provisions in Constitutional
Amendment 11, and urge its
defeat at the polls Wednesday
and Thursday.
The Nominations Commit
tee is a non-political body,
charged with nominating stu
dents to the university commit
tee system, on the basis of
merit alone. We fear that if a
member of the ASSU Senate is
automatically granted a seat on
that committee, its non
political nature will change.
The senate has shown itself to
be almost wholly concerned
with politics in the past; this
bent cannot fail to show up in
the Nom Corn's work in the fu
ture if this amendment passes.
Because no senator is pre
vented from applying to the
Nom Com, because the senate
confirms all appointments to
the Nom Com, and because
the senate has already set up a
review Committee on Commit
tees to monitor committee ac
tivities, we see no useful pur
pose in giving the senate one
seat on the Nom Com to play
with.
If this measure passes, the
senate risks the resignation of
one or more Nom Com mem
bers, because the Nom Com
may become no more than an
extension of the senate. Pro
tect the non-political nature of
the Nom Com. Vote no on
Constitutional Amendment 11.

No courage
Although some of the criti
cisms of the Daily in the circu
lar entitled "Keep your Dol
lars" might be considered
valid, it is a shame that there
was no group to receive credit.
At least Daily editorial writ
ers have the courage to take
credit (or blame) for their opin
ions.
One can only conclude that
authors of the circular had
their fee assessment request
denied by the Daily. They
probably remained anonym
ous fearing identification
might detract from the credibil
ity of their criticisms.

"The shady oak; the stately

of a great Western university."
If you were present and sen

games, you may have heard the
band announcer (me) mumble
such words as part of the pre
game obsequies, just before
the Incomparables began to
perform their usual depreda

crassly fashioned plug for the
views of one faction in the
mascot controversy. The time
has come to reiterate those
views, with equal crassitude
and in somewhat greater de
tail.
The partisans of the griffin
gryphon have ably shown that
their candidate is noble, pow
erful and replete with heraldic
and mythological significance.
That's precisely the point. The
griffin-gryphon would present
an appropriate image for an in
fant University of California at
Sunnyvale, starting from
scratch with fresh paint on
stucco buildings and no tradi

going operation, doesn't have
to reach for that kind of new

The alternative candidate,
the Stanford Tree, is already an
emblem of the University,
painted on the side of trucks
and embossed on all of that
stationery you bought for all
those letters you haven't writ

how easily local and somewhat
parochial concerns overwhelm
the attention paid to more im
portant, but more distant,
events. Students in New Direc
tions have tried, in a responsi

ble way, to discuss world prob
lems that affect people here
and that we may be able to do
something about. Such efforts
should in my view be sup
ported, not dismissed with a
superficial wave of the Daily's
rather erratic editorial hand.

No on II
We strongly object to certain
provisions in Constitutional
Amendment 11, and urge its
defeat at the polls Wednesday
and Thursday.
The Nominations Commit
tee is a non-political body,
charged with nominating stu
dents to the university commit
tee system, on the basis of
merit alone. We fear that if a
member of the ASSU Senate is
automatically granted a seat on
that committee, its non
political nature will change.
The senate has shown itself to
be almost wholly concerned
with politics in the past; this
bent cannot fail to show up in
the Nom Corn's work in the fu
ture if this amendment passes.
Because no senator is pre
vented from applying to the
Nom Com, because the senate
confirms all appointments to
the Nom Com, and because
the senate has already set up a
review Committee on Commit
tees to monitor committee ac
tivities, we see no useful pur
pose in giving the senate one
seat on the Nom Com to play
with.
If this measure passes, the
senate risks the resignation of
one or more Nom Com mem
bers, because the Nom Com
may become no more than an
extension of the senate. Pro
tect the non-political nature of
the Nom Com. Vote no on
Constitutional Amendment 11.
