# Cards split with Southern Californians
## Netters beat USC, fall to UCLA

Los Angeles — College tennis
is in a state of confusion this
year. Look at the chain of
events so far. Stanford ranked
No. 1 in the pre-season polls is
outpointed by No. 8 ranked Cal
in the Northern California In
tercollegiates. Then after win
ning the National Indoor Col
legiates SMU is awarded the
top spot. The Mustangs are
promptly upset by No. 4
ranked Trinity, who in turn is
upset by No. 6 ranked Arkan
sas. SMU however, still holds
the top spot when they journey
west for three matches. Trinity
is ranked third on a similar trip.
Both defeat No. 2 ranked Stan
ford but then lose to No. 4
ranked UCLA and No. 5 ranked
Pepperdine down in Southern
California. UCLA had earlier
defeated Arkansas and Pep
perdine so they had wins over
four of the top six teams while
remaining undefeated, so they
inherited the top spot. All the
while USC had been quietly
winning matches, but last
week they defeated UCLA, so
then they were No. 1.
This last weekend did no
thing to clear up the situation.
Friday, Stanford got badly
beaten by UCLA 8-1; however,
the next day the Cards came
back to beat USC 5-4 on the
same courts the Trojans had
beaten the Bruins on a week
earlier. If that's not confusing
enough, Cal won three of the
top four singles matches
Saturday against UCLA before
the Bruins shot down the Bears
in the doubles.
One thing that is for sure,
the Cards came out of the
weekend in great shape in the
Pac-10 conference race. The
Cards are now 4-1, tied for the
lead with both UCLA and USC.
However, the Cards play both
of the other two frontrunners
again at home early in May.
"I was obviously disap
pointed with the loss at
UCLA," said coach Dick
Gould. "But I really was
pleased with the character this
team showed in coming back
against USC. It's really easy for
any team, especially a young
team, after being beaten badly
on one day to keep their heads
down. I think this is the kind of
thing that puts us in good stead
forthe rest of the year. I think a
split in Los Angeles is a good
job."
Friday on a hot, smoggy day

in LA with your normal UCLA
crowd present, the Cards
dropped all six of the singles
matches. Freshmen Scott Bon
durant and Tim Mayotte were
the only Stanford players to
even win a set. Peter Rennert
pushed Fritz Buehning to a
tiebreaker in the second set of
their match, but besides that
the Cards went quietly to the
slow court specialists from
Westwood.
The Cards avoided the shut
out when third doubles team
Jeff Arons and Jim Hodges
scrambled for a three set win.
In spite of their performance
at UCLA when the Cards won
four sets in nine matches, the
Cards bounced back to down
top ranked USC.
It was definitely a good sign
for the future as the Cards'
freshmen accounted for all five
of the Cards' points. Tim
Mayotte took care of Roger

Knapp 7-6, 6-3, Scott Bondur
ant buried Doug Adler 7-6, 6-2,
and Jeff Arons down a set and
5-3 in the second set, won the
last four games of the second
set and the third set 6-3 to win
the match.
Jim Hodges lost a 5-4 tieb
reaker in the third and final set
despite breaking back after
Jack Kruger had been serving
for the match. Hodges and
Arons then teamed up to finish
up an undefeated doubles
weekend dismissing Kruger
and Fernando Von Oertzen
6-4, 6-3. USC took the first
doubles match in straight sets
to tie up the match at 4-4.
Gould, who has often
pointed out that he has the
best group of freshmen in the
nation had his point backed up
by Mayotte and Bondurant.
With the outcome of the match
dependent on their doubles
match, the Card rookies came

through. After losing the first
set 6-3, they battled back to
take the match 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 and
the Cards had a split for the
weekend.
The Cards resume play
Thursday at Stanford Stadium
against San lose.
