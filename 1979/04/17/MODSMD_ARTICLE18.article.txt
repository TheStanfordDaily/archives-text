### Gray Maxwell 
The men's varsity 8 cruised
to a one-length victory over
USC in racing action held at
Redwood Shores on Saturday.
The rest of Stanford Crew had
mixed success competing
against USC and Santa Clara.
Competing against two
squads it defeated last week in
San Diego, the men's varsity
boat jumped to an early lead
and never faltered over the
2000-meter course, as it cros
sed the line in 6:16.93, while
the Trojans finished in 6:20.64.
The Santa Clara varsity finished
third with a time of 6:27.8.
Both the JV and the frosh
boats had considerable dif
ficulties at the start, which they
were unable to overcome. The
JV 8 finished third behind USC
and a Santa Clara JV boat that
was faster than its varsity 8. The
frosh 8 drew the narrow third
lane and collided twice with
Santa Clara in the opening 250
meters, losing two lengths to
USC in the process. The
freshmen pulled ahead of
Santa Clara and challenged
USC for the remainder of the
race, but were unable to make
up the two-length deficit,
which proved to be the margin

of victory.
A novice 8 put in a respecta
ble 6:49.45 and defeated Santa
Clara by six second. Santa
Clara sprinted early in the final
500, but was unable to close
within one-and-a-half lengths
of the Cardinal boat.
The women entered novice
and open 4s and Bs, and put in
admirable performances,
chalking up four second place
finishes.
The women's open 8 co
vered 1000 meters in 3:33.78,
edging out Santa Clara by two
seconds. USC won the ex
tremely close race with a time
of 3:30.65. In the closest raceof
the day, the women's novice 8
gained nearly one length on
Santa Clara in a finishing

sprint, but were edged out by
less than two seconds. Santa
Clara clocked a 3:38.93 while
Stanford finished in 3:40.82. A
few inches provided the mar
gin of victory for Santa Clara.
The women's novice 4 was
defeated by Santa Clara by
open water, while the open 4
was also a victim of inches.
Santa Clara won the open 4
event with a time of 3:56.8. The
Stanford women crossed the
finish line in 3:58.36. USC
finished third, with a time of
4:00.0.
Stanford Crew tallied two
firsts and five seconds for the
day and so looked tough early
in the season. The Crew will be
racing at Redwood Shores
again next weekend.
