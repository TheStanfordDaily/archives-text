# Senators, COP dispute ballot status of districting proposal
## 
### Diane Cahoon Laura Erickson 
The ASSU Senate's election dis
tricting proposals will appear on the
spring quarter ballot tomorrow and
Thursday as a constitutional amend
ment, rather than as a referendum,
according to senate chairperson
George Drysdale.
After last Tuesday's senate meet
ing, where districting was placed on
the ballot as a referendum, eight
senators circulated petitions to the
students to obtain the required 611
signatures to place the proposal on
the ballot as a constitutional
amendment.
However, Council of Presidents
member Andrew Goldenkranz de
cided Wednesday that such action
violated the ASSU Constitution. He
informed Election Commissioner
Dayna Goldfine that the issue could
only appear as a referendum on the
ballot.
Thus, the petitioned Amendment
VI was printed on the ballot as Re
ferendum IV.
Hastily reviewing the situation to
day, Drysdale and senate parlimenta
rian Roc Blumenthal concluded that
Goldenkranz' action was in turn un
constitutional. Since the constitution
states that it is the duty of the senate
to interpret the constitution, Drys
dale's and Blumenthal's interpreta
tion which allows the petitioned dis
tricting proposal on the ballot as an
amendment is binding.
"We have two choices" for revi
sion of the already-printed ballot,
said Assistant Elections Commis
sioner, Mike Browning. "We can
either reprint the ballot or print up a
separate sheet," explaining that Re

ferendum IV will become Constitu
tional Amendment VI. As 4000 ballots
have been printed, the latter method
will most likely be used, according to
Browning.
Students will also vote on new stu
dent body officers, 17 different fee
assessment proposals and indicate
their preference for a new mascot,
according to Goldenkranz.
Students will have five different
mascots to choose from. On the bal
lot will be the Griffins, the Incompar
ables, the Engineers, the Cardinals,
the Trees and the choice of no mas
cot.
Six of the fee assessment propos
als on the ballot this year are new.
Hillel, one of the groups asking for
an assessment, plans to use the
money it would get to build a kosher
kitchen in the Women's Clubhouse.
Asked why the student body as a
whole should pay for a kosher
kitchen, one supporter stated that
Hillel's main justification in asking
for a fee assessment was that it would
be a community kitchen, available to
all.
Another group asking for an as
sessment is the Glee Club. Bob Mac
kinnon, director of the group, said
that the support the club receives
from alumni is no longer enough to
cover travel expenses for their bian
nual tours.
This year's trip will be the last un
less the assessment is passed, Mac
kinnon said, adding that the Glee
Club members serve as University
"ambassadors" while on the road.
Some students are hoping to ob
tain money through a fee assessment
to improve the Boathouse. Accord
ing to )oe Ash, resident and caretaker

of the Boathouse, a fee assessment
would pay for rebuilding the Boath
ouse, as well as lifeguards' salaries
and free canoes.
The Club Sports Council would
split money from an assessment be
tween the various clubs. Rick Valen
tine, council co-chairman, said that
he felt that fundraising was a "real
pain" for the different clubs and that
since club sports involves over 25
percent of the student body, they
should receive more student sup
port.
