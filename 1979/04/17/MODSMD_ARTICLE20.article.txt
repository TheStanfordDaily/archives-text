## Cardinal spikers lose two 
### John Doane 
In this, their first year of stiff
competition, Stanford's vol
leyball Cardinals were not re
ally expected to beat pow
erhouses UCLA and Pepper
dine. Or even come close.
While the Cardinals did, in
fact, lose to those two talented
teams in matches this past
weekend, Stanford's fledgling
volleyball program showed
that it can be competitive in
first class collegiate volleyball,
even at this early stage of de
velopment.
Although UCLA escaped Fri
day's match with its twenty
fifth consecutive win (14-0 in
league play), Stanford's
injury-struck, inexperienced
six earned a moral victory of
their own by taking one game
from the invincible Bruins in
the 15-8,15-3,13-15,15-4 UCLA
win.
The significance of winninga
game off UCLA is seen when
considering the condition of
this year's Bruin squad. Along
with its crew of four Ail-
Americans, UCLA's roster also
includes several high school
All-Americans, causing many
to describe this year's team as
one of the best in UCLA his
tory: that is making quite a
statement, in light of UCLA's
six NCAA national champion
ships and the Bruins' unparal
lelled domination of this rela
tively young sport. (Volleyball
became sanctioned by the
NCAA 10 years ago.)
For example, UCLA is so

talent-laden that even one of
the All-Americans does not
start. Senior Joe Mica, who was
MVP of the NCAA tournament
in 1976, red-shirted last year,
only to return and find an in
credible group of incoming
freshmen threatening to take
his spot.
One of those freshmen, Kar
chy Kiraly was a vital force for
the Bruins in the match. An ex
tremely gifted setter, the
smooth Kiraly teamed up with
All-Americans Singin Smith
and Steve Salmons to outmus
cle the out-manned Cardinals,
jumping out to a quick two
game advantage.
Volleyball's answer to John
Wooden, UCLA coach Al
Scates, then shuttled in six new
players (including Mica), appa
rently assuming that Stanford
would quietly lay down and
die.
But led by Kip Engen, Tom
Grimes, and Don Brewster,
Stanford showed it had no in
tention of providing the Bruin
reserves with target practice.
Brewster, playing for the in
jured Rod Fletcher, gave the
awesome Bruin front line a
hard time with his unorthodox
hitting and blocking styles. The
6-foot-3 Riverside native also
showed blatant disregard for
his body's well-being, and at
one point he dove, headlong
into the stands to keep a point
alive.
Even more effective for Stan
ford was the play of defensive
specialist Crimes and set

ter Engen. Both seemed
genuinely unimpressed with
the UCLA hitting attack and
consistently dug ferocious
Bruin hits. Engen also finished
Stanford's lone win of the night
with three clutch serves, one of
which was an ace.
Against Pepperdine the next
night, the Cardinals seemed to
have gathered some confi
dence, and stayed close to the
Waves before finally bowing
15-10, 15-7, 14-16, 15-6.
Sporting its entire starting
lineup from last year's NCAA
championship team, Pepper
dine relied on potent hitter
Mike Blanchard and veteran
setter Rod Wilde to shake off
the pesky Cardinals.
On the other side of the net,
sophomore Dave Saeta pro
vided Stanford with offensive
punch, pounding Engen's sets
by the respected Pepperdine
block in Stanford's third-game
win.
The pair of weekend
matches had special signifi
cance for Stanford coaches
Fred Sturm and John Bekins.
Both members of UCLA na
tional championship teams,
Sturm and Bekins were reun
ited with their old coach,
Scates, and Pepperdine coach
Kirk Kilgour, also an ex-Bruin
spikcr. One of the top vol
leyball players in UCLA history,
Kilgour was confined to a
wheelchair for life following a
paralyzing injury on a U.S. Na
tional team tour in Europe sev
eral years ago.

his spot.
One of those freshmen, Kar
chy Kiraly was a vital force for
the Bruins in the match. An ex
tremely gifted setter, the
smooth Kiraly teamed up with
All-Americans Singin Smith
and Steve Salmons to outmus
cle the out-manned Cardinals,
jumping out to a quick two
game advantage.
Volleyball's answer to John
Wooden, UCLA coach Al
Scates, then shuttled in six new
players (including Mica), appa
rently assuming that Stanford
would quietly lay down and
die.
But led by Kip Engen, Tom
Grimes, and Don Brewster,
Stanford showed it had no in
tention of providing the Bruin
reserves with target practice.
Brewster, playing for the in
jured Rod Fletcher, gave the
awesome Bruin front line a
hard time with his unorthodox
hitting and blocking styles. The
6-foot-3 Riverside native also
showed blatant disregard for
his body's well-being, and at
one point he dove, headlong
into the stands to keep a point
alive.
Even more effective for Stan
ford was the play of defensive
specialist Crimes and set

ter Engen. Both seemed
genuinely unimpressed with
the UCLA hitting attack and
consistently dug ferocious
Bruin hits. Engen also finished
Stanford's lone win of the night
with three clutch serves, one of
which was an ace.
Against Pepperdine the next
night, the Cardinals seemed to
have gathered some confi
dence, and stayed close to the
Waves before finally bowing
15-10, 15-7, 14-16, 15-6.
Sporting its entire starting
lineup from last year's NCAA
championship team, Pepper
dine relied on potent hitter
Mike Blanchard and veteran
setter Rod Wilde to shake off
the pesky Cardinals.
On the other side of the net,
sophomore Dave Saeta pro
vided Stanford with offensive
punch, pounding Engen's sets
by the respected Pepperdine
block in Stanford's third-game
win.
The pair of weekend
matches had special signifi
cance for Stanford coaches
Fred Sturm and John Bekins.
Both members of UCLA na
tional championship teams,
Sturm and Bekins were reun
ited with their old coach,
Scates, and Pepperdine coach
Kirk Kilgour, also an ex-Bruin
spikcr. One of the top vol
leyball players in UCLA history,
Kilgour was confined to a
wheelchair for life following a
paralyzing injury on a U.S. Na
tional team tour in Europe sev
eral years ago.
In this, their first year of stiff
competition, Stanford's vol
leyball Cardinals were not re
ally expected to beat pow
erhouses UCLA and Pepper
dine. Or even come close.
While the Cardinals did, in
fact, lose to those two talented
teams in matches this past
weekend, Stanford's fledgling
volleyball program showed
that it can be competitive in
first class collegiate volleyball,
even at this early stage of de
velopment.
Although UCLA escaped Fri
day's match with its twenty
fifth consecutive win (14-0 in
league play), Stanford's
injury-struck, inexperienced
six earned a moral victory of
their own by taking one game
from the invincible Bruins in
the 15-8,15-3,13-15,15-4 UCLA
win.
The significance of winninga
game off UCLA is seen when
considering the condition of
this year's Bruin squad. Along
with its crew of four Ail-
Americans, UCLA's roster also
includes several high school
All-Americans, causing many
to describe this year's team as
one of the best in UCLA his
tory: that is making quite a
statement, in light of UCLA's
six NCAA national champion
ships and the Bruins' unparal
lelled domination of this rela
tively young sport. (Volleyball
became sanctioned by the
NCAA 10 years ago.)
For example, UCLA is so

talent-laden that even one of
the All-Americans does not
start. Senior Joe Mica, who was
MVP of the NCAA tournament
in 1976, red-shirted last year,
only to return and find an in
credible group of incoming
freshmen threatening to take
his spot.
