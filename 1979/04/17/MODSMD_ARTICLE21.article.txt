## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Tempe — Last weekend the
Card nine travelled to Tempe
to face the Arizona State Sun
Devils in diamond action. The
Cardinals split straight down
the line with ASU, winning the
first and last games of the
series, and losing the second
and third.
Normally, only three games
would have been played, but
the first was a make-up game of
the contest that was rained out
here on March 16. Thus, the
outcome of the originally
scheduled series showed the
Cards at a 2-1 loss. Now
finished with the ASU series,
the Cards scored evenly with
the Sun Devils, 3-3.
The weekend highlight for
the Cards came on the last day
of the series, when Stanford
took the game, 6-4. The Cards
scored two runs at the top of
the first inning, but by the top
of the ninth they were down
4-2, with two outs and the
bases loaded.
7 Senior Mike Codiroli came
to bat and hit a chinker to right
•field that knocked in two runs,
tying the score at 4-4.
' Next at bat was Paul Zuvella.
Codiroli had stolen second out

from underthe Sun Devils, and
Zuvella singled him in for the
run that was to win the game
for the Cards.
At the bottom of the ninth,
Brian Mignano pitched. With
one out, and a mound count of
three and two, the batter for
ASU hit a strong ball to Larry
Reynolds, who caught it for the
double play, and finished the
game.
"There were lots of runs in
every game," said Card coach
Mark Marquess. "It was a real
slug contest."
Stanford won the first game
easily, scoring 12 runs in the
first two innings, and securing
a 12-3 advantage early in the
game. The final score was 15-7.
The second game of the
series was close, but the Sun
Devils took it 11-9. The third
game was a "blow out" with
ASU whopping the Cards 19-9.
Marquess cited outstanding
performances by Larry
Reynolds, Paul Zuvella and
Brian Harrison, who pitched all
of the fourth game.
."Brian Harrison pitched an
outstanding game Saturday,"
Marquess said. "He's had a
sore arm all season, but he re
ally played well."

Stanford is now fourth in
Southern Division Pac-10
standings. UCLA is in first place
(13-5), Arizona and California
are tied at second (10-8), USC is
in third (8-10) and ASU is in fifth
place with a 6-12 win-loss re
cord.
The Card nine face Santa
Clara today at 2:30 p.m. on

Tempe — Last weekend the
Card nine travelled to Tempe
to face the Arizona State Sun
Devils in diamond action. The
Cardinals split straight down
the line with ASU, winning the
first and last games of the
series, and losing the second
and third.
Normally, only three games
would have been played, but
the first was a make-up game of
the contest that was rained out
here on March 16. Thus, the
outcome of the originally
scheduled series showed the
Cards at a 2-1 loss. Now
finished with the ASU series,
the Cards scored evenly with
the Sun Devils, 3-3.
The weekend highlight for
the Cards came on the last day
of the series, when Stanford
took the game, 6-4. The Cards
scored two runs at the top of
the first inning, but by the top
of the ninth they were down
4-2, with two outs and the
bases loaded.
7 Senior Mike Codiroli came
to bat and hit a chinker to right
•field that knocked in two runs,
tying the score at 4-4.
' Next at bat was Paul Zuvella.
Codiroli had stolen second out

from underthe Sun Devils, and
Zuvella singled him in for the
run that was to win the game
for the Cards.
At the bottom of the ninth,
Brian Mignano pitched. With
one out, and a mound count of
three and two, the batter for
ASU hit a strong ball to Larry
Reynolds, who caught it for the
double play, and finished the
game.
"There were lots of runs in
every game," said Card coach
Mark Marquess. "It was a real
slug contest."
Stanford won the first game
easily, scoring 12 runs in the
first two innings, and securing
a 12-3 advantage early in the
game. The final score was 15-7.
The second game of the
series was close, but the Sun
Devils took it 11-9. The third
game was a "blow out" with
ASU whopping the Cards 19-9.
Marquess cited outstanding
performances by Larry
Reynolds, Paul Zuvella and
Brian Harrison, who pitched all
of the fourth game.
."Brian Harrison pitched an
outstanding game Saturday,"
Marquess said. "He's had a
sore arm all season, but he re
ally played well."

Stanford is now fourth in
Southern Division Pac-10
standings. UCLA is in first place
(13-5), Arizona and California
are tied at second (10-8), USC is
in third (8-10) and ASU is in fifth
place with a 6-12 win-loss re
cord.
The Card nine face Santa
Clara today at 2:30 p.m. on
Sunken Diamond.
