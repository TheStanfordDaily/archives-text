Individuals from both Stan
ford gymnastics teams fared
well in post-season competi
tion, with Chris Takimoto plac
ing 15th in the NCAA champ
ionships and Anne Smith
finishing 24th in the United
States Gymnastics Federation
Regional Championships.
Takimoto, hitting his routine
to earn a 9.5, was ranked 9th
after compulsory competition,
then scored an 8.80 on the op
tional for a total of 18.30, the
15th best score on pommel
horse in the country. The top
eight qualified for final round
performances of the Baton
Rouge, La. meet. He finished
11th in the previous two na
tional meets.
"It was disappointing to
finish my (Stanford) career
with a routine like that,"
Takimoto said. "The competi
tion was very good," he added.
"The competition was pretty
good, just that in the optionals
he missed the dismount, so he
lost .5 or .6 of a point," said
coach Sadao Hamada.
"Otherwise he should've
made it (to finals) but that's
part of the competition.
"He could've taken a couple
more days to prepare himself. I

thought he was in pretty good
shape but he should've taken a
few more routines before the
meet. In all-around you have
six events and you get used to
the competitive atmosphere
but being a specialist,
you wait such a long time be
fore you perform and there are
so many good guys on the
same event, suddenly you get
psychologically nervous."
Although the NCAAs mark
the formal end of his Stanford
representation, Takimoto will
"not be entirely retired," en
tering an invitational meet in
Pasadena this Friday.
"Looking over the season,
we improved our score by 30
points overall, and it was the
first time we broke 200 for op
tionals and the first time we
broke 400 in combined com
pulsory and optional scores,"
Hamada reflected. "I was very
happy with that. And thinking
of next year, I'll be losing
Chris, Dan Wessner and a few
other individuals, but we'll
have new freshmen coming in
and all the guys on the team
have improved a lot.
"This year, especially in the
compulsory area, most of the
freshmen didn't know any
tricks of the compulsories — if
I spent too much time there it

would hold up the optional
improvement. All they have to
do for next year is make the
routines cleaner and more
consistent, so we should be
getting a lot stronger than this
year."
Competing with 80 girls from
California, Utah, Nevada and
Arizona, Smith earned 33.95 in
optionals and 35.90 in compul
sories.
According to coach Jackie
Walker, Smith was the only col
lege entrant with the rest of the
field comprised of "high
school-age club competitors."
"She had no outstanding
performances, but everything
was at least average or better,
so she was really consistent

throughout the whole meet,"
Walker said. "This meet qual
ifies her to the Western United
States Championships May 10
to 12 in San Diego."
The top 40 finishers from
both the Western and Eastern
Championships advance to the
nationals.
Karen Hall and Walker are
awaiting the decision on a peti
tion to enter Hall in the World
University Games trials May 4
and 5 in Clarion, Pa. A score of
35.00 in national competition
was the cutoff, and Ha11'534.90
all-around score is being re
viewed by the United States
Collegiate Sports Council's
Gymnastics Committee.

more days to prepare himself. I

thought he was in pretty good
shape but he should've taken a
few more routines before the
meet. In all-around you have
six events and you get used to
the competitive atmosphere
but being a specialist,
you wait such a long time be
fore you perform and there are
so many good guys on the
same event, suddenly you get
psychologically nervous."
Although the NCAAs mark
the formal end of his Stanford
representation, Takimoto will
"not be entirely retired," en
tering an invitational meet in
Pasadena this Friday.
"Looking over the season,
we improved our score by 30
points overall, and it was the
first time we broke 200 for op
tionals and the first time we
broke 400 in combined com
pulsory and optional scores,"
Hamada reflected. "I was very
happy with that. And thinking
of next year, I'll be losing
Chris, Dan Wessner and a few
other individuals, but we'll
have new freshmen coming in
and all the guys on the team
have improved a lot.
"This year, especially in the
compulsory area, most of the
freshmen didn't know any
tricks of the compulsories — if
I spent too much time there it

would hold up the optional
improvement. All they have to
do for next year is make the
routines cleaner and more
consistent, so we should be
getting a lot stronger than this
year."
Competing with 80 girls from
California, Utah, Nevada and
Arizona, Smith earned 33.95 in
optionals and 35.90 in compul
sories.
According to coach Jackie
Walker, Smith was the only col
lege entrant with the rest of the
field comprised of "high
school-age club competitors."
"She had no outstanding
performances, but everything
was at least average or better,
so she was really consistent

throughout the whole meet,"
Walker said. "This meet qual
ifies her to the Western United
States Championships May 10
to 12 in San Diego."
The top 40 finishers from
both the Western and Eastern
Championships advance to the
nationals.
Karen Hall and Walker are
awaiting the decision on a peti
tion to enter Hall in the World
University Games trials May 4
and 5 in Clarion, Pa. A score of
35.00 in national competition
was the cutoff, and Ha11'534.90
all-around score is being re
viewed by the United States
Collegiate Sports Council's
Gymnastics Committee.
