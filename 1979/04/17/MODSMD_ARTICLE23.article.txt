Booters win
The Cardinal Women's soccer team defeated UC-Davis 3-1
despite numerous team injuries on Saturday.
Disabled for at least part of the match were Kelly Scott, Nancy
Geiss, Sue Handel and Pauline McNamara.
McNamara's absence from the entire gamewas particularly felt
since she had been a motivating factorand standout in the last six
or seven games, according to coach Phil Wright.
Ellen Griep scored all three goals for the Cards, unassisted on
the first, assisted by Maria Duryea on the second and a double
assist by Sarah Little and Kathy Kelley on the third.
The Cards are now 4-0 in league play.
