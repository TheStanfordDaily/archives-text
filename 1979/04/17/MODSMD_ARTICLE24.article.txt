"lt was super," exclaimed
assistant women's track coach
Ron Grayson in reference to
his team's second-place finish
in a five-team meet at the
stadium Saturday.
The Card women amassed 57
points to grab the runner-up
spot behind Hayward State's
86-point win and ahead of San
Francisco State (52), Stanislaus
State (42) and University of
California at Davis (40).
"I couldn't have asked any
more than how they (the
Cards) performed as a whole,"
said coach Laurel Treon. "We
scored in every event in which
we were entered," she
explained enthusiastically.
"That says that we're really
rounding ourselves out in track
and field. I can't say that we're
strong, but we're representa
tive. For our first year, I'm al
most amazed at the excellent
progress the team has made,"
Treon concluded.
Spectators at the meet wit

nessed eight personal bests by
Stanford competitors, accord
ing to Treon.
Andrea Cheek was the Car
dinals' top scorer, placing third
in the 400-meters in 61.0 sec
onds and running in the third
piace and school-record set
ting sprint medley and 400-
meter relays.
Sophomore Colleen Dolan
racked up 10 points in the
weight events. She hurled a
second-place javelin throw,
placed third in the shotput
with her lifetime best and a
school record heave of 36-
feet-6 and spun another third
in the discus.
Joanne Ernst achieved
lifetime bests by finishing third
in the 1500 (4:57.4) and the 3000
(10:50.6).
Hillary Hall set a school re
cord with her season best jump
of 16-1 3 /« to earn third-place
honors in the long jump. De
nise Torrey, participating in
that event for the first time this
year, placed fifth in 15-2 1 /2. Tor

rey also sprinted to two
fourth-places in the 200-meters
(27.1 and a school record) and
in thelOO-meters (13.1), as well
as running in the 400-relay.
Carolyn Layzer came from
behind on her anchor leg of
the second-place two-mile re
lay, which recorded a school
best. The mile relay placed
second with yet another school
record.
Grace Oseki chopped 23
seconds off her previous best
time to finish in 11:35.
"It was great to watch.
Everyone just came through,"
Grayson submitted.
"All are doing a great job,"
Treon agreed. "I was very
pleased with their competitive
attitude and their desire to win,
as evidenced by come-from
behind-runs."
Fifteen Card women will
travel to Davis this Saturday to
compete in the Woody Wilson
Relays. Fourteen schools will
appear in the women's divi

sion, according to Treon.
"It's quite a big relay meet
for Northern California and
will give our team a good op

portunity to gain competitive
exposure from teams which we
have not seen yet this year,"
Treon said.
