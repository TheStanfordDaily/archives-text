Terrorists hit Brussels airport
Brussels, Belgium — Thwarted in an attempt to
comandeer an Israeli airliner, Palestinian terrorists
threw a gasoline bomb and a grenade into the
crowded lobby of the airport here Monday. Police
said the bombs and a subsequent shootout in
jured 11 persons.
Belgian police and security guards of the Israeli
El Al Airlines captured two of the terrorists after a
gun battle and said one or two others lunged into
panicked crowds and escaped.
Two persons, including one terrorist, were hos
pitalized. All of the wounded except the terrorist
were Belgians.
Authorities quoted the captured terrorists as
saying they were of the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization and that the airliner was their intended
target.
Tremors plague Adriatic coast
Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia — Aftershocks hampered
rescue work yesterday, and residents along the
shattered Adriatic coast slept outside for a second
night following an earthquake that killed 235 per
sons and injured 1000 in Yugoslavia and Albania.
Tourists scurried for airplane tickets out of the
devastated area.
Seven special charter flights jammed mostly
with German and Yugoslav vacationers left Dub
rovnik in the last two days from the area's only
major airport, an official of the Yugo-tours agency
at Dubrovnik Airport said.
Officials said they recorded 150 aftershocks
after the earthquake, which destroyed buildings
along a 60-mile strip of coastline in southern
Yugoslavia's Montenegro tourist region and in Al
bania. They reported one major aftershock at
midday yesterday, forcing a halt to rescue efforts
as a few already-weakened structures collapsed.
Rescue workers, hampered by shortages of re
lief supplies, labored to provide aid for tens of
thousands who were sleeping in the open air for a
second night, fearing additional earth tremors.
Three killed in securities theft
Waterbury, Conn. — Robbers shot up a Purolator
Security Inc. office and an armored truck early

yesterday, killing three guards and fleeing with
cash and negotiable securities, authorities said.
Reports of the haul's value varied from $1 million
to $50 million.
The New Haven Register quoted an investigator,
who declined to speak on the record, as saying $30
million to $50 million in negotiable securities was
taken.
However, Purolator President John Pratt said he
would be surprised if the total of stolen cash and
securities exceeded $1 million.
Securities include corporate stocks and bonds,
bank certificates of deposit and government
Treasury notes and bonds.
Some negotiable securities are payable to the
bearer, which means they can be sold by anyone.
Others are registered and bear the name of the
owner, whose signature is required to make a sale.
Two of the slain guards arrived about 1 a.m. PST
at the Purolator branch office in an armored truck
bearing a cargo of cash and securities from
Hartford, and the third was on duty at the office,
police said. The truck apparently was met with a
hail of bullets.
Flood drives 17,000 from homes
(ackson, Miss. — The worst Pearl River flood in
history surged deeper into the heart of lackson
yesterday, sending water to the eaves of some
homes in the suburbs and forcing officials to seal
off the downtown area.
With an estimated 17,000 persons already driven
from their homes, the river poured over sandbag
levees and inundated more houses, businesses
and public facilities, including the city's new $48
million sewage treatment plant.
Gov. Cliff Finch has asked President )immy Car
ter to declare much of Mississippi a federal disas
ter area.
Mayor Dale Danks ordered police to seal off
downtown as workers battled to keep floodwater
from knocking out a key electric substation sup
plying power to the area.
Businesses closed, and police turned away all
but non-essential workers to prevent sightseers
from interfering with emergency operations and
dump trucks bringing in dirt for sandbags.
The Pearl reached almost 43 feet at Jackson yes
terday, nearly 25 feet above flood stage and well

above the previous record of 37.5 feet set in 1902.
Officials were predicting the river could crest at 43
feet sometime last night.
Social Security system assessed
Washington — Trustees of the Social Security
system said yesterday that a recession could
jeopardize the system's ability to pay retirement
benefits on time beginning in 1983.
And, the trustees cautioned that the system's
financing is still precarious enough though newly
increased Social Security payroll taxes cannot be
reduced unless Congress also is willing to either
reduce benefits or tap other sources of revenue.
The trustees, in their annual report on the health
of the retirement, survivors and disability insur
ance system, said Social Security could face prob
lems in paying retirement benefits starting in 1983
if the nation falls into a recession this year.
The problem would clear up by 1992 because of
the higher payroll taxes taking effect automatically
through the 1980s, they said. But the system can
not afford a cut in those tax increases, enacted by
Congress in 1977 to keep the system solvent.
The Social Security trustees — Treasury Secret
ary Michael Blumenthal, Labor Secretary Ray Mar
shall and HEW Secretary Joseph Califano — said
the cash flow problem beginning in 1983 could be
avoided if legislation were passed to allow shifting
some Disability Insurance trust funds to the Old
Age Survivors Insurance trust fund.
Stocks drop 10.05
New York — Talk of more credit-tightening by
the Federal Reserve sent stock prices into a broad
decline yesterday, pinning the Dow Jones indust
rial average with its largest loss in more than six
weeks.
The widely recognized average of 30 blue chips
fell 10.05 to 860.45, for its biggest decline since it
dropped 14.12 points last Feb. 27.
Today's weather
Clearing, windy and cooler today with a chance
of morning showers. Fair tonight and tomorrow.
Lows tonight in the low to mid 40s. Highs today in
the mid to upper 50s and tomorrow in the upper
50s to low 60s. Chance of rain 30 percent today.

cash and negotiable securities, authorities said.
Reports of the haul's value varied from $1 million
to $50 million.
The New Haven Register quoted an investigator,
who declined to speak on the record, as saying $30
million to $50 million in negotiable securities was
taken.
However, Purolator President John Pratt said he
would be surprised if the total of stolen cash and
securities exceeded $1 million.
Securities include corporate stocks and bonds,
bank certificates of deposit and government
Treasury notes and bonds.
Some negotiable securities are payable to the
bearer, which means they can be sold by anyone.
Others are registered and bear the name of the
owner, whose signature is required to make a sale.
Two of the slain guards arrived about 1 a.m. PST
at the Purolator branch office in an armored truck
bearing a cargo of cash and securities from
Hartford, and the third was on duty at the office,
police said. The truck apparently was met with a
hail of bullets.
Flood drives 17,000 from homes
(ackson, Miss. — The worst Pearl River flood in
history surged deeper into the heart of lackson
yesterday, sending water to the eaves of some
homes in the suburbs and forcing officials to seal
off the downtown area.
With an estimated 17,000 persons already driven
from their homes, the river poured over sandbag
levees and inundated more houses, businesses
and public facilities, including the city's new $48
million sewage treatment plant.
Gov. Cliff Finch has asked President )immy Car
ter to declare much of Mississippi a federal disas
ter area.
Mayor Dale Danks ordered police to seal off
downtown as workers battled to keep floodwater
from knocking out a key electric substation sup
plying power to the area.
Businesses closed, and police turned away all
but non-essential workers to prevent sightseers
from interfering with emergency operations and
dump trucks bringing in dirt for sandbags.
The Pearl reached almost 43 feet at Jackson yes
terday, nearly 25 feet above flood stage and well

above the previous record of 37.5 feet set in 1902.
Officials were predicting the river could crest at 43
feet sometime last night.
Social Security system assessed
Washington — Trustees of the Social Security
system said yesterday that a recession could
jeopardize the system's ability to pay retirement
benefits on time beginning in 1983.
And, the trustees cautioned that the system's
financing is still precarious enough though newly
increased Social Security payroll taxes cannot be
reduced unless Congress also is willing to either
reduce benefits or tap other sources of revenue.
The trustees, in their annual report on the health
of the retirement, survivors and disability insur
ance system, said Social Security could face prob
lems in paying retirement benefits starting in 1983
if the nation falls into a recession this year.
The problem would clear up by 1992 because of
the higher payroll taxes taking effect automatically
through the 1980s, they said. But the system can
not afford a cut in those tax increases, enacted by
Congress in 1977 to keep the system solvent.
The Social Security trustees — Treasury Secret
ary Michael Blumenthal, Labor Secretary Ray Mar
shall and HEW Secretary Joseph Califano — said
the cash flow problem beginning in 1983 could be
avoided if legislation were passed to allow shifting
some Disability Insurance trust funds to the Old
Age Survivors Insurance trust fund.

Terrorists hit Brussels airport
Brussels, Belgium — Thwarted in an attempt to
comandeer an Israeli airliner, Palestinian terrorists
threw a gasoline bomb and a grenade into the
crowded lobby of the airport here Monday. Police
said the bombs and a subsequent shootout in
jured 11 persons.
Belgian police and security guards of the Israeli
El Al Airlines captured two of the terrorists after a
gun battle and said one or two others lunged into
panicked crowds and escaped.
Two persons, including one terrorist, were hos
pitalized. All of the wounded except the terrorist
were Belgians.
Authorities quoted the captured terrorists as
saying they were of the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization and that the airliner was their intended
target.
Tremors plague Adriatic coast
Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia — Aftershocks hampered
rescue work yesterday, and residents along the
shattered Adriatic coast slept outside for a second
night following an earthquake that killed 235 per
sons and injured 1000 in Yugoslavia and Albania.
Tourists scurried for airplane tickets out of the
devastated area.
Seven special charter flights jammed mostly
with German and Yugoslav vacationers left Dub
rovnik in the last two days from the area's only
major airport, an official of the Yugo-tours agency
at Dubrovnik Airport said.
Officials said they recorded 150 aftershocks
after the earthquake, which destroyed buildings
along a 60-mile strip of coastline in southern
Yugoslavia's Montenegro tourist region and in Al
bania. They reported one major aftershock at
midday yesterday, forcing a halt to rescue efforts
as a few already-weakened structures collapsed.
Rescue workers, hampered by shortages of re
lief supplies, labored to provide aid for tens of
thousands who were sleeping in the open air for a
second night, fearing additional earth tremors.
