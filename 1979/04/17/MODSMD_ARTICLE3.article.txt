## 
### Brad Brockbank 
History Prof. Donald Fehren
bacher received the Pulitzer Prize for
history yesterday for his book, The
Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in
American Law and Politics published
last year by the Oxford University
Press.
Fehrenbacher said his first reac
tion upon hearing the news was one
of fulfillment — that all those hours
at the typewriter had been worth it.
But, he added, "the Pulitzer Prize
isn't all that easy to live up to."
It was the second time in two years
Fehrenbacher has been associated
with the Pulitzer in history. The 1977
award went to the late Prof. David
Potter, whose posthumous work The
Impending Crisis: 1848-1861 was
completed and edited by Fehren
bacher.
Fehrenbacher, who holds the en
dowed William Robertson Coe pro
fessorship of history and American
studies here, said, "I got started ex
pecting to do something short. But it
grew out of all proportion: a history
of the Dred Scott case became the
basis for writing a history of the slav
ery controversy."
He said his original contract with
Oxford called for 70,000 words, but
that he ended up turning in 210,000.
He added that he was grateful to his
publisher, Sheldon Meyer, for pub
lishing the larger manuscript.
On and off
Fehrenbacher said he worked on
the book off and on for 12 years. The
major interruption came following
Potter's death in 1971, after which
Fehrenbacher edited four of his col
league's books.
Fellow historian C. Vann Wood
ward, writing in the New York Review

of Books, described The Dred Scott
Case as "probably the most
thorough study of any Supreme
Court decision ever undertaken."
Besides Potter, Fehrenbacher cre
dits two University of Chicago pro
fessors with influencing his
academic interests. Avery Craven,
now over 90, first stimulated Fehren
bacher's interest in the antebellum
period, while the late William Hutch
inson focused his interest in the con
stitutional history and the coming of
the Civil War.
The 58-year-old professor, who
taught a course here for many years
in constitutional history, said the two
topics are woven together in his
book.
Long experience
Fehrenbacher taught at Roosevelt
University and at Coe College before
coming to Stanford in 1953. A
Guggenheim fellow in 1959-60, he
was Harmsworth professor of Ameri
can history at Oxford University in
1967-68, Harrison professor of his
tory at the College of William and
Mary in 1973-74, and a National En
dowment for the Humanities fellow
in 1975-76.
Last year he was Commonwealth
Fund lecturer at University College in
London and Walter Lynwood Flem
ing lecturer in Southern history at
Louisiana State University.
Fehrenbacher has authored five
other books and edited yet another
five.
In his prize-winning book he
shows the Dred Scott case was more
than just a court case involving an
elderly black man who claimed to be
freed from slavery because he had
served with his master in the free

state of Illinois and in federal territ
ory where slavery was prohibited.
Three reasons
According to Fehrenbacher, there
are three reasons that make this par
ticular case such an important one.
First, this was the first instance in
the history of judicial power that a
higher court tried to make public pol
icy through a decision which over
turned existing law.
Second, in the history of race rela
tions the Dred Scott case was the
"mirror image" of the later Brown vs.
Hoard of Education anti-segregation
decision of 1954.
Finally, Fehrenbacher gave a third
reason which he said "is of more in
terest to historians" than the general
public, which is "to what extent it
(the case) brought on the Civil War."

turned existing law.

Don Fehrenbacher
History Prof. Donald Fehren
bacher received the Pulitzer Prize for
history yesterday for his book, The
Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in
American Law and Politics published
last year by the Oxford University
Press.
Fehrenbacher said his first reac
tion upon hearing the news was one
of fulfillment — that all those hours
at the typewriter had been worth it.
But, he added, "the Pulitzer Prize
isn't all that easy to live up to."
It was the second time in two years
Fehrenbacher has been associated
with the Pulitzer in history. The 1977
award went to the late Prof. David
Potter, whose posthumous work The
Impending Crisis: 1848-1861 was
completed and edited by Fehren
bacher.
Fehrenbacher, who holds the en
dowed William Robertson Coe pro
fessorship of history and American
studies here, said, "I got started ex
pecting to do something short. But it
grew out of all proportion: a history
of the Dred Scott case became the
basis for writing a history of the slav
ery controversy."
He said his original contract with
Oxford called for 70,000 words, but
that he ended up turning in 210,000.
He added that he was grateful to his
publisher, Sheldon Meyer, for pub
lishing the larger manuscript.
On and off
Fehrenbacher said he worked on
the book off and on for 12 years. The
major interruption came following
Potter's death in 1971, after which
Fehrenbacher edited four of his col
league's books.
Fellow historian C. Vann Wood
ward, writing in the New York Review

of Books, described The Dred Scott
Case as "probably the most
thorough study of any Supreme
Court decision ever undertaken."
Besides Potter, Fehrenbacher cre
dits two University of Chicago pro
fessors with influencing his
academic interests. Avery Craven,
now over 90, first stimulated Fehren
bacher's interest in the antebellum
period, while the late William Hutch
inson focused his interest in the con
stitutional history and the coming of
the Civil War.
The 58-year-old professor, who
taught a course here for many years
in constitutional history, said the two
topics are woven together in his
book.
Long experience
Fehrenbacher taught at Roosevelt
University and at Coe College before
coming to Stanford in 1953. A
Guggenheim fellow in 1959-60, he
was Harmsworth professor of Ameri
can history at Oxford University in
1967-68, Harrison professor of his
tory at the College of William and
Mary in 1973-74, and a National En
dowment for the Humanities fellow
in 1975-76.
Last year he was Commonwealth
Fund lecturer at University College in
London and Walter Lynwood Flem
ing lecturer in Southern history at
Louisiana State University.
Fehrenbacher has authored five
other books and edited yet another
five.
In his prize-winning book he
shows the Dred Scott case was more
than just a court case involving an
elderly black man who claimed to be
freed from slavery because he had
served with his master in the free

state of Illinois and in federal territ
ory where slavery was prohibited.
Three reasons
According to Fehrenbacher, there
are three reasons that make this par
ticular case such an important one.
First, this was the first instance in
the history of judicial power that a
higher court tried to make public pol
icy through a decision which over
turned existing law.
Second, in the history of race rela
tions the Dred Scott case was the
"mirror image" of the later Brown vs.
Hoard of Education anti-segregation
decision of 1954.
Finally, Fehrenbacher gave a third
reason which he said "is of more in
terest to historians" than the general
public, which is "to what extent it
(the case) brought on the Civil War."
