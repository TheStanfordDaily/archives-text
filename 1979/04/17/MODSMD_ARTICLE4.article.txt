# University continues Stilwell investigation
## 
### Gary Furlong 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant Katch
adourian is investigating reports that Assoc.
Anatomy Prof. Donald Stilwell is once again repre
senting himself as a pre-medical advisor to under
graduates here.
"I have heard that Stilwell says that he has (un
dergraduate) 'advisees,' " Katchadourian said
when contacted by the Daily. "We are looking into
it. We want to know if this is in keeping with what
he can and cannot do."
Stilwell is specifically forbidden to represent
himself as an advisor under an agreement signed
with the University in 1977 after he was officially
censured for sending over 40 unsolicited letters of
recommendation the year before to medical
schools concerning undergraduates here who
were seeking admission.
The current complaints about Stilwell stem from
his appearance at a Pre-Medical Society meeting
winter quarter at which he had been invited to
speak.
According to students who attended the meet
ing, Stilwell referred to "my group of advisees"
throughout his speech and ended by saying that

he would not be taking on "any more advisees
after tomorrow." This produced a flood of stu
dents in his office the next day, according to the
students.
According to one of the students who went to
his office the next day, Stilwell had him fill out a
form on which the student promised to see Stil
well "at least three times a quarter."
When contacted by the Daily, Stilwell denied
giving the form to any students to fill out, and then
refused all further comment.
President Richard Lyman could not be reached
for comment but, according to University Legal
Counsel John Schwartz, "he (Lyman) is aware
there have been some renewed concerns about
Dr. Stilwell."
Should Katchadourian find that any misconduct
has taken place, the case will be sent to Lyman's
office for review.
"Our interest is in protecting our students,"
Katchadourian said. "Wedo keepaneye on him."
Prior to his 1977 agreement with the University,
there had been complaints that Stilwell had
supplied bad advice or misinformation to stu
dents, according to Anne Coxon, head of the

Academic Information Center.
"For instance, a few years ago some students
were advised to turn up at medical schools without
scheduled interviews," Coxon said. "We believe
this is what he advised them to do."
A senior who wished to remain unidentified
confirmed that he had been advised "a few years
ago" by Stilwell to "show up" at medical schools
without an interview.
Stilwell has been the subject of two official dis
ciplinary actions by the University, the first being
the dispatch of the unsolicited letters of recom
mendation two years ago. At that time Stilwell
signed an agreement stating in part that he would
"no longer represent or describe hirrfself as an
advisor, pre-medical or otherwise," according to
Schwartz.
The second incident occurred winter quarter of
last year, when Stilwell was accused of "striking"
two medical school students. Following a lengthy
investigation ending in March, Lyman fined Stil
well $2000, and warned him that if any other mis
conduct occurred, it could result in the termina
tion of his employment at Stanford.
