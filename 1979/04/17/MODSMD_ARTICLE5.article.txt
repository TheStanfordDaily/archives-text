They call themselves the CRIP
slate, which stands for Greater
Responsibility In the Process. This
Council of Presidents' (COP) slate
of Liat Applewhite, John Pomfret,
Bambi Markel and Nathan Sarki
sian advocates structural change
in the University committee sys
tem to allow for more student
input and better representation.
Markel, a sophomore majoring
in Political Theory, said, "We want
the University to strive to take
note of student interests. If it
takes longer, more people and
more bureaucracy, we think it's
worth it."
"We don't feel that there is any
real representation of student in
terests, in that there is no
mechanism to obligate the ASSU
Senate to do so," said Pomfret, a
junior in East Asian Studies. "We

think the COP can, through con
stitutional amendment, support
students."
Sarkisian, a junior majoring in
Economics and Mathematics, is
the member of the slatewhoplans
to work specifically on the im
plementation of change in the
University decision-making struc
ture.
"An increase in student interest
is directly related to student in
volvement," he maintained.
Therefore, he said that more stu
dent activity should be solicited in
two ways: (1) Let students know
that they can affect University pol
icy and (2) Show students, in the
way committee membership and
senate representation are chosen,
that the administration is in
terested in student opinion.

"We want to communicate with
students in dorm meetings and
door-to-door if necessary, so that
their voice can now be a viable
force in University policy," Sarki
sian explained.
"There is an inherent flaw on
the student level because the se
nate is not in touch with its consti
tuency, and, furthermore, the se
nate does not decide important
things," he said.
Pomfret added that "a more vi
able Committee on Committees
could provide concrete measures
to investigate" student represen
tation on University committees.
Pomfret said that he is con
cerned with three major areas.
The first is student services, which
includes the possibility of
student-run operations in the
Coffee House, Encina Commons
and the Store, and the installation
of an alternative to the
Bookstore's monopoly on cam
pus.
Also, he said he is interested in
more student evaluation of pro
fessors and more student input to
tenure boards. Finally, Pomfret
said that he would be involved
with graduate students to support
graduate accessibility to on
campus housing as well as child
support facilities for Escondido
Village.
Markel proposed to act in the
interests of improved advising,
"the humanization of the pre
medical program" and housing
policy. She cited student advising
and an "investigation of the feasi
bility of offering the chemistry
series throughout the year, like
the economics series," as

methods to improve the current
pre-med program.
Applewhite, a junior American
Studies major, said her regions of
emphasis were women's, minor
ity and gay rights. She said that
she would work for more aware
ness in all of these areas.
Markel summed up the slate's
philosophy as a "grass roots effort
aimed at affecting everyone, not
just separate groups." She said
her slate wants the University to
realize that "they just can't shove
things down our throats."
Defending their lack of experi
ence, Markel said, "The govern
ment is so ineffectual, so why do
we need experience? We feel that
interest is more important than
experience," Applewhite added.
"We think our ideas are really
solid," Sarkisian said. "We want
to make sure that people don't
think that we're up in the clouds."
