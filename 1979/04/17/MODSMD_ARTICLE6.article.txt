"We want to try to use the struc
ture of the ASSU to do things
right," Tom Gart said about the
Council of Presidents' slate of
which he is a member. Cart, Sibby
Freeman, Laura Mead and Mary
Leßlanc are running as a slate on a
well-defined platform which en
courages more student involve
ment in student government and
in the University as a whole.
"One thing we are running on is
experience," Gart emphasized.
"We have the tools to work with
and the ideas to implement effi
cient policy."
That experience is distributed
throughout the slate. Freeman, a
Masters candidate in Anthropol
ogy, leads the slate with a solid
background of four years of work
in the residence system as an RA
and administrative assistant in
Lagunita Court.
Junior Human Biology major
Mead is currently the chairperson
of the Tresidder Program Board.
She has worked at Tresidder for
the past two years and is a
member of the Union Gover
nance Task Force.
Leßlanc, a junior pre-med
majoring in Anthropology, is also
a member of the Tresidder Prog
ram Board and has been a
member of various University
committees.
Gart is the only one directly in
volved in student government. He
now serves as an ASSU senator
and as associate chairperson of
the senate Rules Committee. As
such, he was a major contributor
to the senate's proposed election
reform.

"My big emphasis is to get Tre
sidder remodeled because I think
the University needs a gathering
spot for students," Mead said.
"I'd like to see more student input
and the ASSU more involved in
the government at Tresidder,"
she continued.
She said that she is concerned
about the establishment of a
well-organized Public Research
Interest Group (PIRG) on campus.
"The frustrations of the senate
this year provided me with an im
petus to be more involved," Gart
said of his decision to run for
COP. He said that he envisions
the COP as the proper leaders for
the senate and the students. He
would work closely with the se
nate to reform the committee sys
tem to provide a strong and rep

resentative voice in University
policy-making.
Freeman outlined his major in
terests as naturally coinciding
with the University residence sys
tem. "That's where day-to-day ac
complishments take place and
where things can be effectively
changed," he said.
Freeman said he would
specialize in graduate affairs, such
as the creation of more varied and
expanded housing options for
graduates, the placement of
graduate studerlts on faculty and
tenure committees and more ef
fective management of the
Graduate Student Association and
its funds.
Leßlanc said that she is in
terested in two general areas —
women's issues and academic af
fairs. She would concentrate on
the creation of an umbrella or-

ganization for women's groups
here, a greater awareness of wo
men's safety problems, the tribu
lations of the woman athlete and
the attainment of more tenured
women professors.
"I think the faculty should be
more motivated to advise," she
commented on her ideas to im
prove academic advising. "The
success of peer advising at Tran
cos underscores the campus need
for this type of program," she ad
ded.
"We think that we can work in
the system and still bring new
ideas," Mead said.
"Anyone who is frustrated can
come to us," Gart said. The mem
bers of the slate said that they
would hold office hours every
day, and night hours at least once
a week in the event of their elec
tion.
