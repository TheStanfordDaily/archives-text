# Housing Draw underway

"If you're going through the Draw, tell us
where you'd most like to live," stressed Jean
Kitaji of the Single Student Housing Office.
"Don't just tell where you'd be satisfied with,
but really tell us where you would like to live,"
she went on to say.
The Housing Draw begins today at Tresidder
Union andsowithit, the multitude of questions
and problems that always arise.
Kitaji emphasized that the biggest mistake
that students make is trying to second-guess
where they'll be living next fall using the cutoff
number of a residence from previous years.
"Last year's cutoff numbers are of no impor
tance," she said, "since things can change dras
tically from year to year." The cutoff depends on
a multitude of factors including housing prefer
ences, whether or not a student is guaranteed,
and other factors beyond the number a student
receives in the Draw, according to Kitaji.
Kitaji stated that no changes exist from last
year's draw that would have any effect on stu
dents. She placed particular emphasis upon the
first round of the Draw.
"If you miss the first round of the Draw, you
cannot make it up by going through the second

round. Only people with first round numbers
will be allowed to participate in round two," she
said.
The draw itself will continue through Friday
and in early May the results will be released,
according to Kitaji.
When asked as to how fraternity bidding fits
into the schedule, Kitaji explained that all frater
nities are instructed they cannot require a per
son to accept a bid until first round results are
released.
"There should be no coercion for men to feel
compelled to accept a bid when they're still wait
ing for a Draw assignment," she commented.
Housing assignments, the Draw manual
reads, "are determined by a participant's
choices, priorities, draw numbers, standing
under the Guaranteed Housing Plan and by the
number of spaces available in the 44 residences
that are assigned through the Draw."
Once the first round results are posted, stu
dents complete a second round Draw card, list
ing their preferences for the second round of
the Draw. Sometime in early June these results
are announced and the last card, with the stu
dent's final decision whether or not to accept
where they have been placed, is due June 8.
