# Donald Kennedy to return as provost
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Donald Kennedy, the commissioner of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), has been appointed vice president
and provost, effective Aug. 1, President
Richard Lyman announced yesterday.
In a statement released here and in
Washington, Lyman said Kennedy, 47,
would resign his FDA post to return to the
University.
Kennedy, a University biology profes
sor, said in the statement, "This de
cision was reached only after long and
difficult deliberation." But, he said he
decided to return to the University "to
join a friend of long standing, Dick Ly
man, in the leadership of an institution
with which I have had nearly 20 years of
happy association."
"Delight" was the immediate reaction
on campus, but with the announcement
came renewed speculation that Lyman
will soon step down as president.
According to Lyman, the Board of Trus
tees approved the appointment of Ken
nedy at its March meeting, but the an
nouncement was originally delayed to
allow Kennedy time to consider the offer.
The announcement was further delayed
at the request of Kennedy's superior,
Health, Education and Welfare Secretary

Joseph Califano.
"I've got a few things I wish I could
finish up," Kennedy said. "I like the
people at the agency, and I wish I could
have spent more time with them. But I am
absolutely thrilled about coming home."
Kennedy will return to the University
this summer following his )une 30 resig
nation. He and his wife, leanne, plan to
live in Hanna House, a Frank Lloyd Wright
creation on campus, where the provost
has traditionally lived. Presently the
house is occupied by Athletic Director
Andy Ceiger.
Ms. Kennedy will assume the position
of director of community relations at the
Medical School in August. Presently, she
is director of resources development and
special assistant to the president of the
Institute of Medicine in Washington.
Kennedy said his wife initiated the in
quiries about the Medical Center job
after it appeared that they might return to
the University. He claimed nis decision
was not contingent upon her job and
added that her qualifications make her
"well-suited" for that position.
Ethics law
Kennedy said his decision to return to
the University was not based on the new
so-called "ethics law" which will become

effective July 1 for all government
employees.
Though details of the regulations are
not clear, the law basically will require
those working for government regulatory
agencies to wait two years before return
ing to private-sector jobs which could
produce a conflict of interests.
Kennedy said, "There are some re
motely possible restrictions that might
peripherally affect me," but the law "was
not a significant factor in my decision.
"I decided to come back because I
wanted to be provost at Stanford. I think
it is an amazing place. It is a remarkable
institution. I'm delighted to be coming
back to it."
Lyman praise
Contacted in Washington yesterday,
where he is attending the annual meeting
of the Association of American Univer
sities, Lyman described Kennedy as
"forceful, energetic and charismatic. He
is an excellent researcher and an extraor
dinarily good teacher."
Praise for Kennedy was echoed by the
Board of Trustees and from key faculty
members yesterday.
Peter Bing, president of the board,
said, "We are obviously delighted that
both Don and Jeanne are returning to the

University."
Acting Provost Gerald Lieberman also
used the term "delight" and said the
appointment was "an excellent choice. I
couldn't think of anyone better."
William Chace, chairman of the Faculty
Senate and professor of English, was even
more enthusiastic. "I am immensely de
lighted. I think it is tremendous news. I
cannot think of a better appointment,"
he said. "I am quite sure most of my col
leagues in the senate would share those
sentiments."
Professors in the sciences, social sci
ences and humanities contacted yester
day were unanimous in their praise of
Kennedy.
Creator of Human Bio pro^am
Kennedy is highly regarded as an
academic administrator, teacher and
scholar, having served as chairman of the
Biology Dept. and head of the Human
Biology program, which he essentially
created. He is a member of the National
Academy of Science and the Institute of
Medicine.
In recent years, Kennedy has been a
sought-after personality in the academic
world. During Vale's search for a new
president, the Washington Post reported
that Kennedy had been offered the posi

tion, but turned it down.
It was also reported that he was a top
contender for the presidency at the Uni
versity of Chicago two years ago.
Speculation
In addition, Kennedy has often been
mentioned as the most likely replace
ment for Lyman by faculty and administ
ration figures here.
Speculation rose that Kennedy would
return here during January when Lyman
was in competition for the presidency at
the Ford Foundation.
Though he did not receive the ap
pointment, many here believed that
Lyman was getting ready to depart. That
speculation has heightened again as the
Rockefeller Foundation recently began
its search for its next president, a position
for which Lyman is a contender. How
ever, Bing, Lyman and Kennedy all insist
that no guarantees about the presidency
were made when Kennedy was offered
the provost position.
No promises
"There was a clear understanding with
Don, prior to his acceptance of the pro
vost position, that it was completely unre
lated to any future consideration for Uni
versity president should that position be
come vacant," said.
"There is a clear understanding
that there is no lien on that job (the
presidency) should it become vacant
at any time," Lyman said, labeling
"absolutely untrue" any claim that
any such agreement existed.
"I am aware that this type of gossip
was inevitable," lyman said, "but
there is nothing to it."
Kennedy said, "I made it clear to
the trustees I talked to and to Dick
that I had no expectations on the job
(of president), nor did I wish to have
any obligations about the job."
Future concerns
Kennedy said he would not be a
"knight on horseback" rushing in to
change the University when he ar
rived, and he said he did not have a
specific program of priorities set be
cause he is not familiar with all the
present problems confronting the
University.
He said, however, that he has

some general concerns which carry
over from his yearsasaprofessorand
a department chairman.
He said he was concerned with the
content of undergraduate education
and wants to study the work Dean of
Undergraduate Studies He rant
Katchadourian has been doing on
student decision making and the
way those decisions affect their fu
ture. He also cited "the access prob
lem," which he said involves deter
mining what academic resources are
needed and then figuring out how to
make them available to students in
the best way.
In addition, Kennedy said one of
his concerns would be the hiring of
young faculty members.
Kennedy will succeed William Mil
ler, who resigned effective |an. 1 to
take an appointment as the Herbert
Hoover professor of public and pri
vate management at the Graduate
School of Business.

more enthusiastic. "I am immensely de
lighted. I think it is tremendous news. I
cannot think of a better appointment,"
he said. "I am quite sure most of my col
leagues in the senate would share those
sentiments."
Professors in the sciences, social sci
ences and humanities contacted yester
day were unanimous in their praise of
Kennedy.
Creator of Human Bio pro^am
Kennedy is highly regarded as an
academic administrator, teacher and
scholar, having served as chairman of the
Biology Dept. and head of the Human
Biology program, which he essentially
created. He is a member of the National
Academy of Science and the Institute of
Medicine.
In recent years, Kennedy has been a
sought-after personality in the academic
world. During Vale's search for a new
president, the Washington Post reported
that Kennedy had been offered the posi

tion, but turned it down.
It was also reported that he was a top
contender for the presidency at the Uni
versity of Chicago two years ago.
Speculation
In addition, Kennedy has often been
mentioned as the most likely replace
ment for Lyman by faculty and administ
ration figures here.
Speculation rose that Kennedy would
return here during January when Lyman
was in competition for the presidency at
the Ford Foundation.
Though he did not receive the ap
pointment, many here believed that
Lyman was getting ready to depart. That
speculation has heightened again as the
Rockefeller Foundation recently began
its search for its next president, a position
for which Lyman is a contender. How
ever, Bing, Lyman and Kennedy all insist
that no guarantees about the presidency
were made when Kennedy was offered
the provost position.
No promises
"There was a clear understanding with
Don, prior to his acceptance of the pro
vost position, that it was completely unre
lated to any future consideration for Uni
versity president should that position be
come vacant," said.
"There is a clear understanding
that there is no lien on that job (the
presidency) should it become vacant
at any time," Lyman said, labeling
"absolutely untrue" any claim that
any such agreement existed.
"I am aware that this type of gossip
was inevitable," lyman said, "but
there is nothing to it."
Kennedy said, "I made it clear to
the trustees I talked to and to Dick
that I had no expectations on the job
(of president), nor did I wish to have
any obligations about the job."
Future concerns
Kennedy said he would not be a
"knight on horseback" rushing in to
change the University when he ar
rived, and he said he did not have a
specific program of priorities set be
cause he is not familiar with all the
present problems confronting the
University.
He said, however, that he has

some general concerns which carry
over from his yearsasaprofessorand
a department chairman.
He said he was concerned with the
content of undergraduate education
and wants to study the work Dean of
Undergraduate Studies He rant
Katchadourian has been doing on
student decision making and the
way those decisions affect their fu
ture. He also cited "the access prob
lem," which he said involves deter
mining what academic resources are
needed and then figuring out how to
make them available to students in
the best way.
In addition, Kennedy said one of
his concerns would be the hiring of
young faculty members.
Kennedy will succeed William Mil
ler, who resigned effective |an. 1 to
take an appointment as the Herbert
Hoover professor of public and pri
vate management at the Graduate
School of Business.
Donald Kennedy, the commissioner of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), has been appointed vice president
and provost, effective Aug. 1, President
Richard Lyman announced yesterday.
In a statement released here and in
Washington, Lyman said Kennedy, 47,
would resign his FDA post to return to the
University.
Kennedy, a University biology profes
sor, said in the statement, "This de
cision was reached only after long and
difficult deliberation." But, he said he
decided to return to the University "to
join a friend of long standing, Dick Ly
man, in the leadership of an institution
with which I have had nearly 20 years of
happy association."
"Delight" was the immediate reaction
on campus, but with the announcement
came renewed speculation that Lyman
will soon step down as president.
According to Lyman, the Board of Trus
tees approved the appointment of Ken
nedy at its March meeting, but the an
nouncement was originally delayed to
allow Kennedy time to consider the offer.
The announcement was further delayed
at the request of Kennedy's superior,
Health, Education and Welfare Secretary

Joseph Califano.
"I've got a few things I wish I could
finish up," Kennedy said. "I like the
people at the agency, and I wish I could
have spent more time with them. But I am
absolutely thrilled about coming home."
Kennedy will return to the University
this summer following his )une 30 resig
nation. He and his wife, leanne, plan to
live in Hanna House, a Frank Lloyd Wright
creation on campus, where the provost
has traditionally lived. Presently the
house is occupied by Athletic Director
Andy Ceiger.
Ms. Kennedy will assume the position
of director of community relations at the
Medical School in August. Presently, she
is director of resources development and
special assistant to the president of the
Institute of Medicine in Washington.
Kennedy said his wife initiated the in
quiries about the Medical Center job
after it appeared that they might return to
the University. He claimed nis decision
was not contingent upon her job and
added that her qualifications make her
"well-suited" for that position.
Ethics law
Kennedy said his decision to return to
the University was not based on the new
so-called "ethics law" which will become

effective July 1 for all government
employees.
Though details of the regulations are
not clear, the law basically will require
those working for government regulatory
agencies to wait two years before return
ing to private-sector jobs which could
produce a conflict of interests.
Kennedy said, "There are some re
motely possible restrictions that might
peripherally affect me," but the law "was
not a significant factor in my decision.
"I decided to come back because I
wanted to be provost at Stanford. I think
it is an amazing place. It is a remarkable
institution. I'm delighted to be coming
back to it."
Lyman praise
Contacted in Washington yesterday,
where he is attending the annual meeting
of the Association of American Univer
sities, Lyman described Kennedy as
"forceful, energetic and charismatic. He
is an excellent researcher and an extraor
dinarily good teacher."
Praise for Kennedy was echoed by the
Board of Trustees and from key faculty
members yesterday.
Peter Bing, president of the board,
said, "We are obviously delighted that
both Don and Jeanne are returning to the

University."
Acting Provost Gerald Lieberman also
used the term "delight" and said the
appointment was "an excellent choice. I
couldn't think of anyone better."
William Chace, chairman of the Faculty
Senate and professor of English, was even
more enthusiastic. "I am immensely de
