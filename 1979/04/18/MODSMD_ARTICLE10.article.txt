# Cornell 'gorging' rate highest in nation
## Stanford, Cal have low suicide rates 
### Mark Morodomi 
Suicide is the third leading
cause of death among college
students. Throughout the
countrv suicide rates tor
people aged JO to 24 have
jumped Irom s.fi per 100,000 in
1955 to 1b.5 per 100,000 in 1975,
According to Dr. David
Dorosin, director of Counsel
ingand Psychological Services,
the Stantord community has
averaged one suicide a year dur
ing the past ten years. UC-
Berkeley shows a similar fi
gure. According to Sgt. Gor
don Smith of the University ot
California Police Services, Ber
keley's suicide rate has de
creased from 5 to i a year over
the past few years to none last
year. In comparison Cornell
Universitv in New York hit a
peak of eight suicides two
years ago. However according
to It. lay McCinnis of Cornell

University police, there has vet
to be a suicide committed on
that campus this year.
McCinnis said that Cornell
students have their own name
for suicide â€” gorging, because
the many gorges that run
through Cornell are frequent
sites for suicides.
Though not extremely visi
ble at Stantord, suicide is defi
nitely a problem, lust last
month peer counselors at the
Bridge listened to what they
deemed an unusually high
count of six callers seriously
contemplating suicide. The
counseling and psychological
services at Huston House
served about 1000 people last
year, the majority of which
came in partly because of a
lowered self-esteem.
"They usually have a sense of
helplessness and a loss of
hope, sometimes including

teelings that life is not worth
living and that they will never
come out of their depression,"
said Dorosin.
He described three sources
of lowered self-esteem.
"We attract a group ot
people who have a high expec
tancy ot themselves and often
we are faced with disappoint
ment," he said. This is sup
ported by an Academic Coun
cil of Education survey per
formed on Stanford freshmen.
Survey results show that 25
percent of freshmen here ex
pect to graduate with honors
compared to the national aver
age of 14 percent. In addition,
74 percent expect to graduate
with a B average or better com
pared to the national average
of 50 percent.
Another source of the low
ered self-esteem according to

Dorosin, is the transition from
childhood to adulthood which
increases a student's responsi
bility and often creates feelings
of inadequacy.

The game of life is hard to play,
I'm going to lose it anyway,
The losing card I'll someday lay,
So this is all I have to say,
That: suicide is painless,
it brings on many changes,
and I can take it or leave it if I please.
-Mike Altman and Johnny Mandel
from the movie "M*A*S*H"

The third source ol lowered
self-esteem is the general
academic atmosphere here.
"Students need to educate
each other and they need to be
honest with each other. They
can learn a lot trom each other
about being human," Dorosin
said.
"Suicide is a problem be
cause depression and aliena
tion are problems. People
need to know about tbe ser
vices here and realize wh.it
they are leeling and know that
they can be helped. They re
not the only person with prob
lems," said Susan Veal, a coun
selor at the Bridge.
Behavioral clues 01 suicide
are the typical depiessive
symptoms such as loss ot; the
ability to sleep, concentration,
energy, sex drive, appetite and
the zest tor life. Sometimes
students in a presuicidal state
will give away a valued posses
sion, such as a stereo set or a
pair ot expensive skis and say:
"Take this, I won't be needing
it anymore."
Situational clues might in
clude the sudden ending ot a
relationship with a spouse or

lover, a drastic drop in grades,
or being fired from a job which
the student needs to remain in
school or loss of other financial
assistance.

Housing authorities recog
nize the problem ol suicide on
campus and have taken some
steps to combat the situation.
