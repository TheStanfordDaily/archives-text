Washington (AP) — Environmentalists plan an
intensive campaign in Congress to block or
delay the Carter administration's decision to
open million acres of national forest lands to
development.
"We think this is unconscionable," William
Turnage, executive director of the Wilderness
Society, said yesterday. Turnage wants much of
the land classitied as wilderness, a designation
that would stop timber cutting, oil and gas dril
ling and new mining ventures.
Ihese are marginal lands," Turnage said.
"We're losing 56 million acres of wilderness.
There's no necessity lor it.'
President Carter's decision to open the land
to development came under the Agriculture
Department's Roadless Area Review and Evalua
tion program, known to many as RARE 11. Under
the program, 62 million acres of roadless and
undeveloped national forest lands were studied
tor possible inclusion in the wilderness system.
Carter proposed 16 million acres be opened
for development, 15.4 million acres be classified
as wilderness and 10.b million acres be studied
further. The latter category blocks most de
velopment during the studv period.

Excluding Alaska, Carter's proposal would in
crease wilderness acreage by 470,000 acres over
the RARE II plan released in (anuary by the U.S.
Eorest Service. His changes in the Forest Service
plan also would decrease by 140,000 acres the
land opened to development and {educe by
HO,OOO acres the land designated for further
study.
The national forest system contains 187 mill
ion acres, of which 14.7 million already are clas
sified as wilderness. The addition ot 15.4 million
acres would mean that 16 percent ot all national
forest lands would be prserved as wilderness.
Don-Lee Davidson, president of the National
Forest Products Association, said the net result
of Carter's proposal "could well be either shor
tages of wood products needed by consumers
or increased imports."
Davidson said timber interests will try to con
vince Congress that some of the lands proposed
for wilderness protection or further study
should be opened for development.
In announcing the president's decision, ad
ministration officials said legislative proposals
would not be sent to Congress for several
weeks.
