## East Asian Studies house refused 
### 
The proposed East Asian
Studies Theme House was de
nied a facility tor 1979-1980 by
the Office of Residential Edu
cation after review of the
proposal by the Committee on
Student Services — Residences
(COSS-R).
As members of the core
committee responsible tor
submitting the proposal, we
are extremel) disappointed
with this decision. Despite the
University's academic excel
lence in East Asian Studies,
there is little opportunity tor
student-tacuity interaction
beyond the classroom setting.
The proposed house would
have provided a central meet
ing place tor students, taculty
and visitors with a common in
terest in East Asia. Such in
teraction could serve as the
basis lor organizing programs
and activities through which
students would deal with East
Asian culture, politics and his
tory on a personal level.
The current relevance ot East
Asia to global politics and
economic s provides an infinite
number ot possibilities tor
such programs. Speakers'
series, film series, in-house
seminars and panel discus
sions were planned on sub
jects ranging trom Japanese art
to Chinese economic de
velopment.
Students and taculty expres
sed great enthusiasm for this
proposal. More than 60 stu
dents committed themselves
to living in the house, and
another 60 expressed an in
terest in helping to coordinate
and participate in house ac
tivities. More than <0 taculty
members pledged their sup

port for the house, indicating
willingness to serve as house
associates, advisors and prog
ram participants.
In short, the proposal had
two of the three requisite
components of a successlul
theme house: an exciting and
viable program, and wide
spread student and (acuity
support. COSS-R was faced
with the dec ision of whether or
not to provide the third com
ponent: an adequate facility.
The reasons tor denial are far

. . . the East Asian house gained
committee 'approval' hut was denied a
facility.

trom clear. The proposal met
with enthusiasm from COSS-R
for its potential benefits to the
community as a whole. Vet the
committee was unwilling to
grant a facility.
The final decision appears to
have retlected con
cern over the proliferation ol
theme houses on campus, and
a desire to limit their number.
Thus at some point the com
mittee made the decision not
to increase the number ol
theme houses. This decision,
however, appears to have been
made atter the deadline lor
submitting new proposals on
|an. 15. It was probably made
sometime in late February,
close to the deadline tor ap
proving new houses.
During the early delibera
tions it was not clear to us inrtr
to COSS-R, we suspect)
whether or not our proposal
was being placed in competi
tion with extant theme houses

for limited facilities, or
whether the proposed resi
dence would be granted or de
nied a lacility solely on the
basis of its own merit.
Since no proper procedure
was defined at the outset,
COSS-R had no systematic
means with which to review ex
tant theme houses along with
new proposals. As a result, the
East Asian House gained com
mittee "approval," but was
denied a facility, much as Haus
Mitteleuropa was two years

Our house must now go
through a "waiting period" of
at least one year before
facilities are available. Such a
period is neither desirable nor
necessary.
Any wait is bound to dampen
enthusiasm lor a new resi
dence no matter how promis
ing the proposal. It COSS-R
were to establish a dear set of
criteria and a systematic pro
cedure tor evaluating theme
houses and proposals, waits
c ould be eliminated.
COSS-R has indicated that it
intends to institute a competi
tive system tor awarding
facilities next year, in which ex
tant houses and new proposals
would vie tor a limited
number ol spaces.
Although we welcome this
move toward definition ot a
system, we leel that the com
petitive system has several
shortcomings. First, it would

place theme houses in a posi
tion of constantly having to
prove themselves to he better
than others, ancl would he
harmful to a spirit of coopera
tion and harmony among the
houses. Second, it would place
new proposals at a distinct dis
advantage tor their lack ot a
"track record" as the basis lor
evaluation.
In any case we have yet to
see evidence ot concrete
moves by COSS-K or the Ottice
ot Residential Education to
ward the definition ol a logical
procedure.
To insure that tuture prop
osals ,ind extant theme houses
all can receive satisfactory
treatment, we encourage
C OSS-K to begin constructing
a new system immediately. We
hope sue h .1 system would pro
vide adequate time tor all in
terested parties (including
non-theme houses who might
be evicted) to be properly
evaluated and to appeal pre
liminary decisions allowing .ill
to understand the nature of the
proc ess.
Despite the setback we re
ceived this year, we feel that
our proposal is still ot value,
and hope that a new core
committee iwe are all juniors)
may be more successful next
year. We appreciate the ettorts
ol all students, faculty and
COSS-R members who sup

COSS-R has indicated that it
intends to institute a competi

facilities next year, in which ex
tant houses and new proposals
would vie tor a limited
number ol spaces.
Although we welcome this
move toward definition ot a
system, we leel that the com
petitive system has several
shortcomings. First, it would

place theme houses in a posi
tion of constantly having to
prove themselves to he better

harmful to a spirit of coopera

houses. Second, it would place
new proposals at a distinct dis

In any case we have yet to
see evidence ot concrete

ot Residential Education to

To insure that tuture prop
osals ,ind extant theme houses
all can receive satisfactory
treatment, we encourage

a new system immediately. We
hope sue h .1 system would pro
vide adequate time tor all in

East Asian Studies Theme
House core committee. I
The proposed East Asian
Studies Theme House was de
nied a facility tor 1979-1980 by
the Office of Residential Edu
cation after review of the
proposal by the Committee on
Student Services — Residences
(COSS-R).
As members of the core
committee responsible tor
submitting the proposal, we
are extremel) disappointed
with this decision. Despite the
University's academic excel
lence in East Asian Studies,
there is little opportunity tor
student-tacuity interaction
beyond the classroom setting.
The proposed house would
have provided a central meet
ing place tor students, taculty
and visitors with a common in
terest in East Asia. Such in
teraction could serve as the
basis lor organizing programs
and activities through which
students would deal with East
Asian culture, politics and his
tory on a personal level.
The current relevance ot East
Asia to global politics and
economic s provides an infinite
number ot possibilities tor
such programs. Speakers'
series, film series, in-house
seminars and panel discus
sions were planned on sub
jects ranging trom Japanese art
to Chinese economic de
velopment.
Students and taculty expres
sed great enthusiasm for this
proposal. More than 60 stu
dents committed themselves
to living in the house, and
another 60 expressed an in
terest in helping to coordinate
and participate in house ac
tivities. More than <0 taculty
members pledged their sup

port for the house, indicating
willingness to serve as house
associates, advisors and prog
ram participants.
In short, the proposal had
two of the three requisite
components of a successlul
theme house: an exciting and
viable program, and wide
spread student and (acuity
support. COSS-R was faced
with the dec ision of whether or
not to provide the third com
ponent: an adequate facility.
The reasons tor denial are far

facility.

trom clear. The proposal met
with enthusiasm from COSS-R
for its potential benefits to the
community as a whole. Vet the
committee was unwilling to
grant a facility.
The final decision appears to
have retlected con
cern over the proliferation ol
theme houses on campus, and
a desire to limit their number.
Thus at some point the com
mittee made the decision not
to increase the number ol
theme houses. This decision,
however, appears to have been
made atter the deadline lor
submitting new proposals on
|an. 15. It was probably made
sometime in late February,
close to the deadline tor ap
proving new houses.
During the early delibera
tions it was not clear to us inrtr
to COSS-R, we suspect)
whether or not our proposal
was being placed in competi
tion with extant theme houses

for limited facilities, or
whether the proposed resi
dence would be granted or de
nied a lacility solely on the
basis of its own merit.
Since no proper procedure
was defined at the outset,
COSS-R had no systematic
means with which to review ex
tant theme houses along with
new proposals. As a result, the
East Asian House gained com
mittee "approval," but was
denied a facility, much as Haus
Mitteleuropa was two years

Our house must now go
through a "waiting period" of
at least one year before
facilities are available. Such a
period is neither desirable nor
necessary.
Any wait is bound to dampen
