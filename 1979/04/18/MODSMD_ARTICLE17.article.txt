Draw strategy
Something is happening
this week that will largely de
termine the kind ot life you'll
have next year â€” the Draw.
Here is a tip lor the Draw,
tree ol charge, to increase your
chances tor a better number It
takes but a moment's thought to
understand this clever
strategy.
Suppose you are the very
first person in line. Also sup
pose that you want, say, a
number trom I to 100. You
have SOOO numbers to choose
Irom. The probability that you

will select from that interval is
100/5000 or 1/50. Not too good.
Chances are excellent (49 50)
you will select a mediocre or
worse number.
The person standing behind
you is happy, because he
knows that his chances will be
in all likelihood, 100/4999: bet
ter, but still nothing to hool
about. The third person wil
very likely be looking at a 100
499K shot at the 1 to 100 slot
Rut there is unfortunately stil
that 98 percent chance thai
he'll lose.
My calculations show tha
chances will remain poor unti

about the second d<iy. So don't
be loolish enough to skip your
9 a.m. class to draw tirst. Let
the situation simmer tor a
while. See how many have al
ready drawn, and then when
the going's ripe," contidently
strut up to draw your ticket to
th.it single, overlooking the
lake ....

Tragic event
On March 25, a U.S. Coast
Guard helicopter made an
emergency flight trom the
beach at Tunitas Creek, near
Pescadero, to the Stanford
Medical Center. On board was
the victim of a water accident
who was under the care of a
San Mateo County Medivac
paramedic and a San Mateo
County Sheriff's Rescue Unit
EMT.
The victim was receiving
cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) and artifical respiration
and had been receiving oxy
gen. Unfortunately, the oxy
gen ran out as the helicopter
was about to take off. A deci
sion was made not to get
another oxygen bottle from a
truck parked near the beach, as
the pilot expected to only take
ten minutes to fly to Stanford.
Getting the other oxygen bot
tle would have delayed the vic
tim's arrival there at least five
minutes.
Upon arrival at the Med
Center's helicopter pad, the
rescuers found no one there to
meet them. They continued
administering CPR and artifi
cial respiration in the helicop
ter (without the badly needed
oxygen) for between 15 and 20
minutes before the paramedics
from Palo Alto arrived to trans
port the victim the extremely

short distance to the
emergency room. The victim
died a few hours later.
This tragic event raises a
number of questions concern
ing emergency air operations
at the Med Center. Why is it
necessary for the Palo Alto
paramedics to transport from
the helicopter pad to the
emergency room? Why we
ren't they there when the
helicopter landed? Why don't
emergency room personnel
meet incoming helicopters?
Why didn't someone Irom the
emergency room at least bring
out more oxygen?
I believe this incident should
be grounds foran 'nvestigation
into the Med Center's
emergency procedures by
both the Med Center's direc
tor and by the University itself.
People that are being flown to
emergency care deserve to be
met like they meet the helicop
ters on the TV series MASH.
They should not be met by
bureaucratic bungling the likes
of which have only been ex
ceeded recently in the control
rooms at BART Central and
Three Mile Island.
In the interim, the helicopter
pad at the Med Center should
be closed and helicopters sent
elsewhere so that victims can
receive emergency care as
soon as possible.

Old homestead
As a former resident of
Theta Chi house, I was sorry to
note that the Daily reporter
neglected to mention the old
homestead in his article on in
dependent and row houses
(April 4). Theta Chi is possibly
the most singular house on

campus. Where else can you
tind a comfortable blend ol
co-ed, co-op and fraternity liv
mg?
Home ot the little known
"tood orgy,'' sponsor ot the
new People's Wall ot Democ
racy (Da;/y photo, April 4) and
originator (last year) of what
Herb Caen described as the
best fraternity prank in years,
Theta Chi is an unusual place
More important, I found there
that political conservatives
(e.g. mvself) radicals (in the
Columbae vein) and the "en
lightened apathetic" could
share their differing politics in
an atmosphere of mutual ap
preciation and understanding.
Committed to a cooperative
lifestyle, the house makes no
religion or crusade of it. With a
real sense of community, it im
poses none of the strictures of
conformity or non-conformity
on its members. Above all,
Theta Chi presents an at
titude that makes it difficult tor
anyone not to feel free there.
In sum, the house takes its
identity from a genuine diver
sity of people, attitudes, and
lifestyles, rather than trom any
preconceived idea of how
people "ought " to live (which
easily becomes a (ultural im
perative of sorts in a close liv
ing situation). As an admitted
partisan, let me say the place is
in a class by itself. Perhaps,
after all, that explains its ab
sence from the Daily review of
"other" houses at Stanford.
