## David Miller Libertarians misperceived 
### 
A new political movement known as liber
tarianism has exploded into existence recently.
In the last year, especially in California, liber
tarianism has established itself as the serious
alternative to the ruling liberal/conservative es
tablishment. Popular political trends (the victory
of Prop. 1 i, the defeat at the Briggs initiative,
etc.) have been in a largely libertarian direction.
The general libertarian position on current
political issues is clear: opposition to foreign
adventurism and the accompanying suppres
sion of civil liberties (by conscription, lor exam
ple); support ot economic treedom and opposi
tion to the existing economy ot privilege; op
position to the legislation ot morality and to the
suppression ol dissident lifestyles.
While libertarian positions are generally clear
and simple, the underlying basis ot those posi
tions is olten misrepresented or misun
derstood.
Libertarianism is grounded in a desire to en
sure the benelicence ol social cooperation. The
basic libertarian principle is that any person
should be allowed to retuse totally, lor any
reason, association with another person or
group of persons — with the result, ol course,
that he IcJjegoes whatever benetits he could
have received from such association.
Stated positively, libertarians would establish
a world in which social action was truly coopera
tive.
I libertarians are individualists in the sense that
they believe the ultimate units ot moral and so
cial analysis are individual persons. They hold
that it is not groups or institutions but people
which matter and that ultimate moral responsi
bility rests not with social collectivities but with
individuals.
Libertarians are not individualists in the
simplistic sense. They do not maintain that soci
ety does or should consist of non-interacting
atomistic individuals or that people do or should
deal with each other solely on the basis ot a cold,
narroWlv egotistical, calculating self-interest.
Any human society does, and must, combine
a concern lor oneself, a c oncern for others ,ind a
concern lor the survival ol one's society.
A libertarian society would embody a wide
diversity in the relative mix ol these three 1 ele
ments. Some persons would choose to live in

close, tight communities, equally sharing the
work and owning property in common; some
persons would choose to live a highly indi
vidualistic and somewhat isolated existence.
The majority of people would, presumably,
choose a middle road.
Curiously, when discussing the prospects of a
libertarian society, both libertarians and their
critics too otten concentrate on the role of self
interest and neglect the roles of concern tor
others and a sense ot community.
In fact, neither a libertarian society (whether
libertarian anarchy or limited-government liber
tarians) nor any relatively tree or democratic
society can endure without a sense of commun
ity and social responsibility. To focus exclusively
on the motive of narrow self-interest is to deny
the possibility of any political community what
soever, libertarian or otherwise.
The ultimate pragmatic question which must
be asked of libertarians is whether certain es
sential services (police, national defense, aid for
the unfortunate, road construction, etc.) can be
provided in a society which excludes coercion.
Libertarians have devoted substantial effort to
discussing the various means of providing such
services under libertarianism — see Murray
Rothbard's For A New Liberty.
However, it is also important to understand
the weakness of the conventional solution for
providing such services. The conventional wis
dom has it that when people cannot themselves
provide certain services, government must step
in and provide these services for them.
If some services really cannot be provided by
people, then to suggest that it be provided by
government is not to offer a solution but a mere
pretense of a solution. It mortal persons are
incapable ot accomplishing some task, then
government, which is composed only of mortal
persons, must also be incapable of accomplish!
ing that task.
libertarianism has had surprising success in
tapping the mood ot the 19705. However, to
view it as merely a temporary excrescence of the
1970s is a mistake, l ibertarianism embodies a
wider and more integrated view of society than
its critics — and many ot its friends — realize.

the possibility of any political community what
soever, libertarian or otherwise.
The ultimate pragmatic question which must
be asked of libertarians is whether certain es
sential services (police, national defense, aid for
the unfortunate, road construction, etc.) can be
provided in a society which excludes coercion.
Libertarians have devoted substantial effort to
discussing the various means of providing such
services under libertarianism — see Murray
Rothbard's For A New Liberty.
However, it is also important to understand
the weakness of the conventional solution for
providing such services. The conventional wis
dom has it that when people cannot themselves
provide certain services, government must step
in and provide these services for them.
If some services really cannot be provided by
people, then to suggest that it be provided by
government is not to offer a solution but a mere
pretense of a solution. It mortal persons are
incapable ot accomplishing some task, then
government, which is composed only of mortal
persons, must also be incapable of accomplish!
ing that task.
libertarianism has had surprising success in
tapping the mood ot the 19705. However, to

1970s is a mistake, l ibertarianism embodies a

its critics — and many ot its friends — realize.

A new political movement known as liber
tarianism has exploded into existence recently.
In the last year, especially in California, liber
tarianism has established itself as the serious
alternative to the ruling liberal/conservative es
tablishment. Popular political trends (the victory
of Prop. 1 i, the defeat at the Briggs initiative,
etc.) have been in a largely libertarian direction.
The general libertarian position on current
political issues is clear: opposition to foreign
adventurism and the accompanying suppres
sion of civil liberties (by conscription, lor exam
ple); support ot economic treedom and opposi
tion to the existing economy ot privilege; op
position to the legislation ot morality and to the
suppression ol dissident lifestyles.
While libertarian positions are generally clear
and simple, the underlying basis ot those posi
tions is olten misrepresented or misun
derstood.
Libertarianism is grounded in a desire to en
sure the benelicence ol social cooperation. The
basic libertarian principle is that any person
should be allowed to retuse totally, lor any
reason, association with another person or
group of persons — with the result, ol course,
that he IcJjegoes whatever benetits he could
have received from such association.
Stated positively, libertarians would establish
a world in which social action was truly coopera
tive.
I libertarians are individualists in the sense that
they believe the ultimate units ot moral and so
cial analysis are individual persons. They hold
that it is not groups or institutions but people
which matter and that ultimate moral responsi
bility rests not with social collectivities but with
individuals.
Libertarians are not individualists in the
simplistic sense. They do not maintain that soci
ety does or should consist of non-interacting
atomistic individuals or that people do or should
deal with each other solely on the basis ot a cold,
narroWlv egotistical, calculating self-interest.
Any human society does, and must, combine
a concern lor oneself, a c oncern for others ,ind a
concern lor the survival ol one's society.
A libertarian society would embody a wide
diversity in the relative mix ol these three 1 ele
ments. Some persons would choose to live in

close, tight communities, equally sharing the
work and owning property in common; some
persons would choose to live a highly indi
vidualistic and somewhat isolated existence.
The majority of people would, presumably,
choose a middle road.
Curiously, when discussing the prospects of a
libertarian society, both libertarians and their
critics too otten concentrate on the role of self
interest and neglect the roles of concern tor
others and a sense ot community.
In fact, neither a libertarian society (whether
libertarian anarchy or limited-government liber
tarians) nor any relatively tree or democratic
society can endure without a sense of commun
ity and social responsibility. To focus exclusively
on the motive of narrow self-interest is to deny
the possibility of any political community what
soever, libertarian or otherwise.

be asked of libertarians is whether certain es
sential services (police, national defense, aid for
