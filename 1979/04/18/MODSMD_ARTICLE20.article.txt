## Nuclear power safest 
### 
In their column (Daily, April
9), Harvey Rose and Amy Pin
kerton blandly stated, . .
other energy sources â€” solar,
wind and conservation . . . are
far safer (than nuclear
power)." I challenge Rose and
Pinkerton to prove this state
ment. I don't think they can
because the best actuarial es
timates suggest that nuclear
power is much safer.
In comparing the safety ot
energy sources, we should
realize that no source is with
out risk. Solar collectors may
collapse. Wind power blades
may separate from their
windmills. Conservation ppses
dangers as suggested below.

Nuclear reactors may
melt down. All ot these energy
sources are dangerous since
some people will die in mining
and refining the materials
necessary to build the equip
ment involved.
When all factors are consi
dered, however, it is clear that
nuclear power (with its pro
duction of tremendous
amounts of energy from a li
mited amount of materials) is
the safest option. Baron
Rothschild, former director of
the British government's Cent
ral Advisory Council for Sci
ence and Technology, reports
the following range of deaths
fora specified energy output of
IOCWy: wind, 230-700 deaths;
solar, space heating 90-100;
uranium, 2.5-15 (Wall Street
journal, March 13).
At best, solar power is six
times more lethal than nuclear
power, and wind power 15
times. It is interesting to note
in this connection that even
though solar collectors now
provide an insignificant
amount of energy several
people have already been kil
led by collapsing solar panels
and the like. No one has ever
been killed by a commercial
nuclear power plant.
This leaves only conserva

tion. While I haye been unable
to find any estimates of safety
(and certainly the burden of
proof should rest on the prop
onents of conservation on this
point), great perils exist. For
example, the carcinogenicity
of many forms of insulation is
well established. Moreover,
this problem cannot be easily
avoided since, as Prof. Paul
Gross has noted, "Car
cinogenicity of asbestos and
fibrous glass seems primarily
related to the structural shape
of these materials rather than
to physiochemical proper
ties" (Archives of Environmen
tal Health, March 1976).
Estimates of deaths from as
bestos currently run as high as
50,000 per year. Certainly a
full-scale effort to save energy
in this manner would kill so
many people as to be worthy of
a Time headline such as "Con
servation Catastrophe."
If Rose and Pinkerton are
truly concerned with safety,
they should direct their atten
tion away from innocuous nuc
lear power plants. But, of
course, safety has never been
the real issue in the debate.
