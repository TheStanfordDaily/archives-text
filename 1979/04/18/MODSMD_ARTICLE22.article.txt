# 'Geologic time bombs'
## Volcanic dangers exist worldwide 
### 
Washington (AP) — The
rumblings of the geologic time
bomb known as Soufriere vol
cano come 77 years after that
same mountain spewed forth
death and destruction, taking
more than <000 lives.
But while residents of the
Caribbean island of St. Vincent
know of the danger in their
midst — and no one was killed
in the Friday the 13th eruption
last week — the same hazard
exists in parts of the world
where people are less aware of
the danger.
There are more than 500 ac
tive volcanoes in the world
ranging from the explosive
types, such as Soufriere, to the
non-explosive ones like
Kilauea on Hawaii, which pro
duces streams of highly fluid
lava.
"We consider a volcano ac
tive when it has erupted within
recorded history. Most of the
world's volcanoes are dor
mant and thus are deceptively
quiet. They are dangerous be
cause they are like geologic
time bombs that can erupt with
very little warning," com
mented Dr. Robert Tilling ot
the U.S. Geological Survey.
And the United States is not
immune, added Tilling, chief
of the survey's Office of
Geochemistry and
Geophysics. Besides there are
several others in this country,
some of which resemble Souf
riere, he said.
"In the Cascades we know
that there are some volcanoes
that have the potential for exp
losive eruption," he com
mented, referring to the
Northwest mountain range,
"lassen Peak, Mount Shasta,
Mount Hood, Mount St. He
lens and Mount Baker. have
erupted in the past and can
erupt again in the fulure."
He said his agency is now
monitoring some of these
mountains to watch for signs

that might precede an erup
tion.
"While there is no general
method developed yet for
making predictions of volcanic
eruptions, recent studies . . .
have revealed certain precur
sor signs and patterns prior to
eruptions," Tilling said. He
said eruptions of Kilauea have
been preceded by a swelling of
the ground and swarms of
minor earthquakes.
A growing problem
worldwide, he explained, is
that past eruptions have depo
sited layers of ash and lava
around volcanoes that have
eventually turned into fertile
soil, attracting large popula
tions to the very areas where
they are likely to be affected by
an eruption.
Basically, scientists describe
volcanoes as openings, or
windows, in the surface of the
earth through which molten
rock and gas trom the interior
of the planet can reach the sur
face. Some volcanoes, like
Stromboli in Italy, may erupt
continuously for centuries,
while others lie quiet for a
thousand years and then burst
unexpectedly.
Volcanoes are named for the
Roman god Vulcan, arms
maker for the other gods. The
Romans thought the smoking
mountain Vulcano off the coast
of Italy was the chimney of his
forge.
"If you spot the 500 or so ac
tive volcanoes on a world map
you will see that a great many
of them are located around the
Pacific Ocean," Tilling said.
This circle of activity is called
the "Ring of Fire" and is also
where most of the world's ear
thquakes occur.
Many volcanoes are also
located in and around the
Mediterranean Sea and active
volcanoes also are often found
in the ocean"..
The Haw<tiian Islands were

formed by volcanic activity, as
were many Caribbean islands,
such as St Vincent. A new vol
cano forged its way from under
the sea in 1963 creating the is
land Surtsey near Iceland.
The last major eruption of
Soufriere came on May 6-7,
1902, taking more than 3000
lives. Itocurred in conjunction
with one of the most destruc
tive volcanic eruptions in his
tory, that of Pelee on the island
of Martinique. Pelee exploded
violently a day later, wiping out
the port of St. Pierre, killing
iO,OOO people.
Soufriere is a name given to
several volcanoes that give off
gasses, and the one on St. Vin
cent is also known as Morne
Carou.
Not far away, on
Cuadaloupe, is another vol
cano also called Soufriere. In
between is Martinique.
A prehistoric eruption de
stroyed the summit of the
Soufriere on St. Vincent, form
ing a large crater similar to that
formed on Vesuvius in 79 A.D.
Later eruptions built another
cone inside Soufriere, creating a

double crater.
This volcano also erupted in
1718, 1785 and 1812, taking
lives each time. But it has a
tradition of eruptions even ear
lier. Carib Indians who greeted
Columbus on the island in 1498
lived in fear of the mountain.
An account ot the 1812 erup
tion in Jay Robert Nash 's book
Darkest Hours says the vol
cano's roar was heard in Ven
ezuela and Barbados and adds:
"The imprisoned gasses broke
through the rocky side ot the
mountain with inconceivable
fury and hurled into the
heavens a cloud of shattered
rocks, dust and black volumes
of smoke that for three days
thereatter covered the island
with the darkness of night."
Tilling said that probably the
most disastrous volcanic erup
tion, in terms ot human losses,
in historic time was the IBBi
explosion of the island of
Krakatoa between )ava and
Sumatra. The collapse of that
mountaintop created a great
sea wave that swept over the
heavily populated coastfine of
Java, killing ?6,000 people.

"If you spot the 500 or so ac
tive volcanoes on a world map
you will see that a great many
of them are located around the
Pacific Ocean," Tilling said.
This circle of activity is called
the "Ring of Fire" and is also
where most of the world's ear
thquakes occur.
Many volcanoes are also
located in and around the
Mediterranean Sea and active
volcanoes also are often found
in the ocean"..
The Haw<tiian Islands were

formed by volcanic activity, as
were many Caribbean islands,
such as St Vincent. A new vol
cano forged its way from under
the sea in 1963 creating the is
land Surtsey near Iceland.
The last major eruption of
Soufriere came on May 6-7,
1902, taking more than 3000
lives. Itocurred in conjunction
with one of the most destruc
tive volcanic eruptions in his
tory, that of Pelee on the island
of Martinique. Pelee exploded
violently a day later, wiping out
the port of St. Pierre, killing
iO,OOO people.
Soufriere is a name given to
several volcanoes that give off
gasses, and the one on St. Vin
cent is also known as Morne
Carou.
Not far away, on
Cuadaloupe, is another vol
cano also called Soufriere. In
between is Martinique.
A prehistoric eruption de
stroyed the summit of the
Soufriere on St. Vincent, form
ing a large crater similar to that
formed on Vesuvius in 79 A.D.
Later eruptions built another
cone inside Soufriere, creating a

double crater.
This volcano also erupted in
1718, 1785 and 1812, taking
lives each time. But it has a
tradition of eruptions even ear
lier. Carib Indians who greeted
Columbus on the island in 1498
lived in fear of the mountain.
An account ot the 1812 erup
tion in Jay Robert Nash 's book
Darkest Hours says the vol
cano's roar was heard in Ven
ezuela and Barbados and adds:
"The imprisoned gasses broke
through the rocky side ot the
mountain with inconceivable
fury and hurled into the
heavens a cloud of shattered
rocks, dust and black volumes
of smoke that for three days
thereatter covered the island
with the darkness of night."
Tilling said that probably the
most disastrous volcanic erup
tion, in terms ot human losses,
in historic time was the IBBi
explosion of the island of
Krakatoa between )ava and
Sumatra. The collapse of that
mountaintop created a great
sea wave that swept over the
heavily populated coastfine of
Java, killing ?6,000 people.
Washington (AP) — The
rumblings of the geologic time
bomb known as Soufriere vol
cano come 77 years after that
same mountain spewed forth
death and destruction, taking
more than <000 lives.
But while residents of the
Caribbean island of St. Vincent
know of the danger in their
midst — and no one was killed
in the Friday the 13th eruption
last week — the same hazard
exists in parts of the world
where people are less aware of
the danger.
There are more than 500 ac
tive volcanoes in the world
ranging from the explosive
types, such as Soufriere, to the
non-explosive ones like
Kilauea on Hawaii, which pro
duces streams of highly fluid
lava.
"We consider a volcano ac
tive when it has erupted within
recorded history. Most of the
world's volcanoes are dor
mant and thus are deceptively
quiet. They are dangerous be
cause they are like geologic
time bombs that can erupt with
very little warning," com
mented Dr. Robert Tilling ot
the U.S. Geological Survey.
And the United States is not
immune, added Tilling, chief
of the survey's Office of
Geochemistry and
Geophysics. Besides there are
several others in this country,
some of which resemble Souf
riere, he said.
"In the Cascades we know
that there are some volcanoes
that have the potential for exp
losive eruption," he com
mented, referring to the
Northwest mountain range,
"lassen Peak, Mount Shasta,
Mount Hood, Mount St. He
lens and Mount Baker. have
erupted in the past and can
erupt again in the fulure."
He said his agency is now
monitoring some of these
mountains to watch for signs

that might precede an erup
tion.
"While there is no general
method developed yet for
making predictions of volcanic
eruptions, recent studies . . .
have revealed certain precur
sor signs and patterns prior to
eruptions," Tilling said. He
said eruptions of Kilauea have
been preceded by a swelling of
the ground and swarms of
minor earthquakes.
A growing problem
worldwide, he explained, is
that past eruptions have depo
sited layers of ash and lava
around volcanoes that have
eventually turned into fertile
soil, attracting large popula
tions to the very areas where
they are likely to be affected by
an eruption.
Basically, scientists describe
volcanoes as openings, or
windows, in the surface of the
earth through which molten
rock and gas trom the interior
of the planet can reach the sur
face. Some volcanoes, like
Stromboli in Italy, may erupt
continuously for centuries,
while others lie quiet for a
thousand years and then burst
unexpectedly.
Volcanoes are named for the
Roman god Vulcan, arms
maker for the other gods. The
Romans thought the smoking
mountain Vulcano off the coast
of Italy was the chimney of his
forge.
