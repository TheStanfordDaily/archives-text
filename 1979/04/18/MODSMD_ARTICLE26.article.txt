. Isaac Stern has become one
ol the well-loved elder states
men ol liddledom, both hold
ing torth on all manner ol mus
ic al programs and still perform
ing widely — lo my way ol
thinking, his recent perfor
mance ot the Spring sonata be
fore Begin and Sadaf may have
done as much lor peace in the
Middle East as any other

American initiative. Columbia
records is celebrating Stern's
status hy bringing out a spate
ot new recordings as well as
some long-awaited reissues.
The idea that youth is wasted
on the young should be
strongly supported by vio
linists, because they otten have
their period of greatest inter
pretative know-how when
their technical agility has
begun to diminish.
Even as a youth, ol course,
Isaac Stern was no fool, despite
such indiscretions as recording
a Eranz Waxman transcription
of the Liebestod, and the
Beethoven sonata reissued
here is one of his earliest and
best recordings. Both tone and
intonation are excellent, and
the impetuosity of the piece is
conveyed to the tullest (the
only better recording I have
heard is Busch and Serkin on
Japanese Angel).
The Mo/art sonata is well

done (but compare it to that in
the set by Oscar Shumsky and
Artur Balsam, one of ttie great
modern chamber recordings),
while Stern was also in top
lorm lor the I'rokoliev disc.
Would that all violinists had his
ability to bring color to a single
note or phrase!
As for the new disc ol Mozart
concerti, Stern's knack for
choosing tempos and phrasing
makes most competing ac
counts seem heavy-handed
and abrupt: his intonation is
no longer a strong point, how
ever, and he is starting to
sound a bit wobbly as kreisler
and Elman did in their late re
cordings. I hope Stern is only
having a temporary rough
period the way Menuhin did.
The English Chamber Or
chestra's accompaniment is
just beautilul — black marks to
Columbia's engineers, there
fore, for burying it way behind
the soloist. This is inexcusable.
