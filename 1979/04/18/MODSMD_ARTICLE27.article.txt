Philly Joe Jones' re
emergence on the jazz scene
has certainly been a happy
event for jazz fans. Philly Joe
never really left, but his record
ings and tours had, in recent
years, slowed down to a mere
trickle. The venerable drum
mer from Philadelphia was be
coming, it seemed, more of a
historical figure than a vibrant
force on the music scene.
Fortunately those days have
passed. First Philly Joe toured
(his first in years) with pianist
Bill Evans, and followed up
with several dates as a sideman
for the Fantasy label. Now
Philly Joe has released his first
album in years, as a leader and
the result, as perhaps should
be expected, is a first-rate
blowing session.
Certainly much of the credit
tor this album's success should
go to the fine musicians which
Jones assembled for the date:
Dexter Cordon, Ira Sullivan
(another reclusive jazzman
who has recorded rarely dur
ing the past decade), Ron Car
ter, Nat Adderly and George
Cables. But then again, Jones is
used to playing in fast company
— during the late '50s and early
'60s he went on vinyl with most
ot the great names in the busi
ness.
Special credit should go to

Cables. For the past several
years Cables has been known
as one of the finest supporting
pianists around; he has graced
numerous recordings with his
driving solos and warm ac
companiment. His work on
Philly Mignon is no exception;
his introduction to "Polkadots

and Moonbeams," is in itself a
compelling proof of his talents.
Cables, I would argue, will be
one of the keyboard stars of
the '80s; right now he is known
only to jazz connoisseurs (as
were, 10 years ago, Keith Jar
rett, Chick Corea and Herbie
Hancock), but his sharp play

ing and fine compositions
mark out a flowery future for
him.
Dexter Cordon, perhaps the
most famous musician on the
session, contributes two excel
lent solos. Cordon's warm,
embracing tone gives him one
of the most attractive styles of
any tenor saxophonist.
The Galaxy label, the .ela
tively new jazz label at Fantasy
Records, has again released a
stellar session. Philly |oe Jones,
in the third decade of his re
cording career, sounds better
than ever.
