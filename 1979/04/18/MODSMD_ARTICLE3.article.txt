# Multinational corporations' role in underdeveloped areas debated
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
Two professors disagreed on the
benefits of multinational corpora
tions in underdeveloped countries at
a New Directions symposium here
last week.
)ohn Dunning, chairman of the
economics department at the Uni
versity of Reading in England, and
University Economics Prof. Duncan
Foley spoke at the Business School
Thursday.
Dunning told the audience of
about 40 that "multinational corpora
tions primarily represent a transfer of
natural resources across national
boundaries." As a result, he said,
multinational corporations perform
valuable services because "without
them, resources would not have
been transferred."
"Multinational corporations," said
Foley, a specialist in Marxist
economics, "represent access to re
sources unattainable to these na
tions (host countries of multination
als) by any other means."
However, Foley noted that be
cause multinational corporations
enjoy this power over their host
countries, they "represent tempta
tion and pressure to developing (or
underdeveloped) countries to or
ganize their developing strategies
around the investment tactics of the
multinational corporation."
Speaking first, Foley explained the
significance of multinational corpo
rations in the Third World. "In the
context of poor countries, multina
tional corporations represent over
whelming controlling power," he
said.
Dunning did not deny Foley's as
sertion about the power of multina

tional corporations in developing na
tions and noted that "we've no
machinery for controlling (them)."
Conflict of interest
Foley pointed out that the control
ling power of multinationals in Third
World countries often leads to "the
worst aspects of those that we as
sociate with exploited capitalist
countries."
As a result, he said, "there is al
most inevitable conflict of interest
between the multinational and the
(host) nation â€” state."
Dunning addressed the problems
noted by Foley, outlining "two
courses of action" that home and
host countries should follow. First,
he said, all countries need to in
crease their information about relev
ant multinationals. Second, he
proposed that "foreign countries
behave such that multinational cor
porate action would aid in their de
velopment."
Multinationals more competitive?
According to Dunning, multina
tional corporations are losing some
of their autonomy and are becoming
more competitive. He explained that
"more and more countries are
spawning their own multinational
corporations and this is a good thing
because it fosters competition."
Foley did not reply to Dunning's
assertion about the increasing com
petition between multinationals. In
stead, he concentrated on the effects
of multinational corporations on the
host country. "We have to see them
(multinationals) as posing problems
to these underdeveloped (host
countries)," said Foley, "but these

problems are not historically new."
Foley said "we can't make multina
tional corporations behave like a
nationalized industry." He con
tended host countries and their gov
ernments often cannot control mul
tinational corporate actions.
Dunning said multinational corpo
rations will "continue to be benefi
cial as long as that modality (as a
transferer of natural resources) con
tinues to be more beneficial than that
(provided) by competitive markets."
