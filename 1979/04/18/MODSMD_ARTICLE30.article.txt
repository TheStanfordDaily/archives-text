## Drizzles in the South Pacific 
### 
One can get a pretty good idea about what
to expect from Hurricane simply by paying
careful attention to the opening credits. The
movie has, at the beginning, two things going
for it. The director is Jan Troell, who did the
very fine The Emigrants of a few years ago.
And the cinematographer is Sven Nykvist,
who has had a long, successful working rela
tionship with Ingmar Bergman.
But then comes the stunner. What director
and cameraman are forced to work with is a
script by Lorenzo Semple, Jr. Semple's re
sume isn't quite so sterling. He is best known
for Writing the screenplay for the ill
conceived remake of King Kong.
Dino the trashman
The man who paid all three is Dino De
Laurentiis. The Italian producer is most skil
led at packaging movies that transcend trash
to make schlock. He's responsible for such
films as the aforementioned King Kong and
Lipstick, the film which convinced model
Margaux Hemingway that maybe being an
actress wasn't such a good idea after all.
Now that we know exactly who's involved,
it's time to turn to the movie itself. Hurricane
is a remake of the '30s John Ford classic. This
version takes place in the '20s, was filmed iri
Bora Bora but is set in Samoa, and stars Jason
Robards, Mia Farrow and a man named Day
ton ka'Ne. ka'Ne was a surfer in Hawaii be
fore the casting director spotted him (and is
probably considering returning to the beach
now that Hurricane has turned out to be a
drizzle of a movie).
Robards plays the father of Mia Farrow, the
American girl who falls in love with islander
Dayton Ka'Ne. It's never made clear why she
falls in love with him, she just does. Robards,
a very strict navy man giving his best Hum
phrey Bogart impersonation, gets upset
about the company his daugher is keeping.

Luckily for all concerned, all plot entangle
ments get resolved by the titular wind storm.
The hurricane gives a better performance
than most of the performers; it's sad that the
audience must endure so much hot air be
fore the special effects begin.
This is the kind of movie where an example
of a funny line runs like this. "My daughter's
taken up horse riding in Virginia," says a soc
iety matron. "I thought she looked a little
bow-legged," replies Robards, chuckling de
vilishly. But even that's not nearly as bad as
the things Farrow and ka'Ne say to each other
in the midst of what the film's publicity de
scribes as a torrid affair (I suspect they really
meant "tepid"). Farrow says things like
"Don't ask me to marry you. Just love me."
Ka'Ne replies by looking at her soulfully.
Jaundiced
Technically, the film's not bad, though
Nykvist tends to get carried away with his
yellow filter at times, making all the perfor
mers look as if they might be suffering from
jaundice. The hurricane itself is, for the most
part, effectively staged, and the editors have
expertly blended stock footage and Nykvist
shot studio work.
The trouble is that, by the time the hur
ricane whips across the screen, we really
don't care what happens to the characters.
Our interest in the destruction is clinical,
rather than being rooted in fear for the safety
of characters with whom we do not identify.
Hurricane is a "big" movie, obviously
aimed at those people who yearn for the days
when many movies, like today's television,
were aimed at the 12-year-old mentality. At
times it drops story completely in favor of
travelogue-flavored v.iews of ceremonial
dances and scenic panoramas. If the movie
doesn't even respect its own story line, how
can it expect viewers to?

now that Hurricane has turned out to be a
drizzle of a movie).
Robards plays the father of Mia Farrow, the
American girl who falls in love with islander
Dayton Ka'Ne. It's never made clear why she
falls in love with him, she just does. Robards,
a very strict navy man giving his best Hum
phrey Bogart impersonation, gets upset
about the company his daugher is keeping.

Luckily for all concerned, all plot entangle
ments get resolved by the titular wind storm.
The hurricane gives a better performance
than most of the performers; it's sad that the
audience must endure so much hot air be
fore the special effects begin.
This is the kind of movie where an example
of a funny line runs like this. "My daughter's
taken up horse riding in Virginia," says a soc
iety matron. "I thought she looked a little
bow-legged," replies Robards, chuckling de
vilishly. But even that's not nearly as bad as
the things Farrow and ka'Ne say to each other
in the midst of what the film's publicity de
scribes as a torrid affair (I suspect they really
meant "tepid"). Farrow says things like
"Don't ask me to marry you. Just love me."
Ka'Ne replies by looking at her soulfully.
Jaundiced
Technically, the film's not bad, though
Nykvist tends to get carried away with his
yellow filter at times, making all the perfor
mers look as if they might be suffering from
jaundice. The hurricane itself is, for the most
part, effectively staged, and the editors have
expertly blended stock footage and Nykvist
shot studio work.
The trouble is that, by the time the hur
ricane whips across the screen, we really
don't care what happens to the characters.
Our interest in the destruction is clinical,
rather than being rooted in fear for the safety
of characters with whom we do not identify.
Hurricane is a "big" movie, obviously
aimed at those people who yearn for the days
when many movies, like today's television,
were aimed at the 12-year-old mentality. At
times it drops story completely in favor of
travelogue-flavored v.iews of ceremonial
dances and scenic panoramas. If the movie
doesn't even respect its own story line, how
can it expect viewers to?
