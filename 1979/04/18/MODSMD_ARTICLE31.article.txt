Rhodesia votes on black rule
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Undeterred by threats of
guerrilla violence, blacks and whites turned out in
large numbers yesterday to vote as equals on black
majority rule. A hundred thousand soldiers
guarded against sabotage attempts by black op
position guerrillas.
The 12,000 black guerrillas of the Patriotic Front
alliance of /ambia-based Joshua Nkomo and
Mozambique-based Robert Mugabe have vowed
to sabotage the elections, saying the new govern
ment would be a facade for continued white rule.
Moderate black leaders say privately they had to
promise whites strong representation in the new
government, including control of the security
forces and civil administration for five years, to
attain black majority rule without forcing skilled
whites to flee the country.
Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the black leader fa
vored to become the country's first black prime
minister, predicted yesterday that international
recognition would be inevitable once a popularly
elected government was installed.
In Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city,
black voters chanted and danced as soldiers stood
guard at sandbagged voting booths.
Black American civil rights activist Bayard Rus
tin, in Bulawayo as an unofficial observer, said he
was "exceedingly favorably impressed" by the vot
ing process.
In a move to prevent multiple voting, officials
required that voters' hands be dipped in an indeli
ble liquid that glows under ultraviolet light
machines at each polling place.
Police killed in Irish bombing
Bcssbrook, Northern Ireland — A booby-trap
bomb killed four policemen yesterday in the worst
such incident in a decade of Northern Ireland's
sectarian violence. Twelve other people were in
jured in the explosion, an apparent escalation ol
Ihe Irish Republican Army's spring offensive
against Bi itish rule.
The police were killed when a bomb blew up
their Land Rover as it passed a booby-trapped van
parked on the road, police said. It was the highest
police death toll in a single incident since North
ern Ireland's troubles began in 1969.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility
tor the blast, but police s.iid it had all the signs ol
an IRA ambush.
Police said il appeared the device was detonated
by remote control by a terrorist lying in wait in the
surrounding countryside, a tactic used by the IRA
in the past.
Violence had eased oil in 1978, but guerrillas ol
the predominantly Roman Catholic organization
launched a new onslaught last month to coincide
with the British campaigns leading up to the May 5
national elections.
The IRA has dec lared prison officers, police and
British soldiers prime targets in its campaign to

force Britain out of Northern Ireland.
Among the injured were two sisters, ages 4 and
5, and their father, who was driving a car only a
short distance in front of the police vehicle.
Refugee Amin still at large
Nairobi, Kenya — The whereabouts of ousted
dictator Idi Amin remained a rumor-shrouded
mystery yesterday, a week after the Ugandan capi
tal of Kampala fell to Tanzanians and his exiled
enemies.
While some reports placed him in Libya — pre
sumably a haven since Libyan leader Moam
mar Khadafy has been a staunch ally — others said
he was in his northwestern Uganda tribal home
land. Still others said the self-proclaimed "presi
dent lor life and conqueror of the British Empire"
had fled to a neighboring country.
Wherever he is, Kampala's new government,
still controlling only halt the country, has declared
that Amin will never come back.
During Amin's eight years in power, he often
turned to Libya and other Moslem states for sup
port. Besides Libya, which sent troops to Uganda
in a futile attempt to tight off Ihe Tanzanian forces,
there was a report yesterday that the Palestine
Liberation Organization had sent "50 military men
and 15 Mi(j jet pilots to Uganda to help the embat
tled Amin.
Court ruling may alter libel law
Washington — A rare advance report reveals that
the Supreme Court has decided against the news
media in a ruling that could alter the nation's libel
law. The "leak" may represent a major breach in
the secret deliberations of the court.
In nationally televised reports Monday night
and yesterday morning, ABC News said the court
soon will rule that public figures suing for libel
may ask what a journalist's "state ol mind' was
while preparing the challenged news story.
The report said lustice Byron White is writing
the court's majority opinion, and that Justice Wil
liam Rehnquist is joining White.
It also said that lustice John Paul Stevens argued
during one ot the court's closed conferences —
attended only by the nine justices — that such a
ruling would "c hill tree-press rights.
ABC reporter Tim O'Brien did not reveal the
source ot his story, but said he is "absolutely cer
tain" of Ihe accuracy ol the report.
Such reports, leaking a decision or a particular
vote before it is tormally announced, are rare in
the court's 190-year history.
Securities theft suspects held
Waterbury,Conn. — less than 24 hours after the
bullet-riddled bodies of three Purolator Security
Inc. guards were tound near their armored truck,
police arrested two unemployed couples yester

day and recovered the $1.8 million in cash and
valuables that were stolen.
"We were fortunate. We were lucky," Police I t.

guards back."
If convicted of capital murder, the tour — all
unidentified — could be sentenced to death.

mystery yesterday, a week after the Ugandan capi
tal of Kampala fell to Tanzanians and his exiled
enemies.
While some reports placed him in Libya — pre

mar Khadafy has been a staunch ally — others said
he was in his northwestern Uganda tribal home
land. Still others said the self-proclaimed "presi
dent lor life and conqueror of the British Empire"
had fled to a neighboring country.
Wherever he is, Kampala's new government,
still controlling only halt the country, has declared
that Amin will never come back.
During Amin's eight years in power, he often
turned to Libya and other Moslem states for sup
port. Besides Libya, which sent troops to Uganda
in a futile attempt to tight off Ihe Tanzanian forces,
there was a report yesterday that the Palestine
Liberation Organization had sent "50 military men

Washington — A rare advance report reveals that
the Supreme Court has decided against the news
media in a ruling that could alter the nation's libel
law. The "leak" may represent a major breach in
the secret deliberations of the court.

liam Rehnquist is joining White.
It also said that lustice John Paul Stevens argued
during one ot the court's closed conferences —
attended only by the nine justices — that such a
ruling would "c hill tree-press rights.
ABC reporter Tim O'Brien did not reveal the
source ot his story, but said he is "absolutely cer
tain" of Ihe accuracy ol the report.
Such reports, leaking a decision or a particular
vote before it is tormally announced, are rare in
the court's 190-year history.

Flood-stricken Southerners flee
Jackson, Miss. — Hundreds of residents
downstream ot flooded lackson fled their homes
yesterday as the surging Pearl River defied fore

17,000 persons already have been flooded out in
the metropolitan area. Sandbag levees designed
to stem the rising Pearl were holding.
Evacuations were under way in the downstream
cities of Georgetown, Monticello and Columbia,
where officials said as many as 2000 persons might
leave.
President |immy Carter on Monday designated
the state a disaster area, making thousands ot
flood victims eligible for federal assistance. In ad

Rhodesia votes on black rule
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Undeterred by threats of
guerrilla violence, blacks and whites turned out in
large numbers yesterday to vote as equals on black
majority rule. A hundred thousand soldiers
guarded against sabotage attempts by black op
position guerrillas.
The 12,000 black guerrillas of the Patriotic Front
alliance of /ambia-based Joshua Nkomo and
Mozambique-based Robert Mugabe have vowed
to sabotage the elections, saying the new govern
ment would be a facade for continued white rule.
Moderate black leaders say privately they had to
promise whites strong representation in the new
government, including control of the security
forces and civil administration for five years, to
attain black majority rule without forcing skilled
whites to flee the country.
Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the black leader fa
vored to become the country's first black prime
minister, predicted yesterday that international
recognition would be inevitable once a popularly
elected government was installed.
In Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city,

In a move to prevent multiple voting, officials
required that voters' hands be dipped in an indeli
