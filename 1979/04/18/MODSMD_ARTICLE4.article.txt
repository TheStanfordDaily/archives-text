# Districting amendment, at last
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
After a week of shifting from one side to the other,
ASSU Elections Commissioner Dayna Goldfine decided
last night to place an election districting proposal on
today's ballot as a constitutional amendment.
Eor the past seven days, the issue has been argued
vehemently by the ASSU Senate and the Council of
Presidents (COP). One moment a supposedly definitive
solution would be announced, which would soon be
eloquently refuted.
The drama began last Tuesday when the senate could
not obtain the necessary 14 votes for the proposal to
appear on the ballot as a constitutional amendment. It
voted, instead, to have the issue considered as a re
ferendum, which would not be officially binding.
Eight determined senators decided to take another
tack that night by circulating petitions among the stu
dent body to gather the required 611 (5 percent of the
student body, according to last quarter's registration
files) signatures to mold the issues into a constitutional
amendment.

News analysis

The ASSU Constitution recognizes both the senate
vote and the student body petition as legitimate
methods to include a constitutional amendment on an
election ballot for ratification by the students.
Yet Article VII, Section 2 distinguishes those amend
ments created by a two-thirds vote of the senate from
those originating from student petitions. That section
specifies, "Petitions proposing amendments shall be
submitted to the Council of Presidents of the Associa
tion, who shall direct the Elections Commission to con
duct an election on the amendment in not less than six
nor more than 24 days after the opening of the following
quarter."
When shown this section Wednesday, COP member
Andrew Goldenkranz ruled that the petitioned district
ing proposal could not constitutionally appear on a bal
lot as a constitutional amendment before autumn quar
ter. He told Coldfine that the proposal would remain on
this quarter's ballot only as a referendum.
Because of a lack of communication, according to
senate parliamentarian Roc Blumenthal, the senate did
not reply to Coldenkranz's action until Monday.
Then, Blumenthal and senate chairperson George
Drysdale interpreted the appropriate clause as referring
only to the case of a special election. They concluded
that the time stipulation was not applicable to the pre
sent situation of a regularly scheduled election. They
authorized Goldfine to place the districting question on
the ballot as a constitutional amendment.
Anticipatinganothervetoora refusal of verification by
Goldenkranz, Blumenthal determined that the COP had

no such power.
Article 11, Section 6 ot the constitution states that "The
Senate shall have the power to interpret this Constitu
tion and the By-Laws of the Association." Thus, Blu
menthal contended that the COP could notlnterpret the
constitution and that the senate's interpretation was the
ultimate one.
Furthermore, Blumenthal held that "as chairperson,
George ( Drysdale) represents the senate between meet
ings and has the authority to make decisions for the
senate between meetings." He said that Drysdale's is the
official action of the senate until the senate votes upon
that action at its next meeting, which will probably be
tomorrow.
"He (Goldenkranz) hasn't the right to veto it (the
amendment on the ballot)," Blumenthal continued. He
cited Article 111, Section 1 ot the constitution, which says,
"The Council of Presidents shall have the right to veto
any bill or resolution passed by the Senate."
"The COP cannot veto an interpretation, which is an
opinion," Blumenthal said.
finally, since Goldenkranz verified the districting
proposal as a referendum, he cannot withhold its verifi
cation as an amendment, according to Blumenthal. The
verification process is the same for referenda and
amendments, he asserted.
In a letter presented to the Daily yesterday, Golden
kranz said that he still adheres to his original belief that
the senate is in violation of the constitution.
The final decision rested last night with the Elections
Commission. COP member Regina Petty said, "The con
stitution directs the COP to handle the elections." How
ever, Assistant Elections Commissioner Chris Noonan
lamented that, "We're also directly responsible to the
senate. It's like we're caught in the middle and getting
squeezed."
Goldfine revealed that Goldenkranz had sent her a
notice yesterday afternoon, validating the signatures
given him by Sen. |ohn Struthers and directing the Elec
tions Commission to place the "distric ting proposal" on
the autumn 1979 ballot.
At 10:15 p.m. last night, Goldfine confirmed that the
districting proposal will be a constitutional amendment
on today's ballot. "I feel really bad that I've gone back
and forth so much," she said.
Voting materials on the issue will be contradictory and
confusing. The election pamphlet, printed before Gol
denkranz's veto, enumerates the districting proposal as
"Constitutional Amendment f>." The master ballot and
the marker ballot, printed after consultation with Gol
denkranz, contain the districting plan as a referendum.
To clarify the proposal's status, a flier, stating that
"When you vote for R4 (Referendum 4), you are voting
for A 6 (Constitutional Amendment (>)," will be distri
buted at the polls, Assistant Elections Commissioner
Mike Browning said.

Then, Blumenthal and senate chairperson George
Drysdale interpreted the appropriate clause as referring
only to the case of a special election. They concluded
that the time stipulation was not applicable to the pre
sent situation of a regularly scheduled election. They
authorized Goldfine to place the districting question on
the ballot as a constitutional amendment.
Anticipatinganothervetoora refusal of verification by
Goldenkranz, Blumenthal determined that the COP had

no such power.
Article 11, Section 6 ot the constitution states that "The
Senate shall have the power to interpret this Constitu
tion and the By-Laws of the Association." Thus, Blu
menthal contended that the COP could notlnterpret the
constitution and that the senate's interpretation was the
ultimate one.
Furthermore, Blumenthal held that "as chairperson,
George ( Drysdale) represents the senate between meet
ings and has the authority to make decisions for the
senate between meetings." He said that Drysdale's is the
official action of the senate until the senate votes upon
that action at its next meeting, which will probably be
tomorrow.
"He (Goldenkranz) hasn't the right to veto it (the
amendment on the ballot)," Blumenthal continued. He
cited Article 111, Section 1 ot the constitution, which says,
"The Council of Presidents shall have the right to veto
any bill or resolution passed by the Senate."
"The COP cannot veto an interpretation, which is an
opinion," Blumenthal said.
finally, since Goldenkranz verified the districting
proposal as a referendum, he cannot withhold its verifi
cation as an amendment, according to Blumenthal. The
verification process is the same for referenda and
amendments, he asserted.
In a letter presented to the Daily yesterday, Golden
kranz said that he still adheres to his original belief that
the senate is in violation of the constitution.
The final decision rested last night with the Elections
Commission. COP member Regina Petty said, "The con
stitution directs the COP to handle the elections." How
ever, Assistant Elections Commissioner Chris Noonan
lamented that, "We're also directly responsible to the
senate. It's like we're caught in the middle and getting
squeezed."
Goldfine revealed that Goldenkranz had sent her a
notice yesterday afternoon, validating the signatures
given him by Sen. |ohn Struthers and directing the Elec
tions Commission to place the "distric ting proposal" on
the autumn 1979 ballot.
At 10:15 p.m. last night, Goldfine confirmed that the
districting proposal will be a constitutional amendment
on today's ballot. "I feel really bad that I've gone back
and forth so much," she said.
Voting materials on the issue will be contradictory and
confusing. The election pamphlet, printed before Gol
denkranz's veto, enumerates the districting proposal as
"Constitutional Amendment f>." The master ballot and
the marker ballot, printed after consultation with Gol
denkranz, contain the districting plan as a referendum.
To clarify the proposal's status, a flier, stating that
"When you vote for R4 (Referendum 4), you are voting
for A 6 (Constitutional Amendment (>)," will be distri
buted at the polls, Assistant Elections Commissioner
Mike Browning said.
After a week of shifting from one side to the other,
ASSU Elections Commissioner Dayna Goldfine decided
last night to place an election districting proposal on
today's ballot as a constitutional amendment.
Eor the past seven days, the issue has been argued
vehemently by the ASSU Senate and the Council of
Presidents (COP). One moment a supposedly definitive
solution would be announced, which would soon be
eloquently refuted.
The drama began last Tuesday when the senate could
not obtain the necessary 14 votes for the proposal to
appear on the ballot as a constitutional amendment. It
voted, instead, to have the issue considered as a re
ferendum, which would not be officially binding.
Eight determined senators decided to take another
tack that night by circulating petitions among the stu
dent body to gather the required 611 (5 percent of the
student body, according to last quarter's registration
files) signatures to mold the issues into a constitutional
amendment.

News analysis

The ASSU Constitution recognizes both the senate
vote and the student body petition as legitimate
methods to include a constitutional amendment on an
election ballot for ratification by the students.
Yet Article VII, Section 2 distinguishes those amend
ments created by a two-thirds vote of the senate from
those originating from student petitions. That section
specifies, "Petitions proposing amendments shall be
submitted to the Council of Presidents of the Associa
tion, who shall direct the Elections Commission to con
duct an election on the amendment in not less than six
nor more than 24 days after the opening of the following
quarter."
When shown this section Wednesday, COP member
Andrew Goldenkranz ruled that the petitioned district
ing proposal could not constitutionally appear on a bal
lot as a constitutional amendment before autumn quar
ter. He told Coldfine that the proposal would remain on
this quarter's ballot only as a referendum.
Because of a lack of communication, according to
senate parliamentarian Roc Blumenthal, the senate did
not reply to Coldenkranz's action until Monday.
