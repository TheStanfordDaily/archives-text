Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, a Medical School radiology pro
fessor, has won the first Charles F. Kettering Prize for his
research on Hodgkin's disease, the General Motors
Cancer Research Foundation announced Thursday.
Kaplan, one of three selected to receive the annual
GM cancer research prizes, will receive a gold medal and
a tax-free $100,000 award May 2 in Washington, D.C.
He began his research on Hodgkin's disease 25 years
ago. During that time, major advances have been made
in the treatment of the illness, a cancer of the lymph
nodes.
A foundation statement said that although no one is
wholly responsible for a scientific advance, "Dr. Kaplan
is considered the dominant figure in the reversal of this
grim future for Hodgkin's patients.
"Today, Hodgkin's disease is one of the most curable
of cancers," the foundation statement continued.
Medical linear accelerator
Working in the 1950s with University physicists, led by
Dr. Edward Ginzton, a trustee, Kaplan helped develop
the first medical linear accelerator and foresaw its use in
cancer treatment.
He has developed methods which show how other
organs of the lymph system are involved in the cancer
process, and he has demonstrated that radiation acti

vates a latent cancer-causing virus which causes
leukemia in mice.
"This was a major contribution," the foundation said,
"showing that, at least in mice, some cancers are partly
caused by viruses." However, Kaplan said this research
was unrelated to the clinical work for which he received
the award last week.
Kaplan said that a radiation technique is now used
with chemotherapy for patients in advanced stages of
the disease and that the cure rate has shown a rapid
increase.
Since 1961, more than 80 percent of patients have
survived for five years and 62 percent for 10 years or
more. The last five years have been "a period of great
improvement," Kaplan said, adding that since 1974, 90
percent are alive at five years and 80 percent are free of
relapse.
Rapid breakthrough 'unrealistic'
Kaplan said it is unrealistic to expect a rapid break
through in cancer treatment, because it is a generic
disease. He added that some concepts developed for
treatment of Hodgkin's disease may be applied to other
diseases, but he said progress is gradual and work first
must be done to overcome the difficulties of cancer.
Kaplan is D'Ambrogio professor of radiology and di
rector of the University's Cancer Biology Research
Laboratory.
