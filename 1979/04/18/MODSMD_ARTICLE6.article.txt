# Public affairs exec: his job is protection, not public relations
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
This man is in the protection
business. It's something he
treely admits and it's some
thing that many people know
about. But it's not the kind of
protection you hear about in
the movies.
The man is Robert
Rosenzweig, the University's
vice president for public af
fairs. "I really believe univer
sities are very important in
stitutions. They need to be pro
tected from people who would
misuse them," he stated.
The six-foot, 47-year-old vice
president has been doing just
that since he came to the Uni
versity in 1962 as a lecturer in
political science. In 1967 he be
came associate provost and in
1971 he moved up to vice pro
vost and adviser to the presi
dent. He assumed his current
job in 1974, becoming the tirst
vice president for public af
fairs.
Rosenzweig said he is con
cerned about those
people,such as political ac
tivists, who attempt to use the
University for their own politi
cal purposes. He is also often
defending the University from
government encroachment
which threatens its indepen
dence.
Rosenzweig insists he is not
a public relations man. "I don't
know anything about public re
lations," he said. "The best
public relations for Stanford
University is to tell the truth
about the place.''

The University has "a duty to
inform the public," even if it
"involves saying things about
people they just as soon keep
quiet." But the good out
weighs the bad by so much
here, he explained, that it does
not need to worry about re
porting the truth.
Rosenzweig is so straight
forward, according to Robert
Freelen, the associate vice
president for public affairs,
that he has "on occasion got
ten trapped by being candid."
Student protestors, whom
Rosenzweig has often had to
deal with, depict him as evasive
and insincere, said Larry Hor
ton, the director of govern
ment relations working under
Rosenzweig. But, in fact, "it's
hard to find someone more di
rect and who says exactly what
he is going to do and why he's
going to do it."
Both Freelen and Horton
agree that the force with which
Rosenzweig presents his ar
guments sometimes over
whelms people who "won't
argue back with force and can
dor" as Horton put it.
Rosenzweig has a calm, but
intent directness that hits you
instantly when you meet him.
His mild manner masks a
keenly critical mind.
English Prof. William Chace
said Rosenzweig has "street
smarts," which is "not a quality
you find in many university
administrators." Rosenzweig is
"good under fire" and ne is
"the last person to be snowed
by anything," Chase said.
Although Rosenzweig is an
academic (he has a Ph.D. in
political science from Yale), his
speech and writing are devoid
of the formal and abstract
phrases that menace the
academic world, Chace said.
In keeping with this assess
ment, Rosenzweig has a simple
prescription for fighting gov
ernment and other outside in
cursions into the University:
You have to holler like hell.
Rosenzweig has indeed
been doing a lot of hollering
about a lot of issues. He is con
vinced that it will do some good
simply because it already has.
In 1976 Congress passed
legislation that would have

forced medical schools across
the nation to admit American
medical students studying ab
road or face a cutoff of federal
funds. Schools might have
been compelled to accept stu
dents not meeting regular ad
missions standards.

Rosenzweig said other uni
versities feared that calling tor a
revision of the bill that con
tained the mandate might risk
subjecting if to further and
perhaps unfavorable changes.
But Rosenzweig neverthe
less took his cause to
Washington where he himself
had once worked for the U.S.
Office of Education. He also
brought it before the public
through the press. Eventually,
Congress amended the legisla
tion making it less demanding
on the admissions question
and ending the threat to c ut oft
federal money.
"We don't have to be victims
of some impersonal late," he
explained. But in order to light
"City Hall," universities have to
be "willing to make some sac
rifices" and "turn down some
money."
Chace characterized
Rosenzweig as "one of the
sharpest people around the
University." Rosenzweig's in
tellect and what Horton calls
his "great capacity tor distilling
common sense" are combined
with an extremely wry, sar
donic wit.
In a letter which appeared in
the Daily, Rosenzweig re

sponded to two student ac
tivists who had written in
promising a revolution here
that coming spring. He faceti
ously ottered advice on
revolution-making based on
his experiences in "the last re
volution."
Rosenzweig wrote, "Re
volutionaries must learn by
heart the battle cry of 20th cen
tury revolutions: You can't
make an omelet without break
ing eggs (sometimes pro
nounced heads'). The motto is
equally true for souffles, but it
is always omelets that re
volutionaries are making. I
guess they don't like souffles."
While he may mock student
activists in their calls for re
volution, he certainly does not
oppose airing of their opin
ions. "The institution ought to
be open to the expression of
the widest variety of views."
No one should be prevented
from speaking, he said. "This is
central to the meaning of a uni
versity."
Rosenzweig, who was on the
committee that selected Daniel
Moynihan as the 1975 com
mencement speaker, was ver
bally attacked when he vigor
ously detended Moynihan's
right to speak after Moynihan
came under criticism from the
black community here.
Blacks were upset thnt the
man who had advocated "be
nign neglect" of racial matters
a few years before was going to
speak at commencement. Sev
eral letters appeared in the
Djily protesting Moynihan's
selection.
Rosenzweig responded pub
licly that it was simply wrong to
deny Moynihan the right to
speak on the grounds that
some people disapproved ot
things he had said.
Chace explained that
Rosenzweig, when he has
been called upon to deal with
protestors, says, as a professor
might in a classroom, "Let's
look at ycSur arguments. It you
have a good case we'll listen to
it."
Horton described
Rosenzweig as "fiercely inde
pendent" in his thinking, not
bound by preconceptions.
Chace said that "some ot the
radical students gained respect
tor him."
And some did not. Some see
his i nature as a
myth. "He climbed through
the hierarchy by tollowing or
ders," said L enny Siegel, a stu

dent at the University from
1966 to 1972. Siegel conceded,
however, thai "It seemed he
believed in what he was do-
ing."
But a lot of administrators at
the lime thought they were
protecting the University,
when they were really just de-

fighting outside incursions into the

lending a lot of military work
on campus," Siegel said.
)ohn Shoch, a long time stu
dent who has also worked and
taught at the University ex
pressed similar feelings in
pointing up Rosenzweig's
close association with Univer
sity President Richard Lyman.
"Bob Rosenzweig, isn't he the
former director of minority af
fairs who became Dick Lyman's
Harry Hopkins?" he said allud
ing to 112 ranklin D. Roosevelt's

right hand man.
1 yman said if is "very natural
lor someone in public affairs"
to speak with protestors, but
that "it's not the kind of thing
where I bark out orders' to
him.
Rosenzweig, a Palo Alto re
sident, makes time for private

affairs, too. He likes to spend
time at home with his wife,
Adelle, and son David.
Rosenzweig also has a daugh
ter, Kathryn, who attends the
University.
"I like to play tennis badly,"
he said. Also he is an inveter
ate thriller reader" and some
times he just likes "to lie
around and do nothing."
Bui Rosenzweig also loves to
travel. He has a special passion
for Greece and he likes to visit

fngland, "when it's open."
Rosen/weig h.ts written
m.iny articles on the problems
of higher education and he is
currently working on a hook
that will probably be his defini
tive statement on the increas
ing politic i/ation of univer
sities. He said that universities
are "intrinsically inept" at poli
tics. One reason is that they
lack the traditional institutions
of negotiation and com
promise of society at large such
as political parties.
In society at large, quickly
shifting alliances that are
necessary lor political actions
keep opponents from destroy
ing one another. They may
need each other tomorrow for
a different project, he
explained.
But groups that use the uni
versities for their own political
purposes are "destructive"
toward their opponents and
encourage "a kind of divisive
ness."
And that's just the sort of
thing Rosenzweig is trying to
protect the University from.
