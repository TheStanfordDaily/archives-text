# Jaws snores off Mexico

Isla de Mujeres, Mexico (AP)
â€” This is the place where
laws snores.
In 60-foot deep Carib
bean caves off the Yucatan
coast, man-eating Requiem
sharks and other finny
fiends doze as docile as
tourists or the natives at
siesta time in the shade of a
sombrero.
Macho Mexican divers
with names like El Zorro (the
fox) and El Canon (the can
non) swim up alongside the
sleeping 18-foot monsters
to nudge them and even try
to lift them.
Occasionally a tourist
with diving experience will
strap on an oxygen tank and
take the plunge to eyeball
the basking carnivores.
Most visitors to the Yuca
tan, however, content
themselves with the purch
ase of a T-shirt with the cari
cature of a shark logging
z-z-z-z-z's or hang around
the diving shacks waiting for

the professionals to return
in their lobster boats from
the shark caves.
Don't know why
Marine biologists are not
quite sure why the sharks
choose the ocean caves off
the Yucatan for their slum
bers, although pregnancy
may be a factor. It was previ
ously thought that the shark
was nature's No. 1 insom
niac, that he was fated to
swim unceasingly with his
mouth open and his power
ful fins and tail constantly
churning in order to keep
the oxygen-rich water flow
ing over his gills.
Now it appears the sharks
come to Mexico for the
same reasons as the winter
tourists: to get away from it
all, catch a little rest and
maybe like the marijuana
crowd zonked out on reef
ers, enter a torpid nar
cotized state induced by
the natural conditions

found in the caves beneath
the reefs.
Scientists have found that
the seas off the peninsula
have a strange tranquilizing
effect on the shark. Fresh
water seems to help the
shark breathe. The water
also has a higher oxygen
content, higher acidity and
higher carbon dioxide, all of
which enable the shark to
take a break from his con
stant swimming. Some sci
entists think the fresh and
salt water current moving
through the caves activate
the sharks.
A high shark?
There is another theory
that the coming together of
fresh and salt water has a
hallucinogenic effect so that
the shark actually gets high.
In his comatose state, the
shark is rarely bothered by
the powerful lights turned
on him by marine biologists
to wake him up.
