# First time since 1968 walkout
## Students attend UN simulation 
### Andrea James 
Ten "representatives" of the German Democ
ratic Republic left their homes on campus this
morning to fly to Los Angeles for meetings with
1500 other United Nations "delegates."
The 10 East German "delegates", all students
here, are participants in this year's Model UN of
the Far West. This is the first time since 1968 that
Stanford students have joined the other 130
west coast schools in the UN simulation.
Ironically, Stanford was instrumental in
founding the western organization in 1951, ac
cording to Laura Martin, Stanford's Ambassador
from East Germany to the United Nations. But
because of the 1968 delegates' unwillingness to
support a pro-Vietnam War stand, Stanford
walked out of the sessions.
"One of the rules of the simulation is that the
delegates must represent the views of their
country in committee meetings," Martin
explained. "In 1968, the Stanford delegates rep
resented the United States but they refused to
carry out a pro-war stand. The committee
chairman warned them of the rules, but Stan
ford walked out of the meetings."
Today, students have no intention of not rep
resenting the policies of East Germany. With the
help of Asst. to the President Robert
Hamrdla, who Martin said has "extensive know
ledge of East German policies," the 10 represen
tatives have researched the Republic's stand on
disarmament, human rights, terrorism and
South Africa.
Hamrdla is accompanying the students to Los
Angeles, where he will serve as their adviser.
"By the time we had decided to go ahead and

participate in the UN simulation and had sub
mitted our applications, there were only a few
countries left that we could represent ." Martin
said. "We decided on East Germany, as it
seemed to be a more substantial, more impor
tant country than the others which remained."
Looking for flaws
The simulation "gives students an opportun
ity to learn about American foreign policies by
taking an anti-American stance," Martin
explained. "You end up looking for flaws in our
system."
Martin was one of the main persons responsi
ble for returning Stanford participation to the
simulation.
"I had joined a similar organization at Har
vard," she explained. "Seven other schools in
the Boston area used to meet in the Sheraton-
Boston for UN simulations. When I transferred
out here, I found Stanford could participate in
the Far West group."
A few phone calls to organizing committees in
Los Angeles, and Stanford had applications for
this year's simulation.
This winter, 40 students applied for Stanford's
delegate posts to the simulation. Eight students
were accepted by a panel of three students and
staff members, with Martin and Hamrdla taking
the other two seats.
Cost for the group is about $800 including
hotel rooms and meals, Martin said. She added
that this came from seven funding sources, ancf
that the students are paying their own air fare.
The "delegates" will return to Palo Alto
Saturday.
