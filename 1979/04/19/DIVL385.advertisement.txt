Ski season
. isn't oyer,
its just warming up.
Sauaw Valley and Alpine Meadows, with a
little help from Mother Nature, present the
Endless Winter.
On most days, the bright Hiqh Sierra sun will
warm you as you move effortlessly through the
"corn snow." If you've never skied "corn snow,"
you're in for a treat, because the combination of
nighttime cold and warm sun creates a skiing
surface you literally glide over.
Not only is the sun warmer, it stays out longer,
giving you more time on the slopes. You can ski
longer, dress more comfortably; enjoy the
convenience of shorter lift lines and the freedom
of uncrowded runs.
Try super spring skiing at Squaw or Alpine.
