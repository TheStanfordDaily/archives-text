# Educator reports of deteriorating standards at nation's universities
## 
### Craig Comstock 
Washington â€” A widely respected
educator came here yesterday to
warn his colleagues, in a public meet
ing, about a "deterioration" in ethi
cal standards governing key areas of
college life.
Speaking for the Carnegie Council
on Policy Studies in Higher Educa
tion, Chairman Clark Kerr drew at
tention to increased cheating by stu
dents, widespread misuse of federal
student loans, growing theft of cam
pus property, such as library books,
and unethical practices employed by
colleges and universities in the grow
ing competition, on every level, for
student enrollments.
Kerr is former president of UC-
Berkeley.
According to Kerr's report, re
leased at the annual meeting of the
American Association for Higher
Education (AAHE), these practices
include misleading advertising in col

lege catalogues and elsewhere,
grade inflation by individual profes
sors and the awarding of academic
credit by some departments and in
stitutions for inadequate work. At
tending the AAHE conference were
2500 administrators, faculty and
specialists in higher education.
Prior to the release of the report,
Kerr told the Daily that the Carnegie
Council hesitated before taking up
these explosive issues. "We had
quite a debate, not over whether the
facts were right, but over the ques
tion of whether it was wise for people
in highereducation to draw attention
to these facts," Kerr said.
The Council decided however,
that "if it's true we ought to say so
and say what we think could be
done."
According to the Carnegie report,
the deterioration is likely to continue
as faculty departments and colleges
engage in an increasingly "frantic

search" for scarce students in the
1980s and beyond.
Unless the abuses are corrected,
Kerr said, public confidence in the
integrity of higher education could
be shaken as it was during the drama
tic disruptions of the '60s.
Quoting a good friend without
naming him, Kerr evoked a vision of a
time, quite soon, when "the presi
dent of the campus anyplace is going
to look more and more to the public
and to parents of students like a used
car salesman and the campus more
and more like a used car lot."
If the necessary reforms are
adopted, said Kerr, this vision "need
not come true, but it's a warning of
what otherwise might happen."
In particular, Kerr called for the re
placement of the present system of
federal student loans, noting that the
rate of fraud, error and abuse in the
National Direct Student Loan Prog
ram runs in the range of 15 to 20 per
cent.
The way the loans are now set up,
he said, is "corrupt and corrupting,"
and in his view the federal govern
ment thus bears as much responsibil
ity forcurrent abuses as students do.
Asked how to deal with unethical
forms of competition for enrollment,
Kerr called for "some self-restraint
by institutions and by professors."
As an example of a "modest" reform,
which followed three years of debate
among the UC faculty, he mentioned
a proposal to "show on transcripts
not only the grade the student got

but the average (of all grades given
by the instructor in the course)."
More generally, Kerr recom
mended that all institutions develop
explicit codes of rights and respon
sibilities through the cooperation of
administrators, faculty ana students.
Kerr quoted William James that "no
priesthood ever reforms itself."
He said that reform usually has to
be forced from the outside, but he
argued that higher education, with
its many "centers of initiative"
should be capable of doing for itself
what may otherwise be imposed by
various governmental bodies.
To emphasize the urgency of cam
pus ethics as an issue, Kerr noted that
the Federal Trade Commission is dis
cussing an extension to non-profit
institutions of rules it has already
applied to proprietary schools;
moreover, courts have begun to treat
college catalogues as "implicit con
tracts" between students and their
institutions.
In the 91-page report released yes
terday, the Carnegie Council urges a
wide range of reforms by higher
education, including full and fair
consumer information about col
leges, the development of "equita
ble, easily navigable and publicized
grievance procedures," clear and
firm penalties for academic dishon
esty and an enlarged role for regional
accrediting groups in examining
ethical practices at campuses they
visit.
