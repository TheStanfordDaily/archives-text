# The

It seems appropriate that spring, with its
sunny get-out-and-do-something days of con
stant growth and regeneration is the time for
students to choose residences for next year.
Such a choice should be made with such ideals
of growth and vitality in mind.
The trite aphorisms we've all heard have truth
which becomes increasingly apparent as the
void beyond graduation approaches: "Most of
your important learning is not done in a clas
sroom," and"the greatest educational resource
here is the students."
Major benefits the University bestows on its
undergraduates are not in the classroom, but in
an interesting, capable and by at least some
measures, diverse student population. We age,
like wine, for four years in this environment.
Much of this aging takes place in our living envi
ronments.
Fortunately, the University has several living
options besides standard dorms and frats: the
trailers, theme and other row houses, Mirrielees
apartments and various off-campus living situa
tions. It is those living situations that involve
close contact with other people, perhaps diffe
rent types of people than you would get to know
on your own, that I want to discuss.
My advice, from the reflective position of a
Soon-to-be graduate of this wine vat, is to try
something different next year. Pick your living
situation not on the probability that you will get
a single, but rather on the fertility of the social
soil, the potential for exposure to new ideas,
values and life styles, the chance to try out your
ideals and on the room for change and growth
and learning.
For instance, consider the Row, the type of
housing with which I am most familiar.Thereare
37 houses, including 13 fraternities, ranging
from various cultural theme houses to socially
active organic cooperatives to just plain laid
back, nice places to live. Each provides an op

portunity to get to know 30 to 50 new people,
and perhaps a chance to try out French, Italian
or German culture, or to learn how to make
whole-wheat bread and yogurt.
If you pick a coop, you can find out what it's
like to take a greater responsibility for your own
life.
Along with 30-odd other people you will par
ticipate in cooking, cleaning and basic
decision-making involved in running a com
munity, rather than simply accepting the living
structures provided by the University.
Consider other options as well. You can learn
a lot about yourself and one or two other people
by living in the trailers or Mirrielees. Or escape
the University system completely and try an
off-campus house with some friends or with a
new group of people. And don't forget the
fraternity ideal or the potentials of dorm life.
Each possibility may work out better for diffe
rent people.
The important thing is to choose your living
environment with enthusiasm, rather than de
fensively. There is more variety than you might
think, and more potential for benefit from new
experiences within each of us. Four years isn't
long; the opportunities for new experiences
and personal growth will not exist again for
many of us.
But such ideals are easily lost in the mad
scramble of the housing draw, with its priorities,
draw numbers and rushes. How many singles
does this dorm have? Does this frat have a
jacuzzi? What's the sun-tanning potential for
this row house? How far is it from the post of
fice? Perhaps using such objective criteria
makes choosing a living situation easier, but
such an approach may miss some of the most
important and satisfying possibilities for educa
tion and growth here.
