## Learn the lessons of war 
### 
What if they held a war and
nobody came?
This relic of the Vietnam War
rolled through my mind re
cently as I contemplated re
ports of an impending draft.
I was a conscientious objec
tor during the Vietnam War —
still am, I guess. But not for re
; ligious reasons. I'm not a re
ligious person. I don't believe
in God or life after death.
I am a conscientious objec
tor because I believe life is all
we have. Life is good, because
it is better than the alternative,
which is nothing. Even a miser
able life is better than none,
because it always holds some
chance, however slim, of im
provement. Death holds no
chance of anything. There's no
future in it.
But people will have wars. "I
believe in fighting for my way
of life." "I believe in fighting to
keep the oil imports flowing,
so I can continue to drive my
van and run my electric tooth
brush."
Maybe some of these
reasons sound like good ones
to us, the Stanford elite, who
will be the surest beneficiaries
of our precious American way
of life. But are we sure that war
• will achieve what we want? Are
we so sure that we are willing
to kill and die?
I can't tell what is right.
Maybe wars should be al
lowed, but limited to consent
ing adults. I think it better they
should kill themselves with
drugs. It's less destructive.
When President Richard
Nixon was drummed out of the
White House, and the nation
was still in angry shock, a

Chinese statesman was
amused to see the American
people so riled. What did they
expect? Didn't they know that
he who will be led will inevita
bly be misled? Didn't they
know that no leader can be a
god? Or never make a mistake?
Several years ago I returned
to my home town after many
years away. Walking along a
sunny road by the cemetery, I
was stunned to see the graves
tone of my good friend Paul.
Paul was a small, kind person
with a benevolent sense of
humor— a pleasure to be with.
Now all that was left was a
polished granite slab that re
flected the anguish in my eyes:
Paul Frink
1949-1970
Vietnam
"You poor fool," I thought.

"You poor, silly, stupid fool.
What in all the heavens did you
hope to gain that could not
have been yours here and now,
if you had only grasped a hand
instead of a gun?"
Now as I walk the campus
passing from class to class, I
look at all the young people,
the ones I know and the ones I
don't know, and I wonder how
many of them, too, will soon
be lying under cold stones.
What will have justified it?
There must be a better way
to conduct human affairs.
People have not learned the
lesson of the Vietnam War, so
recently passed. The lesson of
that war is the same as the les
son of every war — "Don't be
misled."
