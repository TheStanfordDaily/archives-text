## Ayatollah Brown travels to Africa 
### 
Upon the absence of the
Governor from the State, the
Lieutenant Governor assumes
all duties and responsibilities.
California Constitution, Article
11, section 4.
Lt. Gov. Mike Curb has
seized the reins of California
government and has banished
religious leader Gov. )erry
Brown to Africa.
This became apparent when
Sacramento citizens disco
vered lights glowing in the
moth-balled governor's man
sion and an anonymous used
car dealer confirmed that a
1973 Plymouth bearing the
license plate "Linda" had been
received in trade for a black
Lincoln Continental.
But what has become of the
former governor? Investigative
reporters have pieced together
the following account of the
Brown African excursion:
April 12, 3 p.m. Idi Amin,
under mortar fire in his Kam
pala Palace, and musing on his
future employment oppor
tunities, sends an urgent tele
gram to Brown. It reads:
"When is the registration for
the New Hampshire primary
and can I have a copy of Linda
Ronstadt's Greatest Hits?"
April 12, 5:45 p.m. Brown re
ceives the telegram while drift
ing down the lower Nile. Fear
ing that Amin could grab the
Law and Order vote in New
Hampshire, Brown decides to
locate the missing dictator and
weight-watcher drop-out.
April 13, 9a.m. Brown flies to

a desolate plain in Northern
Uganda to meet Amin. Upon
seeing the corpulent fascist, he
accosts him with the buzz
words, "Dr. Amin I presume?"
Brown hands him a copy of the
album, Linda's Greatest Hits.
Amin looks disappointed. He
states solemnly, "I have only
an 8-track cassette."
April 14, 7:30 p.m. Amin ag
rees to forgo the New Hamp
shire primary, provided that he
can have Brown's copy of /.en

Brown hands him a copy of the album
Linda's Greatest Hits. Amin looks
disappointed. He states solemnly, "/ only
have an eight-track cassette

and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance and a Marantz
stereo receiver with JBL speak
ers. "I want to hear the bass,"
he explains.
April 15, 5:15 p.m. Brown
leaves the continent, referring
to himself as the Ayatollah
Brown, Jr., confident that with
the force of magic crocodile
teeth and a Mike Curb voodoo
doll he could regain power. A
reporter at the airport hears
Brown tell Ronstadt to wear a
body-length veil and to start
recording spirituals with De
bbie Boone.
The Ayatollah will definitely
face an uphill struggle in re
gaining the controls of political
power. According to most

political pundits, Brown's re
cent safari — perhaps soon to
be immortalized as Ronstadt-
Gate, Mate-Gate or
Waterbuffalo-Gate — struck a
crippling blow to the Brown
forces. It may even lengthen
the former governor's political
exile.
The Ayatollah has promised
to wreak vengence on all
judges appointed during his
absence. In addition, he
threatened to create upon his

return a revolutionary tribunal
to outlaw taxation.
The favored belief in higher
government circles is that
Brown can only recover con
trol of the government by re
turning to the foot of the
majestic, snow-capped Mt.
Kilimanjaro to wed the
"Rock-Goddess" Ronstadt.
Brown's aids, conceding that
a Mt. # Kilimanjaro wedding may
now be out of the question,
speculate that a more tradi
tional wedding, followed by a
honeymoon in Niagara Falls,
might rescue the former gov
ernor. It would appeal to the
"hearts and minds" of the
romantic voters of the silent

majority — a group Brown de
sperately needs to attract.
Military strategists note that
unless Brown can pull off a
successfully romantic wedding
by the end of the month, Curb
will consolidate all power.
Curb has the strategic advan
tage of occupying the capital
city during Brown's absence.
In contrast, Brown's power
base is contained along the
Kilimanjaro-Tibet axis.
Sources close to the Ayatol
lah confirmed that while in Af
rica Brown did meet with sev
eral African guerrilla experts.
These experts were originally
identified incorrectly as Afri
can gorilla experts.
If the Ayatollah's forces,
strengthened by a Ronstadt al
liance, gained control of the
Hollywood recording industry,
the Ayatollah could offset his
lack of control of the capital
city. The recording industry in
fluences California politics
substantially. Curb himself
produced an early Ronstadt re
cord.
An aide close to Curb of
fered his view of the specu
lated Brown-Ronstadt alliance:
"The worst-case analysis from
our viewpoint would be a
Brown-Ronstadt pact, followed
by a new release, an LP perhaps
featuring the Ayatollah. I'm
confident that we're strong
enough at this point in time to
withstand a 45."

Sacramento citizens disco
vered lights glowing in the
moth-balled governor's man
sion and an anonymous used
car dealer confirmed that a
1973 Plymouth bearing the
license plate "Linda" had been
received in trade for a black
Lincoln Continental.
But what has become of the
former governor? Investigative
reporters have pieced together
the following account of the
Brown African excursion:
April 12, 3 p.m. Idi Amin,
under mortar fire in his Kam
pala Palace, and musing on his
future employment oppor
tunities, sends an urgent tele
gram to Brown. It reads:
"When is the registration for
the New Hampshire primary
and can I have a copy of Linda
Ronstadt's Greatest Hits?"
April 12, 5:45 p.m. Brown re
ceives the telegram while drift
ing down the lower Nile. Fear
ing that Amin could grab the
Law and Order vote in New
Hampshire, Brown decides to
locate the missing dictator and
weight-watcher drop-out.
April 13, 9a.m. Brown flies to

a desolate plain in Northern
Uganda to meet Amin. Upon
seeing the corpulent fascist, he
accosts him with the buzz
words, "Dr. Amin I presume?"
Brown hands him a copy of the
album, Linda's Greatest Hits.
Amin looks disappointed. He
states solemnly, "I have only
an 8-track cassette."
April 14, 7:30 p.m. Amin ag
rees to forgo the New Hamp
shire primary, provided that he
can have Brown's copy of /.en

and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance and a Marantz
stereo receiver with JBL speak
ers. "I want to hear the bass,"
he explains.
April 15, 5:15 p.m. Brown
leaves the continent, referring
to himself as the Ayatollah
Brown, Jr., confident that with
the force of magic crocodile
teeth and a Mike Curb voodoo
doll he could regain power. A
reporter at the airport hears
Brown tell Ronstadt to wear a
body-length veil and to start
recording spirituals with De
bbie Boone.
The Ayatollah will definitely
face an uphill struggle in re
gaining the controls of political
power. According to most

political pundits, Brown's re
cent safari — perhaps soon to
be immortalized as Ronstadt-
Gate, Mate-Gate or
Waterbuffalo-Gate — struck a
crippling blow to the Brown
forces. It may even lengthen
the former governor's political
exile.
The Ayatollah has promised
to wreak vengence on all
judges appointed during his
absence. In addition, he
threatened to create upon his

return a revolutionary tribunal
to outlaw taxation.
The favored belief in higher
government circles is that
Brown can only recover con
trol of the government by re
turning to the foot of the
majestic, snow-capped Mt.
Kilimanjaro to wed the
"Rock-Goddess" Ronstadt.
Brown's aids, conceding that
a Mt. # Kilimanjaro wedding may
now be out of the question,
speculate that a more tradi
tional wedding, followed by a
honeymoon in Niagara Falls,
might rescue the former gov
ernor. It would appeal to the
"hearts and minds" of the
romantic voters of the silent

majority — a group Brown de
sperately needs to attract.
Military strategists note that
unless Brown can pull off a
successfully romantic wedding
by the end of the month, Curb
will consolidate all power.
Curb has the strategic advan
tage of occupying the capital
city during Brown's absence.
In contrast, Brown's power
base is contained along the
Kilimanjaro-Tibet axis.
Sources close to the Ayatol
lah confirmed that while in Af
rica Brown did meet with sev
eral African guerrilla experts.
These experts were originally
identified incorrectly as Afri
can gorilla experts.
If the Ayatollah's forces,
strengthened by a Ronstadt al
liance, gained control of the
Hollywood recording industry,
the Ayatollah could offset his
lack of control of the capital
city. The recording industry in
fluences California politics
substantially. Curb himself
produced an early Ronstadt re
cord.
An aide close to Curb of
fered his view of the specu
lated Brown-Ronstadt alliance:
"The worst-case analysis from
our viewpoint would be a
Brown-Ronstadt pact, followed
by a new release, an LP perhaps
featuring the Ayatollah. I'm
confident that we're strong
enough at this point in time to
withstand a 45."

all duties and responsibilities.
