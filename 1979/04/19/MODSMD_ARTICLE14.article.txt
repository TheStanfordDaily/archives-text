Quick on the Draw
Warning! Do not draw late!
Gary Tagahashi's letter (Daily,
April 18) was just plain wrong.
It makes absolutely no differ
ence whether you draw at the
beginning or the end of the
Housing Draw.
Let's go through the math,
this time correctly. Let's say I
draw first and you draw sec
ond. Now my chance of getting
a number between 1 and 100 is
clearly 1/50 since there are 5000
numbers. And your chance is
100/4999 if (and here's the
catch) I draw over 100. But, if I
draw under 100, your chance
drops to less: 99/4999.1 know it
looks like a small difference,
but it matters. Your total prob

ability of getting a number
from 1 to 100 is: (100/4999) x
(49/50) -t- (99/4999) x (1/50). And
this works out to be exactly
1/50. So your chance of getting
between 1 and 100 is as good as
mine and as good as the last
person who draws.
Well, my good friend Gary
Tagahashi, I guess you should
leave the real math to the Math
Sciences majors.

Teller forgets
While Dr. Edward Teller
claims the press presented
Three Mile Island as a "per
verse horror story" (Daily,
April 4), this notable scientist
seems to forget another horror
story presented by the U.S.
government, namely, Bikini
atom-tests .
The Bikini tests used the land
and environment of a native
people. Up to the moment you
read this letter, that environ
ment is so radioactive that (ac
cording to the San Francisco
Chronicle, March 27, 1978) "a
feeding program has been
provided and they (residents)
are consuming no locally
grown food.
"Nine years ago, the U.S.
government told the Bikini is
landers it was safe to return to
their atoll, once the site of nuc
lear weapons tests in the
Pacific. Some of the islanders
went home. Now the govern
ment has found that it was
wrong. According to tests last
year, the ground water in Bikini
is still too radioactive for
human consumption.
"So the Interior Department
quietly has asked Congress for
$15 million to move the islan
ders to another home . . . the
100 Bikinians now living on the
island are being carefully mon
itored . . . None of the present
Bikini residents appear yet to
have become ill from living on
the island."

But some Bikinians who
lived on their islands during
the past 23 years have de
veloped thyroid problems,
among other things.
Teller's touching concern for
airline personnel palls into no
thing compared with his lack of
concern for Bikinians. There is
a future horror story hanging
over our heads: "(These find
ings) had a further signifi
cance: the high residual levels
of radiation in the soil, and its
presence in plants 23 years
after exposure, may influence
military planners as they
explore the prospects of using
tactical nuclear weapons in
even a limited manner in
Western Europe."
I am not sure if Teller has
commented on our new
weapon, but if he has, I feel he
will call it something like a
"health" bomb while the
people of Western Europe
huddle in their Teller-cellars.

Witch-hunt legend
I visited Menlo Park and read
a copy of the Daily, April 9.
One never gets too old to
learn. I only hope that Stanford
students aren't too young to
learn.
Apparently Marxists John
Service and Owen Lattimore
never get too old to educate,
re: "McCarthy Era Explored,"
the scheduled lecture series
designed to keep the McCar
thy "witch hunts" legend alive
for posterity.
As a former Army Intelli
gence agent in China during
1944-45, and a close follower of
the McCarthy hearings in the
post World War II period, I re
call that Service got his educa
tion in Mao's Chinese head
quarters. Lattimore's contribu
tion was his own Institute of
Pacific Relations, whose
magazine (Amerasia) shop

(with sophisticated microfilm
and reproduction equipment)
was filled with stolen govern
ment documents when raided
by the FBI and Secret Service.
If Marxist professors are re
ally interested in educating
students, why don't they re
commend reading the entire,
unabridged, committee re
ports on the McCarthy hear
ings? They can be procured
from the Government Printing
Office in Washington, D.C.
)ust ask for the Committee On
Government Operations,
Senator Joseph McCarthy
Hearings.
After all these years I wonder
why they are still so paranoid,
beating on a dead man.

P.A. work cults
When the government gets
through investigating cults like
the Peoples Temple, I would
like them to investigate work
cults. What are work cults?
Work cults are where workers
are forced to accept alien be
liefs â€” or else.
The city of Palo Alto's work
ers are victims of a work cult.
They are terrorized into adopt
ing alien beliefs. If they refuse,
they are ostracized, harrassed,
threatened with dismissal and
threatened with physical
abuse. If they fight back, they
are forced to resign.
I have witnessed a super
visor assaulting a worker. The
worker fought back. He was
not given a proper hearing.
The entire matter was covered
up by forcing the worker to res
ign. The supervisor was not
disciplined.
On another occasion a black
worker was beaten up by a
supervisor. He did nothing
about it for fear of losing his
job. The supervisor boasted
about it at the time, and, to this
day, still does.
On yet another occasion a
supervisor was going to make

his brother-in-law a jour
neyperson electrician without
his serving an apprenticeship.
He was going to do this while
denying a black worker, who
had more than served his ap
prenticeship, journeyperson
status. The supervisor boasted
long and often that so long as
he was a supervisor, the black
person would never become a
journeyperson.
The black person worked
with me. I supported his efforts
to become a journeyperson.
The city of Palo Alto super
visors threatened me with
physical abuse and dismissal if
I did not withdraw my support
for the black worker.

I was responsible for run
ning the meter shop and
supervising C.E.T.A persons to
learn the trade. We had a large
turnover in this area because
the supervisors felt strongly
that these persons were to be
used as cheap labor. I felt that
the supervisors were mis
representing themselves and I
disagreed with them in this
matter. For my efforts I was
fired without cause.
Perhaps if the government
took an active interest in work
cults, people wouldn't look to
false prophets like Jimmy Jones
for help.
