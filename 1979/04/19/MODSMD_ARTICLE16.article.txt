# Haight-Ashbury changed since '60s
## 
### Philip Kohl 
The Straight Theater, on
Haight Street in San Francisco,
stands boarded up, its once
proud marquee torn down and
its exterior covered by posters
and graffiti. The Straight has
become a symbol of the battle
for a neighborhood, the
Haight-Ashbury district, or the
Haight as residents prefer to
call it. Some neighborhood
groups want the theater to be
come a community cultural
center, while some commer
cial interests would like to see
the structure razed to make
way for a parking lot.
Similar skirmishes are going
on all over the Haight. The
Haight-Ashbury Free Medical
Clinic recently received a letter
from a merchants group comp
laining that the clinic was at
tracting undesirables to the
neighborhood.
Kent Storey, the owner of Etc
Etc Etc, one of the many chic
shops which have opened in
the Haight over the last several
years, has complained to the
police several times about
people loitering near his store.

One night last August, there
was a stabbing and a hold-up in
front of his store. Storey claims
that the low beer and wine
prices of his neighbor, Bargain
Market, attract winos and
other undesirables to the im
mediate area.
To understand the meaning
of these events a little history is
necessary. Nearly 12 summers
ago, love blossomed in the
Haight. Young people from all
over the country flocked here
to participate in an urban hip
pie experiment. But the exper
iment's beauty soon faded.
"The street was pretty open
and pretty crazy in the late
'605," said Jeff Wessner, 33, an
artist who has lived in the
Haight for 15 years.
'Hard scene'
"By 1969 it was heavy walking
on the street, there were lots of
bikers, it was a hard scene,"
said John Walsh, 36, who has
lived in the Haight on and off
since 1964.
"There were a lot of empty
stores," Walsh added.
Today, there are few empty
stores. Instead, there is a mix

ture of boutiques, food stores,
bars, restaurants and regular
retail businesses, such as
hardware.
"This was the first year I
could do all my Christmas
shopping on Haight Street,"
said George Dykstra, a long
time neighborhood resident
and administrator of the
Haight-Ashbury Free Medical
Clinic.
Residents angry
But the mix of those stores
has some residents angry.
"It's a buntfh of capitalists
selling crap people don't need
at expensive prices," said
Paris, a 23-year-old man with
shoulder-length blond hair,
who is a volunteer at the
Haight-Ashbury Switchboard,
a neighborhood information
and referral center.
"I liked it better when
people were too scared to
come here," he added.
Some residents expressed
fears that the neighborhood
will turn into another Union
Street. That street is dominated
by fancy shops, bars and re
staurants, which have driven

out more traditional busines
ses.
But some of the "new" mer
chants disclaim such inten
tions.
"I don't want the street to be
like Union," said Alex
McMath, 33, the owner of
Sugartit, a year-old arts and
crafts boutique on Haight
Street.
Ownership changed
Ownership of the stores also
reflects changes in the Haight.
"Seven out of 10 stores are
owned by gays,' ' said Karen
Woo, daughter-in-law of
Mow-Sing Woo, the owner of
Bargain Market.
"The gay money from the
bars is coming in. Gay owner
ship extends from the pet store
to the boutiques," said Walsh,
an acknowledged bisexual.
A stroll down Haight Street
reveals the gay presence. Slim
males, wearing the San Fran
cisco gay uniform of close
cropped hair and mustache
and tight jeans, walk, often
hand in hand.
Gay bars
Several gay bars and discos
have opened in the Haight,
with several more slated. The
opening of the l-Beam, a gay
disco, two years ago, spurred
an influx of gays into the
neighborhood, according to
Walsh.
Not everyone is happy abo ut
the trend.
"Keep the Haight straight,"
has become a commonplace
phrase in the neighborhood.
The Haight certainly is not il
liberal. Harvey Milk, the re
cently slain supervisor and an
avowed homosexual, was
elected overwhelmingly as the
representative from the
Haight.

Much of the tension may be
economically rooted. Many of
the newcomers to the Haight,
straight as well as gay, are weal
thier than the existing resi
dents.
More middle class
"In the course of the last 10
years the demographic struc
ture, residentially, has
changed from what you'd call a
working-class neighborhood
to a middle-class, white collar
one," said Tom Swearengen,
manager of the Haight Street
branch of the United California
Bank.
Such demographic changes
have placed upward pressure
on real estate values.
"The value of real estate in
general and Victorians in par
ticular has skyrocketed,"
Swearengen said.
"Rents have tripled over the
past four or five years. Five
years ago one could find a $150
apartment with two or three
bedrooms. Now a similar
apartment is $400," Walsh said.
Increasing rents have

created many problems in the
Haight. The neighborhood has
featured a diversity of old
people, blacks and hippies.
The continued presence of
these groups is threatened by
higher rents.
More disputes
"We're handling many more
tenant-landlord disputes,"
said the volunteer at the
Haight-Ashbury Switchboard.
He said that landlords have
been trying to force out old
time residents in order to
charge higher rents to the
newcomers.
Bob Pruska, 58, is one of
those old-time residents. He
has lived at his address on Fell
Street for 20 years. Pruska, re
cently retired from his mainte
nance job at San Francisco's
Laguna Honda Hospital, said
he has a good relationship with
his landlord, but worries about
old people being forced out of
the Haight.
"Things in the Haight ha

ven't improved for the el
derly," Pruska said.
Things aren't very good for
the neighborhood's street
people either. During the hip
pie heyday, many street people
moved to the Haight. Golden
Gate Park was a good place to
sleep. Many of the street
people hung on through the
'70s. But merchants, such as
Storey, have increased pres
sure on the police to "clean
up" the neighborhood.
Rumors have circulated in
the neighborhood about
police beatings. According to
Diane Brazas, former adminis
trator of the Haight Free Clinic,
Batman, a well-known street
person, was beaten up by the
police and has vowed not to
return to the Haight.
But other, more respectable
types, continue to move to the
hiaight.
"Times have changed," said
Alex McMath. "Everybody has
to clean up their act."
