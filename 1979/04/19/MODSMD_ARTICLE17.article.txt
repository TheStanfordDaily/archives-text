# Exemplified by showerheads
## Conservation awareness decreases

Steam fills the showers.
Streams of water trickle down
the green tile walls and thick,
foggy moisture coats the win
dows. Four showerheads
turned to maximum strength
create white clouds of humid
ity as they shoot scalding water
onto the waiting drains. It is an
autumn evening in a University
residence.
Blatant examples of wasting
water such as the one just de
scribed were rare during
California's drought when

conservation awareness was
high. Stickers offering such
slogans as "If you don't need it,
don't use it," decorated every
bathroom, and students were
often intolerant of peers who
refused to recognize the im
portance of conservation.
Some students last year took
marine showers and voted to
wear sweaters rather than run
dorm heaters. This former
concern has dissipated to the
point that marine showers
have in some instances been
replaced by steam baths.
The object of a steam bath is
to create a sauna effect by fil
ling the shower room with
steam. Four shower heads
turned to the maximum for five
minutes consume 50 gallons of
water. Prior to the installation
of the new shower heads, it
would have consumed 140 gal
lons.
President |immy Carter ex
perienced a similar trend in
public attitudes following the
Arab oil embargo. Two years
after the fuel shortage, the
president attempted to intro
duce the first real energy policy
because Americans had re
sumed their wasteful con
sumption of energy, despite
the warning provided by the
embargo.
Karl Johnson, head of the
University's Energy Conserva
tion Center, noted a similar
shift in the concerns of stu
dents here. Fie cited the exam
ple of the recent showerhead

controversy.
Since the new economical
shower heads were installed,
Johnson said he has been
mobbed by both complaints
and encouragement. Twenty
shower nozzles of various
shapes and sizes now sit in a
row behind Johnson's desk, a
protective barrier in the event
of attack.
"I was really surprised by the
controversy," johnson said.
"I tried the new nozzle and
thought it was a'great shower."
He said he sympathizes with
the complaint that students
were not informed about the
new shower heads prior to
their installment, but is puz
zled by reports of retaliatory
actions that are counter
productive.
"I've heard that some people
take showers with two nozzles
instead of one," Johnson said.
"It just comes down to the fact
that they're more concerned
about their showers than sav
ings."
Though takinga showerwith
two nozzles may represent a
desire for comfort, there have
also been instances where
comfort is not a factor, the only
result being wasted water.
"I've even heard of students
letting the showers run all
night to make the new
showerheads seem ineffective.
That is totally counterproduc
tive," Johnson said. "People
were more conscious previ
ously. It's given way to apathy
— a very unproductive at
titude."
Statistics support Johnson's
claim. On campus, 442 million
gallons of water were con
sumed between September
and March compared to 353

million gallons in the same
time period last year. This rep
resents a 20 percent increase
since last year. Johnson attri
butes this added consumption
to the fact that "conservation is
less in people's conscious
ness."
California has long been
beset by water shortages, and
it has been common practice to
dam up rivers to circumvent
water crises. This is a limiting
factor, Johnson explained,
since California is running out
of rivers to dam.
Johnson also told of the dif
ficulties with the California
watertable, which is the supply
of fresh water lying beneath
layers of topsoil and rock. The
current practice is to drill down
to this level and pump up wa
ter, but, Johnson said, "there's
always the problem of running
out of water as you pump it out
of the water table faster than it
gets in."
In addition to the environ
mental impact of conservation,
Johnson pointed out the
economical benefits.
Johnson explained that
though one may think the sole
cost of his water is represented
by his water bill, an additional
$60 to $75 is required monthly
out of his taxes to pay for sew
age treatment.
Ami McKinley, currently
working on a Department of
Energy project here, consi
dered "today's people as basi
cally economy minded" and
said this trait will be a prime
motivation for conservation in
the future.
McKinley, however, said he

does not believe that people
should have to change their
lifestyles to accommodate en
vironmental demands.
"The goal of conservation is
to change the process, change
the way you manage energy
flows, change industrial pro
cesses, but this does not in
clude a curtailment of things
people want to do," McKinley
explained. "Change the pro
cess that gives them the thing
they want so it uses less
energy."
Using the example of the
showerheads, McKinley re
commended that a nozzle be
designed that gives people the
same sensation as the original
showerhead, but that also con
sumes less energy. This could
be aided by pulsating
showerheads which use less
water and by moving water
heaters closer to the showers
to prevent unneeded loss of
energy in transit.
Johnson, though he consid
ers technological aids impor
tant, said he regards individual
attitudes as the most crucial to
successful conservation.
"It's people who make the
difference in the long run,"
Johnson said firmly.

and March compared to 353

million gallons in the same
time period last year. This rep
resents a 20 percent increase
since last year. Johnson attri
butes this added consumption
to the fact that "conservation is
less in people's conscious
ness."
California has long been
beset by water shortages, and
it has been common practice to
dam up rivers to circumvent
water crises. This is a limiting
factor, Johnson explained,
since California is running out
of rivers to dam.
Johnson also told of the dif
ficulties with the California
watertable, which is the supply
of fresh water lying beneath
layers of topsoil and rock. The
current practice is to drill down
to this level and pump up wa
ter, but, Johnson said, "there's
always the problem of running
out of water as you pump it out
of the water table faster than it
gets in."
In addition to the environ
mental impact of conservation,
Johnson pointed out the
economical benefits.
Johnson explained that
though one may think the sole
cost of his water is represented
by his water bill, an additional
$60 to $75 is required monthly
out of his taxes to pay for sew
age treatment.
Ami McKinley, currently
working on a Department of
Energy project here, consi
dered "today's people as basi
cally economy minded" and
said this trait will be a prime
motivation for conservation in
the future.
McKinley, however, said he

does not believe that people
should have to change their
lifestyles to accommodate en
vironmental demands.
"The goal of conservation is
to change the process, change
the way you manage energy
flows, change industrial pro
cesses, but this does not in
clude a curtailment of things
people want to do," McKinley
explained. "Change the pro
cess that gives them the thing
they want so it uses less
energy."
Using the example of the
showerheads, McKinley re
commended that a nozzle be
designed that gives people the
same sensation as the original
showerhead, but that also con
sumes less energy. This could
be aided by pulsating
showerheads which use less
water and by moving water
heaters closer to the showers
to prevent unneeded loss of
energy in transit.
Johnson, though he consid
ers technological aids impor
tant, said he regards individual
attitudes as the most crucial to
successful conservation.
"It's people who make the
difference in the long run,"
Johnson said firmly.

conservation awareness was
high. Stickers offering such
slogans as "If you don't need it,

Some students last year took
marine showers and voted to
wear sweaters rather than run
dorm heaters. This former
concern has dissipated to the
point that marine showers
have in some instances been
replaced by steam baths.
The object of a steam bath is
to create a sauna effect by fil
ling the shower room with
steam. Four shower heads
turned to the maximum for five
minutes consume 50 gallons of
water. Prior to the installation
of the new shower heads, it
would have consumed 140 gal
lons.
President |immy Carter ex
perienced a similar trend in
public attitudes following the
Arab oil embargo. Two years
after the fuel shortage, the
president attempted to intro
duce the first real energy policy
because Americans had re
sumed their wasteful con
sumption of energy, despite
the warning provided by the
embargo.
Karl Johnson, head of the
University's Energy Conserva
tion Center, noted a similar
shift in the concerns of stu
dents here. Fie cited the exam
ple of the recent showerhead

controversy.
Since the new economical
shower heads were installed,
Johnson said he has been
mobbed by both complaints
and encouragement. Twenty
shower nozzles of various
shapes and sizes now sit in a
row behind Johnson's desk, a
protective barrier in the event
of attack.
"I was really surprised by the
controversy," johnson said.
"I tried the new nozzle and
thought it was a'great shower."
He said he sympathizes with
the complaint that students
were not informed about the
new shower heads prior to
their installment, but is puz
zled by reports of retaliatory
actions that are counter
productive.
"I've heard that some people
take showers with two nozzles
instead of one," Johnson said.
"It just comes down to the fact
that they're more concerned
about their showers than sav
ings."
Though takinga showerwith
two nozzles may represent a
desire for comfort, there have
also been instances where
comfort is not a factor, the only
result being wasted water.
"I've even heard of students
letting the showers run all
night to make the new
showerheads seem ineffective.
That is totally counterproduc
tive," Johnson said. "People
were more conscious previ
ously. It's given way to apathy
— a very unproductive at
titude."
Statistics support Johnson's
claim. On campus, 442 million
gallons of water were con
sumed between September
and March compared to 353

million gallons in the same
time period last year. This rep
resents a 20 percent increase
since last year. Johnson attri
