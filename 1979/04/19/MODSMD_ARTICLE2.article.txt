# University stand on draft undetermined
## 
### Robert Reed 
The University would have great
difficulty in taking an official stand on
the issue of a new military draft in the
United States, according to both
University President Richard Lyman
and Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig.
Recently, there have been efforts
in Congress to renew military regist
ration and selective service.
Among these proposals is HR-23,
the "Bennett Bill," a military registra
tion and mobilization bill which calls
for renewal of military registration no
later than October 1, 1979. The bill
also calls for schools to provide age
and address information of its stu
dents for this purpose.
Lyman said he felt the University
could take a stand on this issue "inso
far as University interests are directly
affected."
The Bennett bill could affect the
University by forcing it to provide
student age and address information
for registration purposes.
For this reason, Rosenzweig said
the University "would probably
argue against" this particular bill. He
said he felt that the University ought
to be kept out of any registration
process.

"The government shouldn't look
to institutions to provide the mid
dleman function," said Rosenzweig.
He said that if the government wants
to force registration, "the govern
ment ought to do it itself."
According to Lyman, however, "It
might prove very difficult" to find
other grounds for taking an official

stand on the issue. "I suspect there
are lots of differences of opinion (on
this issue) within the University —
and no consensus," Lyman said.
Rosenzweig said that because of
this probable diversity of opinions, it
is "unlikely" that the University will
take a stand on the issue.
Critics say the new draft would
mean a larger army that would make
it much easier for the U.S. to become
involved in an armed conflict. Ly
man, however, did not agree with
this argument.
"It's not that obvious to me that
our foreign policy will be less cauti
ousifwehavethedraft. . .thanifwe
have a volunteer force," Lyman said.
Lyman admitted, however, that he
himself is somewhat ambivalent
about reinstituting the draft.
"They may well feel freer to use a
volunteer force, which is signed up
voluntarily, than an essentially civi
lian force, which will be reluctant to
get involved abroad," said Lyman.
Vietnam War
Lyman said that, in the minds of
many, the movement against the Vie
tnam War would not have been as
powerful if there had not been a
selective service.
"It seems to me perhaps the oppo
site of true to argue that the draft will
make for a reckless, adventurous, in
terventionist policy overseas,"
Lyman said.
Lyman explained that he under
stood the reasons for student oppos
ition to the draft. But he said, "If
there is to be a return of the draft,
there ought not to be student defer
ments." He said this provision would

be socially divisive.
"It creates a two-class citizenry. It
exposes the poor and the unedu
cated more than the rich and the
educated. That's fundamentally
wrong, and leads to nothing but
trouble," Lyman said.
Lyman also said he is "not inclined
to support universal service propos
als of the kind that (Rep.) Pete
McCloskey (R-Calif.) is putting out."
Lyman said these proposals would
"hold out formidable problems of
bureaucracy and regimentation —
and just expanding the role of gov
ernment enormously with respect to
the age group affected."
"I think any extension of govern
ment's power to compel us to do
things certainly has its negative
side," said Lyman.
The provision in the Bennett bill
forcing schools to provide student
age and address information raises
privacy rights questions. While stu
dent address information is com
monly given out, it does not have to
be given out. While student age may
be confirmed by the registrar, age is
never released, according to Assoc.
Registrar Robert Houghton.
"We don't tell the government
more than we tell anyone else," he
said. Only under subpoena,
Houghton said, will the registrar re
lease student age.
The privacy issue will come under
consideration by the University's
Administrative Panel on Privacy of In
formation in the near future, accord
ing to the panel's chairman, George
Gregory.Gregory, however, did not
feel it would be proper to comment

on the issue at this time.
According to Director of Govern
ment Relations Robert Ereelen, be
cause of the controversial nature of
this bill, it will probably not pass in
this session of Congress. Freelen
said, "Generally speaking, when
something's controversial, it moves
pretty slow."
Though the University may not
take a definitive stand on the draft
issue, many students here have.
Referendum
A referendum to determine stu
dent sentiment on the draft is being
voted on today in ASSU elections.
Also, several campus and com
munity groups against the draft have
formed a coalition called Students

Against Conscription (SAC).
Lyman said, however, "If you want
to lobby Congress, the effective way
to do it is to do it directly. People are
so used to college campus rallies by
now that it doesn't excite con
gressmen very much to know that
there's been a rally on campus in
which people that don't want to get
drafted get up and say they don't
want to get drafted."

munity groups against the draft have
formed a coalition called Students

Against Conscription (SAC).
Lyman said, however, "If you want
to lobby Congress, the effective way
to do it is to do it directly. People are
so used to college campus rallies by
now that it doesn't excite con
gressmen very much to know that
there's been a rally on campus in
which people that don't want to get
drafted get up and say they don't
want to get drafted."
The University would have great
difficulty in taking an official stand on
the issue of a new military draft in the
United States, according to both
University President Richard Lyman
and Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig.
Recently, there have been efforts
in Congress to renew military regist
ration and selective service.
Among these proposals is HR-23,
the "Bennett Bill," a military registra
tion and mobilization bill which calls
for renewal of military registration no
later than October 1, 1979. The bill
also calls for schools to provide age
and address information of its stu
dents for this purpose.
Lyman said he felt the University
could take a stand on this issue "inso
far as University interests are directly
affected."
The Bennett bill could affect the
University by forcing it to provide
student age and address information
for registration purposes.
For this reason, Rosenzweig said
the University "would probably
argue against" this particular bill. He
said he felt that the University ought
to be kept out of any registration
process.

"The government shouldn't look
to institutions to provide the mid
dleman function," said Rosenzweig.
He said that if the government wants
to force registration, "the govern
ment ought to do it itself."
According to Lyman, however, "It
might prove very difficult" to find
other grounds for taking an official

stand on the issue. "I suspect there
are lots of differences of opinion (on
this issue) within the University —
and no consensus," Lyman said.
Rosenzweig said that because of
this probable diversity of opinions, it
is "unlikely" that the University will
take a stand on the issue.
Critics say the new draft would
mean a larger army that would make
it much easier for the U.S. to become
involved in an armed conflict. Ly
man, however, did not agree with
this argument.
"It's not that obvious to me that
our foreign policy will be less cauti
ousifwehavethedraft. . .thanifwe
have a volunteer force," Lyman said.
Lyman admitted, however, that he
himself is somewhat ambivalent
about reinstituting the draft.
"They may well feel freer to use a
volunteer force, which is signed up
voluntarily, than an essentially civi
lian force, which will be reluctant to
get involved abroad," said Lyman.
Vietnam War
Lyman said that, in the minds of
many, the movement against the Vie
tnam War would not have been as
powerful if there had not been a
selective service.
"It seems to me perhaps the oppo
site of true to argue that the draft will
make for a reckless, adventurous, in
terventionist policy overseas,"
Lyman said.
Lyman explained that he under
stood the reasons for student oppos
ition to the draft. But he said, "If
there is to be a return of the draft,
there ought not to be student defer
ments." He said this provision would

be socially divisive.
"It creates a two-class citizenry. It
exposes the poor and the unedu
cated more than the rich and the
educated. That's fundamentally
wrong, and leads to nothing but
trouble," Lyman said.
Lyman also said he is "not inclined
to support universal service propos
als of the kind that (Rep.) Pete
McCloskey (R-Calif.) is putting out."
Lyman said these proposals would
"hold out formidable problems of
bureaucracy and regimentation —
and just expanding the role of gov
ernment enormously with respect to
the age group affected."
"I think any extension of govern
ment's power to compel us to do
things certainly has its negative
side," said Lyman.
The provision in the Bennett bill
forcing schools to provide student
age and address information raises
privacy rights questions. While stu
dent address information is com
monly given out, it does not have to
be given out. While student age may
be confirmed by the registrar, age is
never released, according to Assoc.
Registrar Robert Houghton.
"We don't tell the government
more than we tell anyone else," he
said. Only under subpoena,
Houghton said, will the registrar re
lease student age.
The privacy issue will come under
consideration by the University's
Administrative Panel on Privacy of In
formation in the near future, accord
ing to the panel's chairman, George
Gregory.Gregory, however, did not
feel it would be proper to comment

on the issue at this time.
According to Director of Govern
ment Relations Robert Ereelen, be
cause of the controversial nature of
this bill, it will probably not pass in
this session of Congress. Freelen
said, "Generally speaking, when
something's controversial, it moves
pretty slow."
Though the University may not
take a definitive stand on the draft
issue, many students here have.
Referendum
A referendum to determine stu
dent sentiment on the draft is being
voted on today in ASSU elections.

munity groups against the draft have
