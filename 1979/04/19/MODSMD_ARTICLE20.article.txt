Nigel
Nigel Olsson
Bang (Columbia)
Former drummer for the
Elton John Band, Nigel Olsson
strikes out on his own with this
collection of songs, most of
which were culled from an
album Bang records released
last year. Surprisingly, Olsson
proves to have a quite passa

ble, sweet voice, which aptly
lends itself to the material
here, most of which is balladic.
Aside from the album's two
easy-listening hits, "Dancin'
Shoes" and "A Little Bit of
Soap," most of the songs were
co-written by Olsson, and all
the songs make for pleasant lis
tening, though, for the most
part, not much more. High
lighting the album is the richly
orchestrated "Cassey Blue-Au
Revoir" suite.

Ceorge Harrison
George Harrison
Dark Horse
This is by far Harrison's best
overall effort since the under
exposed Living in the Material
World. Gone are most of the
preachings and bitterness
which have tended to per
meate Harrison's post-Beatles
works, replaced, primarily, by
more complacent and happy
themes. The result is a work
which does not tax the listener,
but instead can be enjoyed as a
fun album. The problem, how
ever, is that Harrison gets too
laid back on some of the cuts.
While such tunes as "Love
Comes to Everyone," "Faster"
(the best, most exciting piece
on the album), and the current
hit "Blow Away" boast clean,
catchy melodies, some of the
songs, especially "Not Guilty,"

make the Grateful Dead sound
rambunctious. Overall, then,
the result is one which has
plagued all of Harrison's al
bums (except, perhaps, the
aforementioned Material
World): an album which, over
all, fails to match the excel
lence of its high points.
Twilly
Dwight Twilly
Arista
Add Twilly to the growing list

of those (Blondie, Elvis Cos
tello, etc.) who are revitalizing
the '60s sound of pop-rock. On
this album, his third, Twilly de
livers a primarily rocking col
lection of songs, though the
best number is the slower
"Out of My Hands," nicely or
chestrated by hit arranger
Jimmy Haskell. Twilly's voice
can best be described as a
sound alike of Tom Petty's,
another musician who
traverses the '60s sound. Over
all, the album works, due to
the fact that such songs as
"Runaway" and "Standin' in
the Shadow of Love" are easily
accessible. Which is how you
have to judge this entire al
bum: on accessibility. Twilly is
not makinga statement, except
that (pop-)rock should be for
rock's sake. Save the message
for others, Twilly's making
rock to listen to and dance to.
It's a good attempt, and a wel
come relief from the glut of
technically proficient but bor
ing stuff now being put out.
Airwaves
Badfinger
Elektra
Avoiding the pitfall of many
comeback efforts (e.g.,
Crosby, Stills and Nash), on
this album, their first in five
years, Badfinger has updated
their sound. The Beatlesque
harmonies are still pretty much
intact, but the overall sound is
more elaborate and somewhat
more rock-oriented. However,
while there is some interesting
material on this album, such as
the rocker "Look out Califor
nia" and the pretty "Sail Away"
and"The Dreamer," nothing
on this album has the sparkle
of Badtinger's early hits ("No
Matter What," "Day After
Day," etc.). Still, for Badfinger
fans, a worthwhile album.

Phantom of the Might
Kayak
Janus
This, Kayak's fifth album, de
serves to be one of the year's
biggest albums; instead, it
seems that it will probably die
in obscurity, as have their
other albums. On this outing,
Kayak delivers their usual mix
of musically alluring pop-rock
tunes with progressive over
tones and nearly faultless voc

als, and this time adds orchest
ration in place of what was pre
viously handled by mellotron
and synthesizer.
The result is an exciting work
of originality which romps
from the fast paced "Crime of
Passion" to the balladic stories
of "Phantom of the Night" and
"Ruthless Queen." Some of
the songs are notably better
than others, including "Keep
the Change," "Daphne" and
those I've previously men-

tioned. But the album never
fails to be entertaining, both
musically and lyrically (thanks
to the recent addition of lyra
cist Irene Linders). A splendid
effort by a group which de
serves more recognition.
Classic Rock (Vol. 1)
The London Symphony Or
chestra
RSO
This is an album which, in
concept, doesn't sound terri
bly great. Surprisingly, in
execution, it's generally even
worse. Only two songs,
Oueen's "Bohemian Rhap
sody" and Procol Harum's "A
Whiter Shade of Pale" work
well. For "Bohemian Rhap
sody," the accomplishment is
somewhat noteworthy. "A
Whiter Shade of Pale," on the
other hand, is a derivative of a
classical piece of music, any
way, so reinterpreting it for or
chestra is no great ac

complishment.
The remainder of the album
runs from a fair version of
"Nights in White Satin," which
simply sounds like the Moody
Blues' version minus vocals, to
a simply awful version of
"Whole Lotta Love" which can
only be described as an embar
rassment to anyone associated
with this project. Overall, this
album should keep the super
market music programmers
happy, but there's not enough
exciting or interesting listening
here for anyone else.
Breakfast in America
Supertramp
A&M
The most noticable differ
ence between this album and
Supertramp's last three —
Crime of the Century, Crisis,
What Crisis? and Even in the
Quietest Moments — is the
lack of orchestration, the

"strings" being provided, in
stead, by synthesizer. Other
wise, this album is more typical
Supertramp fare, a little more
consistently good than Crisis
or Quietest Moments. The
sound is again reminiscent of a
cross between a scaled down,
intelligent Electric Light Or
chestra, and the subtle com
plexity of Ambrosia's earlier
work, with an occasional dash
of funk or jazz added. As with
most Supertramp albums, it
would be hard to call the best
cuts; the songs appeal on dif
ferent levels, from the wit of
"Breakfast in America" to the
catchiness of "The Logical
Song" to the jazzy overtones of
"Child of Vision" to the bal
ladry of "Lord is it Mine." In all
cases, Supertramp succeeds,
providing an album which
doesn't provide something for
everyone, but instead serves
up a lot for most, and is there
fore quite appealing.



Badfinger


Keyboardist Jan Hammer
brings his new group
"Hammer" to Ihe Encina
Station tomorrow for two
shows. Over the years
Hammer has played with
many of the luminaries of
the jazz-rock world, most
noteworthy has been his
work with the seminal
Mahivishnu Orchestra. He
has also appeared on
numerous rock albums,
including several by
guitarist Jeff Beck. His
recent release on
Electra/Asylum records
shows Hammer to be a
polished performer of
contemporary jazz-rock.
Shows are at 8:30 and
10:30 p.m.

Nigel
Nigel Olsson
Bang (Columbia)
Former drummer for the
Elton John Band, Nigel Olsson
strikes out on his own with this
collection of songs, most of
which were culled from an
album Bang records released
last year. Surprisingly, Olsson
proves to have a quite passa

ble, sweet voice, which aptly
lends itself to the material
here, most of which is balladic.
Aside from the album's two
easy-listening hits, "Dancin'
Shoes" and "A Little Bit of
Soap," most of the songs were
co-written by Olsson, and all
the songs make for pleasant lis
tening, though, for the most
part, not much more. High
lighting the album is the richly
orchestrated "Cassey Blue-Au
Revoir" suite.

Ceorge Harrison
George Harrison
Dark Horse
This is by far Harrison's best
overall effort since the under
exposed Living in the Material
World. Gone are most of the
preachings and bitterness
which have tended to per
meate Harrison's post-Beatles
works, replaced, primarily, by
more complacent and happy
themes. The result is a work
which does not tax the listener,
but instead can be enjoyed as a
fun album. The problem, how
ever, is that Harrison gets too
laid back on some of the cuts.
While such tunes as "Love
Comes to Everyone," "Faster"
(the best, most exciting piece
on the album), and the current
hit "Blow Away" boast clean,
catchy melodies, some of the
songs, especially "Not Guilty,"

make the Grateful Dead sound
rambunctious. Overall, then,
the result is one which has
plagued all of Harrison's al
bums (except, perhaps, the
aforementioned Material
World): an album which, over
all, fails to match the excel
lence of its high points.
Twilly
Dwight Twilly
Arista
Add Twilly to the growing list

of those (Blondie, Elvis Cos
tello, etc.) who are revitalizing
the '60s sound of pop-rock. On
this album, his third, Twilly de
livers a primarily rocking col
lection of songs, though the
best number is the slower
"Out of My Hands," nicely or
chestrated by hit arranger
Jimmy Haskell. Twilly's voice
can best be described as a
sound alike of Tom Petty's,
another musician who
traverses the '60s sound. Over
all, the album works, due to
the fact that such songs as
"Runaway" and "Standin' in
the Shadow of Love" are easily
accessible. Which is how you
have to judge this entire al
bum: on accessibility. Twilly is
not makinga statement, except
that (pop-)rock should be for
rock's sake. Save the message
for others, Twilly's making
rock to listen to and dance to.
It's a good attempt, and a wel
come relief from the glut of
technically proficient but bor
ing stuff now being put out.
Airwaves
Badfinger
Elektra
Avoiding the pitfall of many
comeback efforts (e.g.,
Crosby, Stills and Nash), on
this album, their first in five
years, Badfinger has updated
their sound. The Beatlesque
harmonies are still pretty much
intact, but the overall sound is
more elaborate and somewhat
more rock-oriented. However,
while there is some interesting
material on this album, such as
the rocker "Look out Califor
nia" and the pretty "Sail Away"
and"The Dreamer," nothing
on this album has the sparkle
of Badtinger's early hits ("No
Matter What," "Day After
Day," etc.). Still, for Badfinger
fans, a worthwhile album.

Phantom of the Might
Kayak
Janus
This, Kayak's fifth album, de
serves to be one of the year's
biggest albums; instead, it
seems that it will probably die
in obscurity, as have their
other albums. On this outing,
Kayak delivers their usual mix
of musically alluring pop-rock
tunes with progressive over
tones and nearly faultless voc

als, and this time adds orchest
ration in place of what was pre
viously handled by mellotron
and synthesizer.
The result is an exciting work
of originality which romps
from the fast paced "Crime of
Passion" to the balladic stories
of "Phantom of the Night" and
"Ruthless Queen." Some of
the songs are notably better
than others, including "Keep
the Change," "Daphne" and
those I've previously men-

tioned. But the album never
fails to be entertaining, both
musically and lyrically (thanks
to the recent addition of lyra
cist Irene Linders). A splendid
effort by a group which de
serves more recognition.
Classic Rock (Vol. 1)
The London Symphony Or
chestra
RSO
This is an album which, in
concept, doesn't sound terri
bly great. Surprisingly, in
execution, it's generally even
worse. Only two songs,
Oueen's "Bohemian Rhap
sody" and Procol Harum's "A
Whiter Shade of Pale" work
well. For "Bohemian Rhap
sody," the accomplishment is
somewhat noteworthy. "A
Whiter Shade of Pale," on the
other hand, is a derivative of a
classical piece of music, any
way, so reinterpreting it for or
chestra is no great ac

complishment.
The remainder of the album
runs from a fair version of
"Nights in White Satin," which
simply sounds like the Moody
Blues' version minus vocals, to
a simply awful version of
"Whole Lotta Love" which can
only be described as an embar
rassment to anyone associated
with this project. Overall, this
album should keep the super
market music programmers
happy, but there's not enough
exciting or interesting listening
here for anyone else.
Breakfast in America
Supertramp
A&M
The most noticable differ
ence between this album and
Supertramp's last three —
Crime of the Century, Crisis,
What Crisis? and Even in the
Quietest Moments — is the
lack of orchestration, the

"strings" being provided, in
stead, by synthesizer. Other
wise, this album is more typical
Supertramp fare, a little more
consistently good than Crisis
or Quietest Moments. The
sound is again reminiscent of a
cross between a scaled down,
intelligent Electric Light Or
chestra, and the subtle com
plexity of Ambrosia's earlier
work, with an occasional dash
of funk or jazz added. As with
most Supertramp albums, it
would be hard to call the best
cuts; the songs appeal on dif
ferent levels, from the wit of
"Breakfast in America" to the
catchiness of "The Logical
Song" to the jazzy overtones of
"Child of Vision" to the bal
ladry of "Lord is it Mine." In all
cases, Supertramp succeeds,
providing an album which
doesn't provide something for
everyone, but instead serves
up a lot for most, and is there
fore quite appealing.



Badfinger


Keyboardist Jan Hammer
brings his new group
"Hammer" to Ihe Encina
Station tomorrow for two
shows. Over the years
Hammer has played with
many of the luminaries of

work with the seminal
Mahivishnu Orchestra. He
has also appeared on
numerous rock albums,
including several by
guitarist Jeff Beck. His
recent release on

shows Hammer to be a

Nigel
Nigel Olsson
Bang (Columbia)
Former drummer for the
Elton John Band, Nigel Olsson
strikes out on his own with this
collection of songs, most of
which were culled from an
album Bang records released
last year. Surprisingly, Olsson
proves to have a quite passa

ble, sweet voice, which aptly
lends itself to the material
here, most of which is balladic.
Aside from the album's two
easy-listening hits, "Dancin'
Shoes" and "A Little Bit of
Soap," most of the songs were
co-written by Olsson, and all
the songs make for pleasant lis
tening, though, for the most
part, not much more. High
lighting the album is the richly
orchestrated "Cassey Blue-Au
Revoir" suite.

Ceorge Harrison
George Harrison
Dark Horse
This is by far Harrison's best
overall effort since the under
exposed Living in the Material
World. Gone are most of the
preachings and bitterness
which have tended to per
meate Harrison's post-Beatles
works, replaced, primarily, by
more complacent and happy
themes. The result is a work
which does not tax the listener,
but instead can be enjoyed as a
fun album. The problem, how
ever, is that Harrison gets too
laid back on some of the cuts.
While such tunes as "Love
Comes to Everyone," "Faster"
(the best, most exciting piece
on the album), and the current
hit "Blow Away" boast clean,
catchy melodies, some of the
songs, especially "Not Guilty,"

make the Grateful Dead sound
rambunctious. Overall, then,
the result is one which has
plagued all of Harrison's al
bums (except, perhaps, the
aforementioned Material
World): an album which, over
all, fails to match the excel
lence of its high points.
Twilly
Dwight Twilly
Arista
Add Twilly to the growing list

of those (Blondie, Elvis Cos
tello, etc.) who are revitalizing
the '60s sound of pop-rock. On
this album, his third, Twilly de
livers a primarily rocking col
lection of songs, though the
best number is the slower
"Out of My Hands," nicely or
chestrated by hit arranger
Jimmy Haskell. Twilly's voice
can best be described as a
sound alike of Tom Petty's,
another musician who
traverses the '60s sound. Over
all, the album works, due to
the fact that such songs as
"Runaway" and "Standin' in
the Shadow of Love" are easily
accessible. Which is how you
have to judge this entire al
bum: on accessibility. Twilly is
not makinga statement, except
that (pop-)rock should be for
rock's sake. Save the message
for others, Twilly's making
rock to listen to and dance to.
It's a good attempt, and a wel
come relief from the glut of
technically proficient but bor
ing stuff now being put out.
Airwaves
Badfinger
Elektra
Avoiding the pitfall of many
comeback efforts (e.g.,
Crosby, Stills and Nash), on
this album, their first in five
years, Badfinger has updated
their sound. The Beatlesque
harmonies are still pretty much
intact, but the overall sound is
more elaborate and somewhat
more rock-oriented. However,
while there is some interesting
material on this album, such as
the rocker "Look out Califor
nia" and the pretty "Sail Away"
and"The Dreamer," nothing
on this album has the sparkle
of Badtinger's early hits ("No
Matter What," "Day After
Day," etc.). Still, for Badfinger
fans, a worthwhile album.

Phantom of the Might
Kayak
Janus
This, Kayak's fifth album, de
serves to be one of the year's
biggest albums; instead, it
seems that it will probably die
in obscurity, as have their
other albums. On this outing,
Kayak delivers their usual mix
of musically alluring pop-rock
tunes with progressive over
tones and nearly faultless voc

als, and this time adds orchest
ration in place of what was pre
viously handled by mellotron
and synthesizer.
The result is an exciting work
of originality which romps
from the fast paced "Crime of
Passion" to the balladic stories
of "Phantom of the Night" and
"Ruthless Queen." Some of
the songs are notably better
than others, including "Keep
the Change," "Daphne" and
those I've previously men-

tioned. But the album never
fails to be entertaining, both
musically and lyrically (thanks
to the recent addition of lyra
cist Irene Linders). A splendid
effort by a group which de
serves more recognition.
Classic Rock (Vol. 1)
The London Symphony Or
chestra
RSO
This is an album which, in
concept, doesn't sound terri
bly great. Surprisingly, in
execution, it's generally even
worse. Only two songs,
Oueen's "Bohemian Rhap
sody" and Procol Harum's "A
Whiter Shade of Pale" work
well. For "Bohemian Rhap
sody," the accomplishment is
somewhat noteworthy. "A
Whiter Shade of Pale," on the
other hand, is a derivative of a
classical piece of music, any
way, so reinterpreting it for or
chestra is no great ac

complishment.
The remainder of the album
runs from a fair version of
"Nights in White Satin," which
simply sounds like the Moody
Blues' version minus vocals, to
a simply awful version of
"Whole Lotta Love" which can
only be described as an embar
rassment to anyone associated
with this project. Overall, this
album should keep the super
market music programmers
happy, but there's not enough
exciting or interesting listening
here for anyone else.
Breakfast in America
Supertramp
A&M
The most noticable differ
ence between this album and
Supertramp's last three —
Crime of the Century, Crisis,
What Crisis? and Even in the
Quietest Moments — is the
lack of orchestration, the

"strings" being provided, in
stead, by synthesizer. Other
wise, this album is more typical
Supertramp fare, a little more
consistently good than Crisis
or Quietest Moments. The
sound is again reminiscent of a
cross between a scaled down,
intelligent Electric Light Or
chestra, and the subtle com
plexity of Ambrosia's earlier
work, with an occasional dash
of funk or jazz added. As with
most Supertramp albums, it
would be hard to call the best
cuts; the songs appeal on dif
ferent levels, from the wit of
"Breakfast in America" to the
catchiness of "The Logical
Song" to the jazzy overtones of
"Child of Vision" to the bal
ladry of "Lord is it Mine." In all
cases, Supertramp succeeds,
providing an album which
doesn't provide something for
everyone, but instead serves
up a lot for most, and is there
fore quite appealing.



Badfinger


Keyboardist Jan Hammer
brings his new group
"Hammer" to Ihe Encina
Station tomorrow for two
shows. Over the years
Hammer has played with
many of the luminaries of
the jazz-rock world, most
noteworthy has been his
work with the seminal
Mahivishnu Orchestra. He
has also appeared on
numerous rock albums,
including several by
guitarist Jeff Beck. His
recent release on
Electra/Asylum records
shows Hammer to be a
polished performer of
contemporary jazz-rock.
Shows are at 8:30 and
10:30 p.m.
