. ; "So many dance companies
now only want, 'one, two,
three-technique; one, two,
three-make money.' We do not
.•want that," said Takako
Asakawa of the Asakawalker
Dance Company, giving em
phasis to her words with quick
hand motions.
Indeed, the idea of time,
tjoth long and short, ran
throughout my conversation
With the founders of
Asakawalker, Asakawa and
David Hatch Walker. "Short"
related to the age of the com
pany, now only two and one
half years old. "Long" related
t6 the roots of the company in
Martha Graham's work and to
t!he continuous process of
gfowth and regeneration in art
through successive creators.
' I had at least two initial ques
tions regarding the company
and its philosophy. The first,
pjprhaps trivial, grew from the
American Conservatory
Theatre's (ACT) sponsorship of
.t&e company's San Francisco
tfebut of 10 performances,
April 18 through 28, at the
Marine's Memorial Theater.
ACT
.As it turns out, ACT has
Sponsored dance companies in
the past, including the Dance
heater of Harlem three years
afco. Whether ACT will con
tinue to sponsor dance per
formances is not clear, al
though Hatch Walker did ex
press the hope that this en
gagement was part of a trend
by theater groups brought
about by the related natures of
drama and dance.
More importantly perhaps, I
wondered about the begin
fijtngs of Asakawalker and their
Ifflks with the Graham style.
VViould I find a lack of original-
given the descriptions of
?fyd the publicity about the
company as being "in the
(jfaham mold?"
On the contrary, Asakawa
arid Hatch Walker (which name
he prefers to plain "Walker"

because there are too many of
those around already) see their
company as the "next step" in
a creative process which ex
tends from Graham to them
and eventually into another
generation of dancers.
Soloists
Both soloists in the Graham
company, Asakawa and Hatch
Walker, have been choreog
raphing and performing to
gether on their own since 1970,
although they did not leave the
Graham company until 1976.
Hatch Walker was trained
principally as a ballet dancer,
debuting with the National Bal
let of Canada in Swan Lake. Be
fore joining the Graham com
pany, Hatch Walker choreog
raphed while at Ballet Rambert
and for a television station in
Tokyo.
Japanese
Coincidently it seems, his
wife, Asakawa, is Japanese, hav
ing come to this country in
1962. (The company debuted at
the Japan House in NYC.) She
studied in New York at the
Graham studios, "where I
never left during the days or
nights." She became a com
pany member in only two
months, dancing such roles as
Clytemnestra, in Clytemnestra,
and Medea in Cave of the
Heart.
Both Asakawa and Hatch
Walker were also very pleased
and proud to explain the inter
national nature of their com
pany. The company, which
now numbers 10 in all, was
drawn in part from open audi
tions but mostly by less sudden
means. Four came to the Hatch
Walkers in New York after hav
ing studied with them in mas
terclasses in Santa Barbara, the
Phillipines and Mexico.
Diamonds
Hatch Walker described the
care necessary for the selec
tion and subsequent teaching
of the company dancers as

"like cutting and polishing a
diamond, or another precious
stone." He hopes that the
company will "create an envi
ronment for growth and
creativity for all its members to
work with in the framework of
the company."
The dancers see the location
of the company in New York as
a great challenge. Hatch
Walker remarked that "the
competition is very difficult but
it just makes you work harder."

Asakawa continued that, "One
of the things you learn in dance
is how to survive. It makes you
strong."
The process of building a
company of course takes time
but the Asakawalker Dance
Company has gone far in its
short life. After its debut of two
separate programs by Asakawa
and Hatch Walker the com
pany will return to New York
for a series of performances in
cluding one on Broadway. This

summer they will again per
form at the Festival at Jacob's
Pillow and they hope to tour
Mexico next, with an eventual
tour of the Orient planned.
(Program I, which will be per
formed at the Marine's Memo
rial Theater April 18 to 22, in
cludes Ritual Fantasies I and 11,
Reflections of Romance and
Opalescence. Program II

ACT
.As it turns out, ACT has
Sponsored dance companies in
the past, including the Dance
heater of Harlem three years
afco. Whether ACT will con
tinue to sponsor dance per
formances is not clear, al
though Hatch Walker did ex
press the hope that this en
gagement was part of a trend
by theater groups brought
about by the related natures of
drama and dance.
More importantly perhaps, I
wondered about the begin
fijtngs of Asakawalker and their
Ifflks with the Graham style.
VViould I find a lack of original-
given the descriptions of
?fyd the publicity about the
company as being "in the
(jfaham mold?"
On the contrary, Asakawa
arid Hatch Walker (which name
he prefers to plain "Walker"

because there are too many of
those around already) see their
company as the "next step" in
a creative process which ex
tends from Graham to them
and eventually into another
generation of dancers.
Soloists
Both soloists in the Graham
company, Asakawa and Hatch
Walker, have been choreog
raphing and performing to
gether on their own since 1970,
although they did not leave the
Graham company until 1976.
Hatch Walker was trained
principally as a ballet dancer,
debuting with the National Bal
let of Canada in Swan Lake. Be
fore joining the Graham com
pany, Hatch Walker choreog
raphed while at Ballet Rambert
and for a television station in
Tokyo.
Japanese
Coincidently it seems, his
wife, Asakawa, is Japanese, hav
ing come to this country in
1962. (The company debuted at
the Japan House in NYC.) She
studied in New York at the
Graham studios, "where I
never left during the days or
nights." She became a com
pany member in only two
months, dancing such roles as
Clytemnestra, in Clytemnestra,
and Medea in Cave of the
Heart.
Both Asakawa and Hatch
Walker were also very pleased
and proud to explain the inter
national nature of their com
pany. The company, which
now numbers 10 in all, was
drawn in part from open audi
tions but mostly by less sudden
means. Four came to the Hatch
Walkers in New York after hav
ing studied with them in mas
terclasses in Santa Barbara, the
Phillipines and Mexico.
Diamonds
Hatch Walker described the
care necessary for the selec
tion and subsequent teaching
of the company dancers as

"like cutting and polishing a
diamond, or another precious
stone." He hopes that the
company will "create an envi
ronment for growth and
creativity for all its members to
work with in the framework of
the company."
The dancers see the location
of the company in New York as
a great challenge. Hatch
Walker remarked that "the
competition is very difficult but
it just makes you work harder."

Asakawa continued that, "One
of the things you learn in dance
is how to survive. It makes you
strong."
The process of building a
company of course takes time
but the Asakawalker Dance
Company has gone far in its
short life. After its debut of two
separate programs by Asakawa
and Hatch Walker the com
pany will return to New York
for a series of performances in
cluding one on Broadway. This

summer they will again per
form at the Festival at Jacob's
Pillow and they hope to tour
Mexico next, with an eventual
tour of the Orient planned.
(Program I, which will be per
formed at the Marine's Memo
rial Theater April 18 to 22, in
cludes Ritual Fantasies I and 11,
Reflections of Romance and
Opalescence. Program II
scheduled for April 24 adds Vis
ion for Ritual and The Farwell

Takako Asakawa
. ; "So many dance companies
now only want, 'one, two,
three-technique; one, two,
three-make money.' We do not
.•want that," said Takako
Asakawa of the Asakawalker
Dance Company, giving em
phasis to her words with quick
hand motions.
Indeed, the idea of time,
tjoth long and short, ran
throughout my conversation
With the founders of
Asakawalker, Asakawa and
David Hatch Walker. "Short"
related to the age of the com
pany, now only two and one
half years old. "Long" related
t6 the roots of the company in
Martha Graham's work and to
t!he continuous process of
gfowth and regeneration in art
through successive creators.
' I had at least two initial ques
tions regarding the company
and its philosophy. The first,
pjprhaps trivial, grew from the
American Conservatory
Theatre's (ACT) sponsorship of
.t&e company's San Francisco
tfebut of 10 performances,
April 18 through 28, at the
Marine's Memorial Theater.
