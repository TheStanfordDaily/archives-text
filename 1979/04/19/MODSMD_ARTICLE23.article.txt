## Palo Alto presents a Tom Stoppard play 
### 
The most remarkable aspect of the Palo Alto
Players' Rosencrantz and Cuildenstern Are Dead is
the collaboration between set and theme. Tom
Stoppard's comedy centers around two minor ac
tors from Shakespeare's Hamlet. The lights come
up on the confused pair waiting for the unknown
in an unknown location.
Hamlet's two old school pals are puppets of King
Claudius, murderer of Hamlet's father and
usurper of the throne. They understand neither
Claudius' treachery nor Hamlet's apparent mad
ness. They only know that they had best remain
wherever they are for whatever purpose they were
intended.
Other characters — Hamlet, King Claudius,
Oueen Gertrude, Ophelia and a troupe of trage
dians, enter and exit at will: but Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are too frightened and bewildered to
move from the stage. The leader of the tragedians,
known simply as the Player, possesses all the
awareness that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern lack.
He tells them, "We're actors . . . We pledged our
identities, secure in the conventions of our trade,
that someone would be watching." The Player is
always in character, always in costume and always
onstage.
The troupe performs a play within a play: the
bloody plot of Hamlet, including the deaths of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The two almost
recognize the story and themselves but realization
once more passes them by.
Bruce McLeod's set of platforms tumbles down
toward the audience creating a world both baffling

and balanced. A series of cords radiates from a
point behind the hill of platforms. Heavy screen
figures, like souls of the lost, hang about the stage.
Besides being unnecessary, these figures are
much too blatant in their symbolism; the actors
often bump into them, setting the suspended fi
gures swinging.
The cording, however, proves a highly success
ful device. It creates the illusion of characters in
creasing in size when they enter from behind the
pile of flats; and that of characters diminishing
physically when they exit at that focal point. The
protagonists' fear of moving off the stage, follow
ing others into that dark region becomes under
standable. But the fear of moving is essentially a
fear of changing and living. When Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are finally forced to follow Ham
let over the platforms, into that netherland, they
seal their deaths.
Director Robert Kelley moves his actors well:
despite their self-confinement, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern avoid visual stagnation by using the
whole of the set. Kelley could use a firmer hand in
his direction of Guildenstern. Actor Roy Parker
stumbles over several lines and seems unsure
about his character as well — at times gawky and
frustrated when he should be smooth in his anger.
The role of Rosencrantz, the naive and unques
tioning companion, is easier but Steve Walton car
ries charm and whimsy to his role. Extremely lika
ble, his mimes (i.e., riding a horse, being buried)
reveal the character's childlike impetuousness.
His fine sense of comic timing brings out the full
humor of Stoppard's wit.

Peter Paskos would have done well by being
more confident as the Player, someone who re
vives from every stage death, and knows that "ev
ery exit (is) an entrance somewhere else." His
troupe of tragedians, including David Kobrin as
the young and grimy Alfred, amuse greatly in their
preening and posturing antics.
Unfortunately, the costumes on the tragedians
are neither as ragged nor soiled as their poverty
would indicate. Elizabeth Roberts' other cos
tumes, while adequately Elizabethan, contribute
nothing thematically or visually to the production.
One of the most visually attractive moments in
the production is a dawn. John Rathman's lighting,
however, is inconsistent: spots follow an actor a
second too late, cues are missed. The warm glow
of dawn almost, but not quite, makes up for these
errors.
Hamlet's make-up shows up rather morbidly on
stage. Granted, he is supposed to look ill and
haunted but he is not already in the grave. The
garish splotches of make-up on the tragedians
help remedy their clean costumes and the
make-up on the rest of the cast is satisfactorily
natural.
Despite the erratic technical quality, Rosen
crantz and Cuildenstern proves an enjoyable,
thought-provoking production. Walton's Rosen
crantz, McLeod's illusionary set and Stoppard's
intriguing concepts are sufficient reason to attend
a performance.
(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is play
ing at the Palo Alto Community Theatre tonight
through Saturday. Tickets are $3 tonight and $4
Friday and Saturday.)
