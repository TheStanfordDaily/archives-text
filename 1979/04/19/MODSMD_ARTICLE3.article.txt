# South African urges divestment

### Robert Reed 
While denying the need for revolu
tion in his country, black South Afri
can journalist Vuyani Mrwetyana cal
led upon America and American
blacks to help bring about a change
in the policy of apartheid in South
Africa.
"If America disinvests, that will
help," Mrwetyana told a group of
about 15 persons in Ujamaa lounge
Tuesday afternoon. He denied that
American divestment from South Af
rica would do more harm than good
for the blacks there.
"We are suffering today, and
America is investing there — so that
is no excuse," said Mrwetyana. "If
America disinvests, the white man
will start to suffer."
Opposition newspaper
Mrwetyana, visiting the United
States on an International Visitors
Program funded by the federal gov
ernment, is the editor of an opposi
tion newspaper in Transkei. Transkei
is a nominally independent nation
inside of South Africa's boundaries.
Mrwetyana confronted the South
African government in a heated
editorial protesting the death of Ste
ven Biko, a South African black
leader who died in prison.
Because of the editorial, he said,
he was jailed and placed in solitary
confinement. The government
seized the newspaper's facilities and
it was forced to stop publication.
"I was never taken to court, never
told why I was there," he said. But he
said he knew he was imprisoned be
cause he was speaking for the rights
of blacks.
Before his newspaper began pub
lishing, Mrwetyana said, there was
no real paper for the blacks. "We
were (represented as) people who
were sitting, sleeping, eating, com
mitting crimes — who had no ideals
in life."

"We do not want revolution,"
Mrwetyana said. He explained that
because black South Africans are un
armed, uneducated, unorganized
and undernourished, they are not
ready for revolution.
"If we start into violence, they will
destroy us — and the West will back
them," Mrwetyana said. "There is so
much we could lose through revolu
tion."
"Where do our hopes lie? . . . We
rely upon you, black Americans. You

are the only brothers we have in the
world whose chains have been un
shackled," said Mrwetyana. "I know
you are not free, but you are in a
better situation than us."
Mrwetyana said that because
American blacks were free to pres
sure their own government, they
should lead the struggle for the lib
eration of South African blacks.
"My enslavement is an insult to
you (black Americans)," Mrwetyana
