Military asserts self-rule
Tyre, Lebanon — The Israeli-backed Christian
military in southern Lebanon yesterday declared
itself under "self-rule" and proclaimed a new
"Free Lebanon" state, the Israeli radio said. The
declaration came hours after the Christians shel
led a Lebanese army unit as it joined U.N.
peacekeepers in the area.
"Our intention will be to liberate all Lebanon
from all the invaders and all who are foreigners
and who have had intentions against Lebanon,"
said a militia leader, Maj. Saad Haddad.
The Christian militia contends the Lebanese
forces are heavily influenced by Syria, seen by the
Christians as rivals for control of Lebanon. The
Israelis and Christians share the view that a
Lebanese army aided bySyria will allow Palestinian
guerrilla infiltration of the Israeli border and
heighten tension in the area.
Vietnam peace talks begin
Bangkok, Thailand — Vietnam's peace negotia
tions with China opened in Hanoi yesterday with a
Vietnamese proposal that a demilitarized zone be
established on its border with China, according to
Asian news agency reports received in Bangkok.
It was the first day of talks between the two
Communist neighbors, who fought a border war
in February.
Vietnamese negotiator Vice Foreign Minister
Phan Hien said Chinese troops still occupied more
than 10 areas in Vietnamese territory. He said the
Chinese were continuing to strengthen their
forces along the border and that the situation was
"very tense."
He proposed that both armies withdraw two to
three miles from the border recognized before the
Chinese invasion Feb. 17, and that prisoners of war
be exchanged soon, according to a Radio Hanoi
broadcast.
Rhodesian elections thwarted
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Officials predict at least 60
percent of the electorate will vote in the five-day
elections under way to bring limited black rule to
Rhodesia.

Geoff Hedges, Rhodesia's assistant police
commissioner, said "terrorist intimidation" was
responsible for a low turnout yesterday at Fort
Victoria in the south, where guerrilla activity has
been high.
Hedges said that in some cases guerrillas were
abducting blacks in rural villages to prevent them
from voting. But he said overall guerrilla activity
had been lower than expected.
Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, co-leaders
of the Patriotic Front guerrilla organization, insist
the new government will be a facade for continued
white rule, and have vowed to disrupt the elec
tions. So far only a few scattered incidents have
been reported.
Ms. Marvin to get $104,000
Los Angeles — Michelle Triola Marvin, the un
married woman who claimed Lee Marvin owed her
$1.8 million, was awarded $104,000 yesterday by a
judge who said she needed help to rebuild her life
after a long love affair with the actor.
Although the award was tar less than the amount
Ms. Marvin had sought — which she claimed was
half his income during the six years they lived
together — she said she was "excited to get some
thing" and viewed it as a victory for women.
But she said she is disillusioned about love af
fairs. "I think if a man wants to leave a toothbrush
at my house, he can bloody well marry me," she
said. "Enough is enough."
Marvin likewise saw the ruling as a victory. "I
think it's sensational," the actor said at his home in
Tucson, Ariz.
Superior Court judge Arthur Marshall, in a deci
sion which will serve as a guideline in similar
cases, reached outside the rigid requirements of
contract law to grant Ms. Marvin what he called
"an equitable remedy."
" The court in equity awards plaintiff $104,000 for
rehabilitation purposes," Marshall said, "so that
she may have the economic means to re-educate
herself and to learn new, employable skills."
Three killed in copter crash
Newark, N.|. — A commuter helicopter plunged
106 feet onto a runway at Newark International

Airport shortly after takeoff last night. At least
three persons were killed and 10 others injured,
authorities said.

18 people, including a crew of three, were aboard
the3o-passenger New York Airways aircraft, which
came down on its side on runway 22.
FAA spokesman Robert Fulton said the pilot of
the Sikorsky S6l helicopter reported shortly after
takeoff that he was experiencing control prob
lems.
Marijuana laws lose in Berkeley
Berkeley — Voters in this university town have
cut off money which supports the enforcement of
state and federal laws against marijuana.
Berkeley voters also passed on Tuesday mea
sures which stop the city from using local funds to
support South Africa's apartheid government.
The marijuana measure would prohibit spend
ing city funds to enforce state and federal laws
against pot smoking. It also directed police and
other city officials to lobby for repeal of marijuana
laws. The final count of all 118 precincts showed
the measure passing 17,507 to 9681.
The marijuana campaign was financed by a $1-
per-ticket raffle. The winner — identified only by
number at a Monday drawing — won a kilogram of
Colombian grass.
