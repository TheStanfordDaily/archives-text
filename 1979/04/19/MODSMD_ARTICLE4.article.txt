# Election turnout low
## 
### 
Yesterday's voter turnout in the
annual spring election was "very
low," according to Dayna
Coldfine, ASSU Elections Co
missioner. Of approximately
12,500 eligible voters, only 1140
cast ballots yesterday. Today is the
last day to vote.
At least 20 percent of all regis
tered students must vote in order
for fee assessment proposals to
be passed. Even if a given assess
ment receives a "yes" vote by a
majority of voters, it does not pass
unless the minimum 20 percent of
students has voted.
In last year's election, eight fee
assessments failed to secure the

necessary 20 percent turnout. A
special election was then called to
again put the proposals before the
student body.
Goldfine estimated that at least
2300 votes total must be cast to
validate this election. Today,
more than 1150 people must vote.
On the spring ballot are 17 fee
assessment proposals, various
"senate reform" amendments
and referenda and the traditional
candidate slates for Council of
Presidents and senior class offic
ers.
All registered students are elig
ible to vote.
