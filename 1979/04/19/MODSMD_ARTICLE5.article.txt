# Directional signs to be added
## 
### Steve Brown 
New directional signs for motorists
will be installed on campus before
autumn quarter at a cost of between
$10,000 and $20,000.
Funding for 60 new signs is in
cluded in the $1.6 million General
Plant Improvement Program (GPI)
approved by the Board of Trustees
April 9.
The dark brown and ivory signs will
have arrows for up to five major
buildings or locations and will be
placed at major intersections. About
60 existing signs will also be im
proved or replaced where damaged
or out-of-date.
Sites and labelling for the signs
were determined by the Facilities
Planning Office after making a field
inventory with the aid of student
employees. A tentative listing was
sent to the Provost's Office for final
review by department heads.
Confusion
According to Steve Schmidt, as
sociate planner for facilities and
properties, the project is necessary
because of confusion caused by
street closures, new buildings and
department relocations. Need is
greatest near the Medical Center,
and new signs should be in by May to
aid visitors and emergency vehicles.
Plant Services, which is responsi
ble for construction and installation,
will complete the campus-wide pro
ject by August or September,
Schmidt said.
Lieutenant Marvin Moore of the
Dept. of Public Safety believes signs
will improve the present situation.
"Quite a few people come onto
campus, become disoriented and
flag an officer down. He then directs
or escorts them to their destination. I

think people have a need for the
signs," Moore said.
John Lerry, facilities engineer and
manager of GPI, said that the $9000 to
$10,000 needed for work near the
Med Center was provided from this
year's GPI while the rest of the fund
ing will be part of $15,000 budgeted
for street striping and signs in the
1979-80 GPI.
His estimate was that total cost
would be "closer to the the upper
end" of the $10,000 to $20,000 range,
and he added that a contingency
fund was available if expenses ran
higher.
Unobtrusive signs
The signs are meant to be unobtru
sive and fit into the environment,
said Lerry.
Vandalism has been a problem,

said Master Planner Oscar Nelson,
but "we like to think of it as a com
pliment to our design." Many signs
were stolen from campus during Big
Came week, including all 12 along
Palm Drive. A total of 21 were re
turned by Berkeley Police without
charges being filed.
The signs will be repainted if pos
sible, but holes torn in some will
make repair difficult. To discourage
theft of new signs, their bolt threads
will be smashed. Schmidt said, how
ever, "We have to rely on people's
basic goodness, and I don't think
there should be any problem."
After the signs are installed, said
Portia Holmes of Tresidder Informa
tion Center, "They should be a great
help for people trying to find their
way around campus."
