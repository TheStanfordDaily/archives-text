Tom Hall, returning football let
terman, was hospitalized with foot
lacerations yesterday around 6 p.m.,
after he was involved in an accident
with an automobile while riding his
motorcycle.
Hall, a six-foot-five, 220-pound
sophomore from Newport News,
Va., is an outside linebacker here.
During the 1978 season he had 90
tackles and made one interception.
Hall was scheduled to undergo
surgery last night at Stanford Hospi
tal for an ankle injury, according to
Nurse Susan Bailey.
Hall and a passenger were riding
his motorcycle down Santa Teresa
St., away from Tresidder Union,
when apparently a car backed out of

a parking space and struck the
motorcycle, according to Patrolman
Kevin MacDougald of the Stanford
Dept. of Public Safety.
"I'm shocked," said head football
coach Rod Dowhower. "I'm just wor
ried about Tom Hall's foot. We'll see
how Tom Hall is first. I'm glad it's his
foot and not the rest of his body be
cause I think his foot will recover.
This sure isn't going to help us any,
but my first concern is not the defen
sive line, it's Tom Hall."
The passengerwas taken to Cowell
Student Health Center and released.
No charges have been filed against
the driver, who was not injured. The
names of the passenger and driver
were not released pending the com
pletion of the police report.
