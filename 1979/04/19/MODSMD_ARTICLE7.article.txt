# Predicting the superquake:
## Scientists work to refine methods before it happens 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The
southern leg of the mighty San
Andreas Fault, like a watch
spring that's wound too tightly,
is gathering strength.
Someday — tomorrow, the
next day or 50 years from now
— the spring will snap loose.
What experts believe could be
the next American superquake
will rumble across Southern
California with the energy of
thousands of hydrogen
bombs.
Optimists expect 3000 to die,
most of them in the heavily
populated Los Angeles area.
Pessimists put the death toll
closer to 12,000. And the num
bers could be mind-boggling
— into the tens of thousands —
if a major dam breaks and
floodwaters cover residential
neighborhoods.

An AP News Special

Unless, of course, the ear
thquake is predicted. Many
scientists feel it might be,
though they warn that the art of
predicting earthquakes is a
young and imprecise science
— there are no guarantees.
And although Southern
California is often cited as the
likely candidate for the next
great quake, the state offers
few safe hiding places. Large,
damaging tremors are not li
mited to the San Andreas.
"There is, in my view, a 50-50
chance of a major earthquake
somewhere in California — not

just on the San Andreas Fault —
in the next 10 years," Bruce
Bolt, a seismologist at UC-
Berkeley, said this week.
Such comments give a sense
of urgency to scientists here
and around the world as they
try to discover when and where
the earth will move and un
leash the awesome power of an
earthquake.
The southern San Andreas
released more than a century
of accumulated energy in three
frightening minutes on Jan. 9,
1857. The earth rolled and
shook so violently that motion
sickness and vomiting were
reported in Los Angeles, some
70 miles from the epicenter.
Devastation
The fault's northern leg
snapped on April 18,1906. The
Great San Francisco Ear
thquake and the firestorm that
followed devastated the city
and claimed 700 lives.
"The 1857 and the 1906 ear
thquakes will be repeated —
there's simply no way around
it,"says Jerry Eaton of the U.S.
Geological Survey's National
Center for Earthquake Re
search in Menlo Park.
Many scientists suspect
another 1857 tremor will come
first, mostly because the
southern end of the fault has
had more time to gather
strength. But each segment
must someday break loose.
So, Eaton said, broad predic
tions of the greater ear
thquakes have already been

made for northern and south
ern California.
Refining problem
"The problem is to refine
them so they will be useful, so
we'll be able to say that over
most of that interval of a cen
tury or so between great
quakes that the big earthquake
is not at hand yet.
"Then ultimately it will come
down to a very short period of
time when, hopefully, we can
say: the system has now been
recharged and symptoms are
occurring which suggest the
big earthquake is imminent."
Scientists in the United
States, China, Russia, Japan
and other countries are trying
to identify and interpret the
clues that will make predic
tions possible.
There have been spectacular
successes: Chinese scientists
are credited with saving hun
dreds of thousands of lives by
accurately predicting at least
two major quakes. But the
Chinese have had their failures
— both false alarms and mas
sive quakes that were not
foretold.
The worldwide effort is
marked by an unusual degree
of international cooperation,
but most earth scientists agree
that routine earthquake pre
diction isn't likely for at least
another decade.
"But we could stumble on
something tomorrow" that
would allow a solid prediction,
especially in California, said

Clarence Allen of the Califor
nia Institute of Technology.
"The big problem," the
geophysicist said, "is that pre
dicting earthquakes on a con
sistent basis is just such a far
cry from predicting a few of
them successfully, which we
have done." The three or four
successful American predic
tions have involved small and
generally harmless quakes.
Good chance
Southern California is prob
ably the most thoroughly in
strumented piece of land in the
world and if a large quake
began to form in the region
tomorrow, there's a good
chance it would be detected.
The area along the San An
dreas and the Palmdale Bulge
— an ominous and un
explained ground swelling that
covers as much land as Indiana
— is covered with seismog
raphs, gravimeters, mag
netometers, tiltmeters and a
dazzling array of other devices.
"If a large earthquake started
to happen in one of our net
works, there's a good chance
we would see the physical
changes that precede it," said
Robert Wallace, chief scientist
at the USGS center.
"If all our instruments in one
area started showing
anomalies, we'd be on pretty
good ground to make a predic
tion. So it could be that within
our network we could have a
successful prediction almost
anytime."

California gets the lion's
share of the federal govern
ment's $50 million annual
budget for earthquake re
search, partly because it's the
most seismically active state
with an average of about one
earthquake a day, most of
them very small.
And the Palmdale Bulge, dis
covered through old survey re
cords in 1974 along the San An
dreas in the Mojave Desert,
still makes scientists nervous.
They're not sure whether it
foretells a major quake, but, as
Eaton put it, anything that large
on the San Andreas "certainly
makes us sit up and pay very
close attention."
And, Eaton said, "a repetition
of the California earthquakes
of 1857 and 1906 really loom as
the most menacing" future
temblors facing the United
States.
Precursors
The key to predicting such
giants, as well as their smaller
brothers, seems to involve
precursors: events or changes
that occur before earthquakes.
If you find a precursor, the
theory says, an earthquake
shouldn't be far behind.
Nearly 200 possible precur
sors have been identified and
the list is still growing.
Among the stronger sus
pects: foreshocks, small
quakes that precede larger
ones; miniquake swarms, flur
ries of very small quakes;
changes in the speed with

which shock waves move
through the earth; changes in
ground water levels; changes
in local magnetic fields; re
lease of gases such as radioac
tive radon from the earth; mi
nute tilts in the ground; bulges
or uplifts in the surface; even
strange behavior by animals.
Not so easy
With so much to choose
from, Eaton said, geologists

were full of optimism about
five years ago, "when many
peopie . . . thought it was
going to be a simple, easy thing
to run out and record any
changeable geophysical factors
you could dream up and a pre
diction would drop out.
"But now it appears that's
not going to happen and we're
going to have to do it the hard
