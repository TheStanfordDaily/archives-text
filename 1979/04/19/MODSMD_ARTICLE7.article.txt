# Predicting the superquake:
## Scientists work to refine methods before it happens 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The
southern leg of the mighty San
Andreas Fault, like a watch
spring that's wound too tightly,
is gathering strength.
Someday — tomorrow, the
next day or 50 years from now
— the spring will snap loose.
What experts believe could be
the next American superquake
will rumble across Southern
California with the energy of
thousands of hydrogen
bombs.
Optimists expect 3000 to die,
most of them in the heavily
populated Los Angeles area.
Pessimists put the death toll
closer to 12,000. And the num
bers could be mind-boggling
— into the tens of thousands —
if a major dam breaks and
floodwaters cover residential
neighborhoods.

An AP News Special

Unless, of course, the ear
thquake is predicted. Many
scientists feel it might be,
though they warn that the art of
predicting earthquakes is a
young and imprecise science
— there are no guarantees.
And although Southern
California is often cited as the
likely candidate for the next
great quake, the state offers
few safe hiding places. Large,
damaging tremors are not li
mited to the San Andreas.
"There is, in my view, a 50-50
chance of a major earthquake
somewhere in California — not

just on the San Andreas Fault —
in the next 10 years," Bruce
Bolt, a seismologist at UC-
Berkeley, said this week.
Such comments give a sense
of urgency to scientists here
and around the world as they
try to discover when and where
the earth will move and un
leash the awesome power of an
earthquake.
The southern San Andreas
released more than a century
of accumulated energy in three
frightening minutes on Jan. 9,
1857. The earth rolled and
shook so violently that motion
sickness and vomiting were
reported in Los Angeles, some
70 miles from the epicenter.
Devastation
The fault's northern leg
snapped on April 18,1906. The
Great San Francisco Ear
thquake and the firestorm that
followed devastated the city
and claimed 700 lives.
"The 1857 and the 1906 ear
thquakes will be repeated —
there's simply no way around
it,"says Jerry Eaton of the U.S.
Geological Survey's National
Center for Earthquake Re
search in Menlo Park.
Many scientists suspect
another 1857 tremor will come
first, mostly because the
southern end of the fault has
had more time to gather
strength. But each segment
must someday break loose.
So, Eaton said, broad predic
tions of the greater ear
thquakes have already been

made for northern and south
ern California.
Refining problem
"The problem is to refine
them so they will be useful, so
we'll be able to say that over
most of that interval of a cen
tury or so between great
quakes that the big earthquake
is not at hand yet.
"Then ultimately it will come
down to a very short period of
time when, hopefully, we can
say: the system has now been
recharged and symptoms are
occurring which suggest the
big earthquake is imminent."
Scientists in the United
States, China, Russia, Japan
and other countries are trying
to identify and interpret the
clues that will make predic
tions possible.
There have been spectacular
successes: Chinese scientists
are credited with saving hun
dreds of thousands of lives by
accurately predicting at least
two major quakes. But the
Chinese have had their failures
— both false alarms and mas
sive quakes that were not
foretold.
The worldwide effort is
marked by an unusual degree
of international cooperation,
but most earth scientists agree
that routine earthquake pre
diction isn't likely for at least
another decade.
"But we could stumble on
something tomorrow" that
would allow a solid prediction,
especially in California, said

Clarence Allen of the Califor
nia Institute of Technology.
"The big problem," the
geophysicist said, "is that pre
dicting earthquakes on a con
sistent basis is just such a far
cry from predicting a few of
them successfully, which we
have done." The three or four
successful American predic
tions have involved small and
generally harmless quakes.
Good chance
Southern California is prob
ably the most thoroughly in
strumented piece of land in the
world and if a large quake
began to form in the region
tomorrow, there's a good
chance it would be detected.
The area along the San An
dreas and the Palmdale Bulge
— an ominous and un
explained ground swelling that
covers as much land as Indiana
— is covered with seismog
raphs, gravimeters, mag
netometers, tiltmeters and a
dazzling array of other devices.
"If a large earthquake started
to happen in one of our net
works, there's a good chance
we would see the physical
changes that precede it," said
Robert Wallace, chief scientist
at the USGS center.
"If all our instruments in one
area started showing
anomalies, we'd be on pretty
good ground to make a predic
tion. So it could be that within
our network we could have a
successful prediction almost
anytime."

California gets the lion's
share of the federal govern
ment's $50 million annual
budget for earthquake re
search, partly because it's the
most seismically active state
with an average of about one
earthquake a day, most of
them very small.
And the Palmdale Bulge, dis
covered through old survey re
cords in 1974 along the San An
dreas in the Mojave Desert,
still makes scientists nervous.
They're not sure whether it
foretells a major quake, but, as
Eaton put it, anything that large
on the San Andreas "certainly
makes us sit up and pay very
close attention."
And, Eaton said, "a repetition
of the California earthquakes
of 1857 and 1906 really loom as
the most menacing" future
temblors facing the United
States.
Precursors
The key to predicting such
giants, as well as their smaller
brothers, seems to involve
precursors: events or changes
that occur before earthquakes.
If you find a precursor, the
theory says, an earthquake
shouldn't be far behind.
Nearly 200 possible precur
sors have been identified and
the list is still growing.
Among the stronger sus
pects: foreshocks, small
quakes that precede larger
ones; miniquake swarms, flur
ries of very small quakes;
changes in the speed with

which shock waves move
through the earth; changes in
ground water levels; changes
in local magnetic fields; re
lease of gases such as radioac
tive radon from the earth; mi
nute tilts in the ground; bulges
or uplifts in the surface; even
strange behavior by animals.
Not so easy
With so much to choose
from, Eaton said, geologists

were full of optimism about
five years ago, "when many
peopie . . . thought it was
going to be a simple, easy thing
to run out and record any
changeable geophysical factors
you could dream up and a pre
diction would drop out.
"But now it appears that's
not going to happen and we're
going to have to do it the hard

superquake in California could rumble with the energy of thousands

way. We're going to have to re
ally understand the processes
and discover which are the crit
ical parameters."
The problem, said Barry
Raleigh of the USGS, is that "all
earthquakes apparently don't
behave in the same way. In
some cases earthquakes have
foreshocks and in others they
don't and there's no obvious
reason for that."
The same applies to virtually
every suspected precursor —
earthquakes can occur without
them and they can occur with
out the earthquake.
Experiments
So Raleigh and others are
devising laboratory experi
ments to "try to understand
the physical system that pro
duces earthquakes."
The most basic of quake
producing processes on a
global scale became apparent
barely a decade ago when the
theory of plate tectonics was
confirmed.
From plate tectonics came a
new picture of a world con
stantly shifting, a picture that
dramatically changed the earth
sciences and explained the
awesome power of the San
Andreas Fault.
The surface of this tectonic
Earth is neither solid nor sta
tionary. It's broken into great,
moving slabs — about seven
major plates that slide on a bed
of molten rock. The continents
are imbedded in some of the
plates; oceans ride on others.
Shifting and jostling
The plates and the world
they support are constantly
shiftingand jostling. When two
plates slide against each other,
their rough edges grind to
gether like sandpaper blocks.
Movement along the rims is
often slowed or stopped by
friction, while the rest of the

still-moving plates feed pres
sure into the junction.
Sooner or later, something
has to give. When the strain
becomes too great, the plates
lurch forward with a shatter
ing, thundering motion. Shock
waves ripple through the earth
in all directions. Earthquake!
The 600-mile San Andreas
Fault is the boundary between
the North American plate,
which supports the United
States, and the Pacific Plate,
which carries the Pacific Ocean
plus a long, thin sliver of land.
Los Angeles sits on that sliver.
Northwestern creep
The Pacific plate is creeping
northwest along the North
American plate and as a result,
the distance between Los
Angeles on the Pacific plate
and San Francisco on the North
American plate shrinks an inch
or two every year. The two
cities will pass each other in
about 30 million years as Los
Angeles heads for Alaska.
The San Andreas begins in
the Southern California desert
and winds its way northwest
ward through the state, pas
sing about 35 miles east of Los
Angeles and just west of San
Francisco.
The fault goes underwater
just outside San Francisco Bay,
then continues through Marin
County, following the coast for
about 100 miles before moving
offshore.
Cyclic eruption
The fault's northern and
southern legs, each about 250
miles long, seem to erupt in
major quakes every century or
so — a cycle researched by Cal
tech geologist Kerry Sieh.
Sieh cut a trench across the
southern San Andreas, about
35 miles northeast of Los
Angeles near Palmdale, to look
at the history of the fault. In the
exposed rock walls of the

trench, Sieh found the scars of
nine great quakes in the past
1500 years.
On the average, Sieh found,
the fault is quiet for about 160
years before it shudders with a
devastating quake. Then
comes another 160 years of
dormancy and another quake.
But that's just an average.
Some quakes were separated
by less than a century and
others by nearly 300 years.
That means, Sieh said, that
studying earthquakes — trying
to predict and prepare for
them — "is a valid thing to
spend our money on in South
ern California because you can
very much expect it to be a
problem during our lifetime or
at least our children's lifetime.
Forecasting
"The importance of this isn't
in earthquake prediction. It's
in earthquake forecasting."
A forecast tells geologists
and disaster workers where
earthquakes are most likely. It
says a certain fault is ripe for a
tremor.
A celebrated example came
last November when a major
earthquake jolted the Oaxaca
area of Mexico about a year
after University of Texas scien
tists said such an earthquake
could occur at any time.
Another group successfully
forecasted a Feb. 28 ear
thquake along the Alaska
coast.
Both forecasts were based
on seismic gaps — one of the
hottest new topics among
earth scientists. A gap is a nor
mally active stretch of a major
fault that has been unusually
free of earthquakes. Usually
the stretch has been bracketed
by recent quakes at either end.
Something similar exists
along the San Andreas.
"About 30 or 40 years ago we
recognized the seismic gap,"

where stresses are being fed
into the southern San Andreas,
said Caltech's Allen. The same
ominous situation exists along
the northern segment.
But although these gaps
forecast to scientists that major
quakes are coming, the period
of possibility remains too
broad at this point — within a
100 years — to be of any practi
cal value, Allen says. "You're
not going to evacuate build
ings. It's just economically,
politically and socially impos
sible."
Make a prediction
The problem, then, is to
close that window of vulnera
bility enough so that
emergency action is possible
— to turn the forecast into a
prediction.
"Whether or not it's ever
practical to evacuate hazard
ous buildings is a function very
largely of the time frame," says
Allen.
"For a day, there's not much
problem. But if you have a
one-month time frame, then it
gets more difficult. That would
involve very great economic
and social problems."
Last year, the Los Angeles
city Task Force on Earthquake
Prediction considered the so
cial and economic impacts of
several different earthquake
predictions.
Worst case
The worst hypothetical situa
tion described in the task
force's report involved a major
earthquake predicted three
years ahead of time with scien
tists HO percent sure of the
forecast.
The study said such a predic
tion would probably cause a
dramatic loss of population in
the affected area, a halt to most
construction, plummeting real
estate values, a drastic reduc
tion in bank loans, skyrocket
ing unemployment, a sharp
decline in retail sales, the
shutdown of many small
businesses, loss of tax revenue
and a cut in municipal services.
"There's no doubt there are
going to be problems," said
Caltech's Allen. "But the ques
tion is, are those problems
worse than the problems that
we have if we don't try to pre
dict earthquakes?"
Media dilemma
Scientists are hesitant to
guess how their first major
prediction might develop,
what they'll base it on and how
much warning they'll have.
Then there's the dilemma of
the news media.
"How we deal with the
media is a very major problem
for us . . . because at the
slightest hint of a prediction
they're out here knocking on
the door," Allen said.
The problem would be most
acute in the early stages, when
a tentative prediction might be
based as much on instinct as
evidence. "I would be very un
happy if my first hunch of an
impending quake appeared in
the newspaper," Allen said.
"It's my obligation to make
sure I'm right and to get the

criticism of my colleagues be
fore I go out on a limb and an
nounce these things.
"But on the other hand,"
Allen said, "if a prediction is
going to be of any use to soci
ety, it has to be released."
Partial solution
A partial solution is the
California Earthquake Predic
tion Evaluation Council, a
panel of earth scientists
formed to formally evaluate
predictions and the methods
that produced them. A similar

group exists on the federal
level.
The state council has met
less than half a dozen times,
said Allen, who serves on the
panel. In no case, he said, has it
found that "the chances of an
earthquake happening were
significantly greater than those
of a randomly occurring
event."
Actually, there is no shortage
of earthquake predictions in
California. O ua kes are foretold
on the basis of everything from

religious prophesies to the be
havior of well-loved pets.
"One thing that scares the
hell out of us," Allen said, "is
that almost any day an ear
thquake occurs, someone will
have predicted it. Most people
don't realize the number of
earthquakes that occur all the
time in California.
"If one of these days a major
earthquake occurs during one
of these highly publicized pre
dictions, then it's liable to set
science back 15 years."

The San Francisco earthquake of 1 ')()(> caused extensive damage at the University. The new library
building (above) was one of the many buildings destroyed. Geologists believe that another major
California earthquake is inevitable, and they are researching methods of prediction which they hope will
prevent the death of thousands of potential victims.

Memorial Church was one of the most badly damaged buildings on campus in the last "superquake" to
hit Northern California. Problems with lack of specificity in present earthquake prediction make it
impossible to pinpoint quakes so evacuations or other precautions can be undertaken, yet some
estimates are that as many as 12,000 could die in the next major quake here.
