## Amendment not on ballot properly 
### 
The article on the proposed
districting amendment to the
ASSU Constitution (Daily, April
17) unfortunately did not out
line the constitutional grounds
which the pre-election debate
surrounded. I would like to
take the opportunity to clarify
this matter for the benefit of all
concerned.
The ASSU Constitution
states that "Amendments to
this Constitution shall be sub
mitted to the membership of
the Association for ratification
upon approval by two-thirds of
the membership of the Senate,
provided that notice has been
given at the previous meeting,
or upon petition by five per
cent of the membership of the
Association.
"Petitions proposing
amendments shall be submit

ted to the Council of Presi
dents of the Association, who
shall direct the Elections
Commission to conduct an
election on the amendment in
not less than six nor more than
24 days after the opening of the
following quarter. Any such
postponement in the Spring
Quarter shall be until the fol
lowing Autumn Quarter." (Ar
ticle VII, Sections 1 and 2 —
emphasis mine.)
My understanding of the
situation is that upon the reali
zation that they could not get
the required 14 votes in the
ASSU Senate, those senators
supporting the districting
amendment decided that they
would take the other available
mechanism — that of direct
petitioning. That was last
Tuesday night, about mid

night.
Wednesday, about noon, a
student pointed out to me that
V11.2 clearly stated that the pet
ition mechanism had to be fol
lowed a quarter in advance.
Reading the above passages
indicates the simplicity of the
interpretation that was made. I
promptly notified Dayna
Coldfine, the elections com
missioner, and a representa
tive of the senate of that in
terpretation.
The senate's interpretation
of the issue seems to rest on
the following grounds:
—that the senate can make
the final interpretation of the
constitution (true enough);
—that the senate chairper
son can act with the authority
of the senate in between meet

ings (I was able to find nothing
in the constitution, by-laws or
standing rules of the senate to
support this decision);
—that Article VII, Section 2 re
fers to special, and not previ
ously scheduled, elections.
(Nothing in the body of the
document supports that con
tention).
I believe that there is a clear
violation of the constitution in
Senate Chairperson George
Drysdale's interpretation of
the matter. The other members
of the council, the Elections
Commission, the Committee
Staff Assistant and former Par
liamentarian and COP member
Greg Larson have affirmed my
stance as to the validity of all
possible reinterpretations.
I further believe that the ac
tivity was undertaken with the
best of intentions, but it is
quite sad that the senate finds
it necessary to defend itself
with neither constitutional nor
sensible backing after it has
been documented that they
are in fact acting in a clear viola
tion of the statement and in
tent of the rules of the associa
tion.
As such, I am using whatever
leverage I am able to exert as a
member of the Council of Pres
idents to see that the constitu
tion is followed on this week's
ballot. I may be overruled, but I
remain firm in my position.
