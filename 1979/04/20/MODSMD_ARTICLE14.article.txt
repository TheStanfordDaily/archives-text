## You can make a difference 
### 
The world seems deep in crisis. What hope
can individuals have of being heard in a milieu
dominated by the likes of ITT, IBM, and vast
nation-states? Even local government is gigantic
and our local institutions, like the University are
apparently immune to protests. Or is all this just
what we're supposed to think?
Let's look at South Africa. Two years ago, a
handful of Stanford students and workers de
cided that there was something wrong with the
University's implicit support of apartheid in
South Africa. Stanford owned (and still owns)
stock in companies like Ford and IBM that are
key parts of the apartheid system. Company
stockholders, mainly churches, put forward

Everyone who throws their
weight into the struggle for
justice and social change
makes a difference. Don't try
and tell yourself that you are
powerless. We all have more
power than we know, but only
if we use it.

proxy resolutions that called for terminating
these companies' operations in South Africa, for
no new investments or for an examination of
labor and sales practices. The University
abstained.
Petitions were signed and ignored, protests
made and brushed aside. Finally, hundreds of
Stanford people sat-in Old Union and 294 were
arrested. It was front-page news all the way to
Denver. The Stanford sit-in inspired students at
scores of schools across the country to raise the
same issue. Now there are over 200 campuses
with organizations protesting their schools'
links to apartheid. Last week, 170 Brandeis stu
dents staged a three-day sit-in. There have been
strikes at Dartmouth and Princeton. Columbia,
Michigan State, Amherst, Wisconsin, Smith,
University of Massachusetts and others have at
least partially sold their stocks in companies
crucial to apartheid.
The South African press worriedly covers the
issue. Business Week and Fortune have had
cover stories on South Africa investments. For
tune claims that it is the major political headache
in corporate boardrooms these days. And when
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andy
Young was asked by South Africa's Financial

Mail why loans were drying up for South Africa,
he said they shouldn't blame the U.S. govern
ment because "since the death of Steve Biko
and the public outcry against South Africa in the
United States on our college campuses, there's
been increasing pressure on American busi
ness."
And what about Stanford? Here the ongoing
work of such groups as the Memorial Church
Task Force has kept the issue in the public eye.
While Stanford is far from a truly anti-apartheid
position, the University does now officially op
pose loans to the government of South Africa
and it even opposes the operations of certain
companies there. South Africa wasn't even an
issue two years ago. Now it isn't just South
Africa-related investments that are scrutinized,
but also banks that lend to Chile, infant formula
manufacturers and others.
From one perspective it may seem that the
South Africa movement is another big institu
tion in itself, beyond the scale of the individual.
But that is categorically untrue. A few people
started it, a few hundred keep it going, and it
affects the lives of many, many more.
Last week, the first anti-draft demonstration in
thecountry was held here. A dozen people made
that demonstration happen. They made it pos
sible for hundreds to raise their voices in pro
test. That protest went over the radio and TV to
hundreds of thousands. And news of the protest
will go to activists all over the country, who will
organize protests at their schools and in their
communities and these voices will be heard.
Watch and see.
Vou can make a difference. Everyone who
throws their weight into the struggle for justice
and social change makes a difference. Thirty
people founded the Abalone Alliance a few
years ago to protest nuclear power. This sum
mer, up to three thousand people are expected
to try non-violently to keep the Diablo Canyon
nuclear plant from opening. Don't try and tell
yourself that you are powerless. We all have
more power than we know. . . .but only if we
.use it.
And Stanford is the perfect place to begin. It is
not an ivory tower, it is a key part of the
economic and political order. Don't wait until
you get to the "real" world to become involved.
That is a shallow excuse. Stanford is the real
world, and students here have an opportunity to
affect it. It is a lot harder to get involved when
you have a career, a family and a status to risk.
Now you have nothing to lose but your illusions.
Lose them or you will be lost to them.
