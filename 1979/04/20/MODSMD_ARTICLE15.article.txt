Ellsberg inspires
I just returned from the sec
ond lecture of Daniel Ellsberg's
class, "Nuclear Weapons and
U.S. Foreign Policy." To me, it
was incredibly apparent that
he was trying to bring to us a
great and important message
in the lecture. This is no great
revelation; he is quite explicit.
I write because it was a new
experience for me. It was the
great pouring out of the soul,
the heart, the love of a man,
the greatest gift he could give
us.

His message is quite simple:
mankind is heading re
lentlessly towards disaster, and
only people (e.g. you and me)
can stop it. He says he tastes
the ashes of future holocausts.
One need only look about the
world today to realize what is
possible in the future.
Daniel Ellsberg is speaking
specifically of nuclear
weapons. He is trying to teach
us lessons which he and his
colleagues learned the hard
way. One cannot listen to his
words too carefully.

After the lecture, I asked my
self what drives the United
States and the world to prolif
erate nuclear weapons? Why
should it happen? My mind
was blank for a moment and I
was shocked that after having
listened so intently to the
whole lecture I had missed the
answer to such a fundamental
question.
And then the answer hit. The
odd and painfully ironic di
lemma which Daniel Ellsberg
faces became clear. There is no
reason; it should not be so. We

(mankind) could have taken
other paths.
So the message stands. Let
us listen and think, then act.
We may yet save the world for
ourselves and our children.
And as I walked back to my
room after the lecture, I was
struck by the feeling that the
words, the man, the feelings
were connected in spirit
to . . .to what? ... to some
idea, some concept in my past.
Religion, or what religion is
supposed to be.
This is how one is supposed

to feel about church. The lec
ture was in its way as religious
as any sermon could be. And
from the brief bit I've seen, the
man's life is a prayer.
On behalf of all who wish to
join me, I would like to thank
you, Daniel Ellsberg, for exist
ing, for being what you are, for
doing what you do.

Food power lethal
There has been much debate
over alternative energy
sources available to the Ameri
can public. Prevalent in these
debates has been considera
tion of public safety. We be
lieve that the dangers of one
widespread form of energy
have been overlooked. We re
fer, of course, to alimentary
consumption — eating.
As Paul Cassell pointed out
in his article (Daily, April 18),
"solar power is six times more
lethal than nuclear power, and
wind power 15 times." Even
Cassell in his overwhelming
thoroughness has overlooked
the dangers of eating.
William Harrison, our ninth
president, died from eating too
many cherries and cream. And
as recently as 1974, Mama Cass
Elliot died tragically while eat
ing a ham sandwich. However,
"No one has ever been killed
by a commercial nuclear power
plant."
