## Ben Pollock Clubbing seals fraught with benefits 
### 
My buddy Noah approves of
the slaughter of harp seals.
I guess this shouldn't surprise
me.
While he, Noah Vale, is
perhaps unusual, he keeps
regular habits. Last night I ate
an early dinner and then
walked to the middle area of
the Quad. He was there, as I
expected.
Noah was untying the cords
that held his pup tent to his
pack. He assembled his tent
poles, and I helped him move
one of the park benches out of
one of the oases which dot the
center of the Quad.
"Conservationists and
ecologists are hypocrites,
when you get right down to it.
You know what I mean, Ben?"
asked Noah.
I confessed I didn't and said
his remark was quite surpris
ing. Of course, nothing that

guy says could shock me any
more.
"Well, y'see, Ben, I've been
reading about the ecologists'
latest antics. When I read
about a mess of them spraying
baby seals with red dye up
north, I thought I'd never stop
laughing. Why do they want

Canada has an abundant natural resource
- seals.

the li'l critters to get cancer?
"After I quit laughing," said
Noah, "I started to get mad. If
those folks had any foresight,
they'd start clubbing those
seals themselves."
"Noah, " I said, "if you
hadn't gotten kicked out of the
housing system, your
dormmates would have
lynched you for saying that. It's
a wonder your financial aid

hasn't been cut off because
you approve of that evil combi
nation of murdering cute ani
mals and capitalism. Explain
yourself, before they catch
you!"
"Well, you see," Noah be
gan, "with all the problems
concerning inflation and oil

shortages, the fool conser
vationists haven't got a leg to
stand on. These people ought
to be worried about synthetics,
you know, rayon, nylon and so
forth."
He continued. "Synthetics
are made from petroleum!
Here we are, soon to run out of
oil, and Canada has this abun
dant natural resource — seals.
Even the conservationists
admit there is little danger of
the harp seals becoming ex
tinct."
At this point, Noah and I
were driving in the tent stakes.
It was still twilight. "What
about cotton, linen and wool?"
I asked.
"Ben, when was the last time
you had clothing of completely
organic fibers? Even panties
are woven from synthetics.
Natural fibers are much more
expensive than pure synthetics
or even a mixture of the two.
Many folks in this country
just can't afford the pure or

ganic stuff.
"In short, Ben, humans
ought to go back to wearing
furs. It's free if you club or trap
animals yourself. I know some
people don't have the time.
Buying it is expensive, but it
lasts a lifetime.
"Ben, as the governor has
said, the time has come for us
to compromise our expecta
tions, even if it hurts. And look
at those ecologists: it is winter
in Canada — bitter cold — and
those guys are wearing down
parkas. Polyester coats just
aren't warm enough. These
guys protest the hunting of
whales and seals and turn right
around and wear feathers sto
len from slaughtered ducks."
"Come on, guy," I said,
"even if people kill ducks I bet
they sell the meat or eat it
themselves. It's not the same
thing."
"Alright then, Ben, let's start
a letter-writing campaign tel
ling seal hunters to export baby
seal meat to America. I imagine
it tastes a lot like veal."
Exasperated, I changed the
subject. Noah and I were now
inside his pup tent in the middle
of the Quad. It was dark out
side. "What's that you're get
ting out ofyourpack," lasked.
"I just bought it. It's
'Guatemala Guano.' Want to
try some?"

were driving in the tent stakes.
It was still twilight. "What
about cotton, linen and wool?"
I asked.
"Ben, when was the last time
you had clothing of completely

are woven from synthetics.
Natural fibers are much more
expensive than pure synthetics
or even a mixture of the two.

just can't afford the pure or

those guys are wearing down

"Come on, guy," I said,

"Alright then, Ben, let's start

it tastes a lot like veal."

inside his pup tent in the middle
of the Quad. It was dark out

My buddy Noah approves of
the slaughter of harp seals.
I guess this shouldn't surprise
me.
While he, Noah Vale, is
perhaps unusual, he keeps
regular habits. Last night I ate
an early dinner and then
walked to the middle area of
the Quad. He was there, as I
expected.
Noah was untying the cords
that held his pup tent to his
pack. He assembled his tent
poles, and I helped him move
one of the park benches out of
one of the oases which dot the
center of the Quad.
"Conservationists and
ecologists are hypocrites,
when you get right down to it.
You know what I mean, Ben?"
asked Noah.
I confessed I didn't and said
his remark was quite surpris
ing. Of course, nothing that

guy says could shock me any
more.
"Well, y'see, Ben, I've been
reading about the ecologists'
latest antics. When I read
about a mess of them spraying
baby seals with red dye up
north, I thought I'd never stop
laughing. Why do they want

the li'l critters to get cancer?
"After I quit laughing," said
Noah, "I started to get mad. If
those folks had any foresight,
they'd start clubbing those
seals themselves."
"Noah, " I said, "if you
hadn't gotten kicked out of the
housing system, your
dormmates would have
lynched you for saying that. It's
a wonder your financial aid

hasn't been cut off because
you approve of that evil combi
nation of murdering cute ani
mals and capitalism. Explain
yourself, before they catch
you!"
"Well, you see," Noah be
gan, "with all the problems
concerning inflation and oil

shortages, the fool conser
vationists haven't got a leg to
stand on. These people ought
to be worried about synthetics,
you know, rayon, nylon and so
forth."
He continued. "Synthetics
are made from petroleum!
Here we are, soon to run out of
oil, and Canada has this abun
dant natural resource — seals.
Even the conservationists
admit there is little danger of
the harp seals becoming ex
