Citizen Kane * •» * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
(1941) They call Kane the
greatest movie ever made, but
don't let that scare you away from
seeing it. It's a magnificent film
that's also one hell of a lot of fun
to watch. Orson Welles, who di
rected, starred, and co-wrote,
called movies the greatest elec
tric train set a boy ever had, and
Kane is infused with a sense of
pure joy in exploiting the
capabilities of the medium. Trad
ition has it that William Randolph
Hearst, after finding how similar
the life of Charles Foster Kane
was to his own, had the movie
suppressed; the truth may be
that audiences of the time were
simply unprepared for the film's
elliptical narrative structure and
precedent-breaking technique.
Also starring loseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead and Everett
Sloane.

Hurricane *
Palo Alto Square
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, lason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton Ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the who(e thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.
|an Troell directed; Sven Nykvist
was the cinematographer.

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
)ane Fonda and lack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
—Ron Lillejord

The Best Years of our Lives * # *
Friday, Kresge
(1946) What Coming Home is
to Vietnam, The Best Years of Our
Lives is to World War 11. This was
the first major film to deal not
with the war itself but with how it
affected the lives of those who
came home again. It is, perhaps,
too optimistic — the ending is an
unabashedly positive one — but
the film must still be respected as
a work that was part of the coun
try's "return to normalcy." Fred
ric March, Myrna Loy and Harold
Russell, an armless veteran who
won an Academy Award for por
traying just that, star. Gregg To
land (Citizen Kane) photo
graphed, and William Wyler di
rected.

Th • Magnificent Amhersons * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto * *
(1942) Directed by Orson Wel
les. Those who think Agnes
Moorehead was a product of
television should see her in this;
her portrayal of the aging, sexu
ally repressed spinster Aunt
Fanny is among the most power
ful ever recorded on film. The
movie's film technique is, if any
thing, even more advanced than
Kane; French film critic Andre
Bazin called it Welles' classic
period to go with the more
baroque style of Kane.
The Magnificent Ambersons
was cut by a thi rd after it received
unfavorable preview notices (the
studio previewed it at a theater
showing a Dorothy Lamour mus
ical); and an out-of-place happy
ending, not filmed by Welles,
was tacked on. What remains is
superb, but one can't help think
ing how much greater it might
have been.

That Obscure Object of Desire
Wednesday, Bishop Aud.* * + *
(1977) The long career of direc
tor Luis Bunuel began in 1928
with the surrealistic film Un
Chien Andalou. In this film he
once again reveals some of his
origins. The female main charac
ter is played by two actresses,
who are exchanged, dream-like,
from scene to scene. Obscure
Object is a story of sexual frustra
tion; that it is also very funny
shows Bunuel's sometimes per
verse, always concise satiric mas
tery. Film is in French with En
glish subtitles.

Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.
—J.M.
Midnight Express
Aquarius, Palo Alt?)
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop-out imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
kilos of hashish. The movie self
righteously bills itself as retelling
a true story; if this is so then why
did the screenwriters choose to
fabricate violent episodes — a
man having his tongue bitten off
in looming close-up, a Turkish
guard (there are no good Turks in
this movie) being impaled on a
coat hook — which never hap
pened to the real Mr. Hayes? If
you should hear Midnight Ex
press' whistle a'blowing, take the
bus instead.
—J.M.
Norma Rae * ★ * ★
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★ Yi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that |ohn Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
I wo lima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen
The Champ *
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of |on Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear th.i'
The Champ's a chump.
—J.M.
Hair * * ★ *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With |ohn Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.
—R.L.
Superman ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

The Buddy Holly Story * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.

Coming Home * ★ * *
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, -Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers from poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time, lane Fonda and Jon
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.
—R.L.
/ulia * * * *
New Varsity
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftmanship dominates
this movie about friendship and
its responsibilities, lane Fonda
and Vanessa Redgrave star in this
true story based on a chapter of
Lillian Hellman's autobiographi
cal book Pentimento. Both are
brilliant; Fonda effectively cap
tures Hellman's spirited person
ality, and Redgrave delivers a
fine, understated performance as
the idealistic Julia.
—R.L.

Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny
on the Blue Sea of August *
Tuesday, Bishop '
(1976) Director Lina Wertmul
ler is at her most strident here
with this screechy, enormously
obvious tale of a rich capitalistic
woman who is shipwrecked on a
desert island with an embittered,
socialistic sailor. Neither of the
characters is well-enough de
fined to hold our interest for the
seemingly interminable amount
of time they're on-screen. Vou
might be able to get some plea
sure from the lovely tropical
scenery, but that's scarcely
enough to make this tract on so
cial Darwinism bearable.
—J.M.
Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy withan IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.

Buck Rogers in the 25th Century
Guild, Menlo Park
This movi° is so bad that il
makes Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians look like Citizen Kane. It
features yecchv acting, wretched
dialogue, putrid sets, and abys
mal double-entendres. Buck Ro
gers was made for TV and then
distributed for theatrical use after
the producers found out how
much money Battlestar Calactica
was making in its Canadian theat
rical run. This explains the film's
rating: "M" for mindless.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind
★★ ★ ★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Steven Spielberg's wonder
fully childlike fantasy about
man's first meeting with extrater
restial beings. Spielberg is clearly
indebted to Hitchcock, but in all
the right ways, and he has the
youthful exuberance that Hitch
cock lost about four decades ago.
Spielberg is like a little boy with a
camera here, but his incredible
visual talent belies the movie's
boyish tone.
—R.L.
Isadora *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Supremely silly biopic about
Isadora Duncan. Vanessa Red
grave plays the great modern
dancer as if her main motivation
in life was being weird; the result
is about as serious as a Looney
Tune cartoon. I'd love to be able
to see the list of the film's prop
erty master where he must have
been required to find "one scarf,
long enough to be caught in the
wheel of a speeding roadster."
)ames Fox and Jason Robards are
also along for the ride. Karel
Reisz directed.
