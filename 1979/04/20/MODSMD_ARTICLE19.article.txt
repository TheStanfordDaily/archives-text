Two film*, by Orson Welles
show through Wednesday at
the Festival Cinema, Palo Alto.
At top, as he appears in Citi
zen Kane, the movie that has
had more influence on Ameri
can cinema than any other.
This was Welles' first film, and,
some say, his best.
At right, (oseph Cotten shows
off his motorcar, the device that
signaled the end of an era and the
end of the serene life of The Mag
nificent Ambersons. Ambersons,
Welles' second film, was cut by a
third by the studio, which feared
that Welles' dark view of the
American way of life might be too
much for the viewers of the time.
Even with the incongruously
happy ending, The Magnificent
Ambersons remains a stunning
exploration of an American fam
ily.
