# 13 fee assessments pass
## Freeman slate elected to COP 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
The Freeman slate captured 59.4
percent of the vote in this week's
ASSU election to defeat the rival
GRIP slate for the office of Council of
Presidents.
Sibby Freeman, Laura Mead, Tom
Gart and Mary Leßlanc garnered 1557
votes while their opponents, Liat
Applewhite, John Pomfret, Bambi
Markel and Nathan Sarkisian re
ceived 927 votes, or 40.6 percent.
According to Elections Commis
sioner Dayna Goldfine, who an
nounced the results at 2:30 a.m., the
spring elections pulled "a better
turnout than we've had" in the re
cent past. Approximately 2740 voters

passed a record 13 of 17 fee assess
ments.
Unlike last year, "even those fee
assessments not passed at least got
more (votes) than the required 20
percent" of the student body,
Goldfine said. Only the Hillel
sponsored kosher kitchen, New Di
rections, the Public Interest Re
search Group (PIRG) and the Glee
Club funding requests were refused.
Vote tallies are tentative pending
returns from overseas campus vot
ing.
None of the proposed constitu
tional amendments received the re
quisite two-thirds approval to pass.
Of the three referenda issues, only
referendum I, calling for the creation

of districted elections for graduate
and undergraduate ASSU Senators
passed by majority vote.
On the draft referenda, students
voted overwhelmingly against a
reinstitution of conscription but
greatly favored a civilian service al
ternative in the event of mandatory
registration.
The outcome of the senior class
presidents' race is contingent upon
overseas ballot returns, which
Goldfine said she hoped to start re
ceiving today.
The BASH slate, comprised of Gray
Boyce, Alan Alpert, Sandra Shanker
and Dave Hood, held a narrow 195-
181 lead over the Natural Choice
slate of Mike Kavoukjian, Connie

Ordway, Jeff Merrill and Janet Rap
paport.
The slate of Ron Johnson, Sally
Scandalios, Tim Draper and John
McColl remained in the competition
with a tally of 156 votes. Goldfine,
estimating 100 senior votes from
overseas, said that a run-off election
between the top two vote-getters will
be held if necessary.
The mascot referenda provided
another hotly contested battle. The
Griffon barely edged the Trees, 890-
874.
Both candidates for the Student
Conduct Legislative Council handily

required for election.
Contacted at their victory celebra
tion last night, Mead and Gart both
expressed feelings of exultation.
"We want to thank who
went out and voted today and yes
terday," Mead exclaimed. "We're
really excited — we're like scream
ing."
"I hope we can live up to our plat
form and more to come," Gart said.
According to Mead and Gart, that

ambition will begin to be realized
immediately. "We're going to start
working tomorrow," Mead asserted.
They said that as co-presidents
they hope to maintain contact with
the student body. "We'd like all the
people we talked to door-to-door,
come see us with ideas — we'll have
an open door," Mead urged.
"We promise everyone that this
won't be the last time they see us
door-to-door," Gart claimed.
Freeman and Leßlanc were unavaila
ble for comment.
