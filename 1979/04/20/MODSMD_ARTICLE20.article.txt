# RESTAURANTS
## One of those don't miss dining experiences 
### 
Narsai's
{85 Colusa Ave.
Kensington (North Berkeley)
527-7900
In Fall quarter I wroteabout a
restaurant called Balabosta, I
maintained that Balabosta pos
sessed characteristics that
made it unmistakably "Ber
keley." You wouldn't find it in
the Pacific Northwest, not in
San Francisco, and certainly
not on the Peninsula. It seems
to me that all the restaurants in
Berkeley have some quality
that sets them apart from any
other restaurants in the Bay
Area. Narsai's in Berkeley
seems to follow in this tradition
because of the sheer unique
ness of its character.
