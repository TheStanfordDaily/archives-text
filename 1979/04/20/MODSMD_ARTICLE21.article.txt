# NARSAI'S

### 
And yet Narsai's is unique to
Berkeley and to the Bay Area.
Its physical interior, the service
and even the cuisine exude
understated elegance. Jet set
ters, business executives, con
noisseurs of tine food and fine
wines (lock to Narsai's "melt
ing pot."
Narsai's reflects the personal

vision of its owner, Narsai
David, a culinary artist in his
own right and the grand or
chestrator of Narsai's. The
five-course menu and wine list
of unbelievable extensiveness
seem anachronistic at a time
and in a state that strive for
simplicity in restaurants and in
few calories.
For example, one of the
house specialties is a
Chateaubriand Farci
Houquetiere ($4B for two) in
the French tradition, a filet
mignon wrapped in forcemeat
roasted rare and carved at the
table, surrounded with fresh
vegetables. The rather wel
come extensive representation
of lamb rather than beet points
to Narsai's Assyrian
background.
The menu is beautiful, the
food is beautiful, the decor is
beautiful. Pretentious? Of
course, but it is absolutely one
of the greatest restaurants in
California.
Narsai is recognized nation
ally and locally as one of
California's top gourmet ex
periences. Last February, he
hosted a "Fete Gas

tronomique, an 18-course
feast purchased by East Bay re
sidents tor $2000 during last
year's KQED TV auction.
Among the dishes served that
night were Les Truites en
Celees Farcies de Mousse de
Saumon (Trout in an aspic stuf
fed with mousse of salmon);
pate de foie de faisan gelatine
au portio; and filet mignon de
Hoeuf Koyi Facon Polonaise.
Among the wines were a '$4
and a '28 Chateau Margaux and
a '67 Meusault Blaguy.
different country in the world,
usually with great success.
Here again we see Narsai the
innovator, constantly trying his
new approaches, refining his
menu.
Dinners are priced from $14
for stuffed grape leaves to $22
for Medail lons de Veau,
Robert. Frankly, these are not
outrageous prices, consider
ing not only the class of re
staurant that Narsai's is, but
also that dinners include soup,
appetizer, salad after the main
course, dessert and coffee or
tea.
Appetizers often include a
classic quiche lorraine (i.e.

bacon and leeks only, no
cheese) in an uncompromis
ingly flaky pastry or a goose
liver pate that is better than
sex. Mushroom soup with a
clam veloute, a house spe
cialty, is sublime. A green veg
etable puree which is a little
reminiscent of baby food (ex
cept in taste), was the only dis
appointment I've had at Nar
sai's.
Both courses are wonder
fully complemented by fresh
baguettes from the store next
door. Baguettes are a welcome
change from the omnipresent
San Francisco sourdough
which finds itself into even the
best French restaurants.
A favorite at Narsai's is the
Carre D'agneau, Assyrien (rack
of lamb marinated in pomeg
ranate juice, red wine, onions
and basil). This dish never dis
appoints and I recommend
that one order it medium-rare.
Pigeonneau rod aux Morilles
($22 — fresh squab roasted rare
then boned and glazed in a rich
madeira sauce with morel
mushrooms) was described as
the least popular dish on the
menu but Narsai's favorite. It is

an incredible dish.
Accompanying the main
courses are steamed string
beans with almonds and but
ter, a fine rice and wheatberry
pilaf.
Desserts are creative and
usually consist of cakes or pies
with exotic fruit. Narsai's most
famous dessert, Chocolate
Decadence, has been taken
out of circulation and one must
order it specially to have it for
dessert.
If I have been stingy with de
scription of the dishes at Nar
sai's, it is only because it would
be difficult to do them justice. I
can only urge people to make
their pilgrimage to Berkeley
and dine like a sybarite. I
should emphasize that Narsai's
is a special place and that one
would not want to eat in this
manner every week. But Narsai
has even thought of this: a short
menu (3 courses) is served
from 5-6:30 p.m. With a wine
list that some consider the best
in California, Narsai's may ap
proach what the "Under
ground Gourmet" calls "the
restaurant as art form."
