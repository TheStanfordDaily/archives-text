Gatehouse
265 Lytton Ave.

The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in bet
ween a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flow
ers, and candlelight and wine.
Not that the food isn't good —
it is, but it's the ambiance, not
the cuisine that you'll re
member.
Owner Richard McAfee
characterizes the Gatehouse as
"a place people come to celeb
rate."

"We're not a French restaur
ant, and we don't try to be," he
said. "We've stayed away from
the tuxedoes. We try for a
friendlier atmosphere with a
very good dinner offering."
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11.00) and
Stuffed Trout ($9.75). Scan
danavian Koltbords — a platter
of assorted fruits, cheeses,
meats, seafood and bread
($12.00 for two; $6.50 for one)
provide a unique dinner alter
native.
A platter of crisp, raw veget
ables starts the meal. It's
tempting to fill up on the
warm, sesame covered bread
that appears minutes after
you're seated. A selection of
California, French and German
wines are available.
A choice of soup or salad,
rice or potato, and a vegetable
are included with the entree.
Soups are a choice between
Cazpacho, creme of spinach
(tasty, but too thick), and a
chicken-mint combination.
The green salad with tomatoes
and mushrooms can be top
ped with thousand island or
deliciously zesty Italian-style
house dressing with crumbled
bleu cheese.
Among the wide range of
entree possibilities are: One
halt Long Island Duckling in
orange sauce ($9.00), Cold
Turkey Diet Plate ($5.95),
Pacific Aba I one ($12.25),
Fresh-baked Salmon Florentine
($9.50) and a vegetable plate
($7.25) for the herbivores.
The Coq au Vin ($6.75) was a
delicious variation of chicken in
burgundy wine sauce, sub
dued, but rich in flavor. The
Petit Filet Mignon (6 oz., $8.95)
was tender, but rather tasteles
s. An incredibly rich, full
bodied Bernaise sause (the
best I've ever tasted) and a

steaming baked potato full of
sour cream, chives and bacon
bits saved the entree from
mediocrity.
The cauliflower in cheese
sauce was pronounced excel
lent by my dining companion,
but I found it bland and pasty.
Dessert was the highpoint of
the meal. Cheese cake, as
sorted cakes and pastries (all
$1.60), various flavors of Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream ($1.25)
and Creme Caramel ($1.50)
easily triumph over your
calorific conscience. The
Chocolate Mousse ($1.50) is
outstanding — light and silky
sweet. The Chocolate Torte
($1.60) is exquisite — so delici
ously rich that even a small
slice satiates the most dedi
cated chocolate fiend. It is not
to be missed.
The Gatehouse also has a
huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
"It's not a body shop,''
McAfee said. "We're at the
other end ot the pole from the
British Bankers Club."
The bar specializes in a wide
range of liquers and coffee
liquer drinks such as Dutch
Coffee and Cherry Swiss (both
$1.95).
The Gatehouse is a very
civilized dining establish
ment (with prices to match.) An
evening of quiet, continental
luxury can be a welcome
change. The gracious atmos
phere and an interesting din
ing companion easily make up
for the occasionally uninspired
food.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for
lunch from 11:30 a.m. until
2:30 p.m.; and for Sunday
Brunch from 10 a.m. until 2:30
p.m. For Friday and Saturday
evenings, reservations are re
commended.
