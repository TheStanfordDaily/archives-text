One important thing to re
member about Hugo's Market,
go hungry! An extensive salad
bar including everything from
' guacamole to herring salad
starts off the meal. Soft-serve
, ice cream with a choice of cor
dials toppings ends the meal
on a sweet note.
In between, you can choose
a variety of entrees ranging
from the expected steaks, New
York (9 oz. $11.95,12 oz. $14.50)
and Filet Mignon ($14.95) to
more exotic seafood selections
such as Crabmeat Cannelloni
Florentine ($10.25), pastashells
filled with crabmeat and
spinach.

"Hi, my name is . . . and
your waitress introduces not
only herself but her partner
and the wine steward. Atten
tive, unobtrusive service con
tinues from the moment you
walk in the door through the
free after-dinner liquer. The
wine includes a good selection
of California wines complete
with small maps of the diffe
rent wine regions.
Extensive does not quite
cover the range of salad
choices included with the price
of the entree. The usual let
tuce, carrots, and celery are
followed by crumbled blue
cheese, bean and alfalfa spr
outs and a variety of vegetable
salads. Marinated artichoke
hearts and sliced tomatoes
were just two kinds offered.
After filling the chilled (and I

mean chilled) salad plate, straw
baskets can be filled with flat
sour dough bread dripping
with herb butter al la Grecque.
A little less herb in the butter
would have sufficed to my taste
but my companion disagreed.
For anyone still hungry after
the salad, a midget cone of
pineapple sherbet was served
to "refresh your taste buds be
tween salad and entree." A bit
pretentious in the first place,
the sherbet was a nice idea but
in a midget ice cream cone?
What do you do with a half
eaten cone while waiting for
your entree? A small dish
would have sufficed.
The entrees were served
with crisp buttered carrots and
crunchy snow peas, a pleasant
side dish. From the seafood
selections, the Barbecued

Giant Prawns ($13.95) were a
little bit of a disappointment.
Prepared in a New Orleans
style of garlic butter and
cayenne pepper, the giant
prawns were rather chewy. But
that is one of the problems
with giant prawns; you swap
delicate taste and texture for
size.
The New York steak with
sauteed mushrooms was a
satisfying piece of beef, well
cooked and served. A steak is a
steak is a steak but this was a
little better than most.
Indonesian Lamb Roast
($14.95), a rack of lamb roasted
and glazed with a honey and
peanut butter sauce, might be
an interesting entree choice.
Chicken Sicilian ($9.95), chic
ken cooked with garlic, shal
lots and diced potatoes would
also provide an alternative
dinner selection.
Soft-serve ice cream, choco
late and vanilla, is always a big
hit especially topped with cor
dial. The only problem
with sundaes is that they
start off looking great but end
up as soup through no fault of
the management.
Hugo's Market, opened two
years ago, is part of the Hyatt
chain of hotels. According to
Assistant Manager Janet Hill,
the clientele of the restaurant
is drawn from the community
as well as hotel guests. One
look at the price range, how
ever, and you know that
Hugo's Market caters to the
expense account crowd.
It is a nice place for a quiet
dinner for two. It is the kind of
restaurant where people talk in
hushed tones and loud laugh
ter causes a flurry of turning
heads. Conservative decor and
attentive service mark Hugo s
Market.
