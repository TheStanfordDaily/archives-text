# Latest luncheon chic in the city

Today's
216 Stockton at Union Square

The business cards read 'Pure Food/Pure
Chic', and at Today's, one of San Francisco's
newest restaurants, the printed word doesn't
lie. Capitalizing on the current interest in
lunch places that feature simple, healthy
food, Today's is already known as A Place To
Co. Here, fresh seafood, the season's best
produce, light dressings, and Cherry Perry —
the house drink made with Perrier water and
cherry cider — are served with sophisticated
and uncomplicated elan.
Salads are large and magazine-perfect; the
Salad Nicoise ($6.25), its crisp vegetables —
green beans, potatoes, romaine, tomatoes,
hardboiled egg, and fresh tuna (it tastes diffe
rent than Starkist!), spiked with a tangy vin
aigrette, and the Nine Vegetable Salad (a/
dente), ($4.25), covered with a mild yogurt
dressing, are both flawless. Top choice,
however, is the Cobb Salad ($5.95), a hearty
combination of chicken, thick, raw mus
hroom slices, tomatoes, grated egg, and bleu
cheese. For dessert, there's an apple
poached in wine and topped with a delicately
sweet cream sauce ($1.50), Crushed Almond
Torte ($1.50), and a choice of fresh fruit.
But as the catch phrase suggests, Today's

offers more than good, plain, healthy food.
From kitchen to table there is a calculated
emphasis on keeping things simple and ef
fortlessly chic. A sense of participating in
"what's vogue" is central to the dining ex
perience here. Design, color, and pre
paration bespeak an easy elegance. The
single room, paneled with mirrors, reflects
the softest shades of pink and beige, and all
the waiters, each one very thin and very pret
ty,are dressed in peach. Silverware, napkins,
plates and wine glasses are disposable; even
the menu, with boxes you check your
self,eventually gets thrown out. There is only
one hot dish on the menu, a homemade veg
etable soup; the other entrees are quickly
assembled from a colorful and exoticly
stocked salad bar. To some, the setting and
the cast of characters might seem a little too
perfect, a little too chic. Though the service
was neither condescending nor obsequious,
we couldn't help but feel slightly uncomfort
able every time a waiter walked by, worried
that maybe we weren't holding our forks cor
rectly or talking about the 'right thing'. Sur
rounded by society's 'latest', it is easy to feel
like you're on display. There are games being
played here, but the rules are easy to discern
and sometimes, it's kind of fun to play along.
Besides, at Today's, good, fresh, fast food
is still the main idea.
