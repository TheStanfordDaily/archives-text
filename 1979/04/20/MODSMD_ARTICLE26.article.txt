# Women win tune up for USC
## 
### Steve Pearson 
Awaiting a chance for re
venge against USC's top
ranked team this weekend,
Stanford's women's tennis
team defeated visiting league
rival California Tuesday 7-2.
The Stanford victory in its
final league match of the year
left its league record at an un
blemished 6-0, and upped its
season record to 10-2.
This victory exactly matched
the Cards' earlier 7-2 win over
the Golden Bears at Cal. Stan
ford lost two singles contests
to account for Cal's two-point
total.
Playing No. 1, Alycia Moul
ton had no problems with Cal's
Beth Fernbacher, easily win
ning 6-2, 6-1. Susie Hagey,
however, in the No. 2 position,
was hampered by a strained

ankle and an erratic forehand,
losing to Cal's Eve Herrera 6-2,
6-4.
The only other Card loss of
the day was in the third singles
match where Stanford's Donna
Rubin was overcome by Cal's
scrambling Toni Reed. In a
tense three-set match Reed re
turned too many of her strong
groundstrokes to Rubin and
took a 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 victory.
In other matches Stanford
players were sometimes
stretched to three sets, but
managed to yield no more
points to the Cal team.
This Saturday afternoon at 1
p.m. Southern California pow
erhouse USC, led by Ail-
American Stacy Margolin, tests
its No. 1 national ranking on
the Stanford tennis courts.
On April 7 of this year Stan
ford was defeated 6-3 by the

Trojans in Los Angeles. But the
homecourt advantage is an im
portant factor in a tennis rivalry
such as Stanford-USC, and
anything can happen.
As Cardinal women's coach
Anne Could said, "USC has put
together one of the top college
teams of the past few years.
They're tough anywhere. But
so are we. All I can say is that
it's going to be a great match."
Highlighting the many close
match-ups between the two
teams will be the confrontation
between the top two women
players in college tennis:
USC's Stacy Margolin and Stan
ford's Kathy Jordan.
In their match in Los
Angeles, Margolin was a 4-6,
6-3, 6-4 victor in a well-played
and hard-fought match. Mar
golin boasts a world ranking of

19 in women's tennis while
Jordan stands not far behind at
22.
One deficit the Cards may
have to face against USC is the
possible loss of All-American
Diane Morrison who is doubt
ful due to an aggravated shoul
der injury.
"If we lose Diane it will defi
nitely hurt us," Gould said.
"But we'll just have to do the
very best we can no matter
what happens."

Awaiting a chance for re
venge against USC's top
ranked team this weekend,
Stanford's women's tennis
team defeated visiting league
rival California Tuesday 7-2.
The Stanford victory in its
final league match of the year
left its league record at an un
blemished 6-0, and upped its
season record to 10-2.
This victory exactly matched
the Cards' earlier 7-2 win over
the Golden Bears at Cal. Stan
ford lost two singles contests
to account for Cal's two-point
total.
Playing No. 1, Alycia Moul
ton had no problems with Cal's
Beth Fernbacher, easily win
ning 6-2, 6-1. Susie Hagey,
however, in the No. 2 position,
was hampered by a strained

ankle and an erratic forehand,
losing to Cal's Eve Herrera 6-2,
6-4.
The only other Card loss of
the day was in the third singles
match where Stanford's Donna
Rubin was overcome by Cal's
scrambling Toni Reed. In a
tense three-set match Reed re
turned too many of her strong
groundstrokes to Rubin and
took a 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 victory.
In other matches Stanford
players were sometimes
stretched to three sets, but
managed to yield no more
points to the Cal team.
This Saturday afternoon at 1
p.m. Southern California pow
erhouse USC, led by Ail-
American Stacy Margolin, tests
its No. 1 national ranking on
the Stanford tennis courts.
On April 7 of this year Stan
ford was defeated 6-3 by the

Trojans in Los Angeles. But the
homecourt advantage is an im
portant factor in a tennis rivalry
such as Stanford-USC, and
anything can happen.
As Cardinal women's coach
Anne Could said, "USC has put
together one of the top college
teams of the past few years.
They're tough anywhere. But
so are we. All I can say is that
it's going to be a great match."
Highlighting the many close
match-ups between the two
teams will be the confrontation
between the top two women
players in college tennis:
USC's Stacy Margolin and Stan
ford's Kathy Jordan.
In their match in Los
Angeles, Margolin was a 4-6,
6-3, 6-4 victor in a well-played
and hard-fought match. Mar
golin boasts a world ranking of

19 in women's tennis while
Jordan stands not far behind at
22.
One deficit the Cards may
have to face against USC is the
possible loss of All-American
Diane Morrison who is doubt
ful due to an aggravated shoul
der injury.
"If we lose Diane it will defi
nitely hurt us," Gould said.
"But we'll just have to do the
very best we can no matter
what happens."
