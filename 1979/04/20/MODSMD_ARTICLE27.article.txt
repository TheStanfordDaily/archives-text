# Nine splits non-league contests
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Stanford's baseball team met
two non-conference oppo
nents early this week in prep
aration for yet another tough
league series at home this
weekend.
Tuesday the Cardinals
traveled to Santa Clara and re
turned with a disappointing 3-2
loss to the Broncos in which
they collected only four hits.
A 5-3 victory over the Univer
sity of the Pacific on Wednes
day improved their season
win-loss record to 26-16.
An unearned run in the

eighth inningof Tuesday'scon
test gave Santa Clara the win
ning edge over Stanford. With
two outs and one man on base,
Stanford reliever Brian Mig
nano gave up two consecutive
singles to Bronco batsmen ac
counting for the deciding run.
A two-run homer in the fifth
inning by third baseman Phil
Wilson was Stanford's offen
sive effort for the day.
In Stockton against UOP, the
Cards fared better at the plate
as they totaled five runs on 14
hits. A home run by catcher
Bruce Walters, a three-hit per

formance by outfielder Larry
Reynolds and a couple of big
hits by first baseman John Pyle
highlighted the Stanford of
fense.
Senior pitcher )erry Batten
berg worked five innings in re
lief, and recorded his first win
of the season.
"The pitchers did a good job
(against UOP)," said Card
coach Mark Marquess, "espe
cially Battenberg. I was happy
to see us hit the ball a little bit
better (than against Santa
Clara)."

The team now faces a strong
Pacific-10 Conference oppo
nent in the form of the Univer
sity of Arizona today at 2:30
p.m. and on Saturday and Sun
day afternoons. The Wildcats
are currently tied with Califor
nia in second place of the
Southern Division with 10-8
league records.
According to Marquess,
Arizona is playing exception
ally well lately. In their last
series, the Wildcats won three
of four games against USC.
"They are going to be tough
to beat," said Marquess. "But if
we are going to have any
chance at all at finishing the
season in second place, we are
going to have to win two out of
three games every weekend
from now on."
Success for Stanford this
weekend will depend on good
pitching performances.
Arizona brings big bats to town
in the form of designated hitter
Wes Clements, infielder Brad
Mills and Clark Crist.
Clements packs a healthy
.306 average and has clubbed
eight home runs thus far in
Pac-10 play. Mills and Crist lead
the club with .365 and .366 bat
ting averages.
Today Stanford standout )oe
LoPresti (6-4, 4.11 era) will take
to the mound against Wildcat
Craig Lefterts (6-1, 3.18 era).
Saturday Bruce Fiala will be
looking for his 25th career vic
tory that will make him the
winningest pitcher in Stanford
baseball history. Fiala will duel
with Arizona's freshman sensa
tion Ron Sismondo.
Sunday Stanford's Brian Har
rison is slated to go against Jeff
Morris.
Both Saturday's and Sun
day's games will be single con
tests starting at 1 p.m.

sity of the Pacific on Wednes
day improved their season
win-loss record to 26-16.
An unearned run in the

eighth inningof Tuesday'scon
test gave Santa Clara the win
ning edge over Stanford. With
two outs and one man on base,
Stanford reliever Brian Mig
nano gave up two consecutive
singles to Bronco batsmen ac
counting for the deciding run.
A two-run homer in the fifth
inning by third baseman Phil
Wilson was Stanford's offen
sive effort for the day.
In Stockton against UOP, the
Cards fared better at the plate
as they totaled five runs on 14
hits. A home run by catcher
Bruce Walters, a three-hit per

formance by outfielder Larry
Reynolds and a couple of big
hits by first baseman John Pyle
highlighted the Stanford of
fense.
Senior pitcher )erry Batten
berg worked five innings in re
lief, and recorded his first win
of the season.
"The pitchers did a good job
(against UOP)," said Card
coach Mark Marquess, "espe
cially Battenberg. I was happy
to see us hit the ball a little bit
better (than against Santa
Clara)."

The team now faces a strong
Pacific-10 Conference oppo
nent in the form of the Univer
sity of Arizona today at 2:30
p.m. and on Saturday and Sun
day afternoons. The Wildcats
are currently tied with Califor
nia in second place of the
Southern Division with 10-8
league records.
According to Marquess,
Arizona is playing exception
ally well lately. In their last
series, the Wildcats won three
of four games against USC.
"They are going to be tough
to beat," said Marquess. "But if
we are going to have any
chance at all at finishing the
season in second place, we are
going to have to win two out of
three games every weekend
from now on."
Success for Stanford this
weekend will depend on good
pitching performances.
Arizona brings big bats to town
in the form of designated hitter
Wes Clements, infielder Brad
Mills and Clark Crist.
Clements packs a healthy
.306 average and has clubbed
eight home runs thus far in
Pac-10 play. Mills and Crist lead
the club with .365 and .366 bat
ting averages.
