## Netters down San Jose St. in preparation for California 
### Jeff Brandon 
The Stanford men's tennis
team tuned up tor its big match
with Cal tomorrow by downing
San Jose State 6-3 yesterday at
Stanford Stadium.
The Cardinals were minus
No. 4 man Scott Bondurant,
who sat out the singles with a
sore shoulder. This made room
for another freshman, John
Corse, to see rare action.
Corse, rusty from his lack of
competitive play, dropped his
match at No. 6 6-4, 6-3, to
George Mulhern.
Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne, who did not win a set
in singles or doubles in Los
Angeles, reversed that and
didn't lose a set against the
Spartans. Rennert lost the first
four games of the match before
he got in gear. However, once
on the right track he lost only
one more in defeating grunting
All-American Nial Brash. Brash
was hot off an upset win over
UCLA's top player, Fritz Buehn
ing.
Bourne also turned things
around on Paul Batten, who
handed Bourne a loss earlier
this fall in the teams' first meet
ing. Bourne used his high
powered two-handed bac
khand well in the big points
and squeaked out a 7-5, 7-6
win.
Bourne and Rennert then
paired up for a straight set
doubles win over Brash and
Batten.
"I was pleased at our play
overall today, especially at the
top of the lineup," said Card
coach Dick Gould. "Bourne
and Rennert are really starting
to play better as a doubles
team. I was also happy to see
Jeff Arons come back so well in
his match."
Arons, playing No. 4, drop
ped the first set of his match
with Don Paulsen 6-3. How
ever, after that he experienced
relatively few problems win
ning the last two sets 6-0, 6-3.
The Cards' win, however,
might have been a costly one.

Three year letterman Jim
Hodges was forced to default
after pulling a hamstring mus
cle and was unable to continue
after the first set. Hodges is
listed as doubtful for Saturday.
"You don't lose a three year
starter and not feel the ef
fects," said Gould. "Not only
does it change our singles
lineup, but it also alters our
doubles picture. I'll just have
to see how things go."
The Cards, 4-1 in Pac-lOplay,
travel to Cal tomorrow for the
second match with the Golden
Bears.
"We're going to have our
hands lull in Berkeley," said
Gould. "Last time we played
them we were ahead 5-1 after
the singles, but it just as well

could have been 1-5.
"They played UCLA a lot
closer than we did, too. They
won three of the top four sing
les matches whereas we didn't
win any of those. Plus, they've
got the security of playing at
home. But we're making prog
ress, we've improved a lot
since we last played them. I
look tor a good, close, exciting
match."

starter and not feel the ef
fects," said Gould. "Not only
does it change our singles
lineup, but it also alters our
doubles picture. I'll just have
to see how things go."
The Cards, 4-1 in Pac-lOplay,
travel to Cal tomorrow for the
second match with the Golden
Bears.
"We're going to have our
hands lull in Berkeley," said
Gould. "Last time we played
them we were ahead 5-1 after
the singles, but it just as well

could have been 1-5.
"They played UCLA a lot
closer than we did, too. They
won three of the top four sing
les matches whereas we didn't
win any of those. Plus, they've
got the security of playing at
home. But we're making prog
ress, we've improved a lot
since we last played them. I
look tor a good, close, exciting
match."

The Stanford men's tennis
team tuned up tor its big match
with Cal tomorrow by downing
San Jose State 6-3 yesterday at
Stanford Stadium.
The Cardinals were minus
No. 4 man Scott Bondurant,
who sat out the singles with a
sore shoulder. This made room
for another freshman, John
Corse, to see rare action.
Corse, rusty from his lack of
competitive play, dropped his
match at No. 6 6-4, 6-3, to
George Mulhern.
Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne, who did not win a set
in singles or doubles in Los
Angeles, reversed that and
didn't lose a set against the
Spartans. Rennert lost the first
four games of the match before
he got in gear. However, once
on the right track he lost only
one more in defeating grunting
All-American Nial Brash. Brash
was hot off an upset win over
UCLA's top player, Fritz Buehn
ing.
Bourne also turned things
around on Paul Batten, who
handed Bourne a loss earlier
this fall in the teams' first meet
ing. Bourne used his high
powered two-handed bac
khand well in the big points
and squeaked out a 7-5, 7-6
win.
Bourne and Rennert then
paired up for a straight set
doubles win over Brash and
Batten.
"I was pleased at our play
overall today, especially at the
top of the lineup," said Card
coach Dick Gould. "Bourne
and Rennert are really starting
to play better as a doubles
team. I was also happy to see
Jeff Arons come back so well in
his match."
Arons, playing No. 4, drop
ped the first set of his match
with Don Paulsen 6-3. How
ever, after that he experienced
relatively few problems win
ning the last two sets 6-0, 6-3.
The Cards' win, however,
might have been a costly one.

Three year letterman Jim
Hodges was forced to default
after pulling a hamstring mus
cle and was unable to continue
after the first set. Hodges is
listed as doubtful for Saturday.
"You don't lose a three year
starter and not feel the ef
fects," said Gould. "Not only
does it change our singles
lineup, but it also alters our
doubles picture. I'll just have
to see how things go."
The Cards, 4-1 in Pac-lOplay,
travel to Cal tomorrow for the
second match with the Golden
Bears.
"We're going to have our
