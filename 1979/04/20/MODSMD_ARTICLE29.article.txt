Tom Hall, the linebacker who was injured in a
motorcycle-automobile collision Wednesday, underwent
ankle surgery to repair two severed tendons and a torn
ligament at Stanford Hospital Wednesday night.
"I anticipate Tom's participation in autumn practice,"
said Standley Scott, football trainer. "But I say that with a lot
of hope."
Hall said he will be released from the hospital in three
days, but that his doctors want to keep him under observa
tion to insure that no infection sets into his ankle. He
expects a three to four month recuperation period.
Hall's ankle has been set in a cast, and according to Scott,
he will remain in a cast for six to eight weeks.
"I wish there was more I could say," Scott said. "But it's a
rare injury, and it wouldn't be fair to Tom or his doctors to
try to make recovery predictions."
Hall will be working with the Stanford football trainers
this summer, Scott said. He will he exercising individual
muscles under their direction.
Hall said he felt "average" yesterday afternoon, and said
"the golf cart is the best part of this whole thing."
"I have no hard feelings," Hall said when asked about his
mental disposition. "It's just one of those things."
