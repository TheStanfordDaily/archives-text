The Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) hasn't passed "because
people in power who control
power don't want to give it up,"
said Bella Abzug, former co-chair
of the National Advisory Commit
tee for Women, during a speech
here last night.
Abzug, who served in Congress
from 1971 to 1977, told an audi
ence of more than 140 in Cubber
ley Auditorium that minorities
and women are "on the fringes of
democracy.
"The members of Congress are
listening to the monopolists (and
not the people) because you are
not saying anything," she
explained.
She urged women to become
involved in the political process,
stating, "We have the numbers.
We are a majority. We have to use
that majority." She expressed
faith in women's governing ability
and said, "There isn't a woman in
this room who couldn't find a bet
ter way" to spend the money in
the U.S. budget.
Abzug pointed to apathy pre :

sent on many college campuses,
saying, "I travel to many cam
puses and I find the 'don't make
waves' movement is true."
Voter apathy rapped
A 1977 candidate for mayor of
New York City, Abzug noted that
in 1976 "less than one-third of the
eligible voters (in the 18 to 21 age
bracket) voted." She criticized
this voter apathy, saying that
when we have "this withdrawal of
the sovereign power" of the
people who influence govern
ment, "serious things happen. A
'Nixon' happens. Vietnam hap
pens. International blackmail
happens."
Abzug urged students to be
come involved in political move
ments and organizations, saying,
"You're not living on any kind of
island. Meaningful goals are only
going to be achieved by move
ments by people from the grass
roots up."
Asserting that she has been an
activist most of her life, Abzug
spoke extensively on women's
rights.
She noted that although "we

were here from the beginning, we
just got the vote, and we haven't
done a hell of a lot about it, but
we're going to."
Abzug, who said she was re
jected from Harvard Law School
on the basis of her sex, asserted
that society uses a "psychology of
oppression" on women and
minorities making them feel
guilty. As an example, Abzug said,
"If a woman is beautiful, she's a
temptress. If she's plain, she's a
dog."
Abzug said that the National
Women's Conference held in
Houston in November 1977 was
"the most representative confer
ence that ever took place in the
history of our country."
Advisory committee
Appointed as co-chair of the
National Advisory Committee for
Women by President Jimmy Car
ter in June 1978, Abzug said that
the committee was "very effec
tive," though Americans may
"never have heard of it if I hadn't
been fired."
Abzug also said that while
committee members "were ex

tremely pleased" with Carter's
support of the ERA, they were
"terribly concerned" with his
economic policy.
The president proposed an au
sterity program that cut "12 to 15
important programs," including
programs which affect women,
Abzug said.
Dismissal explained
Dismissed from the committee
by Carter in January, Abzug told
reporters after the speech that she
didn't come to the University to
criticize Carter but "to organize
people."


Bella Abzug
Abzug explained her dismissal
from the committee by claiming
that "They (the Carter administra
tion) had a feeling they needed to
show some toughness." She
maintained that "everyone —
labor, business and women —
were criticizing the budget." As a
result, the administration decided
"to get tough" against the criti
cism and to lash out against those
'with the least power — the wo
men."
The renowned feminist as
serted that "the women in this

country have enormous respon
sibility," and said that "the wo
men's movement has reached the
hearts and heads of this country's
people."
Possible senate run
Abzug said she was "unde
cided" on whether she would run
for the U.S. Senate in 1980 but
added that she would probably
run for public office in the future
because she regards it as a "viable
option."
According to Abzug, "women's
groups are disenchanted with
President Carter. The president
will have to show a great deal of
attention to specifics (in women's
issues) in the next months."

the committee was "very effec
tive," though Americans may
"never have heard of it if I hadn't
been fired."
Abzug also said that while
committee members "were ex

tremely pleased" with Carter's
support of the ERA, they were
"terribly concerned" with his
economic policy.
The president proposed an au
sterity program that cut "12 to 15
important programs," including
programs which affect women,
Abzug said.
Dismissal explained
Dismissed from the committee
by Carter in January, Abzug told
reporters after the speech that she
didn't come to the University to
criticize Carter but "to organize
people."


Bella Abzug
Abzug explained her dismissal
from the committee by claiming
that "They (the Carter administra
tion) had a feeling they needed to
show some toughness." She
maintained that "everyone —
labor, business and women —
were criticizing the budget." As a
result, the administration decided
"to get tough" against the criti
cism and to lash out against those
'with the least power — the wo
men."
The renowned feminist as
serted that "the women in this

country have enormous respon
sibility," and said that "the wo
men's movement has reached the
hearts and heads of this country's
people."
Possible senate run
Abzug said she was "unde
cided" on whether she would run
for the U.S. Senate in 1980 but
added that she would probably
run for public office in the future
because she regards it as a "viable
option."
According to Abzug, "women's
groups are disenchanted with
President Carter. The president
will have to show a great deal of
attention to specifics (in women's
issues) in the next months."
The Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) hasn't passed "because
people in power who control
power don't want to give it up,"
said Bella Abzug, former co-chair
of the National Advisory Commit
tee for Women, during a speech
here last night.
Abzug, who served in Congress
from 1971 to 1977, told an audi
ence of more than 140 in Cubber
ley Auditorium that minorities
and women are "on the fringes of
democracy.
"The members of Congress are
listening to the monopolists (and
not the people) because you are
not saying anything," she
explained.
She urged women to become
involved in the political process,
stating, "We have the numbers.
We are a majority. We have to use
that majority." She expressed
faith in women's governing ability
and said, "There isn't a woman in
this room who couldn't find a bet
ter way" to spend the money in
the U.S. budget.
Abzug pointed to apathy pre :

sent on many college campuses,
saying, "I travel to many cam
puses and I find the 'don't make
waves' movement is true."
Voter apathy rapped
A 1977 candidate for mayor of
New York City, Abzug noted that
in 1976 "less than one-third of the
eligible voters (in the 18 to 21 age
bracket) voted." She criticized
this voter apathy, saying that
when we have "this withdrawal of
the sovereign power" of the
people who influence govern
ment, "serious things happen. A
'Nixon' happens. Vietnam hap
pens. International blackmail
happens."
Abzug urged students to be
come involved in political move
ments and organizations, saying,
"You're not living on any kind of
island. Meaningful goals are only
going to be achieved by move
ments by people from the grass
roots up."
Asserting that she has been an
activist most of her life, Abzug
spoke extensively on women's
rights.
She noted that although "we

were here from the beginning, we
just got the vote, and we haven't
done a hell of a lot about it, but
we're going to."
Abzug, who said she was re
jected from Harvard Law School
on the basis of her sex, asserted
that society uses a "psychology of
oppression" on women and
minorities making them feel
guilty. As an example, Abzug said,
"If a woman is beautiful, she's a
temptress. If she's plain, she's a
dog."
Abzug said that the National
Women's Conference held in
Houston in November 1977 was
"the most representative confer
ence that ever took place in the
history of our country."
Advisory committee
Appointed as co-chair of the
National Advisory Committee for
Women by President Jimmy Car
ter in June 1978, Abzug said that
the committee was "very effec
tive," though Americans may
"never have heard of it if I hadn't
been fired."
Abzug also said that while
committee members "were ex

tremely pleased" with Carter's
support of the ERA, they were
