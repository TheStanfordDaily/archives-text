# Mitch Thomas: a day on the green
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
■ A golf course is a masochist's
playground. Golf demands
that a player compete against
lis opponent, himself, the
■ements and the course, all at
tiie same time. A wag once
laid: "Have you ever noticed
If hat golf spells backwards?"
I To overcome this inherent
lelf-abuse a player must have
fromplete muscle control, a
prehensile mind and steel
pelted nerves, the kind that
fellow him to yawn at his own
Ivedding or to sit calmly while
being tried by an Iranian tri
bunal.
As I have none of these qual
ities, I don't golf. But yesterday
t| hiked the verdant knolls and
[carpeted fairways of the Stan
ford Golf Course in dogged
pursuit of a high school buddy,
Mitch "Spanky" Thomas, the
No. 2 golfer for Arizona. He
was competing in the opening
round of the 12th Stanford U.S.
Intercollegiate Invitational
Golf Tournament.
Mitch won the Northern
California Public Links Champ
ionship and the Fort Ord Invi

tational last summer, but yes
terday the course belonged to
San Diego State's Lenny Cle
ments and the UCLA Bruins.
Clements carded a 3-under
68, the only player to break par
on the 6835-yard course. He
fired an eagle on the opening
hole, stumbled with a
double-bogey on No. 9, then
crafted a 33 on the back nine
and grabbed a 3-stroke lead.
Three golfers closed the
round at par: Dave Nelson,
Nevada-Reno; Lynn Stone, Ful
lerton State and Dennis Gedes
tad, UC-Davis.
UCLA's Mickey Vokoi and
Tom Randolph each shot 72
and led the Bruins to a team
leading 291. Bruin Chuck
White, last year's tournament
medalist, finished at 73. On the
heels of the Los Angelenos are
Cal State-North ridge, 297;
Fresno State, 298, and
Nevada-Reno, 300.
Stanford was tied forseventh
at 303. Junior Steve Schroeder
led the Cards with a 73, putting
him in the 10-man logjam for
eighth.
While Clements had no

problems, the opening-round
scores were bloated for the
most part. "The course won
today," said Stanford coach
Bruce Summerhays.
The course humbled Mitch
yesterday as he wrestled to a
78. At day's end he must have
yearned for the course on
which he learned to play, a
course one mile from the San
Andreas Fault and just south of
Tres Pinos, a hamlet of 350
whose name has been
Anglicized such that I can't
pronounce it without grinning
sheepishly.
Mitch grew up 70 miles south
of Stanford in Hollister, a rural
community which served as
the model for the town over
run by motorcyclists in The
Wild One. We like Hollister,
but it has its faults — the San
Andreas, Calaveras and Hay
ward — and is tagged the "Ear
thquake Capital of the World."
Mitch blossomed as a golfer
after our high school basket
ball coach discouraged him
from coming out again our
junior year — Mitch was
5-foot-3 at the time. High

school was also when we
cemented our friendship with
a combination of hops, malt
and barley. Ours is the friend
ship to which corpulent Ger
mans raise pewter mugs in
dimly lit Bavarian taverns.
Yesterday, however, there
was not much to toast. As with
Clements, the first hole pre
viewed the remaining 17. Put
ting for a birdie on the par-5
hole, Mitch left the ball an inch
from the cup. He never got that
bird all day.
Oh, he had chances. His tee
shot on the par-3, No. 3 hit the
hill to the left of the green,
bounced right at the pin and
rolled to within six feet of the
cup. He two-putted.
Mitch was born in Galion,
Ohio, and like another blond
from Ohio, he is long off the
tee. Mitch was the only
member of his threesome to
reach the green of the Par-5,
No. 7 in two strokes. But he
three-putted and begrudgingly
accepted par.
So went the round. He drove
well, but hit inconsistent ap
proach shots and found his

putter terribly anemic.
Colters bless their equip
ment with all sorts of animate
qualities. They are always talk
ing to their balls. "Get left!"
"Sit!" "Bite!"
And when things are going
bad, as they often will, they talk
to their putters. While the
Arizona coach spoke to Mitch
after No. 14, Mr. Thomas
talked to Mitch's putter.
"Gotta warm this thing up," he
explained. His pep talk fell on
deaf ears.
On 17, it appeared that he
was finally going to get his bird,
but his ball went up to the lip of
the cup, looked down, de
cided it didn't like what it saw
and rolled back toward Mitch.
Golf has an idiom of its own.
When asked what he has
shot, a player who knows the
lingo of the links is likely to
answer: "Union Oil (76),"
"Piano keys (77)" or "Snow
man (80)."
But one need not know the
language of the fairways to un
derstand Mitch's evaluation of
his first round: "It was a strug
gle."

ARIZONA'S MITCH Thomas frowns while watching his drive on No.
17 at the Stanford Golf Course yesterday during the first round of the
Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate Invitational Golf Tournament. Anemic
putting skyrocketed Thomas' score to a 7-over par 78. San Diego
State's Lenny Clements fashioned a 3-under 68 to grab a 3-stroke
lead. The tournament continues today and tomorrow.
