# A.P. SUMMARY
## 
### 
Nation's economic growth slows
Washington — Declines in consumer purchases and
home and factory construction helped slow the nation's
economic growth from January through March to its
lowest level in a year, the government reported yester
day.
Economic growth in the first quarter of 1979 was at an
annual rate of 0.7 percent, the Commerce Department
• said. That compares with a booming 6.9 percent annual
rate in the final three months of 1978.
It was the lowest single-quarter growth rate since the
0.1 percent decline reported tor the first quarter a year
ago.
The slower growth rate more than confirms govern
ment predictions that the economy is slowing from the
breakneck pace of late 1978.
In related developments:
— The Commerce Department said in its first-quarter
report that inflation increased at an 8.7 percent annual
rate, up from 8.2 percent in the last three months of
1978. But Secretary of Commerce Juanita Kreps said that
"there is good reason to believe that the worst may be
behind us, particularly in food."
— Disposable personal income rose $7.8 billion in the
first quarter to $991 billion on an annual basis, the de
partment said. The figure, which is adjusted for infla
tion, was 4 percent ahead of the first quarter of 1978.
Key SALT issue settled
Washington — The United States and the Soviet Union
have settled perhaps the key remaining issue in the
strategic arms negotiations, but still are not ready to sign
a treaty, administration sources said yesterday.
The U.S. sources, asking not to be identified, said
agreement had been reached on the rules for defining a
new missile type during the duration of the SALT II pact.
The definition of new missile types has been a major
unresolved issue.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin met for an hour yesterday evening.
Afterwards, State Department spokesman Tom Reston
said they had agreed to talk again this afternoon.
Mindful of unanticipated issues that have arisen in the
past to confound the negotiators, officials refused to
predict when the talks might end.
State Department spokesman Hodding Carter said
"real problems" remained to be resolved by Vance and
Dobrynin before the two sides discussed a summit meet
ing.
Deng attacks U.S.-Taiwan ties
Peking — Deputy Premier Deng Xiaoping (Teng
Hsiao-ping) "came down very hard" on U.S. relations
with laiwan during an interview with a Senate Foreign
Relations Committee delegation yesterday.

Deng said the United States-Taiwan bill undermines
the political basis for normalized relations, Committee
Chairman Frank Church reported after a two-hour meet
ing with Deng.
"He came down very hard on us ... He said the
inference of the U.S. act was to negate the political basis
of normalization . . . and the thrust of the act was sup
port of Taiwan and inconsistent w'th the idea of one
China," Church said.
Part of the agreement for last January's normalization
of relations between China and the United States was an
official end to U.S. relations with the Republic of China
on Taiwan. President Jimmy Carter signed legislation
April 10 setting up an institute to provide a cultural and
trade liaison with Taiwan. It included security language,
opposed by China, assuring U.S. help if China should
attack the island.
Bomb mars Egyptian peace vote
Cairo, Egypt — A parcel bomb killed one Cairo postal
worker and injured four others in a relatively rare act of
violence that marred yesterday's referendum on the
peace treaty with Israel.
Police officials said the parcel, the size of a cigar box,
exploded in the face of a woman postal inspector who
was checking the contents. Four other postal workers
were injured in the midday incident at the central post
office as voters elsewhere in the city streamed to voting
booths to express their confidence in the peace treaty.
President Anwar Sadat predicted a 99 percent yes
vote.
Senior post office officials said bomb detection
equipment was to be brought in to examine an esti
mated 2000 parcels in the room, which has been sealed
by police.
The bomb was in one of 70 packages with similar
markings, a police spokesman said, but officials did not
say when the parcel bomb was mailed or to whom it was
addressed.
Dow Jones sinks 5.02
New York — The stock market fell back for the fifth
time in six sessions yesterday, unable to sustain a small
early rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues sank
5.02, to 855.25. Most of the loss came in the final hour,
after the Dow average had dissipated a small lead at
noontime.
Big Board volume, which all week has hovered around
the 30million-share mark, closed at 31.15 million shares.
Today's weather
Fair and warmer through tomorrow. Lows tonight mid
40s to low 50s. Highs today in the 60s to low 70s and
tomorrow mid 60s to mid 70s. Westerly winds to 20 mph
afternoons.

Hsiao-ping) "came down very hard" on U.S. relations
with laiwan during an interview with a Senate Foreign
Relations Committee delegation yesterday.

Deng said the United States-Taiwan bill undermines
the political basis for normalized relations, Committee
Chairman Frank Church reported after a two-hour meet
ing with Deng.
"He came down very hard on us ... He said the
inference of the U.S. act was to negate the political basis
of normalization . . . and the thrust of the act was sup
port of Taiwan and inconsistent w'th the idea of one
China," Church said.
Part of the agreement for last January's normalization
of relations between China and the United States was an
official end to U.S. relations with the Republic of China
on Taiwan. President Jimmy Carter signed legislation
April 10 setting up an institute to provide a cultural and
trade liaison with Taiwan. It included security language,
opposed by China, assuring U.S. help if China should
attack the island.
Bomb mars Egyptian peace vote
Cairo, Egypt — A parcel bomb killed one Cairo postal
worker and injured four others in a relatively rare act of
violence that marred yesterday's referendum on the
peace treaty with Israel.
Police officials said the parcel, the size of a cigar box,
exploded in the face of a woman postal inspector who
was checking the contents. Four other postal workers
were injured in the midday incident at the central post
office as voters elsewhere in the city streamed to voting
booths to express their confidence in the peace treaty.
President Anwar Sadat predicted a 99 percent yes
vote.
Senior post office officials said bomb detection
equipment was to be brought in to examine an esti
mated 2000 parcels in the room, which has been sealed
by police.
The bomb was in one of 70 packages with similar
markings, a police spokesman said, but officials did not
say when the parcel bomb was mailed or to whom it was
addressed.
Dow Jones sinks 5.02
New York — The stock market fell back for the fifth
time in six sessions yesterday, unable to sustain a small
early rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues sank
5.02, to 855.25. Most of the loss came in the final hour,
after the Dow average had dissipated a small lead at
noontime.
Big Board volume, which all week has hovered around
the 30million-share mark, closed at 31.15 million shares.
Today's weather
Fair and warmer through tomorrow. Lows tonight mid
40s to low 50s. Highs today in the 60s to low 70s and
tomorrow mid 60s to mid 70s. Westerly winds to 20 mph
afternoons.
Nation's economic growth slows
Washington — Declines in consumer purchases and
home and factory construction helped slow the nation's
economic growth from January through March to its
lowest level in a year, the government reported yester
day.
Economic growth in the first quarter of 1979 was at an
annual rate of 0.7 percent, the Commerce Department
• said. That compares with a booming 6.9 percent annual
rate in the final three months of 1978.
It was the lowest single-quarter growth rate since the
0.1 percent decline reported tor the first quarter a year
ago.
The slower growth rate more than confirms govern
ment predictions that the economy is slowing from the
breakneck pace of late 1978.
In related developments:
— The Commerce Department said in its first-quarter
report that inflation increased at an 8.7 percent annual
rate, up from 8.2 percent in the last three months of
1978. But Secretary of Commerce Juanita Kreps said that
"there is good reason to believe that the worst may be
behind us, particularly in food."
— Disposable personal income rose $7.8 billion in the
first quarter to $991 billion on an annual basis, the de
partment said. The figure, which is adjusted for infla
tion, was 4 percent ahead of the first quarter of 1978.
Key SALT issue settled
Washington — The United States and the Soviet Union
have settled perhaps the key remaining issue in the
strategic arms negotiations, but still are not ready to sign
a treaty, administration sources said yesterday.
The U.S. sources, asking not to be identified, said
agreement had been reached on the rules for defining a
new missile type during the duration of the SALT II pact.
The definition of new missile types has been a major
unresolved issue.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin met for an hour yesterday evening.
Afterwards, State Department spokesman Tom Reston
said they had agreed to talk again this afternoon.
Mindful of unanticipated issues that have arisen in the
past to confound the negotiators, officials refused to
predict when the talks might end.
State Department spokesman Hodding Carter said
"real problems" remained to be resolved by Vance and
Dobrynin before the two sides discussed a summit meet
ing.
