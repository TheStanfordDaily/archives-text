Jane Fonda won an Academy
Award recently, but she didn't talk
about her movie career in her
speech and press conference
Wednesday night at the New Var
sity Theater in Palo Alto.
Fonda spoke at a sold-out be
nefit in support of the Palo Alto/
Mid-Peninsula chapter of the

Campaign for Economic Democ
racy (CED). The CED is a grass
roots political group which is
chaired by Fonda's husband, Tom
Hayden.
"It's nice to come in on a wave
of victories," Fonda said, "the
most publicized of which is, of
course, the Academy Award." But
she pointed to the recent passage
of rent control in Santa Monica
and the election of CED
supported candidates in Berkeley
as victories that are "historically
more important."
Fonda also urged support for
local CEDcandidates in Palo Alto's
upcoming elections for city coun
cil.
The CED wants to "restructure
the economy from the inside" by
getting the general public in
volved, through pressure and
representation, in government
and corporate decisions that af
fect their lives, Fonda said.
Urges solar power
Nuclear power is one area in
which such "life and death" deci
sions are made, Fonda stated.

"You can't simplistically say
'we're going to close down all
nuclear plants' because it would
dislocate a lot of things in the
economy. What you have to do is
begin to force the government to
seriously develop and promote
solar energy and real conserva
tion."
Fonda urged the government to
provide more funding for solar
power research, citing a "recent
federal study" which states that
solar electricity could be competi
tive with nuclear electricity by
1983 if the Pentagon were to
spend 1/250 th of its budget ($5OO
million) on the development of
solar energy.
She also criticized energy czar
lames Schlesinger and the Energy
Dept.'s emphasis on nuclear
power research. Pointing to
Schlesinger's past involvement
with the Atomic Energy Commis
sion, she called Schlesinger "an
apologist for the nuclear industry.
As my husband says," Fonda con
tinued, "to put Schlesinger in
charge of the solar development

in this country is like putting
Dracula in charge of the blood
bank."
Carter lets feather fly?
In the wake of Three Mile Is
land, President Jimmy Carter has
missed a "perfect" opportunity to
declare a "moratorium on any
new" construction of nuclear
power plants, Fonda declared.
Such a move "would have been a
feather in Carter's cap; it would
have been understandable and
justifiable," Fonda stated.
"Instead, Carter took
Schlesinger's position, saying we
have to go ahead with nuclear. It's
a right-wing position; it's an anti
life and anti-human being posi
tion."
Asked about Hoover Institute
fellow and nuclear advocate Ed
ward Teller's possible run for the
U.S. Senate against Alan Cranston
in 1980, Fonda declared, "I can't
believe that Mr. Teller would
stand a chance. Especially in the
wakeof Three Mile Island and The
China Syndrome." The public
