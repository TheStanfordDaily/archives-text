# Panel debates future of nuclear power in U.S.
## 
### Matthew Kreps 
Although agreeing on the sig
nificance of the recent accident at
the Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant, four panelists dis
puted the importance of nuclear
power in meeting America's
energy needs at a discussion held
in Kresge Auditorium here Wed
nesday night.
Three Mile Island will probably
doom an already-dying nuclear
industry, predicted fames Hard
ing, representing the anti-nuclear
Friends of the Earth. "With a
billion-dollar plant down the
tubes, no utilities corporation is
going to risk the shareholders'
money to build a similar plant,"
he said.
Dr. Edward Teller, the"fatherof
the hydrogen bomb" and senior
research fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, drew a different conclu
sion about the safety of nuclear
plants, and of nuclear reactors in
particular. "The reactor, while
badly damaged, did not melt
down ... so reactors are safer
than I thought," Teller said.
However, Teller did concede
that "There is no question what
soever that (Three Mile Island)
was a really ma|or accident."
Peter Faulkner, a SWOPSI in
structor, backed up Harding.
"The accident will have a severe
effect on people's confidence in
their government and in nuclear
power," warned Faulkner, who is
a nuclear consultant for Friends of
the Earth and author of The Silent
Bomb.
Other sources more dangerous?
While Dr. Bertram Wolfe, direc
tor of General Electric's San Jose
Nuclear Division, said his com
pany was taking Three Mile Island
"very seriously," he lumped the
Harrisburg, Penn., reactor with
three other nuclear accidents that
took no lives and asserted that
"nuclear is one of the safest, most
benign sources of energy we
have." He also noted that acci
dents involving coal smog, oil
tankers and natural gas pipelines
have killed many people.
Teller, whose folksy speaking
style clearly charmed a mostly
anti-nuclear audience into giving

him as much applause as given to
Harding and Faulkner, said that
other sources of energy are even
more dangerous than nuclear
power. "There are lots of poison
clouds, not just clouds of nuclear
fallout. Radiation does less dam
age than any other poison."
Wolfe added that the govern
ment pays $1 billion a year to help
coal miners with black-lung dis
ease and that it provides subsidies
to oil and natural gas develop
ment, as well as to nuclear power.
Oil dependence
There was little argument that
something has to replace oil as
America's main energy source.
Wolfe said that "dependence
upon oil is a possible recipe for
disaster," and Harding said,
"Nuclear power cannot suffi
ciently change the imported oil
crisis."
Wolfe also asserted, however,
that other new energy sources
such as the sun, biomass conver
sion, windmills and coal gasifica
tion, "are only hopes â€” and you
can't get electricity or heat your
home with hopes."
Teller took a middle road, cal
ling for personal conservation and
saying, "We must find every way
in which to supply energy."
New sources
He suggested the developed
countries give the world's remain
ing oil reserves to Third World
countries and find new sources.
"With every barrel of oil we re
place . . . we help the developing
countries really develop."
Faulkner accused the oil com
panies of bribing congressmen to
promote growth in the nuclear
industry they controlled. Faulkner
called nuclear power "uncon
stitutional," claiming that since
the government supported an in
dustry whose processes "are kil
ling people," it "deprives citizens
of their lives without due process
of law."
A standing-room-only crowd at
tended the debate, sponsored by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
SWOPSI and the Institute for
Energy Studies as part of Envi
ronment Month.
