# Lively Arts now predicts attendance with computers
## 
### Rebecca Moss 
I ively Arts, a program of the Public Events
Office, does not rely on intuition to predict
the size of audiences at its classical music and
dance events. Instead, to estimate atten
dance rates, Lively Arts uses a computer.
The computer program, in use for its
fourth year, was written by Charles Wein
berg, assoc late professor of marketing at the
Graduate School of Business and Ken
Schachmut, a recent graduate.
The program is usually used in September
and early October when Lively Arts directors
.ire arranging for the season lineup for I".'
years later. After the directors attend a con
ference outside the University, a list of possi
ble performers is compiled and presented to
the computer.
The computer predicts the season and
event attendance that can be expected for a
given lineup, according to Susan Farr, as
sociate director of Public Events.
"We then c an find out what we need to do
to augment the season and what types of
artists we need to bring to get the attendance
up to par," Farr said.
For example, if the computer predicts that
the scheduled season lineup will not gross
enough attendance, F art and her associates
arrange to bring other artists that will make
up for deficiencies in the scheduled prog
ram
Several years ago, Lively Arts suffered a
heavy decline in its spring quarter atten
dances. Fly bringing more popular acts in the
springtime, Lively Arts personnel were able
to "wipe out the 'spring quarter effect.' "

To date, the computer program has been
unusually accurate in its predictions, Farr
said. Actual attendance rarely varies more
than one or two percentage points from the
computer prediction.
Many of the variations in attendance can be
explained. Weather has a strong effect, for
example. "But," inventor WeinF)erg quips,
"when the weather forecasters can predict
the weather as accurately as we predict at
tendance then we might try to include it
(weather factors) in our program."
Because Public Events personnel do not
have to pay to use University computer
facilities, the cost is virtually free, Farr said.
Vicki Holt, director ot Public Events,
schedules an appontment with Weinberg
when she is ready to test a season lineup and
the two together run the data through the
computer.
One Fienelit of tho computer setup is that
historical year-to-year data is maintained.
We can trace the success of a certain type ot
event with the computer and can thus deter
mine what kinds of things are good sellers,"
Farr said.
In addition, turnovers in upper manage
ment positions have been more easily ac
comodated because of the system, lor in
stance, the present director, Holt, was able to
use data stored in the computer during her
tirst year as director, two years ago. Without
the computer program, Holt would have had
less to rely on when making judgments about
the success ot various groups and events,
Farr added.
