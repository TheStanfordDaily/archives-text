Dear Bug Me:
I love the Hoover Tower chimes, but I've often
wondered who plays them, how long they have
been doir\g so and how they decide what to
play.
-S.E.
Technically those aren't chimes you're hear
ing, but a carillon, by Webster's definition, "a
set of fixed, harmonized bells pitched in a
chromatic series and sounded by hammers con
trolled at a keyboard."
The University master is lames Angell, as
sociate chairman and professor of electrical en
gineering. A member of the Guild of Caril
lonneurs, Angell has played sincel9sl and is usu
ally up in the tower on Tuesdays and Thursdays
at 5 p.m.
"I like to mix up my selections a bit," Angell
said. "I usually pick something from the time of
Bach, as well as some modern.
"The biggest satisfaction is coming down and
hearing someone whistling a piece I've just
finished," he added.
On other days you're hearing Polly Boisse
vain, a junior in civil engineering and a student
of Angell's.
"I play things written specifically for the caril
lon and also do some modern arrangements like
'60s tunes," she said.
Among other pieces she's planning to play
this afternoon are "Wohin" by Schubert,
"Musette" by Bach and possibly her own ar
rangement of "Those Were the Days."
Incidentally, Margo Halsted, UC-Riverside's
official carillonneur, will give a concert from
Hoover on April 29 from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. Hals
ted is a Stanford alumna.

Dear Bug Me:
Can you find out who was responsible for
plastering the "Save Water" stickers around

campus? When will they remove them?
-S.B.
Robert McKnight, an engineerwith University
utilities, initiated the campaign at the height of
the 1976 summer drought.
The "plastering" is now under the jurisdiction
of the Energy Conservation Center, and accord
ing to director Karl johnson, the group is not
considering taking them down. Although Joe
Carrington, water and sewer superintendent,
said water supplies look "real good" for the rest
of the year, the Energy Center wants to keep
people conservation minded. Have you visited
Mono Lake recently?

Dear Bug Me:
Since winter the large dead and dying Eucalyp
tus trees near Palm Drive have been cut down
and converted to firewood. As an enthusiastic
fireplace owner, I would like to know the fate of
this wood and the possibilities of special access
afforded by student status.
-C.M.
According to Grounds Supervisor Herb Fong,
faculty, students and staff can pick up and carry
away as much wood lying on the ground as they
can handle, as long as they don't use axes or
saws. The larger pieces are used for curbing, but
Fong said his staff tries to cut the wood up in
fireplace sizes. They have prohibited the use of
saws to try to keep live trees from being cut
down.
Some of the trees, which died in the recent
drought and in the freeze of 1973, have been cut
by contractors who haul away the wood as part
of their fee.
Fong said only about two dozen trees across
campus still need to be felled and that his office
plans to begin replanting many of the lost groves
sometime in the future.
