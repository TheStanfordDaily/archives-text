business contacts. It will provide seniors with an
opportunity to distribute resumes. Undergrads
will be able to look at part-time and summer job

Job Faire directors Isaacs and Hector Cuevas
said that past CPPC efforts have been aimed at
counseling students and arranging job inter

views. However, many students don't use the
center's resources until the quarter before they
will graduate.
The idea for a job faire, like Wednesday's
event, came up at a brainstorming session of the
center's directors last fall.
"We wanted to educate students but also ac
quaint them with the center's services. The faire
will provide us with an opportunity to do this,"
Isaacs said.
The CPPC will set up its own booth outside the
CPPC office and CPPC workers will answer
questions and give information on CPPC ser
vices and on companies' booth locations.
The cost of the faire is $3000. Money for the
project is coming through various company
sponsorships.
