# Law students urge establishment of international nuclear authority
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Less than a month before the nuclear
power plant accident at Three Mile Island
gave worldwide prominence to the poten
tial dangers of nuclear power, a group of
12 law students here published a study
calling for the establishment of a new in
ternational monitoring authority to help
prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
The book, Evaluation of a Proposal for an
Integrated Fuel Authority, sets forth a plan
to integrate the entire nuclear fuel cycle,
except for nuclear reactors, under the In
ternational Nuclear Fuel Authority (INFA).
Nuclear power plants are already
safeguarded by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (lAEA), according to the
report.
The agency would have control over
uranium ore supply, enrichment, fuel fab
rication and reprocessing facilities, re
search and development, transportation
and waste disposal.
The primary purpose of INFA would be
to reduce the likelihood of nuclear
weapons being used by nations or "subna
tional entities."
"To do this," state the authors, "INFA
would control all nuclear materials used in
civilian reactors, and would own or oper
ate all those fuel cycles needed to make

their control credible and effective."
According to the study, "The interna
tional nuclear fuel system does need sub
stantial reform and discussions are now
underway towards reform of several of its
components."
But why is reform necessary? The study
explains that "this view is partly a reaction
to the Indian explosion" of an atomic
bomb after India claimed to be developing
nuclear power strictly for "peaceful" pur
poses. "It is also a reaction to risks which
have only recently entered the decision
makers' perceptions â€” the risk that ter
rorists will divert nuclear materials and the
risk that a nation will separate substantial
amounts of weapons material . . . and
then abrogate the (nuclear proliferation)
treaty."
At the present time, the study states,
over 15 non-nuclear weapons states have
operational nuclear power programs, and
many more have reactors under construc
tion. While the study concedes that the
spent fuel in most of these reactors is not
"directly useable" it "does contain
enough plutonium to make large numbers
of nuclear weapons."
Although countries joining the INFA
would have to relinquish national control
over fuel cycle activities they "would ob

tain assurance of a continuous supply of
nuclear fuel for their electrical generating
plants.
"Membership would be open to all na
tions, and sanctions would be applied only
upon violations of agreed-upon stan
dards," according to the plan.
Law School Prof. John Barton, who
supervised the project, said the politics of
creating an authority with such wide pow
ers may be no worse than those of incre
mental change.
"The sweeping system we propose is
likely to be more feasible politically within
the next few years than in the distant fu
ture."
According to Barton, "Given what hap
pened in Pennsylvania those pressures (to
establish the INFA) might be greater." He
said the organization would probably not
be implemented for at least five years,
however.
The book was written by the Stanford
Law School Nuclear Fuel Cycle Working
Group which consists of 12 law students.
The group formed following a seminar this
year in the legal aspects of arms control.
"The book is the result of a type of teach
ing that emphasized a new depth of in
teraction among students, and between
students and experts," Barton said.
