## Stop race to destruction 
### 
April 7 was an ominous day
for the world community, for
in Groton, Conn., a monster
was put to sea; one far more
terrifying than any conceived
in the myths of past societies.
This monster is the Trident
submarine, the most destruc
tive weapons system ever de
vised. Christened the Ohio, the
ship is only the first of 14 Tri
dent submarines now
scheduled for construction.
The Navy wants 30 in operation
by 1992.
The Trident is larger than a
destroyer: it is 560 feet long,
about 14 stories high, and
weighs more than 18,000 tons.
Each ship will be loaded with 24
ballistic missiles. Initially these
will be Trident I missiles which
have a range of 4000 miles and
are fitted with eight indepen
dently targeted 100-kiloton
warheads.
But this is only the begin
ning! By the late 1980s, the
more powerful Trident II mis
sile is scheduled to be de
ployed. This second
generation missile will have a
6000-mile range and be fitted
with 14 150-kiloton warheads,
thus giving every submarine
the capability to launch over
300 nuclear bombs to separate
targets, each of them at least 10
times more destructive than
the bomb which laid waste the
city of Hiroshima.
Besides carrying more pow
erful warheads, the Trident II
missile will have extreme accu
racy; it will be able to deliver its
warheads to within 300 feet of
the target. This type of accu
racy has no purpose in the
strategy of retaliation, or as it is
commonly known, Mutual As
sured Destruction (which has
the appropriate acronym of
MAD). As official U.S. policy
for over two decades, MAD
simply means that if any coun
try attacked the United States,
it would be assured of its own
destruction by our vast retalia
tion force.
The planned accuracy of the
new missiles, however, signals
an extremely dangerous shift
in policy. This is because the
only purpose of pinpoint accu
racy would be to destroy Soviet
missiles in their hardened
silos, and this is possible only
by attacking first, as under any
other circumstances — such as
retaliation — the silos would
be empty. The Trident sub
marine, along with the MX mis
sile and other new weapons
now in development, will give
the United States a potential
first-strike force as outlined in
the 1979 defense posture
statement of Secretary of De
fense Harold Brown.
Establishing a first-strike
force will place both the Un

ited States and the Soviet
Union on a hair-trigger alert,
each afraid the other will attack
first, thus significantly increas
ing the odds of a nuclear war
starting by accident or miscal
culation. First-strike deploy
ment could be the last rung on
the escalation ladder; the final
act of the architects of exter
mination who have dominated
events through much of this
century, and whose collective
mentality has now turned our
planet into a ticking time
bomb; one saturated with at
least 60,000 nuclear weapons.
In this context the Trident is
only one of the massive new
weapons systems programmed
over the coming decade. The
Pentagon, forexample, reports
that it has $238 billion in plan
ned new weapons to be built
over the next eight to 10 years.
President )immy Carter, the
candidate who vowed to re
duce military spending and
work toward zero nuclear
weapons, also projects this
dramatic rise in weaponry
through his fiscal 1980 defense
budget. At a record $125.8 bill
ion, the 1980 budget allocates
nearly $50 billion for weapons
and other equipment, includ
ing $13.4 billion for research
and development of new
weapons.
The pending SALT II treaty
will have little effect on these
plans. In fact, Brown has been
touring the country assuring
foes of the treaty and members
of Congress that SALT II will
not prohibit production of the
new weapons or affect the pro
jected rise in military spending
over the coming years. How
ever, even though SALT II will
not stop the arms race, it must
be supported as approval is
mandatory to move on to what

must become serious negotia
tions toward real disarmament
steps in SALT 111.
Time to change the current
drift toward a global catas
trophe is critical; particularly
considering the amount of de
structive power already ac
cumulated. The United States
alone has a nuclear stockpile
equal to over 600,000
Hiroshima-type bombs, and
the United States and the
Soviet Union have a collective
stockpile equal to more than
one million Hiroshimas. Put
another way, this is theoreti
cally enough to kill every per
son on earth 25 times. Each
side also has over 2000 delivery
systems which are capable of
placing this arsenal of
genocide anywhere on the
globe within minutes.
Perhaps the accident at
Three Mile Island will help to
awaken more people to the
overall crisis and understand
that both ends of the nuclear
spectrum — power plants and
weapons — are connected;
that whatever the cost, the nuc
lear genie must be put back in
the bottle before it becomes
the god of destruction.
On May 5 thousands of con
cerned people from through
out the Bay Area will gather in
Livermore to express this goal
at a peaceful rally which fea
tures many qualified speakers.
The location is the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, which
along with the Los Alamos Lab
in New Mexico, is responsible
for developing and testing
every nuclear weapon in the
U.S. arsenal — including the
new warhead for the Trident
missile.

commonly known, Mutual As
sured Destruction (which has
the appropriate acronym of
MAD). As official U.S. policy
for over two decades, MAD
simply means that if any coun
try attacked the United States,
it would be assured of its own
destruction by our vast retalia
tion force.
The planned accuracy of the
new missiles, however, signals
an extremely dangerous shift
in policy. This is because the
only purpose of pinpoint accu
racy would be to destroy Soviet
missiles in their hardened
silos, and this is possible only
by attacking first, as under any
other circumstances — such as
retaliation — the silos would
be empty. The Trident sub
marine, along with the MX mis
sile and other new weapons
now in development, will give
the United States a potential
first-strike force as outlined in
the 1979 defense posture
statement of Secretary of De
fense Harold Brown.
Establishing a first-strike
force will place both the Un

ited States and the Soviet
Union on a hair-trigger alert,
each afraid the other will attack
first, thus significantly increas
ing the odds of a nuclear war
starting by accident or miscal
culation. First-strike deploy
ment could be the last rung on
the escalation ladder; the final
act of the architects of exter
mination who have dominated
events through much of this
century, and whose collective
mentality has now turned our
planet into a ticking time
bomb; one saturated with at
least 60,000 nuclear weapons.
In this context the Trident is
only one of the massive new
weapons systems programmed
over the coming decade. The
Pentagon, forexample, reports
that it has $238 billion in plan
ned new weapons to be built
over the next eight to 10 years.
President )immy Carter, the
candidate who vowed to re
duce military spending and
work toward zero nuclear
weapons, also projects this
dramatic rise in weaponry
through his fiscal 1980 defense
budget. At a record $125.8 bill
ion, the 1980 budget allocates
nearly $50 billion for weapons
and other equipment, includ
ing $13.4 billion for research
and development of new
weapons.
The pending SALT II treaty
will have little effect on these
plans. In fact, Brown has been
touring the country assuring
foes of the treaty and members
of Congress that SALT II will
not prohibit production of the
new weapons or affect the pro
jected rise in military spending
over the coming years. How
ever, even though SALT II will
not stop the arms race, it must
be supported as approval is
mandatory to move on to what

must become serious negotia
tions toward real disarmament
steps in SALT 111.
Time to change the current
drift toward a global catas
trophe is critical; particularly
considering the amount of de
structive power already ac
cumulated. The United States
alone has a nuclear stockpile
equal to over 600,000
Hiroshima-type bombs, and
the United States and the
Soviet Union have a collective
stockpile equal to more than
one million Hiroshimas. Put
another way, this is theoreti
cally enough to kill every per
son on earth 25 times. Each
side also has over 2000 delivery
systems which are capable of
placing this arsenal of
genocide anywhere on the
globe within minutes.
Perhaps the accident at
Three Mile Island will help to
awaken more people to the
overall crisis and understand
that both ends of the nuclear
spectrum — power plants and
weapons — are connected;
that whatever the cost, the nuc
lear genie must be put back in
the bottle before it becomes
the god of destruction.
On May 5 thousands of con
cerned people from through
out the Bay Area will gather in
Livermore to express this goal
at a peaceful rally which fea
tures many qualified speakers.
The location is the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, which
along with the Los Alamos Lab
in New Mexico, is responsible
for developing and testing
every nuclear weapon in the
U.S. arsenal — including the
new warhead for the Trident
missile.

self as a "peace activist.")
April 7 was an ominous day
for the world community, for
in Groton, Conn., a monster
was put to sea; one far more
terrifying than any conceived
in the myths of past societies.
This monster is the Trident
submarine, the most destruc
tive weapons system ever de
vised. Christened the Ohio, the
ship is only the first of 14 Tri
dent submarines now
scheduled for construction.
The Navy wants 30 in operation
by 1992.
The Trident is larger than a
destroyer: it is 560 feet long,
about 14 stories high, and
weighs more than 18,000 tons.
Each ship will be loaded with 24
ballistic missiles. Initially these
will be Trident I missiles which
have a range of 4000 miles and
are fitted with eight indepen
dently targeted 100-kiloton
warheads.
But this is only the begin
ning! By the late 1980s, the
more powerful Trident II mis
sile is scheduled to be de
ployed. This second
generation missile will have a
6000-mile range and be fitted
with 14 150-kiloton warheads,
thus giving every submarine
the capability to launch over
300 nuclear bombs to separate
targets, each of them at least 10
times more destructive than
the bomb which laid waste the
city of Hiroshima.
Besides carrying more pow
erful warheads, the Trident II
missile will have extreme accu
racy; it will be able to deliver its
warheads to within 300 feet of
the target. This type of accu
racy has no purpose in the
strategy of retaliation, or as it is
commonly known, Mutual As
sured Destruction (which has
the appropriate acronym of
