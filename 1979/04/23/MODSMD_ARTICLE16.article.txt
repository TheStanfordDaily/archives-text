## Back in the groove 
### 
My stomach started churn
ing and I started asking stran
gers "what's your major?" That
was my immediate reaction to
visiting the Tours overseas
campus. After traveling
through Europe for nine
months without a schedule, I
realized returning to Stanford
was going to be a bigger transi
tion than I expected. But April
rolled around and I signed up
for a few classes, switching my
title from "drop-out" to stu
dent.
For awhile I thought I was
ultra-popular. All my friends
came over, the phone rang in
cessantly, my presence excited
everyone! And then there was
the second week. My room is
now quiet enough to study in,
the phone a wasted investment
and I bore my friends again.
But this all happened at just
about the right time. With the
beginning of classes comes the
beginning of the "friendship
phenomenon" which besets
Stanford students. It's what
causes comments to your best
friend like "we'll have to get
together this quarter" and to
your boy or girlfriend, "it's a
date — UGLY at 7:30 Saturday
night, see ya there."
Every minute of your day
seems to have a function, even
your leisure time. One doesn't
just waste an afternoon; one
"invests" time in physical fit
ness, accomplishes postponed
shopping, or make one's token
beach trip.
I also had to adapt to most
students' everpresent compla
cency atthis happy, disciplined
island called Stanford. The
filthy train stations, lumpy hos
tel beds and major-event
showers .ieemed more than
just an ocean away. The cam
pus, so >unny and manicured,
so full of fun and frisbees, is
definite resort brochure mate
rial.

And then there are American
men: relaxed, unaggressive,
and ever so cool. What hap
pend to the exciting, sensual
Latin lovers and French roman
tics who whistled at all women?
No longer did I need my multi
lingual obscenity dictionary to
help ward them off. It was al
most too simple.
Despite all my gripes, there
is hope. And I have a choice;
I can either learn to adapt and
survive or become extinct in a
train station in Europe.
