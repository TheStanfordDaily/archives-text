# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Chamberlin and Gardenswartz 1984 Olympics to be held here 
### 
Never before have so many
problems confronted the Uni
versity community: housing
shortages, rising tuition costs,
divestment dilemmas, tenure
controversies, student apathy,
and the list continues. Trou
bles abound and solutions are
evasive. Woe is Stanford.
But take heart, compatriots,
we have chanced upon the sec

ret of the University's higher
echelons. While standing
amid the bookstore's crowds,
scrambling to procure the
latest t-shirt, we overheard the
oracles of Old Union oligar
chy: one tall and lanky, graying
at the temples and clutching a
Ouija board; the other, shorter
and balding, muttering some
thing about the fort founda
tion. As we contemplated the
pros and cons of taking the bag
at the check-out counter, we
overheard their unintentional
disclosure of this saving
scheme: Stanford will host the
1984 Summer Olympics.
Now we realize that you too
have probably accepted the
common belief that the 1984
Olympics will be held in Los
Angeles. Friends, this is merely a
false rumor, propagated to
deter tourists from prema
turely invading the Farm! After
all, can you really imagine the
Olympics in the Smog City?
Mattel could not possibly meet
the demands for plastic Mickey
Mouse dolls saying "LA loves
the Olympics" in 24 different
languages. Could more cars
possibly be squeezed onto the

already overflowing black
topped labyrinths? Be realistic,
people.
You still may beshakingyour
head in disbelief, but take a
look around, comrades, fqrthe
University has already begun
subtle preparation for the
Games. You don't think the
History Corner of the Quad is
actually being renovated, do
you? Two years to put up a
building that's already there?
Nonsense. They're actually
equipping it with rings, mats,
and parallel bars to house the
gymnastics competitions. The
supposed new addition to the
library is, in reality, the indoor
swimming complex. Re
member when they filled it last
fall? (Broken pipes, my eye.)
After all, where do you think
the ASSU Senate is going to put
the merge pool? And Alber's
high jump bit will surely be the
talk of Olympic afficionados
everywhere.
Why at Stanford? Elemen
tary. Hosting the Olympics ef
fectively solves the major prob
lems on campus, offering Stan
ford a chance to rise from the
dreary abyss into which it has
descended. For instance, the
Games will solve financial dif
ficulties. Sure, it's expensive to
put on the Olympics, but just
imagine how much we're
going to soak those Moscow
television stations for broad
casting rights. Besides, we can
make a proverbial fortune sel
ling Hoover Tower statuettes
and LiMle Leland glow-in-the
dark ash trays as Olympic
souveniis.
The resulting profits will in
turn solve other problems.
First of all, the need to house
all those athletes and guests
will require more living quar
ters; the consequent construc
tion expediency has already in
itiated plans for a new dorm
(the beautiful parking lot is al
ready paved in position), and
who knows what will happen
to Manzanita Park?
Secondly, the Games will
better every facet of the Stan
ford athletic program: from
improved and expanded
facilities (you'll soon be hear
ing of the new lighted tennis
courts), to the greater success
in the recruiting program,
surely aided by the extensive
media coverage reverberating
the University's name
throughout the golden footh
ills and towering cypress.

Thirdly, the increased re
venues will go far towards end
ing controversies over tenure
and divestment. Not only will
the University have more
money with which to guaran
tee salaries to professors, but it
will also be inclined to avoid
the nasty attention drawn in ef
fectively firing outstanding
teachers. Financial success will
reduce University dependence
on investment returns,
facilitating divestment from
companies in South Africa.
As the reader may have al
ready guessed, the games will
also provide a new mascot al
ternative — the "Olympians"
— which simultaneously intro
duces a logo around which we
may proudly rally and,
perhaps, even end the Coors
controversy by establishing
Olympia beer as the officially
endorsed beer of the "Olym
pians." (Who needs to deal
seriously with unpleasant is
sues?)
The effect of hosting the
Olympics extends similarly to
the more mundane inconveni
ences of Stanford life. For
example, take the newly instal
led shower heads (. . .please?)
No one really cares about con
serving energy, let alone wa
ter, anymore, do they? Obvi
ously, the actual role of these
avant-garde appendages is to
rechannel the water used for
showers to Lake Lagunita, as
suring a sufficient amount for
the rowing events. Alas, this
ingenious, if not ingenuous,
plan may not work. After all,
students of a major educa
tional institution such as Stan
ford cannot be duped!
Finally, Stanford school
spirit will rise from its nadir,
the spectacle of sport galvaniz
ing emotion and precipitating
an atmosphere of pride in the
knowledge that Stanford has
once again recorded a col
legiate first. (Take that, Har
vard.)
And so, in the summer of '84,
as Hal Mickelson joins Jim
Simpson in the booth, and the
LS|UMB plays "White Pinkos
on Dope" while the Com
munist athletes march in for
the opening ceremonies, Stan
ford University will once again
raise its triumphant head, re
turning to prominence, its
problems solved.
