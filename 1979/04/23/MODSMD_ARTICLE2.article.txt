# 'Malaise' in higher education?
## 
### Craig Comstock 
Washington â€” "Malaise" was a
word that kept cropping up at the
annual conference of the American
Association for Higher Education
(AAHE) held here last week.
Vet it seemed that it was more than
just a vague feeling of decline that
prompted the pessimistic comments
made by some of the approximately
2500 administrators and specialists
who attended the conference.
According to I ewis Solmon of UC
LA's Higher Education Research In
stitute, higher education is coming
to be marked by graduate students in
many fields who can't find challeng
ing jobs and faculty who "either do
not know what the situation really is,
or are unwilling to believe bad news,
or will not be honest with students
who are needed to fill classrooms
and teach freshman sections."
Professors are increasingly "tyran
nized by a research model" even
though surveys show many of them
would prefer to give more effort to
teaching, said Everett Ladd, director
of the University of Connecticut's
Social Science Center.
Reluctance
Department chairpersons and
deans are "increasingly reluctant to
spend their political capital to push
for the hiring of a woman faculty
member or the admission of a
Chicano graduate student," said
Frank Newman, a former Stanford
administrator who is rfow president
of the University of Rhode Island.
And junior faculty and adminis
trators "stuck" in their careers are
beginning to "wheel like vultures
waiting to strike as soon as some
body thinks they might vacate a posi
tion," according to Rosaheth Moss
Canter, a sociology professor at Yale.
When Canter asked administrators
what was most satisfying about their
jobs, she got answers such as "rescu
ing the system from financial disas
ter" and "saving blood."
Canter also lamented the increas
ing number of "young scholars who
are afraid now to take an intellectual
risk anymore," who "instead try to
learn the formula for getting pub
lished in standard journals so they
can make sure they have safe articles

and lots of them."
Alongside less drastic outlooks,
many speakers pieced together a pic
ture of a declining industry, poised
between a long boom (which began
about when current undergraduates
were born) and a substantial contrac
tion that will be caused by a forth
coming shortage of students.
Although the Carnegie Council on
Policy Studies in Higher Education
has not released its updated report
on future enrollments, chairman
Clark Kerr gave the Daily a preview.
"You're not going to come up with
the drastic reduction some people
are predicting, as much as 40 per
cent, but nevertheless there's going
to be a frantic scramble for stu
dents," Kerr said.
In his talk to the AAHE, Kerr added
that "we're seeing now, and may see
to an increasing extent, some of the
pathologies of an increasingly
market-oriented conduct of higher
education."
Some good news
The good news is that demog
raphic curves predict better times
after 1995, or roughly the time that
professors now attaining tenure will
turn 50.
As graduate students and faculty
all know, after a young professor
neared the end of a severvyear prob
ationary period, his or her institution
must generally decide whether to as
sure lifetime job security or to let the
professor go elsewhere.
Long defended as a guarantee of
academic freedom, at least for senior
faculty, tenure came under attack at
the conference last week from a fa
culty member who has given up his
own job security, on principle.
"Who benefits from tenure?"
asked James O'Toole of USC. "I
don't think it'stheyoung highlyqual
ified scholars who now find no
places, and I doubt it's the students
who could benefit from this lost gen
eration of scholars who frequently
are more qualified than the ones
whose places they will never take,
and I don't think it's the blacks and
women who want jobs in academia
but find that affirmative action is vit
iated by the fully-tenured depart
ments."

Author of Work in America,
O'Toole claimed that "tenure under
cuts academic freedom by putting
power in the hands of some senior
faculty who impose doctrinal or
thodoxy on the untenured junior fa
culty."
The new protections for academic
freedom, he said, are "the insistence
by courts that universities provide
