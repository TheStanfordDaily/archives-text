"Ask not what you can do for
your country, but what your
country can do for you" — and
not former President )ohn
Kennedy's original totalitarian
formula — best summarizes
the United States' contribution
to political thought. Govern
ment exists to serve the
people, not vice-versa.
Delighted with this liberal
idea once they came up with it,
Americans have since tried to
apply it everywhere. "Deregu
late!" is a cry as old as the
Founders, who urged it suc
cessfully against England.

However, like their contem
porary economist Adam
Smith, George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson and the rest
never shared modern Ameri
ca's boundless confidence that
one need merely shift a task
from the government to the
marketplace to get it done right
or even efficiently.
In particular, the Founders
would not have regarded milit
ary service as the commodity it
has become today. Although
they were anti-totalitarian be
fore there was totalitarianism,
they also believed that service

to their country was a duty, not
an economic choice.
Assume there is some need
for a national defense force.
(Bellicose enemies exist inde
pendently of the Pentagon's in
flamed imagination.) Can this
force be raised by the nation's
present recruiting system?
In lieu of national service,
the United States is at present
one of the few countries in the
world which fills its defense
manpower needs on the open
market. Recruiters sell the
Army with thousands of com
mercials to potential soldiers,
encouraging them to sign on
the dotted line.
Unsurprisingly, the ads ap
peal to self-interest and offer
career opportunities. In effect,
the Army gives jobs, compet
ing in the labor market with
other employers.
Theoretically, securing the
desired quantity and quality of
individuals calls for nothing
more than offering competi
tive prices, in the form of sol
diers' wages and benefits.
In practice, the country
seeks to have its cake and eat it
too. Despite expenditures of
billions of dollars, the incen
tives offered have clearly fallen
short, to judge by the armed
forces' continuing inability to
meet their quotas.
By all accounts an even
grimmer picture emerges
when considering recent re
cruits' quality — a portrait of
low motivation and frequently
substandard intelligence.
The classic market solution is
to stimulate supply by raising
prices. But in this heyday of

tax-cutting and budget
balancing, no one really cares
enough to foot the bill.
Perhaps the public senses
that the finest army money can
buy may not, after all is said
and done, be worth much.
Some goods are scarce and
yet not economic or even un
derstandable in economic
terms. Love is more precious
when it is freely offered than
when it is bought, even when a
high price is paid.
Similarly, it is a mistake to
reduce national service to
questions of dollars and cents.
Instead, like familial or con
jugal obligations, such service
should be reckoned a neces
sary part of belonging to a large
community. Its costs are no
more calculable but just as un
deniable as are its benefits. No
additional contract or remun
eration should be necessary to
create an obligation to serve as
well as to benefit.
To defend and even to die
for one's country is an obliga
tion not just because the gov
ernment asks it, but because
forming part of society should
inculcate the need to give as
well as to receive.
1 o pretend that such an issue
can be reduced to its economic
dimension and relegated, along
with everything else, to the
marketplace not only parodies
the liberalism of the country's
Founders, it undermines socie
ty's moral and political founda
tions and cheapens the mo
tives of millions who have
served and died.

"Ask not what you can do for
your country, but what your
country can do for you" — and
not former President )ohn
Kennedy's original totalitarian
formula — best summarizes
the United States' contribution
to political thought. Govern
ment exists to serve the
people, not vice-versa.
Delighted with this liberal
idea once they came up with it,
Americans have since tried to
apply it everywhere. "Deregu
late!" is a cry as old as the
Founders, who urged it suc
cessfully against England.

However, like their contem
porary economist Adam
Smith, George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson and the rest
never shared modern Ameri
ca's boundless confidence that
one need merely shift a task
from the government to the
marketplace to get it done right
or even efficiently.
In particular, the Founders
would not have regarded milit
ary service as the commodity it
has become today. Although
they were anti-totalitarian be
fore there was totalitarianism,
they also believed that service

to their country was a duty, not
an economic choice.
Assume there is some need
for a national defense force.
(Bellicose enemies exist inde
pendently of the Pentagon's in
flamed imagination.) Can this
force be raised by the nation's
present recruiting system?
In lieu of national service,
the United States is at present
one of the few countries in the
world which fills its defense
manpower needs on the open
market. Recruiters sell the
Army with thousands of com
mercials to potential soldiers,
encouraging them to sign on
the dotted line.
Unsurprisingly, the ads ap
peal to self-interest and offer
career opportunities. In effect,
the Army gives jobs, compet
ing in the labor market with
other employers.
Theoretically, securing the
desired quantity and quality of
individuals calls for nothing
more than offering competi
tive prices, in the form of sol
diers' wages and benefits.
In practice, the country
seeks to have its cake and eat it
too. Despite expenditures of
billions of dollars, the incen
tives offered have clearly fallen
short, to judge by the armed
forces' continuing inability to
meet their quotas.
By all accounts an even
grimmer picture emerges
when considering recent re
cruits' quality — a portrait of
low motivation and frequently
substandard intelligence.
The classic market solution is
to stimulate supply by raising
prices. But in this heyday of

tax-cutting and budget
balancing, no one really cares
enough to foot the bill.
Perhaps the public senses
that the finest army money can
buy may not, after all is said
and done, be worth much.
Some goods are scarce and
yet not economic or even un
derstandable in economic
terms. Love is more precious
when it is freely offered than
when it is bought, even when a
high price is paid.
Similarly, it is a mistake to
reduce national service to
questions of dollars and cents.
Instead, like familial or con
jugal obligations, such service
should be reckoned a neces
sary part of belonging to a large
community. Its costs are no
more calculable but just as un
deniable as are its benefits. No
additional contract or remun
eration should be necessary to
create an obligation to serve as
well as to benefit.
To defend and even to die
for one's country is an obliga
tion not just because the gov
ernment asks it, but because
forming part of society should
inculcate the need to give as
well as to receive.
1 o pretend that such an issue
can be reduced to its economic
dimension and relegated, along
with everything else, to the
marketplace not only parodies
the liberalism of the country's
Founders, it undermines socie
ty's moral and political founda
tions and cheapens the mo
tives of millions who have
served and died.
