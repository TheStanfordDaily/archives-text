Nuke hazards real
I'd like to see Paul Cassell
convince the people of Harris
burg that nuclear power plants
are "innocuous," which is how
he described them in his col
umn {Daily, April 18).
Cassell would have us be
lieve that nuclear power plants
are safer than other means of
generating energy because
fewer people have died as a re
sult of nuclear power than have
died from production of solar
and wind power in like
amounts.
I'm surprised that anyone
would need to be reminded of
the horrifying potential dan
gers of nuclear power plants,
dangers which far exceed
those associated with wind or
solar collection devices.
Cassell's proposal is like
suggesting that the next time
two countries decide to have a
war, it would be safest for them
to use hydrogen bombs be
cause no one has ever been kil
led in a war fought with hydro
gen bombs.
His logic appeals to the naive
hope that because the worst has
notyet happened, it never will.
)ust as absurd is Cassell's no
tion that because the worst has
dangerous than nuclear power
because 50,000 people a year
die from the manufacture of
asbestos.
If one form of conservation
creates a danger, we should try
to abate the danger
There are too many un
answered questions about
nuclear power plants for us to
accept the risks they pose. Un
less we want more and more
radioactive time bombs
erected around the country,
we need to turn our attention
to better exploiting the energy
resources of the sun.

Gregory Raymond's men
dacious little letter bewailing
the retrospective program of
films and talks on McCarthyism
now being held at Stanford
(Daily, April 19), is more
eloquent proof than anything
we Marxist professors could
invent that such a program is
necessary. Talented and hon
est public servants and profes
sors, long since vindicated for
their views and their loyalties,
are once more tagged with silly
and damaging labels; "sophis
ticated microfilm . . . equip
ment" is supposed to conjure
up skulduggery in musty
communist lofts; the sacred
texts (the McCarthy committee
hearings) are implied to be
True because Sacred.
That diplomats |ohn Service
and Owen Lattimore ever had
to be vindicated at all was the
real triumph of the McCar
thyists. The time it has taken
the United States to retrieve
reality from the meanness of
cold-war anticommunism has
been great and wasteful and
shameful.
Raymond tells us we should
read the McCarthy hearings in
full. Ves. And he might add, the
McCarran Committee hearings
too. And Service's remarkable
dispatches from wartime
China. And Lattimore's un
paralleled oeuvre on Mongo
lia and China.
Curious, then, isn't it, that
he would deny the usefulness
of the McCarthyism series?
Service (April 23) and Lattimore
(May 16 and 17) will speak for
themselves. And Raymond's
nostalgia to the contrary not
withstanding, Joseph Stalin
will not be whispering in any
body's ear.
