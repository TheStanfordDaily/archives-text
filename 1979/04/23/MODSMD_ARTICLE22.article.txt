# LAC to sponsor grad student workshops
## 
### Susan Owen 
This spring, in a first step to
wards remedying the unique
problems of masters and Ph.D.
candidates, the Learning Assis
tance Center (LAC) will offer
four new workshops.
These special workshopswill
include "Introduction to the
Administrative Details of an

Advanced Degree: Making the
Machine Run Smoothly" (April
24), "Doing Graduate Work at
Stanford: A Minority View"
(May 1), "Coming Back Later:
The Problems and Respon
sibilities of Re-entry Women"
(May 8) and"The Orals: The
First Big Step" (May 15).
The administrative details

workshop and the orals work
shop should help improve
many graduate students'
knowledge of the long and
complicated Ph.D. process
which includes dealings with
the University bureaucracy,
securing grants, choosing a re
search topic, writing a disserta
tion, and setting up an oral

exam.
The other workshops of
fered this spring will pay par
ticular attention to more per
sonal adjustment problems
faced by minority and re-entry
graduate students. According
to Kathleen Poss, who will lead
the workshop on re-entry wo
men, "Coming Back Later,"
students reentering school
must sometimes contend with
role models that they find un
satisfactory. "
Women in their mid-40s and
50s, with college-age children,
often find professors reluctant
to spend time with them.
"They're not overtly sexist, but
they pull back."
lose Macias will be offering
the second workshop, "A
Minority View," aimed at aid
ing minority students with
such difficulties as language
barriers and unfulfilled expec
tations of life here. "

Macias added that graduate
students here are particularly
reluctant to seek the aid which
LAC workshops can provide.
The idea that graduate stu
dents do not need LAC courses
as much as undergraduates "is
a false assumption, corrabo
rated not only by surveys, but
by Stanford faculty in several
departments," Macias said.
All the workshops are pilot
programs aimed at getting
input and feedback from stu
dents so that a nine-workshop
course, now being planned for
next fall, can be improved.
According to LAC Director
Carolyn Walker, LAC will also
sponsor tutorial services in
writing and statistics. The
workshop-tutorial program
was prompted by a survey sent
out last fall to 898 minority and
reentry grad students. The sur
vey confirmed predictions that
most graduate students' needs
were not being met.
