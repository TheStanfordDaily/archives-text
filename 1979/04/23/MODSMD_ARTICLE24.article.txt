# New hotline opens for battered women
## 
### Cheryl Zollars 
Day or night, battered
women may now find
emergency relief via a hotline
staffed by volunteers of the
Mid-Peninsula Support Net
work.
Since mid-February, the 24-
hour, seven-day-a-week hot
line (964-2266) has given im
mediate aid and long-term as
sistance for battered women.
"We focus on both physical
and psychological abuse," said
Alice Ito, training coordinator.
"Sometimes there is a fine line
between them, but both are
damaging to the woman and
her children."
Five staff members and 25
volunteers, trained in the prob
lems of domestic violence and
crisis intervention, "give emo
tional support, practical advice
and survival assistance," said
Ito.
The network's free services

include finding shelter and
providing information on legal
procedures, government aid
and available community re
sources.
Staff members consider the
hotline "a major develop
ment" in helping battered
women. According to Cynthia
Ellwood, spokeswoman,
"Most wife abuse happens dur
ing the hours that social service
agencies are closed."
The lack of a permanent
shelter for women poses a
major problem, hotline staff
members argue.
Funding for the Mid-
Peninsula Support Network
comes from the Packard Foun
dation, CETA grants, the
Community Foundation of
Santa Clara County and dona
tions. Its directors worry, how
ever, that grants may cease or
be cut in the future.
