# Batters batter 'Zona twice

### Cathy Ditkerson 
After clobbering Arizona 13-7 Friday af
ternoon and 13-4 Saturday, the Stanford
Cardinals were robbed of the opportunity
to record their first sweep of a league
series since 1976 in the final game of the
weekend.
More importantly, Sunday's 8-6 loss to
the visiting Wildcats dashed the Cardinals'
hopes of being only one game out of sec
ond place in the Pacific-IO Conference's
Southern Division. Instead Stanford
dropped to fifth in the league standings
with a 9-12 record.
Meanwhile, UCLA claimed a three-game
set from Arizona State over the weekend
to extend its Pac-10 record to 16-5. Califor
nia lost two out of three games to USC, but
held onto second place with an 11-10
mark.
Arizona and USC are now tied for third
with 10-11 records and Arizona State
brings up the rear with a 6-15 mark.
The team placing second in the South
ern Division will play off with the Pac-10
Northern Division champion to determine
the second conference representative in
the 1979 NCAA baseball tournament.
The Cards have only nine games of
league play remaining in the '79 season,
and five of the nine are away. The three
game series against the Trojans at USC this
coming weekend will be critical.
But in what better form could the Cards

head for Los Angeles than coming off their
best offensive series of the year?
Stanford scored a total of 32 runs on 41
hits, including eight home runs by seven
different batters, in the series against
Arizona. If the Cardinal bats don't cool by
Thursday, the series against USC is going
to be something to watch.

wins by picking up hi l?sth in Siturdiv's

and Dan Shaw.
Stanford dominated the first two games
of the series this past weekend, but the
Sundav contest was a see-saw affair.
The Wildcats jumped into the lead in the
top of the second inning scoring once off
starter Brian Harrison. In the third, a walk,
two singles and a misplayed routine fly ball
added three more runs to their score.
Stanford retaliated in the bottom of the
third with two runs on a single by Loring
Davies, a double by Larry Reynolds and a
two-RBI grounder to the left side by Phil
Wilson.
After scrapping for another run in the
bottom of the fourth, Davies — who went
two-for-four on the day — knotted the
score at 5-5 with one swing of the bat and
teammate Mike Toothman on first.
Larry Kuhn, who came on in relief of
Harrison in the top of the fifth, then

worked two easy innings against the
Wildcats. When the Cards scored once in
the eighth on an error by the Cats third
baseman it looked like a sweep could be a
reality.
Arizona shattered that thought in the
top of the ninth when designated hitter
Randy Roeder ripped a two-out double to
left field that scored Scott Stanley from
third and Brad Mills from second.

series since 1976 in the final game of the
weekend.
More importantly, Sunday's 8-6 loss to
the visiting Wildcats dashed the Cardinals'
hopes of being only one game out of sec
ond place in the Pacific-IO Conference's
Southern Division. Instead Stanford
dropped to fifth in the league standings
with a 9-12 record.
Meanwhile, UCLA claimed a three-game
set from Arizona State over the weekend
to extend its Pac-10 record to 16-5. Califor
nia lost two out of three games to USC, but
held onto second place with an 11-10
mark.
Arizona and USC are now tied for third
with 10-11 records and Arizona State
brings up the rear with a 6-15 mark.
The team placing second in the South
ern Division will play off with the Pac-10
Northern Division champion to determine
the second conference representative in
the 1979 NCAA baseball tournament.
The Cards have only nine games of
league play remaining in the '79 season,
and five of the nine are away. The three
game series against the Trojans at USC this
coming weekend will be critical.
But in what better form could the Cards

head for Los Angeles than coming off their
best offensive series of the year?
Stanford scored a total of 32 runs on 41
hits, including eight home runs by seven
different batters, in the series against
Arizona. If the Cardinal bats don't cool by
Thursday, the series against USC is going
to be something to watch.

Stanford dominated the first two games
of the series this past weekend, but the
Sundav contest was a see-saw affair.
The Wildcats jumped into the lead in the
top of the second inning scoring once off
starter Brian Harrison. In the third, a walk,
two singles and a misplayed routine fly ball
added three more runs to their score.
Stanford retaliated in the bottom of the
third with two runs on a single by Loring
Davies, a double by Larry Reynolds and a
two-RBI grounder to the left side by Phil
Wilson.
After scrapping for another run in the
bottom of the fourth, Davies — who went
two-for-four on the day — knotted the
score at 5-5 with one swing of the bat and
teammate Mike Toothman on first.
Larry Kuhn, who came on in relief of
Harrison in the top of the fifth, then

worked two easy innings against the
Wildcats. When the Cards scored once in
the eighth on an error by the Cats third
baseman it looked like a sweep could be a
reality.
Arizona shattered that thought in the
top of the ninth when designated hitter
Randy Roeder ripped a two-out double to
left field that scored Scott Stanley from
third and Brad Mills from second.

MIKE TOOTHMAN, here taking a cut in early-season action, was part of the Stanford offensive barrage
that scored 32 runs in three weekend games against Arizona. The Cardinals took the first two contests,
but lost the third that would have put them within striking distance of second place in the Pac-10
Southern Division.
After clobbering Arizona 13-7 Friday af
