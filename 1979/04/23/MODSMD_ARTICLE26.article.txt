# USC tips women netters, 5-4
## 
### Steve Pearson 
If you have any fingernails
left, you probably weren't at
the Stanford tennis courts last
Friday afternoon. If you were,
however, you saw the Cardinal
women's tennis team pour
every ounce of effort they had
into one of the most thrilling
Stanford-USC contests ever.
USC's women's team defeated
the Cardinals 5-4, but it was
much more than that.
The Trojans came to Stan
ford undefeated and ranked
No. 1 in the nation, with previ
ous victories over Stanford and
UCLA. Led by Stacy Margolin,
the top-ranked woman
amateur player in the world,
USC was favored to defeat
Stanford again last Friday.
But as the first three singles
matches began to unfold, both
the crowd and the players
themselves knew it was going
to be very, very close.
Stanford's No. 1 player,
Kathy )ordan, played like the
professional she will soon bein
defeating Margolin 6-3, 7-5.
Margolin's left thigh was
heavily wrapped due to a pul
led hamstring, but that had lit
tle to do with the result of the
match. Jordan ran her from
side to side, often coming in on
a short return and volleying for
winners.
Jordan had lost a tough
match to Margolin just two
weeks ago in Los Angeles. Her
evident joy in this win was ex
pressed at one point in the
second set when, after crunch
ing a winning volley, she broke
her usually intensely concen
trated tace with a big, happy
smile.
After the match )ordan said,
"I think the difference today
was that I served and volleyed a
lot better than the last time I
played Stacy. She may not have

had her normal reach today
because of her leg, but she
sure did get most of my drop
shots."
The rest of the singles
matches did not go as well for
Stanford. With the team score
4-1 and USC one point from as
sured victory, the No. 2 singles
match between Stanford's
Alycia Moulton and USC's
Anna-Maria Fernandez be
came the focus of attention.
Moulton, playing brilliantly,
had easily won the first set 6-3,
but Fernandez came back to
take the second at 6-4. The
third set was extremely close;
tension mounted as the crowd
began to cheer each point.
With each player making

great shots under pressure, the
set went into a nine-point tie
breaker at 6-6 in the third set to
determine the winner.
Each point was crucial.
Moulton went ahead 4-3, giv
ing her double match point
against Fernandez. But Fer
nandez responded by winning
the next point with a powerful
return of serve.
There was absolute silence
as Moulton prepared to serve
the final point of the match.
After she made a clutch second
serve, the point evolved into a
long rally; both players then
moved into the net. Fernandez
appeared to have an easy shot
down the line to win. But her
passing shot caromed off the

top of the net, giving Moulton
time to move over and volley
the ball for a winner that gave
her the match of her life, and
Stanford a fighting chance at
2-4.
The crowd gave both players
a standing ovation while
friends of Moulton popped the
cork on a bottle of champagne
they had brought for just this
occasion.
After the match Moulton
said, "I really didn't know that
if I had lost USC would have
clinched the match. I was {ust
thinking about every single
point. I'm not sure whether it
showed or not, but I was in
credibly nervous out there."
Moulton's victory meant that
if the Cardinals could win all
three doubles matches, the
team match would be theirs.
And as the doubles began, it
looked as if they might do it.
Stanford's teams of )ordan-
Moulton, Hagey-Diane Morri
son and Donna Rubin-Hertel
all won the first set against their
opponents. Hagey and Morri
son, in the No. 2 position,
finished first with a well-played
7-6, 6-4 victory.
But then Rubin and Hertel
were defeated in a tough
three-set match by Trey Lewis
and Anna-Lucia Fernandez,
4-6,6-1,6-2. It was all over. USC
had its fifth team point, and
even though Jordan and Moul
ton won their match 7-6, 6-4,
USC ended up defeating Stan
ford.
