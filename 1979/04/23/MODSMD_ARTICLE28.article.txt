## Men outlast Cal again 
### Jeff Brandon 
The Stanford men's tennis
team stayed atop the Pacific-10
Conference standings with a
5-4 victory over California
Saturday.
The triumph improved the
Cardinals' record to 5-1 in
league play and 11-3 overall.
The outcome also served to vir
tually eliminate the Bears,
sporting their best team in re
cent years, from any chance of
a shot at the conference title.
Although the Bears are 11-4
outside the conference, their
league record is but 2-4, which
says something forthe league's
strength. In fact, four of the na
tion's top eight teams compete
in the Pac-10.
Yet this fact was little conso
lation to the Bears, who this
year felt that they had their best
chance at beating Stanford.
Peter Rennert and Scott
Bondurant continued to be the
Cards' steadiest performers.
Despite a slow start, Rennert
settled down and bested Larry
Stefanki 6-7, 7-6, 6-3. Rennert
took advantage of Stefanki's
weak torehand service return
to turn the match around,
crowding Stefanki with his
left-handed service.
Bondurant went into Satur
day's match with remnants of
the flu, a sore shoulder and a

touch of nervousness. Despite
these hindrances his angled
volleys kept slow Yair Werth
eimer running all day, 6-4, 7-6.
However, that was the extent
of Bondurant's good fortune.
While chasing a ball in dou
bles, Bondurant cut his hand
on the wall and his play from
that point on was hampered.
John Corse, subbing for in
jured Jim Hodges, got his first
start in Pac-10 action and took
advantage of this chance to de
feat Doyg Lancaster in three
sets 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
Earlier this year Lancaster
was a quarter-finalist at the
Northern California Intercol
legiate tournament, defeating
Stanford's Lloyd Bourne in the
process.
Corse, however, matched
up verv well with Lancaster.
Lobbing skillfully throughout
the match, the Georgia
backcourter simply wore Lan
caster down with his clay-court
style of tennis.
With the score tied three-all
after the singles, the match
again came down to the dou
bles for the third time in the
last five occasions.
Once again the Cards were
equal to the test, as the top
doubles team of Rennert-
Bourne took care of business
again, defeating the estab

lished team of Davis and Dunk
in a pair of tie-breakers for a
7-6, 7-6 win.
However, coach Dick Gould
does not yet feel that he's
found the magic at second and
third doubles. Because of this
he broke up the team of
Hodges and Jeff Arons, who
were on a three-match winning
streak.
Hodges, who skipped the
singles because his pulled
hamstring muscle had not fully
recovered, teamed up with
Bondurant only to lose 6-7,6-2,
6-4.
However, the freshman
team of Arons and Tim Mayotte
pulled through in three sets
3-6, 6-3, 6-3.
The Cards' next match is not
until May 4. But they will not be
idle, as they travel to Ojai this
Wednesday for the Pac-10
tournament which will include
co-leaders USC and UCLA.
