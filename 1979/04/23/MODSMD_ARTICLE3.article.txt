# Med-Center discusses spiraling costs, funding

A new group has been formed to
formulate long range plans for the
future development of the Medical
Center unde r the leadership of Dr.
Lawrence Crowley, acting vice presi
dent and medical dean.
The group is to devise options for
the Medical Center "in light of
emerging economic and social pres
sures, changing health care delivery
systems at national, state and reg
ional levels and alternating goals,
sources and mechanisms for financ
ing of medical education and bio
medical science," Crowley said.
Because the pressures facing the
Med Center are primarily economic,
i.e., inflation and the spiraling costs
of medical technology, the general
ideas discussed by the group so far
have emphasized increasing the effi
cency of the Medical Center to save
costs, according to Crowley.
Methods of achieving greater effi
ciency will probably include con
solidating plans, cutbacks in margi
nal areas, and generating greater re
venue through qualitative improve
ments in patient care, he said.
Additional economic pressure
stems from recent federal cutbacks
in funding.
"This year's level of capitation
(federal funding of medical school
education) was reduced by the Car
ter administration from $1100 to $700
per student, approximately, and they
will probably not renew the legisla

tion next year that would allow ex
tension of capitation," according to
Crowley.
Federal funding in the form of
grants for medical research is also
levelling off after relatively steep in
creases in the early 70s, he said. But
the University will continue to re
ceive a considerable share of federal
funds for basic research, approxi
mately $25 million annually, Crowley
estimated.
There is no direct way to compen
sate for cutbacks in federal funding,
but the group hopes that greater
overall operating efficiency will gen
erate greater revenue and make up
forany decrease that results, he said.
Other means of generating greater
revenue include increasing Medical
School tuition, Crowley said.
Additional pressure for change
comes from the state and federal
government who have demanded
that the Medical Center redesign
portions of the physical plant that are
not in compliance with new ear
thquake and safety codes, according
to Crowley.
The Med Center is in the process
of responding to these new require
ments and is drawing up plans that
include the enlargement of some
rooms and the upgrading of func
tionally inadequate parts of the Med
ical Center, he said.
The Medical Center faces the loss
of its accreditation if it does not
comply with these federal regula
tions.
