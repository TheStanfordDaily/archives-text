# Card spikers finish

### Peter Finch 
It was a tough way to end the season — play
ing Loyola Marymount and USC in one weekend
_ but the Stanford men's volleyball team man
aged to get themselves one win, anyway. That
victory, the Cards' second of the season in
California Intercollegiate Volleyball Association
play, came Friday night against Loyola at Maples
Pavilion.
Playing without the help of Kip Engen, its
standout freshman setter, Stanford lost the first
game to Loyola 15-8. Despite fine front-line play
by the Cardinals' jack Foxworth and Frank An
derson, Loyola's own front line was able to hold
its own, making many healthy blocks and com
miting few errors.
In the second game, Stanford jumped out to
an early 9-2 lead, but saw that advantage nearly
fade away as Loyola pulled within three at 10-7.
Foxworth, Anderson and Dave Saeta came up
with some timely blocks, though, and Stanford
was able to even the match with a 15-9 victory.
Game three was basically all Stanford's, but
some mid-game errors made it fairly close, as
the Cards won 15-9.
A somewhat revived Loyola team took the
court at the beginning of the fourth frame.
Showing good pursuit in the back court, the
visitors kept the game close throughout.
With Stanford leading 12-11 and obviously
gaining momentum, Loyola was able to force a
sideout. They scored one point and turned the
ball back over to the Cards, who were also able

to tally only once.
Each team traded side-outs until Stanford was
finally able to score two points back-to-back,
take the game 15-13 and the match three games
to one.
Unfortunately for the Cards, things were dif
ferent Saturday night when the ever-strong Tro
jans invaded Maples.
Engen, playing with a cold, was back for the
Cards, and with his help Stanford was able to
stay very close to the Trojans in the first game. A
late USC surge, however, took the game out of
the Cards' grasp and the Trojans won it 15-11.
The men from Southern California had mat
ters more in hand in the second game. Despite
another good game at the net from Foxworth
and company, Stanford lost again, this time 15-6.
Graciously, USC put in for the third game
what amounted to their second team — also a
strong unit — and the Trojans jumped out to a
quick early lead.
The Cards came back to tie it at 7-7, take the
lead themselves and win the game 15-13 on a big
spike off the hand of Rich Yardley.
Not about to be beaten, a rested and anxious
USC first team was ushered back onto the court,
whereupon they proceeded to roll all over a
rather discouraged Stanford squad. The final
score was 15-2, USC.
And that is the way a very tough season ended
for a new team in one of the best leagues
around. The Cards closed 1979 with a 5-15 over
all record, 2-15 in CIVA.
