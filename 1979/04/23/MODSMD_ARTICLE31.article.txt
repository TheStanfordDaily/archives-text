# Depth wins for hooters
## 
### Dean Eyre 
The rest of America may very
well be learning the symptoms
of The China Syndrome, but
Stanford's women soccer
players are having to cope with
a malady of their own.
Rather than referring to a
large outburst of energy, the
Cardinal contagion, dubbed
the "Kris McCarrey Syn
drome" by coach Phil Wright,
has to do with a lack of energy,
a "meltdown" of players due to
injuries.
Fortunately, the Cards have a
backup system to deal with the
situation — a lineup with
depth, which came through
most recently for a pair of wins
over the University of the
Pacific and Cal State-Hayward
this weekend.
One of last year's frosh
phenoms, McCarrey was
sidelined from her forward
spot after suffering an injury
during the Westmont Tourna
ment two weekends ago. Un
dergoing surgery for a dislo
cated kneecap, she is out for
the rest of the season.
It seems the power of
suggestion was too strong as
injuries spread in epidemic
proportions, most noticeably
affecting fullback Maria
Duryea and midfielder Pauline
McNamara, both forced out of
yesterday's match against
Hayward.
"The nicest thing about yes
terday (Saturday) was being
able to play 18 players," Wright

said. "Not only was it nice for
me to be able to give them the
playing time, but they played
well, which gave me a lot more
faith in the depth that we have.
That was a real relief to me at
this time in the season when
we're having injuries galore."
In Saturday's game, the
Cards had a slow start but
finished strong, beating the
host Tigers 8-0. Cindy Shorney
and Ellen Criep both tallied hat
tricks and Nancy Geisse and
Ronnie Vella each added a
goal.
Criep assisted Shorney's first
goal and the second went un
assisted. Kathy Kelley's corner
kick set up Griep's first score
and Shorney struck again to
give the Cards a 4-0 halftime
lead.
Scores by Geisse and Vella
plus Griep's pair of goals in the
•.econd period of play wrapped
up the game's scoring.
Stanford took a 1-0 lead at
halftime yesterday against
Hayward on a goal by Shorney
with an assist by Griep. In the
second half Vella added a goal,
julie Zender scored her second
goal of the season and Criep
put in her second goal of the
match from 10 yards out with
two fullbacks on her for a 5-0
victory over the visitors.
Again a lackluster showing
stifled the Stanford offense
early in the game, but the
psychological effect of the ini
tial goal seemed to correct
that.

The Cards now sport a per
fect 6-0 record in league play,
ahead of Cal State-Chico and
California which tied in second
at 4-1-1. Stanford travels to
Marin to face Chico Friday at
3:30 p.m.
