Part of the women's track
team competed in a "different
kind of meet experience," ac
cording to coach Laurel Treon.
Saturday the Cards traveled to
the dirt track at UC-Davis for a
large men's and women's relay
meet.
The Cardinals fielded par
ticipants in five of the seven
women's events offered.
Only senior Ann Thrupp
placed for the Cards by finish
ing fifth in the open two-mile
with a time of 11:20.6.
Freshman Kathy Hildebrand
high-jumped her season best
and set a new school record.
Her 5-feet-0 showing con
tinued her "steady improve
ment," Treon said.
Susan Bragdon, another
freshman, ran the open 1500-
meters for the first time in sev
eral weeks since she was ham
pered by a leg injury.
Bragdon's time of 5:01.5 was
over 10 seconds off her season
best, "but it was good to see
her back on the track," Treon
stressed.
"Our two-mile relay team
was fair in terms of the compet
ition," Treon said, but it im

proved tremendously. Joanne
Ernst, Peggy Guyer, Carolyn
Layzer and Meg Gardiner
dropped their previously fas
test time from 10:44 to 10:26.5.
The 1600-meter relay squad
of Gardiner, Hilary Hall, Bente
Lur.dh and Andrea Cheek
chopped off 1.5 seconds from
their best time to record a
4:18.5. The Cards also entered
a 400-meter relay.
Terming the meet, "some
what like a three-ring circus
with so many men's and wo
men's events," Treon con
tinued that "I hope that next
year we host a big quality meet
like that."
Next weekend the entire
team will leap the bay for a
five-way meet at Cal State-
Hayward. The Cards will run
with teams from California,
UC-Davis, Humboldt State and
Hayward.
The meet will be non-scoring
to allow the competitors to
concentrate on events for the
attainment of national qualify
ing standards, rather than
spreading out team depth to
amass points, according to
Treon. The competition will
begin at 11 Saturday morning.
