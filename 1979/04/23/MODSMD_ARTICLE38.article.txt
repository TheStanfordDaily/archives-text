PLO guerrillas kill four Israelis
Nahariya, Israel — Four Israelis, including two
little girls, were killed early yesterday when Pales
tinian guerrillas launched a pre-dawn raid from the
seaand shot theirway intoan apartment building.
One of the four terrorists was shot and killed by
a civilian as the attackers attempted to break into
the apartments. A second was killed by Israeli sec
urity forces as the guerrillas attempted to flee on
the beach and two others were wounded and cap
tured, the army said.
Meanwhile, military officials announced that Is
raeli naval boats shelled a guerrilla training camp
yesterday belonging to the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine at Nahr El-Berd, north of
Tripoli.
Palestinian spokesmen in Beirut, however, said
the Israelis shelled a refugee camp in the area.
Informed sources in Beirut said three persons died
in the shelling.
In Beirut, the Palestine Liberation Front, an
Iraqi-backed faction of Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization, claimed responsibility
for the attack in this coastal town of 25,000, about
five miles south of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
The attack claimed more lives than any terrorist
attack this year and was the seventh border penet
ration or attempt by raiders who have vowed to
sabotage the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
Last Amin stronghold, Jinja, falls
Jinja, Uganda —Tanzanian troopscaptured Jinja,
Uganda's second city and the last stronghold for
troops loyal to Idi Amin, before dawn yesterday.
Thousands of residents threw flowers and
shouted, "We are free, we are free." There was
only minor resistance by a few hundred of the
deposed Amin's soldiers.
The Tanzanian force also took control of the vital
Owen Falls hydroelectric dam, which supplies all
of Uganda'selectricity and 15 percent of the power
used in neighboring Kenya.
Tanzanian Brig. Gen. Marwe Kambale, whose
brigade led the attack on Jinja, toured the town
wearing a pair of Western-style .45 caliber six
shooters strapped to his waist.
The Tanzanian forces said there was no sign of
Amin, who was last reported in north-western
Uganda near his hometown of Arua from where he
could easily flee to neighboring Sudan or Zaire.
Cambodians flee into Thailand
Bangkok, Thailand — Nearly 50,000 Cambodians,
including thousands of soldiers of the toppled re
gime of Pol Pot, streamed into Thailand over the

weekend in the face of an all-out drive by tank
supported Vietnamese forces in Western Cam
bodia, Thai border authorities said yesterday.
The Cambodians, coming in three large waves
along a six-mile stretch of the border, trekked
southward along the frontier inside Thailand, ap
parently intent on re-entering their homeland at a
safer location, Thai district officials said.
The exodus appeared to back the beliefs of
some Indochina analysts here that forces loyal to
Pol Pot were taking a serious battering from the
Vietnamese and were being pushed south into the
rugged mountain areas.
Newsmen at the frontier said about 20,000 Cam
bodians, including an estimated 8000 soldiers, en
tered Thailand Saturday. These apparently were
forced to turn back but returned from Cambodia
yesterday and were followed by two other large
groups.
Severe spring floods continue
Fresh cloudbursts yesterday brought more re
cord flooding to southwest Texas and renewed
peril along Mississippi's Pearl River, while the Air
Force flew a million sandbags to the inundated
Red River Valley in the upper Midwest.
And at least four tornadoes touched down in
Louisiana, including a twister that demolished the
site of the Crawfish Festival midway in Chalmette
and injured two persons slightly.
Louisiana's torrential weather over the weekend
also claimed at least one life, a 6-year-old boy who
drowned in a rain-swollen Baton Rouge bayou.
Nuclear danger underestimated
Reading, Pa. — The president of the company
that operates the Three Mile Island nuclear power
plant says the firm was neither prepared for the
March 28 accident nor aware of its scope for two or
three days.
But Walter Creitz, president of Metropolitan
Edison Co., denied company spokesmen misled
the public and said the utility handled the situation
properly.
"We weren't lying. Dammit, we tried at all times
to tell the public as we saw it. The unfortunate
thing is, we didn't know the total extent of the
accident until several days later," he said.
"Here is something we didn't expect would
happen, but it did happen. We didn't know what
would happen next.
"From what I understood, the situation was
completely under control. It wasn't until two or
three days that we knew the scope of the acci
dent," Creitz said.

Unexpected emissions of radiation two days
after the initial accident prompted the evacuation
of pregnant women and pre-school children from
the immediate area surrounding the plant. The
same day, a hydrogen bubble was discovered in
the reactor core.
The bubble, a problem unimagined by desig
ners, was slowly drawn off and Friday, 24 days after
the accident, temperatures in the reactor finally
dropped below the boiling point.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy with chance of showers today.
Showers ending tonight. Fair Tuesday. Lows in
mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in 60s.

Iraqi-backed faction of Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization, claimed responsibility
for the attack in this coastal town of 25,000, about
five miles south of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
The attack claimed more lives than any terrorist
attack this year and was the seventh border penet
ration or attempt by raiders who have vowed to
sabotage the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
Last Amin stronghold, Jinja, falls
Jinja, Uganda —Tanzanian troopscaptured Jinja,
Uganda's second city and the last stronghold for
troops loyal to Idi Amin, before dawn yesterday.
Thousands of residents threw flowers and
shouted, "We are free, we are free." There was
only minor resistance by a few hundred of the
deposed Amin's soldiers.
The Tanzanian force also took control of the vital
Owen Falls hydroelectric dam, which supplies all
of Uganda'selectricity and 15 percent of the power
used in neighboring Kenya.
Tanzanian Brig. Gen. Marwe Kambale, whose
brigade led the attack on Jinja, toured the town
wearing a pair of Western-style .45 caliber six
shooters strapped to his waist.
The Tanzanian forces said there was no sign of
Amin, who was last reported in north-western
Uganda near his hometown of Arua from where he
could easily flee to neighboring Sudan or Zaire.
Cambodians flee into Thailand
Bangkok, Thailand — Nearly 50,000 Cambodians,
including thousands of soldiers of the toppled re
gime of Pol Pot, streamed into Thailand over the

weekend in the face of an all-out drive by tank
supported Vietnamese forces in Western Cam
bodia, Thai border authorities said yesterday.
The Cambodians, coming in three large waves
along a six-mile stretch of the border, trekked
southward along the frontier inside Thailand, ap
parently intent on re-entering their homeland at a
safer location, Thai district officials said.
The exodus appeared to back the beliefs of
some Indochina analysts here that forces loyal to
Pol Pot were taking a serious battering from the
Vietnamese and were being pushed south into the
rugged mountain areas.
Newsmen at the frontier said about 20,000 Cam
bodians, including an estimated 8000 soldiers, en
tered Thailand Saturday. These apparently were
forced to turn back but returned from Cambodia
yesterday and were followed by two other large
groups.
Severe spring floods continue
Fresh cloudbursts yesterday brought more re
cord flooding to southwest Texas and renewed
peril along Mississippi's Pearl River, while the Air
Force flew a million sandbags to the inundated
Red River Valley in the upper Midwest.
And at least four tornadoes touched down in
Louisiana, including a twister that demolished the
site of the Crawfish Festival midway in Chalmette
and injured two persons slightly.
Louisiana's torrential weather over the weekend
also claimed at least one life, a 6-year-old boy who
drowned in a rain-swollen Baton Rouge bayou.
Nuclear danger underestimated
Reading, Pa. — The president of the company
that operates the Three Mile Island nuclear power
plant says the firm was neither prepared for the
March 28 accident nor aware of its scope for two or
three days.
But Walter Creitz, president of Metropolitan
Edison Co., denied company spokesmen misled
the public and said the utility handled the situation
properly.
"We weren't lying. Dammit, we tried at all times
to tell the public as we saw it. The unfortunate
thing is, we didn't know the total extent of the
accident until several days later," he said.
"Here is something we didn't expect would
happen, but it did happen. We didn't know what
would happen next.
"From what I understood, the situation was
completely under control. It wasn't until two or
three days that we knew the scope of the acci
dent," Creitz said.

Unexpected emissions of radiation two days
after the initial accident prompted the evacuation
of pregnant women and pre-school children from
the immediate area surrounding the plant. The
same day, a hydrogen bubble was discovered in
the reactor core.
The bubble, a problem unimagined by desig
ners, was slowly drawn off and Friday, 24 days after
the accident, temperatures in the reactor finally
dropped below the boiling point.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy with chance of showers today.
Showers ending tonight. Fair Tuesday. Lows in
mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in 60s.
PLO guerrillas kill four Israelis
Nahariya, Israel — Four Israelis, including two
little girls, were killed early yesterday when Pales
tinian guerrillas launched a pre-dawn raid from the
seaand shot theirway intoan apartment building.
One of the four terrorists was shot and killed by
a civilian as the attackers attempted to break into
the apartments. A second was killed by Israeli sec
urity forces as the guerrillas attempted to flee on
the beach and two others were wounded and cap
tured, the army said.
Meanwhile, military officials announced that Is
raeli naval boats shelled a guerrilla training camp
yesterday belonging to the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine at Nahr El-Berd, north of
Tripoli.
Palestinian spokesmen in Beirut, however, said
the Israelis shelled a refugee camp in the area.

in the shelling.
