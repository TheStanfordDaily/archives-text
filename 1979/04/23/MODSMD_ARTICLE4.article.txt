# Election procedures disputed

Allegations questioning the propriety of the proce
dures followed in last week's ASSU election and certain
actions taken by the Elections Commission have been
made by members of the various senior class presidents
slates.
The controversy centers on the race for senior class
presidents, where the slate of Gray Boyce, Alan Alpert,
Sandra Shanker and Dave Hood leads the slate of Mike
Kavoukjian, Connie Ordway, Jeff Merrill and Janet Rap
paport by a vote of 195 to 181. Final results will not be
available until ballots from the overseas campuses ar
rive.
Chief among the criticisms is the manner in which
eligibility to vote for senior class candidates was proven
at the polls. Several alleged electioneering violations of
the ASSU Constitution and its bylaws, the delay in the
arrival of the overseas ballots, the format of the original
ballot and the failure to notify senior class slates of the
status of a run-off election have also concerned mem
bers of several slates.
Poll watchers checked student identification for
"0176" in the student number to determine junior stand
ing and, hence, qualification to vote for a slate of senior
class presidents.
Kavoukjian of the Natural Choice slate pointed out
that those students who entered the University autumn
quarter 1976 might not necessarily have completed the
requisite number of units (130 by next autumn) to legiti
mately have senior class voting rights.
Students with Advanced Placement credit or extra un
its, who are graduating this year after three years of
study, would also have been able to vote.
Although computerized sheets have been used in the
past for senior class elections, they were not used last
year, according to Assistant Elections Commissioner

Chris Noonan.
"We looked at last year's rules" and decided to check
IDs this year, Elections Commissioner Dayna Goldfine
said. For the run-off election, "we will somehow find a
computer sheet," she said. "I didn't know how to get it
(the computerized list), but I feel confident that not
many (ineligible votes) happened."
Responding to claims that some of the pollwatchers
"didn't know what they were doing," Goldfine said, "I
can't be responsible for every single vote. There is just
no way to watch over 20 people."
Only seven pollwatchers attended a training session
the Monday before the election, which had been adver
tised in the Daily and at the location of the sign-up lists.
"There is only so much a person can do, and, after that, it
depends on other people," Goldfine insisted.
The bylaws of the ASSU Constitution stipulate that
"No electioneering materials are to be posted on or
distributed in the Post Office, the Bookstore, Tresidder
Union or any classroom." Electioneering is also forbid
den within 100 feet of the polls on election days.
Candidate slates were informed of those rules among
others in an elections pamphlet and at an informational
meeting prior to the election, and were required to sign
a statement, confirming their awareness and under
standing of them.
Before the meeting, the BASH slate posted leaflets in
the History Dept. After ASSU Co-President Andrew Gol
denkranz affirmed at the meeting that "classroom" had
traditionally referred to "all of the Quad," Goldfine in
structed the slate to remove the offending materials, but
the posters were not taken down for another two days,
according to another slate.
The ASSU Constitution states that such inaction could
constitute grounds for disqualification of the slate by the
senate. Goldfine said that she would not disqualify the
