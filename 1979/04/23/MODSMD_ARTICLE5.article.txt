# Letters, petitions challenge closing of Via Crespi-Sequoia Lane traffic loop

### Liz Schermer 
Recent closure of the Via Crespi-Sequoia
lane service loop to traffic has caused Univer
sity employees affected by the change to send
angry letters and petitions to the Department of
Facilities, Planning and Construction.
The loop, which circles the area between the
Varian, McCullough and Durand Buildings and
the Hansen labs, was closed in early March.
According to Director of Planning Phil Wil
liams, the designation of the loop for service
vehicles rather than through traffic "has been
delineated on the University's circulation plan
for over a decade as a means to improve safety
and to eliminate an abused short cut across
campus."
In response to a letter from 24 Center for
Materials Research (CMR) employees protest
ing the change, Williams said that although the
loop was not designated to be closed im
mediately, "the change was further accelerated
by calls from the Office of the Ombudsman."
Assistant to the Ombudsman Sara Stephen
son said that the main complaint was that driv
ers ignored stop signs and "traffic went
through there so fast it was dangerous for
people walking.
Stephenson added that when she notified
the planning department, they decided to go
ahead and close the loop immediately since
such a move was already in the master plan.
It is the speed with which the closure took
place that is one of the main complaints of the
employees affected. "No one knew the bloc
kage was going to happen," said Dennis Elwell,

a senior research associate at CMR and author
of the protest letter. "It was just presented as a
fait accompli."
The employees' main complaint, however,
concerns the detours they must now make — as
much as a half-mile — in order to get to work,
detours they estimate will cost the University
$100,000 in lost working time, according to El
well.
Ray Girouard, assistant director of CMR, said
"it's a more general problem than just the clos
ing of the streets around here. This whole
quadrant of the campus has no reasonable form
of automobile access."
"The closing of Via Crespi is just a symptom
of a larger problem," Girouard said, because of
the inadequate and diminishing numbers of
parking spaces in that area due to the "tre
mendous amount of construction."
According to Williams, other alternatives —
such as speed bumps — to the closure were
considered at a Jan. 3 meeting between af
fected employees and the Planning Office, but
were deemed insufficient.
"Speed bumps are dangerous and they leave
you (the University) legally liable for acci
dents," he said. Bumps also create danger
spots for bicyclists and for vehicles carrying
fragile and volatile equipment, he said.
The Planning Office also carried out a pre
liminary study of the feasibility of the closure
and the creation of a two-way loop as a result of
that meeting, but complaints from the Om
budsman's office "prompted the hasty clo
sure," according to Marshall O'Neill, associate

director of Hansen Laboratories.
Although the Hansen labs were notified the
day before installation of the posts occured,
neither the CMR or the School of Engineering
was contacted, according to representatives
from those departments.
O'Neill said his major concern about the
blockage of the loop was that employees and
service vehicles would be able to travel back
and forth between the two sections of the lab.
"I haven't had any complaints from our
people about getting back and forth," he said,
but complaints have been received from
employees who are inconvenienced by the
parking problems caused by the barriers.
Frank Jurian, assistant director of the De
partment of Public Safety, said "the change will
be evaluated after a period" to see if it should
remain closed. He noted the only problem oc
curring because of the closure is of "someone
tampering with the locks."
Associate Planner Steve Schmidt said that
similar closure will take place in other areas of
the campus. He said the objective is to "seal off
chronic places where people drive in and get in
the way of pedestrians, bicyclists and
emergency vehicles."
Bollards (those übiquitous white posts) will
be installed this year in front of the Biology
building as part of the reconstruction of Serra
St.and on Galvez in front of Green library.
Plans are also being considered for blocking
off Mayfield between Campus Drive and the
corner near 558 Mayfield when the Lomita
Drive extension is constructed.
