# Med School idea
## Committee suggests alternative to pass/fail 
### Seth Zuckerman 
In the latest development in the
continuing controversy over the re
commendations of the Medical
School's Cross Committee on Stu
dent Evaluation, the Med School Fa
culty Senate Friday adopted several
more of the committee's recom
mendations.
The committee was constituted in
response to a feeling among faculty
members that the current mandatory
pass/fail system was not fostering
and reinforcing student perfor
mance sufficiently.
The committee's suggestion that
"letters of marginal performance" be
sent to students who are not doing as
well as faculty think they should be
was enacted at the last faculty senate
meeting two weeks ago.
Students are willing to accept the
recommendations of the Cross
Committee, according to Alan
Carber, head of the Stanford Medical
Students Association, but they do
not want any other changes made in
the current system of grading at the
Med School.
Not far enough
On the other hand, many faculty
members think the committee did
not go far enough — they believe
that grades should be reinstituted
and honors conferred.
Carber said Faculty Senate action

would probably take effect only with
the class that would enter the Med
School in 1980, and emphasized that
it would not affect students who are
now enrolled.
The senate deferred action on a
committee proposal regarding let
ters of commendation until its next
meeting. An amendment had been
suggested to specify that tests should
not be the basis for letters of com
mendation, yet committee chairper
son Ruth Cross, professor of pediat
rics, noted that the committee be
lieves letters of commendation
should address outstanding perfor
mance beyond course requirements.
Adopted provisions
Adopted on Friday were:
— A provision ensuring that there
be means by students to receive
feedback on their performance and
achievements. The committee's re
commendation was amended to
clarify that essays, papers, laboratory
work, oral examinations and class
participation are all acceptable bases
for evaluation.
— A provision that no student may
drop a clinical clerkship without the
consent of the supervising faculty
member.
— A regulation that students must
pass any clerkships they previously
failed before they may graduate. (Ac-
cording to Garber, students object to
this regulation because this might
compromise the "electivity of the
curriculum" because students would
be more wary of taking clerkships
they might not pass.)
— A recommendation that the de
cision to send letters of marginal per
formance to students taking clinical
clerkships be made according to ob
jective standards. Students receiving
two or more such letters would come
before the Committee on Student
Performance. The committee could
then recommend against gradua
tion, recommend a course of reme
dial action, or do nothing.
— A rule that students must pass
each subset of the National Boards

medical exam at or above the third
percentile. This is a more rigorous
standard than is currently in force —
students must only pass the Boards
as a whole, not each individual sub
set.
Paul Basch, associate professor of
community and preventive medicine
read a statement adopted at a meet
ing of his department. The statement
decried the "Goldstein memo," an
open letter circulated at the Med
School last month criticizing the re
sults of current grading procedures.
The department's statement at
tacked the Goldstein memo for
being a "reason for acrimony" at the
Med School, as bitter exchanges be
tween students and faculty followed
the release of the memo.
Another proposal now being con
sidered would let each basic science
department at the Med School set its
own minimum requirements for a
student's progression to the clinical
portion of his or her medical educa
tion.
A medical student who requested
his name be withheld said he op
poses this recommendation because
he fears departments might require
courses that are poorly taught now
and not improve the quality of teach
ing in those courses.
