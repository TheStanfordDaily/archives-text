## Committee suggests alternative to pass/fail 
### Seth Zuckerman 
In the latest development in the
continuing controversy over the re
commendations of the Medical
School's Cross Committee on Stu
dent Evaluation, the Med School Fa
culty Senate Friday adopted several
more of the committee's recom
mendations.
The committee was constituted in
response to a feeling among faculty
members that the current mandatory
pass/fail system was not fostering
and reinforcing student perfor
mance sufficiently.
The committee's suggestion that
"letters of marginal performance" be
sent to students who are not doing as
well as faculty think they should be
was enacted at the last faculty senate
meeting two weeks ago.
Students are willing to accept the
recommendations of the Cross
Committee, according to Alan
Carber, head of the Stanford Medical
Students Association, but they do
not want any other changes made in
the current system of grading at the
Med School.
Not far enough
On the other hand, many faculty
members think the committee did
not go far enough — they believe
that grades should be reinstituted
and honors conferred.
Carber said Faculty Senate action

would probably take effect only with
the class that would enter the Med
School in 1980, and emphasized that
it would not affect students who are
now enrolled.
The senate deferred action on a
committee proposal regarding let
ters of commendation until its next
meeting. An amendment had been
suggested to specify that tests should
not be the basis for letters of com
mendation, yet committee chairper
son Ruth Cross, professor of pediat
rics, noted that the committee be
lieves letters of commendation
should address outstanding perfor
mance beyond course requirements.
Adopted provisions
Adopted on Friday were:
— A provision ensuring that there
be means by students to receive
feedback on their performance and
achievements. The committee's re
commendation was amended to
clarify that essays, papers, laboratory
work, oral examinations and class
participation are all acceptable bases
for evaluation.
— A provision that no student may
drop a clinical clerkship without the
consent of the supervising faculty
member.
— A regulation that students must
pass any clerkships they previously
failed before they may graduate. (Ac-
