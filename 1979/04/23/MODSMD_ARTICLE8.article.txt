# Paraplegic student leads active life
## 
### Greg Pierson 
Almost every morning be
fore school, Peter Axelson
rises and begins his day with a
swim work-out at deGuerre
pool. A fourth year co-terminal
student in mechanical en
gineering, Axelson is getting in
shape for a national swim meet
next month, in which he said
he hopes to capture a first
place.
Interesting? Perhaps not,
until one realizes that Axelson
is a paraplegic, paralyzed from
the waist down as the result of
a mountain climbing accident
he suffered four years ago.
As a cadet in the Air Force
Academy in Colorado, Axelson
said he and two friends were
scaling a mountain when the
lead climber slipped. The st
rain on the rope tying them to
gether caused an anchor piton
to give way and all three tum
bled down, resulting in one
death, one minor injury, and
Axelson crushing his vertebra.
"I was taken to the VA hospi

tal in Milwaukee where they
fused three vertebrae and
placed some supporting rods
in me," Axelson said.
But the accident hasn't stop
ped Axelson. He leads an ac
tive life, one that is more
energetic than many non
handicapped people. "Last
year I qualified for the National
Wheelchair Games in New
York and took second place in
the swimming competition,"
Axelson said.
At the end of last quarter,
Axelson said he flew to the Na
tional Handicapped Skiing
Championships in Colorado,
where he demonstrated a new
skiing apparatus for handicap
ped people called the "Ar
roya." "It's a fiberglass shell
surrounded by foam that I de
signed to make a new type of
skiing possible for the hand
icapped," Axelson explained.
"It's supported by runners and
the skier gets in and leans
whichever way he wants to
go.

"But the most interesting
part about the 'Arroya' is that
you can roll it." And roll it he
did, down a steep, mogul-filled
mountain in front of television
cameras
After being discharged from
the Air Force, Axelson said he
chose Stanford as his first
choice among engineering
schools. "I didn't really have a
concrete reason for going
here," he explained, "but I al
ways tell people the reason is
because Colorado is too cold,
and Berkeley is too hilly."
After arriving here, Axelson
said he was disappointed in the
facilities the University had to
accommodate handicapped
people. But in a short time, he
said the major obstacles for
him were overcome and he has
since been working with Uni
versity officials to help solve
some of the problems faced by
handicapped people.
Axelson said he has also
been working with other en
gineering students designing

and developing aids for the hand
icapped. "I come up with a lot
of ideas that would help
people, but I don't have the
time to work on all of them,"
he said, "so I have to get other
interested people to do it for
me."
Among his other activities,
Axelson said he enjoys photo
graphy and worked last year as
a photographer for the San
Francisco Ballet. This year he is
president of the Stanford
Photo Club. He is also taking
flying lessons with the help of a
hand-held device to steer the
rudder of the plane. He said he
has five more hours of flight
time until he can get his
license.
Axelson said he enjoys water
sports because water gives him
more freedom of movement.
"I like most water sports be
cause water is a neutral envi
ronment and I don't have to
depend on a wheelchair to get
around. There is no limitation
like there is on land."

Axelson said he also enjoys
sailing and has taken up the
sport with a friend. "We en
tered a regatta and will be sail
ing in it this May," he said.
With such an energetic life,
Axelson said he finds little time
to worry about the future and
his career goals. "At this point
in time the future looks pretty
vague, but I know I'm not in
terested in working for a big
company. I would rather be
somewhere where I can help
design and produce aids for
the handicapped. I want to
help people with what they can
accomplish in their own
lifetimes."
For Peter Axelson, life isn't
over as a result of his accident;
it has only taken a new direc
tion. "When I was rehabilitat
ing, I was told of all the things
that I wouldn't be able to do
anymore. But I've realized now
that you can do almost any
thing, if you want to badly
enough. It just takes someone
to try it first."
