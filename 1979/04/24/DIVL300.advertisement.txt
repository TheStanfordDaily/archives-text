Clarification
In yesterday's Daily an inadvertent
editing error in the election wrap-up
story resulted in the omission of an
important statement. The BASH slate
for the Senior Class President office
was not available for comment Mon
day and so were not quoted in the
story.
Yesterday, Alan Alpert, a member
of the slate, clarified the question
raised about the posting of campaign
leaflets in the Quad. According to
Alpert, BASH leaflets were posted in
the History Department before the
slates met with the Elections Com
missioners and the COP. At that
meeting, slates were informed by
COP member Andrew Goldenkranz
that no campaign material should be
posted in the Quad. The next day,
Alpert claimed, the BASH leaflets
were removed.
The Daily regrets any misun
derstanding that may have been
caused by the omission.
