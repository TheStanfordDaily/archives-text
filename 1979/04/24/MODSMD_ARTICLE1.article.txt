# Caldicott attacks nuclear industry

### David Frank 
Dr. Helen Caldicott, a leading cri
tic of nuclear power and nuclear
arms, attacked the nuclear industry
before a Fairchild Auditorium audi
ence of about 150 Friday night.
Caldicott, a Boston pediatrician,
talked extensively on the biological
dangers of nuclear substances, lash
ing out at the UC-Berkeley-affiliated
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, a
large research center for this coun
try's nuclear arms production.
She said the scientists at Livermore
"were so incensed when (President
jimmy) Carter said no to their neut
ron bomb" that they have since pres
sured him into a secret agreement to
go ahead on the weapon.
Livermore spokesman Jeff Garber
son denied Caldicott's assertion, say
ing "It isn't true. . . . Her facts are
just plain wrong."
Garberson said, "We don't have
the means to pressure the president.
He's the boss." Garberson added
that the president's decision last fall
only delayed construction of the
bomb, and that plans were advanced
by Carter to produce a nuclear
warhead without enhanced neutron
radiation capabilities.
Caldicott, whose opposition to the
nuclear industry helped pressure the
French government to stop testing
nuclear bombs in the South Pacific,
stressed public initiative as the
means of stopping the nuclear indus
try.
"We've got to educate ourselves
and our politicians and get out in the
streets and march. We have got to
march in Washington and go see the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and say, 'What
the hell do you think you're do
ing?' " Caldicott said.
In light of the recent accident at
the Three Mile Island nuclear power
plant in Harrisburg, Penn., Caldicott
addressed the medical consequ
ences of a meltdown. She said that
the radioactive substances released
into the air in a meltdown would
have had the contaminating effect of

"1000 Hiroshima bombs."
The fallout would have made the
area of Pennsylvania and some east
ern cities "so contaminated that no
one could have lived there for a long,
long time."
The fallout from a meltdown at the
Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant
near the San Andreas fault in San Luis
Obispo could contaminate the Bay
Area in the same way, she said.
Caldicott said that the scientists at
the Livermore lab (located 40 miles
east of the University), according to
Caldicott, are the most powerful
men in the world. When it comes to
the construction of nuclear bombs,
they "snap their fingers and Carter
and Congress listen."
Federal support
With the large amounts of tederal
money they receive, she said, "they
get rich at it (designing and building
nuclear bombs)."
If a nuclear disaster occurs, she
said, some believe "we'll die out like
the dinosaurs did. What they forget
is that unlike dinosaurs, we'll take
everything with us."
Caldicott gave a detailed descrip
tion of the hazards in each step of the
nuclear fuel cycle.
Cancer from uranium
When mining uranium, for exam
ple, radon gas is emitted. The radia
tion from this gas, she said, has
caused between 20 and 50 percent of
uranium miners to die from lung
cancer.
, Discarded uranium ore, known as
"tailings," is frequently left to lie
around. In Grand (unction, Colo.,
she noted that people who didn't
know the tailings were dangerous
used them to build homes, schools,
roads and a hospital. As a result,
babies there were born with a higher
than average incidence of birth de
fects.
Caldicott also noted that radioac
tive substances can leak out from the
power plants and enter the food
chain. In the pastureland around the
