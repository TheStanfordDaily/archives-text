## Don't ignore emotions in education 
### 
I look forward to small classes and dis
cussion sections in my daily academic
routine. At a university where most classes
are large and education is spoon-fed,
small-group discussions are challenging
and lively; their intimacy allows expres
sion which is unacceptable in a large lec
ture hall.
The freedom found in small groups has
its limits however. Try talking about feel
ings in Poli Sci section. I did. I still do. I'm
stubborn. Feelings are important to me,
inextricably linked with my academic life.
But no one takes me seriously. The con
tent of my speech is never given real con
sideration unless my tone of voice is cool,
analytical and unemotional.
We learn that thinking is a rational, or
derly, controlled activity. To study we
must focus and control our intellects. We
know from experience that feelings are
often irrational, chaotic and uncontrolled.
At a glance it seems impossible to integ
rate thinking and feeling into a workable
synthesis, into an academic approach. In
the face of a university and a culture stres
sing order and control, we subject our
feelings to our intellects and join the mas
ses in their worship of cerebral achieve
ment.
Faced with the choice between emo
tions and intellect, why do most of us

choose to de-emphasize our feelings?
One reason is that feelings cloud the
clarity we so desperately try to create as a
backdrop for our work. Feelings get in the
way. So we explain them away or store
them up to be released in sessions of
post-finals hysteria. We put our feelings
on hold until other lines are open.
In addition to the pragmatic difficulty of
integrating feelings into academic pur
suits, cultural factors influence our deci
sion to downplay our emotions. Societies
like ours become complex and advanced
largely through the accumulation of know
ledge.
The structure of culture is built upon the
base of nature. The ability to do that build
ing, to transcend and control that from
which we arose, is highly prized. Indeed,
the perpetuation of those cultural struc
tures has now become critical to our exis
tence. Intellect is viewed as a building
tool, and emotion, because of its unstable
character is a threat to the intellectual
structure. We learn that thinking is what is
important.
Capitalist culture, in its obsessive focus
on production, further lauds thought over
emotion. Production, not process is em
phasized and human mechanization
smooths out potential bumps in the road
to achieving that goal. Emotion is seen as

counterproductive in a society which is
hell-bent on producing, regardless of what
is being produced.
Human fear also helps discourage us
from expressing feelings. People fear vul
nerability. It is perhaps easier to bare our
academic souls because under scrutiny we
can hide behind rhetoric and reason,
whereas when we talk about our feelings
we have no such refuge.
We can explain our intellectual ideas.
We feel a security in explanations. But
often feelings cannot be explained, de
fended, reasoned or reconciled. In a place
expecting such explanations from us, we
prefer instead to freeze our feelings to
avoid the vulnerability caused by exposing
them.
What happens to us when we deny our
feelings? By responding to the demands of
culture and overprotecting ourselves, we
cheat ourselves out of feeling anything at
all. We slice out an entire dimension of our
lives. The mind and the heart together
comprehend a depth that separately they
cannot embrace. Such an integration is
difficult when aversive forces surround
us; yet to preserve our inherent human
richness we must forge that synthesis.
