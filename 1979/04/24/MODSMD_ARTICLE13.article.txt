## Nuclear energy choice by default 
### 
In our nuclear civil
engineering program, it takes
me three quarters of class work
in Civil Engineering 276 A, B
and C to work with our
graduate students, examining
the fundamentals of nuclear
energy, its role in the spectrum
of power generation options,
and its role in the spectrum of
environmental pollution. Al
though it is difficult to distill
the essence of these courses
into one column, a response to
the letter to the editor by Har
vey Rose and Amy Pinkerton
(Daily, April 9), is needed.
As a first aside, I would very
much like to welcome Rose
and Pinkerton to interact with
ourgroupin exploring the pros
and cons of nuclear energy.
We learn during the three
quarters that one doesn't "neg
lect to point out that other
energy sources — solar, wind
and conservation — are capa
ble of providing the same
amount of power and are far
safer." But we also learn that
"simple" solutions are not at
all simple, butare intricately in
terrelated between popula
tions, places, energy, envi
ronment and economics.
One also cannot neglect to
point out that such "factual"
statements as "nuclear power
provides only about 13 percent
of our electricity and electricity
provides 28 percent of U.S.

energy needs and therefore
only about 3.6 percent of our
country's energy is nuclear"
can be most misleading. One
should also not fail to consider
historic growth rates, current
trends, and best estimates of
"practical" limits in lifestyle
changes, and government reg
ulations that could occur over
the short and long hauls. All of
these factors make nuclear
energy a choice almost by de
fault.
One should also not fail to
point out in evaluating the "3.6
percent current nuclear" that
the best geothermal experts
predict that if all goes well for
geothermal energy develop
ment (technically, institution
ally and environmentally)
geothermal energy could pro
vide the nation with as much as
2 percent of its energy needs
by the year 2000. And yet there
is a large public demand, espe
cially in the 13 western states,
to go geothermal.
That 2 percent represents a
tremendous contribution to
the spectrum of energy re
sources available to the United
States. The same thing could
be said about conservation,
solar, wind, tidal, fusion, ad in
finitum. When and as these al
ternative forms of energy be
come available to the market
place they should be incorpo

rated into the economy as soon
as possible.
And yet, as long as the laws
of exponential growth are not
repealed, the total may still not
be sufficient for society's de
clared needs. I hope that Rose
and Pinkerton would not by
themselves decide what soci
ety needs in the way of energy.
I certainly don't want them de
ciding for me.
There was a question raised
on "How can Teller compare a
possible nuclear accident to an
airplane crash when . . .?"The
answer is that Teller, as well as
many others, can and does
make such comparisons by
technically evolving analytical
methods. They are not only
necessary but legally required
in comparing alternate
technologies for licensing.
And the conclusion that "it is
foolish to take such enormous
risks for only 3.6 percent of our
energy when other proven al
ternatives exist that are far
cheaper and safer" is a strong
but meaningless conclusion.
As the headline said, "Nuc
lear dangers are not exagger
ated." In fact, they may be un
derexaggerated! But before
one concludes with the words
"foolish," "enormous risks"
and "more expensive" for the
nuclear option, it behooves
one (and all) to understand the

magnitude of the risks, en
vironmental impacts, and po
tential consequences. These
should be compared to the
corresponding magnitudes re
sulting from not going nuclear,
so that the overall maximum
"good" for the whole popula
tion can be assessed by the
population.
I wish to repeat my state
ment in the April 4 article:
"One should not expect 100
percent safety." And I can be
chided for neglecting to point
out that even with less than 100
percent safety, as is observed
in all human activity, that alone
is not sufficient reason for "do
ing without."
