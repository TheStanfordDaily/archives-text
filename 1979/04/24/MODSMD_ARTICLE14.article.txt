## Genocide — never again 
### 
In his article "Armenians
remembered (Daily, April 4),
Michael Economides gave a
comprehensive presentation
of the Armenian situation as
well as the necessary
background foran understand
ing of the meaning of April 24th
to Armenians. It is a day to
commemorate the Vh million
Armenians massacred by the
Turks in 1915, an event which
has since become an "unre
membered genocide."
This year Armenians are
working to retain a single
paragraph in the United Na

tions study on genocide, a
piece of historical fact which
the Turkish government seeks
to erase. Paragraph 30 reads:
"Passing to the modern era,
one may note the existence of
relatively full documentation
dealing with the massacres of
the Armenians, which have
been described as the first case
of genocide in the twentieth
century." To retain this impor
tant piece of historical informa
tion is a pressing concern to
Armenians. It must be a moral
concern to all of us who heed
the advice that those who
forget the past are condemned

to repeat it.
Few crimes stand out so
drastically as the crime of
genocide — a crime which,
while directed against a par
ticular ethnic or national
group, is in fact a crime against
all mankind. It must be the
concern of all people to protest
moves by governments or
commissions to in any way
downplay the issue of mass
murder.
The possibility that we have
not learned from history is not
so far-fetched. For example,
the West German govern
ment's statute of limitations on
ihe prosecution of Nazi war
criminals is due to expire on
December 31, 1979. If it is al
lowed to expire, no Nazi war
criminals could be brought to
justice in Germany after De
cember 31. The principle of a
statute of limitations on
genocide would then be tacitly
accepted. If one can set a 30-
year statute of limitations, why
not 10, five or less? The princi
ple which must be established
and defended is that there can
be no time limit on bringing
perpetrators of genocide to
justice.
By the nature of their experi
ence, Armenians are sensitive
to issues concerning
genocide; after all, we have
suffered an "unremembered
genocide." A film on the
Armenian genocide will be
shown Ihis evening in Toyon
Hall.
There is no greater contribu
tion we can all make to future
generations, no greater tribute
to those people who have sur
vived the crimes of the twen
tieth century, than to make a
serious effort to learn from the
past and to commit ourselves
to the idea: "Never again."
