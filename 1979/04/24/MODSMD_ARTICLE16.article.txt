# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Staffers' perspective On criticism of the Daily 
### 
During the recent ASSU
election, the Daily came under
one of the most concerted at
tacks it has faced in a long time.
We feel it is unfortunate that
the recent criticisms of the
Daily addressed so many
peripheral issues when a
number of important criticisms
were only hinted at or left un
said.
The Daily was called inaccu
rate, erratic, superficial,
biased, arrogant. It was
charged that the Daily
cavalierly rejected fee assess
ments while not examining its
own.
We feel it is not surprising
that these charges were made.
Many of them have a basis in
fact.
Certainly the Daily aspires to
the same standards of accuracy
as any professional news
paper. Yet such a goal is unat
tainable, practically speaking,
with an overworked, under
paid, often-inexperienced staff
that is few in number and try
ing to go to school at the same
time it is trying to put out a
newspaper.
We feel that claims of objec
tivity are unrealistic, at best, as
well. Objective journalism, as
Hunter Thompson has ob
served, is a pompous con
tradiction in terms. It is possi
ble for the Daily to be fair (that
is, give both sides of the story)
in its coverage — which it often
is — but the term objective
applies not only to whether
both sides of an issue are ad
dressed in a news story but also
to such concerns as what is
considered news, how stories
are covered and who gets
space on the editorial page. As
Thompson also points out, the
only completely objective re

porting is done by closed
circuit TV cameras in depart
ment stores.
Yet the Daily leadership's
repeated pronouncements
about "accurate, objective"
reporting in Daily columns
simply perpetuate the belief
that the Daily staff really does
believe it puts out a profes
sional product.
But some ot ihe charges are
wildly untrue. We feel that the
people who totally condemn
the Daily are as mistaken as
those who blindly support it.
It's important to realize that
theDa//y is not a monolithic or
ganization with one mind and a
staff marching in goosestep. A
case in point is the Daily's own
fee assessment. The charge
that the Daily did not scrutinize
its assessment is wrong. Obvi
ously'our objectivity can be
questioned. But it is a fact that
the editorial board, a nine
member group composed of
the top editors and a number
of at-large staffers, spent more
time debating the Daily's fee
assessment than it did on any
other assessment. Some
members of the board argued
in favor ot endorsing the as
sessment; other members op
posed doing so. Debate was
heated. And, almost certainly,
some members of the editorial
board, as. well as the general
Daily staff, voted against the
assessment at election time.
Such disagreements are the
rule, not the exception, at the
Daily. Arguments are not re
served for editorial board
meetings. Should this story
run? How should the Daily re
spond to charges of sexism and
racism? Style versus substance.
Local versus national news.
And on and on.

The aforementioned lack of
staff leads to another major
problem at the Daily — dealing
with demands of expediency.
Events and circumstance, not
policy and premeditation, play
the largest role in determining
what the Daily looks like on any
given day.
For instance, many college
newspapers, including the
Daily, have been called to task
for their "lack of awareness" of
minority issues and concerns.
Part of the problem is that
awareness tends to disappear
in the face of deadlines and
staff shortages. That's no ex
cuse. But this is a problem that
will never completely disap
pear either.
This is a personal statement.
We do not believe that the
Daily is perfect. We also be
lieve that there is no reason to
expect it to be.
The people who work at the
Daily are all trying to do the
best job they can. But, in the
end, such sincerity provides no
justification for the Daily's
shortcomings. We welcome
continued criticism; change at
the Daily is impossible without
it. But criticism, to be effective,
must be based in truth. It'stoo
bad that much — though not all
— of the criticism leveled at the
Daily was insulting, not only to
the Daily staff, but to the elec
torate as well.
What we need is construc
tive criticism. We hope that
this letter will provide some in
sights that will allow for such
criticism in the future.
