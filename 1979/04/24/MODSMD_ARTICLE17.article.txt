# Senior Class President slates
## Natural platform BASH platform 
### 
Over the past several
months we've been busy
talking to University and
Alumni Association officials
and former class presidents
to find out about this job. As
a result, we'vecome upwith
many concrete and viable
plans to meet the needs of
next year's seniors.
Employment will be a
primary concern for most of
us next year. Our senior
alumni host program, which
organizes groups of seniors
to act as informal hosts at
pre-gamealumni "tailgater"
reunions, can provide im
portant job contacts.
For those planning to at
tend graduate school, fa
culty recommendations are
a necessity. We want to ex
pand the popular senior
faculty brunch program to
allow more seniors to meet
professors on a friendly, in
formal basis.
Because seniors also will
want to keep in touch with
friends after graduation, we
plan to publish a senior di
rectory, including future
plans of each senior. We'll

hold a class vote this spring
on commencement speak
ers so we can contact your
top choices before other
schools do.
The most immediate con
cern of seniors, however, is
having a damn good time
before graduating. With
new ideas like a jungle
party, fountain party at Tan
ner and class bus trip to the
wine country, added to old
stand-bys such as Zot's
happy hours and casino
night, even the most avid
partyers will be satisfied.
We also plan to expand
the traditional role of the
Senior Class Presidents to
promote senior involve
ment in the community.
We've put in a lot of work
to prepare for this job and
make it a fantastic senior
year. Please support our ef
forts and vote for us, "The
Natural Choice."

The scope of the Senior
Class Presidents' duties are
frequently misunderstood.
While we too would like to
emphasize social functions,
we feel our focus need not
be strictly social.
One major responsibility
is planningthe 1980 Gradu
ation Ceremony. We will dis
tribute a survey this spring
to solicit suggestions for a
commencement speaker, in
order to insure an early
commitment.
Another innovation is
SPECTRUM, a series of indi
vidual courses on topics not
usually found within the
academic cu r riculum. The
problem of an under
graduate education lacking
exposure to "life beyond
academics" could be par
tially remedied by special
seminars on tax instruction,
home repair, bartending or
skydiving.
In addition, we have ap
proached the staff at Bow
man Alumni House to dis
cuss faculty/alumni/student
interaction. An important
issue is easy access to

classmates' locations fol
lowing graduation, a pro
cess which is now confiden
tial and complex. We will
approach the administra
tion and attempt to elimi
nate the unnecessary red
tape to make such informa
tion accessible to the Class
of 1980 at any future time.
Our calendar of social
events will include a full
moon dance, a luau at the
beach and a field day, as
well as a Halloween BASH at
the mausoleum, Gatsby ,
Night and happy hours at
Zot's. The senior newslet
ter, alumni brunches,
weekly office hours, senior
discounts at local estab
lishments, and the year-end
flea market will also be con
tinued.
To organize an exciting
senior year we would ap
preciate your ideas and your
vote. BASH for Senior Class
Presidents.
