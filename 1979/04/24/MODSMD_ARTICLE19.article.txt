## rock/jim tranquada Thorogood and The Jam: rock 'n the Bay 
### 
Though much maligned and
misunderstood, the rise of the
punk movement in England
over two years ago signaled an
important shift in the direction
of rock music, a return to the
more basic and ofttimes rawer
musical forms of the early and
mid-'6os.
Punk enjoyed an ephemeral
burst of defiant popularity and
has since largely declined into
a mere fashionable affectation,
but the revival of the early rock
n' roll forms they embraced
and fostered has happily con
tinued.
Last weekend two of the
foremost representatives of
this revival — George
Thorogood and the |am —
played in the Bay Area. Despite
the great disparity in style and
direction — Thorogood is liter
ally a revivalist who plays clas
sic rhythm and blues more
than two decades old, while
the Jam combines a rawer form
of the melodic thunder of the
Who with stark contemporary
themes — both share the dis
tinction of being great rock n'
roll artists. Both offered reas
suring evidence that not only
the past but the future of rock
n' roll is in good hands.
Even before Thorogood's
final appearance in San Fran
cisco before the capacity
crowd in Bimbo's 165 Club had

begun Thursday night, the
mild-mannered, quiet-spoken
man across the table felt com
pelled to tell me why he had
seen Thorogood the week be
fore and practically every other
time he has appeared in the
Bay Area for the past two years.
Yet all he could manage was
a kind of awed incoherence as
he described Thorogood's vir
tuoso guitar-playing that chan
neled rhythm and blues of the
Chicago school through a un
erring rock n' roll sensitivity.
"I'm not interested in any
other kind of music," he said,
and tried to describe
thorogood's moves on stage
but was silenced by his wife
who listened to his outpour
ings with the patience of a mar
tyr.
Thorogood breeds this kind
of fanaticism. From the first
note of his opening number,
Bo Diddley's Ride On
Josephine, the audience was
up on its feet, standing on ta
bles and chairs for a clear view
of the stage.
Such a response is truly re
markable when one considers
that Thorogood and the De
stroyers (Jeff Simon on drums
and Billy Blough on bass) were
almost totally unknown 18
months ago.
The audience remained on
its leet tor the hour and a half
that Thorogood played a clas

sic sampler of the roots of rock,
trom the sizzling slide work on
Elmore James' New Hawaiian
Boogie to Bo Diddley's Who
Do You Love to Chuck Berry's
It Wasn't Me.
These songs are not mere
historical artifacts for
Ihorogood, to be treated with
a distant respect. His playing is
marked not only by a technical
brilliance but by a passion and
intensity that is tempered by a
joyful playfulness that makes
each song live anew.
The Jam — Paul Weller on
guitar, Bruce Foxton on bass,
and Rick Buckler on drums —
came out of the same London
scene that two years ago
spawned the Sex Pistols and
the Clash, seemingly as far re
moved from Thorogood's
traditionalism as you can get.
Yet fortunately with the de
cline of the punk movement
the underrated and un
heralded Jam can be ap
preciated for what they really
are: a great rock n' roll band.
Their inspiration has been
the British Mods of the early
'60s and the early Who — the
Mod band, a fact unknown to
most American fans — both in
their short hair and suits and
ties and in their powerful and
aggressive music.
In America the Jam has al
ways struggled with the punk
label. Yet American audiences
do not relate well to rock bands
in suits, nor do they easily re
concile the often political bent
of the Jam's songs with their
pop art persona.
The Jam's show Friday night
at the Oakland Auditorium

Theatre was a superlative one,
yet ultimately a frustrating de
monstration of the heights
they are capable of and the in
ability of American audiences
to relate to their music.
The Jam is a tight and discip
lined unit. Weller's slashing
guitar a la Townsend soared
over Foxton's melodic bass
lines and Buckler's explosive
drumming. The songs, dealing
with such themes as govern
ment repression, social disin
tegration, and urban prob
lems, came across with chal
lenging power and punch.
As the show unfolded, how
ever, it quickly became appa
rent that the audience had little
idea of what they were ex
periencing and the band had
little interest in enlightening or
reaching them.
Most of Weller's lyrics are
aimed at the bleak realities of
modern Britain. Like many of
his contemporaries, he feels
threatened by this reality,
which lends the jam's music a
compelling urgency that is felt
by their British audience.
For most of the audience in
Oakland Friday night however,
the most compelling political
reality seemed to be the cost of
concert tickets. They ap
preciated the volume and the
style of the music more than
the substance and the spirit.
The Jam seemed to be per
fectly cognizant of this lack of
empathy — indeed, seemed to
assume its existence from the
start — but made no attempt to
bridge the gap. The music was
powerful, but it lacked the
urgency and intensity to make
it come alive.
