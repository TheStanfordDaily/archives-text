## Urban streetlife with Desmond Child and Rouge 
### 
On their mini maiden tour of the West Coast,
Desmond Child and Rouge played the keystone
in Berkeley last week. The New York City band,
whose debut album has gained them notoriety
back East, features an unusual lineup of four
lead singers backed by six musicians. If the large
ensemble lacked space on Keystone's stage,
they still delivered a vibrant, colorful set.
Tall, blond Desmond Child is the band's
founder, composer and male lead singer. His
songs are limited in content to love and urban
streetlife (his composition "Night of Glory" is
on the soundtrack of the film Warriors), but they
cover a wide range of musical influences. Pun
chy rockers, funky dancing tunes, smooth R&B
songs and slow ballads were all included in their
performance. Some numbers, like "City in
Heat," had a festive Latin flavor, reflecting De
smond's Cuban background. Others, especially
"Main Man" recalled the work of '60s female
bands like the Supremes.
Desmond's light band met the challenge of
the diverse repertoire. With three (sometimes

four) guitarists, a keyboardist, drummer and
conga player, the group produced a dense, rich
sound. Some of their arrangements bordered
on the excessive, and they sounded best when
they controlled their potentially lethal power.
"Tumble in the Night," for example, was one of
the best, and simplest, songs of the evening. Its
fine guitar work highlighted the notable talents
of jimmy Smith.
Rouge consists of Diana Grasselli, Myriam
Valle and Maria Vidal. They provide the pro
vocative visuals and searing vocals which distin
guish the group. Besides harmonizing with De
smond, the women each had a chance to solo
and reveal their strong, emotive voices. Their
smiling exuberance was irresistable; their danc
ing and playfulness showed their high spirits.
With its unique make-up, Desmond Child and
Rouge combine elements of rock music with
cabaret theater. Their sophistication may derive
from New York, but their appeal should win
them a wider audience.
