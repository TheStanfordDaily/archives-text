## No disco, plenty of dance in Cole Porter's 1948 musical 
### 
It's spring at Stanford, and
with it comes the opening of
two exciting and promising
musical comedies on campus,
both of which fall under the
title of Ram's Head's spring
production, Kiss Me Kate.
This well-written and highly
entertaining Cole Porter show
is described as two shows sim
ply because that's what it is — a
show within a show, a theater
group in Baltimore that is per
forming a musical version of
Shakespeare's The Taming of
the Shrew. And this bizarre
blend of 1948 American theater
and musically upbeat Shakes
peare adds a variety and twist
seldom found in standard mus
ical theater.
The Ram's Head version,
which opens on April 25, prom
ises to bring to the stage all of
the entertainment and pizazz
that Porter wrote into the
show.
"I chose Kiss Me Kate be
cause, for a pre-Steven Son
dheim musical, it is the best
constructed show in terms of
plot and character," said co
director Kevin Cavanaugh.

"That, plus the interest in
doing almost two musicals, the
Shakespeare and the contem
porary, is very high."
The show takes place around
1948, which in itself has been a
challenging limitation to work
under, according to co
director Jeanie Barker.
"We originally did some
re-writing of the show to try
and update parts of it, make
them a little closer to today,"
Barker said. "But it just didn't
work. The modern expressions
didn't fit, so we left it the same.
We are doing it as a 1948 period
piece."
In order to make it work as a
1948 show, special rehearsals
were called in order to develop
not only the leads, but the
characters of the chorus as
well.
Even the Shakespeare parts
of the show are done with a
1948 perspective. It isn't pure
Shakespeare, but Shakespeare
re-written into a 1948 musical
to sell to the commercial audi
ences of the time. This gives it
an upbeat sense of life that
keeps the show moving at a

light and rapid pace.
Working in the 1948
framework has made choreog
raphing the show a challenge,
too. Choreographers Roberta
Sueda and Eric Ho t have run
into just about every kind of
dance style possible while
doing Kiss Me Kate.
"The show demands a wide
range of styles," Hoit said.
"There is ballet, jazz, tap and
even some of what we call
'nightclub' style dancing. It's
all in the script."
"By far the hardest part,"
Sueda said, "was keeping the
dancing in the period style.
Forties jazz is much different
than '70s jazz, for example. We
also had to keep any disco in
fluence out. No one danced
using their hips back then."
"We have tried to do things
as complex as possible within
the limits of the cast," Hoit ad
ded. "That has turned out to be
not much of a limitation."
The show itself centers
around egotistical producer,
director and lead actor Fred
Graham, played by graduate

student Nelson Burton, as his
show, the musical version of
The Taming of the Shrew,
opens in Baltimore.
His leading lady, played by
senior Emmie Stenstedt, is also
Graham's ex-wife, and an off
stage embodiment of Shakes
peare's "shrew." They are still
in love with each other, but
naturally won't admit it. Their
lives are complicated by Bill
Calhoon (Paul King) and Lois
Lane (Michelle Collopy), a
compulsive gambler and social
climber, respectively. Throw in
a gambling debt, a right-wing
congressman, and a couple of
classy gangsters, and the
intricate-yet-interesting plot
begins to crystallize.
In all, the play promises a
well-spent evening of enter
tainment through its well
directed acting, exciting
choreography and creatively
designed sets. The show runs
April 25 to 28, with tickets avail
able at Tresidder Ticket Office.


Lou Reed will play the Old Waldorf, 444 Battery Street in San Francisco, May 9 and 10. Tickets are
$8.50 in advance, $9.50 the day of the show.

blend of 1948 American theater
and musically upbeat Shakes
peare adds a variety and twist
seldom found in standard mus
ical theater.
The Ram's Head version,
which opens on April 25, prom
ises to bring to the stage all of
the entertainment and pizazz
that Porter wrote into the
show.
"I chose Kiss Me Kate be
cause, for a pre-Steven Son
dheim musical, it is the best
constructed show in terms of
plot and character," said co
director Kevin Cavanaugh.

"That, plus the interest in
doing almost two musicals, the
Shakespeare and the contem
porary, is very high."
The show takes place around
1948, which in itself has been a
challenging limitation to work
under, according to co
director Jeanie Barker.
"We originally did some
re-writing of the show to try
and update parts of it, make
them a little closer to today,"
Barker said. "But it just didn't
work. The modern expressions
didn't fit, so we left it the same.
We are doing it as a 1948 period
piece."
In order to make it work as a
1948 show, special rehearsals
were called in order to develop
not only the leads, but the
characters of the chorus as
well.
Even the Shakespeare parts
of the show are done with a
1948 perspective. It isn't pure
Shakespeare, but Shakespeare
re-written into a 1948 musical
to sell to the commercial audi
ences of the time. This gives it
an upbeat sense of life that
keeps the show moving at a

light and rapid pace.
Working in the 1948
framework has made choreog
raphing the show a challenge,
too. Choreographers Roberta
Sueda and Eric Ho t have run
into just about every kind of
dance style possible while
doing Kiss Me Kate.
"The show demands a wide
range of styles," Hoit said.
"There is ballet, jazz, tap and
even some of what we call
'nightclub' style dancing. It's
all in the script."
"By far the hardest part,"
Sueda said, "was keeping the
dancing in the period style.
Forties jazz is much different
than '70s jazz, for example. We
also had to keep any disco in
fluence out. No one danced
using their hips back then."
"We have tried to do things
as complex as possible within
the limits of the cast," Hoit ad
ded. "That has turned out to be
not much of a limitation."
The show itself centers
around egotistical producer,
director and lead actor Fred
Graham, played by graduate

student Nelson Burton, as his
show, the musical version of
The Taming of the Shrew,
opens in Baltimore.
His leading lady, played by
senior Emmie Stenstedt, is also
Graham's ex-wife, and an off
stage embodiment of Shakes
peare's "shrew." They are still
in love with each other, but
naturally won't admit it. Their
lives are complicated by Bill
Calhoon (Paul King) and Lois
Lane (Michelle Collopy), a
compulsive gambler and social
climber, respectively. Throw in
a gambling debt, a right-wing
congressman, and a couple of
classy gangsters, and the
intricate-yet-interesting plot
begins to crystallize.
In all, the play promises a
well-spent evening of enter
tainment through its well
directed acting, exciting
choreography and creatively
designed sets. The show runs
April 25 to 28, with tickets avail
able at Tresidder Ticket Office.


Lou Reed will play the Old Waldorf, 444 Battery Street in San Francisco, May 9 and 10. Tickets are
$8.50 in advance, $9.50 the day of the show.


Kiss Me Kate
It's spring at Stanford, and
with it comes the opening of
two exciting and promising
musical comedies on campus,
both of which fall under the
title of Ram's Head's spring
production, Kiss Me Kate.
This well-written and highly
entertaining Cole Porter show
is described as two shows sim
ply because that's what it is — a
show within a show, a theater
group in Baltimore that is per
forming a musical version of
Shakespeare's The Taming of
the Shrew. And this bizarre
blend of 1948 American theater
and musically upbeat Shakes
peare adds a variety and twist
seldom found in standard mus
ical theater.

which opens on April 25, prom
ises to bring to the stage all of
