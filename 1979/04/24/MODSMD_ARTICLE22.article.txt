## 'Iolanthe' promises improvement 
### 
Gilbert and Sullivan fans should take
heart. The Stanford Savoyards are begin
ning their uphill climb to excellence, and
theiropening performance of lolanthe last
Friday proves it.
Previous performances by the group
have tended to leave something big to be
desired. In fact, some have been dismal.
But Director Elizabeth Dyrud has done an
outstanding job of putting this latest effort
together. Anyone who has ever had a lik
ing for operetta should try and see one of
the performances this week.
The big improvement over the group's
attempts at H.M.S. Pinafore and The Gon
doliers is the singers' new-found ability to
pronounce the words they sing. This has
been a big problem in the past, and it gen
erally made for a rotten time for audience

members who had not been well-versed in
the story before the show.
Not true with lolanthe. All was sung
clearly.
And all was perfectly delightful. Geordie
Lawry as the Lord Chancellor stole the
evening with a sort of klutzy stiltedness
that Gilbert and Sullivan had intended.
And Lawry is ably supported by the
other male leads including Ben Brink as
the pretentious Private Willis.
In general, the female roles were some
what more weakly performed. Still jeannie
Fetting was convincing as lolanthe and
lacqueline Dickey overplayed the part of
Phyllis just enough to fit into the Gilbert
and Sullivan style.
Adding beautifully to the mood set by

Lawry, the Chorus of Peers of the Realm
were simply superb â€” as was their block
ing. From the moment ot their dramatic
opening entrance from the rear of the au
ditorium, the group demonstrated a com
pany cohesion which made this perfor
mance the success that it was.
The show was entertaining, funny and
enjoyable in every respect. Even the or
chestra was a high point. Tickets are still
available for the performances this
weekend, and they're cheap. So whether
you're a Gilbert and Sullivan nut or a clone
still wondering what a "poor little butter
cup" is, you should get over to Dinkelspiel
and give the Savoyards an audience.
I can hardly wait for The Mikado next
fall.
