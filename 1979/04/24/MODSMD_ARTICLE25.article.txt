Saudis break with Sadat
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia decided
yesterday to break diplomatic relations with
Egypt in compliance with the Baghdad Arab
summit decision last month to impose sanc
tions against the Cairo government, the official
Saudi news agency reported.
The sanctions are intended to punish Presi
dent Anwar Sadat for signing a peace treaty
with Israel.
Kuwait announced earlier yesterday that it
had broken diplomatic relations with Egypt for
the same reason.
Information Minister Mohammed Abdo
Yamani said the decision to sever relations
with Egypt was taken "because Egypt accepted
and planned to exchange diplomatic represen
tation with the Zionist enemy (Israel)."
"Egypt began to establish normal relations
with the enemy without taking into considera
tion the minimum of demands the Arabs had
been looking forward to as a basis for a just and
comprehensive peace," the minister added.
Arab diplomatic sources said all 19 Arab
League members that participated in the anti-
Sadat Baghdad meeting would take similar ac
tion soon.
Amin visits Libya, Iraq
Nairobi, Kenya — Ousted dictator Idi Amin
visited Iraq over the weekend on an Arab
states shopping tour for weapons to make a
comeback in his tribal birthplace in north
western Uganda, Arab diplomats said yester
day.
Their reports raised the prospect of prot
racted fighting that could drain the energies of
provisional president Yusufu Lule's 2-week
old government as it seeks to repair economic
damage caused by two weeks of looting, six
months of war and eight years of Amin's rule.
Amin's whereabouts has stirred speculation
ever since he lost control of Kampala two
weeks ago. Tanzanian soldiers fighting for the
Lule government found no trace of him on
Sunday when they took Jinja, Uganda's second
city and site of a vital power dam and bridge
over the Nile river.

Arab diplomats said Amin flew from Uganda
to Libya and then to Iraq, traveling to two
hardline states that had helped him establish
Moslem-minority rule in Uganda. From Iraq,
the sources said, Amin continued to an unde
termined destination, possibly to return to
Uganda or to look for help from other Arab
backers.
The reports of Amin's trip to Iraq were but
tressed by a recent statement by Stansfield
Turner, director of the U.S. Central Intelli
gence Agency, that Amin had moved members
of his family to Iraq.
Iranian officer assassinated
Tehran, Iran — Gunmen killed a high
ranking military officer of the new government
yesterday in the first assassination of a major
figure of the revolution.
Gen. Mohammad Vali Gharani, the former
army chief of staff, was shot in his garden and
died during surgery.
Pars, Iran's state news agency, said one at
tacker held bystanders at bay with a machine
gun while a colleague scaled the outer wall of
the garden and shot Gharani.
The general was forced to resign March 27
after he failed to convince troops who de
serted during the revolution to return to their
barracks. No group has claimed responsibility
for his death. His assassins escaped.
He once served as intelligence chief for de
posed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi but was
jailed for his anti-monarchist views.
White trial starts tomorrow
San Francisco — A judge refused yesterday to
grant a motion by Dan White's lawyers to pro
hibit prosecutors from excluding from White's
murder jury citizens against the death penalty,
and trial was ordered to begin tomorrow.
Superior Court Judge Walter Calcagno said
he thought a fair and impartial jury will be
found to try White for the City Hall gunshot
murders of Mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk. White has pleaded
innocent.
The jury selection process was ordered to

begin tomorrow from among 250 men and
women, 150 more than usually called in mur
der trials.
The 40-minute session got underway with
Superior Judge Claude Perasso briskly and
without explanation denying an earlier de
fense motion that Judge Calcagno should be
taken off the case because of bias. Perasso
immediately left the bench and was replaced
by Calcagno.
Co-defense counsel, Stephen Scherr, ar
gued against permitting excluding prospective
jurors who are against the death penalty.
The former supervisor is charged with first
degree murder under the "special cir
cumstances" provision of a new state law,
which could result in a sentence of death in the
gas chamber. White could also be convicted of
second degree murder or manslaughter, or
acquitted.
SALT accord approaches
Washington — President Jimmy Carter re
turned to work yesterday amid indications
there might be an announcement by week's
end of a treaty with the Soviet Union to limit
strategic nuclear weapons.
But White House and State Department offi
cials said the long-expected arms accord was
not yet wrapped up.
These officials, who declined to be iden
tified, said the Russians would like to have all
major issues settled before announcing a
summit meeting between Carter and Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev.
The U.S. position is that if there is general
agreement on the major treaty provisions, Car
ter and Brezhnev could apply some of the
finishing touches at the summit in late May.
But, in any event, at least one more session
between Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin is ex
pected — and the date for that is still not set.
In a speech to the National Academy of Sci
ences here, Carter called on science profes
sionals "to help shape an educated public de
bate" on SALT.
In more general terms, the president told his
scientific audience: "SALT II will reduce the

risk of nuclear war by lowering levels of
strategic arms, constraining development of
new weapons systems, and contributing to a
more stable political relationship with the
Soviet Union."
Mid-Western rivers flood
Weary volunteers worked in incessant rains
yesterday to fight back the Red River, which
rose to its highest point this century at East
Grand Forks, Minn. Its waters breached dikes
and spilled through city streets and affluent
neighborhoods.
More rain also bodes more trouble for Col
umbia, Miss., on the Pearl River, where half
the town's 7500 residents have been homeless
for several days, waiting for the flooding river
to recede. More than 2 inches had fallen since
Sunday, and the National Weather Service had
predicted 3 or more inches could send the
river back up again.
In southeast Texas, where flooding late last
week caused damage estimated at up to $175
million and claimed at least seven lives,
sandbag crews also were at work along the
Nueces River, which was 8 feet above flood
stage and rising in the Beaumont area. But
water was receding in the Houston and Con
roe areas and mopping up had begun.
Stocks gain in quiet trading
New York — A late ripple of buying interest
helped the stock market post a modest gain
yesterday in the quietest session in more than
five weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had fallen 18.71 points in the past two
weeks, recovered 3.12 to 860.10.
New York Stock Exchange volume came to
25.61 million shares, down from 28.83 million
Friday and the lightest total since a 24.63
million-share day on March 14.
Today's weather
Some clouds through tomorrow. Chance of
showers late today through tomorrow. Lows in
mid4os to lowsos. Highs in upper 50s and 60s.

the garden and shot Gharani.
The general was forced to resign March 27
after he failed to convince troops who de

barracks. No group has claimed responsibility
for his death. His assassins escaped.
He once served as intelligence chief for de

jailed for his anti-monarchist views.
White trial starts tomorrow
San Francisco — A judge refused yesterday to
grant a motion by Dan White's lawyers to pro
hibit prosecutors from excluding from White's
murder jury citizens against the death penalty,
and trial was ordered to begin tomorrow.
Superior Court Judge Walter Calcagno said
he thought a fair and impartial jury will be
found to try White for the City Hall gunshot
murders of Mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk. White has pleaded
innocent.
The jury selection process was ordered to

begin tomorrow from among 250 men and
women, 150 more than usually called in mur
der trials.
The 40-minute session got underway with
Superior Judge Claude Perasso briskly and
without explanation denying an earlier de
fense motion that Judge Calcagno should be
taken off the case because of bias. Perasso
immediately left the bench and was replaced
by Calcagno.
Co-defense counsel, Stephen Scherr, ar
gued against permitting excluding prospective
jurors who are against the death penalty.
The former supervisor is charged with first
degree murder under the "special cir
cumstances" provision of a new state law,
which could result in a sentence of death in the
gas chamber. White could also be convicted of
second degree murder or manslaughter, or
acquitted.
SALT accord approaches
Washington — President Jimmy Carter re
turned to work yesterday amid indications
there might be an announcement by week's
end of a treaty with the Soviet Union to limit
strategic nuclear weapons.
But White House and State Department offi
cials said the long-expected arms accord was
not yet wrapped up.
These officials, who declined to be iden
tified, said the Russians would like to have all
major issues settled before announcing a
summit meeting between Carter and Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev.
The U.S. position is that if there is general
agreement on the major treaty provisions, Car
ter and Brezhnev could apply some of the
finishing touches at the summit in late May.
But, in any event, at least one more session
between Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin is ex
pected — and the date for that is still not set.
In a speech to the National Academy of Sci
ences here, Carter called on science profes
sionals "to help shape an educated public de
bate" on SALT.
In more general terms, the president told his
scientific audience: "SALT II will reduce the

risk of nuclear war by lowering levels of
strategic arms, constraining development of
new weapons systems, and contributing to a
more stable political relationship with the
Soviet Union."
Mid-Western rivers flood
Weary volunteers worked in incessant rains
yesterday to fight back the Red River, which
rose to its highest point this century at East
Grand Forks, Minn. Its waters breached dikes
and spilled through city streets and affluent
neighborhoods.
More rain also bodes more trouble for Col
umbia, Miss., on the Pearl River, where half
the town's 7500 residents have been homeless
for several days, waiting for the flooding river
to recede. More than 2 inches had fallen since
Sunday, and the National Weather Service had
predicted 3 or more inches could send the
river back up again.
In southeast Texas, where flooding late last
week caused damage estimated at up to $175
million and claimed at least seven lives,
sandbag crews also were at work along the
Nueces River, which was 8 feet above flood
stage and rising in the Beaumont area. But
water was receding in the Houston and Con
roe areas and mopping up had begun.
Stocks gain in quiet trading
New York — A late ripple of buying interest
helped the stock market post a modest gain
yesterday in the quietest session in more than
five weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had fallen 18.71 points in the past two
weeks, recovered 3.12 to 860.10.
New York Stock Exchange volume came to
25.61 million shares, down from 28.83 million
Friday and the lightest total since a 24.63
million-share day on March 14.
Today's weather

Saudis break with Sadat
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia decided
yesterday to break diplomatic relations with
Egypt in compliance with the Baghdad Arab
summit decision last month to impose sanc
tions against the Cairo government, the official
Saudi news agency reported.
The sanctions are intended to punish Presi
dent Anwar Sadat for signing a peace treaty
with Israel.
Kuwait announced earlier yesterday that it
had broken diplomatic relations with Egypt for
the same reason.
Information Minister Mohammed Abdo
Yamani said the decision to sever relations
with Egypt was taken "because Egypt accepted
and planned to exchange diplomatic represen
tation with the Zionist enemy (Israel)."
"Egypt began to establish normal relations
with the enemy without taking into considera
tion the minimum of demands the Arabs had
been looking forward to as a basis for a just and
comprehensive peace," the minister added.
Arab diplomatic sources said all 19 Arab
League members that participated in the anti-
Sadat Baghdad meeting would take similar ac
tion soon.
Amin visits Libya, Iraq
Nairobi, Kenya — Ousted dictator Idi Amin
visited Iraq over the weekend on an Arab
states shopping tour for weapons to make a
comeback in his tribal birthplace in north
western Uganda, Arab diplomats said yester
day.
Their reports raised the prospect of prot
racted fighting that could drain the energies of
provisional president Yusufu Lule's 2-week
old government as it seeks to repair economic
damage caused by two weeks of looting, six
months of war and eight years of Amin's rule.
Amin's whereabouts has stirred speculation
ever since he lost control of Kampala two
weeks ago. Tanzanian soldiers fighting for the
Lule government found no trace of him on
Sunday when they took Jinja, Uganda's second
city and site of a vital power dam and bridge
over the Nile river.

Arab diplomats said Amin flew from Uganda
to Libya and then to Iraq, traveling to two
hardline states that had helped him establish
Moslem-minority rule in Uganda. From Iraq,
the sources said, Amin continued to an unde
termined destination, possibly to return to
Uganda or to look for help from other Arab
backers.
The reports of Amin's trip to Iraq were but
tressed by a recent statement by Stansfield
Turner, director of the U.S. Central Intelli
gence Agency, that Amin had moved members
of his family to Iraq.
Iranian officer assassinated
Tehran, Iran — Gunmen killed a high
ranking military officer of the new government
yesterday in the first assassination of a major
figure of the revolution.
Gen. Mohammad Vali Gharani, the former
army chief of staff, was shot in his garden and
died during surgery.
Pars, Iran's state news agency, said one at
tacker held bystanders at bay with a machine
gun while a colleague scaled the outer wall of
the garden and shot Gharani.

scientific audience: "SALT II will reduce the

risk of nuclear war by lowering levels of
strategic arms, constraining development of
new weapons systems, and contributing to a
more stable political relationship with the
Soviet Union."
Mid-Western rivers flood
Weary volunteers worked in incessant rains
yesterday to fight back the Red River, which
rose to its highest point this century at East
Grand Forks, Minn. Its waters breached dikes
and spilled through city streets and affluent
neighborhoods.
More rain also bodes more trouble for Col
umbia, Miss., on the Pearl River, where half
the town's 7500 residents have been homeless
for several days, waiting for the flooding river
to recede. More than 2 inches had fallen since
Sunday, and the National Weather Service had
predicted 3 or more inches could send the
river back up again.
In southeast Texas, where flooding late last
week caused damage estimated at up to $175
million and claimed at least seven lives,
sandbag crews also were at work along the
Nueces River, which was 8 feet above flood
stage and rising in the Beaumont area. But
water was receding in the Houston and Con
roe areas and mopping up had begun.
Stocks gain in quiet trading

weeks, recovered 3.12 to 860.10.

million-share day on March 14.
