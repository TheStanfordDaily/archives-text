# German professor champions Einstein's pacifist crusade
## 
### Jenny Smith 
William Hermanns is a man with a
cause. For more than 50 of his 83
years, he has devoted himself to
pacifist and humanist ideals he
learned from a man he calls "a great
humanist" â€” Albert Einstein.
This week, Hermanns, a retired
San lose State University sociology
professor, will speak Thursday about
his friend of more than 30 years. The
speech will be given in conjunction
with his recently completed book on
Einstein, which deals with a side of
the scientist's greatness for which
few people would remember him.
Hermanns believes that Einstein's
greatest contribution to the world
was not his scientific work, such as
the theory of relativity which led to
our understanding of the universe.
Instead, he wants Einstein to be
commemorated as "an example in
character and thinking."
Hermanns calls his friend "a cos
mic being who was able to follow the
path of the stars and, at the same
time, the path of one man."
"I have studied the lives of saints
and heroes," Hermanns said. "I have
met many great people in my long
life, including spiritual men like
Gandhi and Yogananda; heroic
people from Madame Curie and
George Clemenceau in France, to

Winston Churchill in England;
people with self-sacrificial virtues,
such as )ane Addams and Eleanor
Roosevelt in the United States.
'Great jewish prophet'
"Of all these great people, how
ever, Einstein is the one who, in his
humility and love for mankind,
comes closest to St. Francis of Assisi.
With Einstein are fulfilled the words I
once heard: There are many saints
who are not Catholics.' "
Hermanns saw Einstein not only as
a philosopher, but as a "great )ewish
prophet." During theirassociation in
the United States after World War 11,
Einstein made many predictions that
have since come true, Hermanns
said.
The prediction that has had the
most impact on Hermanns' life came
in 1954, one year before Einstein's
death. "Einstein told me that he
would not, but that I might live to see
the next world war," Hermanns re
called.
Third world war?
When asked by Hermanns what
would happen then, Einstein merely
said, "That is it." Horrified, Her
manns cried out, "Will there be no
survivors?" Einstein told him that
one fourth of the world's population
would survive, "but they will live in
caves. The fourth world war will be

fought out with clubs."
Since that time, Hermanns has de
voted his life to the one escape route
Einstein showed him. "To prevent a
third world war," Hermanns said,
"Einstein told me to reach out to the
youth of the world, starting here in
America. His hope was to form a
world youth movement, based on
conscience, which inspires us to
wards love and justice."
Hermanns' love for Einstein is ob
vious. A large portrait of his friend
hangs in his small apartment here on
campus where he has lived for the
past five years. When he speaks of
his friend, his eyes flash as he walks
slowly around the room, his
thoughts transported to a stormy
past.
Human rights league
The two men became friends in the
early 1920s in Berlin. Their friendship
deepened as they worked together
in the League of Human Rights, a
group dedicated to the unification of
all nations under one world fellow
ship. Hermanns, having survived the
Battle of Verdun in World War I, had
vowed to live for the pacifist cause.
Einstein was already famous for his
theory of relativity and his opposi
tion to Germany's aggressive role in
World War I.
When Hitler took over in the 19305,

Hermanns tried to undermine the
general belief in Hitler's "genius" by
airing a radio broadcast entitled
"Genius and Tenacity." Hermanns
made a direct comparison between
the innate genius of Einstein and the
" 'genius' of Hitler which was
created by the masses," Hermanns
said. Because of that broadcast,
Hermanns was placed on the Nazis'
dreaded list, and he fled from his
homeland.
Einstein was also considered a
dreaded enemy by the Nazis. Her
manns recalled one attempt on his
friend's life in 1930.
Assassination attempt
"I arrived at my friend's house for
tea, and I noticed a strange-looking
man standing by the door," Her
manns said. "The same man was
there when I left, so I asked him if I
could help him. He told me that if
Einstein did not come out in the next
30 minutes, he would blow up the
house."
Hermanns said that the Nazi
strategy at the time was to use "men
tally irresponsible men to do away
with their enemies," and he knew
Einstein was in danger. The police
did nothing to help.
At that time, Einstein had been de
clared Public Enemy No. 1, with a

price of 20,000 marks on his head.
Hermanns and Frau Einstein tried to
persuade him to leave Germany. He
finally left when Hitler took over,
"not out of fear for his own life, but
because he could not bear to live in
such a country as Germany had be
come," Hermanns said.
At the zenith of Hitler's power in
1941, Einstein predicted that "the
Jewish God of justice and love will
destroy that man."
Terrible price for bomb
Einstein, whose theory of relativity
unlocked the secrets behind the
atom bomb, also predicted that

America would have to pay a terrible
price for Hiroshima.
"My friend wept when the atom
bomb was set off at Hiroshima,"
Hermanns said. "He wanted it set off
on an empty island so Japanese offi
cials could see its effect. He never
wanted people to be killed by the
bomb."
Hermanns hopes that his book will
help start the world youth movement
which will fulfill the dreams of his
friend. Entitled Einstein and the Poet
- My Conversations with the
Philosopher-Prophet, the book
should be available by this fall.
