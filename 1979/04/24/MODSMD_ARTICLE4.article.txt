# Heliport service criticized
## Eliastam says Stanford not at fault 
### Robin Millington 
Charges that a patient died due to
lack of proper emergency care at the
Stanford Medical Center Heliport
last month exaggerate the facts and
unfairly blame the University for cir
cumstances beyond its control, ac
cording to Director of Emergency
Services Michael Eliastam.
The charges were made by )ohn
Bell, a graduate student in civil en
gineering here in a letter to the Daily
published Wednesday. In the letter,
Bell claimed that the unnamed pa
tient, the victim of a water accident,
was forced to wait "between 15 and
20 minutes" without oxygen at the
heliport until Palo Alto paramedics
arrived to transport the victim to the
emergency room.
Bell alleged that the delay could
have caused the patient's death,

since oxygen was crucial at that point
and the rescue team's supply had run
out.
But replenishing the helicopter's
oxygen supply, which had run out
just before takeoff, would have
meant obtaining another oxygen
bottle from a nearby truck and would
have "delayed the victim's arrival. . .
at least five minutes," Bell said.
The rescue team chose not to re
plenish its oxygen supply because of
the proximity of the Med Center to
the accident site (Tunitas Creek
Beach), a "10-minute" flight away,
Bell said.
But "to blame Stanford for every
thing is ridiculous," Eliastam said.
"By the time the Coast Guard
found him (the victim) he was already
dead," Eliastam said.
The delay at the hospital heliport in
getting the victim to the emergency
room was due to an overestimate of
the time it would take to transport
the victim that was supplied by the
Coast Guard, Eliastam said.
While the Coast Guard helicopter
notified the Med Center after takeoff
they would arrive in 10 or 15 minutes,
they actually arrived approximately
seven minutes later, according to
Eliastam.
"If we knew it was seven minutes
we could have done it,"he said. "I
don't want to blame the Coast Guard
â€” it all started at the bottom of a cliff
where he was already dead."
The victim had been swimming in a
river at the bottom of a cliff, a loca
tion that made rescue nearly impos
sible, Eliastam said.
He admitted that "we didn't move
as fast as we could have" but that the
speed of their reaction was based on
the time information then available.
Eliastam also pointed out that it is
difficult to work with all the many
players in the system.
"There is the issue of how to keep
many nurses all fully aware of proce
dures to follow in the event of the
information that a helicopter will be
arriving in a few minutes," he said.
"Also, how do you make sure that

the ambulance company, whose veh
icle may be out on an emergency,
will be able to supply a vehicle within
minutes to the heliport, he added.
Part of the problem in this particu
lar drowning situation was the failure
of the communications system, Elias
tam said. To order more help it was
necessary to use an intermediary to
relay messages from the bottom of
the cliff to the rescue base. In addi
tion, the Med Center was not
notified until after the helicopter was
in the air that the patient was coming,
thereby reducing the paramedics re
sponse time.
Eliastam said he believes the sys
tem as it exists is not bad but he does
see possible areas of improvement.
"There is no existing helicopter
system with the exception of MAST
from Fort Ord for patients to be lifted
from the field directly to Stanford ex
cept for the Coast Guard, which is a
federal agency and covers only sea
related accidents," he said.
The California Highway Patrol has
no helicopters and the Sheriff's of
fice only has the small bubble-cabin
type.
Eliastam said that only one or two
dozen patients are brought to the
heliport each year and that there is
not enough money at the moment to
support full-time service at the land
ing pad, but that the question of
whether this is a necessary resource
allocation should be raised.
"I think the system could be im
proved if there were money available
for helicopters to fly in here more
often for practices, money available
for more training for personnel to
resuscitate water injuries, and if bet
ter and earlier notification could be
created."
Eliastam said that Proposition 13
has made funding for programs very
difficult and that the community
doesn't have enough money to sta
tion units everywhere for easy access
to such places as the coast.
"It's a matter of how much money
people are willing to spend on the
service," he said.
