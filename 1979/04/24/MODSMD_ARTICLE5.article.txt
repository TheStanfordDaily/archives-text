# Walton speaks on sports, nukes

### Chris Haft 
Blending gravity with humor, pro
fessional basketball star Bill Walton
spoke of his own career, the quality
of life and assorted other topics last
night at Kresge Auditorium in the
first of a series of lectures sponsored
by the Department of Athletics.
Nuclear power, the balance of na
ture's ecosystem and America's po
tential for greatness dominated Wal
ton's serious messages.
It was Walton's amusing side,
however, that most entertained the
audience of approximately 250 per
sons. The three-time UCLA Ail-
American began his talk by saying,
"In addition to all the major colleges
that recruited me, Stanford also re
cruited me."

Walton also elicited laughter with
an anecdote about the 1973 NCAA
Championship finals in St. Louis,
Mo. — "Not that nice a place," he
called it.
In St. Louis, NCAA officials stayed
in plush hotels while the players
lodged in Rodeway and Holiday Inns.
"It was a typical NCAA situation,"
said Walton.
Faced with the prospect of sleep
ing in a bed "as big as this podium" in
a room "six feet from an expressway"
on the night before a national
championship game, Walton com
plained to ).D. Morgan, UCLA's ath
letic director.
As Walton related, Morgan graci
ously yielded his room to the 6-foot
-11 center. Walton's peaceful
slumber, however, was interrupted
at4:3oa.m. by the hotel managerand
"about 30" armed policemen.
Morgan, it seemed, had not
checked out of the room properly, so
the hotel sold it to somebody else.
Walton finished his escapade in a
lavish Presidential suite. "The next
day I told the guys, 'We're having the
party in my room,' " Walton recal
led.
Philippine Eagle
Yet Walton's most recent trip, a
17-day stay in the Philippine Islands
while taping The American
Sportsman for ABC-TV, involved in
finitely more serious matters.
Walton noted the probable extinc
tion of the Philippine Eagle, which he
termed as the rarest and largest eagle
in the world.
The bird's imminent doom, Wal
ton believes, may not threaten na
ture now, but it maybe a harbinger of
future damage.
"People don't realize that all of life
is interrelated — insects, plants,
birds," he said. "We're only a part of
this, though a big part, and we have
to take care of what is around us.
One day we're gonna be responsible
for the extinction of a species that
will set up a (negative) chain reac
tion."
Walton also saw nuclearpoweras a
tampering with nature, citing its
danger for "serious genetic damage
and nuclear meltdown — which
spells instant death."
"Nuclear power toys with our
health," Walton went on. "I was
taught to strive to be happy, and it's
not possible to be happy unless
you're healthy."
Basketball future
As for his personal health, Walton
told sportswriters at a luncheon yes
terday at the Faculty Club that he ex
pects to be "200 percent" recovered
by September from the broken left
foot he suffered last year while com
peting for the Portland Trailblazers in
the NBA playoffs.
Walton, who officially becomes a
free agent at the end of this year's
playoffs, is considering every NBA
team before signing, "except for
Tehran and Three Mile Island."
In both the luncheon and the lec
ture, Walton asserted his belief that
America is the greatest country in the
world. He ended last night's talk by
urging students to make the most of
their opportunities at college — "If
you never try anything you'll never
get anything done."

Morgan, it seemed, had not
checked out of the room properly, so
the hotel sold it to somebody else.
Walton finished his escapade in a
lavish Presidential suite. "The next
day I told the guys, 'We're having the
party in my room,' " Walton recal
led.
Philippine Eagle
Yet Walton's most recent trip, a
17-day stay in the Philippine Islands
while taping The American
Sportsman for ABC-TV, involved in
finitely more serious matters.
Walton noted the probable extinc
tion of the Philippine Eagle, which he
termed as the rarest and largest eagle
in the world.
The bird's imminent doom, Wal
ton believes, may not threaten na
ture now, but it maybe a harbinger of
future damage.
"People don't realize that all of life
is interrelated — insects, plants,
birds," he said. "We're only a part of
this, though a big part, and we have
to take care of what is around us.
One day we're gonna be responsible
for the extinction of a species that
will set up a (negative) chain reac
tion."
Walton also saw nuclearpoweras a
tampering with nature, citing its
danger for "serious genetic damage
and nuclear meltdown — which
spells instant death."
"Nuclear power toys with our
health," Walton went on. "I was
taught to strive to be happy, and it's
not possible to be happy unless
you're healthy."
Basketball future
As for his personal health, Walton
told sportswriters at a luncheon yes
terday at the Faculty Club that he ex
pects to be "200 percent" recovered
by September from the broken left
foot he suffered last year while com
peting for the Portland Trailblazers in
the NBA playoffs.
Walton, who officially becomes a
free agent at the end of this year's
playoffs, is considering every NBA
team before signing, "except for
Tehran and Three Mile Island."
In both the luncheon and the lec
ture, Walton asserted his belief that
America is the greatest country in the
world. He ended last night's talk by
urging students to make the most of
their opportunities at college — "If
you never try anything you'll never
get anything done."
