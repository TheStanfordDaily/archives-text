# Professors emeriti not satisfied with University's treatment
## 
### Karen Eustis 
Forty-five percent of University
professors emeriti surveyed said
they were dissatisfied with the Uni
versity's handling of its retired fa
culty, according to a survey con
ducted by Anthropology Prof. Clif
ford Barnett.
Drawing an "incredible" 62 per
cent response, Barnett said that 9
percent of the emeriti said they
were treated "poorly" and 36 per
cent said they were treated "as well
as can be expected." Only 28 percent
said the University had been "ex
tremely helpful," and barely half said
they had been treated with "courtesy
and respect."
The research on retirement by
sociologists and psychologists
"shows that the worst thing you can
do is 'cold turkey' somebody,"
explained Barnett.
"For universities, it's like saying
one day, 'You're a functioning
member of a major institution and it
matters if you do or don't show up,'
and the next day saying, 'Okay, we
don't want or need you. You're
out.'
"When the law passed prohibiting
mandatory retirement, there was
sheer panic in the University," Bar
nett said. "We felt that whpn the
University was forced to review its
retirement policies, it should not
panic, but act on the basis of infor
mation. That information wasn't

there."
What Barnett's study did reveal is
that the University needs to take a
long, hard look at the situation of
professors emeriti because there is
plenty of discontent.
Written comments
The written comments on the sur
vey revealed that a variety of experi
ences lie behind the dissatisfaction:
— "It would have been nice to
have had a letter from the University
recognizing my retirement rather
than from the business office stating
my health insurance had been can
celed due to my impending retire
ment at age 65;
—"So far as I can see, the Univer
sity shows no genuine interest in the
problems presented to emeriti by in
flation and a static income."
Financial situation gloomy
As the last remark indicates, the
financial situation is gloomy for many
emeriti. Nineteen percent of the re
spondents said that their standard of
living is "lower" or "much lower"
since retirement. Although the ex
trapolated average income is com
paratively high, $28,332, 25 percent
of the respondents have an income
below $15,000 and 34 percent below
$20,000.
"These figures show that 25 per
cent of the emeriti have severe finan
cial problems," Barnett said. "It
shows how inadequate the TIAA
CREF (the University's retirement

plan) is."
Many of the emeriti who reported
that they were "satisfied" with their
present financial situation said this
was because they had other sources
of income besides the TIAA-CREF
pension.
Given the financial situation re
ported by the emeriti, it is not sur
prising that 79 percent indicated that
financial planning should be in
cluded in a pre-retirement program.
The emeriti reported that informa-

tion on insurance and employment
should also be incorporated.
Lot to contribute
"I think the most positive thing to
come out of the survey was the tre
mendous number of emeriti who
said 'we have a lot to contribute,
even on a voluntary basis,' " Barnett
said. But according to the survey re
sults, "The picture that emerges is
that of a group of people who feel
they are able to continue to make a
contribution. . ~ but are not permit
ted or even asked."
Emeriti reported a wide variefy of

arrangements with their depart
ments ranging from complete integ
ration to complete rejection. The
survey revealed that there are no
minimal University-wide rules gov
erning the status of emeriti. Provi
sion for office and laboratory space,
secretarial assistance and teaching
and administrative opportunities are
left up to the individual departments
or schools.
One idea to come out of the survey
to help facilitate continued contribu-

tion was that of an emeriti center, a
place where retired faculty can have
office space, conference rooms and
other work space.
"As of yet, there isn't any recogni
tion by the administration of these
possibilities," Barnett said.
Hard to generalize
Although the survey does provide
much needed statistical data, it is dif
ficult to generalize about the indi
vidual attitudes and personal experi
ences of the University's retired fa
culty.
"Although I don't teach anymore, I

feel that in spirit at least, I'm more or
less involved with the University. I
continue to attend Ph.D. orals, take
over classes when necessary and go
to occasional departmental meet
ings," said Harold Bacon, emeritus
professor of mathematics.
"There is a pleasant freedom of
movement with retirement," he said.
"My wife and I have taken several
trips. But of course, there are limita
tions because of a fixed income.
"Actually, I didn't notice any great
change when I retired," he said
thoughtfully. "I was asked to con
tinue teaching and I kept in contact
with the department, friends and
students. It was not a shock because I
knew it was going to occur at a cer
tain time, and I could prepare emo
tionally and financially for it.
Part-time work
"I think mandatory retirement is
good on a general principle, with ad
justments possible for part-time
work on an ad hoc basis," Bacon con
tinued.
For some professors emeriti, re
tirement means the challenge of
finding new ways to use their talents
outside the University.
Jeffrey Smith, emeritus professor
of philosophy and humanities,
"dreamed up" the idea of an Emeriti
Institute, a program of continuing
education by and for older people.
The program now has about 300 stu
dents, and is sponsored by Canada

College and Little House, a senior
citizens center in Menlo Park.
Courses ranging from "Current Af
fairs" to "On the Human Potential"
are taught by retired faculty from var
ious universities.
Can do new things
"I never have any spare time," he
said. "But this is because I've taken
steps to avoid it. Retirement can to
some extent be liberating. It can be
wonderful if there are things you
want to do beyond what you've pre
viously done. If not, it's traumatic.
People who fiddle are miserable."
On the practical side Smith com
mented, "It's not advice people
need, but money. The pension is
ridiculous with respect to inflation. I
couldn't begin to live on it. I manage
to live the way I do by continuing to
work."
The University does recognize the
problems surrounding retirement's
new status. Since faculty will have
more choice with regards to retire
ment, more pre-retirement planning
is necessary. As of Sept. 1, the be
nefits office will have a full-time
faculty-staff retirement counselor,
and a seminar on pre-retirement
planning is scheduled for the spring.
"The University has become more
aware of the issues, and is trying to
meet them," Director of Benefits
jeannie Thomas said. "We're headed
in the right direction."
