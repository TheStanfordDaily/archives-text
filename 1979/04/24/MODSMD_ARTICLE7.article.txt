# Local Circle K has growing pains

### Terri Ann Flanagan 
Stanford University Circle K
(SUCK), a co-ed college service
organization, battles the obs
tacles of youth with a small but
dedicated membership.
The club aims to provide ser
vice to the campus and com
munity as well as social ac
tivities for its members. A child
of the all-male kiwanis service
organization for businessmen

and professionals, Circle K In
ternational originated at
Carthage College in Illinois in
1947 with 23 members. Today it
has over 600 clubs and more
than 11,000 members.
SUCK, however, wasn't
founded until September 1977;
it presently has 12 official
members. Twelve is the
minimum member require
ment to charter a club.
Reasons for joining the or
ganization vary; according to
the Circle K members here, it
offers friendships, leadership,
self-direction, diversity from
iacademia, enrichment, gratifi
cation and an outlet for creativ
ity.
Cqnsidering the group's
size, SUCK Secretary Vic Wolf
said he feels it's been success
ful. Accomplishments this year
include a hypertension screen
ing; a holiday food basket sale
which raised $150 for needy
families in the community; and
a Halloween party at Children's
Hospital. However, the or
ganization is having some
problems.
"One problem," said SUCK
Vice President Steve Harris," is
that other organizations on
campus fulfill needs sepa
rately. We combine service,
social and leadership roles; we
want to do it better, and I think

we do — but that's not saying
much right now. Fraternities
claim to be service organiza
tions, but their service is a keg
of beer on Friday night."
Another problem is "the na
ture of the campus. Stanford
students are self-centered —
too busy in their academic
worlds — to get involved,''
Harris said. "It's not the type of
thing you join to get on your
transcript," said SUCK Trea
surer ]udi Lum.
Living and eating arrange
ments are divided more than at
other campuses, according to
the club's Kiwanis adviser,
Ralph White. Croup member
Greg Warwick attributes the
University's lack of enthusiasm
toward the club to "an unin
formed student public."
The only other campus or
ganization devoted solely to
service is Alpha Phi Omega, a
co-ed college service fraternity
which grew out of Boy Scouts
of America, according to
White. After 48 years here, the
fraternity has 19 members. "A
lot of other campuses have
larger membership,'' said Tre
asurer James Laßelle, but he
said he could not explain why.
The fraternity's president, John
Lau, said "it's a matter of be
coming more visible." But that
tends to disintegrate group

cohesiveness, he added.
Solidarity, in addition to
size, is a problem for SUCK.
According to Wolf, the club
leadership has been too iso
lated from its members in the
past. "Sometimes you can get
lost in the service activities and
lose sight of the people in the
group and their needs."
Wolf said better communica
tions might have saved them
from a financial failure on their
major winter quarter project.
The club sponsored two show
ings of Warren Miller's Skiing
On My Mind to raise money for
muscular dystrophy, but those
in charge failed to seek mem
bers' comments on the plan,
according to Wolf. SUCK lost
$175, White said.
SUCK currently has $115 in
its treasury. Before the Warren
Miller fiasco, it had $1237, most
of which it spent on service
related causes.
Harris said-he recently
applied for an $800 grant from
the ASSU Fund Allocation. "It
looks promising that we'll get
something, but not necessarily
all of it,"he said.
White said he hopes to raise
SUCK membership to 25 to 30,
but he feels that those who
have joined in spite of busy
schedules provide a strong
core.

The only other campus or
ganization devoted solely to
service is Alpha Phi Omega, a
co-ed college service fraternity
which grew out of Boy Scouts
of America, according to
White. After 48 years here, the
fraternity has 19 members. "A
lot of other campuses have
larger membership,'' said Tre
asurer James Laßelle, but he
said he could not explain why.
The fraternity's president, John
Lau, said "it's a matter of be
coming more visible." But that
tends to disintegrate group

cohesiveness, he added.
Solidarity, in addition to
size, is a problem for SUCK.
According to Wolf, the club
leadership has been too iso
lated from its members in the
past. "Sometimes you can get
lost in the service activities and
lose sight of the people in the
group and their needs."
Wolf said better communica
tions might have saved them
from a financial failure on their
major winter quarter project.
The club sponsored two show
ings of Warren Miller's Skiing
On My Mind to raise money for
muscular dystrophy, but those
in charge failed to seek mem
bers' comments on the plan,
according to Wolf. SUCK lost
$175, White said.
SUCK currently has $115 in
its treasury. Before the Warren
Miller fiasco, it had $1237, most
of which it spent on service
related causes.
Harris said-he recently
applied for an $800 grant from
the ASSU Fund Allocation. "It
looks promising that we'll get
something, but not necessarily
all of it,"he said.
White said he hopes to raise
SUCK membership to 25 to 30,
but he feels that those who
have joined in spite of busy
schedules provide a strong
core.
Stanford University Circle K
(SUCK), a co-ed college service
organization, battles the obs
tacles of youth with a small but
dedicated membership.
The club aims to provide ser
vice to the campus and com
munity as well as social ac
tivities for its members. A child
of the all-male kiwanis service
organization for businessmen

and professionals, Circle K In
ternational originated at
Carthage College in Illinois in
1947 with 23 members. Today it
has over 600 clubs and more
than 11,000 members.
SUCK, however, wasn't
founded until September 1977;
it presently has 12 official
members. Twelve is the
minimum member require
ment to charter a club.
Reasons for joining the or
ganization vary; according to
the Circle K members here, it
offers friendships, leadership,
self-direction, diversity from
iacademia, enrichment, gratifi
cation and an outlet for creativ
ity.
Cqnsidering the group's
size, SUCK Secretary Vic Wolf
said he feels it's been success
ful. Accomplishments this year
include a hypertension screen
ing; a holiday food basket sale
which raised $150 for needy
families in the community; and
a Halloween party at Children's
Hospital. However, the or
ganization is having some
problems.
"One problem," said SUCK
Vice President Steve Harris," is
that other organizations on
campus fulfill needs sepa
rately. We combine service,
social and leadership roles; we
want to do it better, and I think

we do — but that's not saying
much right now. Fraternities
claim to be service organiza
tions, but their service is a keg
of beer on Friday night."
Another problem is "the na
ture of the campus. Stanford
students are self-centered —
too busy in their academic
worlds — to get involved,''
Harris said. "It's not the type of
thing you join to get on your
transcript," said SUCK Trea
surer ]udi Lum.
Living and eating arrange
ments are divided more than at
other campuses, according to
the club's Kiwanis adviser,
Ralph White. Croup member
Greg Warwick attributes the
University's lack of enthusiasm
toward the club to "an unin
formed student public."
