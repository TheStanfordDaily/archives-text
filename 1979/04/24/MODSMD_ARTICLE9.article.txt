# Ford exec discusses emission standards, South Africa
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
Meeting the latest set of
emission control standards
poses "perhaps the greatest
challenge ever faced by the
auto industry," according to
Donald Petersen, Ford Motor
Company's executive vice
president for international au
tomotive operations.
Petersen fielded questions
Thursday from about 200 ad
ministrators and faculty from
here, San Jose State and Uni
versity of Santa Clara at Ford's
College Roundtable held at
Rickey's Hyatt House in Palo
Alto.
Petersen, who has been with
Ford since he graduated from
the Business School here in
1949, added: "Our opinion is
that it will be a horrendous ef
fort, but we will make it. We
don't really know how we'll
make it, but we'll make it."
Ford is currently planning a
$20 billion capital outlay to
meet the 27.5 mile per gallon
fleet average by 1985.
This will have a serious im
pact on Ford's strength in the

rooms and eating areas (in South Africa
operations) to make sure everyone was
being treated equally/

profits have been running
about $2 billion per year.
But Petersen said he is confi
dent that his international divi
sion will maintain its current
strength and keep Ford in good
shape.
In 1978, Ford International
accounted for 48 percent of
Ford profits while handling
only 30 percent of total sales.
Ford products are now sold
in more than 185 nations and
territories by a global network
of some 14,000 dealers. Ford is
the second largest employer in
the world, with more than
480,000 people world-wide.

In addition to producing cars
and trucks, farm and industrial
tractors, industrial engines,
construction machinery, steel
glass and plastics, Ford com
panies are established in
financing, insurance, elec
tronics, automotive replace
ment parts, communications,
space technology and land de
velopment.
Petersen attributed his divi
sion's success in Europe to the
structure of the Common Mar
ket, which allows Ford to have
specialized production
facilities throughout the conti
nent rather than trying to pro
duce everything in one country
as Volkswagen has done.
Ford is currently number
three in the automotive market
in Europe, and was number
one until last October when
British auto workers struck for
nine weeks.
Petersen added that the for
mation of similar economic re
gions in Asia and Latin America
will enhance Ford's interna
tional position.
He further attributed the dif
ference in profit margins bet-

ween the United States and In
ternational to differences in
labor costs as well as emission
control legislation. Petersen
complained that no other
country in the world is as strict
as the United States in the
realm of emission control.
Petersen was critical of past
auto industry policies regard
ing emissions. He said, "An in
dustry essentially unregulated
until about 1965 did a very bad
job of anticipating regulation
and making the transition."
Petersen blamed the defi

ciency on a "free-market
above-all" attitude. He said, "The
industry then had a 'how dare
they' mentality toward gov
ernment; we did a great dis
service to ourselves, and it
lives on."
In an interview after the
Roundtable, Petersen de
monstrated a practical view of
government regulation. He
said that in order to stay in bus
iness, Ford would have to work
with regulators.
However, he said that "reg
ulators should be balanced,
should be trying to come up
with the most balanced solu
tion, all things considered."
Ford's overseas investment
policies were the subject of
several exchanges during the
Roundtable. South Africa,
where Ford has invested 54
years and $150 million, came
under particular scrutiny, but
Petersen maintained that Ford
would do a greater disservice
to the African nation by pulling
out.
"It does help that we are
there," he said. "We have
done much that the South Afri
can government has laws
against; we have had to work
around them . . . and progress
is real."
Petersen explained that all
4000 whites and non-whites in
Ford's South Africa operations
receive equal pay for equal
work, get the same benefits,
the same advancement oppor
tunities and the same
facilities.
"I even toured all the bat
hrooms, locker rooms and eat
ing areas to make sure
everyone was being treated
equally," he said.
According to Petersen, Ford
has built swimming pools and
soccer fields for employees
there, and provides electricity
and school tuition funds to
families of black employees.
Petersen said he has also met
with local non-white leaders to
discuss policy; he asked them

if they wanted Ford to pull out.
"A significant majority wants us
in there," he said. "So, we'll
stay there."
When asked what he consi
dered to be the role of a multi
national corporation in de
veloping countries, Petersen
said, "Our role is to be a good
citizen. We have to abide by
their perception of their laws.
It is simply no longer accepta
ble to act above the laws of a
country, but there is a fine line
between acting above those
laws and trying to be a force for
change and improvement."
Ford's investment policy var
ies from country to country.
"Our former policy was 100
percent ownership or no
deal," Petersen said. "But that
is no longer practical. Many
countries now require at least
some local ownership, the
transfer of technology and
some degree of local content
in the manufacturing process."

Ford's operation in Brazil
runs on 100 percent local con
tent due to the high tariffs the
government has imposed on
imported products or mate
rials, Petersen said. "If we gen
erate enough exports for them,
they will let us import some
products."

'Jimmy Carter has no more right to set (wage
and price) guidelines than I do/
—Ford Chief Economist Bill Niskanen

Petersen said a similar policy
has developed in Australia,
where Ford's assembly process
is 92 percent local content.
Petersen said he felt the pol
icy was unsound economically,
however. He said import sub
stitution was inefficient be
cause the country pursuing the
policy would duplicate efforts
and facilities existing
elsewhere.

Petersen said he was uncer
tain as to the outcome of this
fall's negotiations with the Un
ited Auto Workers (UAW).
"We had a similar situation in
Britain," he said. Petersen
explained that the British Auto
workers struck when Ford's in
itial offer was seen as ludicr-

ously low but within the wage
and price guidelines set by Par
liament.
Petersen felt the same could
happen here. "(Douglas)
Frazier (head of the UAW) al
ready told the government to
stay the hell out and let us
negotiate," Petersen said.
He said he feels that the set
tlement with the auto com
panies will reflect previous set

tlements by the rubber work
ers and the teamsters. The
AFL-CIO recently obtained a
contract including a 30 percent
increase in compensation over
a three-year period.
Bill Niskanen, Ford's chief
economist and a participant in
the Roundtable, did not expect
the UAW to follow President
Jimmy Carter's voluntary wage
and price guidelines. "Person
ally, they are offensive," he
said. "They are not based on
statutory authority; Jimmy Car
ter has no more right to set
guidelines than I do."
Asked what he thought
about the new China market,
Petersen indicated that its
long-term potential is bright,
but is limited in the short run.
Ford recently signed a $7 mill
ion deal with China for 700
medium and light trucks.
The Pinto fiasco has been
somewhat mitigated by the
Iran oil cutoff, Petersen said.
