# China diplomats talk about McCarthyism
## 
### Ron Lillejord 
Although 30 years have passed
since the revolution which made
China communist, the impact of
that revolution on American at
titudes and foreign policy has
lingered long past 1949.
The major component of that
legacy was the paranoia of McCar
thyism — a paranoia that swept
the U.S. government the same
way communism swept China; a
paranoia that was to eventually
claim many victims in an unholy
crusade to ensure American na
tional security from subversives.
Two victims, although ulti
mately survivors, of that paranoia
were Foreign Service officers John
Emmerson and John Service, who
addressed an overflow crowd of
about 100 at the Lou Henry
Hoover Building Monday night
with their insights on "The State
Dept. and China Policy: A Look
Back." History Prof. Lyman Van
Slyke served as moderator.
Both Service and Emmerson,
who had been stationed in the Far
East during World War 11, were
harassed by internal security
programs years after their stints in
Asia as a result of the fears of
communist infiltration into the
government.
Although Sen. Joseph McCar
thy, Wisconsin Republican from
1947 until his death in 1957, is
popularly considered the ar
chitect of the prevailing paranoia,
Service said McCarthy was a
"Johnny-come-lately" who "sawa
runaway train taking off, jumped
aboard and stoked up the boil
ers.
McCarthyism
"McCarthyism, at least as far as
those of us working in China were
concerned, started before McCar
thy ever showed up on the scene.
It really started when a gentleman
named Patrick Hurley was ap

pointed ambassador to China in
November 1944. It got another big
boost when Hurley resigned as
ambassador a year later in
November 1945 and accused the
Foreign Service generally, and
some of us by name, of having
opposed him, undermined him,
opposed American policy and so
on," Service said.
During Hurley's ambassador
ship, Service was stationed in
Yenan province, a Chinese Com
munist stronghold where Mao
Tse-Tung and the other Com
munist leaders maintained head
quarters. Sent originally to report
on Japanese troop movements,
Service quickly began to send re
ports on the Chinese political
situation.
Emmerson, who spent only a
few months in Yenan, was re
sponsible for studying the
psychology of the Japanese, a job
which involved extensive inter
viewing of Japanese prisoners of
war.
'Who lost China?'
After Mao's takeover in 1949,
the demands for an answer to the
question "who lost China?" be
came the center of the anti
communist attacks of that period.
As Service jokes now, "five
'Johns' lost China. (Fellow Foreign
Service officers) John Carter Vin
cent, John Paton Davies, John
Kenneth Emmerson, John Stewart
Service and, last, but not least,
Chiang Kai-Shek."
Service was forced to leave the
Foreign Service in 1951. He finally
won his reinstatement with a
unanimous decision by the Sup
reme Court in 1957.
Accused
Although he'was never fired,
Emmerson was hounded by the
charges of being a Communist
sympathizer for the rest of his

Foreign Service career. When he
served in Beirut in the late 19505,
Emmerson was accused of trying
to give away the Middle East to the
Communists. The same charge,
this time regarding Africa, was
made when Emmerson later
served in Nigeria. And finally,
when Emmerson was handling the
negotiations that eventually re
sulted in the return of Okinawa to
japan, Emmerson was accused of
"losing Okinawa."
McCarthyism had the effect of
"freezing" American foreign pol
icy, Service said. The honor and
prestige of the Foreign Service
was effectively damaged, he con
tinued. "Perhaps the truly 'best
and brightest' have stayed away.
And that's a price we'll have to pay
for a long time."
But both Service and Emmerson
agree that the country has "sur
vived" McCarthyism. "We ha
ven't torn ourselves apart about
who lost Vietnam," Service said.
"We're apparently not going to
tear ourselves apart over who lost
Iran.
"I don't think there's anything
abroad in the land today that's
quite as virulent and violent and
obscene as McCarthyism. Thank
goodness it's no longer with us."

Foreign Service career. When he
served in Beirut in the late 19505,
Emmerson was accused of trying
to give away the Middle East to the
Communists. The same charge,
this time regarding Africa, was
made when Emmerson later
served in Nigeria. And finally,
when Emmerson was handling the
negotiations that eventually re
sulted in the return of Okinawa to
japan, Emmerson was accused of
"losing Okinawa."
McCarthyism had the effect of
"freezing" American foreign pol
icy, Service said. The honor and
prestige of the Foreign Service
was effectively damaged, he con
tinued. "Perhaps the truly 'best
and brightest' have stayed away.
And that's a price we'll have to pay
for a long time."
But both Service and Emmerson
agree that the country has "sur
vived" McCarthyism. "We ha
ven't torn ourselves apart about
who lost Vietnam," Service said.
"We're apparently not going to
tear ourselves apart over who lost
Iran.
"I don't think there's anything
abroad in the land today that's
quite as virulent and violent and
obscene as McCarthyism. Thank
goodness it's no longer with us."
Although 30 years have passed
since the revolution which made
China communist, the impact of
that revolution on American at
titudes and foreign policy has
lingered long past 1949.
The major component of that
legacy was the paranoia of McCar
thyism — a paranoia that swept
the U.S. government the same
way communism swept China; a
paranoia that was to eventually
claim many victims in an unholy
crusade to ensure American na
tional security from subversives.
Two victims, although ulti
mately survivors, of that paranoia
were Foreign Service officers John
Emmerson and John Service, who
addressed an overflow crowd of
about 100 at the Lou Henry
Hoover Building Monday night
with their insights on "The State
Dept. and China Policy: A Look
Back." History Prof. Lyman Van
Slyke served as moderator.
Both Service and Emmerson,
who had been stationed in the Far
East during World War 11, were
harassed by internal security
programs years after their stints in
Asia as a result of the fears of
communist infiltration into the
government.
Although Sen. Joseph McCar
thy, Wisconsin Republican from
1947 until his death in 1957, is
popularly considered the ar
chitect of the prevailing paranoia,
Service said McCarthy was a
"Johnny-come-lately" who "sawa
runaway train taking off, jumped
aboard and stoked up the boil
ers.
McCarthyism
"McCarthyism, at least as far as
those of us working in China were
concerned, started before McCar
thy ever showed up on the scene.
It really started when a gentleman
named Patrick Hurley was ap

pointed ambassador to China in
November 1944. It got another big
boost when Hurley resigned as
ambassador a year later in
November 1945 and accused the
Foreign Service generally, and
some of us by name, of having
opposed him, undermined him,
opposed American policy and so
on," Service said.
During Hurley's ambassador
ship, Service was stationed in
Yenan province, a Chinese Com
munist stronghold where Mao
Tse-Tung and the other Com
munist leaders maintained head
quarters. Sent originally to report
on Japanese troop movements,
Service quickly began to send re
ports on the Chinese political
situation.
Emmerson, who spent only a
few months in Yenan, was re
sponsible for studying the
psychology of the Japanese, a job
which involved extensive inter
viewing of Japanese prisoners of
war.
'Who lost China?'
After Mao's takeover in 1949,
the demands for an answer to the
question "who lost China?" be
came the center of the anti
communist attacks of that period.
As Service jokes now, "five
'Johns' lost China. (Fellow Foreign
Service officers) John Carter Vin
cent, John Paton Davies, John
Kenneth Emmerson, John Stewart
Service and, last, but not least,
Chiang Kai-Shek."
Service was forced to leave the
Foreign Service in 1951. He finally
won his reinstatement with a
unanimous decision by the Sup
reme Court in 1957.
