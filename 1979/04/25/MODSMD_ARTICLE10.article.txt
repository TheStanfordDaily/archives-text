# Officials blame old system for delays in filling work orders
## 
### Terry Lewis 
Between the Delta Kappa Ep
silon and Kairos houses on
Mayfield Ave. is a basketball
court. Last quarter, its rock
studded surface was randomly
streaked with countless
clover-filled cracks and its
levelness was marred by
numerous dips and mounds. A
makeshift basket dangled from
an unsturdy post. All in all, it
was a fairly uninviting specta
cle to prospective players.
Today the court boasts a
smooth, enlarged blacktop
surface with two professionally
installed baskets. But it didn't
come easily; not by a long
shot.

News analysis

According to house mem
bers, the Dekes submitted a
work order last spring to have
the court repaved. They said
they were promised that the
job would be done over the
summer. When nothing was
done by September, they
submitted another order, but
received no response. They
submitted yet another work
order in early October and
again, no response. In Feb
ruary, the Dekes tried again,
and this time, they followed up
with a constant barrage of re
minders, complaints and in
quiries which directly or indi
rectly resulted in success.
This wasn't the first time the
Dekes have had such prob
lems. Among other things, ac
cording to Deke Richard Boly,
it took an inordinate amount of
time to have a broken window
replaced fall quarter.
The Dekes aren't the only
ones who have had problems
getting things repaired. Nor is
the situation confined solely to
fraternities or even to the Row.
It is something which has

plagued most, if not all, Uni
versity student residences.
The major problem cited by
residence staff and house
managers is an excessive time
lag between the submission of
a work request and the re
sponse to that request. Occa
sionally these lags seem to
have caused or unnecessarily
prolonged safety hazards.
For example, at Roble Hall,
several outdoor lights shorted
out at the beginning of winter
quarter. Several students said
they reported the problem to
the maintenance sections of
Roble and to the residential
system; they were told it would
be fixed the next morning. But
the lights weren't fixed until
several days later and during
those nights, residents' bikes
were vandalized.
The residential staff there is
reluctant to say that the lack of
lighting was directly responsi
ble for the vandalism. But Ar
line Cray, a residence secretary
in Roble Hall said, "I know we
didn't have a problem before
then and we haven't had one
since."
Before January, all residen
tial work orders, about 6000 a
year, were processed through
the Resident Manager's Office,
according to Rob Ramirez,
manager of that office. From
there, the orders were as
signed to a residential mainte
nance shop or, if necessary,
were submitted to the facilities
planning office for further con
sideration.
"But," said Ann Clatzel, act
ing academic facilities coor
dinator, "the Resident Man
ger's Office was understaffed
for the volume of paper it had
to handle. And then, each
order had to be handed to sev
eral people within the office
before being assigned for
work."

It is because of those two fac
tors that residential personnel
have said the system was bog
ged down with delays and
paperwork "falling through
the cracks."
"In any system that requires
approvals, there's always the
chance that a work order will
sit on someone's desk for too
long," Ramirez said.
He explai ned that prior to his
arrival here almost three years
ago, the office was accused of
"jumping too fast and taking
action without consulting all
involved." This was one reason
that the work order system was
initiated. But after a while,
"there were enough com
plaints to indicate that there
was a better way," Ramirez
said.
And so, in January, a new
work order system was
created. Now, all work re
quests go directly to the Work
Control Center at 315 Bonair
Siding which had previously
handled only work requests on
University academic facilities.
In addition to having a larger
resource pool of maintenance
personnel, the Work Control
Center now computerizes
work requests. This practice
seems to have helped out in
several key areas.
"There's been a major im
provement in maintenance re
sponse since January," said
Asst. Director of the Row Diana
Conklin. "Before then, orders
would get 'lost' or delayed and
it was hard to track them
down."
"If someone calls in and asks
about a work order, they can
find out about its status in five
minutes," explained Tom
Mills, manager of maintenance
planning and scheduling. This
new "tracking capability" also
helps to rapidly find recurring
problems so that they can be

given proper attention, he ad
ded.
And since the Work Control
Center now has a more readily
accessible record of buildings
and their conditions, it can he
more active in facilities plan
ning.
"We're working for an effi
cient maintenance service
which includes immediate re-

sponse. And so far we've been
pretty successful," Mills said.
"For instance, when the tire
occurred at the Deke house
last quarter, we did what we
could right awayand had all the
arrangements tied down the
first day.
"The students are our cus
tomers and I feel we should
treat them as such. We try to

keep the buildings operating in
a comfort state," he said.
Another problem cited of
the previous system was the
lack of feedback to the in
itiators of work requests.
"I think that was one of the
main problems with the Dekes'
basketball court," Conklin
said. "I don't think they were
told that it had a low<priority."

"There just wasn't enough
communication back to the
students," Clatzel com
mented. "Nothing's worse
than no answer. It just makes
people angry. Students should
be kept informed about what's
going on and about what's
done and not done. And I think
the new system is making a
good effort toward that."

According to a memo issued
to residential staff, the current
system requires that the in
itiator be told as soon as possi
ble the expected completion
date for the order. If there is to
be a delay, the initiator is to be
informed of the delay and the
reason for it.
Favoritism toward "good"
houses and selective attention
to those houses which "yelled
the loudest" were also cited as
previous, and possibly con
tinuing, problems. Many resi
dential personnel said they felt
that the reputation of a house
or dorm, or the ability of a
house manager to be success
fully aggressive or to get along
with residential adminis
trators, often determines the
acquisition of new furniture or
whether a special project will
be approved.
"I think there's favoritism to
some extent," said Bill Widen,
Deke house manager, "but it's
pretty hard to pin down."
In the fall, despite an end
of-the-year inspection last
spring, many Row houses were
inexplicably short of equip
ment and much of the furnish
ings in their inventories was

substandard. An extreme case
was a 1951 mattress found in
Roth.
Yet while these houses were
striving to attain a basic stan
dard quality of furnishings,
other houses were widening
the gap.
For instance, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon recently installed a
jacuzzi. Although it is a project
for which the residents them
selves supplied the money,
materials and labor, other stu
dents said they feel its approval
was only one of many similar
"successes" for the SAEs.
Ramirez attributed the ap
proval to the SAE's "persis
tence, careful preparation, at
tention to detail and a high re
gard for the bureaucratic pro
cess."
Ed Scoles, director of the
Housing Management Office,
said, "A few years ago there
seemed to be good guys' and
'bad guys,' but I don't think
that's true anymore."
The Resident Manager's Of
fice has an expressed policy of
no favoritism, Ramirez said.
"But as you know, human na
ture is a part of every enter
prise," he added.
