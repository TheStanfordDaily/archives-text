# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial New provost welcomed 
### 
Last week brought some of the best
news from the President's Office for
quite some time. The news was that
Donald Kennedy, the charismatic biol
ogy professor turned Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) commissioner,
will return to the University Aug. 1 as
vice president and provost.
This position, the top academic post in
the University, is vitally important, and
we feel Kennedy is the person for the
job. We laud the selection, and like
everyone else at the University, are "de
lighted" he has agreed to return.
Kennedy has had a fine reputation in
the past as a top researcher and teacher.
In addition, his transformation of the
FDA from an Ineffectual and inefficient
agency with low morale into a vital gov
ernment consumer protection arm, has
resulted in an extension of his reputa
tion to include his fine administrative
skills.
Kennedy will replace William Millet
who served as provost until Jan. 1. Miller
was a fine adminstrator himself, guiding
the University through some tough fi
nancial years, attempting to maintain

program excellence while being forced
to deny budget requests.
Those were tough decisions, and they
took time. As a result, some issues were
relegated to back burners. Though fi
nancial problems still exist, their severity
is not as great now, and so some of these
problems can be addressed.
Among them is the issue of under
graduate education. Kennedy, long
noted for teaching excellence, will cer
tainly fit into a scheme which closely
examines the curriculum and works to
improve the atmosphere for under
graduates here. We were heartened to
hear Kennedy state that undergraduate
education will be one of his top personal
priorities.
Meanwhile, Miller should be proud
that his shoes will be filled by the likes of
Donald Kennedy. Surely that is a com
pliment not many can boast.
Kennedy has personality, scholarship
and foresight. He is an outstanding ap
pointment, and we hope he receives the
support he will need from students, fa
culty and staff.
