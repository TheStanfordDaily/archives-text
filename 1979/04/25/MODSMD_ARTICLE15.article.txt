## Fee assessment judged 
### 
With the results of the Spring Quarter
ASSU election now in, it is clear that the
Daily has again been voted its fee as
sessment by an overwhelming margin,
and I would like to thank the readers
who supported us with their votes.
There are some very cogent argu
ments against the Daily's receipt of a fee
assessment next year, one of which is
that we do have, at least on paper, a
sizeable reserve fund.
But it is my belief that the assessment
is a reasonable request because, for the
Daily to expand and improve, we simply
must make some major purchases. The
reserve fund must remain intact for any
emergencies in regular, daily opera
tions. Thus funding for improvements
must come from the student and Univer
sity bulk subscriptions we sell by means
of the fee assessment, as well as through
continued high advertising revenues.
In any event, I do not believe voters
Avould have supported our request had

they not felt the Daily provides an impor
tant service to the community — worth
at least two cents a day. Since the staff
here puts in as much time as it does, it is
refreshing to know students do feel that
way.
Putting out a paper is a complex busi
ness. And it is tough to understand that
business without a considerable amount
of "hands-on" experience. It is because
of these complexities that some of the
rather distorted remarks about theDa/7y,
made largely by anonymous people just
before the election and without rebuttal
from our staff, were as low and as dis
turbing to some of us as they were. (Iron
ically these critics employed the very tac
tics they accused us of.)
Keeping things in perspective is a
problem we all have. We thank our sup
porters for keeping us in perspective last
week, and we look forward to serving
you better in the future.
