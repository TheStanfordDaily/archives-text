Track denied
This is my opinion on what is
offered for track enthusiasts
here.
I am not on a scholarship, so
I can speak freely.
I was a reasonably good
hammer-thrower back in Fr
ance, but cannot be on the
team here because I am a
graduate student.
The coach has completely re
fused to lend any material to
me so I borrow hammers
from team members from time
to time.
Last week I went to the
stadium in the afternoon and
was expelled: the team is given
priority (and enforces exclusiv
ity) from 2:30 to 6 p.m. There
were at most three people
running at that time and I was
using the fifth lane of the op
posite straight line. There was
no reason to expel me.
The stadium in the morning?
Padlocks everywhere. The
track establishment here not
only doesn't help me at all, but
sometimes prevents me from
enjoying the sport I like.
Champions on the good track
and ordinary people on the dirt
track. Is this a healthy concep
tion of sport? It is not mine.
This could possibly be the
price paid for the great care
taken of our champions. But it
is not. Co to the stadium and
see how many track athletes
have to practice alone. Once a
week the coach happens to
walk by and watches hammer
throwers for 30 seconds with
out a word of advice. I have
seen two hammer contests,
one of them on campus; the
coach never showed up to en
courage or give advice.
Everyone knows that an
athlete without a coach will
never become a real champion
because his technique will re
main rudimentary. Athletes
cost the community; they are
gifted, dedicated and work
hard. Couldn't the University
afford to give the throwers (the
case I'm familiar with) a good
coach, who would have suffi

cient time, be competent and
enjoy coaching?

Having just returned from
Los Angeles as adviser to Stan
ford's student delegation rep
resenting the German Democ
ratic Republic at the Twenty-
Ninth Model United Nations of
the Far West, I believe it impor
tant that the Stanford commun
ity know of the outstanding
work done by that group of
dedicated students.
Under the excellent leader
ship of Laura Martin, the dele
gation prepared itself
thoroughly and took energetic
and leading parts in the many
deliberations and meetings
during the four-day session.
The other students involved
were Judy Deutsch, Steve
Jackson, John McClintic, Mike
McLaughlin, Dick Rose, Jim
Vidano, Ralph Woldow and
Wendy York. They all deserve
recognition for their success in
returning Stanford's represen
tation to a group in which our
students had not taken part
since 1968.

In the wake of the Three Mile
Island nuclear reactor crisis, it
is time for citizens to ask their
elected representatives and
the nuclear power industry to
take a second look at the dan
gers of developing nuclear
power as a source of energy.
The same sort of disaster
could easily take place in
California. The Rancho Seco
reactor, run by the Sacramento
Municipal Utility District, was
built by Babcock & Wilcox, the
same company that built Three
Mile Island, and could suffer
from the same crippling de
fects, including human error.

Pacific Gas & Electric is trying to
obtain a license to operate the
Diablo Canyon reactor in an ac
tive earthquake zone near San
Luis Obispo.
Immediate steps must be
taken to close down these and
all other nuclear installations.
It has been demonstrated
countless times that both the
utility companies and govern
ment officials have deceived
the public about the so-called
"safety" of nuclear energy.
There has been extensive tes
timony by physicists, public
health workers and environ
mentalists on the danger to
public health and safety inhe
rent even in low-level radia
tion, and the much greater
hazards involved when acci
dents happen.
Yet President Jimmy Carter,
Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger, technicians and
others in the pay of power
companies or the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (itself
composed of many people
who formerly were employed
by the very power companies
they are supposed to regulate)
have continued to misrepre
sent the. facts. They maintain
that the United States must
continue to develop nuclear
power to free itself from de
pendence on imported oil.
The price that the public will
have to pay is unacceptable —
greatly increased danger of
leukemia, cancer and genetic
defects; environmental pollu
tion; the unsolved difficulty of
disposing of nuclear wastes;
and the danger of theft of nuc
lear materials.
We have the technology,
human resources, and the will
to develop alternative sources
of energy — remaining fossil
fuels, solar, geothermal and
others. We must begin at once
to develop a comprehensive,
rational energy program, in
cluding conservation, that will
free us from the horrors of rely
ing on nuclear energy.

priority (and enforces exclusiv
ity) from 2:30 to 6 p.m. There
were at most three people
running at that time and I was
using the fifth lane of the op
posite straight line. There was
no reason to expel me.
The stadium in the morning?
Padlocks everywhere. The
track establishment here not
only doesn't help me at all, but
sometimes prevents me from
enjoying the sport I like.
Champions on the good track
and ordinary people on the dirt
track. Is this a healthy concep
tion of sport? It is not mine.
This could possibly be the
price paid for the great care
taken of our champions. But it
is not. Co to the stadium and
see how many track athletes
have to practice alone. Once a
week the coach happens to
walk by and watches hammer
throwers for 30 seconds with
out a word of advice. I have
seen two hammer contests,
one of them on campus; the
coach never showed up to en
courage or give advice.
Everyone knows that an
athlete without a coach will
never become a real champion
because his technique will re
main rudimentary. Athletes
cost the community; they are
gifted, dedicated and work
hard. Couldn't the University
afford to give the throwers (the
case I'm familiar with) a good
coach, who would have suffi

cient time, be competent and
enjoy coaching?

Having just returned from
Los Angeles as adviser to Stan
ford's student delegation rep
resenting the German Democ
ratic Republic at the Twenty-
Ninth Model United Nations of
the Far West, I believe it impor
tant that the Stanford commun
ity know of the outstanding
work done by that group of
dedicated students.
Under the excellent leader
ship of Laura Martin, the dele
gation prepared itself
thoroughly and took energetic
and leading parts in the many
deliberations and meetings
during the four-day session.
The other students involved
were Judy Deutsch, Steve
Jackson, John McClintic, Mike
McLaughlin, Dick Rose, Jim
Vidano, Ralph Woldow and
Wendy York. They all deserve
recognition for their success in
returning Stanford's represen
tation to a group in which our
students had not taken part
since 1968.

In the wake of the Three Mile
Island nuclear reactor crisis, it
is time for citizens to ask their
elected representatives and
the nuclear power industry to
take a second look at the dan
gers of developing nuclear
power as a source of energy.
The same sort of disaster
could easily take place in
California. The Rancho Seco
reactor, run by the Sacramento
Municipal Utility District, was
built by Babcock & Wilcox, the
same company that built Three
Mile Island, and could suffer
from the same crippling de
fects, including human error.

Pacific Gas & Electric is trying to
obtain a license to operate the
Diablo Canyon reactor in an ac
tive earthquake zone near San
Luis Obispo.
Immediate steps must be
taken to close down these and
all other nuclear installations.
It has been demonstrated
countless times that both the
utility companies and govern
ment officials have deceived
the public about the so-called
"safety" of nuclear energy.
There has been extensive tes
timony by physicists, public
health workers and environ
mentalists on the danger to
public health and safety inhe
rent even in low-level radia
tion, and the much greater
hazards involved when acci
dents happen.
Yet President Jimmy Carter,
Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger, technicians and
others in the pay of power
companies or the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (itself
composed of many people
who formerly were employed
by the very power companies
they are supposed to regulate)
have continued to misrepre
sent the. facts. They maintain
that the United States must
continue to develop nuclear
power to free itself from de
pendence on imported oil.
The price that the public will
have to pay is unacceptable —
greatly increased danger of
leukemia, cancer and genetic
defects; environmental pollu
tion; the unsolved difficulty of
disposing of nuclear wastes;
and the danger of theft of nuc
lear materials.
We have the technology,
human resources, and the will
to develop alternative sources
of energy — remaining fossil
fuels, solar, geothermal and
others. We must begin at once
to develop a comprehensive,
rational energy program, in
cluding conservation, that will
free us from the horrors of rely
ing on nuclear energy.

This is my opinion on what is
offered for track enthusiasts
here.
I am not on a scholarship, so
I can speak freely.
I was a reasonably good
hammer-thrower back in Fr
ance, but cannot be on the
team here because I am a
graduate student.
The coach has completely re
fused to lend any material to
me so I borrow hammers
from team members from time
to time.
