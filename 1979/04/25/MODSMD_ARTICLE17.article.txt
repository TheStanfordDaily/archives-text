## Death penalty can increase crime 
### 
Capital punishment, as now
applied (or rather, not
applied), fails to achieve its
presumed societal function of
deterring would-be murderers
from committing heinous
crimes. Although the observa
tion has become hackneyed, it
remains as fact, and for the fol
lowing reasons.
— The death penalty is in
frequently applied. Gary Gil
more was the only man actually
executed in over 12 years in
this country.
— Capital punishment in
volves a legally complex and
unreasonable selection pro
cess to determine the particu
lar criminals who must finally
face death by execution. This
process is not even at best ran
dom.
— Capital punishment has
been administered in a pattern
highly discriminatory to blacks
and other minorities.
— Finally, and most impor
tant, it must be noted that most
murders, crimes for which cap
ital punishment is carried out
most frequently, are acts of
passion. Such acts are commit
ted without lengthy considera
tion of future legal ramifica
tions, committed in the heat
and frenzy of anger.
Because the death penalty is

so rare a form of punishment,
even the cool, deliberate, cal
culating professional murderer
does not often consider the
possibility of his being sub
jected to it when planning a
murder. Criminals run virtually
no risk of getting the death
penalty for committing capital
crimes — so how could the un
likely prospect of such
punishment even enter into a
villain's concerns?
Not only might capital
punishment as a threat to the
potential criminal not deter
that person from his horrible
act, it conceivably could en
courage such a criminal to per
petrate a capital crime — for
example, murder.
A brief application of Freu
dian psychology might be in
order. If death is a society's ac
cepted mode of dealing with
"problem" persons like mur
derers, then such a society (in
its function as a super-ego rep
ressing the id) assumes the
position of a cruel "parent."
This "parent" indoctrinates
and instills its "children" (the
citizens), with a parallel accep
tance of death as a means of
problem-solving. Chilling
support for this analogy lies in
the fact that many murderers

refer to their acts as "execu
tions."
Furthermore, a few isolated
cases can be discovered where
people have engendered a
self-destructive instinct. Be
cause of personal hesitation to
commit suicide, acknowledg
ment of social mores con
demning suicide, or because
of repeated inability to con
summate the act of suicide, a
person can wish to commit a
capital crime because there/s a
possibility that heorshewill be
executed for that crime.
The likelihood of such
punishment is magnified tre
mendously in the mind of this
type of person — far beyond
what reality would justify. But
the state, in such a case, would
be obliged to carry out the act
the criminal had neither the
willpower nor determination to
complete himself.
It is also impossible in any
society which inflicts upon
some restricted portion of its
citizenry such a barbaric act as
the death penalty, to avoid the
killing of some innocent de
fendants (or convicts) by mis
take. Instances are not in
frequent where vindicating
evidence for the defense has
not surfaced until well after

judgment has been passed,
and the punishment of death
met. I
Also, it may be true of a pari
ticular defendant that suffi{
cient evidence had not beeq
submitted during his trial
which could have proved that
he was by all medical defini-r
tions "insane" at the time he
perpetrated the deed. The val
idity of the underlying assump
tion of the need for retribution
against criminals is considera
bly damaged by the possibility
that a person can be executed
for a crime he did not commit.
One should conclude that
because capital punishment
unquestionably fails as a deter
rent, and because it could even
(not only in isolated instances)
result in encouragement of
capital crimes, it should be
abolished. It is no tribute to the
moral standards of society that
the society should kill innocent
or mentally ill people for
crimes they either did not
commit or should not be held
responsible for. Capital
punishment is an unnecessary
horror and a shameful tradi
tion.

Capital punishment, as now
applied (or rather, not
applied), fails to achieve its
presumed societal function of
deterring would-be murderers
from committing heinous
crimes. Although the observa
tion has become hackneyed, it
remains as fact, and for the fol
lowing reasons.
— The death penalty is in
frequently applied. Gary Gil
more was the only man actually
executed in over 12 years in
this country.
— Capital punishment in
volves a legally complex and
unreasonable selection pro
cess to determine the particu
lar criminals who must finally
face death by execution. This
process is not even at best ran
dom.
— Capital punishment has
been administered in a pattern
highly discriminatory to blacks
and other minorities.
— Finally, and most impor
tant, it must be noted that most
murders, crimes for which cap
ital punishment is carried out
most frequently, are acts of
passion. Such acts are commit
ted without lengthy considera
tion of future legal ramifica
tions, committed in the heat
