## Abortion argument unconvincing 
### 
Diane Roulston presents an
honest, well-put, but grievous
argument in her article (Daily,
April 9) that bears the uninten
tionally ironic headline, "Keep
life rights."
Roulston defends abortion
as "a solution to problems
caused by circumstances of
birth arising from biological
and cultural disparities" or
"inequities" between men and
women.
She objects to arguments
that sanction abortion as an
economic tool for cutting
population growth. So do I.
Her notion that prohibitions
against abortion tend to afflict
low-income persons more
than convenienced rich people
cannot easily be doubted.
The unhappiness in a home,
or the suicidal urges in a
mother, that an unexpected
child may aggravate, can make
abortion look like an option
necessary enough to be legally
guaranteed, as Roulston as
serts. She almost persuades
me.
But not quite.
I cannot accept the "biologi
cal perspective" she employs
to justify aborting fetuses, orto
use her term, "diploid indi
viduals." Stating haploid sex
cells are "as alive as we are,"
she deduces that a woman may
view a fetus as "a cancerous
growth or parasite," and
choose to have it removed.
Pardon me. Would Roulston
put a fetus on the level of, say,
a hangnail, to be snipped off
when it irritates? After all,
those skin cells are as alive as
haploid sex cells.
If this reduction of what it
means to be alive is the logical
implication of her argument, as
she seems to admit, then
something in it is fouled up.
Granted, biological differ
ences and cultural accretions
put the brunt of the pain and
stigma for an unwanted pre
gnancy on the woman. Alone
and afraid, a mother may bear a
tragic "hate" for the child she
bore, as Roulston compassion
ately points out.

But abortion cannot heal
hate. Such existing or pro
jected bitterness is evidence of
deeper, inward trouble, not
fully accounted for by "biolog
ical and cultural disparities."
Take the physical side of the
question. Will extrauterine
births or other still
experimental techniques ad
just the biological disparity and
eliminate the inner trouble? I
don't think so. Except in cases
of severe chromosomal aberra
tions, the "anatomy is destiny"
argument does not convince
me.
The cultural disparity, or
double standard, that im
munizes shoulder-shrugging
males against responsibility for
pregnancies is wrong. We
ought to change it. But not in
the abortive direction Roulston
advocates.
We must not pitch abortion
as a "solution" when it is only a
desperate expedient to deter
us from meeting the deeper
trouble not merely in a woman
and her partner, but in the
fiber of our hang-loose,
nature-defying attitudes.
Notice the new mores.
Everywhere cultural analogies
approve abortion. Why not
throw away the fetus once the
pleasure of intercourse is re
ceived, just as we shove the
styrofoam carton off the tray
after gobbling up a quarter
pounder?
Funny how the same type of
plastic sack is knotted up to
dispose of both kinds of re
fuse.
We are tampering with
something greater than ourse
lves in asserting our "right" to
abortion, to this "unnatural
selection" of who will live and
who will not. Sometimes our
"psychology of entitlement"
goes too far.
Of course in the exceptional
case when giving birth may fat
ally injure a mother, an abor

tion may be justified. Still, a
fetus' right to live must almost
always take precedence over a
woman's right to elude stigma.
And let us forget our fore
casts. We do not have the right
to estimate a child's propensity
to live a happy live, and to de
cide that it would be better off
dead.
In short, I believe that a wo
man's seemingly innocent
right to have a fetus aborted
only permits her the freedom
to tyrannize a potential child. It
has not and cannot give her
freedom from all "cultural and
biological disparities."
Functional differences bet
ween the sexes (not "in
equities") are not lamentable

mutations or degrading qual
ities, but the mode of repro
duction that our species is
blessed or stuck with, depend
ing on how you view it.
Abortion is a delicate and
frightful issue. We must be
careful, careful not to desec
rate, but instead to venerate
human life.
Even Roulston's argument
concedes that condemned
fetuses are as alive as we are —
that they, tiny diploids that
they are, have the same right as
we have to breathe.
That is the right, their right,
that we must keep.

ately points out.

But abortion cannot heal
hate. Such existing or pro
jected bitterness is evidence of
deeper, inward trouble, not
fully accounted for by "biolog
ical and cultural disparities."
Take the physical side of the
question. Will extrauterine
births or other still
experimental techniques ad
just the biological disparity and
eliminate the inner trouble? I
don't think so. Except in cases
of severe chromosomal aberra
tions, the "anatomy is destiny"
argument does not convince
me.
The cultural disparity, or
double standard, that im
munizes shoulder-shrugging
males against responsibility for
pregnancies is wrong. We
ought to change it. But not in
the abortive direction Roulston
advocates.
We must not pitch abortion
as a "solution" when it is only a
desperate expedient to deter
us from meeting the deeper
trouble not merely in a woman
and her partner, but in the
fiber of our hang-loose,
nature-defying attitudes.
Notice the new mores.
Everywhere cultural analogies
approve abortion. Why not
throw away the fetus once the
pleasure of intercourse is re
ceived, just as we shove the
styrofoam carton off the tray
after gobbling up a quarter
pounder?
Funny how the same type of
plastic sack is knotted up to
dispose of both kinds of re
fuse.
We are tampering with
something greater than ourse
lves in asserting our "right" to
abortion, to this "unnatural
selection" of who will live and
who will not. Sometimes our
"psychology of entitlement"
goes too far.
Of course in the exceptional
case when giving birth may fat
ally injure a mother, an abor

tion may be justified. Still, a
fetus' right to live must almost
always take precedence over a
woman's right to elude stigma.
And let us forget our fore
casts. We do not have the right
to estimate a child's propensity
to live a happy live, and to de
cide that it would be better off
dead.
In short, I believe that a wo
man's seemingly innocent
right to have a fetus aborted
only permits her the freedom
to tyrannize a potential child. It
has not and cannot give her
freedom from all "cultural and
biological disparities."
Functional differences bet
ween the sexes (not "in
equities") are not lamentable

mutations or degrading qual
ities, but the mode of repro
duction that our species is
blessed or stuck with, depend
ing on how you view it.
Abortion is a delicate and
frightful issue. We must be
careful, careful not to desec
rate, but instead to venerate
human life.
Even Roulston's argument
concedes that condemned
fetuses are as alive as we are —
that they, tiny diploids that
they are, have the same right as
we have to breathe.
That is the right, their right,
that we must keep.

Diane Roulston presents an
honest, well-put, but grievous
argument in her article (Daily,
April 9) that bears the uninten
tionally ironic headline, "Keep
life rights."
Roulston defends abortion
as "a solution to problems
caused by circumstances of
birth arising from biological
and cultural disparities" or
"inequities" between men and
women.
She objects to arguments
that sanction abortion as an
economic tool for cutting
population growth. So do I.
Her notion that prohibitions
against abortion tend to afflict
low-income persons more
than convenienced rich people
cannot easily be doubted.
The unhappiness in a home,
or the suicidal urges in a
mother, that an unexpected
child may aggravate, can make
abortion look like an option
necessary enough to be legally
guaranteed, as Roulston as
serts. She almost persuades
me.
But not quite.
I cannot accept the "biologi
cal perspective" she employs
to justify aborting fetuses, orto
use her term, "diploid indi
viduals." Stating haploid sex
cells are "as alive as we are,"
she deduces that a woman may
view a fetus as "a cancerous
growth or parasite," and
choose to have it removed.
Pardon me. Would Roulston
put a fetus on the level of, say,
a hangnail, to be snipped off
when it irritates? After all,
those skin cells are as alive as
haploid sex cells.
If this reduction of what it
means to be alive is the logical
implication of her argument, as
she seems to admit, then
something in it is fouled up.
Granted, biological differ
ences and cultural accretions
put the brunt of the pain and
stigma for an unwanted pre
gnancy on the woman. Alone
and afraid, a mother may bear a
tragic "hate" for the child she
bore, as Roulston compassion
ately points out.
