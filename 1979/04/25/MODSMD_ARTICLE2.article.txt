Salisbury, Rhodesia (AP) — Bishop
Abel Muzorewa, a U.S.-educated
Methodist clergyman, was elected
the first black prime minister of
Rhodesia yesterday and promised to
try to end the seven-year guerrilla
war that has torn the nation.
In Washington, informed sources
reported that President Jimmy Car
ter's top African policy advisers be
lieve the election was a fraud and in
New York, Andrew Young, U.S. am
bassador to the United Nations, said
he thought the results will not stop
the guerrilla fighting and could lead
to an all-out civil war.
Cracks alliance
The election of the 54-year-old
bishop also cracked the uneasy al
liance among the nation's moderate
black leadership.

And despite Muzorewa's victory,
Rhodesia's major institutions will
remain in the hands of the 230,000-
member white minority in this nation
of 6.7 million blacks.
Whites will retain a major slice of
the parliamentary membership,
holding 28 seats for up to 10 years
that will allow them to block con
stitutional changes. They will also
control the police, military, judiciary
and civil service for five years.
Prime Minister lan Smith will takea
parliamentary seat as leader of the
minority.
Muzorewa, wearing a cleric's col
lar and sporting a beaming smile,
told his supporters that his victory
meant a "rejection of the forces of
darkness and evil," an apparent re-

ference to the guerrilla leadership.
Goal: to end the war
He said his first goal as prime
minister will be to end the war which
has claimed more than 16,000 lives.
He must also convince the interna
tional community to recognize the
elections and drop crippling
economic sanctions against the rebel
colony, declared after Smith broke
with Britain in 1965 over white minor
ity rule.
Muzorewa's United African Na
tional Party swept 51 of the 72 seats
assigned to blacks in the 100-
member national assembly. The 28
white seats were won by Smith's
Rhodesian Front Party in an election
two weeks ago.
The assembly is to take office in

June, when the country will adopt its
African name and become Zim
babwe Rhodesia. The assembly will
be the nation's first black-majority
government after nine decades of
exclusive white rule.
The Rev. Ndabaingi Sithole, one of
three black moderates allied with
Muzorewa in the interim govern
ment, won 12 seats for the Zimbabwe
African National Union. As the re
turns mounted in Muzorewa's favor,
Sithole charged that there were
"gross irregularities" in the five-day
vote.
Many of the 1.8 million voters were
semi-literate peasants who were cast
ing ballots for the first time. Sithole
also claimed security forces had in
timidated his supporters.
