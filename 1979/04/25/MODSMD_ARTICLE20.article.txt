Moscow (AP) — A U.S. news
magazine correspondent's re
port that he had been drugged
unconscious and his wife had
been sexually molested during
a trip to Soviet Central Asia
drew a strong U.S. Embassy
protest to the Soviet Foreign
Ministry on Monday.
A U.S. spokesman said an
embassy officer was sent to the
Soviet Ministry of Foreign Af
fairs to voice a formal protest of
an incident last week involving
Robin Knight, 35-year-old
Moscow correspondent for the
U.S. News and World Report,
and his wife, Jean, 29.
The Knights' report of their
experience in Tashkent, capital
of Soviet Uzbekistan, followed
other recent episodes involv
ing Western correspondents in
Moscow.
Both Knight and his wife are
British subjects, but the U.S.
Embassy took action because
of Knight's accreditation as
correspondent for the Ameri
can news magazine.
A U.S. spokesman said the
embassy expressed its concern

and protested the behavior of
Soviet officials. In response, he
said, Soviet officials "rejected
the embassy's protest with a
version of the events involving
the Knights which the embassy
will not dignify by repeating."
Knight and his wife told this
story of their trip to Tashkent:
They were taken — sup
posedly for a "party" — to a
teahouse on the edge of Tash
kent by a man who said he was
an Intourist guide. They were
greeted by three men who said
they were guides, and two
young women.
The group plied the Knights
with vodka during a 216-hour
wait for food. Knight said he
drank a little but that his wife
does not like vodka and does
not drink.
When the food arrived, new
glasses were used, from which
Knight drank and his wife did
not. He immediately left the
room feeling strange, fell
down on a patio, violently ill,
and passed out.
Ms. Knight said that as soon

as he walked out her hosts
tried physically to force her to
drink her glass, then began
molesting her sexually when
she refused.
She ran screaming from the
room, and found her husband
lying unconscious outside. For
40 minutes she tried to revive
him, without help from their
hosts, who stood and watched.
Then an empty Intourist bus
drove up and took them to
their hotel.
At the hotel, militiamen tried
to drag her still-unconscious
husband away but she fought
them off and got help from
some passing Americans who
were in Tashkent for a confer
ence.
After some difficulties, Ms.
Knight said, she managed to
telephone the American em
bassy in Moscow. Eventually
she was allowed to take him,
still unconscious, to the room.
She said she later was able to
arrange a flight to Moscow for
the next day, when Knight re
covered.
