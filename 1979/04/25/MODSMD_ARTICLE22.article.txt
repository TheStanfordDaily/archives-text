## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Gov.
jerry Brown again yesterday
requested the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC)
to shut the Rancho Seco nuc
lear power plant temporarily in
order to take safety measures.
Brown's first request shortly
after the Three Mile Island ac
cident was turned down. And a
similar request to the,
operators of Rancho Seco, the
Sacramento Municipal Utility
District (SMUD), was also
turned down.
This time, Brown said an
analysis by his own staff of the
Three Mile Island accident
"clearly indicates serious de
ficiencies in the design of the
Babcock and Wilcox reactors."
Brown made the request in a
telegram to Joseph Hendrie,
NRC chairman.
The telegram said, in part,
that design problems "make
the reactor extremely difficult
to control when certain fairly
common problems arise.

"Our analysis indicates the
necessity of substantial design
modifications to insure reliable
performance of the plants and
adequate control of the reactor
and its safety systems."
The Democratic governor
said he is also concerned that
the NRC issued procedural di-J
rectives "intended to compen-?
sate for design and equipment
inadequacies."
SMUD said the directives re-v
quire "a more
policy on automatic shut-;
downs when parts of the sys-?
tem fail, which means they wilt
probably be more frequent. A.'
SMUD spokesman said they!
also require additional training;
of personnel.
Brown concluded, "In light
of these concerns and my re-1
sponsibility for the safety of!
California citizens, I ask that
you temporarily shut down
Rancho Seco pending
thorough analysis, modifica
tion and operator retraining."'
