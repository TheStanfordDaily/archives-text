# Netters to play at Ojai

The Stanford men's and
women's tennis teams will take
a break from dual match com
petition to take part in the an
nual Ojai Intercollegiate and
Open Championships.
In the Men's Intercollegiate
Division Peter Rennert is Stan
ford's top prospect, seeded
third in the event behind USC's
Robert Van't Hof and UCLA's
Fritz Buehning. Lloyd Bourne is
Stanford's only other seeded
player, seeded eighth in the
event. Rennert and Bourne are
seeded third in the doubles.
Jeff Arons drew the toughest
first round opponent in No. 5
seed Mike Harrington of

UCLA. Also entered in the sing
les are Tim Mayotte and Scott
Bondurant.
In doubles Bondurant will
team up with Jim Hodges,
while Arons and Mayotte must
meet Cal's top team, Marty
Davis and Chris Dunk, the
tournament's fourth seed.
In the Women's Intercol
legiate Division the top seeds
are Stanford's Kathy Jordan,
now ranked No. 13 in the wo
men's world rankings, and
USC's Stacy Margolin. The two
have split victories in their first
two meetings of this year.
Also highly seeded is Stan
ford's other entrant, Alycia

Moulton, who has two wins
over USC's Maria Fernandez.
Fernandez, Dana Gilbert of
UCLA and Maria Rothschild of
BYU will provide the toughest
competition for Moulton and
Jordan outside of Margolin.
Because the rules of the
women's intercollegiates don't
allow players to compete in
singles and doubles, Caryn
Hertel and Sue Rasmussen will
compete in the doubles.
In the Open Division Jim
Hodges, Andy Chase and John
Corse will represent the Cards
in singles. Chase and Corse
will team up for the open dou
bles. In the women's open
Susie Hagey and Donna Rubin
will play both singles and dou
bles. Also entered in doubles
are Julia Leighton and Corrine
Nevinny.
The Card women were dealt
a severe blow yesterday in their
quest to repeat as national
champions when three time
Ail-American Diane Morrison
joined the professional ranks.
Morrison, who twice won the
AIAW Doubles Championship
and last year was a finalist, an
nounced that she would be
leaving today for England to
join the women's professional
circuit.
