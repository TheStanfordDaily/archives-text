## Morrison turns pro 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Diane Morrison, four-year varsity tennis veteran and
two-time AIAW Doubles Champion announced her intent to
join the ranks of women's professional tennis yesterday.
Morrison will leave today to spend a month in England,
competing in four women's tennis circuit tournaments
there. She said that in order to be eligible to play in profes
sional tournaments, it is necessary to play in a certain
number of sanctioned tournaments and obtain a com- ;
puterized ranking.
A senior, Morrison has only one class to take to complete
her degree. She said that she intends to remain enrolled ;*
here this quarter, and her professor has agreed to send „
class materials to her through the mail. She said she will <
return in time to take the final and complete the class.
Cardinal coach Anne Gould s a 'd the loss of Morrison '
"will definitely hurt us. although I still think we have a '
chance at the AIAW title." 3
"I have a lot of confidence in the other girls," Gould said.
"I think they can pull together and win."
Gould said the team members were disappointed Morri-'
son was leaving, but that they understood the problem she
faces and the reason she's leaving now, and the general *
feeling is one of "good luck."
Morrison said it is difficult to project how she will com- •
pare with the pros.
"The only way you can tell is by who you've beaten," she
said. "I don't know how I'll do immediately. It's a change ;
and some players freeze up and don't play their own game.;
I don't knowyet how I'll react, but I'm confident that in time
I'll be able to do well." ?
