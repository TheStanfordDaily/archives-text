# Varsity 8 defeats San Diego St., Loyola
## 
### Gray Maxwell 
Two key victories by the
men's varsity 8 highlighted a
big weekend of rowing at Red
wood Shores. Stanford hosted
San Diego State (SDSU), St.
Mary's, Loyola, UC-Davis, Cal
Maritime and Santa Clara over
the weekend and put in a
highly successful showing as
Cardinal boats notched six
firsts, four seconds and a third
in the two days of competition.
In its first crucial test of the
season, the men's varsity 8
showed its mettle in defeating
SDSU by three seats on Satur
day.
In a classic crew race, the
varsity 8-battled SDSU the en
tire length of the 2000-meter
course. Stanford had the
finishing sprint to carry the 8
past SDSU in the final 300 met
ers, winning the struggle with a
time of 6:10.34. SDSU finished
in 6:11.17.
In beating a tough SDSU
crew, the varsity 8 avenged a

loss suffered earlier this season
at the Crew Classic and estab
lished itself as a legitimate
threat to perennial powers
California and Washington.
The JV 8 also put in a sterling
performance on Saturday, de
feating SDSU's JV squad. The
Stanford 8 settled at a solid
33-34 strokes per minute and
blew past SDSU at the 700-
meter mark. The )V 8 crossed
the line in 6:41, comfortably
ahead of SDSU (6:48).
The first frosh 8 split into two
4's to race SDSU's varsity and
novice 4's. The first Stanford 4
moved past SDSU's varsity 4
500 meters into the race and
held off a SDSU sprint to win by
three lengths. The Stanford 4
finished in 7:27 while SDSU's
time was 7:39.
The second 4 had an early
lead over SDSU's novice 4, but
could not maintain it. SDSU
moved past Stanford 500 met
ers into the race and managed
to withstand four furious Car
dinal bids, winning the ex
tremely tight race in 7:29 to
Stanford's 7:33. St. Mary's
novice 4 crossed the line third
(8:04).
Stanford's second frosh 8
competed against St. Mary's

lightweight varsity 8, and was
defeated by open water. St.
Mary's jumped to an early lead
and was able to maintain a
much higher stroke rate, cov
ering the course in 6:59, while
the Cardinal boat finished in
7:13.
The men's crew destroyed
the opposition on Sunday,
picking up three firsts in four
events. A novice 4, taken from
the second frosh 8, never fal
tered in holding off a tenacious
Loyola squad for 2000 meters,
winning in 7:29, three seconds
ahead of Loyola.
The first frosh 8, rowing to
gether for the first time in over
a week, crushed Santa Clara by
14 seconds. The freshmen
jumped to an early lead and in
creased it with every "power
10." Despite a fairly strong
head wind, the frosh 8 rowed a
respectable 6:53 to Santa Cla
ra's 7:07.
The JV 8 was a bit flat and
unable to repeat its stellar per
formance of the preceding
day. Consistently overstroked
by Davis and Loyola, a sprint at
the end proved to be too little
too late. Davis won the race in
6:45, Loyola crossed the line
second in 6:46 and Stanford

finished third in 6:54.
The men's varsity 8 extended
its winning streak by defeating
Loyola's varsity 8. Stanford led
from the start and put in a 6:12
despite head winds and steady
rain. Loyola's time was 6:17.
Both frosh coach Mark
Grosenbaugh and varsity
coach Phil Waters were
pleased with the performances
of the men's boats.
Grosenbaugh stated that
"the frosh 8 is really gearing up
and getting faster and more ef
ficient every week."
"We'll definitely be ready for
UCLA and USC next weekend
down in Los Angeles," he said.
"SDSU is definitely a team to
beat, and we beat them. We
are going to surprise a lot of big
boats at the Pac-10 Champion
ships."
The women's crew, plagued
with injuries and illness, saw
limited action over the
weekend, racing only twice on
Sunday. A 4, composed en
tirely of novice oarswomen,
was defeated by Loyola over
1000 meters. The experienced
Loyola crew rowed a 3:48 while
Stanford rowed a 4:06.
The women also entered an 8
in the open 8 event, and the

absence of their only experi
enced oarswoman (team cap
tain Patti Cashman, out with a
back injury) was painfully evi
dent as they lost to Davis. Davis
crossed the line in 3:50 while
Stanford, unable to get a
straight shot at the line,
finished in 4:02.
The women have had little
success this year, but have
made marked improvement
over the course of the season.
Due to their limited number,
virtually all the team members
are forced to compete at least
twice each race day.
This grueling schedule pro
vides them with ample race ex
perience and plenty of condi
tioning. By the end of the sea
son, when the regionals roll
around, the Stanford women
may perhaps be in the best
physical shape of any of the
women's crews around.
Next weekend, the men
head south to Marina del Rey
and Newport Beach to race
UCLA, USC, Irvine and Orange
Coast while the women will be
competing in the Bay Area
Rowing Festival at Lake Merritt.
The crews will next be home on
May 12 to race archrival Cal.

finishing sprint to carry the 8
past SDSU in the final 300 met
ers, winning the struggle with a
time of 6:10.34. SDSU finished
in 6:11.17.
In beating a tough SDSU
crew, the varsity 8 avenged a

loss suffered earlier this season
at the Crew Classic and estab
lished itself as a legitimate
threat to perennial powers
California and Washington.
The JV 8 also put in a sterling
performance on Saturday, de
feating SDSU's JV squad. The
Stanford 8 settled at a solid
33-34 strokes per minute and
blew past SDSU at the 700-
meter mark. The )V 8 crossed
the line in 6:41, comfortably
ahead of SDSU (6:48).
The first frosh 8 split into two
4's to race SDSU's varsity and
novice 4's. The first Stanford 4
moved past SDSU's varsity 4
500 meters into the race and
held off a SDSU sprint to win by
three lengths. The Stanford 4
finished in 7:27 while SDSU's
time was 7:39.
The second 4 had an early
lead over SDSU's novice 4, but
could not maintain it. SDSU
moved past Stanford 500 met
ers into the race and managed
to withstand four furious Car
dinal bids, winning the ex
tremely tight race in 7:29 to
Stanford's 7:33. St. Mary's
novice 4 crossed the line third
(8:04).
Stanford's second frosh 8
competed against St. Mary's

lightweight varsity 8, and was
defeated by open water. St.
Mary's jumped to an early lead
and was able to maintain a
much higher stroke rate, cov
ering the course in 6:59, while
the Cardinal boat finished in
7:13.
The men's crew destroyed
the opposition on Sunday,
picking up three firsts in four
events. A novice 4, taken from
the second frosh 8, never fal
tered in holding off a tenacious
Loyola squad for 2000 meters,
winning in 7:29, three seconds
ahead of Loyola.
The first frosh 8, rowing to
gether for the first time in over
a week, crushed Santa Clara by
14 seconds. The freshmen
jumped to an early lead and in
creased it with every "power
10." Despite a fairly strong
head wind, the frosh 8 rowed a
respectable 6:53 to Santa Cla
ra's 7:07.
The JV 8 was a bit flat and
unable to repeat its stellar per
formance of the preceding
day. Consistently overstroked
by Davis and Loyola, a sprint at
the end proved to be too little
too late. Davis won the race in
6:45, Loyola crossed the line
second in 6:46 and Stanford

finished third in 6:54.
The men's varsity 8 extended
its winning streak by defeating
Loyola's varsity 8. Stanford led
from the start and put in a 6:12
despite head winds and steady
rain. Loyola's time was 6:17.
Both frosh coach Mark
Grosenbaugh and varsity
coach Phil Waters were
pleased with the performances
of the men's boats.
Grosenbaugh stated that
"the frosh 8 is really gearing up
and getting faster and more ef
ficient every week."
"We'll definitely be ready for
UCLA and USC next weekend
down in Los Angeles," he said.
"SDSU is definitely a team to
beat, and we beat them. We
are going to surprise a lot of big
boats at the Pac-10 Champion
ships."
The women's crew, plagued
with injuries and illness, saw
limited action over the
weekend, racing only twice on
Sunday. A 4, composed en
tirely of novice oarswomen,
was defeated by Loyola over
1000 meters. The experienced
Loyola crew rowed a 3:48 while
Stanford rowed a 4:06.
The women also entered an 8
in the open 8 event, and the

absence of their only experi
enced oarswoman (team cap
tain Patti Cashman, out with a
back injury) was painfully evi
dent as they lost to Davis. Davis
crossed the line in 3:50 while
Stanford, unable to get a
straight shot at the line,
finished in 4:02.
The women have had little
success this year, but have
made marked improvement
over the course of the season.
Due to their limited number,
virtually all the team members
are forced to compete at least
twice each race day.
This grueling schedule pro
vides them with ample race ex
perience and plenty of condi
tioning. By the end of the sea
son, when the regionals roll
around, the Stanford women
may perhaps be in the best
physical shape of any of the
women's crews around.
Next weekend, the men
head south to Marina del Rey
and Newport Beach to race
UCLA, USC, Irvine and Orange
Coast while the women will be
competing in the Bay Area
Rowing Festival at Lake Merritt.
The crews will next be home on
May 12 to race archrival Cal.
Two key victories by the
men's varsity 8 highlighted a
big weekend of rowing at Red
wood Shores. Stanford hosted
San Diego State (SDSU), St.
Mary's, Loyola, UC-Davis, Cal
Maritime and Santa Clara over
the weekend and put in a
highly successful showing as
Cardinal boats notched six
firsts, four seconds and a third
in the two days of competition.
