# Cards take St. Mary's, 9-8

### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
came from behind to edge St.
Mary's 9-8 yesterday afternoon
in non-league play at Sunken
Diamond.
At one point in the game,
Stanford trailed the visitors 7-4.
St. Mary's starting pitcher Rod
Carter had handled the first six
innings of play with relative
ease. Except for Mike

Codiroli's two-run homerun
and Bruce Walters' RBI double
in the third, Carter had hardly
been touched.
In the seventh inning the
powerful offense Stanford has
demonstrated in its last several
outings came alive. With one
out, Phil Wilson doubled and
Codiroli drew a walk. Paul
Zuvella drove Wilson home
and moved Codiroli to third

with a bounding ball up the
middle.
A sacrifice fly by Walters
scored Codiroli and brought
the Cards within one run of
their opponents. But now
there were two outs.
John Pyle wouldn't let the
rally die, however, and belted a
line-drive single into center
field. On that play Zuvella
raced to third and was waved
on to score when the St. Mary's
second baseman mishandled
the throw coming in from the
outfield. Pyle ended up stand
ing on second.
At this time St. Mary's de
cided it was time for some
quick relief, and Steve Sen
teney was called in from the
bullpen.
The Cards still weren't con
tent with the score tied at 7-7,
so shortstop Dave Meier dou
bled to right field scoring Pyle
as the go-ahead run.
Stanford added an insurance
run in the eighth when Wilson
sent a towering homerun over
the fence in straight-away left
field.
That homerun turned out to
be the game-deciding margin
as St. Mary's threatened and
scored once in the final at-bats.
Four Stanford pitchers com
bined to record this as the
team's 28th victory of the sea
son against 17 losses. Senior
staffer Rob Irwin was credited
with the win.
Now the Cardinals gear up
for a crucial series with the
always-tough Trojans in
Southern California this com
ing Thursday, Friday and
Saturday.
A successful series against
USC would make a second
place finish in the Pac-10
Southern Division and a post
season playoff berth a strong
possibility.
