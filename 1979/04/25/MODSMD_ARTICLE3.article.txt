# P.A. man plans H-bomb 'design contest'
## 
### Gayle Mayers 
Charles Hansen, a critic of nuclear
weapons secrecy, announced Mon
day his plans to sponsor a "Hydrogen
Bomb Collegiate Design Contest"
with a $200 prize for the student who
develops a workable H-bomb design.
Hansen, a computer programmer
in Palo Alto, addressed about 30 stu
dents in the SWOPSI class "Bioethics
and the Nuclear Age."
Hansen said that entries for the
competition will be sent to the De
partment of Energy's classification
office for judging. Hansen explained
that any design that is rated top sec
ret and in violation of the Atomic

Energy Act of 1954 will be considered
a winner.
Protest
Hansen said he is organizing the
contest to protest the action taken
last month by government lawyers to
block the publication of an article on
the H-bomb which was to appear in
The Progressive, a Wisconsin-based
magazine.
Hansen said that information con
tained in the Progressive article was
based on an Encyclopedia Americana
article by Dr. Edward Teller, a Hoover
Institute research fellow.
Hansen said that the information
contained in Teller's article was not
cleared by the Atomic Energy Com-

mission.
"The scientists are using classified
information and not being prose
cuted but when the public uses that
information, they are prosecuted â€”
there is a double standard being
applied," he said.
Filing charges
Hansen said he is filing charges
today against Teller for security viola
tions and against the Department of
Energy for criminal neglect.
Hansen is also filing charges of
security violations against Theodore
Taylor of Princeton and George
Rathjens of MIT.
Hansen hopes that the contest will

help publicize the dual security stan
dards that are currently applied by
the government.
Hansen said he plans to place con
test entry forms in advertisements in
college newspapers including the
Daily, and the papers at UC-
Berkeley, Princeton, Cal Tech, MIT,
the University of Alabama and the
University of Wisconsin before the
end of the week.
However, Daily Business Manager
Robert Feren said yesterday he had
not been contacted by Hansen about
placing an advertisement in the
Daily. The ad deadline for Friday's
edition would be today at 2 p.m.
