Senate delays budget cuts
Washington — The Senate voted yesterday
against balancing the federal budget in 1980,
apparently fearing such a move would slow
inflation only by bringing on a recession.
By a 67-22 vote the Senate rejected an
amendmentbySen. William Proxmire(D-Wis.)
that would have slashed another $28.8 billion
from the 5532.4-billion budget recommended
by the Budget Committee.
The vote, coming in the face of public de
mands for less spending, means only that the
Senate does not think a balanced budget in
fiscal year 1980 — the 12 months beginning
next Oct. 1 — is feasible. Senators will decide
later in the week whether to go on record now
in favor of balanced budgets in 1981 and 1982.
Iran's leaders escape grenade
Tehran, Iran — Revolutionary militiamen
foiled an assassination attempt against Prime
Minister Mehdi Bazargan and other top gov
ernment leaders yesterday, witnesses said.
They said the militiamen wrested a hand
grenade from a man who tried to throw it at the
leaders and kicked him to the ground as he
attempted unsuccessfully to fire a sub
machine gun. Militiamen hustled the 72-year
old Bazargan to safety and took the uniden
tified attacker and at least one other person
into custody, they said.
Bazargan and other leaders of the provi
sional revolutionary government were march
ing in the funeral procession of murdered
Gen. Mohammad Vali Charani when the attack
took place.
Charani, the first army chief of staff ap
pointed after last February's revolution, was
killed in his garden Monday by two assassins
who escaped. He was the first major figure of
the revolution to be assassinated.
A government aide denied to reporters that
an assassination attempt against Bazargan had
taken place. But reporters saw the disarming of
the unidentified man who, they said, wore an
air force uniform, and saw him and at least one
other person taken into custody.

There was no immediate explanation of the
attack on the prime minister who in recent
weeks has been soft-pedaling his criticism of
the executions by Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini's revolutionary courts.
Israeli attack imperils treaty
Israel pounded Palestinian strongholds in
Lebanon by air and sea yesterday. Egypt de
nounced the attacks and said they could hurt
the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
Israeli jets hit Palestinian positions north of
the Litani River in southern Lebanon hours
after naval gunboats ended a two-day attack on
coastal targets near the Lebanese port of Tyre,
the Israeli military command said.
Israel said the area was the launching point
for Sunday's Palestinian terror attack in the
Israeli resort town of Nahariya in which four
Israelis died.
Egypt said the Israeli attacks could have a
negative effect on implementation of the
Israeli-Egyptian treaty signed March 26.
The Egyptian statement deplored the cycle
of violence between Israel and the Palesti
nians, but did not condemn the Palestinians
terror strike at Nahariya, which is believed to
have sparked the Israeli response.
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry statement
also condemned Israel's decision to establish
two new settlements in the occupied West
Bank of the Jordan River.
An Israeli communique said the warplanes
hit Palestinian artillery and rocket emplace
ments near Beaufort Castle and the towns
Nabatiyeh and Arnoun, 20 miles inland from
the earlier coastal targets.
Palestinian guerrillas said Israel started
pushing "columns of tanks and armored vehi
cles"
Red River flood worsens
Clay dikes protecting the sister cities of
Grand Forks, N.D., and East Grand Forks,
Minn., turned mushy under heavy rain yester
day and flood fighters routed more residents
threatened by the Red River's worst flood this

century.
"The situation is worsening," said Bob Nor
lund, a hydrologist for the National Weather
Service as the river continued to surge through
the area at about 20 feet above flood stage and
just about a foot below the brim of the
weakened make-shift levees.
The Red Cross has opened eight emergency
care shelters along a 200-mile stretch of the
river and is feeding 6000 dike workers and
flood victims each day, said Jackie McCarty, a
spokeswoman for the organization.
Toting up flood losses so far in the flat and
sprawling farmlands of the Red River Valley,
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers put the cost
at more than $26 million.
CHP radars forbidden again
Sacramento — California apparently will re
main the only state in the nation without a
radar-style system for catching freeway speed
ers following committee action yesterday kil
ling a radar measure.
The Assembly Transportation Committee,
after denunciations of "Gestapo tactics" and
"overkill," voted 7-3 to send the radar resolu
tion to legislative limbo by setting it for interim
hearing.
The measure, HR 12, would have given legis
lative blessing to a California Highway Patrol
(CHP) application for federal funds to install
radar on 1300 patrol cars, at about $2000 per
car.
California is the only state whose highway
patrol doesn't use some electronic system to
catch speeders. Opponents led by Teamsters
Union truckers have been able to kill similar
measures for several years.
Assemblyman Lou Papan (D-Millbrae) led an
attack on the bill, saying the CHP should con
centrate on helping motorists, not adding to
the 1.1 million speeding tickets it gives each
year.
CHP Commissioner Clen Craig countered
that he did not want to use radar "to write a
tremendous number of tickets." He argued
radar, which Gov. Jerry Brown supports,

would enable him to use statt and gasoline
more effectively.
Voters acquiesce to decontrol
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's ef
forts to decontrol oil prices and tax windfall
profits seem to be gaining grudging approval
from Americans, according to many members
of Congress back from their spring recess.
However, most members interviewed cited
a widespread skepticism among their con
stituents toward both the government and the
oil industry's performance in the energy arena.
This is mixed with a general apprehension
that long lines at service stations may soon be
as inevitable as $1 -a-gallon prices,
The president's proposed windfall profits
tax seems to be scoring points with voters,
many of whom view it as a way to strike back at
oil companies they perceive as greedy, many
lawmakers said.
Now most congressional leaders are predict
ing enactment of the tax, although a fierce
debate is still expected on how to distribute
the revenues. Carter's proposal to use the
money to help poor people pay their fuel bills
and to encourage mass transit is being chal
lenged by Republicans and oil-state Democ
rats,
Oil stocks fuel market rise

vance paced by oil issues and other stocks
