# 70 percent get one of three top choices
## Med School graduates get internships 
### Katherine Brown 
Seventy percent of Medical School
students here graduating in June
matched one of their top three
choices for internships, according to
a Medical Center news release.
Interns are medical school
graduates who are trained under the
supervision of faculty physicians at
clinics and hospitals.
The Med Center statement also
said that the medical students' most
preferred field is internal medicine,
with 41 percent of the graduates
planning to take their internships in
this area of specialization.
During the students' last clinical
year before graduation, a folder con
taining narrative evaluation (clinical
years are graded on a pass/no credit
basis only), faculty recommenda
tions and a dean's letter is sent to the
National Matching Program as the
first step in applying for an intern
ship.
The program matches the studer.t
on the basis of academic record and
career goal, according to Dr. Ken
neth Vosti, associate dean for stu
dent affairs at the Med School.
Passing grade
Eligibility to graduate from medical
school is a prerequisite for the Na
tional Matching Program, he said.
This eligibility status requires a pas
sing grade on both parts I and II of
the National Board Exams.
Asked how the University manages

to match so well despite recent fi
gures which show that 37 percent of
the students failed on part I of the
exam, Vosti explained that while the
students need an overall pass, the
failure mentioned in the figures re
fers only to subsets of part I, which
are taken two years before the folder
must be submitted, and can be reta
ken.
As head of the counseling program
for graduate students here, Vosti
said, "Our philosophy is to first help
students find their competitive
levels."
Optimizing chances
He said he encourages them to
reach a bit above their competitive
position while optimizing their
chances for matching their choices
by selecting a broad range of institu
tions.
The students' applications reflect
their program interest and geog
raphical preference, he said.
' Many students prefer to stay in
one area such as the West Coast. . .
while we suggest to others who have
been at Stanford for their under
graduate and graduate years that ex
posure to a new and different set of
dogma would be profitable," Vosti
said.
One-fifth of the internships of
fered by the Med Center itself were
awarded to its own graduate stu
dents. Vosti indicated this was a
"reasonably constant proportion" of

students continuing from Stanford's
graduate school.
The applications received by tne
Med Center are reviewed by a seven
to eight-person internship Selection
Committee, Vosti said, adding that
equal emphasis is placed on the
dean's letter, the personal interview
and faculty recommendations. Ulti
mately, the reviewers try to obtain a
group of students from differing

backgrounds and dogmatic experi
ences, he said.
The preference shown by students
for internal medicine allows greater
flexibility in decisions concerning
postdoctoral fellowships, according
to Vosti. He said internal medicine is
the crux of clinical training which
provides a wide range of non
surgical challenges to medical stu
dents.
