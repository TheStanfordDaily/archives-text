# Unemployment rate lower for Stanford humanities Ph.D.s
## 
### Fran Miller 
In search of a job, doctoral students in the
humanities tread a long path which can all too often
lead to a dead end â€” unemployment.
Although all is not roses for Ph.D.s here, overall
unemployment is low and faculty placement for
humanities doctorates has been about 60 percent, a
figure with which Religious Studies Dept. chairman
William Clebsch said he was pleased. Clebsch attri
butes this figure to a drastic cutback in enrollment in
some graduate humanities programs, thereby allow
ing for "more intense training."
The Religious Studies program, which began a de
cade ago, is "intentionally very small," said Clebsch.
"Ph.D.s should be measured in quality, not quan
tity."
Although the attrition rate is very high in this prog
ram and every student has been placed so far,
Clebsch said that "we can't guarantee that there will
be jobs at the end. There was one 30-year period
(1940-1970) in which earning a Ph.D. meant getting a
job. Education is no longer a growth stock."
Despairing thoughts such as "Anybody knows the
job situation is miserable" and "You're told on all
sides that the job market is bleak" come from diffe
rent doctoral students in the humanities who share a
common concern: the declining need for Ph.D.s in
such areas as English, philosophy, classics, religious
studies, political science and history.
Faculty placement
How justified are these students in worrying about

the job market? How does Stanford's job placement
record measure up to other universities?
Although figures vary among departments, actual
faculty placement has generally been around 60 per
cent, except for the period 1974-1975, when nearly 75
percent received faculty positions.
Overall employment (not necessarily in teaching)
remains high, with only about 4 percent of the docto
rates unemployed, a figure which has remained con
stant since around 1977. (During the period 1973-
1974, unemployment reached its highest level, shoot
ing to 18 percent).
Large programs rapped
Clebsch faults universities with large graduate
programs in humanities, saying that he believes that
"only one-third of the ablest people who are in
terested in pursuing religious studies and who are
well advanced in all the languages they need before
graduate study should select places that very pre
cisely offer what they need."
The Philosophy Dept. here is also small, accepting
only five or six doctoral students a year out of an
applicant pool of around 100, according to Julius
Moravcsik, director of the department's placement
committee.
Moravcsik said the American Philosophical Associ
ation sends form letters warning prospective doctoral
students about the job market, discouraging them
from pursuing this field.
"Our department makes a big effort to place

people; however, we are beginning to explore non
teaching academic job possibilities," he said.
History, poli sci positions
The University has a remarkably good job record in
history, according to Gavin Langmuir, chairman of
the committee on admissions and fellowships in the
Philosophy Dept. However, he said he would urge
people to think twice about their dedication and abil
ity before pursuing graduate work.
Political Science Dept. chairman John Manley ag
reed, saying that "although the risks are great, it is
still true that those people who are the very best will
get jobs, though it may take longer to find one. There
is still a demand for political scientists," he said, "and
we have expanded the range of acceptable jobs."
According to Manley, the applicant pool has de
clined since the 19605. However, the department still
turns away over 90 percent of its applicants, accepting
only 10 or 11 students per year.
Director of Graduate Placement in English William
Chace expressed disdain toward students who enter
the graduate program purely for the "pleasure of
reading literature." He said he feels that graduate
work should consist of a professional training prog
ram where students are "taught how to teach. You
have to be a lot better now," he said. "The national
situation is very, very bleak."
According to Chace, although job placement in the
English Dept. is "better than average" this year, out of
21 seeking employment, only nine have found jobs.

Vincent Cheng said he considers himself "lucky"
to be one of these nine students to have gotten a job.
He will serve as assistant professor in a tenure tract
position at USC next year.
Disagreeing somewhat with Chace, Cheng said it is
"unhealthy to have real strong ambitions," because it
can be "very disappointing." After graduating from
Harvard, Cheng said he "spent a lot of time reading
and thinking about books. That is no longer a gent
lemanly thing to do, and there are relatively few re
wards."
Cheng cited the timing of his dissertation, the abil
ity to teach a couple of genres, and a vast amount of
teaching experience as significant factors which may
have contributed to his finding a job. Most students
and professors inten/iewed said they believed that
versatility within a field is important when seeking
employment.
Joyce Kinoshita and Davis Baird, both doctoral stu
dents in philosophy, said they are not that worried
about getting a job yet. Baird commented, "The
motivation should be that you can do it and enjoy it
and are willing to put up with suffering."
In contrast to these students, Dan Blickman, a
second-year graduate student in classics, said that
"the main and only reason" he is pursuing a Ph.D. is
that he'd like to teach in the field. "It's impossible to
be confident about a job," he said. "Butyou still hope
you'll get lucky."
