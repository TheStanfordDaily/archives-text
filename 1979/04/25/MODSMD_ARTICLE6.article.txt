# 'If I only had the time'
## UC class helps procrastinators 
### Kathy Sheil 
"I've got to stop putting
things off . . . tomorrow."
Procrastination has been the
subject of numerous jokes,
witticisms and cartoons. Many
people "can relate" to the ex
perience of putting things off
and having to play "catch-up"
occasionally. But for other
people, it is no laughing mat
ter. Continued postponement
can create serious problems.
This kind of problem can be
especially hard to deal with for
students who find themselves
constantly late with assign
ments and always pulling all
nighters in order to write pap
ers and study for tests. They
habitually put off studying and
then sigh, "If only I had the
time. . .
Many students at schools
like UC-Berkeley and Stanford
have this problem to some de
gree. They were among the top
students in their high schools
and could get away with put-

ting things off. But when they
come to college, they are no
longer able to easily maintain
this top status and the con
sequences of procrastinating
are more severe and less easy
to overcome.
Cal's Counseling Center of
fers a workshop to help stu
dents there overcome this
problem.
'Everybody procrastinates'
"Everybody procrastinates,"
said Jane Burka, a staff
psychologist there. "The proc
rastination workshop has a
double focus. It offers be
havioral modification
techniques to help people "get
moving" and it deals with the
psychological issues related to
procrastination, she said.
The workshop is composed
of nine two-hour sessions. Ten
students are currently enrolled
in the program.
"We had brief preliminary
interviews to make sure this
program would fit their

needs," said Burka, adding
that people with this kind of
problem "pretty much recog
nize themselves."
Perfectionists
The students who come to
the program tend to be perfec
tionists, she explained. "They
set their standards very, very
high and this makes their work
almost impossible. They feel
that they have to produce A's
every time."
Because this can be an over
whelming task, they often
don't even start their work. It is
a way of not facing the possibil
ity that they might not live up to
their own strict standards, she
said.
"They have all their eggs in
the academic basket," Burka
continued. "They equate their
grades with their worth as a
person." And by procrastinat
ing, they make sure they never
have enough time to do a good
job, so they can explain away a

poor grade, she added. Burka
deemed this behavior "inap
propriate and irrational."
"But people believe lots of
irrational things," she added.
Burka said that so far the
program, run by Burka and
Amy Weston, also a staff
psychologist, "seems to be
going well." Whether or not it
will continue to be offered de
pends on its end-of-the
quarter evaluation.
There is no course here deal
ing specifically with procrasti
nation, although the Learning
Assistance Center (LAC) does
offer a course in "Effective
Learning Skills." According to
the course syllabus, the class
teaches goal setting, decision
making and self-management,
and how to put these skills into
practice. The LAC class in
volves not only lectures, read
ings and written assignments,
but utilizes peer counseling as
well.
