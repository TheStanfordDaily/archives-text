# 'I am an alcoholic'
## Billy Carter tells condition 
### 
Long Beach (AP) —Billy Car
ter, one of America's most
famous beer drinkers, said
Monday, "I am an al
coholic." He added that
swearing off alcohol was
like giving up "one of my
best friends.
"The toughest part was
when I made up my mind
never to drink again — Cod
knows I gave up one of my
best friends," President
Jimmy Carter's brother told
a news conference at the
U.S. Navy's regional medi
cal center here.
Carter, sporting a new
mustache, said he lost
about 10 pounds, quit
smoking and feels great
after seven weeks at the
hospital's famous Alcohol
Rehabilitation Service. He
said he hopes to be released
this weekend and plans to
return home to Plains, Ga.,
for a month-long rest.
"I am an alcoholic," he

said. "I'm cured as long as I
don't take a drink. If I take a
drink, I'm not cured any
more."
Carter, 41, said he hasn't
had a drink since he
checked into the hospital,
under special authorization
by the Secretary of the
Navy, on March 6.
Carter said the publicity
and pressures of having a
brother in the White House
probably contributed to his
drinking, but "I think I
would have had the prob
lem anyway. I've been
drinking regularly for 20
years. . . I was drinking way
too much."
He also said that he will
pay theentiresl2,loo hospi
tal bill himself.
Carter said he previously
promised to hold a news
conference if local repor
ters let him go through the
treatment program without
requests for interviews.

The president's
"was given no special :j;
privileges of any kind,";}
Capt. Joseph Pursch said of
Carter. "There was no phys- v
ical or mental impairment." :•!
He said Carter's wife, Sy- ;
bil, participated in the prog- •:
ram for about four weeks i
since the therapy works j:
best when the whole family i
is involved.
Pursch said the treatment :
is designed to "get the pa- •
tient in touch with the fact \
he can no longer use al- i
cohol. In daily group •
therapy sessions, he :
learned from other men and •
women who have the same J
disease."
In the past year, the Navy \
program has gotten increas- ]
ing publicity after treating j
such famous patients as ]
former First Lady Betty Ford I
and Sen. Herman Talmadge i
