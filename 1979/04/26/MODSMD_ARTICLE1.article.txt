# Those with 'diversified programs'
## Good jobs open for some BAs 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
"The job market is good for BA
students who have enhanced
their Stanford education by diver
sifying their programs," accord
ing to Ralph Keller, director of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC).
Good entry-level positions are
available to liberal arts students
with bachelor's degrees who have
taken courses outside the tradi
tional liberal arts curriculum, Kel
ler said.
Those who have taken some
mathematics, computer science,
statistics, accounting and
economics have a better chance
of getting a job, he explained. En
gineering BSs, however, still have
the easiest time finding jobs, he ad
ded.
The CPPC is encouraging the
hiring of liberal arts BAs and
employers are interested. Keller
said that MBAs, for example, are
becoming expensive to hire.
Employers can hire two BAs for
the price of one MBA, he said.
They increasingly want to take
bright BAs and train them on the
job. Keller said that students
sometimes work as interns during
their undergraduate years and are
guaranteed a job upon gradua

tion.
Moreover, many MBAs start out
at salaries that are as large as those
for employees who have already
worked for a few years, Keller
said. This can cause a morale
problem, he explained.
Keller said he feels the pros
pects for the future are much bet
ter. Companies are "aware of the
kinds of students admitted to
Stanford in the first place," he
said. They realize there are "sig
nificant differences" between
Stanford students and those from
other institutions.
"That's why lots of recruiters
come. The quality is recognized,"
Keller explained. He also said
grades are not so important for
the backelor's student who is
looking for a job. Companies are
usually more interested in what
the person is like as a human be
ing, Keller said.
The National College Place
ment Council's (CPC) January Sal
ary Survey stated that employers
expected to hire 17 percent more
graduates this year than in 1977-
78. There are 16 percent more of
fers to bachelor's candidates than
in January of last year.
Students in engineering and
scientific disciplines both had a 36
percent increase in the number of

offers. Engineering accounted for
63 percent of total job offers to
those with bachelor's degrees.
Business, marketing and dis
tribution had a 20 percent in
crease in hiring, whereas offers in
accounting and general business
decreased. The CPC predicts a
decrease of 15 percent in jobs "for
which no specific field of study is
required."
As for salary offers at the
bachelor's level, the CPC re
ported that the lead went to pet
roleum engineering with $1788
per month; the lowest dollar av
erage was $911 in humanities and
social sciences.
According to Keller, there are
one million liberal arts students
graduating in the United States
each year. This is five times more
than in 1950 and twice as many as
10 years ago.
Simultaneously there has been
a 6.5 percent increase in jobs for
college educated students. "This
is the first time there are many
more college graduates than
jobs," said Keller.
"It is tough for everyone to find
a job," he said. Today, Keller
explained, jobs are more and
more specialized, and there are
fewer jobs than persons receiving
degrees.

grades are not so important for
the backelor's student who is
looking for a job. Companies are
usually more interested in what
the person is like as a human be
ing, Keller said.
The National College Place
ment Council's (CPC) January Sal
ary Survey stated that employers
expected to hire 17 percent more
graduates this year than in 1977-
78. There are 16 percent more of
fers to bachelor's candidates than
in January of last year.
Students in engineering and
scientific disciplines both had a 36
percent increase in the number of

offers. Engineering accounted for
63 percent of total job offers to
those with bachelor's degrees.
Business, marketing and dis
tribution had a 20 percent in
crease in hiring, whereas offers in
accounting and general business
decreased. The CPC predicts a
decrease of 15 percent in jobs "for
which no specific field of study is
required."
As for salary offers at the
bachelor's level, the CPC re
ported that the lead went to pet
roleum engineering with $1788
per month; the lowest dollar av
erage was $911 in humanities and
social sciences.
According to Keller, there are
one million liberal arts students
graduating in the United States
each year. This is five times more
than in 1950 and twice as many as
10 years ago.
Simultaneously there has been
a 6.5 percent increase in jobs for
college educated students. "This
is the first time there are many
more college graduates than
jobs," said Keller.
"It is tough for everyone to find
a job," he said. Today, Keller
explained, jobs are more and
more specialized, and there are
fewer jobs than persons receiving
degrees.
