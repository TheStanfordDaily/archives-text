## Draft reinforces consumptive life 
### 
Congressman Pete McClos
key's (R-Menlo Park) National
Service bill is a sham. It is a
sugar-coated draft bill that
should be as vehemently op
posed as all the other draft bills
before Congress.
Some type of mandatory ser
vice (not including military ser
vice) may not be such a bad
idea, especially if it is run on a
local level and not by the fed
eral government. But McClos
key's plan will be run by the
generals and everyone knows
what business they are in.
When McCloskey first intro
duced his plan, I favored it. I
believe Americans ought to
have more in common than
they do. In fact, a Los Angeles
Times reporter once remarked
to me, "Americans have only
one thing in common these
days â€” the desire to con
sume."
That desire is promoted
every day in shop windows, in
newspapers and on radio and
television. Consumption is the
very ethos of modern America.
I have often wondered what
could give America a new
ethos, or at least mitigate the
current one.
Along came McCloskey and
his National Service plan. Fi
nally, I thought, Americans

might acquire common ex
periences and values that were
not based on what they were
getting, but on what they were
giving.
I haven't changed my mind
about America needing a new
ethos, but I have about Con
gressman Pete and the draft.
First, however, let me get two
things straight. I do not believe
that the government's power
to draft me is a violation of my
rights. I believe that the com
munity to which I belong has a
legitimate right to expect my
help in defending it.
Also, I am not an isolationist.
I believe we would do more
harm than good by withdraw
ing from our commitments ab
road. It would only encourage
others, with equally bad or
possibly worse intentions than
ours, to intervene.
But let us examine the
reason why the politicians and
generals (and a good many
Americans, it seems) want to
start up the draft again.
We are told that our volun
teer army is not up to scratch.
Our soldiers are dumb and the
ethnic minorities are taking
more than their share of the
burden. Moreover, the armed
forces are not meeting their
quotas.

We need a draft so we can
have smarter soldiers, spread
the responsibility among all
races and ensure a sufficiently
large force. The reason we
must do this is in order to be
more effective in preserving
the "American way of life"
which is being threatened
throughout the world.
What the "American way of
life" means should be clear.
What the generals and the
politicians are working to pre
serve is our ever-increasing
consumption. National service
or the draft or whatever you
want to call it is not the har
binger of a new ethos; it is the
reinforcement of an old one.
Columnist George Will hit it
right on the nose: America's
material prosperity depends
on access to energy and min
eral resources abroad. Will
wants a tougher military stance
to assure that access.
An improving standard of liv
ing keeps the voters happy and
the politicians in office. The
generals stay in business, too,
by making sure that access to
materials which support our
rapacious appetites is not cut
off.
The volunteerarmy has been
trying to defend our access to
these resources. But the gen

erals have told us that a volun
teer army is no longer capable
of doing this. The draft is only
the next step, then. It will give
the military quick and easy ac
cess to the abilities of an entire
population of young men and
women.
If we are not careful, soon
we will be sending men (and
women) overseas again. They
will not be defending liberty
and democracy, but cars with
shiny chrome fenders, color
television sets, stereos, trash
compactors, plastic toys, air
conditioners, heated swim
ming pools, blow dryers and
toasters. In fact, they will de
fend an entire array of things
that cannot be powered or
manufactured without fuel and
raw materials from abroad,
especially from Third World
nations.
The current economic setup
is a raw deal for the Third
World. We know it, they know
it and pretty soon they're going
to do something about it.
When they do, we will likely
have to use military force to
maintain our access to their re
sources.
The example of Organiza
tion of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) should offer
us a good lesson. The Third
World, on whom we increas
ingly rely to support our mate
rial way of life, is not going to
remain subservient forever.
Moreover, many of the re
sources we covet are quickly
running out.
Opposing the current draft
proposals then, is more than
opposing military service. It is
opposing augmentation of the
instruments of force that en
sure our ever-increasing stan
dard of living. I would be wil
ling to fight against political
oppression, but not for the
preservation of stereos and
trash compactors.
Those who oppose the draft
must not say that they wish to
continue to consume as usual,
yet remain unwilling to fight
for it. In the long run they can
not have it both ways.
