## Price-Anderson decried 
### 
Every American should know
the answer to this question: ifa
major nuclear accident were to
occur, who would be liable for
the bulk of the damage? A) the
utility which owns the reactor,
B) the company insuring the
utility or C) the U.S. govern
ment? The answer, known to
surprisingly few of us, is "none
of the above!" '
Thanks to a piece of con
gressional legislation known as
the Price-Anderson Act, pas
sed in 1957, our constitutional
right to just compensation for
damages is suspended in the
event of a nuclear catastrophe.
If a severe accident ever does
occur, the victims will be left
holding the bag.
A study conducted for the
Atomic Energy Commission in

1965 concluded that the im
mediate effects of a reactor ac
cident would be 45,000 people
killed, 100,000 injured,
radioactive contamination of
an area as large as Pennsylvania
and $17 billion in property
damage. The Reactor Safety
Study conducted in 1972 esti
mated there could be 45,000
cancers caused in the 10 to 40
years following an accident
and genetic diseases for five
generations.
The costs outlined above are
enormous. Seventeen billion
dollars in property damage
means one million persons
each losing $17,000. A price
cannot even be put on the long
term health consequences.
The magnitude of potential
damage is so stupendous that

nuclear power is uninsurable.
In fact, insurance companies
refused to touch the nuclear
industry when confronted with
the prospect in the 19505. They
refused to do so until Price-
Anderson was passed. This act
limited compensation for
nuclear-caused damages to
$560 million. Of this amount,
the insurance companies are
responsible for only $140 mill
ion.
If you happen to be one of
the lucky survivors of a $17 bill
ion nuclear accident in your vi
cinity, the prospects that await
you are as follows:
— Your home has either
burned to the ground or been
contaminated by radioactive
fallout, but when you turn to
your homeowner's insurance
policy you find a nuclear exclu
sion provision which relieves
the insurance company of all
liability.
— Congress has declared
your part of the country a disas
ter area, but because this area
is as large as Pennsylvania and
damage is so extensive, the
sum of money offered to you in
settlement amounts to only 25
cents for every dollar you lost.
— Of the $560 million recov
erable under Price-Anderson,
the maximum you can receive
in this case is only 3 cents for
every dollar you lost, but don't
be too optimistic; fees in
volved in making settlements
are all deducted first.
Fifteen years later when you
contract lung cancer from
overexposure to plutonium or
other radioactive elements,
you will not be able to claim
damages because Price-
Anderson stipulated that fed
eral liability shall not exceed a
period of 10 years after the ac
cident.
Can we really believe the
government is concerned with
our health and the health of fu
ture generations? Evidence like
the Price-Anderson Act
suggests that the federal gov
ernment really has only the
prosperity of the nuclear in
dustry in mind.
