# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Vladislav Krasnov West a partner in crime 
### 
Since the Gulag, counting
Stalin's victims in millions sur
prises no one. But did you
know that Western democ
racies made themselves ac
complices of Stalin by deliver
ing to his vengeance about two
million people?
One Tolstoy, a scion of the
famed author of War & Peace,
has described the tragedy in
The Secret Betrayal. Nikolai
Tolstoy's book is a "War &
Peace" of our own time, not as
an artistic novel but as a novel
documentation of how our
war-time ally Stalin conducted
a peace-time war on his way
ward subjects disarmed and
delivered to him by us. Based
largely on recently declassified
American and British informa
tion, the book is the most
well-documented body of evi
dence establishing the West's
culpability in a crime "fully
comparable to the Nazi treat
ment of Jews."
Out of about three million
Soviet citizens who came
under U.S. jurisdiction at the
end of World War 11, a re
corded 2,272,000 were 'repat
riated' to Stalin, many of them
by force, others by guile, still
others 'voluntarily' but only
after we let the Soviet agents
operate freely among them.
Who were these unfortunate
people? Some were con
scripted or lured into the civi
lian labor force, others re
treated with the Germans to
get out of the Stalin rule they
hated. Many Soviet prisoners
of war (POWs) were liberated
from German camps by the Al
lies.
The vast majority of Soviets
on the German side was not
pro-Hitler but rather anti-
Stalin. Among them, General
Vlasov's Russian Liberation
Army, Cossacks, Ukrainians,
Estonians, Tartars and other
nationalists, including 100,000
men from Stalin's native Geor
gia all sought to surrender to

the Western allies to avoid Sta
lin's vengeance.
In the "repatriation" of
people like Vlasov, the
Western powers went out of
their way to cooperate with Sta
lin. In violation of the Hague
convention of POWs they
signed a secret agreement in
Yalta in January 1945. The ag
reement required them to re
turn to Stalin all Soviet citizens.
What is worse, Western pow
ers, in their subservience to
Stalin, went beyond the terms
of the agreement by repatriat
ing men, women and children
"irrespective of their wishes
and by force if necessary."
They also used force and guile
against those who had never
even'been Soviet citizens, thus
delivering to execution Gen
eral Krasnov, a legendary
leader of the Cossacks in the
civil war of 1918-21.
This is an account of the "re
patriation" process at one of
the British camps in Austria:
"Many, perhaps 20 or 30, were
drowned in the waters of the
Drau. A woman doctor . . .
hurled herself in, accom
panied by her whole family:
children, mother and sister. In
a hospital ... a sick Cossack
threw himself from the win
dow to his death when the
troops came for him."
At one of the American re
patriation centers, "Men were
beaten and knocked senseless
with rifle-butts (by American
military police); the altar was
knocked over, ikons were
smashed and religious vest
ments ripped."
Tolstoy lays the blame for the
tragedy chiefly on the British
Foreign Secretary, Anthony
Eden, who "felt for Stalin
strong affection and admira
tion." But he lets George Or
well suggest a deeper reason
for the betrayal, namely, "the
prevalent view of the British
Left that Stalin's Russia was a
truly free and just society." As a

result, when the Foreign Office
issuedagagorderonall public
ity on forced repatriation, the
free press sheepishly obliged.
In the United States the situa
tion improved only after Gen
eral Dwight Eisenhower urged
a reconsideration of the whole
policy in September of 1945.
Tolstoy's book has won vir
tually universal critical acclaim.
Shocked by the brutality and
callousness of their leaders at
the very moment of triumph
over the Nazi barbarianism,
the British public was aroused
to an appeal for a fund to erect
a memorial to the victims of
Yalta.
I do not know if the Ameri
can public will be equally
moved. But if we are, one thing
should never be forgotten:
The victims of Yalta, the
thousands of dead Russians,
Ukrainians, Latvians, Tartars
and others, will not rest in
peace even under the loftiest
of monuments until we take
better care of the living Viet
namese, Laotians and Cambo
dians — the "boat people"
whom we have left desperately
groping for a helping hand in
the turbulent wake of our huge
but rudderless ship of state.
Norwill we restore our pride as
a nation until we do something
to prevent the same fate from
befalling the Thais, Koreans
and Taiwanese.
For as long as our leaders
continue to be mealy-mouthed
about the totalitarian essence
of communism, whether
Soviet or Chinese, we have no
right to look smugly at Eden's
naive admiration for Stalin. For
what are the monuments to the
dead if they don't encourage
us to stand by the living?

Stalin's victims in millions sur

know that Western democ

million people?
One Tolstoy, a scion of the
famed author of War & Peace,
has described the tragedy in
The Secret Betrayal. Nikolai
Tolstoy's book is a "War &
Peace" of our own time, not as
an artistic novel but as a novel
documentation of how our
war-time ally Stalin conducted
a peace-time war on his way
ward subjects disarmed and
delivered to him by us. Based
largely on recently declassified
American and British informa
tion, the book is the most
well-documented body of evi
dence establishing the West's
culpability in a crime "fully
comparable to the Nazi treat
ment of Jews."
Out of about three million
Soviet citizens who came
under U.S. jurisdiction at the
end of World War 11, a re
corded 2,272,000 were 'repat
riated' to Stalin, many of them
by force, others by guile, still
others 'voluntarily' but only
after we let the Soviet agents
operate freely among them.
Who were these unfortunate
people? Some were con
scripted or lured into the civi
lian labor force, others re
treated with the Germans to
get out of the Stalin rule they
hated. Many Soviet prisoners
of war (POWs) were liberated
from German camps by the Al
lies.
The vast majority of Soviets
on the German side was not
pro-Hitler but rather anti-
Stalin. Among them, General
Vlasov's Russian Liberation
Army, Cossacks, Ukrainians,
Estonians, Tartars and other
nationalists, including 100,000
men from Stalin's native Geor
gia all sought to surrender to

the Western allies to avoid Sta
lin's vengeance.
In the "repatriation" of
people like Vlasov, the
Western powers went out of
their way to cooperate with Sta
lin. In violation of the Hague
convention of POWs they
signed a secret agreement in
Yalta in January 1945. The ag
reement required them to re
turn to Stalin all Soviet citizens.
What is worse, Western pow
ers, in their subservience to
Stalin, went beyond the terms
of the agreement by repatriat
ing men, women and children
"irrespective of their wishes
and by force if necessary."
They also used force and guile
against those who had never
even'been Soviet citizens, thus
delivering to execution Gen
eral Krasnov, a legendary
leader of the Cossacks in the
civil war of 1918-21.
This is an account of the "re
patriation" process at one of
the British camps in Austria:
"Many, perhaps 20 or 30, were
drowned in the waters of the
Drau. A woman doctor . . .
hurled herself in, accom
panied by her whole family:
children, mother and sister. In
a hospital ... a sick Cossack
threw himself from the win
dow to his death when the
troops came for him."
At one of the American re
patriation centers, "Men were
beaten and knocked senseless
with rifle-butts (by American
military police); the altar was
knocked over, ikons were
smashed and religious vest
ments ripped."
Tolstoy lays the blame for the
tragedy chiefly on the British
Foreign Secretary, Anthony
Eden, who "felt for Stalin
strong affection and admira
tion." But he lets George Or
well suggest a deeper reason
for the betrayal, namely, "the
