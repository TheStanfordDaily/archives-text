Argument lacking
A. Javier Ergueta's argu
ments for bringing back the
draft (Daily, April 23) are totally
insufficient. So what if he and
many others believe that serv
ing one's country is "a duty,
not an economic choice!" This
does not mean that
Washington should compel
that duty under pain of impris
onment. After all, what may
look like national service to
some (World War I to Wood
row Wilson, Korea to McClos
key, Vietnam to Johnson) may
appear to be bungling inter
ventionism or war crimes to
others.
Ergueta is right to criticize
military recruitment that appe
als only to individuals' narrow
economic interests. But the
way to get ethical considera
tions into our foreign policy is
not to bring back the draft. In
focusing on economic factors,
Ergueta misses one of the
major advantages of the all
volunteer system — it makes
the Pentagon dependent on

the market of individual ethical
opinion as well as the market
for alternative employment.
The ridiculous and disastr
ous foreign policy of the Un
ited States requires a major
overhaul. No more draft is the
kind of Proposition 13 action
which might just bring this ab
out. In particular, the objective
of protecting the American
homeland must be "unbun
dled" from other foreign pol
icy objectives like the defense
of Europe and the protection of
foreign investments.
Defense of Europe should be
turned over to the Western
Europeans. (Together, they
have a population, economy
and technological capability
that more than matches the
USSR.) Protection of overseas
investments should be paid for
by multinational corporations
(not American taxpayers) and
should be subject to unbiased,
extra-national arbitration (not
that of the U.S. government).
The Pentagon's primary mis
sion should be reduced to
keeping foreign governments

from attacking the U.S. main
land. This is not a task that re
quires a large standing army,
much less the draft. Given its
geographical position and the
state of modern technology,
the most effective way for the
U.S. to deal with aggression
against itself is to counterat
tack at sea or through the air.
The least effective is to send
in troops. Standing armies are
for contiguous enemies, but
the United States has none.
Standing armies are for oc
cupying other countries, but
Americans (as opposed to cor
porations) have no reason to
do so.
Not only has Ergueta failed to
make an adequate case for re
sumption of the draft, but in
fact none can be made —
either on moral or economic
grounds. To continue to reg
urgitate Washington prop
aganda, as he does, is only to
help Washington put off the
day of reckoning.
