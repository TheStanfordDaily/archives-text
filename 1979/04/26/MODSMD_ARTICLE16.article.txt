## Nuclear risks differ qualitatively 
### 
Paul Cassell, in his column (Daily, April
18) states that "when all factors are consi
dered . . .it is clear that nuclear power. . .
is the safest option." I suggest that Cassell
has not considered all factors in reaching
this rash conclusion.
Cassell defends nuclear power by as
serting that all forms of energy production
have inherent dangers, some greater than
those of nuclear power. Solar energy
panels might collapse or blades from
windmills might separate, causing injury
or death to workers. He further defends
nuclear power by stating that no one has
ever been killed by a commercial nuclear
power plant but that several people have
been killed or injured during the construc
tion and operation of solar energy plants.
Clearly, however, Cassell has missed
the point of the nuclear energy debate.
The inherent dangers of nuclear energy
and the hazards of soft energy forms, such
as solar or wind power, cannot be quan
titatively compared because they are qual
itatively different.
The damage done by a collapsing solar
panel can hardly be compared to the de
vastation that would be unleashed by a
nuclear reactor meltdown. While dangers
due to structural defects in a solar erlergy
plant would be confined to the plant itself,
the radioactivity of a melting reactor core
could spread far enough to render an en
tire state uninhabitable.

Immediate deaths due to radiation ex
posure would be miniscule compared to
the deaths caused over the next few de
cades due to the development of
radiation-induced cancers. The fact that
this type of accident has not yet occurred
is unimportant. As the situation at Harris
burg, Pennsylvania, earlier this month so
aptly illustrated, reactor meltdowns are
extremely possible and the United States,
or any nation, could hardly tolerate the
extensive destruction that even one reac
tor meltdown would cause.
Cassell ignores the dangers and
economic problems that would remain
even if a fail-safe reactor could be de
signed. The nuclear-power industry has
yet to find a suitable method for the dis
posal of nuclear wastes which, because of
long half-lives and biological concentra
tion, are accumulating rather than dis
sipating within the environment. Current
estimates are that by the year 2000, there
will be enough radioactive waste to con
taminate, beyond maximum allowable
standards, one-eighth of the total amount
of water in the world, including the
oceans.
Finally, even the long-run feasibility of
nuclear power is questionable. Current
light-water reactors use uranium 235 as
fuel, an isotope of uranium whose esti
mated reserves are relatively limited. Fed
eral Power Commission estimates indicate

that uranium 235 reserves could be used
up by 1980 to 1985.
In order to secure nuclear energy as a
viable power source for the future, power
companies then would have to use
breeder reactors which use the relatively
abundant isotope, uranium 238.
Breeder reactors, however, would only
exacerbate the problem of waste disposal.
Breeders create huge amounts of
plutonium, the most toxic substance
known to mdn and the primary compo
nent of atomic bombs. Federal health
standards limit human exposure to
plutonium to a total body burden of only .6
micrograms. It is projected that the United
States will be producing 100 tons annually
by the year 2000 and since the half-life of
plutonium is 24,000 years, this deadly ac
cumulation can never be effectively re
duced.
Beyond the problems of mere disposal,
there is the greater difficulty of keeping
these vast amounts of plutonium out of
the hands of non-nuclear nations and
clandestine terrorist groups.
Cassell, then, has ignored some funda
mental dangers in arriving at his conclu
sion that nuclear power is the safest
energy form of the future. However, as he
himself stated and proved in at least his
own case, "safety has never been the real
issue in the debate."
