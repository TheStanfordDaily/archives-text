## rock/jessica chereskin Roxy Music reunion a treat 
### 
In the dog days of early 70s
rock, Roxy Music was one of
the few musically innovative
bands. Its weave of guitar,
saxophone and synthesizer
evoked a weird, decadent at
mosphere. Brian Eno's avant
garde electronic tones lent a
haunting, futuristic edge to
their sound. Even after he left
the group, their alburns re
mained more experimental
than conventional.

Lead singer Bryan Eerry
fashioned the band's visual
style to match its untraditional
sound. Foremost in his con
ception was the blending of
the romantic with the grotes
que. The teasing album covers
of half-clad pin-up girls, the
vinyl "inflatable dollie" of In
Every Dream Home a Hear
tache, the mannequins gracing
the front of their new LP Man
ifesto, all perverted sexual ide

als. And amid this kinky
glamour Ferry played the
crooning leading man.
Roxy Music's art rock influ
enced a lot of this decade's
musicians, includingthepunks
who took the emphasis on un
orthodox style to a daring ex
treme. So it was a relief to see
last weekend in Oakland that
the masters haven't lost their
touch. After a three-year ab
sence from performing and re
cording as a group, Roxy Music
proved that they can still de
liver a striking show. Their
reunion could have been em
barrassing. Thankfully, it
wasn't.
Bryan Ferry, Phil Manzanara
(guitar), Andy MacKay (sax)
and Paul Thompson (drums)
remain from the original line
up. They all looked older, but
played flawlessly. New bassist
Gary Tibbs fit in well and ap
peared to be having the most
fun of anyone on stage. Only
David Skinner on synthesizer
fell below par; he's no Eno,
and his solos were interminally
boring.
Overall, the well-mixed
selection of old and new songs
was excellent. Gratefully, they
omitted the easier, overplayed
cuts from Manifesto, opting in
stead for the more intricate, in
triguing numbers from the LP's
"East Side," "Trash" and "Still

Falls the Rain" were rendered
magically. Hearing some of
their greatest hits, however,
most excited the frothing fans.
"Editions of You," "Virginia
Plain" and "Love is the Drug"
were some stand-outs.
Resplendent in a red leather
suit, Bryan Ferry cut an elegant
figure at center stage. He
seemed relaxed, but distant
from the audience and haughty
towards his band. His movie
star posturings suggested that
he now wants to be considered
an entertainer instead of just a
rock star. Like Bowie, he's in
suring against the ravages of
time.
The site of the show, the
Oakland Auditorium Arena, is
obviously Bill Graham's latest
attempt to replace Winterland.
While it's larger and cleaner
than the old skating rink, it also
has horrendous acoustics.
Lack of intimacy and good
sound afflicted the people to
wards the back of the cavern
ous hall and detracted from the
overall effect of the concert.
Perhaps it was significant
that the last song Roxy Music
performed, "Re-make/Re
model," was the opening track
on their first album. If the re
made edition of Roxy Music
may no longer be forging new
paths in rock, they still play
outstanding music.
