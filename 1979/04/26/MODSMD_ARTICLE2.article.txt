# Even without Iran posts
## Carter assures U.S. can monitor SALT pact 
### 
New York (AP) — President Jimmy
Carter offered assurances yesterday
that the United States will be able to
detect and quickly respond to any
Soviet cheating on a nuclear
weapons limitation treaty.
"The treaty must — and will be —
verifiable from the day it is signed,"
Carter said in a speech to the Ameri
can Newspaper Publishers Associa
tion.
He said he was concerned with the
loss of two installations in Iran that
had given U.S. monitors a ringside
view of Soviet missile launchings.
But with photographic satellites
and other surveillance systems, he
said, "we are confident that no sig
nificant violation of the treaty could
take place without the United States
detecting it."
Carter gave no indication, mean
while, what is holding up the treaty.
In Washington, Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance met for 50 minutes at
the State Department with Soviet
Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin.
Afterward, Dobrynin said he
would see Vance again. "We just
continued to discuss," he told repor
ters. "I can't say anything about an
announcement, but we will have
another meeting."
State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter, asked to explain the
protracted negotiations, said the two
sides were exploring terms with
"theological intensity."
"It gets more and more difficult
the closer we get," he said.
In his speech, President Carter
asked the publishers to contribute to
the public debate over the treaty. At
the same time, he asked that sensi
tive defense and intelligence secrets,
which the administration is sharing
with Congress, be guarded carefully
"so that the debate does not under
mine our security."

Last week, Jody Powell, the White
House press secretary, accused Sen.
Jake Carn (R-Utah), of leaking inac
curate and distorted information
about U.S. ability to verify Soviet
compliance with a new strategic arms
limitation treaty.
Some critics have questioned U.S.
verification capabilities, particularly
with the loss of the stations in Iran.
They have seized on acknowledge
ments from within the administra
tion that it will take some time to
compensate for the loss.
Carter concentrated on verifica
tion, possibly the most explosive
SALT issue in dispute, in assuring the
publishers that the treaty would
make the United States even more
secure.
"No objective has commanded
more energy and attention in our
negotiations," Carter said. "We have
insisted that the SALT II agreement
be made verifiable."
Following the speech, Carter flew
to New Hampshire to attend a town
meeting and a Democratic fund
raiser in the state that traditionally
leads off the presidential primary
season. He planned to return to
Washington yesterday night.
The chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, John White,
said yesterday that Carter planned to
run in every presidential primary
election in 1980.
Carter said a treaty limiting U.S.
and Soviet strategic bombers and in
tercontinental ballistic missiles
would bring significant reductions in
Soviet strategic forces, greater cer
tainty in U.S. defense planning, flex
ibility to meet U.S. defense needs, a
foundation for further controls on
nuclear and conventional arms, and
self-respect and the earned respect
of the world for a United States
committed to peace.

"Without SALT," Carter said, "the
world would be forced to conclude
that America had chosen confronta
tion rather than cooperation and
peace."
Meanwhile, Gam said Carter was
"misleading the American public in a
desparate attempt to sell an unfair
agreement." He said Carter's state
ments on verification conflicted with
those expressed recently by CIA Di

rector Stansfield Turner and Defense
Secretary Harold Brown.
Turner has been quoted as telling a
secret session of the Senate Intelli
gence Committee that it would take
five years to recover fully the capabil
ity lost with the Iranian stations.
Brown said the ability to verify the
provisions of SALT II would be reco
vered in a year.

the State Department with Soviet
Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin.
Afterward, Dobrynin said he
would see Vance again. "We just
continued to discuss," he told repor
ters. "I can't say anything about an
announcement, but we will have
another meeting."
State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter, asked to explain the
protracted negotiations, said the two
sides were exploring terms with
"theological intensity."
"It gets more and more difficult
the closer we get," he said.
In his speech, President Carter
asked the publishers to contribute to
the public debate over the treaty. At
the same time, he asked that sensi
tive defense and intelligence secrets,
which the administration is sharing
with Congress, be guarded carefully
"so that the debate does not under
mine our security."

Last week, Jody Powell, the White
House press secretary, accused Sen.
Jake Carn (R-Utah), of leaking inac
curate and distorted information
about U.S. ability to verify Soviet
compliance with a new strategic arms
limitation treaty.
Some critics have questioned U.S.
verification capabilities, particularly
with the loss of the stations in Iran.
They have seized on acknowledge
ments from within the administra
tion that it will take some time to
compensate for the loss.
Carter concentrated on verifica
tion, possibly the most explosive
SALT issue in dispute, in assuring the
publishers that the treaty would
make the United States even more
secure.
"No objective has commanded
more energy and attention in our
negotiations," Carter said. "We have
insisted that the SALT II agreement
be made verifiable."
Following the speech, Carter flew
to New Hampshire to attend a town
meeting and a Democratic fund
raiser in the state that traditionally
leads off the presidential primary
season. He planned to return to
Washington yesterday night.
The chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, John White,
said yesterday that Carter planned to
run in every presidential primary
election in 1980.
Carter said a treaty limiting U.S.
and Soviet strategic bombers and in
tercontinental ballistic missiles
would bring significant reductions in
Soviet strategic forces, greater cer
tainty in U.S. defense planning, flex
ibility to meet U.S. defense needs, a
foundation for further controls on
nuclear and conventional arms, and
self-respect and the earned respect
of the world for a United States
committed to peace.

"Without SALT," Carter said, "the
world would be forced to conclude
that America had chosen confronta
tion rather than cooperation and
peace."
Meanwhile, Gam said Carter was
"misleading the American public in a
desparate attempt to sell an unfair
agreement." He said Carter's state
ments on verification conflicted with
those expressed recently by CIA Di

rector Stansfield Turner and Defense
Secretary Harold Brown.
Turner has been quoted as telling a
secret session of the Senate Intelli
gence Committee that it would take
five years to recover fully the capabil
ity lost with the Iranian stations.
Brown said the ability to verify the
provisions of SALT II would be reco
vered in a year.
