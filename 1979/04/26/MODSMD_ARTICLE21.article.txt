## Triple-bill out of synch 
### 
The Deadheads claim that
there has never been a Grateful
Dead concert that has been
rained out, but only the most
faithful could not have been a
little bit worried Sunday when
threatening off-and-on show
ers drizzled on the masses at
San Jose's Spartan Stadium.
The grand occasion was a
triple-bill featuring the Dead,
Charlie Daniels and Greg Kihn
which was an excellent show, if
you want to know, but it prom
ised more than it delivered.
The first problem with the
show was the actual billing it
self. While all three acts put on
good shows, the combination
did not tend to bring the most
receptive audience for any one
of them. It could be argued
that the Dead can play on the
same bill with anybody, and
they proved that Sunday. But
putting Charlie Daniels on the
same bill with Greg Kihn just
didn't seem to work.
At 10 in the morning, Kihn
and his band came out in their
usual nonchalant manner. Un
like their club show, however,
the nonchalance extended into
the show Sunday and many of
the songs carried little en
thusiasm. Usually the high

lights of the show, songs like
"Love's Made a Fool of You"
and "Remember" were played
with obligatory complacency.
Kihn, who showed at Winter
land last December that he can
use those songs to really chal
lenge the headline act, did no
thing of the sort Sunday.
Kihn's frenetic self
Though his versions of "Sec
ret Meetings" and "Museum"
were up to Kihn's normally fre
netic standards, the band only
managed to get the crowd
jumping when they played
Chuck Berry's "Never Stopped
Rockin'." The entire set lasted
for only 45 minutes and there
was no encore.
Besides the impending rain,
there was another reason why
the crowd was less than en
thusiastic about Kihn's per
formance. It soon became evi
dent that a good portion of the
mob was there to see Daniels.
A frenzied ovation greeted
Daniels when he stepped
onstage, and he responded by
delivering an hour and 15 mi
nutes of good times rock and
roll. It was evident, however,
that Charlie Daniels Funk and
Greg Kihn Mania are just not
very compatible. After a strong

set that included especially
good versions of "Trudy" and
"Potion for the Pain," Daniels
returned for a single encore.
And then the Heads came
out of the woodwork.
The merry masters
After IV2 hours of waiting
while the stage crew prepared
for the merry masters of musi
cal maelstrom, the highlight of
the day began. The Dead took
the stage — without Keith or
Donna Godchaux, who have
left the group — and jumped
into a happy version of "Jack
Straw." Their new keyboards
player — who they never in
troduced, despite numerous
pleas from the crowd — was
never very impressive (but
neither was Keith Godchaux
when he was with the group).
During their first set, which
lasted IVi hours, the Dead
played most of their Good
Housekeeping-approved con
cert songs — like "Tennessee
Jed," "Bertha" and "Mama
Tried."
The Dead's second set,
however, was devoted mostly
to head space on "He's Gone"
and other creative endeavors.
The set lasted for two hours
and, after seemingly endless
applause, the group finally re
turned for two encores.
Weir was wailing
Though Jerry Garcia was in
his usual amazing playing form,
jumping from note to note
in his solos like a blind person
Yeading a page of braille, the
most outstanding individual
performance of the day was
turned in by rhythm guitarist
Bob Weir. Whenever the Dead
started to go a little flat —
which happened more than a
fewtimes — Weirwould takeit
upon himself to rally the
troops. His voice was in rare
form, and he took advantage of
it, exciting the crowd with a
vocal display that was compar
able to some of Roger Daltrey's
best efforts.
And as for the guitar, his
chording was good, but his
slide work was amazing — at
times interweaving with Gar
cia's lead in a manner that con
jured up images of a Duane
Allman/Eric Clapton jam.
Overall, the Dead has played
better. But at the time, nobody
really cared about that. The
Dead were onstage, and every
thing was all right.
