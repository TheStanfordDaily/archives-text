## Encina Station hosts funky night with Jeff Lorber Fusion 
### 
Fusion, jazz-rock, funk —
whatever you call it, chances
are a lot of the music you hear
falls into this category. Unfor
tunately, too much of it is banal
and sounds mass-produced.
The Jeff Lorber Fusion how
ever, shows that it is anything
but banal with theiralbum Soft
Space.
Together with guest artists
Chick Corea and Joe Farrell,

Lorber, Dennis Bradford, Terry
Layne, Ron Young and Lester
McFarland create high caliber
fusion without the slick pro
duction that often accom
panies this music.
Lorber himself is no Oscar
Peterson, but he has a good
melodic feel and his solos are
always interesting. "The
Samba," written by Lorber (as
were all the other tunes),

sounds Chick Coreaish and
Corea plays a solo on
minimoog synthesizer that
makes the tune soar. Young's
percussion also makes this one
take off.
Joe Farrell makes his appear
ance on "Katherine," a mellow
tune highlighted by a section in
5/4 time. He strides in on sop
rano sax and immediately
shows why he is one of the best
reedmen today. FarrelPs warm,
pure tone and flowing be
bopish lines blend well with
the group. He is also featured
on flute on "Black Ice," a track
whose melody sounds like a
take-off on a Tom Scott lick.
Again his tone and flowing im
provisations mesh nicely with
the controlled energy of the
group.
Side two opens with "Cur
tains" and Terry Layne's tenor
makes the listener yearn for
some really hot blowing from
this talented saxophonist. This
particular cut features proba
bly Lorber's best improvisa
tions of the session; first on
synthesizer then on a double
time piano solo.
"Proteus" is another tune
based on a simple lick, but the
shifts and changes the rhythm
section makes transforms it
into one of the more involved
tracks on the album. Corea is
again featured on synthesizer
along with Dennis Bradford

whose insistent drumming is
the center of the high, but con
trolled energy of the rhythm
section.
The title track, "Soft Space,"
is the prettiest tune on the al
bum, with Layne and Lorber
doubling the melody on flute
and piano, respectively.
"Swing Funk" is a bass vamp
and bridge with Bradford play-

ing a quasi-swing feel in the
background. Lorber's synth
esizer and electric piano are
heard here in addition to
Layne's earthy tenor sound.
The Jeff Lorber Fusion as
serts itself with this album and
hopefully, establishes high
quality as the criterion for "fu
sion."
(The Jeff Lorber Fusion will ap
pear in concert at Encina Sta
tion on Friday at 8:30 and 10:30
p.m. Tickets are $3.50 in ad
vance, $4 the day of tfie show.)
