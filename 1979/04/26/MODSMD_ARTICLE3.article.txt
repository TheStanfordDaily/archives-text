# State health agency checks out carcinogen complaints
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
A spokesman for the California
Occupational Safety and Health Ad
ministration (COSHA) confirmed
yesterday that the agency has been
investigating possible mishandling
of 19 federally regulated carcinogens
at various locations here, including
the Medical Center.
COSHA Industrial Hygienist John
McCuire said "based on preliminary
observations, there may be viola
tions of some (federal) standards."
He added, however, that he could
not comment on specific observa
tions made here concerning the
cancer-causing agents until the in
vestigation is complete.
"All of our studies have to be or
ganized and accumulated" before
any citations would be made.
McGuire and Larry Wong of COS
HA's occupational carcinogenic unit
conducted an unannounced inspec
tion here in March. The investigation
was prompted by a complaint from
painters working in Escondido Vil
lage, according to United Stanford
Employees (USE) President Mike
Harris, who also accompanied the
health inspectors on their campus
tour.
Whenever residents vacate an Es
condido apartment, the asbestos
covered ceilings are sealed by latex
emitted from high-pressure spray
guns, said USE chief steward Anne
Schlagenhaft. "That is an approved
method, but a lot of debris, dust and
particles contaminated the air," Har
ris said.
"One painter was apparently suf
fering from the effects of asbestos
inhalation," Schlagenhaft said.
After inspecting Escondido Vil
lage, the COSHA team, accom
panied by Harris and University
health and safety officials, checked
the Med Center, where state
registered carcinogens are stored
and used.
Federal law requires that the use of
all regulated carcinogens be re
ported to the head of the state
OSHA, a division of the federal
agency, McGuire said. The location
of the carcinogens and their princi
ple users must be included in the
report.
The standards for use and storage
of carcinogens are almost 100 pages
long and demand accurate record
keeping and rigid monitoring proce
dures. Certain areas equipped with
proper protective respiratory
equipment and ventilation devices
must be available.
Contamination control includes
clear labelling of carcinogenic sub

stances and the use of special clo
thing. Potential users of the materials
are to be trained and informed of
regulations.
Walking through the Med School
laboratories, Harris claimed the in
spectors found "virtually in every
case improper storage or that a drug
wasn't used properly."
Hilary Ryniewicz, the director of
Safety and Security at the Med
Center, said there are approximately
13 sites at the Med Center where car
cinogens are in use. The substances
are "available ingredients for re
search if the need occurs. This is an
item which is not under constant us
age, and the materials are in minute
quantities. We're talking grams," he
said.
COSHA has never before investi
gated the Med Center in connection
with carcinogens, Jean-Guy Bernard,
the occupational health and safety
specialist at the Med Center, said.

By law, COSHA visits are supposed
to be unannounced, Bernard said.
According to Ryniewicz, the COSHA
health inspectors have been on cam
pus twice.
"Thus far, until the investigation is
concluded with an exit (final) confer
ence, we don't know anything"
about the findings or possible viola
tions, Bernard said.
Bernard maintained that the car
cinogenic chemicals are stored in
locked cabinets with limited access.
The facilities are negatively pres
surized relative to outside areas so
that contaminated air cannot flow
outward, he said.
"To my knowledge our effort has
been to make sure that people do
follow the requirements and that
technicians are trained to follow cer
tain procedures," Bernard said. Only
about eight people at the Medical
Center are authorized to use car
cinogens, according to Bernard.

registered carcinogens are stored
and used.
Federal law requires that the use of
all regulated carcinogens be re
ported to the head of the state
OSHA, a division of the federal
agency, McGuire said. The location
of the carcinogens and their princi
ple users must be included in the
report.
The standards for use and storage
of carcinogens are almost 100 pages
long and demand accurate record
keeping and rigid monitoring proce
dures. Certain areas equipped with
proper protective respiratory
equipment and ventilation devices
must be available.
Contamination control includes
clear labelling of carcinogenic sub

stances and the use of special clo
thing. Potential users of the materials
are to be trained and informed of
regulations.
Walking through the Med School
laboratories, Harris claimed the in
spectors found "virtually in every
case improper storage or that a drug
wasn't used properly."
Hilary Ryniewicz, the director of
Safety and Security at the Med
Center, said there are approximately
13 sites at the Med Center where car
cinogens are in use. The substances
are "available ingredients for re
search if the need occurs. This is an
item which is not under constant us
age, and the materials are in minute
quantities. We're talking grams," he
said.
COSHA has never before investi
gated the Med Center in connection
with carcinogens, Jean-Guy Bernard,
the occupational health and safety
specialist at the Med Center, said.

By law, COSHA visits are supposed
to be unannounced, Bernard said.
According to Ryniewicz, the COSHA
health inspectors have been on cam
pus twice.
"Thus far, until the investigation is
concluded with an exit (final) confer
ence, we don't know anything"
about the findings or possible viola
tions, Bernard said.
Bernard maintained that the car
cinogenic chemicals are stored in
locked cabinets with limited access.
The facilities are negatively pres
surized relative to outside areas so
that contaminated air cannot flow
outward, he said.
"To my knowledge our effort has
been to make sure that people do
follow the requirements and that
technicians are trained to follow cer
tain procedures," Bernard said. Only
about eight people at the Medical
Center are authorized to use car
cinogens, according to Bernard.
