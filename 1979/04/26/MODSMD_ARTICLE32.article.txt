Egypt, Israel ratify peace treaty
Israel and Egypt formalized their peace treaty
yesterday deep in the Sinai Desert. In southern
Lebanon, Israeli jets, missile boats and border ar
tillery pounded Palestinian camps, the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) said.
In Um Khashiba, outside an American surveil
lance station, bands played after the exchange of
documents ratifying the historic peace treaty.
A word was missing from an Egyptian side letter
to the treaty and a delay of several hours resulted,
but the document was amended and the cere
mony went on.
In Cairo, Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman
said the PLO should "stop shooting and start talk
ing." He later clarified that and said he was not
suggesting face-to-face talks. The PLO rejected
such talks.
The PLO said Israeli warplanes raided Palesti
nian strongholds and three refugee camps near
Lebanon's southern port city of Tyre, 50 miles from
Beirut after Israel had poured naval missiles and
artillery fire on the area.
The "Voice of Lebanon" radio station of Leba
non's right-wing Phalange Party put yesterday's
casualty toll at 47 dead and 80 wounded. The Pales
tinians said 10 people were killed and 40 wounded.
The PLO said most of the casualties were in
refugee camps around Tyre and in the guerrilla
controlled town of Nabatiyeh, 30 miles inland.
In Beirut, Israeli jets buzzed Yasser Arafat's PLO
headquarters four times and drew heavy anti
aircraft fire. There was panic in the streets as the
jets shook the capital but they did not fire.
Carter's rationing plan rejected
Washington — The House Commerce Commit
tee voted narrowly yesterday to reject President
Jimmy Carter's standby plan for rationing gasoline
by issuing ration checks and coupons to car own
ers.
Carter publicly appealed to committee mem
bers to approve the plan a few hours before the
23-19 vote, but to no avail.
Though the rationing proposal did not die as a
result of the committee's action, ultimate con
gressional approval seems unlikely. The plan will
get another chance before the full House, and a
vote is scheduled in the Senate Energy Committee
today.
In seeking to rescue the rationing plan, Carter
said, "Should serious supply interruptions occur,
America's arsenal of available measures must in
clude contingency plans to ration gasoline and to
mandate conservation by the American public.
"If these standby plans are not passed by the
Congress, the public could rightly ask why their

government was not prepared for an emergency,
particularly after the warning given by the Iranian
supply curtailment," he said in a statement re
leased by the White House.
Critics of Carter's rationing plan said it would
cost too much, unfairly penalize the poor for not
owning two or more cars and cost too much to
administer.
Rationing is one of four standby mandatory con
servation plans voted on by the committee.
NRC wants temporary shutdowns
Washington — The staff of the Nuclear Regulat
ory Commission (NRC) recommended yesterday
temporarily shutting down eight nuclear power
plants designed by Babcock & Wilcox, builder of
the stricken Three Mile Island plant near Harris
burg, Pa.
The five-member commission remained in ses
sion, quizzing staff members, as it prepared to
decide the issue.
Such an order would force the closing of four
Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) plants — Rancho Seco in
California, where the NRC staff says electric relia
bility would not be greatly harmed, and the three
Oconee units in South Carolina, which would re
duce generating reserves to an uncomfortably thin
margin in the Southeast.
In addition to the badly damaged Three Mile
Island Unit 2, which may not reopen for two or
three years, if at all, four other B&W plants have
been shut down by their operators for refueling,
maintenance or safety review. These shutdowns
could be continued by an NRC order.
Harold Denton, NRC director of nuclear reactor
regulation, who said Monday he was "leaning" in
the direction of shutdowns, told the commission
yesterday, "We believe that these plants should be
shut down now."
Deluge ends Florida drought
Residents of the Red River Valley waited nerv
ously behind miles of spongy dikes shored up by 4
million sandbags yesterday, while a record deluge
in Florida flushed out poisonous snakes, washed
through posh resorts and flooded homes and
highways.
"Catfish are swimming down Andrews Av
enue," exclaimed Bob Jones of Fort Lauderdale
after a spring rainstorm suddenly ended a three
month Florida drought, the worst since 1971.
It was the heaviest rainfall in Miami's history,
with the National Weather Service reporting a 24-
hour total of 16.21 inches. Fort Lauderdale re
ported 14.32 inches and Homestead 10.77 with the
rain still falling.
In the flat and sprawling Red River Valley shared
by northern Minnesota and North Dakota, flood

waters at record depths have spread as far as 15
miles wide and 25 miles long in some areas, cover
ing 425,000 acres in North Dakota and 274,000
acres in Minnesota. Entire communities are iso
lated, including 3000 people marooned on The
Point section of East Grand Forks, Minn.
Brown criticizes nuclear policy
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown, in one of his
strongest jabs at President Jimmy Carter to date,
yesterday called on Carter to tell the nuclear in
dustry that the days of nuclear power expansion
are "all over."
The Democratic governor also praised yester
day's recommendation by the staff of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) calling for tempor
ary closure of eight Babcock & Wilcox nuclear
plants.
The NRC staff action yesterday related to reac
tors made by Babcock & Wilcox, the firm that
made the Three Mile Island plant hit by a nuclear
accident recently. One of those plants is Rancho
Seco, located 25 miles southeast of downtown
Sacramento.
At a hastily called news conference, Brown, who
says he may run for President in 1980, repeatedly
criticized Carter's pro-nuclear stance, saying other
energy sources should be explored instead.
". . . It's rather clear to me that the combination
of risks, costs, safety problems, the problem of
storage of waste, the prospect of proliferation and
even the danger of sabotage all combine to make it
imperative that his country now pursue a path of
alternative energy sources," he said.
He said Carter, "far from encouraging a short
circuiting of the licensing process of nuclear reac
tors, should tell the American people and the nuc
lear industry quite simply: 'Enough is enough.' "
Brown refused to say he favored a total ban on
existing plants, focusing instead of halting nuclear
power expansion and building other, safer power
sources in the future.
Stocks rise for fourth day
New York — Oil and gambling issues shared
star-performer billing yesterday as the stock mar
ket struggled to its fourth straight gain.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials man
aged a .60 rise to 867.46, extending its advance
since last Thursday's close to 12.21 points.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 31.75 million
shares, down from 35.54 million Tuesday.
Today's weather
Rain likely today. Chance of showers tomorrow.
Lows in 50s. Highs in mid 60s to mid 70s.
