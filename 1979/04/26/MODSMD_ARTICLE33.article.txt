# Fetal chromosome test developed here
## 
### Matthew Kreps 
University medical researchers
have made a discovery that could
pave the way for a simple blood test
which would determine whether
fetuses have chromosomal defects as
early as 15 weeks into pregnancy.
Such a test, however, is still "prob
ably five years away," according to
Dr. Leonard Herzenburg, professor
of genetics at the Medical School.
Researchers have discovered that
cells from a fetus circulate in a pre
gnant woman's bloodstream some
times as early as 15 weeks into pre
gnancy. Such cells may be able to be
used in a blood testforchromosomal
defects.
Developing such a blood test
would be a tremendous boon to
would-be parents concerned about
possibly having deformed children.
The currently used test, amniocen

tesis, "is an expensive, potentially
risky procedure which is not applied
to the population at large," Herzen
berg explained. While reliable, it
costs about $500, takes between four
and five weeks to produce results,
and can be risky to mother and child
if not performed by a specially
trained obstetrician.
Fluid drawn
Amniocentesis involves inserting a
needle into a pregnant woman's
uterus and drawing fluid from the
amniotic sac in which the fetus floats.
Fetal cells from the fluid are then
analyzed for genetic and
chromosomal defects.
Because of its expense and the
special training needed, amniocen
tesis is presently limited to women at
least 35 years of age who have high
risks of carrying defective children.
But if a reliable blood test could be
developed, it could be universally
applied to women under 35, who
carry the majority of defective
fetuses. It could be given within the
first three months of pregnancy, thus
giving prospective parents time to
decide whether to risk having the
baby or undergo an abortion.
A blood test wouldn't necessarily
replace amniocentesis. "I expect it
(the blood tost) will be best used for
screening," Herzenberg said. "If we
find something suspicious, then it
becomes justifiable to investigate
further with amniocentesis."
Why not known
"We don't know why, or how, the
cells migrate from the baby, through
the placenta, and into the mother,"
Herzenberg said.
