# CIR nixes corporate actions in S. Africa
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
The University's Commission on
Investment Responsibility (CIR)
unanimously recommended yester
day that the University support stoc
kholder proposals which would bar
Ford Motor Co. sales to South Afri
can military and police.
In another unanimous vote, the
group, made up of student, faculty,
staff and alumni, recommended that
the University back a stockholder re
solution which would prohibit U.S.
Steel Corp. from expanding its oper
ations in South Africa.
The recommendations by the 12-
member commission will be consi
dered by the Board of Trustees Select
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility (SCIR) this afternoon in a
nationwide conference call.
Established in February 1978, the
CIR serves as an advisory board to
SCI R which is comprised of members
of the Board of Trustees and some
ex-officio members. SCIR members
make the final decisions for the Uni
versity on stockholders' proposals,
according to Fred Hillier, chairman
of CIR and a professor of operations
research.
Ford and U.S. Steel
According to Hillier the University
owns 163,750 shares of stock in Ford
and 119,700 shares in U.S. Steel.
Proposals or resolutions made by
stockholders are usually presented
to the company and then circulated
among all stockholders three weeks
prior to a company's annual stoc
kholders' meeting. At these meet
ings the resolutions are voted on.
According to Hillier, if 3 to 10 per
cent of the stockholders in a corpora
tion are in favorof a particular resolu
tion the sentiment will be taken very
seriously by managemeht. He said
most resolutions, such as the one
barring Ford sales to the South Afri
can police and military, receive less
than a 3 percent "yes" vote.
Ford stockholders will meet May
10, while U.S. Steel's annual meeting
convenes May 7.
Federal regulations, introduced in
February 1978, prohibit any Ameri

can company from exporting goods
to South African police and military.
However, the regulations do not
prevent subsidiaries of U.S. com
panies in foreign countries from sel
ling equipment to South African
police and military.
'Spirit of the law'
Thus, Ford's foreign affiliates,
which sell goods to the South African
police and military, "violate the spirit
of the law," said Hillier. CIR mem
bers objected that such Ford sales
"constitute direct support of apar
theid," according to Hillier.
At their April 11 meeting, CIR
members also unanimously recom
mended that the University back
shareholder proposals calling for the
withdrawal of Phillips Petroleum
from South Africa if its affiliate, Phil
lips Carbon Black, fails to comply
with the Sullivan principles by the
end of 1979.
In 1977 the Sullivan principles set
forth affirmative action standards for
American corporations operating in
South Africa. According to a CIR re
port, these principles provide for
non-segregation of all races in eat
ing, comfort and work facilities,
equal pay for all employees perform
ing comparable work and fair and
equal employment practices.
Research center
The Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC), a
Washington-based organization es
tablished by the University and other
institutions in 1970, reports that Phil
lips Carbon Black has not desegre
gated its job categories and does not
allow South African blacks to share
locker room, toilet and dining
facilities with whites.
Based on information submitted
by Phillips, the IRRC report also
noted that Phillips Carbon Black has
no blacks in management or super
visory positions.
The Trustee committee, SCIR, de
cided to accept the CIR recommen
dation calling for withdrawal of Phil
lips Petroleum from South Africa if
Phillips Carbon Black fails to comply
with these principles.

to the company and then circulated
among all stockholders three weeks
prior to a company's annual stoc
kholders' meeting. At these meet
ings the resolutions are voted on.
According to Hillier, if 3 to 10 per
cent of the stockholders in a corpora
tion are in favorof a particular resolu
tion the sentiment will be taken very
seriously by managemeht. He said
most resolutions, such as the one
barring Ford sales to the South Afri
can police and military, receive less
than a 3 percent "yes" vote.
Ford stockholders will meet May
10, while U.S. Steel's annual meeting
convenes May 7.
Federal regulations, introduced in
February 1978, prohibit any Ameri

can company from exporting goods
to South African police and military.
However, the regulations do not
prevent subsidiaries of U.S. com
panies in foreign countries from sel
ling equipment to South African
police and military.
'Spirit of the law'
Thus, Ford's foreign affiliates,
which sell goods to the South African
police and military, "violate the spirit
of the law," said Hillier. CIR mem
bers objected that such Ford sales
"constitute direct support of apar
theid," according to Hillier.
At their April 11 meeting, CIR
members also unanimously recom
mended that the University back
shareholder proposals calling for the
withdrawal of Phillips Petroleum
from South Africa if its affiliate, Phil
lips Carbon Black, fails to comply
with the Sullivan principles by the
end of 1979.
In 1977 the Sullivan principles set
forth affirmative action standards for
American corporations operating in
South Africa. According to a CIR re
port, these principles provide for
non-segregation of all races in eat
ing, comfort and work facilities,
equal pay for all employees perform
ing comparable work and fair and
equal employment practices.
Research center
The Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC), a
Washington-based organization es
tablished by the University and other
institutions in 1970, reports that Phil
lips Carbon Black has not desegre
gated its job categories and does not
allow South African blacks to share
locker room, toilet and dining
facilities with whites.
Based on information submitted
by Phillips, the IRRC report also
noted that Phillips Carbon Black has
no blacks in management or super
visory positions.
The Trustee committee, SCIR, de
cided to accept the CIR recommen
dation calling for withdrawal of Phil
lips Petroleum from South Africa if
Phillips Carbon Black fails to comply
with these principles.
