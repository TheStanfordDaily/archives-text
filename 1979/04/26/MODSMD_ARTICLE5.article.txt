## Engineers invent tiny chromatograph 
### Susan Owen 
Electrical engineers here have
come up with a new device, a
pocket-sized gas chromatograph
which can "sniff" the air for poten
tially dangerous vapors and then
sound an alarm.
Both National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) and
the National Institute for Occupa
tional Safety and Health (NIOSH)
have supported the engineers in
their efforts. Their work produced a
miniaturized version of larger
chromatographs now used in chemi
cal laboratories to monitor workers'
exposures to the potentially danger
ous gases.
Stephen Terry, a research as
sociate here, and his graduate assis
tants, Hal Jerman and Soheil Sadaat,
said they expect to deliver half a
dozen prototypes of the device to
NIOSH within a year. The
chromatographs will undergo
further testing, and will then be
ready for final miniaturization, mass
production and distribution at a
price of perhaps $1000 each, Terry
said.

Originally, the tiny gas chromatog
raph was intended for the Viking
spacecraft. It was to sample the Mar
tian atmosphere, Terry said, but it
was not ready in time.
Future space probe
It may be used on a future space
probe that will intercept a comet cal
led Temple II sometime in the mid
1980s. NASA intends to launch a
probe from a shuttle craft equipped
with its own rocket into the tail of the
comet. It will be "a unique chance to
get at a piece of interstellar space,"
Jerman said.
Even if the chromatograph is not
included in the space probe, how
ever, there are still plenty of other
uses envisioned, according to Terry.
Large gas chromatographs are now
used in industrial plants and chemi
cal laboratories in order to monitor
the amounts of chemical vapors an
average worker is exposed to on a
given day.
"What the large chromatographs
don't take into account," said Terry,
"is that workmen walk around. In a
typical plant, large gas chromatog
raphs just sit in a corner."

Now gas chromatographs can be
put in workmen's pockets to check
their exposure to potentially
dangerous gases in all parts of the
plant. If someone happens to stick
their head over a vat of particularly
noxious fumes, the system can also
be tailored to sound an alarm, said
Terry.
Medical applications
The engineers said that the new
device may have some medical ap
plications. Currently, many disor
ders, particularly lung diseases such
as emphysema, can be detected by
monitoring the blood gases with a
gas chromatograph, Terry said. The
new smaller chromatograph could
make this monitoring easier and fas
ter.
Its speed is as unique as its size,
Terry said. The miniature
chromatograph can rely information
in. a few seconds, while its larger
counterpart takes several minutes.
Only a tiny degree of accuracy is sac
rificed, but the gain in speed could
more than compensate in some med
ical emergencies.
"In the case of a heart-attack pa

tient," said Jerman, "a miniature gas
chromatograph will tell you breath
by breath just what's there."
In 1971, Terry said he began his
doctorate project intending to "build
a chromatograph on a wafer." The
"wafer" turned out to be a five
centimeter-wide silicon disc on
which a very fine spiral channel is
etched.
A glass disc is then fitted to the
etched disc to form an enclosed
capillary channel, .2 by .04 millimet
ers wideand, if stretched end toend,
1.5 meters (nearly five feet) long.
Tiny channel
The tiny channel is coated with a
liquid lining which absorbs and re
leases various gases in a sample. This
liquid is propelled through the
channel by helium projected from a
connecting tube.
Each gas interacts with the liquid
lining at a different rate and is thus
separated from the other gases in the
sample. The amount of time it takes
for a particular gas to be "exhaled"
and finally reach the end of the
channel, identifies the gas.
That information is then transmit
ted to a detector and displayed on a
screen which shows a series of peaks
of different sizes and shapes. The
length of the intervals between the
peaks on the chromatography identiy
the gases. Their concentrations
within 10 parts per million can be cal
culated from the areas of the triangu

lar peaks, said Terry.
Jerman is now working on improv
ing and miniaturizing the detector
for the pocket-sized chromatograph.
Sadaat is developing a digital mic
rocomputer which will interpret the
information from the detector and
identify the different gases and con
centrations by the mere touch of a
button.

and finally reach the end of the
channel, identifies the gas.
That information is then transmit
ted to a detector and displayed on a
screen which shows a series of peaks
of different sizes and shapes. The
length of the intervals between the
peaks on the chromatography identiy
the gases. Their concentrations
within 10 parts per million can be cal
culated from the areas of the triangu

lar peaks, said Terry.
Jerman is now working on improv
ing and miniaturizing the detector
for the pocket-sized chromatograph.
Sadaat is developing a digital mic
rocomputer which will interpret the
information from the detector and
identify the different gases and con
centrations by the mere touch of a
button.
Electrical engineers here have
come up with a new device, a
pocket-sized gas chromatograph
which can "sniff" the air for poten
tially dangerous vapors and then
sound an alarm.
Both National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) and
the National Institute for Occupa
tional Safety and Health (NIOSH)
have supported the engineers in
their efforts. Their work produced a
miniaturized version of larger
chromatographs now used in chemi
cal laboratories to monitor workers'
exposures to the potentially danger
ous gases.
Stephen Terry, a research as
sociate here, and his graduate assis
tants, Hal Jerman and Soheil Sadaat,
said they expect to deliver half a
dozen prototypes of the device to
NIOSH within a year. The
chromatographs will undergo
further testing, and will then be
ready for final miniaturization, mass
production and distribution at a
price of perhaps $1000 each, Terry
said.

Originally, the tiny gas chromatog
raph was intended for the Viking
spacecraft. It was to sample the Mar
tian atmosphere, Terry said, but it
was not ready in time.
Future space probe
It may be used on a future space
probe that will intercept a comet cal
led Temple II sometime in the mid
1980s. NASA intends to launch a
probe from a shuttle craft equipped
with its own rocket into the tail of the
comet. It will be "a unique chance to
get at a piece of interstellar space,"
Jerman said.
Even if the chromatograph is not
included in the space probe, how
ever, there are still plenty of other
uses envisioned, according to Terry.
Large gas chromatographs are now
used in industrial plants and chemi
cal laboratories in order to monitor
the amounts of chemical vapors an
average worker is exposed to on a
given day.
"What the large chromatographs
don't take into account," said Terry,
"is that workmen walk around. In a
typical plant, large gas chromatog
raphs just sit in a corner."

Now gas chromatographs can be
put in workmen's pockets to check
their exposure to potentially
dangerous gases in all parts of the
plant. If someone happens to stick
their head over a vat of particularly
noxious fumes, the system can also
be tailored to sound an alarm, said
Terry.
Medical applications
The engineers said that the new
device may have some medical ap
plications. Currently, many disor
ders, particularly lung diseases such
as emphysema, can be detected by
monitoring the blood gases with a
gas chromatograph, Terry said. The
new smaller chromatograph could
make this monitoring easier and fas
ter.
Its speed is as unique as its size,
Terry said. The miniature
chromatograph can rely information
in. a few seconds, while its larger
counterpart takes several minutes.
Only a tiny degree of accuracy is sac
rificed, but the gain in speed could
more than compensate in some med
ical emergencies.
"In the case of a heart-attack pa

tient," said Jerman, "a miniature gas
chromatograph will tell you breath
by breath just what's there."
In 1971, Terry said he began his
doctorate project intending to "build
a chromatograph on a wafer." The
"wafer" turned out to be a five
centimeter-wide silicon disc on
which a very fine spiral channel is
etched.
A glass disc is then fitted to the
etched disc to form an enclosed
capillary channel, .2 by .04 millimet
ers wideand, if stretched end toend,
1.5 meters (nearly five feet) long.
Tiny channel
The tiny channel is coated with a
liquid lining which absorbs and re
leases various gases in a sample. This
liquid is propelled through the
channel by helium projected from a
connecting tube.
Each gas interacts with the liquid
lining at a different rate and is thus
separated from the other gases in the
sample. The amount of time it takes
for a particular gas to be "exhaled"
and finally reach the end of the
channel, identifies the gas.
That information is then transmit
ted to a detector and displayed on a
screen which shows a series of peaks
of different sizes and shapes. The
