# Est claims to make people 'totally loving'
## 
### Katherine Ellison 
"It's going to make you to
tally loving, totally alive, more
energetic and happy. You'll be
on time more. You'll be more
playful — you'll want to play all
the time. Life's going to be a lot
more fun after you take the
training!"
The fervent woman with
Bambi-bright eyes sits ramrod
straight on the edge of her
chair. The 15 members of her
mostly youthful audience lis
ten, hushed and wide-eyed.
This is an Erhard Seminars
Training (est) introductory
seminar.

News analysis

The woman leading the
seminar is Carol Carrola, who
has been a recruiter for est
since she took the training
three years ago.
Most of the people at this
session will sign up laterforthe
$350, two-weekend training
Carrole is describing. These
trainings are held several times
a year in the Bay Area, and on
the average attract about 250
initiates per session.
Est claims approximately
200,000 graduates nationwide.

About 42,000 of these are in the
Bay Area, with slightly greater
numbers in Los Angeles,
where est got its start in 1971.
The est corporation has branch
offices in 26 U.S. cities, as well
as in London and India.
Recruiting successful
The est recruiting drive in
general seems to be success
ful. "Enrollment in est's prog
rams has been steadily increas
ing over the past seven years,
with registration for the est
Standard Training alone now
averaging more than 4000 per
month, an increase of 46 per
cent over last year," claimed an
est brochure.
Annual gross revenues for
the corporation, it continued,
were on the order of
$15 million last year.
Where does all this money
go? Speculation abounds. Ac
cording to est sources, it goes
to expanding est programs and
to grants and charitable dona
tions made through the est
Foundation. But according to
an article in the December
issue of Mother Jones, "Trac
ing the flow of money through
Werner Erhard's est operation
is a bit like watching the flight
of a golf ball on television. The
commentator excitedly shouts
'There it goes!' but all you can

see is an endless fairway and
trees waving in the wind."
Panamanian corporation
When the est training was
first patented by Erhard, it was
sold to a Panamanian corpora
tion which owned it until 1974.
It was then transferred to its
present owner, a Dutch corpo
ration called Welbehagen, B.V.
Est pays royalties to Wel
behagen for use of the est
training process and Welbeha
gen pays only 7 percent in
Dutch taxes on est-earned in
come. Welbehagen sends its
after-tax profits to an est foun
dation headquarters in Swit
zerland, according to est fi
nancial reports In Switzer
land, ownership and tax re
turns are kept private.
Vincent Drucker, an est rep
resentative, explained the mo
tive behind est's intricate mul
tinational financial structure as
simply, "You go where you
have the most freedom to do
what you want to do."
But some who have investi
gated the complex corporate
chain, like Dan Noyes, director
of the Center for Investigative
Reporting (CIR) in Oakland,
claimed the profit motive plays
an even larger role in est than
Drucker admits.

Noyes said, "What Warner
Erhard has done is set up a
structure whereby he avoids as
many taxes as possible. It's a
paper-shuffling of corporate
entities, making it impossible
to know who the owners are."
A check into many of the or
ganizations claimed by est to
be beneficiaries of est Founda
tion grants revealed that there
was a heavy funding of several
parapsychological studies two
years ago, but that many of
these grants have since been
discontinued.
Est has at one time funded
such diverse groups and pro
jects as the United Church of
Christ and the Institute for Ad
vanced Pastoral Studies.
Profs funded
More locally, some est funds
have gone to Psychology Prof.
Karl Pribram for his research on
brain waves, and to Russel Targ
and Harold Puthoff at SRI for
their study of paranormal
phenomena like extrasensory
perception.
Est has donated trainings to
San Quentin, Leavenworth and
Lompoc prisons, several
schools, and to whole com
munities, such as Compton
and Parlier in California.
Est literature also describes
charity projects such as a blood
donation drive in Hawaii and a
national "Hunger Project," of
which the stated aim is "to
communicate that the end of
world hunger is an idea whose
time has come."
Criticism
The latter project has drawn
criticism from reporters like
Suzanne Gordon, whose De
cember article in Mother Jones
called the Hunger Project a
"non-profit publicity arm of
the for-profit est corporation."
"If that were true, a lot of
people would be in jail," coun
tered Drucker. "There's no
physical evidence of an est en
rollment coming out of the
Hunger Project," he claimed.
Est threatened to sue Mother
Jones when the San Francisco
magazine published Cordon's
article last winter, but dropped
the threat soon afterwards.

According to est representa
tives, during a training session,
a leader presents the estian
"data" to the assembled
trainees, who subsist for most
of the 60-hour process on one
meal a day and may leave the
room only for a night of rest
and prescribed bathroom
breaks. Then there is a volun
tary period of "sharing," when
trainees may recount personal
experiences to the group.
By the second Sunday of the
training, according to est pub
lications, new graduates will
have gotten "it," which the lit
erature describes as the ex
perience of "knowing from
your own experience, that
whatever your circumstances,
you have the power to trans-

form the quality of your life at
any moment of time."
"It was just a chance for a lot
of introspection," said indust
rial engineering senior Mide
Wilkey, who took the training
in January. Est is popular
among students here, accord
ing to Wilkey, an ASSU
senator.
Helped insecurity
Wilkey said he took the train
ing because of his interest in
"developmental psychology,
TM and so on." Est's main be
nefit for him, he said, was that
it made him examine "a lot of
things I took for granted, and a
lot of things I was insecure ab
out, like my masculinity."
Not all who participate in est
activities come away with such
enthusiasm. A senior in
economics here said she sat in
on ari est graduate seminar last
year and felt "nervous" and
"intimidated." This, she admit
ted, might have been because
she never took the full training

and was unfamiliar with est's
sometimes confrontational
group techniques.
These techniques, carried
over from the therapy setting
to an energetic recruiting drive
by est graduates, can be un
nerving.
This reporter, after attending
the introductory seminar with
Carrole, received a call three
days later from an est represen
tative, asking, "So, are you
ready to take the training?"
High pressure
After this reporter said she
could not afford the session,
the representative replied,
"Don't you usually get the
things you want when you re
ally want them? I'm telling you,
the training is so wonderful

that to take it, I would sell
things I otherwise would not
sell!"
Critics of est often question
the motives of its 49-year-old
founder and director. Richard
Borough, a clinical
psychologist practicing in Palo
Alto, said he thinks the est
training by itself "can do good
for some people," but finds
Erhard's motives "suspicious."
According to former col
leagues of his, Erhard, nee Jack
Rosenberg, is reported to have
said that in changing his name,
he traded "the Jewish weak
ness for the German strength."
Such reputed comments,
combined with speculation
about Erhard's political ambi
tions, have raised much con
cern.
Purely for money
One Berkeley psychologist,
however, does not share this
concern. Jesse Miller, also a
lecturer at UC-Berkeley, said,
"I think he's in it purely forthe

money. And he's doing a good
job. He's pumping up a lot of
middle-class people who need
pumping up. Who else is doing
it? He's better than Valium and
cheaper than therapy.
"The reason a lot of
psychologists criticize
Warner," Miller added, "is be
cause he's doing the exact
same thing we're doing, and
we make $50 an hour and he
makes $500 an hour. They're
just jealous."
Still, more general fears
about est will probably con
tinue.
Noyes said that his in-depth
investigation of est has led him
to suspect that "est hasn't
clearly represented itself to
people and has created strong
psychological and sociological
dependencies of trainees on
the organization, to the degree
that people don't form any in
dependent judgment about
the world, but adhere to what
Werner says. Many people
look to hi m as a leader and god
like person."
While Noyes added that he
thinks "there are a lot more
serious things to be afraid of
then est," he cautions that the
organization bears watching
for the future.
"As long as society is in gen
eral turmoil, which it has been
for the past 15 years, est and
groups like it will appeal to
people. People become less
certain about what's going on,
and it's a lot easier for some
one to come in and tell them. It
seems to me to be dangerous
to use that confusion and
people's vulnerability to make
them dependent on a way of
thinking."
