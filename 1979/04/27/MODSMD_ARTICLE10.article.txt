Dear Bug Me:
Please settle the controversy of which has the
most caffeine - coffee, tea or coke. How do they
compare to "No-Doz"?
-S.S.
Maxine Anderson, manager of the University
food service, and Robert McCaleb, lab director
for Celestial Seasons Co. in Boulder, Co. re
leased these figures:
"No-Doz," a drug in tablet form, has 100 mg.
of caffeine per tablet, and directions recom
mend taking two pills. Black coffee has about 90
to 120 mg. caffeine per 5 oz. cup, while black tea
and instant coffee each have about 65 to 75 mg.
per cup. Morning Thunder, a tea drinker's sub
stitute for coffee, has about 45 to 55 mg. caffeine
for one tea bag. A cola drink has about 35 to 50
mg. per 12 ounce can. Matte tea, advertised as
the national beverage of Paraguay, Argentina
and Brazil, has 35 to 45 mg. per cup.
Brian Cox, of the Addiction Research Center
in Palo Alto, said that some coffee drinkers may
suffer mild withdrawal symptoms in the morn
ing if they don't get their daily caffeine fix.
Dear Bug Me:
What is the new building going up on Panama
St. between Terman Engineering and Campus
Dr.?
-A.I.
Roger Buckhout, project manager in the

facilities office, said the building will be the new
home of the Stanford Center for Information
Processing (SCIP). It will hold the new IBM
computer that replaces the present model now
in the basement of Encina Hall.
Total cost for the center is about $3 million.

Dear Bug Me:
While driving towards campus on Palm Dr.
about 9:30 one night I saw an unusual animal
amble across the road. I'm almost certain it was
an opossum. Are they native to this part of
California? Or is that impossumable?
-M.R.
Herb Dengler, a naturalist in Portola Valley,
said "We have a pretty good population of them
around here, although they're not natural to the
area."
Opossums were reportedly introduced into
California in the early 1900s. "You seldom see
opossums around here, they're far less likely
than a skunk or a raccoon," Dengler said. Al
though opossum populations are a problem in
other sections of the country, Dengler said the
coyotes and bobcats in the hills exercise some
restraint on the local opossum population.
"There hasn't been a noticeable increase in
their numbers in the last 50 years," he
explained.
