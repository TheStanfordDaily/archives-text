## Some electoral revision needed 
### 
For the past week, charges and
countercharges about the ASSU
elections have once more
abounded. There have been allega
tions of electoral improprieties by
slates running for senior class pres
idents, and the legality of a prop
osed amendment to the ASSU Con
stitution has been questioned.
Before proceeding, we would
like to state that, all problems not
withstanding, this election was
handled better than many of its
predecessors. However, we feel
that in the future, some election
practices could bear improvement.
This time, the ASSU Senate exhi
bited irresponsibility and lack of
prudent foresight in not handling
the suggested amendments earlier.
The senate has been working on
senate reform fora year — it should
not have delayed a decision on the
crucial amendment until a week
and a half before the election,
enabling three senators — Dave
Steuer, Geoff Baskir and Erik
Thompson — to block its place
ment on the ballot for the students'
consideration.
We object .strenously to these
senators' actions. We believe they
had no right to prevent the students
from deciding the issue for them
selves.

A share of the blame lies with the
senators who were absent from that
meeting. The structure of the ASSU
constitution, which requires that 14
senators vote in favor of placing the
amendment on the ballot makes it
possible for as few as two of the 15
senators present to stop it. Had
more been there, this anomaly
would not have arisen.
When efforts were made to place
the amendment on the ballot by
petition the ambiguity of the ASSU
Constitution did not help matters,
either. Since the constitution did
not make clear how soon an
amendment placed on the ballot by
petition may be voted on, it opened
the door to conflicting pressures on
the Elections Commission from the
senate and the COP.
Turning to the election itself, we
applaud the new polling places
Election Commissioner Dayna
Goldfine established — they may
have been responsible for the high
turnout. However, there were
problems with the handling of the
election itself.
The master ballots were unclear
— they did not give cogent, impar
tial explanations of the referenda
and amendments, just pro and con
statements submitted to the ASSU
Elections Commission. There were

also too few master ballots at each
polling place; many students did
not vote because they were con
fronted with a 10- to 20-minute wait
for one of the at-most 16 coveted
master ballots at each polling place.
The ballots themselves were
printed in a garbled code making it
impossible to vote without the mas
ter ballot, the key to the cipher.
Lastly, the method used to verify
students' class status for the race
for senior class presidents was also
flawed. Identification was based on
the year the student first enrolled
rather than on the number of units
he or she had accumulated. We
suggest that next time, as was done
yesterday for the senior class presi
dent runoff election, a list of all
bona fide juniors (those who will
have at least 130 units by the follow
ing fall quarter) be obtained from
the registrar and distributed to all
polling places.
The students must help,too —if
they are concerned enough to vote
in the elections, some of them
should be willing to help monitor
the polls and count the votes and
honor their promises to do so.
All problems notwithstanding,
this election was handled better
than many of its predecessors. Let
us hope this trend continues.
