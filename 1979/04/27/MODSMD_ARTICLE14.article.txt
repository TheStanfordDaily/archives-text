## Soviet persecution a form of anti-Semitism 
### 
Marked by distortion of fact and mis
representation of the issue, Yehudi
Busaibis' article (Daily, April 9), "Leave
Soviet ]ews Alone," demonstrates a
frightening disregard for the historical
and contemporary treatment of Russian
Jewry. What's more, it is disquieting to
discover that neither the Daily nor the
University registrar knows anything of a
student by that name.
Busaibis' central thesis is that the
campaign to free dissident Anatoly
Shcharanskv and other Russian lews
who desire to emigrate is but part of an
"international Zionist campaign" to
upgrade the citizenry of Israel.
This argument, which originated with
the Soviet government in the Stalin era,
develops by skewed logic and an ignor
ance of anti-)ewish sentiment in Russia.
Russian anti-Semitism and the con
siquent emigration movement both
historicallv precede the creation of the
state of Israel and the rise of Zionism as
a signilicant political force. Anti-
Semitism and the lack of human rights
are not "all-too-familiar slogans" but
are and have long been all-too-real
conditions in the Soviet Union.
Under such adverse conditions, a

significant emigration movement
began as early as the 1880s, when a
wave of pogroms swept through Ibo
Russian cities and villages. Popular
anti-Semitism, fostered by the czarist
regime, continued to spread through
World War I.
In the late 1930s came the Great
Purges, the systematic liquidation of
most Jewish institutions and organiza
tions among others. During and long
after World War 11, anyone attempting
to emphasize the special suffering of
the Jews under the Nazi occupation was
strongly criticized by official spokes
men.
In the last Cold War years of Stalin's
regime, the government pursued an ac
tiveanti-)ewishpolicy;in 1948and 1949,
Soviet newspapers opened the first un
disguised campaign to exploit popular
anti-Semitism, playing on the ingrained
hatred and suspicion of Jews as the
foreign element once again now seen
as liable to treason.
Under khruschev's "moderate"
anti-Semitism, Jews were systematically
discriminated against in many spheres:
they disappeared from foreign service,
army command posts, government

representation, the party hierarchy,
and the judiciary.
The number of Jews in local, republi
can and Soviet government bodies fell
far below the percentage of lews in
both cities and the entire population.
Young lews met with increasing diffi
culty in getting accepted in higher in
stitutions of learning, particularly in
classified fields.
After the Six-Day-War in 1967, a se
vere campaign was unleashed in the
Soviet press and propaganda, aimed at
condemning Israel and Zionism; its
spirit was markedly anti-Semitic.
This chronology clearly shows the de
generation of the rights of Russian Jews
who have wanted to maintain their
sense of lewish culture. The present
campaigns to free Shcharansky and
other "refuseniks" are aimed at secur
ing the right of the free movement of
peoples and are especially important
now that those discriminated against
have been barred from any means of
rectification: the voice of dissenf could
well be silenced by 'show trials' such as
Shcharansky's.
Such campaigns would do little to
serve the ends of Zionism, for surely

there are better means of aiding the
Israelis than by trying to hold prisoners
of conscience. Vet, despite history,
Busaibis would have us believe that
Soviet anti-Semitism is a Zionist plot to
increase the emigration to Israel of
highly-skilled European Jews.
Furthermore, the "air of suspicion
and hate between Soviet Jews and
non-Jews" has existed for close to 100
years; no rallies here can create or abet
it. Most Russians have no idea that a
Free Shcharansky Movement exists, so
it is doubttul that such a movement
could create suspicion and hate among
them. ,
It is, in fact, precisely this popular
distrust which the Soviet government
has fomented and manipulated in the
past, and according to dissident leader
Andrei Sakharov, is continuing with
trials like those of Shcharansky.
If innocent people like Shcharansky
remain in prison while we sit idly by,
the Soviets will have succeeded. So
long as they want to be free, we cannot
"leave Soviet Jews alone."
