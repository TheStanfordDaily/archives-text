Daily readers may be in
terested in a couple of foot
notes to the April 20 Daily arti
cle reporting on the debate on
nuclear energy held in Kresge
Auditorium on April 18.
After the formal debate,
some members of the audi
ence engaged in informal dis
cussions with the panelists.
During that discussion,
panelist Peter Faulkner stated
that he, and many environ
mentalists, were interested in
energy issues less for their own
sake than for the ulterior pur
pose of using "energy policy"
as a "lever for social change."

Also during the informal dis
cussion, I asked Faulkner if he
disagreed with the statement,
made several times during the
debate by the pro-nuclear
panelists, that the burning of
fossil fuels actually releases as
much or more radioactivity
into the environment than do
nuclear power plants. Neither
Faulkner nor panelist |im Hard
ing addressed this crucial
question during the debate. In
reply, Faulkner conceded that
it might well be the case that
fossil-fuel burning releases
more radioactivity than do nuc
lear plants.
Presumably, there are some
foes of nuclear power whose
opposition is more reasoned

and less disingenuous than is
Faulkner's. It is unfortunate
that they were not represented
in the debate.

I was extremely offended by
the Gil Morales cartoon (Daily,
April 25). The suggestion in this
cartoon that we fraternity men
are clones who think, act, walk
and talk alike is not only de
meaning but also biologically
impossible. This allegation is
especially shocking to me as a
member of a fraternity which
prides itself on the diversity of

interests shared and expressed
by its brothers.
