# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Jay Martel Tuition by the study-hour 
### 
Everyone thinks the University's exorbitant
tuition is unfair, but so far no comprehensive
plans have been offered to combat the ever
growing red-headed monster. Finally, after
many quarters of analysis, there is a single,
comprehensive plan to make tuition, like taxes,
another incredibly fair American enterprise.
The plan, basically, is this: students will be
charged foras much as they learn. After all, isn't
this what we are paying for? The big gripe in the
past has been that some learn more than others
— despite the fact that the nerd in Flo Mo and
the flake in Synergy fork over the same amount.
Under the new system, allowances will be
made for the underachieves who gain nothing
from four years at Stanford but a fraternity pin
and a social disease (alcoholism, for example).
Tirst, all students will be issued time cards.
These will be used to punch in at time clocks
installed at classrooms and libraries. At the end
of the quarter, the time each student has spent
in these locations of learning will be totaled.
The resulting number of hours is multiplied by
$22.36, and a bill for the amount is issued to the
student. What could be simpler?
Of course, not even this plan is perfectly fair.
There are, admittedly, a few bugs to be worked
out. For example, what does one do about the
students who try to screw up the system by
studying in their rooms?
Certainly, this must be considered learning
which, in all fairness, must be paid for. One
proposed solution is to have a special squad of
study police, who would patrol dorms, coffee
houses and other white-light districts (potential
study areas) to make sure no unpaid-forlearning

was occurring. A simple exchange such as the
following would guarantee that no one was rip
ping off the University:
(door knock) Study police! Open up!
(door opens) Oh, hello officer. I was just
smoking some pot and drinking heavily,
(sniffing suspiciously) Are you sure you we
ren't studying?
(visibly anxious) No, I never study here, I
swear it. I was just getting high and thinking of
maybe doing some coke.
(looking around) Smells like an overheated
calculator in here to me.
(sweating profusely) Honest, I haven't
learned anything. In fact, I just forgot a lot of
things. Ask me my name, the alphabet. . . any
thing. Wait! Get away from there! No!
(rising from under bed with book in hand)
Circuit theory, eh? I knew it was here some
where. Book him, Danno.
Another perhaps more practical solution to
the problem is to replace all desks in the hous
ing system with various man-eating animals,
thus assuring the use of libraries for studying.
As in any system, certain individuals will even
tually find ways to exploit this new plan's un
compromising fairness to their own advantage.
It is not unlikely that money-hungry students
will be driven to start learning in unorthodox
places such as house meetings, campus tele
phone booths and bathroom stalls.
In this case, these places will also have to be
equipped with timeclocks, for in a truly fair sys
tem, "learning" and "punching in" are
synonymous.
