## Mature, real men join frats 
### 
Being female and never hav
ing attended a fraternity rush
party I figure I have a pretty
unbiased outlook on the entire
farce known as "rush" — cer
tainly more unbiased than pre
sent fraternity "men" who are
attempting to lure innocent
freshperson rushees into their
dens in iniquity. Having lived
in Branner mv freshman year, I
got a pretty broad perspective
on the aftereffects of rush par
ties — mostly swollen egos and
headaches to match.
Vou freshmen naturally look
up to the fraternity "man" who
has already decided which
majors to eliminate, which
club sport to support (lacrosse
this year?) and who to vote
against in the next election.
You want to participate in the
godlike activities these frat
men have boasted about — to
have your picture taken with a
famous stripper, to steal road
signs and to relieve yourselves
on the Beta House.
You want to be a part of
these manly actions, to be re

spected and admired by your
brothers and most of all to shop
in the meat market next fall.
What you don't realize is that
the meat market is a myth un
less you join Phi Deltas, where
they import them from USC. I

There are several nice fraternity members,
just as there are a few graduate students
who speak English.

can understand how some
guys join a frat when they draw
4999, and I would certainly pre
fer the location ot Sigma Chi
to the trailers but who wants to
eat breakfast every morning
with a short-cropped bunch of
conservatives whose idea of
community service is throwing
rotten tomatoes at Columbae
across the street.
Or be a DU and suffer
humiliation when your
brothers ostracize you for
wearing Keds instead of top
siders. Or how about Delts
where you can't claim your
rightful place in line for dinner
for fear of bodily injury.
Could your stomach survive
Betas where a prime meal con
sists of warmed up bologna in
coagulated cream of mus
hroom soup?
Could you compete with the
Kappa Nerds in reserving a
spot in front of the TV set by 6
p.m. to catch Saturday Night
Live reruns every weekend at
11:30?
Would you really want to live
112 uiltime with the Stanford Band
in "Iheta Xi and rape dead cats
for fun? Could your mind
handle being blown out every
night at the KA's after which
you'd have to take a frog cen

sus for next year's rush book?
Would you admit on a job
resume you spent your under
graduate years as an active
member of Alpha Drugs, or
admit to your girlfriend you ate
dinner with a sexist cartoonist?

I can see rushing SAE's <ot
their jacuzzi, but wouldn't you
get sick of milk and cookies
after a while? Could you really
exist as a Beach Boys throw
back in the Zete house?
Could you retain any self
respect being known as a
Geek? (This term originally re
ferred to circus members who
would bite off the heads of live
chickens and snakes.)
Why not join a sorority if
you're interested in Phi Kappa
Psi? They don't have their own
house either, and they both
congregate at Storey House. As
for the Theta Delts, well, ac
cording to the rush book
they're into a lot of "different
things."
I certainly don't mean to
condemn fraternities. There
are several nice fraternity
members, just as there are a
lew graduate students who
speak English. Some of my best
friends joined fraternities last
year and dropped out this year.
I'd just like to inform you all
that you can establish yourself
as an entity at Stanford without
joining a fraternity — you
could always become a sorority
"little brother."

got a pretty broad perspective
on the aftereffects of rush par
ties — mostly swollen egos and
headaches to match.
Vou freshmen naturally look
up to the fraternity "man" who
has already decided which
majors to eliminate, which
club sport to support (lacrosse
this year?) and who to vote
against in the next election.
You want to participate in the
godlike activities these frat
men have boasted about — to
have your picture taken with a
famous stripper, to steal road
signs and to relieve yourselves
on the Beta House.
You want to be a part of
these manly actions, to be re

spected and admired by your
brothers and most of all to shop
in the meat market next fall.
What you don't realize is that
the meat market is a myth un
less you join Phi Deltas, where
they import them from USC. I

There are several nice fraternity members,
just as there are a few graduate students
who speak English.

can understand how some
guys join a frat when they draw
4999, and I would certainly pre
fer the location ot Sigma Chi
to the trailers but who wants to
eat breakfast every morning
with a short-cropped bunch of
conservatives whose idea of
community service is throwing
rotten tomatoes at Columbae
across the street.
Or be a DU and suffer
humiliation when your
brothers ostracize you for
wearing Keds instead of top
siders. Or how about Delts
where you can't claim your
rightful place in line for dinner
for fear of bodily injury.
Could your stomach survive
Betas where a prime meal con
sists of warmed up bologna in
coagulated cream of mus
hroom soup?
Could you compete with the
Kappa Nerds in reserving a
spot in front of the TV set by 6
p.m. to catch Saturday Night
Live reruns every weekend at
11:30?
Would you really want to live
112 uiltime with the Stanford Band
in "Iheta Xi and rape dead cats
for fun? Could your mind
handle being blown out every
night at the KA's after which
you'd have to take a frog cen

sus for next year's rush book?
Would you admit on a job
resume you spent your under
graduate years as an active
member of Alpha Drugs, or
admit to your girlfriend you ate
dinner with a sexist cartoonist?

I can see rushing SAE's <ot
their jacuzzi, but wouldn't you
get sick of milk and cookies
after a while? Could you really
exist as a Beach Boys throw
back in the Zete house?
Could you retain any self
respect being known as a
Geek? (This term originally re
ferred to circus members who
would bite off the heads of live
chickens and snakes.)
Why not join a sorority if
you're interested in Phi Kappa
Psi? They don't have their own
house either, and they both
congregate at Storey House. As
for the Theta Delts, well, ac
cording to the rush book
they're into a lot of "different
things."
I certainly don't mean to
condemn fraternities. There
are several nice fraternity
members, just as there are a
lew graduate students who
speak English. Some of my best
friends joined fraternities last
year and dropped out this year.
I'd just like to inform you all
that you can establish yourself
as an entity at Stanford without
joining a fraternity — you
could always become a sorority
"little brother."

more majoring in economics.)
