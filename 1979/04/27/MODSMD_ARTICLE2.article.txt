# Whipple resigns senate, protests inaction
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
ASSU Senator Suzanne Whipple,
the lone female member of that
body, resigned at the senate meeting
last night after the senate rejected
her motion, by a 7-6 vote, to hold a
special student election.
Earlier in the meeting, several
senators attempted to remove
George Drysdale as senate chairper
son on the grounds of "unconstitu
tional actions" he committed by plac
ing the senate's election districting
proposal on the Spring Quarter bal
lot as a constitutional amendment.
When informed that the bylaws of
the ASSU Constitution require that
notice be given at a previous meeting

before a member can be expelled,
the senate gave official notice that
Drysdale's removal will be consi
dered at their next meeting on May
10.
Prior to her resignation, Whipple
moved that the senate hold a special
election funded by its discretionary
fund on May 23 and 24 to poll the
student body on mascot options and
other issues to be determined by the
senate.
Whipple prefaced her motion by
calling attention to the language of
senate bill 7911, which the senate
approved when it voted to place the
mascot referendum on the spring
ballot. The bill stated that "a simple
majority is required" for passage of a

mascot referendum.
"If necessary, a run-off election
between the two nominees with the
most votes will be held to coincide
with the second routine election of
Spring Quarter or within two weeks
if no such routine election is held,"
the bill continued.
Election results showed the Grif
fon in possession of 35 percent of the
student vote, narrowly ahead of the
Tree's 34 percent. Therefore, Whip
ple contended, according to the se
nate bill, a run-off between the Grif
fon and the Tree should have been
included on the ballot for the past
two days' Senior Class Presidents'
run-off election.
Sen. Erik Thompson said that he
indicated that requirement in writing
to the Elections Commission Mon
day.
COP member Regina Petty said,
however, that she, Elections Com
missioner Dayna Goldfine and Asst.
Elections Commissioner Chris
Noonan later decided not to place
that issue on the run-off ballot.
Citing a lack of sufficient advertis
ing time and the fact that the elec
tions was basically for juniors, Petty
said, "we decided it was in the best
interest of the student body to place
the issue on the fall ballot for a rep

resentative vote."
Petty added that she was not aware
of the wording of the senate bill at
the time the decision for a fall elec
tion was made. However, Whipple
argued that "Dayna knew it should
be on the ballot."
In an addendum to her motion,
Whipple threatened, "If I don't get
support from the senate on this, I'm
resigning, and I will support a recall
for all those who vote against me."
She based her resignation on senate
failure to uphold its legislation.
After a roll-call vote in which seven
senators defeated her proposal,
Whipple offered her resignation.
Outside of the meeting, she said that
she would "probably rescind my re
call statement" because she had not
anticipated opposition from so many
senators.
The senate unable to certify
the spring election because Goldfine
had not compiled an official report of
the results, Drysdale said. Goldfine
was not available for comment.
Senators also passed a motion to
reaffirm their opposition to the draft
and to violation of the federal Free
dom of Privacy Act, which could be
suspended by the so-called Bennett
Bill, currently before the U.S. House
of Representatives.
