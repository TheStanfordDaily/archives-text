Girlfriends * * *
Saturday, Cubberley
Claudia Weill directed this
movie about a woman who finds
success and love by discovering
that she is the only one who can
make them happen. Girlfriends is
a warm, very good natured
feminist film, full of quiet insights
and what Francois Truffaut would
describe as "privileged mo
ments": episodes which relate
less to the plot than to the mean
ing of the film as a whole. In
terestingly, while the female
characters are unusually well de
veloped, the male characters are
cardboard plot-movers — quite a
twist on the outlook of the ordi
nary film. Melanie Mayron and
Alice Skinner star.
—Jim Mattson
His Girl Friday * ★ ★ #
Friday, Kresge
(1940) Howard Hawks directed
this thoroughly amoral comedy
about two reporters who harbor
an escaped convict in order to
scoop the world with the story.
As you might have guessed, this
is a version of the play The Front
Page, fast talking and cynical as
ever. Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell play the two reporters:
they insult innocent by-standers
when they're not occupied with
putting each other down, justice
and true love, both a little worse
for wear, win out in the end, but
it's a close, hard-fought and ex
tremely funny battle. On a dou
ble bill with My Man Godfrey.
—J.M.
Gimme Shelter * ★ *
Park Theater, Menlo Park
Midnight show Friday and
Saturday night. Depending on
whether or not you like the Rol
ling Stones, you'll either love or
be bored by this concert
documentary film about the
Stones' infamous free concert in
the Altamont Speedway. This is
one of the best concert flicks ever
made (which may not be saying
much, given the average concert
film). Shelter does a good job of
blending a lot of concert footage
with relatively small amounts of
interview footage of the parties
concerned.
—J.M.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.
—Ron Lillejord
Murder by Decree * * *
Biograph, Palo Alto
This time around, Sherlock
Holmes and Dr. Watson are in
carnated in the form of Christ
opher Plummer and lames Ma
son. They're very good — espe
cially Mason — and they have a
chance to show their stuff in an
atmospheric studio recreation of
Victorian London. The plot,
however, isn't that great; this
mystery about Jack the Ripper is a
no more than passable vehicle
for the stars and sets. This is one
of these rare movies that makes
one hunger for a sequel: all the
ingredients are right for making
the definitive Sherlock Holmes
movie, given a slightly better
story.

The Champ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of Jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.
—J.M.

Norma Rae * * * *
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.
Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.
—J.M.
Buck Rogers in the 25th Century
Tl
- Menlo Park
This movie is so bad that it
makes Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians look like Citizen Kane. It
features yecchv acting, wretched
dialogue, putrid sets, and abys
mal double-entendres. Buck Ro
gers was made for TV and then
distributed fortheatrical use after
the producers found out how
much money Battlestar Galactica
was making in its Canadian theat
rical run. This explains the film's
rating: "M" for mindless.
—J.M

Superman * * *
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
The Deer Hunter ★ * ★ Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft. But it's also
among the best war movies ever
made. Very little ot the "tell em I
died for Betty" bullshit that John
Wayne types keep croaking on
the shores of Iwo Jima; the movie
puts you face to face with the
horr- of the thing. Robert De
Nirc is starkly individualistic in
the film's central performance,
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen, but there is a master
piece buried in here somewhere,
and it more than repays an at
tempt at excavation.
—J.N.
Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, Jason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton Ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.
Jan Troell directed: Sven Nykvist
was the cinematographer.
—J.M.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arls, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean- \
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.

Coming Home ★ ★ ★ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers from poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time, lane Fonda and |on
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
)ane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.



The man of steel (left) is enjoying a five-month run at the Park Theater, Menlo Park. Melanie Mayron
(right) plays a struggling photographer in Girlfriends, which plays Saturday in Cubberley Au

His Girl Friday * ★ ★ #
Friday, Kresge
(1940) Howard Hawks directed
this thoroughly amoral comedy
about two reporters who harbor
an escaped convict in order to
scoop the world with the story.
As you might have guessed, this
is a version of the play The Front
Page, fast talking and cynical as
ever. Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell play the two reporters:
they insult innocent by-standers
when they're not occupied with
putting each other down, justice
and true love, both a little worse
for wear, win out in the end, but
it's a close, hard-fought and ex
tremely funny battle. On a dou
ble bill with My Man Godfrey.

Gimme Shelter * ★ *
Park Theater, Menlo Park
Midnight show Friday and
Saturday night. Depending on
whether or not you like the Rol
ling Stones, you'll either love or
be bored by this concert
documentary film about the
Stones' infamous free concert in
the Altamont Speedway. This is
one of the best concert flicks ever
made (which may not be saying
much, given the average concert
film). Shelter does a good job of
blending a lot of concert footage
with relatively small amounts of
interview footage of the parties
concerned.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.
—Ron Lillejord
Murder by Decree * * *
Biograph, Palo Alto
This time around, Sherlock
Holmes and Dr. Watson are in
carnated in the form of Christ
opher Plummer and lames Ma
son. They're very good — espe
cially Mason — and they have a
chance to show their stuff in an
atmospheric studio recreation of
Victorian London. The plot,
however, isn't that great; this
mystery about Jack the Ripper is a
no more than passable vehicle
for the stars and sets. This is one
of these rare movies that makes
one hunger for a sequel: all the
ingredients are right for making
the definitive Sherlock Holmes
movie, given a slightly better
story.

The Champ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of Jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.

Norma Rae * * * *
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.

Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Buck Rogers in the 25th Century
Tl

This movie is so bad that it

gers was made for TV and then

the producers found out how

Superman * * *

A triumph of corporate com

shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

The Deer Hunter ★ * ★ Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft. But it's also
among the best war movies ever
made. Very little ot the "tell em I
died for Betty" bullshit that John
Wayne types keep croaking on
the shores of Iwo Jima; the movie
puts you face to face with the
horr- of the thing. Robert De
Nirc is starkly individualistic in
the film's central performance,
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen, but there is a master
piece buried in here somewhere,
and it more than repays an at
tempt at excavation.

Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, Jason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton Ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.
Jan Troell directed: Sven Nykvist

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arls, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean- \
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.

Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power

the recent events at Three Mile

movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy

excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per

tor, James Bridges, loses his

In the end, an emotionally mov

(1940) Howard Hawks directed
this thoroughly amoral comedy
about two reporters who harbor
an escaped convict in order to
scoop the world with the story.
As you might have guessed, this
is a version of the play The Front
Page, fast talking and cynical as
ever. Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell play the two reporters:
they insult innocent by-standers
when they're not occupied with
putting each other down, justice
and true love, both a little worse
for wear, win out in the end, but
it's a close, hard-fought and ex
tremely funny battle. On a dou
ble bill with My Man Godfrey.

Gimme Shelter * ★ *
Park Theater, Menlo Park
Midnight show Friday and
Saturday night. Depending on
whether or not you like the Rol
ling Stones, you'll either love or
be bored by this concert
documentary film about the
Stones' infamous free concert in
the Altamont Speedway. This is
one of the best concert flicks ever
made (which may not be saying
much, given the average concert
film). Shelter does a good job of
blending a lot of concert footage
with relatively small amounts of
interview footage of the parties
concerned.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.
—Ron Lillejord
Murder by Decree * * *
Biograph, Palo Alto
This time around, Sherlock
Holmes and Dr. Watson are in
carnated in the form of Christ
opher Plummer and lames Ma
son. They're very good — espe
cially Mason — and they have a
chance to show their stuff in an
atmospheric studio recreation of
Victorian London. The plot,
however, isn't that great; this
mystery about Jack the Ripper is a
no more than passable vehicle
for the stars and sets. This is one
of these rare movies that makes
one hunger for a sequel: all the
ingredients are right for making
the definitive Sherlock Holmes
movie, given a slightly better
story.

The Champ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of Jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.

Norma Rae * * * *
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.
Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Buck Rogers in the 25th Century
Tl
- Menlo Park
This movie is so bad that it
makes Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians look like Citizen Kane. It
features yecchv acting, wretched
dialogue, putrid sets, and abys
mal double-entendres. Buck Ro
gers was made for TV and then
distributed fortheatrical use after
the producers found out how
much money Battlestar Galactica
was making in its Canadian theat
rical run. This explains the film's
rating: "M" for mindless.

Superman * * *
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
The Deer Hunter ★ * ★ Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft. But it's also
among the best war movies ever
made. Very little ot the "tell em I
died for Betty" bullshit that John
Wayne types keep croaking on
the shores of Iwo Jima; the movie
puts you face to face with the
horr- of the thing. Robert De
Nirc is starkly individualistic in
the film's central performance,
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen, but there is a master
piece buried in here somewhere,
and it more than repays an at
tempt at excavation.
—J.N.
Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, Jason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton Ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.
Jan Troell directed: Sven Nykvist
was the cinematographer.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arls, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean- \
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.

Coming Home ★ ★ ★ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at

War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers from poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time, lane Fonda and |on
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
)ane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.

Girlfriends * * *
Saturday, Cubberley
Claudia Weill directed this
movie about a woman who finds
success and love by discovering
that she is the only one who can
make them happen. Girlfriends is
a warm, very good natured
feminist film, full of quiet insights
and what Francois Truffaut would
describe as "privileged mo
ments": episodes which relate
less to the plot than to the mean
ing of the film as a whole. In
terestingly, while the female
characters are unusually well de
veloped, the male characters are
cardboard plot-movers — quite a
twist on the outlook of the ordi
nary film. Melanie Mayron and
Alice Skinner star.
