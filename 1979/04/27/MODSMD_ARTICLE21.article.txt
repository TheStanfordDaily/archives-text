## Graham Parker enlists in Costello's 'Armed Forces' 
### 
Squeezing Out Sparks
G-aham Parker
A. ista
Can you picture an entire
sc adron of bespectacled,
pigeon-toed, sneering Elvis
Costello's, sweeping across a
battlefield, cutting down the
enemy left and right? Sounds
far-fetched, but Costello has
his first important recruit.
Graham Parker, with his new
album, Squeezing Out Sparks,
has joined Elvis' "Armed
Forces."
In 1976, Englishman Parker
achieved the unlikely feat of
having fwo of the year's most
critically acclaimed albums:
Howling Wind and Heat Treat
ment. Following that auspici
ous debut, things went sour.
His 1977 Stick to Me was a
muddled, poorly received re

cord. The last year and a half
have passed without a new
studio album, Parker being
preoccupied with a messy di
vorce from Mercury Records.
Recently, with the litigation fi
nally over, he released a bitter
single entitled "Mercury
Poisoning" — and Graham
wasn't talking about tuna-fish.
Now, with a new record
company (Arista) and a new
image ("The decade finally
toughens up," blares a full
page ad in the current Rolling
Sfone), comes Parker's excit
ing new album.
New Wave approach
Parker has dropped his en
tire brass section for Sparks
and eliminated the '60s R&B
feel which he shared with
American artists like Southside
johnny and Bob Seger. In its

place is a thoroughly new wave
approach, unmistakeable pat
terned after the enigmatic Cos
tello.
"I'm aware of exactly what
I'm doing: making everything a
mystery," sings Parker on
"Local Girls." In this world, no
thing is quite what it seems. His
lyrics, like Costello's, are full of
word play and double mean
ing, swirling about in a dense
vortex of repetition, rhyming
and alliteration.
Parker's new songs tackle
nothing less than the nature of
social relations. In a society
becoming ever more
rationalized, emotions grow
more volatile and desires more
urgent. Parker shares Costel
lo's vision of a war-torn social
world of fear, anger and frust
ration. Love is reduced to a
military maneuver, a chemical
reaction, or, as in "You Can't
Be Too Strong," a medical op
eration:
The doctor gets nervous com
pleting the service
He's all rubber gloves and no
head;
He fumbles the light switch

It's just another minor hitch-
Wishes to God he was dead.
Tight unit
Parker's backing band, the
Rumour, remains one of rock's
best and tightest units. They're
better than ever with the addi
tion of producer jack
Nietzsche (known especially
for his work with Neil Young),
who plays an integral role in
crafting Parker's new sound.
But it's Graham's vocals which
are the heart of Sparks. With
enormous vocal control, he
lashes out cruelly in one breath
and then soothes the victim
(often Parker himself) in the
next.
The album's best cuts,
"Don't Get Excited" and "Pro
tection," are masterpieces of
new wave ambivalence. Musi
cally, the band swells with ten
sion — racing its engine, grind
ing its gears, lurching forward
and back in furious motion.
Lyrically, Parker again echoes
Costello. In "Protection" he
sees himself — amidst a vio
lently competitive world — as
pacifist-at-heart but gun-in
hand:

Every bomb is detonated; every
switch is thrown
Everybody tells me, "Don't be
scared -
Act as if you never cared."
So I wear a blank expression
To conceal my real impression
I must get out at any price
Before the feeling gets too
nice.
Lapses
There are occasional lapses
in the intensity of Parker's new
effort. "Saturday Night is
Dead" (Parker's prognosis for
"Saturday Night Fever") is dull,
heavy-handed rock and roll.
"Waiting for the UFO's" is a
cute but hopelessly dumb song
about the coming of aliens.
In general, though, Squeez
ing Out Sparks is an important
and successful album. If Parker
lacks Costello's ferocious,
complex intellect, he largely
makes up for it with his emo
tional energy. And as Elvis'
music becomes increasingly
brittle and self-indulgent,
Graham Parker may well be the
voice to listen to.
