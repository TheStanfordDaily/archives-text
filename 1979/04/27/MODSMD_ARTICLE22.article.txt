## Kiss Me Kate hits highs, lows 
### 
If the good, solid entertainment of well-done musical
theater is what you're interested in, then Ram's Head's
production of Kiss Me Kate is where to find it. Its high
points, when they hit, are excellent, and while it does suffer
dead spots that detract from the pacing and enjoyment of
the show unnecessarily, overall, Kiss Me Kate is a show
Ram's Head can be proud of.
The direction of the show, under Kevin Cavanaugh and
Jeannie Barker, has a quick, even pace throughout. Many
times the sheer creativity and freshness of their style simply
shone, mainly through their treatment of scenes and the
use of their actors. From the same hands, however, came
flat spots in the action due to stiff blocking or unfocused
direction. Several scenes fall flat or lose their meaning and
charm because of this. The overall balance, however, is
light and interesting direction that holds the audience by its
own power.
The acting parallels the directing of the show closely.
Nelson Burton, who plays Fred Graham and Emmie
Stenstedt, who plays his wife Lillie, work well together
throughout, both of them adding delightful touches to
their characters. Nelson, however, only makes it 90 percent
of the way — at key points in the show, as when his wife
leaves him, he reads his lines straight from the script. His
performance-, at times, is too even, too controlled and he
doesn't allow himself to become completely emotionally
involved. ,
The two gangsters of the show, always lovable characters
in Kiss Me Kate, are once again audience favorites, mainly
due to the comic ability of Kevin Reidy, who gives an excel
lent performance. Michelle Collopy and Paul King (Lois
Lane and Bill Calhoon in the show) also give solid perfor
mances worth noting, as second leads.
What especially deserves mention in the cast is the
chorus and supporting cast members. During the entire
show, they constantly back up the leads, all of them having
a character and period air about them which give a fantastic
backdrop for the leads to work in front of. They add to the
show immeasurably.
The show is beautifully choreographed from start to
finish. Dances are intricate, yet straight-forward; they
achieve a 1940s period effect easily and naturally, never
once falling back on the dance cliches of that era. The
choreography also blends well with the quality of the
show's dancers; together they make the stage come alive
with every type of dance there is — tap and ballet through
'40s jazz to gymnastics.
The dancing also works well with the design of the show,
which is done primarily using one major set piece and
fly-ins. The piece, a combination stairs and balcony, is used
in every angle and position possible, keeping the show
physically simple, yet visually diverse and complex. It
works very well.
Overall, Kiss Me Kate has a lot to offer, and is definitely
fine entertainment in the classic American musical comedy
style.
