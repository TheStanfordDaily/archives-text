# Top moundsman Fiala gives Cards consistency
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
He calls himself part of a
package deal that the Univer
sity acquired four years ago
from Notre Dame High School
in Van Nuys, Ca.
He and all-star linebacker
Cordy Ceresino — high school
pitcher-catcher combo, best
friends and roommates for
three yqars now — both signed
letters of intent to attend Stan
ford in 1975. During the past
four years, each has contri
buted greatly to Stanford athle
tics.
Bruce Fiala is a hard
throwing right-hander on the
Cardinal pitching staff, now
known for more than just a
good breaking ball. He re
cently became the winningest
pitcher in Stanford baseball
history when he earned his
25th career win last Saturday, a
13-4 triumph over Arizona.
"I think it's great," Fiala en
thused. "Gordy's got the all
time tackling record; I've got
the all-time wins.
"I didn't really think about it
at the beginning of the year,"
Fiala said about setting the re
cord. "But after I got my third
or fourth win with three
fourths of the season remain
ing, I told myself, 'I'm going to
break this record; I'm going to
get in (the record books).' "
Consistency
As Fiala sees it, a pitcher has
to be consistent to break a re
cord like this. And even with a
few ups and downs, he has
been a consistent performer
for four years.
Making the varsity squad as a
freshman, Fiala enjoyed six
starts and made appearances in
11 other games, finishing the
season with a 5-2 record.
For the next two years he
posted six wins a season,
against two losses in his
sophomore year and four los-

ses his junior year. Currently,
he leads the staff with an 8-3
mark.
"In my freshman year, fall
ball was the biggest thing for
me," Fiala said. "Stanford re
cruited 13 pitchers that year
. . . when the regular season
came around, I was just happy
to be on the varsity."
According to Ceresino, the
most important thing Fiala had

to do that year was "adapt" to
college baseball. "He was the
ace in high school," Ceresino
explained. "He won every
game out."
Tough competition
Winning every game played
is nothing short of impossible
in the league in which Stanford
competes. Fiala, along with
almost everyone involved in
college baseball, considers the

Pacific-10 Conference the best
league in the nation. In fact,
Fiala chose to attend Stanford
partly because it was a Pac-10
(at that time, Pac-8) school.
"I wanted to play in the Pac
-8," Fiala said. "And in terms of
the total program (academics
and athletics), I think the best
decision I've ever made was to
come here. I've now seen all
the other schools' prog

rams. ... I don't regret com
ing here."
Playing against teams like
USC, UCLA, California and
now the two Arizona schools
has meant a lot of frustration
for Card pitchers. A Stanford
team has not once made it to
the playoffs, much less an
NCAA championship, in the
years Fiala and his senior
teammates have been here.
Pro aspirations
According to Fiala, getting
into the playoffs is something
every player wants to do. But
the personal benefits of facing
the toughest competition in
college baseball is more impor
tant to Fiala as a pitcher, be
cause playing professionally is
and always has been his goal.
"My underlying motivation
has always been to get myself
drafted," Fiala admitted. "I'm
just hoping to hell that some
body's interested in me at the
end of the year."
Fiala realizes that it can be a
long, hard road up through the
minor leagues and into the
bigs, but he says he visualizes
himself in that situation a lot
easier than in a nine-to-five
job.
"I don't plan on stopping
(playing baseball) until some
body tells me that I just don't
have it," Fiala said.
No summer ball
1 For a pitcher bound for the
pros, Fiala has been somewhat
of a nonconformist. Instead of
playing summer baseball, Fiala
works part time and spends the
other halves of his days doing
his own program of lifting
weights and running.
Last summer he had an offer
to play ball with the semi-pro
team in Anchorage, Alaska, a
team that wins or comes close
to winning the national semi
pro tournament in Wichita,
Kansas each summer. The year

before that, he was asked to
play on the Colorado semi-pro
team for the summer.
"I just figured it would be
best if I didn't play," Fiala said.
"Summer ball is more of a time
for position players. Lifting
weights and running has really
helped in picking up speed on
my fastball."
Guts and brains
According to Card catcher
Bruce Walters, Fiala works well
on his own, and by working on
his own he has become a
"smarter" pitcher.
"He doesn't overpower
people," Walters explained.
"He likes to out-think the hit
ters. But he's a real gutsy guy."
Walters recalled a game ear
lier this year when Fiala had to
face ex-high school teammate
Jim Auten — a power hitter for
the UCLA Bruins. Stanford was
leading UCLA 9-4. There were
two outs and two runners on
base when Auten came to bat.
"Auten hit a home run,"
Walters said. "But Bruce just
shrugged it off by saying 'I
wanted to pitch to him.' " Fiala
went on to win 9-7.
Bullpen helped
Along with the improved

fastball and a greater confi
dence in himself, Fiala attri
butes this year's success to a
junior year largely spent in the
bullpen as a relief pitcher.
"Last year really helped my
attitude," Fiala said. "It made
me hungry to get out and pitch.
When you go down in the pen,
you'll do almost anything to get
out."
So Fiala decided that every
time he pitched he'd do the
best job possible so that he
could get out again. Now he's
back in the starting rotation,
and enjoying the extra free
dom that comes with being a
starter.
The most immediate con
cern Fiala has right now is help
ing Stanford attain a second
place finish in the Pac-10
Southern Division. That would
give him and his senior team
mates their first shot at the
NCAA playoffs. Then he'll start
thinking about the pros.
"I'd love to go back to
Southern California eventu
ally/' Fiala said. "But I'd accept
never going back there if I were
playing somewhere . . . even
on some east or midwest farm
team."

get in (the record books).' "
Consistency
As Fiala sees it, a pitcher has
to be consistent to break a re
cord like this. And even with a
few ups and downs, he has
been a consistent performer
for four years.
Making the varsity squad as a
freshman, Fiala enjoyed six
starts and made appearances in
11 other games, finishing the
season with a 5-2 record.
For the next two years he
posted six wins a season,
against two losses in his
sophomore year and four los-

ses his junior year. Currently,
he leads the staff with an 8-3
mark.
"In my freshman year, fall
ball was the biggest thing for
me," Fiala said. "Stanford re
cruited 13 pitchers that year
. . . when the regular season
came around, I was just happy
to be on the varsity."
According to Ceresino, the
most important thing Fiala had

to do that year was "adapt" to
college baseball. "He was the
ace in high school," Ceresino
explained. "He won every
game out."
Tough competition
Winning every game played
is nothing short of impossible
in the league in which Stanford
competes. Fiala, along with
almost everyone involved in
college baseball, considers the

Pacific-10 Conference the best
league in the nation. In fact,
Fiala chose to attend Stanford
partly because it was a Pac-10
(at that time, Pac-8) school.
"I wanted to play in the Pac
-8," Fiala said. "And in terms of
the total program (academics
and athletics), I think the best
decision I've ever made was to
come here. I've now seen all
the other schools' prog

rams. ... I don't regret com
ing here."
Playing against teams like
USC, UCLA, California and
now the two Arizona schools
has meant a lot of frustration
for Card pitchers. A Stanford
team has not once made it to
the playoffs, much less an
NCAA championship, in the
years Fiala and his senior
teammates have been here.
Pro aspirations
According to Fiala, getting
into the playoffs is something
every player wants to do. But
the personal benefits of facing
the toughest competition in
college baseball is more impor
tant to Fiala as a pitcher, be
cause playing professionally is
and always has been his goal.
"My underlying motivation
has always been to get myself
drafted," Fiala admitted. "I'm
just hoping to hell that some
body's interested in me at the
end of the year."
Fiala realizes that it can be a
long, hard road up through the
minor leagues and into the
bigs, but he says he visualizes
himself in that situation a lot
easier than in a nine-to-five
job.
"I don't plan on stopping
(playing baseball) until some
body tells me that I just don't
have it," Fiala said.
No summer ball
1 For a pitcher bound for the
pros, Fiala has been somewhat
of a nonconformist. Instead of
playing summer baseball, Fiala
works part time and spends the
other halves of his days doing
his own program of lifting
weights and running.
Last summer he had an offer
to play ball with the semi-pro
team in Anchorage, Alaska, a
team that wins or comes close
to winning the national semi
pro tournament in Wichita,
Kansas each summer. The year

before that, he was asked to
play on the Colorado semi-pro
team for the summer.
"I just figured it would be
best if I didn't play," Fiala said.
"Summer ball is more of a time
for position players. Lifting
weights and running has really
helped in picking up speed on
my fastball."
Guts and brains
According to Card catcher
Bruce Walters, Fiala works well
on his own, and by working on
his own he has become a
"smarter" pitcher.
"He doesn't overpower
people," Walters explained.
"He likes to out-think the hit
ters. But he's a real gutsy guy."
Walters recalled a game ear
lier this year when Fiala had to
face ex-high school teammate
Jim Auten — a power hitter for
the UCLA Bruins. Stanford was
leading UCLA 9-4. There were
two outs and two runners on
base when Auten came to bat.
"Auten hit a home run,"
Walters said. "But Bruce just
shrugged it off by saying 'I
wanted to pitch to him.' " Fiala
went on to win 9-7.
Bullpen helped
Along with the improved

fastball and a greater confi
dence in himself, Fiala attri
butes this year's success to a
junior year largely spent in the
bullpen as a relief pitcher.
"Last year really helped my
attitude," Fiala said. "It made
me hungry to get out and pitch.
When you go down in the pen,
you'll do almost anything to get
out."
So Fiala decided that every
time he pitched he'd do the
best job possible so that he
could get out again. Now he's
back in the starting rotation,
and enjoying the extra free
dom that comes with being a
starter.
The most immediate con
cern Fiala has right now is help
ing Stanford attain a second
place finish in the Pac-10
Southern Division. That would
give him and his senior team
mates their first shot at the
NCAA playoffs. Then he'll start
thinking about the pros.
"I'd love to go back to
Southern California eventu
ally/' Fiala said. "But I'd accept
never going back there if I were
playing somewhere . . . even
on some east or midwest farm
team."

Pacific-10 Conference the best
league in the nation. In fact,
Fiala chose to attend Stanford
partly because it was a Pac-10
(at that time, Pac-8) school.
"I wanted to play in the Pac
-8," Fiala said. "And in terms of
the total program (academics
and athletics), I think the best
decision I've ever made was to
come here. I've now seen all
the other schools' prog

rams. ... I don't regret com
ing here."
Playing against teams like
USC, UCLA, California and
now the two Arizona schools
has meant a lot of frustration
for Card pitchers. A Stanford
team has not once made it to
the playoffs, much less an
NCAA championship, in the
years Fiala and his senior
teammates have been here.
Pro aspirations
According to Fiala, getting
into the playoffs is something
every player wants to do. But
the personal benefits of facing
the toughest competition in
college baseball is more impor
tant to Fiala as a pitcher, be
cause playing professionally is
and always has been his goal.
"My underlying motivation
has always been to get myself
drafted," Fiala admitted. "I'm
just hoping to hell that some
body's interested in me at the
end of the year."
Fiala realizes that it can be a
long, hard road up through the
minor leagues and into the
bigs, but he says he visualizes
himself in that situation a lot
easier than in a nine-to-five
job.
"I don't plan on stopping
(playing baseball) until some
body tells me that I just don't
have it," Fiala said.
No summer ball
1 For a pitcher bound for the
pros, Fiala has been somewhat
of a nonconformist. Instead of
playing summer baseball, Fiala
works part time and spends the
other halves of his days doing
his own program of lifting
weights and running.
Last summer he had an offer
to play ball with the semi-pro
team in Anchorage, Alaska, a
team that wins or comes close
to winning the national semi
pro tournament in Wichita,
Kansas each summer. The year

before that, he was asked to
play on the Colorado semi-pro
team for the summer.
"I just figured it would be
best if I didn't play," Fiala said.
"Summer ball is more of a time
for position players. Lifting
weights and running has really
helped in picking up speed on
my fastball."
Guts and brains
According to Card catcher
Bruce Walters, Fiala works well
on his own, and by working on
his own he has become a
"smarter" pitcher.
"He doesn't overpower
people," Walters explained.
"He likes to out-think the hit
ters. But he's a real gutsy guy."
Walters recalled a game ear
lier this year when Fiala had to
face ex-high school teammate
Jim Auten — a power hitter for
the UCLA Bruins. Stanford was
leading UCLA 9-4. There were
two outs and two runners on
base when Auten came to bat.
"Auten hit a home run,"
Walters said. "But Bruce just
shrugged it off by saying 'I
wanted to pitch to him.' " Fiala
went on to win 9-7.
Bullpen helped
Along with the improved

fastball and a greater confi
dence in himself, Fiala attri
butes this year's success to a
junior year largely spent in the
bullpen as a relief pitcher.
"Last year really helped my
attitude," Fiala said. "It made
me hungry to get out and pitch.
When you go down in the pen,
you'll do almost anything to get
out."
So Fiala decided that every
time he pitched he'd do the
best job possible so that he
could get out again. Now he's
back in the starting rotation,
and enjoying the extra free
dom that comes with being a
starter.
The most immediate con
cern Fiala has right now is help
ing Stanford attain a second
place finish in the Pac-10
Southern Division. That would
give him and his senior team
mates their first shot at the
NCAA playoffs. Then he'll start
thinking about the pros.
"I'd love to go back to
Southern California eventu
ally/' Fiala said. "But I'd accept
never going back there if I were
playing somewhere . . . even
on some east or midwest farm
team."

FIALA'S FOOTBALL counterpart, also a product of Notre Dame High
School in Van Vuys, Gordy Ceresino switched sports from catching
baseballs to catching ball carriers, establishing the school all-time
tackling record in the process.
