### Cathy Dickerson

suffered a serious setback in
Los Angeles last night as the
University of Southern
California handed its visitors a
12-tt defeat under the lights at
Dedeaux Field.
Losing the first game of the
three-game league series puts
the pressure on the Cardinals,
who headed south in hopes of
taking two out of the three
games against their rivals.
In order to keep alive hopes
of a second-place finish in the
Pacific-10 Conference South
ern Division, two victories this
weekend are a must for the
Cards.
The second place finisher in

the Southern Division will
enter a play-off with the North
ern Division winner to deter
mine the-second Pac-lOteam in
this year's NCAA champion
ship. UCLA has all but sewn up
the number one spot.
Centerfielder Bob Skube
and first baseman Dave Smith
led the 13-hit attack launched
by USC. The two Trojan pow
erhouses had three hits, three
RBI and one home run apiece.
Paul /uvella highlighted
Stanford's 13-hit counterattack
that fell short of producing
enough runs to top the Tro
jans. The Stanford second
baseman went three-for-four
at the plate and stole two
bases.

Southpaw )oe LoPresti ab
sorbed the loss lor the Cards,
his fifth against seven wins this
year. LoPresti was shelled in
the first three innings of the

nine innings for the Trojans
and recorded his sixth victory
