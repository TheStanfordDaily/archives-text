# Cricketeers play at Maloney Field
## 
### Karl Hagen 
The undefeated Stanford
Cricket Club will host the Del
Monte Cricket Club at 12:30
this Sunday on the IM fields
next to Maloney Field. The
Club played the first of its 16
league matches three weeks
ago and will be playing for its
fourth straight win.
As one of nine teams in the
Northern California Cricket
Association, the club plays
each of the other teams twice
throughout the Spring and
Summer quarters.
At the end of the season
there is a single elimination
tournament and during the
season the NCCA hosts several
touring teams such as Auck
land University, the MCC
Young Professionals and the
national team of Fiji. There is
also the annual match versus
the Southern California Cric
ket Association.
Club members come from
cricket-playing countries such
as England, India, Pakistan,
Canada and the West Indies.

The coach, Urmi Modi, has
played first-class cricket in
Bombay, India, for seven
years. He captains the side and
anchors the bowling attack. In
the two matches he has been
responsible for 15 of the 20
batsmen put out, including
four outs on four consecutive
balls.
The batting side has been
dominated by Basil Burke, who
is here fora year from Jamaica.
In last week's match versus
Fresno State, he scored 102 of
214 runs. )im Taylor, a
freshman from Canada, scored
67 runs in that match.
The matches played in this
league are limited to 40 six-ball
overs (240 deliveries by the
bowlers), and typical batting
scores range from the twenties
to occasionally over two
hundred.
For those who haven't seen a
match for some time and any
one interested in learning
about this interesting and very
popular sport (in much of the
rest of the world at least) here's
your chance.
