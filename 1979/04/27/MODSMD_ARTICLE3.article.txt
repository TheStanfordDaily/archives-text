# Student openings available on University committees
## 
### 
Today is the last day to submit an
application for one of the more than
% openings forstudents who wish to
serve on University, trustee and
ASSU committees next year, accord
ing to Henry Garcia, ASSU commit
tee staff assistant.
Each committee has responsibility
for dealing with some aspect of cam
pus life. While some committees
monitor student complaints and
suggestions, others, such as the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR) and the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US) serve
as task forces and advisory boards to
the president and the Board of Trus
tees.
Most students are unaware that
the committees exist, Garcia said.
"But they should be; these commit
tees can have a lot to say on many
issues affecting students here."
Garcia said that students may gain
many benefits from serving on the
committees. "If nothing else, they
get something good to put on a law
school application; they get the
chance to meet top administrators
and to talk openly about their own
concerns," he said.
In orde.r to be considered for a pos
ition on any of the committees, a
student must fill out the appropriate
application materials, which can be
obtained at the ASSU office. Stu
dents can review descriptive mate

rials on each of the committees be
fore submitting a formal application.
"Looking at what the committee
has done can be valuable to students
interested in applying," Garcia said.
"It tells students the kinds of prob
lems each committee has and it may
suggest possible solutions which
each student can propose in his ap
plication."
After the applications have been
reviewed by the ASSU Nominations
Committee (Nom Com), a "finalists"
list is compiled. Each applicant who
is successful in the first round re
turns for an interview with several
members of the Nom Com, who
make the final selections. The re
commendations of Nom Com are
then reviewed by the ASSU Senate
and President Richard Lyman.
"This last step is generally a rubber
stamp on the Nom Corn's recom
mendations," Garcia said.
Occasionally, students put in ap
plications to serve on one committee
and are then informed that they
might prefer to work on another
committee, Garcia said. "We try to
put together the interests and past
experiences of each of the applicants
with the needs of the committees,"
Garcia said.
There are no special qualifications
necessary to serve on a committee,
except that an applicant be enrolled
