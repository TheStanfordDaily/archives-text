# 85th dual favors Cal
## Cards host Big Meet 
### Chris Haft 
Though its chances tor vic
tory are reduced by injuries
and a resulting lack of depth,
the Stanford men's track team
will not spare any effort in to
morrow's "Big Meet" against
California at Stanford Stadium.
As most everyone on cam
pus knows by now, sprinter
long jumper Damn Nelson was
lost to a hamstring tendon in
jury on March 41 in a meet
against UCLA. Larry Harris,
another valuable sprinter, has
been bothered all season by a
pulled stomach muscle and
will miss tomorrow's events.
Yet ever-optimistic Stanford
coach Payton Jordan foresees a
spirited tussle between the
traditional rivals.
"Point-wise, this might be
regarded as a lopsided meet (in
Cal's favor)," Jordan said.
"Competitive-wise, it won't be
lopsided at all. It's always a
good meet — a lot of emotion
and super efforts always come
out of it."
In fact, some of Cal's top
athletes might still be bothered
by aches and pains, as dash
men Eugene Rachal (pulled
hamstring) and Mike Farmer
(pulled calf muscle) and
middle-distance man Andy
Clifford (sore achilles tendon)
have all had to either miss
meets or perform at sub-par

levels in 1979.
Students will be admitted to
the meet tor $2. Field events
begin at 1:15 p.m. and running
competition starts at 1:45.
It is recommended to arrive
on time, tor the early races
promise to be closely con
tested.
One such battle is the
1500-meter run, where Stan
ford's Tom Lobsinger, whose
season s best is .1:47.8, faces
Clifford (3:50J).
The various obstacles in the
5000-meter steeplechase
shouldn't considerably sepa
rate the runners involved, par
ticularly Stanford's Bill Gail
(8:53.6) and Bill Haldeman
(B:59.0) and Cal's Gary Blume
(8:56.7).
Card Gordon Banks will find
himself pushed to the limit in
the 200-meter dash against
Farmer and Ra< hal and in the
400 against Rachal and Mike
White.
White will also challenge
impressive Card freshman
John Schaer in the 800. Schaer
has a 1979 best of 1:49.8 in that
event, while White owns- a
1:49.0.
In the 5000 meters, Card
All-America Roy kissin matches
up against Blume, who re
cently told the San Francisco
Exarumer that his favorite

night-before-the-race meal is
pizza and beer.
Indeed, the Kissin-Blume
matchup should be a real least
for track tans—Jordan calls it
"the biggest battle of the
meet"—as the pair's season
bests differ by just one second
(kissin 14:12.6, Blume 14: I }.b).
The 110-meter high hurdles,
Jordan believes, will be a "nip
and-and-tuck" contest bet
ween Stanford's ken
Margerum, whose lifetime
best is 14.3, and the Bears'
Larry Cowling and Ray Smith,
both of whom hold bests of
14.29.
Card freshman Gary Bruner,
who has thrown the javelin
235-feet-3, has the edge in that
event. The Bears' David Porath
will probably top the shot put
and discus competition,
though he should be pushed
by Stanford's Kick Buss and
Dave Thomson.
But Cal's decided advantage
in seven events —the 400 in
termediate hurdles, the 4UO
and mile relays, the pole vault
and the high, long and triple
jumps—bodes ill fortune for
Stanford.
"We feel that Cal has to be a
big favorite," Jordan admitted,
"Although that doesn't take
away the possibility ot our hav
ing a good personal meet."
