Violence continues despite truce
Syrian and Israeli fighter jets streaked ominously over
Beirut yesterday and Christian militiamen lobbed mor
tars into two southern Lebanese villages after an Israeli
bombardment of Palestinian camps in Sidon.
Despite the action, a spokesman for the Palestine Lib
eration Organization said there had been no "signific
ant" violations of an early morning U.N. truce that
ended four days of fighting between Israeli and Palesti
nian guerrillas.
A U.N. spokesman in Jerusalem also said the truce,
arranged by U.N. liaison in Israel and Lebanon, was
holding.
The truce was called after four days of cross-border
shooting that erupted when four Palestinian raiders at
tacked the coastal Israeli town of Nahariya early Sunday.
Four Israelis and two of the raiders were killed.
Israeli military authorities, meanwhile, confirmed re
ports that they suspect French Capt. Oliver Fabre, who
served with U.N. forces in southern Lebanon, of provid
ing the PLO with pictures of Israel military installations.
A Israeli military spokesman, who asked not to be
named, said the photographs may have aided the PLO
attack on Nahariya.
Committee OKs Carter's gas plan
Washington — The Senate Energy Committee
breathed new life into President Jimmy Carter's standby
gasoline plan yesterday, but only after the administra
tion promised to alleviate potential gasoline shortages in
states where people do the most driving.
Under the revised Carter rationing plan — to be in
voked only in the event of a national energy emergency
— gasoline coupons would be disbursed on the basis of
how many cars each person owns.
The committee voted 9-8 to recommend approval of
the plan to the full Senate.
As late as Wednesday night, key members of the panel
had predicted the rationing scheme would be rejected.
But late Wednesday night, White House aides agreed
that 10 percent of the nation's gasoline reserves would
be allocated to states where motorists drive further to
reach their jobs, mainly in the West.
"That tipped the balance," said Sen. Bennett Johnston
(D-La.), chairman of a Senate energy conservation sub
committee.
In addition, Johnston said, members of the House and
Senate have begun to realize there will be serious shor

tages of gasoline this summer, and potentially serious
shortages of heating oil next fall and winter.
"We need a standby rationing plan," said Sen. Henry
Jackson (D-Wash.), chairman of the energy panel. On
Wednesday, Jackson had said the president's proposal
was cumbersome and unworkable.
Consumer prices rise 1 percent
Washington — Consumer prices soared another 1 per
» cent in March, the government said yesterday, adding to
concern that inflation in the economy is out of control.
The annual rate of price increases during the first
three months of the year was 13 percent, the worst
quarterly burst in inflation in4V2 years. Consumer prices
increased 1.2 percent in February.
Prices increased sharply in March in all sectors of the
economy. Food and housing prices were up 1 percent;
clothing prices were up 1.5 percent, and transportation
costs rose 1.2 percent.
The price of regular gasoline rose 3.8 percent to a
record 70.6 cents a gallon inMarch, upfrom6B.l centsin
February and the largest monthly percentage increase
since July of 1975.
Alfred Kahn, President Jimmy Carter's anti-inflation
chief, told the congressional Joint Economic Committee
the March price report was bad and said, "we still have
some bad months ahead." He said it was "highly un
likely" the administration could meet its 7.4 percent
inflation target for the year.
The increase in prices for the 12-month period ending
in March was 10.2 percent.
Dow Jones drops 6.49

power pushed utility stocks lower yesterday as the stock

vanced in each of the past four sessions, dropped 6.49 to
860.97. Declines led advances among New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues by nearly 2-1, and Big Board vol
ume rose to 32.40 million shares from 31.75 million
