# Drysdale discusses issues facing senate after election
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
ASSU Senate chairperson George
Drysdale highlighted the major di
lemmas facing the senate before and
after last week's election on KZSU's
Campus Conference, aired before
last night's senate meeting.
Drysdale confirmed that the elec
tion results for constitutional
amendments and referenda were
"ambiguous at best" and pose a dif
ficult task for the senate in interpret
ing the mandate of the electorate.
From the confusing and even, in
some cases, contradictory vote tal
lies, he concluded that "it seems that
the students want some type of dis
tricting. The crucial question for the
senate to determine is exactly what
type of districting is desired."
Drysdale noted that the indeci

siveness displayed by senate mem
bers at their April 10 meeting almost
invalidated over a year of work on
election reform. Rather than having
"all our work go for naught," the se
nate used a "shut-gun approach to
throw out a plethora of issues" to the
student body and, thus, create the
longest and most complex ballot in
recent history.
"Maybe to reduce the intolerance
for fighting through a long ballot, we
should place referenda and amend
ments at the top of the ballot like the
Council of Presidents' (COP) race,"
he said.
Drysdale explained his role in plac
ing the senate districting proposal on
the ballot as a constitutional
amendment instead of a referendum
issue as one in search of constitu-
tional consistency.
"If amendments approved by the
senate after winter quarter were on
the ballot, I thought that the
petitioned amendment should be
also," he said. "It was all or nothing,
and for reasons of practicality, we
obviously wanted something on the
ballot."
Drysdale revealed that he had re
ceived senate approval of his in
terpretation on the night that he
made his decision to place the
amendment on the ballot. "I con
ducted a phone poll of the senate to
insure their consistency with my in
terpretation," he said. Of 12 mem
bers he contacted, 11 agreed with his
decision, he said.

As a graduate student, Drysdale
was questioned about the apparent
lack of graduate student interest in
senate affairs. Admitting that, "I'm
getting some flak myself over at the
law school" because of his involve
ment in senate activities, he said that
many graduates view the senate as a
"playing in a sandbox phenomena."
According to Drysdale, some
graduates feel that undergraduates
should be running the campus. He
pointed out that graduate study in
volves a large time commitment in
itself.
Drysdale said that he thinks there
is "a lot of room for graduate con
tribution" in student government,
particularly on trustee and University
committees, "where many important
decisions on the campus are made."
