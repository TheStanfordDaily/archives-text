# Trustees back non-expansion resolutions on South Africa
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
The Board of Trustees Select
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility (SCIR) voted yesterday to
support a stockholder resolution cal
ling on Mobil Oil Co. to inform black
workers in South Africa that they are
free to form or join labor unions.
During a nationwide conference
telephone call, the SCIR also voted
unanimously to back another
shareholder proposal which would
prohibit U.S. Steel Corp. from ex
panding its operations in South Af
rica.
Both SCIR votes concurred with
recommendations made by the Uni
versity Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR). CIR members
voted unanimously to recommend
University support of the Mobil Oil
Co. shareholder proposal at their
April 18 meeting. They also recom
mended Wednesday that the SCIR
back the stockholder resolution

prohibiting U.S. Steel Corp. expan
sion in South Africa.
According to a CIR report, the Uni
versity owns 1400 shares of Mobil Oil
Co. stock and 119,700 shares of stock
in U.S. Steel.
Frederick Hillier, chairman of the
CIR and a professor of operations re
search, applauded the SCIR's deci
sion to support the Mobil and U.S.
Steel stockholder resolutions, say
ing, "I'm very pleased by both ac
tions. It seems to me that the trustees
and CIR are more in accord this year
than last."
According to the Investor Respon
sibility Research Center (IRRC), a
Washington-based organization es
tablished by the University and other
institutions in 1970, Mobil Oil Co.
has argued "regularly and un
equivocally" against informing their
workers of their rights to join a un
ion. In South Africa, however,
"without company goodwill, it is un
likely workers will feel able to join
unions or that unions can be effec
tive once they are formed," accord
ing to the IRRC.
The IRRC analysis of this stockhol
der resolution adds, "At present,
there is no equality of opportunity to
(sic) representation for white and
black workers: African unions lack
legal recognition and unless com
panies take compensating steps —
such as repeatedly assuring their
workers of their rights — equal rep
resentation will not be possible."
Rodney Adams, director of finance
and ex-officio member of the CIR,
said yesterday's SCIR debate on the
Mobil shareholder proposal "took
an awful lot of time, as expected."
During yesterday's conference
call, SCIR members decided to defer
action on a shareholder resolution
which would bar Ford Motor Co.
sales toAfrican military orpolice. CIR

recommended that the University
support the proposal during their
Wednesday meeting.
According to Adams, trustee
committee members "read the (CIR)
recommendations and background,
but many (SCIR) members had not
received information on" the prop
osal. The issue will be decided at
the Board of Trustees meeting on
May 7.
The SCIR also decided "after
lengthy debate" to vote against a
shareholder resolution which would
halt Eastman Kodak sales of photo
graphic supplies that could be used
for oppressive practives by the South
African government, according to
Adams.
On April 18, CIR recommended
that the University abstain from ac
tion on this resolution. The CIR re
port noted that Kodak policy con
forms closely to U.S. laws prohibit
ing sales to South African military
and police.
The commission's report said that
while the shareholder resolution has
a "sound" purpose, its wording
"remains vague and of dubious
workability.
"Kodak historically has had an ex
cellent record of social responsibility
in South Africa, and it has indicated
that it would be willing to consider
other questionable uses of its pro
ducts by the South African govern
ment."
According to Hillier, the University
owns 44,500 shares of Kodak stock.
The annual meeting of Kodak
shareholders convenes May 2.
Adams noted that although the
trustees committee had voted
against the shareholder resolution,
committee members decided to
send a letter to Kodak Co. manage
ment "pointing out that a clearer pol
icy on Kodak sales would be desira
ble."
