# Resistance leader recalls struggle against Germans
## 
### Robert Reed 
Though finding it difficult to dis
cuss old wounds in what for him is a
new language, Abba Kovner, leader
of the resistance movement in
Lithuania during World War 11, spoke
here Wednesday on Jewish military
resistance to the Nazis.
In a brief address to a Hillei lunc
heon gathering, Kovner said he still
sees in his mind the horrors of the
Holocaust.
Specifically, Kovner recounted an
incident in which a young girl friend
of his was taken from her town along
with 109 other Jewish women,
marched to a mountain ridge, forced
to strip before Nazi S.S. troops and
shot. Only a wounded twelve-year
old girl survived to describe the inci
dent, Kovner said.
In contrast, one of the "happiest"
moments in his life came when one
of his friends broke into a Nazi camp
and stole a gun, symbolizing for the
Jewish ghetto in which they lived
their will to resist the Nazis, he said.
Four years later, Kovner went to
Jerusalem in hopes of obtaining aid
forthe resistance. Atfirst, he said, he
found only loneliness and fear; but
then "someone touched my shoul
der.
"In Judaism, it is the most singular
thing in our heritage to be one of a
million—to know that the one needs

the nine and the nine needs the
tenth." said Kovner, alluding to the
Jewish "minyan," the traditional
minimum of 10 males considered
necessary for conducting public
worship.
"I put on the hat and became one
of the million,"he said.
"Every minority in World War II
stood against one enemy—the Ger
mans," said Kovner, explaining that
all the various non-Aryan com
munities of Eastern Europe were en
dangered by the Nazis.
Though language barriers were
sometimes a problem in connecting
Jews of various countries through
the underground, Kovner said, "We
understood all our angers."
A major problem Kovner noted
was that many Jews didn't trust re
ports from the underground about
events elsewhere.
Kovner said "isolation was total"
among Jewish ghettos, so accounts
of genocide in one were not com
monly heard in the others.
Another great problem, he said,
was the Nazis' system of "illusion,"
in which Jews were told they were
being sent to factories to work rather
than being sent to concentration
camps to die. Kovner said women
and children typically would disguise
themselves as men so that they could
work, only to be led to their doom.
