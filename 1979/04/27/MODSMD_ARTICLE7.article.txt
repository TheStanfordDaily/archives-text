# Leaflets help cut speeding
## 
### Jim Spirakis 
The leafletting of cars by un
iformed policemen in a Palo Alto
motorist education project aimed
at greater compliance with local
speed limits has resulted in a sig
nificant drop in the average speed
rate in targeted areas, according
to Palo Alto police.
Begun in January 1978 in re
sponse to observed higher speed
rates in residential areas and the
increased concerns of local resi
dents, the program has caused
average speeds to drop by as
much as 5 mph in the first six
months, police spokesperson
Bob Harvey said.
Leaflets distributed by officers
from the city's Selective Traffic En
forcement Program (STEP) to pas
sing cars remind drivers that traf
fic safety is increased if the posted
limits of 25 mph are observed.
According to Harvey, "The pur
pose of the group is to gain com
pliance with local speed limits
through motorist education and
improved traffic engineering with
the final aim of reducing the rate
of automobile accidents."
The term "selective traffic en
forcement" reflects that certain

roads with unusually high acci
dent rates are singled out for spe
cial attention.
The streets included in the STEP
program, Harvey said, are
Middlefield, Arastradero, Willow,
Embarcadero, University, El
Camino Real (north of Embarcad
ero), Alma and Oregon Express
way. The first five streets pass
largely through residential areas
with school rones and have 25
mph speed limits.
Harvey added that the distribu
tion of leaflets was preceded by
widespread newspaper adver
tisements and other publicity, so
that motorists would have "a fair
warning" before enforcement
techniques were applied.
Public response has generally
been positive, with most com
plaints being limited to people liv
ing outside of the Palo Alto area.
Several citizens of Menlo Park,
however, have indicated that they
would like to see the program
started in their area.
The program is federally funded
by a two year, $180,000 grant
through the State of California Of
fice of Traffic Safety.
