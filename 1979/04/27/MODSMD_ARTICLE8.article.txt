# Dish stands idle in Stanford foothills

### Brian Sprague 
Overlooking the red tiles of
the University stands an impre
ssive 150-foot radar dish. And
that's exactly what it does
along with most of the other
pieces of astronomical wizar
dry strewn across the hills —
just stands.
Even though some of the
equipment is considered to be
the finest in the world, about
80 percent of the various field
sites on the University envi
rons are not functioning due to
lack of funds, according to
Werner Graf, senior research
associate at Stanford Elec
tronics Laboratories (SEL).
In the early 19405, University
professors obtained approxi
mately $4.5 million from re
search offices in the three
branches of the military to con
struct the Dish and other sites.
The chances for a motivated
student to become involved in
radar research were great, and
many did.
Graf claimed that the Uni
versity's Radio Astronomy In
stitute would often hire six
students while the Magnetos
phere Research Group,
headed by Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Robert Helliwell
would employ 12 more. Sev
eral additional students were
hired by the other four re
search groups in the Radio Sci

ence Lab.
But times have changed.
Today no students work with
Graf and the numbers
employed by other professors
have similarly declined. Fund
ing now comes primarily from
the National Science Founda
tion (NSF), which is not as lib
eral with grants as was the De
fense Department.
"Back then you could scrib
ble on a piece of paper, send it
off and they'd send you
money," Graf said of the De
fense Department.
He added that government
funding for all radio research
projects seems to be going
more to the huge national as
tronomy complexes rather
than to individual universities.
Currently the radio labs here
are being maintained solely by
NSF's approximate $2.6 million
contribution. This can only be
obtained after professors
submit proposals to NSF and
have them approved for fund
ing.
Classified projects
The University no longer ac
cepts classified governmental
projects involving the Dish.
According to Graf, such pro
jects prohibited students from
entering specified areas of the
University and therefore de
tracted from the University's
educational atmosphere.

But although the lands
around the projects were sub
sequently opened up to stu
dents, the facilities there were
not. Dr. David Bacon, associate
director of SEL agreed that
fewer students are being
employed there. But he added
that there is little the University
can do.
"We could open up some
facilities for students to use,
but you don't use something
just because it's usable. You
use it for a reason," he said.
Due to that lack of use, the
Dish has been informally put
up for 'sale. In addition, this
drop in usage was the deter
mining factor in offering the
mainland Chinese government
the heliopolis complex by Felt
Lake, an offer the Chinese re
fused, Graf said.
Money, not quality
The decline in use is not due
to a deterioration in the quality
of proposals submitted by pro
fessors and researchers, Graf
claimed. Just a few months
ago, Electrical Engineering
Prof. Ronald Bracewell prop
osed a short-term plan to
utilize the Dish to aid the fail
ing Voyager satellite on its mis
sion. Graf said the decline was
due simply to a lack of cold
hard cash and a few resear
chers said they believe that if
the overhead were cut, NSF
might look more closely at
funding more projects on
campus.
$79,000
A typical research project,
such as Bracewell's, involves a
professor, two research assis
tants and one graduate stu
dent. Direct cost is about
$50,000, according to Kent
Price, another senior research
associate. A 58 percent over
head charge is then levied by
the University to compensate
for indirect costs which the
University has incurred. There
fore researchers must usually
ask NSF for a grant of $79,000,
$29,000 of which they will
never see.
Included in the indirect
costs, explained Dean of Re
search Robert Street, are de
preciation of buildings and
materials, operative costs such
as upkeep of roads and water
and electric bills, general ad
ministration, departmental
administration and library up
keep, necessary because the
research team uses University
libraries during the course of
the project.
Street said that the Univer
sity attempts to determine the
aggregate indirect cost of all

research on campus and then
"averages out the costs" to all
projects.
It is a fundamental policy
here to have full recovery of all
indirect costs of doing re
search, according to Street.
Even with the 58 percent over
head, the University often
loses money on the projects
because of regulations which
force the researchers to com
ply with equal employment
policies, to act in accordance
with clean airand water regula
tions and to protect the welfare
of human subjects. All these
rules demand more paper
work, more administration and
therefore more indirect costs
per project, he said.
High-priced?
Most researchers said they
realize the overhead is a neces
sary addition because it pays
for University services, but
several dislike the administra
tion of it and believe it to be
high-priced for the services the
University performs.
"It's taxation without rep
resentation," said Dr. Anthony
Fraser-Smith, senior research
associate forSEL. "Noone here
knows where it goes."
But the most common objec
tion to the high overhead is
that out of the 58 percent, none
is put aside as a relief fund for
researchers whose project has
run into financial hardship.
"We're really only getting
back what we've already
spent," said Bacon. "The Uni
versity is in a budget crunch
just to keep its head above wa
ter."
He recognized that there
was a valid need to have aid
funds, but repeated that
money is tight.
"There are certain paths of
recourse for the financially dis
traught researcher," said Ba
con. He emphasized that the
researcher can go to the vice
provost, his department
chairman or the dean. How
ever, since only limited funds
are available, it is questionable
whether the researcher will re
ceive the money.
Therefore, the chance for
more students to utilize the
facilities in the foothills seems
remote assuming current
policies of NSF and the Univer
sity remain. The only alterna
tives are for a group of in
terested students to initiate a
project and to submit it to NSF
themselves, orfor them to per
suade a professor to teach a
course using one of the field
sites.

The impressive 150-foot Dish in the Stanford foothills stands idle, along with more unused radio
equipment nearby. The sites were developed in the 1950s at more than $4.5 million. Today the
equipment is up for sale at an undisclosed price.
