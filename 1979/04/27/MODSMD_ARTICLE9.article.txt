Los Angeles (AP) — Com
plaints about thequality of new
home construction and re
modeling work are increasing
sharply in California and con
sumer protection doesn't
seem to be keeping up.
"The public is getting short
changed," said Mel Cooper,
registrar of the Contractors
State License Board, whose
agency regulates the estimated
122,000 contractors active in
California.
"We simply don't have the
staff for the caseload that's de
veloped," Cooper said, noting
that only about 25,000 of the
36,000 complaints his 250-man
agency got lastyear were inves
tigated.
Cooper is also unhappy
about the lour to five months
the CSLB takes to process a
contractor's license applica
tion and would like to see a
sizeable increase in staffing to
alleviate the problem.
He points out that the CSLB
is funded completely through
licensing fees and now has a
surplus of more than $6 mill
ion, money he feels should be
used to beef up the board.
"The number of licensees
has grown so rapidly that the
money has built up, but be
cause of staffing problems and
the number of complaints, it
sometimes takes six months
before we can get a deputy in
the field to handle a com
plaint," Cooper said.
Most of the CSLB's regulat
ory activities involve remodel
ing work. Cooper said, noting
that buyers of new homes are
pretty much on their own as far
as policing the quality of the
work.
"I don't know of any re
course for a new home buyer
when there's a problem with
construction except the civil

courts," Cooper said. "What
people should do before they
part with their hard-earned
money is investigate
thoroughly."
Cooper recommends that
new buyers inspect well the
house in question before es
crow closes and insist that any
needed repairs be included, in
writing, in the escrow agree
ment.
"If you don't have it in writ
ing and there's not enough
money left in escrow to take
care of the work, you're going
to have trouble," he warned.
Philip Decker, a San Jose at
torney who is a public member
of the CSLB board, recom
mends getting a lawyer for any
work done by a contractor.
"The best advice is to urge
people to see a lawyer before
they put pen to paper," Decker
said. "
