## Strive for objective, accurate Daily 
### 
My heart bleeds for the
Daily. The staff is overworked,
underpaid and often inexperi
enced. The staff numbers too
few, and, worst of all, is going
to school.
Ron Lillejord'sand LeeTien's
article "On criticism of the
Daily," offers a tacit defense of
the Daily's ineptitude. Appa
rently, the Daily handling of
Spring ASSU elections was fol
lowed by a deluge of criticisms,
some of which the Daily staff
does not consider valid. I be
lieve the criticisms, whether
valid or not, were rightly
placed. It is the Daily's job to
answer these criticisms and it is
the Daily's responsibility to
stand by and defend what it
prints.
Lillejord and Tien argue that
students should not expect
perfection. I agree. Perfection
is not what we want, but we do
demand fairness. Lillejord and
Tien mention that under the
circumstances accuracy is un
attainable, and that objectivity
is unrealistic, and that fairness
is only a possibility.

I never expected Daily
editors to admit that their
editorials are worthless. The
Daily's credibility is now at
stake. If the Daily does not st
rive for objectivity, accuracy
and fairness, then it is a worth
less rag; it certainly isn't worth
two cents.
I recognize that the Daily is
not a professional newspaper.
If Lillejord and Tien believe
that the staff is in above their
necks then perhaps they
shouldn't attempt some of the
same tasks of professional
newspapers (i.e. candidate or
fee-assessment endorse
ments).
The Daily should stop pre
tending that it can effectively
do such things. In the Daily's
case some things are best left
undone rather than having
them done in a quasi
objective, less-than profes
sional manner.
With the passing of its fee
assessment the Daily has in
stitutionalized itself. It is here
and will remain whether we
like it or not. The possibility

now exists for the Daily to con
tinue printing with student
money, even if students vote
down its fee assessment. The
Daily usually defends itself by
printing the usual dogma that it
provides a student service.
The Daily obviously has a
problem evaluating its value to
the community. Sure 70 per
cent of the voting students
passed the Daily tee assess
ment, but do they want the
Da//y? Or do they just want a
newspaper? How much stu
dent input does the Daily at
tempt to gather? What do stu
dents want? More local news?
Or more national news? I'll bet
the Daily doesn't even know.
My evaluation of the Daily is
that on some issues it has been
inconsistent, short-sighted, in
sensitive, and biased. Some
times, it seems the Daily is a
non-community, non-student,
profit-oriented business. It
lacks student input and is
marked by a definite lack of
awareness. Minority issues and
other simple student concerns
are not aired. I do not think the

Daily can boast of very many
investigative articles that have
benefited students or the
community. Deadlines and
staff shortages are no excuse.
I have never had any qualms
in retrieving my dollar fee as
sessment in form of protest,
especially now that the Daily
has a large reserve fund. I will
continue to do so until the
Daily acts as a responsible
body to the University, its stu
dents and the community.
Finally, Lillejord and Tien ar
rogantly tell us that they want
to hear constructive truthful
criticism. I urge students to
criticize the Daily for whatever
reasons they feel valid. It is
time the Daily stop separating
itself from the student body
and become part of it.

To this, there is one clarifica
tion that I "arrogantly" would
like to assert: I voted against
the Daily fee assessment.

Daily. The staff is overworked,
underpaid and often inexperi
enced. The staff numbers too
few, and, worst of all, is going
to school.
Ron Lillejord'sand LeeTien's
article "On criticism of the
Daily," offers a tacit defense of
the Daily's ineptitude. Appa
rently, the Daily handling of
Spring ASSU elections was fol
lowed by a deluge of criticisms,
some of which the Daily staff
does not consider valid. I be
lieve the criticisms, whether
valid or not, were rightly
placed. It is the Daily's job to
answer these criticisms and it is
the Daily's responsibility to
stand by and defend what it
prints.
Lillejord and Tien argue that
students should not expect
perfection. I agree. Perfection
is not what we want, but we do
demand fairness. Lillejord and
Tien mention that under the
circumstances accuracy is un
attainable, and that objectivity
is unrealistic, and that fairness
is only a possibility.

I never expected Daily
editors to admit that their
editorials are worthless. The
Daily's credibility is now at
stake. If the Daily does not st
rive for objectivity, accuracy
and fairness, then it is a worth
less rag; it certainly isn't worth
two cents.
I recognize that the Daily is
not a professional newspaper.
If Lillejord and Tien believe
that the staff is in above their
necks then perhaps they
shouldn't attempt some of the
same tasks of professional
newspapers (i.e. candidate or
fee-assessment endorse
ments).
The Daily should stop pre
tending that it can effectively
do such things. In the Daily's
case some things are best left
undone rather than having
them done in a quasi
objective, less-than profes
sional manner.
With the passing of its fee
assessment the Daily has in
stitutionalized itself. It is here
and will remain whether we
like it or not. The possibility

now exists for the Daily to con
tinue printing with student
money, even if students vote
down its fee assessment. The
Daily usually defends itself by
printing the usual dogma that it
provides a student service.
The Daily obviously has a
problem evaluating its value to
the community. Sure 70 per
cent of the voting students
passed the Daily tee assess
ment, but do they want the
Da//y? Or do they just want a
newspaper? How much stu
dent input does the Daily at
tempt to gather? What do stu
dents want? More local news?
Or more national news? I'll bet
the Daily doesn't even know.
My evaluation of the Daily is
that on some issues it has been
inconsistent, short-sighted, in
sensitive, and biased. Some
times, it seems the Daily is a
non-community, non-student,
profit-oriented business. It
lacks student input and is
marked by a definite lack of
awareness. Minority issues and
other simple student concerns
are not aired. I do not think the

Daily can boast of very many
investigative articles that have
benefited students or the
community. Deadlines and
staff shortages are no excuse.
I have never had any qualms
in retrieving my dollar fee as
sessment in form of protest,
especially now that the Daily
has a large reserve fund. I will
continue to do so until the
Daily acts as a responsible
body to the University, its stu
dents and the community.
Finally, Lillejord and Tien ar
rogantly tell us that they want
to hear constructive truthful
criticism. I urge students to
criticize the Daily for whatever
reasons they feel valid. It is
time the Daily stop separating
itself from the student body
and become part of it.
(Dante Ruiz is a junior majoring
in human biology.)
To this, there is one clarifica
tion that I "arrogantly" would
like to assert: I voted against
the Daily fee assessment.
