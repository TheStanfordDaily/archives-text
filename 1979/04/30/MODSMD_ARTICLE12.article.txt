## End welfare directed to powerful 
### 
President Jimmy Carter has
just treated us to a new round
of demagoguery regarding
business profits and so-called
oil company "windfalls," yet
he has studiously ignored the
industry whose profits rose
6000 percent last year (yes, 6000
percent). Which industry was
this? Oil companies that cheat
and gouge us? Coal companies
who rape the environment?
Predatory landlords?
Try the steel companies.
How did they manage it? By in
novating? By increasing their
capital investment, efficiency
or productivity? No.
What happened was that the
steel companies got together

and convinced the federal
government to help them. And
help them it did.
Under steel industry pres
sure, the U.S. government in
stituted the "trigger price
mechanism," which in effect
set a floor under the price of
steel in the U.S. The volume of
imports declined substantially,
and prices beneath the new
floor price disappeared. Thus
the 6000 percent rise in profits.
This travesty, carried out in
"the public interest," de
"monstrates who the real
enemy of the American public
is — the government. In a free
market, business is con
strained by the competition of
other businesses in the indus
try, potential new competitors
and consumer resistance. It is
only through the intrusion of
government into the economy,
which limits these countervail
ing influences, that the public
gets the royal shaft.
Examples of such abusive in
terferences with the free mar
ket are übiquitous. For exam
ple, up until a couple of years
ago, the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB) was dedicated to
eliminating the very thought of
competition in the airlines in
dustry. It denied all applica
tions for new routes and car
riers, maintaining tight control

over all facets of airline opera
tions. Potential competition
was stifled and prices kept arti
ficially high.
But the last two years have
witnessed the miracle of dere
gulation: a literal-revolution in
the airlines industry has occur
red. As airline operations have
become unfettered, fares have
dropped dramatically — wit
ness the newly inaugurated $99
Oakland-New York service —
and passenger miles flown
have greatly expanded. The
American public has been the
unambiguous beneficiary.
A similar problem now exists
with the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC). Its relent
less crusade against competi
tion has been wholeheartedly
supported by the Teamsters
and the established trucking
companies, who profit from
bleeding the taxpayer and con
sumer dry. The ICC promul
gates idiotic rules and regula
tions such as requiring trucks
to travel empty on return trips.
The American taxpayers and
consumers pay the bill.
Ihe list of legal barriers to
competition continues: milk
price supports, sugar quotas
and textile tariffs. At every
turn, private groups band to
gether and use government to
rob the rest of us.

But it is riot enough to
suggest limiting the power of
the various special interests.
Any such limits are necessarily
arbitrary, and merely alter the
balance of power between
competing interests.
The fundamental evil is not
special interest influence —
such influence means nothing
unless there is something to in
fluence. Rather, the evil is the
existence of a government that
has the power to rip us all off at
the behest of the special in
terests.
Hftorts to strictly limit the
power of government —
whether it be to tax, spend,
spy, jail or whatever — should
be vigorously supported. The
entire fraudulent scheme ot a
rapacious government plun
dering us in "the public in
terest" must be ended.
What we have now is welfare
for (he politically powerful. But
our enemy is really not the
politically powerful, whether it
be Big Business or Big Labor.
Or special interests or greedy
individuals. The true enemy is
the coercive apparatus that is
endowed with the legitimacy,
the official sanction and the
raw power to rape us all. Our
enemy is government itself.
