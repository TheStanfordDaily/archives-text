Don't fence lake off
As many of the joggers who
now use the footpaths around
Lake Lagunita undoubtably
know, the University is con
structing a fence to keep
people from using the )unip
ero Serra Boulevard approach.
This fence will render the path
unusable to the many who use
it and the lake each day.
I will not bother to ask why
the University must construct
another barrier to the outside
world, another restriction of
the right of people in the
community to use the facilities
of this service-oriented institu
tion.
Since I am a student here, I
will merely point out that, the
way that the fence is laid out, it
makes it impossible for joggers
to use the path around the lake
at all.
Since the University feels
that the fence is necessary, it is
incumbent on the administra
tion to minimize the barrier's
inconvenience to those who
use the lake and its related
facilities. Specifically, the Unir
versify should construct an al
ternative path for joggers to
use, and it should provide
some way for members of the
community to use the lake if
they wish to do so.
Lake Lagunita is a valuable
resource which should be av
ailable to as many people who
reside in the area as possible,
be they joggers, swimmers,
boaters or mere passers by. If
the lake is fenced off and re
ndered useless to the com
munity, it will become nothing
more than a beautiful nui
sance.

Badly taken humor
After receiving dire threats
on my reputation and my life, I
decided to write a rebuttal to
my article on fraternities
{Daily, April 27) for anyone
who may have misinterpreted
it. Being from Portland, Ore
gon where the pounding rain
has dulled my sense of humor
over the years, I obviously
poked a little too hard at a sen-

sitive time â€” the last day of
rush.
I personally have nothing
against the fraternity system. Jn
fact, I believe the campus
would be a sadder place with
out it, and definitely more bor
ing on weekends. I do believe,
however, that definite
stereotypes exist in the minds
of people who do not belong
to fraternities, and these
stereotypes do contain a tiny
grain of truth (except for the
dead cats). However, in point
ingthem out, I was simply mak
ing fun of the stereotypes
themselves, not the fraternity
system as a whole.
I owe a special apology to the
Kappa Sigs, having attended
one of their rush parties last
Thursday evening. Far from
being nerds, they were as
sloshed and incoherent as any
rowdies. Besides, I got thereat
11:30 one Saturday evening

and was still able to catch a seat
for Saturday Night Live.
I would like to conclude by
saying that I never intended to
condemn fraternities. They
undoubtedly give the best par
ties on campus, are among the
most avid participants in in
tramural and varsity sports,
and contain some of the most
intelligent and best looking
men on campus. But some of
them sure have a lousy sense of
humor.
