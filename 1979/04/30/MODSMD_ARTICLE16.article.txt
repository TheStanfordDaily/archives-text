# Seaweed potential energy source

### Matthew Kreps 
Seaweed may someday be
the ultimate lood and power
source for the world.
A horde of researchers is
now working four miles off the
Calitornia coast near Newport
Beach to construct a giant kelp
farm that could be the
forerunner of a huge supply of
natural gas.
Kelp farms are seen as one
potential source of biomass
energy, which involves con
verting the solar energy stored
in living plants and animals into
liquid or gas tuels.
Present-day technology is
being refined to convert the
fast-growing kelp into a
number of products, including
nitrogen-rich fertilizer;
methane, a component of
natural gas, and algin, a chemi
cal used to smooth and thicken
more than 500 products from
ice cream to paints. Even the
dry residue can be used as fod
der for cattle, chickens, pigs
and sheep.
The Newport Beach farm,
built in September 1978 as the
latest in a series of experimen
tal marine farms, involves
seven different private and
public agencies, and is being
funded by the U.S. Dept. of
Energy and the Gas Research
Institute.

The researchers want to find
out if the prolific seaweed can
be cultivated far from shore in
deep water, where there
would be plenty of room to es
tablish huge kelp farms.
The kelp is being grown on a
structure resembling the top of
an upside-down umbrella, 102
feet in diameter and anchored
50 feet beneath the ocean's
surface. The plants are moored
by their holdfasts — a rootlike
system at each plant's bottom
— to stainless steel and nylon
mooring lines strung around
the "umbrella's" steel ribs.
Because the ocean's surface
water is poor in the nutrients
the kelp needs, a 25-inch
diameter pipe plunges 1500
feet into the sea below and
pumps up 10,000 gallons a mi
nute of cool, nutrient-rich
water to fertilize the kelp. So
tar, pumping such cold water
to the surface does not seem to
be causing any damage to the
marine environment.
1()-acre farm
While the $4 million farm is
scheduled to run for 24
months, Environmental
Studies Prof. Wheeler North of
Cal Tech said, "I hope that in a
year I'll have a gut feeling as to
which direction it's going." If
all goes well, he plans a 10-acre

farm. If that succeeds? "The
sea's the limit," he said.
Other seaweed can be effi
ciently converted to energy,
but kelp was selected for the
experiment because it is easily
grown and has been well
studied. It grows as much as
two feet a day, reaching
lengths of 200 feet and forming
pillars of 50 or more fronds,
with a dense canopy on top.
Specially-designed ships
ride along the surface and har
vest the topmost fronds, pul
ling in between 500 and 500 wet
tons per acre every year. More
than 140,000 tons of kelp are
already being harvested in
California annually.
Dried out
To convert the kelp into
methane, the seaweed is dried
out, coarsely chopped, and
processed in airless digestors,
where it is mixed with heated
seawater and allowed to fer
ment.
Bacteria "digest" the kelp
and give off methane.
Existing technology can take
900 wet tons of kelp a day and
convert it into 3.7 million stan
dard cubic feet of methane.
Other processes yield by
products such as algin,
ethanol, sludge for fertilizer
and dried cake for animal fod
der.

But kelp doesn t have to be
converted to provide energy.
Kelp farms can provide cover
for herds of marine life, which
can be caught for food. Besides
feeding animals, it can even be
processed directly into
nourishing, if somewhat less
than appetizing, food for
people.
Biomass conversion
Using biomass conversion
for energy has its advantages
and disadvantages.
Prof. Channing Robertson of
the chemical engineering de
partment here points out that
land-based "biomass planta
tions," such as eucalyptus
forests, would simply not be
efficient in energy-hungry
countries like the United
States.
"It would take 200 million
acres of eucalyptus — 10 per
cent of the 48 states' land mass
— to supply the country's en
tire natural gas requirements in
1975," Robertson said. "It just
isn't feasible here."
However, underdeveloped
countries with large areas of
land, such as Brazil and Africa,
could find land-based "energy
plantations" a cheap and re
newable source of energy.
And, Robertson added,
"ocean-based biomass is a dif
ferent story."
