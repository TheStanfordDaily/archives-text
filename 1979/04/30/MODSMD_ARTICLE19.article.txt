## 
### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's men's and wo
men's tennis teams wound up
the weekend with two appear
ances in the finals of the Ojai
Intercollegiate and Open
Tournament. Kathy )ordan
reached the intercollegiate
women's finals where she lost
6-4, 6-J to Stacy Margolin of
USC. Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne gave the Cards their
only title when they defeated
Eric Sherbeck and Alan
Waldman 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 in the in
tercollegiate doubles.
The Cards finished second in
the Pac-10 six points behind
the champion, top-ranked
UCLA.

For the men's team it started
out as if the weekend would be
a total disaster as only No. 2
man Bourne escaped through
the first day without being
eliminated from the singles.
Kennert, who has established
himself as one of the top
players in the nation suffered a
humbling 7-6, 6-.} loss to UC
LA's No. 6 man Marcel
Freeman in the first round. Re
nnert, however, had been
struggling with illness and had
not had a chance to practice
earlier in the week and felt
mentally that he wasn't up for
the match.
Freshmen Tim Mayotte and
Scott Bondurant were the only

ones besides Bourne to get
past the first round in the sing
les. Mayotte defeated Tonnie
Sic of Arizona State 7-6, 6-4 and
Bondurant beat Cal's No. 1
man, Scott McCain in three
sets 7-6, 6-2, 6-4.
Lloyd Bourne, who said he
was "starting to play with much
more confidence" had a good
tournament reaching the quar
ters before losing 6-4,6-3 to top
seeded Robert Van't Hof.
Bourne squeaked out a 7-5, J-6,
7-6 decision over Cal's Chris
Dunk in the first round. He
came back to play what he
termed as "his best match of
the year" in defeating USC's
Sean Brawley before losing to

Van't Hof.
In the open doubles, Re
nnert and Bourne avenged an
early defeat to USC's top team
Van't Hof and Roger Knapp by
crushing them 6-3, 6-4 in the
semis to reach the finals. In the
finals the Cards took the match
from the Sun Devils in a 7-6,7-6
victory.
In women's action, Stan
ford's kathy Jordan and Alycia
Moulton and USC's Stacy Mar
golin and Maria Fernandez
continued to prove they were
without a doubt the top players
in the nation. All four reached
the semis of the women's in
tercollegiate with Margolin tak
ing the title with a semi-final

victory over Moulton and a
final triumph over Jordan. Jor
dan defeated Fernandez 6-2,
7-5 to reach the finals.
For Jordan it had to be a dis
appointing loss. She recently
defeated Margolin in their
match here. The two seem de
stined to meet again in lowa in

June for the AIAW.
Coach Ann Gould is reach
ing for a solid No. 2 doubles
team since the departure of
Diane Morrison, Susie Hagey
and Donna Rubin may fill the
void as they reached the semis
of the open doubles.

The Card men go back into
action this weekend against
the Arizona schools, although
several members of the team
will be playing in the California
State Championships this
week at Berkeley. The women
are idle until their May 11 re
match with UCLA.


PRACTICING UP for the Ojai Intercollegiates is Kathy (ordan. In her case, the axiom "practice makes
perfect" almost rang true, for she made it to the finals before falling to USC's Stacy Margolin, at the
intercollegiate tournament that ended yesterday.
