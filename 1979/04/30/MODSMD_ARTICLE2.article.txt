# RAs discuss drinking abuses

### Alisa Terrell 
A growing concern with the prob
lem of alcohol abuse at Iraternity
rush parties prompted a meeting hri
day of house associates (RAs), resi
dent fellows and house officers from
fraternities and freshmen residences
with Norm Robinson and Mike Bever
from the Office for Residential Edu
cation.
There has been an increasing
number of complaints and com
ments in the last few years from resi
dent fellows and RAs concerning the
behavior of students returning from
fraternity open houses, Robinson
said.
Incidents reported have ranged
from very drunk students who have
used their dorm rooms ,is bathrooms
to cases of alcohol poisoning with
students near death, he said.
"fraternity rush is not regulated by
the University, and the University is.
not particularly interested in getting
involved," Robinson told approxi
mately 60 persons in the Madera
lounge.
"It alcohol abuse doesn't change,
however, we can't continue this pol
icy. Alcohol is a growing problem."
During the ensuing discussion, de
finite divisions developed between
the fraternity and dormitory rep
resentatives.
RAs and resident fellows expres

sed concern that alcohol played sue h
an important role in the rushee's in
troduction to fraternities.
"There's one hell of a lot of peer
pressure. Drinking is equated with
being a good fellow. Drinking is
equated with frat life," said Bert
King, resident fellow at Donner.
"If you don't drink, you're a
wimp," he said.
Fraternity representatives, how
ever, noted the importance of indi
vidual choice and responsibility.
"Drinking too much is a person's
own decision. He should know his
own limits," Dan Summers, RA at
Delta Tau Delta, said.
"If this thing happens (a student
drinking too much), the responsibil
ity shifts more into the dorm's realm.
It's a dual problem," Summers said.
Sandra Pearson, resident fellow at
Madera, did not agree.
"There is no notion of the pressure
that RAs and non-drinking students
are under — the price we have to pay
for drunken debauches," Pearson
said. "Our RAs have to put up with so
much crap."
"The fraternities have the respon
sibility to create a context where it's
easier to be responsible, not irres
ponsible," Lyman Van Slyke, resi
dent fellow at Twain, said.
"I would urge that you take
another look at the context. Can

freshmen have a good time and be
responsible?" he continued.
Possible solutions to alleviate the
problem included dormitory alcohol
education programs, as well as an
earlier scheduling of fraternity open
houses. If open houses were from 4
until (> p.m., students would be less
likely to drink too much, and-could
return to their dormitories for din
ner.
"I lindit rather incredible that frats
have to drink at rush functions. Will
you not survive if you don't have al
cohol?'' Pearson asked.
However, fraternity representa
tives did not respond favorably to as
sertions that alcohol should not be a
part of fraternity rush.
'.'Alcohol is in our society. There
are enough things we're sheilded
from," a fraternity representative
said. "We don't have to shield our
18-year-old 'little boys.' "
Although no decisions were made,
Robinson said he viewed the meet
ing "as the start and not the end of
the disc ussion. We need to focus not
only on fraternities with this prob
lem; this is a University-wide prob
lem.
"We've got the responsibility to
conduct some kind of program.
What that will be, I don't know yet,
but something will be done," Robin
son said.

that RAs and non-drinking students
are under — the price we have to pay
for drunken debauches," Pearson
said. "Our RAs have to put up with so
much crap."
"The fraternities have the respon
sibility to create a context where it's
easier to be responsible, not irres
ponsible," Lyman Van Slyke, resi
dent fellow at Twain, said.
"I would urge that you take
another look at the context. Can

freshmen have a good time and be
responsible?" he continued.
Possible solutions to alleviate the
problem included dormitory alcohol
education programs, as well as an
earlier scheduling of fraternity open
houses. If open houses were from 4
until (> p.m., students would be less
likely to drink too much, and-could
return to their dormitories for din
ner.
"I lindit rather incredible that frats
have to drink at rush functions. Will
you not survive if you don't have al
cohol?'' Pearson asked.
However, fraternity representa
tives did not respond favorably to as
sertions that alcohol should not be a
part of fraternity rush.
'.'Alcohol is in our society. There
are enough things we're sheilded
from," a fraternity representative
said. "We don't have to shield our
18-year-old 'little boys.' "
Although no decisions were made,
Robinson said he viewed the meet
ing "as the start and not the end of
the disc ussion. We need to focus not
only on fraternities with this prob
lem; this is a University-wide prob
lem.
"We've got the responsibility to
conduct some kind of program.
What that will be, I don't know yet,
but something will be done," Robin
son said.
