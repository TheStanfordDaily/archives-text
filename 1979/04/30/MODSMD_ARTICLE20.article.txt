# Cards outrun, but never give up
## 
### Hobey Landreth 
There is something about
this Stanford track team that
stands out even when it
loses. It stood out one month
ago at the double dual meet in
Berkeley against Cal, USC and
UCLA. It stood out when it beat
Iresno, Occidental and Hay
ward. But it was most obvious
last Saturday in Stanford
Stadium when Cal whipped the
Cardinals in the Big Meet 117-
17. The team simply doesn't
quit.
The Cards worked against
the likes of Cal's Mike Marlow,
possibly the hottest triple
jumper in the country, and
against David Steen the Cal re
cord holder who |umped,
threw and vaulted his way to a
pair of lirst and second place
finishes. They had to contend
with Gary Blume, who at the
double dual last month won
both the steeplechase and the
5000-meter run handily. There
was no question that the com
petition was up.
To pick an illustration of the
Cardinal track attitude, take
the longest run of the after
noon. Roy Kissin was fresh for
the 5000-meter run as were his
teammates Rod Berry and
Craig Corey. Two hours earlier
Cal's Blume had set a new meet
record in the 5000-meter steep
lechase, and he was going to
try for the same in the 5000
along with fellow Cal runner
felix Elieff.
kissin and Blume led the
pack for the entire race. The
Card runner held the lead with
Blume right behind, waiting.
With two to go it became appa

rent that it would take quite an
effort for Blume to catch kissin,
and at the gun lap it looked to
be all kissin's race. And indeed
it was. A new meet record for
Stanford at 14:14.4. Elieff fol

lowed Blume tor third and
Berry took fourth.
Other Stanford wins came
from Cordon Banks in the
200-meter dash, Gary Bruner
who threw the javelin 222-

teet-7 and John Schaer who
took the 800-meter run.
In the 200 Banks was running
second behind Cal's Mike
Farmer when he noticed the
lead runner change lanes com
ing out of the turn. Banks
pointed wildly at full stride as
the Cal runner broke the tape.
1 he judges also saw the infrac
tion and Banks was awarded
the win in 21.5 thus equalling a
personal best.
Winterer is Stanford's only
hope in the high jump. He has
been out with minor injuries
for most of the season and for
his debut jumped 6-6.
Clay Bullwinkel faced Mike
Marlow as competition in the
triple jump but didn't let that
keep him from setting a per
sonal best of 48-s'/« for third
place.
Performances like the mile
relay indicate something to the
casual observer as well as the
educated track tan. It was the
last event of the day. Cal had
already set a new point scoring
record for the Big Meet, hut
the four man Cardinal team ran
as if the scoreboard meant no
thing, holding onto the lead
right up to the tape when Cal
runner Holden Smith edged in
for the win.
Something lingers in the
mind afterwards, the team so
far behind on the scoreboard,
yet giving so much right up to
the end.
"Not to take anything away
from Cal,"Jordan commented
after the meet. "They did a fine
job. But I'm sodarned proud of
this team."

pair of lirst and second place
finishes. They had to contend
with Gary Blume, who at the
double dual last month won
both the steeplechase and the
5000-meter run handily. There
was no question that the com
petition was up.
To pick an illustration of the
Cardinal track attitude, take
the longest run of the after
noon. Roy Kissin was fresh for
the 5000-meter run as were his
teammates Rod Berry and
Craig Corey. Two hours earlier
Cal's Blume had set a new meet
record in the 5000-meter steep
lechase, and he was going to
try for the same in the 5000
along with fellow Cal runner
felix Elieff.
kissin and Blume led the
pack for the entire race. The
Card runner held the lead with
Blume right behind, waiting.
With two to go it became appa

rent that it would take quite an
effort for Blume to catch kissin,
and at the gun lap it looked to
be all kissin's race. And indeed
it was. A new meet record for
Stanford at 14:14.4. Elieff fol

lowed Blume tor third and
Berry took fourth.
Other Stanford wins came
from Cordon Banks in the
200-meter dash, Gary Bruner
who threw the javelin 222-

teet-7 and John Schaer who
took the 800-meter run.
In the 200 Banks was running
second behind Cal's Mike
Farmer when he noticed the
lead runner change lanes com
ing out of the turn. Banks
pointed wildly at full stride as
the Cal runner broke the tape.
1 he judges also saw the infrac
tion and Banks was awarded
the win in 21.5 thus equalling a
personal best.
Winterer is Stanford's only
hope in the high jump. He has
been out with minor injuries
for most of the season and for
his debut jumped 6-6.
Clay Bullwinkel faced Mike
Marlow as competition in the
triple jump but didn't let that
keep him from setting a per
sonal best of 48-s'/« for third
place.
Performances like the mile
relay indicate something to the
casual observer as well as the
educated track tan. It was the
last event of the day. Cal had
already set a new point scoring
record for the Big Meet, hut
the four man Cardinal team ran
as if the scoreboard meant no
thing, holding onto the lead
right up to the tape when Cal
runner Holden Smith edged in
for the win.
Something lingers in the
mind afterwards, the team so
far behind on the scoreboard,
yet giving so much right up to
the end.
"Not to take anything away
from Cal,"Jordan commented
after the meet. "They did a fine
job. But I'm sodarned proud of
this team."
