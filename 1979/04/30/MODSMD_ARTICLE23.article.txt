Soccer, when played in its top form de
monstrates the payoff of uniting the physical
and mental aspects of the game. Friday's match
between Stanford and Cal State-Chico proved
this point as the Cardinals used versatility and
experience to brace a thinned-down team on
the way to victory.
While kelly Scott and lulie /ender were un
dergoing off-field exams in the form of MCAIs
and GREs respectively, the other members of
the team took their tests on the greens of
katherine Branson School in kentfield. Stanford
passed its examination with flying colors, adjust
ing to a different set of field conditions and the
lasting effects of the rash of injuries to beat
Chico 4-1.
The first variable to contend with was a field
much smaller than the accustomed Roble Held
with up to six inches of mud from the latest April
showers. '
It took 15 to 20 minutes before the Cardinals
began to dominate the match in their usual
style, according to head coach Phil Wright. Prior
to that, Chico had control and goalkeeper Joan
Sanders "made some great saves to keep us in
the game," Wright said.
With kris McGarrey and Pauline McNamara
both out with knee injuries, Catherine Morris
and Fran Roelfsema got their opportunity' to

shine, "playing superbly for 75 minutes,"
Wright pointed out. Maria Duryea, protecting
an ankle injury, was moved to wing, while mid
fielder kathy Kelley again filled in for Duryea as a
sweeper.
Wright has always lauded his team for being
coachable and no better example could be given
than Friday. He credited Kelley with settling the
game down, describing the game as an "excep
tional" showing of "their knowledge of the role
they have to play." He also cited Duryea's per
fect switch to wing as illustrating "how fantastic
she is."
Nancy Geisse started the scoring for Stanford,
putting in a goal late in the first half following a
pair of corner kicks and a barrage of shots at the
Chico goal.
The Cards' conditioning was evident as the
pace picked up in the second half. Ellen Griep
chalked up an unassisted goal just over 10 mi
nutes into the final period. Aftera quick-series of
passes and a blocked attempt by Duryea, Cindy
Shorney kicked in a goal for a M) Stanford lead.
Chico scored their lone goal on a long chip
shot, but Griep countered with her second goal,
the final tally of the game.
Sporting a perfect league record of 7-0, Stan
ford hosts Santa Clara Wednesday at 5:50 p.m.
