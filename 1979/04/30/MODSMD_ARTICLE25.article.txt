# Card nine drops 2 to USC, wins 1
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
It was a slugfest in Los
Angeles this past weekend.
USr pounded out 42 hits, Stan
ford countered with 41 and the
two 'earns scored a total of 63
run > in the three-game league
series.
But luck did not shine on the
Cardinals during their visit at

DeDeaux Field. USC won the
first two games of the series
12-8 and 14-7; Stanford com
manded the third 13-9.
Losing two games to the Tro
jans diminished Stanford's
hopes of getting an NCAA
play-off berth this year, but the
Cardinals have not yet been
mathematically eliminated

from post-season competition.
However, a second-place
finish from the position Stan
ford currently holds — that
which would allow the team to
play-off with the Northern Di
vision champion to determine
the second Pac-10 representa
tive in the NCAA champion
ship — will be a reality only if
the Cards win at least five out
of their last six conference
games.
The task of winning the last
five out of six will not be an
easy one for the Cards. In fact,
it looks almost impossible
when you notice who their last
two league series of the year
are against: league-leading
UCLA and second-place Cal.
In both the Thursday and
Friday night games, Stanford
pitchers got knocked around a
bit. Seniors Joe LoPresti and
Bruce Fiala, the two top per
formers on the Cardinal pitch
ing staff, each absorbed one

loss. LoPresti's record is now
7-5. Fiala is B-4.
Both pitchers were given
early game leads to work with,
but just couldn't hold the Tro
jans, according to Marquess.
There was also the matter of a
few errors in the first game: the
Stanford defense committed
five in the first two innings of
play.
After Friday's 14-7 loss in
which the Trojans clubbed
three more homeruns making
a total of five in the first two
games, Saturday was sweet re
venge for the Cards.
Freshman Bob DeCosta, a
San Leandro FHigh product, led
the 18-hit assault on five Trojan
pitchers. DeCosta, batting as
the designated hitter, drove in
four runs with a homerun and a
double.
First baseman John Pyle also
had a big day at the plate. Pyle
hit one of Stantord's five dou
bles in the game and collected

three other base hits.
Mike Codiroli and Bruce
Walters did their share to right
the imbalance of homeruns in
the series, each blasting one in
the contest.
Brian Harrison was the win
ning pitcher on Saturday, and
was praised by Marquess on
his second victory of a season
riddled with arm trouble.
The work is cut out for the
Cardinals now, and they know
it. There's nothing the players,
especially the seniors, would
like better than a chance at the
play-offs.

in recent Sunken Diamond action against St. Mary's. Zuvella cracked
out eight hits and stole four bases in three games against USC this past
weekend, but his efforts weren't enough as the Cardinals managed
just one victory.
