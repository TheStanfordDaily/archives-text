British mothers favor Tories
London — Young British mothers say they do not
like Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher's
upper middle-class accent and aggressive manner,
but they like the Labor Party's socialist policies
even less, according to an opinion poll published
yesterday.
The poll indicated mothers under the age of 45
— a group whose support some analysts consider
vital to victory — will vote for the Conservatives by
a 4-percentage-point margin over Labor in na
tional elections for a new Parliament May J.
The mothers, who account for 7 million of Bri
tain's 40 million registered voters, favored Labor
by a margin of 55 percent to 45 percent in the last
nationwide balloting five years ago.
A Conservative victory would make Thatcher
Britain's first woman prime minister, yet the
women polled by the Marplan organization
ranked herthird in fhe personal popularity contest
behind Labor Prime Minister lames Callaghan and
David Steel, leader of the Liberals, the third
strongest party.
Marplan said most of the 1017 women it ques
tioned in 51 of the 615 electoral districts listed
union pay demands as the primary cause for a
doubling of consumer prices during the past five
years of Labor Party rule.
Most of the women also said they believe that
Tory plans to cut taxes and scrap burdensome
state controls will bring a better life for their chil
dren, the poll reported.
Brezhnev suffers poor health
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev ate
with a spoon during most of a formal Kremlin
dinner, had trouble signing his name, needed
help walking up stairs and had lapses of attention
during some top-level meetings.
That picture of the 72-year-old Soviet leader
emerged during French President Valery Ciscard
d'Estaing's recent visit here. It focused the spot
light again on Brezhnev's health, which is known
to be delicate.
"There was nothing dramatic. But it was more
the general impression he made," one source said
about Brezhnev.
Publicly, French officials went out of theirway to
give the impression that Brezhnev was taking "an
active and continuing part" in the talks, as d'tsla

ing's spokesman Pierre Hunt put it.
But there was only one face-to-face meeting dur
ing the French leader's three-day visit, and the
summit, which ended Saturday, produced no
thing major.
During the entire Moscow summit, French re
porters were kept several yards away from
Brezhnev, and some grumbled that this was to
prevent them from scrutinizing him too closely.
U.N. official seeks peace in Asia
Peking — U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim brought his campaign for peace in South
east Asia to Peking yesterday and told Chinese
leaders that unless the situation is defused quickly
it could "deteriorate further with consequences
far beyond this region."
Waldheim was referring to the stalled peace
talks between China and Vietnam after their
month-long border war, and Vietnam'scontinuing
war in Cambodia.
"It is therefore imperative that all efforts be di
rected towards finding a settlement in conformity
with the principles of the charter of the United
Nations," Waldheim said at a banquet given in his
honor at the Great Hall of the People by Foreign
Minister Huang Hua.
The search for such a solution is the reason for
Waldheim's current Asian tour. He was politely
but firmly rebuffed in Vietnam, where Prime
Minister Pham Van Dong told him Vietnam was
not interested in formal mediation.
Vietnam, meanwhile, said yesterday that Chi
na's eight-point peace proposal was a clear indica
tion that the Chinese have not given up their
policies of "hostility and hegemony" against Viet
nam.
Abortion incidence increases
Washington — A survey by an international
population study group indicates that one in four
pregnancies worldwide ends in abortion, accord
ing to a report released yesterday.
The report by the Population Crisis Committee
estimated at least 40 million and perhaps as many
as 55 million legal and illegal abortions were per
formed or induced last year and said the number
appears to be growing.
"In most parts of the world, the incidence of
abortion is expected to grow as a result of wider

preference for smaller families, lack of alternative
family planning services and an increase in the
number of women of childbearing age," the
committee said.
The committee, a privately financed organiza
tion, reported a year ago that sterilization had be
come the principal method of birth control in the
world.
Cynthia Green, one of the staff members who
prepared the latest report, said there were 122
million live births last year and an unknown but
relatively small number of spontaneous abortions,
or miscarriages, which were not counted in the
panel's calculations.
The study found there has been a trend
throughout the world in recent years to liberalize
abortion laws. It predicted nations would con
tinue to rely on the procedure as a form of birth
control because no perfect contraceptives are av
ailable.
Talmadge investigation begins
Washington — The Senate Ethics Committee is
scheduled to open its first public inquiry in 12
years into the ethics of a senator today.
Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.) is accused of
five violations of Senate rules. The most serious of
the five alleges he converted campaign contribu
tions to his own use. Another alleges he over
charged the Senate on his expense vouchers.
Unless there should be a last-minute agreement
to end the investigation, it will open today with
testimony from three current employees of Tal
madge's office and one former employee.
Talmadge — who made a national name for him
self on the Senate Watergate Committee that in
vestigated President Richard Nixon — is one of the
most powerful members of the Senate.
In response to an inquiry by Talmadge's attor
neys, the committee said earlier it would drop its
investigation if Talmadge would consent to cen
sure by the Senate. Talmadge has not responded
to that invitation to settle the case.

help walking up stairs and had lapses of attention
during some top-level meetings.
That picture of the 72-year-old Soviet leader
emerged during French President Valery Ciscard
d'Estaing's recent visit here. It focused the spot
light again on Brezhnev's health, which is known
to be delicate.
"There was nothing dramatic. But it was more
the general impression he made," one source said
about Brezhnev.
Publicly, French officials went out of theirway to
give the impression that Brezhnev was taking "an
active and continuing part" in the talks, as d'tsla

ing's spokesman Pierre Hunt put it.
But there was only one face-to-face meeting dur
ing the French leader's three-day visit, and the
summit, which ended Saturday, produced no
thing major.
During the entire Moscow summit, French re
porters were kept several yards away from
Brezhnev, and some grumbled that this was to
prevent them from scrutinizing him too closely.
U.N. official seeks peace in Asia
Peking — U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim brought his campaign for peace in South
east Asia to Peking yesterday and told Chinese
leaders that unless the situation is defused quickly
it could "deteriorate further with consequences
far beyond this region."
Waldheim was referring to the stalled peace
talks between China and Vietnam after their
month-long border war, and Vietnam'scontinuing
war in Cambodia.
"It is therefore imperative that all efforts be di
rected towards finding a settlement in conformity
with the principles of the charter of the United
Nations," Waldheim said at a banquet given in his
honor at the Great Hall of the People by Foreign
Minister Huang Hua.
The search for such a solution is the reason for
Waldheim's current Asian tour. He was politely
but firmly rebuffed in Vietnam, where Prime
Minister Pham Van Dong told him Vietnam was
not interested in formal mediation.
Vietnam, meanwhile, said yesterday that Chi
na's eight-point peace proposal was a clear indica
tion that the Chinese have not given up their
policies of "hostility and hegemony" against Viet
nam.
Abortion incidence increases
Washington — A survey by an international
population study group indicates that one in four
pregnancies worldwide ends in abortion, accord
ing to a report released yesterday.
The report by the Population Crisis Committee
estimated at least 40 million and perhaps as many
as 55 million legal and illegal abortions were per
formed or induced last year and said the number
appears to be growing.
"In most parts of the world, the incidence of
abortion is expected to grow as a result of wider

preference for smaller families, lack of alternative
family planning services and an increase in the
number of women of childbearing age," the
committee said.
The committee, a privately financed organiza
tion, reported a year ago that sterilization had be
come the principal method of birth control in the
world.
Cynthia Green, one of the staff members who
prepared the latest report, said there were 122
million live births last year and an unknown but
relatively small number of spontaneous abortions,
or miscarriages, which were not counted in the
panel's calculations.
The study found there has been a trend
throughout the world in recent years to liberalize
abortion laws. It predicted nations would con
tinue to rely on the procedure as a form of birth
control because no perfect contraceptives are av
ailable.
Talmadge investigation begins
Washington — The Senate Ethics Committee is
scheduled to open its first public inquiry in 12
years into the ethics of a senator today.
Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.) is accused of
five violations of Senate rules. The most serious of
the five alleges he converted campaign contribu
tions to his own use. Another alleges he over
charged the Senate on his expense vouchers.
Unless there should be a last-minute agreement
to end the investigation, it will open today with
testimony from three current employees of Tal
madge's office and one former employee.
Talmadge — who made a national name for him
self on the Senate Watergate Committee that in
vestigated President Richard Nixon — is one of the
most powerful members of the Senate.
In response to an inquiry by Talmadge's attor
neys, the committee said earlier it would drop its
investigation if Talmadge would consent to cen
sure by the Senate. Talmadge has not responded
to that invitation to settle the case.

British mothers favor Tories
London — Young British mothers say they do not
like Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher's
upper middle-class accent and aggressive manner,
but they like the Labor Party's socialist policies
even less, according to an opinion poll published
yesterday.
The poll indicated mothers under the age of 45
— a group whose support some analysts consider
vital to victory — will vote for the Conservatives by
a 4-percentage-point margin over Labor in na
tional elections for a new Parliament May J.
The mothers, who account for 7 million of Bri
tain's 40 million registered voters, favored Labor
by a margin of 55 percent to 45 percent in the last
nationwide balloting five years ago.
A Conservative victory would make Thatcher
Britain's first woman prime minister, yet the
women polled by the Marplan organization
ranked herthird in fhe personal popularity contest
behind Labor Prime Minister lames Callaghan and
David Steel, leader of the Liberals, the third
strongest party.
Marplan said most of the 1017 women it ques
tioned in 51 of the 615 electoral districts listed
union pay demands as the primary cause for a
doubling of consumer prices during the past five
years of Labor Party rule.
Most of the women also said they believe that
Tory plans to cut taxes and scrap burdensome
state controls will bring a better life for their chil
dren, the poll reported.
