# Monitoring SALT II limits still a problem
## 
### Robert Reed 
In what was more an explanat
ory lecture than a political speech,
Major General J.A. Welch )r., an
Air Force expert on Strategic Arms
Limitation, spoke here Thursday
night on the details and concerns
ot safeguarding the SALT II ac
cord.
According to Welch. Assistant
Chief of Staff at the LJ.S. Air Force
Studies and Analysis Headquar
ters, though verification ot Soviet
compliance with the SALT accord
is a major consideration, much
more is involved in determining
the value of the treaty.
"All verification requires is
cooperation. That's different than
saying it requires trust," said
Welch.
"There's a large spread bet

ween what's authorized and
what's worrisome, and to the ex
tent that you have that large
spread you can begin to be more
tolerant of precision with regard
to compliance."
Three considerations are in
volved here, according to Welch.
First, does Soviet noncompliance,
within the provisions ot the ac
cord, make a significant differ
enced Second, does the ambiguity
in the treaty enable the United
States to "do some things it needs
to do" and whether the trade-off
is worth it? Third, are there
American hedges against non
compliance?
Welch said the two rules in
volved in making the accord were,
"don't change and don't inter
fere."

"Don't change the way you're
doing things. And don't interfere
with the way I've been looking at
you," said Welch, explaining that
both sides went into the talks
ready to make an accord based on
the knowledge they had previ
ously gathered about each other
through reconnaissance.
In the "launcher-surrogate
construct" which is used in verify
ing the provisions of the accord,
Welch said, launchers are
counted and not missiles.
Because of this, the general
said, problems of verifiability
might be expected because of
Soviet mobile units, whose
launch sites are unstationary and
easily concealed. However,
Welch explained this problem
might be solved by counting these

units at their production sites.
"The active verification of com
pliance with an arms control tre
aty is a fairly complicated matter,"
Welch said.
Two major asymmetries bet
ween the Soviet Union and the
United States presented prob
lems during the formulation of
SALT agreements, Welch said.
One was that with the United
States being an "open" country,
the Soviets could tell what was
happening here just by reading
the newspapers, while the Soviet
Union, being a "closed" country,
disclosed little through public
sources.
The other asymmetry involved
political theory as to the purpose
of a treaty. The Soviets came into
the treaty wanting only to ratify
the past, Welch said, while the
United States wanted to set
guidelines for the future.
Thus, concluded Welch, "Ver
ification is then a peculiarly
American problem."
Fielding questions from the au
dience after the lecture, Welch
said that ending construction of
strategic nuclear arms would en
danger the continuance of the
free world because of the Com
munist idea of "global
hegemony."
"The world would be far better
off if both sides rebased their
ICBM's (intercontinental ballistic
missiles) into a more protective
mode," Welch said.
"The formal language in the

treaty has equal limits on both
sides," he said, adding that, "As a
de facto matter, the implementa
tion of those limits over the finite
duration of the treaty . . . doesn't
allot equal forces on each side,
even though there are equal
rights on both sides."
Welch said that though the Un
ited States once led the Soviets in
the arms race, the Soviets have
caught up and are now passing us.
"From the point of view of
sheer explosive power, they will
have more. From the point of view
of numbers of warheads, we will
have more for awhile â€” but that
goes away."
"The growth of Soviet ICBM's
creates an enormous instability in
the arms situation, and that's re
ally the cause of the problem."
