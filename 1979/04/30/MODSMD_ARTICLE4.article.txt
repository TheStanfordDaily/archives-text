# Ginzburg to join exiled Solzhenitsyn in Vermont
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Newly treed
Soviet dissident Alexander Ginzburg
said yesterday that he and his family
will go to live with exiled Soviet
novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn at
the writer's secluded 51-acre estate
in the hills of southern Vermont.
The move, confirmed by Sol
zhenitsyn's secretary, will reunite
two close associates who have been
prominent leaders of the Soviet dis
sident movement. Solzhenitsyn, a
Nobel laureate, has been in exile
himself since 1974.
An interpreter translating for
Ginzburg during a 70-mipute inter
view with The Associated Press said
the dissident would travel to Ver
mont tomorrow, and that Solzhenit
syn had invited Ginzburg and his
family to "live there as if they were
coming home."
"I am a little tired of seeing four
walls after prison — and now this
room," Ginzburg said laughingly.
He was referring to his accommo
dations on the i7th floor of the Un
ited Nations Plaza Hotel, where he
has stayed since being flown to New
York on Friday in an exchange of five
Soviet dissidents for two Soviet spies
convicted here.
Two of the other dissidents, Mark
Dymshits and Eduard Kuznetsov,
were attending a rally on behalf of
Soviet lewry before flying to Israel,
where they will make their homes.
"How many times I said the words
— 'Nextyearin lerusalem' — nowit's
not next year but the next day. To
morrow at last I will be in Jerusalem,"
Soviet dissident Kuznetsov told
about 75,000 supporters yesterday.
"Your determination and effort
saved my life," Kuznetsov told the
thousands jammed into the Dag
Hamarskjold Plaza area of the United
Nations to celebrate "Solidarity Sun

day"and welcome two of five dissi
dents released from Soviet prison
camps Friday.
The gathering, sponsored by the
Greater New York Conference on
Soviet )ewry, is held annually to
focus attention on the plight of
Soviet Jews.
Georgi Vins, a Baptist pastor, at
tended morning church services in
Washington with President Jimmy
Carter.
The fifth dissident, Valentin Moroz
of the Ukraine, was back here after
attending a rally in his honor in
Philadelphia late Saturday.
Ginzburg, whose latest trial last
summer drew international atten
tion, is the most celebrated of the
freed dissidents. His conviction of
"anti-Soviet agitation and prop
aganda" was connected with his
work monitoring human rights pro
visions in the Helsinki accords.
The leader of the Moscow group
that monitored the accord, Yuri Or
lov, is in prison in the Soviet Union.
Ginzburg, 42, who has done three
separate stints in Soviet prison
camps, was in an expansive mood as
he sat overlooking Manhattan's
skyline and talked about past strug
gles in the Soviet Union and a still
uncharted future here.
He talked at length and in detail
about his prison life, gesturing often,
pointing, even drawing a picture of
his work place at a Soviet prison
camp. He used two packs of cigaret
tes to illustrate the approximate size
of the piece of tish he was fed each
morning.
Talk about his prison experience
did not seem to dampen his spirits,
though he said he, like other prison
ers, began each day by dumping his
excretions from a bucket kept in his
cell. After breakfast, he said, he

spent eight hours polishing glass for
chandeliers.
He said he was not allowed to read
anything written outside the Soviet
Union or anything containing religi
ous references.
What kept him going?
"Faith," he said.
Ginzburg practices the Russian Or
thodox faith, but has taken the
Jewish family name of his mother as a
protest against Soviet anti-Semitism.
As he did Saturday, he said that
despite the harshness of his impris
onment, he would have chosen to
stay in the Soviet Union if it were
possible.
"What can I say? It's my country. I
love my country regardless of its
government."
The invitation to live in Vermont,
he said, was extended during a tele
phone conversation Saturday with
Solzhenitsyn's wife.
He said he would go there tomor
row and stay "indefinitely" until he
decides what to do.
Ginzburg expressed confidence
that the human rights movement in
the Soviet Union would continue to
grow, saying: "I can see this even by
looking at it now at the constantly
new faces and new names . . . young
people who join forces.
"I hope," he continued, "I will live
long enough to see the time when
the human rights movement in the
Soviet Union will no longer be
necessary."
Then, he said, he would be free to
express himself completely, "to
vvrite about my favorite subject,
which is ballet."
"As yet it is difficult," he said. "It is
very difficult to write about ballet
when friends all around you are
being put into prison here and there
and everywhere."

"Your determination and effort
saved my life," Kuznetsov told the
thousands jammed into the Dag
Hamarskjold Plaza area of the United
Nations to celebrate "Solidarity Sun

day"and welcome two of five dissi
dents released from Soviet prison
camps Friday.
The gathering, sponsored by the
Greater New York Conference on
Soviet )ewry, is held annually to
focus attention on the plight of
Soviet Jews.

Carter.
The fifth dissident, Valentin Moroz
of the Ukraine, was back here after
attending a rally in his honor in
Philadelphia late Saturday.
Ginzburg, whose latest trial last
summer drew international atten
tion, is the most celebrated of the
freed dissidents. His conviction of
"anti-Soviet agitation and prop
aganda" was connected with his
work monitoring human rights pro
visions in the Helsinki accords.
The leader of the Moscow group
that monitored the accord, Yuri Or
lov, is in prison in the Soviet Union.
Ginzburg, 42, who has done three
separate stints in Soviet prison
camps, was in an expansive mood as
he sat overlooking Manhattan's
skyline and talked about past strug
gles in the Soviet Union and a still
uncharted future here.
He talked at length and in detail
about his prison life, gesturing often,
pointing, even drawing a picture of
his work place at a Soviet prison
camp. He used two packs of cigaret
tes to illustrate the approximate size
of the piece of tish he was fed each
morning.
Talk about his prison experience
did not seem to dampen his spirits,
though he said he, like other prison
ers, began each day by dumping his
excretions from a bucket kept in his
cell. After breakfast, he said, he

spent eight hours polishing glass for
chandeliers.
He said he was not allowed to read
anything written outside the Soviet
Union or anything containing religi
ous references.
What kept him going?
"Faith," he said.
Ginzburg practices the Russian Or
thodox faith, but has taken the
Jewish family name of his mother as a
protest against Soviet anti-Semitism.
As he did Saturday, he said that
despite the harshness of his impris
onment, he would have chosen to
stay in the Soviet Union if it were
possible.
"What can I say? It's my country. I
love my country regardless of its
government."
The invitation to live in Vermont,
he said, was extended during a tele
phone conversation Saturday with
Solzhenitsyn's wife.
He said he would go there tomor
row and stay "indefinitely" until he
decides what to do.
Ginzburg expressed confidence
that the human rights movement in
the Soviet Union would continue to
grow, saying: "I can see this even by
looking at it now at the constantly
new faces and new names . . . young
people who join forces.
"I hope," he continued, "I will live
long enough to see the time when
the human rights movement in the
Soviet Union will no longer be
necessary."
Then, he said, he would be free to
express himself completely, "to
vvrite about my favorite subject,
which is ballet."
"As yet it is difficult," he said. "It is
very difficult to write about ballet
when friends all around you are
being put into prison here and there
and everywhere."
New York (AP) — Newly treed
Soviet dissident Alexander Ginzburg
said yesterday that he and his family
will go to live with exiled Soviet
novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn at
the writer's secluded 51-acre estate
in the hills of southern Vermont.
The move, confirmed by Sol
zhenitsyn's secretary, will reunite
two close associates who have been
prominent leaders of the Soviet dis
sident movement. Solzhenitsyn, a
Nobel laureate, has been in exile
himself since 1974.
An interpreter translating for
Ginzburg during a 70-mipute inter
view with The Associated Press said
the dissident would travel to Ver
mont tomorrow, and that Solzhenit
syn had invited Ginzburg and his
family to "live there as if they were
coming home."
"I am a little tired of seeing four
walls after prison — and now this
room," Ginzburg said laughingly.
He was referring to his accommo
dations on the i7th floor of the Un
ited Nations Plaza Hotel, where he
has stayed since being flown to New
York on Friday in an exchange of five
Soviet dissidents for two Soviet spies
convicted here.
Two of the other dissidents, Mark
Dymshits and Eduard Kuznetsov,
were attending a rally on behalf of
Soviet lewry before flying to Israel,
where they will make their homes.
"How many times I said the words
— 'Nextyearin lerusalem' — nowit's
not next year but the next day. To
morrow at last I will be in Jerusalem,"
