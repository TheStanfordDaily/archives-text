# South African holdings protested
## College demand divestment 
### Gayle Mayers 
An increasing number of students
at college campuses across the coun
try are demanding that universities
divest themselves of their holdings in
U.S. corporations doing business in
South Africa.
About 1000 students rallied at Har
vard University Friday demanding di
vestment of Harvard's stockholdings
involving corporations doing busi
ness in South Africa, according to
Joseph Schwartz of Harvard's Coali

lion tor Awareness and Action (CAA).
Schwartz, a graduate teaching fel
low in government said that approx
imately 60 percent of the student
body boycotted class and 20 faculty
members and 20 teaching fellows
canceled classes in support of the
CAA, a political coalition of Third
World and other student groups
which organized the rally.
The CAA was also rallying support
for the Afro-American Studies De
partment which Schwartz said has
been understaffed and underfi
nanced since its creation 10 years
ago.
Schwartz said nearly half the stu
dent body has signed a petition in
support of divestment and the Afro-
American studies program.
Approximately 150 faculty mem
bers have also signed a divestment
petition and protested President
Derek Bok's letter in defense of the
university's investment policy, he
added.
On March 25, Bok issued an open
letterwhich stated that the university
should avoid taking a moral position
in the outside world and should re
main neutral, Schwartz said.
Bok issued another letteron April 7
which made a point-by-point attempt
to refute the case for divestment and
stated that even if universities should
divest it is not clear that divestment
would put pressure on the corpora
tions.
Schwartz, challenging Bok's
statements, said, "Divestment by a
school as prestigious as Harvard

would certainly put pressure on cor
porations and certainly affect the na
tional debate on United States gov
ernment policy and corporate policy
towards South Africa."
Approximately one quarter of Har
vard's $350 million investment
portfolio is invested in firms with
South African connections. Pressure
trorn within the university thus far
has resulted in the withdrawal of $20
million from Morgan Guarantee
which refused to make a statement
on its business practices in South Af
rica, Schwartz said.
Last week, striking students at
Amherst College, Mass. included di
vestment in a set of five demands
they presented to the university ad
ministration, according to Michael
Pratt of Amherst's South Africa Sup
port Committee (SASQ.
Pratt said the Board of Trustees has
refused to alter its policy with regard
to South African investments which
amount to approximately $22.5 mill
ion.
"We want the Board of Trustees to
make a public commitment to the
goal of corporate withdrawal and to
work within the corporation towards
that goal for a limit of two years. The
university should then move towards
divestment if corporate withdrawal
has not been successful," Pratt said.
Pratt said SASC is demanding im
mediate withdrawal from four corpo
rations which are currently in viola
tion of the Board of Trustees own
investment policy.
Pratt said the BoarcTof Trustees has
outlined certain conditions corpora
tions must compfy with in their deal
ings in South Africa for Amherst to
hold their stock.
The Associated Students of UC-
Berkeley closed its bank account
with Wells Fargo in January and has
begun similaraction at Union Bank in
protest of their association with
South Africa, according to Laura Ac
cinelli of the ASUC Senate. Accinelli
said there is campus-wide support
for the withdrawals which total ap
proximately $350,000.
According to the Investment Re
sponsibility Research Center (IRRC),
a Washington based non-profit or

ganization which investigates stoc
kholder issues, there are at least 12
cases where schools have divested
some or all of their stock totalling
less than $30 million.
David Liff, spokesman for the
IRRC, said the $30 million divestment
figure includes sales made by Col
umbia, Michigan State, the Univer
sity of Wisconsin, Amherst and Vas
sar College.
An IRCC survey made last summer
revealed that the 66 universities
which responded to a questionnaire
have approximately $2.19 billion in
vested in businesses with South Afri
can connections. Approximately
two-thirds of these schools reported
some pressure to divest, Liff said.

Bok issued another letteron April 7
which made a point-by-point attempt
to refute the case for divestment and
stated that even if universities should
divest it is not clear that divestment
would put pressure on the corpora
tions.
Schwartz, challenging Bok's
statements, said, "Divestment by a
school as prestigious as Harvard

would certainly put pressure on cor
porations and certainly affect the na
tional debate on United States gov
ernment policy and corporate policy
towards South Africa."
Approximately one quarter of Har
vard's $350 million investment
portfolio is invested in firms with
South African connections. Pressure
trorn within the university thus far
has resulted in the withdrawal of $20
million from Morgan Guarantee
which refused to make a statement
on its business practices in South Af
rica, Schwartz said.
Last week, striking students at
Amherst College, Mass. included di
vestment in a set of five demands
they presented to the university ad
ministration, according to Michael
Pratt of Amherst's South Africa Sup
port Committee (SASQ.
Pratt said the Board of Trustees has
refused to alter its policy with regard
to South African investments which
amount to approximately $22.5 mill
ion.
"We want the Board of Trustees to
make a public commitment to the
goal of corporate withdrawal and to
work within the corporation towards
that goal for a limit of two years. The
university should then move towards
divestment if corporate withdrawal
has not been successful," Pratt said.
Pratt said SASC is demanding im
mediate withdrawal from four corpo
rations which are currently in viola
tion of the Board of Trustees own
investment policy.
Pratt said the BoarcTof Trustees has
outlined certain conditions corpora
tions must compfy with in their deal
ings in South Africa for Amherst to
hold their stock.
The Associated Students of UC-
Berkeley closed its bank account
with Wells Fargo in January and has
begun similaraction at Union Bank in
protest of their association with
South Africa, according to Laura Ac
cinelli of the ASUC Senate. Accinelli
said there is campus-wide support
for the withdrawals which total ap
proximately $350,000.
According to the Investment Re
sponsibility Research Center (IRRC),
a Washington based non-profit or

ganization which investigates stoc
kholder issues, there are at least 12
cases where schools have divested
some or all of their stock totalling
less than $30 million.
David Liff, spokesman for the
IRRC, said the $30 million divestment
figure includes sales made by Col
umbia, Michigan State, the Univer
sity of Wisconsin, Amherst and Vas
sar College.
An IRCC survey made last summer
revealed that the 66 universities
which responded to a questionnaire
have approximately $2.19 billion in
vested in businesses with South Afri
can connections. Approximately
two-thirds of these schools reported
some pressure to divest, Liff said.
An increasing number of students
at college campuses across the coun
try are demanding that universities
divest themselves of their holdings in
U.S. corporations doing business in
South Africa.
About 1000 students rallied at Har
vard University Friday demanding di
vestment of Harvard's stockholdings
involving corporations doing busi
ness in South Africa, according to
Joseph Schwartz of Harvard's Coali

lion tor Awareness and Action (CAA).
Schwartz, a graduate teaching fel
low in government said that approx
imately 60 percent of the student
body boycotted class and 20 faculty
members and 20 teaching fellows
canceled classes in support of the
CAA, a political coalition of Third
World and other student groups
which organized the rally.
The CAA was also rallying support
for the Afro-American Studies De
partment which Schwartz said has
been understaffed and underfi
nanced since its creation 10 years
ago.
Schwartz said nearly half the stu
dent body has signed a petition in
support of divestment and the Afro-
American studies program.
Approximately 150 faculty mem
bers have also signed a divestment
petition and protested President
Derek Bok's letter in defense of the
university's investment policy, he
added.
On March 25, Bok issued an open
letterwhich stated that the university
should avoid taking a moral position
in the outside world and should re
main neutral, Schwartz said.
Bok issued another letteron April 7
which made a point-by-point attempt
to refute the case for divestment and
stated that even if universities should
divest it is not clear that divestment
would put pressure on the corpora
tions.
