# Ellsberg arrested in protest

### Emily Sachar 
ASSU Guest Professor Daniel E was among 280
anti-nuclear activists arrested yesterday lor marc hing on
the gates of a Colorado nuclear weapons plant, the As
sociated Press reported.
Some 230 Colorado protesters had trained for weeks
in a plan to blockade three entrances to the Rocky Flats
plant about If) miles northwest of Denver, the nation's
only producer of plutonium "triggers" for nuclear
weapons.
About 24 armed federal marshals and security guards
from Rockwell International greeted the protesters and
70 other dissidents at the plant's east and west gate and
at a railroad spur leading into the facility.
Ellsberg was among those arrested at the railroad
tracks — the same spot where he and 27 others were
arrested exactly a year ago yesterday, the report stated.
Though last year's 200 protesters were convicted and
given suspended sentences, officials said this year the
trespassers would be prosecuted on federal charges.
However, Laura Selznick, director of the Under
graduate Special program, through which Ellsberg's
course is being taught this spring, said yesterday's arrest
would not affect his teaching opportunities here.

"When Ellsberg was hired, the people who reviewed
him clearly saw that he was arrested last year. Part of the
reason students wanted him to teach here has to do with
the kinds of protest activities he gets himself involved
in," Selznick said.
Selznick also said that Ellsberg had taken at least one
trip to Denver to protest nuclear activities during his
brief stay here as a guest professor.
"After all, he's only supposed to be carrying a 33
percent load; he's got 66 percent of the rest of his life to
spend as he desires," Selznick said.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant Katchadou
rian was in Los Angeles last night and unavailable for
comment. Katchadourian and members of an Under
graduate Studies committee that oversees guest profes
sor appointments reviewed Ellsberg's academic creden
tials before his appointment through ASSU.
Selznick said Ellsberg would return in time to teach his
class tomorrow afternoon.
Ellsberg and the other protesters were loaded into a
blue bus from the Denver County Sheriff's Department
and taken to a makeshift booking station at the U.S.
Geological Survey headquarters in Lakewood, a Denver
suburb, where magistrates were standing by. Ellsberg
was released on bail.
