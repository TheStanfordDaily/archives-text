## Rachelle Marshall Elections undemocratic 
### 
President Jimmy Carter is
being urged by the chairman of
the Republican party and cer
tain members of Congress to
resume normal U.S. relations
, with /imbabwe-Rhodesia now
that a "freely elected" gov
ernment is about to be instal
led. But the Rhodesian elec
tions were largely a charade,
. and for the United States to
sanction them would be a clear
signal to the black people of
southern Africa that we reject
their aspirations for self
government.
Conditions under which the
elections were held made
them a parody of democratic
procedure. Members of the
Patriotic Front were excluded
from participation even
though it was their resistance
activities that forced former
Prime Minister lan Smith to
ward even a semblance of
majority rule. Rhodesian
bombs shattered refugee
camps and guerrilla-training
centers in neighboring African
countries even as voters were
brought to the polls.
For weeks before the elec
tions were held, agents of the
Smith government carried on
• an "educational campaign"
throughout the countryside
; urging people to vote. The
leading candidates, Prime
Minister-elect Bishop Abel
■' Muzorewa and Rev. Nbabaingi
,1 Si thole, maintain well-armed
J militias and these too were
' used to get out the vote.
• Muzorewa reportedly received

more than $1 million from
South Africa to finance his
campaign.
Smith claims that the voter
turnout of 65 percent is evi
dence of popular support for
the new government. But it is
evidence only of the fact that
oppression often appears to
work. Last fall the nation's only
black newspaper was shut
down because it had sup
ported the Anglo-American
plan for internationally
supervised elections in which
all factions could participate.

. . . the Rhodesian
elections were
largely a charade.

Not only is the press cen
sored in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia
but three-fourths of the coun
try lives under martial law. In
habitants can be arrested by
the military for any reason and
held indefinitely without trial.
In addition, more than half a
million black Rhodesians are
forced to live in "protected vil
lages," surrounded by barbed
wire and subject to the mercies
of a military guard.
Election observers reported
that many voters were brought
to the polls in military vehicles.
Under such conditions a large
voter turnout is no evidence of
popular support.
Free or not, the elections did
not bring majority rule to
They
were held under a constitution

drawn up and approved only
by whites, who make up 4 per
cent of the population. The
constitution guarantees veto
power for whites in the new
parliament as well as white
control of the military,
judiciary and public service for
at least 10 years. It protects
existing white ownership of
more than half of the most
productive farm land. A New
York Times correspondent cal
led these provisions "perhaps
the most elaborate instru
ments for defending the status
quo ever written into the con
stitution of an African nation."
Unfortunately there is
bound to be continued vio
lence in the country whether
or not the United States recog
nizes the new government. It
we do grant recognition, the
Rhodesian government,
strengthened by U.S. trade and
support, would be able to re
taliate against the resistance
movement with greater vigor
than before.
In that case the inevitable
downfall of the white
dominated regime would only
be prolonged. American re
fusal of recognition, on the
other hand, might prevent an
escalation of the violence and
would enable us as a nation to
say that an oppressive, minor
ity government does not be
come a democracy simply by
going through the motions of
an election.
