## True 'national service' necessary 
### 
Conscription is slavery.
It is not, of course, identical to the chat
tel slavery of the American antebellum
South: draftees cannot be bought and
sold and their tenure of servitude is (rela
tively) limited.
Nevertheless, conscription is obviously
involuntary servitude, compulsory forced
labor.
We should not be fooled by the claim
that conscription is actually voluntary be
cause it is imposed upon us by representa
tives whom we have chosen. That claim is
founded on a semantic confusion: the
"we" who have chosen our rulers and the
"we" who will be drafted are not the same
people.
The most basic of human rights is the
right to use one's labor in pursuit of one's
own ends; the defining c haracteristic of a
slave is that he is forced to labor to serve
another's ends. Compulsory national
service—be it military or civilian—violates
this right.
However, in opposing the movement to
restore conscription, it is not enough to
emphasize that the draft violates indi
vidual rights: people such as Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and President
)immy Carter are not greatly moved by a
concern for human rights. We must also
consider the central arguments of the
proponents of conscription.
A key argument of supporters of the
draft is the claim that the all-volunteer
force has "failed." Even on its own
grounds, such a claim is open to question:
while there has been a shortfall in recruit
ment, re-enlistment rates have actually ex
ceeded expectations.
More important, one must realize that
;the all-volunteer force is a "failure" only if
one accepts as an unquestioned premise
the necessity of extensive American milit

ary intervention abroad: no serious ob
server believes that the all-volunteer force
is inadequate for the defense of the United
States alone.
Opposition to the draft must therefore
include a questioning of American foreign
policy in general. We must not be deterred
by those who decry any such questionings
as "isolationism": the true isolationists are
those who would isolate America by
further restricting trade and immigration
into this country; such persons are often
the same people who support the draft
and call for greater military intervention
abroad.

. . . requisite service does
not consist of emptying
bedpans or replacing ag
ricultural laborers in the
fields. . .

The central underlying concern of many
proponents of conscription, both liberals
and conservatives, is a belief that America
can survive only if Americans have a wil
lingness to serve their nation. That belief is
true, but in a rather different way than the
supporters of the draft believe.
A democratic republic is a fragile type of
polity. It can endure only through the con
stant concern, diligence and service of its
citizens. But the requisite service does not
consist of emptying bedpans or replacing
agricultural laborers in the fields: it is far
more complex and, in some ways, more
arduous. It consists of a constant concern,
interest and activity devoted to the estab
lishing, preserving and invigorating of free
institutions and to the preserving and
safeguarding of our liberties.

It is absurd to believe that such service
to one's nation can be mandated by law:
vigorous participation in the duties of citi
zenship cannot be coerced but can only be
the result of a free and voluntary choice.
Proponents of compulsory "national
service" totally fail to comprehend what
national service really means. In their
mechanical and simplistic concept of serv
ing one's nation, they display a complete
ignorance of the dynamics of a free soci
ety.
I he civic culture which binds together a
tree nation, the republican virtue which is
necessary to the survival of democratic
government, resides only in a fractious
people jealous of their liberties and eter
nally hostile to the aggrandizement of
power. Very often, loyalty to one's country
requires opposition to one's government.
Universal compulsory national service
would instill in young Americans a sense
of obedience, a willingness to accept au
thority and a belief in our rulers' right to
dictate our actions. Indeed, some propo
nents of the draft have been rather explicit
in admitting their desire to instill such a
spirit of obedience in the youth of
America.
In reality, it is not the spirit of obedience
hut the spirit of opposition which must be
awakened in the American people.
This week there will be a number of ac
tivities here devoted to stimulating discus
sion of American foreign and military pol
icy, culminating Saturday in a debate on
the draft with McCloskey. By being active
and critical participants in the activities of
Peace Week, members of the community
can demonstrate that they understand
what true national service is all about.
