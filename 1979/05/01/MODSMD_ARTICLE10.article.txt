Frat image upheld
Everywhere I look these
days, I see flak about frats. Let
ters to the editor complaining
about the inequities of rush.
Frustrated women complain
ingabout not getting invited to
meat markets (sometimes cal
led Firesides). Property dam
age and flying pizzas caused by
wild frat men. Decadent frat
men building jacuzzis. Frat
men sabotaging nuclear power
plants.
In an effort to clear up some
of these misconceptions, I will
define what exactly a frat man
is, using myself as a prime
example.
Now, I know that as a frater
nity member I must act snobby

and exclusive, never socializ
ing with non-frat people.
That's why I have to sneak
over to visit friends from my
freshman dorm disguised as a
COP candidate. I don't mind,
really, but the flyers I have to
carry cost $15 to print.
I pound a keg of beer every
night. I force myself to read
Gentleman's Quarterly
magazine. I tell everyone I
drive a Porsche 928, even
though it's really a Schwinn
10-speed. I brag about my sex
life, although the last time I saw
the female form was when the
Storey shower window was left
open.
I never go to class, preferring
to "bag some rays" on the sun

deck, smothered in suntan lo
tion, all day. At night I donate
skin grafts to American In
dians. On weekends I go to
snobby, exclusive frat parties
with 4000 walk-on guests who
help drink 12 kegs and dance
to a live band. Free.
I tell everyone I was high
school quarterback, although
in reality I was third-string
miler on the high school track
team.
I would never dream of
cracking my cool, studly image
by dressing up like a Dolly and
doing a dance routine at a
football game half-time.
So, you see, being a frater
nity man requires some sac
rifices. And, of course, we all fit
the stereotype.

An apology
In a recent poster urging a
"No" vote on the Daily fee as
sessment, the Chaparral
printed a John Littleboy car
toon without his permission
and with substituted captions.
The Chaparral apologizes to
Littleboy. We were bad.

Editor's note: Littleboy re
quested the preceding state
ment from the Chaparral fol
lowing the organization's un
authorized use of the drawings
from one of his copyrighted
comic strips. This usage consti
tuted a violation of copyright
laws presently in force.
Stilwell respected
In response to the article in
the April 17 Daily concerning
the investigation of Associate
Anatomy Professor Donald
Stilwell's professional con
duct, I would like to rectify two
distorted assertions.
Dr. Stilwell has helped me
decipher what I once consi

dered the inextricably intricate
and often frustrating process
of applying to medical schools;
together we have outlined my
academic needs, aspirations,
plans of action and alterna
tives. Through him I extracted
from the application proce
dure every advantage available
to me.
What role in my educational
development I feel he plays or
what title I bestow on him is
not and should not be re
stricted by the University or by
Stilwell himself.Theissuetobe
reckoned with concerns Stil
well's representation of him
self to students. He simply
makes himself available to stu
dents here and from outlying
universities to discuss their in
terests in health-care profes
sions.
He carefully avoids the term,
"adviser," and all its
synonyms, and requests he be
introduced to any audience, as
he was in January, by his
academic title and name only.
The University cannot expect
him to go beyond what he is
contracted to do and try to con
trol (other) students' use of
terms to describe his place in
the (premedical) student
milieu.
No student who visits Stil
well's office must "promise" to
consult with him three times a
quarter. A promise implies a
contract, and no such bond
exists between Stilwell and the
students who visit him. He re
quests that students do this to
ensure meaningful personal
communication, but interac
tion with him and with others
in the student forum he creates
is completely voluntary.
In plain words, the man
helps people get into medical
schools. I both respect him and
am grateful to him. As for too
many of the Academic Infor
mation Center's premed ad
visers whose secretaries prac
tice signing PTR's, they aren't
&ven in his class.
