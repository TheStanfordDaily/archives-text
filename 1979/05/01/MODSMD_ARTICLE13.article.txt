For most Americans, it's a
land of snow and ice. Their
knowledge of the continent
they live on ends at the 49th
parallel; beyond the border
lies an unknown wilderness,
the home of hockey players
and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
The tourist who has made it
as far north as Niagara Falls,
N.Y. peers through the mist
and envisions scenes of es
kimos hunting for walrus and
fur traders negotiating some
treacherous river leading to
the North West Passage.
For decades Canada was ig
nored as a nation of no con
sequence. When we were spo
ken of, it was never in very flat
tering terms. Nowadays Cana
dians are portrayed as friendly,
competent but boring types.
Americans tend to assume that a
Canadian with any ambition or
imagination will move to the
States as soon as he is physi
cally able to do so. As Neil
Young stated, "The great
Canadian dream is to go
south."
Living in the shadow of the

United States causes problems
for Canada. "It's like sharing a
bed with an elephant," Pierre
Trudeau once remarked. It is
difficult to maintain any kind of
cultural unity when a nation of
23 million people is constantly
bombarded by television prog
ramming, newspapers and
magazines from a neighboring
country ten times its popula
tion.
Most Americans are unaware
of the existence of Canadian
literature, art and music, al
though they are quite willing to
adopt such prominent Cana
dians as Joni Mitchell, Marshall
McLuhan and )ohn Kenneth
Galbraith as "American
heroes."
During his visit to Canada,
President John Kennedy de
clared: "Geography has made
us neighbors, and history has
made us friends." The border
that separates our two coun
tries is often referred to as "the
longest unguarded border in
the world."
However, the slate is not as
clean as Kennedy made it out
to be, and many Canadians
today believe that the original
idea of a mutually beneficial re
lationship between Canada
and the United States has been
replaced by domination and
exploitation.
My country came into being
in 1867 with the British North
America Act. The War of 1812
and the Fenian Raids had
taught Canada to be wary of
the intentions of the souther
ners, and our first prime minis
ter, Sir John Mac Donald, firmly
believed that only through
confederation could United
States annexation of Canada be
prevented.

However, the United States
administration continued the
campaign begun by the Radical
Republicans to bring Canada
"within the magic circle of the
American Union." In 1903,
then-President Teddy
Roosevelt rammed the Alaska
Panhandle decision down our
throats, and in 1909 the Ameri
can explorer Robert Peary had
the gall to lay claim to the
North Pole and "all adjacent
lands," which included most of
the Canadian Arctic ar
chipelago, on the behalf of the
United States.

It's like sharing a
bed with an
elephant/ Pierre
Trudeau once
remarked.

It'sa standing joke in Canada
that the biggest decisions con
cerning the country's future
aren't made in Toronto or Ot
tawa, but rather on Wall Street.
With 60 percent of all industry
controlled directly or indirectly
by American companies, the
joke probably is not all that far
from the truth.
We produce and export raw
materials and then buy back
manufactured goods at in
flated prices. Perhaps the best
example of a sell-out to the
Americans is the James Bay
Hydropower Project in
Ouebec. Funded largely by
American interests, the project
resulted in the flooding of 4000
square miles of land, causing

irreparable damage to the en
vironment and forcing the dis
location of the native Indian
population.
Despite all this, we are the
kind of ally Americans could
use more of; there never has
been a war of Canadian origin.
Most Americans will die
without ever having headed
north of the 49th parallel, and
yet for many Canada sym
bolizes a place of. refuge, an
oasis of stability during
times of political and social up
heaval in this country. For
blacks during the slave trade
and draft-dodgers during the
Vietnam War it was a place of
freedom. Chief )oseph of the
Nez Perce Indians attempted
to lead his people across the
border in order to escapeper
secution. Canada is the last
frontier, a nation with huge
tracts of land still unmapped
and unexplored.
But the apearance of an idyl
lic country of unlimited re
sources is deceiving. The past
has not been as smooth as
Americans make it out to be.
We have learned our lessons
the hard way. Now, Canadians
are becoming less willing to
compromise, and for the first
time we wield a big stick: the
natural resources that we have
and that you need. We are not
anti-Americans or isolationists.
We guard what we have jeal
ously, and we realize that if we
are to survive we must break
out of our dependency on the
United States. There's an awful
lot at stake â€” our land, our
people, our future.
