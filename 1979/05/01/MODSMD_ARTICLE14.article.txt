## Frats can't be stereotyped 
### 
The best way to refute Susan Warnock's col
umn blasting fraternities [Daily, April 27) would
probably be to let it stand unanswered — it's so
stupidly written. But since many people at Stan
ford know nothing about the fraternities except
what they read in the Daily, I think it deserves a
response.
First, Warnock establishes her credibility for
commentingon fraternity rush. Shewrites: "Be
ing female and never having attended a frater
nity rush party I figure I have a pretty unbiased
outlook on the entire 'farce.'" If this logic holds,
I should start giving lectures on the Middle East,
since I've never been there and know little
about the area.
Warnock could try to pass off her column as
simply an attempt to be funny, but she actually
uses her trite stereotypes to support an anti
fraternity statement. It's understandable that a
person who admits to having no knowledge of a
topic must rely on such trite stereotypes to sup
port her argument. Understandable — but
wrong.
I suppose everyone in the Italian House
makes pizza and drinks wine all day, and that
residents of the German House are easy to spot
goose-stepping to class in the morning. I
wouldn't expect anyone here to believe that
about our theme houses, yet Warnock tries to
warn "innocent freshperson rushees" with simi
larly knee-jerk descriptions. One house is called
a "short-cropped bunch of conservatives,"
another is made up of nerds who watch TV,
another is labelled a house for beach boys.
It seems fraternities can't win either way with
Warnock: they either are too nerd-like, too wild
or too conservative for her. Perhaps she could
print up an outline of the proper way to behave,
the proper balance of activities, how much to
study, how much to party, what clothes to wear,

etc. The Gospel According to Warnock, as it
were. Every student should have one.
Seriously, Warnock's article does reflect
some students' sentiments. This resentment
toward fraternities, I think is based on a feeling
that fraternity people feel somehow superior to
or just don't like those who aren't part of the
Creek system. This isn't true. And I know of no
one who thinks that they needed to join a frater
nity house to "estabish themself as an entity,"as
Warnock writes.Still, there is a vicious circle ef
fect: fraternity attitudes towards the rest of the
campus are not likely to be 100 percent positive
if we're continually being portrayed as drunken
hoodlums.
Warnock neglected to mention that fraternity
members are very active in many campus or
ganizations and that we might be involved in
more community service projects than any
other Stanford student group. We haven't been
keeping track, but maybe we should if people
continually expect us to justify our existence. If a
University activity requires a lot of volunteers,
chances are they'll think of the fraternity system
first.
The worst thing people have said about the
Stanford fraternity system and the Greek system
in general is that they can be narrow-minded and
intolerant. Warnock's article is both.
Obviously, I'm very pro-fraternity, but I'll
concede that it would be valuable to have intel
ligent views expressed citing the advantages of
other living options to freshmen. Warnock
doesn't do this. She distorts the truth, clouds
the issue, and does a disservice to those who'd
like to know the truth.
