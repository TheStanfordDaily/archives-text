## Brown attacks nukes 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry
Brown said yesterday that the
real question on nuclear power
"is whether this society is ma
ture enough to take measures
that will save lives in this and
future generations."
Brown, appearing as a guest
on the Mike Douglas show,
said, "President Carter should
abandon his plan to put more
nuclear reactors on line."
Brown said, "We have a re
sponsibility to unborn genera
tions and societies. In using
nuclear energy we are dealing
with a radiation risk, a prolifer
ation to nuclear weapons,
sabotage and radioactive waste
by the tons that last hundreds

of thousands of years."
Brown said that alternative
energy sources should be de
veloped, including geothermal
power, synthetic fuel from
coal, solar energy and the use
of waste heat.
Brown was questioned by
Douglas and co-host Mike Far
rell, former star of the MASH
television series, on his recent
trip to Africa, his presidential
ambitions, inflation and his re
lationship with rock singer
Linda Ronstadt.
Asked if he would marry Ms.
Ronstadt, Brown replied; "I
don't answer that. I'm entitled
to some privacy — not very
much — but some."
