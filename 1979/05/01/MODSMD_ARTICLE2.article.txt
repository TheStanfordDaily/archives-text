# Noyes defends 'Progressive' position, urges more discussion
## Prof attacks secrecy on H-bomb issue 
### Brad Crystal 
Last March, in a case which many
observers believe will have wide
spread impact on First Amendment
rights, a federal court issued an in
junction barring The Progressive, a
left-wing Wisconsin-based
magazine, from publishing an article
on the inner workings of the hydro
gen bomb.
The injunction was only the sec
ond time a federal court had been
asked by the government to grant
prior restraint solely on the grounds
of national security. The first was the
Pentagon Papers case in 1971.
Although many scientists around
the country supported the court's
ruling, including the directors of the
Federation of American Scientists,
several signed affidavits defending
The Progressive's opposition to gov
ernment secrecy.
One of the scientists to sign an af
fidavit for The Progressive was Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) Prof. Henry Pierre Noyes.
"I do not feel there is sufficient
public discussion of the issues of
nuclear and thermonuclear
weapons, and secrecy interferes with
this," said Noyes in a recent Daily
interview.
Information 'accessible'
In his affidavit, signed March 12,
Noyes stated that "information (con

cerning the basic concepts of ther
monuclear weapons) ... is readily
accessible to anyone sufficiently in
terested in acquiring it."
He concludes the affidavit by stat
ing "Government policy designed to
preserve secrecy with respect to
such matters not only is unsuccessful
but inhibits research and obstructs
the advancement of scientific know
ledge."
Noyes, who told the Daily it is im
possible to reconcile the First
Amendment with the possession of
nuclear weapons by the federal gov
ernment, nonetheless says he would
not necessarily have supported the
contents of the Progressive article
had he been given clearance to read
it."I can't sign a blank check since I
haven't seen the article," he said.
Noyes worked as a consultant on
an H-bomb project in 1952 and was
group leader of General Research at
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory from
1955 to 1962.
He did not receive government
security clearance to read the Prog
ressive article because he has "been
associated with various radical
groups," Noyes said.
"Any security officer would be de
relict in duty in clearing me with the
current attitude of the government. I
don't think from their point of view I
should be cleared because I do take

independent views."
Independent views
One such independent view is
Noyes' belief that "technological
society is basically unstable unless
you decentralize power and
everyone on the planet has roughly
equal access to the economic pro
duct of the planet and equal control
over political power."
Noyes said he believes this "equal
access" concept should also apply to
scientific information. "I think that if
one understands the technological
process, the scientific process and
the philosophical process by which
scientific knowledge is created then
one is better able to think about pol
icy issues about how technology
should be supported."
Suppression of nuclear weapons
information thus limits an individu
al's ability to make responsible deci
sions, he said.
"Both military and diplomatic
people want to decide things on their
own terms," said Noyes. He added
that the government's system of sec
urity is an "extremely pervasive"
form of political repression.
But are certain forms of security
necessary for the preservation of
peace? Noyes cited an example
where worldwide security would be
jeopardized by public awareness.
"I'm not in favor of publishing de

tailed designs of warheads on mis
siles. That could have an unstabiliz
ing effect on the balance of terror
because it might give one side an
idea that it had a critical advantage by
making a technological break
through that would allow it to make a
first strike."
Understanding necessary
Nevertheless, Noyes stresses the
necessity of public understanding of
the scientific concepts underlying
nuclear weapons as stated in his af
fidavit .
"The more public debate, the
more realization that these things are
not mysteries, they're not black
magic, they're not arcane, they're
something that anybody who is wil
ling to make the effort can under
stand.
"That's why as a professor at a uni
versity I feel that part of my job is to
make it clear that when knowledge
is made esoteric it is very destructive
to any democratic control of the soc
iety."
As for the specter raised by many
opposing the publication of the Prog
ressive article of an Idi Amin-like dic
tator using the article as a recipe to
develop thermonuclear weaponry
Noyes said that developing such de
vices requires a "fair amount of
technical sophistication" in addition
to the fissionable materials.
Despite such requisites Noyes said
that "making a nuclear explosion
work is all too simple . . . even a
primitive design would make a reac
tor meltdown seem like an exercise
in civil defense."
However, it would be very difficult
to go from an untested primitive de
sign of a nuclear weapon to an un
tested H-bomb, he said.
