## Poe's spirit pervades 'Picnic' 
### 
1 Picnic at Hanging Rock, an exceptional Austra
lian film directed by Peter Weir, creates a genre
•all its own: the mood movie. It is a film which
gets its effects through a skillful creation of at
mosphere. The end product is a dream-like (and
often nightmarish) study of adolescence and
sexual repression.
Picnic recounts the true story of a group of
schoolgirls who, on Valentine's Day, 1900, dis
appeared without a trace on Hanging Rock. The
story is so gripping that, at the end when it
becomes clear that the filmmakers do not plan
to fabricate an ending for the mystery, the reac
tion may be one of disappointment (one audi
ence member sitting by me had to be shushed
by his companions when he started to say
loudly, "this sucks . . . they're not going to tell
how it ends").
Clearly, no one knows what happened on the
';rock But truth-in-reporting aside, the movie
ended the only way it could have ended — am
; biguously. The film's structure is such that it
i.becomes unclear what is real and what the
1 characters have merely fantasized. In Picnic at
Hanging Rock, we are given signs and clues but
no answers to this eight-decade old puzzle.
Picnic may be closer in spirit to Edgar Allan
Poe than any movie actually based on his books.
Like Poe's stories, Picnic at Hanging Rock relies
Jess on plot or characterization than on color,
• suggestion, atmosphere and mood to create an
i emotional environment that is interesting be
cause it is so unfamiliar.
J The disorientation was at least partially
achieved by making the characters into almost

mythic figures. An instructor at the girls' school
describes one of the missing girls as a Botticelli
angel. The schoolgirls on the picnic all wear
white, and they do look like angels — or like
some kind of spirit, at any rate, as they gather
incongruously at the rugged, desolate base of
the hanging rock. And the feeling of the film as a
whole is signalled at the beginning when one of
the girls, upon hearing the age of the rock, says
in mock seriousness, "it waited a million years
just for us."
The music Weir has chosen for Picnic de
serves special note. A combination of classical
and rumbling, discordant electronic music, it
perfectly captures the eerie, near-surreal feeling
that comes with seeing these strictly brought up
girls let loose in the wilderness.
The genteel Victorian environment that the
girls were brought up in is one that is presently
peaceful but one that is threatened by time and
progress. The police chief's wife can comment,
"people don't just disappear — not without
good reason," without batting an eyelash, but
people have disappeared, and whether it fits in
with her Victorian sensibilities or not, there is no
good reason for it.
The girls themselves, on the border of adoles
cence, match the outward calm but inner unrest
of their environment. Director Weir uses the
historical hanging rock disappearance to create
an allegory of change. Of the girls who disap
pear, only one comes back, and the one who
comes back . . .
. . . comes back different.
