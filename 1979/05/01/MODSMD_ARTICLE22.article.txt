## lively arts/andy moravcsik Mem Aud smothers good sounds 
### 
This has been a strange and exciting
season for Lively Arts; the normally
übiquitous string quartets have been
often replaced by a collection of
chamber orchestras, quintets and
woodwind groups. The last such string
group of the season, the Academy of St.
Martin in the Fields Octet, drew an au
dience of over 1200 (many of them En
glish), to Memorial Auditorium.
Although the group was technically
brilliant and their ensemble tight, I
walked out of the concert somewhat
disappointed. Three possible explana
tions come to mind: the auditorium,
the program and the musical style.
There is perhaps no place on campus
less suited to chamber music than
Memorial Auditorium. Whiie Din
kelspiel's wide seating area and acces
sible stage at least suggests the intimate
19th century elan of musique de
chambre, Mem Aud is indubitably
modern: music for the mass audience
in a concert hall. The spirit is anything
but intimate; the ensemble sound is
emaciated, distant, and cold; and a
constant draft keeps the audience in
wraps while the musicians grasp for
their music. A concert in Mem Aud is
like listening underwater; with such
acoustics it is almost impossible for the
audience (or for that matter the critic)
to discern the subtleties of the perfor
mance.
The program was not inspired.
Everyone came to hear thp Men
l delssohn Octet, which is indeed one of

the finest works ever written in any
musical genre, but neither of the other
pieces — the Beethoven Quintet and
the Boccherini Quintet, Op. 37, No. 7
— were inspiring. The Beethoven is, I
think, a study in aimless and unim
aginative development, never ap
proaching the brilliance of his quartets
or the early Septet. The Boccherini,
though good-natured and fun, was for
me no more than a diversion.
The Octet's style, while consistent
and stereotypically British, seemed ten
tative and introverted. They tended to
emphasize subtle detail at the expense
of the overarching line, and precision at
the expense of warmth. Certainly,
these musicians play very well to
gether, anticipating each other with
uncanny accuracy, and indeed their
technique (especially bowing) was far
above the standards set by previous
Lively Arts guests this year, but the
spirit of the group remained somewhat
detached.
This was not accidental. The group
obviously cultivates precise bowing, a
tight and cool vibrato sound (except for
the first cellist), and short and re
strained phrasing, but whether the
acoustics, the program, or the style,
something was missing.
The Boccherini Quintet is one of the
composer's most engaging works, with
an unexpectedly playful and vivacious
finale, beginning with a chuckling cello
spiccato (bouncing bow) passage in a
peasant rhythm. Only the first cellist

seemed to be in the mood — as his
slides suggested — but he sounded out
of place among his more restrained col
leagues.
But the audience had come to hear
the Mendelssohn, and all eight players
joined in. Here is a work that, it played
optimally, should immediately hit the
listener like a blast of cool air. But ex
cept for the Mem Aud draft, I felt no
thing. At times the group seemed to
engage the work, and some beautiful
passages, especially in the quiet sec
tions, resulted. But they would soon
lose the strand of the work. For exam
ple, the crescendo at the end of the
development section of the first
movement, leading back to the open
ing theme, actually became a decres
cendo during the last two measures,
leaving only anticlimax at one of the
emotional high points of Men
delssohn's score.
This was one of those exceptional
concerts, however, where the encore
tempted me to completely reverse my
judgment. They played the Scherzo
from the two-movement Shostakovich
Octet. It was forceful, almost violent in
its impact, exactly as Shostakovich had
conceived the pulsating dissonances
and swirling rhythms. Spectacular!
After the concert, one of the players
told me that the encore was a great
work "to let off some steam," which
only poses the question: after Beeth
oven and Mendelssohn, why was there
so much left to blow off?
