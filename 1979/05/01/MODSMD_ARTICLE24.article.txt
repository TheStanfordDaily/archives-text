Tom Robinson's second visit to the Bay Area (he played at
/ellerbach Hall in Berkeley last week) fell far short of his trium
phant debut here last June. This concert started sluggishly and
never really took off. It confirmed the worst doubts of first-time
fans that the lom Robinson Band hadn't developed at all over the
past 12 months.
Tom Robinson's appeal came from the bravery of his vehe
mently left-wing political views and the warm integrity with which
he delivered them. They proved to be the first band of the British
punk movement not to shrug off their political stance as soon as
they left the recording studio. They played benefits for battered
wives, juvenile delinquents, the Anti-Nazi League and against
homosexual persecution. The cover of their first LP, Power in the
Darkness, listed leftist organizations. And, of course, Tom Robin
son announced he was gay.
Thus, IRB was refreshingly daring. They showed rock could go
beyond the glorification of love, sex, drugs and adolescent frust
ration. "Right On Sister" (feminism), "Martin" (beating up
police), "Don't Take No For an Answer" (knocking capitalism)
and "Clad to be Gay" (homosexuality) were some of this band's
preoccupations.
There's a point, however, when politics overwhelm art. At
Berkeley, the messages were so heavy-handed, the music so
weak that all potential fun faded away. Who goes to concerts to
be lectured at? Tom Robinson's didactic drill-mastering was of

fensive; gone were the spontaneity and wit which made him so
endearing at the Old Waldorf last year. He even dressed like a
camp counselor and had as much animal magnetism as a lead
pencil.
The prosaic, unchanging noises from the three other band
members didn't much help the atmosphere. New songs were
indistinguishable from older ones; all followed a simple 1-2-3-4
rock heat. The organ sounds (provided by lan Parker) were pleas
anter than the thumping guitar of Danny kustow who slid around
the stage so much, he looked like he'd hurt himself. Robinson's
hoarse, limited singing voice registered only vehemence.
In all fairness, a lot of the audience happily lapped up Tom's
proselytizing. They obediently clapped, bopped and chanted.
There probably hadn't been so many raised fists in Berkeley since
the heydays of student protests. "Power in the Darkness," a good
strong number, and some of the other first-album hits were well
received.
Perhaps TRB fears dropping its budget of social commitment in
favor of commercial success. But, if they don't add to their act
some more light-hearted tunes or musical diversity, they'll lose
the popularity that Tom Robinson so obviously wants.
Interestingly enough, their biggest hit is "2-4-6-8 Motorway," a
great pop song with absolutely no political significance (A cynical
fan said it was a one-time gift from God). It needn't be only rock
and roll, but it does have to be entertainment.
