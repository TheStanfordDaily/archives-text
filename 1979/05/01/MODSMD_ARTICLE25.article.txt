Israelis welcome freed Jews
Tel Aviv — The hugs, kisses and adulation
reserved for heroes were lavished yesterday
on freed Soviet Jews Eduard Kuznetsov and
Mark Dymshits. They vowed to struggle to free
their brethren still languishing in Soviet prison
cells.
"We hope that with your help we can bring
all the freedom fighters from the Soviet Union
to Israel, including Anatoly Shcharansky,"
Kuznetsov said at an airport welcome cere
mony led by Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
"Thanks to your efforts we have arrived to be
with you," Dymshits added. "I'm happy that
after nine years I can join my family and my
country in my homeland. But there is still a
struggle before us. Flundreds of thousands of
Jews want to leave the Soviet Union."
The two Jews were among five Soviet dissi
dents released and flown to New York on Fri
day in exchange for two Soviets imprisoned in
America for espionage convictions.
Begin greeted the men and thanked Presi
dent Jimmy Carter for negotiating the release
of Kuznetsov and Dymshits, and relayed Car
ter's pledge "to continue his efforts until all
the prisoners of conscience are released and
allowed to come back to Israel, the land of our
forefathers."
They were sentenced to death for attempt
ing to hijack an airliner in 1970 after being
denied permission to emigrate, but after ad
verse international reaction the sentences
were reduced to 15 years in prison. Eight
others were convicted with them and five of
those were freed last week and returned to
Israel on Sunday.
Court convicts Soweto 11
Kempton Park, South Africa — A South Afri
can court yesterday found 11 black student
leaders guilty of sedition for organizing protest
marches in June 1976. Police intervention led
to bloody riots nationwide that left 700 blacks
dead.
In finding the "Soweto 11" — one woman

and 10 men — guilty, Justice Hendrik Van Dyk
dismissed the students' defense that their de'-
monstrations in the black suburban Johannes
burg township of Soweto were non-violent.
The students were protesting against the
separate and inferior black education system
and the use of the Afrikaans language in their
schools. The students had demanded they be
taught in English.
The judge's ruling defined sedition in the
broadest sense, terming it any gathering with
an intent to "defy, subvert or assail the author
ity of the state or any of its organs."
The trial was closely watched in South Africa
as the first indication of the government's re
sponse to the nationwide rioting, arson and
destruction during the summer of 1976. Offi
cials have said the rioting caused $17.35 million
in damage. Hundreds of blacks were detained
and hundreds more fled to exile abroad.
The trial was South Africa's first sedition case
in 30 years, and Van Dyk's ruling could give
South Africa's white minority government a
new weapon against black resistance to its of
ficial policy of apartheid — racial segregation.
EPA plans anti-waste campaign
Denver — Saying adequate safeguards are
not employed in the disposal of most hazard
ous wastes, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) announced yesterday that it will
seek legislation to create a $400 million annual
fund to pay for emergency waste clean-ups.
The money would be raised by a special as
sessment on oil and chemical companies and
producers of heavy metals, EPA spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington.
Fitzwater said the fund's size and the
method of assessing companies had not been
finalized. The proposed legislation creating
the fund will be submitted next month to Con
gress, he said.
"EPA estimates show that 80 to 90 percent of
the hazardous wastes produced in the U.S. are
not being disposed with adequate
safeguards," Barbara Blum, EPA deputy ad
ministrator, told a news conference here.

"We estimate that there are up to 2000 inac
tive and abandoned sites; sites which have yet
to be investigated by any government agency,
state or federal," she said.
When asked why the EPA is only now begin
ning to acton hazardous waste dumping, Blum
said, "When we prepared the Resource Con
servation and Recovery Act a year ago, we had
no idea of the extent of the problem. We were
really caught short."
Nuke plant requests federal aid
Washington — A Pennsylvania regulatory of
ficial, contending that the Three Mile Island
nuclear accident will have a "devastating fi
nancial impact" on both the plant's owners
and its customers, appealed to Congress yes
terday for a federal bail-out.
W. Wilson Goode, chairman of the state's
Public Utility Commission, urged the U.S.
government to rescue the stricken power
plant's owners from possible bankruptcy and
keep electric bills of Pennsylvania consumers
from skyrocketing.
Testifying before the Senate nuclear regula
tion subcommittee, Goode likened the
multi-million dollar proposal to past govern
ment loans to Lockheed Aircraft Co. and to
New York City.
He called for "low interest or no interest"
loans to General Public Utilities Corp., the pa
rent firm of Metropolitan Edison, which oper
ates the Three Mile Island plant.
And he suggested possible outright grants to
help defray the estimated $800,000-a-day cost
of purchasing replacement fuel.
The subcommitteechairman, Sen. Gary Hart
(D-Colo.), who has said the total cost of the
accident may reach $1 billion, asked the
Pennsylvania official if a distinction should be
made between buying replacement fuel and
actual clean-up operations.
"We don't see a distinction. To both con
sumers and stockholders, a dollar is a dollar,"
Goode said.
Without federal assistance, central Pennsyl
vania consumers face potential rate increases

of 30 percent to 40 percent as a result of the
nation's worst nuclear accident, Goode tes
tified.
Key economic index declines
Washington — A government index that is
supposed to foreshadow economic trends fell
0.5 percent in March, the third monthly de
cline in a row, signaling that a recession may
not be far off.
"It's consistent with the impression of those
who believe there will be a recession," said
William Cox, a top Commerce Department
economist. But Cox said he still holds to the
Carter administration's forecast that a reces
sion will be avoided.
The drop in the composite index of leading
indicators in March, announced yesterday by
the Commerce Department, followed declines
of 0.4 percent in February and 0.3 percent in
January.
A three-month decline is considered an in
dication that the economy may be about to
sink into a recession. However, the index has
been wrong before, and administration
economists sought to assure it is probably
wrong this time.
Dow Jones falls 1.74
New York — Takeover developments, both
real and rumored, accounted for most of the
excitement yesterday as the stock market
posted a small overall loss.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
slipped 1.74 to 854.90 on the heels of a 10.82
drop last Thursday and Friday.
Declines outnumbered advances by a 7-6
margin on the New York Stock Exchange.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with patchy low
clouds tonight. A little warmer. Lows in upper
40s to mid 50s, highs upper 50s and 60s.
Northwesterly winds 10 to 20 miles per hour.

The judge's ruling defined sedition in the
broadest sense, terming it any gathering with
an intent to "defy, subvert or assail the author
ity of the state or any of its organs."
The trial was closely watched in South Africa
as the first indication of the government's re
sponse to the nationwide rioting, arson and
destruction during the summer of 1976. Offi
cials have said the rioting caused $17.35 million
in damage. Hundreds of blacks were detained
and hundreds more fled to exile abroad.
The trial was South Africa's first sedition case
in 30 years, and Van Dyk's ruling could give
South Africa's white minority government a
new weapon against black resistance to its of
ficial policy of apartheid — racial segregation.
EPA plans anti-waste campaign
Denver — Saying adequate safeguards are
not employed in the disposal of most hazard
ous wastes, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) announced yesterday that it will
seek legislation to create a $400 million annual
fund to pay for emergency waste clean-ups.
The money would be raised by a special as
sessment on oil and chemical companies and
producers of heavy metals, EPA spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington.
Fitzwater said the fund's size and the
method of assessing companies had not been
finalized. The proposed legislation creating
the fund will be submitted next month to Con
gress, he said.
"EPA estimates show that 80 to 90 percent of
the hazardous wastes produced in the U.S. are
not being disposed with adequate
safeguards," Barbara Blum, EPA deputy ad
ministrator, told a news conference here.

"We estimate that there are up to 2000 inac
tive and abandoned sites; sites which have yet
to be investigated by any government agency,
state or federal," she said.
When asked why the EPA is only now begin
ning to acton hazardous waste dumping, Blum
said, "When we prepared the Resource Con
servation and Recovery Act a year ago, we had
no idea of the extent of the problem. We were
really caught short."
Nuke plant requests federal aid
Washington — A Pennsylvania regulatory of
ficial, contending that the Three Mile Island
nuclear accident will have a "devastating fi
nancial impact" on both the plant's owners
and its customers, appealed to Congress yes
terday for a federal bail-out.
W. Wilson Goode, chairman of the state's
Public Utility Commission, urged the U.S.
government to rescue the stricken power
plant's owners from possible bankruptcy and
keep electric bills of Pennsylvania consumers
from skyrocketing.
Testifying before the Senate nuclear regula
tion subcommittee, Goode likened the
multi-million dollar proposal to past govern
ment loans to Lockheed Aircraft Co. and to
New York City.
He called for "low interest or no interest"
loans to General Public Utilities Corp., the pa
rent firm of Metropolitan Edison, which oper
ates the Three Mile Island plant.
And he suggested possible outright grants to
help defray the estimated $800,000-a-day cost
of purchasing replacement fuel.
The subcommitteechairman, Sen. Gary Hart
(D-Colo.), who has said the total cost of the
accident may reach $1 billion, asked the
Pennsylvania official if a distinction should be
made between buying replacement fuel and
actual clean-up operations.
"We don't see a distinction. To both con
sumers and stockholders, a dollar is a dollar,"
Goode said.
Without federal assistance, central Pennsyl
vania consumers face potential rate increases

of 30 percent to 40 percent as a result of the
nation's worst nuclear accident, Goode tes
tified.
Key economic index declines
Washington — A government index that is
supposed to foreshadow economic trends fell
0.5 percent in March, the third monthly de
cline in a row, signaling that a recession may
not be far off.
"It's consistent with the impression of those
who believe there will be a recession," said
William Cox, a top Commerce Department
economist. But Cox said he still holds to the
Carter administration's forecast that a reces
sion will be avoided.
The drop in the composite index of leading
indicators in March, announced yesterday by
the Commerce Department, followed declines
of 0.4 percent in February and 0.3 percent in
January.
A three-month decline is considered an in
dication that the economy may be about to
sink into a recession. However, the index has
been wrong before, and administration
economists sought to assure it is probably
wrong this time.
Dow Jones falls 1.74
New York — Takeover developments, both
real and rumored, accounted for most of the
excitement yesterday as the stock market
posted a small overall loss.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
slipped 1.74 to 854.90 on the heels of a 10.82
drop last Thursday and Friday.
Declines outnumbered advances by a 7-6
margin on the New York Stock Exchange.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with patchy low

Northwesterly winds 10 to 20 miles per hour.
Israelis welcome freed Jews
Tel Aviv — The hugs, kisses and adulation
reserved for heroes were lavished yesterday
on freed Soviet Jews Eduard Kuznetsov and
Mark Dymshits. They vowed to struggle to free
their brethren still languishing in Soviet prison
cells.
"We hope that with your help we can bring
all the freedom fighters from the Soviet Union
to Israel, including Anatoly Shcharansky,"
Kuznetsov said at an airport welcome cere
mony led by Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
"Thanks to your efforts we have arrived to be
with you," Dymshits added. "I'm happy that
after nine years I can join my family and my
country in my homeland. But there is still a
struggle before us. Flundreds of thousands of
Jews want to leave the Soviet Union."
The two Jews were among five Soviet dissi
dents released and flown to New York on Fri
day in exchange for two Soviets imprisoned in
America for espionage convictions.
Begin greeted the men and thanked Presi
dent Jimmy Carter for negotiating the release
of Kuznetsov and Dymshits, and relayed Car
ter's pledge "to continue his efforts until all
the prisoners of conscience are released and
allowed to come back to Israel, the land of our
forefathers."
They were sentenced to death for attempt
ing to hijack an airliner in 1970 after being
denied permission to emigrate, but after ad
verse international reaction the sentences
were reduced to 15 years in prison. Eight
others were convicted with them and five of
those were freed last week and returned to
Israel on Sunday.
Court convicts Soweto 11
Kempton Park, South Africa — A South Afri
can court yesterday found 11 black student
leaders guilty of sedition for organizing protest
marches in June 1976. Police intervention led
to bloody riots nationwide that left 700 blacks
dead.
In finding the "Soweto 11" — one woman

and 10 men — guilty, Justice Hendrik Van Dyk
dismissed the students' defense that their de'-
monstrations in the black suburban Johannes
burg township of Soweto were non-violent.
The students were protesting against the
separate and inferior black education system
and the use of the Afrikaans language in their
schools. The students had demanded they be
taught in English.

and its customers, appealed to Congress yes
terday for a federal bail-out.
W. Wilson Goode, chairman of the state's
Public Utility Commission, urged the U.S.
government to rescue the stricken power
plant's owners from possible bankruptcy and
keep electric bills of Pennsylvania consumers
from skyrocketing.
Testifying before the Senate nuclear regula
tion subcommittee, Goode likened the
multi-million dollar proposal to past govern
ment loans to Lockheed Aircraft Co. and to
New York City.
He called for "low interest or no interest"
loans to General Public Utilities Corp., the pa
rent firm of Metropolitan Edison, which oper
ates the Three Mile Island plant.
And he suggested possible outright grants to
help defray the estimated $800,000-a-day cost
of purchasing replacement fuel.
The subcommitteechairman, Sen. Gary Hart
(D-Colo.), who has said the total cost of the
accident may reach $1 billion, asked the
Pennsylvania official if a distinction should be
made between buying replacement fuel and
actual clean-up operations.
"We don't see a distinction. To both con
sumers and stockholders, a dollar is a dollar,"
Goode said.
Without federal assistance, central Pennsyl
vania consumers face potential rate increases

of 30 percent to 40 percent as a result of the
nation's worst nuclear accident, Goode tes
tified.
Key economic index declines
Washington — A government index that is
supposed to foreshadow economic trends fell
0.5 percent in March, the third monthly de
cline in a row, signaling that a recession may
not be far off.
"It's consistent with the impression of those
who believe there will be a recession," said
William Cox, a top Commerce Department
economist. But Cox said he still holds to the
Carter administration's forecast that a reces
sion will be avoided.
The drop in the composite index of leading
indicators in March, announced yesterday by
the Commerce Department, followed declines
of 0.4 percent in February and 0.3 percent in
January.
A three-month decline is considered an in
dication that the economy may be about to
sink into a recession. However, the index has
been wrong before, and administration
economists sought to assure it is probably
wrong this time.
Dow Jones falls 1.74
New York — Takeover developments, both
real and rumored, accounted for most of the
excitement yesterday as the stock market
posted a small overall loss.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
slipped 1.74 to 854.90 on the heels of a 10.82
drop last Thursday and Friday.
Declines outnumbered advances by a 7-6
margin on the New York Stock Exchange.
