# Temple bodies arrive at base

Oakland (AP) — Nearly 300 Peoples
Temple members, who left the Bay
Area to find paradise in the jungle,
were expected to return today, their
bodies borne in stacked steel coffins
inside huge moving vans arriving
from the East.
Five 44-foot long vans were due to
arrive shortly after dawn at the Oak
land Army Base after completing
their different, secret treks from
Dover, Del., where the 297 identified
bodies had lain unclaimed in a milit
ary hangar for five months.
A sixth van, carrying 46 bodies, was
also to arrive today at Fort McArthur
near Los Angeles.
The corpses trucked cross-country

— and 248 unidentified bodies await
ing a similar trip — are what remains
of 913 Peoples Temple members who
died last November in Guyana.
The members had been led to the
jungle from California by the Rev. )im
Jones, who then led them in the mass
murder-suicide ritual following the
assassination of Rep. Leo Ryan.
Families of the identified victims
have been notified by mail on how to
claim their loved ones for burial.
The unidentified bodies, 210 of
them children, are still in Delaware,
awaiting preparation of graves at an
Oakland cemetary.
The unidentified bodies will go di
rectly to Evergreen Cemetery in Oak

land for burial. Any identified bodies
stored at the Oakland Army Base and
not claimed by relatives within 30
days will be buried at Evergreen.
The $300,000 cost of trucking and
burying the bodies will be paid by
assets of the defunct Temple, which
has an estate of $10 million or more.
The burial plan was ordered by a
San Francisco judge after officials
from the federal government and
various states haggled for months
over what to do with the bodies.
Under the plan, families who claim
their relatives at the Oakland Army
Base can be reimbursed for up to
$540 in burial expenses.
