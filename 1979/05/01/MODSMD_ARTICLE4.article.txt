# Carter knocks Kennedy's oil decontrol comments
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter said "baloney" yester
day to Sen. Edward Kennedy.
The president said he couldn't be
lieve the Massachusetts senator had
accused him of "throwing in the to
wel" in ordering the decontrol of
domestic oil prices and trying to
cover it up with a fig leaf in the form
of a windfall profits tax.
Kennedy made those comments
earlier yesterday to the American
Society of Newspaper Editors in New
York. Carter retorted at a White
House news conference in his half of
a quick one-two with the Democrat
who leads him in early public opin
ion polls on favorites for the 1980
presidential nomination.
When a questioner put Kennedy's
words to the president, Carter re
plied:
"That's just a lot of baloney."

Then, as if to temper his words, the
president added: "I really can't be
lieve that Senator Kennedy said this
unless the phrases were taken out of
context because everyone who's in
the Congress knows that decontrol is
mandated into the present law."
In his New York speech, Kennedy
said: "The overbearing power of the
oil lobby . . . has intimidated the
administration into throwing in the
towel without even entering the ring
on the issue of oil-price decontrol."
'Token' tax
He said the oil lobby "has also in
timidated the administration into
submitting a token windfall profits
tax that is no more than a transparent
fig leaf over the vast new profits the
industry will reap."
In an opening statement, the pres
ident said it was "imperative" that
the House Commerce Committee
approve the rationing plan when it
takes action today. "We must make
certain that gasoline can be distri
buted promptly and fairly in such an
emergency," Carter said.
The committee voted 22-2U last
week to reject the rationing plan, but
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chair
man of the panel's energy subcom
mittee, told reporters there was "a
very good chance" that vote would
be reversed today.
"We face the possibility of
gasoline shortages even as early as
this summer," the president said.
"Common sense tells us we must be
ready."
Carter's energy conservation plan,
ordered by Congress under a 1975
law, will die unless approved by the
House and Senate by May 12.
Another Carter energy
conservation measure ran into trou
ble in the Senate.

By a 12-5 vote, the Senate Energy
Committee tentatively rejected Car
ter's request for authority to order
weekend closings of service stations.
The committee's 12-5 vote is subject
to later change.
During the televised news confer
ence, the president's 48th in 27
months in office, Carter was asked
what he would do if a SALT II agree
ment were rejected by the Senate. "I
would do all I could, monitoring very
closely Soviet activities, to comply
with the agreements reached," the
president said.
Carter emphasized he believes
that the arms treaty, which is in the
final stages of negotiation, "will be
sound enough when it's completely
scrutinized by the public and the Se
nate, that it will be ratified."
Senate approval of the forthcom
ing treaty would require a two-thirds
majority. Most assessments of the
outlook hold that neither supporters
nor opponents have enough votes to
sustain their position.
Other topics
On other topics, Carter said:
— He favors extending to China
and the Soviet Union the special trad
ing status reserved for the United
States' allies if they meet the re
quirements, which deal with human
rights, for such privileges.
— The exchange last Friday of five
Soviet dissidents freed by Russia for
two Russian spies given up by the
United States was fair and the result
of "long and tedious and detailed
negotiations over six months."
— He expects some tapering off of
price increases in certain key areas of
the economy that are beyond gov
ernment control, particularly food
costs.

Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter said "baloney" yester
day to Sen. Edward Kennedy.
The president said he couldn't be
lieve the Massachusetts senator had
accused him of "throwing in the to
wel" in ordering the decontrol of
domestic oil prices and trying to
cover it up with a fig leaf in the form
of a windfall profits tax.
Kennedy made those comments
earlier yesterday to the American
Society of Newspaper Editors in New
York. Carter retorted at a White
House news conference in his half of
a quick one-two with the Democrat
who leads him in early public opin
ion polls on favorites for the 1980
presidential nomination.
When a questioner put Kennedy's
words to the president, Carter re
plied:
"That's just a lot of baloney."

Then, as if to temper his words, the
president added: "I really can't be
lieve that Senator Kennedy said this
unless the phrases were taken out of
context because everyone who's in
the Congress knows that decontrol is
mandated into the present law."
In his New York speech, Kennedy
said: "The overbearing power of the
oil lobby . . . has intimidated the
administration into throwing in the
towel without even entering the ring
on the issue of oil-price decontrol."
'Token' tax
He said the oil lobby "has also in
timidated the administration into
submitting a token windfall profits
tax that is no more than a transparent
fig leaf over the vast new profits the
industry will reap."
In an opening statement, the pres
ident said it was "imperative" that
the House Commerce Committee
approve the rationing plan when it
takes action today. "We must make
certain that gasoline can be distri
buted promptly and fairly in such an
emergency," Carter said.
The committee voted 22-2U last
week to reject the rationing plan, but
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chair
man of the panel's energy subcom
mittee, told reporters there was "a
very good chance" that vote would
be reversed today.
"We face the possibility of
gasoline shortages even as early as
this summer," the president said.
"Common sense tells us we must be
ready."
Carter's energy conservation plan,
ordered by Congress under a 1975
law, will die unless approved by the
House and Senate by May 12.
Another Carter energy
conservation measure ran into trou
ble in the Senate.

By a 12-5 vote, the Senate Energy
Committee tentatively rejected Car
ter's request for authority to order
weekend closings of service stations.
The committee's 12-5 vote is subject
to later change.
During the televised news confer
ence, the president's 48th in 27
months in office, Carter was asked
what he would do if a SALT II agree
ment were rejected by the Senate. "I
would do all I could, monitoring very
closely Soviet activities, to comply
with the agreements reached," the
president said.
Carter emphasized he believes
that the arms treaty, which is in the
final stages of negotiation, "will be
sound enough when it's completely
scrutinized by the public and the Se
nate, that it will be ratified."
Senate approval of the forthcom
ing treaty would require a two-thirds
majority. Most assessments of the
outlook hold that neither supporters
nor opponents have enough votes to
sustain their position.
Other topics
On other topics, Carter said:
— He favors extending to China
and the Soviet Union the special trad
ing status reserved for the United
States' allies if they meet the re
quirements, which deal with human
rights, for such privileges.
— The exchange last Friday of five
Soviet dissidents freed by Russia for
two Russian spies given up by the
United States was fair and the result
of "long and tedious and detailed
negotiations over six months."
— He expects some tapering off of
price increases in certain key areas of
the economy that are beyond gov
ernment control, particularly food
costs.
