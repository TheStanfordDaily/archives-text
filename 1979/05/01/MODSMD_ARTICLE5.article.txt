# Gas allotments to drop in May
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The long lines
and "closed" signs at gas stations
that plagued many motorists at the
end of April are likely to be worse in
May because many oil companies
have further reduced the quantity of
gasoline they sell to service stations.
The companies say the cutbacks
are due to tight supplies of crude oil
and the government's request that
they emphasize production of heat
ing oil at the expense of gasoline
production.
Oil companies have been limiting
the allocations of gasoline to dealers
for several months, generally to
about 95 percent of the amount of
gas the stations got a year ago. De
mand for gasoline is about 4 percent
higher than a year ago.
Standard Oil Co. of California,
maker of Chevron gasoline, is cut
ting its allocation of gasoline to deal
ers from 95 percent in April to 80 per
cent in May. Atlantic Richfield has cut
from 95 percent to 85 percent, Stan
dard Oil Co. of Indiana (Amoco) has
cut from 100 percent to 90 percent
and Exxon has cut from 95 percent to
80 percent.
However, the amount of gasoline
the companies sell in May will prob
ably not be quite as low as the alloca
tion numbers indicate.
The reason is that the companies
cannot limit all customers. They must
supply certain customers designated

by state governments as hardship
cases at levels similar to last year.
The firms also say they will provide
more gas to agricultural and public
service customers. And the com
panies say that a change in govern
ment rules on allocations since last
month make the cuts appear greater
than they are.
As a result, the amount of gasoline
actually sold by the companies will
be greater than the allocation levels.
Shell, for example, sold more than 90
percent as much gasoline in April as
it did the year before, although it was
allocating on the basis of 85 to 90
percent of last year's levels.
In May, Shell will give dealers in
the eastern half of the nation 80 per
cent as much gas as they got a year
ago. Dealers in the West will get 85

percent.
Similarly, Chevron expects to sell
about 93 percent as much gas in May
as it did a year ago and Exxon expects
to sell "about the same it delivered
last month and only slightly less than
the volume it sold in May 1978," ac
cording to a company statement.
Even so, the cutbacks will probably
cause a replay of the "closed" signs
and lines that popped up at the end
of April as gas stations used up their
monthly allotments, according to
analysts.
"We're going to have more prob
lems in May," said Dan Lundberg,
publisher of the Lundberg Letter, a
newsletter that covers the gasoline
industry. "As time wears,on, the im
pact of these allocations produces
lines."
