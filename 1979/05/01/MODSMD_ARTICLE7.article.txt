# Aitken on energy: let the sun shine in

Solar energy can solve America's energy
problems but only if we use it to heat our
homes directly instead of trying to convert it
into electricity, one of California's top energy
specialists said last night.
"Solar energy can fall into our laps in a lot of
wonderful ways," said Donald Aitken, profes
sor of environmental studies at San )ose State,
at a lecture and slide show at Skilling Au
ditorium. "It's exactly what we need right
now."
Aitken, a member of Gov. Jerry Brown's State
SolarCal Council, said that the United States
suffers not from an "energy crisis" but from a
"thermal crisis."
"People don't want energy, they want heat.
All they want is heat below the boiling point of
water," Aitken said.
Almost three-fifths of our energy goes into
producing heat, and another third is used for
producing mechanical motion (such as driving
cars and assembly lines), according to Aitken.
So the United States can lessen the energy
crunch by using solar energy and other alter
nate sources to provide heating, he said.
But the solar power he has in mind is not solar
collectors on rooftops, or even miles of solar
collectors that turn sunlight into electricity.
Rather, Aitken said, "passive" solar systems

are the answer. These involve building homes
with better insulation, or with giant windows
that let sunshine naturally heat the air inside
and circulate it to warm the house at a constant,
comfortable 70 degrees.
Aitken, who developed the United States'
largest solar water heater, which sits atop three
San Jose State dorms, mentioned some other
notable "passive" systems already in use. One,
which uses giant windows, was built in 1941 —a
house by Frank Lloyd Wright.
Another sits on the roof of Hewlett-Packard's
Sunnyvale plant: a $16,000 collection of solar
panels that helps cut fuel costs by $2000 a
month.
Stanford has its own system at SLAC, the
cheapest yet: plastic sheets painted black and
draped over the walls of the dining room there,
providing heat for about $1 per square foot.
Although it's not the most efficient system pos
sible, Aitken said, it's efficient enough.
Aitken praised solar energy enthusiastically.
"It's useful because in the daytime, when you
need it, the sun's shining and delivers it, and at
nighttime, you don't need it," Aitken said. "It's
totally accessible, so you can use it right there at
your home, and I don't have to sell it to you."
If solar energy were used to heat every home
in the country, it could displace about 6 percent
of our energy needs — enough energy to

power the United States' entire chemical or
metals industries, Aitken said.
Other alternative sources of energy may be
come economically feasible in the near future,
Aitken predicted.
Wind power, in the form of windmills, can be
used along both the East and West coasts and in
the Midwest. Ceothermal power (in the form of
hot springs) can contribute considerably to the
electric power needs of California, Hawaii,
Colorado and other Western states, he said.
And, unlike the fossil fuels, these sources are
permanent, he added.
But the switch to these "forever"
technologies must come soon, Aitken warned.
The fossil fuels that are now our primary source
of energy are becoming more difficult and ex
pensive to extract.
A complete switch is possible — America
switched from coal to oil in 60 years — but
because America's total and per capita energy
consumption has skyrocketed, and the em
phasis on growth makes energy conservation
difficult to achieve, America has only 20 to 30
years instead of 60 to make the change, he
warned.
Aitken's lecture was sponsored as part of En
vironment Month by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, SWOPSI and the Energy Information
Center.

As part of Environment Month's final week, Don Aitken gave a slide show
last night in Skilling Auditorium on present and future developments in
renewable energy sources. Aitken, witn the Environmental Studies Dept. at
San Jose State, offered solar energy as a potential solution to the nation's
thermal needs.
