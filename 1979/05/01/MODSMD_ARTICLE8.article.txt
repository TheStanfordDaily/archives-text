## We will not register 
### 
I will not register for con
scription.
We, the undersigned, will
make this statement at
today's anti-draft rally in
White Plaza. We will then
send it to U.S. Attorney
General Griffith Bell. What
does the statement mean
and why are we making it?
It means that if registra
tion is enacted by the gov
ernment (as it very well may
be this spring) we will
not comply. We will not
submit to registration, clas
sification or conscription.
To make such a pledge now
is not illegal. Once registra
tion and/or conscription is
passed it will be a crime to
make such a pledge and to
act on it. We understand
this. The pledge does not

become void when illegal.
Why make such a state
ment now? Seldom has
Congress acted so effi
ciently as it is acting on the
series of draft bills now be
fore it. It seems to us that
the government is in
terested in getting legisla
tion passed quickly into law
to prevent public debate
and resistance. Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park),
for example, continues to
claim that most of his con
stituents support his"na
tional service" proposal.
We do not think this is the
case. We know it isn't the
case with the very young
people McCloskey expects
to draft into his "national
service" or who will be re
gistered for future conscrip

tion under the other prop
osed legislation that is most
likely to pass.
The draft was abolished
before because people like
ourselves — ordinary
people — resisted it. They
went to prison, they went to
Canada and Sweden, they
went underground, they re
fused to register, they went
CO (were conscientious ob
jectors), they went absent
without leave (went
AWOL). The machine
couldn't work.
At its very heart, the milit
ary system, indeed war it
self, rests on the consent of
those who serve and fight
and die. We do not consent.
