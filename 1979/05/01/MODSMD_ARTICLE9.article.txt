## Only Jews are free in Israel 
### 
If I were to write an article in the Daily proc
laiming the justice and equality of South Africa's
system of apartheid and identified my source as
the South African Embassy, I would presume
that Stanford students would question the relia
bility of my source.
But a few weeks ago (Daily, April 5) a student
named Ken Farbstein wrote an article justifying
Israel's claim to the land previously called Pales
tine on the basis of its adherence to the ideals

Can a senior majoring in social
science really be so
unscholarly and naive as to
trust a government's own
rationalizations for annexation
and occupation?

embodied in our Bill of Rights. He noted that he
was a senior majoring in the social sciences. And
to give his article greater credibility he noted
that "much of this article was paraphrased from
Human Rights in the Administered Territories'
put out by the Israeli Embassy in Washington."
Can it really be possible that in the scholarly
and analytical environment of the University a
senior majoring in the social sciences could be
so unscholarly and naive as to trust a govern
ment's own rationalizations for annexation and
occupation?
And can it be possible that the readers of the
Daily are so uncritical or apathetic that no one
challenged the credibility of Farbstein's article?
Would an article denouncing Israel paraphrased
from a Palestine Liberation Organization pam
phlet be able to slip by so unnoticed and unchal
lenged? If students at a university have not
learned to consider issues critically, to question
the sources of their information, to study the
various sides of an issue and to challenge those
who fail to do so, then somehow the university

has failed in its primary objective.
As to the content of Farbstein's article, it be
gins by stating that "the sole morally valid criter
ion establishing a state's moral claim to a land is
that state's guarantee of a free and fruitful life for
its inhabitants." While I accept this premise, I
would ask him who is to judge what is "free and
fruitful" and how he defines "its inhabitants."
In 1948, the year Israel proclaimed its inde
pendence, Palestine had a population of about
1,280,000 Palestinian Arabs and 594,000 lews.
From that time, Israel has had to reconcile its
territorial imperatives, which call for an ever
expanding Israel to accommodate immigrants
and achieve self-sufficiency, with a demog
raphic imperative which has counselled against
the incorporation of Palestinian Arabs into Is
rael's political and social structure because they
would jeopardize the majority status Jews must
have for Israel to be both a Jewish and a democ
ratic state.
Israel's resolution of that dilemma has been to
systematically violate the human rights of the
Palestinians. Such events as the massacre of the
village of Deir Vassin under the leadership of
Menachem Begin before Israel's independence
was proclaimed led to a mass exodus of Palesti
nians.
Since Israel's existence, the deportation of
Palestinian leaders, the expropriation of land,
the torture of prisoners and the denial of equal
ity to Arab citizens of Israel have been well
documented by such respected sources as Am
nesty International, the London Times and the
Israeli League for Fluman and Civil Rights.
Israel may be providing a "free and fruitful
life" to its Jewish immigrants but such a Utopia
has been clearly denied to the Palestinians. In
this respect, Israel can be appropriately com
pared to its close ally, South Africa, since in both
countries freedom, equality and the other be
nefits of democracy are limited to an officially
recognized elite.
