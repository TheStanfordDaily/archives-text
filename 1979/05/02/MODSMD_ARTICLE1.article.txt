# Prof urges draft resistance

### Robert Reed 
Boston University Prof, and
U.S. historian Howard Zinn spoke
at a "resist-the-draft" rally here
yesterday afternoon, saying that it
is important to understand the
mentality of those who support
the draft in order to see how
wrong it is.
Zinn, a noted historian who has
written extensively on the history
of civil disobedience in the United
States, said that "the draft gets the
tacit support of an awful lot of
peoplewho makecertain assump
tions about what the draft is for
and what it does.
"The assumption that people
make when they support the draft
either actively or passively is that
we are all part of one community
. . . (that) we are all part of one big
family, which was started by the
'founding fathers/ and we are all
together in our interests, and out
side these boundaries are the
enemies. So when there's a draft,
the draft is a benign thing.
"It doesn't take too much sit
ting down and thinking, and yet I
guess not enough people have
done it, to realize that there is
something wrong with this as

sumption.
Different interests
"We are not part of one com
munity," Zinn said. "The people
who run General Motors and the
people who become G.l.'s in the
army, the people who are on the
boards of directors of oil corpora
tions and the people who end up
on the front lines of wars, are not
members of one family who have
common interests.
"Despite the rhetoric in the Vie
tnam War (which said) we did all
that for democracy, liberty, re
sponsibility and helping our
friends, the Pentagon Papers
show the three words that kept
recurring as to why we were in
Vietnam: 'tin, rubber and oil,' "
Zinn said.
Zinn claimed that civil resis
tance to the draft has occurred in
every war the United States has
fought. However, he added that
none of these protests were suc
cessful until the Vietnam War.
"It's important to have that
piece of history in mind because
otherwise we might think that it is
not possible for a nation to de
velop a domestic anti-war move
ment which is powerful enough to

play a part in stopping a major
war. But that is what happened in
the United States in the late 1960s
and early 70s.
National movement
"It is possible for a movement
which starts with a very small
number of people to develop into
a national movement of millions
. . . who altogether create a
movement of such opposition
and such resistance that the war
somehow has to be brought to a
halt."
According to Zinn, "We are in
the hands of small groups of men
who don't give a damn if we live or
die."
Zinn urged students to or
ganize. "Keeping in mind that
things start small, all we have to
do is start, and keepat it,"he said.
Registration petition signed
Following the speech, some 93
students marched across the
podium publicly signinga petition
signifying their refusal to register
in the event that military conscrip
tion becomes a reality. Among
them was a lieutenant in the U.S.
Naval Reserve who said he was
opposed to all forms of conscrip-

At a rally sponsored by the Students Against Conscription, historian Howard Zinn concurred with SAC members,
who urged students to resist the draft and to refuse to register if such legislation is passed.
House members extinguished the
blaze, believed to have been caused
by kerosene, by turning the board
over and pouring water on the
flames, according to Steve Clark,
outgoing president of Theta Chi.
Clark described house reaction to
the incident, saying "We're pretty
disgusted. It was a very stupid thing
to do."
"We just presumed it was some
kind of frat prank," Clark added.
"We're going to make sure the
Dean's office has all the information
about the incident and let them take
it from there."
Jim Hines, president of Kappa
Alpha, denied knowledge of the in
cident, saying, "I am not aware of any
organized KA activity at the Wall last
night."

According to Zinn, "We are in

Zinn urged students to or

do is start, and keepat it,"he said.

Boston University Prof, and
U.S. historian Howard Zinn spoke
at a "resist-the-draft" rally here
yesterday afternoon, saying that it
is important to understand the
mentality of those who support
the draft in order to see how
wrong it is.
Zinn, a noted historian who has
written extensively on the history
of civil disobedience in the United
States, said that "the draft gets the
tacit support of an awful lot of
peoplewho makecertain assump
tions about what the draft is for
and what it does.
"The assumption that people
make when they support the draft
either actively or passively is that
we are all part of one community
. . . (that) we are all part of one big
family, which was started by the
'founding fathers/ and we are all
together in our interests, and out
side these boundaries are the
enemies. So when there's a draft,
the draft is a benign thing.
"It doesn't take too much sit
ting down and thinking, and yet I
guess not enough people have
done it, to realize that there is
something wrong with this as

sumption.
Different interests
"We are not part of one com
munity," Zinn said. "The people
who run General Motors and the
people who become G.l.'s in the
army, the people who are on the
boards of directors of oil corpora
tions and the people who end up
on the front lines of wars, are not
members of one family who have
common interests.
"Despite the rhetoric in the Vie
tnam War (which said) we did all
that for democracy, liberty, re
sponsibility and helping our
friends, the Pentagon Papers
show the three words that kept
recurring as to why we were in
Vietnam: 'tin, rubber and oil,' "
Zinn said.
Zinn claimed that civil resis
tance to the draft has occurred in
every war the United States has
fought. However, he added that
none of these protests were suc
cessful until the Vietnam War.
"It's important to have that
piece of history in mind because
otherwise we might think that it is
not possible for a nation to de
velop a domestic anti-war move
ment which is powerful enough to

play a part in stopping a major
war. But that is what happened in
the United States in the late 1960s
and early 70s.
National movement
"It is possible for a movement
which starts with a very small
number of people to develop into
a national movement of millions
. . . who altogether create a
movement of such opposition
and such resistance that the war
somehow has to be brought to a
halt."
According to Zinn, "We are in
the hands of small groups of men
who don't give a damn if we live or
die."
Zinn urged students to or
ganize. "Keeping in mind that
things start small, all we have to
do is start, and keepat it,"he said.
