# Power on the campaign trail
## 
### Shur Reese 
Power, as anyone who has
taken Political Science can ver
ify, is a difficult word to define.
On May 8, 13 Palo Alto resi
dents will be vying for power in
the form of a post on the Palo
Alto City Council. Their power
will consist of making deci
sions on subjects ranging from
housing ordinances to alterna
tive energy sources.
There are only four positions
open to these 13 contenders.
Not only are their energy and
money being risked on the
venture, but also that of do
zens of campaigners and sup
porters who are willing to give
financial and unpaid time
commitments to the candi
dates they hope will win.
Who are these faceless sup
porters, who hold another
kind of power by managing the
campaigns and helping to
make or break a candidate's
chances?
Kathy McKennan, a full-time
nurse at Stanford Hospital, is a

divorcee with an eight-year-old
son. She is also coordinator of
the Doug Winslow for City
Council campaign.
"I don't know where she
finds the time," said Winslow,
"but she sure does. She's run
ning the whole campaign for
me which is great because I can
spend more time on the is
sues."
McKennan, a Palo Alto resi
dent for 25 years, is not a
novice to the local arena. Last
year, she managed the cam
paign office for Arlen Gre
gorio, state senate candidate.
Even this was not her first polit
ical exposure.
"I've been working on cam
paigns since I was 12," she
explained. "In fact, I'm old
enough to have carried leaflets
for Tom Dewey. He wasn't my
candidate, though; he was my
mother's. I was my son's age
then and now Sean carries leaf
lets for Doug (Winslow)."
McKennan said she is aiming
to be a professional campaign

manager. "You do this stuff for
free first, to show you can re
ally do anything you need to,"
she explained.
Another veteran of the local
campaign trails is Gloria
Brown, coordinator for the
Re-elect Anne Witherspoon
Committee. This is the fifth
local campaign Brown has
managed and she has never
suffered a defeat.
Brown has what one might
call the political instinct. "I can
just recognize that 'it' quality,"
she said.
But there is more to a good
campaign than instinct — it
needs a lot of ingenuity.
For Anne's first campaign we
hit the city dumps — over 1000
Palo Alto residents a day come
by there. Anne came in first
place, defeating three incum
bents, she said.
A campaign also involves
plenty of elbow grease. "For
Frances Dias' campaign, I
didn't know about bulk mail —
we licked about 20,000

stamps," Brown said.
Directly across the street
from Brown lives Aggie Robin
son. Though they are "best
friends," according to Brown,
and both have been active in
local politics for the last 15
years, they rarely broach the
subject with each other.
Robinson is, after all, treasurer
for one of Witherspoon's op
ponents.
Unlike Brown, Robinson has
been a successful political
candidate herself, serving for
10 years on the Palo Alto
School Board.
"I worked for Horace Ander
son, who ran for the school
board two years in a row. Then
I ran myself in 1963. I was on
the school board during the
'60s, a unique time to be work
ing for the schools."
In 1974 she was appointed to
the California Post-secondary
Education Commission, where
she still serves. "We are re
sponsible for everything from
cosmotology at beauty schools
to financial reports from pri
vate universities like Stan
ford," she said.
Mary Beth Baldwin, another
City Council candidate, is run
ning her campaign by herself
— almost. Her official cam
paign manager is her son, Toby
Baldwin. Toby, however, is
four years old. "I want him to
learn the ropes young," she
■explained with a laugh.
At $13.77, the Baldwin cam
paign has been the least ex
pensive of the 13 campaigns.
She said she was inspired to
run by listening to the KZSU
Monday night broadcasts from
the City Council."I thought to
myself, 'I can do that,' "
Baldwin remarked. "I'm an or
dinary citizen and I think I can
fairly represent the common
good."
Her campaign budget was
spent entirely on T-shirts for
herself and her son which they
wear when campaigning at
shopping centers.
"Mommy, I have to go to the
bathroom," her campaign
manager complained. On the
campaign trail, some times
things can be rough.
