# Course discusses psychic apparitions, life after death
## 
### Andrew Rich 
Two hours through a
grueling three-hour exam,
many students have won
dered whether there is such
a thing as life after finals. A
more select group, notably
seniors, are wondering this
quarter whether there is life
after graduation. An even
more select group of about
40 interested students
meets every Tuesday and
Thursday here to explore
the prospects of life after
death.
"Life After Death" is a
three-unit course being
taught through the Under
graduate Specials Program.
Instructor Ben Martin, who
works as program assistant
for the Values, Technology
and Society Dept., also
taught last quarter's course
on unexplained
phenomena which covered
the Loch Ness Monster,
UFO's, and the lost city of
Atlantis.
The course Life after
Death as Martin describes
it, is an academic approach
to psychic phenomenon
and covers "things that
aren't usually taught at a
university like Stan
ford,"such as apparitions,
reincarnation and death.
Martin said he has spent a
great deal of time research
ing the tremendous data av
ailable on "things that sci
ence can't explain.
"These events do happen
quite a bit; but few people
are willing to talk about
them," he said.
Whenever possible, Mar
tin invites guests to share
their personal experiences
with the class.
One such guest was Hazel
Blanchfield, a Mountain
View resident, who told the
class some of her psychic
experiences including deja
vu and visions of deceased

friends and family mem
bers. She told the class she
believes her father's spirit
prevented a potentially bad
automobile accident by
warning her to brake before
there was cause to. She also
said that at one time she
witnessed her own death in
a previous life, in which she
fell off a cliff.

"It makes no difference to
me if you believe me or
not," she said, but she
added that she believes
from her experiences that
"death has no string; life is
everlasting."
Martin himself has had an
experience which he be
lieves involved a regression
to previous lives. Having
always been interested in
parapsychology, he at
tended a November lecture
here given by Dr. Helen
Wambach, a noted hyp
notherapist. He then at
tended a group session with
Wambach during which he
was hypnotized.
"I was put in a extremely
relaxed state of mind, un
able to think critically;
completely passive," he re
membered. Wambach then
led him back through time,
having him explore the
dates at which he had the
most vivid images.
In the strongest vision he

experienced, Martin said he
believed he was a large, ugly
Spanish peasant, living
around 1210 A.D. He re
members being recruited
into an army and marching
along a road in unbearably
hot weather before finally
being killed.
AÂ»few days after this ses
sion, Martin did some his
torical research. "I found
that there was only one
campaign in which those
kings were involved to
gether. It took place in
1212," he said. Further re
search revealed that the
weather that year was in
credibly hot. Everything
seemed to fit.
Life after death, Martin
believes, is one of the
"more relevant areas of
parapsychology."
"Death happens to all of
us," he said. "But what
happens to us afterwards is
beyond our conscious con
trol."
Of his personal feelings,
Martin said "I have no
reasonable doubt that there
is life after death."
Student response to
the course has been posi
tive, according to Martin.
Some of the students, he
said, are taking the course
because they're religious;
some because they're lazy;
but the "majority are just in
terested in the topic." Early
in the course two or three
students indicated they
didn't believe in the
phenomenon at all; about
ten said they did and the
others commented that
they wanted to learn more
before they decided.
All in all, Martin said, Life
After Death is a way to make
spring quarter more in
teresting.He said he enjoys
teaching it, and plans to re
peat the course, perhaps
twice, next year.
