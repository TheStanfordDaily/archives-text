## Bombs begin at university labs 
### 
Back in February, I attended
a heated five-hour hearing of
the Board of Regents of the
University of California in Los
Angeles, the subject of which
was the propriety of the Uni
versity running the country's
two nuclear weapons labs, the
nearby Lawrence Livermore
Laboratories (LLL) and the Los
Alamos Scientific Laboratories
(LASL) in New Mexico.
While I was admittedly op
posed to nuclear holocaust be
fore the hearing, the testimony
of peace activists and UC stu
dents, faculty, and adminis
trators in exposing the labs'
key role in accelerating the
nuclear arms race blew me
away.
You may not have heard
about this hearing — none of
the major papers in California
or the rest of the country
chose to cover either the sev
eral hundred person picket
outside the meeting or the
damning evidence presented
in the first public debate ever
on the role of the University of
California in promoting nuc
lear proliferation.
What came out was that,
under the guise of "academic
freedom" on one hand and
"national security" on the
othe*, the labs have gone on
their merry way creating ever
more powerful weapons of de
struction with only a minimum
of public scrutiny. Meanwhile,
the University performs a
"public service" by providing
them with an aura of academic
legitimacy to keep up their
deadly work.
Indeed, I learned, the Uni
versity is the alma mater of
every single weapon in the
U.S. nuclear weapon arsenal,
from the Hiroshima bomb to
the neutron warhead. Yet, as
the "brains" of the nuclear
weapons production complex
in the United States, the labs
do more than just research and

development. The lab officials'
role in aggressively promoting
new weapons systems, push
ing the concept of "limited
nuclear exchange" and actively
lobbying against both the pre
sent Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks and previous test-ban
treaties have profoundly shaped
national military policies, and
ultimately, world politics.
Despite rhetoric about de
terrence, it is in fact the very

The UC name and prestige have helped
create and perpetuate the myth that
nuclear weapons research is under civilian
control . . .

research of the labs that sets
the pace and sophistication of
the present arms race. Far from
preventing a nuclear war, the
work of the labs greatly in
creases such a possibility. Herb
York, the first LLL director,
summed up the ironic paradox
this way: "Nearly all the
weapons which in the hands of
others were (and are) threaten
ing to our national security,
and indeed our very existence,
have been invented or per
fected by us in the first place."
The UC name and prestige
have helped create and per
petuate the myth that nuclear
weapons research is under civi
lian control, and influenced by
the University in some positive
way. Yet the University's own
Zinner Committee report
proves otherwise: "The
laboratories enjoy a delightful
autonomy within the protec
tive shelter of the University,
so delightful as to border on
the licentious."
Besides questions of moral
ity and accountability, the ques
tion of safety at the labs was
addressed that day in I os
Angeles. Experts testified that
the Livermore Labs, just an

hour from Stanford, sit on or
near 13 active earthquake
faults, with the potential for
disaster great as the labs
handle many radioactive sub
stances, including one of the
most deadly, plutonium. Less
than one one-thousandth of a
gram of plutonium inhaled into
a lung can cause cancer.
Dr. John Gofman, former LLL
associate director, has pre
dicted that a major accident at

the lab, caused by an ear
thquake or other event, would
cause from 10,000 to mill ions of
lung cancer deaths in residents
of California and would make
the state uninhabitable for
hundreds of years.
Lab employees have already
been exposed to dangerous
levels of radiation in a number
of serious accidents; most re
cently the State Health De
partment began a study to de
termine if the high tate of skin
cancer at Livermore was con
nected to this radiation expo
sure. Yet, lab officials continue
to downplay the dangers of
radioactive material. One in
terview I saw on T.V. with a
safety official at Livermore just
after the Harrisburg accident
burns in my memory— he said
that when plutonium got on a
worker's skin, why, we just
wash it off with soap and wa
ter! !!
Many opponents of the
weapons labs at the February
meetings appealed to the re
gents to convert the weapons
labs to peacetime work; others
demanded the complete
severence of the relationship
on the grounds that the Uni

versity is an institution of learn
ing and has no business mak
ing weapons. The regents af
terwards commented that they
hadn't learned anything new.
On May 5, thousands of
people from throughout the
West will converge on both the
Livermoreand Los Alamos Labs
for mass rallies, marches, and
peace conversion fair, to af
firm their belief in a nuclear
free future. I sincerely urge
you to go, if only to learn more
about the issue. After all, what
better place to learn than
where the bombs begin?

Back in February, I attended
a heated five-hour hearing of
the Board of Regents of the
University of California in Los
Angeles, the subject of which
was the propriety of the Uni
versity running the country's
two nuclear weapons labs, the
nearby Lawrence Livermore
Laboratories (LLL) and the Los
Alamos Scientific Laboratories
(LASL) in New Mexico.
While I was admittedly op
posed to nuclear holocaust be
fore the hearing, the testimony
of peace activists and UC stu
dents, faculty, and adminis
trators in exposing the labs'
key role in accelerating the
nuclear arms race blew me
away.
You may not have heard
about this hearing — none of
the major papers in California
or the rest of the country
chose to cover either the sev
eral hundred person picket
outside the meeting or the
damning evidence presented
in the first public debate ever
on the role of the University of
California in promoting nuc
lear proliferation.
What came out was that,
under the guise of "academic
freedom" on one hand and
"national security" on the
othe*, the labs have gone on
their merry way creating ever
more powerful weapons of de
struction with only a minimum
of public scrutiny. Meanwhile,
the University performs a
"public service" by providing
them with an aura of academic
legitimacy to keep up their
deadly work.
Indeed, I learned, the Uni
versity is the alma mater of
every single weapon in the
U.S. nuclear weapon arsenal,
from the Hiroshima bomb to
the neutron warhead. Yet, as
the "brains" of the nuclear
weapons production complex
in the United States, the labs
do more than just research and

development. The lab officials'
role in aggressively promoting
new weapons systems, push
ing the concept of "limited
nuclear exchange" and actively
lobbying against both the pre
sent Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks and previous test-ban
treaties have profoundly shaped
national military policies, and
ultimately, world politics.
Despite rhetoric about de
terrence, it is in fact the very

The UC name and prestige have helped
create and perpetuate the myth that
nuclear weapons research is under civilian
control . . .

research of the labs that sets
the pace and sophistication of
the present arms race. Far from
preventing a nuclear war, the
work of the labs greatly in
creases such a possibility. Herb
York, the first LLL director,
summed up the ironic paradox
this way: "Nearly all the
weapons which in the hands of
others were (and are) threaten
ing to our national security,
and indeed our very existence,
have been invented or per
fected by us in the first place."
The UC name and prestige
have helped create and per
petuate the myth that nuclear
weapons research is under civi
lian control, and influenced by
the University in some positive
way. Yet the University's own
Zinner Committee report
proves otherwise: "The
laboratories enjoy a delightful
autonomy within the protec
tive shelter of the University,
so delightful as to border on
the licentious."
Besides questions of moral
ity and accountability, the ques
tion of safety at the labs was
addressed that day in I os
Angeles. Experts testified that
the Livermore Labs, just an

hour from Stanford, sit on or
near 13 active earthquake
faults, with the potential for
disaster great as the labs
handle many radioactive sub
stances, including one of the
most deadly, plutonium. Less
than one one-thousandth of a
gram of plutonium inhaled into
a lung can cause cancer.
Dr. John Gofman, former LLL
associate director, has pre
dicted that a major accident at

the lab, caused by an ear
thquake or other event, would
cause from 10,000 to mill ions of
lung cancer deaths in residents
of California and would make
the state uninhabitable for
hundreds of years.
Lab employees have already
been exposed to dangerous
levels of radiation in a number
of serious accidents; most re
cently the State Health De
partment began a study to de
termine if the high tate of skin
cancer at Livermore was con
nected to this radiation expo
sure. Yet, lab officials continue
to downplay the dangers of
radioactive material. One in
terview I saw on T.V. with a
safety official at Livermore just
after the Harrisburg accident
burns in my memory— he said
that when plutonium got on a
worker's skin, why, we just
wash it off with soap and wa
ter! !!
Many opponents of the
weapons labs at the February
meetings appealed to the re
gents to convert the weapons
labs to peacetime work; others
demanded the complete
severence of the relationship
on the grounds that the Uni

versity is an institution of learn
ing and has no business mak
ing weapons. The regents af
terwards commented that they
hadn't learned anything new.
