"The essential conviction behind the Stanford
residence program is that living and learning
should be integrated, not separate. Where and
how students live greatly affects their intellec
tual and social development."
The above excerpt from the policy statement
of the University Residence Program describes
the University's awareness of the great extent to
which living environment influences the well
being of its students. A concrete example of this
attitude is the recent university procedure re
garding the program forconstruction of the new
student housing complex. The attention de
voted to meeting needs of students reveals a
sensitivity that should result in the creation of
desirable housing.
The Advisory Committee for New Residences
was formed in early lanuary by Dean of Student
Affairs Jim Lyons.
Its purpose is to make recommendations con
cerning the general nature and configuration of
approximately 800 new residence spaces to be
constructed by 1982, under current plans.
Lyons' goal in selecting the committee
members was to create a diverse group of staff
and students in order to obtain a variety of ideas.
"The only general criteria was that everybody
chosen had to be available to attend meetings at
noon on Thursdays," Lyons said. "Each member
was chosen to represent a different interest or
consideration of importance.
"We obviously needed the director of resi
dences, someone from data research, food ser
vice, and the project manager," Lyons con
tinued. "We also wanted advice concerning up
keep from housing management, imagination in
terms of possibilities in residential education
from that department, and advice on campus
architectural continuity from the planning of
fice.
"We included as many RA's (Residence Assis
tants) as possible to represent a variety of hous
ing experiences. The students chosen were

those actively involved on campus in commit
tees, publications or student government be
cause they each have access to input from a
large segment of the student body," he said.
During the past five months the Advisory
Committee has met weekly in order to discuss
basic issues. Topics considered include house
and room sizes, centralization of dining areas
and arrangement of meeting spaces for social,
cultural and recreational activities.
Statistics from the 1978 student housing draw
describing the priority levels of existing facilities
are taken into consideration. Committee mem
bers toured residences in order to accurately
determine the factors contributing to resi
dences' popularity or failure.
An equally thorough examination of options
has been undertaken by the Architect Screening
Committee. The elaborate architect screening
process began with an examination of all of the
most prominent Bay Area architectural firms.
Initial evaluation criteria included experience in
university and residential architecture, availabil
ity according to location and workload, creativ
ity, practicality and the appearance of recent
projects.
Three finalists presented their analyses of the
potential of the project at a campus interview.
The committee members have recently cast
their votes for a final choice. The results are
being withheld until the decision is presented to
the Board of Trustees for approval May 7.
The committee's choice is a result of evalua
tion according to uncompromising standards.
Each of the three finalists have recently
completed projects that are considered to be of
highest quality architectural design.
The policy of this university, evidenced in every
aspect of the planning of the new complex, has
been much more than a mere attempt to silence
campus housing shortage complaints. The ad
ministration's sincere effort to upgrade the qual
ity of residence life deserves recognition.
