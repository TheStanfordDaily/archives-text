# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## David Thom Normality test subjective

I grew up, as did many stu
dents here, amid the common
prejudices and stereotypes re
garding gays, lews, longhairs,
radicals and anyone with dark
skin. Despite the severe hand
icap of being a heterosexual
male white Anglo-Saxon Pro
testant, I feel that I've been
largely successful, over the
past four years, in washing off
these stains from the high
school locker room.
However, there is at least one
subset of this community
around whom I still feel un
comfortable, with whom I
don't talk, and about whom I
hoid many stereotypes and
prejudices which I've never re
ally questioned. This group is
the "crazies" â€” people who,
while usually not really crazy,
behave in ways which are, well,
you know, weird.
Some hang around Tresid
der a lot. Others make the
rounds through the row
houses, especially the co-ops.
Due to the weeding out pro
cess by officials who handle
such things, most are fairly be
nign. Taken together, they are
a heterogeneous and vaguely
defined group.
But they are there, existing
somewhat precariously in the
cracks of society. And I, and I
expect most students here as
well, manage to ignore these
people as we tread the path to
grad school.
But wait. Aren't our judg
ments about them different
than common prejudices
against other groups in our
society? I mean, after all, there
is something wrong with them.

I'm not so sure. Many people
who behave strangely are, in
some important way, mentally
different. But their objective
differences may be slight com
pared with the differences in
how other people treat them.
Categorizing people as "crazy"
can often be a self-fulfilling
prophecy, as several investiga
tive studies about mental in
stitutions have pointed out.

is used to suppress those with
different political, religious or
moral beliefs throughout the
world (including the United
States). Labeling is a defensive
reaction to the threat of differ
ences.
Today we have fairly definite
standards for what is "nor
mal." In a small town, strange
behavior may be well-tolerated
according to one study, if the
person is already a member of
the community. A person be
having strangely in an urban
setting is more easily excluded
by the other people around.
With the wider range of
models and experiences to
choose from, greater
psychological pressures and
increasing impersonalization
of modern society, oppor
tunities for developing abnor
mal behavior are increased. A

recent study, reported in the
Chronicle, found that 42.5
percent of a random sample of
midtown Manhattan pedest
rians were classed by psychiat
rists as "mentally impaired to a
significant degree."
Does this mean the remain
ing 57.5 percent should bar
ricade themselves against the
42.5 percent? Certainly there
are severely disturbed people,
and people who pose a danger
to others because of mental or
emotional problems. But most
people who behave strangely,
those I have termed crazies,
are far more like "normal"
people than they are different.
They are individuals in a par
ticular environment who are
either unable or unwilling to
keep their behavior within the
range considered normal.
Under different circumstances
they might cross back over that
line into normal society.
Perhaps the range of be
havior we recognize as "nor
mal" is unnecessarily narrow.
Perhaps the prejudices and
assumptions we hold about
people whose behavior places
them beyond the "normal"
line are not as well-founded as
we might think and may, like
many prejudices about people
based on the categories we
place them in, be very harmful.
Maybe the University, with
its self-proclaimed goal of di
versity and tolerance, is a good
place to start questioning such
common assumptions about
behavior.
