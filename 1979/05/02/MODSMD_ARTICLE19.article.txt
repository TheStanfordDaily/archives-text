Identity subjective
That Philosophy Prof. John
Perry is lecturing on personal
identity here, as reported in
the Observer (March), shows
that there is interest at Stanford
in the subject; this I am glad to
see. However Perry seems to
be concerned only with objec
tive criteria for personal iden
tity and to neglect the subjec
tive experience of personal
identity.
Personal identity is a subjec
tive experience. You can argue
it away by showing the diffi
culty of finding objective
criteria. But the realization of
personal identity always re
turns again as soon as one
thinks subjectively about one
self and one's individuality.
For the individual, the exis
tence of time and the existence
of his own identity are coter
minous because time exists
and only exists for him in rela
tion to his own identity. If an
individual believes that time
existed before he was born and
continues to exist after he dies,
then he must believe that in
some way he as an individual
existed before he was born and
continuous to exist after he
dies.
Time, like personal identity,
is a subjective experience.
Each individual creates time for
himself although his time
meshes with the time of every
other individual. Since the in
dividual can look backward
and forward in time without
end, time must extend into
both past and future without
end.
Although most individuals
cannot readily remember any
details of their existence be
fore their birth, they must have
a memory that extends without
limit into the past. Since one's
memory is a part of one's indi
viduality, each individual is de
fined by an infinite quantity of
information. So the complete
individuality of any individual
cannot be created in a finite
period of time.
I am well aware that many,
perhaps most, people would
not agree with what I say. But
this is only because they have
not thought these things
through.

Fission preferred
I am again prompted to re
spond to another anti-nuclear
column, this one by Doug Sor
tino (Daily, April 26). The thrust
of his column misses the point.
By ignoring coal and oil, Sor
tino seems to suggest that
trendy "soft energy paths"
(how comforting, how soft and
cuddly-sounding), are the al

ternatives to nuclear power.
Wrong. At present, solar
power is useful for space heat
ing and hot water. It is not
economical for either use,
however, and is prohibitive for
generation of electricity. Solar
and wind are probably decades
away from producing much of
our energy, unless the Arabs
start charging $100 per barrel
or so.
In the end, the same old
question arises, though Sor
tino avoided it: where do we
get the electricity between
now and when solar, wind, fu
sion, etc., come on line? The
choices are coal, oil and nuc
lear fission.
Sortino states alternative
energy risks can't be compared
quantitatively because they're
qualitatively different. That's
simply nonsense. But here's a
qualitatively different risk
that's seldom considered.
Burning coal and oil throws
huge amounts of CO(2) into
the air. As the atmospheric
concentration of CO(2) in
creases, the legendary
greenhouse effect may come
into play. Then the Antarctic ice
sheet could melt and raise the
oceans by 50 feet. I'd much
rather store nuclear wastes for
thousands of years in Nevada
than go surfing in Bakersfield.
Sortino says no nation could
tolerate even one meltdown.
This statement is meaningless.
He can't mean that no nation
could run the risk of a
meltdown; many do. Does he
mean that one meltdown
would force the closure of the
balance of a country's nuclear
plants? Ask the people in the
Carolinas who face rolling
blackouts if the Nuclear Reg
ulatory Commission closes
their nuclear plants soon. The
people might prefer lights and
jobs.
I look forward to the end of
nuclearfission, butforthetime
being it's preferable to coal, oil
or depression.

Senior ideas
This week the Senior Class
Presidents will be in White
Plaza in order to solicit sugges
tions for Class Day and Senior
Gift ideas. While I encourage
all interested students to par
ticipate in this decision, I have
the following suggestions:
— Have some seniors speak
during class day. Traditionally
three faculty noted fortheirwit
and wisdom are chosen to
speak before the class and
their (our) parents. This is un
doubtedly of more val ue to the
visitors than it is to us. There is
to my knowledge no provision
for students to speak at all dur
ing Commencement weekend,

students whose perspective is
badly needed.
This is not to say that a stu
dent will necessarily make a
better speech than a faculty
member (somehow I doubt it),
but it will be a different one,
and as a matter of principle
such a speaker should be in
cluded in the proceedings.
Perhaps another forum can be
set up during a free hour of the
weekend for just this purpose.
— Direct the class gift to
wards the establishment of an
endowed chair in Women's
Studies. The only hitch here is
money. I've spoken to people
in History, Political Science,
Sociology and Psychology de
partments and they have all
been receptive to the idea.
The establishment of such a
chair would demonstrate the
Class of '79's commitment to
the integration of women's
studies into the curriculum; a
correlated commitment to the
integration of women into the
faculty (the statistics are too
dismal to repeat) and continue
the emphasis in teaching qual
ity by directing an academic
gift.
The problem is that an en
dowed chair, at last glance,
cost well into the 6-figure
category, while the size of the
class gift is marginally in 4 fi
gures. We can solve this di
lemma by establishing the
target, and embarking in some
ceative marketing to cajole

the powers that be to kick in
some dough.
There is lots of money look
ing for a cause at the University
— experience provides the les
son that the administration and
trustees alway s manage to find
the money when they really
want it — and I challenge my
fellow seniors to embark on
this somewhat energetic
scheme. The only limit here is
commitment on the part of the
class.
The only other demand I
have is that an undergraduate
participate on the Search
Committee to fill the chair.
I invite responses and
suggestions to this offer.

COP says no
Please rest assured that the
Council of Presidents of the
Associated Students of Stan
ford University unalterably re
jects the various proposals for
peacetime conscription,
whether for military or service
duty. Further, we support
non-violent action towards the
defeat of such proposSls.
What more can we say?
