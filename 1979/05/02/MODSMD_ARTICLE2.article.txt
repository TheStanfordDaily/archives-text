# Scientists develop new x-ray technique

A team of scientists here have ob
served a new x-ray source called
channeling radiation which may have
applications in chemistry, physics
and medicine.
Because of the x-rays' special qual
ities, progress is likely to be made in
reducing dosages of x-rays to which
patients must be subjected, accord
ing to Dr. Mark Alguard, senior re
search associate at the Stanford Elec
tronics Laboratories.
The team consists of Alguard,
Pediatrics Prof. Richard Pantell, and
Richard Swent, graduate student in
electrical engineering. In collabora
tion with the group were Drs. Barry
Berman and Stewart Bloom from the
University of California's Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, and Dr. Shel
don Datz from the Oak Ridge Na
tional Laboratory.
Channeling radiation is highly "di
rectional," meaning the x-rays can be

projected in a single beacon of light
which can "see smaller objects (such
as cancerous tumors) normal x-rays
might easily miss," said Pantell.
Also, rather than irradiating a per
son's entire body, a single beam
could be aimed at just a portion of a
patient's body, said Swent.
X -ray dosages lowered
Channeling radiation also contains
a unique narrow band of energies,
and is "tunable" (its frequencies can
be intensified or lowered). Both
these qualities are also useful for
lowering x-ray dosages, according to
Alguard.
Certain materials are most respon
sive to particular frequencies of
x-rays. If one wants to take an x-ray of
a patient's pancreas, and knows that
the organ contains a lot of a certain
element, said Alguard, one can tune
the x-rays to the frequency which re
ceives the highest response (the
clearest picture) and thus eliminate a
lot of unnecessary frequencies to
which the patient would otherwise
be subjected.
According to Pantell, channeling
radiation may also have some more
immediate applications for chemists
and physicists. By bouncing x-rays
off of different atoms within crystals,
scientists can "study the behaviors of
atoms and the forces that exist within
them," said Pantell.
Predicted earlier
Channeling radiation was first
predicted four years ago by Robert
Terhune, a visting scholar here at
that time, and Pantell, who recently
presented his findings at the spring
meeting of the American Physical
Society in Washington, D.C. Accord
ing to Pantell, the predictions were
also made simultaneously by two
groups of scientists in Russia. Pantell
has since corresponded with two of
the Russians, Drs. Kumakhov and
Vorobriev, who have done "a lot of
theoretical output. We're not sure
just how they stand experimentally,"
said Alguard, "but we think they may
now be attempting to do what we've
done."
Funding for the experiment was
awarded to Pantell a year and a half
ago by the Basic Sciences Division of
the U.S. Dept. of Energy, through a
contract with Stanford. The experi

ments were performed at the Liver
more Laboratory.
In one of the experiments last
November, channeling radiation was
finally observed using a linear elec
tron accelerator. In the experiment,
a stream of electrons with negative
charges are shot through the ac
celerator down "a tunnel of mic
rowaves," said Swent. Traveling at
nearly the speed of light, they pick
up speed and energy until they are
run into a dense piece of tungsten.
The intereaction with the tungsten
releases a great deal of energy, and
positrons, particles of antimatter
with the same mass as electrons but
positively charged, are created from
the electrons.
Traveling down an orchard?
A single stream of positrons is then
projected out of the accelerator and
into a perfect crystal of silicon. The

"channeling" occurs in the silicon
crystal between its perfectly aligned
rows of atoms. The positrons weave
down the channels of atoms in the
crystal just as a person might travel
down the path between two rows of
trees in an orchardâ€”an analogy
drawn in several scientific texts, said
Alguard.
The positrons and x-rays then pro
ceed towards an energized magnet
which deflects the positrons down
into a "beam dump" while the x-rays
continue on as a highly refined form
of energy, "about 20,000 times the
energy level of typical particles of vis
ible light," said Alguard.
The scientists are hoping to de
termine which channels in a crystal
generate the highest levels of energy
by tilting the crystal in different ang
les while continuing to shoot posit
ron streams.
