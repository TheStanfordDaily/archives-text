# New organization invites students to share with community
## 
### Julie Tsoi 
"First training class today at
pool. Cot totally lost before I
found 3864 Middlefield Rd. the
Community Association for the
Retarded (CAR) swim center.
Pool wasn't an ordinary one -
was indoors, with special
ramps and stairways. Cot there
late while a swimmer's mom
was telling us how grateful she
was for the one hour rest she
got while her child was having a
lesson. Besides the excitement
of finally getting involved, I
was pretty anxious and a bit
worried about one crucial fac
tor we had yet to meet - the
kids."
The kids. Children ranging
mostly from 4 to 18 years of
age. Children with autism,
cerebral palsy, developmental
disabilities and physical, emo
tional and mental handicaps.
Children with backgrounds as
diverse and probably more
taxed than those of Stanford
students themselves.

Some children are enrolled
in a variety of programs offered
at CAR, including the swim
program, creative recreation
and day care programs. Many
of the mentally disabled are
students at the Peninsula Chil
dren's Center (PCC) next door.
There they learn living duties
like cooking, shopping or
other skills.
Many of the orthopedically
handicapped have undergone
surgery, some several times.
Others have been rejected
from public schools time after
time.
"But all the children have
special needs and potential of
their own, and could always
benefit from time alone with
someone who was willing to
share with them," said Joanne
Trembley, a sophomore here
who works at CAR.
Many Stanford students
have shared a bit of themselves
at these programs. Others
have also worked with adults in

CAR work activity and creative
recreation programs. Said
sophomore Missy Swartz,
"Saying 'it broadens your edu
cational experience' is too trite
a phrase explaining work at
PCC. It involves really applying
yourself as an individual, put
ting yourself on a one-to-one,
hit-or-miss situation with a kid
you may or may not be able to
handle."
About 25 students here re
cently organized the Stanford
Volunteers for the Handicap
ped Guild to expose more
Stanford students to the be
nefits of working with hand
icapped students and to bring
more volunteers to local in
stitutions.
This week, members of the
guild are presenting slide
shows in dorms detailing the
volunteer-student relation
ship.
"When I first began work at
the CAR swim center," said
sophomore Jon Salo, "I was

very uncomfortable and un
easy. Perhaps it was that I was
overly conscious of their hand
icaps — society can us
too aware of a person's dis
abilities by telling us to do all
we can to pretend not to see or
accept those disabilities. Or
perhaps I was frustrated be
cause I sensed a feeling of
powerlessness — like I wanted
to work miracles. But as soon
as I realized that drastic
changes wouldn't come over
night, then I could starMiaving
fun with the students and
enjoy putting in as much as I
could."
As Swartz said about her
work at PCC, "Some days you
don't even look forward to
going — you often have many
not-so-positive experiences
before having one great one.
Most experiences there are
either really bad or really good
— you either get punched in
the stomach or you make a kid
happy."

Through making a child
happy or by helping an adult
become an active member in
society, there are undoubtedly
many benefits that differ for
each student and each volun
teer. For senior John Ceiss, as
staff member at CAR, "It's the
chance to get away from
studies into a real-life situation
Cathy James, a sophomore,
said she feels that through vol
unteering she has had "the
extra bonus of being able to
meet many interesting people
— people with a lot of curios
ity, a lot of depth and concern,
too."
Or as Salo put it, "Working
with the handicapped offers a
practical challenge. The kids
will really test your spontaneity
and ability to get along.
"For me, it's an experience
that I will remember more and
that I think will contribute to
the social condition more than
any research or lab work I am
involved in."

and ability to get along.
"For me, it's an experience
that I will remember more and
that I think will contribute to
the social condition more than
any research or lab work I am
involved in."

"First training class today at
pool. Cot totally lost before I
found 3864 Middlefield Rd. the
Community Association for the
Retarded (CAR) swim center.
Pool wasn't an ordinary one -
was indoors, with special
ramps and stairways. Cot there
late while a swimmer's mom
was telling us how grateful she
was for the one hour rest she
got while her child was having a
lesson. Besides the excitement
of finally getting involved, I
was pretty anxious and a bit
worried about one crucial fac
tor we had yet to meet - the
kids."
The kids. Children ranging
mostly from 4 to 18 years of
age. Children with autism,
cerebral palsy, developmental
disabilities and physical, emo
tional and mental handicaps.
Children with backgrounds as
diverse and probably more
taxed than those of Stanford
students themselves.

Some children are enrolled
in a variety of programs offered
at CAR, including the swim
program, creative recreation
and day care programs. Many
of the mentally disabled are
students at the Peninsula Chil
dren's Center (PCC) next door.
There they learn living duties
like cooking, shopping or
other skills.
Many of the orthopedically
handicapped have undergone
surgery, some several times.
Others have been rejected
from public schools time after
time.
"But all the children have
special needs and potential of
their own, and could always
benefit from time alone with
someone who was willing to
share with them," said Joanne
Trembley, a sophomore here
who works at CAR.
Many Stanford students
have shared a bit of themselves
at these programs. Others
have also worked with adults in

CAR work activity and creative
recreation programs. Said
sophomore Missy Swartz,
"Saying 'it broadens your edu
cational experience' is too trite
a phrase explaining work at
PCC. It involves really applying
yourself as an individual, put
ting yourself on a one-to-one,
hit-or-miss situation with a kid
you may or may not be able to
handle."
About 25 students here re
cently organized the Stanford
Volunteers for the Handicap
ped Guild to expose more
Stanford students to the be
nefits of working with hand
icapped students and to bring
more volunteers to local in
stitutions.
This week, members of the
guild are presenting slide
shows in dorms detailing the
volunteer-student relation
ship.
"When I first began work at
the CAR swim center," said
sophomore Jon Salo, "I was

very uncomfortable and un
easy. Perhaps it was that I was
overly conscious of their hand
icaps — society can us
too aware of a person's dis
abilities by telling us to do all
we can to pretend not to see or
accept those disabilities. Or
perhaps I was frustrated be
cause I sensed a feeling of
powerlessness — like I wanted
to work miracles. But as soon
as I realized that drastic
changes wouldn't come over
night, then I could starMiaving
fun with the students and
enjoy putting in as much as I
could."
As Swartz said about her
work at PCC, "Some days you
don't even look forward to
going — you often have many
not-so-positive experiences
before having one great one.
Most experiences there are
either really bad or really good
— you either get punched in
the stomach or you make a kid
happy."

Through making a child
happy or by helping an adult
become an active member in
society, there are undoubtedly
many benefits that differ for
each student and each volun
teer. For senior John Ceiss, as
staff member at CAR, "It's the
chance to get away from
studies into a real-life situation
Cathy James, a sophomore,
said she feels that through vol
unteering she has had "the
extra bonus of being able to
meet many interesting people
— people with a lot of curios
ity, a lot of depth and concern,
too."
Or as Salo put it, "Working
with the handicapped offers a
practical challenge. The kids
will really test your spontaneity
and ability to get along.
"For me, it's an experience
that I will remember more and
that I think will contribute to
the social condition more than
any research or lab work I am
involved in."
