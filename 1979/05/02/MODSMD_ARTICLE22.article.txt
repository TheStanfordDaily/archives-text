John Pyle, the 6-foot-3, 210-
pound senior who mans first
for the Stanford baseball team,
blasted a grand slam home run
in yesterday's non-league
game against Santa Clara, lift
ing the Cardinals to a 7-2 vic
tory.
The grand slam, Pyle's first of
his career, was his fifth home
run this season.
It came in the fifth inning of
the afternoon contest played at
Santa Clara. To set the stage,
Larry Reynolds reached first
base on an error by Bronco

second baseman Gary Daven
port. Phil Wilson drew a walk,
and Mike Codiroli sacrificed
Wilson and Reynolds to sec
ond and third.
Paul Zuvella walked to load
the bases. Bruce Walters
popped-out to Davenport for
the second out of the inning,
but Pyle refused to leave the
runners stranded. "JP" took
pitcher Dave Litwak's offing
out of the ballpark to straight
away right field.
Stanford jumped out to an
early 2-0 lead in the game and
was eyeing a shutout until

Bronco batsmen spoiled those
hopes in the seventh inning.
Larry Kuhn started the game
for the Cardinals and pitched
his scheduled three innings in
sterling form. Kuhn allowed
only one hit — an infield single
in the third.
Relieving Kuhn in the fourth,
Paul Crame stifled the Broncos
for another three innings col
lecting four strikeouts in his
stint.
Santa Clara scored its two
runs in the seventh off
freshman Brian Mignano, the

third scheduled pitcher of the
game. With two outs in the in
ning, Davenport singled to
right and Bronco shortstop
Fred Mullins followed with a
double.
Sean Everton drove in both
runs as he laced a single to
right field.
Mignano got out of the in
ning and survived the eighth
before Jerry Battenberg came
on in the ninth to bust the
Broncos with a one-two-three
inning.
Outfielder Mike Codiroli
went two-for-three yesterday
to break out of a recent batting
slump.
