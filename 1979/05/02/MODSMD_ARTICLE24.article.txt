The women's crew com
peted this past weekend at
Lake Merritt in the Bay Area
Rowing Festival (BARF), an invi
tational which attracted oars
women from San Diego to
Seattle.
In Saturday's heats, the
novice eight qualified for the
finals in a well-stroked race.
The eight returned Sunday to
compete against the top six
teams. Though Stanford raced
well, Santa Clara captured the
event.
BARF's feature event, the
open eight, was also on Sun
day. California entered three
varsity boats, with its "A"
boat winning, as expected, in
front of Stanford's.
One rower commented,

"You think we're bad, at least
we made the finals. Think
about the five blob schools we
beat!"
