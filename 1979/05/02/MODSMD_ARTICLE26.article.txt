Committee stalemates on gas plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's standby
plan for gasoline rationing was sent limping to
ward an uncertain fate on the House floor yester
day by a deeply divided House Commerce Com
mittee.
The panel barely agreed, on a 21-20 vote, to have
the full House decide the issue. The committee,
spurning Carter's nationally televised appeal for
its support, decided instead to send the plan to the
House floor without a recommendation.
The "no-recommendation" vote came after
supporters of the plan failed for the second time
within a week to win committee approval of it. A
motion seeking that endorsement died yesterday
on a 21-21 tie vote.
Later in the day, an effort was launched in the
same committee to block another Carter energy
initiative, the administration's plan to lift controls
from domestic crude oil prices beginning June 1.
But a vote on that issue was delayed until today.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) said the measure
will see floor action within the next few days. The
plan will die unless both chambers approve it by
May 12. A 1975 law required submission of a
standby rationing plan to Congress.
In another development, House Speaker Tip
O'Neill predicted that the House would
strengthen Carter's proposed "windfall profits"
tax and that Carter, when told this at a White
House leadership breakfast, had commented,
"the stronger the better."
O'Neill also said that his Massachusetts col
league, Sen. Edward Kennedy, was mistaken in
accusing Carter of caving in to oil industry pres
sure in decontrolling oil prices. "I'm on the same
team as the president," O'Neill said.
And the Senate Energy Committee approved
12-6 its own substitute approach to Carter's re
quest for standby power to close gasoline stations
on weekends.
Under the committee bill, Carter would set con
servation targets for each state, and the states
would develop plans to meet them. Only if a state
failed to meet its goal could the president order
conservation steps.
South African labor laws may go
Cape Town, South Africa — A special commission
yesterday recommended that discriminatory labor
laws be abolished so blacks may have the same
pay, training and union membership as whites, a
move sure to spark an uproar in this white
dominated nation.
The suggestions were seen as an effort to fill
skilled and semi-skilled positions for which there
are not enough whites and in part to assuage
foreign criticism of the nation's racial policies.
The recommendations from the 2-year-old
government-appointed panel would erode the
cornerstone of the white minority-ruled nation's
30-year-old laws of apartheid that even mandate

separate bathrooms and cafeterias at work.
But a number of multi-national firms in South
Africa — especially those from the United States —
already have opened non-segregated eating
places, worked toward a policy of equal pay for
equal work and tacitly recognized black unions,
even though they were technically illegal.
The white minority protects its 4.4 million mem
bers with employment laws at the expense of the
nation's other 26.6 million residents, most of them
blacks, who earn perhaps five to nine times less
than whites.
If the commission recommendations are ac
cepted and the current laws are changed by the
all-white Parliament, blacks would not only be en
titled to form their own labor unions, but also to
negotiate with management and to strike.
May Day rallies spur patriotism
Worker solidarity, the stuff of traditional May
Day rallies, took a back seat in many nations yes
terday to themes of austerity, revolution, age-old
national rivalries and future uncertainty.
— The Chinese, battling to modernize their
country, were told to practice economy.
— Iranians hailed their Islamic revolution.
— Iraqis, violently opposed to the Egyptian-
Israeli peace, burned President Anwar Sadat in
effigy.
— Sadat accused Saudi Arabia of paying other
Arabs to break relations with Egypt.
— The Syrians and Jordanians lashed out against
Israel.
Hospital spy finds elderly abused
Chattahoochee, Fla. — A nurse assigned to spy
on employees at a state mental hospital here says
elderly patients were tied in their chairs for up to
six hours at a time.
Dr. John Awad, district administrator for the
Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services, said yesterday that five hospital
employees were suspended and others may be
disciplined because of the report by Hattie King
Thomas, a state public health nurse based in
Jacksonville.
Thomas' report, obtained by the Tallahassee
Democrat, told of 10 patients who were tied in
their chairs in the morning and not released or
taken to the bathroom until 2 p.m.
In another incident cited by Thomas, a patient
had set her hair on fire by putting out a cigarette in
it. A nurse's aide hit her twice on the arm for
extinguishing the cigarette in her hair, Thomas
wrote.
Thomas, who worked at the hospital from
March 28 through April 4, said in her report that
one ranking nurse's aide told her to ignore the
abuses.
"I was told to know nothing orsee nothing. That
in Rome, I do as the Romans," she wrote. "Even
the nurses know better than to say anything," she

said an aide told her.
Awad said the problems at the 325-patient
geriatrics unit do not reflect usual procedures at
the hospital, which has a total of more than 1900
patients and employs 2600 people.
Iranian Moslem leader murdered
Tehran, Iran — Ayatollah Morteza Motahari, one
of Iran's top Moslem leaders, was shot last night as
he left a dinner party and died at Torfeh Hospital,
hospital officials said.
They said Motahari was struck by a single bullet.
Sources said a caller to the morning newspaper
Ayendegan claimed responsibility for the killing
on behalf of the little-known Forghan group,
which also took responsibility for the assassina
tion April 23 of Gen. Mohammad Vali Gharani,
former armed forces chief of staff for the re
volutionary regime.
Schoolboy spiker joins girls' team
Providence, R.I. — A federal judge ruled yester
day that a 19-year-old male senior must be allowed
to play on his high school's all-girl volleyball team.
The judge said the ruling would not lead to male
domination because the student has only "limited
ability."
Parties in the case said Chief U.S. District judge
Raymond Pettine's ruling is the first in federal
court on a boy's attempt to play on an all-girl team.
Pettine said the student, Donald Gomes, was
barred from the team only because of his sex, and
would suffer "irreparable harm" if not allowed to
play. There is no boys' volleyball team at the
school.
"In light of his relatively limited ability, there is
little possibility that his participation would sub
stantially disrupt league play or provide one team
with a disproportionate advantage," Pettine said.
The preliminary injunction issued by Pettine
applies only to Gomes, and does not open up
other girls' teams to male participation.
