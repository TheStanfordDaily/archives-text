# Theta Chi wall burns
## 
### 
Five University students attempted
to steal the People's Wall of Democ
racy, a large message-covered board,
from Theta Chi at approximately 9:30
Monday evening.
In addition, the wall was burned in
an alley behind Theta Chi, according
to police reports.
According to Lieutenant Marvin
Moore of the Stanford Police, two
patrolling officers spotted the stu
dents attempting to remove the Wall.
The officers stopped them and asked
for identification. All five students
were identified as Kappa Alpha
pledges.
Moore stated that the students
"were released without arrest or
charges," although the students'
names were recorded on the police
record.
At approximately 3 Tuesday
morning, police were called to Theta
Chi to investigate a small fire. The
People's Wall was found smoulder
ing in an alley behind Theta Chi, ac
rnrHino to Mnnrp
tion. The petition is being sent to
United States Attorney General
Griffin Bell, who will have to pro
secute anyone who dodges draft
registration if it is enacted.
SAC spokespersons said that to
even register for the draft would
be to offer "implicit" support of
the growth of militarism and the
destruction of human lives.
Organizers of the protest are
worried that registration will be
enacted this spring with no real
debate even though polls show
that young people are very
strongly opposed to such legisla
tion. There are at least eight bills
before Congress which call for
some form of military registration
or selective service.
This May Day protest, repor
tedly one of over 60 occurring
around the country Tuesday, is
part of Stanford's Peace Week.
Peace Week, organized by mem
bers of SAC, will culminate with a
debate between Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and
several anti-draft spokespeople
on May 5 in Bishop Auditorium.
