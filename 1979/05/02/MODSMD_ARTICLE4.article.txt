# SLAC workers complain about possible poisoning

### Brad Brockbank 
Several workers at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
may have received toxic doses of
hexavalent chromium, a suspected
carcinogen, according to United
Stanford Employees (USE) General
Manager David Novogrodsky.
Symptoms among workers at
SLAC's Heavy Fabrication Building
have prompted Novogrodsky to file z
formal charge with the Univertsity,
demanding improvement of the
"health and safety problems" at the
facility.
SLAC spokespersons have denied
that workers have suffered toxic ef
fects directly resulting from chro
mate inhilation.
The charge is the latest action
taken in a long string of events which
started at the beginning of 1978.
In January of 1978, workers at the
Heavy Fabrication Building began
work on large metallic structures to
be used in the construction of the
multi-million dollar Positron-
Electron Project, or PEP ring. The
steel plates to be worked on had
been coated with zinc chromate
paint in order to prevent rust. When
subjected toweldingand machining,
zinc chromate dust is emitted, ac
cording to a report compiled by Leo
Seidletz, a professor at UC-San Fran
cisco Medical School and health and
safety consultant for the union.
Metallic taste
Tom Ramsey, USE steward and
welder at the facility, said that early
on in the project, he complained to
the management about a metallic
taste in his mouth. According to
Ramsey, fans were brought in, but
that only served to spread the fumes
around the building. Ramsey said
that many times during the first half
of 1978, the smoke in the building
was "so thick you couldn't see from
one end of the building to the
other."
In response to complaints about
the heavy smoke and fumes, the pro
ject was moved outside the building
in July, Ramsey said.
Workers at the facility began ex
periencing health problems at the
beginning of 1979, according to
Novogrodsky. Written statements
from 18 workers at the Heavy Fabrica
tion Building described recurrent
symptoms such as headaches,

bloody noses, sore throats and irrita
tions.
Symptoms
According to a pamphlet put out
by the U.S. Department of Labor Oc
cupational Safety and Health Ad
ministration (OSHA), long-term ex
posure to hexavalent chromium can
cause "headaches, coughing, con
gestion, breathing difficulty and
chest pain. ... In the nose (these)
ulcers can cause perforation of the
cartilage dividing the nasal cham
bers."
After analyzing the 18 statements
and further interviewing workers at
the site, Seidletz concluded in his
report that the reported symptoms
display "virtually the entire constel
lation of symptoms known to be con
sistent with such poisonings and vir
tually no symptoms are displayed
which are inconsistent with such
(chromate) poisonings."
By the time the Department of
Energy (DOE), which monitors
health and safety compliance at
SLAC, came to the site on March 28,
almost all of the work on the job was
completed. A letter from Joe La
Crone at the San Francisco Opera
tions office at the DOE to Novog
rodsky said that SLAC management
had been informed of the situation.
On April 2, a meeting was called by
Herman Zaiss, the department head
at the facility. The meeting was at
tended by both USE representatives
and SLAC management.
Respiratory virus possible cause
Dr. Charles Beal, head of SLAC's

medical department, gave his diag
nosis of the situation at that meeting.
Last week, he explained his position
in a telephone interview with the
Daily.
Beal said he believed the
symptoms were not caused by zinc
chromate inhilation, but rather were
mainfested by a respiratory virus.
"We could find no pattern that
suggested it could be a toxic prob
lem," he said. Beal said that he was
puzzled by the fact that virtually no
one from the Heavy Fabrication
Building came to his office to comp
lain about any symptoms. Con
sequently, he said, he based his de
cision on the evidence he had,
namely the written statements and
the report of Industrial Hygienist Al
Salazar, who tested the airatthe facil
ity in March.
Chromate level
Salazar measured the level of
chromate to be four micrograms per
cubic meter, according to Fred
Peregoy, safety officer at SLAC. The
OSHA pamphlet states that "workers
must not be exposed to hexavalent
chromium in concentrations exceed
ing 50 micrograms per cubic meterof
air averaged over an eight-hour
period.
However, the pamphlet adds that a
new standard, currently in develop
ment, will reduce the permissible
exposure limit even further. Accord
ing to both Peregoy and Seidletz, this
proposed new standard will be one
microgram per cubic meter.
