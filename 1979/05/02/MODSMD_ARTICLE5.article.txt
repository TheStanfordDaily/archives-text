# Diplomas enlarged

### Brad Crystal 
What is 8% inches wide, 11 in
ches long, weighs about as much
as a feather, yet takes four years to
earn? Answer: the new enlarged
Stanford diploma.
The new diplomas, to be pre
sented at this year's and future
commencements, are almost 100
percent larger than the old eight
by six inch versions. The enlarge
ment will provide room for the
listing of more than one major if a
student has a double major, as
well as space to indicate de
partmental honors.
Formerly, departmental honors
certificates were given out sepa
rately and a student majoring in
more than one subject could only
list a single major on the diploma.

Credit for completion of course
requirements in the other major
appeared only on the student's
transcript.
The changes were mandated by
the Faculty Senate at the end of
last year, according to Assoc. Re
gistrar Bob Houghton. He said the
new size will not raise printing
costs substantially.
Calling the modifications "not
really that major," Houghton
explained that the working and
printing style will be the same as
last year. Houghton said that the
inscription on University dip
lomas has remained fairly con
stant over the last 30 years.
University diplomas are to be
presented on Commencement
Sunday, June 17.
