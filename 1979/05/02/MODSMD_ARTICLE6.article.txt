# Grappling with theme, COSS-R approval
## American Studies gets vote of confidence 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
The success of the three-year-old American
Studies House has been a controversial topic on
campus this year. The merits of the theme, the
implementation of the theme at the house and the
amount of resident involvement in house activities
have been questioned.
However, the house has weathered the criti
cisms and received a vote of confidence from the
Subcommittee on Residences of the Committee
on Student Services (COSS-R) after a presentation
in February. Such a vote allows the house to re
main on campus next year.
The concept of an American Studies theme
house was proposed by the American Studies Stu
dent Association in 1975 at the same time that
American Studies became a formal major.
That proposal stated that "the interdepartmen
tal and interschool nature of the field (American
Studies) reinforces our belief that it should have a
residential home base, where the academic and
the social aspects of learning are brought to
gether, and where the study of a living institution
— the American Republic — can find continuous
and coordinated expression on historical and con
temporary issues."
Since its inception, the house has functioned as
an independent entity, separate from the Ameri
can Studies Department. "We gave the house

moral support," said Religious Studies Prof. Wil
liam Clebsch, chairman of the American Studies
program. "But we don't want to lash the two boats
together. We do encourage our majors to partici
pate in house activities."
Problems in structure
After pursuing an autumn quarter "Elections in
American History" theme, "some of the house
leadership rightly perceived" inherent problems
in the house and theme structure, according to
Row Director Michael Bever. "They were con
cerned that the house not drift away from its origi
nal goals and become less than what they wanted.
"As a result, they started rattling some cages and
talked about it. Some people suspected that the
house was in trouble," he said.
"American Studies is a vague thing," said one of
next year's two theme associates, Alex Alben.
"You can take off in a lot of different directions,
but that's difficult to do in a residence."
"This year we experimented a little," Alben said,
with a fall theme on elections and two subsequent
quarters on the media.
During winter quarter, all academic theme
houses were evaluated by COSS-R, according to
Associate Dean Norm Robinson.
Each house under review gave a presentation
before the committee of its events and aspirations.
Asst. Dean of Residential Education Alice Supton
said that COSS-R evaluated the houses along sev

eral main themes: 1) Is the house living up to its
original plan? 2) What is the student activity level in
the house? 3) How strong is the house leadership?
4) Does the house function effectively?
Theme focus, participation studied
Looking primarily toward the academic and cul
tural strengths plus the continuing interest of stu
dents and the general health of the theme of the
house, "COSS-R realized that it has an important
role to play in advising," Bever said.
"We were concerned that the focus of the
theme was not primarily in the house, and that the
level of student participation was low," said Sarah
Beckham, the chairman of COSS and an ex-officio
member of COSS-R.
"It seemed that a lot of activities were spon
sored by outside groups like SCOPE," COSS-R
member Peter Joost said. "It seemed like there
were a few energetic people in the house, but the
committee felt that more people were just hanging
around and kind of floating."
American Studies leaders are wrestling with the
difficulties of managing a vibrant theme in a popu
lar and physically attractive house.
"We want to discourage those students who are
here because this is 566 Mayfield," said house
resident Richard Wohl. "We are making the sc
reening process progressively tougher to make
people more serious about the theme," Alben ad
ded.
