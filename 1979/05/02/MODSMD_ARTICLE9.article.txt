San Francisco (AP) — Gas sta
tion lines should shorten this
week as dealers get their new
monthly fuel allocation, but
motorists can still expect shor
ter weekday hours and wide
spread weekend closings.
The situation in Northern
California should be better
than over the weekend, which
the California State Au
tomobile Association said
showed the most worry by
motorists about gas supplies
since the gas crisis of 1973—74.
Yesterday was the first day of

the new allocation period. Ear
lier, AAA information officer
Mark Gerstie said, "We would
hope things would be a little
better then. But a lot of dealers
have already 'borrowed'
against next month's alloca
tions.
"You just can't say defi
nitely," he said. "Everything is
on a station—to— station
basis."
The AAA said stations selling
regular gas for less than 79
cents are rare, while 83.1 is the
current average.
