# Disco product of evolution

Disco music, disco dancing, disco clothes,
disco roller skating: it's been more than a year
since John Travolta opened the door to discom
ania in Saturday Night Fever and everything is
still coming up disco.
Some may have thought at one time that
disco was just a fad that would go the ways of
streaking and goldfish swallowing. Now it
seems that disco falls somewhere between a fad
and an institution: call it a trend that may stay
around for awhile.
The 1960s heralded the first real disco fever.
Psychedelic, "far-out" discotheques sprang up
everywhere from New York to California, and
everybody who was anybody (including Jane
Fonda, Carol Channing and Marlon Brando)
learned to dance the Swim, the Frug and the
Watusi.
Disco dances in those days were variations of
the Twist; they were easy, sexy and fun. All
inhibitions were flung aside, replaced by wild
and crazy energy under the socially acceptable
heading of go-go madness.
Music like the Doors' "Light My Fire" would
send even the most mild-mannered go-goer
into irrepressible storms of the Jerk or the Slop.
Only a decade has passed since the king of
disco Killer Joe Piro and his followers writhed
and wiggled the nights away in New York's
hottest discotheques. Since then, a new wave of
discomania has swept the country.
Born in New York City in the early '70s, it is
now a $4-billion-a-year industry which has
created a continuous hustle for big profits.
There are more than 10,000 discos in the coun
try, of which 7000 opened last year. The key
ingredients to an instant disco? Just add lights,
records and a disc jockey to your favorite bar,
and Voila!
Although the basic components of today's
discos are the same as those of the '60s dis
cotheques, there are also some basic differ
ences. Today, groovy and organic are out;
dazzling and expensive are in. Tight pants and

baggy sweaters have been replaced by silks and
sparkles. Mirrors and elaborate lights over
whelm the senses and add to the glittery scene
that is disco.
Disco music has changed with the times, just
like everything else. The Bee Gees, almost obso
lete a few years ago, now reside at the top of the
charts, with "Saturday Night Fever" as the
biggest seller in record history. The new beat for
the feet is put together as a mixture of soul, jazz
and rock, making those turbulent dances of the
'60s almost impossible to do.
Today's dances date back even further, deriv
ing from the Swing, Tango, Jitterbug and even
the Waltz and Minuet. Dancers sometimes look
like ice skaters; other times they resemble bar
barians performing the latest sexual rite.
So why is disco right up there with tennis,
skiing and spectator sports as one of the truly
contemporary forms of recreation? Some say
that disco heralded a search for pleasure in the
form of decadent and insatiable hedonism, the
kind enjoyed by the Romans before their de
mise.
Another answer is that only the sensory
overkill produced by the striking flood of lights,
sounds and rhythms of disco can turn on the
modern man whose senses have been dulled by
living in a highly technical, overstimulating en
vironment. Modern man cannot be satisfied by
moderation. He must take everything as far as it
can be taken, resulting in a proliferation of ex
tremes which is the essence of disco.
Still others say that disco is a narcissistic activ
ity amplified by sexy clothes, floor-length mir
rors and flashing lights. Everyone wants to be a
star, and the showcase atmosphere that per
vades throughout the disco provides a tempor
ary ticket to stardom.
The true explanation of disco's popularity
may have been overlooked in its simplicity:
Disco is plain fun.
