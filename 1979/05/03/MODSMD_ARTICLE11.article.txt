# A 						high quality rock and roll alternative

### Marilyn Rosenberg 
Ready to abandon putrid Palo Alto for
sparkling San Francisco, I stumbled
upon a sign at the Keystone Palo Alto.
"Improve your personal life! Embark on
a new adventure!" Having followed this
advice, I'm relieved to report that fun
times on the Farm don't have to end
with dark, beer-filled rooms and other
people's stereos.
The Keystone, for those who can't de
cide whether to spend Saturday at
Meyer or Tresidder, is located at 260
California Avenue in Palo Alto. Basi
cally, the club offers hot and cold drinks
and high quality rock and roll.
Housed in a large, tunnel-shaped
building, it has a number of advantages
over many of the city's night clubs. Its
ceiling is high, the dance floor is large,
the tables are well-spaced, and the
tiered floor provides a good view from
everywhere in the house.
Musically, as well, the Keystone com
pares favorably with other Bay Area
clubs. One reason for this is the origin
of the club, which dates back to the six
ties. At that time its owner, Fred Her

rerra, was running a strip joint in North
Beach.
Michael Bloomfieid asked
According to Mark Curtis, a former
ASSU Special Events director who is
now booking agent for the Keystone,
Michael Bloomfieid asked Herrerra if he
could play at the club. Soon, Bloomfieid
was bringing in groups like Santana,
Elvin Bishop, the Doobie Brothers, and
Jerry Garcia.
Before long, Herrerra needed a larger
club. In 1968, he sold the North Beach
club, which is now a jazz club called the
Keystone Korner. To accomodate his
groups, he started the Keystone Ber
keley and, two years ago, the Keystone
Palo Alto.
Having two clubs in the Bay Area
seems to have its advantages, one of
which is the proximity of the clubs to
two of the area's largest universities.
Another is being able to offer bands two
engagements. Finally, and most obvi
ously, Herrera has the advantage of a
long-term association with bands
which, since the sixties, have become
almost legendary.

Among Keystone bands most popular
with students here are Journey, Pablo
Cruise, andTower of Power. Also popu
lar are the Monday night KFAT broad
casts, which usually feature country
music and to which everyone eighteen
and over is admitted free.
Probably of the most interest to stu
dents here is the Keystone College
Blowout, a party co-sponsored by Stan
ford, San Jose State, and University of
Santa Clara, which is scheduled for May
25. This event is free with Stanford 1.D.,
and will feature cheap drinks and beer
and hours of loud music.
Who to look for
When asked who will be playing,
ASSU Special Events director John Har
ris said, "Look for either the Brothers
Owens, Uncle Rainbow, or Bodidlee."
Other upcoming attractions include
Commander Cody on May 11, Greg
Kihn on May 12, Stoneground on May
17, and Pearl Harbor on May 18.
This sampling shows a fairly wide var
iety of musical styles. Speaking of the
Keystone's music, Curtis said "It's
mostly rock and roll. But we're aiming

more towards jazz." Curtis was not
wildly enthusiastic about punk,
suggesting that it does not go over well
in the Bay Area and that its audience is
pretty well absorbed by Mabuhay Gar
dens in the City.
As varied as the Keystone's music is
its crowd, which changes with each
band. Curtis characterizes them as
largely working people from South Palo
Alto.
Interviewing audience members,
however, it seems that they come from
all over the Peninsula, from the Bel
mont and San Mateo area as well as from
Cupertino and San Jose. Most seem to
be in their twenties and thirties.
Those interviewed expressed an avid
interest in rock and funk music, many of
them adding that they hate disco.
Although musical tastes differed
slightly, audience members seemed to
share a liking for the atmosphere of the
Keystone, many having come there at
least three or four times, some coming
once a month or more. Charlie, a regular
from San Jose, calls the Keystone "the
best entertainment in the area."
