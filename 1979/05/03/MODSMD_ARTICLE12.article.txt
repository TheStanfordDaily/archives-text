# A
						revitalization of the traditional jazz club
## 
### Ted Gioia 
It is common knowledge
among jazz connoisseurs that
the most conducive atmos
phere for improvised music is
to be found in clubs. The past
two decades have seen more
and more jazz move into the
concert hall, and the trend
seems to be continuing.
For the jazz musician this has
been a welcome change: large
auditoriums mean larger audi
ences and larger salaries. But
hard-core jazz fans lament the
new-found success which jazz
has achieved.
Where have the great jazz
clubs of the past gone — the
Half Note, Mintons, Birdland,

the Five Spot, and Monroe's?
Only a few, such as New York's
Village Vanguard, survived the
rocking '60s when jazz was
forced to go underground, not
for the first time in its history
and probably not the last.
The Bay Area is also rich in
jazz traditions, but even here
the list of defunct jazz clubs
grows long: the Blackhawk, El
Matador, Bop City, and the
like.
But signs of a coming revitali
zation are everywhere appa
rent. For instance, the Trident,
a charming establishment on
the beach in Sausalito, was a
jazz hot-spot during the '60s,
but the limited commercial po
tential of jazz eventually forced

it to close its doors to jazz acts
Trident's new policy
But recently the Trident an
nounced the resumption of
their jazz policy. At present the
club is only featuring local ta
lent, but it is possible that the
club may eventually begin
booking the big names that fre
quented the club in the '60s.
The risk of commercial failure
in the business is high. I recall
the New Varsity's attempt to
feature quality jazz four years
ago in Palo Alto. Pianist Bill
Evans — one of the living mas
ters of jazz — was brought in to
entertain a crowd of about 20
spectators. Needless to say, the
New Varsity's policy of present
ing live jazz was short-lived.
The jazz fan in the Peninsula
generally has to make a trip into
the City to find some real club
action. The trip is well worth
while. San Francisco boasts one
of the world's greatest jazz
clubs — the Keystone Korner.
This appelation causes an
immediate difficulty, for, as
purveyors of the club scene well
know, there are two other local
clubs which feature the word
"keystone" in their name.
On my first trip to this vener
able club — some four years ago
— I hooked up with a driver
who took me halfway to the
Keystone Berkeley before we
realized our error. The recent
addition of the Keystone Palo
Alto has not simplified matters
any.
Hidden away on Vallejo St.
This Keystone Korner, how
ever, is hidden away on Vallejo
St. in San Francisco. Fans of Ita
lian cuisine are advised to try
one of the local trattorias before
the show. The first set is
scheduled to begin at nine each
night, although I've never seen
one start before 10.
The management is intent on

selling the maximum number of
drinks possible before the
music starts, and on week
nights there is no reason for the
aware jazz fan to sit through an
hour of waiting before the
music starts. Enjoy your pasta
and show up about 9:30 on
weeknights, a little earlier on
weekends.
The Korner is run by Todd
Barkan, who has almost
single-handedly revitalized
jazz in the City. He brings in
both the big names and the de
serving unknowns, and what's
more, he pays musicians more
than perhaps any other club
owner in the country.
In addition, Barkan has often
opened up his club for free con
certs, often by name artists, and
jam sessions; even an occa
sional class or clinic takes place
under the Korner's roof.
Riches closer to home
Perhaps I am overlooking
riches closer to home. The jazz
series which has taken place on
campus at the Encina Station
this year has undoubtedly been
the most successful attempt at
bringing jazz into a club atmos
phere that the Peninsula has
seen.
The Station is not without its
problems, but the entertain
ment is top-quality, and the
five-minute walk it takes me to
reach Encina is much more
convenient (and more pleasant)
than an hour's ride into the
City.
The work done this year in
establishing the Station as a
center for club acts — work
done primarily by students
Steve Adamson, Brian Becker,
and Tim Moore — has been in
strumental in developing a jazz
audience at Stanford.
What the Statk>n does boast Is
the right atmosphere, and this
is the most difficult quality to

define. It's not saying that the
Station is a palace — in fact it's
much closer to a stable —but it
boasts the three qualities I look
for in a club — it's small, people
can sit close to the performers,
and — it's moderately inexpen
sive.
Looks like a crypt
Perhaps my favorite jazz club
is the Lighthouse in Los
Angeles, which ostensibly
looks like a crypt — perhaps
you can get a sense for my un
usual tastes.
The Lighthouse, which is lo
cated near the strand at Her
mosa Beach, contains long
wooden benches rather than
seats, and their appearance is
much closer to church pews
than anything else.
Only in this instance the
kneelers are replaced by a shelf
on which one props one's
drinks. The people in the front
row are obliged to use the stage
for a drink stand, and the per
formers (which over the years
have included Keith Jarrett,
Chuck Mangione, Cecil Taylor,
McCoy Tyner, Roland Kirk,
and the like) never seem to
mind.
But there is one thing more
important than how much the
jazz fan likes the club — most
important is how it appeals to
the musicians. Jazz is spon
taneous music, and only certain
conditions are conducive to its
presentation.
The great clubs — like the
Lighthouse, or the Keystone
Korner, or the Village Van
guard — are great because the
musicians enjoy playing there.
This is the one quality in my
definition of "atmosphere"
which defies further descrip
tion. But then again it might be
better for you to start discover
ing the clubs and find this part
out for yourself.

Jazz comes back — Jazz is making a comeback here in Palo Alto.
As the t-shirt indicates, popular sentiment is not unanimously
supportive of the new wave of Disco.
