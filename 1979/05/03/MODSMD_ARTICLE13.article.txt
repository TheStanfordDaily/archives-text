# Big Band, Swing break conventions again
## Nostalgia, curiosity spur revival of '40s style sounds, steps 
### Michele Schuchert 
Harold Whipple had been warned
about San Francisco: that it was an
off-beat town — a product of frenzied
extremism — where even bridges have
a peculiar allure. He had anticipated
some activity at 7 p.m. on a Friday at
the Hyatt Regency.
But never had he pictured himself
carting his briefcase-on-wheels
through a hotel lobby crowded with
festive drinkers and across a makeshift
dance floor jammed with jitterbug
gers. -
"What's going on here?" he asks a
woman at the registration desk.
"We call it 'Tea Dancing,' " she re
plies.
"Tea dancing?" Harold mutters. "I
don't hear any tea cups rattling — only
ice cubes."
Harold is perceptive
Harold is perceptive. Of the hun
dreds of jabbering "guests," not one is
sedately sipping tea. Instead, beer,
mixed cocktails and "Hyatt's Hot
Cider" are being served at portable
bars strategically stationed around the
expansive lobby. This crowd is de
monstrating one more way to thank
God it's Friday.

Area. The Hyatt appears to be rocking with the aftershocks

Two hours earlier, an earth tremor
had gently shaken the Bay Area. The
Hyatt appears to be rocking with the
aftershocks — dancers bobbing, spec
tators toe-tapping and rubber trees
trembling in universal syncopation.
Above all the pandemonium, a
geometric sculpture five stories tall
sways menacingly to the beat of a live,
20-piece band.
"Wait until they hear about this back
in Missouri," Harold exclaims. Nos
talgia beckons him. The band is play
ing a Benny Goodman tune — the
favorite of a girl he almost married
back in 1937. He can't resist. So he
sends his luggage to the room and
edges cautiously toward the stage.
Dodging flying arms and whirling
skirts, he seeks safety next to a cement
flower planter, within hearing dis
tance from other bystanders.
"Look at that guy," one neighbor
chuckles. "He's doing the twist. That
went out 15 years ago."
No dance step is out
Harold nods and pretends to agree.
Yet at the Hyatt Regency Tea Dancing,
no dance step is ever out. Here, as the
model of a car identifies its year, a
dancer's choice of steps identifies his
age.
And the older models are in the
limelight. Rejuvenated by a splash of
nostalgia, they swing agilely at a pace
they've never demonstrated when
crossing an intersection in front of
you.
Harold clears the path for a "classic"
couple about to tango around his
planter. Clad in a getup bearing no
resemblance to a polyester leisure suit,
the man dips his partner in a deep,
backward lunge.

His Greek fisherman's cap falls to
the ground, releasing locks of long,
white hair. The crowd marvels. All
eyes shift to his partner's silvery
shoes. Reminiscent of the'4os, though
currently a la mode, they shimmer
with each step.
"Did you see that?" a young ad
mirer asks her partner. Flabbergasted,
he can hardly reply. By his appear
ance, he's still making the transition
from flower child to disco dynamite.
And now, a new societal pressure to
deal with — ballroom dancing.
Ballroom dancing coming back
In the wake of disco fever and the
popularization of jazz, ballroom danc
ing is experiencing a comeback. Those
who learned to dance in the big band
era argue that disco steps are merely
adaptations of their predecessors.
And as for being revolutionary,
they're quick to remind you that they
were the original mavericks.
An article that appeared in the Neiv
York Times in 1938 supports theirclaim.
The article suggested that the swing
might be responsible for emotional
unbalance, sexual excess and even
rape.
It quoted a psychologist about the

"dangerously hypnotic influence of
swing" which purportedly had been
cunningly devised to play at a faster
tempo than 72 bars to the minute —
faster than the human pulse.
Exposure to swing, the psychologist
warned, meant that, "young people,
presumably unfamiliar with the ways
of the world . . . can reasonably be
expected to break down conventions,"
and this would "lead to moral weak
ness."
Whether it was magic or hysteria
that the big bands engendered, their
fans have not forgotten it. They flock
to clubs and ballrooms that feature the
sounds of Benny Goodman, Jimmy
and Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, Les
Brown, Glenn Miller, Count Basie,
Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford
and Bob Crosby, to name a few.
Goodman started it all
Music critics from that era will tell
you that it began with Benny Good
man. His was the band, they'll say,
which sparked the whole big band
craze in 1935; he was the first musician
to bridge the gap between bands and
the public. He and his clarinet created
a novel identity, providing an aura of
glamour and excitement that set the
mood and pace of American music for
12 years.
The sentimental music of the late
1920s and early '30s reflected the
gloomy forecasts of the Great Depres
sion. But by 1935, hope had returned
to the domestic climate. There it found
an ideal expression in a brand of sw
inging dance music that emphasized
rollicking rhythm sections, bristling
brass, aggressive saxes and jazz sol
oists.
Goodman's success paved the way

for others. The Dorsey brothers and
Duke Ellington gained followings.
Outstanding instrumentalists
emerged swinging in front of their
own bands — Artie Shaw, Bunny Be
rigan, Glenn Miller, Will Bradley,
Charlie Spivak, Jack Jenney and more.
From the creators of jazz came more
leaders — Jack Teagarden, Count
Basie, Charlie Barnet, Red Norvo and
others. Eventually, three Goodman
graduates would rise through the
ranks — Gene Krupa, Lionel
Hampton and Harry James.
World War II speeded the demise of
the dance band craze. Many musicians
entered the armed services. Those still
in civies played in service camps and
toured with USO units entertaining
the troops overseas.
Gas shortages
At home, gas shortages made travel
ing difficult for the bands, and almost
impossible for the dancers who
wanted to attend clubs outside city
limits. Other deterrents included a 20
percent amusement tax and a mid
night curfew.
As the war effort intensified, the
public's mood changed accordingly.
The women at home and the men
overseas or in camps, lonely and sen
timental, preferred to listen to the
singing of Frank Sinatra or Peggy Lee,
instead of the blaring horn of Henry
James or the pounding drums of Gene
Krupa.
The post-war world became a sing
er's world. The top bands that didn't
break up at least broke away from the
middle-of-the-road circuit. Progres
sive sounds began emanating from
bands such as Stan Kenton's, Boyd
Raeburn's, Dizzy Gillespie's and
Woody Herman's.
For more than nostalgia's sake, big
band fans crave the real thing and will
travel hundreds of miles to swing to
the music of Les Brown, Stan Kenton,
Tex Beneke, Freddie Martin and Harry
James.
Numerous ballroom establishments
in the Bay Area have the financial
means to hire these names; but none,
their fans will assure you, can rival the
romantic Santa Cruz Ballroom, also
known as the Coconut Grove.
Victorian splendor
Situated on the Santa Cruz
Boardwalk, overlooking the Pacific,
the 73-year-old casino/ballroom was
refurbished less than two years ago to
emulate the decor and atmosphere
particular to the Big Band Era. Victo
rian fixtures, red carpeting and bal
conies envelop a 7000 square foot
dance floor.
Once every month, 1250 people — a
capacity crowd — come from as far
away as Fresno and Stockton to attend
this pseudo-prom. Unlike most clubs,
however, promotion is not necessary.
A flyer distributed to the 4000 couples
on the mailing list sells enough tickets
at $7.50 per person to fill the ballroom.
The next dance on May 26 will fea
ture Tex Beneke. Free dance lessons
and a buffet precede the dancing
which begins at 9 p.m.
Big band dancing is gaining popu
larity, according to Beverly Pelton, the
entertainment director at the Coconut

Grove.
"People are on a nostalgia trip," she
contends. "They want to remember
because big band music was once a big
part of their lives. 1 even learned to
dance to it."
Young attendance growing
Though young people are in the
minority at the Santa Cruz Ballroom,
their attendance is growing month by
month. Peltonattributes it toa "curios
ity thing."
If every dance is a sellout, what's
stopping Pelton from scheduling
more? Geographical limitations,
primarily. The bulk of the would-be
dancers live in the Santa Clara Valley
and in cities farther north. Besides
that, it takes big money to attract big
names and at $15 per couple, profit
margins offer little incentive.
Pelton declined to discuss figures,
but doing your own guesswork, you
can envision the price tag on a 20-piece
band.
Smaller establishments sponsor
more modest affairs yet costs still pose
considerable limitations. Though the
Musician's Union is weak and
blackballing is common, the union has
established minimum rates.
A 20-piece union band with two
vocalists could charge $1300 to $2500
for a three-hour job in the Bay Area.
Obviously, if musicians desire a sub
stantial number of bookings, they
must quietly ignore union regulations.
Local favorites
The second problem is finding a
large ballroom with adequate acous
tics. Avid dancers favor two in this
area: The Little New Yorker in Santa
Clara is popular with the younger set
and welcomes minors. The Villa Felice
Restaurant in Los Gatos also features
big bands regularly.
Commercial bands rarely limit their
repertoires to nostalgia music, how
ever. To book engagements they must
adapt to the musical trends. Neverthe
less, some bands remain pure. To
compromise would be to become mic
key mouse — a term applied to bands
that "offend no one, except perhaps
musicians."
The rift between dance bands and
jazz bands reinforces the assertion that
not all big band enthusiasts are dan
cers; not all KMPX — Big Band 99 lis
teners are jitterbugging in their living
rooms. But those who are, KMPX aims
to get dancing outside of their homes.
Promoters have thought up imagina
tive schemes to spark nostalgia and
spur interest in swinging to the big
band tempo.
Last Sunday, for example, was
KMPX Family Day at the horse races.
While the horses were clodding the
turf at Bay Meadows, bettors were sw
inging to the Walt Tolleson Band.
Yes, the swing is back — perhaps
this time to stay. Dance steps once re
served for living room entertainment
are showing up in hotel lobbies and at
race tracks. Who knows where they'll
turn up next — perhaps in Harold
Whipple's home town.

If every dance is a sellout, what's

can envision the price tag on a 20-piece

A 20-piece union band with two

for a three-hour job in the Bay Area.
Obviously, if musicians desire a sub
stantial number of bookings, they
must quietly ignore union regulations.
Local favorites
The second problem is finding a

Commercial bands rarely limit their
repertoires to nostalgia music, how

The rift between dance bands and

not all big band enthusiasts are dan
cers; not all KMPX — Big Band 99 lis
teners are jitterbugging in their living
rooms. But those who are, KMPX aims
to get dancing outside of their homes.
Promoters have thought up imagina
tive schemes to spark nostalgia and
spur interest in swinging to the big
band tempo.
Last Sunday, for example, was
KMPX Family Day at the horse races.
While the horses were clodding the
turf at Bay Meadows, bettors were sw
inging to the Walt Tolleson Band.
Yes, the swing is back — perhaps
this time to stay. Dance steps once re
served for living room entertainment
are showing up in hotel lobbies and at
race tracks. Who knows where they'll
turn up next — perhaps in Harold
Whipple's home town.
Harold Whipple had been warned
about San Francisco: that it was an
off-beat town — a product of frenzied
extremism — where even bridges have
a peculiar allure. He had anticipated
some activity at 7 p.m. on a Friday at
the Hyatt Regency.
But never had he pictured himself
carting his briefcase-on-wheels
through a hotel lobby crowded with
festive drinkers and across a makeshift
dance floor jammed with jitterbug
gers. -
"What's going on here?" he asks a
woman at the registration desk.
"We call it 'Tea Dancing,' " she re
plies.
"Tea dancing?" Harold mutters. "I
don't hear any tea cups rattling — only
ice cubes."
Harold is perceptive
Harold is perceptive. Of the hun
dreds of jabbering "guests," not one is
sedately sipping tea. Instead, beer,
mixed cocktails and "Hyatt's Hot
Cider" are being served at portable
bars strategically stationed around the
expansive lobby. This crowd is de
monstrating one more way to thank
God it's Friday.

Two hours earlier, an earth tremor
had gently shaken the Bay Area. The
Hyatt appears to be rocking with the
aftershocks — dancers bobbing, spec
tators toe-tapping and rubber trees
trembling in universal syncopation.
Above all the pandemonium, a
geometric sculpture five stories tall
sways menacingly to the beat of a live,
20-piece band.
"Wait until they hear about this back
in Missouri," Harold exclaims. Nos
talgia beckons him. The band is play
ing a Benny Goodman tune — the
favorite of a girl he almost married
back in 1937. He can't resist. So he
sends his luggage to the room and
edges cautiously toward the stage.
Dodging flying arms and whirling
skirts, he seeks safety next to a cement
flower planter, within hearing dis
tance from other bystanders.
"Look at that guy," one neighbor
chuckles. "He's doing the twist. That
went out 15 years ago."
No dance step is out
Harold nods and pretends to agree.
Yet at the Hyatt Regency Tea Dancing,
no dance step is ever out. Here, as the
model of a car identifies its year, a
dancer's choice of steps identifies his
age.
And the older models are in the
limelight. Rejuvenated by a splash of
nostalgia, they swing agilely at a pace
they've never demonstrated when
crossing an intersection in front of
you.
Harold clears the path for a "classic"
couple about to tango around his
planter. Clad in a getup bearing no
resemblance to a polyester leisure suit,
the man dips his partner in a deep,
backward lunge.

His Greek fisherman's cap falls to
the ground, releasing locks of long,
white hair. The crowd marvels. All
eyes shift to his partner's silvery
shoes. Reminiscent of the'4os, though
currently a la mode, they shimmer
with each step.
"Did you see that?" a young ad
mirer asks her partner. Flabbergasted,
he can hardly reply. By his appear
ance, he's still making the transition
from flower child to disco dynamite.
And now, a new societal pressure to
deal with — ballroom dancing.
Ballroom dancing coming back
In the wake of disco fever and the
popularization of jazz, ballroom danc
ing is experiencing a comeback. Those
who learned to dance in the big band
era argue that disco steps are merely
adaptations of their predecessors.
And as for being revolutionary,
they're quick to remind you that they
were the original mavericks.
An article that appeared in the Neiv
York Times in 1938 supports theirclaim.
The article suggested that the swing
might be responsible for emotional
unbalance, sexual excess and even
rape.
It quoted a psychologist about the

"dangerously hypnotic influence of
swing" which purportedly had been
cunningly devised to play at a faster
tempo than 72 bars to the minute —
faster than the human pulse.
Exposure to swing, the psychologist
warned, meant that, "young people,
presumably unfamiliar with the ways
of the world . . . can reasonably be
expected to break down conventions,"
and this would "lead to moral weak
ness."
Whether it was magic or hysteria
that the big bands engendered, their
fans have not forgotten it. They flock
to clubs and ballrooms that feature the
sounds of Benny Goodman, Jimmy
and Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, Les
Brown, Glenn Miller, Count Basie,
Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford
and Bob Crosby, to name a few.
Goodman started it all
Music critics from that era will tell
you that it began with Benny Good
man. His was the band, they'll say,
which sparked the whole big band
craze in 1935; he was the first musician
to bridge the gap between bands and
the public. He and his clarinet created
a novel identity, providing an aura of
glamour and excitement that set the
mood and pace of American music for
12 years.
The sentimental music of the late
1920s and early '30s reflected the
gloomy forecasts of the Great Depres
sion. But by 1935, hope had returned
to the domestic climate. There it found
an ideal expression in a brand of sw
inging dance music that emphasized
rollicking rhythm sections, bristling
brass, aggressive saxes and jazz sol
oists.
Goodman's success paved the way

for others. The Dorsey brothers and
Duke Ellington gained followings.
Outstanding instrumentalists
emerged swinging in front of their
own bands — Artie Shaw, Bunny Be
rigan, Glenn Miller, Will Bradley,
Charlie Spivak, Jack Jenney and more.
From the creators of jazz came more
leaders — Jack Teagarden, Count
Basie, Charlie Barnet, Red Norvo and
others. Eventually, three Goodman
graduates would rise through the
ranks — Gene Krupa, Lionel
Hampton and Harry James.
World War II speeded the demise of
the dance band craze. Many musicians
entered the armed services. Those still
in civies played in service camps and
toured with USO units entertaining
the troops overseas.
Gas shortages
At home, gas shortages made travel
ing difficult for the bands, and almost
impossible for the dancers who
wanted to attend clubs outside city
limits. Other deterrents included a 20
percent amusement tax and a mid
night curfew.
As the war effort intensified, the
public's mood changed accordingly.
The women at home and the men
overseas or in camps, lonely and sen
timental, preferred to listen to the
singing of Frank Sinatra or Peggy Lee,
instead of the blaring horn of Henry
James or the pounding drums of Gene
Krupa.
The post-war world became a sing
er's world. The top bands that didn't
break up at least broke away from the
middle-of-the-road circuit. Progres
sive sounds began emanating from
bands such as Stan Kenton's, Boyd
Raeburn's, Dizzy Gillespie's and
Woody Herman's.
For more than nostalgia's sake, big
band fans crave the real thing and will
travel hundreds of miles to swing to
the music of Les Brown, Stan Kenton,
Tex Beneke, Freddie Martin and Harry
James.
Numerous ballroom establishments
in the Bay Area have the financial
means to hire these names; but none,
their fans will assure you, can rival the
romantic Santa Cruz Ballroom, also
known as the Coconut Grove.
Victorian splendor
Situated on the Santa Cruz
Boardwalk, overlooking the Pacific,
the 73-year-old casino/ballroom was
refurbished less than two years ago to
emulate the decor and atmosphere
particular to the Big Band Era. Victo
rian fixtures, red carpeting and bal
conies envelop a 7000 square foot
dance floor.
Once every month, 1250 people — a
capacity crowd — come from as far
away as Fresno and Stockton to attend
this pseudo-prom. Unlike most clubs,
however, promotion is not necessary.
A flyer distributed to the 4000 couples
on the mailing list sells enough tickets
at $7.50 per person to fill the ballroom.
The next dance on May 26 will fea
ture Tex Beneke. Free dance lessons
and a buffet precede the dancing
which begins at 9 p.m.
Big band dancing is gaining popu
larity, according to Beverly Pelton, the
entertainment director at the Coconut

Grove.
"People are on a nostalgia trip," she
contends. "They want to remember
because big band music was once a big
part of their lives. 1 even learned to
dance to it."

The women at home and the men
overseas or in camps, lonely and sen
timental, preferred to listen to the
singing of Frank Sinatra or Peggy Lee,
instead of the blaring horn of Henry
James or the pounding drums of Gene
Krupa.
The post-war world became a sing
er's world. The top bands that didn't
break up at least broke away from the
middle-of-the-road circuit. Progres
sive sounds began emanating from
bands such as Stan Kenton's, Boyd
Raeburn's, Dizzy Gillespie's and
Woody Herman's.
For more than nostalgia's sake, big
band fans crave the real thing and will
travel hundreds of miles to swing to
the music of Les Brown, Stan Kenton,
Tex Beneke, Freddie Martin and Harry
James.
Numerous ballroom establishments
in the Bay Area have the financial
means to hire these names; but none,
their fans will assure you, can rival the
romantic Santa Cruz Ballroom, also
known as the Coconut Grove.
Victorian splendor
Situated on the Santa Cruz
Boardwalk, overlooking the Pacific,
the 73-year-old casino/ballroom was
refurbished less than two years ago to
emulate the decor and atmosphere
particular to the Big Band Era. Victo
rian fixtures, red carpeting and bal
conies envelop a 7000 square foot
dance floor.
Once every month, 1250 people — a
capacity crowd — come from as far
away as Fresno and Stockton to attend
this pseudo-prom. Unlike most clubs,
however, promotion is not necessary.
A flyer distributed to the 4000 couples
on the mailing list sells enough tickets
at $7.50 per person to fill the ballroom.
The next dance on May 26 will fea
ture Tex Beneke. Free dance lessons
and a buffet precede the dancing
which begins at 9 p.m.
Big band dancing is gaining popu
larity, according to Beverly Pelton, the
entertainment director at the Coconut

Grove.
"People are on a nostalgia trip," she
contends. "They want to remember
because big band music was once a big
part of their lives. 1 even learned to
dance to it."
Young attendance growing
Though young people are in the
minority at the Santa Cruz Ballroom,
their attendance is growing month by
month. Peltonattributes it toa "curios
ity thing."
If every dance is a sellout, what's
stopping Pelton from scheduling
more? Geographical limitations,
primarily. The bulk of the would-be
dancers live in the Santa Clara Valley
and in cities farther north. Besides
that, it takes big money to attract big
names and at $15 per couple, profit
margins offer little incentive.
Pelton declined to discuss figures,
but doing your own guesswork, you
can envision the price tag on a 20-piece
band.
Smaller establishments sponsor
more modest affairs yet costs still pose
considerable limitations. Though the
Musician's Union is weak and
blackballing is common, the union has
established minimum rates.
A 20-piece union band with two
vocalists could charge $1300 to $2500
for a three-hour job in the Bay Area.
Obviously, if musicians desire a sub
stantial number of bookings, they
must quietly ignore union regulations.
Local favorites
The second problem is finding a
large ballroom with adequate acous
tics. Avid dancers favor two in this
area: The Little New Yorker in Santa
Clara is popular with the younger set
and welcomes minors. The Villa Felice
Restaurant in Los Gatos also features
big bands regularly.
Commercial bands rarely limit their
repertoires to nostalgia music, how
ever. To book engagements they must
adapt to the musical trends. Neverthe
less, some bands remain pure. To
compromise would be to become mic
key mouse — a term applied to bands
that "offend no one, except perhaps
musicians."
The rift between dance bands and
jazz bands reinforces the assertion that
not all big band enthusiasts are dan
cers; not all KMPX — Big Band 99 lis
teners are jitterbugging in their living
rooms. But those who are, KMPX aims
to get dancing outside of their homes.
Promoters have thought up imagina
tive schemes to spark nostalgia and
spur interest in swinging to the big
band tempo.
Last Sunday, for example, was
KMPX Family Day at the horse races.
While the horses were clodding the
turf at Bay Meadows, bettors were sw
inging to the Walt Tolleson Band.
Yes, the swing is back — perhaps
this time to stay. Dance steps once re
served for living room entertainment
are showing up in hotel lobbies and at
race tracks. Who knows where they'll
turn up next — perhaps in Harold
Whipple's home town.
Harold Whipple had been warned
about San Francisco: that it was an
off-beat town — a product of frenzied
extremism — where even bridges have
a peculiar allure. He had anticipated
some activity at 7 p.m. on a Friday at
the Hyatt Regency.
But never had he pictured himself
carting his briefcase-on-wheels
through a hotel lobby crowded with
festive drinkers and across a makeshift
dance floor jammed with jitterbug
gers. -
"What's going on here?" he asks a
woman at the registration desk.
"We call it 'Tea Dancing,' " she re
plies.
"Tea dancing?" Harold mutters. "I
don't hear any tea cups rattling — only
ice cubes."
Harold is perceptive
Harold is perceptive. Of the hun
dreds of jabbering "guests," not one is
sedately sipping tea. Instead, beer,
mixed cocktails and "Hyatt's Hot
Cider" are being served at portable
bars strategically stationed around the
expansive lobby. This crowd is de
monstrating one more way to thank
God it's Friday.

Two hours earlier, an earth tremor
had gently shaken the Bay Area. The
Hyatt appears to be rocking with the
aftershocks — dancers bobbing, spec
tators toe-tapping and rubber trees
trembling in universal syncopation.
Above all the pandemonium, a
geometric sculpture five stories tall
sways menacingly to the beat of a live,
20-piece band.
"Wait until they hear about this back
in Missouri," Harold exclaims. Nos
talgia beckons him. The band is play
ing a Benny Goodman tune — the
favorite of a girl he almost married
back in 1937. He can't resist. So he
sends his luggage to the room and
edges cautiously toward the stage.
Dodging flying arms and whirling
skirts, he seeks safety next to a cement
flower planter, within hearing dis
tance from other bystanders.
"Look at that guy," one neighbor
chuckles. "He's doing the twist. That
went out 15 years ago."
No dance step is out
Harold nods and pretends to agree.
Yet at the Hyatt Regency Tea Dancing,
no dance step is ever out. Here, as the
model of a car identifies its year, a
dancer's choice of steps identifies his
age.
And the older models are in the
limelight. Rejuvenated by a splash of
nostalgia, they swing agilely at a pace
they've never demonstrated when
crossing an intersection in front of
you.
Harold clears the path for a "classic"
couple about to tango around his
planter. Clad in a getup bearing no
resemblance to a polyester leisure suit,
the man dips his partner in a deep,
backward lunge.

His Greek fisherman's cap falls to
the ground, releasing locks of long,
white hair. The crowd marvels. All
eyes shift to his partner's silvery
shoes. Reminiscent of the'4os, though
currently a la mode, they shimmer
with each step.
"Did you see that?" a young ad
mirer asks her partner. Flabbergasted,
he can hardly reply. By his appear
ance, he's still making the transition
from flower child to disco dynamite.
And now, a new societal pressure to
deal with — ballroom dancing.
Ballroom dancing coming back
In the wake of disco fever and the
popularization of jazz, ballroom danc
ing is experiencing a comeback. Those
who learned to dance in the big band
era argue that disco steps are merely
adaptations of their predecessors.
And as for being revolutionary,
they're quick to remind you that they
were the original mavericks.
An article that appeared in the Neiv
York Times in 1938 supports theirclaim.
The article suggested that the swing
might be responsible for emotional
unbalance, sexual excess and even
rape.
It quoted a psychologist about the

"dangerously hypnotic influence of
swing" which purportedly had been
cunningly devised to play at a faster
tempo than 72 bars to the minute —
faster than the human pulse.
Exposure to swing, the psychologist
warned, meant that, "young people,
presumably unfamiliar with the ways
of the world . . . can reasonably be
expected to break down conventions,"
and this would "lead to moral weak
ness."
Whether it was magic or hysteria
that the big bands engendered, their
fans have not forgotten it. They flock
to clubs and ballrooms that feature the
sounds of Benny Goodman, Jimmy
and Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, Les
Brown, Glenn Miller, Count Basie,
Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford
and Bob Crosby, to name a few.
Goodman started it all
Music critics from that era will tell
you that it began with Benny Good
man. His was the band, they'll say,
which sparked the whole big band
craze in 1935; he was the first musician
to bridge the gap between bands and
the public. He and his clarinet created
a novel identity, providing an aura of
glamour and excitement that set the
mood and pace of American music for
12 years.
The sentimental music of the late
1920s and early '30s reflected the
gloomy forecasts of the Great Depres
sion. But by 1935, hope had returned
to the domestic climate. There it found
an ideal expression in a brand of sw
inging dance music that emphasized
rollicking rhythm sections, bristling
brass, aggressive saxes and jazz sol
oists.
Goodman's success paved the way

for others. The Dorsey brothers and
Duke Ellington gained followings.
Outstanding instrumentalists
emerged swinging in front of their
own bands — Artie Shaw, Bunny Be
rigan, Glenn Miller, Will Bradley,
Charlie Spivak, Jack Jenney and more.
From the creators of jazz came more
leaders — Jack Teagarden, Count
Basie, Charlie Barnet, Red Norvo and
others. Eventually, three Goodman
graduates would rise through the
ranks — Gene Krupa, Lionel
Hampton and Harry James.
World War II speeded the demise of
the dance band craze. Many musicians
entered the armed services. Those still
in civies played in service camps and
toured with USO units entertaining
the troops overseas.
Gas shortages
At home, gas shortages made travel
ing difficult for the bands, and almost
impossible for the dancers who
wanted to attend clubs outside city
limits. Other deterrents included a 20
percent amusement tax and a mid
night curfew.
As the war effort intensified, the
public's mood changed accordingly.
The women at home and the men
overseas or in camps, lonely and sen
timental, preferred to listen to the
singing of Frank Sinatra or Peggy Lee,

of the world . . . can reasonably be
expected to break down conventions,"
and this would "lead to moral weak
ness."
Whether it was magic or hysteria
that the big bands engendered, their
fans have not forgotten it. They flock
to clubs and ballrooms that feature the
sounds of Benny Goodman, Jimmy
and Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, Les
Brown, Glenn Miller, Count Basie,
Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford
and Bob Crosby, to name a few.
Goodman started it all
Music critics from that era will tell
you that it began with Benny Good
man. His was the band, they'll say,
which sparked the whole big band
craze in 1935; he was the first musician
to bridge the gap between bands and
the public. He and his clarinet created
a novel identity, providing an aura of
glamour and excitement that set the
mood and pace of American music for
12 years.
The sentimental music of the late
1920s and early '30s reflected the
gloomy forecasts of the Great Depres
sion. But by 1935, hope had returned
to the domestic climate. There it found
an ideal expression in a brand of sw
inging dance music that emphasized
rollicking rhythm sections, bristling
brass, aggressive saxes and jazz sol
oists.
Goodman's success paved the way

for others. The Dorsey brothers and
Duke Ellington gained followings.
Outstanding instrumentalists
emerged swinging in front of their
own bands — Artie Shaw, Bunny Be
rigan, Glenn Miller, Will Bradley,
Charlie Spivak, Jack Jenney and more.
From the creators of jazz came more
leaders — Jack Teagarden, Count
Basie, Charlie Barnet, Red Norvo and
others. Eventually, three Goodman
graduates would rise through the
ranks — Gene Krupa, Lionel
Hampton and Harry James.
World War II speeded the demise of
the dance band craze. Many musicians
entered the armed services. Those still
in civies played in service camps and
toured with USO units entertaining
the troops overseas.
Gas shortages
At home, gas shortages made travel
ing difficult for the bands, and almost
impossible for the dancers who
wanted to attend clubs outside city
limits. Other deterrents included a 20
percent amusement tax and a mid
night curfew.
As the war effort intensified, the
public's mood changed accordingly.
The women at home and the men
overseas or in camps, lonely and sen
timental, preferred to listen to the
singing of Frank Sinatra or Peggy Lee,
instead of the blaring horn of Henry
James or the pounding drums of Gene
Krupa.
The post-war world became a sing
er's world. The top bands that didn't
break up at least broke away from the
middle-of-the-road circuit. Progres
sive sounds began emanating from
bands such as Stan Kenton's, Boyd
Raeburn's, Dizzy Gillespie's and
Woody Herman's.
For more than nostalgia's sake, big
band fans crave the real thing and will
travel hundreds of miles to swing to
the music of Les Brown, Stan Kenton,
Tex Beneke, Freddie Martin and Harry
James.
Numerous ballroom establishments
in the Bay Area have the financial
means to hire these names; but none,
their fans will assure you, can rival the
romantic Santa Cruz Ballroom, also
known as the Coconut Grove.
Victorian splendor
Situated on the Santa Cruz
Boardwalk, overlooking the Pacific,
the 73-year-old casino/ballroom was
refurbished less than two years ago to
emulate the decor and atmosphere
particular to the Big Band Era. Victo
rian fixtures, red carpeting and bal
conies envelop a 7000 square foot
dance floor.
Once every month, 1250 people — a
capacity crowd — come from as far
away as Fresno and Stockton to attend
this pseudo-prom. Unlike most clubs,
however, promotion is not necessary.
A flyer distributed to the 4000 couples
on the mailing list sells enough tickets
at $7.50 per person to fill the ballroom.
The next dance on May 26 will fea
ture Tex Beneke. Free dance lessons
and a buffet precede the dancing
which begins at 9 p.m.
Big band dancing is gaining popu
larity, according to Beverly Pelton, the
entertainment director at the Coconut

Grove.
"People are on a nostalgia trip," she
contends. "They want to remember
because big band music was once a big
part of their lives. 1 even learned to
dance to it."
Young attendance growing
Though young people are in the
minority at the Santa Cruz Ballroom,
their attendance is growing month by
month. Peltonattributes it toa "curios
ity thing."
If every dance is a sellout, what's
stopping Pelton from scheduling
more? Geographical limitations,
primarily. The bulk of the would-be
dancers live in the Santa Clara Valley
and in cities farther north. Besides
that, it takes big money to attract big
names and at $15 per couple, profit
margins offer little incentive.
Pelton declined to discuss figures,
but doing your own guesswork, you
can envision the price tag on a 20-piece
band.
Smaller establishments sponsor
more modest affairs yet costs still pose
considerable limitations. Though the
Musician's Union is weak and
blackballing is common, the union has
established minimum rates.
A 20-piece union band with two
vocalists could charge $1300 to $2500
for a three-hour job in the Bay Area.
Obviously, if musicians desire a sub
stantial number of bookings, they
must quietly ignore union regulations.
Local favorites
The second problem is finding a
large ballroom with adequate acous
tics. Avid dancers favor two in this
area: The Little New Yorker in Santa
Clara is popular with the younger set
and welcomes minors. The Villa Felice
Restaurant in Los Gatos also features
big bands regularly.
Commercial bands rarely limit their
repertoires to nostalgia music, how
ever. To book engagements they must
adapt to the musical trends. Neverthe
less, some bands remain pure. To
compromise would be to become mic
key mouse — a term applied to bands
that "offend no one, except perhaps
musicians."
The rift between dance bands and
jazz bands reinforces the assertion that
not all big band enthusiasts are dan
cers; not all KMPX — Big Band 99 lis
teners are jitterbugging in their living
rooms. But those who are, KMPX aims
to get dancing outside of their homes.
Promoters have thought up imagina
tive schemes to spark nostalgia and
spur interest in swinging to the big
band tempo.
Last Sunday, for example, was
KMPX Family Day at the horse races.
While the horses were clodding the
turf at Bay Meadows, bettors were sw
inging to the Walt Tolleson Band.
Yes, the swing is back — perhaps
this time to stay. Dance steps once re
served for living room entertainment
are showing up in hotel lobbies and at
race tracks. Who knows where they'll
turn up next — perhaps in Harold
Whipple's home town.
