# Stanford parties and alcohol-dependence?
## Booze-boon, bane or bust?

The music was loud. The
lights were low. Well-dressed
couples danced and clapped
wildly in the crowded dormit
ory hallway. A 20-gallon, green
plastic barrel held the evening's
liquid refreshment. Promi
nently displayed on a shelf
above the barrel were two
empty half-gallon bottles of
vodka.
The evening wore on, and
glass after glass was refilled
from the green barrel. The par
tying became louder, more
frenzied and more reckless.
Students who were normally
shy became gregarious conver

sationalists, and those who had
drunk the most punch stum
bled around with glazed eyes.
There was no vodka in the
punch, however. The organiz
ers of the party had put the two
empty bottles near the punch so
that people would believe that
it contained alcohol. Their con
tention that students here are
more comfortable in a social
situation with alcoholic bever
ages available held true.
Alcohol is an integral part of
the social scene here. Off cam
pus, Zot's, the "O," Beltramo's
and the Frog Pond are frequent
destinations. On campus, very
few parties are a success with

out at least a keg.
Mega-nooners, sherry hours,
fraternity parties, and even
dormitory study breaks provide
the average Stanford student
with numerous opportunities
to test his social skills while
under the influence of alcohol.
"I don't think I've been to a
major party on the Stanford
campus that hasn't had al
cohol," Sue Threlkeld, a Stan
ford junior, said. "Some parties
might work without alcohol,
but I just don't think they
would be as successful."
Expenditures on alcohol are
second only to those on bands
at most University residences.

Alcohol purchases constitute
an average of 35 to 45 percent of
the total social funds spent each
quarter in University resi
dences.
For example, Trancos, an all
freshman dormitory, spent
$550 on alcoholic beverages fall
quarter. Roble Hall spent $850
on alcohol. This figure does not
include individual corridor
fund allotments, which also in
volved alcohol purchases. Delta
Tau Delta fraternity spent $1000
on alcohol, while Theta Delta
Chi spent $1850 of its social
budget on alcoholic beverages.
Alcohol is definitely the
center of all social activities in
fraternities, according to Jim
Butler, a member of Theta Delta
Chi.
"It's not that you are forced to
drink, but it is always available
if you feel like drinking," Butler
said.
The moderate use of alcohol
is not inconsistent with the
goals and aims of education
here, according to Mike Bever,
director of the row houses.
In the last two to three years,
however, there have been more

and more abuses of alcohol at
Stanford, as well as on other
campuses, Bever said.
"There used to be a polarity
between beer people and dope
people, but in the last few
years, beer people have won
out," Bever said.
"Today it is more of a sport
where excessive drinking is
funny. I view that with alarm."
Because of the technical and
legal implications involved
when people under 21 drink on
Stanford property, the Univer
sity accepts a lot of responsibil
ity for students' behavior,
Bever said.
He did not necessarily favor
stricter University regulation of
alcohol consumption, how
ever. The University has a tradi
tion of giving people the free
dom to make their own choices,
which is constructive educa
tionally, Bever said.
"We can and are working to
make people more aware of the
dangers of alcohol," Bever said.
"We really stress that if you do
something social, you should
have non-alcoholic alterna
tives."

out," Bever said.
"Today it is more of a sport
where excessive drinking is
funny. I view that with alarm."
Because of the technical and
legal implications involved
when people under 21 drink on
Stanford property, the Univer
sity accepts a lot of responsibil
ity for students' behavior,
Bever said.
He did not necessarily favor
stricter University regulation of
alcohol consumption, how
ever. The University has a tradi
tion of giving people the free
dom to make their own choices,
which is constructive educa
tionally, Bever said.
"We can and are working to
make people more aware of the
dangers of alcohol," Bever said.
"We really stress that if you do
something social, you should
have non-alcoholic alterna
tives."

I mix em, you drink em — As these Branner freshmen demonstrate,
alcohol is quite prevalent at campus parties. While some doubt its
necessity, others affirm it and will spend thousands of dollars in social
dues to provide it.
The music was loud. The
lights were low. Well-dressed
couples danced and clapped
wildly in the crowded dormit
ory hallway. A 20-gallon, green
plastic barrel held the evening's
liquid refreshment. Promi
nently displayed on a shelf
above the barrel were two
empty half-gallon bottles of
vodka.
The evening wore on, and
glass after glass was refilled
from the green barrel. The par
tying became louder, more
frenzied and more reckless.
Students who were normally
shy became gregarious conver

sationalists, and those who had
drunk the most punch stum
bled around with glazed eyes.
There was no vodka in the
punch, however. The organiz
ers of the party had put the two
empty bottles near the punch so
that people would believe that
it contained alcohol. Their con
tention that students here are
more comfortable in a social
situation with alcoholic bever
ages available held true.
Alcohol is an integral part of
the social scene here. Off cam
pus, Zot's, the "O," Beltramo's
and the Frog Pond are frequent
destinations. On campus, very
few parties are a success with

out at least a keg.
Mega-nooners, sherry hours,
fraternity parties, and even
dormitory study breaks provide
the average Stanford student
with numerous opportunities
to test his social skills while
under the influence of alcohol.
"I don't think I've been to a
major party on the Stanford
campus that hasn't had al
cohol," Sue Threlkeld, a Stan
ford junior, said. "Some parties
might work without alcohol,
but I just don't think they
would be as successful."
Expenditures on alcohol are
second only to those on bands
at most University residences.

Alcohol purchases constitute
an average of 35 to 45 percent of
the total social funds spent each
quarter in University resi
dences.
For example, Trancos, an all
freshman dormitory, spent
$550 on alcoholic beverages fall
quarter. Roble Hall spent $850
on alcohol. This figure does not
include individual corridor
fund allotments, which also in
volved alcohol purchases. Delta
Tau Delta fraternity spent $1000
on alcohol, while Theta Delta
Chi spent $1850 of its social
budget on alcoholic beverages.
Alcohol is definitely the
center of all social activities in
fraternities, according to Jim
Butler, a member of Theta Delta
Chi.
"It's not that you are forced to
drink, but it is always available
if you feel like drinking," Butler
said.
The moderate use of alcohol
is not inconsistent with the
goals and aims of education
here, according to Mike Bever,
director of the row houses.
In the last two to three years,
however, there have been more

and more abuses of alcohol at
Stanford, as well as on other
campuses, Bever said.
"There used to be a polarity
between beer people and dope
people, but in the last few
years, beer people have won
out," Bever said.
"Today it is more of a sport
where excessive drinking is
funny. I view that with alarm."

legal implications involved

Stanford property, the Univer
sity accepts a lot of responsibil
ity for students' behavior,
