# Alcohol abuse — a choice?
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, staff psychiatrist at
Houston House, is a man in favor of choices,
as long as those choices are made rationally.
On an April afternoon he is attired in tan
summer slacks and a baby blue shirt, accented
with a heavy wool plaid sports jacket. Ra
tional. is cool on spring mornings and eve
nenings, and warm in the afternoons.
D'Andrea is particularly interested in help
ing students make rational choices, especially
where drugs and alcohol are concerned.
"I have extended an interest in drug prob
lems from the early to mid '605," D'Andrea
said. "So when people see somebody with a
drug problem, they refer them to me."
D'Andrea classifies alcoholism as a drug
problem and a disease.
"It (alcoholism) has all the criteria of a dis
ease," he said.
Like all other diseases, he said, alcoholism
has a causative agent, a predictable course,
produce's consistent psychological and phys
ical changes and has uniform cross-cultural
effects.
In order to increase student awareness of
the effects of alcohol here D'Andrea and the
office of Residential Education hope to initiate
an educational program on the use of alcohol
this fall.
Such a program is not aimed at the prohibi
tion of alcohol on campus, merely to increase
rational alcohol use, he said.
A wine connoisseur who has made his own
wine for years, D'Andrea drinks a glass of
wine each evening. But he does not consider
himself a heavy drinker.
"I treat the wine I make with great respect,"
he said.
But even experienced drinkers need to be
cautious, he warns, citing a poster he had seen
for a fraternity Laker, boasting the presence of
25 kegs of beer.
"It's sort of along the lines of the way things
are done at Stanford," he said. "My personal
observation is it's too much. Everyone knows
that with 25 kegs somebody's going to get sick
or hurt.
"Stanford's point of view is that every
body's free to make choices," he continued.
"Assuming there is a sense of responsibility in
the fraternities and that they offer alternate
beverages, food and some policing of who
gets into cars, whether they are drunk or not,
it comes down to making choices."
D'Andrea favors a stiffening of University
policy through which alcohol consumption on
campus is limited and monitored, with 25 per
cent of beverages available non-alcoholic.

"If you make the environment safe enough
for people to experiment safely, then that's a
responsible policy," D'Andrea said.
"The Stanford attitude is from moment to
moment, and that makes regulation tougher,"
D'Andrea said. "We need to pay more atten
tion to our environment; if it's accepted, we
can monitor alcohol consumption."
According to D'Andrea, 90 percent of the
students on a suburban campus like Stanford
drink. Of those, 40 percent consume three to
four drinks per week, 45 percent imbibe bet
ween four and 20 drinks per week, and five
percent take more than 20 drinks per week.
Half the student body have been drunk in
the past month, he claimed, and 15 to 16 per
cent of those had suffered injuries or partici
pated in abusive behavior while drunk.
Although D'Andrea did not specify a drink
ing limit, he said a problem drinker is "some
one who becomes tolerant to the effects of
alcohol and increases consumption to get the
same effect —a good buzz."
"Anyone who consumes 21 drinks a week is
sure to become tolerant within a month,"
D'Andrea said. "People who can hold a lot are
in trouble because it means they are develop
ing an alcohol tolerance. There's nothing
prideful, manly or sophisticated about it."
Once an individual has reached a high to
lerance level, he is faced with a choice. He can
usually stop on his own, but then the problem
becomes what to do with all the time he had
spent drinking.
D'Andrea said that in this situation people
use alcohol as a crutch to deal with something
really important to them.
"Either they're not aware of something
they're avoiding, or they're very aware,"
D'Andrea said. "But instead of thinking,
they're drinking."
Escapism is a common reason for using al
cohol, marijuana or other drugs, he said.
But most people who use both alcohol and
marijuana use them separately, according to
D'Andrea. He said the legalization of
marijuana "would increase the hazard for
some, but by and large it wouldn't change
things much."
Leaning back in his easy chair, his folded
hands resting on a slightly protruding
stomach, D'Andrea looks hard through his
thick round glasses.
"Kids are nondiscriminate in what they
do," he said. "A few swigs of vodka, a couple
of joints, some uppers, some downers . . .
People need to find out how much they can
hold, but it ain't much."

the fraternities and that they offer alternate
beverages, food and some policing of who
gets into cars, whether they are drunk or not,
it comes down to making choices."
D'Andrea favors a stiffening of University
policy through which alcohol consumption on
campus is limited and monitored, with 25 per
cent of beverages available non-alcoholic.

"If you make the environment safe enough
for people to experiment safely, then that's a
responsible policy," D'Andrea said.
"The Stanford attitude is from moment to
moment, and that makes regulation tougher,"
D'Andrea said. "We need to pay more atten
tion to our environment; if it's accepted, we
can monitor alcohol consumption."
According to D'Andrea, 90 percent of the
students on a suburban campus like Stanford
drink. Of those, 40 percent consume three to
four drinks per week, 45 percent imbibe bet
ween four and 20 drinks per week, and five
percent take more than 20 drinks per week.
Half the student body have been drunk in
the past month, he claimed, and 15 to 16 per
cent of those had suffered injuries or partici
pated in abusive behavior while drunk.
Although D'Andrea did not specify a drink
ing limit, he said a problem drinker is "some
one who becomes tolerant to the effects of
alcohol and increases consumption to get the
same effect —a good buzz."
"Anyone who consumes 21 drinks a week is
sure to become tolerant within a month,"
D'Andrea said. "People who can hold a lot are
in trouble because it means they are develop
ing an alcohol tolerance. There's nothing
prideful, manly or sophisticated about it."
Once an individual has reached a high to
lerance level, he is faced with a choice. He can
usually stop on his own, but then the problem
becomes what to do with all the time he had
spent drinking.
D'Andrea said that in this situation people
use alcohol as a crutch to deal with something
really important to them.
"Either they're not aware of something
they're avoiding, or they're very aware,"
D'Andrea said. "But instead of thinking,
they're drinking."
Escapism is a common reason for using al
cohol, marijuana or other drugs, he said.
But most people who use both alcohol and
marijuana use them separately, according to
D'Andrea. He said the legalization of
marijuana "would increase the hazard for
some, but by and large it wouldn't change
things much."
Leaning back in his easy chair, his folded
hands resting on a slightly protruding
stomach, D'Andrea looks hard through his
thick round glasses.
"Kids are nondiscriminate in what they
do," he said. "A few swigs of vodka, a couple
of joints, some uppers, some downers . . .
People need to find out how much they can
hold, but it ain't much."
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, staff psychiatrist at
Houston House, is a man in favor of choices,
as long as those choices are made rationally.
On an April afternoon he is attired in tan
summer slacks and a baby blue shirt, accented
with a heavy wool plaid sports jacket. Ra
tional. is cool on spring mornings and eve
nenings, and warm in the afternoons.
D'Andrea is particularly interested in help
ing students make rational choices, especially
where drugs and alcohol are concerned.
"I have extended an interest in drug prob
lems from the early to mid '605," D'Andrea
said. "So when people see somebody with a
drug problem, they refer them to me."
D'Andrea classifies alcoholism as a drug
problem and a disease.
"It (alcoholism) has all the criteria of a dis
ease," he said.
Like all other diseases, he said, alcoholism
has a causative agent, a predictable course,
produce's consistent psychological and phys
ical changes and has uniform cross-cultural
effects.
In order to increase student awareness of
the effects of alcohol here D'Andrea and the
office of Residential Education hope to initiate
an educational program on the use of alcohol
this fall.
Such a program is not aimed at the prohibi
tion of alcohol on campus, merely to increase
rational alcohol use, he said.
A wine connoisseur who has made his own
wine for years, D'Andrea drinks a glass of
wine each evening. But he does not consider
himself a heavy drinker.
"I treat the wine I make with great respect,"
he said.
But even experienced drinkers need to be
cautious, he warns, citing a poster he had seen
for a fraternity Laker, boasting the presence of
25 kegs of beer.
"It's sort of along the lines of the way things
are done at Stanford," he said. "My personal
observation is it's too much. Everyone knows
that with 25 kegs somebody's going to get sick
or hurt.
"Stanford's point of view is that every
body's free to make choices," he continued.
