# The 						morning after – hangovers and beyond
## The 						aches and the queasies

Hangovers. How many of us haven't
experienced the dull ache of the head,
the queasy feeling in the stomach, and
the cotton-mouth effects on the morn
ing after the night before?
According to one medical journal, be
cause of universal consumption of al
cohol, "there are few adults who do not
know its effects from experience."
Why do hangovers happen and what
can one do to alleviate the unpleasant
side effects of too liberal consumption of
alcoholic beverages?
"My understanding of a hangover is
that the main effects you have are be
cause of the drop of the alcohol levels in
your blood from what it was before to
what it is after," said Dr. John Dorman,
a general practitioner at Cowell Health
Center.
He explained that because both han
govers and colds disappear on their own
with no dangerous effects, more time
has been devoted to researching lasting
and potentially dangerous problems
such as alcoholism.
"Hangovers are not really a serious
problem in the medical world," he said

with a smile.
Dr. Dorman said that "there is so
much in the way of old wives' tales that
it's hard to tell what really works to pre
vent hangovers and what doesn't."
The general consensus among stu
dents is that drinking massive amounts
of water before going to bed is the best
way to prevent a hangover in the morn
ing.
Tons of water
"By drinking 'tons' of water you just
lower the alcohol level in the blood," Dr.
Dorman explained. "Tomato juice has
been advocated as has black coffee for
the same reason."

Phi Delt Bill Woolly explained that he
takes aspirin, vitamin B-12 and drinks
large amounts of water before he goes to
bed to prevent his hangover in addition
to eating "a lot" in the morning.
Woolly also said that whether or not
you get a hangover often depends on
what you are drinking.
He said that Rainer Ale was one of the
worst offenders, and that "if you drink
scotch you get more of a hangover than
if you drink vodka."
Everyone has own method
Every person has their own method
for dealing with the sometimes painful
problem.

"I like to go running when I have a
hangover because you run off the
weight you gain, and when you break
into a sweat you like clean your system
out," said Tony Tsai.
"Probably a hangover is one of the
only true indications for taking regular
alka seltzer because it has aspirin for the
head problems and something in it to
settle the stomach as well," Dr. Dorman
commented.
Dr. Dorman also said that Tylenol (or
other similar brands) is much better than
aspirin because it won't upset the
stomach as badly.
Senior Bob Larson said he thinks "a
lot of having a hangover is pretty
psychological. If I drink water before I
go to bed Ifcmwl'll feel great in the morn
ing."
What kind of an effect does a han
gover have?
"When you've got a hangover your
mental abilities are slow — speech,
eyesight—and to be quite honest, your
sexual desires are down," explained
Tsai.
