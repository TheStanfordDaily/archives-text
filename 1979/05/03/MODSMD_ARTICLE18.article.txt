# The 						addiction of alcohol — one student's story
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff 
Mike is quite attractive. A sophomore here, he is
charming and popular. Mike (not his real name) was
raised in an upper-middle class family in a comforta
ble neighborhood. Mike is a self-confessed alcoholic.
"I started drinking in the beginning of ninth grade
on a YMCA trip. There was about 30 peers and every
one of them was gonna go drinking that night. The
counselor bought the beer; kids followed him down
the street like the Pied Piper. I was a little behind the
times," remembered Mike.
Mike didn't like drinking at first. But by the 10th
grade, "I started drinking the hard core stuff straight
out of the bottle. One of those half pints could last a
couple of weekends," said Mike. Older friends
bought the liquor and Mike gradually increased his
tolerance from "a few sips" to one pint of straight
alcohol each weekend.
"I started drinking on dates because 1 was so nerv
ous and drinking made it easier for me to make some
moves," he admitted. "1 would start being an ani
mal. When you drink you get more horny; I mis
treated a lot of girls.
"Most girls detest it when guys drink on dates," he
added.
Drinking every weekend
By Mike's 17th birthday, he was able to buy his
own beer. During his junior and senior years in high
school, he was drinking every weekend at parties. "I
couldn't get by a weekend without drinking."
Mike's habit increased. After a 24-hour celebration
after graduation, he began drinking every day of
summer. "Every day was like a weekend ... I was
buying beer and sometimes drank a case a day.
"I got sick twice in my career, then I built up a
tolerance. I knew what was going to happen so I
would compensate for it. Whenever I do things, I like
to be the best; that applies to drinking too. Every
night I would try and drink more and more," said
Mike.
While playing tennis, Mike discovered he could fit
a tall beer in an empty tennis ball can and the coach
would think it was water. He always had a beer out
on the court. No matter the activity, beer was au
tomatically includ d.
Drunk driving
"I thought I could drive better when I was drunk
because I was more careful. A lot of times, I would be

driving under the speed limit and people would be
speeding by me and they would be pulled over. I
laughed because I was completely smashed — the
cops were arresting the wrong people," Mike re
counted.
As the summer progressed Mike began experienc
ing memory lapses. His reading ability diminished:
"I couldn't even read the newspaper. Your body is
completely sapped of energy when you drink. I
never felt rejuvenated. You feel mellow, you drink,
you come down to earth. There is never really a
hangover, justa typeofblurall the time," he remem
bered.
"I never thought I had a drinking problem, every
body else did. That's the way most alcoholics are:
they never admit it to themselves."
Mike decided to try to quit drinking the first day of
classes here. "I felt like I couldn't compete with all
the geniuses here if I was drunk all the time. I had
tried to quit many times before and couldn't for more
than five minutes. I didn't have any incentive," he
explained.
Cold turkey
He made a commitment to stop cold turkey for the
academic year.
Mike attributes his initial abstention to help from
friends. His friends had to physically restrain him
from drinking on occasion. "Sometimes they would
talk to me for an hour before I was going to go
somewhere that had alcohol. Friday and Saturday
nights I would go to Memorial Church and pray
sometimes," said Mike.
Mike was comfortable attending parties here as a
teetotaler. "People really don't notice. They think
you are drunk just because they are. The atmosphere
picks you up. I got crazy."
He took up chewing tobacco as a substitute. "It
gives you a buzz without losing control," he
explained. He occasionally drank Near Beer, a non
alcoholic beverage that tastes like beer. "If you're
really self-conscious, you can say it's a Lucky beer,
the worst beer people have tasted," he added.
"It's amazing how many people would come up
and say how much they respected me for not drink
ing. Only a couple of people hassled me," he com
mented.
Mike found that with each week it was easier to
pass up the myriad of drinks found at weekend par

ties. "After a few weeks, the beer was completely out
of my system and I waff feeling healthy again."
Mike cited friendships as a major incentive to
"keep off the stuff. When you are drinking, people
are more like your drinking buddies. But you don't
know them that well. If a friend wanted to come to
me when I was drunk, I am sure that he never would.
He'd see me in a drunken stupor and what good
would I do him?
"I wouldn't even notice if he was sad, you don't
notice anyone besides yourself when you are drunk.
You are happy, but you are missing out on the most
important thing — other people," he said.
"It was hard for my confidence when I stopped
because I thought that I couldn't do anything with
out beer. After I did one or two things without it, I
could do other things," he said.
Mike emphasized that once a reformed alcoholic
begins achieving things without a dependence on
alcohol, his confidence level increases to the point
that he "starts doing things that he never did even
with beer."
'A perfect circle'
Once a person starts functioning without alcohol,
he switches from an addictive cycle to what Mike
calls "a perfect circle: confidence, friends, more hap
piness and then more confidence. It's tremendous,"
he confirmed with a huge smile on his face.
Mike took a course here on alcoholism and thinks
he is "probably an alcoholic. Every time I do take a
few beers, I can not stop myself from taking more
and more. It's a terribly embarrassing and degrading
situation," he said.
Last summer, after a successful eight months on
the wagon, the pressure from high school friends at
home caused him to start drinking again. Within
three weeks, he was consuming the amount of liquor
he had the previous summer. He returned to Stan
ford this fall hitting all the frat parties full swing.
"My friends came up to me and asked me not to
drink. Some of them were crying. I decided to quit
again," he said.
Mike has only drunk one time since his decision to
stop drinking again. He thinks this time his absten
tion will be permanent. "I have more pressure not to
drink here at Stanford than I do to drink. You never
have people crying for you to drink."

that he "starts doing things that he never did even
with beer."
'A perfect circle'
Once a person starts functioning without alcohol,
he switches from an addictive cycle to what Mike
calls "a perfect circle: confidence, friends, more hap
piness and then more confidence. It's tremendous,"
he confirmed with a huge smile on his face.
Mike took a course here on alcoholism and thinks
he is "probably an alcoholic. Every time I do take a
few beers, I can not stop myself from taking more
and more. It's a terribly embarrassing and degrading
situation," he said.
Last summer, after a successful eight months on
the wagon, the pressure from high school friends at
home caused him to start drinking again. Within
three weeks, he was consuming the amount of liquor
he had the previous summer. He returned to Stan
ford this fall hitting all the frat parties full swing.
"My friends came up to me and asked me not to
drink. Some of them were crying. I decided to quit
again," he said.
Mike has only drunk one time since his decision to
stop drinking again. He thinks this time his absten
tion will be permanent. "I have more pressure not to
drink here at Stanford than I do to drink. You never
have people crying for you to drink."
Mike is quite attractive. A sophomore here, he is
charming and popular. Mike (not his real name) was
raised in an upper-middle class family in a comforta
ble neighborhood. Mike is a self-confessed alcoholic.
"I started drinking in the beginning of ninth grade
on a YMCA trip. There was about 30 peers and every
one of them was gonna go drinking that night. The
counselor bought the beer; kids followed him down
the street like the Pied Piper. I was a little behind the
times," remembered Mike.
Mike didn't like drinking at first. But by the 10th
grade, "I started drinking the hard core stuff straight
out of the bottle. One of those half pints could last a
couple of weekends," said Mike. Older friends
bought the liquor and Mike gradually increased his
tolerance from "a few sips" to one pint of straight
alcohol each weekend.
"I started drinking on dates because 1 was so nerv
ous and drinking made it easier for me to make some
moves," he admitted. "1 would start being an ani
mal. When you drink you get more horny; I mis
treated a lot of girls.
"Most girls detest it when guys drink on dates," he
added.
Drinking every weekend
By Mike's 17th birthday, he was able to buy his
own beer. During his junior and senior years in high
school, he was drinking every weekend at parties. "I
couldn't get by a weekend without drinking."
Mike's habit increased. After a 24-hour celebration
after graduation, he began drinking every day of
summer. "Every day was like a weekend ... I was
buying beer and sometimes drank a case a day.
"I got sick twice in my career, then I built up a
tolerance. I knew what was going to happen so I
would compensate for it. Whenever I do things, I like
to be the best; that applies to drinking too. Every
night I would try and drink more and more," said
Mike.
While playing tennis, Mike discovered he could fit
a tall beer in an empty tennis ball can and the coach
would think it was water. He always had a beer out
on the court. No matter the activity, beer was au
tomatically includ d.
Drunk driving
"I thought I could drive better when I was drunk
because I was more careful. A lot of times, I would be

driving under the speed limit and people would be
speeding by me and they would be pulled over. I
laughed because I was completely smashed — the
cops were arresting the wrong people," Mike re
counted.
As the summer progressed Mike began experienc
ing memory lapses. His reading ability diminished:
"I couldn't even read the newspaper. Your body is
completely sapped of energy when you drink. I
never felt rejuvenated. You feel mellow, you drink,
you come down to earth. There is never really a
hangover, justa typeofblurall the time," he remem
bered.
"I never thought I had a drinking problem, every
body else did. That's the way most alcoholics are:
they never admit it to themselves."
Mike decided to try to quit drinking the first day of
classes here. "I felt like I couldn't compete with all
the geniuses here if I was drunk all the time. I had
tried to quit many times before and couldn't for more
than five minutes. I didn't have any incentive," he
explained.
Cold turkey
He made a commitment to stop cold turkey for the
academic year.
Mike attributes his initial abstention to help from
friends. His friends had to physically restrain him
from drinking on occasion. "Sometimes they would
talk to me for an hour before I was going to go
somewhere that had alcohol. Friday and Saturday
nights I would go to Memorial Church and pray
sometimes," said Mike.
Mike was comfortable attending parties here as a
teetotaler. "People really don't notice. They think
you are drunk just because they are. The atmosphere
picks you up. I got crazy."
He took up chewing tobacco as a substitute. "It
gives you a buzz without losing control," he
explained. He occasionally drank Near Beer, a non
alcoholic beverage that tastes like beer. "If you're
really self-conscious, you can say it's a Lucky beer,
the worst beer people have tasted," he added.
"It's amazing how many people would come up
and say how much they respected me for not drink
ing. Only a couple of people hassled me," he com
mented.
Mike found that with each week it was easier to
pass up the myriad of drinks found at weekend par

ties. "After a few weeks, the beer was completely out
of my system and I waff feeling healthy again."
Mike cited friendships as a major incentive to
"keep off the stuff. When you are drinking, people
are more like your drinking buddies. But you don't
know them that well. If a friend wanted to come to
me when I was drunk, I am sure that he never would.
He'd see me in a drunken stupor and what good
would I do him?
"I wouldn't even notice if he was sad, you don't
notice anyone besides yourself when you are drunk.
You are happy, but you are missing out on the most
important thing — other people," he said.
"It was hard for my confidence when I stopped
because I thought that I couldn't do anything with
out beer. After I did one or two things without it, I
could do other things," he said.
Mike emphasized that once a reformed alcoholic
begins achieving things without a dependence on
alcohol, his confidence level increases to the point
that he "starts doing things that he never did even
with beer."
