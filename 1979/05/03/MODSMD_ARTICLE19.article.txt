Not that visiting wineries is the only
thing to do in Northern California, but
there really aren't too many places that
don't have at least one winery nearby.
Seems like any little jaunt to the coun
tryside can include a brief stop for local
conversation and a few taste treats.
Spring is the most beautiful time of
the year to travel around the vineyards
because the hills are green, the vines are
just starting to sprout shoots on their
twisted, gnarled trunks and wild mus
tard is everywhere.
Frankly, the whole scene is so damn
romantic that 1 simply cannot be held
responsible if you take one of these trips
with someone of the opposite sex and
later find yourself overly involved. Dis
cipline and mental rigidity are difficult
to maintain while frolicking in the Ches
bro Reservoir after an afternoon of tast
ing wine in the Hecker Pass.
Several wineries exist within a few
miles of Stanford should gasoline be a
problem. These places are quite small
though and it would be prudent to call
them ahead of your visit to make sure
that someone will be around.
Local wineries
Usually, these three wineries are open
one weekend each month. Page Mill
Winery (948-0958) is on Page Mill Road
not far beyond the freeway, Sherrill Cel
lars (851-1932) is under the Post Office in
Woodside and Woodside Vineyards
(851-7475) is half a mile up Kings Mt.
Road toward Huddart Park.
All three of these wineries reflect the
family operation approach which is
starting to blossom all over the United
States. They do not make very much
wine and are able to sell it all at the
winery without the added expense of
going through distributors and retailers.
Likewise, they can make wines the
way they like them rather than trying to
please the median tastes of the mass
market. Hence their wines tend to be
very distinctive and thus good examples
from which to learn about the intricacies
of grape growing and wine making. All
three winemakers are charming, know
ledgeable people who make visits a real
delight.
Most tourists interested in wine want
to visit Napa Valley because of its wide
spread reputation. Unfortunately, the
crowds drawn by this reputation make
most visits somewhat of an ordeal.
Its beautiful but . . .
Napa is beautiful and there are lots of
wineries there, but .... On any

weekend the Napa Valley is just another
version of the bumper-to-bumper traf
fic theme. The wineries are crowded and
more often than not they give very stan
dardized, PR-type presentations.
You won't be invited to taste the best
wines and you won't believe how long it
takes to get back if you have to come
across the Golden Gate Bridge late on a
Sunday afternoon. My suggestion for
visiting Napa is to go during the week.
A much closer and more hospitable
trip is to go south and see the range of
wineries operating in the Santa Clara
Valley. Big ones like Paul Masson and
Mirassou have nice tour programs and
elegant tasting rooms. They make sev
eral excellent wines (mostly from grapes
grown in the Salinas Valley) in addition
to the mass merchandised, rather

pedestrian products which comprise
most of their large volume.
A visit to either of these facilities pro
vides an interesting contrast to the tiny,
family wineries of the Hecker Pass:
Technology and corporate capital versus
love of the soil and hands stained red
from the production of an important
part of the family's diet.
Hecker Pass wineries
Hecker Pass is about 45 minutes driv
ing time from Stanford. Once there,
seven wineries are within walking dis
tance of each other. Picnic areas are con
venient and the gently rolling hills make
bicycle exploration of the area very
pleasant. The wineries all have tasting
rooms, but they are not the tourist spec
tacles that have turned Napa into
another Disneyland.
In the Hecker Pass your chances of

talking with the actual winemaker are
probably 50-50. In Napa your chances of
talking with anyone more knowledge
able than the Marketing Receptionist are
quite slim indeed. Hence, you will get
more honest information in the Hecker
Pass, but you should also be more care
ful about bad mouthing someone's wine
to their face.
To get to Hecker Pass, drive south on
Highway 101 and continue into the
town of Morgan Hill rather than taking
the left hand jog that would put you out
on the freeway. Drive through Morgan
Hill and turn right on Highway 152 to
ward Watsonville (there is a mushroom
farm at that corner). Follow that road all
the way around to where it dead ends in
Hecker Pass Road.
At that point you can turn to your left

and visit Live Oak or Bertero, turn to
your right and visit Hecker Pass or For
tino, or walk straight ahead and catch
the very entertaining and eccentric
Thomas Kruse.
A colorful character
Live Oak has a fascinating tasting
room and a very colorful owner, Peter
Scaglioti.
Scaglioti concentrates on making jug
wines for sale inexpensively at the win
ery. You really have to see Peter in ac
tion while tasting out of his Italian shot
glasses to appreciate the wine.
Bertero is a bit more space age in ar
chitectural style with a wider range of
wines to sample, but the principals lack
Peter's outrageous philosophies of life
in general.
Fortino and Hecker Pass are owned by
brothers who hate each other but both

make good, honest red wines with a
Portuguese intensity that I enjoy. Ask
about the prizes they have won at the
LA County Fair.
Tom Kruse is certifiably mad and
therefore great fun. He will be the one
walking around in the white coat wear
ing a stethescope. His irreverence and
candor are refreshing by any standards
and his wines reflect his personality. He
believes rose wines can be a true art
form. Ask about his vintage dated, es
tate bottled Thompson Seedless.
Croatian nationalists
Back along Highway 152 you will
probably want to stop at Kirigan Cellars
to taste their Malvasia Bianca and in
quire about the progress of the Croatian
nationalist movement. Then try the '77
Cabernet at Sycamore Cellars when you
get to the Uvas Road turnoff. Uvas'Road
is a pretty drive past two reservoirs back
to San Jose's Almaden Valley. A San
Jose map would be helpful for finding
your way out of the Almaden Valley and
back to Stanford.
One word of caution. Driving drunk is
not only illegal, it is dangerous and ex
tremely stupid. Tasting wines at all the
places I've mentioned will definitely re
nder you irresponsible. So you have a
choice.
You can plan your day to include sev
eral hours of eating, resting or frolicking
prior to driving back or you can spi tout a
majority of the wines given you to sam
ple. This second alternative is a good
one to keep in mind.
You will get as much sensory stimula
tion whether the wine goes out the back
of your mouth or out the front. Most
winemakers (Peter Scaglioti perhaps
being an exception) will respect you
more if you demonstrate your interest
by remaining sober enough to actually
taste their product.
Step outside with your glass and relax
over the wine while spitting most of it
out. Enjoy the wines by comparing their
smells, which entails swirling them vig
orously in the glass and sniffing deeply.
Have all your friends get different
samples so that you can trade glasses
and compare two wines at once. Make
remarks about what characteristics you
perceive in the wines — don't think your
opinions aren't valid just because you
don't have extensive wine experience.
You have been tasting foods all your life.
