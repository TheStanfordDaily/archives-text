# Cutting loose-jungle juice to ice-slides
## Campus carousers careen care-free through carnivals, casinos, and keggers 
### Yvonne Randle 
After a taxing week of turn
ing in two papers late, flunking
a midterm, and drawing
number 4998, what's a person
to do? PARTY!
The party scene here consists
of everything from make
vour-own-goodtime to let-the
frats-make-it-for-you. While
some prefer small gatherings,
others are more interested in the
antics of large scale affairs with
music, kegs of beer, and a
crowd greater than the hud
dled masses in Meyer Library.
But whatever the size, the ul
timate goal of every hearty par
tier is to find a "good" party.
A group of Freshman men in
Trancos defined a good party as
"a good mixture of people you
know and don't know and good
music." Twain house residents
agreed that music was impor
tant, but added that there was a
need for "booze."
While small, private parties
attract some, the large, massive
affairs abound. The most famil
iar of these fall into two
categories: dorm and frat par
ties.
Theme parties
Dorm parties feature specific
themes, especially Halloween
and Christmas, which allow re
sidents the opportunity to dress
up or dress whacko.
But as the year wears on,
dorm residents seem to lose
their enthusiasm for such af
fairs. Freshmen in Trancos ob
served that "Dorm parties were
fine at the beginning of the
year. But now we know
everyone here." Junior Nathan
Sarkisian said of dorm parties,
"There's never enough beer;
cups aren't big enough, and
drinks aren't strong enough."
When this becomes the case,
or when one is in the mood for a
change of pace, there is an al
ternative — the fraternities.
Possibly one of the best
known and most popular par

ties is the Beta Nooner. Accord
ing to the Betas, this annual
event is held to promote rush
month. Held on the Beta house
lawn, the Nooner gives those
whose class schedule does not
include Poli Sci 172 or Econ 91
the opportunity to sit in the
sun, listen to a live band, and
indulge in a glass or two (or
three or more) of beer.
Dance, sing and be merry
According to Mark Triska,
the event has never been rained
out, and because it is held dur
ing the first week of the quarter,
people can dance, sing, and be
merry in the sunshine before
the effects of school once again
take hold.
Another popular out-door
phenomenon is the Laker. Lake
Lagunita provides the
backdrop for the day-long fes
tivities outside the Kappa
Alpha house.
A better party for some is lo
cated on a raft anchored off
shore from theKA house. Since
refreshment isde rigeur, a keg of
beer is taken — at great cost —
out to the thirsty rafters by a
very ambitious swimmer.
Afternoon free-for-alls are
not the only form of parties the
fraternities provide. Evening
parties take place practically
ever weekend.
But many students do not
like frat parties. As one
freshman put it, "Frat parties
are all the same."
'High school' atmosphere
Another commented that
many "have the atmosphere of
a high school dance," but
added that the parties provided
a good means of meeting
people.
Despite some aversion to at
tending large frat parties, the
numbers attending may even
be on the increase due to out
side influence. "(The movie)
Animal House was a positive
thing. It reawakened interest in

frat parties," said Triska.
While not all frat parties emu
late the antics depicted in Ani
mal House, the frats do offer a
variety of theme parties.
Theta Xi's annual Casino
Party and Cafe Xi is one such
party which celebrated its 10th
anniversary last week. The
Casino, complete with black
jack tables, craps table's and a
roulette wheel, is located in one
room, with dancing in another.
But once a year
Upstairs, on a balcony over
looking the bay is the Cafe Xi.
•This French creperie, open only
once a year, serves a variety of
delicacies as well as wine.
According to residents of the
house, the recipe for the crepes
has been passed down from
year to year: "When the time
comes, we whip it out!"
The Alpha Delts are some
what renowned for their annual
Jungle Party where everyone
"goes wild." Pictures testifying
to this fact are displayed in the
house lounge. An outside pond
is constructed, palm leaves are
brought in, and a special jungle
elixir is prepared from a secret
recipe. According to residents,
costumes for the affair are op
tional.
Possibly the least known of
all the annual events is Delta
Tau Delta's Cowboy Party.
Sophomore Mark Greife said of
the party: "It was the best frat
party I went to last year, and it's
the only frat party I'm going to
this year."
'Down home country'
A country and western band
performs and people become
"down home country" for the
evening.
A unique Delt tradition oc
curs at this party: the ice slide.
First, the house's pool table is
covered with wood. Then, both
table and floor are covered with
plastic and a layer of crushed
ice.
Once preparations are

finished, members of the
fraternity then offer daring
souls the opportunity to try
their luck at the slide.
Those who participate jump
from the elevated dance floor
onto the pool table three feet
away, sliding across and through
the ice in an attempt to set the
record for sliding the farthest.
While it may sound crazy,
ono individual made the jump a

total of five times last year and
will no doubt be back again.
These are just a few examples
of the diversity of parties here.
Who has the best? That is up to
each individual to decide. Just
as Stanford has something to
offer everyone in the academic
realm, it is also true that it has
something to offer them in the
world of partying.

After a taxing week of turn
ing in two papers late, flunking
a midterm, and drawing
number 4998, what's a person
to do? PARTY!
The party scene here consists
of everything from make
vour-own-goodtime to let-the
frats-make-it-for-you. While
some prefer small gatherings,
others are more interested in the
antics of large scale affairs with
music, kegs of beer, and a
crowd greater than the hud
dled masses in Meyer Library.
But whatever the size, the ul
timate goal of every hearty par
tier is to find a "good" party.
A group of Freshman men in
Trancos defined a good party as
"a good mixture of people you
know and don't know and good
music." Twain house residents
agreed that music was impor
tant, but added that there was a
need for "booze."
While small, private parties
attract some, the large, massive
affairs abound. The most famil
iar of these fall into two
categories: dorm and frat par
ties.
Theme parties
Dorm parties feature specific
themes, especially Halloween
and Christmas, which allow re
sidents the opportunity to dress
up or dress whacko.
But as the year wears on,
dorm residents seem to lose
their enthusiasm for such af
fairs. Freshmen in Trancos ob
served that "Dorm parties were
fine at the beginning of the
year. But now we know
everyone here." Junior Nathan
Sarkisian said of dorm parties,
"There's never enough beer;
cups aren't big enough, and
drinks aren't strong enough."
When this becomes the case,
or when one is in the mood for a
change of pace, there is an al
ternative — the fraternities.
Possibly one of the best
known and most popular par

ties is the Beta Nooner. Accord
ing to the Betas, this annual
event is held to promote rush
month. Held on the Beta house
lawn, the Nooner gives those
whose class schedule does not
include Poli Sci 172 or Econ 91
the opportunity to sit in the
sun, listen to a live band, and
indulge in a glass or two (or
three or more) of beer.
Dance, sing and be merry
According to Mark Triska,
the event has never been rained
out, and because it is held dur
ing the first week of the quarter,
people can dance, sing, and be
merry in the sunshine before
the effects of school once again
take hold.
Another popular out-door
phenomenon is the Laker. Lake
Lagunita provides the
backdrop for the day-long fes
tivities outside the Kappa
Alpha house.
A better party for some is lo
cated on a raft anchored off
shore from theKA house. Since
refreshment isde rigeur, a keg of
beer is taken — at great cost —
out to the thirsty rafters by a
very ambitious swimmer.
Afternoon free-for-alls are
not the only form of parties the
fraternities provide. Evening
parties take place practically
ever weekend.
But many students do not
like frat parties. As one
freshman put it, "Frat parties
are all the same."
'High school' atmosphere
Another commented that
many "have the atmosphere of
a high school dance," but
added that the parties provided
a good means of meeting
people.
Despite some aversion to at
tending large frat parties, the
numbers attending may even
be on the increase due to out
side influence. "(The movie)
Animal House was a positive
thing. It reawakened interest in

frat parties," said Triska.
While not all frat parties emu
late the antics depicted in Ani
mal House, the frats do offer a
variety of theme parties.
Theta Xi's annual Casino
Party and Cafe Xi is one such
party which celebrated its 10th
anniversary last week. The
Casino, complete with black
jack tables, craps table's and a
roulette wheel, is located in one
room, with dancing in another.
But once a year
Upstairs, on a balcony over
looking the bay is the Cafe Xi.
•This French creperie, open only
once a year, serves a variety of
delicacies as well as wine.
According to residents of the
house, the recipe for the crepes
has been passed down from
year to year: "When the time
comes, we whip it out!"
The Alpha Delts are some
what renowned for their annual
Jungle Party where everyone
"goes wild." Pictures testifying
to this fact are displayed in the
house lounge. An outside pond
is constructed, palm leaves are
brought in, and a special jungle
elixir is prepared from a secret
recipe. According to residents,
costumes for the affair are op
tional.
Possibly the least known of
all the annual events is Delta
Tau Delta's Cowboy Party.
Sophomore Mark Greife said of
the party: "It was the best frat
party I went to last year, and it's
the only frat party I'm going to
this year."
'Down home country'
A country and western band
performs and people become
"down home country" for the
evening.
A unique Delt tradition oc
curs at this party: the ice slide.
First, the house's pool table is
covered with wood. Then, both
table and floor are covered with
plastic and a layer of crushed
ice.
Once preparations are

finished, members of the
fraternity then offer daring
souls the opportunity to try
their luck at the slide.
Those who participate jump
from the elevated dance floor
onto the pool table three feet
away, sliding across and through
the ice in an attempt to set the
record for sliding the farthest.
While it may sound crazy,
ono individual made the jump a

total of five times last year and
will no doubt be back again.
These are just a few examples
of the diversity of parties here.
Who has the best? That is up to
each individual to decide. Just
as Stanford has something to
offer everyone in the academic
realm, it is also true that it has
something to offer them in the
world of partying.
