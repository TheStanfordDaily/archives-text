### 
A Special Supplement to the Daily is hopefully just that-something
special that you would not normally find within the Daily's day-to
day coverage.
What this issue was intended to accomplish has hopefully herein
been achieved. The idea was to take a look at partying in general, going
beyond the specifics of place, date and time and instead dipping into the
flavor, the why, the stream of consciousness as it were, of va-rious kinds
of ei'ents.
We tried to ask some questions, like why disco has become such a
tremendous success. We tried to answer others, such as what is new or
different to do. And we sought a balanced view of partying, ergo the
section on drinking and its problems.
Throughout, a blend of facts, ideas, fun and fantasy were sought. I
hope the result is informative, stimulating and refreshing -lsure had a
great time putting it together.
