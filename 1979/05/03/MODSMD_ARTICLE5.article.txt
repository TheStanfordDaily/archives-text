# Overseas campuses-Bacchanalian delights
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Has Stanford social life be
come stifling and mundane for
you? If you feel as if you have
already exploited all the enter
tainment opportunities the
Farm has to offer, maybe you
should explore that fount of
true decadence and riotous liv
ing: the overseas campuses.
Ask anyone. A supposedly
educational sojourn in Europe
with Stanford can be <? constant
bacchanal, if arranged prop
erly. Whether your preferred
avocation be cultural, liquid,
rhythmic or indecent, you can
choose a campus to fulfill your
every craving.
The blatant hedonist will un
doubtedly be attracted to the
palatial majesty of Cliveden,
where even the minor incon
venience of learning a foreign
language is circumvented.
Here, you can order your favo
rite beverage in your slurred na
tive tongue at the cozy pub in
the mansion's basement.
The pub is student-run and

opens every night around 11 as
long as public demand exists,
according to ex-Cliveden bar
tender Doug Williams. "By law,
English pubs close at 10:30 on
weeknights and at 11 on
weekends, so people go there
first and then come back to the
pub," he explained.
Down the driveway
To pursue England's favorite
diversion, Stanfordites can
venture outside the confines of
Cliveden to pubs in the area,
such as Feather's, at the end of
Cliveden's mile-long driveway,
or the Royal Standard of Eng
land, a 900-year-old pub in
Wickham.
A half-hour walk from Clive
den will bring the adventurer to
the village of Cookham and its
"main drag" lined with about
10 pubs.
"A Cookham run" consists of
"a drink in each pub and a crawl
back home," said Williams.
Although "people are never
there long enough to have par
ties," a few social activities do

materialize at the Astors' old
haunt at Cliveden, according to
Williams.
To celebrate their first night
in their new abode on the scep
tered isle, around 30 people
split a "barrel" (keg) last spring
and "just got blitzed," accord
ing to Williams.
"One warm night, we stole a
keg from the pub and had a roof
party," he continued. The final
dinner, among "the suits of
armor and couches"of the main
dining hall was a "really classy"
affair, at which "everyone got
ripped."
Florentine iniquity
Nestled in the foothills of
Florence, one stumbles upon
Stanford's other prime over
seas den of iniquity.
Described as "not really an
intense party place," by former
Florence philistine Mark Nas
sutti, the Villa provides a
"great, relaxed atmosphere."
Florence also has its own
student-operated enterprise,
called the cantinetta. Located in
the lower regions of the Villa,
the cantinetta is open every
night for casual amusement or
calm "studying."
Several social events were
held while Nassutti languished
in the Villa's aristocratic setting
last winter. The Valentines'
party "was pretty awesome"
and inspired by a "weirdo" Ita
lian disc jockey, he said. Stu
dents attended a first-day-of
spring party attired in shorts
and tennis shoes to swig gin
and tonics and imbibe from "a
real, live keg of beer."
Outside retreats include the
"very tacky" Ceserini Brothers,
on the banks of the Arno,
where "the best thing is the
huge, cheap drinks," Nassutti
said. Even though "it's not a

place to go to meet Italians," it
is bestowed with certain advan
tages.
Under the table
"One 'humongous' White
Russian will put you under the
table," Nassutti revealed. It has
a good juke box with American
records, and"it closes early
enough that, if you stumble fast
enough, you can catch the last
bus from Florence to the Villa."
Harry's Bar, a "kind of dressy
and too American" spot, and Le
Petit Bois, a disco near Fiesole,
are also frequented by Villa
people, said Nassutti.
The walled city of West Berlin
offers a unique environment to
wayward Stanfordites, accord
ing to Jon Gibson, who studied
there two years ago. "Since get
ting out of the city is inconve
nient, Berlin is like a world mic
rocosm," he said.
"The Villa is the rallying
point for student social life at
night," he said, "but there is an
abundance of night life in Ber
lin."
"The best parties we ever had
were huge, impromptu ones at
the Villa around twice a quar
ter. One time we had 30 six
packs of German beer, which is
really cheap."
Telephones at each table
"Berlin has some of the most
innovative, avant-garde discos
in the world," he said, with at
least 10 to 15 discotheques. "One
has a telephone at each table"
for intercommunication bet
ween tables, and "another has
pneumatic air tubes for mes
sages."
Berlin is also well-equipped
with bars, or "kneipnen" as
they are known, "lots of movie
theatres, three symphony or
chestras that I know of and one
of the best opera houses in
Europe," Gibson said.
The average Stanford stu
dent attends "at least one con
cert or play per week." During
Gibson's stay, Stanford subsi
dized ticket purchases up to 15
marks bv one-half of the cost.
"Rock performers come
through all the time. Bob Mar
ley and Jethro Tull were there
when I was," he said. "Berlin is
very in touch."
Vienna, the site of another
German-speaking campus, is
saturated with cultural events
and awareness, affecting even
the most primitive souls.
Opera once a week
"Most students get a
schedule (of events) when they
arrive in Vienna," said An
nalisa Wood. "There is some
thing every night, such as
chamber music, church organ
recitals, which are often free,
and theatre performances."
According to Wood, "most stu
dents go to the opera at least
once a week."
Stanford students in Vienna
are spread out in dorms around
the city and given an allowance
of money for food and transpor
tation within the city. Thus, or
ganized activities rarely occur,
hut, often "six to ten students

will get together with their Aus
trian friends or roommates. Par
ties are student-initiated and
often in the dorms."
Discos are relatively new in
the more classically oriented
metropolis. Still, "there is
plenty to do at night," Wood
said. There are many cafes and
wine taverns (called heurigen),
where a dozen or more stu
dents will congregate with food
over picnic tables.
The ball season, Fasching, in
January and February, is the
busiest time of the Viennese
calendar. "Balls are held every
night and two to three on the
weekends," Wood said. Stan
ford students take dancing les
sons and have participated en
thusiastically in this tradition.
Sedate Vienna stands in
marked contrast to the
worldliness and sophistication
of Paris. Yet, the life of an aver
age Parisian student is not the
jungle of amour that one might
expect, according to Tricia
Ward.
Cafe life
Paris "is not like Stanford on
the weekends, when you can
just walk around and find par
ties," she said. "The University
is very much in the city and not
on a campus, so a lot of social
life is in the city and its cafes.
The social life is just the oppo
site as here in the United
States."
The parties in French univer
sity dorms are "analagous to
frat parties here, but with old,
'60s rock music," Ward said.
Jim Clarke, who just returned
from living in the Lanteri dorm
in Paris, said that "the parties
were almost too American. We
had a real Georgia Tech faction
and a predominance of Ameri
cans. The French seemed a little
shy."
A Christmas party was the
only social event specifically
organized by Stanford during
Ward's tour de Paris last year.
"We usually went out in groups
of two or three and tried to meet
people. The real social life was
going to movies and just walk
ing around the Latin Quarter,"
she said.
The restaurant mystique is
"really important" in Paris,
around which the "whole aura
of going out late" revolves. "It's
the real social status thing to do
for a French student," Ward re
lated, and involves at least four
hours and $30 per couple.
"We definitely had a good
time," Clarke said of his Parisian
experience. "We'd get together
and have picnics or go to cafes
and have a few brews. We had
some wing-dinger pots (similar
to our sherry hours)," he said.
Relaxed Tours
Two hours away from the
bustling glitter of Paris in the
heart of the Loire Valley
chateaux region, Tours' am
biance is more relaxed and not as
visibly seductive.

breaks (poses d'etudes) and par
ties (bourns, the French
onomatopoeic translation) al
most every week, at which time
the Tours police force typically
occupies itself by responding to
neighbors' requests for silence.
Outside the Villa, the Uni
versity of Tours dorms held
sparsely attended and rather
stilted bourns.
Chelberg declared the one
disco in Tours "pretty good, but
not many French students were
there." Again, the cafe syn
drome predominates in Tours.
"In Tours there was more get
ting together with friends, but
the opportunity to go to Paris
frequently arose," he said.
Creperies, such as Le Dol
man near the international stu

dent dorm of Sanitas, received
a lot of business from Stanfor
dites starving on their meager
budgets. Cafe l'Univers temp
ted the calorie-conscious with
ice cream atrocities like the
"Black Roc."
Cafe Chaud, an elegant and
exotic bar in the heart of old
Tours, and the nearby Slem's
American Bar, run by a trans
planted seven-foot basketball
player from the States, attracted
those students seeking night
time fun.
Tours' infamous free phones
were probably the most popu
lar social release the town had
to offer. "Want to go out and
call?" became an evening salu
tation, according to Nelson.

Has Stanford social life be
come stifling and mundane for
you? If you feel as if you have
already exploited all the enter
tainment opportunities the
Farm has to offer, maybe you
should explore that fount of
true decadence and riotous liv
ing: the overseas campuses.
Ask anyone. A supposedly
educational sojourn in Europe
with Stanford can be <? constant
bacchanal, if arranged prop
erly. Whether your preferred
avocation be cultural, liquid,
rhythmic or indecent, you can
choose a campus to fulfill your
every craving.
The blatant hedonist will un
doubtedly be attracted to the
palatial majesty of Cliveden,
where even the minor incon
venience of learning a foreign
language is circumvented.
Here, you can order your favo
rite beverage in your slurred na
tive tongue at the cozy pub in
the mansion's basement.
The pub is student-run and

opens every night around 11 as
long as public demand exists,
according to ex-Cliveden bar
tender Doug Williams. "By law,
English pubs close at 10:30 on
weeknights and at 11 on
weekends, so people go there
first and then come back to the
pub," he explained.
Down the driveway
To pursue England's favorite
diversion, Stanfordites can
venture outside the confines of
Cliveden to pubs in the area,
such as Feather's, at the end of
Cliveden's mile-long driveway,
or the Royal Standard of Eng
land, a 900-year-old pub in
Wickham.
A half-hour walk from Clive
den will bring the adventurer to
the village of Cookham and its
"main drag" lined with about
10 pubs.
"A Cookham run" consists of
"a drink in each pub and a crawl
back home," said Williams.
Although "people are never
there long enough to have par
ties," a few social activities do

materialize at the Astors' old
haunt at Cliveden, according to
Williams.
To celebrate their first night
in their new abode on the scep
tered isle, around 30 people
split a "barrel" (keg) last spring
and "just got blitzed," accord
ing to Williams.
"One warm night, we stole a
keg from the pub and had a roof
party," he continued. The final
dinner, among "the suits of
armor and couches"of the main
dining hall was a "really classy"
affair, at which "everyone got
ripped."
Florentine iniquity
Nestled in the foothills of
Florence, one stumbles upon
Stanford's other prime over
seas den of iniquity.
Described as "not really an
intense party place," by former
Florence philistine Mark Nas
sutti, the Villa provides a
"great, relaxed atmosphere."
Florence also has its own
student-operated enterprise,
called the cantinetta. Located in
the lower regions of the Villa,
the cantinetta is open every
night for casual amusement or
calm "studying."
Several social events were
held while Nassutti languished
in the Villa's aristocratic setting
last winter. The Valentines'
party "was pretty awesome"
and inspired by a "weirdo" Ita
lian disc jockey, he said. Stu
dents attended a first-day-of
spring party attired in shorts
and tennis shoes to swig gin
and tonics and imbibe from "a
real, live keg of beer."
Outside retreats include the
"very tacky" Ceserini Brothers,
on the banks of the Arno,
where "the best thing is the
huge, cheap drinks," Nassutti
said. Even though "it's not a

place to go to meet Italians," it
is bestowed with certain advan
tages.
Under the table
"One 'humongous' White
Russian will put you under the
table," Nassutti revealed. It has
a good juke box with American
records, and"it closes early
enough that, if you stumble fast
enough, you can catch the last
bus from Florence to the Villa."
Harry's Bar, a "kind of dressy
and too American" spot, and Le
Petit Bois, a disco near Fiesole,
are also frequented by Villa
people, said Nassutti.
The walled city of West Berlin
offers a unique environment to
wayward Stanfordites, accord
ing to Jon Gibson, who studied
there two years ago. "Since get
ting out of the city is inconve
nient, Berlin is like a world mic
rocosm," he said.
"The Villa is the rallying
point for student social life at
night," he said, "but there is an
abundance of night life in Ber
lin."
"The best parties we ever had
were huge, impromptu ones at
the Villa around twice a quar
ter. One time we had 30 six
packs of German beer, which is
really cheap."
Telephones at each table
"Berlin has some of the most
innovative, avant-garde discos
in the world," he said, with at
least 10 to 15 discotheques. "One
has a telephone at each table"
for intercommunication bet
ween tables, and "another has
pneumatic air tubes for mes
sages."
Berlin is also well-equipped
with bars, or "kneipnen" as
they are known, "lots of movie
theatres, three symphony or
chestras that I know of and one
of the best opera houses in
Europe," Gibson said.
The average Stanford stu
dent attends "at least one con
cert or play per week." During
Gibson's stay, Stanford subsi
dized ticket purchases up to 15
marks bv one-half of the cost.
"Rock performers come
through all the time. Bob Mar
ley and Jethro Tull were there
when I was," he said. "Berlin is
very in touch."
Vienna, the site of another
German-speaking campus, is
saturated with cultural events
and awareness, affecting even
the most primitive souls.
Opera once a week
"Most students get a
schedule (of events) when they
arrive in Vienna," said An
nalisa Wood. "There is some
thing every night, such as
chamber music, church organ
recitals, which are often free,
and theatre performances."
According to Wood, "most stu
dents go to the opera at least
once a week."
Stanford students in Vienna
are spread out in dorms around
the city and given an allowance
of money for food and transpor
tation within the city. Thus, or
ganized activities rarely occur,
hut, often "six to ten students

will get together with their Aus
trian friends or roommates. Par
ties are student-initiated and
often in the dorms."
Discos are relatively new in
the more classically oriented
metropolis. Still, "there is
plenty to do at night," Wood
said. There are many cafes and
wine taverns (called heurigen),
where a dozen or more stu
dents will congregate with food
over picnic tables.
The ball season, Fasching, in
January and February, is the
busiest time of the Viennese
calendar. "Balls are held every
night and two to three on the
weekends," Wood said. Stan
ford students take dancing les
sons and have participated en
thusiastically in this tradition.
Sedate Vienna stands in
marked contrast to the
worldliness and sophistication
of Paris. Yet, the life of an aver
age Parisian student is not the
jungle of amour that one might
expect, according to Tricia
Ward.
Cafe life
Paris "is not like Stanford on
the weekends, when you can
just walk around and find par
ties," she said. "The University
is very much in the city and not
on a campus, so a lot of social
life is in the city and its cafes.
The social life is just the oppo
site as here in the United
States."
The parties in French univer
sity dorms are "analagous to
frat parties here, but with old,
'60s rock music," Ward said.
Jim Clarke, who just returned
from living in the Lanteri dorm
in Paris, said that "the parties
were almost too American. We
had a real Georgia Tech faction
and a predominance of Ameri
cans. The French seemed a little
shy."
A Christmas party was the
only social event specifically
organized by Stanford during
Ward's tour de Paris last year.
"We usually went out in groups
of two or three and tried to meet
people. The real social life was
going to movies and just walk
ing around the Latin Quarter,"
she said.
The restaurant mystique is
"really important" in Paris,
around which the "whole aura
of going out late" revolves. "It's
the real social status thing to do
for a French student," Ward re
lated, and involves at least four
hours and $30 per couple.
"We definitely had a good
time," Clarke said of his Parisian
experience. "We'd get together
and have picnics or go to cafes
and have a few brews. We had
some wing-dinger pots (similar
to our sherry hours)," he said.
Relaxed Tours
Two hours away from the
bustling glitter of Paris in the
heart of the Loire Valley
chateaux region, Tours' am
biance is more relaxed and not as
visibly seductive.
The Villa is ravaged by

Has Stanford social life be
come stifling and mundane for
you? If you feel as if you have
already exploited all the enter
tainment opportunities the
Farm has to offer, maybe you
should explore that fount of
true decadence and riotous liv
ing: the overseas campuses.
Ask anyone. A supposedly
educational sojourn in Europe
with Stanford can be <? constant
bacchanal, if arranged prop
erly. Whether your preferred
avocation be cultural, liquid,
rhythmic or indecent, you can
choose a campus to fulfill your
every craving.
The blatant hedonist will un
doubtedly be attracted to the
palatial majesty of Cliveden,
where even the minor incon
venience of learning a foreign
language is circumvented.
Here, you can order your favo
rite beverage in your slurred na
tive tongue at the cozy pub in
the mansion's basement.
The pub is student-run and

opens every night around 11 as
long as public demand exists,
according to ex-Cliveden bar
tender Doug Williams. "By law,
English pubs close at 10:30 on
weeknights and at 11 on
weekends, so people go there
first and then come back to the
pub," he explained.
Down the driveway
To pursue England's favorite
diversion, Stanfordites can
venture outside the confines of
Cliveden to pubs in the area,
such as Feather's, at the end of
Cliveden's mile-long driveway,
or the Royal Standard of Eng
land, a 900-year-old pub in
Wickham.
A half-hour walk from Clive
den will bring the adventurer to
the village of Cookham and its
"main drag" lined with about
10 pubs.
"A Cookham run" consists of
"a drink in each pub and a crawl
back home," said Williams.
Although "people are never
there long enough to have par
ties," a few social activities do

materialize at the Astors' old
haunt at Cliveden, according to
Williams.
To celebrate their first night
in their new abode on the scep
tered isle, around 30 people
split a "barrel" (keg) last spring
and "just got blitzed," accord
ing to Williams.
"One warm night, we stole a
keg from the pub and had a roof
party," he continued. The final
dinner, among "the suits of
armor and couches"of the main
dining hall was a "really classy"
affair, at which "everyone got
ripped."
Florentine iniquity
Nestled in the foothills of
Florence, one stumbles upon
Stanford's other prime over
seas den of iniquity.
Described as "not really an
intense party place," by former
Florence philistine Mark Nas
sutti, the Villa provides a
"great, relaxed atmosphere."
Florence also has its own
student-operated enterprise,
called the cantinetta. Located in
the lower regions of the Villa,
the cantinetta is open every
night for casual amusement or
calm "studying."
Several social events were
held while Nassutti languished
in the Villa's aristocratic setting
last winter. The Valentines'
party "was pretty awesome"
and inspired by a "weirdo" Ita
lian disc jockey, he said. Stu
dents attended a first-day-of
spring party attired in shorts
and tennis shoes to swig gin
and tonics and imbibe from "a
real, live keg of beer."
Outside retreats include the
"very tacky" Ceserini Brothers,
on the banks of the Arno,
where "the best thing is the
huge, cheap drinks," Nassutti
said. Even though "it's not a

place to go to meet Italians," it
is bestowed with certain advan
tages.
Under the table
"One 'humongous' White
Russian will put you under the
table," Nassutti revealed. It has
a good juke box with American
records, and"it closes early
enough that, if you stumble fast
enough, you can catch the last
bus from Florence to the Villa."
Harry's Bar, a "kind of dressy
and too American" spot, and Le
Petit Bois, a disco near Fiesole,
are also frequented by Villa
people, said Nassutti.
The walled city of West Berlin
offers a unique environment to
wayward Stanfordites, accord
ing to Jon Gibson, who studied
there two years ago. "Since get
ting out of the city is inconve
nient, Berlin is like a world mic
rocosm," he said.
"The Villa is the rallying
point for student social life at
night," he said, "but there is an
abundance of night life in Ber
lin."
"The best parties we ever had
were huge, impromptu ones at
the Villa around twice a quar
ter. One time we had 30 six
packs of German beer, which is
really cheap."
Telephones at each table
"Berlin has some of the most
innovative, avant-garde discos
in the world," he said, with at
least 10 to 15 discotheques. "One
has a telephone at each table"
for intercommunication bet
ween tables, and "another has
pneumatic air tubes for mes
sages."
Berlin is also well-equipped
with bars, or "kneipnen" as
they are known, "lots of movie
theatres, three symphony or
chestras that I know of and one
of the best opera houses in
Europe," Gibson said.
The average Stanford stu
dent attends "at least one con
cert or play per week." During
Gibson's stay, Stanford subsi
dized ticket purchases up to 15
marks bv one-half of the cost.
"Rock performers come
through all the time. Bob Mar
ley and Jethro Tull were there
when I was," he said. "Berlin is
very in touch."
Vienna, the site of another
German-speaking campus, is
saturated with cultural events
and awareness, affecting even
the most primitive souls.
Opera once a week
"Most students get a
schedule (of events) when they
arrive in Vienna," said An
nalisa Wood. "There is some
thing every night, such as
chamber music, church organ
recitals, which are often free,
and theatre performances."
According to Wood, "most stu
dents go to the opera at least
once a week."
Stanford students in Vienna
are spread out in dorms around
the city and given an allowance
of money for food and transpor
tation within the city. Thus, or
ganized activities rarely occur,
hut, often "six to ten students

will get together with their Aus
trian friends or roommates. Par
ties are student-initiated and
often in the dorms."
Discos are relatively new in
the more classically oriented
metropolis. Still, "there is
plenty to do at night," Wood
said. There are many cafes and
wine taverns (called heurigen),
where a dozen or more stu
dents will congregate with food
over picnic tables.
The ball season, Fasching, in
January and February, is the
busiest time of the Viennese
calendar. "Balls are held every
night and two to three on the
weekends," Wood said. Stan
ford students take dancing les
sons and have participated en
thusiastically in this tradition.
Sedate Vienna stands in
marked contrast to the
worldliness and sophistication
of Paris. Yet, the life of an aver
age Parisian student is not the
jungle of amour that one might
expect, according to Tricia
Ward.
Cafe life
Paris "is not like Stanford on
the weekends, when you can
just walk around and find par
ties," she said. "The University
is very much in the city and not
on a campus, so a lot of social
life is in the city and its cafes.
The social life is just the oppo
site as here in the United
States."
The parties in French univer
sity dorms are "analagous to
frat parties here, but with old,
'60s rock music," Ward said.
Jim Clarke, who just returned
from living in the Lanteri dorm
in Paris, said that "the parties
were almost too American. We
had a real Georgia Tech faction
and a predominance of Ameri
cans. The French seemed a little
shy."
A Christmas party was the
only social event specifically
organized by Stanford during
Ward's tour de Paris last year.
"We usually went out in groups
of two or three and tried to meet
people. The real social life was
going to movies and just walk
ing around the Latin Quarter,"
she said.

ford students take dancing les
sons and have participated en
thusiastically in this tradition.
Sedate Vienna stands in
marked contrast to the
worldliness and sophistication
of Paris. Yet, the life of an aver
age Parisian student is not the
jungle of amour that one might
expect, according to Tricia
Ward.
Cafe life
Paris "is not like Stanford on
the weekends, when you can
just walk around and find par
ties," she said. "The University
is very much in the city and not
on a campus, so a lot of social
life is in the city and its cafes.
The social life is just the oppo
site as here in the United
States."
The parties in French univer
sity dorms are "analagous to
frat parties here, but with old,
'60s rock music," Ward said.
Jim Clarke, who just returned
from living in the Lanteri dorm
in Paris, said that "the parties
were almost too American. We
had a real Georgia Tech faction
and a predominance of Ameri
cans. The French seemed a little
shy."
A Christmas party was the
only social event specifically
organized by Stanford during
Ward's tour de Paris last year.
"We usually went out in groups
of two or three and tried to meet
people. The real social life was
going to movies and just walk
ing around the Latin Quarter,"
she said.
The restaurant mystique is
"really important" in Paris,
around which the "whole aura
of going out late" revolves. "It's
the real social status thing to do
for a French student," Ward re
lated, and involves at least four
hours and $30 per couple.
"We definitely had a good
time," Clarke said of his Parisian
experience. "We'd get together
and have picnics or go to cafes
and have a few brews. We had
some wing-dinger pots (similar
to our sherry hours)," he said.
Relaxed Tours
Two hours away from the
bustling glitter of Paris in the
heart of the Loire Valley
chateaux region, Tours' am
biance is more relaxed and not as
visibly seductive.

breaks (poses d'etudes) and par
ties (bourns, the French
onomatopoeic translation) al
most every week, at which time
the Tours police force typically
occupies itself by responding to
neighbors' requests for silence.
Outside the Villa, the Uni
versity of Tours dorms held
sparsely attended and rather
stilted bourns.
Chelberg declared the one
disco in Tours "pretty good, but
not many French students were
there." Again, the cafe syn
drome predominates in Tours.
"In Tours there was more get
ting together with friends, but
the opportunity to go to Paris
frequently arose," he said.
Creperies, such as Le Dol
man near the international stu

dent dorm of Sanitas, received
a lot of business from Stanfor
dites starving on their meager
budgets. Cafe l'Univers temp
ted the calorie-conscious with
ice cream atrocities like the
"Black Roc."
Cafe Chaud, an elegant and
exotic bar in the heart of old
Tours, and the nearby Slem's
American Bar, run by a trans
planted seven-foot basketball
player from the States, attracted
those students seeking night
time fun.
Tours' infamous free phones
were probably the most popu
lar social release the town had
to offer. "Want to go out and
call?" became an evening salu
tation, according to Nelson.
