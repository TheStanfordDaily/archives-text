# Discomania on the Peninsula
## 
### Jenny Smith 
There are as many different
types of discos in any American
city as there are classes, races
and cliques to fill them, and the
Bay Area is no exception. Both
ends of the spectrum are co
vered, from the psychedelic
funk disco to the intimate little
supper club and everything in
between.
Palo Alto's El Rancho Disco
seems to be a representative
example of a disco in its purest
form. The room comes alive
under a $8,00(1 lighting system;
colored lights form a star over
the dance floor and extend to all
corners of the room. Spotlights
alternate with a strobe in an al
most continuous assault on the
eyes.
The dance floor is large and
obviously the focal point of El
Rancho. It is surrounded by ta
bles and chairs, most occupied
only by coats and purses on any
weekend, or maybe by a

worn-out couple, numbed from
the waist down, but still irresis
tibly tapping their feet to Donna
Summer's latest hit.
Filling the dance floor are
dancers of all types. In one
corner, a young couple looking
like prime candidates for a
Carol Burnett comedy routine
try desperately to pick up the
beat.
Stars of the evening
On the other side of the
dance floor, vying for a little
room in which to boogie, the
stars of the evening are doing
their thing, delirious with disco
fever.
A tall, imposing-looking
black man in a white tuxedo
and brilliant red shirt lifts his
dazzlingly clad partner into the
air, spins her around and brings
her back down into a perfect
execution of the splits.
Two older couples stare,
completely enthralled. "That's
whv I come here," one of them

said. "The people-watching is
recreation in itself."
One of the most popular dis
cos in the Bay Area has only one
thing in common with El Ran
cho: that same disco music.
Tingle's in San Mateo is not a
typical disco. In fact, the disco is
almost a side to the club-like
atmosphere that strikes you the
minute you walk in.
A multi-faceted establish
ment, Tingle's attracts all types,
from the curious tourist (Ting
le's is located in the Dunfey
Hotel) to the avid backgammon
player and the serious dancer.
A half an hour wait
On a Saturday night, expect a
half-hour wait just to get in.
Once past the elegantly dressed
doorman who makes sure that
no denim corduroy will ever
pass through the front door, it
may take a minute to find the
dance floor. It may even be a

hopeless cause to find a place to
sit, or even a corner to stand out
of the line of fire of the bustling
cocktail hostesses.
The attitude underlying Ting
le's is one of sophistication. The
regulars wear fashionably ex
pensive clothing; none of the
flashy tuxedos or sparkling
dresses are seen there.
People mingle as though they
were at an anonymous party
that just happened to have a
dance floor and some records.
Because Tingle's is part of a
hotel, it fills with many over
thirty customers, which may
partly explain the lack of dazzl
ing disco intensity.
That same intensity is also
lost in the sheer size of the
place. Rather than a high
charged disco or small club,
Tingle's is an expansive and
seemingly successful enter
tainment center.
