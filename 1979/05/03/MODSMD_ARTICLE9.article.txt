# Disco Is there life after polyester?
## 
### Norm Fill 
Much to the annoyance of persistent rockers and
folkies, the "decade of disco" is upon us. Whether or
not the craze reflects an erosion of national mores is
unclear. Yet one thing is certain: "disco" is
everywhere.
Department stores are lined with "disco" apparel,
Dick Clark pushes the beat on Saturday mornings to
teenagers weighing the virtues of Stridex over
Clearasil, and even Barbie and Ken have gotten the
pre-teen generation into the act. A slowing of this
tempo seems nowhere in sight.
The question remains: "Is disco a popular move
ment; or just a media hype?" Or more succinctly, are
disco patrons all mutant clones, or is there really
something to all this polyester?
Little academic research has been done on the
phenomenon. Several professors here contacted on
the matter had no comment, due to a lack of informa
tion or a general unwillingness to be associated with
the topic.
Yet a disco "expert," the proprietor of a local danc
ing establishment (who did not wish to be named),
theorized that disco's social atmosphere is its prim
ary draw.
"People like hearing good music on a good sound
system, and they love to dance."
When quizzed on the sophisticated aura dis
cotheques attempt to project, the proprietor said that
the gloss was simply a reflection of the tastes of
patrons.
"Our bar sales are a good indication of this," he
said. "We sell a lot more wine and Perrier than we
used to."
What about disco fashion? Our expert contends:
. . it's generally a question of current styles . . .
and besides, polyester is easy to keep clean."
Although disco has been around for years, its re
cent popularity is most certainly due to huge finan

cial investment.
Elite "bump houses" such as New York's Studio 54
and Regine's have added respectability to an other
wise kitschy reputation. Disco movies, disco
magazines, disco dresses, disco shoes and even disco
underwear are being marketed nationwide. Literally
everybody seems to be getting into the disco market.
Students here are ambivalent on the subject. At a
recent Sunday night showing of the film Saturday
Night Fever here, John Travolta's pelvic gyrations
brought cynical hoots of "disco sucks!"
Yet disco seems to be a love-hate relationship for
Stanfordites. A good portion of the crowd that Sun
day could attest to pulling many Travoltaesque
moves themselves the night before — both on and off
the dance floor.
Students who admit being turned off by the disco
craze most often cite the music's simplicity and blat
antly sexual lyrics as their chief peeves. One ven
tured that "Dancing is OK, but I just can't stand all
the Castro Street clone types at discotheques."
Those who viewed disco in a more favorable light
said they enjoyed the opportunity to people-watch.
"It's a chance to lose yourself in dance and costume,"
said one student who regularly goes disco-hopping.
The huge financial success of the disco industry
and the mass proliferation of the disco motif to other
businesses such as roller rinks and amusement cen
ters give conflicting indications of disco's future.
The craze could potentially develop into a new
American art form or decline as did bowling alleys
and the hula hoops of the '60s.
For the present, however, disco is here to stay.
Although we may see some metamorphosis of the
fad, it is unlikely that it will completely die out in the
near future.
While it appears that most will find this a com
pletely satisfying state of affairs, many will have to
resign themselves to being hustled.
