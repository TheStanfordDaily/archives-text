# Chavez: boycott working
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
Cesar Chavez, president of the United Farm Workers
(UFW), declared the current lettuce boycott a success
last night, saying that Americans are not buying lettuce
because "of all the bloodletting that has happened in
Imperial County."
Chavez' statement referred to the February shooting
of UFW striker Rufino Contreras by two Imperial County
farm workers and one replacement worker. Chavez cal
led the Contreras shooting "one of the most sorrowful
experiences" of his union career.
Chavez spoke extensively on the current UFW strike
against Sun Harvest, Inc., the largest U.S. lettuce pro
ducer. According to Chavez, the strike began last
January in response to contract disputes between let
tuce growers and workers.
Chavez told more than 400 people in Memorial Au
ditorium that inflation and insignificant wage raises have
resulted in "a standard of living for (lettuce) workers that
has increased only 13 cents an hour" in the last eight
years.
On the other hand, the UFW president noted, during
last November's contract negotiations between lettuce
growers and workers, the union negotiators "looked at
the other side of the ledger" and found that the
employer had been doing "quite well."
According to Chavez, lettuce consumption per capita
has risen, lettuce yield per acre has climbed, and lettuce
growers' profits have increased tenfold in the last eight
years.
During negotiations, representatives of h*ttuce grow
ers formed the Committee for Fair Negotiations Bet
ween Growers and Workers. In late January, several
days after workers' contracts expired, committee mem
bers announced that they would comply with President
Jimmy Carter's voluntary wage-price guidelines and
offer workers a 7 percent wage increase.

Chavez criticized this offer, saying that the growers
"knew 7 percent was totally inadequate." Describing the
bargain proposed by workers, Chavez said, "We will
abide by 7 percent provided you (growers) don't raise
lettuce prices over 7 percent."
Three days after the growers' otfer, the UFW workers
at California Coastal Farms went on strike. Calling the
dispute the "green strike," Chavez explained that at the
beginning of the UFW effort, "people were singing and
happy with a lot of anticipation and hope."
After eight or 10 days, however, the strikers "saw the
first dark clouds appearing." According to the union
leader, lettuce growers put together "a massive, profes
sional strike-breaking organization" composed of
members of the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi party
and armed guards.
At that point, Chavez said, "The green strike turned
into a local nightmare." The conflict between strikers
and strike-breakers culminated in the shooting of Con
treras on February 10.
Chavez compared the current strike and its violence
with previous strikes. He said, "I've been involved in
farm labor strikes for almost 30 years, as a laborer, an
organizer and as president. In that time, we've seen
unchecked violence and one-sided law enforcement."
Chavez continued: "We haven't been heard in the
Department of justice in a far-off place called
Washington and we haven't been heard locally." Ac
cording to the UFW president, union workers have few
alternatives and thus "need to go to what we call the
court of last resort — you, the general public."
Citing a Louis Harris survey, Chavez stated that "over
14 million people are boycotting lettuce." He urged
Americans to continue boycotting California iceberg let
tuce, saying, "If you buy it and eat it, it may harm you."
Chavez' speech was sponsored by Chicano Commun
ity as part of Cinco de Mayo celebrations.

Chavez compared the current strike and its violence
with previous strikes. He said, "I've been involved in
farm labor strikes for almost 30 years, as a laborer, an
organizer and as president. In that time, we've seen
unchecked violence and one-sided law enforcement."
Chavez continued: "We haven't been heard in the
Department of justice in a far-off place called
Washington and we haven't been heard locally." Ac
cording to the UFW president, union workers have few
alternatives and thus "need to go to what we call the
court of last resort — you, the general public."
Citing a Louis Harris survey, Chavez stated that "over
14 million people are boycotting lettuce." He urged
Americans to continue boycotting California iceberg let
tuce, saying, "If you buy it and eat it, it may harm you."
