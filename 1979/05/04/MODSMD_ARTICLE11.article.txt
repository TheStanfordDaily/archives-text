# Group helps alcohol's 'other victims'
## 
### Dave French Meg Ward 
"My father is an alcoholic."
This is a startling realization
for a number of students here
who have formed a support
group for people with al
coholic relatives, the 'other
victims' of alcoholism.
The group began its bi
monthly meetings last fall. Its
main objective is to gain insight
into this common but compli
cated problem by sharing in
formation and experiences.
"I tried talking to my room
mate and though she thought
she understood, I knew she re
ally couldn't do so without hav
ing lived through the experi
ences which I and the other
group members have had,"
remarked one member.
The group ranges from those
who are just beginning to deal
with their parent's illness and
have no idea how to do so, to
one person whose parent has
already been confronted,
recognized his illness and
joined Alcoholics Anonymous.
"I wanted to know how
others cope with the problem
in their families and to see if
there was anything I could

apply to my situation," expres
sed another member. "It got to
the point where I just didn't
want to deal with my family any
more. I wanted to escape
rather than face things at
home."
Three phases
The members have realized
that there are three phases to
conquering the problem: fac
ing it, understanding it and
learning how to deal with it.
Dr. Stephanie Brown, as
sociate director of the Stanford
Alcoholic Clinic, advises the
group and occasionally at
tends the meetings to offer her
professional opinion.
"Stephanie has helped me to
understand both the physical
and the psychological con
sequences of alcoholism," said
one member. According to
another, the group realizes
that "one of the most impor
tant things we have learned is
that alcoholism is a disease
which affects all members of
the family, and in order to deal
with it we must first help ourse
lves."
One thing the group has
learned is that alcoholism can
have very serious effects upon
the children of alcoholics.

Brown said that of the esti
mated 30 to 40 million children
in the United States whose pa
rents have drinking problems,
most fall into one of two
categories: the "superkids"
and the "delinquents."
Superkids
The superkids tend to be
overcompensating individuals
who are hypersensitive to the
needs of others. According to
Brown, a superkid due to an
unpredictable parent in the
home environment, has prob
lems forming a sound basis for
reality and often does not
enjoy achievement; rather,
superiority is a matter of survi
val and the child finds it im
perative to be a high achiever.
On the other hand, delin
quent children often do very
poorly in school. This stems
from their having a poor self
concept and being easily frus
trated. Brown said these
people often have trouble
making friends or trusting
other individuals.
Because of the statistically
high correlation between chil
dren of alcoholics and problem
drinkers,members of the
group are aware that they

could easily develop drinking
problems. One is now a
member of Alcoholics
Anonymous, another com
pletely abstains from liquor
consumption and others say
that they are overly conscious
at parties and do not allow
themselves to get drunk.
Frustration
That is one reason why the
group was formed, a member
said. Though the nature of the
meetings has tended toward
the venting of confusing frust
rations, members say the out-

come has been for all to gain a
more objective perspective of
their own situations.
When asked why other
people who have alcoholic re
latives should join, one person
said, "I used to think I had an
unsolvable problem and was
embarrassed and at times
ashamed. It is amazing how
communication with peers has
made being the child of an al
coholic less hopeless. The
problem is still there, but now I
know it's not just my prob
lem."
