# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Steve Barkan Slain protesters honored 
### 
This week evokes sad, poignant memories for
someone who was a college student way back in
the spring of 1970. In this week nine years ago,
the United States invaded Cambodia, students
were killed and wounded at Kent State and
Jackson State universities, and campuses across
the country went on strike in protest. Now, nine
years later, the first week in May is also Peace
Week here, prompting some thoughts on how
far we have come as a nation from that bitter
week and, in many ways, how little we've
changed.
On April 30,1970 then-U.S.. resident Richard
Nixon invaded Cambodia with American troops.
Heannounced on television this "incursion," as
he steadfastly called it, saying the United States
would not act like a "pitiful, helpless giant." The
speech he gave that night was ignoble; he spoke
once again of the need to save this country's
credibility, displaying charts and maps that
pointed out huge North Vietnamese sanctuaries
that were never to be found.
Before the invasion, Cambodia had been a
virtual paradise, a rare marvel of nature from an
age that has too swiftly passed us by. Nixon
changed all that, turning Cambodia into a waste
land. Shamelessly, in his memoirs and public
appearances he continues to call the Cambodia
invasion one of the proudest and most courage
ous acts of his presidency.
Four days after the invasion, four students
were shot down at Kent State and several others
wounded, one paralyzed for life. I was a college
freshman then and will never forget the shock
and numbness my friends and I felt upon hear
ing the news, never forget the picture of the
young woman screaming helplessly while bent
over the body of one of the Kent State dead.

The same feeling tore at me two days later
when two students were shot to death at
Jackson State in Mississippi. I heard a radio re
cording that I will hear forever, of 30 seconds of
bullets bursting into the dorm at the Jackson
State campus. Each second seemed much more
than that; the whole world was out of its mind.
My own campus, as well as many others in the
nation, went on strike. Hundreds of students at
my school went to workshops and teach-ins in
stead of classes and gathered thousands of sig
natures on petitions protesting the war. It was
an incredible 10 days of shared grief and com
mitment and struggle that changed my life.
(Ironically, I discovered in a Freedom of Infor
mation Act request six years later that a govern
ment informant had attended many of the work
shops and dutifully reported my presence there
to the FBI.)
All that is behind us now. The United States is
no longer at war in Southeast Asia, and the
deaths at Kent and Jackson State become more
distant, if still burning, memories with each pas
sing year.
But the military still remains, with ever
increasing arsenals of nuclear weapons. Con
gress is acting swiftly on bills to renew registra
tion and conscription; it forgets so easily the
impact of the draft on the lives of youths and the
affairs of the nation during the Vietnam years.
That is why Peace Week at Stanford is so hear
tening. Students who organized Peace Week
and other recent activities against conscription
and the military deserve our thanks. They refuse
to be guilty of the crime of silence by letting the
protests and deaths on campuses nine years ago
go in vain.
