## Fraternity images based on reality 
### 
I wouldn't want to distort the truth,
cloud the issue, or do anything else de
spicable, so I'll come right out and admit
it: I'm one of those people who
stereotypes fraternities. Blatantly and at
times intolerantly. When I told my mother,
she cried.
But at least she was sympathetic. Kurt
Osenbaugh (Daily, May 1) doesn't seem to
realize that we stereotypers really can't
help ourselves. Just when we're almost
cured, just when we've decided that
fraternities might be a legitimate and de
sirable alternative for a residential experi
ence, the frats do something or other and
sadistically force us right back into our
wretched and bigoted attitudes.
Those attitudes stretch back to our ear
liest moments of consciousness:
freshman orientation. The frat party in
vitations under the door of only those
women who had attractive froshbook pic
tures. The slobbering macho types slink
ing around the dining hall, hoping to have
the "first crack" at the women destined to
be their "Little Sisters" (or worse).
Now if there had been non-fraternity
men doing the same kinds of things,
perhaps the seeds of my sick attitude
would never have been planted. But,
funny, I didn't see any.
To be fair, I guess those actions really
weren't so bad (unless you were a woman,
of course). After all, they were just part of
the "good times fraternities have to

gether" that Osenbaugh eulogized last
time he took to the papers {Daily, October
8).
I myself saw one of those "good times"
my very first weekend here, when I was
standing in line at Jack-in-the-Box with
people from my dorm. Members of a
fraternity here entered, and one of them
proceeded immediately and without for
mal introduction to pick up one of my
female companions. Literally. He walked
away with her slung over his shoulder as
his "brothers" cheered wildly. Good
times.
From such meager beginnings, my dis
ease of stereotyping has only escalated.
I've watched the Delts be unstereotypi
cally kicked off campus for the second (or
was it the third) time; I've seen fraternities
steal froshbooks during orientation in
panting profusion; I've bowled intramur
als with fraternity members and observed
how many barely grunt at their opponents
and how they with great machismo flip off
the pins that don't fall down.
Honest, I've tried to change my bigoted
ways. When one fraternity's kitchen was
tragically demolished this year, its mem
bers ate at my dorm complex for quite
some time. I resolved to prove to myself
that they really were a diverse group of
individuals, as the rush book so aptly puts
it. I sat down with them for lunch and
quietly watched them stage a belching
contest and collectively snicker at "pursu

ing poontang." Good times. Diverse.
Another effort to change gone to hell.
It's no surprise, though, that Osen
baugh can't understand my resentment.
Just as the fraternity system as a whole fails
to recognize that it is the frats which create
the negative image of fraternities, Osen
baugh cannot discern his own role in the
creation of that image. He decries as un
true that "fraternity people feel somehow
superior to . . . those who aren't part of
the Greek system."
But back in the fall, he himself wrote a
column (Daily, Octobers) the underlying
premise of which was that only fraternities
have fun. ("It's our specialty. Fun has a
place even at Stanford.") An attitude of
smug superiority oozed from that column,
and now Osenbaugh wonders when some
of the slime comes back postage due.
Oh, I realize that not every fraternity
member fits the enormity of my
stereotype, and I know about and admire
the functions frats hold for charity, but
even that doesn't help my sickness. My
little bigoted brain just won't let me forget
the countless times I've seen fraternities
acting as a group completely without con
cern for others. They're set up to do that,
they're proud of doing it, and they can
only react defensively when someone
suggests they might stop.

I myself saw one of those "good times"
my very first weekend here, when I was
standing in line at Jack-in-the-Box with
people from my dorm. Members of a
fraternity here entered, and one of them
proceeded immediately and without for
mal introduction to pick up one of my
female companions. Literally. He walked
away with her slung over his shoulder as
his "brothers" cheered wildly. Good
times.
From such meager beginnings, my dis
ease of stereotyping has only escalated.
I've watched the Delts be unstereotypi
cally kicked off campus for the second (or
was it the third) time; I've seen fraternities
steal froshbooks during orientation in
panting profusion; I've bowled intramur
als with fraternity members and observed
how many barely grunt at their opponents
and how they with great machismo flip off
the pins that don't fall down.
Honest, I've tried to change my bigoted
ways. When one fraternity's kitchen was
tragically demolished this year, its mem
bers ate at my dorm complex for quite
some time. I resolved to prove to myself
that they really were a diverse group of
individuals, as the rush book so aptly puts
it. I sat down with them for lunch and
quietly watched them stage a belching
contest and collectively snicker at "pursu

ing poontang." Good times. Diverse.
Another effort to change gone to hell.
It's no surprise, though, that Osen
baugh can't understand my resentment.
Just as the fraternity system as a whole fails
to recognize that it is the frats which create
the negative image of fraternities, Osen
baugh cannot discern his own role in the
creation of that image. He decries as un
true that "fraternity people feel somehow
superior to . . . those who aren't part of
the Greek system."
But back in the fall, he himself wrote a
column (Daily, Octobers) the underlying
premise of which was that only fraternities
have fun. ("It's our specialty. Fun has a
place even at Stanford.") An attitude of
smug superiority oozed from that column,
and now Osenbaugh wonders when some
of the slime comes back postage due.
Oh, I realize that not every fraternity
member fits the enormity of my
stereotype, and I know about and admire
the functions frats hold for charity, but
even that doesn't help my sickness. My
little bigoted brain just won't let me forget
the countless times I've seen fraternities
acting as a group completely without con
cern for others. They're set up to do that,
they're proud of doing it, and they can
only react defensively when someone
suggests they might stop.

I wouldn't want to distort the truth,
cloud the issue, or do anything else de
spicable, so I'll come right out and admit
it: I'm one of those people who
stereotypes fraternities. Blatantly and at
times intolerantly. When I told my mother,
she cried.
But at least she was sympathetic. Kurt
Osenbaugh (Daily, May 1) doesn't seem to
realize that we stereotypers really can't
help ourselves. Just when we're almost
cured, just when we've decided that
fraternities might be a legitimate and de
sirable alternative for a residential experi
ence, the frats do something or other and
sadistically force us right back into our
wretched and bigoted attitudes.
Those attitudes stretch back to our ear
liest moments of consciousness:
freshman orientation. The frat party in
vitations under the door of only those
women who had attractive froshbook pic
tures. The slobbering macho types slink
ing around the dining hall, hoping to have
the "first crack" at the women destined to
be their "Little Sisters" (or worse).
Now if there had been non-fraternity
men doing the same kinds of things,
perhaps the seeds of my sick attitude
would never have been planted. But,
funny, I didn't see any.
To be fair, I guess those actions really
weren't so bad (unless you were a woman,
of course). After all, they were just part of
the "good times fraternities have to

gether" that Osenbaugh eulogized last
time he took to the papers {Daily, October
8).
