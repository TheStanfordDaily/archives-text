# Thatcher rolling to victory in British election

London (AP) —Margaret Thatcher's Con
servatives scored upsets in urban stron
gholds of the governing Laborites and
surged toward victory on a tide of rural votes
early today in Britain's general elections.
Computer projections indicated a comfort
able Conservative majority in the House of
Commons.
Screaming well-wishers mobbed
Thatcher. She responded, "I am cautiously
optimistic."
With results in from 400 of the 635 par
liamentary districts, Labor had 197 seats but
showed an overall loss of 22. The Conserva
tives had an overall gain of 31 seats for 193
and surged ahead in the popular vote from
yesterday's election.
The Scottish National Party had won only
two seats while losing six, and other minor
parties won three seats and lost two.
A total of 318 is needed for a majority.
Computer projections by two British news
organizations predicted Thatcher
would become Europe's first woman prime

minister with a majority of 40-43 seats in the
635-seat House of Commons, ending five
years of rule by Prime Minister James Cal
laghan's Labor Party.
In the popular vote from 400 districts, the
Conservatives had 7,911,190 —42.3 percent;
Labor 7,258,847 — 39.7 percent; Liberals
2,365,275 —12.9 percent, and others 735,513
— 4.1 percent.
In the last election in October 1974, Labor
gained 39.3 percent of the votes and that
gave them 319 seats in Commons—a major
ity of two.
The returns, laboriously counted by hand,
showed a 74.8 percent turnout, with about
30 million of 41 million registered voters
casting ballots.
"We never count our chickens before
they are hatched, and we don't count No. 10
Downing St. before it is thatched," quipped
Thatcher, a champion of free enter
prise, when asked if she was confident of
winning. No. 10 Downing St. is the address
of the prime minister's residence.

Callaghan and his wife, Audrey, cast their
ballots at a primary school near their apart
ment in his Cardiff, Wales, constituency,
and he told reporters, "I know I have two
votes, that is if Audrey voted for me."
Five opinion polls published Election Day
gave Thatcher's Conservative Party leads
ranging from 2 to 8 percentage points. The
nation's legal bookmakers reported heavy
wagering in favor of the Tories, including
one bet of 20,000 pounds ($40,000). Stock
prices nudged record highs on hopes the
party that traditionally backs big business
would win.
An electorate of 41,093,262 was eligible to
cast ballots for the new Commons. The party
that wins the most seats will be asked by
Queen Elizabeth II to form a government. It
will hold power for up to five years, until it
calls a new election.
Few women in modern history have led
their nations' governments. Sirimavo Ban
daranaike was prime minister of Sri Lanka in
1960-65 and 1970-77; Indira Gandi served as

prime minister of India in 1966-77; Golda
Meir was Israel's prime minister in 1969-74,
and Isabel Peron was president of Argentina
in 1974-76.
Callaghan fought an uphill battle since a
vote of no-confidence brought about a dis
solution of Commons in March. Labor won
319 seats, a majority, in the last election, in
October 1974. But deaths, by-elections and
party defections eventually cut that number
to 306, and Callaghan had depended on the
support of the Liberals and other small par
ties to stay in power.
The campaign was waged mainly over the
pocketbook issues of jobs—l.3 million Bri
tons are out of work,
Thatcher, Conservative chief since
1975, contended government should take a
back seat in the nation's economic affairs
and allow freer play for basic market forces.
She scoffed at Callaghan's record on main
taining labor peace and pointed to last wint
er's series of disruptive public-service
strikes.
