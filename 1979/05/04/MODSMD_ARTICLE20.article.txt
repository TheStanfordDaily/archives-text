## Control your life through radicalism 
### 
Radical ideas threaten
everyone. Not because they're
illogical or demagogic, they
seldom are. They are danger
ous because they are generally
true.
Our government really isn't
by the people and for the
people. Our society is control
led by a white male elite. That
elite's narrow self-interest and
limited conception of human

ity has given us nuclear energy,
the rigid nuclearfamily and the
horror of nuclear war.
This sounds like rhetoric,
doesn't it? Ah, that's good,
now you don't have to examine
it and ask yourself, honestly,
just how much truth is there. If
you did you might find all too
much truth. You would have to
change your life.
The threat radicalism poses
for most people is how much
easier it is to accept the system
as it is. Women in their place,
nuclear weapons in their sub
marines, executives in their
boardrooms, workers work
ing, children seen but not
heard. Yet again and again
people resist. They look to the
root of their problems (hence
"radical") and decide that it is
the whole system that must
change.
Let's take an example. You
are deeply concerned about
nuclear power and weapons.
You go to guest Prof. Daniel
Ellsberg's class; he runs down
in incredible detail the insanity
of the arms race, the connec
tions between business and
governmental decision mak
ers, the consistent public lies
by every level of the federal
bureaucracy.
You can't just accept these
arguments — this radical
critique — and not act on it. If
you really believe it you are
forced to act, and to act in ways
that will change your life. It
may start with demonstrations,
rallies, fights with roommates
and parents, but the process is
open-ended. There is always
more to be done.
If you relentlessly seek the
truth you may very well find
yourself a radical, in jail, on the
picket lines or on countless
government lists. Struggling

with a few others, or a million
others, for something better,
something . . . like control of
your life.
This is dangerous stuff.
Changing your life is not easy.
Becoming a radical is a Pando
ra's box. You may just be
against nuclear energy, or
maybe the draft, but the
people you meet working on
the same issue — why, they're
against everything, it seems:
the government, women as ob
jects, Pinto cars, the invasion
of Timor, the United States as
an imperial power, chemicals
in hamburgers, even hambur
gers themselves. This is ex
tremism.
There are many defenses
against this spectre of
radicalism and the personal
commitment it demands. Vou
can attack the radicals. That's
easy enough since they are
human and hence can be
egotistical, inconsistent,
simplistic and elitist. This suf
fices for many people. But it
isn't a complete solution. It
doesn't hide the problems: ra
cism, sexism, war, the very
death of our planet. So most
people try other forms of self
deception.
I've even read articles in the
Daily claiming solar power is
more dangerous than nuclear
power. I can't help thinking of
royalists in late 18th century
France. Oh, for the good old
days when the CIA had a free
rein, presidents had our re
spect, women knew their place
(as did everyone else), homos
kept to their closets and on and
on.
Those good old days never
existed, any more than there
was really a divine right of
kings. The CIA had to kill, pres
idents set up institutions like

the CIA to force respect,
women were beaten, gays (in
deed all sexuality) was vici
ously (think about that word)
repressed. The divine right of
kings died on the guillotine.
The American empire, the U.S.
government itself, sexual rep
ression, they will end too in an
analogous fashion. As socialists
say in )amaica "Better Must
Come." If it doesn't, it will all
be over.
The most common defense
(especially here on the "Farm")
is cynicism. "Sure things are
bad but what can we do?
What's the use? "I'm not going
to make a big point of how
much change just one person
can make. What is important is
that when you go beyond the
defenses, when you really go
looking forthe truth and act on
what you find, then you are
free, then you are in control of
your life just by seeking that
control.
Vou can organize your life as
you see fit. No need to be a
lawyer, instead go grow or
ganic tomatoes. No need to
sleep with men if women is
what you prefer (and vice-versa
of course). No need to go to
classes — or school either, if
you'd rather get stoned, play
soccer, carve wood, or learn in
a different way.
It is your life; we each get
only one; if you don't take con
trol of it someone else will.
Someone probably not very
nice. They may want you to kill
Asians, or design weapons, or
sell toilet paper, orwho knows
what. Why do it? Why do you
do the things you do?
If you can't answer that ques
tion happily, quickly, looking
in the mirror. . . .Well, maybe
you're due for a change.

existed, any more than there
was really a divine right of
kings. The CIA had to kill, pres
idents set up institutions like

the CIA to force respect,
women were beaten, gays (in
deed all sexuality) was vici
ously (think about that word)
repressed. The divine right of
kings died on the guillotine.
The American empire, the U.S.
government itself, sexual rep
ression, they will end too in an
analogous fashion. As socialists
say in )amaica "Better Must
Come." If it doesn't, it will all
be over.
The most common defense
(especially here on the "Farm")
is cynicism. "Sure things are
bad but what can we do?
What's the use? "I'm not going
to make a big point of how
much change just one person
can make. What is important is
that when you go beyond the
defenses, when you really go
looking forthe truth and act on
what you find, then you are
free, then you are in control of
your life just by seeking that
control.
Vou can organize your life as
you see fit. No need to be a
lawyer, instead go grow or
ganic tomatoes. No need to
sleep with men if women is
what you prefer (and vice-versa
of course). No need to go to
classes — or school either, if
you'd rather get stoned, play
soccer, carve wood, or learn in
a different way.
It is your life; we each get
only one; if you don't take con
trol of it someone else will.
Someone probably not very
nice. They may want you to kill
Asians, or design weapons, or
sell toilet paper, orwho knows
what. Why do it? Why do you
do the things you do?
If you can't answer that ques
tion happily, quickly, looking
in the mirror. . . .Well, maybe
you're due for a change.

Radical ideas threaten
everyone. Not because they're
illogical or demagogic, they
seldom are. They are danger
ous because they are generally
true.
Our government really isn't
by the people and for the
people. Our society is control
led by a white male elite. That
elite's narrow self-interest and
limited conception of human

ity has given us nuclear energy,
the rigid nuclearfamily and the
horror of nuclear war.
This sounds like rhetoric,
doesn't it? Ah, that's good,
now you don't have to examine
it and ask yourself, honestly,
just how much truth is there. If
you did you might find all too
much truth. You would have to
change your life.
The threat radicalism poses
for most people is how much
easier it is to accept the system
as it is. Women in their place,
nuclear weapons in their sub
marines, executives in their
boardrooms, workers work
ing, children seen but not
heard. Yet again and again
people resist. They look to the
root of their problems (hence
"radical") and decide that it is
the whole system that must
change.
Let's take an example. You
are deeply concerned about
nuclear power and weapons.
You go to guest Prof. Daniel
Ellsberg's class; he runs down
in incredible detail the insanity
of the arms race, the connec
tions between business and
governmental decision mak
ers, the consistent public lies
by every level of the federal
bureaucracy.
You can't just accept these
arguments — this radical
critique — and not act on it. If
you really believe it you are
forced to act, and to act in ways
that will change your life. It
may start with demonstrations,
rallies, fights with roommates
and parents, but the process is
open-ended. There is always
more to be done.
If you relentlessly seek the
truth you may very well find
yourself a radical, in jail, on the
picket lines or on countless
government lists. Struggling

with a few others, or a million
others, for something better,
something . . . like control of
your life.
This is dangerous stuff.
Changing your life is not easy.
Becoming a radical is a Pando
ra's box. You may just be
against nuclear energy, or
maybe the draft, but the
people you meet working on
the same issue — why, they're
against everything, it seems:
the government, women as ob
jects, Pinto cars, the invasion
of Timor, the United States as
an imperial power, chemicals
in hamburgers, even hambur
gers themselves. This is ex
tremism.
There are many defenses
against this spectre of
radicalism and the personal
commitment it demands. Vou
can attack the radicals. That's
easy enough since they are
human and hence can be
egotistical, inconsistent,
simplistic and elitist. This suf
fices for many people. But it
isn't a complete solution. It
doesn't hide the problems: ra
cism, sexism, war, the very
death of our planet. So most
people try other forms of self
deception.
I've even read articles in the
Daily claiming solar power is
more dangerous than nuclear
power. I can't help thinking of
royalists in late 18th century
France. Oh, for the good old
days when the CIA had a free
rein, presidents had our re
spect, women knew their place
(as did everyone else), homos
kept to their closets and on and
on.
Those good old days never
existed, any more than there
