Minorities sought
Last quarter the Daily asked
various student groups to es
tablish an advisory committee
to work with the newspaper on
its coverage of women and
minorities.
Our committee has now met
twice and is formulating
guidelines on these issues to
be considered by the Daily.

Unfortunately, we have rep
resentatives from only five
groups so far. Our committee
would be strengthened by rep
resentation from the Black
Students' Union, MEChA, the
Asian-American Students As
sociation, and the Stanford
American Indian Organization.
We would like to invite these
and any other minority groups

to the committee's next meet
ing. We plan to meet on Sun
day, May 5, at 3:30 p.m in the
business office of the Daily.
Any letters to the committee
can be sent to P.O. Box 5145,
Stanford.

Stilwell maligned
After reading the April 17tf
Daily article entitled "Univer
sity continues Stilwell investi
gation," we feel that Dr.
Donald Stilwell was gravely
misrepresented before the
Stanford community. Having
known Dr. Stilwell for three
years, we are familiar with his
policies and are appalled by
the distortions printed in the
article.
Never in our experience has
he publicly or privately rep
resented himself to students as
an official University advisor.
Nor has he solicited his ser
vices at public meetings to
which he .. invited. In fact, at a
February 7 Premedical Society
MCAT meeting, Dr. Stilwell
encouraged students to "con
sult their premedical advisors"
on other aspects of the applica
tion process. Students ap
proach Stilwell as a consultant
strictly on a voluntary basis,
and he adheres rigidly to this
policy.
We would also like to clarify
the statement that he has
suggested students " 'show
up' at medical schools without
an interview." It is true that Dr.
Stilwell encourages students to
visit medical schools, but these
visits are for informational

purposes only. He insists that
students notify each medical
school well in advance of their
scheduled arrival, and that at
no time should the students
request an interview.
On the other hand, the
Academic Information Center
in its "Premedical Student
Checklist" for 1978-79, advises
students to visit medical
schools without scheduled in
terviews but neglects to in
struct students to write in ad
vance of their visits. The trust
ing students who follow the
AlC's advice would just "show
up" at a school, evoking the
wrath of that medical school's
administration and staining the
reputation of all premeds here.
After three years of contact
wi f h Dr. Stilwell, we are con
vinced that his knowledge of
medical school admissions is
sound and valuable to stu
dents. We are sorry to see an
unselfish man who gives so
much of his time to premedical
students represented so un
fairly.

Wall destroyed
I am not antifraternity. I even
encouraged several of my
freshman friends to participate
in this year's rush. I do not like
stereotypes of any kind.
But how does one react to
the recent burning of Theta
Chi's People's Wall of Democ
racy? I was a witness to the first
attempt to steal tne wall at
10:45 p.m. on April 25.

As I was walking past Theta
Chi, a rented bus pulled up and
five people got out and ran ac
ross the street. They were not
content to merely steal the
wall. They first knocked it
down and jumped up and
down on it like two-year-olds
throwing temper tantrums.
After venting their emotions
on the sign, they drunkenly
carried it across the street to
the bus. In trying to put the
wall in the bus, several people
got out to help whom I recog
nized as KAs. Efforts to put the
wall in the bus failed. People
from Theta Chi came out and
rescued the sign. The bus
drove off with the people
screaming they were DU's.
Then I read (Daily, May 2)

that five KA pledges were
caught trying to steal the sign.
Then the sign is torched. The
circumstantial evidence is very
damaging to the KA image. It
doesn't say much for southern
hospitality.
As for what to do about t ?se
fun little fraternity prar>' , I
leave that to Theta Chi and the
Office of Residential Education
to decide. I find the whole af
fair a pretty surprising thing for
anyone over 12 years old to do.

More for our $$
I was delighted to read about
the University's decision to in
crease the size of the Stanford

diploma by 95 percent (Daily,
May 2).
In the face of perennial tui
tion increases, I hope the Uni
versity will continue "to find
ways to give us more for our
money.
