# Pete McCloskey
## Come discuss the draft 
### 
I hope everyone at the University who is con
cerned about the shortcomings of the All-
Volunteer Force and the possible reinstitution
of some form of conscription will attend the
debate on National Youth Service on May 5 at 4
p.m. in Bishop Auditorium.
As you know, none of us favors resumption of
the draft unless there is clear evidence that the
volunteer army concept is not working. In fact,
the concept isn't working. Responsible young
people are no longer volunteering in sufficient
numbers to meet minimum force level require
ments. This is particularly true in the reserves,
where seven out of 10 enlistees are dropping out
before completing their tours of duty,.
One option would be to add billions of dollars
to the defense budget and increase pay incen
tives. The problem with this approach is that no
one can be sure that higher salaries will attract
sufficient rtumbers of enlistees. At a recent
meeting in Palo Alto, for example, when I asked

several hundred young people if they would
volunteer for military service if the salaries of
junior enlisted personnel were doubled from
the present rate of $419 per month, not one
hand was raised.
Clearly, our armed services are no longer rep
resentative of the nation as a whole. Should
there be a conflict, either in Europe or the Mid
dle East, combat casualties would likely be more
than 50 percent black and Mexican-American.
Please be assured that I share your hope that
the draft need not be reinstituted. In view of
your strong feelings, I would welcome your
suggestions as to how my own National Youth
Service plan might be changed or amended. The
whole purpose behind my bill is to provide the
most reasonable alternative to a straight military
draft.
See you Saturday.
