Time
Poems by Yehuda Amichai
Harper and Row $9.95
Time, by Yehuda Amichai, contains poems from the heart,
songs of the man and Israel. Struggle is their mutual existence.
Amichai makes us feel what is lost and what continues through
experience.
Translating his own poetry from the Hebrew, Amichai shares
the perceptions of another culture while retaining the subtleties
of the original meaning.

The soldiers in the grave say: You above
who place wreaths on us,
like a life preserver made of flowers,
regard our faces so alike
between our outstretched arms. But
remember the difference there was between us
and the joy on the surface of the water.
Each poem is the meditation of a real person who loves life and
is willing to suffer for it:

... I want once more to have this longing
until dark red burn marks show in the skin.
I want once more to be written
in the book of life, to be written
anew every day
until the writing hand hurts.
As the title suggests, the theme of the passage of time fills the
poetry, leaving me with its sense as I put away the book. The
poetry is confessional, hjt includes the world around the
speaker.
Amichai seems to consider himself more a bard than a
craftsman, so that his poetry is unstructured. Sometimes surreal,
connections between stanzas are masked, bringing the reader
into the creative process. Each strophe presents a unique percep
tion, almost a new poem.
The poet focuses our attention on words which lend a musical
quality to his vivid imagery, although he maintains the plain style
characteristic of much of contemporary poetry. The works are
meant to be read aloud.
Political, religious and historical comments fill Time. As an
Israeli Jew, Amichai feels very much a part of his heritage, of his
home.

Jerusalem is a cradle city rocking me.
Whenever I wake up strange things happen to me
in the middle of the day, as though to someone
descending the stairs of his love's house
for the last time, with eyes still closed.
But my days force me to open my eyes and
to remember everyone passing me: Perhaps
he'll love me, perhaps he has planted a bomb
wrapped in nice paper like a present of love.
I observe all the weak spots in these stone houses,
the crack through which electricity enters,
the hole pierced for waterpipes,
the cunt for telephone wires to penetrate
and the mouths of sighs.
I am a Jerusalemite. Swimming pools with
their voices and noises are no part of my soul.
The dust is my conscious, the stone my subconscious,
and all my memories are closed courtyards
at summer's high noon.
And above all is the quest for peace, perhaps seen through the
end of love, or the solitary ambling toward death. Sometimes this
is presented sexually, shocking us; in other poems we feel the
gentleness of haiku. We see ourselves in the person of Amichai â€”
poet and soldier, lover and seeker. His memories reflect ours; his
struggle becomes our own.
