Ways of the Hand
David Sudnow
Bantam $2.95
Sudnow's book claims to
be a psychological study of the
learning process; the example
which Sudnow uses to propel
his work is his experiences in
learning to play jazz piano. As
such the book could be clas
sified under music, education,
or psychology — its value in
any of these categories strikes
me as being equally specious.
Sudnow's description of the
process of learning to play jazz
piano (and I am commenting
from the standpoint of a
teacher who has supervised
the jazz studies of many aspir
ing pianists) does not appear to
be an accurate representation
of what the learning musician
actually goes through. Jazz
musicians are not Pavlov's
dogs; Sudnow emphasizes the

conditioned responses of the
musician in the course of his
improvisations and often neg
lects the more creative and in
tellectual side of improvisa
tion. .
His descriptions, I should
make clear, are not without
merit. Some of his insights on
the difficulties of the jazz craft
reveal a sensitive understand
ing of what makes a good
musician. The book lapses
when he describes how these
techniques are acquired. From
that point on it is difficult to
separate the fact from the fic
tion, the useful from the use
less.
The work was originally pub
lished by Harvard University
Press, and one cannot help
wonder on what grounds they
accepted the work. The work is
by no means a failure — certain
chapters (in particular one on

pianist Jimmy Rowles) arequite
interesting — but certainly it
cannot be considered "scho
larly" in any real sense.
The really enlightening
books on this subject hitherto
published have been, for bet
ter or worse, written by jazz
musicians or scholars.
Hampton Hawes' biography,
as well as critical works by
Whitney Balliett, John Meha
gen, and Leroi Jones have all
added to our knowledge of the
sociological and creative fac
tors involved in jazz.
There is certainly room for
such a study from a purely
sociological or psychological
viewpoint. Unfortunately Ways
of the Hand has only hinted at
what such a study could offer.
Perhaps Sudnow's promised
sequel will give this potentially
exciting field the careful treat
ment it deserves.

Myth and Meaning
Claude Levi-Strauss
If a writer's worth were
gauged by the controversy and
commentary he has created,
then Claude Levi-Strauss
would have already been as
sured of an important place in
intellectual history. This con
cise work, recently made avail
able in paperback, should go a
long way toward clarifying
many of Levi-Strauss's often
misunderstood positions.
In December 1977 this noted
French anthropologist gave a
series of five lectures over
Canadian radio. These il
luminating lectures have been
collected under the title Myth
and Meaning. This highly read
able book is an important addi
