Desperadoes
Ron Hansen
Alfred A. Knopf
273 pp. $8.95
With Desperadoes, a cap
tivating first novel by Ron Han
sen, English Dept. lecturer,
you can saddle up and ride
along with the notorious Dal
ton gang as they raid their way
across the Old West into his
tory books and early graves.
Told by outlaw Emmett Dal
ton, youngest brother and
single survivor of the tragic
Coffeyville Kansas hold-up,
Hansen's narrative celebrates
the tough, desperate, often
apprehensive story of life out
side the law. The extraordinary
part of this already
entertaining Western is the
consistency Hansen maintains
by using Emmett's voice.
"His (Emmett's) use of words
was not my own," explained
Hansen. "I started the book
several times using third per
son but I couldn't figure out
who was telling the story or
why. Then I decided to use the
fact that Emmett had lived for
40 years himself after the gang
was gunned down."
"From there, I could get into
his voice much like an actor

getting into sombody else's
role. It became more lively for
me, more interesting," he said.
In this way, a character such
as older brother Bob Dalton,
the leader of the gang and the
book's most romantic figure, is
described by Emmett:
"a stranger to me and for
several months working with
him I was wasn't sure that I
liked him very much. But there
was an innocence and good
faith to him that was convinc
ing. He could be very sincere
and intense about things and
you discovered yourself seeing
the world through his eyes and
forgetting everything else."
Another brother, Crat, who
Emmett tells us is "tough as a
night in jail," but unfortunately
"dumb as a salt lick" proves
Hansen's swift, easy ability to
crystalize a character in the
reader's mind through im
aginative use of metaphor.
Then there is Miss Eugenia
Moore, originally known as
Florence Quick. Brains behind
most of the Dalton robberies,
and Bob's lover, Eugenia is
perhaps Hansen's finest crea
tion. He draws from a few
sketchy historical facts the por
trait of a woman who is com
mitted to finding excitement
and security in the badlands by
joining up with the Daiton
gang. It's in the sparse, witty
dialogue that we come to know
Eugenia. She tells Bob, "I hate
the name Florence. It sounds
like I crochet and gossip and
succumb in the afternoon to
hot flashes. •
"Whereas I hear you've rus
tled saddle stock and cattle and
you came to Silver City after a
chase," returns Bob.
Hansen breaks the rules
when it comes to giving us in
formation Emmett just couldn't

have had. Sometimes there is
an explanation for this; other
times passages slide by. But the
flow of the story is never made
false in giving Emmett access to
other characters' conversa
tions and thoughts. It's as if
Emmett tells us things that are
common knowledge among
the gang anyway.

One refreshing note is that
Hansen doesn't allow any
major discussions of "right and
wrong"to bog down his book.
"Looking at all these events
through Emmett's eyes was
fascinating to me because I
could do it without the conven
tional morality involved," he
said. "Emmett is an involved
conspirator without much re
morse, though he does try to
explain away a lot of his ac
tions. That saved me from deal
ing with a lot of judgmental
passages," said Hansen.
"The writing itself went
quickly for me after doing the
research. I like to write about
action more than cerebral
things," he said.
Desperadoes is that kind of
tight, action-filled story with
real characters who invite you
to read along and live the Old
West as outlaws did. It's a fun
ride.

Desperadoes
Ron Hansen
Alfred A. Knopf
273 pp. $8.95
With Desperadoes, a cap
tivating first novel by Ron Han
sen, English Dept. lecturer,
you can saddle up and ride
along with the notorious Dal
ton gang as they raid their way
across the Old West into his
tory books and early graves.
Told by outlaw Emmett Dal
ton, youngest brother and
single survivor of the tragic
Coffeyville Kansas hold-up,
Hansen's narrative celebrates
the tough, desperate, often
apprehensive story of life out
side the law. The extraordinary
part of this already
entertaining Western is the
consistency Hansen maintains
by using Emmett's voice.
"His (Emmett's) use of words
was not my own," explained
Hansen. "I started the book
several times using third per
son but I couldn't figure out
who was telling the story or
why. Then I decided to use the
fact that Emmett had lived for
40 years himself after the gang
was gunned down."
"From there, I could get into
his voice much like an actor

getting into sombody else's
role. It became more lively for
me, more interesting," he said.
In this way, a character such
as older brother Bob Dalton,
the leader of the gang and the
book's most romantic figure, is
described by Emmett:
"a stranger to me and for
several months working with
him I was wasn't sure that I
liked him very much. But there
was an innocence and good
faith to him that was convinc
ing. He could be very sincere
and intense about things and
you discovered yourself seeing
the world through his eyes and
forgetting everything else."
Another brother, Crat, who
Emmett tells us is "tough as a
night in jail," but unfortunately
"dumb as a salt lick" proves
Hansen's swift, easy ability to
crystalize a character in the
reader's mind through im
aginative use of metaphor.
Then there is Miss Eugenia
Moore, originally known as
Florence Quick. Brains behind
most of the Dalton robberies,
and Bob's lover, Eugenia is
perhaps Hansen's finest crea
tion. He draws from a few
sketchy historical facts the por
trait of a woman who is com
mitted to finding excitement
and security in the badlands by
joining up with the Daiton
gang. It's in the sparse, witty
dialogue that we come to know
Eugenia. She tells Bob, "I hate
the name Florence. It sounds
like I crochet and gossip and
succumb in the afternoon to
hot flashes. •
"Whereas I hear you've rus
tled saddle stock and cattle and
you came to Silver City after a
chase," returns Bob.
Hansen breaks the rules
when it comes to giving us in
formation Emmett just couldn't

have had. Sometimes there is
an explanation for this; other
times passages slide by. But the
flow of the story is never made
false in giving Emmett access to
other characters' conversa
tions and thoughts. It's as if
Emmett tells us things that are
common knowledge among
the gang anyway.

One refreshing note is that
Hansen doesn't allow any
major discussions of "right and
wrong"to bog down his book.
"Looking at all these events
through Emmett's eyes was
fascinating to me because I
could do it without the conven
tional morality involved," he
said. "Emmett is an involved
conspirator without much re
morse, though he does try to
explain away a lot of his ac
tions. That saved me from deal
ing with a lot of judgmental
passages," said Hansen.
"The writing itself went
quickly for me after doing the
research. I like to write about
action more than cerebral
things," he said.
Desperadoes is that kind of
tight, action-filled story with

to read along and live the Old
