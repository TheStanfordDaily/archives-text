writings.
Few of his works, with
the exception of his seminal
Tristes Tropiques have catered
to the layman.lt is not that his
works are difficult (although
some have claimed this) but,
more properly, that they are
time-consuming. A book such
as The Raw and the Cooked,
the first volume of Levi-
Strauss's four part study of
mythologies, must be taken
slowly and carefully.
Striptease
The practice of speed
reading, so often advocated as
an end in itself, is certainly
counter-productive in reading
works of this nature. I am re
minded of Roland Barthes'

comparison of a speed reader
to the spectator at a striptease
who climbs on stage to speed
up the performer's derobing.
The practice is equally unwar
ranted in either case.
Many English-speaking
readers have been able to gain
an understanding of Levi-
Strauss through
enlightening commentaries by
Susan Sontag, George Steiner
and Edmund Leach. Still there
is no substitute for the original
texts.
It is in this light that I re
commend Myth and Meaning.
The discussions of myth and
history, and interpretation of
mythology do not compare

with Levi-Strauss's treatment
of these concepts elsewhere.
But as an introduction it pre
sents a large amount of impor
tant material in a relatively
small amount of space â€” a vir
tue which is not common to all
of Levi-Strauss's writings.
These lectures were given in
English, and one cannot help
suspect that this is the cause of
their clarity and simplicity.
Moreover Levi-Strauss
exhibits, throughout these five
lectures, a humility and
open-mindedness which seem
genuine and are certainly a re
freshing departure from the
typical academic bill-of-fare.
