Maddalena's Continental
Restaurant
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
Secluded amongst Emerson
Street's mundane paint shops
and Montgomery Ward outlets
is a refuge of past elegance —
Maddalena's Continental Re
staurant. This hiding place is
unusually tranquil and charm
ing; its food exceptionally de
licious. Now in its second year
and boasting a growing, de
voted clientele, Maddalena's is
a must for any self-professed
French or Italian gourmet.
Fred Maddalena, himself, is
from a bygone era of cabarets
and supper clubs which he
managed on the East Coast be
fore the death of traveling
bands and the birth of "fine
food" chain restaurants. Soft
spoken and gracious, Mad
dalena preserves this sense of
the past in his restaurant's
superlative food, attractive
decor and cordial service.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside
Scampi Bordelaise. Our meals

were excellent; thus it appears
that Maddalena's chef has not
overextended himself with this
wide variety.
The appetizer list is unexcep
tional; one may choose from
such traditional dishes as
Shrimp Cocktail ($4.25), Crab
Cocktail ($4.95), Scampi Bor
delaise ($10.50 for two) and Es
cargots Lyonnaise ($4.50),
which we selected and found
to be deliciously seasoned in a
garlic butter sauce.

Yet the abundant Italian pas
tas are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini ala
Romana ($5.25) and Fortellini
ala Romana ($5.20), we chose
Linguine Vongle to share. This
pasta in a savory garlic sauce

and surrounded by succulent
fresh steamed clams was un
ique and delicious.
Salad was nothing special, a
simple lettuce leaf with a tasty
vinaigrette dressing, the soup
du jour, asparagus, was excep
tional. It was extremely creamy
and bits of asparagus added to
its rich flavor.
Maddalena's also offers
salads a la carte, such as
spinach ($5.50 for two), mus
hroom ($5), Caeser ($5.50 for
two) and Butter Lettuce with
sea food ($4.95). Two addi
tional soups may be chosen as
well, French Onion au gratin
($2) and Boston Clam chowder
($2).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and Sole
Florentine with Shrimp ($10.50)
to Chicken al Forno Arturo
($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
Each of Maddalena's five veal
dinners is unique and made
from the finest white Wiscon
sin provimi veal. The list ranges

from Veal Dorati's simple light
lemon flavor to Veal Floren
tine's cream sauce with chop
ped spinach to Veal Piccata
with capers, mushrooms and
wine.
The chef's special of the day
may also feature veal dishes,
and one such special, Veal
Marsala is especially flavorful.
Extremely tender veal is
cooked in sweet marsala wine
and butter sauce then gar
nished with mushrooms; the
taste was sweet yet subtle.

Another entree, Crabs Legs
Eilene, though a regular menu
item, is as expertly prepared.
Alaskan King Crab is simmered
in a white wine butter cream
sauce with artichoke hearts
and mushrooms to make this
dish unusually rich, yet not
overpowering. In fact, my
crab-loving companion de
clared it was the tastiest crab
dish he had ever had.
The desserts, as varied as the
rest of the menu, reflect the
French influence. One may
choose from Chocolate
Mousse ($1.95), Baked Alaska
($6.50 for two), Crepes Maison
($6.50 for two) and Cherries
Jubilee Flambe ($5.50 for two).
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too
does Maddalena's decor —
soft blue walls and carpeting,
gold framed pictures, beauti
fully painted screens and
chandeliers. Quiet, unpreten
tious elegance creates the aura
of a French salons rather than a
restaurant.
The private dining room lo
cated on the second floor,
which was opened this year to
accommodate Maddalena's
growing popularity, really
forces one back in time. The
love seat, service button to call
the waiter, antique table and
heater are all part of a bygone
era. One can easily relive past
luxury and quality as a guest at
Maddalena's.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
through Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m., and 6-10 p.m.

ique and delicious.
Salad was nothing special, a
simple lettuce leaf with a tasty
vinaigrette dressing, the soup
du jour, asparagus, was excep
tional. It was extremely creamy
and bits of asparagus added to
its rich flavor.
Maddalena's also offers
salads a la carte, such as
spinach ($5.50 for two), mus
hroom ($5), Caeser ($5.50 for
two) and Butter Lettuce with
sea food ($4.95). Two addi
tional soups may be chosen as
well, French Onion au gratin
($2) and Boston Clam chowder
($2).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and Sole
Florentine with Shrimp ($10.50)
to Chicken al Forno Arturo
($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
Each of Maddalena's five veal
dinners is unique and made
from the finest white Wiscon
sin provimi veal. The list ranges

from Veal Dorati's simple light
lemon flavor to Veal Floren
tine's cream sauce with chop
ped spinach to Veal Piccata
with capers, mushrooms and
wine.
The chef's special of the day
may also feature veal dishes,
and one such special, Veal
Marsala is especially flavorful.
Extremely tender veal is
cooked in sweet marsala wine
and butter sauce then gar
nished with mushrooms; the
taste was sweet yet subtle.

Another entree, Crabs Legs
Eilene, though a regular menu
item, is as expertly prepared.
Alaskan King Crab is simmered
in a white wine butter cream
sauce with artichoke hearts
and mushrooms to make this
dish unusually rich, yet not
overpowering. In fact, my
crab-loving companion de
clared it was the tastiest crab
dish he had ever had.
The desserts, as varied as the
rest of the menu, reflect the
French influence. One may
choose from Chocolate
Mousse ($1.95), Baked Alaska
($6.50 for two), Crepes Maison
($6.50 for two) and Cherries
Jubilee Flambe ($5.50 for two).
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too
does Maddalena's decor —
soft blue walls and carpeting,
gold framed pictures, beauti
fully painted screens and
chandeliers. Quiet, unpreten
tious elegance creates the aura
of a French salons rather than a
restaurant.
The private dining room lo
cated on the second floor,
which was opened this year to
accommodate Maddalena's
growing popularity, really
forces one back in time. The
love seat, service button to call
the waiter, antique table and
heater are all part of a bygone
era. One can easily relive past
luxury and quality as a guest at
Maddalena's.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
through Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m., and 6-10 p.m.

Maddalena's Continental
Restaurant
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
Secluded amongst Emerson
Street's mundane paint shops
and Montgomery Ward outlets
is a refuge of past elegance —
Maddalena's Continental Re
staurant. This hiding place is
unusually tranquil and charm
ing; its food exceptionally de
licious. Now in its second year
and boasting a growing, de
voted clientele, Maddalena's is
a must for any self-professed
French or Italian gourmet.
Fred Maddalena, himself, is
from a bygone era of cabarets
and supper clubs which he
managed on the East Coast be
fore the death of traveling
bands and the birth of "fine
food" chain restaurants. Soft
spoken and gracious, Mad
dalena preserves this sense of
the past in his restaurant's
superlative food, attractive
decor and cordial service.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside
Scampi Bordelaise. Our meals

were excellent; thus it appears
that Maddalena's chef has not
overextended himself with this
wide variety.
The appetizer list is unexcep
tional; one may choose from
such traditional dishes as
Shrimp Cocktail ($4.25), Crab
Cocktail ($4.95), Scampi Bor
delaise ($10.50 for two) and Es
cargots Lyonnaise ($4.50),
which we selected and found
to be deliciously seasoned in a
garlic butter sauce.

Yet the abundant Italian pas
tas are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini ala
Romana ($5.25) and Fortellini
ala Romana ($5.20), we chose
Linguine Vongle to share. This
pasta in a savory garlic sauce

and surrounded by succulent
fresh steamed clams was un
ique and delicious.
