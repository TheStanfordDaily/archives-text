The Proud Popover
Stanford Shopping Center

The "special" this Monday evening is stuffed
fresh sole reads the chalk board. Potted palms
flank the wide, white door into the entry hall of
the Proud Popover at the Stanford Shopping
Center. Cool yellow walls reflect the flickering
light of the candles and the glint of the brass
holders. Under the rising octagonal rotunda,
the colonial decor provides a pleasant setting
for dinner.
Our attentive and thoughtful waiter set the
mood for the evening. His service made us com
fortable and relaxed, yet there was no lag bet
ween courses. The atmosphere at the Popover
can be characterized as warm and conducive to
a quiet, private conversation.
The menu offers variety; soup, salads, chic
ken, fish, prime rib, lamb and vegetables. We
began with house wine. Pat, my dining compan
ion, describes the white wine as dry, fruity and
adequate. Hot, fresh popovers with butter ar
rived in the bread basket! Mixed green salad
with a cheddar cheese house dressing, and
Clam Chowder, both very tasty, set us on the
path to culinary adventure.
I elected to have the roast lamb which was
served with an herb mint sauce which definitely
enhanced the meat flavor, and broccoli. The
lamb was slightly dry, but the mint sauce
helped. Pat selected one of the Popover din
ners. He chose the seafood, served in a popover

which consists primarily of shrimp in a cream
cheese sauce, which he describes as rather rich.
Lightly creamed spinach, right to his taste, ac
companied his seafood dinner.
The food was prepared well and served hot at
the table. In addition, each dish was tastefully
arranged. Throughout the meal the waiter con
tinued to be attentive to our needs.
The choice of desserts ranges from Blueberry
Cobbler to Popover Pudding and an indescriba
ble chocolate concoction. The Blueberry Cob
bler was fine excepting the slightly doughy
crust, according to Pat. The Popover Pudding is
a mildly sweet, light pudding dessert with an
apple, nut and raisin topping which I found to
be a light and satisfactory ending to my meal.
The Proud Popover serves a daily lunch of
fruit daiquiries, quiche and salads. They have a
Sunday Brunch menu of four specialty dishes. It
is a moderately priced restaurant — dinners
range from $5.75 to $10 and include s6up or
salad and vegetable.
According to the manager, John Law, the
Proud Popover attracts its clientele from the
shoppers who stop for lunch. There is always a
line if you pass by at noon. People tend to forget
that restaurants in the shopping centerare open
for dinner, and the location of the Popover at
the back of the shopping center does not lend
itself to attracting people driving by.
So if you are interested in a quiet dinner ac
companied by excellent service, try the Proud
Popover at Stanford Shopping Center some
evening.
