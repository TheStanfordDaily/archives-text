# Law students sort out constitutional crisis
## 
### Victor Dorff 
Student government elections were held yesterday at
the Law School. The winners, members of the so-called
Suicide Slate, ran on a campaign promise to resign im
mediately after holding a new, "legal and constitutional
election."
Paul Fryd (president), Jeff Klein (vice president of fi
nance), Robert Weisberg (vice president of student af
fairs) and |ohn Lewis (vice president of student-faculty
relations) will have to keep that campaign promise, be
cause none of them will be attending the Law School
next fall; Fryd, Weisberg and Lewis will be graduating
this |une and Klein will be on an internship in
Washington, D.C.
Yesterday's election was the climax of a controversy
that evolved last October when a group of students
attempted to reverse the controversial firing of the Law
Lounge day manager. The students made several at
tempts to force the student body representatives to re
hire their employee, submitting petitions and holding
referenda and a no-confidence vote.
At that time, it became apparent that there was no
valid constitution and that there was no recognized
mechanism for giving students an active voice in their

government. Several students offered to help write a
constitution and a Constitutional Law class considered
pursuing the task as a class project. Acall fora "Constitu
tional Convention" was soon raised.
Over the course of the school year, a Constitutional
Committee was formed by then-officers Peter Farranto,
Chris Seaver, Karen Cook and jill Matichak. The con
stitution they drafted — and which was approved —
called for the establishment of the offices of Vice Presi
dent of Management and of First Year Representative
and the elimination of the office of Vice President of
Student-Faculty Relations.
The document also established specific duties and
powers associated with each of the offices (something
that is not clearly spelled out under the present govern
ment), and it set up new election procedures and provi
sions for amendments and advisory referenda.
When the proposed constitution was submitted to the
students for ratification Tuesday, at the same time that
primaries were held to elect officers under the old gov
ernment, the members of the Suicide Slate claimed that
it was "ridiculous" to have the new officers elected
without the Constitution. "It allows the new officers to
decide at their discretion how they will adapt themselves
to the new constitution, or if they will at all," the candi

dates said.
Peter Farranto, this year's Law Association President,
said, however, that time considerations prevented him
from holding the two elections separately. "The con
stitution wasn't ready until it was too late," he explained,
"and the final elections would not have been held until
the middle of May if we had held them separately."
The new constitution was ratified in Tuesday's ballot
ting, and the Suicide Slate was propelled into the run
offs, along with four other candidates. Then, in yester
day's run-offs, the Suicide Candidates mustered about
60 percent of the votes.
The four new officers have already announced that
they will be holding elections under the new constitu
tion next Thursday and Friday and that they will resign as
soon as the constitutional offices have been filled.
"We were more than a joke," said President-elect
Fryd. "I believe that unfettered authority has a high
potential for abuse. Our main purpose was to do the job
that the old officers failed to do — namely, to run a legal
and constitutional election."
Throughout the elections, Dean Charles Meyers, who
feels that the administration should maintain a strict
hands-off policy toward student government, declined
to comment.
