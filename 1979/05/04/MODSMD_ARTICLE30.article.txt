It could have been really neat. The name,
Tales of Marco Polo, allowed for something
different. Mysterious recipes from the Far
East, Indian spices, an old-world Italian chef?
The possibilities were there. As it is though,
dining at Tales ot Marco Polo is a disappoint
ment.
The too-dark "Mediterranean-style" decor
is the first let-down. The verathane-coated
menu is the second. Prefaced by a note from
the owner, Mr. Mori Akiho, which says "we
are serving American food with a Chinese
accent," the bill of fare isn't what I had ex
pected.
The 13 dinners come with a choice of
Marco Polo Chowder or soup-of-the-day and
a salad bar, and are organized under the
headings, "From the Land," "From the
Seas," and"From the Emperor's Table." The
chowder is of the creamy Campbell's variety,
incorporating bits of peas and carrots in a
bland potato base. The salad bar, noteworthy
for its apple and sesame dressings, also in
cluded fresh spinach and sweet cherry to
matoes. Chilled salad plates are a nice touch.
Concentrating on oriental-type marinades,
the beef and poultry dishes manage to touch
the usual bases. There's a Chicken Teriyaki
and a Gypsy Chicken prepared in a tomato
and vegetable sauce, each listed at $6.95, and
a Ginger Steak for $7.95.
I ordered the New York Cut Steak priced at
$9.45. Marinated with Marco Polo sauce and

cooked on the Mongolian-style broiler in the
dining room, the meat was unnecessarily dry
and the seasoning unimportant — inexcusa
ble at that price. Mixed vegetables and pasta
(our waiter informed us that they usually
servelinguine; the nightwewerethereitwas
luke-warm spaghetti), accompanied the
steak.
The fish and seafood entrees received
higher marks. Here, imagination and season
ing hold to a less rigid code. Sole, scallops,
shrimp and lobster are featured. The Manda
rin Sole at $7.95, poached and served in a
delicately sweet champagne sauce, was our
choice. Although we didn't try it, the Sesame
Sole ($7.45), sauteed in lemon and butter and
sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, also
looked good. The same frozen vegetable
combination served with the steak was unfor
tunately also served.
Desserts number three. The house spe
cialty, vanilla custard topped with fresh
strawberries, sounded good but was de
scribed so unenthusiastically by our waiter
that we ordered the cheesecake instead.
Tasting not unlike Sara Lee's, the cheesecake
was far from special. Marco Polo Coffee ($2),
dark coffee laced with amaretto and whipped
cream (I don't think it was real), was a pleas
ant, but again, not an exceptional ending to
our meal.
For my tastes and my money, I would go
elsewhere than Tales of Marco Polo. There
are too many other good restaurants and too
few opportunities for "nights out" to warrant
a high recommendation. Tales of Marco Polo
isn't bad, it just isn't great.
