Patten's
415 Emerson
Palo Alto
325-4052
Patten's opened about a year
ago, although until very re
cently it was known as Bess and
the Beefeater. The restaurant
advertises "European cuisine
in an English atmosphere" — a
rather unhappy marriage.
The exterior is mock Tudor,
with a rather bright billboard,
and warrants a shudder on the
way in. The interior, with dim
med lighting reflecting the
dominant red, and ranks of
booths displaying identical re
nditions of a Beefeater, is re
miniscent of a steakhouse.
This is unfortunate, for it is
precisely the image Patten's
avowedly wishes to avoid.
With the new name (resulting
from some problems with a
British company known for its
gin) and a recent change in
chef, the culinary emphasis has
shifted from generally Euro
pean to primarily French
inspired.
There are still dishes on the
menu such as Roast Prime Rib
of Beef with Yorkshire Pudding
(at $9 or $11 depending on the
portion size), and Broiled
Lamb Chops with MintSauceat
$13. However, there are also
several more imaginative dis
hes: Brook Trout en Pcpillote,
filled with Bay shrimp and
crabmeat ($9), Breast of Chic
ken Jerusalem on artichoke
crowns with julienne Canadian
bacon and sauce Nornay

($8.25), Veal Saute with Apples
($11), Tenderloin of Beef with
Pea Pods, seasoned with
Oriental vegetables ($9.75).
Entrees incude either the
day's soup or a house salad,
the soup being cream of
spinach on the evening we
sampled it. It was unusual in
that the spinach had not been
totally pureed, and had a
pleasant flavor. A la carte ap
petizers include a*good onion
soup ($2.25), Cheese Feuileete
($2.25), Seafood Bisque ($2.25
also), and the traditional Escar
got at $3.75.
Of the two a la carte salads,
wilted spinach and Caesar, we
chose the latter (at $6.50 for
two). The dressing was excel
lently and expertly prepared
for us by our waiter (a moon
lighting Stanford student), but
the salad was marred by the
quality of the lettuce. It was
only with difficulty that I could
be persuaded that it was in
deed Romaine lettuce, for its
color was excessively dark and
the flavor correspondingly bit
ter.
The entree my guest ordered
was the Fillet of Fresh Petrale
Sole, saute Meuniere ($8.25),
served with rice seasoned with
herbs and zucchini prepared
with mushroom. The consis
tency of the fish was pleasant,
although the dish was in no
way out of the ordinary.
I tried the Veal Saute with
Apples, flavored with Cal
vados, which I was told is a
specialty of the chef, Fred

Baker. I must have been on an
unlucky streak (and the re
staurant too!), for I hear Pat
ten's veal is considered good
by many. Mine was exception
ally dry and tasteless, even
granted the nature of this deli
cate meat. The only flavor and
moisture came from the apples
permeated with Calvados (ap
ple brandy made in Nor
mandy). Even under better cir
cumstances, I wonder whether
the amount of Calvados used
wouldn't be rather overpower
ing, and prevent the dish strik
ing the right balance.
Entree portions and house
soup or salad are on the small
side — Mr. Baker believes that
people should taste a number
of small dishes. A la carte ex
tras, however, come in quite
generous portions, and you
will probably want at least one
if you are hungry. The Caesar
salad in particular was unex
pectedly large, although I must
say I didn't finish it, for reasons
mentioned above.
Patten's desserts prove a
rather sweeter subject. There
is a mysteriously enticing
Dutch Baby at $5.75 for two (I
won't spoil the treat by reveal
ing its composition); there are
also Cherries Jubilee ($5.95 for
two), and Brie and fruit at $2.
We tasted the Lemon Mousse
($2), and the Apple Turnover
with Ice Cream ($.75). Both
were quite enjoyable.
I he wine list is not extensive,
but is fairly priced and rep
resentative. The house wine is

Mondavi, $4.25 a liter carafe.
Service is formal (tuxedos)
and generally good. Our waiter
was attentive and helpful.
Strangely, it was the maitre
d'hotel who made a gaffe: al
though we had reservations
and the place was far from full,
we had to dawdle and then the
maitre d' cleared other place
settings away from our table
after we were seated. In an in
formal setting this would be
quite forgivable; in this price
bracket and given Patten's
claims to provide classic grace
ful dining, it is not.
Overall, Patten's is expen
sive, considering what it offers,
and given the serious misgiv
ings it arouses in this reviewer at
least. It may be that the combi
nation of British owner/
manager and American chef
trained at the Cordon Bleu
school has not yet fused very
well. If this is the case, we may
hope to see improvement in
both quality and consistency in
months to come.
In any event, some serious
thinking needs to be done, and
remedial action taken, with re
spect to the disparity between
the image Patten's seeks to
project and its current image. I
wish them all the best of British
luck.
Patten's also serves lunches
and Sunday brunches. Eighty
people can be seated inside,
and the patio can hold 120. It is
closed on Mondays and Tues
days. Visa and Mastercharge
are accepted.

This is unfortunate, for it is
precisely the image Patten's
avowedly wishes to avoid.
With the new name (resulting
from some problems with a
British company known for its
gin) and a recent change in
chef, the culinary emphasis has
shifted from generally Euro
pean to primarily French
inspired.
There are still dishes on the
menu such as Roast Prime Rib
of Beef with Yorkshire Pudding
(at $9 or $11 depending on the
portion size), and Broiled
Lamb Chops with MintSauceat
$13. However, there are also
several more imaginative dis
hes: Brook Trout en Pcpillote,
filled with Bay shrimp and
crabmeat ($9), Breast of Chic
ken Jerusalem on artichoke
crowns with julienne Canadian
bacon and sauce Nornay

($8.25), Veal Saute with Apples
($11), Tenderloin of Beef with
Pea Pods, seasoned with
Oriental vegetables ($9.75).
Entrees incude either the
day's soup or a house salad,
the soup being cream of
spinach on the evening we
sampled it. It was unusual in
that the spinach had not been
totally pureed, and had a
pleasant flavor. A la carte ap
petizers include a*good onion
soup ($2.25), Cheese Feuileete
($2.25), Seafood Bisque ($2.25
also), and the traditional Escar
got at $3.75.
Of the two a la carte salads,
wilted spinach and Caesar, we
chose the latter (at $6.50 for
two). The dressing was excel
lently and expertly prepared
for us by our waiter (a moon
lighting Stanford student), but
the salad was marred by the
quality of the lettuce. It was
only with difficulty that I could
be persuaded that it was in
deed Romaine lettuce, for its
color was excessively dark and
the flavor correspondingly bit
ter.
The entree my guest ordered
was the Fillet of Fresh Petrale
Sole, saute Meuniere ($8.25),
served with rice seasoned with
herbs and zucchini prepared
with mushroom. The consis
tency of the fish was pleasant,
although the dish was in no
way out of the ordinary.
I tried the Veal Saute with
Apples, flavored with Cal
vados, which I was told is a
specialty of the chef, Fred

Baker. I must have been on an
unlucky streak (and the re
staurant too!), for I hear Pat
ten's veal is considered good
by many. Mine was exception
ally dry and tasteless, even
granted the nature of this deli
cate meat. The only flavor and
moisture came from the apples
permeated with Calvados (ap
ple brandy made in Nor
mandy). Even under better cir
cumstances, I wonder whether
the amount of Calvados used
wouldn't be rather overpower
ing, and prevent the dish strik
ing the right balance.
Entree portions and house
soup or salad are on the small
side — Mr. Baker believes that
people should taste a number
of small dishes. A la carte ex
tras, however, come in quite
generous portions, and you
will probably want at least one
if you are hungry. The Caesar
salad in particular was unex
pectedly large, although I must
say I didn't finish it, for reasons
mentioned above.
Patten's desserts prove a
rather sweeter subject. There
is a mysteriously enticing
Dutch Baby at $5.75 for two (I
won't spoil the treat by reveal
ing its composition); there are
also Cherries Jubilee ($5.95 for
two), and Brie and fruit at $2.
We tasted the Lemon Mousse
($2), and the Apple Turnover
with Ice Cream ($.75). Both
were quite enjoyable.
I he wine list is not extensive,
but is fairly priced and rep
resentative. The house wine is

Mondavi, $4.25 a liter carafe.
Service is formal (tuxedos)
and generally good. Our waiter
was attentive and helpful.
Strangely, it was the maitre
d'hotel who made a gaffe: al
though we had reservations
and the place was far from full,
we had to dawdle and then the
maitre d' cleared other place
settings away from our table
after we were seated. In an in
formal setting this would be
quite forgivable; in this price
bracket and given Patten's
claims to provide classic grace
ful dining, it is not.
Overall, Patten's is expen
sive, considering what it offers,
and given the serious misgiv
ings it arouses in this reviewer at
least. It may be that the combi
nation of British owner/
manager and American chef
trained at the Cordon Bleu
school has not yet fused very
well. If this is the case, we may
hope to see improvement in
both quality and consistency in
months to come.
In any event, some serious
thinking needs to be done, and
remedial action taken, with re
spect to the disparity between
the image Patten's seeks to
project and its current image. I
wish them all the best of British
luck.
Patten's also serves lunches
and Sunday brunches. Eighty
people can be seated inside,
and the patio can hold 120. It is
closed on Mondays and Tues
days. Visa and Mastercharge
are accepted.
