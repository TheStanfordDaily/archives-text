Scotty Campbell's
2907 El Camino
Redwood City
164-3773
Over the past 25 years, while
numerous restaurants on El
Camino have opened and sub
sequently gone out of busi
ness, Scotty Campbell's, on
the Redwood City-Atherton
border, has provided consis
tent quality food and friendly
service to a loyal local clien
tele.
Scotty Campbell's offers a
good to excellent value. The
prices are moderate. Complete
dinners range from Broiled
Chopped Steak at $b.95 to the
combination of Prime Top Sir
loin Steak and Australian Lobs
ter Tail at $15.95.
All dinners include onion
soup or tossed green salad,
stuffed or baked potato, de
ssert and coffee. Portions are
generous and diners leave well
satisfied.
The menu is quite complete,
offering 23 entrees. Dinner
fare includes 12 beef items, six
fish entrees, lamb chops
($9.95), cannelloni ($6.95) and
chicken ($7.95).
The Barbequed Baby-Back
Ribs ($9.75) were recom
mended to me by a loyal local
customer, arid they were excel
lent. I received a very generous
portion covered in a thick,
tangy barbeque sauce. The
meat was tender and well sea

soned, and there was a
minimum of fat.
The prime rib ($10.95) and
the special club steak ($8.95)
looked excellent and cooked
to perfection. Again, they were
very generous cuts.
The deep-water shrimp
($10.95) were disappointingly
tough. Served in a butter, gar
lic and parsley sauce that
lacked consistency and body,
the shrimps were under
cooked. Beef, not seafood, is
definitely Scotty Campbell's
specialty.
The side order of sauteed
mushrooms ($2.75) was sur
prisingly good. The onion
soup, while qualifying with the
proper color and consistency,
seemed to lack a basic element
— onions. Also, the salad was
less than creative, since it con
sisted of a few types of lettuce
with institutional quality
roquefort dressing.
The warm french bread was
covered with garlic and parme
san cheese. It was an unex
pected complement to the
meal, since it was not on the
menu.
The dessert included in the
dinner was ice cream. We also
sampled the Maerd Eip (dream
pie spelled backwards) for
$.95. The pie was a delightful
combination of flavors, tex
tures and temperatures. The
tasty graham cracker crust with
a light cheese filling was co

vered with warm brandied
cherries.
The atmosphere of Scotty
Campbell's is hard to describe,
since it is not focused on a un
ified theme. The eclectic
combination of Scottish an
tiques and football
memorabilia scattered around
the lounge and restaurant do
not mesh with any harmony
whatsoever. The collection of
junk and memorabilia range
from a full suit of armor, wood
wagon, grandfather clock,
moose head with a sombrero
to antique tea cups, beaded
purses and antique laxative
bottles. The overall effect is
tacky instead of interesting and
cozy.
The staff is friendly and loyal.
They seemed to know many of
the customers. I he service was
prompt and courteous.
The exterior of the restaur
ant is not very appealing. Not
only is it on a section of CI
Camino that represents
urban-sprawl, but the neon
cocktail glass is reminiscent of
cocktail lounges in low grade
movies or the Clow Worm
lounge on Highway 101.
Scotty Campbell's is open
for dinner, seven nights a
week. Generous portions,
large selection, good service
and moderate prices add up to
a dining experience that is a
very good value.
