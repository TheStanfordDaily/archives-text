Singin' in the Rain * * ★ *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This spoof of Hollywood's tur
bulent change-over from silentto
sound has charmed audiences
for nearly three decades. This is
one of those movies where audi
ences applaud at the end of
scenes; even people who don't
like musicals grudgingly find
themselves caught up in it before
the first few reels have unwound.
Gene Kelly is in top form, but
Donald O'Connor, as Kelly's
wise-cracking sidekick, nearly
steals the show when he dances
up and into the walls in the fam
ous Make 'Em Laugh number.
Even Debbie Reynolds, not
exactly noted for being a great
actress, is fine. Songs by Nacio
Herb Brown and Authur Freed.
Story by Adolph Green and Betty
Comden. Arthur Freed pro
duced, and Stanley Donen di
rected. (1952).

The Last Detail * * *
Saturday, Cubberley
Jack Nicholson shines in this
tale of two Navy men who are
sent to escort an 18-year-old
seaman to a naval prison to serve
an eight-year sentence. Will the
poor kid lose his chance to grow
up? Not with these two guys;
they try to stuff eight years of ex
periences into a week's journey.
Hal Ashby's direction of the
Robert Towne script gets a bit
manipulative, but Nicholson
never quits. With Otis Young and
Randy Quaid.
—Ron Lillejord
Sleuth * * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This movie's parlor games
begin to drag about two-thirds of
the way through, but the acting
games are more than enough to
sustain your interest. Laurence
Olivier and Michael Caine romp
gleefully through Anthony Shaf
fer's excessively witty play about
two men whose English mystery
one-upmanship goes more than
a little too far.
—R.L.

Picnic at Hanging Rock * ★ *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.

Superman * * ★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.
Buck Rogers in (he 25th Century
j*r.
Guild, Menlo Park
This movie is so bad that it
makes Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians look like Citizen Kane. It
features yecchv acting, wretched
dialogue, putrid sets, and abys
mal double-entendres. Buck Ro
gers was made for TV and then
distributed fortheatrical use after
I the producers found out how
much money Battlestar Calactica
I was making in its Canadian theat
rical run. This explains the film's
rating: "M" for mindless.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.
—R.L,
The Paper Chase ★ *
Sunday, Mem. Aud.
Timothy Bottoms is a student at
Harvard Law School. John Hous
seman is a law school professor
with a heart of poison oak.
Lindsay Wagner is an attractive
young woman who serves little
purpose in the plot — maybe she
was a friend of the producer. This
movie is about how miserable life
can be fora first-yearlawstudent.
No notes, books or briefcases
will be allowed into the theater.
—J.M.

The Champ *
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of Jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.
—).M.
Norma Rae * * * ★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.
fsto Time Tor Breakfast * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Although the stupid tiile seems
designed to keep people away,
Breakfast is a fine, sometimes
moving examination of a doctor
who discovers how comfortless
the ministrations of his profes
sion can be when she finds she is
dying of cancer. Annie Cirardot is
very good as the doctor; she
manages to avoid slipping into
the potential bathos of the sub
ject. Isabelle {The Lacemaker)
Huppert is featured in a small
role. lean-Louis Bertucelli di
rected. (1978)
—).M.

Coming Home * * * *
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers trom poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time. Jane Fonda and Jon
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.
—R.L.
Dear Inspector * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not even the immensely
talented Annie Girardot can sal
vage much of this sometimes
over-violent, sometimes cloying
mystery-romance. It's a
thoroughly unconvincing movie.
Girardot is a "lady detective";
when she take time out from her
latest case to get her hair done it's
supposed to be very funny, but
isn't. Phil Ii pe Noiret co-stars;
Phillipe De Broca, who made
King of Hearts, directed. (1977)
—J.M.

Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.
—J.M.

Gel Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto A
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that |ohn Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo )ima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—)ohn Nielsen

Movie, Movie It it it
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not nearly so bad as it sounds,
this movie is a skillful parody of
two'3osgenres: thegangsterfilm
and the musical. It's in the form
of a double bill. One movie is
called Dynamite Hands, about a
boxer who must deal with the
underworld in order to pay for
his kid sister's eye operation. The
other is called Baxter's Beauties
of 1933; this one's a send-up of
the chorus-girl-to-star cliche. The
same cast, including George C.
Scott, Trish Van Devere and Red
Buttons, is featured in both. Scott
makes a surprisingly adept com
edian, and it is he who makes this
movie so often enjoyable. Stan
ley (Singin' in the Rain) Donen
directed. (1978).

The Chi rid Syndrome * * * #
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.

boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things

Even before the first reel is un

Norma Rae * * * ★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.

Although the stupid tiile seems
designed to keep people away,
Breakfast is a fine, sometimes
moving examination of a doctor
who discovers how comfortless

dying of cancer. Annie Cirardot is
very good as the doctor; she

Coming Home * * * *
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers trom poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time. Jane Fonda and Jon
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel

excellent throughout.
—R.L.
Dear Inspector * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not even the immensely
talented Annie Girardot can sal
vage much of this sometimes
over-violent, sometimes cloying
mystery-romance. It's a
thoroughly unconvincing movie.
Girardot is a "lady detective";
when she take time out from her
latest case to get her hair done it's
supposed to be very funny, but
isn't. Phil Ii pe Noiret co-stars;
Phillipe De Broca, who made
King of Hearts, directed. (1977)

Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Gel Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto A
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe

Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.

The Deer Hunter ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that |ohn Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo )ima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.

Movie, Movie It it it
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not nearly so bad as it sounds,
this movie is a skillful parody of
two'3osgenres: thegangsterfilm
and the musical. It's in the form
of a double bill. One movie is
called Dynamite Hands, about a
boxer who must deal with the
underworld in order to pay for
his kid sister's eye operation. The
other is called Baxter's Beauties
of 1933; this one's a send-up of
the chorus-girl-to-star cliche. The
same cast, including George C.
Scott, Trish Van Devere and Red
Buttons, is featured in both. Scott
makes a surprisingly adept com
edian, and it is he who makes this
movie so often enjoyable. Stan

The Chi rid Syndrome * * * #
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power

been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile

movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.

This spoof of Hollywood's tur

one of those movies where audi

like musicals grudgingly find
themselves caught up in it before

Gene Kelly is in top form, but
Donald O'Connor, as Kelly's

Jack Nicholson shines in this
tale of two Navy men who are
sent to escort an 18-year-old

poor kid lose his chance to grow
up? Not with these two guys;

Picnic at Hanging Rock * ★ *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.

A triumph of corporate com

shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex

The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try

best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

of a double bill. One movie is
called Dynamite Hands, about a
boxer who must deal with the
underworld in order to pay for
his kid sister's eye operation. The
other is called Baxter's Beauties
of 1933; this one's a send-up of
the chorus-girl-to-star cliche. The
same cast, including George C.

makes a surprisingly adept com

The Chi rid Syndrome * * * #
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
This spoof of Hollywood's tur

for nearly three decades. This is
one of those movies where audi

scenes; even people who don't
like musicals grudgingly find
themselves caught up in it before
the first few reels have unwound.
Gene Kelly is in top form, but
Donald O'Connor, as Kelly's
wise-cracking sidekick, nearly
steals the show when he dances
up and into the walls in the fam
ous Make 'Em Laugh number.
Even Debbie Reynolds, not

Jack Nicholson shines in this
tale of two Navy men who are
sent to escort an 18-year-old
seaman to a naval prison to serve
an eight-year sentence. Will the
poor kid lose his chance to grow
up? Not with these two guys;
they try to stuff eight years of ex

Picnic at Hanging Rock * ★ *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para

necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.

A triumph of corporate com

The movie survives its overlong

Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over

If the handkerchief manufac

8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance

Even before the first reel is un

Biograph, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust

Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly

breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac

excellent throughout.

Dear Inspector * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not even the immensely
talented Annie Girardot can sal

over-violent, sometimes cloying
mystery-romance. It's a
thoroughly unconvincing movie.
Girardot is a "lady detective";
when she take time out from her
latest case to get her hair done it's
supposed to be very funny, but
isn't. Phil Ii pe Noiret co-stars;
Phillipe De Broca, who made

Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an

who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Gel Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto A
Bertrand Blier directed this

ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick

The Deer Hunter ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that |ohn Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo )ima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With John Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.

The Paper Chase ★ *
Sunday, Mem. Aud.
Timothy Bottoms is a student at
Harvard Law School. John Hous
seman is a law school professor
with a heart of poison oak.
Lindsay Wagner is an attractive
young woman who serves little
purpose in the plot — maybe she
was a friend of the producer. This
movie is about how miserable life
can be fora first-yearlawstudent.
No notes, books or briefcases
will be allowed into the theater.

The Champ *
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the fate of Jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.

Norma Rae * * * ★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.
fsto Time Tor Breakfast * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Although the stupid tiile seems
designed to keep people away,
Breakfast is a fine, sometimes
moving examination of a doctor
who discovers how comfortless
the ministrations of his profes
sion can be when she finds she is
dying of cancer. Annie Cirardot is
very good as the doctor; she
manages to avoid slipping into
the potential bathos of the sub
ject. Isabelle {The Lacemaker)
Huppert is featured in a small
role. lean-Louis Bertucelli di
rected. (1978)

Coming Home * * * *
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers trom poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time. Jane Fonda and Jon
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.
—R.L.
Dear Inspector * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not even the immensely
talented Annie Girardot can sal
vage much of this sometimes
over-violent, sometimes cloying
mystery-romance. It's a
thoroughly unconvincing movie.
Girardot is a "lady detective";
when she take time out from her
latest case to get her hair done it's
supposed to be very funny, but
isn't. Phil Ii pe Noiret co-stars;
Phillipe De Broca, who made
King of Hearts, directed. (1977)
—J.M.

Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.
—J.M.

Gel Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto A
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of Sol
ange, a woman who, after failing
with her husband and a lover, fi
nally finds solace in the arms of a
13-year-old boy with an IQ of 158.
The twist is that the story is told
from an unabashedly male view
point: the plot may belong to
Solange, but the movie's mean
ing belongs solely to its male
characters. This is one film that's
almost certain to be controver
sial. Gerard Depardieu, Patrick
Dewaere and Carol Laure star.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that |ohn Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo )ima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at excavation.
—)ohn Nielsen

Movie, Movie It it it
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not nearly so bad as it sounds,
this movie is a skillful parody of
two'3osgenres: thegangsterfilm
and the musical. It's in the form
of a double bill. One movie is
called Dynamite Hands, about a
boxer who must deal with the
underworld in order to pay for
his kid sister's eye operation. The
other is called Baxter's Beauties
of 1933; this one's a send-up of
the chorus-girl-to-star cliche. The
same cast, including George C.
Scott, Trish Van Devere and Red
Buttons, is featured in both. Scott
makes a surprisingly adept com
edian, and it is he who makes this
movie so often enjoyable. Stan
ley (Singin' in the Rain) Donen
directed. (1978).

The Chi rid Syndrome * * * #
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.

Singin' in the Rain * * ★ *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This spoof of Hollywood's tur
bulent change-over from silentto
sound has charmed audiences
for nearly three decades. This is
one of those movies where audi
ences applaud at the end of
scenes; even people who don't
like musicals grudgingly find
themselves caught up in it before
the first few reels have unwound.
Gene Kelly is in top form, but
Donald O'Connor, as Kelly's
wise-cracking sidekick, nearly
steals the show when he dances
up and into the walls in the fam
ous Make 'Em Laugh number.
Even Debbie Reynolds, not
exactly noted for being a great
actress, is fine. Songs by Nacio
Herb Brown and Authur Freed.
Story by Adolph Green and Betty
Comden. Arthur Freed pro

The Last Detail * * *
Saturday, Cubberley
Jack Nicholson shines in this
tale of two Navy men who are
sent to escort an 18-year-old
seaman to a naval prison to serve
an eight-year sentence. Will the
poor kid lose his chance to grow
up? Not with these two guys;
they try to stuff eight years of ex
periences into a week's journey.
Hal Ashby's direction of the
Robert Towne script gets a bit
manipulative, but Nicholson
never quits. With Otis Young and
Randy Quaid.
—Ron Lillejord
Sleuth * * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This movie's parlor games
begin to drag about two-thirds of
the way through, but the acting
games are more than enough to
sustain your interest. Laurence
Olivier and Michael Caine romp
gleefully through Anthony Shaf
fer's excessively witty play about
two men whose English mystery
one-upmanship goes more than
a little too far.
—R.L.

Picnic at Hanging Rock * ★ *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.
—).M.
Superman * * ★
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
wonder it makes up with an ex
perienced comic book sense.
The movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
