# QB fourth-round pick in NFL draft
## Vikings discover Dils; Ceresino, Francis waiting 
### Ivan Maisel 
The only thing that was not
surprising about the first six
rounds of the National Football
League's annual college draft
was that there were plenty of
surprises, particularly as con
cerned the Stanford Cardinals.
Quarterback Steve Dils, who
rewrote the Stanford record
book with his accurate right
arm, was chosen in the fourth
round by the Minnesota Vik
ings, the 97th pick in the draft.
However, that was the only
event that occurred about as
expected. Consider the follow
ing:
— Dils was drafted ahead of
such All-Amerifcans as Jeff Rut
ledge of national champion
Alabama and Rick Leach of
Michigan, but behind such
unheralded quarterbacks as
Phil Simms of Morehead State

University and Joe Montana of
Notre Dame.
— Montana was chosen in
the third round by the San
Francisco 49ers, who are
coached by former Stanford
head coach Bill Walsh. Dils led
the Walsh-coached Cardinals
to an 8-4, Bluebonnet Bowl
championship season.
— All-American linebacker
Cordy Ceresino, who was
rated as high as sixth at his pos
ition by pro scouts, was not
drafted in the first six rounds,
some 20 or so linebackers
being drafted ahead of him.
Dils, the 6-foot-2 native of
Vancouver, Washington who
set Stanford seasonal records
in yards gained, touchdown
passes, completions and at
tempts, was pleased but, well,
surprised about being selected
by the Vikings.

"I really was surprised," Dils
said. "It's funny how it works.
It goes from January to May 3,
you talk to certain teams, and
then someone else picks you.
The same thing happened last
year with (Guy) Benjamin and
(Bill) Kellar.
"There was very little contact
between us (the Vikings and
Dils)," Dils said. "I hadn't even
filled out a questionnaire."
The Vikings obviously knew
enough about Dils. Minnesota
head coach Bud Grant called
him "the leading passer in the
country" and compared him to
Tommy Kramer, the quarter
back the Vikings chose in the
first round two years ago and
the heir apparent to the start
ing job now that it is rumored
that Fran Tarkenton will retire
to work as foil to Howard
Cosell on ABC Monday Night

Football.
A spokesman for the Vikings
elaborated on the fact that
Minnesota was taking Tarken
ton's retirement seriously.
"We were in the market for a
third quarterback," said Jeff
Diamond of the Viking front of
fice. "They (the coaches) are
high on Dils. They liked him. It
is very likely that we will carry
three quarterbacks so he's got
a good shot at making the
team."
It is easy to forget that Dils
must make the team first, but
he is confident that he can
make the switch from Stanford
to Minnesota with little prob
lem.
"I'll fit in perfectly," Dils
said. "Tarkenton is not a big
quarterback. He doesn't over
power his passes. He is a
finesse quarterback."

Grant noted that Dils fits the
style of the Viking offense, and
Dils compared it to the Cardi
nal attack.
"They do a lot of things we
did here at Stanford," Dils said.
"They throw to their backs and
do a lot of half-rollouts."
Dils added that he felt fortu
nate that he had been chosen
by a team with offensive
finesse instead of one with a
different offensive philosophy.
"I talked to Guy (Benjamin)
and he agreed that this was the
best for me, compared to say,
Los Angeles or New England.
They just aren't in the same
mold as Minnesota or Stan
ford."
The usually ebullient Cere
sino was somewhat tight
lipped after the day's affairs,
but was also hopeful for better
things in today's remaining

rounds.
"I'm a little disappointed,"
Ceresino said, "but I thought I
would go between the fourth
and eighth rounds. My expec
tations were a little higher."
Besides losing a little pride,
Ceresino lost something
somewhat more tangible. He
estimated the difference bet
ween getting drafted on day
one and day two to be about
$20,000. Nonetheless, he re
mains confident.
"I can make any club in the
league. Deep down, I kinda
knew I would not get drafted
today. My size and my speed
are not overwhelming. I was
hoping they would look at my
four years at Stanford, but they
go mainly by stats and 'compu
ter numbers,' " Ceresino's de
signation for such measure
ments as height and weight.

Both Ceresino and fullback
Phil Francis are expected to go
in the final six rounds Friday.
Francis was unavailable for
comment Thursday.
In the computer age of pro
fessional football, numbers are
the most important thing. You
cannot measure the finesse of
a Steve Dils or the heart of a
Gordy Ceresino. More on the
plight of Ceresino and Francis
on Monday. In other draft
news:
— Bill Walsh did not totally
ignore Stanford Thursday.
Signed as a free agent by the
49ers was Duncan McColl,
formerly of the Washington
Redskins and an Ail-American
defensive end for Stanford
from 1974 to '76. Duncan's
brother Milt is currently a start
ing linebacker for Rod
Dowhower's Cardinals.
