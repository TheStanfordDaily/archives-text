# How the first round went
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The last
great linebacker to come out
of Ohio State was Randy
Cradishar. He helped turn
the Denver Broncos into a
Super Bowl team. Now
comes Tom Cousineau. He
may be the man who starts
Buffalo back toward respec
tability.
"The thought I've had from
watching the Bills is that they
need defensive help. They
score a lot of points," the
6-foot-3, 227-pound
Cousineau said Thursday
after they made him an in
stant millionaire by making
him the No, 1 selection in the
National Football League
draft.
"Being No. 1 is something
I've looked forward to for
years," he added during a
news conference one floor
down from the NFL's draft
headquarters, the Starlight
Roof ballroom on the 18th
floor of the Waldorf-Austoria.
The Bills had the chance to
makeCousineau No. 1 thanks
to the they engineered
last year when they sent O.J.
Simpson to the San Francisco
49ers. Losing him didn't hurt
their offense any. They
wound up drafting Terry Mil
ler and he wound up with
more than 1000 yards last sea
son.

It was obvious the leather
medallion Cousineau wore
around his neck, a gift from a
close friend, had done its job.
"He gave it to me to ensure
my welfare in the Big Apple,"
he said.
"I want to play in the NFL,
with the big boys. I want to
play and I'm going to play,"
he continued, shrugging off
any suggestions that he might
eye the Canadian Football
League as a way of jacking up
his price tag.
"I anticipate no problem in
signing ... I was in Buffalo
once fora physical. It seemed
nice . . . I've been playing for
14 years for satisfaction and
education. It's thrilling to
play a kid's game and get
paid. It's not work for me . . .
I would assume I can step
right in and start."
The Bills would assume so,
too. That would put
Cousineau in the same class
with Tommy Nobis, the last
linebacker picked No. 1 in the
draft, 13 years ago by Atlanta.
Nobis became an instant star
ter and later an All-Pro with
the Falcons.
Cousineau's selection
drew little more than a few
murmurs of approval from
the more than 300 fans who
packed the gallery to watch
the proceedings.

For one thing, the Bills'
choice was no surprise.
Neither was the No. 2 choice,
by the Kansas City Chiefs,
who also sought defensive
help by selecting Colorado
State defensive end Mike
Bell.
But the real reason those
fans were there was to see
what New York's two teams,
the Giants and the )ets, would
do.
The Giants, with the
seventh pick, were expected
to go to quarterback Jack
Thompson, the Throwin' Sa
moan from Washington
State. But Cincinnati, picking
third, crossed them up. In
stead of taking Missouri tight
end Kellen Winslow (San
Diego took him 10 choices la
ter), the Bengals went for the
6-3, 215 pounder, who shat
tered numerous school, con
ference and NCAA passing
records, including 7818
career yards.
The Chicago Bears used the
No. 4 pick to take Arkansas
defensive tackle Dan
Hampton, Buffalo used its
other first-round pick to
select Clemson wide receiver
Jerry Butler. Then Baltimore
chose Alabama linebacker
Barry Krauss.
Then it was the Giants'
turn.
.If they still wanted a quar
terback there were a few
well-known names available,
Clemson's Steve Fuller,
Alabama's Jeff Rutledge, joe
Montana of Notre Dame and
Rick Leach of Michigan
among them.
Instead they went for a
"sleeper," little-known Phil
Simms from little-known
Morehead State in Kentucky.
The reaction from the crowd
was electric and unanimous
— and predictable. There was
booing, hissing, cursing and
fist-waving from fans who al
most have come to expect the
Giants to make first-round
picks of players destined for
failure.
About an hour later (the
first round lasted 2Vi hours,
10 minutes shorter than last
year), the fans cheered the
jets' selection of Alabama de
fensive end Marty Lyons.

The St. Louis Cardinals
picked Ottis "0.J." Ander
son, who became the Univer
sity of Miami's first 1000-yard
rusher last year with 1268.
Another top runner,
Charles Alexander of
Louisiana State, was selected
by Cincinnati.
Eddie Lee Ivery of Georgia
Tech, owner of the major col
lege single game rushing re
cord of 356 yards, was taken
by Green Bay.
North Carolina State run
ning back Ted Brown was
Minnesota's choice and the
Super Bowl champion
Pittsburgh Steelers closed
out the first round with the
fifth running back selected,
Greg Hawthorne of Baylor.
Among the other defensive
stars to go in the opening
round were UCLA tackle
Manu Tuiasosopo, Nebraska
linebacker George Andrews,
and UCLA linebacker jerry
Robinson.

JUNIOR KATHY Kelley winds up for a pass in the soccer teams'
match against UC-Berkeley earlier this season. The midfielder/
sweeper scored the go-ahead goal in the Cards 3-1 win over the
Golden Bears.
New York (AP) — The last
great linebacker to come out
of Ohio State was Randy
Cradishar. He helped turn
the Denver Broncos into a
Super Bowl team. Now
comes Tom Cousineau. He
may be the man who starts
Buffalo back toward respec
tability.
"The thought I've had from
watching the Bills is that they
need defensive help. They
score a lot of points," the
6-foot-3, 227-pound
Cousineau said Thursday
after they made him an in
stant millionaire by making
him the No, 1 selection in the
National Football League
draft.
"Being No. 1 is something
I've looked forward to for
years," he added during a
news conference one floor
down from the NFL's draft
headquarters, the Starlight
Roof ballroom on the 18th
floor of the Waldorf-Austoria.
The Bills had the chance to
makeCousineau No. 1 thanks
to the they engineered
last year when they sent O.J.
Simpson to the San Francisco
49ers. Losing him didn't hurt
their offense any. They
wound up drafting Terry Mil
ler and he wound up with
more than 1000 yards last sea
son.

It was obvious the leather
medallion Cousineau wore
around his neck, a gift from a
close friend, had done its job.
"He gave it to me to ensure
my welfare in the Big Apple,"
he said.
"I want to play in the NFL,
with the big boys. I want to
play and I'm going to play,"
he continued, shrugging off
any suggestions that he might
eye the Canadian Football
League as a way of jacking up
his price tag.
"I anticipate no problem in
signing ... I was in Buffalo
once fora physical. It seemed
nice . . . I've been playing for
14 years for satisfaction and
education. It's thrilling to
play a kid's game and get
paid. It's not work for me . . .
I would assume I can step
right in and start."
The Bills would assume so,
too. That would put
Cousineau in the same class
with Tommy Nobis, the last
linebacker picked No. 1 in the
draft, 13 years ago by Atlanta.
Nobis became an instant star
ter and later an All-Pro with
the Falcons.
Cousineau's selection
drew little more than a few
murmurs of approval from
the more than 300 fans who
packed the gallery to watch
the proceedings.

For one thing, the Bills'
choice was no surprise.
Neither was the No. 2 choice,
by the Kansas City Chiefs,
who also sought defensive
help by selecting Colorado
State defensive end Mike
Bell.
But the real reason those
fans were there was to see
what New York's two teams,
the Giants and the )ets, would
do.
The Giants, with the
seventh pick, were expected
to go to quarterback Jack
Thompson, the Throwin' Sa
moan from Washington
State. But Cincinnati, picking
third, crossed them up. In
stead of taking Missouri tight
end Kellen Winslow (San
Diego took him 10 choices la
ter), the Bengals went for the
6-3, 215 pounder, who shat
tered numerous school, con
ference and NCAA passing
records, including 7818
career yards.
The Chicago Bears used the
No. 4 pick to take Arkansas
defensive tackle Dan
Hampton, Buffalo used its
