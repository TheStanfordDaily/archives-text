# Cards travel to Arizona, ASU as 'Pack-10' heads for homestretch
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
The Stanford tennis team
puts its 5-1 record on the line
today and tomorrow when
they travel to Arizona today to
meet both Arizona and Arizona
State in dual matches. This will
be Stanford's first trip to
Arizona since the two schools
were inducted in the Pacific-10.
The Cards need two wins this
weekend to keep their chances
for a second straight undis

puted Pac-10titlealive. UCLA is
their biggest challenge and at
this point is one-half game
ahead of the Cards at 6-1. USC
suffered a loss to Arizona State
and is thus a game off the pace.
The Cards battle with both
UCLA and USC next week in
combined indoor-outdoor
matches at Stanford.
The Cards cannot afford to
look past the two Arizona
schools, although they occupy

the bottom spots in the Pac-10
tennis standings. Arizona gave
the Cards a scare last month at
Stanford Stadium, splitting the
singles before dropping all
three doubles matches.
The Sun Devils, although
next to last in the Pac-10, are
ranked 14th in the nation. On
paper the Cards should over
whelm them. It will be a re
match of the Ojai Pac-10 dou
bles finals which saw the top

Stanford team of Peter Rennert
and Lloyd Bourne defeat
Arizona State's Alan Waldman
and Eric Sherbeck 7-6,4-6, 7-6.
Bourne will also be seeking
revenge against Andy Gordon
of Arizona. The two battled in a
controversial three-set match
marred by questionable line
calls and arguments.
The Cards will once again be
without the services of senior
John Rast. Rast, who competed
in matches against California
and Arizona State before hav
ing to sit out because his back
tightened up, is still out indefi
nitely.
)im Hodges has replaced
Rast in the starting lineup and
performed admirably. Last
weekend in the Ojai open
tournament, Hodges used a
new backcourt style of play and
defeated the tournament's de
fending champion and number
two seed, Leo Palin, in three
sets. Hodges reached the quar
terfinals before having to de
fault because of stomach sick
ness.
Freshman Scott Bondurant,
who missed the Arizona State
match and played at 60 percent
against Arizona, is rested and
will be in the lineup this
weekend.
Peter Rennert will occupy
the top spot once again for the
Cards. Rennert, after a shaky
start, has really come around
and proved himself as one of
the top players in college ten
nis. Inthelastrankingsputout,
Rennert has jumped from
number 27 to number four
among college players.
Freshman starters Tim
Mayotte, Bondurant and Jeff
Arons will also be trying to im
prove their records. Mayotte
has picked up his game tre
mendously since the two-a-day
workouts this spring break and
is starting to play solid tennis.
Arons has been out of action
for a week since losing in the
first round in both singles and
doubles in Ojai. He split his
two matches with the Arizona
schools when they played
here.
