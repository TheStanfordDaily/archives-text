# Streleski gets eight years
## 
### 
Theodore Streleski, a 42-year-old former doc
toral candidate in mathematics here, was sen
tenced to eight years in prison for the second
degree murder of Mathematics Prof. Karel de-
Leeuw.
Santa Clara County Superior Court judge Mari
lyn PestarinoZecher sentenced Streleski Tuesday.
Streleski, convicted last March of the Aug. 18,1978
bludgeoning, had surrendered to authorities on
the day following the murder.
Deputy District Attorney Alan Nudleman said
Streleski would serve only four-and-a-half years
before he is eligible for parole.
Defense attorney James Blackman successfully
argued that Streleski had diminished mental
capacity at the time of the murder. Streleski's ad
mitted psychosis of persecution delusions came
from frustrations in finding a thesis adviser to as
sist him in selecting a dissertation for a doctorate
in mathematics, Blackman said in his closing
statement to the jury.
DeLeeuw was found dead in his office last Au
gust. During the two-week trial, testimony was
given by Santa Clara County Assistant Medical
Examiner-Coroner Chan Lee, who said deLeeuw's
death was caused by at least three blows to the
head with a "blunt instrument, hammer or

hammer-type."
Streleski testified that the killing was meant to
be a statement to the University, which he felt had
delayed his progress towards a doctorate.
Streleski came to the University from Illinois in
1959. He has been working intermittently on his
thesis since then. He testified that his moving
through a series of jobs and the disintegration of
his seven-year marriage in the 1970s was a direct
consequence of "the differences I'd had with the
(mathematics) department and with deLeeuw in
particular."
Streleski said he considered filing a civil suit for
the "damage" done to his life by "the parochial
arrogance of the professors at Stanford," but de
cided to kill somebody instead as a statement to
the University.
Streleski has admitted several times that he had
been planning the murder for eight years. He said
that he had a back-up candidate in mind in case he
did not kill deLeeuw.
Streleski believes he has accomplished his goal,
according to an adult probation report. He says
the murder was a final step in development of his
character.
Streleski will receive little, if any, psychiatric
care in prison. He said he hopes to continue study
ing mathematics there.
