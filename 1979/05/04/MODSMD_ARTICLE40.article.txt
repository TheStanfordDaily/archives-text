## UCLA at Sunken Diamond 
### Cathy Dickerson 
With the Pac-10 baseball sea
son drawing to a close and a
first-place league finish out of
Stanford's reach, the Cardinals
have turned their energy to
ward a second-place finish in
the Pac-10 Southern Division
which would give them an av
enue to this year's NCAA
championship.
However, the Cards must
mobilize more than minimal
energy to accomplish their
task. Stanford needs to win five
out of its next six league games
to boost itself into the no. two
spot in the standings. And the
two opponents Stanford has to
beat are UCLA and Cal, cur
rently first and second in the
division.
Today and Saturday the do
or-die series with the UCLA
Bruins will take place at Sun
ken Diamond. The single game
today will begin at 2:30 p.m.,
and Saturday's double-header
will commence at noon.
According to UCLA head
coach Gary Adams, this week
end's series will be one of
"conflicting interests."
"Our hopes are to win the
series ... we can clinch the
championship this weekend,"
Adams said. "Stanford, obvi
ously, will beoutto stayalivein
the race for second place."
Stanford, 10-14 in Pac-10
play, is currently three games
out of second behind Cal at
13-11. Other teams in the race
for the No. 2 spot are USC and
Arizona, each with 12-12 re
cords.
Playing at Los Angeles earlier
this season, the Cards were
beaten by the Bruins in two out
of three games — one of them
a 20-2 rout. This weekend,
however, the Cards will have at
least one thing going for them:
a home field advantage.
"We've never swept Stan
ford at Stanford," said Bruin
coach Adams, "but we have
been swept there by Stan
ford."
This past week both teams

played non-conference games
gearing up for the weekend.
Stanford posted a 7-2 victory
over Santa Clara on Tuesday.
UCLA added one win and one
loss to its record being
dumped by Long Beach State
Monday and bouncing back to
crush Southern California Col
lege (not USC) 19-2 Wednes
day.
In Wednesday's rout, Bruin
outfielder )im Auten tied the
all-time NCAA single season
home run record, tagging his
25th of the year. Auten, sport
ing a .358 batting average, will
oppose high school teammate
and now winningest pitcher in
Stanford baseball history,
Bruce Fiala, in one of the
games this weekend.
Fiala was the winning pitcher
in Stanford's only victory

against UCLA this year.
The tentative pitching
schedule for Stanford this
weekend, according to coach
Mark Marquess, sends ace left
hander Joe LoPresti to the
mound today, Fiala in the first
game Saturday and Brian Harri
son in the second game of the
twinbill. The rotation may
change, however, because
LoPresti has had a touch of the
flu this week and may not be
ready to pitch today.
UCLA will throw Tim Leary
and Dave Schmidt, two of the
nation's leading pitchers, in
the first two games of the
series. Leary has a 10-1 record
with a 2.30 ERA, and Schmidt is
10-0 with an ERA of 4.35. The
final game on Saturday will be
pitched by Tim Page or first
year Bruin, Matt Young.

spot in the standings. And the
two opponents Stanford has to
beat are UCLA and Cal, cur
rently first and second in the
division.
Today and Saturday the do
or-die series with the UCLA
Bruins will take place at Sun
ken Diamond. The single game
today will begin at 2:30 p.m.,
and Saturday's double-header
will commence at noon.
According to UCLA head
coach Gary Adams, this week
end's series will be one of
"conflicting interests."
"Our hopes are to win the
series ... we can clinch the
championship this weekend,"
Adams said. "Stanford, obvi
ously, will beoutto stayalivein
the race for second place."
Stanford, 10-14 in Pac-10
play, is currently three games
out of second behind Cal at
13-11. Other teams in the race
for the No. 2 spot are USC and
Arizona, each with 12-12 re
cords.
Playing at Los Angeles earlier
this season, the Cards were
beaten by the Bruins in two out
of three games — one of them
a 20-2 rout. This weekend,
however, the Cards will have at
least one thing going for them:
a home field advantage.
"We've never swept Stan
ford at Stanford," said Bruin
coach Adams, "but we have
been swept there by Stan
ford."
This past week both teams

played non-conference games
gearing up for the weekend.
Stanford posted a 7-2 victory
over Santa Clara on Tuesday.
UCLA added one win and one
loss to its record being
dumped by Long Beach State
Monday and bouncing back to
crush Southern California Col
lege (not USC) 19-2 Wednes
day.
In Wednesday's rout, Bruin
outfielder )im Auten tied the
all-time NCAA single season
home run record, tagging his
25th of the year. Auten, sport
ing a .358 batting average, will
oppose high school teammate
and now winningest pitcher in
Stanford baseball history,
Bruce Fiala, in one of the
games this weekend.
Fiala was the winning pitcher
in Stanford's only victory

against UCLA this year.
The tentative pitching
schedule for Stanford this
weekend, according to coach
Mark Marquess, sends ace left
hander Joe LoPresti to the
mound today, Fiala in the first
game Saturday and Brian Harri
son in the second game of the
twinbill. The rotation may
change, however, because
LoPresti has had a touch of the
flu this week and may not be
ready to pitch today.
UCLA will throw Tim Leary
and Dave Schmidt, two of the
nation's leading pitchers, in
the first two games of the
series. Leary has a 10-1 record
with a 2.30 ERA, and Schmidt is
10-0 with an ERA of 4.35. The
final game on Saturday will be
pitched by Tim Page or first
year Bruin, Matt Young.
