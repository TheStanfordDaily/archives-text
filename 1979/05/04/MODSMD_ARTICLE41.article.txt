# Finish league play 8-0
## Booters smash Santa Cruz 
### Dean Eyre 
What was originally
scheduled as a league matchup
turned out to be a soccer clinic
as Stanford routed Santa Cruz
Wednesday afternoon 11-1.
The victory earns a perfect
8-0 league finish for Stanford,
good for one point of the two
needed to capture the North
ern California Women's Inter
collegiate Soccer Conference.
The Cardinals have their
chance to get the second point
of the Schaunnesy-style playoff
when they enter the league's
round robin competition next
weekend at Davis.
"Santa Cruz was completely
outclassed," said Stanford
head coach Phil Wright. "Its
not that they're a bad team, but
we have hit our peak in play
ing."
After their usual warming up
period in the first 10 minutes of
the match, Stanford began the
onslaught. Cindy Shorney set

off the scoring string, followed
by a pair of goals from Ellen
Griep, the second one assisted
by Shorney.
Then came the barrage â€” in
a span of 17 minutes the Cards
burst through the Santa Cruz
defense for six goals. Three
minutes after Griep's second
goal Shorney tallied. Next it
was Ronnie Vella and Kathy
Kelley, both assisted by Shor
ney. Griep accounted for
another pair of goals, giving
the Cards a 8-0 halftime lead.
In the second half, Nancy
Geisse put in a shot after 18
minutes had elapsed. Seven
minutes later Maria Duryea
scored. Shorney then sent a
beautiful pass across the
mouth of the Santa Cruz goal
which was knocked in by a SCU
fullback to wrap up the Stan
ford scoring.
The lone goal for Santa Cruz
came with 10 minutes remain
ing in the game.

Although somewhat disap
pointed with the almost inevit
able letdown during the sec
ond half of play, Wright
praised a hustling offense and
a solid defense which per
formed well despite several
key injuries.
Stanford's second team
hosts the second team from
Marin's Katherine Branson
School today at 3:45 p.m.
In recording a perfect league
season the Cards have com
piled some impressive statis
tics including a string of 28
straight victories against col
lege teams dating back to the
third game of last season. In
their eight league matches, the
Cards have been averaging
5.625 goals scored per game
while allowing their opponents
only .625 goals per game. Indi
vidually, Griep has been the
leading goal producer, ac
counting for 14 tallies in the last
six contests.
