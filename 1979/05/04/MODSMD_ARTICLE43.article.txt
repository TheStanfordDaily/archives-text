Stanford Cycling Club will be
sponsoring the fifth and final
intercollegiate criterium of the
1979 season this Sunday, May
6. The start of the .7 mile
course will be in front of Wil
bur Hall, through the Wilbur
parking lot, onto Campus
Drive with a right on Galvez,
around Stern Hall and back on
Escondido.
Cycling teams from northern
and southern California have
been competing in the inter
collegiate circuit. Santa Bar
bara has shown its strength in
struggling for the lead against
the San Diego team that won
the Santa Barbara intercol
legiate event. Also in the com
petition is the Santa Cruz team
which only recently de
monstrated their strength
when they won the Santa Cruz
criterium two weeks ago.
Approximately eight riders
will represent Stanford in the
twenty mile novice race and
the twenty-eight mile expert
event on Sunday. Bob Chi Ids, a
strong rider who has done very
well in his first racing season,
taking a second in the upper
division race at Santa Cruz, will
again be competing in the ex
pert division. Mike Crager, a
category one rider who also
races for Palo Alto Bicycle
Club, will be racing with Childs
in the expert race along with
|ohn Toor, the treasurer for the
Stanford Bike Club and a major
organizer of the race.

Riders competing in the
novice race also have an excel
lent chance of gaining points
for Stanford. Stanford riders
were very strong in both the
Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara
criteriums. Bruce Pauly and
Bruce Ishimoto, the president
of the club, have been training
and racing together since the
fall.They will be working for
points along with Jim Seidel, a
new member of the team who
placed fifth in his first race at
Santa Cruz.
The women's criterium of
fourteen laps equalling about
ten miles should also be an ex
citing race. At races in Clarem
ont, Santa Barbara, and Santa
Cruz the competition has been
tight between Susan Van
Cundy from San Diego and
Kim Williams of Claremont.
The women from Santa Barbara
have formed a challenging
team, as has Santa Cruz, who
only recently have shown their
power.
Last year the Stanford Cycl
ing Club sponsored the only
intercollegiate criterium of the
season. This year's race, the
last for team points on the in
tercollegiate circuit, will be
very exciting. The women's
race begins at 8:30 a.m., the
novice race at 9:15 a.m., and
the expert at 11 a.m. In addi
tion, the 10-mile intramural
race will be held on Sunday at
10:15 a.m. on the same course.
T-shirts and beer will be fea
tured.
