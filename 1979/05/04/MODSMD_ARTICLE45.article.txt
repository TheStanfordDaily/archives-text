# Crew outstroked in L.A.

### Gray Maxwell 
The men's crew team
traveled south last weekend to
compete against USC, UCLA,
Orange Coast (OCC), and Ir
vine (UCI). Though the Cardi
nal boats were unable to pick
up any victories, the frosh and
varsity eights looked extremely
tough and are expected to do
well in the upcoming Pac-10
Championships and Western
Sprints.
The frosh eight raced USC
and UCLA at Marina del Rey
Saturday and came within sev
eral feet of replacing UCLA as
the fifth fastest frosh boat on
the West Coast. Both UCLA
and Stanford blew past USC in
the first 500 meters of the race,
and UCLA maintained a one
length lead over Stanford over
the body of the course. a
sprint closed the margin to a
tew seats, but UCLA managed
to win by three-tenths of a sec
ond, crossing the line in 6:00.7
while Stanford's time was
6:01.0. USC was third with a
time of 6:11.
Frosh coach Mark Grosen
baugh was pleased with the
team's performance despite
the tough loss. "It's no shame
to lose to UCLA at Marina del
Rey. This course is worth a
length to UCLA, especially

when they draw the fast lane,
and that's more than the dis
tance they won by today. Cal
and UCLA were in a dead heat
two weeks ago up at Oakland,
so we should definitely have a
shot at Cal when they come to
Redwood Shores."
The varsity eight jumped to
an early lead over UCLA and
USC, but were unable to main
tain the high stroke rate for
more than 1500 meters. UCLA
moved past the varsity with a
couple hundred meters to go,
and won by five seconds (a 5:54
to Stanford's 5:59). The varsi
ty's second place showing en
abled them to finish in front of
USC for the third consecutive
time this season (USC finished
in 6:04).
The novice eight was de
feated by UCLA while the JV
eight finished one length be
hind USC and two and one-half
lengths behind UCLA.
The team traveled further
south to race Orange Coast
and Irvine on Sunday, two of
the finest crews on the West
Coast. Emotional and physical
letdowns after the heart
breaking losses to UCLA and
the long tr ip to Newport Beach
were contributing factors as
OCC and UCI dominated the
day.

OCC, UCI, and Stanford
seemed to be the order of the
day as Orange Coast won
the novice and JV races with
Irvine grabbing second, and
Stanford taking third in each
event.
The varsity eight raced Irvine
in Sunday's final event.
(Orange Coast is a junior col
lege and does not race varsity
eights). Irvine jumped to what
appeared to be a comfortable
lead, but the Cardinal eight put
on a furious sprint and gained a
full length on Irvine in the final
200 meters, falling two seconds
short of upsetting UCI. UCI
crossed the line in 6:10, barely
edging out Stanford's time of
6:12.
Varsity coach Phil Waters
commented that "It's tough to
lose a couple of close ones on a
trip down south, but I'm en
couraged by what I saw. It'll be
good to race up north again,
and I think the crew will peak
for Cal and the Pac-10 Champ
ionships," being held on May
19.
The Stanford Crew hopes to
rebound this weekend and will
be competing against several
schools, including Santa Bar
bara, Santa Clara, and Hum
boldt. The races will be held at
the Lexington Reservoir at Los
Gatos on Saturday.

an early lead over UCLA and
USC, but were unable to main
tain the high stroke rate for
more than 1500 meters. UCLA
moved past the varsity with a
couple hundred meters to go,
and won by five seconds (a 5:54
to Stanford's 5:59). The varsi
ty's second place showing en
abled them to finish in front of
USC for the third consecutive
time this season (USC finished
in 6:04).
The novice eight was de
feated by UCLA while the JV
eight finished one length be
hind USC and two and one-half
lengths behind UCLA.
The team traveled further
south to race Orange Coast
and Irvine on Sunday, two of
the finest crews on the West
Coast. Emotional and physical
letdowns after the heart
breaking losses to UCLA and
the long tr ip to Newport Beach
were contributing factors as
OCC and UCI dominated the
day.

OCC, UCI, and Stanford
seemed to be the order of the
day as Orange Coast won
the novice and JV races with
Irvine grabbing second, and
Stanford taking third in each
event.
The varsity eight raced Irvine
in Sunday's final event.
(Orange Coast is a junior col
lege and does not race varsity
eights). Irvine jumped to what
appeared to be a comfortable
lead, but the Cardinal eight put
on a furious sprint and gained a
full length on Irvine in the final
200 meters, falling two seconds
short of upsetting UCI. UCI
crossed the line in 6:10, barely
edging out Stanford's time of
6:12.
Varsity coach Phil Waters
commented that "It's tough to
lose a couple of close ones on a
trip down south, but I'm en
couraged by what I saw. It'll be
good to race up north again,
and I think the crew will peak
for Cal and the Pac-10 Champ
ionships," being held on May
19.
The Stanford Crew hopes to
rebound this weekend and will
be competing against several
schools, including Santa Bar
bara, Santa Clara, and Hum
boldt. The races will be held at
the Lexington Reservoir at Los
Gatos on Saturday.
