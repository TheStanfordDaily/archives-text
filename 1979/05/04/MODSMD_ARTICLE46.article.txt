Gov't doubles exposure estimate
Washington — The government yesterday dou
bled its estimate of radiation exposure to the pub
lic from the Three Mile Island nuclear accident,
prompting HEW Secretary Joseph Califano to pre
dict at least one additional cancer death among
residents of the area.
Califano also told a Senate hearing that some
scientists "would predict up to 10 additional
cancer deaths" for the two million central
Pennsylvania residents living within 50 miles of the
stricken plant.
Califano said he expects an even higher figure
will be reported in a fuller analysis of the data that
is expected to be completed and made public next
week by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Testifying to a Senate Governmental Affairs sub
committee, Califano said that one reason the gov
ernment initially underestimated the dose from
Three Mile Island was that, during the first three
days of the accident, when releases were the high
est, fewer than 20 radiation monitors were in
place.
Some areas had no radiation monitors and,
"moreover, it is uncertain how many persons were
located in each area," Califano testified.
And he said that workers at the plant and those
engaged in clean-up operations "have been ex
posed to significantly higher levels of radiation
and will face significantly greater health risks than
the general population."
"Although one additional fatal cancer oreven 10
fatal cancers may seem small statistically ... it is
nonetheless ultimately significant for the indi
viduals who become these statistics," said
Califano.
Citizens favor windfall profits tax
New York — Americans overwhelmingly favor
President Jimmy Carter's proposal for a windfall
profits tax on oil companies, even if they don't
care much for his decision to lift price controls on
domestic crude oil, an Associated Press-NBC
News poll shows.
The public favors a new tax to keep oil company
profits down, and they also blame oil companies
the most for higher prices on gasoline and heating
oil, according to the poll, taken Monday and
Tuesday.
On April 5, Carter made the second major
energy speech of his administration, announcing
his decision to gradually lift price controls on old
domestic crude oil and asking Congress to impose

a new tax on oil companies to prevent them from
reaping excessive profits due to his decision.
Carter's decision gathered the support of only
37 percent of the public, while half said they op
posed it. Thirteen percent of the 1600 adults inter
viewed nationwide by telephone were not sure.
But the flipside of Carter's decision — asking for
a windfall profits tax on oil companies — drew
substantial public backing.
Nearly two-thirds of those interviewed said they
support a new tax on oil companies. About 24
percent opposed the action and 10 percent were
not sure.
State Dept. judgment 'inefficient'
Washington — The State Department was guilty
of extreme inefficiency and serious mistakes in
judgment in its reaction to events leading up to the
mass murder-suicide at the Peoples Temple com
mune in Guyana, a department report said yester
day.
But the report said it would be "pure specula
tion" to say whether improved performance by
the department might have prevented the deaths
of Rep. Leo Ryan (D-Calif.) and four companions
or those of more than 900 followers of the Rev. Jim
Jones.
One instance cited as an error was the handling
of the warning from Jonestown defector Deborah
Layton Blakey that Jones was rehearsing his fol
lowers in mass suicide.
Blakey escaped from the commune May 12,
1978, and went to the embassy for help. She gave a
signed statement to consul Richard McCoy accus
ing Jones of running "a concentration camp."
Blakey flew to Washington with McCoy after the
embassy gave her an emergency passport. On the
plane, she told him about the suicide rehearsals.
A month later, in San Francisco, she signed an
affidavit repeating her charges. Copies were sent
to the department.
Her warnings had little or no impact, the report
said. The statement she signed at the embassy was
never forwarded to Washington.
Terrorist gang strikes in Rome
Rome — In a daring daylight attack a month
before elections, a terrorist gang raided the Rome
headquarters of the Christian Democrat Party yes
terday morning, exploded bombs in the building
and escaped after killing a police officer and
wounding two others critically.
The gang, which may have numbered as many as

15 members, scrawled the five-pointed star sym
bol of the Red Brigades, Italy's most feared ter
rorist gang, on the walls inside and sprayed in red
letters: "We will transform the electoral fraud into
a class war."
In March 1978 the Red Brigades kidnapped
Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro and left his
bullet-riddled body in downtown Rome May 9.
Yesterday's attack came two weeks after a pow
erful bomb destroyed the portal of Rome's
Michelangelo-designed city hall on the Capitoline
Hill.
The attacks heightened fears of widespread vio
lence during the political campaign leading up to
general elections June 3 and 4. The vote is viewed
as a referendum on whether the strong Com
munist Party should get a place in government. Up
to now the Christian Democrats have refused
them a Cabinet spot in this NATO country.
White statement makes jury cry
San Francisco — Dan White, his head about to
"burst" and his ears "roaring," shot Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
after a tortured bid to regain his Board of Super
visors seat, according to a taped statement played
yesterday to weeping jurors in White's first-degree
murder trial.
As about half of the 12-member jury and some
spectators openly cried, prosecutors played the
25-minute statement White gave homicide inspec
tors when he surrendered last Nov. 27, shortly
after Moscone and Milk were killed by gunfire at
City Hall.
White continuously wept as he gave his state
ment, his voice incoherent at times. As he heard
the tape again in court, he broke down and stab
bed at the defense table.
Later yesterday the prosecution called the last of
19 witnesses to the stand. The state expected to
formally rest its case today.
On the day of the shootings, White says on the
tape, he went to City Hall hoping to regain the
supervisorial post he resigned Nov. 10, citing fi
nancial difficulties.
He said he walked into the mayor's office just
before Moscone was to name his successor "and
then my head didn't seem right.
"I asked him was I going to be reappointed,"
White said. "He said no.' He was talking but no
thing was getting through to me. It was like a
roaring in my ears. And that was it. I just shot him.
It was over."
