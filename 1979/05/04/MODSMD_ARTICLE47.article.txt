The Faculty Senate voted yesterday
to establish an ad hoc committee of
inquiry into the status of emeriti pro
fessors.
The new committee established by
the Faculty Senate will survey the
existing conditions of emeriti and de
termine possible improvements that
can be made in the University's pol
icy towards emeritus faculty and
staff.
"It is time fora careful examination
of the current status to alleviate the
difficulties of retirement for
emeriti," said Sanford Dornbusch,
professor of sociology and a member
of the Faculty Senate steering com
mittee.
"We need to see what our current
situation is, and get a reflection from
the current emeriti as to what the
future holds . . . what might be
done," he said.
Not all Faculty Senate members fa
vored establishment of the commit
tee, however.
Noting that the Faculty Senate
already proliferates with commit
tees, Leslie Zatz, protessorof radiol
ogy, said he felt the duties of the
emeriti status committee overlapped
with those of other committees.
Zatz also questioned the intent of
the committee.
"There is almost the perception
that the University should be taking
better care of emeriti," Zatz said.
"I'm not sure the University

should be saddled with furthercosts,
a further nurturing of us, when we
retire," he said.
Recent state and federal legislation
regarding mandatory retirement has
prompted a long-term review of re
tirement policies here.
Federal regulations prohibit man
datory retirement before age 70,
while California law imposes no
limit. The University will be bound to
California law, and therefore there
will be no limit in retirement age.
An administrative panel on retire
ment recommended to the Faculty
Senate in March, however, that the
University take advantage of state
and federal retirement laws, which
allow policies of mandatory retire
ment at age 65 to remain in effect
until June 30, 1982. A total of 67 fa
culty members are in the affected
group.
Zatz, predicting that he would be
overruled by the majority of the se
nate, requested that a clause be in
serted in the charge to the commit
tee specifying that action be taken on
behalf of the emeriti only if deemed
"necessary." There were no objec
tions, however, and the clause was
added.
The five members of the commit
tee (two of whom must be senate
members) are to be appointed by the
Committee on Committees. The
committee's first report is due to be
presented to the senate by the end of
the autumn quarter.
