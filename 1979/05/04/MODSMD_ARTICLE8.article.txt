# BUG ME
## 
### Rod Stevens 
Dear Bug Me,
I like to sit on the patio outside of Tresidder
near The More. Sometimes I see a woman come
out on the Tresidder balcony and mysteriously
lower an airline travel bag to the floor below. Is
that contraband material being passed?
R.C.H.
Nothing so mysterious as that, I'm afraid.
Sequoia Travel personnel have offices on both
floors of Tresidder and use the bag to save them
from carrying materials up and down the stairs
each day. Although tickets are purchased
downstairs, they are prepared upstairs where
other records and accounting materials are
kept.
Dear Hug Me:
I understand that six visiting scholars from
China arrived at Stanford last year to do research.
Are they still here, and ,ire more scholars from
China expected''
-M.M.
Not only are the six scholars who arrived in
November still here, but they've been joined by
seven more. Two arrived in February, four in
March and one in April. Tom fingar, research
associate in the U.S.-China relations program,
said the professors and one graduate student
will be here into the summer. All of them are
working in the pure sciences, engineering or
computer sc ienc e. A few are also taking classes
while pursuing their research.
In the next few years, according to fingar,
Stanford will ideally have the same number of
professors in China on a per-man, per-month
basis as visit here. Presently two Stanford pro-

fessors are there through the program, and
others are visiting through different capacities.
Dear Hug Me:
Why won't the library system accept my meal
card when I check out books?
-8.8.
Susan McCoy, privileges division supervisor
in Green Library, said a "valid form of library
identification" is required ot the more than
25,000 users of Stanford libraries in order to
borrow library material. Meal cards aren't in
cluded in this category.
"For student borrowers the official library
card for Green and Meyer Basement is the vali
dated student registration card," she said, quot
ing library borrowing regulations.
Robert Houghton, associate registrar, esti
mated that 10,970 persons are carrying registra
tion I.D. cards this spring. Karolyn Caskin, ad
ministrative assistant in the University Food Ser
vice, said only about 45 persons who have meal
cards are not registered, although this number
rises sharply during the summer when visitors
stay in the dorms.
112 lizabeth Salzer, head librarian at Meyer, said
Meyer personnel began requiring I.D.s some
time after 1975 when the main library asked
them to conform with the other libraries' prac
tices. She said she doesn't retail having any
problem with the old system of meal cards, but
that the library system feared the "potential" of
abuse.
