# Privacy or isolation?
## Students describe life off campus 
### Chris Mills 
"They're as happy as clams
out there," Dean ot Student Af
fairs lames Lyons said recently,
referring to those off-campus
students who like their living
situation and wouldn't dream
of returning to on-campus ac
commodations
In a 1977 survey conducted
by the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs, three out of
four off-campus students indi
cated they preferred living off
campus and had no desire to
return to local residences.
More privacy, more freedom in
lifestyles and more flexibility in
meals were the main reasons
given.
The survey polled more than
500 of Stanford's 1000 under
graduates and 41)00 graduates
who lived off campus that year.
The students described their
living situations, estimated
their living costs and told of the
advantages and disadvantages
of life off the Farm.
Two-thirds of the students
lived in Palo Alto or Menlo
Park, most of them in apart
ments or shared houses. About
30 percent were living alone,
renting rooms in private
homes. More than 85 percent
had little difficulty getting to
and from campus. Nearly 90
percent had cooking facilities

and ate regularly at home.
The individuals polled gen
erally agreed that most stu
dents would benefit from a
year otf campus as a learning
experience. Many also agreed
that otf-campus living keeps
academic activities in better
perspective and encourages
independence, self-reliance
and maturity.
Not all happy
But not all students were so
happy. The survey also found
that more than 20 percent suf
fered isolation from friends,
had a hard time becoming in
volved with other students and
faculty and encountered diffi
culty getting to the cultural and
recreational events on cam
pus.
These "unhappy off's" were
more numerous among
sophomores and juniors, the
survey showed, and tewer of
them had cars than did the
"happy off's."
However, most students
seem to adjust to the tribula
tions of off-campus life.
"It was a lot more isolated
than I thought it would be be
fore I went," said junior Laura
Mead, referring to her off
campus experience. She said
she alleviated the isolation by
becoming an on-campus eat
ing associate.

Mead, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said she
wants to set up an information
tenter where off-campus stu
dents can learn about campus
activities. She also said she
hopes to remodel Tresidder
Union "to foster more of a
community feeling.
"When off-campus students
are on campus they want to be
among friends," she said.
"You do miss the spon
taneity of campus life," civil
engineering senior Carlos
Hernandez said, "but I'm in
volved with a fraternity. I don't
feel lonely. I make the effort to
go visit people."
Hernandez said he had to re
linguish his apartment in fash
ionable Sharon Heights when
he could no longer afford it.
But he still prefers living off
campus.
"I do not miss the Stanford
campus," he declared.
Landlord problems
Douglas Apostol, interna
tional relations senior, rented a
room in a private home in
south Palo Alto during autumn
quarter, but moved back on
campus when he fell into a
"bad personal relationship"
with his landlady.
Nancy Hood of the Rental
Housing Mediation Task Force
in Palo Alto said the most
common problem students
' have with their landlords is get
ting their deposits back. Less
frequent problems are attemp
ted evictions and persuading
owners to make repairs.
Cities around campus pro
hibit more than ? tos unrelated
adults from living together in a
single-family house, but few
students have had problems
with these laws, which are not
enthusiastically enforced, ac
cording to a Palo Alto ordi
i nance compliance inspector.
Tighter market
Many indicators point to a
tighter rental housing market
next year.
The Rental Housing Office
received 24 percent fewer list
ings in August and September
I 1978 than it did during the
| same period in 1977. Palo Alto
has had an overall vacancy rate
of less than two percent since
1974, and it dropped to less
than one percent in 1977.
A lanuary housing study by
flie University concluded that
"over the next decade there
will be fewer rental units avail
able to Stanford students in
communities close to campus,
and that a smaller number of
those units will be within a
price range that most students
can afford."
Some of the pressure is ex
pected to be alleviated by the
800 on-campus units now
"being planned, but these will
not be ready for occupancy
until at least the 1982-8 i school

year, according to Lyons.
Despite the indicators, most
students have not yet had
much trouble finding satisfac
tory housing.
"We may have captured part
of the market," Lyons said.
Since the advent of the
Guaranteed Housing Plan,
students have learned to plan
well in advance which year
they will spend off campus. He
saici the result is that more un
dergraduates tind housing in
the spring by word-of-mouth.
The 1977 survey showed that
50 percent of the grads and 20
percent of the undergrads
found housing by July 1,
another 40 percent by Sept. 1,
and by Registration Day in the
fall only 10 to 15 percent were
still looking.
Clearinghouse
Of the students who used
the Rental Housing Office's
Clearinghouse last fall, 80
percent found housing in less
than a week, and nearly all
found housing within a price
range they expected.

The Clearinghouse is oper
ated in Tresidder Union for
three weeks prior to Registra
tion Day in September. It offers
students hundreds of rental
listings, free local phone calls,
temporary lodging in Stern
"Hotel" and other student ser
vices.
last fall rental rates jumped
in response to Proposition 15,
but prices seem to have leveled
off, according to Rental Hous
ing Office supervisor |une
Becker.
"The price increases may
have reached their limits,"
Becker said. She gave these
typical price ranges for hous
ing now available in the Stan
ford area, listed in the adjacent
box.
For next fall, Mead said sheis
planning to hold an off-campus
workshop during the Clearin
ghouse to help students with
budgeting, roommate selec
tion, transportation and other
problems of off-campus living.
Also, the Residential Educa
tion Office is planning to reis
sue Life Off the Farm, a hand
book for off-campus students
that was last printed in 1977.

I 1978 than it did during the
| same period in 1977. Palo Alto
has had an overall vacancy rate
of less than two percent since
1974, and it dropped to less
than one percent in 1977.
A lanuary housing study by
flie University concluded that
"over the next decade there
will be fewer rental units avail
able to Stanford students in
communities close to campus,
and that a smaller number of
those units will be within a
price range that most students
can afford."
Some of the pressure is ex
pected to be alleviated by the
800 on-campus units now
"being planned, but these will
not be ready for occupancy
until at least the 1982-8 i school

year, according to Lyons.
Despite the indicators, most
students have not yet had
much trouble finding satisfac
tory housing.
"We may have captured part
of the market," Lyons said.
Since the advent of the
Guaranteed Housing Plan,
students have learned to plan
well in advance which year
they will spend off campus. He
saici the result is that more un
dergraduates tind housing in
the spring by word-of-mouth.
The 1977 survey showed that
50 percent of the grads and 20
percent of the undergrads
found housing by July 1,
another 40 percent by Sept. 1,
and by Registration Day in the
fall only 10 to 15 percent were
still looking.
Clearinghouse
Of the students who used
the Rental Housing Office's
Clearinghouse last fall, 80
percent found housing in less
than a week, and nearly all
found housing within a price
range they expected.

The Clearinghouse is oper
ated in Tresidder Union for
three weeks prior to Registra
tion Day in September. It offers
students hundreds of rental
listings, free local phone calls,
temporary lodging in Stern
"Hotel" and other student ser
vices.
last fall rental rates jumped
in response to Proposition 15,
but prices seem to have leveled
off, according to Rental Hous
ing Office supervisor |une
Becker.
"The price increases may
have reached their limits,"
Becker said. She gave these
typical price ranges for hous
ing now available in the Stan
ford area, listed in the adjacent
box.
For next fall, Mead said sheis
planning to hold an off-campus
workshop during the Clearin
ghouse to help students with
budgeting, roommate selec
tion, transportation and other
problems of off-campus living.
Also, the Residential Educa
tion Office is planning to reis
sue Life Off the Farm, a hand
book for off-campus students
that was last printed in 1977.
"They're as happy as clams
out there," Dean ot Student Af
fairs lames Lyons said recently,
referring to those off-campus
students who like their living
situation and wouldn't dream
of returning to on-campus ac
commodations
In a 1977 survey conducted
by the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs, three out of
four off-campus students indi
cated they preferred living off
campus and had no desire to
return to local residences.
More privacy, more freedom in
lifestyles and more flexibility in
meals were the main reasons
given.
The survey polled more than
500 of Stanford's 1000 under
graduates and 41)00 graduates
who lived off campus that year.
The students described their
living situations, estimated
their living costs and told of the
advantages and disadvantages
of life off the Farm.
Two-thirds of the students
lived in Palo Alto or Menlo
Park, most of them in apart
ments or shared houses. About
30 percent were living alone,
renting rooms in private
homes. More than 85 percent
had little difficulty getting to
and from campus. Nearly 90
percent had cooking facilities

and ate regularly at home.
The individuals polled gen
erally agreed that most stu
dents would benefit from a
year otf campus as a learning
experience. Many also agreed
that otf-campus living keeps
academic activities in better
perspective and encourages
independence, self-reliance
and maturity.
Not all happy
But not all students were so
happy. The survey also found
that more than 20 percent suf
fered isolation from friends,
had a hard time becoming in
volved with other students and
faculty and encountered diffi
culty getting to the cultural and
recreational events on cam
pus.
These "unhappy off's" were
more numerous among
sophomores and juniors, the
survey showed, and tewer of
them had cars than did the
"happy off's."
However, most students
seem to adjust to the tribula
tions of off-campus life.
"It was a lot more isolated
than I thought it would be be
fore I went," said junior Laura
Mead, referring to her off
campus experience. She said
she alleviated the isolation by
becoming an on-campus eat
ing associate.

Mead, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said she
wants to set up an information
tenter where off-campus stu
dents can learn about campus
activities. She also said she
hopes to remodel Tresidder
Union "to foster more of a
community feeling.
"When off-campus students
are on campus they want to be
among friends," she said.
"You do miss the spon
taneity of campus life," civil
engineering senior Carlos
Hernandez said, "but I'm in
volved with a fraternity. I don't
feel lonely. I make the effort to
go visit people."
Hernandez said he had to re
linguish his apartment in fash
ionable Sharon Heights when
he could no longer afford it.
But he still prefers living off
campus.
"I do not miss the Stanford
campus," he declared.
Landlord problems
Douglas Apostol, interna
tional relations senior, rented a
room in a private home in
south Palo Alto during autumn
quarter, but moved back on
campus when he fell into a
"bad personal relationship"
with his landlady.
Nancy Hood of the Rental
Housing Mediation Task Force
in Palo Alto said the most
common problem students
' have with their landlords is get
ting their deposits back. Less
frequent problems are attemp
ted evictions and persuading
owners to make repairs.
Cities around campus pro
hibit more than ? tos unrelated
adults from living together in a
single-family house, but few
students have had problems
with these laws, which are not
enthusiastically enforced, ac
cording to a Palo Alto ordi
i nance compliance inspector.

tighter rental housing market
next year.
