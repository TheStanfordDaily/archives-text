# Libertarians versus McCloskey
## Service plan sparks emotional debate 
### Mark Nassutti 
It was libertarianism versus the draft
Saturday afternoon as Congressman Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) again defended
the concept of compulsory national youth
service with military and civilian options in
a heated and emotionally charged debate
interrupted by cheers, jeers and one rather
irrational outburst from an ex-GI.
The debate, sponsored by the Stanford
Libertarians, drew an overflow crowd of
more than 400 to Bishop Auditorium for
two hours of pro and con arguments on the
issue "Resolved: The United States should
return to an involuntary draft and national
service."
Roy Childs, editor of Libertarian Review,
and Milton Mueller, national director of
Students for a Libertarian Society (SLS),
questioned the alleged failure of the volun
teer army, asking McCloskey why he
deemed an army of 2.1 million men insuffi
cient to defend the LJnited States.
McCloskey and his debate partner, Terry
Cullinan, a director of marketing at SRI In
ternational and a trustee for the National
Service Secretariat, concentrated their ar
guments on how to provide the United
States with an army equitably composed
and capable of honoring America's wide-

spread overseas commitments.
Defense burden
Citing what he called an "unfair distribu
tion of the burden of national defense,"
McCloskey indicated the6o percent minor
ity composition of today's army could only
be remedied by turning to a program such
as his.
According to the Libertarians, McClos
key never addressed what the Libertarians
called an indelible link between the draft
and American foreign policy.
Childs said, "We have been told the vol
unteer army is insufficient. We have been
told sufficient manpower could not be
mobilized quickly enough. But the ques
tion is, sufficient . . . for what? Mobilized
... for what? What is this new army sup
posed to do?
Size of military questioned
"The Pentagon," Childs added, "tells us
our present armed forces could not re
spond to emergencies in both Europe and
Asia at the same time. So what?
"The government continues to use the
Russian threat to convince people to just sit
still and accept more government control.
The goal is simple — for the government to
have first claim on the lives of the American
people and to do whatever the hell it wants

with them."
Cullinan asked the crowd "If there is no
draft, then what do you do if you wish to
fight against some potential aggressor?"
drawing boos, hisses and shouts of "No
draft, no war!"
The ex-C.l approached McCloskey and
stood next to him, shouting about his disil
lusionment with the military service in the
Vietnam War and threatening debate or
ganizers who attempted to remove him
from the auditorium. The man soon left the
auditorium under his own power, saying
that he did not have a question for the
debaters.
At one point, McCloskey apologized for
past overseas uses of U.S. armed forces.
Referring to what he called "the Vietnam
meatgrinder," he said, "I don't think we'll
ever go to war again to defend a particular
form of government in a particular coun
try."
McCloskey unsuccessfully opposed
President Richard Nixon for the Republi
can presidential nomination in 1972 on a
platform advocating immediate withdrawal
from the Vietnam War.
Draft necessity
The Libertarians asked why the United
States does need a draft.

McCloskey said, "None of us want to go
back to the draft if the volunteer system is
working. If it is not working, then the draft
is necessary as a matter of fairness and
equitable distribution of the burden (of na
tional defense)."
McCloskey is concerned that the present
system of voluntary military enlistment at
tracts less qualified personnel and results
in an army that is not what he calls "ready
to go into action on 24 hours notice."
Army a deterrent?
McCloskey said that a strong, combat
ready army is in fact a deterrent to war.
Given a weak U.S. military, McCloskey said
the Soviet Union might be tempted to sim
ply take over some European or Asian na
tion, believing the United States would not
and could not intervene short of using nuc
lear weapons.
McCloskey said this is a dangerous situa
tion for any nation to be in, as without a
credible conventional deterrent, the only
remaining one is the threat of nuclear
holocaust, an option for which the United
States has stated its reluctance.
The debate was the culmination of Peace
Week, sponsored by various anti-draft or
ganizations in an effort to mobilize resis
tance against military registration or con

scription.
Congressional action
McCloskey's national service plan is one
of a dozen similar proposals currently be
fore Congress. His proposal includes both
civilian and military options for national
service.
Last Monday, a House subcommittee
voted to reinstate military registration for
18-year-old men beginning in January 1981.
The bill also asks President jimmy Carter to
recommend how registration would be
done and whether women will be in
cluded.

told sufficient manpower could not be
mobilized quickly enough. But the ques
tion is, sufficient . . . for what? Mobilized

"The government continues to use the
Russian threat to convince people to just sit

The goal is simple — for the government to
have first claim on the lives of the American
people and to do whatever the hell it wants

with them."
Cullinan asked the crowd "If there is no
draft, then what do you do if you wish to
fight against some potential aggressor?"
drawing boos, hisses and shouts of "No
draft, no war!"
The ex-C.l approached McCloskey and
stood next to him, shouting about his disil
lusionment with the military service in the
Vietnam War and threatening debate or
ganizers who attempted to remove him
from the auditorium. The man soon left the
auditorium under his own power, saying
that he did not have a question for the
debaters.
At one point, McCloskey apologized for
past overseas uses of U.S. armed forces.
Referring to what he called "the Vietnam
meatgrinder," he said, "I don't think we'll
ever go to war again to defend a particular
form of government in a particular coun
try."
McCloskey unsuccessfully opposed
President Richard Nixon for the Republi
can presidential nomination in 1972 on a
platform advocating immediate withdrawal
from the Vietnam War.
Draft necessity
The Libertarians asked why the United
States does need a draft.

McCloskey said, "None of us want to go
back to the draft if the volunteer system is
working. If it is not working, then the draft
is necessary as a matter of fairness and
equitable distribution of the burden (of na
tional defense)."
McCloskey is concerned that the present
system of voluntary military enlistment at
tracts less qualified personnel and results
in an army that is not what he calls "ready
to go into action on 24 hours notice."
Army a deterrent?
McCloskey said that a strong, combat
ready army is in fact a deterrent to war.
Given a weak U.S. military, McCloskey said
the Soviet Union might be tempted to sim
ply take over some European or Asian na
tion, believing the United States would not
and could not intervene short of using nuc
lear weapons.
McCloskey said this is a dangerous situa
tion for any nation to be in, as without a
credible conventional deterrent, the only
remaining one is the threat of nuclear
holocaust, an option for which the United
States has stated its reluctance.
The debate was the culmination of Peace
Week, sponsored by various anti-draft or
ganizations in an effort to mobilize resis
tance against military registration or con

scription.
Congressional action
McCloskey's national service plan is one
of a dozen similar proposals currently be
fore Congress. His proposal includes both
civilian and military options for national
service.
Last Monday, a House subcommittee
voted to reinstate military registration for
18-year-old men beginning in January 1981.
The bill also asks President jimmy Carter to
recommend how registration would be
done and whether women will be in
cluded.


Congressman Pete McCloskey
and Terry Cullinan
It was libertarianism versus the draft
Saturday afternoon as Congressman Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) again defended
the concept of compulsory national youth
service with military and civilian options in
a heated and emotionally charged debate
interrupted by cheers, jeers and one rather
irrational outburst from an ex-GI.
The debate, sponsored by the Stanford
Libertarians, drew an overflow crowd of
more than 400 to Bishop Auditorium for
two hours of pro and con arguments on the
issue "Resolved: The United States should
return to an involuntary draft and national
service."
Roy Childs, editor of Libertarian Review,
and Milton Mueller, national director of
Students for a Libertarian Society (SLS),
questioned the alleged failure of the volun
teer army, asking McCloskey why he
deemed an army of 2.1 million men insuffi
cient to defend the LJnited States.
McCloskey and his debate partner, Terry
Cullinan, a director of marketing at SRI In
ternational and a trustee for the National
Service Secretariat, concentrated their ar
guments on how to provide the United
States with an army equitably composed
and capable of honoring America's wide-

spread overseas commitments.
Defense burden
Citing what he called an "unfair distribu
tion of the burden of national defense,"
McCloskey indicated the6o percent minor
ity composition of today's army could only
be remedied by turning to a program such
as his.
According to the Libertarians, McClos
key never addressed what the Libertarians
called an indelible link between the draft
and American foreign policy.
Childs said, "We have been told the vol
unteer army is insufficient. We have been
