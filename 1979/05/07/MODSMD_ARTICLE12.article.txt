## Feelings, too, are opinions 
### 
Every other week I scout around for column
material. This week, as I began that ritual, how
ever, I was told firmly not to write about "feel
ings," but about "Issues." Someone suggested I
write about the Lomita Drive extension. Some
one else suggested I argue for the renovation of
the Inner Quad. I thought of exploring affirma
tive action at Stanford or writing about my
thoughts on nuclear power or the draft.
But suddenly, I thought, why the tremendous
emphasis on "Issues?" True, all the above
suggestions are valid issues — points of discus
sion or debate — but so are subjects like human
alienation, loneliness, the quality of student life
here at Stanford. Feelings are issues, too.
Classical editorials usually deal with national
or local political issues. They are important and
of interest to many readers. The classical role of
a newspaper is to relate current events and ideas
to the public.
I believe that people want very much to com
municate with each other. We enjoy learning
about what other people think and feel. That is
why I disagree with editorial policies which
deemphasize the expressions and exchange of
emotions on the opinions page.
There is a place for all kinds of opinions writ
ing. Thoughtful analyses of political/economic
questions, satiric social comment, inquiries into
broader, more philosophical questions; all
these are valid subjects with a broad base of
interest. More personal topics dealing directly
with human sentiments, however, are also
highly relevant to readers and often strike feel
ings that lie deeper than those elicited by more
"political" questions.
Universal emotions
I know that some of my most profound re
sponses to newspaper articles have been to
stories dealing with universal human feelings.
When I read an article expressing alienation or
longing, for instance, I feel that someone out
there understands. This sense of connection is
very important, and I believe one of the func
tions of a newspaper should be to provide a
meeting ground that fosters such a feeling.
There is a problem, though, in trying to write an

editorial about feelings. Editorial style can vary
greatly, but it is nearly always a polemical, care
ful, point-by-point exposition which illuminates
a specific position. This form is ideal for political
analysis, but not for the expression of feelings.
Emotions aren't always so well-defined; they
are often ambiguous and laden with internal
contradictions. To try to tame feelings into
editorial style is to end up not with an expres
sion of feelings, but an analysis of them. I em
phasize that such an approach is valid in and of
itself, but that there is also a place on the opin
ions page fora less rigid expression of emotion.
New style needed
In order to do this, however, one must forge a
new writing style. Such a style would have to
embrace — rather than exclude — the often
impetuous, nebulous or irrational nature of feel
ings. Such a piece is unconventional on the
opinions page. People who have tried it have
been criticized for being too "artsy-fartsy."
They're told that their writing is not journalism
but creative writing, and thus is sorely out of
place on the opinions page.
There is a place on the editorial page for such
writing. The truth is, however, that it can be
more difficult to read than an intellectual politi
cal analysis because of the ambiguities inherent
in emotion. But that shouldn't disqualify it as
valid.
I think we must, then, broaden our concep
tions of the role and function of a newspaper; we
need to expand our views of what belongs on
the editorial page. Feelings and thoughts which
affect us belong there. We are human. We feel
things.
A newspaper must encourage the myriad
styles that are bound to emerge so that it may
deal with the great variety of things to be expres
sed. Especially here at Stanford where people
consistently cry out for a gathering spot, for a
"human connection," the newspaper must re
spond to that call and allow its readers to speak
to each other on its pages.
