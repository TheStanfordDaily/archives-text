## Slepian et al. Don't trap gays in the closet 
### 
Today, and throughout Gay
Awareness Week, the women
and men of the Gay People's
Union shall attempt collec
tively to perform what might
appear to be an act of magic —
to allow people to clearly see
that which is usually invisible.
The existence of a gay com
munity here, along with the
cultural, religious and political
ideas that are significant in
many of our lives is most often
comfortably ignored by the
rest of the University commun
ity. This week, we shall attempt
to put ourselves, and the issues
that surround our lives, on
center stage.
Yet we shall perform no real
magic. Neither the powers of a
Merlin nor a Houdini are at our
disposal. Our ability to focus
the attention of the campus on
gay issues for a few days is in
deed noteworthy. But what is
truly remarkable is the exis
tence of a set of social and polit
ical attitudes that, for the other
51 weeks of the year, keep
most of the lesbians and gay
men on campus hidden from
each other, from their friends
and from the community at
large.
Should be easy
One might expect that in the
current environment, gay stu
dents here would have little
difficulty in 'coming out' to
those around them and having
their sexual preference fully
accepted by their peers.
After all, we have been given
respectability on the cover of
Time magazine, the Briggs in
itiative was defeated, and a
survey of this year's entering
class here suggests that, at
least in the privacy of an
anonymous questionnaire,
about 85 percent of them op
pose both legal prohibitions
against homosexual relation
ships and discrimination based
on sexual orientation. And
Masters and Johnson, in their
widely publicized study, reit
erate the '10 percent' statistic,
suggesting that there are about
1200 gay students at the Uni
versity.
The question is, then, if
there are so many of us, and if
we are ostensibly so well
accepted, why are we still not
an integral, visible, everyday
part of college life?
The answers are varied and
complicated. To begin with,
many gay students arrive at the
University having only begun
the process of understanding
that their sexuality is somehow
'different.' More often, what
they understand more clearly
is that their family does not
want them to be gay, their
church does not want them to
be gay, and that expressing any
confusion or concern about

their sexuality is probably not
the best way to make friends in
the dorms, houses and frater
nities.
Ultimately, what makes com
ing out so difficult are the at
titudes which transform it into
an event. Most people at Stan
ford act on the presumption
that everyone around them is
heterosexual. Yet this pre
sumption is both invalid and
oppressive; it transforms a
statement that under other cir
cumstances might be no more
shocking than "I'm left
handed " into a social
bombshell.
Even students who have
come out to some friends are
often under subtle pressure to
avoid making any further re
ferences to their gayness. Sim
ply talking about one's plans,
activities or friends is often
considered being too political,
too pushy or too blatant.
Invisibility barrier
So countless gay students go
through the University as invis
ible members of an invisible
minority. And this invisibility
perpetuates itself, and acts as
the strongest barrier to gay
freedom and acceptance.
Many people, including gay
people, are able to sustain
myths, stereotypes and fears
about homosexuality by as
suming that none of the sig
nificant people in their lives are
gay. Yet if all the lesbians and
gay men in the country were to
proclaim their identities,
everyone would discover that
they have gay friends, relatives
or co-workers.
So today we begin Gay
Awareness Week. What do we
intend to accomplish? First of
all, we hope that the events of
the week will provide useful
forums for both gay and non
gay people to explore some of
the questions that touch our
lives: What does it mean to be
gay and Christian, or to be gay
and black? What does it mean
to be gay and a parent, or to
have a gay son or daughter?
And what does it mean to be
gay here?
We hope that everyone on
campus will take some time to
consider their attitudes toward
homosexuality, to ponder why
it might be that the gay friends,
professors and relatives they
have are afraid to talk to them
about it, to think about the fact
that there are gay people in
every dorm, house and de
partment on this campus. We
hope the gay students on cam
pus will realize that they are
not alone. We hope they will
learn that the process of com
ing to terms with one's sexual
ity need not be carried out in
isolation, that being gay can be
a positive aspect of one's life
i

and that if the time is right fora
particular individual, that it is
possible to be gay and out'
here.
Yet whatever this week may
accomplish, we will have per
formed no magic. For most gay
students there are no simple,
magical solutions — the road
to self-acceptance and being
accepted by others can be a
long and difficult one.
