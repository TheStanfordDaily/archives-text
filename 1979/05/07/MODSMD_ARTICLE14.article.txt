## Middle Eastern coin has two sides 
### 
Patricia Nabti's response to
Ken Farbstein's article on
human rights in Israeli
occupied territory (Daily, May
1) could normally be taken as
merely another partisan salvo
in the ongoing Arab-Israeli
polemic, were it not for the fact
that she has raised the addi
tional issue of the responsibil
ity of members of the Univer
sity community to adhere to
standards of scholarly dis
course.
In criticizing Farbstein
(rightly, in my opinion) for his
uncritical use of sources from
the Israeli government and his
failure to study both sides of
the issue, she has incurred the
obligation to practice what she
preaches.
Moreover, her position as a
specialist in Middle Eastern af
fairs and as the instructor of
one of the few courses at Stan
ford on the Arab World further
obliges her to present a more
thorough consideration of the
moral issues in the Middle East
than her brief article permit
ted.
As slanted
Unfortunately, her reaction
to Farbstein is just as one
sided, rhetorically inflamatory,
and ideologically precon
ceived as the piece she is
criticizing. I do not believe in
the pursuit of totally disin
terested inquiry in politics, but
Nabti's language and selection
of factual data are so skewed to
a single-minded anti-Israeli
position as to mock her call for
study ot both sides. This is the
style of a true believer, not a
scholar.
Nowhere in her article, for
instance, does she mention the
nonexistence of "human

rights" in all of the Arab coun
tries which oppose Israel,
about which she is surely in
formed. Specifically, she ig
nores the oppressive treat
ment of the remnants of the
Jewish communities in states
like Syria and Iraq.
These examples make the Is
raeli treatment of Arabs in the
occupied territories seem rela
tively mild in comparison, if
not up to the high standards of
the American Bill of Rights, as
she charges. The Israeli attack
on an Arab village in the 1948
war has been paralleled time
and again by Palestinian attacks
on Israeli civilians, including
the murder of two children last
month by "freedom fighters"
from the Palestine Liberation
Organization. About this side
of the conflict, she is conve
niently and consistently silent.

Of course, one side's ter
rorist is the other side's patriot,
and keeping a moral scorecard
of the reciprocal atrocities is
difficult if not impossible. Still,
some basic distinctions can be
made. It does not contribute to
scholarly discourse to passion
ately attack one's enemy at the
expense of honest acknow
ledgment of the crimes of
one's own side.
Nabti's article is in this sense
no worse than many conven
tional defenses of Israeli policy
such as Farbstein's, and I do
not want my remarks con
strued as an unqualified en
dorsement of Israeli policy.
Nabti is ready to compare Is
rael to its ally, South Africa, a
careless and rhetorical com
parison. However, she fails to
make an equivalent compari
son of the PLO's, Iraq's or

Libya's human rights to their
joint ally, the Soviet Union.
The same holds for the recently
fallen government of Uganda,
which they all supported to the
last minute despite its widely
reported atrocities.
The moral ambiguity of in
ternational affairs suggests that
one should be wary of attack
ing someone because of the
moral impurity of their allies.
Who then is without sin? The
search for moral purity may
leave us feeling comfortably
righteous, but is it worth the
sacrifice of the very intellectual
standards that Nabti claims to
hold dearly? I think not. In
short, before you sling mud
you should be careful that
none sticks to your own fin
gers.
