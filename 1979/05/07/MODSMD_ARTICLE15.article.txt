## Overcome fear: resist draft 
### 
On May 1 in White Plaza, 100
other individuals and I signed a
pledge never to register for
conscription. It has been sent
to the office of U.S. Attorney
General Griffith Bell. This
document is important for sev
eral reasons.
First, as a political statement.
The individuals who signed it
have expressed a disapproval
of conscription so strong that,
while registration is only a pos
sibility, they are telling their
government flatly that what
ever the consequences they
will refuse to comply with any
legislation reinstituting regist
ration for conscription. Com

ing at as early a stage with re
spect to the general con
sciousness as it has, and with
such determination, I hope it
will be taken as a serious
statement.
A model
But this pledge is also sig
nificant for other reasons.
Hopefully, it will serve as a
model to arouse anti-draft sen
timents around the Country be
fore the draft becomes law. I
think it is important, however,
for people to understand not
only the political reasons be
hind the threat of civil dis
obedience, but also some of
the personal motivations be
hind thesigningof that pledge.
I can assert no relationship
between my own motives and
another's, but I am convinced
that some others must at least
subconsciously share my feel
ings. I am sure these feelings
are symptomatic of a more
serious sociological/
psychological disorder.
I attended the anti-draft rally
with no intention of signing a
pledge of civil disobedience,
and without knowing that I
would be asked to do so. My
feelings had been ambivalent
on the draft. I knew that if ever

To not sign that paper would have been to
admit that my body as well as my mind
belonged to the government.

faced with having to kill or be
killed I would take an alterna
tive route if possible or simply
refuse if necessary.
Resist in peace time?
I was less certain of what I
would do if drafted during
peace time. Would I be jus
tified in resisting the draft on
such principles whfn propos
als such as Rep. Pete McClos
key's (R-Menlo Park) would
allow me to choose a non
military alternative? Why ask
for trouble? Why not postpone
resistance until necessary (i.e.,
when someone has a gun in
your face or a prison sentence
hanging over your head)?
I did and still do disapprove
of conscription on pu rely polit
ical and historical grounds.
Still, I was not and am not famil
iar enough with all relevant
considerations to pledge civil
disobedience simply because I
oppose giving my tacit support
to conscription as an institu
tion. Why, then, did I sign the
pledge? I signed it out of fear.
(Not from fear of not signing it,
but from fear of signing it.)
I signed it precisely because I
was afraid to. When that

pledge was brought before the
crowd at the rally and its nature
was explained, I felt a more un
settling fear build up inside me
than I had ever felt before.
Scenes of running and hiding,
of courtrooms and prison cells,
of having to flee the country
flashed through my mind, and I
suddenly realized that that
exact fear had been con
ditioned into me my entire life.
Not cowed
I knew that if I did not sign
that piece of paper, the reason
would have been that I had
been cowed into submission,
frightened into tacitly support
ing something I would never
have chosen otherwise.
And I had two subsequent
realizations. First, I realized
that I did not like being
frightened into decisions by
my government. All the politi
cal considerations became
irrelevant. Realizing that if I did
not sign that pledge my ability
to make my own decisions
would have been lost to fear
was enough to inspire me to
sign it. To not sign that paper
would have been to admit that,
not only my body, but my mind
belongs to the government
and not to me.

Second, I realized that the
nature of this fear was such that
if I did not act against it then
and there I would never be
able to do so. If I had submitted
to fear at that rally, then I know
that I would eventually have
submitted to some form of the
draft and ultimately would not
have had the ability to resist at
all. I would have lost my ability
to choose.
Such a type of reasoning may
seem far removed from politi
cal reality, but I think it is actu
ally at the core of our daily
lives. It is all too easy to be
massaged into dullness and
apathy by an affluent lifestyle,
and then terrified into submis
sion by the tremendous power
that makes such a lifestyle pos
sible.
We all act out of fear from
the day we are born, and un
less we are willing to admit that
the government controls our
ability to make decisions for
ourselves, we must each, as
individuals, look within and act
according to what we really
are, not what we are told to be.

timents around the Country be
fore the draft becomes law. I
think it is important, however,
for people to understand not
only the political reasons be
hind the threat of civil dis
obedience, but also some of
the personal motivations be
hind thesigningof that pledge.
I can assert no relationship
between my own motives and
another's, but I am convinced
that some others must at least
subconsciously share my feel
ings. I am sure these feelings
are symptomatic of a more
serious sociological/
psychological disorder.
I attended the anti-draft rally
with no intention of signing a
pledge of civil disobedience,
and without knowing that I
would be asked to do so. My
feelings had been ambivalent
on the draft. I knew that if ever

To not sign that paper would have been to
admit that my body as well as my mind
belonged to the government.

faced with having to kill or be
killed I would take an alterna
tive route if possible or simply
refuse if necessary.
Resist in peace time?
I was less certain of what I
would do if drafted during
peace time. Would I be jus
tified in resisting the draft on
such principles whfn propos
als such as Rep. Pete McClos
key's (R-Menlo Park) would
allow me to choose a non
military alternative? Why ask
for trouble? Why not postpone
resistance until necessary (i.e.,
when someone has a gun in
your face or a prison sentence
hanging over your head)?
I did and still do disapprove
of conscription on pu rely polit
ical and historical grounds.
Still, I was not and am not famil
iar enough with all relevant
considerations to pledge civil
disobedience simply because I
oppose giving my tacit support
to conscription as an institu
tion. Why, then, did I sign the
pledge? I signed it out of fear.
(Not from fear of not signing it,
but from fear of signing it.)
I signed it precisely because I
was afraid to. When that

pledge was brought before the
crowd at the rally and its nature
was explained, I felt a more un
settling fear build up inside me
than I had ever felt before.
Scenes of running and hiding,
of courtrooms and prison cells,
of having to flee the country
flashed through my mind, and I
suddenly realized that that
exact fear had been con
ditioned into me my entire life.
Not cowed
I knew that if I did not sign
that piece of paper, the reason
would have been that I had
been cowed into submission,
frightened into tacitly support
ing something I would never
have chosen otherwise.
And I had two subsequent
realizations. First, I realized
that I did not like being
frightened into decisions by
my government. All the politi
cal considerations became
irrelevant. Realizing that if I did
not sign that pledge my ability
to make my own decisions
would have been lost to fear
was enough to inspire me to
sign it. To not sign that paper
would have been to admit that,
not only my body, but my mind
belongs to the government
and not to me.

Second, I realized that the
nature of this fear was such that
if I did not act against it then
and there I would never be
able to do so. If I had submitted
to fear at that rally, then I know
that I would eventually have
submitted to some form of the
draft and ultimately would not
have had the ability to resist at
all. I would have lost my ability
to choose.
Such a type of reasoning may
seem far removed from politi
cal reality, but I think it is actu
ally at the core of our daily
lives. It is all too easy to be
massaged into dullness and
apathy by an affluent lifestyle,
and then terrified into submis
sion by the tremendous power
that makes such a lifestyle pos
sible.
We all act out of fear from
the day we are born, and un
less we are willing to admit that
the government controls our
ability to make decisions for
ourselves, we must each, as
individuals, look within and act
according to what we really
are, not what we are told to be.

On May 1 in White Plaza, 100
other individuals and I signed a
pledge never to register for
conscription. It has been sent
to the office of U.S. Attorney
General Griffith Bell. This
document is important for sev
eral reasons.
First, as a political statement.
The individuals who signed it
have expressed a disapproval
of conscription so strong that,
while registration is only a pos
sibility, they are telling their
government flatly that what
ever the consequences they
will refuse to comply with any
legislation reinstituting regist
ration for conscription. Com

ing at as early a stage with re
spect to the general con
sciousness as it has, and with
such determination, I hope it
will be taken as a serious
statement.
A model
But this pledge is also sig
nificant for other reasons.
