Sado-anarchism
Having just caught a
glimpse of the poster for Alpha
Sig's "Pimps and Prostitutes
Party," I would like to make a
few salient comments thereon.
The theme of the party I en
tirely approve of: one glance at
Madison Avenue and the "job
opportunities" ads reveals that
someone is always peddling
someone else's ass, and that
sooner or later we all have to
stand on that corner marketing

ourselves to earn our daily
bread.
So why not an undisguised
celebration of the third most
prominent fact of life (beyond
death and taxes) —pimping and
prostitution? It gives students
here the opportunity to safely
relate to "low-life" forms they
never really know otherwise.
In other words, an educa
tional experience.
However, the near-naked
woman on the poster with her
hands bound leaves a bad taste
in the mouth. Perhaps because

the image seems a little an
tithetical to the free market svs
tem.
Somewhere, I feel like a diat
ribe on sexism would be ap
propriate, but people seem to
tune those out these days.
Perhaps a new tack is in order.
Either untie the woman's
hands, or make an attempt at
egalitarianism—liberty and
bondage for all. Why not put
an owl's head on the woman (a
la The Story of O), or offer side
diversions of chicken
hawking, child pornography,
or pretty, pouty boys in
leather?
As Thomas Pynchon ob
served in Gravity's Rainbow,
"Why are we taught tp feel re
flexive shame whenever the
subject (of Sand M) comes up?
Why will the Structure allow
every other kind of sexual be
havior but that one?
"Because submission and
dominance are resources it
needs for its very survival. They
cannot be wasted in private
sex. Inany kind of sex. It needs
our submission so that it may
remain in power. It needs our
lusts after dominance so that it
can co-opt us into its own
power game.
"There is no joy in it, only
power. I tell you, if Sand M
could be established univer
sally, at the family level, the
State would wither away."
