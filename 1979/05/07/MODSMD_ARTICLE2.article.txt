# Nuclear weapons research at Livermore protested by 3500

Livermore — In a gathering re
sembling a "Day on the Green"
celebration, more than ?500 people
braved gusty winds and intermittent
showers Saturday to protest nuclear
weapons research at the UC-
Berkeley-affiliated Lawrence Liver
more Laboratories (LLL).
Scores of cars with anti-nuclear
bumper stickers lined the roads
amidst the predominantly rural land
scape here, 40 miles east of San Fran
cisco.
Their occupants converged out
side of the barbed wire and chain link
fence of the LLL facility to listen to
more than three hours of speakers
and musicians advocating the end of
UC's association with the lab and
conversion of the research facility to
more peaceful energy applications.
Notable among the speakers tak
ing the stage during the afternoon
were Andrew Baldwin of Friends of
the Earth (FOE), Professor Charles
Schwartz from the DC-Berkeley
physics department, Pat Broudy,
widow of a nuclear test victim and
ASSU Guest Professor Daniel
Ellsberg, former strategist for the
Department of Defense and the Rand
Corporation. Singer Holly Near also
performed for the audience.
Many of the Stanford students at
tending the rally formed a carpool
caravan which left Tresidder earlier
in the morning. Several students
constructed a black coffin with radia
tion symbols and the name Stuart
Gunn painted on it, carrying the cof
fin from a VW van to the stage.
Skin cancer link?
Gunn, a chemist at LLI, died March
29 of melanoma, a type of skin cancer
responsible for affecting 10 other
workers and killing three others in
the past decade. Two children in the
Livermore Valley, one of whom has
died, were diagnosed as also having
the cancer and a state Department of
Health Services study is planned for
the lab's workers. In the general
population, 10 people per 100,000
contracts the disease annually.
The UC Nuclear Weapons labs
Conversion Project (UCNWICP),

sponsor of the demonstration and of
a peace conversion fair held yester
day on the Berkeley campus, has a
three-point goal:
— Halting weapons-related ac
tivities of the LLL and Los Alamos Sci
entific Laboratory in New Mexico
and subsequent conversion to "so
cially constructive use";
— Cutting UC ties with the labs,
including ending the contract with
the Department of Energy (DOE) for
lab administration; and
— Studying the "health and safety
hazards" posed by storage of
radioactive material.
Weapons birthplace
Livermore and Los Alamos are the
birthplace of all U.S. nuclear
warheads from Hiroshima to the

neutron bombs.
According to the UCNWLCP, the
labs could economically switch from
weapons research to pursuing alter
native energy sources. The group has
criticized the DOE for its pro
weapons stance and for not placing
enough emphasis on other projects.
The Office of Science and Technol
ogy and the General Accounting Of
fice have similarly questioned the re
search programs, according to an ar
ticle in the Independent, a news
paper serving the Livermore area.
The safety of the labs has sparked a
similar disagreement. Officials at LLL
say that the plutonium stored at the
lab poses no threat while the actual
amount is classified information.
