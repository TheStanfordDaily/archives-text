# No. 1 UCLA drops series
## Stanford beats red-hot Bruins 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford Cardinals took
two out of three games from
UCLA at Sunken Diamond this
weekend, making themselves
the first team this season to win
a series against the number
one nationally-ranked Bruins.
Although UCLA clinched the
first place title in the Southern
Division of the Pac-10 with
their 4-3 victory in the final
game of the series, the Cardi
nals kept a second-place finish
and playoff hopes in sight by
winning the first two games 5-4
and 10-4.
Stanford is now two games
out of second place in the
Southern Division behind Cal,
USC and Arizona, all tied with
14-13 records. The Cards are
12-15.
The deciding series will be
this coming weekend against
the Cal Bears. Stanford must
win all three games this coming
weekend in order to finish
second in the division.
Friday's game was the big
thriller of the series — an extra
inning affair that concluded
one run in favor of Stanford. It
was a pitchers' duel between
the Cards' winningest pitcher,
BruceFialaand UCLA'saceTim
Leary.
Leary, the lanky righthanded
junior on the Bruin staff, was
handed his second loss of the
year against 10 wins. Fiala
claimed his ninth win of the
season.
A personal battle within the
team battle was the highlight of
Friday's game. Fiala faced ex-

high school teammate Jim Au
ten, UCLA rightfielder and a
powerhouse at the plate.
Auten was one home run away
from setting a new NCAA mark
for a single season coming into
the series with 25.
Auten has been averaging
one home run every seven
trips to the plate this year, and
his third trip to bat against Fiala
was another — number 26.
Auten's two-run shot in the
fifth inning tied the score 3-3,
and UCLA went ahead 4-3 in
the top of the sixth when three
consecutive singles produced
a run.
Fleads-up baserunning on
the part of Larry Reynolds knot
ted the score at 4-4 in the
eighth inning and brought
Stanford to life. With Reynolds
on second and Phil Wilson on
first, coach Mark Marquess cal
led a double steal. The runners
were going when Mike
Codiroli hit a chopper to the
second baseman.
Bruin second baseman Mike
Gallego took his time with the
throw to first and Reynolds
sped home virtually unnoticed
by the opposition.
Neither team scored in the
ninth and the game crept into
extra innings. After giving up a
lead-off single to the cleanup
batter Auten, Fiala retired the
side one-two-three in the
tenth.
To start Stanford's half of the
tenth, Mike Toothman got on
base on an error by UCLA sec
ond baseman Vern Followed.

Leary retired the number nine
batter for the Cards, but then
Reynolds came to the plate and
ripped a double into the right
field power alley. Toothman
easily scored from first and the
game belonged to Stanford.
Fiala gave up 11 hits enroute
to the victory but walked only
one while striking out seven.
Leary yielded eight hits.
In the first game of Sunday's
doubleheader — delayed one
day because of rainy weather
— the Cardinals dominated the
contest from start to finish. Joe
LoPresti pitched the full nine
innings for the Cards and deli
vered the first loss of the year
to Bruin Dave Scmidt, who was
10-0 coming into the series.
Stanford shortstop Dave
Meier sparked the Cardinal of
fensive attack Sunday going
three-for-three and collecting
five RBI in the first game and
managing two hits in three at
bats in the final game of the
weekend.
In that second and final
game Sunday, the number of
men Stanford left on base was
the key to the loss. In the first
two innings of play, six Cardi
nals were stranded. Bythetime
the game was through, Stan
ford had left 12 on base.
UCLA jumped to a 4-0 lead in
the first three innings of that
last game, tagging Stanford
starting pitcher Brian Harrison
forsix hits. Larry Kuhn came on
in relief in the third and
pitched in fine form for the re
mainder of the game, allowing

only one hit, three walks and
striking out three.
Stanford scored single runs
in the fourth and sixth innings
of the final game to improve
the score to 4-2. But the next
two innings slipped by without
a change, and the Cards found
themselves in the bottom of
the ninth with one last chance.
Cardinal catcher Bruce Wal
ters did his best to spark a rally,
walloping his sixth homerun of
the season off Bruin reliever
Scott Bollens. But the Cards
were not to sweep the Bruins.
Bollens retired the next batter
to claim the contest for UCLA.
Stanford has two non
conference tune-ups before
the crucial series against
California next weekend. The
Cards travel to St. Mary's Tues
day for a 2:30 p rn. contest,
while on Wednesday, they re
turn home to host Santa Clara
University at 2:30 p.m. on Sun
ken Diamond.

Stanford shortstop Dave Meier sparked the Cards' series win over top-ranked UCLA this weekend, going
five for six with five RBI in Sunday's doubleheader. Pitcher |oe LoPresti hurled a complete game in the
opener, a 10-4 Stanford win.
The Stanford Cardinals took
two out of three games from
UCLA at Sunken Diamond this
weekend, making themselves
the first team this season to win
a series against the number
one nationally-ranked Bruins.
Although UCLA clinched the
first place title in the Southern
Division of the Pac-10 with
their 4-3 victory in the final
game of the series, the Cardi
nals kept a second-place finish
and playoff hopes in sight by
winning the first two games 5-4
and 10-4.
Stanford is now two games
out of second place in the
Southern Division behind Cal,
USC and Arizona, all tied with
14-13 records. The Cards are
12-15.
The deciding series will be
this coming weekend against
the Cal Bears. Stanford must
win all three games this coming
weekend in order to finish
second in the division.
Friday's game was the big
thriller of the series — an extra
inning affair that concluded
one run in favor of Stanford. It
was a pitchers' duel between
the Cards' winningest pitcher,
BruceFialaand UCLA'saceTim
Leary.
Leary, the lanky righthanded
junior on the Bruin staff, was
handed his second loss of the
year against 10 wins. Fiala
claimed his ninth win of the
season.
A personal battle within the
team battle was the highlight of
Friday's game. Fiala faced ex-

high school teammate Jim Au
ten, UCLA rightfielder and a
powerhouse at the plate.
Auten was one home run away
from setting a new NCAA mark
for a single season coming into
the series with 25.
Auten has been averaging
one home run every seven
trips to the plate this year, and
his third trip to bat against Fiala
was another — number 26.
Auten's two-run shot in the
fifth inning tied the score 3-3,
and UCLA went ahead 4-3 in
the top of the sixth when three
consecutive singles produced
a run.
Fleads-up baserunning on
the part of Larry Reynolds knot
ted the score at 4-4 in the
eighth inning and brought
Stanford to life. With Reynolds
on second and Phil Wilson on
first, coach Mark Marquess cal
led a double steal. The runners
were going when Mike
Codiroli hit a chopper to the
second baseman.
Bruin second baseman Mike
Gallego took his time with the
throw to first and Reynolds
sped home virtually unnoticed
by the opposition.
Neither team scored in the
ninth and the game crept into
extra innings. After giving up a
lead-off single to the cleanup
batter Auten, Fiala retired the
side one-two-three in the
tenth.
To start Stanford's half of the
tenth, Mike Toothman got on
base on an error by UCLA sec
ond baseman Vern Followed.

Leary retired the number nine
batter for the Cards, but then
Reynolds came to the plate and
ripped a double into the right
field power alley. Toothman
easily scored from first and the
game belonged to Stanford.
Fiala gave up 11 hits enroute
to the victory but walked only
one while striking out seven.
Leary yielded eight hits.
In the first game of Sunday's
doubleheader — delayed one
day because of rainy weather
— the Cardinals dominated the
contest from start to finish. Joe
LoPresti pitched the full nine
innings for the Cards and deli
vered the first loss of the year
to Bruin Dave Scmidt, who was
10-0 coming into the series.
Stanford shortstop Dave
Meier sparked the Cardinal of
fensive attack Sunday going
three-for-three and collecting
five RBI in the first game and
managing two hits in three at
bats in the final game of the
weekend.
In that second and final
game Sunday, the number of
men Stanford left on base was
the key to the loss. In the first
two innings of play, six Cardi
nals were stranded. Bythetime
the game was through, Stan
ford had left 12 on base.
UCLA jumped to a 4-0 lead in
the first three innings of that
last game, tagging Stanford
starting pitcher Brian Harrison
forsix hits. Larry Kuhn came on
in relief in the third and
pitched in fine form for the re
mainder of the game, allowing

only one hit, three walks and
striking out three.
Stanford scored single runs
in the fourth and sixth innings
of the final game to improve
the score to 4-2. But the next
two innings slipped by without
a change, and the Cards found
themselves in the bottom of
the ninth with one last chance.
Cardinal catcher Bruce Wal
ters did his best to spark a rally,
walloping his sixth homerun of
the season off Bruin reliever
Scott Bollens. But the Cards
were not to sweep the Bruins.
Bollens retired the next batter
to claim the contest for UCLA.
Stanford has two non
conference tune-ups before
the crucial series against
California next weekend. The
Cards travel to St. Mary's Tues
day for a 2:30 p rn. contest,
while on Wednesday, they re
turn home to host Santa Clara
