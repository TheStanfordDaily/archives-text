# Sun and fun in Arizona: Card netters lose only one match
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
"It was a workman-like per
formance. We didn't play spec
tacular, but we played well,"
commented Stanford tennis
coach Dick Gould. Gould's
Cards had a relatively easy time
in Arizona this weekend, de
feating Arizona 8-1 and Arizona
State 9-0.
The two wins, coupled with
top ranked UCLA's 9-0 win over
crosstown rival USC, mean that
for the tenth straight year,
either UCLA or Stanford will
win the Pacific-10 title. The
Bruins have won six of the last
nine conference titles, while
the Cards have won the other
three. The two will square off

on the Farm Saturday.
On Friday in Tucson the
Cards ran through Arizona in
fine style. Andy Gordon, who
beat out Woody Supple for the
top spot in Arizona's lineup,
just didn't have the guns to stay
with Stanford's Peter Rennert.
Although Gordon defeated
Stanford's Lloyd Bourne in
three sets in a hotly contested
match in the two teams first
meeting, he went down quietly
against Rennert, 6-4, 6-2. Lloyd
Bourne added to Supple's mis
ery by downing him 6-2, 7-5.
Tim Mayotte had the tough
est match of the day when he
faced U of A's Teddy Staren.
Staren was coming off a strong

showing at the Pac-10 tourna
ment in Ojai last weekend
where he reached the quarter
finals.
The two battled evenly for
two sets, splitting a pair of 7-5
sets before Mayotte was able to
take control and win the final
set 6-2. The only bright spot for
the Wildcats came when Tim
Ma rein scored his second win
over )eff Arons 6-3, 6-4.
Saturday's match was even
less of a challenge, despite the
100-degree heat. With ASU's
top two players watching from
the stands, the Sun Devils
could muster only two sets for
all their efforts.
Alan Waldman, who ex

tended Rennert to three sets in
their first match at Stanford,
was out with a bad foot, while
an injured elbow kept Tonnie
Sie out of action.
Because of the injuries,
hard-serving Eric Sherbeck was
elevated to number one, a spot
he held down last year. Re
nnert took some of the joy out
of Sherbeck's reunion with the
number one spot by handing
him a 6-2, 7-5 loss.
Scott Bondurant was the
only one forced to labor in the
heat for three sets. Archie
Bauer took the first set from
"Bond Man" 6-3, before the
Cardinal freshman bounced
back to win the final sets by
identical 6-2 scores.
Backcourt ace Jim Hodges
continued to roll, running his
win streak to three by defeat
ing jeff Murphy 6-2, 7-5.
"Overall, I was very pleased
with our performance this
weekend," Could said. "You
never know what a young team
will do on a road trip. I am re

ally glad we made it through
the weekend with two wins
and no injuries."
Could also noted that he
sees his team starting to be
come a closer unit, an impor
tant intangible for any team.
"The players are gaining a
great deal of respect for each
other. They're all starting to
have a great deal of confidence
in each other's ability," Gould
said.
The Cards must now prepare
for another big week of tennis.
Ranked number seven in the
last rankings, Stanford must
face number six Pepperdine
Tuesday, number five USC
Thursday and number one
UCLA Saturday.
"If we beat both Pepperdine
and USC we should be seeded
no worse than fifth for the
NCAA championships," said
Could. "This is important be
cause the draw is pre
determined, depending on
your seeding (number one
plays number eight, number

two plays number seven,
number three plays number
six, and so on). It can be a defi
nite advantage to be seeded as
high as possible."
Pepperdine is led by Ail-
American Eddie Edwards, who
last year handed )ohn McEnroe
one of his two losses. Leo Pa
lin, the Waves' number two
man, won the Ojai open tour
nament last year and was the
number two seed this year be
fore Jim Hodges knocked him
off.
"The Pepperdine match is
gigantic," said Lloyd Bourne.
"I'm really excited about play
ing in Maples this weekend
against USC and UCLA but we
can't afford to look past Pep
perdine. We really need to
beat them to improve our
chances of winning the
NCAA's."
So the Cards, who lost two
out of three in their big week
against the Texas schools ear
lier this season, must reverse
that this week against the ten

nis powers from Southern
California.
The Cards host Pepperdine
Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. at Stan
ford Stadium. Thursday and
Saturday's matches against
USC and UCLA will begin at 1
p.m. outdoors and 6:30 p.m.
for the feature matches in
doors at Maples Pavilion.

and no injuries."
Could also noted that he
sees his team starting to be
come a closer unit, an impor
tant intangible for any team.
"The players are gaining a
great deal of respect for each
other. They're all starting to
have a great deal of confidence
in each other's ability," Gould
said.
The Cards must now prepare
for another big week of tennis.
Ranked number seven in the
last rankings, Stanford must
face number six Pepperdine
Tuesday, number five USC
Thursday and number one
UCLA Saturday.
"If we beat both Pepperdine
and USC we should be seeded
no worse than fifth for the
NCAA championships," said
Could. "This is important be
cause the draw is pre
determined, depending on
your seeding (number one
plays number eight, number

two plays number seven,
number three plays number
six, and so on). It can be a defi
nite advantage to be seeded as
high as possible."
Pepperdine is led by Ail-
American Eddie Edwards, who
last year handed )ohn McEnroe
one of his two losses. Leo Pa
lin, the Waves' number two
man, won the Ojai open tour
nament last year and was the
number two seed this year be
fore Jim Hodges knocked him
off.
"The Pepperdine match is
gigantic," said Lloyd Bourne.
"I'm really excited about play
ing in Maples this weekend
against USC and UCLA but we
can't afford to look past Pep
perdine. We really need to
beat them to improve our
chances of winning the
NCAA's."
So the Cards, who lost two
out of three in their big week
against the Texas schools ear
lier this season, must reverse
that this week against the ten

nis powers from Southern
California.
The Cards host Pepperdine
Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. at Stan
ford Stadium. Thursday and
Saturday's matches against
USC and UCLA will begin at 1
p.m. outdoors and 6:30 p.m.
for the feature matches in
doors at Maples Pavilion.

"It was a workman-like per
formance. We didn't play spec
tacular, but we played well,"
commented Stanford tennis
coach Dick Gould. Gould's
Cards had a relatively easy time
in Arizona this weekend, de
feating Arizona 8-1 and Arizona
State 9-0.
The two wins, coupled with
top ranked UCLA's 9-0 win over
crosstown rival USC, mean that
for the tenth straight year,
either UCLA or Stanford will
win the Pacific-10 title. The
Bruins have won six of the last
nine conference titles, while
the Cards have won the other
three. The two will square off

on the Farm Saturday.
On Friday in Tucson the
Cards ran through Arizona in
fine style. Andy Gordon, who
beat out Woody Supple for the
top spot in Arizona's lineup,
just didn't have the guns to stay
with Stanford's Peter Rennert.
Although Gordon defeated
Stanford's Lloyd Bourne in
three sets in a hotly contested
match in the two teams first
meeting, he went down quietly
against Rennert, 6-4, 6-2. Lloyd
Bourne added to Supple's mis
ery by downing him 6-2, 7-5.
Tim Mayotte had the tough
est match of the day when he
faced U of A's Teddy Staren.
Staren was coming off a strong

showing at the Pac-10 tourna
ment in Ojai last weekend
where he reached the quarter
finals.
The two battled evenly for
two sets, splitting a pair of 7-5
sets before Mayotte was able to
take control and win the final
set 6-2. The only bright spot for
the Wildcats came when Tim
Ma rein scored his second win
over )eff Arons 6-3, 6-4.
Saturday's match was even
less of a challenge, despite the
100-degree heat. With ASU's
top two players watching from
the stands, the Sun Devils
could muster only two sets for
all their efforts.
Alan Waldman, who ex

tended Rennert to three sets in
their first match at Stanford,
was out with a bad foot, while
an injured elbow kept Tonnie
Sie out of action.
Because of the injuries,
hard-serving Eric Sherbeck was
elevated to number one, a spot
he held down last year. Re
nnert took some of the joy out
of Sherbeck's reunion with the
number one spot by handing
him a 6-2, 7-5 loss.
Scott Bondurant was the
only one forced to labor in the
heat for three sets. Archie
Bauer took the first set from
"Bond Man" 6-3, before the
Cardinal freshman bounced
back to win the final sets by
identical 6-2 scores.
Backcourt ace Jim Hodges
continued to roll, running his
win streak to three by defeat
ing jeff Murphy 6-2, 7-5.
"Overall, I was very pleased
with our performance this
weekend," Could said. "You
never know what a young team
will do on a road trip. I am re

ally glad we made it through
the weekend with two wins
and no injuries."
Could also noted that he
sees his team starting to be
