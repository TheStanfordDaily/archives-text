### Hank Duderstadt 
Thomas Enders, U.S. ambassador
to Canada, commented on the dif
ficulties of managing U.S.-Canadian
relations, but also lauded a number
of major achievements between the
two countries over the past two
years, in a speech at Kresge Au
ditorium last Thursday evening.
He praised "the agreement to
build the Alaska pipeline together,
the biggest tariff reduction and trade
regulating deal we've ever reached,
agreement on East Coast fisheries
and boundary arbitration, an innova
tive accord on the Great Lakes
clean-up and revision of (the) St.
Lawrence (Seaway) toll structure."
"We have been doing something
right," Enders said in regard to the
success of relations during the past
several years. Enders' remarks came
during the second of a three day con
ference here on U.S.-Canadian rela
tions.
Enders also said that negotiations
for providing a new source of natural
gas for the United States from Alaska
have reached the "crunch point."
"The real key to putting together
the sale of Alaskan gas is now being
negotiated by the U.S. Energy Reg
ulatory Commission to determine
how that gas will be priced between
the producers and the consumers,"
Enders said. He expressed optimism
that natural gas will flow from the $15
billion, privately owned Northeast
Alaska pipeline by 1984.
Strong ties
He described how both countries
have developed strong ties in en
vironmental concerns, defense and
business.
"In a word, we depend on each
other," Enders said, but went on to
emphasize that we must use care in
our relations and not violate several
important diplomatic rules.
In managing these relations, he
said that some basic objectives, such
as the present clean-up project in the
Great Lakes, must first be shared in
order to initiate close relations.
He said he felt that individual
states and provinces should be con
sulted in any agreement that would
affect them.
Though relations have seldom
been better, Enders said that in the

past there have been definite ten
sions between the two countries.
U.S.-Canadian tensions
The Vietnam War posed the first
major difference between the two
nations and for the first time a vast
majority of Canadians disagreed with
what the United States was doing.
This led Canada to a downgrading
of defense, a screen on incoming in
vestment, cutting of the oil flow and
media relations, and diversification

of Canadian foreign relations.
The United States responded to
these moves by increasing import
regulations and falsely declaring
lapan as our best diplomatic ally.
This turbulence persisted into the
1970s when new efforts to improve
relations brought changes.
President Jimmy Carter has helped
greatly with treaties on a new oil line,
fishing rights and joint environmen
tal efforts, Enders said.
