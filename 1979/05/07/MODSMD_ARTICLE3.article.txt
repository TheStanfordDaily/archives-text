# Many violate copyright law despite efforts by libraries

### Robin Millington 
Though Stanford librarians strictly adhere to
the new' Federal Copyright Law enacted in
lanuary 1978, there is no way for librarians to
insure that students, professors or adminis
trators using the library photocopy machines
are not violating these laws, according to
Myron lacobstein, law librarian here.
Stanford libraries will not do any copying
unless it is legal, a policy which "sometimes
frustrates a professor or student who needs
something copied," lacobstein said.
"The new copyright law is more protective
of the author in terms of receiving his royalties
but didn't very well take into account academic
or library uses," said Tesse Santors, a
Flumanities librarian at Meyer Library. "One
page tells you one thing, the next page tells
you another — no one really knows how it's
going to be used."
The new law deals with regulation of such
copying processes as photocopying, televi
sion, radio and sound recording which were
not covered in the 1909 copyright statutes. Lib
raries now are not allowed to make any type of
reproduction for the reserve shelf, or make
more than one copy for a professor without
first gaining the author's permission.
Author's permission needed
Permission can be gained in three ways, ac
cording to lacobstein. The first way is to write
directly to the author for permission to copy

his material.
Second, for magazine articles, Stanford has
written away in advance to many journal own
ers to get blanket permission to reproduce
copies for reserve. This does not apply to clas
sroom use, lacobstein explained.
Third, he explained, many journals have set
fees which are printed in various journals for
copying articles. A copy can be legally made
from this if the fee is paid to the Copyrights
Clearing House Center in New York City,
which distributes the fees to the various jour
nals.
There is a clause in the law known as the
Doctrine of Fair Use which covers most of the
photocopying done at Stanford.
Guidelines
The guidelines allow for one copy of mate
rial to be made but restrict the amount that
may be copied. No more than 250 words from
poems, no stories longer than 2500 words and
no excerpts of more than 10 percent or 1000
words of any other prose may be copied with
out specific permission from the author.
There is also a spontaneity clause which al
lows a professor to make copies fora class if he
thinks of it just before class and has no chance
to apply for permission to copy, lacobstein
said. In this circumstance, the copies may only
be used once for the specific class they were
made for.

Penalties for violation of the law can result in
payment to the author of the actual damages in
royalty loss plus profits gained from use of the
copied material or payment of statuatory dam
ages from $250 to $10,000, according to Steve
Watkins, a library specialist in government
documents.
Santors explained that just recently Harvard
University became the first academic institu
tion to be sued under the new law.
"We've all sort of been waiting for someone
to be sued to see how the law is going to be
enforced," Santors said.
Beyond library's control
She said that there is no control over people
using the photocopy machines beyond putting
signs on all the photocopy machines stating
briefly what the law requires.
"The laws haven't been violated by the lib
rary staff — we've been overly cautious," San
tors explained.
lacobstein explained that the only means of
enforcement is that "every librarian knows the
law and each librarian is responsible to follow
the law."
lacobstein said he teels that the laws really
have not changed what can be copied and
what can not.
"The most effect the law has had is to make
professors prepare their reading material far
enough in advance for the library to copy it
legally," lacobstein explained.

trators using the library photocopy machines
are not violating these laws, according to
Myron lacobstein, law librarian here.
Stanford libraries will not do any copying
unless it is legal, a policy which "sometimes
frustrates a professor or student who needs
something copied," lacobstein said.
"The new copyright law is more protective
of the author in terms of receiving his royalties
but didn't very well take into account academic
or library uses," said Tesse Santors, a
Flumanities librarian at Meyer Library. "One
page tells you one thing, the next page tells
you another — no one really knows how it's
going to be used."
The new law deals with regulation of such
copying processes as photocopying, televi
sion, radio and sound recording which were
not covered in the 1909 copyright statutes. Lib
raries now are not allowed to make any type of
reproduction for the reserve shelf, or make
more than one copy for a professor without
first gaining the author's permission.
Author's permission needed
Permission can be gained in three ways, ac
cording to lacobstein. The first way is to write
directly to the author for permission to copy

his material.
Second, for magazine articles, Stanford has
written away in advance to many journal own
ers to get blanket permission to reproduce
copies for reserve. This does not apply to clas
sroom use, lacobstein explained.
Third, he explained, many journals have set
fees which are printed in various journals for
copying articles. A copy can be legally made
from this if the fee is paid to the Copyrights
Clearing House Center in New York City,
which distributes the fees to the various jour
nals.
There is a clause in the law known as the
Doctrine of Fair Use which covers most of the
photocopying done at Stanford.
Guidelines
The guidelines allow for one copy of mate
rial to be made but restrict the amount that
may be copied. No more than 250 words from
poems, no stories longer than 2500 words and
no excerpts of more than 10 percent or 1000
words of any other prose may be copied with
out specific permission from the author.
There is also a spontaneity clause which al
lows a professor to make copies fora class if he
thinks of it just before class and has no chance
to apply for permission to copy, lacobstein
said. In this circumstance, the copies may only
be used once for the specific class they were
made for.

Penalties for violation of the law can result in
payment to the author of the actual damages in
royalty loss plus profits gained from use of the
copied material or payment of statuatory dam
ages from $250 to $10,000, according to Steve
Watkins, a library specialist in government
documents.
Santors explained that just recently Harvard
University became the first academic institu
tion to be sued under the new law.
"We've all sort of been waiting for someone
to be sued to see how the law is going to be
enforced," Santors said.
Beyond library's control
She said that there is no control over people
using the photocopy machines beyond putting
signs on all the photocopy machines stating
briefly what the law requires.
"The laws haven't been violated by the lib
rary staff — we've been overly cautious," San
tors explained.
lacobstein explained that the only means of
enforcement is that "every librarian knows the
law and each librarian is responsible to follow
the law."
lacobstein said he teels that the laws really
have not changed what can be copied and
what can not.
"The most effect the law has had is to make
professors prepare their reading material far
enough in advance for the library to copy it
legally," lacobstein explained.
