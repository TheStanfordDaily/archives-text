Israelis bomb Palestinian camp
Beirut — Israeli warplanes bombed and rocketed a
Palestinian camp 100 miles north of the Israeli-Lebanese
frontier yesterday, and guerrilla spokesmen said four
civilians were killed and 25 others were wounded.
The spokesmen said four jets struck a refugee camp at
Nahr El-Bared, near the Mediterranean port of Tripoli,
and Lebanese state radio said they also bombed the
neighboring Lebanese village of Al-Mohmara.
But an Israeli military spokesman in Tel Aviv said the
targets were bases used for training guerrillas for raids
inside Israel. All aircraft returned safely, an Israeli com
munique said.
The jets "hit a house where more than 100 persons
gathered for a wedding party," said a taxi driver return
ing from the area. He said about 30 suffered "serious
wounds, and three or four of them died minutes later."
The report could not be confirmed.
The camp is considered a stronghold of Dr. George
Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
which leads the hardline "Rejection Front" within Yasser
Arafat's PLO. The Front is opposed to a negotiated peace
with Israel.
Bassam Abu Sharif, a PFLP spokesman, claimed the
jets struck only at civilian areas in the east of the camp,
which houses more than 20,000 Palestinians and low
income Lebanese.
Thousands join in nuclear protest
Washington — Chanting "No more Harrisburgs," tens
of thousands of Americans marched in the sunshine
yesterday and cheered demands that Energy Secretary
James Schlesinger be fired for relying too much on nuc
lear energy.
Police estimated from a helicopter that 70,000 persons
had assembled at the base of Capitol Hill for the anti
nuclear rally. But Ralph Nader, one of the protestors, put
the crowd's size at 125,000 and said he was sure its roar
could be heard by President Jimmy Carter in the White
House, a mile away.
"Hell, no, we won't glow," read a banner held aloft as
the protestors marched from behind the White House
along Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol in a demonst
ration reminiscent of the protests against the Vietnam
War.
California Gov. Jerry Brown, addressing the crowd,
called for "a new politics — a politics of the future — a
politics that represents the unborn, the undreamed of,
the unimagined generation that will pay the price of the
folly of this decade."
Brown, a potential rival of Carter's for the 1980 Demo
cratic presidential nomination, told reporters nuclear
power would be an issue in that campaign.
Poll shows dip in Carter popularity
New York — With no cure for inflation in sight, Ameri
cans now give President Jimmy Carter's work in the
White House a rating as low as the lowest levels of his
administration, an Associated Press-NBC News poll
shows.
The public opinion benefits of Carter's pivotal role in

obtaining an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty have
weakened, leaving deep concerns about the nation's
economic and energy problems as dominant forces in
Americans' view of the president.
In the AP-NBC News poll taken April 30 and May 1, 26
percent of the public gave Carter's work overall "good"
or "excellent" marks. That was down three points from
the rating found in the March poll.
Fifty-two percent rated his work "only fair." Twenty
percent gave his work a poor rating.
Two percent of the 1600 adults interviewed nation
wide by telephone were not sure.
These figures are equal to the lowest found in the
AP-NBC News polls since Carter took office. In August
1978, the public's judgment was all but identical to the
current marks.
Thatcher appointment denounced
London — Labor Party leaders yesterday denounced
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's choice of a member
of the House of Lords as British foreign secretary, calling
it "undemocratic" and saying his policies will threaten
East-West detente.
The new Conservative government chief, meanwhile,
got her first taste as prime minister of the continuing
crisis in Northern Ireland.
In announcing her 22-member Cabinet on Saturday,
Thatcher named Lord Carrington, Conservative leader
in the House of Lords, as foreign secretary.
This appointment stirred the strongest protest from
the opposition Labor Party, whose legislators have now
challenged Carrington to renounce his peerage and
stand for future election to the House of Commons.
Israel, Egypt continue verbal battles
Tel Aviv — The Israeli Cabinet, answering a new chal
lenge from Egypt, declared yesterday that Israel would
never give up control of East Jerusalem.
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry on Friday said an Islamic
conference opening in Morocco this week should focus
on returning the Israeli-occupied, Arab-populated sec
tor of Jerusalem to Arab control.
The Israeli Cabinet, in a meeting yesterday, re
sponded with a statement saying, "Jerusalem is the et
ernal, united, indivisible capital of the state of Israel.
Unlike the period of the Jordanian occupation, there
exists in Jerusalem total freedom of access for Jews,
Christians and Moslems to their respective holy places.
Thus shall it always be."
Israel occupied the Arab sector of Jerusalem along
with the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Caza Strip
and the Sinai Desert in the 1967 Mideast War. East
Jerusalem, the site of several of Islam's holiest shrines,
had been under Jordanian control.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today and tonight. Mostly fair tomorrow.
Slightly warmer days. Highs today in the 60s to near 70
and tomorrow in the mid 60s to low 70s. Winds westerly
10 to 20 mph.
