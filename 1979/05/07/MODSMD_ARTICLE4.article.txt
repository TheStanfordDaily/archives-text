# Moratorium on gasoline sales planned by dealers in protest
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
Car owners in the Stanford area
may have trouble finding gas in the
coming weeks as many local dealers
are reducing operating hours and
preparing to shut down pumps bet
ween May 17 and 20.
Of the seven local gas station deal
ers surveyed, all reported that they
had cut operating hours at least in
half in recent weeks, and most ag
reed that the chance of these hours
being reduced again this month is
very high.
Many local station owners and
managers are undecided whether
they will comply with the Santa Clara
County Service Station Dealers As
sociation decision to close pumps
between May 17 and 20.
On April 26, SCCSSDA's4SO mem
bers unanimously voted to declare a
four day moratorium on gasoline
sales. SCCSSDA members account
for about 70 percent of the gas sta
tion owners in Santa Clara County
and are instituting the four-day gas
moratorium as a protest against the
federal Department of Energy (DOE)
pricing and allocation standards, ac
cording to the organization's presi
dent, George Saunders.
Station closure
The closure, according to Saun
ders, is gaining momentum across
the country and is designed to ease
federal controls so that dealers can
earn at least a 25 percent profit on the
wholesale price gas dealers pay and
the retail fuel they sell toconsumers.
Gary Andrews, owner of Campus
Shell said, "They (SCCSSDA dealers)
are trying to gain a little attention by
closing four days and hopefully in
crease their profit margin." Andrews
noted that station dealers are cur
rently operating under the same per
centage profit margin as that in effect
in 1971.
Andrews, an SCCSSDA member, is
not sure if he will close his station
between May 17 and May 20. He said

his decision will "depend on what
other local dealers do."
Others to comply?
According to Andrews, many
non-association members will honor
the SCCSSDA decision because
those stations remaining open would
not be able to handle the increased
demand anyway.
Andrews reported that he has cut
operating hours back at least 50 per
cent this month. He is currently sel
ling gas for about five hours every
weekday. Andrews' station is closed
on weekends. The station owner said
that at busy hours, "gas lines are very
bad" and pointed out that a 75-car
line results in a wait of about 1 Vi
hours for the consumer.
Carol Hearn, manager of Charles
ton Shell, located at i9OO Middlefield
Road in Palo Alto, reported that her
station has reduced its daily operat
ing hours from 14 to 10 hours and

said that the station is closed on
weekends.
Long lines
Hearn said she believes that the
gas shortage is caused by oil com
panies "wanting to raise their prices"
and that she finds cars parked in a
line around the block when she ar
rives at the station in the morning.
According to the station manager,
anxious consumers park their cars in
the line during the night in the hope
of shortening their morning wait at
the pumps.
According to several dealers, the
gas shortage in the Bay Area is one of
the worst in the country. Dealers an
ticipate greater shortages in the com
ing weeks as the country moves into
the peak driving months of late May
and |une, vacation time for many
families.
Shane Bishop, a worker at Fill-Em-
Fast self service station, located at
1795 El Camino, said that his station
was out of gas Friday due to delays in
company deliveries. Bishop was un
sure if the station would close during
the upcoming moratorium and re
ported that the station is usually
open on Saturday but closed all day
Sunday.
A 'madhouse'
According to Bishop, lines at the
Palo Alto station range from 30 to 40
cars in length which means about a
40-minute wait for the customer.
The manager of George and Bob's
Chevron station at 1177 El Camino in
Menlo Park, Larry Jensen, said that

he is undecided about his station's
hours during the moratorium. Jen
sen called station business "a
madhouse in the mornings," and
explained that the station's monthly
allocations of gas from Chevron are
down 20 percent from last month.
Mark Rezendes, manager of Palo
Alto Shell at 2200 El Camino, is also
undecided about his station's hours
between May 17 and 20. Rezendes
reported that although the majority
of customers are "accepting of and
resigned to the lines," there are a few
people who are angry and are caus
ing problems.
