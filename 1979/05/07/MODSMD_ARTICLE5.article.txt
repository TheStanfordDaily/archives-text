# Carter wants facts on California gas supply
## 
### Associated Press 
In California this weekend, the
gasoline supply situation worsened,
with reports of violence flaring at the
pumps and some drivers waiting
hours — sometimes overnight — just
to top off their tanks.
President jimmy Carter, who vis
ited the Los Angeles area Saturday,
said he ordered Energy Secretary
James Schlesinger to "immediately
determine the facts" of California's
severe gasoline shortage and report
on what new steps might be taken to
alleviate the problem.
California hopes to ease the
crunch at the service stations
through an odd-even gasoline dis
tribution system pinned to vehicle
license plate numbers. Some coun

ties, including Los Angeles, are ex
pected to adopt the state-approved
plan today.
Only an estimated 15 percent of
Los Angeles area gasoline stations
opened yesterday, and lines of cars
formed before dawn.
At some closed stations, where en
trances were not blocked by ropes or
oil drums, cars were parked and
locked, the owners trying to be in
good position when the stations
opened early today.
Other motorists didn't want to wait
and tried to bribe station operators
to open early or re-open just for
them.
"If I wasn't so honest, I could make
$200 a day in bribes," said the
operator of one Los Angeles station.
