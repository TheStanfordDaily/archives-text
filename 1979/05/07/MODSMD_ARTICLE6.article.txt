# Biofeedback helps to reduce stress

### Krisan Froelich 
"Okay. Think of something embarassing."
The low tones recorded on the machine skyrocketed in
pitch. The needle moved swiftly to the end of the scale as the
machine measured the reaction of my body to my thoughts.
"Lean back and close your eyes," Dr. Alan Brauer, physician
specialist at the Medical Center, told me. "Breathe slowly and
deeply and repeat to yourself the phrase 'I am calm.' "
As the words occupied my thoughts, the beep of the
machine lowered in pitch.
"Now just let yourself float down into the chair." The doc
tor's voice became soft and steady. "Repeat to yourself 'my
hands are heavy and warm.' "
As I concentrated on this new thought, I felt the tingling of
blood in my fingers. The temperature recorded on the machine
increased a couple of degrees. I was beginning to feel drowsy
and heavy.
"Okay. Now open your eyes slowly," Brauer said. "You have
just experienced three common signs of relaxation: warmth,
the tingling of blood flowing, and heaviness."

Three years ago, Brauer
set up the Biofeedback and
Stress Reduction Clinic in
the psychiatry department
of the Med Center to pro
vide the "kind of treatment
unavailable" elsewhere in
the University. The clinic is
specifically designed to
treat patients with stress
related and psychosymatic
illnesses.
Many illnesses are caused
or worsened by stress.
Stress, as Brauer defined it,
can be any type of pressure
resulting from jobs, rela
tionships, survival, or wor
ries in general.
"Stress in the form of life
changes can actually cause
sickness," Brauer said. He
cited a study which rated
causes of stress on an arbit
rary point scale. For in
stance, divorce might rank
at 50 points while a traffic
ticket would rank two
points. The study showed
that the more points scored
in a given year, the more
likely the person was to con
tract a given illness.
With the discovery of
biofeedback and other rela
xation techniques, a
method has developed to
treat both the emotional
stress and the physical

symptoms of the illness.
Brauer explained,
"Biofeedback bridges the
gap between the emotional
and the physical.
"Emotional and physical
problems are equally rep
resented among our pa
tients," he said. Physical
problems related to stress
include high blood pres
sure, asthma, stomach and
skin disorders and tension
and migraine headaches.
Emotional problems in
clude marital and sexual
complaints.
"People tend to split
emotional and physical dis
orders, yet we know the
mind and the body are con
nected," Brauer said. "Here
we treat both physical and
emotional problems."
According to Brauer,
biofeedback works on three
principles. First, everything
in the mind affects the body
and everything in the body
affects the mind. Second,
it's possible to learn to con
trol some aspects of body
functioning previously
thought to be outside con
trol, particularly the au
tonomic nervous system.
Third, learning to control
these functions requires in
formation. Biofeedback

provides that information.
Developed about 10 years
ago, biofeedback has been
growing rapidly. "It is really
very simple in concept,"
Brauer said. "We had the
technology 50 years ago.
However, no one thought
there would be any point in
showing the patient that
type of information." Three
years ago, he added, no one
here was using biofeedback
or relaxation techniques.
The clinic uses biofeed
back as part of a program
designed to teach the pa
tient methods of relaxation.
"Take a person with mig
raine headaches," Brauer
explained. "Commonly this
person would have had
them for a number of years
and it would be established
that there is no other likely
cause than stress."
First the doctor or
therapist would obtain a
complete history of the
problem, an assessment of
the patient's general life
situation and a description
of the headaches. Then a
"training" process would
begin which consists of
50-minute sessions once a
week for six to 12 weeks.
"With the use of biofeed
back, both the patient and
the therapist can see areas
that provoke anxiety in the
patient," Brauer said. In
other words, if while they
are talking, they reach an
area of stress or worry for
the patient, it will register
on the machine in the form
of increased heart rate,
muscle tension or low body
temperature.
"We try to elicit a relaxa
tion response," Brauer said.
"A relaxation response is
the opposite of a 'flight
fight' response. Flight fight
is the person's reaction to
stress."
As Brauer explained,
when a person is con
fronted with a stress or a

stress situation, his body
reacts. This reaction can be
seen in an increase in pulse,
blood pressure, hormone
level or a dilation of the
eyes.
"People don't really need
that type of reaction now,"
Brauer said. "We're subject
to a different type of stress;
a stress that can't be run
from."
As people face situations
like one exam after another
or a series of deadlines,
their body gets "stuck" in a
"stressed on" position. "It's
like pushing the accelerator
down on a car," Brauer said.
"If you keep it down, you'll
burn the engine out."
The clinic teaches pa
tients to turn off the stres
sed reaction and turn on re
laxation. "It's really very
simple," Brauer said, "al
though it takes months of
practice."
Placing the patient in a
quiet atmosphere and com

fortable body position, the
therapist teaches him to pay
attention to his body in a
"passive" way. "This is the
hardest part to teach and to
learn," Brauer said. "The
harder you try to control a
body reaction, the more
you have the opposite effect
than the one you're striving
for."
The clinic uses a series of
procedures to embody
these concepts such as au
togenic training, progres
sive muscle relaxation, bre
athing and meditative
techniques, self-hypnotic
methods and visual and
guided imagery, along with
biofeedback. "We teach all
tne patients all the
techniques, so they can
select the one they find
most useful."
Most of the patients who
have used biofeedback find
it fun. "We try to make it a
challenge. It's like a game,"
Brauer said. A therapist en

courages the patient to try
to loweror raise the number
seen on the machine or
lower the tone of a sound.
"People love compet
ing," Brauersaid. "And they
are competing with them
selves, so they win." Ac
cording to Brauer, the key
to learning is to control your
body without anxiety. "The
patients have to learn not to
be under stress while they
are competing."
The success of the patient
depends on the problem
and the amount of practice
time he puts in outside the
clinic. Brauer said patients
need to practice 15 to 30 mi
nutes daily. To give the pa
tient a definite method to
follow, the clinic provides a
cassette tape of the ses
sions.
Therapists in the clinic
see about 100 patients a
week. Brauer said about 80
to 90 percent of the patients
with migraines feel "sig

nificantly" better after six to
10 sessions. For high blood
pressure, it's about 60 to 70
percent and about 50 per
cent for the rest. Of that re
maining 50 percent, about
75 percent of them are
"handling stress better."
Brauer said, "At the very
least the patient can learn
how to cope with stress."
The clinic is supported by
the psychiatry department
but ends up "paying for it
self." The cost of minimum
treatment is $300. "By the
time people come to us,
they've seen about 18 or 20
doctors over a period of
years," Brauer said.
"Even if you don't have a
specific symptom, you may
benefit by biofeedback,"
Brauer said. It can prevent
illness, help you cope with
stress better or improve
your self-esteem. "Some of
the people we see just want
to feel better about them
selves."

stress situation, his body
reacts. This reaction can be
seen in an increase in pulse,
blood pressure, hormone
level or a dilation of the
eyes.
"People don't really need
that type of reaction now,"
Brauer said. "We're subject
to a different type of stress;
a stress that can't be run
from."
As people face situations
like one exam after another
or a series of deadlines,
their body gets "stuck" in a
"stressed on" position. "It's
like pushing the accelerator
down on a car," Brauer said.
"If you keep it down, you'll
burn the engine out."
The clinic teaches pa
tients to turn off the stres
sed reaction and turn on re
laxation. "It's really very
simple," Brauer said, "al
though it takes months of
practice."
Placing the patient in a
quiet atmosphere and com

fortable body position, the
therapist teaches him to pay
attention to his body in a
"passive" way. "This is the
hardest part to teach and to
learn," Brauer said. "The
harder you try to control a
body reaction, the more
you have the opposite effect
than the one you're striving
for."
The clinic uses a series of
procedures to embody
these concepts such as au
togenic training, progres
sive muscle relaxation, bre
athing and meditative
techniques, self-hypnotic
methods and visual and
guided imagery, along with
biofeedback. "We teach all
tne patients all the
techniques, so they can
select the one they find
most useful."
Most of the patients who
have used biofeedback find
it fun. "We try to make it a
challenge. It's like a game,"
Brauer said. A therapist en

courages the patient to try
to loweror raise the number
seen on the machine or
lower the tone of a sound.
"People love compet
ing," Brauersaid. "And they
are competing with them
selves, so they win." Ac
cording to Brauer, the key
to learning is to control your
body without anxiety. "The
patients have to learn not to
be under stress while they
are competing."
The success of the patient
depends on the problem
and the amount of practice
time he puts in outside the
clinic. Brauer said patients
need to practice 15 to 30 mi
nutes daily. To give the pa
tient a definite method to
follow, the clinic provides a
cassette tape of the ses
sions.
Therapists in the clinic
see about 100 patients a
week. Brauer said about 80
to 90 percent of the patients
with migraines feel "sig

nificantly" better after six to
10 sessions. For high blood
pressure, it's about 60 to 70
percent and about 50 per
cent for the rest. Of that re
maining 50 percent, about
75 percent of them are
"handling stress better."
Brauer said, "At the very
least the patient can learn
how to cope with stress."
The clinic is supported by
the psychiatry department
but ends up "paying for it
self." The cost of minimum
treatment is $300. "By the
time people come to us,
they've seen about 18 or 20
doctors over a period of
years," Brauer said.
"Even if you don't have a
specific symptom, you may
benefit by biofeedback,"
Brauer said. It can prevent
illness, help you cope with
stress better or improve
your self-esteem. "Some of
the people we see just want
to feel better about them
selves."

"Okay. Think of something embarassing."
The low tones recorded on the machine skyrocketed in
pitch. The needle moved swiftly to the end of the scale as the
machine measured the reaction of my body to my thoughts.
"Lean back and close your eyes," Dr. Alan Brauer, physician
specialist at the Medical Center, told me. "Breathe slowly and
deeply and repeat to yourself the phrase 'I am calm.' "
As the words occupied my thoughts, the beep of the
machine lowered in pitch.
"Now just let yourself float down into the chair." The doc
tor's voice became soft and steady. "Repeat to yourself 'my
hands are heavy and warm.' "
As I concentrated on this new thought, I felt the tingling of
blood in my fingers. The temperature recorded on the machine
increased a couple of degrees. I was beginning to feel drowsy
and heavy.
"Okay. Now open your eyes slowly," Brauer said. "You have
just experienced three common signs of relaxation: warmth,
the tingling of blood flowing, and heaviness."

Three years ago, Brauer
set up the Biofeedback and
Stress Reduction Clinic in
the psychiatry department
of the Med Center to pro
vide the "kind of treatment
unavailable" elsewhere in
the University. The clinic is
specifically designed to
treat patients with stress
related and psychosymatic
illnesses.
Many illnesses are caused
or worsened by stress.
Stress, as Brauer defined it,
can be any type of pressure
resulting from jobs, rela
tionships, survival, or wor
ries in general.
"Stress in the form of life
changes can actually cause
sickness," Brauer said. He
cited a study which rated
causes of stress on an arbit
rary point scale. For in
stance, divorce might rank
at 50 points while a traffic
ticket would rank two
points. The study showed
that the more points scored
in a given year, the more
likely the person was to con
tract a given illness.
With the discovery of
biofeedback and other rela
xation techniques, a
method has developed to
treat both the emotional
stress and the physical

symptoms of the illness.
Brauer explained,
"Biofeedback bridges the
gap between the emotional
and the physical.
"Emotional and physical
problems are equally rep
resented among our pa
tients," he said. Physical
problems related to stress
include high blood pres
sure, asthma, stomach and
skin disorders and tension
and migraine headaches.
Emotional problems in
clude marital and sexual
complaints.
"People tend to split
emotional and physical dis
orders, yet we know the
mind and the body are con
nected," Brauer said. "Here
we treat both physical and
emotional problems."
According to Brauer,
biofeedback works on three
principles. First, everything
in the mind affects the body
and everything in the body
affects the mind. Second,
it's possible to learn to con
trol some aspects of body
functioning previously
thought to be outside con
trol, particularly the au
tonomic nervous system.
Third, learning to control
these functions requires in
formation. Biofeedback

provides that information.
Developed about 10 years
ago, biofeedback has been
growing rapidly. "It is really
very simple in concept,"
Brauer said. "We had the
technology 50 years ago.
However, no one thought
there would be any point in
showing the patient that
type of information." Three
years ago, he added, no one
here was using biofeedback
or relaxation techniques.
The clinic uses biofeed
back as part of a program
designed to teach the pa
tient methods of relaxation.
"Take a person with mig
raine headaches," Brauer
explained. "Commonly this
person would have had
them for a number of years
and it would be established
that there is no other likely
cause than stress."
First the doctor or
therapist would obtain a
complete history of the
problem, an assessment of
the patient's general life
situation and a description
of the headaches. Then a
"training" process would
begin which consists of
50-minute sessions once a
week for six to 12 weeks.
"With the use of biofeed
back, both the patient and
the therapist can see areas
that provoke anxiety in the
patient," Brauer said. In
other words, if while they
are talking, they reach an
area of stress or worry for
the patient, it will register
on the machine in the form
of increased heart rate,
muscle tension or low body
temperature.
"We try to elicit a relaxa
tion response," Brauer said.
"A relaxation response is
the opposite of a 'flight
fight' response. Flight fight
is the person's reaction to
stress."
As Brauer explained,
when a person is con
fronted with a stress or a

stress situation, his body
reacts. This reaction can be
seen in an increase in pulse,
blood pressure, hormone
level or a dilation of the
eyes.

increased a couple of degrees. I was beginning to feel drowsy
and heavy.
"Okay. Now open your eyes slowly," Brauer said. "You have
just experienced three common signs of relaxation: warmth,
the tingling of blood flowing, and heaviness."

Three years ago, Brauer
set up the Biofeedback and
Stress Reduction Clinic in
the psychiatry department
of the Med Center to pro
vide the "kind of treatment
unavailable" elsewhere in
the University. The clinic is
specifically designed to
treat patients with stress
related and psychosymatic
illnesses.
Many illnesses are caused
or worsened by stress.
Stress, as Brauer defined it,
can be any type of pressure
resulting from jobs, rela
tionships, survival, or wor
ries in general.
"Stress in the form of life
changes can actually cause
sickness," Brauer said. He
cited a study which rated
causes of stress on an arbit
rary point scale. For in
stance, divorce might rank
at 50 points while a traffic
ticket would rank two
points. The study showed
that the more points scored
in a given year, the more
likely the person was to con
tract a given illness.
With the discovery of
biofeedback and other rela
xation techniques, a
method has developed to
treat both the emotional
stress and the physical

symptoms of the illness.
Brauer explained,
"Biofeedback bridges the
gap between the emotional
and the physical.
"Emotional and physical
problems are equally rep
resented among our pa
tients," he said. Physical
problems related to stress
include high blood pres
sure, asthma, stomach and
skin disorders and tension
and migraine headaches.
Emotional problems in
clude marital and sexual
complaints.
"People tend to split
emotional and physical dis
orders, yet we know the
mind and the body are con
nected," Brauer said. "Here
we treat both physical and
emotional problems."
According to Brauer,
biofeedback works on three
principles. First, everything
in the mind affects the body
and everything in the body
affects the mind. Second,
it's possible to learn to con
trol some aspects of body
functioning previously
thought to be outside con
trol, particularly the au
tonomic nervous system.
Third, learning to control
these functions requires in
formation. Biofeedback

provides that information.
Developed about 10 years
ago, biofeedback has been
growing rapidly. "It is really
very simple in concept,"
Brauer said. "We had the
technology 50 years ago.
However, no one thought
there would be any point in
showing the patient that
type of information." Three
years ago, he added, no one
here was using biofeedback
or relaxation techniques.
The clinic uses biofeed
back as part of a program
designed to teach the pa
tient methods of relaxation.
"Take a person with mig
raine headaches," Brauer
explained. "Commonly this
person would have had
them for a number of years
and it would be established
that there is no other likely
cause than stress."
First the doctor or
therapist would obtain a
complete history of the
problem, an assessment of
the patient's general life
situation and a description
of the headaches. Then a
"training" process would
begin which consists of
50-minute sessions once a
week for six to 12 weeks.
"With the use of biofeed
back, both the patient and
the therapist can see areas
that provoke anxiety in the
patient," Brauer said. In
other words, if while they
are talking, they reach an
area of stress or worry for
the patient, it will register
on the machine in the form
of increased heart rate,
muscle tension or low body
temperature.
"We try to elicit a relaxa
tion response," Brauer said.
"A relaxation response is
the opposite of a 'flight
fight' response. Flight fight
is the person's reaction to
stress."
As Brauer explained,
when a person is con
fronted with a stress or a

stress situation, his body
reacts. This reaction can be
seen in an increase in pulse,
blood pressure, hormone
level or a dilation of the
eyes.
"People don't really need
that type of reaction now,"
Brauer said. "We're subject
to a different type of stress;
a stress that can't be run
from."
As people face situations
like one exam after another
or a series of deadlines,
their body gets "stuck" in a
"stressed on" position. "It's
like pushing the accelerator
down on a car," Brauer said.
"If you keep it down, you'll
burn the engine out."
The clinic teaches pa
tients to turn off the stres
sed reaction and turn on re
laxation. "It's really very
simple," Brauer said, "al
though it takes months of
practice."
Placing the patient in a
quiet atmosphere and com

fortable body position, the
therapist teaches him to pay
attention to his body in a
"passive" way. "This is the
hardest part to teach and to
learn," Brauer said. "The
harder you try to control a
body reaction, the more
you have the opposite effect
than the one you're striving
for."
The clinic uses a series of
procedures to embody
these concepts such as au
togenic training, progres
sive muscle relaxation, bre
athing and meditative
techniques, self-hypnotic
methods and visual and
guided imagery, along with
biofeedback. "We teach all
tne patients all the
techniques, so they can
select the one they find
most useful."
Most of the patients who
have used biofeedback find
it fun. "We try to make it a
challenge. It's like a game,"
Brauer said. A therapist en

courages the patient to try
to loweror raise the number
seen on the machine or
lower the tone of a sound.
"People love compet
ing," Brauersaid. "And they
are competing with them
selves, so they win." Ac
cording to Brauer, the key
to learning is to control your
body without anxiety. "The
patients have to learn not to
be under stress while they
are competing."
The success of the patient
depends on the problem
and the amount of practice
time he puts in outside the
clinic. Brauer said patients
need to practice 15 to 30 mi
nutes daily. To give the pa
tient a definite method to
follow, the clinic provides a
cassette tape of the ses
sions.
Therapists in the clinic
see about 100 patients a
week. Brauer said about 80
to 90 percent of the patients
with migraines feel "sig

nificantly" better after six to
10 sessions. For high blood
pressure, it's about 60 to 70
percent and about 50 per
cent for the rest. Of that re
maining 50 percent, about
75 percent of them are
"handling stress better."
Brauer said, "At the very
least the patient can learn
how to cope with stress."
The clinic is supported by
the psychiatry department
but ends up "paying for it
self." The cost of minimum
treatment is $300. "By the
time people come to us,
they've seen about 18 or 20
doctors over a period of
years," Brauer said.
"Even if you don't have a
specific symptom, you may
benefit by biofeedback,"
Brauer said. It can prevent
illness, help you cope with
stress better or improve
your self-esteem. "Some of
the people we see just want
to feel better about them
selves."

"Okay. Think of something embarassing."
The low tones recorded on the machine skyrocketed in
pitch. The needle moved swiftly to the end of the scale as the
machine measured the reaction of my body to my thoughts.
"Lean back and close your eyes," Dr. Alan Brauer, physician
specialist at the Medical Center, told me. "Breathe slowly and
deeply and repeat to yourself the phrase 'I am calm.' "
As the words occupied my thoughts, the beep of the
machine lowered in pitch.
"Now just let yourself float down into the chair." The doc
tor's voice became soft and steady. "Repeat to yourself 'my
hands are heavy and warm.' "
As I concentrated on this new thought, I felt the tingling of
