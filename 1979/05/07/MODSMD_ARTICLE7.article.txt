# Economics profs predict recession

University economists, both
conservative and radical, are
predicting a recession in the
U.S. economy.
"I wouldn't be at all sur
prised if the long-predicted, in
famous recession that was
supposed to be upon us six
years ago in fact does appear
by the end of the year," said
Karen Johnson, assistant pro
fessor of economics.
Johnson, who classifies her
self as "a mainstream macro
economist of a modern Keyne
sian sort," considers reces
sions inevitable to the econom
ic cycle
"Recessions just reflect the
fact that everybody's decisions
in a market economy are not
always perfectly timed to be ut
terly consistent, and unless we
get an omniscient government
— and I haven't seen one lately
— they're not apt to be able to
take actions in advance of the
system's economic cycle."
In a world in which unex
pected events happen, it is not
possible, she said, to devise a
system whereby the economy
could remain at its peak. The
best a government can do is to
minimize the severity of the
fluctuation. This, she claimed,
is what has happened.
Not as severe
lohnson added that the next
recession will not be nearly as
severe as the one in 1974 be
cause between '72 and '74, an

extraordinary series of events
occurred and this is not likely
to happen again.
Moses Abramovitz, emeritus
professor of economics, said,
"We won't be capable of re
ducing inflation without suffer
ing more unemployment."
Abramovitz, president-elect
of the American Economic As
sociation, added, "If we mean
to bring inflation under con
trol, sooner or later we shall
have to suffer some sort of re
cession."
Recession necessary
Economics Prof. John Gur
ley, a Marxist economist, of
fered a somewhat more pes
simistic and less acceptive view
of the inevitability of reces
sion. He claimed that from the
commercial and industrial ca
pitalist perspective, a reces
sion is necessary. A rise in un
employment would remind the
workers of their place.
Gurley, who teaches Econ 1
this quarter, explained that
"recessions are really invest
ment strikes or slowdowns by
capitalists, and although they
do much more damage than
strikes by labor, they are
treated much more sympathet
ically by the government."
Gurley expressed disap
proval of the Carter administra
tion's wage and price control
program. "The purpose of the
present program is to hold
down wages and let profits
rise. There are plenty of escape

clauses to enable corporations
toslipout from underand raise
prices and profits, just as they
did seven years ago."
'Zero effect'
lohnson, however, said she
does not see the present prog
ram as having had such nega
tive effects. "The actual wage
price control situation that he
(the President) has attempted
to implement, with guidelines
and all that, strikes me as hav
ing had a zeroeffect," she said.
She said the wage-price con
trols have legitimized the need
for employers to reduce wage
increases, something they
would have done anyway.
lohnson said she is satisfied
with what the government has
done, but fears that it might
have been acting for the wrong
reasons. She said she wishes
they were doing it for the right
reasons because then she
would have faith that they
would stick to the current
monetary policy.
"Whatever they do, even if
it's this wage-price control
stuff or if it's political rhetoric
or if it's letters to the Teams
ter's Union or whatever —

whatever they do that enables
them tocontinuepursuitof the
monetary policy which is now
being pursued —it will payoff.
The inflation will in fact be af
fected and the longer they pur
sue it the more sizeable will be
the ultimate attack on infla
tion."
On the other hand, Curley
said he predicts a dimmer fu
ture. "The fact is," he said,
"the government can't handle
inflation, unemployment and
slow capital formation at the
same time." He anticipates
that, in an effort to reinforce
the economy and the capitalist
class, the government will
probably give more tax cuts to
corporations and enact more
wage-price controls which will
be "rigged against labor."
In general, the primary dif
ference between the
mainstream and radical view of
the economy is that whereas
the mainstream economists
are trying to work out some
technical flaws of the system,
Marxist economists like Gurley
see the flaws and injustices of
the system as being inherent to
capitalism.
