San Francisco (AP) — Teen
age smoking has declined by 25
percent since 1974 despite the
fact that teenage girls who
smoke now outnumber boys
and are smoking more than
ever before, Health, Education
and Welfare Secretary Joseph
Califano said last week.
"While men are giving up
cigarettes and fewer boys are
starting, women are apparently
finding it harder to give up
smoking, and girls are taking it
up in increasing proportions,"
Califano said in a speech pre
pared for a meeting of the Na
tional Interagency Council on

Smoking ami Health.
Smoking by boys ages 17and
18 has fallen from 31 percent a
few years ago to 19 percent
now, but the rate for girls in
that age bracket has climbed
from 19 percent in 1968 to'past
26 percent, he said.
Girl smokers outnumber boy
smokers in this age group, 1.7
million to 1.6 million, Califano
said.
Califano said the youth sur
vey by HEW's National Institute
of Education found that 3.3
million persons age 12 to 18,
some 12 percent of that age
group, are regular smokers.
