# Penile implants provide remedy for many impotent men
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Impotence has often been a
tremendous emotional and
psychological burden to the
victim who can't perform for
his mate. Men suffering from
the condition have spoken to
psychiatrists in lengthy
sessions—seeking causes,
temporary remedies, relief.
Others have sought the im
mediate services of "loving"
prostitutes, specially trained to
deal with impotence, while
enabling the man to avoid the
embarrassing sexual confron
tations he might otherwise face
with his wife.
I Others sulk, certain their
problem is strange and irrepar
able. They wonder whether
they are gay or doomed to
;years of sexual frustration and
marital difficulties.
But within the past five years,
•in the wake of the so-called
sexual revolution, physicians
have taken to their drawing
;boards to find a remedy to this
problem which has plagued a
large minority of men foryears.
'And they have succeeded. The
device they have invented—
the penile implant. The Bay
Area is the home of several
nationally renowned
specialists who, as part of their
standard medical practice,
now install penile implants in
men who are qualified to re
ceive them.
"You can't believe what the
implant has done for me," said

a 58-year-old Monterey
businessman who received an
implant two years ago. "For
years I had unsuccessfully
sought psychiatric care and
though it worked temporarily,
the problem kept reappearing.
My wife is happy now; I am
happy; my kids are happier. I
think the implant has saved my
marriage, as it may have for
many men."
Impotence may be man
ifested in two ways. Physical
organic causes, constituting
approximately 5 percent of im
potence cases, are caused
from complications with vari
ous diseases. But psychic im
potence, which accounts for
the remaining 95 percent of all
impotence cases and lasts
longer than the temporary im
potence caused by work or
family stresses, sends the vic
tim seeking an immediate,
non-psychological solution.
Such men are now turning to
the penile implant for physical
sexual support.
Two types
Two types of implants are
being used in the Bay Area.
One version, a silicone rod,
measures about five inches in
length and is implanted into
the penis while the patient is
under local anesthesia. The
rod is implanted after a small
incision is made along the top
of the penis and a tunnel
created which holds the im
plant. The procedure t.ikes less

than an hour to perform and
costs from $500 to $750. A penis
holding this type of implant is
always somewhat erect.
"It is a crutch, a substitute
for an erection," said Dr. Har
vey Lash of the Palo Alto Medi
cal Clinic, the first person to
use silicone for penile im
plants. "The man is able to
have pleasurable sex . . . but
he must relearn intercourse.
Instead of the normal tendency
for long thrusts, he will have to
shorten the thrust and rely
more on rotation.
"Some men function beauti
fully, and others don't ever get
the hang of it."
Another implant method,
preferred by Dr. Robert Kes
sler, urologist and assistant
professor of surgery at the
Medical Center here, consists
of an inflatable device. The de
vice is geared to simulate a
normal erection.
Inflatable device
A circular reservoir with an
opaque liquid is implanted in
the abdomen. It is connected
by tubes to a pump in the
scrotum which, when
pumped, forces liquid from the
reservoir into the tubes lodged
in the penis, causing the penis
to become erect. The pumping
action, "which resembles
blowing up a balloon," Kessler
said, takes from five to 10 sec
onds. hollowing sexual inter
course, the man presses a re
lease valve which empties the

liquid from the tubes back into
the reservoir.
Cost of an inflatable penile
implant runs from $5000 to
$6000 including the charges for
a five-to-seven day hospital
stay, the operation and the de
vice. "It's expensive but that's
the cost o! inllation," Kessler
quipped.
Though penil implants are
lairly inexpensive to the pa
tient who is covered by Medi
care insurance (MediCal still
considers the operation
"cosmetic surgery" and re
fuses to pay for it), doctors
treating "impotent" patients
are more than cautious in de
ciding which bidders will re
ceive the implants.
Careful process
"It's a slow, careful
decision-making process.
First, we check to see whether
the victim is really impotent
much of the time. You often
get men who are in their 50s
and tind it unusual that they're
not getting an erection more
than once a week, when that
may be a perfectly respectable
rate. Some are having erec
tions, but just want to have
more of them, on demand,"
Kessler said. "We generally
don't do it on these men."
Interviews with the man anc
his wife, if he is married, are
carried out as part of the pro
cess, Kessler explained
"Sometimes when you brinj:

the wife in, you see that they
haven't really discussed it.
Then they really get into it in
my office," he said. "It often
turns out that she's perfectly
satisfied with their sex life and
with the way her husband is
performing. It's he that's not. I
don't put implants in men
under those conditions.
There's no point."
In addition, Kessler said that
more than 95 percent of men
with erectile impotence are
able to ejaculate and have or
gasms, even with a flaccid
penis. "With men like this, we
really question the need for an
implant," he said.
One in four
If the man passes a complete
physical examination, wants to
have the operation, is mentally
stable and is in agreement with
his wife on the issue, Kessler
performs the implant. Approx
imately one man in four who
inquires about solutions to
sexual impotence receives the
implant, according to Kessler,
who has performed more than
100 implant operations since
1975.
Most physicians use similar
methods to select suitable pa
tients. Lash works with
psychiatrist Thomas Ball to
choose the best candidates for
the procedure.
"Like Kessler, we look at the
expectations to see if they're in
line with the reality a man can
expect. Sometimes you run
into a woman who thinks her
husband wil be Ever-Ready
with an implant. The device
will not enhance his libido. We
don't implant them just so a
man will have a reliable
method at his fingertips," Ball
asserted.
Not known
Despite the upsurge in
popularity of the device and
the method of implantation
among impotent men, many
have not heard of it and are
surprised when, after spend
ing hundreds of dollars on
psycho-therapy, they are told
that a penile implant might re
medy their problem, Kessler
said.
Because of practices of med
ical ethics among physicians,
advertising the method is for
bidden. And laymen's
magazines and journals have
had little to say on the subject,
despite the devices' inventions
more than five years ago.
Despite the novelty of the
procedure, there have been
few complications, either

physically or emotionally, Bay
Area doctors claim.
Kessler, who uses the more
complicated inflatable device,
attested that of 100 implants he
has installed, only two have
been removed. "And about 90
percent are satisfied with it.
The people who aren't come to
me and say 'It's not big
enough.' I ask if he and his wife
are reaching orgasm. 'Oh yes,'
he says, but it's not big
enough.' Well, I tell them
that's as big as it's going to get.
It'll never be like a normal erec
tion," Kessler said.
Patient selection
Eric Strauss, one of Lash's as
sociates, stressed that proper
patient selection can all but
eliminate complications post
operatively. "If you do them
willy-nilly, you will have prob
lems. But complaints are rela
tively infrequent if patients are
screened properly."
The inflatable device, be
cause it is more complicated, is
perhaps more dangerous, Kes
sler admitted.
The patient is under anesthe
tic longer, but Kessler added
that the device provides less
tissue damage than the silicone
rods. "Because the penis is
flaccid most of the time, there
is less chance for tissue ero
sion."
Most men who receive the
implant share only the motivat
ing trait—impotence. Ball said
of the typical patient, "He
tends to be older, around 45 or
more, an age when his libido is
diminishing and he wants addi
tional physical support for his
sexual activity. He frequently
suffers from anticipatory fai
lure; he just convinces himself
before he begins to undress
that he won't be able to get it
up. He feels that he's in
adequate for his lover."
Delusions of grandeur
"Then there are those who
want to impregnate every
woman in North America; they
want to be some type of atomic
energy capsule. It's no wonder
they're suprised if they can't
have intercourse that often.
We reject people like this.
They suffer from too many de
lusions," Ball attested.
While psycho-sexual motiva
tions are foremost among im
potent men seeking implants,
other reasons spur men with
spinal cord injuries to inquire
about the implant. The Bay
Area is also a center for im
plants among those men who
need the implant to aid in ex

cretory functions as well as im
proved sex lives, according to
Dr. Inder Perkash of the Vete
rans Administration Medical
Center in Palo Alto.
"With the penile implant we
can make the penis large
enough to hold an external
urine collecting device. These
are more convenient and for
the sexual aspects, they are
ideal. Now the men feel certain
they will not lose their wives —
and that's something we are
often having to deal with,"
Perkash asserted.
'Born again'
Said Gene Brown, a 41-
year-old Bay Area veteran who
received an implant last year,
"I feel like I'm born again. My
girlfriend didn't know what to
expect, but it's an altogether
different relationship now."
Though Brown is able to reach
orgasm with the implant, he
said he feels no sensation. "It
doesn't matter that I don't
know when I climax. It's the
fact that I can have sex that mat
ters."
As penile implant operations
gain in popularity for impotent
men and for paraplegics, more
doctors are mastering the pro
cedure. "I didn't learn the op
eration as a medical student; it
was just being developed. Now
surgery residents and urology
residents are learning it; they
watch and soon will do it them
selves," Kessler said.
"We're now practicing
medicine in the wake of the
sexual revolution," Strauss ad
ded. "Older doctors probably
scorn the process; they're just
not comfortable with such a
thing; but the world's looser
now; doctors need to be pre
pared to deal openly with is
sues of impotence and sexual
problems."
Other doctors agree that the
impotent male should not be
forced into a corner in our soc
iety that in effect punishes him
for being handicapped.
"Impotence used to be
taboo," Kessler said. "People
wouldn't even talk to their doc
tor about it. They would come
in and complain about other
problems that were related but
they'd never identify the issue
as impotence. Now we're care
ful not to label the impotent
person as unmasculine.' Soci
ety is more aware now that im
potence is a medical problem
and like other medical prob
lems, should be approached in
the same way. I think that's a
good healthy attitude."

1975.
Most physicians use similar
methods to select suitable pa
tients. Lash works with
psychiatrist Thomas Ball to
choose the best candidates for
the procedure.
"Like Kessler, we look at the
expectations to see if they're in
line with the reality a man can
expect. Sometimes you run
into a woman who thinks her
husband wil be Ever-Ready
with an implant. The device
will not enhance his libido. We
don't implant them just so a
man will have a reliable
method at his fingertips," Ball
asserted.
Not known
Despite the upsurge in
popularity of the device and
the method of implantation
among impotent men, many
have not heard of it and are
surprised when, after spend
ing hundreds of dollars on
psycho-therapy, they are told
that a penile implant might re
medy their problem, Kessler
said.
Because of practices of med
ical ethics among physicians,
advertising the method is for
bidden. And laymen's
magazines and journals have
had little to say on the subject,
despite the devices' inventions
more than five years ago.
Despite the novelty of the
procedure, there have been
few complications, either

physically or emotionally, Bay
Area doctors claim.
Kessler, who uses the more
complicated inflatable device,
attested that of 100 implants he
has installed, only two have
been removed. "And about 90
percent are satisfied with it.
The people who aren't come to
me and say 'It's not big
enough.' I ask if he and his wife
are reaching orgasm. 'Oh yes,'
he says, but it's not big
enough.' Well, I tell them
that's as big as it's going to get.
It'll never be like a normal erec
tion," Kessler said.
Patient selection
Eric Strauss, one of Lash's as
sociates, stressed that proper
patient selection can all but
eliminate complications post
operatively. "If you do them
willy-nilly, you will have prob
lems. But complaints are rela
tively infrequent if patients are
screened properly."
The inflatable device, be
cause it is more complicated, is
perhaps more dangerous, Kes
sler admitted.
The patient is under anesthe
tic longer, but Kessler added
that the device provides less
tissue damage than the silicone
rods. "Because the penis is
flaccid most of the time, there
is less chance for tissue ero
sion."
Most men who receive the
implant share only the motivat
ing trait—impotence. Ball said
of the typical patient, "He
tends to be older, around 45 or
more, an age when his libido is
diminishing and he wants addi
tional physical support for his
sexual activity. He frequently
suffers from anticipatory fai
lure; he just convinces himself
before he begins to undress
that he won't be able to get it
up. He feels that he's in
adequate for his lover."
Delusions of grandeur
"Then there are those who
want to impregnate every
woman in North America; they
want to be some type of atomic
energy capsule. It's no wonder
they're suprised if they can't
have intercourse that often.
We reject people like this.
They suffer from too many de
lusions," Ball attested.
While psycho-sexual motiva
tions are foremost among im
potent men seeking implants,
other reasons spur men with
spinal cord injuries to inquire
about the implant. The Bay
Area is also a center for im
plants among those men who
need the implant to aid in ex

cretory functions as well as im
proved sex lives, according to
Dr. Inder Perkash of the Vete
rans Administration Medical
Center in Palo Alto.
"With the penile implant we
can make the penis large
enough to hold an external
urine collecting device. These
are more convenient and for
the sexual aspects, they are
ideal. Now the men feel certain
they will not lose their wives —
and that's something we are
often having to deal with,"
Perkash asserted.
'Born again'
Said Gene Brown, a 41-
year-old Bay Area veteran who
received an implant last year,
"I feel like I'm born again. My
girlfriend didn't know what to
expect, but it's an altogether
different relationship now."
Though Brown is able to reach
orgasm with the implant, he
said he feels no sensation. "It
doesn't matter that I don't
know when I climax. It's the
fact that I can have sex that mat
ters."
As penile implant operations
gain in popularity for impotent
men and for paraplegics, more
doctors are mastering the pro
cedure. "I didn't learn the op
eration as a medical student; it
was just being developed. Now
surgery residents and urology
residents are learning it; they
watch and soon will do it them
selves," Kessler said.
"We're now practicing
medicine in the wake of the
sexual revolution," Strauss ad
ded. "Older doctors probably
scorn the process; they're just
not comfortable with such a
thing; but the world's looser
now; doctors need to be pre
pared to deal openly with is
sues of impotence and sexual
problems."
Other doctors agree that the
impotent male should not be
forced into a corner in our soc
iety that in effect punishes him
for being handicapped.
"Impotence used to be
taboo," Kessler said. "People
wouldn't even talk to their doc
tor about it. They would come
in and complain about other
problems that were related but
they'd never identify the issue
as impotence. Now we're care
ful not to label the impotent
person as unmasculine.' Soci
ety is more aware now that im
potence is a medical problem
and like other medical prob
lems, should be approached in
the same way. I think that's a
good healthy attitude."


Dr. Kohert Kessler, urologist and assistant professor of surgery at the

stay, the operation and the device. The device is one of two types
used in the Bay Area.
Impotence has often been a
tremendous emotional and
psychological burden to the
victim who can't perform for
his mate. Men suffering from
the condition have spoken to
psychiatrists in lengthy
sessions—seeking causes,
temporary remedies, relief.
Others have sought the im
mediate services of "loving"
prostitutes, specially trained to
deal with impotence, while
enabling the man to avoid the
embarrassing sexual confron
tations he might otherwise face
with his wife.
I Others sulk, certain their
problem is strange and irrepar
able. They wonder whether
they are gay or doomed to
;years of sexual frustration and
marital difficulties.
But within the past five years,
•in the wake of the so-called
sexual revolution, physicians
have taken to their drawing
;boards to find a remedy to this
problem which has plagued a
large minority of men foryears.
'And they have succeeded. The
device they have invented—
the penile implant. The Bay
Area is the home of several
nationally renowned
specialists who, as part of their
standard medical practice,
now install penile implants in
men who are qualified to re
ceive them.
"You can't believe what the
implant has done for me," said

a 58-year-old Monterey
businessman who received an
implant two years ago. "For
years I had unsuccessfully
sought psychiatric care and
though it worked temporarily,
the problem kept reappearing.
My wife is happy now; I am
happy; my kids are happier. I
think the implant has saved my
marriage, as it may have for
many men."
Impotence may be man
ifested in two ways. Physical
organic causes, constituting
approximately 5 percent of im
potence cases, are caused
from complications with vari
ous diseases. But psychic im
potence, which accounts for
the remaining 95 percent of all
impotence cases and lasts
longer than the temporary im
potence caused by work or
family stresses, sends the vic
tim seeking an immediate,
non-psychological solution.
Such men are now turning to
the penile implant for physical
sexual support.
Two types
Two types of implants are
being used in the Bay Area.
One version, a silicone rod,
measures about five inches in
length and is implanted into
the penis while the patient is
under local anesthesia. The
rod is implanted after a small
incision is made along the top
of the penis and a tunnel
created which holds the im
plant. The procedure t.ikes less

than an hour to perform and
costs from $500 to $750. A penis
holding this type of implant is
always somewhat erect.
"It is a crutch, a substitute
for an erection," said Dr. Har
vey Lash of the Palo Alto Medi
cal Clinic, the first person to
use silicone for penile im
plants. "The man is able to
have pleasurable sex . . . but
he must relearn intercourse.
Instead of the normal tendency
for long thrusts, he will have to
shorten the thrust and rely
more on rotation.
"Some men function beauti
fully, and others don't ever get
the hang of it."
Another implant method,
preferred by Dr. Robert Kes
sler, urologist and assistant
professor of surgery at the
Medical Center here, consists
of an inflatable device. The de
vice is geared to simulate a
normal erection.
Inflatable device
A circular reservoir with an
opaque liquid is implanted in
the abdomen. It is connected
by tubes to a pump in the
scrotum which, when
pumped, forces liquid from the
reservoir into the tubes lodged
in the penis, causing the penis
to become erect. The pumping
action, "which resembles
blowing up a balloon," Kessler
said, takes from five to 10 sec
onds. hollowing sexual inter
course, the man presses a re
lease valve which empties the

liquid from the tubes back into
the reservoir.
Cost of an inflatable penile
implant runs from $5000 to
$6000 including the charges for
a five-to-seven day hospital
stay, the operation and the de
vice. "It's expensive but that's
the cost o! inllation," Kessler
quipped.
Though penil implants are
lairly inexpensive to the pa
tient who is covered by Medi
care insurance (MediCal still
considers the operation
"cosmetic surgery" and re
fuses to pay for it), doctors
treating "impotent" patients
are more than cautious in de
ciding which bidders will re
ceive the implants.
Careful process
"It's a slow, careful
decision-making process.
First, we check to see whether
the victim is really impotent
much of the time. You often
get men who are in their 50s
and tind it unusual that they're
not getting an erection more
than once a week, when that
may be a perfectly respectable
rate. Some are having erec
tions, but just want to have
more of them, on demand,"
Kessler said. "We generally
don't do it on these men."
Interviews with the man anc
his wife, if he is married, are
carried out as part of the pro
cess, Kessler explained
"Sometimes when you brinj:

the wife in, you see that they
haven't really discussed it.
Then they really get into it in
my office," he said. "It often
turns out that she's perfectly
satisfied with their sex life and
with the way her husband is
performing. It's he that's not. I
don't put implants in men
under those conditions.
There's no point."
In addition, Kessler said that
more than 95 percent of men
with erectile impotence are
able to ejaculate and have or
gasms, even with a flaccid
penis. "With men like this, we
really question the need for an
implant," he said.
One in four
If the man passes a complete
physical examination, wants to
have the operation, is mentally
stable and is in agreement with
his wife on the issue, Kessler
performs the implant. Approx
imately one man in four who
inquires about solutions to
sexual impotence receives the
implant, according to Kessler,
who has performed more than
100 implant operations since
1975.
Most physicians use similar
methods to select suitable pa
tients. Lash works with
psychiatrist Thomas Ball to
choose the best candidates for
the procedure.
"Like Kessler, we look at the
expectations to see if they're in
line with the reality a man can
expect. Sometimes you run
into a woman who thinks her
husband wil be Ever-Ready
with an implant. The device
will not enhance his libido. We

stay, the operation and the device. The device is one of two types
used in the Bay Area.
Impotence has often been a
tremendous emotional and
psychological burden to the
victim who can't perform for
his mate. Men suffering from
the condition have spoken to
psychiatrists in lengthy
sessions—seeking causes,
temporary remedies, relief.
Others have sought the im
mediate services of "loving"
prostitutes, specially trained to
deal with impotence, while
enabling the man to avoid the
embarrassing sexual confron
tations he might otherwise face
with his wife.
I Others sulk, certain their
problem is strange and irrepar
able. They wonder whether
they are gay or doomed to
;years of sexual frustration and
marital difficulties.
But within the past five years,
•in the wake of the so-called
sexual revolution, physicians
have taken to their drawing
;boards to find a remedy to this
problem which has plagued a
large minority of men foryears.
'And they have succeeded. The
device they have invented—
the penile implant. The Bay
Area is the home of several
nationally renowned
specialists who, as part of their
standard medical practice,
now install penile implants in
men who are qualified to re
ceive them.
"You can't believe what the
implant has done for me," said

a 58-year-old Monterey
businessman who received an
implant two years ago. "For
years I had unsuccessfully
sought psychiatric care and
though it worked temporarily,
the problem kept reappearing.
My wife is happy now; I am
happy; my kids are happier. I
think the implant has saved my
marriage, as it may have for
many men."
Impotence may be man
ifested in two ways. Physical
organic causes, constituting
approximately 5 percent of im
potence cases, are caused
from complications with vari
ous diseases. But psychic im
potence, which accounts for
the remaining 95 percent of all
impotence cases and lasts
longer than the temporary im
potence caused by work or
family stresses, sends the vic
tim seeking an immediate,
non-psychological solution.
Such men are now turning to
the penile implant for physical
sexual support.
Two types
Two types of implants are
being used in the Bay Area.
One version, a silicone rod,
measures about five inches in
length and is implanted into
the penis while the patient is
under local anesthesia. The
rod is implanted after a small
incision is made along the top
of the penis and a tunnel
created which holds the im
plant. The procedure t.ikes less

than an hour to perform and
costs from $500 to $750. A penis
holding this type of implant is
always somewhat erect.
"It is a crutch, a substitute
for an erection," said Dr. Har
vey Lash of the Palo Alto Medi
cal Clinic, the first person to
use silicone for penile im
plants. "The man is able to
have pleasurable sex . . . but
he must relearn intercourse.
Instead of the normal tendency
for long thrusts, he will have to
shorten the thrust and rely
more on rotation.
"Some men function beauti
fully, and others don't ever get
the hang of it."
Another implant method,
preferred by Dr. Robert Kes
sler, urologist and assistant
professor of surgery at the
Medical Center here, consists
of an inflatable device. The de
vice is geared to simulate a
normal erection.
Inflatable device
A circular reservoir with an
opaque liquid is implanted in
the abdomen. It is connected
by tubes to a pump in the
scrotum which, when
pumped, forces liquid from the
reservoir into the tubes lodged
in the penis, causing the penis
to become erect. The pumping
action, "which resembles
blowing up a balloon," Kessler
said, takes from five to 10 sec
onds. hollowing sexual inter
course, the man presses a re
lease valve which empties the

liquid from the tubes back into
the reservoir.
Cost of an inflatable penile
implant runs from $5000 to
$6000 including the charges for
a five-to-seven day hospital
stay, the operation and the de
vice. "It's expensive but that's
the cost o! inllation," Kessler
quipped.
Though penil implants are
lairly inexpensive to the pa
tient who is covered by Medi
care insurance (MediCal still
considers the operation
"cosmetic surgery" and re
fuses to pay for it), doctors
treating "impotent" patients
are more than cautious in de
ciding which bidders will re
ceive the implants.
Careful process
"It's a slow, careful
decision-making process.
First, we check to see whether
the victim is really impotent
much of the time. You often
get men who are in their 50s
and tind it unusual that they're
not getting an erection more
than once a week, when that
may be a perfectly respectable
rate. Some are having erec
tions, but just want to have
more of them, on demand,"
Kessler said. "We generally
don't do it on these men."
Interviews with the man anc
his wife, if he is married, are
carried out as part of the pro
cess, Kessler explained
"Sometimes when you brinj:

the wife in, you see that they
haven't really discussed it.
Then they really get into it in
my office," he said. "It often
turns out that she's perfectly
satisfied with their sex life and
with the way her husband is
performing. It's he that's not. I
don't put implants in men
under those conditions.
There's no point."
In addition, Kessler said that
more than 95 percent of men
with erectile impotence are
able to ejaculate and have or
gasms, even with a flaccid
penis. "With men like this, we
really question the need for an
implant," he said.
One in four
If the man passes a complete
physical examination, wants to
have the operation, is mentally
stable and is in agreement with
his wife on the issue, Kessler
performs the implant. Approx
imately one man in four who
inquires about solutions to
sexual impotence receives the
implant, according to Kessler,
who has performed more than
100 implant operations since
1975.
Most physicians use similar
methods to select suitable pa
tients. Lash works with
psychiatrist Thomas Ball to
choose the best candidates for
the procedure.
"Like Kessler, we look at the
expectations to see if they're in
line with the reality a man can
expect. Sometimes you run
into a woman who thinks her
husband wil be Ever-Ready
with an implant. The device
will not enhance his libido. We
don't implant them just so a
man will have a reliable
method at his fingertips," Ball
asserted.
Not known
Despite the upsurge in
popularity of the device and
the method of implantation
among impotent men, many
have not heard of it and are
surprised when, after spend
ing hundreds of dollars on
psycho-therapy, they are told
that a penile implant might re
medy their problem, Kessler
said.
Because of practices of med
ical ethics among physicians,
advertising the method is for
bidden. And laymen's
magazines and journals have
had little to say on the subject,
despite the devices' inventions
more than five years ago.
Despite the novelty of the
procedure, there have been
few complications, either

physically or emotionally, Bay
Area doctors claim.
Kessler, who uses the more
complicated inflatable device,
attested that of 100 implants he
has installed, only two have
been removed. "And about 90
percent are satisfied with it.
The people who aren't come to
me and say 'It's not big
enough.' I ask if he and his wife
are reaching orgasm. 'Oh yes,'
he says, but it's not big
enough.' Well, I tell them
that's as big as it's going to get.
It'll never be like a normal erec
tion," Kessler said.
Patient selection
Eric Strauss, one of Lash's as
sociates, stressed that proper
patient selection can all but
eliminate complications post
operatively. "If you do them
willy-nilly, you will have prob
lems. But complaints are rela
tively infrequent if patients are
screened properly."
The inflatable device, be
cause it is more complicated, is
perhaps more dangerous, Kes
sler admitted.
The patient is under anesthe
tic longer, but Kessler added
that the device provides less
tissue damage than the silicone
rods. "Because the penis is
flaccid most of the time, there
is less chance for tissue ero
sion."
Most men who receive the
implant share only the motivat
ing trait—impotence. Ball said
of the typical patient, "He
tends to be older, around 45 or
more, an age when his libido is
diminishing and he wants addi
tional physical support for his
sexual activity. He frequently
suffers from anticipatory fai
lure; he just convinces himself
before he begins to undress
that he won't be able to get it
up. He feels that he's in
adequate for his lover."
Delusions of grandeur
"Then there are those who
want to impregnate every
woman in North America; they
want to be some type of atomic
energy capsule. It's no wonder
they're suprised if they can't
have intercourse that often.
We reject people like this.
They suffer from too many de
lusions," Ball attested.
While psycho-sexual motiva
tions are foremost among im
potent men seeking implants,
other reasons spur men with
spinal cord injuries to inquire
about the implant. The Bay
Area is also a center for im
plants among those men who
need the implant to aid in ex

cretory functions as well as im
proved sex lives, according to
Dr. Inder Perkash of the Vete
rans Administration Medical
Center in Palo Alto.
"With the penile implant we
can make the penis large
enough to hold an external
urine collecting device. These
are more convenient and for
the sexual aspects, they are
ideal. Now the men feel certain
they will not lose their wives —
and that's something we are
often having to deal with,"
Perkash asserted.
'Born again'
Said Gene Brown, a 41-
year-old Bay Area veteran who
received an implant last year,
"I feel like I'm born again. My
girlfriend didn't know what to
expect, but it's an altogether
different relationship now."
Though Brown is able to reach
orgasm with the implant, he
said he feels no sensation. "It
doesn't matter that I don't
know when I climax. It's the
fact that I can have sex that mat
ters."
As penile implant operations
gain in popularity for impotent
men and for paraplegics, more
doctors are mastering the pro
cedure. "I didn't learn the op
eration as a medical student; it
was just being developed. Now
surgery residents and urology
residents are learning it; they
watch and soon will do it them
selves," Kessler said.
"We're now practicing
medicine in the wake of the
sexual revolution," Strauss ad
ded. "Older doctors probably
scorn the process; they're just
not comfortable with such a
thing; but the world's looser
now; doctors need to be pre
pared to deal openly with is
sues of impotence and sexual
problems."
Other doctors agree that the
impotent male should not be
forced into a corner in our soc
iety that in effect punishes him
for being handicapped.
"Impotence used to be
taboo," Kessler said. "People
wouldn't even talk to their doc
tor about it. They would come
in and complain about other
problems that were related but
they'd never identify the issue
as impotence. Now we're care
ful not to label the impotent
person as unmasculine.' Soci
ety is more aware now that im
potence is a medical problem
and like other medical prob
lems, should be approached in
the same way. I think that's a
good healthy attitude."

inquires about solutions to
sexual impotence receives the
implant, according to Kessler,
who has performed more than
100 implant operations since
1975.
Most physicians use similar
methods to select suitable pa
tients. Lash works with
psychiatrist Thomas Ball to
choose the best candidates for
the procedure.
"Like Kessler, we look at the
expectations to see if they're in
line with the reality a man can
expect. Sometimes you run
into a woman who thinks her
husband wil be Ever-Ready
with an implant. The device
will not enhance his libido. We
don't implant them just so a
man will have a reliable
method at his fingertips," Ball
asserted.
Not known
Despite the upsurge in
popularity of the device and
the method of implantation
among impotent men, many
have not heard of it and are
surprised when, after spend
ing hundreds of dollars on
psycho-therapy, they are told
that a penile implant might re
medy their problem, Kessler
said.
Because of practices of med
ical ethics among physicians,
advertising the method is for
bidden. And laymen's
magazines and journals have
had little to say on the subject,
despite the devices' inventions
more than five years ago.
Despite the novelty of the
procedure, there have been
few complications, either

physically or emotionally, Bay
Area doctors claim.
Kessler, who uses the more
complicated inflatable device,
attested that of 100 implants he
has installed, only two have
been removed. "And about 90
percent are satisfied with it.
The people who aren't come to
me and say 'It's not big
enough.' I ask if he and his wife
are reaching orgasm. 'Oh yes,'
he says, but it's not big
enough.' Well, I tell them
that's as big as it's going to get.
It'll never be like a normal erec
tion," Kessler said.
Patient selection
Eric Strauss, one of Lash's as
sociates, stressed that proper
patient selection can all but
eliminate complications post
operatively. "If you do them
willy-nilly, you will have prob
lems. But complaints are rela
tively infrequent if patients are
screened properly."
The inflatable device, be
cause it is more complicated, is
perhaps more dangerous, Kes
sler admitted.
The patient is under anesthe
tic longer, but Kessler added
that the device provides less
tissue damage than the silicone
rods. "Because the penis is
flaccid most of the time, there
is less chance for tissue ero
sion."
Most men who receive the
implant share only the motivat
ing trait—impotence. Ball said
of the typical patient, "He
tends to be older, around 45 or
more, an age when his libido is
diminishing and he wants addi
tional physical support for his
sexual activity. He frequently
suffers from anticipatory fai
lure; he just convinces himself
before he begins to undress
that he won't be able to get it
up. He feels that he's in
adequate for his lover."
Delusions of grandeur
"Then there are those who
want to impregnate every
woman in North America; they
want to be some type of atomic
energy capsule. It's no wonder
they're suprised if they can't
have intercourse that often.
We reject people like this.
They suffer from too many de
lusions," Ball attested.
While psycho-sexual motiva
tions are foremost among im
potent men seeking implants,
other reasons spur men with
spinal cord injuries to inquire
about the implant. The Bay
Area is also a center for im
plants among those men who
need the implant to aid in ex

cretory functions as well as im
proved sex lives, according to
Dr. Inder Perkash of the Vete
rans Administration Medical
Center in Palo Alto.
"With the penile implant we
can make the penis large
enough to hold an external
urine collecting device. These
are more convenient and for
the sexual aspects, they are
ideal. Now the men feel certain
they will not lose their wives —
and that's something we are
often having to deal with,"
Perkash asserted.
'Born again'
Said Gene Brown, a 41-
year-old Bay Area veteran who
received an implant last year,
"I feel like I'm born again. My
girlfriend didn't know what to
expect, but it's an altogether
different relationship now."
Though Brown is able to reach
orgasm with the implant, he
said he feels no sensation. "It
doesn't matter that I don't
know when I climax. It's the
fact that I can have sex that mat
ters."
As penile implant operations
gain in popularity for impotent
men and for paraplegics, more
doctors are mastering the pro
cedure. "I didn't learn the op
eration as a medical student; it
was just being developed. Now
surgery residents and urology
residents are learning it; they
watch and soon will do it them
selves," Kessler said.
"We're now practicing
medicine in the wake of the
sexual revolution," Strauss ad
ded. "Older doctors probably
scorn the process; they're just
not comfortable with such a
thing; but the world's looser
now; doctors need to be pre
pared to deal openly with is
sues of impotence and sexual
problems."
Other doctors agree that the
impotent male should not be
forced into a corner in our soc
iety that in effect punishes him
for being handicapped.
"Impotence used to be
taboo," Kessler said. "People
wouldn't even talk to their doc
tor about it. They would come
in and complain about other
problems that were related but
they'd never identify the issue
as impotence. Now we're care
ful not to label the impotent
person as unmasculine.' Soci
ety is more aware now that im
potence is a medical problem
and like other medical prob
lems, should be approached in
the same way. I think that's a
good healthy attitude."

stay, the operation and the device. The device is one of two types
used in the Bay Area.
Impotence has often been a
tremendous emotional and
psychological burden to the
victim who can't perform for
his mate. Men suffering from
the condition have spoken to
psychiatrists in lengthy
sessions—seeking causes,
temporary remedies, relief.
Others have sought the im
mediate services of "loving"
prostitutes, specially trained to
deal with impotence, while
enabling the man to avoid the
embarrassing sexual confron
tations he might otherwise face
with his wife.
I Others sulk, certain their
problem is strange and irrepar
able. They wonder whether
they are gay or doomed to
;years of sexual frustration and
marital difficulties.
But within the past five years,
•in the wake of the so-called
sexual revolution, physicians
have taken to their drawing
;boards to find a remedy to this
problem which has plagued a
large minority of men foryears.
'And they have succeeded. The
device they have invented—
the penile implant. The Bay
Area is the home of several
nationally renowned
specialists who, as part of their
standard medical practice,
now install penile implants in
men who are qualified to re
ceive them.
"You can't believe what the
implant has done for me," said

a 58-year-old Monterey
businessman who received an
implant two years ago. "For
years I had unsuccessfully
sought psychiatric care and
though it worked temporarily,
the problem kept reappearing.
My wife is happy now; I am
happy; my kids are happier. I
think the implant has saved my
marriage, as it may have for
many men."
Impotence may be man
ifested in two ways. Physical
organic causes, constituting
approximately 5 percent of im
potence cases, are caused
from complications with vari
ous diseases. But psychic im
potence, which accounts for
the remaining 95 percent of all
impotence cases and lasts
longer than the temporary im
potence caused by work or
family stresses, sends the vic
tim seeking an immediate,
non-psychological solution.
Such men are now turning to
the penile implant for physical
sexual support.
Two types
Two types of implants are
being used in the Bay Area.
One version, a silicone rod,
measures about five inches in
length and is implanted into
the penis while the patient is
under local anesthesia. The
rod is implanted after a small
incision is made along the top
of the penis and a tunnel
created which holds the im
plant. The procedure t.ikes less

than an hour to perform and
costs from $500 to $750. A penis
holding this type of implant is
always somewhat erect.
"It is a crutch, a substitute
for an erection," said Dr. Har
vey Lash of the Palo Alto Medi
cal Clinic, the first person to
use silicone for penile im
plants. "The man is able to
have pleasurable sex . . . but
he must relearn intercourse.
Instead of the normal tendency
for long thrusts, he will have to
shorten the thrust and rely
more on rotation.
"Some men function beauti
fully, and others don't ever get
the hang of it."
Another implant method,
preferred by Dr. Robert Kes
sler, urologist and assistant
professor of surgery at the
Medical Center here, consists
of an inflatable device. The de
vice is geared to simulate a
normal erection.
Inflatable device
A circular reservoir with an
opaque liquid is implanted in
the abdomen. It is connected
by tubes to a pump in the
scrotum which, when
pumped, forces liquid from the
reservoir into the tubes lodged
in the penis, causing the penis
to become erect. The pumping
action, "which resembles
blowing up a balloon," Kessler
said, takes from five to 10 sec
onds. hollowing sexual inter
course, the man presses a re
lease valve which empties the

liquid from the tubes back into
the reservoir.
Cost of an inflatable penile
implant runs from $5000 to
$6000 including the charges for
a five-to-seven day hospital
stay, the operation and the de
vice. "It's expensive but that's
the cost o! inllation," Kessler
quipped.
Though penil implants are
lairly inexpensive to the pa
tient who is covered by Medi
care insurance (MediCal still
considers the operation
"cosmetic surgery" and re
fuses to pay for it), doctors
treating "impotent" patients
are more than cautious in de
ciding which bidders will re
ceive the implants.
Careful process
"It's a slow, careful
decision-making process.
First, we check to see whether
the victim is really impotent
much of the time. You often
get men who are in their 50s
and tind it unusual that they're
not getting an erection more
than once a week, when that
may be a perfectly respectable
rate. Some are having erec
tions, but just want to have
more of them, on demand,"
Kessler said. "We generally
don't do it on these men."
Interviews with the man anc
his wife, if he is married, are
carried out as part of the pro
cess, Kessler explained
"Sometimes when you brinj:

the wife in, you see that they
haven't really discussed it.
Then they really get into it in
my office," he said. "It often
turns out that she's perfectly
satisfied with their sex life and
with the way her husband is
performing. It's he that's not. I
don't put implants in men
under those conditions.
There's no point."
In addition, Kessler said that
more than 95 percent of men
with erectile impotence are
able to ejaculate and have or
gasms, even with a flaccid
penis. "With men like this, we
really question the need for an
implant," he said.
One in four
If the man passes a complete
physical examination, wants to
have the operation, is mentally
stable and is in agreement with
his wife on the issue, Kessler
performs the implant. Approx
imately one man in four who
inquires about solutions to
sexual impotence receives the
implant, according to Kessler,
who has performed more than
100 implant operations since
1975.
Most physicians use similar
methods to select suitable pa
tients. Lash works with
psychiatrist Thomas Ball to
choose the best candidates for
the procedure.
