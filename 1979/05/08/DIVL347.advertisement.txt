"I wouldn't hesitate to
recommend NCS to others"
That's the way Sean Laughlin of Madera, Wilbur Hall, summed it up
when he discussed finances with Mark Triska, Stanford Community
representative for Northern California Savings. "I chose Northern
California Savings mainly because of their Telephone Transfer
Account. It allows me to earn interest on my money up until the
time I need it. Then, with just a phone call, I can transfer what I
need over to my checking account. It's really been useful for paying
those unexpected phone bills in a hurry. The people at NCS have
always been friendly and helpful in assisting me with my Telephone
Transfer Account. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend NCS to others."
Mark Triska is the man to see if you want more information about
Telephone Transfer, or any of the many Northern California Savings
services. Give him a call.
