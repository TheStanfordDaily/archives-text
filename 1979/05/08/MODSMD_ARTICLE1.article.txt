# Invisibility, isolation; problems for gays
## 
### Brad Crystal 
According to an estimate by the
Institute of Sex Research, homosex
uals constitute 10 percent of the U.S.
population (13 percent of the males
and five percent of the females).
However, of these numbers, gay
leaders say they believe only one
percent are "out of the closet," or
willing to reveal their sexual identity.
"Invisibility is the main problem of
gay people," according to freshman
Cam Smith, who serves on the Gay
People's Union (CPU) Steering
Committee here. He said one of the
primary purposes of yesterday's gay
blue jeans day and this week's Gay
Awareness Week is to engender a
"sense of community."
He explained that gay people, be
cause they are reluctant to identify
themselves, become "very isolated
and alone."
Smith's sentiments were echoed
by three other Steering Committee
members in a recent Daily interview.
Becky Fischbach, who graduated last
quarter and has served as a member
of the gay peer counseling group at
the Bridge for the past three months
stressed the importance of "coming
out."
"To be a person operating in the
world as a known gay person is really
important as far as breaking down
fears and stereotypes and bringing a
feeling of support," Fischbach said.
Although gay leaders contend
homosexuals come from every walk
of life and racial background, Fis
chbach says she believes "third
world gay people at Stanford have an
especially difficult position because
of the homophobia within their own
ethnic groups and the white
centrism of the gay community at
Stanford, which may not be inten
tional."
One of the greatest problems gays
face here, according to senior Wade
French, is the oppression of
"heterosexism," or dominance of
heterosexual values.
"People assume that everybody is
straight and so things done inside of
a (residence) are done for
heterosexuals," French said.
Heterosexism "makes it very, very
hard for someone who's gay to deal
with that and to come out because
coming out then becomes a very
political thing in which you're bump
ing everybody's mind-set."
Sarah Verstegen, who graduated
recently in human biology,

explained that negative role models
play a significant role in preventing
gays from being open. "Socially
there's a very negative representa
tion of homosexuality of the sort of
thing Anita Bryant talks about and
symbolizes."
Verstegen also pointed out the
need for increased gay awareness
among heterosexuals. "It's difficult
for straight people to realize that
somebody can be gay and not be a
sexual pervert or freak . . . we don't
have horns growing out of our
heads."
Fischbach agreed that "there's this
sort of generalized fear ... I re
member having the image of gay
people as these sexually lecherous
people out to get you."
All four Steering Committee
members concurred that gays often
go through a long, lonely struggle in
dealing with their homosexuality.
According to French, coming out
involves "acknowledging to yourself
that you are gay" and "coming to
terms with the fact that gay is OK,
that being gay is not going to destroy
your life."
Nevertheless, in Verstegen's case,
she said her self-realization of being
gay did not come about "until after
I'd seen role models that were posi
tive."
Smith agreed that positive gay role
models made it easier for him to
admit to himself that he was a
homosexual. "I don't know what I
would have done had I grown up 10
or 20 years earlier . . . that would
have been a lot harder."
One of the most difficult problems
of coming out is reconciling sexual
preference with family and parental
attitudes. According to French "com
ing out to the family is a hard experi
ence because you know it's going to
hurt them . . . they have to come to
believe that you are gay and it's not
just a phase you're going through
. . • they've got to go through exactly
what you've gone through."
Fischbach added "Parents have to
deal with the social stigma of having a
gay child."
Another frequent worry of gays
who come out is the specter of job
discrimination. While some 120 na
tional corporations including AT&T
and IBM have announced that they
do not discriminate in hiring or
promoting people because they are
homosexual.

As part of Gay Awareness Week, the Stanford Gay People's Union sponsored a
Gay Bluejeans Day Rally yesterday. Lonnie Nungesser told a crowd of more than
100 that the function of the week was to make nomosexuals and heterosexuals
more comfortable with their sexuality.
