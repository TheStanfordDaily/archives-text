# Survey finds repairs faulty
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Transpor
tation Secretary Brock Adams
said yesterday that 53 cents of
every dollar spent on fixing
cars is wasted.
Adams told a news confer
ence that a government
sponsored undercover survey
at garages selected at random
in seven cities found that a car
owner has one chance in two
of getting his car fixed right at a
fair price.
The study was conducted at a
cost of $66,000. Drivers visited
62 garages in Atlanta, Philadel
phia, Miami, Houston,
Nashville, Tenn., White Plains,
N.Y., and Brooklyn, N.Y., with
something purposely made to
misfunction on their cars.
Nine times in 10 when the
complaint concerned engine
performance, the garage per
formed an unnecessary repair
or missed the real problem,
Adams said.
The rate of over-repair or
under-repair was 32 percent
for complaints concerning
brakes, 44 percent for suspen
sions and 51 percent overall.

Adams declined to identify
the shops. He said their names
will be turned over to local au
thorities for possible prosecu
tions.
Adams said women and
men, black and white drivers
all received comparable treat
ment and no distinction was
found between garages in big
cities and those in White
Plains, a suburb.
In a case typical of the exper
iment, a white woman took a
1970 Dodge Challenger to a
chain store garage in Houston.
A spark plug had been fouled
to induce a miss.
"My car is getting poor gas
mileage and has lost power,"
the woman told the shop.
"Check to see if you can find
what the problem is."
The shop needlessly re
placed the points, air cleaner
and condenser and adjusted
the carburator, but did not
regap or replace the fouled
plug. The charge was $20.74.
All told, Adams said, the av
erage car owner is overcharged
$150 a year.

"Outright criminal fraud is
only a small part of the prob
lem," he said.
"What we have instead is a
variety of wasteful practices,
including habitual over-repair
or 'package deals' such as re
placing points, condensers
and spark plug wires when
only one spark plug is needed;
replacing parts until the prob
lem goes away — even though
one part may have been
needed, you wind up buying
the whole batch; and finally,
just plain old lack of compe
tence to do the job right," he
said.
He announced that rep
resentatives of the auto repair
industry, equipment manufac
turers, state and local govern
ment, consumer groups and
congressional committees will
attend a conference of the Na
tional Highway Traffic Safety
Administration and the Na
tional Academy of Science's
Transportation Research Board
May 22 to 24 to investigate the
problem further.
