# Starts here tomorrow
## New gas system underway soon 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Odd
even gasoline sales restrictions
will begin at 12:01 a.m. tomor
row for nearly half of Califor
nia's 15 million motorists, Gov.
Jerry Brown's top aide said yes
terday.
The restrictions will be im
posed only in counties where
local officials formally ask the
governor to declare an
emergency, Brown's chief of
staff, Cray Davis, told a meet
ing of county officials yester
day.
Before that meeting even
ended, three of California's
four biggest counties, Los
Angeles, San Diego and Santa
Clara, asked that Brown im
pose the license plate-based al
location system.
Combined, Los Angeles, San
Diego and Santa Clara, which
includes fast-growing San Jose,
account for 6.7 million of
California's 15 million
motorists.
Davis said othercounties will
also be included in Brown's ini
tial emergency proclamation if
local officials adopt resolutions
requesting the restrictions by
this afternoon.
The boards of supervisors in
at least eight other counties —
Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin,
Orange, San Mateo, Santa Bar.
bara, Santa Cruz and Ventura
— scheduled Tuesday meet
ings to consider the odd-even
plan.
Shasta County supervisors
rejected the proposal in a
Monday meeting, and San
Francisco officials delayed ac
tion until next week.

There will be followup or
ders for other counties if more
requests come in from local of
ficials after today's deadline for
the first emergency proclama
tion.
Under the odd-even restric
tions, motorists with odd
numbered license plates could
buy gasoline only on odd
numbered days, and motorists
with even-numbered plates
could buy gasoline only on
even-numbered days.
The plan — similar to one
imposed in 1974 during the
Arab oil embargo — is an at
tempt to reduce the long lines
at service stations, triggered in
part by shortages and by panic
buying.
In Los Angeles, where
thousands of motorists com
mute 50 to 100 miles daily to
work, lines at the few open sta
tions stretched up to seven
blocks long.
There were scattered reports
of frayed tempers and threats
at service stations, as well as
more comic incidents, such as
the request of a Pacific
Palisades attorney that nearby
cities including posh Beverly
Hills temporarily repeal their
ordinances against horses so
he could ride to work.
Los Angeles County lobbyist
Marvin Freedman said his
county, plagued by long lines
at stations, wanted to start the
odd-even plan at 12:01 a.m.
today. Davis said he would
look into that, but was inclined
to favora uniform starting time
for the program.
Meanwhile, at a hearing

chaired by Davis on the odd
even sales restrictions, Terry
McGovern, spokesman for the
California Service Stations As
sociation, said the state should
allow "free days" with no
odd-even sales restrictions on
May 16 and 21.
Those are the days before
and after service station own
ers in up to 35 states, including
California, are talking about a
shutdown to protest what they
say is their small share of
gasoline price profits.
McGovern told reporters
after his testimony that the av
erage dealer gets 10.47 cents
per gallon sold, and that deal
ers want at least two cents
more than that because the
federal government has not al
lowed them a price markup
since 1974.
Stations have been allowed
to pass on to motorists the in
creasing cost of gasoline, but
have not been permitted to
raise their profit margins.
McGovern, under repeated
questioning, said dealers
"don't want to alienate" the
public with the shutdown, but
that they feel they have no
leverage at any time except
during a crisis.
The plan provides for some
exemptions, such as
emergency and commercial
vehicles? Still unresolved yes
terday was whether out-of
state cars would be exempted,
but chairman Richard Maullin
of the state Energy Commis
sion said he was inclined to
support some form of exemp
tion for these vehicles.

The restrictions would also
prohibit sales of more than 2D
gallons to an individual
motorist and would prohibit
"topping off" of tanks by for
bidding sales to motorists
whose gasoline gauges read
more than half full.
Violations would carry mis
demeanor penalties — fines of
up to $500 and jail terms of up
to six months. McGovern, the
dealers' spokesman, protested
that provision, saying one at
tendant at a self-serve station
shouldn't be held responsible
for such violations.
Davis told the local officials
the goal of the allocation prog
ram was to provide a measure
of "certainty" where confusion
had reigned recently.
While beaches were nearly
empty, and patronage at re
staurants and entertainment
outlets slumped, spokesmen
for tourist attractions, includ
ing Disneyland and Knott's
Berry Farm, reported near
normal weekend attendance.
Meanwhile in Northern
California, radio stations car
ried paid commercials from
Lake Tahoe area visitors'
bureaus assuring tourists that
most gasoline stations were
open and well-stocked.
During the 1974 shortage,
Tahoe-area pumps remained
well-supplied when others be
tween there and the San Fran
cisco area were pinched for
gasoline. It was rumored then
that the full tanks resulted from
special influence of the gambl
ing industry.
