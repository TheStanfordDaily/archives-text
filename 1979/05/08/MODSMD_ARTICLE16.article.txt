## Fonda threatens dream 
### 
Actress Jane Fonda is rapidly
emerging as a serious threat to
the American way of life. And
not because she caused the
Three Mile Island reactor inci
dent, as some conservative
columnists suggest.
Her threat is more subtle, as
most Americans sense instinc
tively. They show this by the
energy and attention they give
to the question of why Fonda
does what she does.
Megalomania, say some.
Public relations, others
suggest. Still others find an un
expurgated guilt complex to
blame. Nonsense, grumbles
still another group: she is
merely simple-minded.
But hardly anyone ignores
her. How could they? Wander
into campus, and you find her
decrying the multinationals.
Turn on TV, and she is broad
casting to the deaf. Co
downtown, and she is rallying
secretaries for a raise.
It's easy to fault her informa
tion and even easier to fault her
logic. Drive all the multina
tionals to the wall, and all those
secretaries will have not
merely no raises but no jobs.
Little in common
Unfortunately for her no
questions-asked champion
ship of the disadvantaged, all
those groups she favors really
have in common is a claim to a
larger slice of the same
economic pie.
lust as undeniably their de
privations are real and their
causes at least partially just.
Who can reasonably oppose
the aspirations of underde
veloped nations, the poor, the
handicapped?
That is why it's hard to see at
first why Fonda's sponsorship
of these causes inspires so
much scorn and resentment.
Certainly the usual criticisms
levelled at her do not bear up
under analysis.
Not experts alone
Some point out she is no au
thority on the issues she backs.
This criticism holds weight
only among those who would
give over political questions
entirely to so-called experts.
What about the charge that
she's simple-minded? Cer
tainly, Fonda's mind is not
what impresses a casual bys
tander. Yet how much she

does know about subjects
quite removed from her career
bespeaks at the very least a rare
curiosity.
£he goes to some lengths to
bone up. A grizzled European
Marxist economist still muses
delightedly about the day
Fonda called him in Belgium
from California to clear up a
theoretical point.
What has all this to do with
acting, her only proven field of
expertise, ask others? Why
does she tax her audience with
her political opinions? Like
everyone else, Fonda has a
right to promote her views in
the way she thinks most effec
tive.
Like a politician massaging
his constituency, a
businessman investing in
selected Congressmen or a re
searcher publishing turgid
analyses, Fonda does what she
does best: she attracts mass
audiences and interprets large
questions for them in terms
they easily understand.
But others still complain:
why so many causes?
An economist would com
pliment her for using her com
parative advantage wisely. She
contributes her abundant re
source — publicity — exten
sively, instead of wasting her
talents stuffing envelopes for a
single cause.
Perhaps the r#al reason
Fonda irritates tolerant
America is that she threatens
the very basis of that tolerance.
Usually smothered
Normally the United States
smothers critics by allowing
them to vent their views but
ignoring them.
America cannot ignore
Fonda: she is too much its fa
vored child. Fonda was given
what other Americans only
dream of: extraordinary career
success, big money, fame. She
even remains a sex object
twenty years beyond her teens.
Having followed the Ameri

can Way to the top, and living
the American Dream, Fonda
now proclaims it empty. She
holds out a distinctly different
conception of the good life,
centered not on self but
others, not on personal free
dom but on the idea that one
cannot be free until all others
are.
In medieval Europe, people
burned heretics out of genuine
fear their ideas would con
taminate others and deny them
everlasting life. Today we tol
erate religious diversity beause
religion no longer matters; we
don't believe in lifeafterdeath.
However, we would like to
believe in heaven on earth,
conventionally defined in re
markable individualistic and
materialistic terms. The threat
embodied by Fonda is that if
even she can see the vanity of
this goal and pursue a different
one, may not others?
