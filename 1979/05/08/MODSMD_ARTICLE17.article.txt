# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Ginny Puddefoot Abortion: Consider mother's life 
### 
In the past several months,
there have been several
moralistic anti-choice articles
in the Daily. (Pro-choice is the
belief that a woman has the right
to choose whichever option,
including abortion, she wants
or needs in the event of un
wanted pregnancy. Anti
choice is the belief that abor
tion should not be an option; it
should be illegal.)
The most recent of these ar
ticles, by Lane Webster (Daily
April 24), exemplifies many of
the anti-choice attitudes. Dis
arming in his mild opening.
Webster includes some very
unmild statements that need to
be examined carefully.
Webster's lofty assessment
of the abortion issue can be
summarized in his own words:
"Why not throw away the fetus
once the pleasure of inter
course is received, just as we
shove the styrofoam carton off
the tray after gobbling up a
quar.terpounder? Funny how

the same type of plastic sack is
knotted up to dispose of both
kinds of refuse."
This emotional insinuation
reveals Webster's underlying
attitude that all women who
have abortions have an irres
ponsible and uncaring attitude
towards birth control, and
further that they view the fetus
as a mere inconvenience to be
quickly disposed of.
In other words, Webster
paints an evil picture:
women-villain,fetus-victim. . .
what could be simpler? And he
goes on to say: "A fetus' right
to live must almost always take
precedence over a woman's
right to elude stigma." (Em
phasis mine.)
Realities
Webster needs to be re
minded of a few realities.The
woman struggling to raise five
children on welfare, who sud
denly finds herself pregnant —
she's not concerned with elud
ing stigma, she's trying to sur

vive. Or would Webster call
this avoiding inconvenience?
And the teenager, who can
hardly handle her own sexual
ity, let alone pregnancy and
motherhood — is she merely
avoiding stigma by choosing to
let herself grow up before
mothering another? Is it the in
convenience that leads her to
choose not limitation and early
motherhood but freedom to
pursue her own life?
Or the woman of 45, with
grown children, who was sure
she was beyond her fertile
years, but suddenly finds her
self pregnant — are we asking
her to put aside merely her fear
of stigmatism by birthing the
child?
And, of course, there are wo
men, yes, it's true, who faith
fully use birth control ( after
deciding at this point in their
lives that they do not want the
responsibility of a child, for
whatever reasons) — are we to
"punish "them for failures
they're not responsible for?
How are these women to feel
about Webster's reduction of
abortion rights to "the right of
a woman to elude stigma"?
Doesn't degrade life
The facts are, women choose
abortion for a number of phys
ical, emotional, economic and
other reasons. Abortion does
not represent in any way a lack
of concern or respect for life;
rather it represents the view
that it is not right to force pre
gnancy or motherhood on any
woman.
Abortion has been with us
since long fiefore it was
legalized in 1973. All the legis
lation in the world
couldn't force women to go
through pregnancies they
didn't want. Prior to 1973, 250
women died each year from
botched back-alley or self
induced aborticms. Now that
abortion is legalized, these
deaths have been reduced to
virtually zero.
These women were not
moral abstractions. They were
real women, desperate women
who took the risks rather than
endure pregnancies, whatever
their reasons. These are the
facts. Not lofty idealism, but
real struggle for life and the
freedom to control that life.
The Issue
The real issue in the abortion

rights struggle, and this cannot
be stated strongly enough, is
not whether abortion should
be allowed. (It will occur re
gardless of its legal status, as
has been shown in the past.)
The real issue, the real choice,
is whether abortion will con
tinue to be safe and legal, and
will become accessible to all
who choose it, or whether it
will revert to the illegal, risky,
expensive procedure "availa
ble" to the wealthy and desp
erate prior to 1973.
If the "pro-lifers", as the
anti-choice groups like to call
themselves, were really pro
life, wouldn't they be less con
cerned with reinstating the re
strictive, anti-choice legisla
tion that caused so much pain
and death before 1973?
If they were really pro-life,
wouldn't they be more con
cerned with improving
people's lives, improving ac
cess to birth control and safe
abortion and increasing sex
education programs, so
that the need for abortion
would decrease?
If they were really , o-life,
wouldn't they promot the
ideals of wanted, happy chil
dren and responsibility in sex
and motherhood?
As Webster says, "We must
be careful, careful not to de
secrate, but instead to vener
ate life." This is exactly right.
So let's work for mothers that
are happy, willing mothers,
children that are wanter' hil
dren, and no more w
forced by unbearable
cumstances to choose unsaie
abortion. Sure'" wr concern
for the quality ce of
life will lead us safe,
accessible abor. . -sis is
what the pro-choice stile is
all about.
