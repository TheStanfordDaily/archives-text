## To divest is not best: a reappraisal of policy 
### 
A popular maxim during the
1960s was that "if you're not
part of the solution, you're part
of the problem." Sadly, this
characterizes some current
and widespread student senti
ments on University divest
ment policy.
When examined closely, the
"solution" of divesting stock in
corporations with holdings in
South Africa ends up as no sol
ution at all. Rather, it contri
butes to the problem by
suggesting that if you want
something to go away, ignore it
or leave it for someone else to
solve.
Almost anyone on campus
will tell you that the Universi

ty's investments in South Africa
are immoral. How can an in
stitution committed to educa
tion and the pursuit of know
ledge in its many forms, sup
port itself by taking advantage
of poorarid oppressed people?
The common answer seems to
be divestment; that univer
sities should sell their interests
in such an immoral affair.
There has been a rash of cam
pus protests throughout the
nation demanding exactly that.
However, what most di
vestment advocates have failed
toweigh seriously is the follow
ing question, which I cannot
answer: to whom should the
University sell its interests in

South Africa?
Consider the possible
buyers. Yale, for instance,
might be interested in buying
Stanford's interests. No, you
say, this solves nothing; and
besides, Yale students would
like their university to divest its
South African corporate in
terests. Similarly, any attempt
to sell these shares to an in
stitution of comparable "good
guy" moral instincts would
only slay one dragon and
create another in its place.
To racists?
So consider the alternative:
Stanford finds a detestable cus
tomer interested in racist op
pression of the disadvantaged.
The Ku Klux Klan or the Na
tional Front in England,
maybe? Idi Amin? Darth Vader?
Or pick your favorite villain.
No again, you would proba
bly say. Why should we do bus
iness with these racist and fas
cist groups, and give them
more of a chance to mold the
world in their ugly image? It is
obvious that this solution is
also absurd.
It becomes increasingly ap
parent that we don't want any
one to own our investments in
South Africa. But the undeni
able fact is that these invest
ments exist. And someone
who wants to divest cannot
simultaneously persuade
prospective buyers that they
shouldn't want the goods
either. We may feel better, no
longer profiting from an im
moral investment. But in any
plausible divestment scenario,
someone else would be.
Moral statement
On the other hand, Stan
ford's selling its stock holdings
would be a clear moral state
ment. The publicity generated
would appear on the front
pages of newspapers across
the country, make citizens
more politically aware of ques
tionable corporate policies,
frighten corporate manage
ment, and cause a momentary
drop in stock prices.

But the cost would be a loss
of stockholder influence, a
possible gain in the strength of
the management (if the new
stockholder was in agreement
with management, or the Uni
versity's holdings were sold to
many small investors who
would be more difficult to or
ganize in a stockholder revolt),
and finally a probable financial
loss for the University. The
world would eventually revert
to carrying on its affairs as

Divestment may end up being a Pontius
Pilate solution where the University
washes its hands of involvement and the
injustices go on unaffected.

usual.
If Stanford wishes to invest,
however, given two roughly
equivalent prospects, it should
choose the more "morally
worthy" of the two, and has
that choice precisely because it
has not yet committed itself.
With South African interests,
however, the University al
ready has its feet firmly in the
mud. Divestment may end up
being a Pontius Pilate solution
where the University washes
its hands (or feet) of involve
ment, and the injustices go on
unaffected. Stanford should
not so walk away from its re
sponsibilities.
Publicity
What other actions are pos
sible? Stanford, like other
major universities, can use its
public visibility to generate in
terest and alter public opinion.
What prevents President
Richard Lyman from publicly
and vigorously denouncing,
with or without the trustees'
endorsement, the actions of
American corporations in
South Africa? What prevents
Stanford's president and trus
tees from inviting their coun
terparts from large and influen
tial universities to a conference

to form a unified shareholder
policy in accordance with
mutually agreed principles?
Management fears stoc
kholder revolts. The challenge
to the University is to exercise
its considerable influence; di
vestment disperses it.
Not apologist
These remarks are not meant
to be apologist so as to pre
serve the status quo of the Uni
versity's investment policy, nor
to antagonize progressive

groups advocating divestment.
Rather, we cannot propose
such simple solutions to com
plex problems. Divestment is
not synonymous with progres
sive social action. Single issues
should not be litmus tests of
faith or pawns in ideological
clashes between left and right.
We cannot let simple
choices like divestment mar
our understanding of Stan
ford's complex moral respon
sibilities.
A naive divestment policy
embodies a facile solution to a
far more complicated issue. In
fact, divestment may be coun
terproductive to the social
changes we desire.
The corporations must with
draw their investments in
South Africa, yet divestment
may not greatly influence them
to do so. Stanford's trustees
must address these problems
â€” and we must remember that
the Stanford community is not
the Stanford corporation, only
its clients. But a sound invest
ment policy requires active in
volvement of that community.
We can greatly influence the
decisions to be made.
