Washington (AP) — The United
States and the Soviet Union com
pleted the outline of a treaty to
limit strategic nuclear weapons
late yesterday and have begun
planning a summit meeting for
the signing, administration
sources said.
An announcement was ex
pected by mid-week, possibly by
President Jimmy Carter tomorrow
night at a Democratic fund-raiser
here. His summit with Soviet Pres
ident Leonid Brezhnev is slated
for mid-June at a European site to
be determined by the end of the
week.
The reported breakthrough
came after a 45-minute working
session between Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Am
bassador Anatoly Dobrynin, and
was nailed down at a second, brief
evening session between the two
after Vance reported to Carter at
the White House.
The treaty had appeared near
completion for several weeks.
The final details concerned test
ing of missiles with multiple
warheads.

The text itself will be polished
over the next two or three weeks
by U.S. and Soviet negotiating
teams in Geneva, Switzerland.
The unscheduled, 11-minute,
second session between Vance
and Dobrynin gave rise to specu
lation that the long-elusive treaty
might finally be at hand.
State Department officials,
even those who normally give re
porters some indication of the
course of U.S.-Soviet negotia
tions, said a tight secrecy lid had
been imposed on them.
Ken Brown, an official spokes
man, was instructed to issue a
one-sentence statement saying,
"Secretary Vance hopes to com
plete his negotiations with Am
bassador Dobrynin this week"
and to make no further comment.
This could mean that the actual
treaty negotiations at their level
were over and that Vance and
Dobrynin had turned to their next
order of business. That would be
fixing a time and place for Carter
and Brezhnev to sign the accord,
which would limit U.S. and Soviet
long-range bombers and inter
continental ballistic missiles.
