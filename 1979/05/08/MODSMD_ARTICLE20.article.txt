Women's Center
As a staffer at the Women's
Center, I would like to respond
to the article on the Women's
Center (Daily, May 3). Every
thing said about the dramatic
increase in women's activities
as a result of the move to Room
13 of the Old Clubhouse is
t r ue.
The Women's Center was
told by certain members of the
administration that it could use
Room 13 for the remainder of
the school year. This was to
help facilitate Women's Week
organizing, since it was obvi
ous that the size and location
of the tiny "office" in the
Bridge was prohibitive to any
real activity.
Since the rot n was ours for
the remainder the year, it
was c -"locate the
Women f iles and
desks to Ro. well, in
order to faciluc <ther ac
tivities more smoothly.
I don't think any of us fully
anticipated 'ie huge response
women had > this relocation.
Immediately, imen's groups
began to meet t ere, potlucks
and presentations were held,
and of course, Women's Week
was organized. The room
quickly became not only a for
mal meeting place, but a
gathering space as well, where
women could meet to study,
relax and share. Women disco
vered a place to give of their
talents and interests.
However, a few weeks after

the initial "gift" of Room 13 to
the Women's Center on a tem
porary basis until June, we
were told that in reality we had
been given the room only dur
ing Women's Week planning.
Unfortunately, by the time we
were given this notice, many
women had come to regard
Room 13 as their room.
In those weeks, women had
discov red something that had
been sorely lacking before — it
has been difficult for us to try
and explain to all of them what
the true situation is. So it is no
real surprise that many women
regard the present controversy
in terms of it "being taken
away" rather than in the real
terms of "please give us a
space."
As a staffer of the Women's
Center, I sincerely apologize
for the confusion and the mis
representation of the situation.
It is our hope that the Women's
Center will soon be given the
space and location it deserves
— one that can truly serve and
welcome all the women at
Stanford.

In my dispatch from
Washington about the confer
ence of the American Associa
tion for Higher Education
(Daily April 23), several errors
occured in the transmission of
the story by phone. Although

these errors were verbally
minor, they alter the sense of
one speaker's remarks and
wrongly attribute another
point.
When James O'Toole refer
red to court insistence upon
due process and to the exis
tence of a free competitive
labor market as protections for
academic freedom, he called
these protections not "new",
as the printed text has it, but
"real" — in contrast, as
O'Toole believes, to tenure.
Far from being a recent de
velopment, job mobility in
academic life is fast disappear
ing, as the next paragraph
noted.
In mentioning the high per
centage of faculty who now
enjoy tenure, what O'Toole
said was not that many have al
ready worked "20 or 30 years
on the job," as the printed
story might suggest, but rather
the obverse: that the bulk of
tenured faculty are young and
have that much longer before
retirement.
The point about the proba
ble decline in the average qual
ity of undergraduates within
most institutions over the next
15 years was not made by
Everett Ladd, Jr., although he
might well agree with it, but »
was an assumption evident in
the remarks of several speak
ers at the conference.

Women's Center
As a staffer at the Women's
Center, I would like to respond
to the article on the Women's
Center (Daily, May 3). Every
thing said about the dramatic
increase in women's activities
as a result of the move to Room
13 of the Old Clubhouse is
t r ue.
The Women's Center was
told by certain members of the
administration that it could use
Room 13 for the remainder of
the school year. This was to
help facilitate Women's Week
organizing, since it was obvi
ous that the size and location
of the tiny "office" in the
Bridge was prohibitive to any
real activity.
Since the rot n was ours for
the remainder the year, it
was c -"locate the
Women f iles and
desks to Ro. well, in
order to faciluc <ther ac
tivities more smoothly.
I don't think any of us fully
anticipated 'ie huge response
women had > this relocation.
Immediately, imen's groups
began to meet t ere, potlucks
and presentations were held,
and of course, Women's Week
was organized. The room
quickly became not only a for
mal meeting place, but a
gathering space as well, where
women could meet to study,
relax and share. Women disco
vered a place to give of their
talents and interests.
However, a few weeks after

the initial "gift" of Room 13 to
the Women's Center on a tem
porary basis until June, we
were told that in reality we had
been given the room only dur
ing Women's Week planning.
Unfortunately, by the time we
were given this notice, many
women had come to regard
Room 13 as their room.
In those weeks, women had
discov red something that had
been sorely lacking before — it
has been difficult for us to try
and explain to all of them what
the true situation is. So it is no
real surprise that many women
regard the present controversy
in terms of it "being taken
away" rather than in the real
terms of "please give us a
space."
As a staffer of the Women's
Center, I sincerely apologize
for the confusion and the mis
representation of the situation.
It is our hope that the Women's
Center will soon be given the
space and location it deserves
— one that can truly serve and
welcome all the women at
Stanford.

College conference
In my dispatch from
Washington about the confer
ence of the American Associa
tion for Higher Education
(Daily April 23), several errors
occured in the transmission of
the story by phone. Although

these errors were verbally
minor, they alter the sense of
one speaker's remarks and
wrongly attribute another
point.
When James O'Toole refer
red to court insistence upon
due process and to the exis
tence of a free competitive
labor market as protections for
academic freedom, he called
these protections not "new",
as the printed text has it, but
"real" — in contrast, as
O'Toole believes, to tenure.
Far from being a recent de
velopment, job mobility in
academic life is fast disappear
ing, as the next paragraph
noted.
In mentioning the high per
centage of faculty who now
enjoy tenure, what O'Toole
said was not that many have al
ready worked "20 or 30 years
on the job," as the printed
story might suggest, but rather
the obverse: that the bulk of
tenured faculty are young and
have that much longer before
retirement.
The point about the proba
ble decline in the average qual
ity of undergraduates within
most institutions over the next
15 years was not made by
Everett Ladd, Jr., although he
might well agree with it, but »
was an assumption evident in
the remarks of several speak
ers at the conference.
