## Jabbing the American Dream: Allen's MANHATTAN 
### 
Isaac Davis, a comedy writer
tor television, is 42. He was di
vorced after his wife left him
for another woman. Davis'
girlfriend is 17. And now he
finds he's falling in love with
his best friend's mistress. What
do these people have in com
mon? They're all part of Man
hattan.
Woody Allen, short, bespec
tacled, balding, and one of the
two or three greatest filmmak
ers of the '70s, takes on a city
and a lifestyle in his latest
movie. Manhattan presents a
world where a woman can re
fuse to make an emotional
commitment of four weeks be
cause she's unable to plan that
far ahead. It's a world where a
successful comedy program on
television gets its laughs out of
joking about the plight of a
catatonic woman. With only
slight changes for artistic
license, this is the world of to
day.
Manhattan is Allen's most
complete work to date. It's not
inconsistent with his personal
vision that most of the comedy
is based in despair; this is a
theme that runs through all of
his films, though nowhere
dearer than here. When Isaac
Davis is complimented on his

sense of humor, he smiles and
says that he's "been making
money off it for years." With
this remark, it becomes clear
that we're dealing with a new,
self-reflective Woody Allen,
one for whom even a snappy
comeback isn't enough to
make everything all right.
The similarities between this
movie and Allen's last two,
Annie Hall and Interiors, are
striking enough that Manhat
tan can be regarded as the
completion of a '70s trilogy.
Like Annie Hall, Manhattan
boasts a wise-cracking wit that
narrowly skirts tragedy. As in
Interiors, the characters in
Manhattan are unable to de
fend themselves — even with
humor — against destructive
human relationships.
What makes Manhattan
more than simply a rehash of
earlier Allen themes is a shift in
tone. In the earlier films, it was
the characters themselves who
were messed up; however
sympathetic they might be, the
audience was distanced by an
ability to rise, a little smugly,
over the characters' problems.
But in this movie the charac
ters, for all their emotional dal
liances, are surprisingly nor
mal — this may be the most

nearly well-adjusted we've
ever seen Allen on film. The
result is that we feel Isaac
Davis' anguish even when
we're laughing at jokes.
As the title suggests, Man
hattan's characters are nearly
inseparable from their envi
ronment, and they are both
sustained and repressed by it.
At the beginning of the movie,
Isaac Davis narrates the open
ing of a book that talks more of
New York than of the main
character. It is no accident that
Manhattan begins and ends
with shots of the New York
skyline: this is the superstruc
ture that must modify all the
characters' actions.
Many of the actors Allen has
assembled to act out his comic
parable of 20th century society
are familiar ones. Diane
Keaton, present in all of Allen's
best movies, is on hand once
again. Michael Murphy, who
jilted Jill Clayburgh in An Un
married Woman, plays Davis'
adultering best friend. Meryl
Streep, the woman who waited
at home while the men went
off to play and to die in The

Deer Hunter, is Davis' ex-wife.
And Mariel Hemingway, an ac
complished young actress with
more famous relatives than sc
reen credits, portrays Davis'
under-age girlfriend.
Almost as remarkable as the
acting ensemble is Allen's mas
tery of film technique. The
filming of Annie Hall was de
lightful because it was clear
that Allen had a good time with
it, putting in every gimmick —
subtitles, superimpositions,
even animation — that he
could think of. In Interiors he
took precisely the opposite
tack, structuring each image so
tightly that the technique was as
claustrophobic as the subject
matter. Now with Manhattan,
Allen is once again fully at ease
with the medium.
Allen and cinematographer
Gordon Willis have worked to
gether to make Manhattan's
visuals a striking combination
of long takes, graceful travel
ing shots, and stunning low
key and shadowy lighting.
Manhattan is composed for the
wide-screen frame in a way that
has been virtually unmatched

since Kubrick's 2001. Where
other directors center action in
the center of the frame (many
of them cynically composing
the image so when the film is
sold to television, all the action
will be visible on the small sc
reen without tampering), Allen
composes so that important ac
tion occurs on both sides of the
huge Panavision image simul
taneously.
Manhattan is filmed in black
and white. It's sometimes easy
to forget how beautiful a
well-made blackand white film
can be. Allen and Willis have
taken great pains to see that we
remember.
If Manhattan had been the
only movie Woody Allen ever
made, his place in film history
would be secure. As it is, we as
an audience have had the op
portunity to watch an artist
grow from nightclub comic to
master filmmaker. While Man
hattan breaks down the Ameri
can Dream to its component
parts of anxiety and humor, the
success story of Woody Allen is
the American Dream.

at home while the men went
off to play and to die in The

Deer Hunter, is Davis' ex-wife.
And Mariel Hemingway, an ac
complished young actress with
more famous relatives than sc
reen credits, portrays Davis'
under-age girlfriend.
Almost as remarkable as the
acting ensemble is Allen's mas
tery of film technique. The
filming of Annie Hall was de
lightful because it was clear
that Allen had a good time with
it, putting in every gimmick —
subtitles, superimpositions,
even animation — that he
could think of. In Interiors he
took precisely the opposite
tack, structuring each image so
tightly that the technique was as
claustrophobic as the subject
matter. Now with Manhattan,
Allen is once again fully at ease
with the medium.
Allen and cinematographer
Gordon Willis have worked to
gether to make Manhattan's
visuals a striking combination
of long takes, graceful travel
ing shots, and stunning low
key and shadowy lighting.
Manhattan is composed for the
wide-screen frame in a way that
has been virtually unmatched

since Kubrick's 2001. Where
other directors center action in
the center of the frame (many
of them cynically composing
the image so when the film is
sold to television, all the action
will be visible on the small sc
reen without tampering), Allen
composes so that important ac
tion occurs on both sides of the
huge Panavision image simul
taneously.
Manhattan is filmed in black
and white. It's sometimes easy
to forget how beautiful a
well-made blackand white film
can be. Allen and Willis have
taken great pains to see that we
remember.
If Manhattan had been the
only movie Woody Allen ever
made, his place in film history
would be secure. As it is, we as
an audience have had the op
portunity to watch an artist
grow from nightclub comic to
master filmmaker. While Man
hattan breaks down the Ameri
can Dream to its component
parts of anxiety and humor, the
success story of Woody Allen is
the American Dream.

Alto Square.


Isaac Davis, a comedy writer
tor television, is 42. He was di
vorced after his wife left him
for another woman. Davis'
girlfriend is 17. And now he
finds he's falling in love with
his best friend's mistress. What
do these people have in com
mon? They're all part of Man
hattan.
Woody Allen, short, bespec
tacled, balding, and one of the
two or three greatest filmmak
ers of the '70s, takes on a city
and a lifestyle in his latest
movie. Manhattan presents a
world where a woman can re
fuse to make an emotional
commitment of four weeks be
cause she's unable to plan that
far ahead. It's a world where a
successful comedy program on
television gets its laughs out of
joking about the plight of a
catatonic woman. With only
slight changes for artistic
license, this is the world of to
day.
Manhattan is Allen's most
complete work to date. It's not
inconsistent with his personal
vision that most of the comedy
is based in despair; this is a
theme that runs through all of
his films, though nowhere
dearer than here. When Isaac
Davis is complimented on his

sense of humor, he smiles and
says that he's "been making
money off it for years." With
this remark, it becomes clear
that we're dealing with a new,
self-reflective Woody Allen,
one for whom even a snappy
comeback isn't enough to
make everything all right.
The similarities between this
movie and Allen's last two,
Annie Hall and Interiors, are
striking enough that Manhat
tan can be regarded as the
completion of a '70s trilogy.
Like Annie Hall, Manhattan
boasts a wise-cracking wit that
narrowly skirts tragedy. As in
Interiors, the characters in
Manhattan are unable to de
fend themselves — even with
humor — against destructive
human relationships.
What makes Manhattan
more than simply a rehash of
earlier Allen themes is a shift in
tone. In the earlier films, it was
the characters themselves who
were messed up; however
sympathetic they might be, the
audience was distanced by an
ability to rise, a little smugly,
over the characters' problems.
But in this movie the charac
ters, for all their emotional dal
liances, are surprisingly nor
mal — this may be the most

nearly well-adjusted we've
ever seen Allen on film. The
result is that we feel Isaac
Davis' anguish even when
we're laughing at jokes.
As the title suggests, Man
hattan's characters are nearly
inseparable from their envi
ronment, and they are both
sustained and repressed by it.
At the beginning of the movie,
Isaac Davis narrates the open
ing of a book that talks more of
New York than of the main
character. It is no accident that
Manhattan begins and ends
with shots of the New York
skyline: this is the superstruc
ture that must modify all the
characters' actions.
Many of the actors Allen has
assembled to act out his comic
parable of 20th century society
are familiar ones. Diane
Keaton, present in all of Allen's
best movies, is on hand once
again. Michael Murphy, who
jilted Jill Clayburgh in An Un
married Woman, plays Davis'
adultering best friend. Meryl
Streep, the woman who waited
at home while the men went
off to play and to die in The

Deer Hunter, is Davis' ex-wife.
And Mariel Hemingway, an ac
complished young actress with
more famous relatives than sc
