## Our leading neurotic has cured himself 
### 
Manhattan is very different
from Woody Allen's other
movies. Manhattan does
things that Woody Allen, much
less anybody else making
comedies, has not done be
fore. These things were, to
some extent, true of Interiors,
and of Annie Hall, and of every
thing else since What's Up
Tiger Lily, but in Manhattan the
differences are a little more
striking, because they are
more important.
It used to be that when you
argued with somebody about a
Woody Allen movie your
choice of disagreements was
limited. You could argue about
whether or not he was funny,
which is not really much of an
argument; after seeing In
teriors you could argue over
whether or not the tragedies
that have always been the
source of Woody Allen's
humor are as tragic as we had
suspected (it doesn't seem to
me that that is much of an ar
gument either). There are infi
nite variations on these
themes, of course, if one is in
terested in camera angles and
nihilism and the degree to
which Diane Keaton furthers
Woody Allen's ends, but gen
erally speaking, the choice of
disagreements was limited.
Logical arguments began
and ended with Woody Allen,
and with what you imagined he
thought of himself and his
movies and the world (and of
you). Woody Allen movies
until now were brilliant exer
cises in egotism before they
were anything else; all of them
were primarily concerned with
Woody Allen's continuing at
tempt to come to terms with
himself, and with his con
tradictory personality traits.
With why he hates elites, but is
attracted to them; with his
simultaneous idolization and
mistrust of intelligence; with
the ways in which everything is
important, and everything ab
surd, and nothing so important
or so absurd as Allen himself.

It's not that the obsession was
misplaced, or boring — God
knows I'd rather see Woody
Allen dissect himself than
watch Clint Eastwood or Syl
vester Stallone or any of those
others controlling both ends of
the camera do the same to
themselves — it just seems to
me that Woody Allen's movies
before Manhattan were more

therapeutic for him than they
were for us, and essentially
anemic in that sense.
But Manhattan is not like
that. In Manhattan Woody
Allen is more confident with
himself than he has ever ap
peared to be before, and much
less preoccupied with whether
or not we love him. It is a heal
thier movie than his others,

one which insists that we con
sider more than the idiosyn
cracies of the central character
(in Interiors the director was
the central character). In short,
the burden of coming to terms
with the world is on us rather
than him, and in that sense this
movie is a breakthrough.
It's like this: Diane Keaton's

newest incarnation turns to
Woody Allen's latest persona
and tells him that he is very
funny as if she is revealing it to
the world. And Woody Allen
smiles appreciatively and
non-neurotically and says
"thank you, but I don't need
you to tell me that." And earlier
(and later), when we hear the
jokes Woody Allen always
makes about the mantle borne
by someone with "incredible
sexual technique," the per
sona speaks with a confidence
suggesting that he might just
be telling the truth — more im
portantly this new tone
suggests that such things as
sexual paranoia may no longer
be at the heart of Woody Al
len's movies.
For better or worse, then
(and sometimes I miss it) we
don't have Woody to kick
around any more. You don't
leave Manhattan wondering
whether or not you "like" the
director of the picture, or
whether you should feel guilty
at having laughed at the star —
there is no suggestion, as there
always was before, that a weird
sort of psvchic umbilical cord
connects the man in charge
with every frame of his movie.
(Again, there is some reason to
mourn that loss, since this new
approach could mean an end
to the comic psychosis that
sent Howard Cosell to cover
Presidential assassinations,
locked confused time travelers
in orgasmitrons, and turned
Humphrey Bogart into a bald,
blind, schmuck.)
Manhattan is to be liked or
disliked on the basis of its
moral vision. An in-character
code of ethics rather than a
subtextual need to be laughed
at is the driving force behind it.
Woody Allen has decided to
admit that he likes himself just
fine, and move on to points
that are more complex and
quite a bit less moot.
It's not my favorite (I liked
the orgasmitron), but it surely
is his best.
