## Raunchin', rollin' with Robert Gordon in Berkeley 
### 
When The Buddy Holly Story hit the sc
reens and turntables of America this past
summer, this reviewer found it curious that
the same people that fell in love with Gary
Busey/Buddy Holly and inundated KZSU
with innumerable requests for the sound
track, had never heard the original Buddy
Holly and the Crickets.
Surely their influence on the Beatles, on
the Stones, on everybody would have impel
led people to dig up old recordings and lis
ten to the real thing just once! What kind of
Golden Oldies are radio stations playing
these days?! Tiiiimmme waaarrrrp!!!!
(The reviewer confesses to being almost
30, which may put a slant on the matter, and I
have absolutely no use for disco, which is
probably just an excuse to dance anyway.
The fine distinctions between primitive,
punk and New Wave elude me — although
get any two aficionados of the genre to
gether and they seem to be able to spend
hours disagreeing, defining and analyzing to
no avail. Still, as a friend of mine who is 21
and owns a Buddy Holly tape says, "Kids
these days just don't have a sense of . . .
history!")
So what does this have to do with Robert

Gordon (who?)? During one of my sporadic
connections with FM radio, the DJ plays
"this new song out by Robert Gordon and
Link Wray." I have no notion who this Robert
Gordon is; but Link Wray was an old rock 'n'
roll/rockabilly guitarist who did studio work
foreveryone under the sun and churned out
a couple of his own singles sometime while I
was in high school, then disappeared into
obscurity, Beatlemania and acid rock. I
thought he must be dead by now or selling
used cars in Schenectady.
The song the DJ plays proves to be a real
rocker in the classical Link Wray-Eddie Coc
hran form. This Gordon fellow, who has un
earthed Wray from God-only-knows-where,
and proceded to reconstitute a style not
heard on the airwaves in years bears looking
into.
I swore off concerts in '75, after seeing
Clapton's Great Return (off of drugs, and
back on the road solo with 461 Ocean
Boulevard) at the Providence Civic Center.
Everyone in the audience was pubescent
and seemed to think that "Layla" was the
only thing Clapton had ever done. I figured
it was easier to do without than feel old and
in the way.

Robert Gordon does a show at the Keys
tone in Berkeley last Thursday. Bob Seger
keeps saying "rock 'n' roll will never die,"
but things seem to be looking a little grim
these days, so . . . going is a must. For the
sake of posterity, and in an attempt to keep
audible and visual (as opposed to oral) his
tory going I drag along the 21-year-old
owner of the Buddy Holly tape.
While we are waiting in line to enter the
Keystone, the person in front of us, unable
to contain a certain excitement, turns
around and raves, "Like Gordon is keeping it
alive! The tradition, man! Like he's the only
one!" This quells my tear that I just might be
the only sentimental fool in the audience,
involved in some private ritual — to tap in on
tones, harmonies still echoing from our
youth. Elvis shook his pelvis and the world
was just never quite the same: Americans
proceeded to devour Beach Bums and the
British Sound as fast as they could, while
Soviet teenagers were getting busted for
underground, "revisionist" attempts to play
rockabilly.
The show opens with Cornell Hurd (and
the Mondo Hot Pants) Band. Local. Call

them the Bad Boys from San Jose — a synth
esis of early J. Ceils and Charlie Daniels
(what do you expect from a city that used to
nurture greasers and cowboys?). Where they
got enough black chinos to outfit the entire
band, I'll never know. They have a harp
player that is right in there with Paul Butter
field and Corky Siegel (Siegel-Schwall Blues
Band, now defunct, out of Chicago).
Between acts there's taped Buddy Holly,
Presley, Everley Brothers. Everyone is either
singing, humming or tapping along: well
drilled, primed and expectant. Not really
there to see Robert Gordon either (who is
too much the transmitter, coalescence of a
slew of cult-heroes to ever quite become
one himself) but for the music he was going
to play. Invocation to Buddy Holly, et al.
Cordon finally came out, in a pompadour
and leopard-skin jacket with a greasy
haired, black-shirted band in tow, and
everyone stepped back into the past.
Cod knows what they played, for how
long they played. People screamed them
selves hoarse, stomped, danced, mouthed
words so familiar that they bypass the brain
and go somewhere else, maybe the feet,
maybe the heart. Perfectly executed riffs that

you've longed to hear live. And when was
the last time a band had a string bass
player?
The audience would have torn the place
apart if they hadn't returned for two en
cores. The End.
And having yelled and stomped with the
best of them, meanwhile trying to re
member that I'm the reviewer, and I'm not
even "taking notes;" thoughts of William
Blake's "Energy is eternal delight;" a certain
barrel-assing through innocence (almost as
good as "I Want to Hold Your Hand"); and
looking at the audience, at myself, at Cor
don and crew, and wondering what would
indeed happen if rock 'n' roll died, all I could
say was, "How can you review a concert like
that?"
I'm still wondering.
Gordon and friends are great. It's nice to
know your roots, and it's great rock-out,
kick-ass rockabilly.
Besides, as a friend of mine who has
reached the late, great age of 20, related to
me the other day: he was talking to a 14-
year-old and the subject of the Beatles came
up. As the little kid said, "weren't they the
group McCartney was with before Wings?"
