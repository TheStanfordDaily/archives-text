# lively arts/lael stone
## Spring promotion kicks off 
### 
What do daisies, balloons, samba music,
songs from Annie, jazz and frisbees have in
common? All are free from the Lively Arts at
Stanford during their spring noon concerts start
ing today and continuing through Thursday.
Each day will feature a different performing
group.
The Lively Arts is best known for the series of
fine classical music, jazz, drama and dance
events that the department brings to Stanford
during the school year and its Midsummer
Mozart and Fourth of July jazz celebration held
during the summer. This week's programs offer
a taste of Lively Arts' interests.
Today's entertainment will consist of a selec
tion of songs from musicals performed by
members of Ram's Head. Not only will songs
from past shows and Caieties be included, but
also some tunes from Pippin, Annie, and
Applause.
Wednesday will feature a performance by the
Brazilian group Corpo Santo, an eight-piece
band now touring the U.S. This group's mem
bers also include national and regional champ
ions in the sport/martial art of Capoeira. Corpo
Santo played at the Grand Carnival Ball this year

in the Galeria and they will be performing at the
Bechtel International Center's Carnival May 18.
Th ursday the ever popular Stanford Jazz Band
will close out the series of concerts.
Although the Lively Arts' audience is at least 30
percent students, even more for jazz and dance
concerts, they want to increase student in
volvement in their programs.
Last year's spring noon concerts were or
ganized by the Lively Arts staff in conjunction
with students. The events for this year have
been organized by their one-year-old student
committee. This committee also helps with artist
hosting, community and dorm outreach offer
ing students a unique opportunity for interac
tion with performing artists, a glimpse at arts
management and student input into an impor
tant University service.
Diversity in interests and experience will be a
key in the selection process as continuing com
mittee members will interview applicants for
next year's 15-member group, Interested per
sons can pick up a short application form to
bring to the interview at the table on Tresidder
patio during the concerts this week or at the
Office of Public Events.
