## Unpretentious frivolity 
### 
And what is wrong with a
frivolous play? Nothing at all
when it is well written, well di
rected, and well acted. The
American Conservatory
Theatre's production of Hotel
Paradiso refreshes with its
light, fast-paced action and
clever dialogue.The George
Feydeau/Maurice Desvallieres
farce never poses as meaning
ful drama ahd its unpretenti
ous vivacity is infectious.
The action begins when Cot,
a portly "whiskered ice-berg"
ignores his mincing wife, Mar
celle, once too often. Their
neighbor, Boniface, with delu
sions of Gallic manhood, con
vinces the distraught woman to
rendezvous with him over the
weekend when their spouses
will be gone. Madame
Boniface, a suspicious battle

axe of a woman, locks her hus
band up when she leaves to
visit her sister but he escapes
out the window via a rope lad
der.
Seedy
Boniface takes Marcelle to
the seedy Hotel Paradiso; "re
commended for those married
togetherorseparately." Due to
a series of bizarre coinci
dences, their illicit affair fails to
evolve into anything more than
an idea. Soon Boniface and
Marcelle are only concerned
with escaping the Hotel
Paradiso without being spotted
by acquaintances. The chaos
that ensues reminds one of
Marx Brothers chase scenes.
Larry Delinger's cheery,
tinny music, while at first seem
ing out of place in a theater,
suits the three rine circus at the

Hotel Paradiso. Tom Moore di
rects the play as a circus —
carefree, colorful, and surpris
ing. He choreographs the rapid
entrances and exits with split
second timing. Although his
dancing chorus of porters are
justfoo cute, the graceful, easy
movement of the production
bespeaks tight discipline.
Cast
His cast, particularly Raye
Birk as the enterprising
Boniface and Elizabeth Huddle
as the secretly sharp-edged
Marcelle, reveal fine comic
sensibilities in both voice and
manner. Sydney Walker, as the
aged innocent, Martin who
stutters in ill-weather, provides
many laughs with the indecent
implications of his stuttering.
Bruce Williams' Georges, a
country bumpkin working at
the Hotel Paradiso, would be
delightful if one did not sus
pect that his character bor
rowed heavily from Robin Wil
liams' Mork.
The characters frolic on
Richard Segar's sets: the
Boniface salon and the Hotel
Paradiso. The Boniface salon,
also a builder's room, is a sim
ple, clean, bright set that con
trasts nicely with the dark,
shadowy Hotel Paradiso. The
huge Hotel set, nevertheless,
is easily the more attractive,
with its gleaming wood ven
eers, long staircase, and elabo
rate decor.
Robert Blackman's costumes
serve well in these settings.
Like the salon, the costumes
are in shades of browns, pinks,
and greens. The would-be lov
ers dress in pink shades as ab
surd and ineffective as their at
tempted affair. Madame
Boniface's voluminous gown
and hat are extreme but add to
her imposing presence.
The addition of Richard De
vin's lighting design, particu
larly in the Hotel Paradiso,
rounds out the well executed
production. True, Hotel
Paradiso will not change one's
life, but frivolity is rarely bet
ter.


Michael Winters, Raye Birk and Elizabeth Huddle romp through a
scene of ACT's "Hotel Paradiso" now in repertory through June at
the Geary theater.
