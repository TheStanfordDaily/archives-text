## Rundgren: what inadequacies? 
### 
Ever since I heard thatTodd Rundgren
once ruined a guitar given to him by Eric
Clapton, I always wanted to do a review
which would expose his inadequacies.
Naturally, I was excited to review
Rundgren's concert at the Old Waldorf
on Sunday.
There turned out to be only one prob
lem: Rundgren has very few in
adequacies. In fact, from the very tirst
song of his set, it was apparent that my
dreams of revenge had been foiled.
Rundgren, with the original Utopia
band behind him, opened with "Trap
ped" from the Oops, Wrong Planet
album and followed quickly with two
more tracks from the same album,
"Love in Action" and "Abandon City."
All three songs were well played and
keyboardist Roger Powell displayed the
first two of several outstanding solos
that most of those attending would re
member for some time after the con
cert.
The entire show was dominated,
naturally, by Utopia tunes. But that was
just fine with all concerned because
songs like "Initiation," "All We Need"
and "Gangrene" were unquestionably
some of the best moments of the show.
"Initiation," in particular, brought a

number of fans to their feet, as each
member of the band took their turn in
delivering a frenzied solo composition.
One of the trademarks of the band is
their amazing versatility. Rundgren,
whose lead guitar work was very strong
throughout the show, displayed com
petent piano-playing ability on "Can We
Still Be Friends." In addition, his drum
ming on "Gangrene" showed his talent
on that instrument.
New release
The set also featured two songs from
the group's soon-to-be-released album
Adventures in Utopia. "Shot in the
Dark," though a pretty good rock
melody, is not as impressive as "Last of
the New Wave Riders," which
prophesies that the aforementioned
Riders will be the "first of the new age
masters." Not only are the words of the
song dynamic, but the grinding rhythm
proves that Rundgren is well in touch
with current influences and under
stands how to garner the best aspects of
New Wave incorporating them into his
own music.
After the regular set was concluded, a
standing, screaming crowd brought the
band back for an encore that might be
described as a religious experience. The

opening strains of "Hello, It's Me" were
met with instant approval from the
crowd, and Rundgren didn't let them
down. His voice, which occasionally
went soft during the set when it strained
on the edge of his falsetto, soared all
over the scale during the encore. "Just
One Victory" came immediately after
"Hello" and the crowd redoubled its
appreciation.
Stopping short
If anything about the show could be
criticized, it could be that Rundgren's
solos, if anything, were often cut short
unnecessarily. Here and there, he
would break into what portended an in
credible riff, only to stop short. Only in
a couple of songs during the set, and in
both encores, did he really let his abun
dant creativity flow out of his guitar in
extended solos.
After the show, I wondered why it was
that Rundgren chooses to play a string
of dates in a small club when he could
certainly sell out a larger auditorium.
But then, maybe the fact that he
chooses the more intimate club atmos
phere means something. The band is a
tight, well-rehearsed unit that puts on
an exciting, professional show.
And maybe that's what it's all about.
