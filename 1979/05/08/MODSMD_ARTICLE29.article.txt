Vou probably have never
heard of the Hollywood Fats
Band but if their first album
sells as well as the album is
good it won't be long before
you do.
The band plays the blues.
Nothing but the real thing â€”
driving, ol' fashoned, '30s
blues. The only difference here
is the instruments are a little
more modern which makes for
a perfect combination of the
older style of the '30s and '40s
blues with a contemporary ex
tension.
This distinctive sound is
produced by contemporary ar
tists who have played with the
old masters. Hollywood Fats,
the guitarist and leader of the
band, has played with the likes
of Muddy Waters, Albert King,
John Lee Hooker, and Jimmy
Witherspoon.
Innes
Richard Innes, drummer in
the group, has played with
Jimmy Reed, T-Bone Walker,
Lightnin' Hopkins, and others.
The rest of the band, also with
such notable credits but too
long to list, are Fred Kaplan at
piano, Al Blake, who handles
the vocals and harmonica
duties, and Larry Taylor, who
played bass with Canned Heat
before joinihg the "Fats" band.
The group is very together in

all that they do and the sound
they produce makes it sound
as if they had been working to
gether for a very long time.
This is especially noteworthy
since few of the songs sound
anything alike. They play a var
iety of blues and do them all
well. For example, on "Rock
This House" the tempo is
speeded up and the song has
overtones of rock while main
taining its blues quality.
On the song "Okie Dokie
Stomp" Fats is in total com
mand all the way. The song is
perfect as a showcase for the
guitarists. His solo is a warm,
fluent effort that captures the
listeners' attention from bar
one. All throughout the album
Fats keeps the group together
and keeps the music cooking.
Kaplan
But it is when Kaplan and
Blake are at their best that the
album as a whole is at its best.
Kaplan, especially, is the one
that adds the contemporary ex
tension to the group. His mod
ern blues piano playing is
especially effective when he is
let loose to improvise. Often
he and Fats play a call and re
sponse and they are some of
the brightest moments on the
album.
Blake also adds a great deal
when he is playing his best.
Blake, on the album's best
songs, "She's Dynamite,"
"Okie Dokie Stomp," "Suit

case Blues," and "Caldonia"
lets loose with his harmonica
playing. Also, on these songs,
his singing is a bit more raspy
and more blues-like than on
other songs. When he does
sing this way he has a pretty
good voice, but if a complaint
were to be staged it would be
here. All too often both his
voice and harp playing were
uninspired and added little to
the group.
Thus far, the record has not

sold like fire, according to one
of the band's representatives.
Distribution has been small
thus far and you'll probably
have a hard time finding the
album in most record stores.
However, if this album is any
indication of what can be ex
pected from this group in the
future then the Hollywood Fats
Band is going to have a lot to
say and, to be sure, there will
be a lot of people listening.
