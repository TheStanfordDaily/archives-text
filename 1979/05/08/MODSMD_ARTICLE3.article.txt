## SCIR approves limits on Ford, Exxon 
### Mike Charlson 
The Board of Trustees yesterday continued its
trend of supporting shareholder proposals calling
for nonexpansion of corporate activity in South
Africa.
The latest action came at a meeting of the trus
tees' Select Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (SCIR) which voted to support proposals
limiting corporate activity in South Africa by Ford
Motor Company and Exxon Corp.
In other action, the Committee on Investments
tabled a plan to lend up to $1.5 million annually to
eligible faculty and staff here for second
mortgages to aid them in securing new housing
near the University.
In the proxy action, the trustees unanimously
accepted the recommendation of the University's
Committee on Investment Responsibility (CIR) to
support a shareholder resolution calling for Ford
to end sales to the South African police and milit
ary.
The SCIR also voted to support a proposal di
recting Exxon not to expand its activities, primarily
oil and mining operations, in South Africa.
The SCIR also agreed with the CIR in not sup

porting a Superior Oil proposal to limit expansion
of mining operations in Chile. SCIR members ag
reed with the CIR analysis that, while Chile is an
oppressive nation, there was not sufficient evi
dence to implicate Superior Oil in the furthering
of that oppression.
The Off-Campus Home Financing Program
which was tabled would have loaned five-year re
newable notes to up to 60 full-time faculty or
senior staff members with which they could make
down payments on homes within a 20-mile radius
of the University.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the president for
trustee affairs, said the proposal had been tabled
until the )une board meeting, but his office had no
details on the board's action.
Some administration officials considered the
program important to the University's junior fa
culty recruitment program.
Robert Summers, manager of faculty-staff hous
ing, said the Bay Area is one of the most expensive
areas in the nation for housing and this fact has
"definitely been a problem" when trying to attract
new faculty members.
Some trustees, however, wanted a "more com
prehensive overview" of the faculty housing prog

ram before acting on the off-campus housing
proposal, according to Robert Beyers, director of
the University News Service. Beyers said he was
quoting Director of Finance Rodney Adams.
Under the proposal, the first-mortgage financ
ing of 75 percent of the cost of the home would
have to be secured through either Crocker Bank or
Bank of America, Summers said. Those banks have
agreed to allow a second mortgage from the
purchase time, Summers said.
The University would then lend the employee
up to an additional 15 percent of the home cost,
meaning the employee could have 90 percent
financing.
The interest rate on the University loan would
be the same as that given by the bank, except the
University is limited to a 10 percent maximum rate.
Presently, bank mortgage loans are sold at a 10 3 A
percent rate.
Money for the loans would come from endow
ment pools and would be treated as an invest
ment.
At today's meeting, the board is expected to
hear reports on the amount of outstanding debt
owed by the University and a report on the long
term facilities plan and capital forecast.
