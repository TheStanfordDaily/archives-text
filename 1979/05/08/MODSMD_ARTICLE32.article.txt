# 3-Mile Isle technician says NRC saw accident
## 
### 
By The Associated Press
A Three Mile Island technician
told visiting Congressmen yester
day that inspectors from the Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission
knew about the accident at the
Middletown, Pa., nuclear power
plant two days before the NRC
claims to have been notified of it.
The disclosure came on the
same day that President Jimmy
Carter told opponents of nuclear
power that an immediate shut
down of the nation's nuclear
plants is "out of the question."
Also, the latest Associated
Press-NBC News poll revealed
yesterday that most Americans
support stopping construction of
nuclear plants until safety ques
tions are resolved,, but not shut
ting down operating plants.
In Middletown, an energy sub
committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives visited the Three
Mile Island plant, which was seri
ously damaged by a series of mis
takes and equipment problems in
late March that led to the release
of small amounts of radioactivity.
Control Room supervisor Jim
Floyd told stunned members of
the subcommittee that NRC in
spectors were standing by as the
tracing needle on a reactor pres
sure monitoring gauge leaped.
That so-called "pressure
spike," caused by a hydrogen exp
losion and showing that the reac
tor fuel itself had been damaged,
was recorded at 10:58 p.m. PST
Wednesday, March 28 — about 10
hours after the beginning of the
nation's most serious nuclear ac
cident.
The NRC has claimed it was not
aware of the hydrogen explosion
until Friday, March 30, when it was
formally reported by Metropoli
tan Edison, the company that op
erates the reactor. Company offi
cials have said the significance of
the event was not realized until
then.
But Floyd said the hydrogen
explosion was clearly monitored
by the control room instruments
— in full view of both plant
operators and the NRC inspec
tors, whom he did not identify.
In Washington, NRC spokes
man Frank Ingram said existing
regulations may require plant
operators and federal inspectors
to report safety incidents to NRC
officials, "depending on the cir
cumstances."
Meanwhile, in Washington,

Carter conferred with the coor
dinators of Sunday's Washington
anti-nuclear demonstration, the
largest such protest held in the
United States. The president was
urged to close some plants now,
phase out others and halt the
opening of new nuclear plants.
In addition, one of the de
monstration's leaders, Donald
Ross, said he told Carter at the
White House meeting that it was
time for the president to replace
his pro-nuclear advisers, among
them Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger, with officials who are
opposed to nuclear development.
Also yesterday, consumer ad
vocate Ralph Nader said plans for
protecting the public during nuc
lear accidents "have no credibil
ity" and provide only "an illusion
of protection." In testimony be
fore a House Government Opera
tions subcommittee, Nader also
called for the ouster of members
of the Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission because of their handling
of the crisis.
An Associated Press-NBC News
telephone survey has found that
public support for a moratorium
on nuclear plant construction has
jumped in the wake of the acci
dent at Three Mile Island.
After this accident, 65 percent
of those interviewed April 30 and
May 1 said they agree that "No
more nuclear power plants
should be built in this country. . .
until questions about safety are
resolved, even though some say
this will mean energy shortages
within 10 years."
Support for such a moratorium
is up 12 points from the findings of
the AP-NBC News poll last Sep
tember.
In the most recent survey, 29
percent opposed such a
moratorium and 6 percent of the
1600 adults interviewed nation
wide were not sure.
Despite the public's increased
concern about safety, Americans
are generally still not willing to
support shutting down all nuclear
power plants.
More than half — 51 percent —
answered "No" when asked,
"Should all nuclear power plants
be closed down until questions
about safety are answered?"
Forty-three percent supported
a shutdown order. Six percent
again were not sure.

protecting the public during nuc

An Associated Press-NBC News
telephone survey has found that
public support for a moratorium
on nuclear plant construction has
jumped in the wake of the acci
dent at Three Mile Island.
After this accident, 65 percent
of those interviewed April 30 and
May 1 said they agree that "No
more nuclear power plants
should be built in this country. . .
until questions about safety are
resolved, even though some say
this will mean energy shortages
within 10 years."
Support for such a moratorium
is up 12 points from the findings of
the AP-NBC News poll last Sep
tember.
In the most recent survey, 29
percent opposed such a
moratorium and 6 percent of the
1600 adults interviewed nation
wide were not sure.
Despite the public's increased
concern about safety, Americans
are generally still not willing to
support shutting down all nuclear
power plants.
More than half — 51 percent —
answered "No" when asked,
"Should all nuclear power plants
be closed down until questions
about safety are answered?"
Forty-three percent supported
a shutdown order. Six percent
again were not sure.
By The Associated Press
A Three Mile Island technician
told visiting Congressmen yester
day that inspectors from the Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission
knew about the accident at the
Middletown, Pa., nuclear power
plant two days before the NRC
claims to have been notified of it.
The disclosure came on the
same day that President Jimmy
Carter told opponents of nuclear
power that an immediate shut
down of the nation's nuclear
plants is "out of the question."
Also, the latest Associated
Press-NBC News poll revealed
yesterday that most Americans
support stopping construction of
nuclear plants until safety ques
tions are resolved,, but not shut
ting down operating plants.
In Middletown, an energy sub
committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives visited the Three
Mile Island plant, which was seri
ously damaged by a series of mis
takes and equipment problems in
late March that led to the release
of small amounts of radioactivity.
Control Room supervisor Jim
Floyd told stunned members of
the subcommittee that NRC in
spectors were standing by as the
tracing needle on a reactor pres
sure monitoring gauge leaped.
That so-called "pressure
spike," caused by a hydrogen exp
losion and showing that the reac
tor fuel itself had been damaged,
was recorded at 10:58 p.m. PST
Wednesday, March 28 — about 10
hours after the beginning of the
nation's most serious nuclear ac
cident.
The NRC has claimed it was not
aware of the hydrogen explosion
until Friday, March 30, when it was
formally reported by Metropoli
tan Edison, the company that op
erates the reactor. Company offi
cials have said the significance of
the event was not realized until
then.
But Floyd said the hydrogen
explosion was clearly monitored
by the control room instruments
— in full view of both plant
operators and the NRC inspec
tors, whom he did not identify.
In Washington, NRC spokes
man Frank Ingram said existing
regulations may require plant
operators and federal inspectors
to report safety incidents to NRC
officials, "depending on the cir
cumstances."
Meanwhile, in Washington,

Carter conferred with the coor
dinators of Sunday's Washington
anti-nuclear demonstration, the
largest such protest held in the
United States. The president was
urged to close some plants now,
phase out others and halt the
opening of new nuclear plants.
In addition, one of the de
monstration's leaders, Donald
Ross, said he told Carter at the
White House meeting that it was
time for the president to replace
his pro-nuclear advisers, among
them Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger, with officials who are
opposed to nuclear development.
