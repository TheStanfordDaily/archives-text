Israeli planes strike in Lebanon
Jerusalem — Israeli warplanes struck Palestinian
targets in Lebanon for a second straight day yes
terday and Prime Minister Menachem Begin in
vited the Lebanese to negotiate peace. But he
vowed continued attacks on "terrorists who spill
the innocent blood of men, women and children."
Lebanon angrily rejected the suggestion of
talks.
"Begin's offer is blackmail," Lebanese Premier
Salim el Hoss said in Beirut. "The offer is a man
euver to camouflage Israel's attacks against inno
cents in Lebanon. In the name of peace, Israel
commits all these crimes in Lebanon."
Hours after the Israeli raid a small bomb
exploded outside a supermarket in the town of
Petah Tikva, east of Tel Aviv. A police spokesman
said no one was injured and the only damage was
to a parked car.
In the northern Lebanese village of Mohmara,
meanwhile, townspeople buried the six victims of
Sunday's Israeli air strike.
Yesterday's air raid, in which no casualties were
reported, was made on a Palestinian guerrilla-held
area 11 miles inside Lebanon.
President alters rationing plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter modified
his standby gasoline rationing proposal yesterday
in a move that congressional leaders said im
proved chances for passage this week.
The proposals would, in the event rationing is
imposed, give relatively more gasoline to "hard
ship cases" and to drivers in states where each
auto uses more gasoline than the national average.
These include Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi,
South Carolina and the District of Columbia,
among others.
Less gasoline per car would go to households
with four or more automobiles and to drivers in
states where vehicles average less gasoline con-

sumption than nationally.
These include North Dakota, Montana, Rhode
Island, Hawaii, Pennsylvania and California.
It surprised some that California would lose if
allocation was based on consumption figures.
However, Department of Energy figures show that
California vehicles average only about 93 percent
of the national average consumption per vehicle.
One explanation offered was that Californians
own more cars per household than the national
average, which would lower the gasoline con
sumption per automobile.
Gas dealers agree on shutdown
St. Louis — Service station operators from across
the country agreed yesterday to urge a nationwide
shutdown of stations later this month to protest
government controls on retail profits on gasoline.
A hastily assembled group of representatives of
operators' associations voted unanimously to re
commend a shutdown of stations May 17 to 20 to
protest the controls.
About 40 people representing 30 state associa
tions said they would return to their areas and ask
their fellow station operators to participate in the
shutdown.
Jim Campbell, executive director of the Califor
nia Service Station Association, said the group has
demanded a response from the Energy Depart
ment by this Friday.
Dealers make an average 10.47 cents per gallon
sold, and want to be allowed to mark up the price
at least two cents more than that.
The operators argued that the government regu
lations forcing them to limit their profits to 1974
levels is unfair in view of increasing costs of opera
tion.
Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Brock
Adams predicted yesterday that the lines appear
ing now at California gas stations would spread
throughout the nation in the next few months.

Psychiatrist testifies for White
San Francisco — A psychiatrist, saying Dan White
suffers from "a major mood disturbance," tes
tified yesterday the former supervisor was unable
to tell right from wrong when he shot and killed
the mayor and a supervisor.
Testifying at White's murder trial, Dr. Jerry Jones
of Stockton said White "had the capacity to intend
to kill but he did not have the capacity to hold the
notion in his mind that he was not supposed to do
that."
White is charged with first-degree murder in the
City Hall slayings of Mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk.
Jones, who said he met four times with the de
fendant in White's jail cell for a total of more than
11 hours, depicted .White as a man under tre
mendous stress for weeks prior to the killings.
Under cross examination by prosecutor Tom
Norman, the psychiatrist conceded that he did not
look at White's school and military records.
Stocks drop sharply
New York — The stock market took its sharpest
drop in 2Vi months yesterday in selling blamed on
rising interest rates and concern over the outlook
for gasoline supplies.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
had declined 10.05 points last Friday, dropped
another 14.12 to 833.42. Yesterday's decline was
the average's biggest since it fell the same amount
on Feb. 27.
Big Board volume totaled 30.48 million shares,
against 30.63 million the day before.
Today's weather
Showers or thundershowers likely today. Clear
ing tonight. Mostly fair and warmer tomorrow.
Lows in the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the upper
50s and 60s today and in the 60s to mid 70s tomor
row. Chance of showers 60 percent today.

own more cars per household than the national
average, which would lower the gasoline con
sumption per automobile.
Gas dealers agree on shutdown
St. Louis — Service station operators from across
the country agreed yesterday to urge a nationwide
shutdown of stations later this month to protest
government controls on retail profits on gasoline.
A hastily assembled group of representatives of
operators' associations voted unanimously to re
commend a shutdown of stations May 17 to 20 to
protest the controls.
About 40 people representing 30 state associa
tions said they would return to their areas and ask
their fellow station operators to participate in the
shutdown.
Jim Campbell, executive director of the Califor
nia Service Station Association, said the group has
demanded a response from the Energy Depart
ment by this Friday.
Dealers make an average 10.47 cents per gallon
sold, and want to be allowed to mark up the price
at least two cents more than that.
The operators argued that the government regu
lations forcing them to limit their profits to 1974
levels is unfair in view of increasing costs of opera
tion.
Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Brock
Adams predicted yesterday that the lines appear
ing now at California gas stations would spread
throughout the nation in the next few months.

Psychiatrist testifies for White
San Francisco — A psychiatrist, saying Dan White
suffers from "a major mood disturbance," tes
tified yesterday the former supervisor was unable
to tell right from wrong when he shot and killed
the mayor and a supervisor.
Testifying at White's murder trial, Dr. Jerry Jones
of Stockton said White "had the capacity to intend
to kill but he did not have the capacity to hold the
notion in his mind that he was not supposed to do
that."
White is charged with first-degree murder in the
City Hall slayings of Mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk.
Jones, who said he met four times with the de
fendant in White's jail cell for a total of more than
11 hours, depicted .White as a man under tre
mendous stress for weeks prior to the killings.
Under cross examination by prosecutor Tom
Norman, the psychiatrist conceded that he did not
look at White's school and military records.

Israeli planes strike in Lebanon
Jerusalem — Israeli warplanes struck Palestinian
targets in Lebanon for a second straight day yes
terday and Prime Minister Menachem Begin in
vited the Lebanese to negotiate peace. But he
vowed continued attacks on "terrorists who spill
the innocent blood of men, women and children."
Lebanon angrily rejected the suggestion of
talks.
"Begin's offer is blackmail," Lebanese Premier
Salim el Hoss said in Beirut. "The offer is a man
euver to camouflage Israel's attacks against inno
cents in Lebanon. In the name of peace, Israel
commits all these crimes in Lebanon."
Hours after the Israeli raid a small bomb
exploded outside a supermarket in the town of
Petah Tikva, east of Tel Aviv. A police spokesman
said no one was injured and the only damage was
to a parked car.
In the northern Lebanese village of Mohmara,
meanwhile, townspeople buried the six victims of
Sunday's Israeli air strike.
Yesterday's air raid, in which no casualties were
reported, was made on a Palestinian guerrilla-held
area 11 miles inside Lebanon.
President alters rationing plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter modified
his standby gasoline rationing proposal yesterday
in a move that congressional leaders said im
proved chances for passage this week.
The proposals would, in the event rationing is
imposed, give relatively more gasoline to "hard
ship cases" and to drivers in states where each
auto uses more gasoline than the national average.
These include Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi,
South Carolina and the District of Columbia,
among others.
Less gasoline per car would go to households
with four or more automobiles and to drivers in
states where vehicles average less gasoline con-

sumption than nationally.
These include North Dakota, Montana, Rhode
Island, Hawaii, Pennsylvania and California.
It surprised some that California would lose if
allocation was based on consumption figures.
However, Department of Energy figures show that
California vehicles average only about 93 percent
of the national average consumption per vehicle.
One explanation offered was that Californians
own more cars per household than the national
average, which would lower the gasoline con
sumption per automobile.
