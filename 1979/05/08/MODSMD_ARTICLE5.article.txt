# Gays fight 'normal' outlook of society
## 
### Marilyn Rosenberg 
Gays "have been bred with words
of freedom but immersed in bigotry
and oppression," said Lonnie
Nungesser yesterday in a speech at a
noon rally in White Plaza, kicking off
Gay Awareness Week.
Speaking before over 100 people
scattered from the Bookstore to Tre
sidder, Nungesser explained that the
purpose of Gay Awareness Week was
"to free men and women from bon
dage in sex roles." He complained
that the family, the church, the state
and the school operate on a "nor
mal" point of view, which values
conformity and compliance over in
dividuality.
Rejecting the common notion that
homosexuals aim ' to make
heterosexuals uncomfortable,
Nungesser insisted that homosexu
als try to make heterosexuals more
comfortable in sharing "the treasure
of their sexuality."
The featured speaker at the rally
was Priscilla Alexander, a member of
the San Francisco Lesbian Caucus
and the National Task Force on Pros
titution.
Alexander's speech addressed the
close relation between women's
rights and homosexual freedom. Ac
cusing American society of being
based on hatred for women, she
cited, among other examples, the
adulation of all women not rep
resented as virginal, the cutoff of
abortion funding and the presence

of "a national crusade" against pros
titutes.
Alexander went on to discuss the
ERA, without which, she said, the
gains women have made are jeopar
dized and lesbian rights will almost
certainly not be secured. She
pointed out the high correlation be
tween those states that have passed
the ERA and those that have sup
ported gay rights.
"Given the obvious relation bet
ween society's treatment of women
and homosexuals," she concluded,
"one would think they (male
homosexuals) would embrace the
feminist cause. But to the extent gay
men deny lesbians power in the gay
rights movement, they make it im
possible to work with them."
After the rally, GPU President
Cameron Smith said, "I don't think
that's the case at Stanford. Although
men outnumber women at GPU
meetings, we try hard to work to
gether. I think we worked well to
gether in planning Awareness
Week."
A slightly different picture was
given by a female GPU member who
feels that "the Women's Collective
of the GPU is unable to attract any
number of women on a regular
basis." Like Alexander, she believes
that "If people understood the over
lapping goals of gay rights and the
women's movement, there'd be
more cooperation."
The 30 people present at an after
noon panel discussion in Meyer
Forum Room on Cay Life at Stanford
dealt with the more immediate issues
of the gay experience here.
Dormitory life was depicted as in
tolerant to homosexuals, one par
ticipant calling it "high-schoolish."
Another woman described relation
shipswith men in herdormas "disas
trous." Both, however, eventually
established homosexual relation
ships with people in their dorms,
they said.
On the subject of the GPU, people
displayed mixed reactions. One
woman claimed that, as a freshman,
"I thought of myself as a lesbian, but
not as one of them." Another de-

Participants also appeared disap
pointed with tenured professors
who, although they "had nothing to
lose," still refused to come out. "It's
frustrating," says Smith. "I wish we
had more faculty support."
Many students told of problems
they encountered during a discus
sion of whether or not to "come
out." One described Stanford as
"the most closeted and terrifying
place I have ever been around."
Most of all, however, participants
seemed to resent having to deal with
"the closet." One man explains that,
"being a gay person, I am a
stereotype, and being defined by
sexuality is frightening.
Although agreeing with this,

others were strongly in favor of com
ing out. One woman recalled the im
portance of lesbian role models
when she herself was acknovledging
her sexuality.-
Smith concurred, saying that "Just
the fact that we're one of 10 makes
coming out important ... so that
someone doesn't have to walk all the
way to the GPU."

Gays "have been bred with words
of freedom but immersed in bigotry
and oppression," said Lonnie
Nungesser yesterday in a speech at a
noon rally in White Plaza, kicking off
Gay Awareness Week.
Speaking before over 100 people
scattered from the Bookstore to Tre
sidder, Nungesser explained that the
purpose of Gay Awareness Week was
"to free men and women from bon
dage in sex roles." He complained
that the family, the church, the state
and the school operate on a "nor
mal" point of view, which values
conformity and compliance over in
dividuality.
Rejecting the common notion that
homosexuals aim ' to make
heterosexuals uncomfortable,
Nungesser insisted that homosexu
als try to make heterosexuals more
comfortable in sharing "the treasure
of their sexuality."
The featured speaker at the rally
was Priscilla Alexander, a member of
the San Francisco Lesbian Caucus
and the National Task Force on Pros
titution.
Alexander's speech addressed the
close relation between women's
rights and homosexual freedom. Ac
cusing American society of being
based on hatred for women, she
cited, among other examples, the
adulation of all women not rep
resented as virginal, the cutoff of
abortion funding and the presence

of "a national crusade" against pros
titutes.
Alexander went on to discuss the
ERA, without which, she said, the
gains women have made are jeopar
dized and lesbian rights will almost
certainly not be secured. She
pointed out the high correlation be
tween those states that have passed
the ERA and those that have sup
ported gay rights.
"Given the obvious relation bet
ween society's treatment of women
and homosexuals," she concluded,
"one would think they (male
homosexuals) would embrace the
feminist cause. But to the extent gay
men deny lesbians power in the gay
rights movement, they make it im
possible to work with them."
After the rally, GPU President
Cameron Smith said, "I don't think
that's the case at Stanford. Although
men outnumber women at GPU
meetings, we try hard to work to
gether. I think we worked well to
gether in planning Awareness
Week."
A slightly different picture was
given by a female GPU member who
feels that "the Women's Collective
of the GPU is unable to attract any
number of women on a regular
basis." Like Alexander, she believes
that "If people understood the over
lapping goals of gay rights and the
women's movement, there'd be
more cooperation."
