# Nudists get hearing
## 
### Katherine Brown 
In response to "increasing num
bers" of public requests, eight sites
for "clothing optional" beaches —
including one within an hourofStan
ford — have recently been proposed
by the California Department of
Parks and Recreation.
The department will decide some
time this week whether the eight
sites, including Pomponio State
Beach in San Mateo County, about
an hour's drive west of campus, will
be opened to nude bathers or not.
A series of three public meetings
were held over the past two weeks in
Los Angeles, Sacramento and San
Francisco to elicit public opinion on
the controversial issue. In Los
Angeles, opposition to the proposed
site at Pirate's Cove was varied.
Some expressed a distaste for the
sexual exhibitions, masturbation and
voyeurism they claim the nudists
who are now going to the beach il
legally indulge in.
Russell Cahill, director of the Parks
and Recreation Department was in
charge of the public sessions. He
noted that sentiments were fairly
evenly divided.
Governor Jerry Brown has re
peatedly described the clothing op
tional beaches as "inappropriate."
Students here seemed to be more
in favor of the proposal than those

who showed up at the official hear
ings.
In response to the question, "Is
nude sunbathing morally acceptable
to you?" students answered:
"Yes. There's nothing intrinsically
wrong with it, I'm just shy."
"Yes! Who needs government
regulation?"
"Yes — if it's controlled."
"No, it's not necessary to enjoying
the sun — it promotes eroticism."
"Yes, if Cod had wanted us to be
covered, He'd have given us feath
ers, right?"
A perceptive comment on the so
cial fears came from a student who
said, "Nude sunbathing is one of
life's little pleasures. It need not be
equated with having sex in public (or
anywhere else). Public lovemaking
should be restricted — nude bathing
should not be banned."
The problem lies with the people
who view public sexand nudesunba
thing as one and the same issue, the
student said.
One particularly animated propo
nent said that "Nude beaches are
beneficial for children and other liv
ing things." His response to the
question on the morality of bathing
in the nude was: "Yes — Get rid of
the stodgy, Orange County moral
ity!"
