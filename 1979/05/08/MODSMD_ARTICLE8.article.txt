# Talk with Engle, Pleis
## 49ers get free agent Ceresino 
### Ivan Maisel 
Cardinal linebacker Gordy Ceresino signed a free
agent contract with the San Francisco 49ers yesterday
after being passed up in all 12 rounds of last week's
pro draft, according to Brian Billick, associate direc
tor of public relations for the 49ers.
Bill Walsh, 49er head coach, told the Daily yester
day that his club is also going to sign offensive line
man Gene Engle as a free agent.
"Ceresino is simply a great performer," Walsh said.
"He's explosive, quick, with great football instincts. I
suppose he wasn't drafted because most NFL teams
look for bigger linebackers to play in the middle."
"There's been some question about his speed,
but we timed Gordy last Saturday in the 40 in 4.9
seconds. If he makes our club, I know he'll help us."
Leigh Steinberg, Ceresino's attorney, said he was
"very pleased" about the signing and the terms of the
contract, which he said resulted from competition
between the49ers and two Canadian Football League

teams.
"Gordy has a very viable chance to make the team,"
Steinberg said. "He has the leadership quality and
fiery spirit that a young team like San Francisco
needs."
The 6-foot-2,224-pound Ceresinowas AII-Pacific-10
during the two years of Walsh's tenure as head coach
at Stanford, setting a Stanford career record for tack
les with 533.
Walsh added that in addition to signing Engle, who
was a second team AII-Pac-10 guard in 1978, the 49ers
were close to coming to terms with Stanford tight end
Mitch Pleis, who caught 21 passes for the Cardinals
last season.
"We would like to have Mitch with us," Walsh said,
adding that nothing was definite as of yet.
Ceresino could not be reached for comment yes
terday. The Daily will have a full report on this and
other professional football developments on Wed
nesday.
