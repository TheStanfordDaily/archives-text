# Evans: LSJUMB's first female drum major
## 
### Chris Yates 
Sophomore Megan Evans is
ready to defy Stanford tradi
tion. Beginning this quarter,
she will be the first female
drum major in the history of
the Leland Stanford junior
University Marching Band.
Evans admited that she is
nervous but is confident that
once she knows what the job is
all about, she will be able to
handle it. "It's basically a fear
of the unknown," she said.
Evans was chosen recently in
what was termed "an unex
pected move." Because the
Band "staph's" original candi
date for drum major stopped
out soon after he was chosen,
they had to scramble to find a
replacement for this quarter.
Bruce Heiman, assistant
manager ot the Band, said,
"Given Megan's dancing abil

ity and general air of craziness,
we thought she was the best
choice. She has the potential to
be one of the most exciting
drum majors the band has ever
had."
At home in her comfortably
cluttered room, Evans exudes a
casually kickback, even or
ganic attitude, yet her quick
and confident flow of ideas be
lies a keen mind.
Clothes are scattered about
the room, and one wall is co
vered with a montage of pic
tures clipped from magazines.
Her wild blond hair pulled
back in a scarf, she puffed on
herbal cigarettes and de
scribed her background.
Evans' upbringing makes her
unique. The daughter of a
minister, she grew up in Tibu
ron, a small, affluent Marin
County community.

She said she enjoyed grow
ing up in the liberal Marin envi
ronment, which has recently
been popularized by books,ar
ticles and television programs.
Her freshman roommate, Be
verly Hilton, said,"Megan is
not a character straight out of
The Serial (a popular novel
which chronicles the lives of
some Marin residents). But she
is very open minded and in that
respect she personifies the es
sence of Marin."
Much of Evans' childhood
was focused on a local church
youth group, hardly the breed
ing grounds for a Stanford
drum major, one might think.
But according to Evans it was
"crazy, not a typical church
groi'o."
Evans said her parents al
lowed her a lot of freedom
while she was growing up,

which influenced her more
than anything else. Her father
is a minister in the United
Church of Christ, a church she
described as "pretty radical." It
was one of the first to ordain a
gay minister.
Evans' first encounter with
the and occurred at age 10,
when she saw the Incompara
bles on television performing
at the Rose Bowl. She said she
was so impressed with them
that she decided she wanted to
go to school here.
"I felt that any institution of
higher learning that had a band
like that has to have its stuff
together," she said.
Evans said that since she has
been here, her views have
been modified a bit. "The ad
ministration has not been
overly supportive of the Band,
which is understandable given
the strong alumni pressures."
Evans said, "Everyone takes
our shows too seriously. We
don't take ourselves seriously
and we're not trying to put ac
ross any heavy social message.
We make fun of everything —
we've never done a real pro
anybody show."
As for criticism of lewdness
exhibited by the band, Evans
said she sees the sexuality ex
pressed in the shows as funny.
"People at Stanford don't talk
about sex — the shows are a
good outlet," she said.
According to Evans, the main
purpose of the Band is "to have
fun and provide an excuse to
get rowdy."
From all appearances, the
band is successful. Students
now must audition to get a co
veted spot in the LSJUMB,
while many schools pay their
band members. Postgame con-

certs are well-attended, while
at other schools they are un
heard of.
Evans attributes the band's
success to many factors, the
most important being its
music. She said at a recent
party thrown by the UCLA
band she was heaped with
compliments from Bruin band
members. "They were really
impressed by how much
everyone in the band gives —
we make so much more noise
than anybody else. They also
couldn't believe all our charts
(music) are arranged by stu
dents," she said.
Evans said she feels the
strength of the music facilitates
otheraspectsof the band, from
the outrageous costumes to
risque halftime shows.
Evans said she is ambivalent
about the feminist movement
and does not see herself as
striking a blow for women's
rights. "I've never felt limited
by my sex, and it has never
stopped me from doing any
thing," she said.
Evans said she plans to have
one basic outfit for all the
shows, mainly because of the
expense involved. Because she
has done a lot of makeup work
in various productions, includ
ing Gaieties, she plans to in
clude makeup as a major part
of her costume.
The band is notorious forgiv
ing the drum major a hard
time. However, Evans said she
anticipates few problems and
speculates that reverse dis
crimination may work in her
favor. "Being the first woman
to hold the position, they may
tend to be easier on me," she
said. "But I'm quite willing to
bitch,"she added, smifing.

Church of Christ, a church she
described as "pretty radical." It
was one of the first to ordain a
gay minister.
Evans' first encounter with
the and occurred at age 10,
when she saw the Incompara
bles on television performing
at the Rose Bowl. She said she
was so impressed with them
that she decided she wanted to
go to school here.
"I felt that any institution of
higher learning that had a band
like that has to have its stuff
together," she said.
Evans said that since she has
been here, her views have
been modified a bit. "The ad
ministration has not been
overly supportive of the Band,
which is understandable given
the strong alumni pressures."
Evans said, "Everyone takes
our shows too seriously. We
don't take ourselves seriously
and we're not trying to put ac
ross any heavy social message.
We make fun of everything —
we've never done a real pro
anybody show."
As for criticism of lewdness
exhibited by the band, Evans
said she sees the sexuality ex
pressed in the shows as funny.
"People at Stanford don't talk
about sex — the shows are a
good outlet," she said.
According to Evans, the main
purpose of the Band is "to have
fun and provide an excuse to
get rowdy."
From all appearances, the
band is successful. Students
now must audition to get a co
veted spot in the LSJUMB,
while many schools pay their
band members. Postgame con-

certs are well-attended, while
at other schools they are un
heard of.
Evans attributes the band's
success to many factors, the
most important being its
music. She said at a recent
party thrown by the UCLA
band she was heaped with
compliments from Bruin band
members. "They were really
impressed by how much
everyone in the band gives —
we make so much more noise
than anybody else. They also
couldn't believe all our charts
(music) are arranged by stu
dents," she said.
Evans said she feels the
strength of the music facilitates
otheraspectsof the band, from
the outrageous costumes to
risque halftime shows.
Evans said she is ambivalent
about the feminist movement
and does not see herself as
striking a blow for women's
rights. "I've never felt limited
by my sex, and it has never
stopped me from doing any
thing," she said.
Evans said she plans to have
one basic outfit for all the
shows, mainly because of the
expense involved. Because she
has done a lot of makeup work
in various productions, includ
ing Gaieties, she plans to in
clude makeup as a major part
of her costume.
The band is notorious forgiv
ing the drum major a hard
time. However, Evans said she
anticipates few problems and
speculates that reverse dis
crimination may work in her
favor. "Being the first woman
to hold the position, they may
tend to be easier on me," she
said. "But I'm quite willing to
bitch,"she added, smifing.

Megan Evans
Sophomore Megan Evans is
ready to defy Stanford tradi
tion. Beginning this quarter,
she will be the first female
drum major in the history of
the Leland Stanford junior
University Marching Band.
Evans admited that she is
nervous but is confident that
once she knows what the job is
all about, she will be able to
handle it. "It's basically a fear
of the unknown," she said.
Evans was chosen recently in
what was termed "an unex
pected move." Because the
Band "staph's" original candi
date for drum major stopped
out soon after he was chosen,
they had to scramble to find a
replacement for this quarter.
Bruce Heiman, assistant
manager ot the Band, said,
"Given Megan's dancing abil

ity and general air of craziness,
we thought she was the best
choice. She has the potential to
be one of the most exciting
drum majors the band has ever
had."
At home in her comfortably
cluttered room, Evans exudes a
casually kickback, even or
ganic attitude, yet her quick
and confident flow of ideas be
lies a keen mind.
Clothes are scattered about
the room, and one wall is co
vered with a montage of pic
tures clipped from magazines.
Her wild blond hair pulled
back in a scarf, she puffed on
herbal cigarettes and de
scribed her background.
Evans' upbringing makes her
unique. The daughter of a
minister, she grew up in Tibu
ron, a small, affluent Marin
County community.

She said she enjoyed grow
ing up in the liberal Marin envi
ronment, which has recently
been popularized by books,ar
ticles and television programs.
Her freshman roommate, Be
verly Hilton, said,"Megan is
not a character straight out of
The Serial (a popular novel
which chronicles the lives of
some Marin residents). But she
is very open minded and in that
respect she personifies the es
sence of Marin."
Much of Evans' childhood
was focused on a local church
youth group, hardly the breed
ing grounds for a Stanford
drum major, one might think.
But according to Evans it was
"crazy, not a typical church
groi'o."
Evans said her parents al
lowed her a lot of freedom
while she was growing up,

which influenced her more
than anything else. Her father
is a minister in the United
Church of Christ, a church she
described as "pretty radical." It
