The Daffy
Duckathon
This segment of the show features DAFFY DOODLES, in
which we find Daffy as the mad, uncontrollable mustache
maniac! MV LITTLE DUCKEROO, in which the in
trepid Daffy encounters the infamous Nasty Canasta:
plus THE SCARLET PL'MPERN ICRLE and DRAFTEE
DAFFY.
The Bugs Bunny
Quintet
Bugs Bunny is now in the midst of an interest revival that
approaches cult proportions, and here are his all time
classics. WHAT'S OPERA DOC? features Elmer Fudd as
a crazed Viking whose magic helmet creates psychedelic
thunderstorms; while in RABBIT OF SEVILLE we find
Fudd subjected to the strangest barbering the bald
headed madman ever got; and SLICK HARE finds Bugs
ordered for dinner as fried rabbit by Humphry Bogart.
Others equally hysterical and brillant in the Rabbit Tri
bute are Tex Avery's HECKLING HARE and SAHARA
HARE with Yosmite Samo.
MERRIE MELODIES
MASTERPIECES
These early technicolor rarities, made In Warner
Brothers in the early thirties .is an answer to Walt Disney's
SILLY SYMPHONIES feature perhaps the finest
technicolor work ever done. These are seldom seen
cartoons incIuding:HONEYMOON HOTEL (1933);
COO COO NUT (1936); MR & MRS. IS I HE NAME
(1937); THE LADY IN RED; and ONE FROGGY
EVENING. Truly a special treat for all cartoon fans.
