# Cleaver discusses black quality of life

New tactics have to be developed to improve
the economic quality of life for blacks in
America, according to former Black Panther
Party Leader Eldridge Cleaver who spoke here
last night.
Cleaver, speaking at an American Studies
House sherry hour, said the movement of the
sixties which tried to elevate the social status of
blacks in America was not capable of improving
the economic quality of life for black Ameri
cans.
"The movement of blacks in America histori
cally has been two-fold. One is dealing with the
special problems that blacks have (such as
segregation and social discrimination). The
other has to do with improving the (economic)
quality of life," according to Cleaver.
"The situation in the sixties was one where
black people really had it on the line as to their
fundamental status in the United States,"
Cleaver said. He added that some blacks at the
time were considering going back to Africa or

forming separate states.
"We're not going to go back to Africa. We're
not going to be separated into divided states.
We are Americans. We are Americans in the
fullest sense of the word," Cleaver said.
"For all those years (the sixties) we weren't
able to deal with the quality of life because we
were hung upon the color line and dealing with
that.
"One of the hardest things you'll find is for
people to back away from a slogan or a tactical
position after a situation changes," said
Cleaver.
Speaking on the Black Panther Party move
ment in the late sixties and early seventies,
Cleaver said, "One thing is true of that move
ment. No one really knew what was going on."
With young whites at that time attacking gov
ernment because of the war in Vietnam and
with blacks attacking the government over civil
rights there existed a state in America resembl
ing "anarchy," he said. "No one seemed to
realize that everybody was afraid."

At the beginning of the civil rights movement
whites and blacks worked together for the
cause, Cleaver said. However, when civil rights
activist Stokely Carmichael called for whites to
work in the white community and blacks to
work in the black community, the movement
was charged with having "a black body with a
white head." Strong black nationalism grew up
and a split developed between blacks and
whites who had previously worked together.
Cleaver, who had fled the United States after
being charged with murder, said that upon his
return home he was not accepted by his former
comrades.
"When I surrendered . . . they denounced
me," Cleaver said. He explained that the
Panthers saw his surrender as an admission that
he was capable of getting a fair trial in the Un
ited States, a veritable "heresy."
Though expressing optimism about change
in the future, Cleaver likened the situation in
the United States today to that of Rome before
its fall.
