San Francisco (AP) â€”
Northern California
motorists have turned to
public transportation in in
creasing numbers as their
gas-thirsty vehicles, idled by
the worst fuel shortage in
six years, remained parked
at home this week.
Two major express bus
lines, Greyhound and Con
tinental Trailways, reported
a 30 percent increase in rid
ership, with routes serving
resort areas especially heav
ily patronized.
"Normally, this is a fairly
slack time of the year. But
we've had a tremendous in
crease in riders into and out
of San Francisco," said Roy

Brannen, operations man
ager for Continental Trail
ways. Traffic to Reno and
Lake Tahoe was very heavy
because "people don't want
to get stranded there with
out gas," he said.
On Monday morning,
Santa Clara County adopted
an odd-even gasoline ra
tioning plan expected to be
in effect today.
Under the schedule,
motorists will be served
on odd or even numbered
days of the month depend
ing on the last number in
their license plates. Stations
with gasoline will display a
green flag, stations without
gas will fly a red flag, and a

yellow (lag signifies
gasoline available for
emergency vehicles only.
All major taxicab com
panies in San Francisco re
ported an average 10 per
cent increase in radio calls.
"People just don't want to
wait in gas lines," said Fred
Seronick of City Cab.
"We've had an increase in
airport service, from the
airport to San Mateo or San
Bruno, close by. People
don't have the gas to pick up
their relatives."
He also said there has
been an increase in
emergency calls: "They
don't want to wait in a gas
line when their wife's hav
ing a baby."
