# Two decades of progress
## Schawlow describes the explosion of laser technology 
### Victor Menon 
Twenty years ago, Dr. Arthur
Schawlow, believing that his
invention would be "useful for
something," developed the
theoretical basis for the first
laser.
The two decades since have
witnessed an amazing explo
sion in laser technology. Today
lasers are used in applications
ranging from laying out
straight subway tracks to dril
ling holes in the nipples of
baby bottles.
Schawlow, now a professor
of physics here, is often cre
dited with having invented the
laser, although he was not the
first to construct the
mechanism. He said his lab at

Bell Telephone lacked the
necessary manpower in 1958 to
build a laser. But most of his
ideas were included in the first
laser, which was built two years
later by T.H. Maiman of
Hughes Aircraft.
The term "laser" is actually
an acronym for Light Amplifica
tion by Stimulated Emission of
Radiation. The expression has
since been expanded to in
clude any of a larger number of
devices which produce pure,
intense and directional light.
Schawlow said he sees the
laser's development as part of
"a historical trend" toward
higher frequency radiation de
vices. Once the maser (Mic
rowave ASER) was invented in

1954 by Charles Towne, who
eventually shared the 1964
Nobel Prize in Physics for this
accomplishment, the de
velopment of the laser was a
natural next step.
Doubting colleagues
But many colleagues didn't
believe such a device could be
built.
"We didn't pay any attention
to them, and in the end it
worked," Schawlow recalls.
"Since it hadn't been done yet,
we thought designing a laser
device would be difficult, but it
turned out to be easy. The
techniques were there; the
work just had to be done."
A laser consists of two small
mirrors — one of which is

semi-transparent — and a
source of high energy material.
This material may be either a
solid, such as ruby crystal, or a
gas.
As the high-energy material
between the mirrors is stimu
lated by an electric current or
by an internal lamp, it emits
lights of many frequencies.
The frequency that is reflected
back and forth varies with the
distance between the mirrors.
Light of a specific wavelength is
thus amplified and passed out
of the laser through the semi
transparent mirror.
Today, there is a large family
of lasers of all sizes and shapes.
The least powerful yet most
common lasers are of the
helium-neon type which gen
erate only about one
thousandth of a watt.
Nevertheless, they are surpris
ingly versatile. Bay Area Rapid
Transit and the Mexico City
subways were laid out using
these lasers. They are also used
to produce holograms, which
can be thought of as three
dimensional photographs.
Cell surgery
Larger lasers about several
watts strong have other appli
cations. Because they can drill
holes smaller than the diame
ter of a cell they are used in
biological research to perform
microsurgery on selected por
tions of individual cells.
Laserium, the popular laser
light show, also employs banks
of these larger lasers.
The most powerful lasers
produce hundreds of watts of
light energy. These lasers can
drill small holes in diamonds,
and in industry, copper wires
are made by pushing the cop
per through such holes.
Diamond-tipped drills were
previously used to make the
holes, a process which took
several hours. A laser can drill
more accurate holes in sec
onds, Schawlow said.
Lasers can also be guided by
computer and are being used
to cut clothing materials. Thus,
a laser can cut very hard or very
soft materials, both of which
once posed many manufactur
ing difficulties, Schawlow said.

The more powerful lasers
also have important applica
tions in chemistry. Chemical
reactions are usually promoted
by increasing temperatures,
and by using lasers to selec
tively heat portions of a reac
tion mixture, new chemical
compounds can be produced.
Also by using lasers, it is now
possible to detect individual
atoms at low densities and
temperatures.
DDT in milk
Although lasers are not yet
practical to analyze a great
many compounds, Schawlow
said heenvisionsatimewhen it
might be possible to detect, for
example, a single molecule of
DDT in a quart of milk.
"We would then have to
learn to live with varying de
grees of purity, and accept
some risks as reasonable
ones," he explained.
Lasers have already been
used to separate chemical
isotopes — atoms having the
same chemical properties but
different atomic weights.

Schawlow said it might be pos
sible in the future to separate
the two uranium isotopes, LH ,,;
and U" 8 . The former isotope,
used in nuclear reactors and
weaponry, is present in much
smaller quantities than U-" 8 ,
and an efficient separation
process would be quite valu
able commercially.
Schawlow expressed some
concern with this, however,
saying it "might be too easy for
irresponsible people to sepa
rate the uranium isotopes and
make bombs."
Although itwas oncefeltthat
lasers would not become very
important in the field of com
munications, the development
of efficient glass fibers as thin
as hairs have made it possible
to optically transmit informa
tion over distances up to one
kilometer in length, ideal for
applications in large cities.
Lasers in space
Lasers have many potential
uses in space as well. Man can
now use lasers to instantane
ously measure the distance be

tween the earth and moon to
an accuracy of one foot. One
day this capability may allow us
to measure the rate at which
the continents are drifting
apart, or to measure earth crust
motion along earthquake
faults, Schawlow said.
In medicine, lasers are im
portant in eye surgery. They
are used, forexample, to repair
detached retinas and are also
used to cauterize leaking
blood vessels. Moreover, they
are the* most effective way of
removing tattoos.
Schawlow's most recent
work has been in laser spec
troscopy, which utilizes lasers
to observe details in the
spectra of atoms and
molecules. He said he hopes
that a better understanding of
the interaction of light and
matter will lead to new laser
devices. He claims that today's
lasers are far from ideal: not
only are they "too expensive
for what they do," they are
only about .01 percent effi
cient.

laser spectroscopy, which utilizes lasers to observe details in the spectra of atoms and molecules.
Schawlow is shown giving a demonstration to his Physics 23 class last quarter.
