# Latest evidence seems to validate mysterious shroud

### Associated Press 
American scientists who examined the an
cient Shroud of Turin which supposedly wrap
ped Christ's body have not yet drawn final con
clusions about it, but they say preliminary find
ings tend to validate it.
"All the evidence to date supports authentic
ity," said computer analyst Kenneth Stevenson
of New Orleans, designated official spokesman
for the team of about 30 scientists in various
specialties.
"At this point, in my opinion, it would be
more of a miracle if it proves to be a hoax than if
it proves to be genuine."
The team spent two weeks in Turin, Italy, last
fall, running all sorts of the latest scientific tests
on the cloth with its puzzling image of a man
wounded in the way the Bible says Christ was.
The scientists regard their raw data as the
most thorough ever amassed on the shroud.
"We've had the very best scientific involve
ment," said physicist John Jackson, a teacher at
the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado and one
of the scientific coordinators of the project.
Jigsaw puzzle
"We're looking at the whole jigsaw puzzle,
but there are so many pieces, it's going to take a
while. We want our report to reflect the best,
considered scientific conclusion from what the
data shows."
However, with work going on at a half dozen
different laboratories and institutes, some par
tial findings already have emerged, some of
them considered of a dramatically affirming na
ture.
"I haven't seen anything yet that would lead
one to think the shroud is not real," said chemist
Robert Dinegar of the Los Alomos Scientific
Laboratory in New Mexico. "I think the burden
of proof is being pushed on the skeptics."
The shroud, a strange relic of controversy for
600 years, variously dismissed as a fraud and
revered as the burial cloth from which Christ
was resurrected, is about 14 feet long and 4 feet
wide.
Same wounds
It bears the enigmatic imprint of a muscular,
5-foot-10 man, with pierce marks about the top
of the head, flogging lacerations on the back,
bruises on shoulders and knees, and wounds in
the side, wrists and feet — all suggestive of the

accounts of Jesus' crucifixion.
But what is the molecular composition of the
image? What formed it?
These are key questions in the current re
search. The investigators, applying the scientific
system of eliminating hypothetical possibilities,
so far have determined:
That the image was not painted or stained,
that it was not caused by a body "contact print"
from fluids or other elements, that it is not a
"vaporograph" from ammoniac chemical reac
tion to body vapors and burial unguents — all of
which have at times been claimed.
"We just don't know yet," said Dinegar. "It
seems as if it possibly came from some short
term pulse of energy.
'In the dark'
"It would have had to be a pretty good
amount of energy, but not too much or it would
have scorched the cloth. We're quite a bit in the
dark, but we're hoping to find some answers."
But Stevenson said preliminary findings are
Significant, including establishing that the
image has an inexplicably three dimensional na
ture.
"It's an utter anomaly, a unique phenome
non," he said. "Nothing like it is found in sci
ence or art. It defies the logic of any artistic or
natural process."
He said the peculiar quality was ascertained
through image analysis, a spin-off of space
technology, by which "stereotype" photo
graphs are projected on separate screens from
which the depths of various points in the image
can be determined.
"The shroud encodes this distance informa
tion in a perfect, three-dimensional image,"
Stevenson said. "It's a quality that cannot be
duplicated in any known way.
"This obviously has exciting theological im
plications," he said, adding that from a Christian
view, it would suggest some unknown thermal
or radiant-energy occurrence at the moment of
resurrection.
As to what it might have been, he said,
"There's nothing parallel to it in nature any
where that I know of. I think it was a very tre
mendous burst of energy, but not enough to
hurt the cloth.
"It may be heat, it may be light. That's the
most likely theory."
