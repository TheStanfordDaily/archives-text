In a world plagued with con
stant and gross violations of
human rights, the work of Am
nesty International (Al) offers a
ray of hope. Founded in 1961
by a British lawyer, Peter Be
nenson, it has established itself
as the premier human rights
organization in the world.
The Nobel Prize Committee
recognized Al's contributions
by awarding it the Nobel Prize
for Peace. The organization has
grown substantially since its
inception, with a present
membership of over 150,000 in
78 countries. It is unique
throughout history in that
these individual citizens and
not their governments have
taken upon themselves to pro
tect the human rights of citi
zens of other nations.
This is how Al works. At its
London headquarters about
1000 people research human
rights abuses. When a pattern
of violations appears in a coun
try, the researchers investigate
reports by witnesses, victims
and expatriates and attempt to
visit the country involved.
Their findings are published in
reports for the world commun
ity.
If an individual prisoner has
not used or advocated violence
and is found to be imprisoned
for his beliefs, color, ethnic
origin, language or religion, he
is declared a "prisoner of con
science" and his case is sent to

a local group of Al members.
The local groups inform their
community of rights violations
in the case, appeal for the pris
oner's release to the govern
ment involved and attempt to
aid the prisonerand his family.
In order to avoid political bias,
local groups work for two or
three prisoners in the West,
the Communist bloc and the
Third World. No group works
for a prisoner in its own coun
try.
University group
Stanford has its own group
that meets regularly to map ac
tivities on behalf of their two
adopted "prisoners of consci
ence": Czech Milyslav Cerny
and South Korean Whang
Hon-Sung. The adoptees of the
Stanford Al group have diverse
but equally interesting life
sketches. They are living
proof that gross violations of
human rights transcend politi
cal coloration.
Cerny, a Czechoslovakian
worker, was arrested in March
1977 for allegedly posting leaf
lets calling for the publication
of Charter 77. Charter 77 is a
report on human rights prob
lems in Czechoslovakia, writ
ten by dissidents and inspired
by the guarantees of human
rights in the Helsinki accords
between East and West.
Cerny, tried in July 1977, was
sentenced to three years in
prison. He is an epileptic and

his health has deteriorated in
prison.
International attention
raised through Al's actions has
brought about an improve
ment in the treatment of Cerny
according to a recent report by
the Czechoslovakian dissident
movement.
Whang, a South Korean high
school teacher, is the Stanford
group's other adopted pris
oner. He was arrested in April
1974 for allegedly belonging to
a political party made illegal by
decree.
He is serving a sentence of 15
years in prison although the
decree has since been re
pealed. The group has been
working on Whang's case since
August 1974 by writing to Ko
rean officials and collecting
signatures on petitions. No
marked improvement in his
case is evident yet.
I have attended a meeting of
the Stanford group and I was
impressed with the grasp of the
political events and the impli
cations to the countries of their
adoptees. There was an obvi
ous lack of religious type
human rights fervor. There was
instead a pragmatic but dog
ged mood in pursuing their
goals. This is an approach that
shows maturity and guarantees
effectiveness.

and is found to be imprisoned
for his beliefs, color, ethnic
origin, language or religion, he
is declared a "prisoner of con
science" and his case is sent to

a local group of Al members.
The local groups inform their
community of rights violations
in the case, appeal for the pris
oner's release to the govern
ment involved and attempt to
aid the prisonerand his family.
In order to avoid political bias,
local groups work for two or
three prisoners in the West,
the Communist bloc and the
Third World. No group works
for a prisoner in its own coun
try.
University group
Stanford has its own group
that meets regularly to map ac
tivities on behalf of their two
adopted "prisoners of consci
ence": Czech Milyslav Cerny
and South Korean Whang
Hon-Sung. The adoptees of the
Stanford Al group have diverse
but equally interesting life
sketches. They are living
proof that gross violations of
human rights transcend politi
cal coloration.
Cerny, a Czechoslovakian
worker, was arrested in March
1977 for allegedly posting leaf
lets calling for the publication
of Charter 77. Charter 77 is a
report on human rights prob
lems in Czechoslovakia, writ
ten by dissidents and inspired
by the guarantees of human
rights in the Helsinki accords
between East and West.
Cerny, tried in July 1977, was
sentenced to three years in
prison. He is an epileptic and

his health has deteriorated in
prison.
International attention
raised through Al's actions has
brought about an improve
ment in the treatment of Cerny
according to a recent report by
the Czechoslovakian dissident
movement.
Whang, a South Korean high
school teacher, is the Stanford
group's other adopted pris
oner. He was arrested in April
1974 for allegedly belonging to
a political party made illegal by
decree.
He is serving a sentence of 15
years in prison although the
decree has since been re
pealed. The group has been
working on Whang's case since
August 1974 by writing to Ko
rean officials and collecting
signatures on petitions. No
marked improvement in his
case is evident yet.
I have attended a meeting of
the Stanford group and I was
impressed with the grasp of the
political events and the impli
cations to the countries of their
adoptees. There was an obvi
ous lack of religious type
human rights fervor. There was
instead a pragmatic but dog
ged mood in pursuing their
goals. This is an approach that
shows maturity and guarantees
effectiveness.
