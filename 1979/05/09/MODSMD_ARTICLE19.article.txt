Big surprise
The article on the research
programs and foothill
facilities of Stanford's Radios
cience Laboratory (Daily, April
27) describes aspects of these
programs and facilities that
come as surprises to me.
Whoever it is that is trying to
sell the 150-foot dish, for
example, has not mentioned it
to me. Perhaps there is a
"Brooklyn Bridge" caper in
progress, where my colleagues
are selling something that be
longs neither to us nor the
University. They will certainly
hear from me if I don't get my
usual cut.
Also, it appears from your ar
ticle that someone is conduct

ing a much deeper skimming
operation on our NSF grants
than I had been led to believe.
It' NSF supplies us with an an
nual $2.6 million "contribution,"
I would like to know why it is
that our regular collection
routes to the National
Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration, to DOD's Office
of Naval Research, and to the
National Oceanic and Atmos
pheric Administration, are to
gether paying off more than
the one to NSF, yet our total
take (before that other skim
ming operation called "over
head' ) is only about $2.6 mill
ion.
Your reporter's story implies
that a plan to use the dish to
investigate how to aid the

troubled Voyager spacecraft
was not funded. I just don't
understand why my colleagues
would mislead me on this sub
ject. I was told that a different
professor was in charge, that
we made an offer that the
sponsor couldn't refuse, that
the dish and other equipment
performed very well indeed
after a great deal of effort on
the part of Prof. Tay Howard
and Engineering Associate Bill
Crosby, in particular, and that
the sponsor was smiling when
he made the pay-off drop.
I'm also confused about how
the number of students can
droptozero in one area, with a
similar decline in the other
areas, as you reported, and yet
to me there appears to be more

than a score wandering around
the lab. In several areas, in fact,
I am told that we are having
difficulty finding enough
graduate student research as
sistants to carry out the present
contracts.
There is no doubt that re
search emphasis and direc
tions are changing, that expen
sive and still useful facilities are
not being employed at their
potential because of these
changes, and that individuals
or sub-groups may find it very
difficult or impossible to con
tinue desired research direc
tions. On theother hand, there
are also new opportunities.
Vour article depicted the
shrinkage of support in several
areas without noting the ex
pansion in others. I would in
vite you to drop by and hear
about other facilities in the
foothills, and also about those
in Antarctica, those on the two
Voyager spacecraft near )upi
ter, and those planned for the
era of the Space Shuttle, for
example.
(Incidentally, sinceyou men
tioned the offer of the
heliopolis complex to the
Chinese government, your
readers might like to know that
we are now prepared to offer
the Chinese one of the Voy
ager spacecraft under the same
terms. That is, after they make
the necessary arrangements
with us, all they have to do is
pick up the merchandise.)

Editor's note: Thank you for the
clarifications on our story. We
did misstate the funding grant
sources in the story
Though I don't agree with
your interpretation, I can see
how one could read our story
and think there are no graduate
students at the lab.
I also cannot agree with your
reading on the Voyager issue,
but I suppose it could be misin
terpreted as well. I saw the re
porter's use of the Voyager pro
ject as demonstrative of the
high quality of lab projects,
never implying the project was

never funded.
Moreover, I must stand be
hind the reporter on the sale
of-the-dish issue. He relied on
information from members of
the lab staff, and I feel he accu
rately reported what they said.
While we appreciate your set
ting the record straight, I think
the error derives from the in
formation we received from
those sources.

I am alarmed at the number
of negative images of women
contained in campus media
and general announcements.
There have recently been sev
eral blatant examples of
sexism in campus notices. One
of the most reprehensible is a
flyer which announced a
"Pimp and Prostitute Party" in
the Cowell Cluster.
I fail to see any value or
humor in sponsoring such an
event. Not only is the theme,
for obvious reasons, offensive,
but the graphic design on the
announcement exhibited
especially poor judgment. A
bare-chested man, attired in
tight pants with a very sugges
tive design on the crotch, is
shown on the right side of the
flyer. In the upper left corner is
a significantly smaller figure of
a woman, clad very minimally.
There is also a definite sugges
tion of sado-masochism in the
caricatures.
Such representations em
phasize dominant-submissive
relationships between men
and women. Images which
portray women as sex objects
are not erotic. They are de
structive, degrading and
should not be condoned.

Editor's note: Thank you for the
clarifications on our story. We
did misstate the funding grant
sources in the story
Though I don't agree with
your interpretation, I can see
how one could read our story
and think there are no graduate
students at the lab.
I also cannot agree with your
reading on the Voyager issue,
but I suppose it could be misin
terpreted as well. I saw the re
porter's use of the Voyager pro
ject as demonstrative of the
high quality of lab projects,
never implying the project was

never funded.
Moreover, I must stand be
hind the reporter on the sale
of-the-dish issue. He relied on
information from members of
the lab staff, and I feel he accu
rately reported what they said.
While we appreciate your set
ting the record straight, I think
the error derives from the in
formation we received from
those sources.

I am alarmed at the number
of negative images of women
contained in campus media
and general announcements.
There have recently been sev
eral blatant examples of
sexism in campus notices. One
of the most reprehensible is a
flyer which announced a
"Pimp and Prostitute Party" in
the Cowell Cluster.
I fail to see any value or
humor in sponsoring such an
event. Not only is the theme,
for obvious reasons, offensive,
but the graphic design on the
announcement exhibited
especially poor judgment. A
bare-chested man, attired in
tight pants with a very sugges
tive design on the crotch, is
shown on the right side of the
flyer. In the upper left corner is
a significantly smaller figure of
a woman, clad very minimally.
There is also a definite sugges
tion of sado-masochism in the
caricatures.
Such representations em
phasize dominant-submissive
relationships between men
and women. Images which
portray women as sex objects
are not erotic. They are de
structive, degrading and
should not be condoned.

The article on the research
programs and foothill
facilities of Stanford's Radios
cience Laboratory (Daily, April
27) describes aspects of these
programs and facilities that
come as surprises to me.
Whoever it is that is trying to
sell the 150-foot dish, for
example, has not mentioned it
to me. Perhaps there is a
"Brooklyn Bridge" caper in
progress, where my colleagues
are selling something that be
longs neither to us nor the
University. They will certainly
hear from me if I don't get my
usual cut.
Also, it appears from your ar
ticle that someone is conduct

ing a much deeper skimming
operation on our NSF grants
than I had been led to believe.
It' NSF supplies us with an an
nual $2.6 million "contribution,"
I would like to know why it is
that our regular collection
routes to the National
Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration, to DOD's Office
of Naval Research, and to the
National Oceanic and Atmos
pheric Administration, are to
gether paying off more than
the one to NSF, yet our total
take (before that other skim
ming operation called "over
head' ) is only about $2.6 mill
ion.
Your reporter's story implies
that a plan to use the dish to
investigate how to aid the

troubled Voyager spacecraft
was not funded. I just don't
understand why my colleagues
would mislead me on this sub
ject. I was told that a different
professor was in charge, that
we made an offer that the
sponsor couldn't refuse, that
the dish and other equipment
performed very well indeed
after a great deal of effort on
the part of Prof. Tay Howard
and Engineering Associate Bill
Crosby, in particular, and that
the sponsor was smiling when
he made the pay-off drop.
I'm also confused about how
the number of students can
droptozero in one area, with a
similar decline in the other
areas, as you reported, and yet
to me there appears to be more

than a score wandering around
the lab. In several areas, in fact,
I am told that we are having
difficulty finding enough
graduate student research as
sistants to carry out the present
contracts.
There is no doubt that re
search emphasis and direc
tions are changing, that expen
sive and still useful facilities are
not being employed at their
potential because of these
changes, and that individuals
or sub-groups may find it very
difficult or impossible to con
tinue desired research direc
tions. On theother hand, there
are also new opportunities.
Vour article depicted the
shrinkage of support in several
areas without noting the ex
pansion in others. I would in
vite you to drop by and hear
about other facilities in the
foothills, and also about those
in Antarctica, those on the two
Voyager spacecraft near )upi
ter, and those planned for the
era of the Space Shuttle, for
example.
