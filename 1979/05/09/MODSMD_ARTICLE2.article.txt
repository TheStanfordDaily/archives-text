# Allocations to states according to past use
## Carter proposes new gas rationing plans 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter sent Congress still
another standby plan for gasoline ra
tioning yesterday that would make a
state's past use of gasoline the prime
test for distributing ration coupons.
Carter proposed the new measure
after two earlier proposals appeared
headed for certain congressional de
feat.
Under Carter's new proposal,
states generally would get allotments
of ration coupons based on historical
use of gasoline in each state.
Then, the coupons would be made
available to the public based on re
gistered vehicles in households.
Thus a person in a state which trad

itionally consumed a lot of gasoline
could get more coupons than a per
son with the same number of au
tomobiles in a state where past
gasoline use was relatively small.
'Everyone is a winner'
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas), the
chief backer of the new plan and a
strong critic of Carter's earlier prop
osals, told reporters "everyone is a
winner now. It brings equity among
the states."
It came shortly after the Senate
Energy Committee rejected by a 12-6
vote an earlier attempt by the presi
dent to make his rationing proposal
more palatable to Congress.
The original Carter version was

approved by a 9-3 margin last month,
and in another vote yesterday, the
panel also voted 10-8 to withdraw its
approval of the original plan.
When told of the vote, White
House press secretary jody Powell
denounced what he called the self
ishness of individual members of
Congress.
"What we are seeing thus far is a
situation in which the welfare of the
entire nation is being jeopardized by
a squabble . . . over the desire or
desires of this or that particular in
terest or this or that particular state
. . . for a few gallons more," Powell
said.
Powell said it would be "total
foolishness" for Congress to fail to
enact a rationing plan and predicted
that without such a plan, California's
current gasoline crunch could be re
peated on a national scale and with
far more devastating effect.
Vote postponed
A vote planned by full Senate on
the standby plan was postponed yes
terday while behind-the-scenes
negotiations were under way.
"We obviously don't have the
votes" on the floor, said Sen. Henry
Jackson (D-Wash.), the energy
committee chairman.
A 1975 law required the president
to propose a standby rationing plan
for use in emergencies and gave
Congress 60 days to act on it. Unless
both the House and the Senate ap
prove the plan by Friday, it will die
and the president will be forced to
submit a new one.
Without a congressionally ap
proved standby plan in place, it
would take at least six months to in
stitute the program through execu
tive action in case of need, administ
ration officials have said.
Appeal to Senate
Jackson told the committee he
would appeal to the full Senate to
approve the rationing plan with the
modifications proposed by the

White House.
But he warned panel members that
their vote might have been the death
knell for Carter's plan. Congress
might be forced to write its own plan
for conserving fuel in emergencies,
Jackson warned.
"I don't think it's possible to have a
rationing plan that's truly equitable,"
he said.
There were also other energy de
velopments yesterday.
The White House said the nation's
supplies of crude oil are at a
"dangerously low" level, although
Powell insisted there had been no
appreciable increase in the chance
that rationing will be required.
Near 'minimum safe level'
Powell said the nation's reserves of
crude oil were down to 319 million
barrels, compared to the 310 million
considered to be a "minimum safe
level" by the Energy Dept.
Coal-state senators met with the
president to plead with him not to
toughen air pollution standards for
coal-burning power plants.
The Environmental Protection
Agency is considering a 20 percent
reduction in the -amount of sulfur
dioxide the plants can legally spew
into the air, a move the senators said
would unduly hurt their states and
aggravate the nation's energy prob
lem.
Long lines exception
An Associated Press spot check
showed that long lines at gas stations
generally are the exception, not the
rule, in most areas of the country.
But industry officials said things will
get worse.
"This is the calm before the storm,
and the storm is going to come about
Memorial Day," said Herbert Hugo,
a senior editor at Piatt's Oilgram, an
industry newsletter in Chicago. "The
handwriting on the wall is out there
in California."

Coal-state senators met with the
president to plead with him not to
toughen air pollution standards for
coal-burning power plants.

Long lines exception
An Associated Press spot check

generally are the exception, not the
rule, in most areas of the country.

get worse.

Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter sent Congress still
another standby plan for gasoline ra
tioning yesterday that would make a
state's past use of gasoline the prime
test for distributing ration coupons.
Carter proposed the new measure
after two earlier proposals appeared
headed for certain congressional de
feat.
Under Carter's new proposal,
states generally would get allotments
of ration coupons based on historical
use of gasoline in each state.
Then, the coupons would be made
available to the public based on re
gistered vehicles in households.
Thus a person in a state which trad

itionally consumed a lot of gasoline
could get more coupons than a per
son with the same number of au
tomobiles in a state where past
gasoline use was relatively small.
'Everyone is a winner'
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas), the
chief backer of the new plan and a
strong critic of Carter's earlier prop
osals, told reporters "everyone is a
winner now. It brings equity among
the states."
It came shortly after the Senate
Energy Committee rejected by a 12-6
vote an earlier attempt by the presi
dent to make his rationing proposal
more palatable to Congress.
The original Carter version was

approved by a 9-3 margin last month,
and in another vote yesterday, the
panel also voted 10-8 to withdraw its
approval of the original plan.
When told of the vote, White
House press secretary jody Powell
denounced what he called the self
ishness of individual members of
Congress.
"What we are seeing thus far is a
situation in which the welfare of the
entire nation is being jeopardized by
a squabble . . . over the desire or
desires of this or that particular in
terest or this or that particular state
. . . for a few gallons more," Powell
said.
Powell said it would be "total
foolishness" for Congress to fail to
enact a rationing plan and predicted
that without such a plan, California's
current gasoline crunch could be re
peated on a national scale and with
far more devastating effect.
Vote postponed
A vote planned by full Senate on
the standby plan was postponed yes
terday while behind-the-scenes
negotiations were under way.
"We obviously don't have the
votes" on the floor, said Sen. Henry
Jackson (D-Wash.), the energy
committee chairman.
A 1975 law required the president
to propose a standby rationing plan
for use in emergencies and gave
Congress 60 days to act on it. Unless
both the House and the Senate ap
prove the plan by Friday, it will die
and the president will be forced to
submit a new one.
Without a congressionally ap
proved standby plan in place, it
would take at least six months to in
stitute the program through execu
tive action in case of need, administ
ration officials have said.
Appeal to Senate
Jackson told the committee he
would appeal to the full Senate to
approve the rationing plan with the
modifications proposed by the

White House.
But he warned panel members that
their vote might have been the death
knell for Carter's plan. Congress
might be forced to write its own plan
for conserving fuel in emergencies,
Jackson warned.
"I don't think it's possible to have a
rationing plan that's truly equitable,"
he said.
There were also other energy de
velopments yesterday.
The White House said the nation's
supplies of crude oil are at a
"dangerously low" level, although
Powell insisted there had been no
appreciable increase in the chance
that rationing will be required.
Near 'minimum safe level'
Powell said the nation's reserves of
crude oil were down to 319 million
barrels, compared to the 310 million
considered to be a "minimum safe
level" by the Energy Dept.
