## Draw mystifies the losers 
### 
I have yet to understand the illogical system of
the Housing Draw. Not counting admissions
decisions, it remains the great mystery of Uni
versity policy.
As a steady victim of the higher numbers, I
have spent considerable time wondering why
the Single Student Housing Office, for which I
feel no particular antipathy, seems determined
to place me in the most undesirable residences.
After drawing 4804 for our unguaranteed year,
my roommates and I tried to deal with the crisis
in the most mature and intelligent manner.
Namely, we went back to our trailer and, over
shots of tequila, proceeded to rag on the draw
system, the housing shortage, Assoc. Dean of
Residential Education Norm Robinson and any
one we knew who had ever drawn lower than
1000.
We came to a basic conclusion: we drew
poorly because we were Trying Too Hard. Trying
Too Hard consists of spending one week of
spring quarter running from row house to row
house to Cowell Cluster to Lambda Nu and back
again.
All within the rather limited and arbitrary
hours during which the present residents
(whom we instinctively hate, unless they are
graduating seniors) have agreed to sign priority
cards.
Trying Too Hard also means writing an essay
on a newly contrived interest in American
Studies and agreeing to take two quarters of
Italian which will do me no end of good in Clive

den.
The proper strategy seems to be to act casual,
get no priorities and show up to draw on the last
day. If you really don't care where you live, you
have a pretty good chance of drawing in the top
200.
The trick is to draw well your freshman year.
Then you can reap the full benefits of that dubi
ous phenomenon called Returning Residence
Priority. By this system, a few select individuals
can become row house groupies while the rest
of us endure seedy dorms and wish that a
woman named Lucie Stern had never lived.
As fornextyear, livingoff campuscould bean
interesting experience. The thought of weekly
grocery shopping, and commuting to classes
promises to be valuable training for Life After
College. Bytheend of the year we'll be throwing
block parties and running for city council.
Of course, there are always the waiting lists. If
we could afford to pitch a pup tent on Wilbur
Field for the first three weeks of fall quarter, the
Housing Office has assured us that spaces al
ways open up.
Whatever the case, we have the comforting
feeling that we really can't draw any worse next
year. After all, 4804 is statistically as hard todraw
as 1%, and two years in the 4000 Club ought to
guarantee us a good number. But I wouldn't bet
on it.
