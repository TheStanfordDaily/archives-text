# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Doug Felt Draft must be made truly universal 
### 
I think Rep. Pete McClos
key's (R-Menlo Park) plan to
eliminate the ethnic bias in the
draft is commendable. But
might I suggest to you,
McCloskey, that your plan
does not go tar enough? For
after all, there are many bases
for discrimination besides
ethnicity, and we should surely
try to eliminate all of them.
With this in mind, I present my
Universal Draft Proposal for
you to submit to your voters:
—We must draft an equal
proportion of the population
of both sexes. Otherwise, we
continue to promote sexual
discrimination, and certainly
this cannot be tolerated.
—We must draft an equal
proportion of the population
of all age groups. The defense
of our country is everyone's re
sponsibility— nay, right — and
there are doubtless many
able-bodied men and women
in their 30s, 40s, 50s and
beyond who would be de
lighted to be drafted overseas.
Not to mention those teen
age and pre-teenage kids look

ing for adventure and a "real
education." Imagine the lift in
morale with them fighting
alongside us in the front lines!
(Or building dams in the
Arizona desert.)
Handicapped to serve?
—The phrase "able-bodied"
might have mislead you,
McCloskey. For discrimination
against the physically hand
icapped is rampant and largely
unrecognized in our society.
Can we allow this inequality to
continue? No! The physically
handicapped have a "right to
fight" which cannot be ab
ridged. The deaf can still shoot,
the blind can still feed ammun
ition.
And by bringing together the
handicapped and the unhand
icapped, Congressman, we
can foster understanding
among these heretofore
largely segregated groups.
—We should draft an equal
proportion of the population
of all occupational and status

groups. How right you are,
McCloskey, when you decry
the fact that the poor are the
only ones to fight! Why are the
middle and upper income, the
bankers, lawyers, professors,
even government officials like
yourself denied this privilege?
Relieve grind
Why should these groups be
discriminated against simply
because they have careers? I
think a brief two years away
from the daily grind would do
us all good, students, laborers
and congressmen alike, don't
you?
It would be another step to
ward a truly equal and class
less society. So what of our
jobs? Afterall, weall havelives,
and that's what counts, right,
McCloskey?
—But what of those with
families? Good observation,
McCloskey. Although there is
much discrimination against
the unmarried and childless in
our society, I agree that the

sanctity of the American nuc
lear family must not be
harmed, but supported.
Thus, I propose, in accor
dance and complete agree
ment with the above
guidelines, that we draft not
individuals but entire families
— Mom, Dad, kids, family dog
and all. Even grandma and
gramps could come along!
What a way to bring a family
together, and remind us of
what we are fighting for, the
American Way Of Life. Do you
have a family, McCloskey?
Here's your chance! Why pass
up a vacation with your loved
ones in Appalachia, Iran or
Uganda?
So if we're going to have a
draft and yet maintain your
high principles, Congressman,
let's make it truly equal and
universal. I can't think of a bet
ter way to bring this country
together.

us all good, students, laborers
and congressmen alike, don't
you?
It would be another step to
ward a truly equal and class
less society. So what of our
jobs? Afterall, weall havelives,
and that's what counts, right,
McCloskey?
—But what of those with
families? Good observation,
McCloskey. Although there is
much discrimination against
the unmarried and childless in
our society, I agree that the

sanctity of the American nuc
lear family must not be
harmed, but supported.
Thus, I propose, in accor
dance and complete agree
ment with the above
guidelines, that we draft not
individuals but entire families
— Mom, Dad, kids, family dog
and all. Even grandma and
gramps could come along!
What a way to bring a family
together, and remind us of
what we are fighting for, the
American Way Of Life. Do you
have a family, McCloskey?
Here's your chance! Why pass
up a vacation with your loved
ones in Appalachia, Iran or
Uganda?
So if we're going to have a
draft and yet maintain your
high principles, Congressman,
let's make it truly equal and
universal. I can't think of a bet
ter way to bring this country
together.
