## Is U.S. liberalism dead? 
### 
Is the flaming, red-eyed
American liberal dead? One
may well ask such a question.,
The jury is still out, however,
and even though the facts all
apparently point in the general
direction of his demise, the
expiring patient's breath still
frosts the mirror.
The litany of the passing lib
eral is long and well-known by
now. No longer do people
view simply tossing money at
social problems as the best, or
even adequate solution.
Hubert Humphrey, the Min
nesota senator, the consum
mate liberal warrior and effu
sive program creator, is gone.
Hard-line members such as
Sen. Edmund Muskie (D-
Maine), Sen. George
McGovern (D-South Dakota),
and others have disappeared
from both newspapers and the
spectacle of mainstream poli
tics. Only a die-hard like Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
remains, riding the crest of
personal popularity and the
magic of a mystical family
name.
It is not a coincidence that

the demise of the liberal has
been accompanied by an up
swing of Republicans. Both the
dyed-in-the-wool, if not the
hair, old-timers, like former
Governor Ronald Reagan, as
well as the slick likes of lack
Kemp are quarterbacking the
pack of new aspirants to the
leadership of the political
football game.
Indeed, the passing of the
New Dealers, along with the
retirement of the Great Society
proponents, has opened the

way for strong, vigorous and,
at long last, youthful politi
cians. Perhaps the cries of stu

been answered.
But politics isn't everything.
Liberalism has not only de
parted from the political scene
but has seemingly vanished
from the whole national TV pic
ture. College students protest
for jobs, not causes. They join
fraternities and sororities,
seeking to imitate the earnest
ness, if not the naivete, of the
simpler 19505.
Blander concerns
Their parents worry about
costs of living and prices, not
the generation gap or dissent.
People no longer merely
grumble about their taxes, they
now march and even vote
against them. Inflation is the
No. 1 concern, along with the
declining American masculin
ity abroad.
Global muscle flexing has
begun anew, and a new selec
tive, though wholly involun
tary, service hovers in the
wings for the launching of a
new imperialist age. Yet the
United States remains weak in

a changed and complex world,
preoccupied with the new
conservatism and the night
mare of remembered false
hopes and shattered promises.
National pundits have both
lamented and lauded the wan
ing of liberalism. Maybe this
move to the right is only
momentary. Perhaps it is even
beneficial, allowing us time to
lick our moral wounds while
wallowing in self pity. Some
how, I doubt it.
After soul-wrenching catac-

lysms, nations have often re
sorted to extremes. In our
peculiar example, we have
seen the failure of honest al
truistic liberalism, and we now
seek a cynical materialistic
conservatism. Our innocence
has gone the way of our
idealism.
Vet are we really heading for
a renewal of that dread ogre,
fascism, or do we merely de
sire a return to former Presi
dent Warren Harding's "nor
malcy?" Unfortunately it is too
early to tell; we may only hope
for the best. Nonetheless, if
America doesn't regain a posi
tive image of itself, our cyni
cism will only grow and feed
on itself like a cancer. And that
only spells danger for all of us.

It is not a coincidence that

the demise of the liberal has
been accompanied by an up
swing of Republicans. Both the

Governor Ronald Reagan, as

But politics isn't everything.
Liberalism has not only de
parted from the political scene
but has seemingly vanished
from the whole national TV pic
ture. College students protest
for jobs, not causes. They join
fraternities and sororities,
seeking to imitate the earnest
ness, if not the naivete, of the
simpler 19505.
Blander concerns
Their parents worry about
costs of living and prices, not
the generation gap or dissent.
People no longer merely
grumble about their taxes, they
now march and even vote
against them. Inflation is the
No. 1 concern, along with the
declining American masculin
ity abroad.
Global muscle flexing has
begun anew, and a new selec
tive, though wholly involun
tary, service hovers in the
wings for the launching of a
new imperialist age. Yet the
United States remains weak in

a changed and complex world,
preoccupied with the new
conservatism and the night
mare of remembered false
hopes and shattered promises.
National pundits have both
lamented and lauded the wan
ing of liberalism. Maybe this
move to the right is only
momentary. Perhaps it is even
beneficial, allowing us time to
lick our moral wounds while
wallowing in self pity. Some
how, I doubt it.
After soul-wrenching catac-

lysms, nations have often re
sorted to extremes. In our
peculiar example, we have
seen the failure of honest al
truistic liberalism, and we now
seek a cynical materialistic
conservatism. Our innocence
has gone the way of our
idealism.
Vet are we really heading for
a renewal of that dread ogre,
fascism, or do we merely de
sire a return to former Presi
dent Warren Harding's "nor
malcy?" Unfortunately it is too
early to tell; we may only hope
for the best. Nonetheless, if
America doesn't regain a posi
tive image of itself, our cyni
cism will only grow and feed
on itself like a cancer. And that
only spells danger for all of us.
