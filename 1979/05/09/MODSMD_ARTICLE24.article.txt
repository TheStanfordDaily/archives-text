# Carter and nuclear energy: is he keeping his promises?
## 
### Associated Press 
jimmy Carter the president has been less
outspoken than jimmy Carter the candidate
about the need for keeping the use of nuc
lear power to a minimum. But a look at the
record fails to support critics' claims that
Carter deceived the country.
Ralph Nader made the charge on Sunday
at an anti-nuclear rally in Washington.
"Jimmy Carter told us in 1976 that he would
use nuclear power only as a last resort," said
Nader, a strong supporter of solar power.
"He has deceived the country. He has de
ceived and misled us."
Has he? Part of the problem is semantic.
How do you define "Last resort?" How much
nuclear energy is too much—or not enough?
A look at federal budget figures shows
Carter has proposed trimming spending for
nuclear power and increasing money for
solar energy this year. But the nuclear
budget still will be more than 1 Vi times as big
as the solar one.
On Monday, in a message to the European
Nuclear Conference, Carter said: "Although

nuclear power is not without problems, we
recognize that its benefits are significant."
During his campaign for the presidency,
Carter said: "U.S. dependence on nuclear
power should be kept to the minimum
necessary to meet all our needs . . . Atomic
power . . . should be relegated to a last
priority as far as energy sources are con
cerned . . . Our excessive emphasis on
atomic power should be severely reduced."
Since becoming president, Carter has
proposed speeding up the licensing of nuc
lear power plants, a move he says he still
supports.
"I think it does not contribute to safety to
have a bureaucratic nightmare or maze of
red tape as licensing and siting decisions are
made," Carter said when asked whether the
accident at the Three Mile Island power
plant near Harrisburg, Pa., had changed his
mind about the proposal.
"I think anything we can do to clarify the
procedure and to make it more open, more
clear, more obvious to the American people

what issues are involved would be a step in
the right direction."
Carter noted that the United States gets
about 13 percent of its electricity from nuc
lear power. "There is no way for us to aban
don the nuclear supply of energy in our
country in the foreseeable future," he said.
On Monday, meeting with some of the
leaders of the Sunday protest—the nation's
largest anti-nuclear rally—Carter repeated:
"It is out of the question to pre-emptorily
shut down all nuclear power plants in the
country."
Last summer, after a summit meeting in
Bonn, Carter and other leaders issued a
communique saying: "The further de
velopment of nuclear energy is essential and
the reduction in the execution of nuclear
power programs has to be reversed."
Does this kind of talk conflict with Carter's
campaign statements?
In May 1978, at a meeting in Washington
with a group of editors and news directors,
the president was reminded of his "last re

sort" remark and asked: "When and why
have you changed your position?"
He replied: "I haven't changed my posi
tion. I always made it clear. . . that our first
emphasis ought to be on conservation ... I
think that we should increase our produc
tion of coal and renew an effort to encour
age additional use of solar power, cut down
on imports ... To the extent that all those
efforts are not successful, we ought to make
up the difference with atomic power ... I
always made it clear and still feel that there is
a significant role to be played by nuclear
power."
In the budget he submitted to Congress
for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, Carter
estimated that spending for nuclear power
would total $970 million, down 11 percent
from last year. He estimated that spending
for solar power would total $597 million, up
24 percent from last year. In terms of new
spending authority, Carter asked for $937
million for nuclear energy, down 16 percent
from fiscal 1979, and $589 million for solar

power, up 13 percent from the previous
year.
He said the federal government "should
take a leadership role in encouraging the
nation to turn as strongly as possible to solar
power as a source for our energy needs."
Carter has remained steadfast in his op
position to the proposed Clinch River
breeder reactor in Tennessee; he used his
first veto as president on a bill that would
have authorized $80 million for the project.
He also has said, however, that he is not
opposed to all types of breeder reactors,
only to the Clinch River project which, he
says, is "a technological dinosaur," and
which would produce plutonium which can
be used to make nuclear weapons.
