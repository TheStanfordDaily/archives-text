# Late rally beats St. Mary's

### Lew Krausse 
Two late-inning rallies gave
Stanford a 5-4 win over St.
Mary's yesterday on the losers'
diamond.
After falling behind 4-1 on
the strength of two two-run
homers by St. Mary's in the
early going, Stanford fought
back with a two-run shot by
Phil Wilson in the seventh. The
Cards then pushed two more
across in the eighth to win their
33rd game of the year, against
20 losses.

Jerry Battenberg took the
win with three innings of score
less relief. Stanford coach
Mark Marquess only allowed
his pitchers to go three innings
apiece in preparation for this
weekend's series with Califor
nia.
"We are trying to save the
staff for Cal," Marquess said,
noting that Rob Erwin and
Mark Abbondola would see
the initial mound action today
against Santa Clara (Sunken
Diamond, 2:30 p.m.).
The Cards must sweep their

three-game series with Cal to
remain in the running for the
second Pacific-10 spot in the
NCAA postseason playoffs.
The second-place team in the
Southern Division plays the
winner of the Northern Divi
sion.

ONE OF the reasons Stanford is riding a five-match winning streak is the play of junior Jim Hodges.
Playing from the backcourt, Hodges has a personal winning streak of four matches going into Thursday's
match against fifth-ranked USC.
