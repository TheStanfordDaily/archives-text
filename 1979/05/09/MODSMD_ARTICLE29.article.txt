# USC next after 5-4 win
## Stanford squeaks past Waves 
### Jeff Brandon 
In a minor upset yesterday,
the Stanford men's tennis team
squeaked by Pepperdine 5-4.
In the latest polls, Stanford is
ranked seventh, Pepperdine
sixth. The Cards should now
move ahead of the Waves, and
if they defeat fifth-ranked USC
Thursday they should be at
least No. 5 when the new rank
ings come out.
Pepperdine mixes natives
from five different countries,
giving the team an interna
tional flavor.
South African Eddie Edwards
is the top player for the Waves;
however yesterday he was
moved down to No. 4 because
of shoulder problems. There
fore the Peter Rennert-Eddie
Edwards showdown never
took place. Edwards has the
distinction of being one of the
only two collegians to beat
newly crowned WCT champ
ion John McEnroe in the lat
ter's one-year collegiate
career.
Rennert took advantage of
the switch to tune up for his
matches this weekend with the
No. 1 and No. 4 college players
in the nation, Robert Van't Hof
of USC and Fritz Buehning of
UCLA. He soundly defeated
Edward's replacement Leo
Palin 6-3, 6-2. Rennert basically
won points whenever he
pleased and was never in trou
ble during the match.
Edwards also had no prob
lem at the unfamiliar No. 4
spot. Scott Bondurant was
faced with the unenviable
choice of trying to beat Ed
wards. But the South African
had too many passing shots up
his sleeve.

Bondurant, playing his nor
mal attackinggame, wasblitzed
by a barrage of topspin passing
shots of varied speeds off both
his forehand and his bac
khand.
One thing was for sure: the
Pepperdine ace will not die
from his shoulder injury. He
served extremely well
throughout the match and won
it routinely 6-3, 6-2.
)im Hodges, who coach Dick
Gould said "has won a lot of
big matches for Stanford,"
continued to play well. The
6-foot-2 junior had trouble
serving in the wind, but con
tinued to play well off the
ground.
When Garth Haynes
double-faulted at 5-all in the
first set, Hodges took advan
tage and served out the first
set. The second set was even
tighter as it went to a tie
breaker before Hodges sent a
lob into the wind that Haynes
was unable to return on match
point. The victory gave Hodges
his fourth straight victory in
singles play.
Tim Mayotte dropped the
first three games and the first
set before he was able to get
going. The freshman topped
the smooth Shots Suresh 3-6,
6-4, 6-2 in a match of two great
shot-makers.
In other single matches,
Wave Rocky Vasquez dropped
Lloyd Bourne 6-4,7-5 in the No.

2 match. Pepperdine's Egan
Adams needed three sets to
down freshman Jeff Arons 3-6,
6-4, 6-0 in the No. 5 slot.
So once again going into
doubles the match was knotted
at three. The Cards, however,
are undefeated in this situation
and remained so on the
strength of the No. 2 and No. 3
doubles.
The freshman team of
Mayotte and Arons won the
third doubles rather easily 6-2,
6-2. Second doubles also was
not hard-pressed to emerge
victorious. Hodges and Bon
durant knocked off angled vol
leys enroute to a 6-4, 6-2 win.
Edwards and Haynes topped
Rennert and Bourne in the No.
1 doubles match, 6-4, 6-7, 6-2.
"I was really pleased with the
way our bottom two doubles
teams came through," Gould
said. "In fact, I was generally
pleased with the way the entire
team played. It's always nice to
win the tough matches."
Gould's Cards now must
prepare for USC Thursday and
UCLA Saturday.
"We're facing two of the top
five teams in the nation," said
Gould, whose team improved
its record to 14-3 with the Pep
perdine victory. "We've im
proved every match out this
year and we have no intention
of letting up now."
Robert Van't Hof, although

just a sophomore, is currently
the top-ranked collegiate
player. He leads the attack for
the Trojans who are also 14-3
on the season.
Van't Hof (12-1) has won two
national amateur crowns cap
turing the national amateur
title and the national 21 title. In
addition, last year he took
McEnroe to three sets before
he finally succumbed.
Second man Billy Nealon
brings a 10-5 dual-match re
cord with him to Maples. He
will duel with Lloyd Bourne in
what should be an exciting
match.
The Trojans are the only
team to beat top-ranked UCLA
this year, handing them a 5-4
setback at their home stadium.
Tickets are on sale at the Ath
letic Department for both the
day and night matches. It
should be an exciting day of
tennis starting off with a battle
of freshmen in the center court
match. Roger Knappof USCand
