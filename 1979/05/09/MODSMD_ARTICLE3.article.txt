### Sue Goldfarb 
University Athletic Director Andy
Geiger continued to revamp the Ath
letic Department yesterday with the
appointment of the men's and wo
men's swimming coach, Jim Gaug
hran, as an assistant athletic director.
Gaughran moved into his new post
immediately.
Gaughran's duties include coor
dinating the summer athletic camps
and directing club sports. He will
also perform administrative work re
garding financial aid, the Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for Wo
men, National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation rule interpretations and
Title IX legislation. '
"Jim was and is interested in get
ting into administration," Geiger
said. "We very badly needed some
body to help with club sports ad
ministration and Jim's role is entirely
administrative."
"My feelings about it from the be
ginning were very positive," Gaug
hran said. "I was thinking it was time
fora change in my life. It seemed like
a good time for something to get ex
cited about. This will give me an op
portunity to be more a part of the
athletic department, and the new di
rector is very dynamic. I think Andy
(Geiger) is different than any of the
other athletic directors we've had."
Gaughran said he will give much of
his attention to club sports, and in
tends to give them more emphasis in
the athletic department. "We must

see.to it that the kids involved are not
second class citizens," he said.
Hesaid he plans togive club sports
all the support possible within the
department's financial capabilities.
He added, however, that club sports
are already receiving more financial
support from both the University and
the Athletic Department. He also
said club sports' visibility is on the
rise with more students participating
and more students attending con
tests.
In his 19 years of coaching here,
Gaughran has led two University
teams to national championships,
the 1963 water polo team and the
1967 men's swimming team. His
teams have consistently been in the
top 10 in the past 10 years, and he has
coached 40 individual national
champions.
Replacing Gaughran as women's
swimming coach will be Claudia Kolb
Thomas, his assistant forthe past two
years. A search for the new men's
swimming coach is underway.
Gaughran has a spot on the selec
tion committee for a new men's
swimming coach. He said that since
he has been a coach for 19 years, he
knows many coaches. He will be di
rectly involved in the early screen
ing, and said the job opening an
nouncement is being sent out this
vveek. A number of applicants have
ilready expressed interest, and
jaughran said he would like to have
he selection made before summer.
