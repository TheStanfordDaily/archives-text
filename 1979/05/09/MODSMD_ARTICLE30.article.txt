## Southern Comfort Ceresino drafted in 13th round 
### 
Ivan Maisel

Like many of his 1600 senior classmates have been doing
for the past two quarters, Gordy Ceresino has been job
hunting. Armed with a resume that listed the many campus
and regional honors he had received for his work in his
field, Ceresino was cockily assured he would get a job
offer.
His prowess was so well-known nationally that he was
invited, along with 60 of his national colleagues, to semi
nars where his talents could be examined and dissected by
the firms interested in him.
The recruiters flocked to these seminars to test Ceresino
concerning employment with their firms. They conducted
interviews, not with questions and brochures, but with
stop watches, statistics and films.
Gordy Ceresino is a linebacker and those seminars were
the collegiate postseason all-star games. The "recruiters,"
the scouts from the National Football League's 28 teams,
evidently did not think Ceresino could help their "firms,"
because when the teams got together for their annual lot
tery last week, Ceresino was not among the 336 draftees.
Not getting drafted on the first day was akin to a slap in
the face of the immensely proud Ceresino. Being passed
over again on the last day was a punch in the gut.
"I was pretty upset," Ceresino said. "I felt I had done
everything necessary there was to do to get drafted. At
worst, I thought (I would be picked) the sixth or seventh
round (of 12). All of a sudden everything fell through."
Little did Ceresino know that when the rest of the league
passed over him they were playing right into the hands of
Bill Walsh and the San Francisco 49ers. When Walsh sensed
during the later rounds that Ceresino was going to be left
out in the cold, he had him phoned to tell him not to worry.
"There was a chance he was going to get drafted in the
later rounds," Walsh said, "but we were hoping no one
would pick him."
"I talked to coach Walsh on Saturday morning," Cere
sino said "Coach Norb Hecker (ex-Stanford defensive
coordinator and now with the 49ers) called Friday after
noon and asked me not to do anything without calling them
first.
"Coach Walsh talked to me first as a friend and then we
discussed business," Ceresino said. "FHe said my best
chance would be with the 49ers, that I had been first on
their inside linebacking list."

Walsh blamed Ceresino's size and speed as two of the
reasons he was overlooked.
"His (numbers) just didn't turn out as well. In the all-star
games he was out-gunned sizewise by the other linebac
kers."
Six feet is considered to be too small to play the middle in
professional football; it doesn't even merit considering on
the outside, where 6-feet-4-inches are needed to cut off the
overhead passing lanes.
There are exceptions to these standards (middle
linebacker Ed Simonini of Baltimore is roughly Ceresino's
size, as was ex-All-Pro Nick Buoniconti), but in this age of
"Big Brother" computer evaluation, items such as intensity
and past performance take a back seat to height, weight and
40-yard dash times.
Having coached Ceresino for the past two years, Walsh
didn't need a Univac to tell him how good Ceresino was.
The 49ers signed the Bluebonnet Bowl's Most Valuable
Player to a three-year contract Monday.
Three-year contracts are usually reserved for All-
Americans, 1000-yard rushers and Outland Trophy win
ners. Ceresino was not even drafted; in the NFL, that is.
Ceresino is a native Canadian, and as such, had solid
offers from two Canadian Football League teams.
"I seriously considered the Canadian offers when I didn't
get drafted here," Ceresino said. "Once the 49ers con
tacted me, I used the CFL as leverage. They helped my
contract."
Ceresino is one of four members of the 49er Stanford
Alumni Club. Fullback Phil Francis was the first man chosen
on Friday â€” the opening pick of the seventh round. Walsh
also signed offensive lineman Gene Engle and will sign tight
end Mitch Pleis today.
"The 49ers looked like the best location," said Engle,
who was also contacted by Minnesota, Philadelphia and
Oakland. "My strongest suit is my pass-blocking, and I
know from last year that Walsh will pass a lot."
Pleis called his chance with the 49ers a "fantastic, great
opportunity. My agent is taking care of the negotiations,
but I will sign Wednesday regardless of what happens."
Now that San Francisco has plucked their head coach and
four players off the Farm, there is only one part of the
Stanford football program they have failed to plunder.
Somebody guard the Band Shak.
