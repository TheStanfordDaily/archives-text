Question: What's the most
popular sport in China?
a)Kung-Fu, b)Rik-Shaw Races,
c)Basketball.
Answer: According to Stan
ford's own Kimberly Belton,
basketball is the correct
choice. What? Basketball?!
"There are courts all over the
place," Belton said after re
turning from behind the bam
boo curtain. "Basketball's the
number one sport."
Belton spent 10 days touring
the Communist regime with a
team sponsored by the ABA
USA, an organization that
promotes trips such as this one
in preparation for the Olym
pics. The trip was taken to
China in particular with the in
tent of helping to solidify the
new friendship between the
two countries. The team was
one of the first American bas
ketball squads ever to travel to
China and their stay was a sig
nificant piece of diplomacy,
not to mention basketball
evangelism.
The junior power forward,
who has three outstanding
seasons with the Cardinals, was
in hot company while in the
Orient. His team roster reads
like an NCAA championship
program. Kiki Vandewege of
UCLA, Kyle Macy of Kentucky,
Bill Hanzlik of Notre Dame,

and Carl Nicks of Indiana State
are just a few of the illustrious
names. They played five
games—three in Peking and
two in Shanghai—against
Chinese Army and Ail-Star
teams.
Are the Chinese any good?
"They're catching up." Bel
ton said, "and pretty soon
they'll be able to compete with
the rest of the world in the
Olympics. We held some
clinics to teach them some new
techniques that they can in
corporate and things like this
are helping them out a lot."
The teams definitely showed
promise according to Belton,
and they had some big players.
The biggest on any of the
squads they played was a seven
foot-six-inch Mongolian who
would pose a formidible threat
in any league.
As China's favorite pastime,
basketball has a great follow
ing. The games were seen on
television across the nation
and attendance averaged bet
ween 18 and 20 thousand green,
blue and grey worksuited fans.
Belton described the atmos
phere in a Chinese arena as
awesome.
"When you take the floor
there's silence and the only
sound they'll make is to clap
for a good play or go 'ahh!'"
Belton said. "I mean 18

thousand 'ahh's' all at once is a
little frightening. Most of the
time, though, they were so
quiet you had to look up some
times to make sure they were
still there. Then all you see is
green, blue and grey."
The team was shown around
the country quite a bit. They
were definitely shown what the
Chinese wanted them to see,
but Belton said he couldn't
help but notice much of the
country as it really was.

His impressions were that
there was an incredible
number of people and much of
the country looked poor. But
he also emphasized that the
nation wasn't backward at all,
which was the report after the
revolution. Their exchanges
with the Chinese people were
limited by the language but
Belton said "We could com
municate some. We ex
changed slang and they asked
us about disco."

Those who saw the team
members knew who they were
but they knew them only by
number since the games were
on televsion. The people
would just stare at the Ameri
cans and say nothing.
"You'd be shopping or
something and you'd feel like
you were being watched.
When vou'd turn around there
would be people 10 deep, just
looking at you. Some of them
had never seen an American.
Most had never seen a black
American, and hardly any had
ever seen a really tall black
American," Belton said.
Much of the trip was very
diplomatic and according to
Belton, the team members and
coaches were treated as dig
nitaries.
"We got the royal treat
ment," Belton said.
The banquet toasts were
centered on mutual friendship
and compatability and there
was a real feeling on both sides
that this type of visit is an im
portant part of developing a
good relationship between the
United States and China. All
the U.S. officers in China at
tended the games with their
Oriental counterparts.
"I felt like a real trailblazer,"
Belton related. "We were
some of the first Americans to
visit China this way and there
was a conscious effort to really
start something, to solidify our
friendship. Maybe in 10 years it
wouldn't be so special, but
now it was really exciting."
The country is still Com
munist and the U.S. is still
democratic, but there is a seri
ous attempt going on to make
the relationship a smooth one.
Trips like this one are the ones
that can make a difference.
"You know you're in China,
there's no doubt, but you just
have to deal with it," Belton
said. "They were really
friendly."
