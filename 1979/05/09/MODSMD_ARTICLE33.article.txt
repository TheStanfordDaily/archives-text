### Steve Pearson 
Stanford's women's tennis
team sent its representatives to
compete in last weekend's
NorCal Intercollegiate Champ
ionships, and the result was as
expected: domination.
The Cardinals garnered a
total of 30 team points, well
ahead of runner-up California
which finished with 14 3 /4.
Other teams competing in
cluded San Jose State, Santa
Clara and the remaining mem
bers of Stanford's Northern
California Athletic Confer
ence; Fresno State, University
of Pacific and University of San
Francisco.
In the singles competition,
three out of the four
semifinalists were Cards.
Top-seeded Kathy Jordan of
Stanford advanced to the finals
by defeating teammate Sue
Rasmussen 6-4, 6-0.
Rasmussen, the seventh
seed, had an excellent tour
nament, defeating fourth
seeded Eve Herrera of Cal 7-6,
4-6, 6-4 in the quarterfinals.
Coach Anne Gould said, "Sue
played well throughout the
tournament; it was probably
her best performance of the
year."
In the othersemifinals match
Cardinal Alycia Moulton de
feated Cal's Beth Fernbacher to
get a shot at Jordan in the fi
nals. She gave Jordan a real
contest, but fell in three sets to
her teammate, 6-2, 5-7, 6-2.
Other Cardinal singles
players in the tournament in
cluded Caryn Hertel, who lost
7-5, 6-2 to fifth-seeded Kelley
O'Keefe of Santa Clara. Stan
ford's Julia Leighton was de
feated by her teammate Hertel
in an earlier round by the score
of 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, while Card
Lisa Gordon had the ill fortune
of facing Jordan in the round of
16, losing to her 6-0, 6-0.
The finals of the doubles
competition was not com
pleted due to scheduling de

lays, the teams in contention
being Stanford's Jordan and
Hertel and Cal's Fernbacher
and Mallory Lynch. Jordan and
Hertel advanced to the finals
by defeating fellow Cards
Rasmussen and Leighton 6-3,
6-1 in the semis. The Stanford
team of Moulton and Cordon

where they were defeated 7-6,
6-1 by Fernbacher and Lynch.
The weekend performance
of the Cardinal women was
highly encouraging as they
gear up to meet Southern
California rival UCLA this Fri
day. The Bruins are the third
ranked team in the country be
hind USC and Stanford, but
they did defeat Stanford 5-4 on
April 6 in Los Angeles. Stanford
should fare better on its home
courts. The Cards will be
playing, however, without the
services of three-time Ail-
American Diane Morrison who
recently left the team to turn
professional.
UCLA is led by its own Ail-
American, Dana Gilbert, and
boasts a strong, deep lineup.
Freshman Kathy O'Brien, along
with transfers Lucy Gordon
and Anne Henrickson, form
the core of the Bruin team that
will attempt to take two straight
from the Cards. The match
promises to be close and excit
ing.
As one of the highlighted
matches of the year, the
Stanford-UCLA contest will be
divided between the courts at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium
and Maples Pavilion. The third
through sixth singles and sec
ond and third doubles will be
played outdoors in the stadium
beginning at 1 p.m. Friday. The
match will then move into
Maples- at 6:30 p.m. for the
number one and two singles
and number one doubles
matches.

seed, had an excellent tour
nament, defeating fourth
seeded Eve Herrera of Cal 7-6,
4-6, 6-4 in the quarterfinals.
Coach Anne Gould said, "Sue
played well throughout the
tournament; it was probably
her best performance of the
year."
In the othersemifinals match
Cardinal Alycia Moulton de
feated Cal's Beth Fernbacher to
get a shot at Jordan in the fi
nals. She gave Jordan a real
contest, but fell in three sets to

players in the tournament in
cluded Caryn Hertel, who lost

The finals of the doubles
competition was not com
pleted due to scheduling de

lays, the teams in contention
being Stanford's Jordan and
Hertel and Cal's Fernbacher
and Mallory Lynch. Jordan and
Hertel advanced to the finals
by defeating fellow Cards
Rasmussen and Leighton 6-3,
6-1 in the semis. The Stanford
team of Moulton and Cordon
also made it into the semifinals
where they were defeated 7-6,
6-1 by Fernbacher and Lynch.
The weekend performance
of the Cardinal women was
highly encouraging as they
gear up to meet Southern
California rival UCLA this Fri
day. The Bruins are the third
ranked team in the country be
hind USC and Stanford, but
they did defeat Stanford 5-4 on
April 6 in Los Angeles. Stanford
should fare better on its home
courts. The Cards will be
playing, however, without the
services of three-time Ail-
American Diane Morrison who
recently left the team to turn
professional.
UCLA is led by its own Ail-
American, Dana Gilbert, and
boasts a strong, deep lineup.
Freshman Kathy O'Brien, along
with transfers Lucy Gordon
and Anne Henrickson, form
the core of the Bruin team that
will attempt to take two straight
from the Cards. The match
promises to be close and excit
ing.
As one of the highlighted
matches of the year, the
Stanford-UCLA contest will be
divided between the courts at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium
and Maples Pavilion. The third
through sixth singles and sec
ond and third doubles will be
played outdoors in the stadium
beginning at 1 p.m. Friday. The
match will then move into
Maples- at 6:30 p.m. for the
number one and two singles
and number one doubles
matches.
