# Win preps crew for Big Row
## 
### Gray Maxwell 
The Stanford Crew traveled
to Lexington Reservoir on
Saturday to battle the ele
ments, the California Highway
Patrol, and the Santa Clara and
HumboldtStatecrews. Despite
poor conditions, the men's
varsity eight edged out Santa
Clara to rebound after the dis
appointing loss to Irvine last
week.
It rained throughout the day
and a terrific wind whipped
down the 2000 meter course to
make rowing difficult and mis
erable. The water was rough
enough, in fact, to dislodge the
dock from its mooring, which
made launching a tricky mat
ter. Also adding to the crews'
woes was a shortage of parking
space. California Highway Pat

rolmen were kept busy for
three hours attempting to cite
the oarsmen who were parked
alongside the Santa Clara
boathouse.
The men's rrovice eight was
the first Stanford boat to
launch and raced Santa Clara,
Humboldt and Los Gatos High
School. The Cardinal boat
finished third, one-half length
behind Santa Clara and one
length behind Humboldt.
The women's novice eight
was also defeated, crossing the
line after Santa Clara (who
won), Santa Barbara and St.
Mary's.
A timely called "power 10"
moved the men's JV eight past
Humboldt at the 1000 meter
mark, but the JVs sprinted a bit

too late to make up the narrow
margin separating them from
Santa Clara. Santa Clara
squeezed out a narrow, two
seat victory. The men's varsity
eight jumped to an early lead
and was able to hold off a Santa
Clara spring to beat the SC boat
by one-half length. Finishing
third and fourth in the final
event of the wet and chilly day
were Lake Merritt and the
Humboldt heavyweights.
The "Big Row," the annual
meet with California, will be
held this upcoming Saturday,
May 12, at Redwood Shores,
Stanford's home course. The
Cal race will be Stanford's final
before the Pac-10 Champion
ships (also to be held at Red
wood Shores) and the Western
Sprints.
