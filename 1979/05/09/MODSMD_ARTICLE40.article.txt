U.S. ship aids Vietnam refugees
Aboard the USS Robert E. Peary — This American
warship turned relief center, nursery and obstet
rics ward steamed into Thai waters yesterday with
448 Vietnamese refugees huddled in the shade of
its rocket launching pad and the canvas stretched
over its flight deck.
Below, a 5-day-old boy lay in an incubator the
ship's doctor had improvised out of cardboard
boxes and a light bulb. Two women were nine
months pregnant.
Cmdr. William Mathis, skipper of the 4000-ton
frigate that picked the refugees off their drifting
vessel Saturday, had cut his crew's normal daily
water ration of 25 gallons a man to 11 gallons to
provide the Vietnamese unlimited supplies.
fhe USS Robert E. Peary was on a routine run
from Singapore to the Thai coastal resort of Pattaya
when Lt. j.g. William Bevil of Pittsburgh spotted
the disabled 55-foot refugee boat — both its en
gines broken down — drifting about 80 miles off
the Malaysian coast.
Mathis said the refugee vessel was carpeted bow
to stern with refugees. Crewmen found only one
bag of rice, no fuel and a limited water supply.
Israeli jets attack south Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli jets attacked targets in
southern Lebanon yesterday and buzzed Beirut
while Palestinian guerrilla leader Yasser Arafat was
making a speech in which he said America was a
"snake's head'' that must be crushed.
Arafat's command said three civilians were
wounded when Israeli warplanes strafed the coas
tal highway between the Zahrani River and Abu al
Aswad, 30 miles north of the Israeli' border.
Arafat said jets also raided the southern Leba
non town of Bissariyeh, 32 miles from Beirut, but
there was no immediate confirmation.
In Tel Aviv, the military command said its
warplanes bombed "terrorist concentrations"
twice yesterday. All planes returned safely to the
base, the Command said.
The third straight day of air raids brought the
reported casualty toll of Palestinians and Lebanese
to 66 dead and 143 wounded in reprisal attacks
Israel mounted since it signed its peace treaty with
Egypt March 26.
Both Egypt and the United States attempted to
pressure Israel into halting its attacks, but Prime
Minister Menachem Begin was resolute to con
tinue them.
Begin offered a peace treaty with Lebanon on

Monday, which was immediately rejected. He
threatened at the same time to continue attacking
Palestinian strongholds.
Blumenthal ups inflation estimate
Washington — Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal admitted yesterday the Carter administra
tion had "screwed up" in predicting that inflation
would be held to 7.4 percent this year. He raised
the estimate to at least BV2 percent.
"I hope it's not too far above that. . . I think it is
obviously now not possible for us to hit the kind of
target we predicted. That's out," Blumenthal told a
Senate appropriations subcommittee.
Inflation averaged 9 percent in 1978.
The increase brings the administration's infla
tion forecast nearly into line with the predictions
of most private economists. By comparison, the
Senate has proposed a 1980 budget based on 8.2
percent inflation rate and the House Budget
Committee used a figure of 7.7 percent.
Despite the higher prediction, Blumenthal said,
a trend toward lower prices should become appa
rent this fall.
"The president is right when he says we can look
forward to bad inflation figures for several more
months," he said. "In all probability, it will be
summer or early fall before we see a real im
provement."
Defense says White 'in conflict'
San Francisco — Dan White was "in conflict all
his life" between wanting to be a free spirit and
wanting to be a responsible citizen, a defense
psychiatrist testified yesterday.
Dr. Martin Blinder said Mayor George Moscone
and Supervisor Harvey Milk, shot dead by White
last Nov. 27, were the "flesh personification" of all
the pressures that had been building inside White
for several years.
White was portrayed at his murder trial yester
day as an idealistic political novice who quickly
became frustrated with elective office and fell into
irrational behavior — including mysterious disap
pearances from his job.
Several of White's former campaign workers
and long-time friends said White gained weight
during the months he was a member of the Board
of Supervisors, and talked of how he felt thwarted
by the demands of committee work.
White's former campaign manager, Raymond
Sloan, said White was "not politically experi
enced, but he had tremendous sense of purpose."
He said White believed he could do something

about the crime rate in San Francisco, but that the
"legislative process was taking its toll. Dan had
trouble with that, it was wearing him down."
Wayne's condition unchanged
Los Angeles — Actor John Wayne remained in
stable condition yesterday as doctors at UCLA
Medical Center prepared to start experimental
treatments for a cancer that invaded the movie
star's intestines.
Hospital spokesman Al Hicks said a final deci
sion hadn't been made on the type of treatment
Wayne will undergo or when it will begin. The
actor, who entered the hospital May 1, has volun
teered for a cancer research project.
Surgeons removed Wayne's cancerous stomach
about four months ago. The new cancerwas found
May 2, during an operation to remove an intestinal
blockage.
LBJ's daughter replaces Abzug
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has de
cided to appoint Lynda Bird Robb as chairwoman
of the National Advisory Committee for Women,
the post which former Rep. Bella Abzug held until
Carter fired her last January, it was learned yester
day.
A White House source, who asked not to be
identified, said the announcement was expected
today.
Robb is the wife of Virginia Lt. Gov. Charles
Robb and the daughter of the late President Lyn
don Johnson.
