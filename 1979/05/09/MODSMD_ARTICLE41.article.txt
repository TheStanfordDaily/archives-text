No parking for gas
Campus Police Chief Marvin Her
rington-has warned drivers they face
a $50 fine and tow away if they park,
lock and leave their cars on Campus
Drive at night to be toward the front
of the line for gas the following
morning at Campus Shell.
Owners of five cars who did this
Monday night, May 7, were con
tacted by police and told to move
theircars. The cars were parked start
ing around midnight after being left
without lights on the two-lane road
way. This constitutes a serious safety
hazard, Herrington indicated.
Unlike most stations, Campus
Shell has no parking lane adjacent to
its gas pumps.

Correction
In the article "Cays fight 'normal'
outlook of society" printed in yes
terday's Daily, Cam Smith was incor
rectly identified as president of the
Gay People's Union. Actually, Smith
is a Steering Committee member, as
there is no president of the organiza
tion. The Daily regrets the error.
