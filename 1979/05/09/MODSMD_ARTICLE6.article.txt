# University confronts increasing debt level
## 
### Mike Charlson 
University outstanding debt,
rapidly approaching the $90 million
level requiring nearly $11 million in
service (principal and interest pay
ments) annually, has prompted the
business office to undertake a major
analysis of the University's debt
carrying capacity, the Board of Trus
tees was told in a report on debt at its
meeting in San Francisco.
With authorized debt now totaling
$90.5 million, the University now in
tends a detailed look at income pro
jections, assets, balance sheets and

debt projections this summer, ac
cording to William Massy, vice presi
dent for business and finance.
While Massy said he does not be
lieve the University is in any trouble,
he said the study is designed to in
sure that the University will not ex
ceed its debt-carrying capacity with
major capital projects presently
being planned.

Meanwhile, trustees yesterday ap
proved architects to serve as consul
tants in planning for the proposed
new student residence which is ex
pected 10 house 800 undergraduates
beginning in autumn 1982.
Ironically, if given final approval,
the new residence is expected to be
financed almost entirely through
borrowing which could increase
University outstanding debt more
than $25 million.
Trustees approved appointment of
the architectural firm of Esherick,
Homsey, Dodge & Davis of San Fran
cisco to serve as consultants in plan
ning, according to Robert Nerrie,
Planning Office project manager.
According to Massy, the issue of
debt has some trustees worried. "It's
always a touchy issue," he said, not
ing that overextension in some cities
such as New York has produced seri
ous problems.
But Massy said the University is
nowhere near a crisis. "I think we're
in excellent shape, actually, with re
spect to existing and currently au
thorized debt. In nominal dollars,
debt is dropping at a very good rate,
and in real dollars, it is dropping re
ally quite dramatically."
Current forecasts predict that the
$11 million in outstanding debt for
academic buildings will drop to $3.1
million by the end of 1983 as gifts
pledged to construct the new Green
Library, Margaret Jacks Hall, History
Corner and other facilities are re
ceived.
Other debt categories such as
housing, student loans, general
plant improvements and the hospi
tal, however, will drop off at normal
rates of amortization, according to
the predictions which do not include
debt potentially incurred for the new
residence or for reconstruction of
Building 120 of the Quad, presently
in its final planning stages.
University administrators expect
the board to authorize $4.5 million in
debt next month to pay for the Build
ing 120 project. It is the only project
for which trustees have given even
preliminary approval.

All projects scheduled for consid
eration after Building 120 will not be
approved until after Massy's office
completes its study.
"I do not believe the University is
overextending itself," Massy said,
"but we will not go forward with the
student housing (or other) project(s)
unless we're convinced we can do so
without overextending ourselves.
"I think based on what we've seen
so far, the University can handle the
student housing project," he said,
but "we're going to be cautious."
Massy said a similar study con
ducted about four years ago, before
heavy borrowing to build several
new academic facilities occurred,
showed that the "University was way
under any reasonable debt
carrying-capacity figure."
But now with additional borrowing
and with increased interest rates, the
situation may be different.
The trustee report stated that the •
University annually spends $10.8
million to pay off its existing out
standing debt, $3 million of which
comes from the Operating Budget.

financed almost entirely through
borrowing which could increase
University outstanding debt more
than $25 million.
Trustees approved appointment of
the architectural firm of Esherick,
Homsey, Dodge & Davis of San Fran
cisco to serve as consultants in plan
ning, according to Robert Nerrie,
Planning Office project manager.
According to Massy, the issue of
debt has some trustees worried. "It's
always a touchy issue," he said, not
ing that overextension in some cities
such as New York has produced seri
ous problems.
But Massy said the University is
nowhere near a crisis. "I think we're
in excellent shape, actually, with re
spect to existing and currently au
thorized debt. In nominal dollars,
debt is dropping at a very good rate,
and in real dollars, it is dropping re
ally quite dramatically."
Current forecasts predict that the
$11 million in outstanding debt for
academic buildings will drop to $3.1
million by the end of 1983 as gifts
pledged to construct the new Green
Library, Margaret Jacks Hall, History
Corner and other facilities are re
ceived.
Other debt categories such as
housing, student loans, general
plant improvements and the hospi
tal, however, will drop off at normal
rates of amortization, according to
the predictions which do not include
debt potentially incurred for the new
residence or for reconstruction of
Building 120 of the Quad, presently
in its final planning stages.
University administrators expect
the board to authorize $4.5 million in
debt next month to pay for the Build
ing 120 project. It is the only project
for which trustees have given even
preliminary approval.

All projects scheduled for consid
eration after Building 120 will not be
approved until after Massy's office
completes its study.
"I do not believe the University is
overextending itself," Massy said,
"but we will not go forward with the
student housing (or other) project(s)
unless we're convinced we can do so
without overextending ourselves.
"I think based on what we've seen
so far, the University can handle the
student housing project," he said,
but "we're going to be cautious."
Massy said a similar study con
ducted about four years ago, before
heavy borrowing to build several
new academic facilities occurred,
showed that the "University was way
under any reasonable debt
carrying-capacity figure."
But now with additional borrowing
and with increased interest rates, the
situation may be different.
The trustee report stated that the •
University annually spends $10.8
million to pay off its existing out
standing debt, $3 million of which
comes from the Operating Budget.
