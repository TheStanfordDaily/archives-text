# Students ignorant about health

Based on the results of a recentquestionnaire, students
here "could stand some improvement" in their basic
knowledge of physical and mental health, said Dr. James
McClenahan, director at Cowell Student Health Center.
McClenahan, in conjunction with Sally Cole, director
of research for the Dean of Student Affairs office, de
vised and distributed the short questinnaire last quarter
to 1000 graduate and undergraduate students. Of the 568
who returned the questionnaire, only three had perfect
scores. All three were pre-med or medical students, said
Cole.
Some students balked at the questions, scribbling
answers like, "My doctor should be the one to tell you
about my cholesterol count, not me." According to
McClenahan, however, medical students and doctors
aren't the only people who should have this kind of
information.
The questions, covering topics from sex to hay fever,
were "reasonable things for sexually active college stu
dents to know," said Cole.
Some 76 percent of the students, however, did not
have a basic knowledge of the menstrual cycle, and 40
percent believed that conception was not possible dur
ing menstruation, the survey showed. The question
which most students (89 percent) had difficulty with,
asked for their normal cholesterol counts (which usually
range from 150-250 mg-percent).
Some 32 percent still believed that acne is definitely
related to diet (a topic which is still being debated) and
70 percent mistakenly believed that a tetanus booster
shot is recommended every five, rather than ten years.
Most students, however, were able to give correct
answers to the rest of the questions and knew, for in
stance, that normal blood pressure in college-age stu
dents ranges from 100 to 140 over 60 to 90 and averages
120 over 70.
According to McClenahan, crying and sleepiness are
often associated with "feeling blue", but are not as some
students thought symptoms of real depression, which is
often marked by weight loss.
Three questions were specifically devoted to common
viruses and diseases. Almost half of the students sur-

veyed said cystitis, unlike gonorrhea or syphilis, is a
non-sexually transmitted disease, McClenahan said.
Hay feverfs usually treated with antihistamines, not de
congestants, the surveyed students correctly realized.
Only conditions caused by bacteria such as strep throat,
gonorrhea, and boils can be effectively treated by an
tibiotics, McClenahan said.
In order to encourage students to think about them
selves and improve students' access to information and
techniques for coping with health problems, McClena
han hopes to set up a health education program here.
"One of the basic problems," said McClenahan, "is
the lack of a health education program, and there are
only a few classes, like Professor (Herant) Katchadou
rian's class on human sexuality, which provide students
with health information."
McClenahan is presently looking for someone to run
the program, which will probably give top priority to
smoking, alcohol, and weight-control problems. It will
take a "relevant approach" to students' present lifes
tyles, said McClenahan.
"You can't tell an overweight twenty-year-old that he's
likely to have a heart attack when he's 60, you have to
ask how he feels about himself today, how his clothes
look and feel on him. Questions like that are more likely
to get reactions, and maybe changes."
In response to students' psychological needs, said
Cole, Prof. Carl Thoreson and graduate student Linda
Powell, both of the Education Dept., hope to begin a
new class on stress management. The class, possibly
dorm-based, should "help students better identify
stress-provoking sources and develop techniques for
coping with them," said Cole.
Just what forms the programs will take, will also de
pend on students' responses to yet another question
naire which will be sent out later this quarter to 1500
more students, McClenahan said. This questionnaire
will include sections on health knowledge, student
opinions about the Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices on campus—including the Cowell Student Health
Center—and a third section regarding students' physical
and mental health-related attitudes and behavior.

smoking, alcohol, and weight-control problems. It will
take a "relevant approach" to students' present lifes
tyles, said McClenahan.
"You can't tell an overweight twenty-year-old that he's
likely to have a heart attack when he's 60, you have to
ask how he feels about himself today, how his clothes
look and feel on him. Questions like that are more likely
to get reactions, and maybe changes."
In response to students' psychological needs, said
Cole, Prof. Carl Thoreson and graduate student Linda
Powell, both of the Education Dept., hope to begin a
new class on stress management. The class, possibly
dorm-based, should "help students better identify
stress-provoking sources and develop techniques for
coping with them," said Cole.
Just what forms the programs will take, will also de
pend on students' responses to yet another question
naire which will be sent out later this quarter to 1500
more students, McClenahan said. This questionnaire
will include sections on health knowledge, student
opinions about the Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices on campus—including the Cowell Student Health
Center—and a third section regarding students' physical
and mental health-related attitudes and behavior.
Based on the results of a recentquestionnaire, students
here "could stand some improvement" in their basic
knowledge of physical and mental health, said Dr. James
McClenahan, director at Cowell Student Health Center.
McClenahan, in conjunction with Sally Cole, director
of research for the Dean of Student Affairs office, de
vised and distributed the short questinnaire last quarter
to 1000 graduate and undergraduate students. Of the 568
who returned the questionnaire, only three had perfect
scores. All three were pre-med or medical students, said
Cole.
Some students balked at the questions, scribbling
answers like, "My doctor should be the one to tell you
about my cholesterol count, not me." According to
McClenahan, however, medical students and doctors
aren't the only people who should have this kind of
information.
The questions, covering topics from sex to hay fever,
were "reasonable things for sexually active college stu
dents to know," said Cole.
Some 76 percent of the students, however, did not
have a basic knowledge of the menstrual cycle, and 40
percent believed that conception was not possible dur
ing menstruation, the survey showed. The question
which most students (89 percent) had difficulty with,
asked for their normal cholesterol counts (which usually
range from 150-250 mg-percent).
Some 32 percent still believed that acne is definitely
related to diet (a topic which is still being debated) and
70 percent mistakenly believed that a tetanus booster
shot is recommended every five, rather than ten years.
Most students, however, were able to give correct
answers to the rest of the questions and knew, for in
stance, that normal blood pressure in college-age stu
dents ranges from 100 to 140 over 60 to 90 and averages
120 over 70.
According to McClenahan, crying and sleepiness are
often associated with "feeling blue", but are not as some
students thought symptoms of real depression, which is
often marked by weight loss.
Three questions were specifically devoted to common
viruses and diseases. Almost half of the students sur-

veyed said cystitis, unlike gonorrhea or syphilis, is a
non-sexually transmitted disease, McClenahan said.
Hay feverfs usually treated with antihistamines, not de
congestants, the surveyed students correctly realized.
Only conditions caused by bacteria such as strep throat,
gonorrhea, and boils can be effectively treated by an
tibiotics, McClenahan said.
In order to encourage students to think about them
selves and improve students' access to information and
techniques for coping with health problems, McClena
han hopes to set up a health education program here.
"One of the basic problems," said McClenahan, "is
the lack of a health education program, and there are
only a few classes, like Professor (Herant) Katchadou
rian's class on human sexuality, which provide students
with health information."
McClenahan is presently looking for someone to run
the program, which will probably give top priority to
smoking, alcohol, and weight-control problems. It will
take a "relevant approach" to students' present lifes
tyles, said McClenahan.
