# Hwang to attend prestigious playwrights conference
## 
### Michael London 
After only two years of writ
ing plays, David Hwang, a
senior here, has been selected
to attend the prestigious Na
tional Playwrights Conference
back east this summer.
The four-week conference is
sponsored by the Eugene
O'Neill Theater Center in
Waterford, Conn. It offers
talented playwrights the op
portunity to work intensively
with some ot the nation's
foremost directors, actors and
drama critics.
Hwang and 12 other playw
rights were chosen from a pool
of over 1300 applicants, many
of whom are established writ
ers with extensive experience
in professional theater, televi
sion and film. Hwang is one of
the youngest writers to attend
the conference since its birth
in 1966.
"It's all been too good to be
lieve," said the 21-year-old
creative writing major.
For admission to the confer
ence, Hwang submitted a full
length original play, FOB,
which has a cast of three. The
work was recently presented,
under Hwang's direction, at

Junipero House in Wilbur Hall.
It will also be presented tomor
row night at UC-Berkeley.
Hwang's interest in the thea
ter is only recently acquired. "I
saw my first play when I was a
senior in high school," he said.
Two years later he wrote his
first play. "It was terrible," he
recalls. But with the encour
agement of Asst. English
Prof. John L'Heureux, Hwang's
confidence and ability grew
quickly.
Two plots
Hwang describes his
award-winning FOB as a por
trayal of the effects of assimila
tion on Asian Americans. The
title refers to "Fresh Off the
Boat" immigrants. On one
level the play is a
conventionally-plotted drama
about three young Chinese
Americans living in Los
Angeles. But Hwang also
blends in a mythological sub
plot, with characters based on
traditional Chinese gods and
folk heroes.
At the playwrights confer
ence, Hwang will work closely
with a prominent director and
a "dramaturg" — a critic or
similar theater professional.

They will aid Hwang in revising
the script and will also direct
the two or more "staged read
ings" that are presented to the
public.
The format, said Hwang, "is
geared to the playwright. It al
lows him to continually rework
the play with feedback from
the directors, the actors and
the audience."
According to Hwang, more
than half of the plays staged at
the conference have "future
lives," and go on to be pro
duced elsewhere.
Hwang, a Chinese American
born and raised in Los Angeles,
said he hopes that FOB will en
courage the growth of Asian
American drama.
"The idea of Asian American
theater has been developed
just in the last decade," he
explained. "In the past our
identities have always been de
fined by the mass-media, more
so than for blacks or chicanos.
The stereotypes that exist,
especially the image of the
'model minority,' don't accu
rately describe the Asian
American experience."
The young playwright said
he worries that FOB may also
build false impressions.
"The play depicts atypical
immigrants who are better off
than most," he explained.
"This has the danger of creat
ing new stereotypes and be
cause there is so little Asian
American theater, anything
that rises to prominence gets
taken as a standard. This prob
lem can't be overcome until
more Asian Americans begin to
write."
Experimental modes
Hwang is currently prepar
ing for a new play by research
ing Asian American history. He
plans to continue writing in
experimental modes, and cre
dits much of his interest in ex
perimental theater to playw
right Sam Shepard, with whom
he worked closely last summer
at a writer's clinic in Orange
County.
Despite the honor of being
selected for the National
Playwrights Conference,
Hwang remains very modest
about his writing career.
"I want to be really careful
about taking this (the confer
ence) in the right way," he
said. "It doesn't mean that I'm
a 'playwright' or that I've made
it."
But it's a good start.
