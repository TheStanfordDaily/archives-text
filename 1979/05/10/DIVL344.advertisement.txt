11. 10-minutc swim.
Anybody who's taken a Red Cross swim course knows how
tough it can be.
There's a good reason.
We believe drowning is a serious business.
I .ast year alone, we taught 2,589,203 Americans not to
drown —in the seven dillerent swim courses wc offer all across
the country. (Incidentally, most of the teaching —as with almost
everything American Red Cross does —is done by dedicated
volunteers.)
A good many ol the youngsters not only arc learning to
keep themselves sate. Thousands upon thousands of them arc
learning to become lifcsavcrs.
And the life they save —may be your own.
