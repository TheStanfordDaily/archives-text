# University police: A highly trained group
## 
### Nonnie Gerber 
A decade ago, they were a group of
public safety officers with virtually no
more training than the average civi
lian.
Today, the officers of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety on the
whole have undergone more exten
sive training than most other law en
forcement officers.
Officially incorporated as a private
police department in March 1972
under the auspices of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department, the
Department of Public Safety is com
prised of 28 deputized patrol officers
and 22 community service officers in
parking control and building sec
urity.
Prior to the formation of the pre
sent department, the campus was
patrolled by an informal group of of
ficers deputized by the sheriff. How
ever, disturbed by the performance
of unqualified officers, the sheriff
withdrew their deputization around
1969.
For the next three years an unau
thorized police department oper
ated without a set of standards and,
consequently, was very ineffective,
according to Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington.
Student unrest
Special Sheriff's Department offic
ers were also assigned to campus
during those days of student unrest.
But, as Herrington explained, "The
problem with that system was that
there was no constant group of offic
ers who were always on campus and,
therefore, could be familiar with the
students and the environs."
In August 1971 a University com
mittee was formed to look into the
formation of a campus police force.

The basic problem facing the com
mittee was that the University was
not authorized under the California
Penal Code to set up its own depart
ment as a privately owned institu
tion.
Since Stanford is an unincorpo
rated area, it falls under the legal
jurisdiction of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff. Because of the need
for adequate coverage and familiarity
with the campus, the committee re
jected incorporating into Palo Alto or
contracting directly with the Sheriff's
Department.
Instead, the committee recom
mended that the University
negotiate its own agreement with the
sheriff.
Memorandum
Finally, in March 1972, a
memorandum was drawn up which
established the present Department
of Public Safety. The major provision
which the sheriff required was that
he have oversight over all the de
partment's activities, which meant
that all case reports would go to the
sheriff, who has the right to review all
department files, and the option to
take over all investigations.
According to Herrington, the Uni
versity department deals with about
98 percent of all campus cases. "The
2 percent that we do not deal with are
cases involving homicide, rape and
major thefts. We are required to
notify the Sheriff's Department as
soon as we are aware of a campus
felony case. Most times they do take
over â€” it's up to their discretion."
Because a new sheriff took office
in January, there is a possibility that
the original memorandum, revised
in 1974, may be revised once more,
