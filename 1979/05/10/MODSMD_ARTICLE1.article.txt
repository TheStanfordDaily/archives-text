# University police: A highly trained group
## 
### Nonnie Gerber 
A decade ago, they were a group of
public safety officers with virtually no
more training than the average civi
lian.
Today, the officers of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety on the
whole have undergone more exten
sive training than most other law en
forcement officers.
Officially incorporated as a private
police department in March 1972
under the auspices of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department, the
Department of Public Safety is com
prised of 28 deputized patrol officers
and 22 community service officers in
parking control and building sec
urity.
Prior to the formation of the pre
sent department, the campus was
patrolled by an informal group of of
ficers deputized by the sheriff. How
ever, disturbed by the performance
of unqualified officers, the sheriff
withdrew their deputization around
1969.
For the next three years an unau
thorized police department oper
ated without a set of standards and,
consequently, was very ineffective,
according to Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington.
Student unrest
Special Sheriff's Department offic
ers were also assigned to campus
during those days of student unrest.
But, as Herrington explained, "The
problem with that system was that
there was no constant group of offic
ers who were always on campus and,
therefore, could be familiar with the
students and the environs."
In August 1971 a University com
mittee was formed to look into the
formation of a campus police force.

The basic problem facing the com
mittee was that the University was
not authorized under the California
Penal Code to set up its own depart
ment as a privately owned institu
tion.
Since Stanford is an unincorpo
rated area, it falls under the legal
jurisdiction of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff. Because of the need
for adequate coverage and familiarity
with the campus, the committee re
jected incorporating into Palo Alto or
contracting directly with the Sheriff's
Department.
Instead, the committee recom
mended that the University
negotiate its own agreement with the
sheriff.
Memorandum
Finally, in March 1972, a
memorandum was drawn up which
established the present Department
of Public Safety. The major provision
which the sheriff required was that
he have oversight over all the de
partment's activities, which meant
that all case reports would go to the
sheriff, who has the right to review all
department files, and the option to
take over all investigations.
According to Herrington, the Uni
versity department deals with about
98 percent of all campus cases. "The
2 percent that we do not deal with are
cases involving homicide, rape and
major thefts. We are required to
notify the Sheriff's Department as
soon as we are aware of a campus
felony case. Most times they do take
over — it's up to their discretion."
Because a new sheriff took office
in January, there is a possibility that
the original memorandum, revised
in 1974, may be revised once more,


Raoul Niemeyer
according to Herrington.
There have been a couple of pre
liminary discussions on that issue, al
though there are no commitments
on either side, he said.
"From my standpoint, it would be
more efficient. The problem with our
present system is that there is too
much duplication of work. When the
Sheriff's Department takes over an
investigation, a great deal of the
work gets done twice. We're the first
on the scene anyway and the present
procedure takes up too much un
necessary time and money."
Frequent duplication
Despite the frequent duplication
of efforts, department statistics on
reported crime shows an overall de
cline in the crime rate over the past
three years.
The reason for this "is nothing de
finite you can point your finger at,
but one reason is the stronger, more
vigorous enforcement that has been
going on for the past three or four
years," according to Lt. Marvin
Moore. "The professional status of
our department has really im
proved."
According to Herrington, the
crime rate here is comparable to that
of surrounding communities of
equal size. Yet the range of the prob
lems that the department here must
deal with is much broader than the
police of any local community, he
said.
Not only must the department deal
with the typical crimes that happen
everywhere, but also with situations
unique to academic institutions, like
concerts and sporting events.
The fact that Stanford is owned by
a Board of Trustees rather than by
private individuals, creates a very dif
ferent situation than is found
elsewhere, Herrington said.
"Since most of the property is
owned by the Board of Trustees, if a
person sees someone breaking in
somewhere to steal, the person
might report it, but it is just as likely
that he won't."
Herrington points to the fact that
another major difference between
working in a city rather than a private
university is the constant turnover of
the student population.
"Every two years at Stanford we
have a 50 percent turnover in the
population. Therefore, of necessity,

we end up doing the same programs
over and over again."
Because Stanford is a private in
stitution, department officers are re
serve deputies, not regular deputies.
While wielding the same powers as
any other police officer while on
duty, the University is the only juris
diction in which they are allowed to
exercise police power. Once off
duty, department officers cannot
carry a gun and lose their police
powers.
Only the deputized patrol officers,
or DPOs, are invested with full police
powers that enable them to issue ci
tations or apprehend offenders
while on duty.
The community service officers, or
CSOs, are essentially security
watchmen, according to Sgt. Ernest
Brooks. University employees, the
CSOs are authorized to write some
parking citations, but their basic duty
is to lock doors and windows.

take over all investigations.
According to Herrington, the Uni
versity department deals with about
98 percent of all campus cases. "The
2 percent that we do not deal with are
cases involving homicide, rape and
major thefts. We are required to
notify the Sheriff's Department as
soon as we are aware of a campus
felony case. Most times they do take
over — it's up to their discretion."
Because a new sheriff took office
in January, there is a possibility that
the original memorandum, revised
in 1974, may be revised once more,


Raoul Niemeyer
according to Herrington.
There have been a couple of pre
liminary discussions on that issue, al
though there are no commitments
on either side, he said.
"From my standpoint, it would be
more efficient. The problem with our
present system is that there is too
much duplication of work. When the
Sheriff's Department takes over an
investigation, a great deal of the
work gets done twice. We're the first
on the scene anyway and the present
procedure takes up too much un
necessary time and money."
Frequent duplication
Despite the frequent duplication
of efforts, department statistics on
reported crime shows an overall de
cline in the crime rate over the past
three years.
The reason for this "is nothing de
finite you can point your finger at,
but one reason is the stronger, more
vigorous enforcement that has been
going on for the past three or four
years," according to Lt. Marvin
Moore. "The professional status of
our department has really im
proved."
According to Herrington, the
crime rate here is comparable to that
of surrounding communities of
equal size. Yet the range of the prob
lems that the department here must
deal with is much broader than the
police of any local community, he
said.
Not only must the department deal
with the typical crimes that happen
everywhere, but also with situations
unique to academic institutions, like
concerts and sporting events.
The fact that Stanford is owned by
a Board of Trustees rather than by
private individuals, creates a very dif
ferent situation than is found
elsewhere, Herrington said.
"Since most of the property is
owned by the Board of Trustees, if a
person sees someone breaking in
somewhere to steal, the person
might report it, but it is just as likely
that he won't."
Herrington points to the fact that
another major difference between
working in a city rather than a private
university is the constant turnover of
the student population.
"Every two years at Stanford we
have a 50 percent turnover in the
population. Therefore, of necessity,

we end up doing the same programs
over and over again."
Because Stanford is a private in
stitution, department officers are re
serve deputies, not regular deputies.
While wielding the same powers as
any other police officer while on
duty, the University is the only juris
diction in which they are allowed to
exercise police power. Once off
duty, department officers cannot
carry a gun and lose their police
powers.
Only the deputized patrol officers,
or DPOs, are invested with full police
powers that enable them to issue ci
tations or apprehend offenders
while on duty.
The community service officers, or
CSOs, are essentially security
watchmen, according to Sgt. Ernest
Brooks. University employees, the
CSOs are authorized to write some
parking citations, but their basic duty
is to lock doors and windows.
A decade ago, they were a group of
public safety officers with virtually no
more training than the average civi
lian.
Today, the officers of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety on the
whole have undergone more exten
sive training than most other law en
forcement officers.
Officially incorporated as a private
police department in March 1972
under the auspices of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department, the
Department of Public Safety is com
prised of 28 deputized patrol officers
and 22 community service officers in
parking control and building sec
urity.
Prior to the formation of the pre
sent department, the campus was
patrolled by an informal group of of
ficers deputized by the sheriff. How
ever, disturbed by the performance
of unqualified officers, the sheriff
withdrew their deputization around
1969.
For the next three years an unau
thorized police department oper
ated without a set of standards and,
consequently, was very ineffective,
according to Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington.
Student unrest
Special Sheriff's Department offic
ers were also assigned to campus
during those days of student unrest.
But, as Herrington explained, "The
problem with that system was that
there was no constant group of offic
ers who were always on campus and,
therefore, could be familiar with the
students and the environs."
In August 1971 a University com
mittee was formed to look into the
formation of a campus police force.

The basic problem facing the com
mittee was that the University was
not authorized under the California
Penal Code to set up its own depart
ment as a privately owned institu
tion.
Since Stanford is an unincorpo
rated area, it falls under the legal
jurisdiction of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff. Because of the need
for adequate coverage and familiarity
with the campus, the committee re
jected incorporating into Palo Alto or
contracting directly with the Sheriff's
Department.
Instead, the committee recom
mended that the University
negotiate its own agreement with the
sheriff.
Memorandum
Finally, in March 1972, a
memorandum was drawn up which
established the present Department
of Public Safety. The major provision
which the sheriff required was that
he have oversight over all the de
partment's activities, which meant
that all case reports would go to the
sheriff, who has the right to review all
department files, and the option to
take over all investigations.
According to Herrington, the Uni
versity department deals with about
98 percent of all campus cases. "The
2 percent that we do not deal with are
