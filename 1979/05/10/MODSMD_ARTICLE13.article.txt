# Phi Beta Kappa selecting members
## 
### Andrew Rich 
For over 200 years, Phi Beta Kappa has
been the most prestigious honorary
college organization in the country. In a
week or two, approximately 12 percent
of Stanford's graduating class and
about 40 exceptional juniors, will be
elected for membership in this national
society.
Who are these lucky few, and why
will they be elected?
The secretary of the Stanford chapter
of Phi Beta Kappa, Don Price, is a cer
tified public accountant with the con
troller's office. Price took over the job
of organizing and overseeing the selec
tion process while he was associate
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, and it has followed him
around since then.
According to Price, there are four
words which characterize the search
for prospective members: "excellence,
substance, coherence and breadth."
ButStantord'sPhi Beta Kappa chapter
doesn't find these qualities readily av
ailable in a large number of students
here.
"We have difficulty finding 12 per
cent who meet our criteria. There are
plenty of students with high grades, but
what are they getting their A's in? What
are they doing outside their major?"
Price asked.
'Like a cafeteria'
In an attempt to judge students in
relation to the four principles, Phi Beta
Kappa members review a candidate's
transcript to examine such things as
whether the student is "going through
the Courses and Degrees catalogue like
a cafeteria," Price said. "We don't like

that for Phi Betas. It doesn't show any
coherence of study."
Phi Beta Kappa would rather that stu
dents "take a whole sequence, and not
just jump around," said Price. "I think
coherence is a way to judge the quality
of a student's coursework."
Other considerations are how heavy
a class load the student has taken and
how well rounded that load has been.
"Part of our purpose is to encourage
students to take a broad, liberal educa
tion," said Price.
Subjective
The actual selection, Price admitted,
is "a very subjective process." It begins
with a computerized listing of all
seniors with a Letter Grade Indicator
(LCI) of 3.6 or above, and all juniors
with an LCI of 3.7 or more. The LCI is a
type of grade-point-average. According
to Price, this listing, which is done after
winter quarter, limits the prospective
candidates to about one-third of the
senior class. Included on the listing is
the number of units, the number of A's,
and the percentage of A's to other
grades.
Price pointed out that these statistics
only limit the pool and don't necessar
ily set the guidelines for election to Phi
Beta Kappa. For example, students can
be recommended by their department
for candidacy.
Once the pool of prospective candi
dates has been determined, a group of
Phi Beta Kappas, usually juniors who
have been elected the previous year,
review the candidates' transcripts. This
is done anonymously, with each trans
cript represented by a number to elimi
nate possible subjectivity by there

viewers.
Paul Weichselbaum, a senior elected
to Phi Beta Kappa last year, is one such
student reviewer. The students work in
pairs and usually review students who
have the same majors as they do.
"We have a much better idea of
which course, taught which quarter,
had the hardest teacher," Weichsel
baum said. These reviewers, who Price
termed a "great help" in the selection
process, examine each candidate in
light of the four principles of the or
ganization.
The student Phi Betas divide the
transcripts into three categories: yes,
no, and marginal. These decisions are
passed along to a nine-member Execu
tive Council, which comes up with final
recommendations.
In mid-May, a general meeting is cal
led for all members of the Stanford
chapter, which, according to Price, is a
"tremendous number." The whole soc
iety then elects the candidates, and
those who choose to join are initiated
before graduation.
Almost all students elected to Phi
Beta Kappa join the organization, Price
said. During the 1960s some students
refused acceptance for personal
reasons, Price added that some of these
students wrote later and asked to be
admitted. They were accepted.
Retroactive review
Between the election, which is an
nounced in the Daily in late May, and the
initiation in June, students who feel
they were slighted may ask for a re
troactive review of their transcripts.
There is always the possibility of clerical
error or extenuating circumstances.
