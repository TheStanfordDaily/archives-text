## Drivers wait hours in line for gas 
### 
As long as there is hope dur
ing a crisis all is not lost. This is
true even during an energy
crisis, as was demonstrated last
weekend, when Bay Area driv
ers endured the worst
gasoline-buying weekend
since the Arab oil embargo of
1974 and '75.
Most stations were closed on
Saturday, and those that were
open had only limited supplies
of gasoline at record-breaking
prices. Waiting time at the
pumps ran upwards of 30 mi
nutes in most places, fist fights
brokeoutas customers waited,
and frantic motorists called the
California Highway Patrol hop
ing that they would know
where gas could be purchased.
They didn't.
At the Fill-em-Fast gas station
in Palo Alto, drivers waited for
over three hours for a tanker
truck to arrive with a shipment
of the precious liquid. The
young attendant on duty said
that a truck was due in around 4
p.m. but that it could not be
relied on to show. People
waited however; they were
undaunted.
About six people had parked
next to the pumps to wait for
the coming of the fuel.
"Frankly, I hope it doesn't
come, the attendant said. "It
means a lot more work, and the
people really get rowdy when
they have to wait like this."
As a matter of fact, he con
tinued, not too long ago a
tanker truck that was expected
to arrive at an appointed time
did not show up for four days.
It could easily happen again,
he emphasized. And even if
the truck does show up, there
is always the possibility that it
will only be carrying one or two
types of gas, instead of the
regular-unleaded-premium
variety. In other words, you

waits your turn and you takes
your chances.
People seemed to have diffe
rent reasons for waiting. One
man waited because he had no
choice; he did not have
enough fuel to return home.
Another was there because he
needed to top off the tank fora
trip to the airport. The two
women in the green sports car
appeared to be there because
they knew the man in the car
behind theirs; it was more of a
social gathering for them. Two
things united them: they all
needed gas, and they all be
lieved that the truck would
come.
Around 5 p.m. the truck had
not yet arrived. Some of the
troops had begun to get hun
gry. At a fast-food outlet across
the street, a hamburger and a
milk-shake cost about the
same as two gallons of gas
would — when the truck came.
It looked like it was going to be
a long wait, so many of the
people left their cars by the
pumpsand went to buy dinner.
They all brought the food back
to the cars, of course, just in
case the truck came while they
were eating. The people were
undaunted.
By 6 p.m. as the sun dropped
behind a neighboring building
and the air became a bit chilly,
the people began to doubt.
Perhaps there had been
another station open earlier;
perhaps it was foolish to have
decided to wait for the truck.
Of course, by now, everyone
knew that the minute one of
them left the pumps, the truck
would arrive. So the people
waited.
All of this time, other drivers
pulled into the station, think
ing they had found a place to
fill up, only to be told that there
was no gas. Some, on hearing

the news, stared blankly at the
lines of cars leading to the
pumps, scratched their heads,
and drove away. Others simply
pulled in behind the last car to
wait their turn at the pumps.
However, there were those
who scoffed at the entire show
of faith. Some passers-by cal
led the people stupid for wait
ing. Some tempted them with
unconfirmed rumors of other
open stations "just down the
street." The people who were
waiting for the truck were
scorned by all, but they re
mained undaunted.
"Perhaps the driver stopped
for dinner," said one of the
more optimistic motorists.
"Maybe he isn't coming at all,"
said another. Desperation was
setting in, but they were com
mitted.
Not even the attendant
seemed to appreciate the de
termination exhibited by the
would-be customers. At 7 p.m.
came the announcement, "If
the truck hasn't come by 8 p.m.
nobody gets served," said the
boy-in-charge.
Did that mean that if the
truck came at 8:05 the atten
dant wouldn't even serve the
few who had been waiting
since 4 p.m.? "Look, 8:30 is
quitting time," he explained,
"and I don't see why I should
have to stay past my quitting
time." And still the people
waited.
Finally, one of the drivers
who did not have enough gas
to return home decided to set
out on a one-way mission to
find some gas or to run out
while looking. It appeared
hopeless, since no one could
believe that a gas station would
still be open that late. To be
lieve that would be to admit
that it had been unwise to re

main, waiting for the truck.
It turned out that there were
at least two gas stations, with
gas at a price, within a few
miles of Fill-em-Fast. After a
short drive to another gas sta
tion, a brief 10-minute wait,
and an outlay of 96.9 cents/
gallon, victory could have been
achieved by all.
It had been available all
along. It had been within reach
of all the people at Fill-em-Fast
all the time that they had been
waiting, only a few miles away.
Yet, by the time the lone driver
had returned from his recon
naissance mission with news of
the refueling post, the others
had left.
They had waited until the
very last minute, hoping to be
on hand for the arrival of the
fabled tanker. It was not until
close to 8 p.m. that the last of
the faithful left the site of the
empty pumps. Their fates were
unknown; their futures uncer
tain.
They had waited in vain.
Now they might not find gas
until Tuesday.

the refueling post, the others
had left.
They had waited until the
very last minute, hoping to be
on hand for the arrival of the
fabled tanker. It was not until
close to 8 p.m. that the last of
the faithful left the site of the
empty pumps. Their fates were

As long as there is hope dur
ing a crisis all is not lost. This is
true even during an energy
crisis, as was demonstrated last
weekend, when Bay Area driv
ers endured the worst
gasoline-buying weekend
since the Arab oil embargo of
1974 and '75.
Most stations were closed on
Saturday, and those that were
open had only limited supplies
of gasoline at record-breaking
prices. Waiting time at the
pumps ran upwards of 30 mi
nutes in most places, fist fights
brokeoutas customers waited,
and frantic motorists called the
California Highway Patrol hop
ing that they would know
where gas could be purchased.
They didn't.
At the Fill-em-Fast gas station
in Palo Alto, drivers waited for
over three hours for a tanker
truck to arrive with a shipment
of the precious liquid. The
young attendant on duty said
that a truck was due in around 4
p.m. but that it could not be
relied on to show. People
waited however; they were
undaunted.
About six people had parked
next to the pumps to wait for
the coming of the fuel.
"Frankly, I hope it doesn't
come, the attendant said. "It
means a lot more work, and the
people really get rowdy when
they have to wait like this."
As a matter of fact, he con
tinued, not too long ago a
tanker truck that was expected
to arrive at an appointed time
did not show up for four days.
It could easily happen again,
he emphasized. And even if
the truck does show up, there
is always the possibility that it
will only be carrying one or two
types of gas, instead of the
regular-unleaded-premium
variety. In other words, you

waits your turn and you takes
your chances.
People seemed to have diffe
rent reasons for waiting. One
man waited because he had no
choice; he did not have
enough fuel to return home.
Another was there because he
needed to top off the tank fora
trip to the airport. The two
women in the green sports car
appeared to be there because
they knew the man in the car
behind theirs; it was more of a
social gathering for them. Two
things united them: they all
needed gas, and they all be
lieved that the truck would
come.
Around 5 p.m. the truck had
not yet arrived. Some of the
troops had begun to get hun
gry. At a fast-food outlet across
the street, a hamburger and a
milk-shake cost about the
same as two gallons of gas
would — when the truck came.
It looked like it was going to be
a long wait, so many of the
people left their cars by the
pumpsand went to buy dinner.
They all brought the food back
to the cars, of course, just in
case the truck came while they
were eating. The people were
undaunted.
By 6 p.m. as the sun dropped
behind a neighboring building
and the air became a bit chilly,
the people began to doubt.
Perhaps there had been
another station open earlier;
perhaps it was foolish to have
decided to wait for the truck.
Of course, by now, everyone
knew that the minute one of
them left the pumps, the truck
would arrive. So the people
waited.
All of this time, other drivers
pulled into the station, think
ing they had found a place to
fill up, only to be told that there
was no gas. Some, on hearing

the news, stared blankly at the
lines of cars leading to the
pumps, scratched their heads,
and drove away. Others simply
pulled in behind the last car to
wait their turn at the pumps.
However, there were those
who scoffed at the entire show
of faith. Some passers-by cal
led the people stupid for wait
ing. Some tempted them with
unconfirmed rumors of other
open stations "just down the
street." The people who were
waiting for the truck were
scorned by all, but they re
mained undaunted.
"Perhaps the driver stopped
for dinner," said one of the
more optimistic motorists.
"Maybe he isn't coming at all,"
said another. Desperation was
setting in, but they were com
mitted.
Not even the attendant
seemed to appreciate the de
termination exhibited by the
would-be customers. At 7 p.m.
came the announcement, "If
the truck hasn't come by 8 p.m.
nobody gets served," said the
boy-in-charge.
Did that mean that if the
truck came at 8:05 the atten
dant wouldn't even serve the
few who had been waiting
since 4 p.m.? "Look, 8:30 is
quitting time," he explained,
"and I don't see why I should
have to stay past my quitting
time." And still the people
waited.
Finally, one of the drivers
who did not have enough gas
to return home decided to set
out on a one-way mission to
find some gas or to run out
while looking. It appeared
hopeless, since no one could
believe that a gas station would
still be open that late. To be
lieve that would be to admit
that it had been unwise to re

main, waiting for the truck.
It turned out that there were
at least two gas stations, with
gas at a price, within a few
miles of Fill-em-Fast. After a
short drive to another gas sta
tion, a brief 10-minute wait,
and an outlay of 96.9 cents/
gallon, victory could have been
achieved by all.
It had been available all
along. It had been within reach
of all the people at Fill-em-Fast
all the time that they had been
waiting, only a few miles away.
Yet, by the time the lone driver
had returned from his recon
naissance mission with news of
the refueling post, the others
had left.
They had waited until the
very last minute, hoping to be
