## Fraternities lack diversity 
### 
After reading Kurt Osenbaugh's furious and
vehement defense of the poor fraternities who
are wrongly and unjustifiably stereotyped
(Daily, May 1), I had to have a good laugh. Is he
really trying to tell us that there is no difference
between a fraternity as a whole and any other
living group? Let's get serious.
If you look in the fraternity rush book, you will
notice that the most over-used concept in it is
"diversity." Every fraternity is made to appear
diverse, and every member in the system has

ties are famous for should
start in their own houses.

diverse interests.
I agree that, since a frat is made up of different
people, it will, by definition, be somewhat di
verse. What seems to be forgotten is that there is
a large body of interests that most members of
one fraternity will have in common.
A cursory look at some frats will prove that
there are many large human beings in the Delts
and many band members in Theta Xi; those are
only the most obvious groupings. Zetes tend to
be more athletic than Dekes, and so on.
None of this is inherently wrong or bad. But
the fact is that frats are very different from other
living groups, and in very specific directions un
ique to each fraternity. They are, after all, cho
sen selectively, and (remember Darwin?) selec
tivity favors some individuals over others.
It is obvious that fraternities are much more
homogeneous than regular dorm living groups.
Why is any mention of such preferences nega
tively called "stereotyping?" Why is recognizing
the differences in the frats, even in exaggera
tion, such a loathsome sin?
As far as other stereotypes, such as the
"myth" that fraternities drink a lot, frats have

only themselves to blame. The simple fact is that
they do drink more frequently and in higher
quantity than most campus groups. The recent
meeting with Associate Dean of Residential
Education Norm Robinson {Daily, April 30) was
not about alcohol problems in dorms or co-ops,
but alcohol abuse in fraternities. Maybe some of
those community service projects fraternities
are famous for should start in their own houses.
Now I realize that there are very positive sides
to the Greek system, and while I personally
would not join it, it has every right to exist for
those who do want it. I am aware of the freely
given community service of some frats, and of a
generally contributive nature of, again, some
frats.
I don't wish to cast any aspersions whatsoever
on them. After all, each fraternity paints its own
picture, and must bear the responsibility or ir
responsibility of its members' actions,
; whichever is applicable.
The fact that some frats have a negative
stereotype is not the fault of the Big Bad Media,
(although the recent Pizza Express article (Daily,
April 22) was atrocious journalism, it was indeed
the exception to the rule) but the fault of the
fraternity, individually and/or collectively.
Stereotypes don't appear out of thin air—there
is some basis in reality for them to grow from.
Finally, I think that Osenbaugh's crucifixion
of Sue Warnock was an uncalled-for cheap shot.
Warnock wrote a satirical piece (Daily, April 27),
the satire of which may have been taken too far;
in the long run, that is simply a matter of opin
ion.
This, however, in no way justifies a personal
attack on her. Were I a member of a fraternity, I
would be more embarrassed by Osenbaugh's
over-sensitive, reactionary attitude than by
being stereotyped in the first place.
He had every right to refute the article if he
wished, but he should have left the personal
revenge motive out of his article. Osenbaugh's
first assertion was his best—Warnock's article
should have been left unanswered.
