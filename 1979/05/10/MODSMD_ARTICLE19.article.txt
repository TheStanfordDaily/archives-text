# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Sami Suleiman Self-determination needed 
### 
Today, almost every Palestinian in the world is
either in exile, under military occupation, or a
resident of Israel with gravely limited oppor
tunities in a state built and run by other people.
Collectively, the 3.5 million Palestinians have
been stripped of their nationhood. Individually,
they have been the object of various forms of
human rights violations, including the right to
self-determination.
Self-determination is now an accepted princi
ple of international law recognized by the world
community. United Nations General Assembly
resolutions have consistently reaffirmed this
principle, as in the 1948 Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. Article 13(2) of this declaration
states that "everybody has the right to leave any
country including his own and to return to his
country."
As early as 1948, the United Nations recog
nized the Palestinians' right of return to their
homeland. Resolution 194 states . . the re
fugees wishing to return to their homes and live
at peace with their neighbors should be permit
ted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and
that compensation should be paid for the prop
erty of those choosing not to return and for the
loss of or damage to property which, under
principles of international law or in equity,
should be made good by the governments or
authorities responsible."
Ironically enough, in its request for admission
to the United Nations, Israel specifically
pledged to honorthis resolution. Yet, Israel, as a
member state, has ignored its duty to carry out
the U.N. obligations and Charter with respect to
the right of Palestinians to return to their home
land.
Israel has successfully argued, at least in the
United States, that the Palestinians left Palestine
voluntarily from 1947 to 1948, that they could
have accepted the UN Partition Plan of 1947 and
created a Palestinian state, and that, therefore,
Israel cannot be held responsible for their
statelessness.
While it is undoubtedly true that some Pales
tinians left "voluntarily," simply because they
were civilians caught in the crossfire of fighting
forces, many were driven out directly or indi
rectly by the action of armed forces such as the
Haganah and by terrorist forces such as those of
Noble Peace Prize winner Menachem Begin and
his Irgun Zvai Leumi gangs.
Whatever the motive of any Palestinian's de
parture from his country, the Universal Declara
tion on Human Rights has affirmed the individu
al's right to return to his country. It is, after all,
an expected behavior of people under duress to
escape to safety, expecting to return whenever
the emergency is over.
Palestinians, like other people including the
lews themselves, have always maintained the
claim of return to their homeland. Although

some of the Palestinians were given the
privilege of citizenship of convenience by some
of the Arab States, such as Jordan, this cannot
legitimize Israel's claim that such persons are
not entitled to return. Whatever their status, the
Palestinians have been denied by Israel their
right of return.
Israel claims that if a Palestinian state had
been established, as per the Partition Plan of
1947, there would have been no stateless per
sons and the right of return would have been
seriously mitigated. Yet, by 1949, Israel had
seized 23 percent more territory than was desig
nated by the UN Partition Plan for a Jewish state.
By 1967, Israel had seized all of Palestine.
In addition, Israel has consistently opposed
the creation of a Palestinian state on the very
territory which the Partition Plan had allotted to
the Palestinians. Instead, Israel has introduced
the expression "self-rule" which is intended to
replace "self-determination" and thus avoid the
real issue of Palestinian independence while Is
rael continues to violate Palestinians' human
rights.
The continuous denial of the Palestinians'
right to self-determination is a major obstacle in
the path of a just and lasting peace in the Middle
East. In this light, the agreements between Egyp
tian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin, are neither the be
ginnings nor a "true" step toward lasting peace.
Without confronting the major issue of the
Palestinians' right to self-determination and an
independent state, hopes for a just peace will
always remain, unfortunately, mere flirtations
with an ideal.
All parties involved must recognize that the
implementation of this right is not an impossibil
ity. Palestinians could attain their right to self
determination by the Creation of a Palestinian
state on the West Bank of the Jordan River and
Paza with a territorial link between them. The
Palestinian state could then plan in peace with
Israel their common future in the area.
Palestinians whose homes are under Israeli
rule should be offered the right to return or
proper compensation for their property if they
choose not to live under Israeli rule. If the Pales
tinians chose the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion as their sole and legitimate spokesman, as it
is their right to do, then Israel should have to
negotiate with this legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people.
Only in this way can the basis of peace, just
and equitable for both the Israelis and the Pales
tinians, be established. The future of a planned
peaceful coexistence must be built on justice
and not on the bullet-proof vests worn by Sadat
and Begin.

principle, as in the 1948 Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. Article 13(2) of this declaration
states that "everybody has the right to leave any
country including his own and to return to his
country."
As early as 1948, the United Nations recog
nized the Palestinians' right of return to their
homeland. Resolution 194 states . . the re
fugees wishing to return to their homes and live
at peace with their neighbors should be permit
ted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and
that compensation should be paid for the prop
erty of those choosing not to return and for the
loss of or damage to property which, under
principles of international law or in equity,
should be made good by the governments or
authorities responsible."
Ironically enough, in its request for admission
to the United Nations, Israel specifically
pledged to honorthis resolution. Yet, Israel, as a
member state, has ignored its duty to carry out
the U.N. obligations and Charter with respect to
the right of Palestinians to return to their home
land.
Israel has successfully argued, at least in the
United States, that the Palestinians left Palestine
voluntarily from 1947 to 1948, that they could
have accepted the UN Partition Plan of 1947 and
created a Palestinian state, and that, therefore,
Israel cannot be held responsible for their
statelessness.
While it is undoubtedly true that some Pales
tinians left "voluntarily," simply because they
were civilians caught in the crossfire of fighting
forces, many were driven out directly or indi
rectly by the action of armed forces such as the
Haganah and by terrorist forces such as those of
Noble Peace Prize winner Menachem Begin and
his Irgun Zvai Leumi gangs.
Whatever the motive of any Palestinian's de
parture from his country, the Universal Declara
tion on Human Rights has affirmed the individu
al's right to return to his country. It is, after all,
an expected behavior of people under duress to
escape to safety, expecting to return whenever
the emergency is over.
Palestinians, like other people including the
lews themselves, have always maintained the
claim of return to their homeland. Although

some of the Palestinians were given the
privilege of citizenship of convenience by some
of the Arab States, such as Jordan, this cannot
legitimize Israel's claim that such persons are
not entitled to return. Whatever their status, the
Palestinians have been denied by Israel their
right of return.
Israel claims that if a Palestinian state had
been established, as per the Partition Plan of
1947, there would have been no stateless per
sons and the right of return would have been
seriously mitigated. Yet, by 1949, Israel had
seized 23 percent more territory than was desig
nated by the UN Partition Plan for a Jewish state.
By 1967, Israel had seized all of Palestine.
In addition, Israel has consistently opposed
the creation of a Palestinian state on the very
territory which the Partition Plan had allotted to
the Palestinians. Instead, Israel has introduced
the expression "self-rule" which is intended to
replace "self-determination" and thus avoid the
real issue of Palestinian independence while Is
rael continues to violate Palestinians' human
rights.
The continuous denial of the Palestinians'
right to self-determination is a major obstacle in
the path of a just and lasting peace in the Middle
East. In this light, the agreements between Egyp
tian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin, are neither the be
ginnings nor a "true" step toward lasting peace.
Without confronting the major issue of the
Palestinians' right to self-determination and an
independent state, hopes for a just peace will
always remain, unfortunately, mere flirtations
with an ideal.
All parties involved must recognize that the
implementation of this right is not an impossibil
ity. Palestinians could attain their right to self
determination by the Creation of a Palestinian
state on the West Bank of the Jordan River and
Paza with a territorial link between them. The
Palestinian state could then plan in peace with
Israel their common future in the area.
Palestinians whose homes are under Israeli
rule should be offered the right to return or
proper compensation for their property if they
choose not to live under Israeli rule. If the Pales
tinians chose the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion as their sole and legitimate spokesman, as it
is their right to do, then Israel should have to
negotiate with this legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people.
Only in this way can the basis of peace, just
and equitable for both the Israelis and the Pales
tinians, be established. The future of a planned
peaceful coexistence must be built on justice
and not on the bullet-proof vests worn by Sadat
and Begin.

business school.)
Today, almost every Palestinian in the world is
either in exile, under military occupation, or a
resident of Israel with gravely limited oppor
tunities in a state built and run by other people.
Collectively, the 3.5 million Palestinians have
been stripped of their nationhood. Individually,
they have been the object of various forms of
human rights violations, including the right to
self-determination.

ple of international law recognized by the world
