# Banks' class monitors media for biases

The more than 30 students here who faithfully
watched television every day last week were doing
more than guiltily avoiding their homework. In
fact, they were doing their homework.
The students, all members of ASSU Guest Prof.
Dennis Banks' class entitled "Native American De
stiny: Who Controls It?" were monitoring the
three major networks, KQED, as well as the San
Francisco Chronicle and the Examiner to see how
native Americans were portrayed.
Banks said that the networks and advertisers in
general "are showing the Indians in a very primi
tive state. In the movie A Man Called Horse Sioux
people were inaccurately portrayed.'' The movies
are "very insulting, very derogatory and I believe
very vicious," he said.
The students were divided into several groups
to ensure they could watch all prime time TV news
and all other programs that mentioned native
Americans.

"We are not looking for just the positive or the
negative portrayal of Indians, but for all types,"
said Jerry Emory, one of the students. "We hope to
be sensitive to how they are portrayed and where
they are not mentioned."
Banks and the class prepared a "coding sheet"
which outlined what specifics were to be looked
for in order to critically watch and effectively re
cord the data, according to Lisa Foster of Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI). The compiled data will be analyzed by
computer.
Stanford is not the only school working on the
project. Banks is coordinating a program with
Contra Costa College, UCLA, San Francisco State,
UC-Berkeley and Degandadiwadia Quetzalcoatl
University in Davis. According to Banks, at least 95
students watched television for the project last
week.
The class is also reading back issues of T.V.
Guide, looking for mentions of native Americans.

What they have found in issues of the last three
years, according to Banks, is a consistently nega
tive portrayal of native Americans. Program
synopses read "cavalry vs. warring Indians,"
"peaceful settlers imperiled by Indian attackers,"
and "Townspeople worried about marauding In
dians," explained Banks.
Once the project data has been gathered and
analyzed Bankswill determine with attorneyswhat
kind of action needs to be taken. Banks said he
feels that he already has good grounds to file a
class action suit against the major television net
works.
Banks has been talking to advertisers and net
works about their treatment of native Americans
for the past four years. He said that it is hard to
pinpoint who is to blame forthe negative portrayal
of native Americans.
"The only way to get at sensitive movies is to
categorize the movies, pinpoint the portrayals and
organize the people into a strong attack," he said.
