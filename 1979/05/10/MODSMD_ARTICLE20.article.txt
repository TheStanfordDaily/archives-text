I am writing in reference to
the story on copyright law
which appeared on the front
page of the May 7 issue of The
Stanford Daily.
Both the headline and the
caption under the photograph
indicate that much of the
photocopying taking place at
Stanford is illegal. This is not
true and indeed is not the mes
sage carried in the story itself.
Rather, your reporter accu
rately points out that: There is a
clause in the law known as the
Doctrine of Fair Use which
covers most of the photocopy
ing done at Stanford.
This quotation and the entire
tone of the article indicate that
the copyright law at Stanford is
not being frequently violated. I
do think it is very important
that you call this to the atten
tion of your readers.
I think itwouldalsobe useful
to modify the statement in the
story that Harvard University
became the first academic in
stitution to be sued under the
new law. While it is true that a
lawsuit has been instituted
against Harvard, it is under
another section of the law not
connected with photocopying.

As by now experienced resi
dent fellows, we disagree with
the letter to the editor of John
Harris and Brock Fisher (Daily,
May 3). Contrary to their view,
transcripts of RA applicants can
be a useful source of informa
tion in the selection process —
but not for the reasons they
claim.
While everyone we know
recognizes that there is no
simple correlation between
CPA and effectiveness as an
RA, a transcript may signal pos
sible problems. When it does,
these can be explored further
through other evidence in the
folder or during an interview.
To wit:
— Is the transcript consistent
with the rest of the application?
Do we see the same person
there as in the essay and letters
of recommendation? If not,
why?
— A flock of incompletes or
low grades may indicate dif

ficulties in managing time or
following through on tasks un
dertaken (there may be other
explanations also, of course).
— Applicants facing heavy
academic pressures — these
can come from unusually de
manding programs and the
drive for superior performance
as well as from low grades, in
completes, or unit deficiencies
— are likely to be distracted
RAs. Or they may put the RA
job first, to the detriment of
their educational objectives. In
any case, they are likely to feel
the anxiety of divided com
mitments and to do less than
justice to both.
These are the principal
reasons the Res Ed office re
quires transcripts. We agree,
and we hope that all applicants
will supply them. We believe
that such information, when
combined with other evi
dence, helps us do a better job
as we try to make decisions in
the best interest ot the resi
dence system and of the indi
vidual applicant.

Murder condoned
Having read your report
(Daily, May 4) of the Theodore
Streleski case, I sent the follow
ing letter to Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Marilyn
Zecher:
My wife and I simply cannot
believe what has been done
with the murderer of
Mathematics Prof. Karel de-
Leeuw. Has the press inaccu
rately reported this case?
We have a sickness in this
society, whereby men such as

Streleski and Dan White satisfy
their grievances against an in
stitution by murdering its rep
resentatives. The sentence you
have adjudged virtually con
dones that behavior. It is gal
ling to hear that Streleski plans
to continue studying
mathematics during his brief
prison stay, while Karel de-
Leeuw is gone.
I wonder what reaction my
colleagues have to your report.

Your article on Boston Uni
versity History Prof. Howard
Zinn's "resist-the-draft"
speech (Daily, May 2) hit the
nail on the head. Yes, we can
stop war by resisting conscrip
tion!
Just remember the terrible
mistake of World War 11, when
so many innocent Gls were
drafted into a bloody fight in
which they had no real in
terest. Without conscription,

the United States could not
have invaded Europe in 1944.
Think of the lives that would
have been saved, then and la
ter.
If the Europeans had been
left to settle their own busi
ness, to find their own solu
tions, there would have been
no Cold War afterward, there
would have been no McCar
thy, there would have been no
trouble between Jews and
Arabs. But instead of letting the
Germans work things out on
their own continent, we had to
meddle and get involved.
"Democracy, liberty and re
sponsibility," indeed!
We know what the people
who run this country and man
age the draft were real ly after in
attacking Japan and Germany
in 1941: tin, rubber and oil, just
like Zinn says.
More power to you and
Zinn. Keep up the fight for en
lightened self-interest and
peace.

Stanford Daily.
Both the headline and the
caption under the photograph
indicate that much of the
photocopying taking place at
Stanford is illegal. This is not
true and indeed is not the mes
sage carried in the story itself.
Rather, your reporter accu
rately points out that: There is a
clause in the law known as the
Doctrine of Fair Use which
covers most of the photocopy
ing done at Stanford.
This quotation and the entire
tone of the article indicate that
the copyright law at Stanford is
not being frequently violated. I
do think it is very important
that you call this to the atten
tion of your readers.
I think itwouldalsobe useful
to modify the statement in the
story that Harvard University
became the first academic in
stitution to be sued under the
new law. While it is true that a
lawsuit has been instituted
against Harvard, it is under
another section of the law not
connected with photocopying.

Transcripts help
As by now experienced resi
dent fellows, we disagree with
the letter to the editor of John
Harris and Brock Fisher (Daily,
May 3). Contrary to their view,
transcripts of RA applicants can
be a useful source of informa
tion in the selection process —
but not for the reasons they
claim.
While everyone we know
recognizes that there is no
simple correlation between
CPA and effectiveness as an
RA, a transcript may signal pos
sible problems. When it does,
these can be explored further
through other evidence in the
folder or during an interview.
To wit:
— Is the transcript consistent
with the rest of the application?
Do we see the same person
there as in the essay and letters
of recommendation? If not,
why?
— A flock of incompletes or
low grades may indicate dif

ficulties in managing time or
following through on tasks un
dertaken (there may be other
explanations also, of course).
— Applicants facing heavy
academic pressures — these
can come from unusually de
manding programs and the
drive for superior performance
as well as from low grades, in
completes, or unit deficiencies
— are likely to be distracted
RAs. Or they may put the RA
job first, to the detriment of
their educational objectives. In
any case, they are likely to feel
the anxiety of divided com
mitments and to do less than
justice to both.
These are the principal
reasons the Res Ed office re
quires transcripts. We agree,
and we hope that all applicants
will supply them. We believe
that such information, when
combined with other evi
dence, helps us do a better job
as we try to make decisions in
the best interest ot the resi
dence system and of the indi
vidual applicant.

Murder condoned
Having read your report
(Daily, May 4) of the Theodore
Streleski case, I sent the follow
ing letter to Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Marilyn
Zecher:
My wife and I simply cannot
believe what has been done
with the murderer of
Mathematics Prof. Karel de-
Leeuw. Has the press inaccu
rately reported this case?
We have a sickness in this
society, whereby men such as

Streleski and Dan White satisfy
their grievances against an in
stitution by murdering its rep
resentatives. The sentence you
have adjudged virtually con
dones that behavior. It is gal
ling to hear that Streleski plans
to continue studying
mathematics during his brief
prison stay, while Karel de-
Leeuw is gone.
I wonder what reaction my
colleagues have to your report.

Your article on Boston Uni
versity History Prof. Howard
Zinn's "resist-the-draft"
speech (Daily, May 2) hit the
nail on the head. Yes, we can
stop war by resisting conscrip
tion!
Just remember the terrible
mistake of World War 11, when
so many innocent Gls were
drafted into a bloody fight in
which they had no real in
terest. Without conscription,

the United States could not
have invaded Europe in 1944.
Think of the lives that would
have been saved, then and la
ter.
If the Europeans had been
left to settle their own busi
ness, to find their own solu
tions, there would have been
no Cold War afterward, there
would have been no McCar
thy, there would have been no
trouble between Jews and
Arabs. But instead of letting the
Germans work things out on
their own continent, we had to
meddle and get involved.
"Democracy, liberty and re
sponsibility," indeed!
We know what the people
who run this country and man
age the draft were real ly after in
attacking Japan and Germany
in 1941: tin, rubber and oil, just
like Zinn says.
More power to you and
Zinn. Keep up the fight for en
lightened self-interest and
peace.
