# Ten years after New York love-in
## Use of alcohol, sedatives increases

San Francisco (AP) — The generation of
"feed your head" and "do your thing," of
"tune in, turn on and drop out" is no
longer the drug cult it was a decade ago.
But the drugs those much-publicized
youth touted have become woven into the
fabric of American society.
The use of pills and cocaine is on the rise
and marijuana laws have been eased in
many states. This, despite a recent warn
ing by Health, Education and Welfare Sec
retary Joseph Califano that the growing
use of marijuana is becoming a dangerous
problem.
The greater use of "pot," LSD and these
other drugs is a legacy of the '60s genera
tion that reached its peak 10 years ago this
summer at a dazed love-in in upstate New
York — the Woodstock music festival.
But today, many children of the '60s no
longer use these drugs themselves. Many
turned to traditional lifestyles. Some sim
ply burned out. Some, of course, con
tinued on drugs and depended more
deeply on them.
It is difficult to measure drug use in to
day's society in terms of statistics — users
do not stand up to be counted. So, the
words of the experts, the users and limited
studies are the best guide.
Says Dr. David Smith, head of the
Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic: "Many
people from the '60s have turned away

from drugs . . . toward a chemically free
life. They don't use any chemicals, includ
ing alcohol."
According to Smith and other drug ex
perts, psychedelics are still widely used.
But those who take LSD — the hope for
"expanded consciousness" 10 years ago
— learned to do so with a bit more care.
Thus, there are fewer complications than
there were in the '60s.
Alcohol and barbituate abuse, Smith
said, has now replaced LSD as the biggest
drug problem in Haight-Ashbury, the
citadel of drugs in the 19605. Government
drugexperts say this "polydrug" abuse is a
growing problem nationwide.
In the 19605, Haight-Ashbury attracted
youth from around the world to its clog
ged streets, especially in the 1967 "sum
mer of love." They came in beads, beards
and feathers, smoked marijuana, took
speed and LSD and talked of the bright
new civilization they hoped to find.
It didn't come.
Today, a 35-year-old Los Angeles ar
chitect— call him Ron — stands before the
peeling facade of a one-time rock stron
ghold, the Straight Theater on Haight
Street. He says he stopped smoking
marijuana, drinking alcohol and using
psychedelics four years ago.
"I didn't want any foreign substances in
my body," he says, digging at the pave

ment with his jogging shoes.
Even Dr. Timothy Leary, once the high
priest of LSD, says he no longer takes acid.
The number of 25 year olds to 34 year
olds — roughly the Woodstock generation
— who used marijuana at any time in
creased substantially from 1971 to 1977,
according to a nationwide survey made for
NIDA by the Social Research Group of
George Washington University. In 1971,
the percentage was 19. By 1974, it was 30
percent; by 1977, it was 44 percent.
Today, "recreational" use of the illicit
drug has mushroomed in the middle class.
Alcohol and marijuana are the two most
widely used drugs by today's young
people. The 1977 Social Research Group
survey found that 60 percent of high
school graduates and 65 percent of college
graduates had tried marijuana.
The survey also noted a steady trend in
increased use of cocaine, the hypnotic
sedative Quaalude, and PCP — known by
pharmacists as phencyclidine and by users
as "angel dust."
But unlike the children of the '60s
who were intent on expanding conscious
ness — today's youth seem more in
terested in a good time.
Most observers agree the age of flower
power and love began to wane after that
summer.
