# Archaeology group forms to study Chinese findings
## 
### Kathy Bowman 
Lack of up-to-date informa
tion in the expanding field of
Chinese archeology has led to
the organization of a new
group here.
The Project for the Study of
Chinese Archeological Mate
rials, which especially is trying
to inform the public about
Chinese humanistic scholar
ship, was established last fall
and is staffed by Project Coor
dinator Jeffrey Riegel, holder
of a Ph.D. in Chinese, Asian
Languages Prof. Albert Dien
and research assistant David
Fridley.
One of the three major ac
tivities of the project since its
creation has been the organi
zation of a conference on the
archaeology of medieval
China. The theme of the con

ference will be the reconcilia
tion of older records with re
cent archaeological dis
coveries. Dien received a grant
for the conference, which will
be held in San Francisco in
1980.
Also being planned is a
workshop on recently disco
vered texts on South China.
Riegel has received a grant
from the Mellon Foundation to
fund the workshop, to be held
next month.
The project has also pub
lished its first issue of Chinese
Studies in Archaeology, a jour
nal that has translated Chinese
writings into English.
Dien's efforts at informing
the public about Chinese Scho
larship include lectures at vari
ous universities, and taping of
a program for the Mid-Atlantic
states' Public Broadcasting Sys
tem stations. As a member of
the Han Studies Delegation to
China in 1978, Riegel visited ar
cheological sites and met with
major Chinese scholars in
volved in the work. He serves
as a consultant on archeoloei

cal subjects for the China
Council of New York and
Chinese Culture Center in San
Francisco; and was chosen
consultant in a National Geog
graphic expedition to China.
The project is a cooperative
effort between Stanford and
UC-Berkeley.
