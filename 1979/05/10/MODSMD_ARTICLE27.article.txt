/Vew England
New England
Infinity
Probably the most amazing
thing about this album is that it
was co-produced by Kiss' Paul
Stanley, yet is the musical an
tithesis of that group's
schlocky, garage-band brand
of rock. New England sounds
very much like a favorable fu
sion of Boston's crisp, slick,
melodic production with the«
grandiose progressiveness of
Styx, without the repetition of
the former or the pomposity of
the latter.
Lead singer )ohn Fannon,
who sounds like a cross bet
ween Barry Cibb and David
Bowie, displays a surprising
variety of stylistic capability,

both on balladic compositions
such as "Turn Out the Light,"
and on more rocking numbers,
such as "Shoot." Perhaps the
worst thing to be said for this
album is that the lyrics are
often quite disposable, though
this has been true for most
groups working roughly the
same terrain as New England.
In all, an impressive debut,
holding much hope for the fu
ture of New England.
Angel Station
Manfred Mann's Earth Band
Warner Brothers
Artistically, this is Mann's
finest album in some time.
Mann's strength, in more re
cent years, has been in exploit
ing the synthesizer to its tul

lest, exploring its many musical
capabilities. This album is no
exception, demonstrating
Mann's synthesizer adeptness
on a set of mostly mellow
tunes.
Unfortunately, the accessi
bility of this album falls short of
much of Mann's material. This
album contains no airplay
generating "Blinded by the
Light" or "California." Indeed,
even Mann's rendition of Dy
lan's "You Angel You," seem
ingly the album's "single" cut,
doesn't sound like the kind of
song which would get much
play, except perhaps on
album-oriented rock stations.
It appears, then, that Mann will
merely retain the semi-cult
status he has had, with his old

fans buying this album and
those who are not remaining
unaware of the album's exis
tence. Perhaps his next album
will bridge the gap between
Mann's capabilities and his ap
peal to the masses.
Crusader
Chris De Burgh
A&M
This, De Burgh's fourth al
bum, doesn't show many
stylistic changes from his pre
vious albums. De Burgh re
mains the indisputable master
at musical stories which are as
excellent musically as they are
lyrically. Flere again, De Burgh
offers a collection which
iargely consists of ballads.
While no song on the album is
less than pleasant, the high
light of the album is the epic
"Crusader," which chronicles
events about the fall of
Jerusalem. The story is nearly
flawless, a well-structured
example of lyrical economy.
Together, the lyrics and
music create quite nearly a
masterpiece in the field of mus
ical storytelling. Overall, in its
genre, this is as fine an album
as has been released in some
time. In the album's closing
cut, "You and Me," De Burgh
sings "I'll be back, to sing
again." Let's hope so.

Perfect Stranger
Robert Fleischman
Arista
This is an album which
seems like it should be better
than it is. Robert Fleischman,
former lead singer for Journey,
and co-writer of "Wheel in the
Sky" and "Anytime" (among
others), teamed up with
talented producer Jimmy
lovine. The results are less than
impressive. The sound is
nearly perfect, as would be ex
pected because of lovine's
presence. But the songs are,
for the most part, dull. Only
the catchy "All for You" and
the presence of strings on
"Southern Nights" save the
first side from sounding singu
larly non-distinct. The second
side is somewhat better, but
still leaves no lasting impres
sion, much like what is played
on most AM radio: lots of
polish but little substance. If
Fleischman writes more mate
rial comparable to what he
wrote for Journey, we can look
forward to a much better effort
next time around. But pass on
his work for now.

worst thing to be said for this
album is that the lyrics are
often quite disposable, though
this has been true for most
groups working roughly the
same terrain as New England.
In all, an impressive debut,
holding much hope for the fu
ture of New England.
Angel Station
Manfred Mann's Earth Band
Warner Brothers
Artistically, this is Mann's
finest album in some time.
Mann's strength, in more re
cent years, has been in exploit
ing the synthesizer to its tul

lest, exploring its many musical
capabilities. This album is no
exception, demonstrating
Mann's synthesizer adeptness
on a set of mostly mellow
tunes.
Unfortunately, the accessi
bility of this album falls short of
much of Mann's material. This
album contains no airplay
generating "Blinded by the
Light" or "California." Indeed,
even Mann's rendition of Dy
lan's "You Angel You," seem
ingly the album's "single" cut,
doesn't sound like the kind of
song which would get much
play, except perhaps on
album-oriented rock stations.
It appears, then, that Mann will
merely retain the semi-cult
status he has had, with his old

fans buying this album and
those who are not remaining
unaware of the album's exis
tence. Perhaps his next album
will bridge the gap between
Mann's capabilities and his ap
peal to the masses.
Crusader
Chris De Burgh
A&M
This, De Burgh's fourth al
bum, doesn't show many
stylistic changes from his pre
vious albums. De Burgh re
mains the indisputable master
at musical stories which are as
excellent musically as they are
lyrically. Flere again, De Burgh
offers a collection which
iargely consists of ballads.
While no song on the album is
less than pleasant, the high
light of the album is the epic
"Crusader," which chronicles
events about the fall of
Jerusalem. The story is nearly
flawless, a well-structured
example of lyrical economy.
Together, the lyrics and
music create quite nearly a
masterpiece in the field of mus
ical storytelling. Overall, in its
genre, this is as fine an album
as has been released in some
time. In the album's closing
cut, "You and Me," De Burgh
sings "I'll be back, to sing
again." Let's hope so.

Perfect Stranger
Robert Fleischman
Arista
This is an album which
seems like it should be better
than it is. Robert Fleischman,
former lead singer for Journey,
and co-writer of "Wheel in the
Sky" and "Anytime" (among
others), teamed up with
talented producer Jimmy
lovine. The results are less than
impressive. The sound is
nearly perfect, as would be ex
pected because of lovine's
presence. But the songs are,
for the most part, dull. Only
the catchy "All for You" and
the presence of strings on
"Southern Nights" save the
first side from sounding singu
larly non-distinct. The second
side is somewhat better, but
still leaves no lasting impres
sion, much like what is played
on most AM radio: lots of
polish but little substance. If
Fleischman writes more mate
rial comparable to what he
wrote for Journey, we can look
forward to a much better effort
next time around. But pass on
his work for now.

/Vew England
New England
Infinity
Probably the most amazing
thing about this album is that it
was co-produced by Kiss' Paul
Stanley, yet is the musical an
tithesis of that group's
schlocky, garage-band brand
of rock. New England sounds
very much like a favorable fu
sion of Boston's crisp, slick,
melodic production with the«
grandiose progressiveness of
Styx, without the repetition of
the former or the pomposity of
the latter.
Lead singer )ohn Fannon,
who sounds like a cross bet
ween Barry Cibb and David
Bowie, displays a surprising
variety of stylistic capability,

both on balladic compositions
such as "Turn Out the Light,"
and on more rocking numbers,
such as "Shoot." Perhaps the
worst thing to be said for this
album is that the lyrics are
often quite disposable, though
this has been true for most
groups working roughly the
same terrain as New England.
In all, an impressive debut,
