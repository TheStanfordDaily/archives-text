CregKihn (right) will play
the Palo Alto Keystone this
Saturday night at 8. Kihn and
band play a cool, tough brand
of rock that is largely
influenced by the English pop
and rock sounds of the late
'60s.
Kihn has released three
albums on Berkeley's
"Beserkley" label, including
his latest release, Next of
Kihn. Kihn first received
national attention with his
solid cover version of Bruce
Springsteen's "For You,"
which appeared on Kihn's
second album.
Kihn and band are
well-known in Bay Area clubs
for their long record of being
one of the finest club bands in
local history.
