## Casablanca opens 
### 
The orchestra strikes up Cole Porter's "Begin the Be
guine" and suddenly the mood is set. Although the oriental
carpets have yet to be unrolled over the floor of the Toyon
Lounge, there's no doubt that Casablanca is here. Cast
members dance during a break in rehearsal; the women
sophisticated in theirevening gowns and the men gallant in
tuxedos.
"We're trying to create a mood, an atmosphere," says
Douglas Greenfield, the producer. Once again, Toyon Hall
decided to present a show new to campus. The dorm's
Mediterranean architecture suits Casablanca's mood well;
palm trees fitting naturally under arches, brown fans spin
ning slowly from the high ceiling.
"There's music, an orchestra and, of course, Sam (the
pianist at Rick's Cafe Americain) but the show is not a
musical," continues Greenfield. "The songs contribute to
Casablanca but they don't dominate it." The cafe musi
cians, composed largely of LSJUMB members, play such
classics as "Am I Blue?" "It Had To Be You" and Casablan
ca's theme, "As Time Goes By" with a big band sound.
And, then, there is Casablanca's story, the war-time ro
mance of Rick and llsa. The romance contains a moral, too.
Rick must choose between his love for one woman and his
love for humanity. Jeffrey Swisher, the lead in Toyon's
show, says, "I'm playing the part of Rick Blaine, not Hum
phrey Bogart. People shouldn't come expecting to see a
Bogart impersonation."
The movie Casablanca's cast of Bogart, Ingrid Bergman,
Paul Henri, SidneyGreenstreet, Peter Lorre . . . isadifficult
act to follow. Carl Chamberlin, director of the show, says
"We chose Casablanca because of it's challenge. Several â€”
no, all of the roles require strong acting. We know that the
production is well worth the effort though."
Toyon Hall presents Casablanca Thursday through
Saturday at 8:30 p.m.
