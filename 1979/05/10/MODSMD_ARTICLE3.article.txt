The current gas shortage and a
threatened strike by gas station own
ers may cut attendance at next Satur
day's 47th annual Alumni Campus
Conference, according to lulianna
Rogers, assistant director of continu
ing education.
Thus far the conference is 600
people short of the original pro
jected enrollment of 1500, said Ro
gers, who fears that the gas shortage
and a threatened shutdown of all
California gas stations May 17 to 20
will keep enrollment down.
On a whole, however, attendance
at the Alumni Association-sponsored
conference, inaugurated in 1933 as
one of the nation's first continuing

education programs, has been grow
ing over the years, according to Ro
gers.
"We generally receive positive re
sponses to the conference," Rogers
said. "I think alumni appreciate
being able to share Stanford with
other members of the community."
The lecturers selected for this
year's conference, which has "Emi
nence in Teaching" as its theme,
have been judged to be among the
best teachers on campus by current
University students.
The day-long program, to which
the public is also invited, includes a
morning and an afternoon lecture
period. Participants choose from
four lecturers for each period. In ad
dition, President Richard Lyman will

speak at a noontime luncheon in the
Oak Grove behind Bowman Alumni
House.

for the May 19 Conference include

psychology, "The Brain"; Carolyn
Lougee, associate professor of his
