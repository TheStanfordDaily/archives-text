## Laws' technique reigns supreme 
### 
: One of Hubert Laws' first albums tor
[ Atlantic records was entitled Flute By-
I Laws, and the title's double meaning
S was revealing if not prophetic. In the
world of jazz flute, Hubert does set
down the law of the land and has for
over a decade. Much of that artistry was
visible at Laws' Saturday concert at Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
From a technical standpoint, Laws'
playing was flawless. His scales, arpeg
gios, double and triple tonguing reveal
a precision and finesse rare among jazz
flutists. Before Laws' appearance on the
jazz scene, the flute, as it was played by
musicians such as Sam Most and Herbie
Mann, was a relatively undeveloped in
strument. Laws singlehandedly has
raised the technical standards of the in
strument.
Material
Unfortunately, Laws' choice of mate
rial did not match the high standards set
by his technical prowess. Much of it
was riff-based and suffered from seem
ingly endless vamps on two or three

chords. Two pieces, however, did
stand out. The opening number led
into a bluesy riff in 7/4; the unusual
meter befuddled several hand-clappers
in the audience, but posed no problem
to Laws and vibraharpist Woody Mur
ray, both of whom tore through the
song with passion and precision.
The second highpoint of the concert
was a long unaccompanied Laws solo
on piccolo. Laws broke into the solo at a
fierce tempo, but even more remarka
blethan the speed was his amazing flow
of ideas. Picking up the melody of
Monk's "In Walked Bud," Laws trans
formed it into a chromatic scale pattern
and brought it down into the lower and
more resonant range of the piccolo.
This was followed by a swirling sea of
arpeggios, which led back into an en
semble passage.
Gem
The gem of Laws' new group is vib
raharpist Woody Murray. Murray plays
in a wildly percussive style which is re
miniscent of the attack of older and
more driving players such as Lionel

Hampton. Murray has a slight tendency
to rush the tempo, but his technique is
sure and clean. A few years experience
should push him to the pinnacle of his
instrument.
Laws was joined by his sister Debra
who gave a capable rendition of the title
track from Laws' recent album Land of
Passion. Most of the concert was de
voted to the rather lackluster material
which Laws has featured on recent al
bums. The moving transcriptions of
classical pieces, such as "The Rite of
Spring," which highlighted Laws' early
albums, were nowhere to be found.
Matrix, a polished nonet, provided
the lead-in act for Laws' concert, and in
many ways they were the highlight of
the evening. The group features com
plex horn lines which they execute with
ease. Particularly moving were several
lush ballads which showed off the
group's rich resonant tone on ensem
ble passages. They are more of an ar
ranger's group than a soloist's band,
and the arrangements, mostly done by
pianist John Harmon, are extremely
well-done.
