Israelis chase Palestinians
Jerusalem — Israeli troops and U.N. peacekeep
ing forces stood toe-to-toe yesterday in a tense
five-hour confrontation in southern Lebanon be
fore the Israelis gave up their chase of Palestinian
guerrillas and withdrew across the border, a U.N.
spokesman said.
An Israeli army spokesman said about 4UU Israeli
soldiers were involved. He said the incident began
when an army patrol encountered a band ot Pales
tinians attempting to cross the border fence west
of Kiryat Shmona into Israel about 4 a.m. yesterday
(7 p.m. Tuesday PDT).
The spokesman said one Palestinian was
wounded and captured. The rest were chased ac
ross the Israeli-Lebanese border. He said no Is
raelis were injured.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Pales
tine, one of eight guerrilla groups that make up the
Palestine Liberation Organization, claimed re
sponsibility for the attempted raid into Israel.
A PFLP communique said 20 Israeli soldiers were
killed and wounded in the clash. It said the opera
tion was a reprisal for the "barbaric Israeli attacks
against Palestinian and Lebanese citizens."
United Rubber Workers strike
The United Rubber Workers union called 8200
members out on strike at a dozen Uniroyal plants
yesterday in a dramatic showdown with the big tire
maker over President Jimmy Carter's anti-inflation
wage guidelines.
The strike is against the Carter administration as
much as Uniroyal Inc., as the union seeks to win a
new contract that exceeds the'president's volun
tary 7 percent annual ceiling on wage and fringe
benefit increases.
Uniroyal, the nation's third largest tire com
pany, has "pledged to uphold the guidelines,"
company spokesman James Hill said shortly after
the strike began.
The administration has exerted considerable
pressure on Uniroyal and other tire companies to
resist wage settlements that exceed the already
stretched guidelines.
Union President Peter Bommarito, who has
dubbed the walkout "Carter's strike," was unav
ailable for comment yesterday at his headquarters
in Akron, Ohio, but he said earlier that the ad
ministration was responsible for triggering the
walkout.
The union contends it had reached tentative
agreement with Uniroyal on new economic terms
that would have broken Carter's guidelines, but
the company backed out of the deal last month
because of intense government pressure. Un
iroyal denies that it ever had an agreement.

Senate approves rationing plan
Washington — The Senate voted 58-39 yesterday c
to give President Jimmy Carter standby authority s
to ration gasoline in emergencies, after winning r
additional last-minute White House concessions.
Included was a promise from the president not f
to use rationing to ease lines at gasoline stations t
caused by temporary shortages. £
Senate approval sent the measure to the House, I
where action is expected today.
The president also promised to make more i
gasoline available to farmers and to industries en
gaged in producing energy under a compromise ;
reached moments before the Senate showdown. ,
These concessions came in addition to modifi
cations made by the president earlier — modifica- <
tions which the Senate accepted on a 66-30 vote <
shortly before approving the overall plan.
By this vote, senators went along with the presi
dent's decision to change his plan to guarantee a
larger share of rationing coupons to individuals
living in states where average gasoline consump
tion is high.
12 counties adopt rationing plan
More than 10 million gas-craving motorists in 12
California counties became subjects of the state's
emergency odd-even gas rationing plan yesterday
in an effort to cut panicky blocks-long lines at
beleaguered urban service stations. But the im
mediate impact of the plan was hard to gauge.
Lines at stations in the San Francisco Bay Area,
San Jose, San Diego, and some suburban sections
of Los Angeles were shorter than they had been
the last few days.
However, vehicle lines were still wrapped
around corners and stretched for seven blocks in
some parts of the more congested central and
western sections of Los Angeles. Many drivers said
they had delayed filling up until the odd-even
program began.
But in Oakland, a local Texaco dealer called the
rationing plan "a little miracle.
"Yesterday our lines were four blocks long.
Today we've got four people at the pumps. What
do you think of that?"
Psychiatrist testifies for White
San Francisco — Dan White, feeling betrayed by
two men he once admired, was in a "primitive and
uncontrolled rage" when he shot and killed Mayor
■ George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk last
November, a defense psychiatrist said yesterday.
"At the moment he fired the shots, he was sim
ply out of control," said Dr.. George Solomon, a
Fresno psychiatrist who specializes in studies of
stress and violence.

He said White told him during one of four inter
views last month that he was angered when Mos
cone withdrew his pledge to appoint him to the
seat on the Board of Supervisors that he had ab
ruptly resigned 17 days before the killings.
White also had "a sense of betrayal" toward
Milk, the psychiatrist added, because White had
been instrumental in Milk gaining a key committee
assignment after they were both elected to the
board.
But, after White resigned, Milk opposed White's
reappointment to the board.
The third psychiatrist to testify for the defense,
Solomon echoed many of the opinions of the pre
vious two expert witnesses.
The psychiatrist said White had always been
"very afraid of anger ... he had a fear of loss of
control." . _ „
Solomon told the courtroom of Superior Court
Judge Walter Calcagno he could not say with abso
lute certainty that White was legally insane when
he fired the fatal shots.

United Rubber Workers strike
The United Rubber Workers union called 8200
members out on strike at a dozen Uniroyal plants
yesterday in a dramatic showdown with the big tire
maker over President Jimmy Carter's anti-inflation
wage guidelines.
The strike is against the Carter administration as
much as Uniroyal Inc., as the union seeks to win a
new contract that exceeds the'president's volun
tary 7 percent annual ceiling on wage and fringe
benefit increases.
Uniroyal, the nation's third largest tire com
pany, has "pledged to uphold the guidelines,"
company spokesman James Hill said shortly after
the strike began.
The administration has exerted considerable
pressure on Uniroyal and other tire companies to
resist wage settlements that exceed the already
stretched guidelines.
Union President Peter Bommarito, who has
dubbed the walkout "Carter's strike," was unav
ailable for comment yesterday at his headquarters
in Akron, Ohio, but he said earlier that the ad
ministration was responsible for triggering the
walkout.
The union contends it had reached tentative
agreement with Uniroyal on new economic terms
that would have broken Carter's guidelines, but
the company backed out of the deal last month
because of intense government pressure. Un
iroyal denies that it ever had an agreement.

Senate approves rationing plan
Washington — The Senate voted 58-39 yesterday c
to give President Jimmy Carter standby authority s
to ration gasoline in emergencies, after winning r
additional last-minute White House concessions.
Included was a promise from the president not f
to use rationing to ease lines at gasoline stations t
caused by temporary shortages. £
Senate approval sent the measure to the House, I
where action is expected today.
The president also promised to make more i
gasoline available to farmers and to industries en
gaged in producing energy under a compromise ;
reached moments before the Senate showdown. ,
These concessions came in addition to modifi
cations made by the president earlier — modifica- <
tions which the Senate accepted on a 66-30 vote <
shortly before approving the overall plan.
By this vote, senators went along with the presi
dent's decision to change his plan to guarantee a
larger share of rationing coupons to individuals
living in states where average gasoline consump
tion is high.
12 counties adopt rationing plan
More than 10 million gas-craving motorists in 12
California counties became subjects of the state's
emergency odd-even gas rationing plan yesterday
in an effort to cut panicky blocks-long lines at
beleaguered urban service stations. But the im
mediate impact of the plan was hard to gauge.
Lines at stations in the San Francisco Bay Area,
San Jose, San Diego, and some suburban sections
of Los Angeles were shorter than they had been
the last few days.
However, vehicle lines were still wrapped
around corners and stretched for seven blocks in
some parts of the more congested central and
western sections of Los Angeles. Many drivers said
they had delayed filling up until the odd-even
program began.
But in Oakland, a local Texaco dealer called the
rationing plan "a little miracle.
"Yesterday our lines were four blocks long.
Today we've got four people at the pumps. What
do you think of that?"
Psychiatrist testifies for White
San Francisco — Dan White, feeling betrayed by
two men he once admired, was in a "primitive and
uncontrolled rage" when he shot and killed Mayor
■ George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk last
November, a defense psychiatrist said yesterday.
"At the moment he fired the shots, he was sim
ply out of control," said Dr.. George Solomon, a
Fresno psychiatrist who specializes in studies of
stress and violence.

He said White told him during one of four inter
views last month that he was angered when Mos
cone withdrew his pledge to appoint him to the
seat on the Board of Supervisors that he had ab
ruptly resigned 17 days before the killings.
White also had "a sense of betrayal" toward
Milk, the psychiatrist added, because White had
been instrumental in Milk gaining a key committee
assignment after they were both elected to the
board.
But, after White resigned, Milk opposed White's
reappointment to the board.
The third psychiatrist to testify for the defense,
Solomon echoed many of the opinions of the pre
vious two expert witnesses.
The psychiatrist said White had always been
"very afraid of anger ... he had a fear of loss of
control." . _ „
Solomon told the courtroom of Superior Court
Judge Walter Calcagno he could not say with abso
lute certainty that White was legally insane when
he fired the fatal shots.
