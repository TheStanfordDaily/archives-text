# Baker voices reservations
## Vance announces SALT details 
### 
Washington (AP) — The United States and the
Soviet Union, winding up seven years of hard
bargaining, announced agreement yesterday on
a treaty to slow the nuclear arms race.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who
negotiated the settlement on key provisions with
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobryni n, made the
announcement on behalf of President Jimmy
Carter.
Defense Secretary Harold Brown represented
the Pentagon and said "SALT will contribute sig
nificantly to our security."
Brown said even with the treaty, the United
States will have to expand its defense efforts,
particularly its strategic nuclear forces.
Vance emphasized the hope the pact carries
for "a safer America and a safer world."
"The treaty is a message of hope for us, and for
all the people of the world," Vance told reporters
gathered at the White House.
Carter began meeting with members of the
Senate even before the accord was reached.
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker said
he told Carter it is his "strong feeling" that the
treaty will be amended on the Senate floor or
returned for renegotiation.
"He (Carter) asked for help in getting it ratified
and I told him I have strong reservations and that
I continue to lean against it," Baker said. "I really
do not want to vote no on the treaty but I have
serious misgivings."
Asked why Carter was not making the an
nouncement, press aide Jody Powell said Vance
had been the chief treaty negotiator. "Everyone
thought he (Vance) ought to have the honor of
making the announcement."
Carter had predicted completion of a treaty
outline in October 1977. The final round of
negotiations proved difficult, though, as the two
sides jockeyed forterms suitable to theirdefense
needs as well as arms-control objectives.
Toward the end, there was painstaking delay as
U.S. and Soviet negotiators worked on final de

tails surrounding tests of missiles carrying multi
ple warheads and definition of new missiles.
The final text will be put together during the
next two or three weeks by U.S. and Soviet dele
gations in Geneva, Switzerland.
Meanwhile, Vance is continuing his discus
sions with Dobrynin on the time and place for
Carter and Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev to
hold a summit at which the treaty will be signed.
That decision is expected by the end of the week.
The summit is projected for mid-June. The
sites under consideration are Helsinki, Finaldn
land; Stockholm, Sweden; Geneva and Vienna,
Austria.
The treaty requires ratification by the Senate —
a minimum of two-thirds of the senators voting,
or 67 of all 100 vote.
Much of the preliminary Senate opposition is

based on concern over verifying Soviet com
pliance with the accord, especially in view of the
loss of two important U.S. monitoring stations in
Iran and the improvements the Russians will be
able to make in missile accuracy.
The strategic arms limitation treaty, SALT 11,
sets a ceiling of 2250 on the combination of
strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic
missiles each of the superpowers can have
through 1985.
The Soviets, having about 2500 launchers now,
will be required to cut back. The United States is
about 100 under the maximum and, therefore,
has the right to build up to that limit.
Besides slowing the proliferation of destruc
tive weapons, the treaty aims at some improve
ments in these systems, such as missile guidance
systems.
