Washington (AP) — Here is a brief summation
of the proposed SALT II treaty, based on brief
ings by the Carter administration.
Duration: The treaty runs through 1985, with a
protocol that will expire at the end of 1981.
Limits: Each side would be limited initially to a
total of 2400 strategic missiles and bombers. The
overall limit would drop to 2250 in 1981.
Within those limits are subceilings: no more
than 820 land-based missiles with multiple
warheads (MIRVs); no more than 1200 land and
sea-based MIRVs; and no more than 1320 total
MIRVs and bombers equipped with cruise mis
siles.
Arms reductions: The Soviets would, by the end
of 1981, have to destroy some 270 aging missiles,
according to American estimates. They would
also not be allowed to deploy the SS-16, a mobile
missile they have tested with mixed success. The

United States might have to destroy some 35
B-52s which are currently in mothballs in 1984 or
1985, depending on when its new Trident sub
marines are deployed.
New weapons allowed: The two sides would
each be allowed to equip their bombers with
new cruise missiles, and to develop one new
land-based missile. After 1981, it could be a
mobile missile. Each would be allowed to de
velop as many new types of submarine-based
missiles as it wished.
In addition, each side would be able to sub
stantially increase the number of warheads it de
ploys: from 8500 to more than 12,000 for the
United States and from 4000 to more than 8000
for the Soviets.
And, the Soviet Backfire bomber would not
count against the strategic limits. It would be
dealt with in a side letter from President Leonid
Brezhnev.
