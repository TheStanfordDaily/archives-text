# Meeting space shortage causes dispute
## 
### Kathy Bowman 
The process of reallocation of
group meeting space currently un
derway at the Activities Office and
the Women's Center's campaign to
keep the meeting room it was tem
porarily assigned have recently fo
cused attention on a chronic Univer
sity problem: the lack of meeting
space on campus.
Each year an Activities Office ad
visory committee reviews applica
tions for space on campus, but "It's
always the case that there is never
enough space or the right kind of
space," according to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs jim Lyons.
New attention is being focused on
the problem now because of an ap
parent misunderstanding over the
temporary allocation of Room 13 of
the Old Union Clubhouse to the
Women's Center.
The space was officially granted to
the center as short-term space for the
coordination of women's activities,
especially Women's Week, accord
ing to Patricia Brandt of the Activities

Office.
But there was some expectation
that we would get to keep the space,
according to Cindy Broholm, a wo
man's affairs intern at the Activities
Office.
Apparently this expectation came
from a letter from Tom Matthews of
the Activities Office to the center,
which indicated that evidence that
the space is being well used would
demonstrate the need for space to
the allocating committee, and thus
would have a very favorable influ
ence on their chances for realloca
tion.
Brandt maintains, however, that
Matthews' letter made the temporary
nature of the allocation explicit. She
emphasized the fact that it is not
"their space being taken," and that
any campaign for space for the Wo
men's Center should have the posi
tive approach, 'We want to be
granted the space because. . .
The Women's Center is now peti
tioning and writing letters in order to
be reallocated its space. According

to center staffers, the need for such a
space has been demonstrated by the
dramatic increase in student use of
the center since its move from the
Bridge to the Clubhouse last quarter.
Women's groups
The room is used by women's
groups, including Pro-Choice Al
liance and the Women's Guide, a
project foran introductory manual to
Stanford for women. The center is
open from 8 to 10 every evening and
holds a bagel breakfast each Tuesday
morning from 8 to 10.
Both Broholm and Erika
Heckscher, also of the center, em
phasized the increased opportunity
the space at the Clubhouse has given
for informal meetings and a social
atmosphere, because of its central
location on campus.
Besides being a center for organiz
ing workshopsand projects, "this is a
place where people can go for in
formal social meetings, or to use the
periodicals and other resources,"
said Broholm. "Those services and
workshops aren't provided any

where else on campus," added
Heckscher, who pointed out that the
center provided women an alterna
tive to the sorority system for a social
atmosphere.
Used often
Dean Lyons agreed that groups
have been using the center often,
and added that this has uncovered a
need on campus. "I think everyone
was surprised. I've been encourag
ing them (the center) to apply for
space," said Lyons.
The center's proposal "still must
be put through the process" of
evaluation by the committee, just as
are all groups' proposals for space,
said Brandt. "There are close to 40
groups who have filled out applica
tions for space. The committee has to
go through all proposals and try to
make a fair decision."
In Brandt's view, instead of pitting
group against group in competition
for the meeting space, this issue
should call more direct attention to
the real problem â€” the shortage of
student meeting places on campus.
