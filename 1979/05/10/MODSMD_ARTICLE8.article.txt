# Daniel Ellsberg discusses 'hidden' modern history
## 
### Norm Fill 
Daniel Ellsberg mounts
the podium and decisively
clears his throat to quiet his
class. After a short introduc
tion, he announces in
somber tones that "every
president since Eisenhower
has seriously threatened to
use nuclear weapons."
There is a long silence in
the room, some in the audi
ence seem literally shell
shocked. Mouths drop,
pencils begin to write furi
ously, and an exclamation
of "Oh god!" is heard from
the back of the lecture hall.
Ellsberg smiles, not so much
from knowledge of what he
has said, but from the reac
tion he has elicited. He con
tinues with the lecture. . . .
A visiting professor now
teaching the undergraduate
special "Nuclear Arms and

U.S. Foreign Policy,"
Ellsberg is collecting quite a
following here.
He is controversial to say
the least, and therein lies his
appeal. He speaks on what
is best described as "hid
den" contemporary his
tory; explaining events
which, while often shock
ing, seem to make sense out
of many otherwise un
explained acts of govern
ment.
He relates in frank, per
sonal terms incidents where
there have been near-fatal
nuclear mishaps, oversights
in military planning and
clear-cut cases of gov
ernmental cover-ups.
Often his claims seem too
extraordinary to be true. Yet
Ellsberg answers cries of
disbelief with carefully re
searched references and

firsthand knowledge from a
lifetime's experience within
the government.
A Harvard scho
larship student who
graduated summa cum
laude in economics,
Ellsberg later attended
King's College at Cam
bridge on a Woodrow Wil
son Fellowship. After com
pleting his masters and
Ph.D. at Harvard, he was in
vited to the Rand Corpora
tion as a research scholar.
Ellsberg said it was his in
volvement at Rand which
eventually led to a White
House consulting job in the
Kennedy administration,
and later to top-level posi
tions for the government.
In high school, he was
recognized as an up-and
coming "wiz kid." His
graduating class at the exc
lusive Cranbrook Academy
in Michigan knew him both
for his interest in slight of
hand tricks and as the per
son "most likely to make a
contribution to human
progress."
Ellsberg's notoriety for
the release of the Pentagon
Papers and his knack for
emotionally stirring an au
dience has led to his being
in demand as a lecturer. In
addition to teaching here,
Ellsberg's activities include
talks at UC-Santa Cruz and
appearances at numerous
rallies throughout the coun
try-
Since spilling the beans
on U.S. involvement in Vie

tnam, Ellsberg has become
an ardent activist, speaking
on such topics as the arms
race, nuclear proliferation
and the draft. Perhaps it is
his background as a Marine
platoon commander that
makes Ellsberg stubbornly
pursue his objectives.
Despite the fact that he
thought he "would be in
prison the rest of my life"
for the release of the Penta
gon Papers and despite sev
eral arrests for involvement
in anti-nuclear demonstra
tions, Ellsberg persists in his
work.
"There's no more impor
tant work in my life now
than preventing the use of
nuclear bombs," he said.
When asked what he
wants to accomplish in his
lectures, Ellsberg said he
wishes students to take less
for granted when studying
national affairs.
"There are very ominous
facts that call for action," he
explained. "Rather than see
our recent history as some

thing which is incom
prehensible and paralyzing,
I wish students to see that
there is a path out."
Ellsberg realizes that
many of those in his audi
ence seek government in
volvement.
"The advantages of gov
ernment involvement can
be overrated," he said.
"There is life outside of
these organizations and tel
ling the truth can signific
antly change our gov
ernmental institutions. If I
plant this subversive
thought in the minds of
those sitting in my clas
sroom, I will ruin the
careers of perhaps a fraction
of them — in a very useful
way. Someday they will
thank me for it."
Whether Ellsberg's talks
will have their intended ef
fect remains to be seen. For
the present, however, his
lectures here are unques
tionably thought
provoking.

way. Someday they will
thank me for it."
Whether Ellsberg's talks
will have their intended ef
fect remains to be seen. For
the present, however, his
lectures here are unques
tionably thought
provoking.


Daniel Ellsberg mounts
the podium and decisively
clears his throat to quiet his
class. After a short introduc
tion, he announces in
somber tones that "every
president since Eisenhower
has seriously threatened to
use nuclear weapons."
There is a long silence in
the room, some in the audi
ence seem literally shell
shocked. Mouths drop,
pencils begin to write furi
ously, and an exclamation
of "Oh god!" is heard from
the back of the lecture hall.
Ellsberg smiles, not so much
from knowledge of what he
has said, but from the reac
tion he has elicited. He con
tinues with the lecture. . . .
A visiting professor now
teaching the undergraduate
special "Nuclear Arms and

U.S. Foreign Policy,"
Ellsberg is collecting quite a
following here.
He is controversial to say
the least, and therein lies his
appeal. He speaks on what
is best described as "hid
den" contemporary his
tory; explaining events
which, while often shock
ing, seem to make sense out
of many otherwise un
explained acts of govern
ment.
He relates in frank, per
sonal terms incidents where
there have been near-fatal
nuclear mishaps, oversights
in military planning and
clear-cut cases of gov
ernmental cover-ups.
Often his claims seem too
extraordinary to be true. Yet
Ellsberg answers cries of
disbelief with carefully re
searched references and

firsthand knowledge from a
lifetime's experience within
the government.
A Harvard scho
larship student who
graduated summa cum
laude in economics,
Ellsberg later attended
King's College at Cam
bridge on a Woodrow Wil
son Fellowship. After com
pleting his masters and
Ph.D. at Harvard, he was in
vited to the Rand Corpora
tion as a research scholar.
Ellsberg said it was his in
volvement at Rand which
eventually led to a White
House consulting job in the
Kennedy administration,
and later to top-level posi
tions for the government.
In high school, he was
recognized as an up-and
coming "wiz kid." His
graduating class at the exc
lusive Cranbrook Academy
in Michigan knew him both
for his interest in slight of
hand tricks and as the per
son "most likely to make a
contribution to human
progress."
Ellsberg's notoriety for
the release of the Pentagon
Papers and his knack for
emotionally stirring an au
dience has led to his being
in demand as a lecturer. In
addition to teaching here,
Ellsberg's activities include
talks at UC-Santa Cruz and
appearances at numerous
rallies throughout the coun
try-
Since spilling the beans
on U.S. involvement in Vie

tnam, Ellsberg has become
an ardent activist, speaking
on such topics as the arms
race, nuclear proliferation
and the draft. Perhaps it is
his background as a Marine
platoon commander that
makes Ellsberg stubbornly
pursue his objectives.
Despite the fact that he
thought he "would be in
prison the rest of my life"
for the release of the Penta
gon Papers and despite sev
eral arrests for involvement
in anti-nuclear demonstra
tions, Ellsberg persists in his
work.
"There's no more impor
tant work in my life now
than preventing the use of
nuclear bombs," he said.
When asked what he
wants to accomplish in his
lectures, Ellsberg said he
wishes students to take less
for granted when studying
national affairs.
"There are very ominous
facts that call for action," he
explained. "Rather than see
our recent history as some

thing which is incom
prehensible and paralyzing,
I wish students to see that
there is a path out."
Ellsberg realizes that
many of those in his audi
ence seek government in
volvement.
"The advantages of gov
ernment involvement can
be overrated," he said.
"There is life outside of
these organizations and tel
ling the truth can signific
antly change our gov
ernmental institutions. If I
plant this subversive
thought in the minds of
those sitting in my clas
sroom, I will ruin the
careers of perhaps a fraction
of them — in a very useful
way. Someday they will
thank me for it."
Whether Ellsberg's talks
will have their intended ef
fect remains to be seen. For
