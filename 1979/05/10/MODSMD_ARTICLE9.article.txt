# American novels pirated by Soviets

Moscow (AP) — E.L. Doc
torow's American best-seller
Ragtime is the hottest book in
Moscow right now. In fact, too
hot for Soviet authorities to
handle — but not for the thriv
ing black market.
Writers here say the Com
munist Party's Central Com
mittee has denounced the
novel as pornographic in what
is being whispered as a new
government crackdown on
U.S. books available in transla
tion.
The decision, secretly made
in April, puts the book into the
underground market in pirated
books — especially new
American novels — where
bestsellers bring anywhere
from $45 to $150.
"It's a business," a Soviet
writer explained. "Anyone
who wants to read American
books can get them this way."
The pirating is done by Rus
sians who have access to copy
ing machines, like Xerox,
which are heavily controlled.
The prices are a healthy chunk
in a country were the average
monthly salary is $240.
3000 books
One enterprising Muscovite
is known to have collected 3000
popular books from abroad
just to reproduce and sell
them.
There are also recent
graduates of Moscow language
institutes who sit at typewriters
most of the day and translate
U.S. books, like Mario Puzo's
The Godfather. Some Soviets
go to the apartments of trans
lators to hear the books read in
Russian.

The photocopies of U.S\
books'appeared on the Mos
cow scene only in the last three
years, writers say, now that
bound novels sold on the black
market have become scarce.
The typical Moscow
bookstore is stocked with
copies of Angela Davis' au
tobiography — and little else
American.
Buyers who show a badge
from the elite Writer's Union
can browse through a special
tiny bookstore in central Mos
cow that occasionally has U.S.
works for sale. In recent years,
writers have seen Arthur
Hailey's Airport, Truman Ca
pote's In Cold Blood and
Robert Penn Warren's All The
King's Men, as well as works by
science fiction writers Isaac
Asimov and Ray Bradbury.
Reading privileges
The editors of important
Soviet journals as well as Soviet
ministers and their aides have
special reading privileges.
They receive a list of U.S.
books available in translation
and merely underline the
novels they want to read.
At the first International
Book Fair held in Moscow in
1977, Soviet publishers bought
the rights to 119 American
books.
So where are they?
Many books meet the same
fate as Ragtime, a kaleidos
copic look at the 1920s that was
translated in full and appeared
in the September and October
1978 issues of Foreign Litera
ture, a widely sought but hard
to-get journal that prints
foreign works.
