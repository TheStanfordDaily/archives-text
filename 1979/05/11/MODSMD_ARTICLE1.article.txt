# Congress rejects Carter's gas rationing scheme

Washington (AP) — The House yesterday rejected Pres
ident Carter's request for standby gasoline rationing
authority despite an impassioned appeal from Speaker
Thomas O'Neill that "this is the only plan you have."
The 246 to 159 vote killed the twice-modified plan that
would have given the president authority to order
gasoline rationing in times of severe energy shortages.
O'Neill blamed parochial interests for torpedoing the
proposal, saying legislators looked only at how the plan
would affect their own areas.
"Today I'm shedding a tear for America. This is the
only plan you have," O'Neill said in an emotional speech
from the floor.
White House analysts had feared from the beginning
that modifications made to pick up needed votes from
senators from large rural states would cost the plan
support among urban legislators in the House.

Carter had submitted the plan under a 1975 law requir
ing him to do so and giving Congress 60 days in which to
act on it. That time runs out today.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House
energy and power subcommittee, said the law did not
require Carter to submit another plan if Congress re
jected his first one.
"The possibility of the president submitting another
plan is very slight," Dingell declared.
The Senate had approved the plan Wednesday by a
58-39 margin.
Backers of the standby plan had insisted it would be
used only for a major interruption of oil supplies like
another Arab oil boycott and not to ease current shor
tages.
"This is a plan to put on the shelf in case this nation
finds itself in a dire emergency," said Rep. Phil Cramm,
(D-Texas).

And Energy Secretary James Schlesinger, testifying
yesterday before the House Ways and Means Commit
tee, asserted: "Unless there is a major debacle in the
international arena—there is zero probability of
gasoline rationing."
But House Republican Leader John Rhodes of Arizona
urged rejection, saying that even though the proposal
was called a standby plan, "within a very short period of
time, you will find it implemented."
Carter originally wanted to allocate rationing coupons
based solely on the number of registered vehicles in a
household. But he modified the plan twice in an attempt
to pick up needed votes.
The final plan would still allocate gas based on the
number of registered vehicles but the number of
coupons issued per-vehicle would depend on the past
statewide average for gasoline use.

Average per-vehicle gasoline consumption among
states ranges from 38 gallons a month to 67 gallons a
month, with the average at about 64 gallons per month.
States above this average would get more than an
average number of gas coupons while those below
would get less.
The plan would limit eligibility to three cars per
household.
A total of 8 percent of the total supply would be set
aside to meet special "hardship" cases. The amount
distributed would depend on the severity of the shor
tage and is not part of the legislation.
However, fora loss of oil supplies on the magnitude of
20 percent, a rough calculation shows the likely ration
would range from about 30 to 50 gallons per month per
automobile, depending where a person lived. Motorcy
cles would get smaller proportionate amounts while
trucks would get more under the plan.
