Dear Bug Me:
Campus Shell seems to be just as short of gas
as everyone else. Is there a special allocation for
University vehicles so they're sure not to run
out?
-D.F.
The University not only has a special alloca
tion, but it also operates its own service station
and garage, according to Jerry Cunningham, di
rector of the building maintenance shops.
Cunningham said Chevron Oil, the supplier,
has cut last year's allocation by 20 percent. The
University now receives 13,000 gallons a month
for its 295 gasoline vehicles. It buys the gas
wholesale at 70 cents a gallon.
While the University now has 23,000 gallons in
its storage tanks, this month's delivery has been
halted until Chevron decides just how much gas
it has for the Bay Area, said Cunningham. He
added that he expects a delivery soon.
The reduction will be compensated for
through more conservation measures, he
noted.
"We're going to try to get our workers to
double-up and take out a single vehicle instead
of two. We're also eliminating a lot of the
grounds maintenance and delivery services on
the weekends," he said.
The highest priority services like the Marguer
ite buses and the emergency vehicles will not be
cut back, he added.
"Another way we've cut down is by selling off
a lot of the larger trucks," said Cunningham.
"We've replaced a lot of the pick-ups with these
small import jobs."
Only University vehicles with work orders can
fill up at the station. "Even if President Lyman
drove up in his Volkswagen, we couldn't give
him gas," Cunningham said.

Dear Bug Me:
Who lives in the house on Lake Lagunita bet
ween the Boathouse and Lambda Nu?
-R.A. and J.G.
Dear Bug Me:
Who lives in Kingscote Gardens?
-F.R.
Joel Smith, vice-president for development,

lives in the house on the lake; and students,
retired faculty and staff live in Kingscote Gar
dens, the apartment house next to the Faculty
Club.
The Lake Lagunita house is owned by the Uni
versity, but is always leased to a faculty or staff
member. Ed Scoles, associate director for ser
vice operations, said it was built about seven
years ago for the resident fellow of the Lagunita
fraternity cluster, a position now eliminated.
This is Smith's second year in the house.
Kingscote Gardens, built in 1917and managed
by an outside corporation, has 37 apartments.
Apparently the only restriction on living in the
building is that residents must be affiliated with
the University. Although most of the residents
are retired faculty members, 14 students have
moved in as well. Studio apartments start at
$225, and one-bedroom apartments, with a
kitchen and living room, go for $325.

Dear Bug Me:
Free parking is easy on campus. Every week
day the same cars park at the green curb (the
"Two Hour" zone) on Lagunita Drive from the
Faculty Club to Lomita Drive. Can you explain
this sanctuary for freeloaders?
-J.T.
Capt. William Wullschleger of Stanford Police
said the area is now being patrolled and tic
keted.
Once a car has been cited the tickets are
turned over to the local authorities. According
to some students, however, since the motor
vehicles division usually won't bother to prose
cute out-of-state licenses, a number of drivers
merely throw their tickets away. They reason
that risking a few $2 tickets is cheaper than pay
ing $60, $40 or $15 for an "A," "B" or"C" parking
permit.
Wullschleger noted that if the number of vio
lations grows, "There's a possibility we may start
keeping files of our own." A car can be towed if
it receives five tickets.
"Actually, the parking crunch has eased a bit
since the long gas lines started forming," he
said.

The Lake Lagunita house is owned by the Uni
versity, but is always leased to a faculty or staff
member. Ed Scoles, associate director for ser
vice operations, said it was built about seven
years ago for the resident fellow of the Lagunita
fraternity cluster, a position now eliminated.
This is Smith's second year in the house.
Kingscote Gardens, built in 1917and managed
by an outside corporation, has 37 apartments.
Apparently the only restriction on living in the
building is that residents must be affiliated with
the University. Although most of the residents
are retired faculty members, 14 students have
moved in as well. Studio apartments start at
$225, and one-bedroom apartments, with a
kitchen and living room, go for $325.

Dear Bug Me:
Free parking is easy on campus. Every week
day the same cars park at the green curb (the
"Two Hour" zone) on Lagunita Drive from the
Faculty Club to Lomita Drive. Can you explain
this sanctuary for freeloaders?
-J.T.
Capt. William Wullschleger of Stanford Police
said the area is now being patrolled and tic
keted.
Once a car has been cited the tickets are
turned over to the local authorities. According
to some students, however, since the motor
vehicles division usually won't bother to prose
cute out-of-state licenses, a number of drivers
merely throw their tickets away. They reason
that risking a few $2 tickets is cheaper than pay
ing $60, $40 or $15 for an "A," "B" or"C" parking
permit.
Wullschleger noted that if the number of vio
lations grows, "There's a possibility we may start
keeping files of our own." A car can be towed if
it receives five tickets.
"Actually, the parking crunch has eased a bit
since the long gas lines started forming," he
said.

Dear Bug Me:
Campus Shell seems to be just as short of gas
as everyone else. Is there a special allocation for
University vehicles so they're sure not to run
out?
-D.F.
The University not only has a special alloca
tion, but it also operates its own service station
and garage, according to Jerry Cunningham, di
rector of the building maintenance shops.
Cunningham said Chevron Oil, the supplier,
has cut last year's allocation by 20 percent. The
University now receives 13,000 gallons a month
for its 295 gasoline vehicles. It buys the gas
wholesale at 70 cents a gallon.
While the University now has 23,000 gallons in
its storage tanks, this month's delivery has been
halted until Chevron decides just how much gas
it has for the Bay Area, said Cunningham. He
added that he expects a delivery soon.
The reduction will be compensated for
through more conservation measures, he
noted.
"We're going to try to get our workers to
double-up and take out a single vehicle instead
of two. We're also eliminating a lot of the
grounds maintenance and delivery services on
the weekends," he said.
The highest priority services like the Marguer
ite buses and the emergency vehicles will not be
cut back, he added.
"Another way we've cut down is by selling off
a lot of the larger trucks," said Cunningham.
"We've replaced a lot of the pick-ups with these
small import jobs."
Only University vehicles with work orders can
fill up at the station. "Even if President Lyman
drove up in his Volkswagen, we couldn't give
him gas," Cunningham said.
