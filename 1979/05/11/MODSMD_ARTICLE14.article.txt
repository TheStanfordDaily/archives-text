# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Allan Chen End narcissistic selfishness 
### 
In the past couple of months, a number of
commentators in these pages have noted that
much of the student body suffers from aliena
tion, loneliness and shyness.
I can but add my voice to those who believe
this is a serious problem at Stanford, although I
also hope to add a different explanation for the
problem and a chicken-and-egg type riddle, in
the hope that some readers will find the courage
to seek the answer to the riddle in their own
personality.
The explanation is not my own. It is the work
of both clinical psychologists and social critics,
who have identified a destructive state of mind
in patients and in society at large. Writer Tom
Wolfe pinpointed this early on when he labelled
the 1970s the Me Decade.
More recently, a growing number of practic
ing psychologists have observed that their pa
tients suffer less from phobias and neuroses of
the type that Freud studied and catalogued years
ago.
An increasing number of patients complain of
vague feelings of dissatisfaction with their lives,
of aimlessness and emptiness, of an inability to
feel, and an insatiable desire for more and more
new experience to fill their lives.
Christopher Lasch makes this observation in
The Culture of Narcissism, a study of a personal
ity type that has come to dominate in an age
whose rhetoric indicates its mood: "get in touch
with yourself," "live for the moment" and "love
yourself before you love others."
Narcissism the rule
My own dealings with the human race lead me
to believe that the narcissist has become more
the norm than the deviation, both at the Univer
sity and outside. Not all of us are severe narcis
sists, but we all have some of these traits to
varying degrees.
It is also clear that attendance at an elite in
stitution contributes to an inflated sense of
one's own worth, and so to the condition of
being wrapped up in oneself. Three years ago,
when I was a high school graduate waiting out
the final weeks before my first trip west, a friend
of mine told me the words of a friend of his who

had had only one thing to say about Stanford:
"Those Stanford students â€” they think they're
God."
It seems a vicious cycle. We wear a personality
of cheer, superficial affability and content on
the outside, but on the inside, there is an inner
personality which is highly vulnerable and
frightened. Philosophers might once have cal
led it existential despair; this personality craves
attention and recognition from others, but it is
desperately afraid of not getting it.
Worst to be ignored
Intentional rejection by others is bad, but the
inner person is especially hurt if it is forgotten by
others.
The dual personality is not a healthy com
promise. When we fail to get the recognition of
others, it does not hurt the outer personality,
since it is not really ours to hurt.
Yet the inner personality is hurt badly, and still
worse, the outer personality we have created to
keep us from being hurt prevents the inner self
from expressing, arid perhaps diminishing, its
pain.
The riddle
Our books and individual activities get in the
way of our search for the indulgence of others,
but they also provide the refuge from a failed
search. One feeds on the other, the need for
attention and the fear of rejection which per
petually returns us to our books. Now the rid
dle: which was first to invade the individual? The
narcissistic preoccupation with self, or the
loneliness and alienation?
It has come time to eliminate the selfish "I"
from our thoughts, and to realize that narcis
sism, as Lasch has said, is more akin to self-hate
than self-love. "Human" has been defined in
many ways, but it is easiest remembered this
way: what makes me human is other humans.
We can define ourselves in terms of those
whom we touch; the attempt to get in touch
with yourself, even if done by using others, is
destructive and painful for everyone. Inside
yourself, you would ultimately find nothing.
