## Regulation caused the gas crisis 
### 
Take one worldwide
shortfall in oil production due
to political realities in unstable
regimes, flavored with foreign
policy that alienates and aggra
vates suppliers. The situation
in Iran was badly handled, and
alienated Iran while losing the
confidence other Middle East
ern suppliers had placed in the
United States.
Add regulations to reduce
emissions at a rate much grea
ter than refineries could
handle. The typical lead time
for an oil refinery to
changeover from leaded to un
leaded production is about five
years, so refineries are using
suboptimal methods that use
about 10 percent more crude
oil to make unleaded than reg
ular gasoline.
Stir in some rumors about
deregulating the price of oil.
The oil companies are thus
given a real incentive to hold
onto their reserves until they
can get a better price for it.
Beat to a fine texture by clos
ing down nine nuclear power
plants and keeping four others
from starting up. The power
these would generate is re
placed by plants burning about
500,000 barrels of oil per day.
We typically consume 20 mill
ion, and our shortfall is about

500,000.
Five of these plants were
shut down because there
would be a possibility of failure
if the cooling were turned off
during an earthquake of mag
nitude 7.0 or greater on the
Richter scale. All of these
plants are east of the Missis
sippi, where there has been no
such earthquake in the last 200
years. The other four were vic
tims of Three Mile Island.
Stupid storage
Spice with bureaucratic
stupidity that is storing 87 mill
ion barrels of oil under
Louisiana as a strategic reserve,
with no method of recovery.
The oil that has been pumped
back down could relieve our
shortfall for half a year, which
would give plenty of time to
find a more permanent solu
tion. That is the apparent intent
of the reserve.
Add a dash of neglect of real
ity by allocating available gas
according to 1973 consump
tion. Santa Clara Valley has
grown more than slightly in the
ensuing six years. Nobody has
heard of a shortage in Illinois.
More realistic estimates could
be made with last year's fi
gures, but Santa Clara Valley
would still get the short end.

Simmer with inaction while
the oil companies are forced to
stockpile heating oil for next
winter. There is a crisis now
that is more important than a
possible crisis next winter.
Odd/even useless
Serve this stew with a variety
of measures that aggravate the
problem. The local gas station
operator will protect his gas
supply by having shorter
hours, running only one pump
at a time, and not posting his
hours. The lines could be shor
tened by having more pumps
open for less time. The odd/
even plan will leave the Sines as
long, since people still come
for gas about as often. Odd/
even just makes it more incon
venient.
There is no one cause of the

oil crisis, but federal regulation
has done more than its fair
share. The oil companies'
monopolistic practices on
energy sources of all types are
another cause.
In this area, the complete
lack of decent, reliable mass
transit leaves no slack for crises
like this. All transit here is good
for is going up or down the
Peninsula, not across.
Needless to say, drivers have
also helped. But when it comes
down to the test, the bungling
and regulation of the federal
government is the main ingre
dient without which there
would be no oil crisis.
