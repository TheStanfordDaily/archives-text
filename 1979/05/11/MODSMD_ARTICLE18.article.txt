## Abortion an unacceptable solution 
### 
In response to Cinny Pud
defoot's article, "Abortion:
Consider mother's life" (Daily,
May 8), I would like to speak
for those "moralistic anti
choice" people, as she calls
them.
By tacking on the ingenious
standard "anti-choice", not to
mention the supposedly de
grading term "moralistic" to
those against abortion, Pud
defoot seems to think that the
sole reason for the anti
abortionists' existence is to
take "options" maliciously
away from poor, helpless
mothers.
Puddefoot gives the example
of a "woman struggling to raise
five children on welfare, who

suddenly finds herself pre
gnant," and decries the anti
abortionists who are taking
away an "option" for this wo
man.
Actually, however, there are
several options for this wo
man, following Puddefoot's
logic: 1) She could just have
not had sex, for, no matter how
"struggling" a woman is, she
must know that sex often re
sults in babies; 2) Perhaps this
poor woman could kill her five
children, and be free from
worry altogether, or 3), run to
Canada, and forget the chil
dren altogether.
Is murder even an "option"!
Perhaps the best way out of a
bad marriage would be to kill
one's husband. It could solve
everyone's problems.
Other arguments
Perhaps this may not be so
clear, if one does not consider
abortion murder, and yet I
offer three arguments to the
contrary:
— If a fetus is not human,
what is it? Animal, vegetable,
or mineral? A blob of protop
lasm? A fetus is a human "be
ing," an entire being by itself.
Although it is developing, to
call a fetus anything but a
human being is semantics.
— How can we be certain
just when a baby becomes a
real person? A baby "lives"
from the second of concep
tion, and yet, although no one
may remember the time he was
in the womb, can anyone say at
what moment he became him
self? At what moment did I
come to exist as an individual?
One can't say at birth, for
many very premature babies
have survived to live normally.
We just don't know enough

about physical as well as
psychological development to
pinpoint a time when a baby is
just cells and when it is an indi
vidual. Almost by the time a
mother knows she is pregnant,
the baby's body is almost fully
formed.
— Some say that a baby
doesn't know it is dying, or,
since it is dependent on its
mother so much, it doesn't
matter if it dies or not. Several
old people and crippled per
sons are physically as well as
mentally dependent on others
for life itself, yet do we have
the right to kill them? Depen
dence upon others for exis
tence does not imply the
forfeiture of the right to life.
Racist
If these arguments are not
convincing, abortion as Pud
defoot sees it is also racist.
Everyone is very eager for
poorer people—those on
welfare—to have abortions.
Everyone is anxious to make
sure that poor people have as
few children as possible so as
not to be a burden. Abortion in
this sense is a genocide of the
poor, proposed and strongly
advocated by Planned Parent
hood agencies and the gov
ernment.
Puddefoot writes, "Abortion
has been with us since long be
fore it was legalized in 1973."
She is absolutely right, and, in
fact, the period of history when
abortions were most prevalent
was just around the fall of the
Roman Empire. Then, people
were selfish too, and ready to
flee from responsibility, or, as
Puddefoot puts it, a woman
was conscious of her "freedom
to pursue her own life."
Murder as well as abortion

takes place every day, yet
should the government set up
programs to help out the mur
derer, to insure his safety when
killing his victim?
Sure, before 1973, women
died of self-induced abortions,
but how many babies died, and
are dying right now because of
self-induced, saline-injected,
scapeled, pre-meditated, and
legal abortions? Abortion will
continue if made illegal, but
why should the government
condone murder, much as it
condoned the murder in Viet
nam?
Why hostile?
Puddefoot concludes by say
ing that the pro-life groups
should concentrate on "im
proving people's lives" and
promoting "responsibility in
sex." She fails to realize that
these are the main objectives
of the Right-to-Life League.
Why is she so hostile to a group
that has no personal interest or
gain involved, a group of
people who must live in a
country that condones a car
nage greater than both world
wars for this country com
bined?
For those who see abortion
as murder, there is no greater
issue now facing us. Abortion
is an ongoing massacre, the
taking of the very life of a seg
ment of society that cannot
plan a march on Selma or peti
tion through Congress.
I'm sure Puddefoot would
like to see all those poor
women who suddenly "find
themselves pregnant" leading
a more comfortable life, but I
personally would rather forfeit
all the luxuries of life than to
destroy it.
