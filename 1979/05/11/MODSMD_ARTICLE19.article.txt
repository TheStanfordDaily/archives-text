Environment month
Environment Month, a series
of more than 20 events, ended
last week. The main objective
of Environment Month was to
increase student awareness of
environmental issues, to make
the environment a common
conversational topic. Towards
that end, we staged weekly
panel discussions and a
number of lectures and slide
shows.
We did succeed in appealing
to a broad range of interests by
presenting the perspectives of
qualified speakers which
ranged from an anarchist
ecologist's to the timber indus
try's. Our panel on nuclear
energy, a sensational and pithy
topic, was well-attended.
However, a forest-use panel of
similar gravity with equally
qualified speakers was at
tended marginally at best.
While we did not intend to
attract overflow audiences to
all our events, we do feel that a
number of interesting events
about important issues did not
draw as well as they should
have.
As the month progressed, it
became evident that the
people who came to events
were those who already cared
about environmental issues,
not those who we wanted to
reach — most students without
any previous interest.
The outcome of Environ
ment Month has not discour
aged us — quite to the contrary
— we are encouraged by what
we have learned. The objective
of next year's Environment
Month will be the same: to in
crease student awareness of
environmental issues.
However, we would like to
go a step further and ask why
environmental problems exist.

This would require a closer
examination of the institutions
and attitudes that lie behind
these problems. Next year's
program will be shorter and in
volve students more dynami
cally, but will still offer a variety
of credentialed speakers on
important topics.
We also hope to involve stu
dents without any interest in
environmental issues. The de
nouement of this year's Envi
ronment Month will be a work
shop on lifestyles, values and
the environment Tuesday at
Synergy House, to which all are
welcome.
We hope that everyone en
joyed Environment Month,
and we urge you to discuss the
issues and explore the roots of
your opinions.

'Boring, boring'
I'm bored with Stanford, and
although I'm too apathetic to
do anything about it, I thought
I'd try to tell people why. So
here goes nothing,
First, I'm not learning any
thing of value here — certainly
not in the majority of my clas
ses. Little at all is relevant to my
life now, next to nothing is re
levant to what my life will be
when I leave here.
Not only that, but whatever
job I luck into will use perhaps
10 percent of the "knowledge"
I've acquired here, and as for
skills and talents, I had them
before I came. I'm acquiring a
piece of paper, not an educa
tion.
Second, social life here is
tedious and uninteresting.
People go to dances and drink

liquor while standing in cor
ners with people they already
know. Or they talk over dinner
about classes, sports and
who's sleeping with whom.
For variety we have the ASSU
Sunday Flicks that we've seen
before, and the late-night dis
cussions where impassioned
participants practice being in
tellectual over matters about
which they know nothing.
Ho-hum.
Third, people go out of their
way to be dull here. No one
says anything interesting or
even listens to you because
they assume you're incapable
of saying anything interesting
either. Everyone tries to con
form to everyone's expecta
tions, and individuals or
groups who are "different" —
by whatever standards — get
laughed at or studiously ig
nored. Those who aren't mind
less clones aren't letting on.
Fourth and last, too many of us
are, like myself, bored, apathe
tic, unimaginative clones pay
ing exorbitant sums for four
years of a mediocre, protohu
man existence. We either as
sert our individuality while ig
noring the routine character of
our talk, thought and lives, orif
we are aware of this, we find
taking action too difficult and
challenging.
Our lives don't demand our
attention so we give them
none. Easier to continue taking
notes, finals and more classes,
to bitch but do nothing.
When was the last time you
asked yourself what in hell
you're doing here? The last
time you discussed it with any
one else? Did anything about
it? Well, how about now? I'm
tired of being bored. . . .

The human touch
I was angry, frustrated and
behind in my statistics
homework. Judging the prob
lem to be out of control, I re
sorted to drastic measures: a
frontal attack.
First, I got his address, then I
jumped into my car, and at last
drove to his house. The
friendly girl who answered the
doorbell told me that he had
moved. She gave me his new
address, and, after resetting
my sights, I Zeroed in on the
target.
What was the target? My
statistics professor. He re
ceived my unexpected visit —
intrusion — politely, and we
sat down to analyze my statisti
cal shortcomings. The ex
change would have remained a
typical case of "desperate stu
dent confronts wise professor"
except for one thing. I talked.
I told him that I didn't read
his handouts because I think
that his handwriting is messy.
He told me that he likes his
handwriting, that his secretary
likes it and that he has neither
time nor impulse to type hand
outs at 6 a.m.
Something incredible began
to occur: authentic communi
cation. Soon we were discus
sing educational systematiza
tion and dehumanization, pro
cesses in whose clutches many
here feel themselves to be
deeply entrenched. As we
talked, however, the human
element of education restored
itself
It's easy to slip into automa
tic gear at Stanford. Professors
lecture, students record their
words, tests inundate the stu
dents along with problem sets,
papers and the last clean pair of
socks. At such a desperate
moment everything looks rot
ten, sounds impossible, and

feels hopeless.
At such moments, everyone
else copes so beautifully . . .
and we finally ask "What am I
doing here?"
The Professor knows the
facts; he knows that kids don't
do the work that they should
do to earn the grades they
want. But for once the human
touch revealed itself alongside
of the facts, the human touch
of something shared — no mat
ter how small.
Cultivating the human touch
demands attention and pati
ence, but survival is more than
a formula. It is an art learned
through experience. Even at
Stanford, we must retain our
selves as human beings, shar
ing and keeping in touch.

Some ponder the validity of
stereotypes — and that por
tentous issue of national chap
ter influence still hangs in the

At the same time these con
troversies boil, we read about a
Peace Week anti-draft rally,
Cesar Chavez speaking on the
farm worker's strike, an am
bassador discussiong U.S.-
Canada relations, and a panel
discussion of future energy

With so many real world is

Environment month
Environment Month, a series
of more than 20 events, ended
last week. The main objective
of Environment Month was to
increase student awareness of
environmental issues, to make
the environment a common
conversational topic. Towards
that end, we staged weekly
panel discussions and a
number of lectures and slide
shows.
We did succeed in appealing
to a broad range of interests by
presenting the perspectives of
qualified speakers which
ranged from an anarchist
ecologist's to the timber indus
try's. Our panel on nuclear
energy, a sensational and pithy
topic, was well-attended.
However, a forest-use panel of
similar gravity with equally
qualified speakers was at
tended marginally at best.
While we did not intend to
attract overflow audiences to
all our events, we do feel that a
number of interesting events
about important issues did not
draw as well as they should
have.
As the month progressed, it
became evident that the
people who came to events
were those who already cared
about environmental issues,
not those who we wanted to
reach — most students without
any previous interest.
The outcome of Environ
ment Month has not discour
aged us — quite to the contrary
— we are encouraged by what
we have learned. The objective
of next year's Environment
Month will be the same: to in
crease student awareness of
environmental issues.
However, we would like to
go a step further and ask why
environmental problems exist.

This would require a closer
examination of the institutions
and attitudes that lie behind
these problems. Next year's
program will be shorter and in
volve students more dynami
cally, but will still offer a variety
of credentialed speakers on
important topics.
We also hope to involve stu
dents without any interest in
environmental issues. The de
nouement of this year's Envi
ronment Month will be a work
shop on lifestyles, values and
the environment Tuesday at
Synergy House, to which all are
welcome.
We hope that everyone en
joyed Environment Month,
and we urge you to discuss the
issues and explore the roots of
your opinions.

'Boring, boring'
I'm bored with Stanford, and
although I'm too apathetic to
do anything about it, I thought
I'd try to tell people why. So
here goes nothing,
First, I'm not learning any
thing of value here — certainly
not in the majority of my clas
ses. Little at all is relevant to my
life now, next to nothing is re
levant to what my life will be
when I leave here.
Not only that, but whatever
job I luck into will use perhaps
10 percent of the "knowledge"
I've acquired here, and as for
skills and talents, I had them
before I came. I'm acquiring a
piece of paper, not an educa
tion.
Second, social life here is
tedious and uninteresting.
People go to dances and drink

liquor while standing in cor
ners with people they already
know. Or they talk over dinner
about classes, sports and
who's sleeping with whom.
For variety we have the ASSU
Sunday Flicks that we've seen
before, and the late-night dis
cussions where impassioned
participants practice being in
tellectual over matters about
which they know nothing.
Ho-hum.
Third, people go out of their
way to be dull here. No one
says anything interesting or
even listens to you because
they assume you're incapable
of saying anything interesting
either. Everyone tries to con
form to everyone's expecta
tions, and individuals or
groups who are "different" —
by whatever standards — get
laughed at or studiously ig
nored. Those who aren't mind
less clones aren't letting on.
Fourth and last, too many of us
are, like myself, bored, apathe
tic, unimaginative clones pay
ing exorbitant sums for four
years of a mediocre, protohu
man existence. We either as
sert our individuality while ig
noring the routine character of
our talk, thought and lives, orif
we are aware of this, we find
taking action too difficult and
challenging.
Our lives don't demand our
attention so we give them
none. Easier to continue taking
notes, finals and more classes,
to bitch but do nothing.
When was the last time you
asked yourself what in hell
you're doing here? The last
time you discussed it with any
one else? Did anything about
it? Well, how about now? I'm
tired of being bored. . . .

The human touch
I was angry, frustrated and
behind in my statistics
homework. Judging the prob
lem to be out of control, I re
sorted to drastic measures: a
frontal attack.
First, I got his address, then I
jumped into my car, and at last
drove to his house. The
friendly girl who answered the
doorbell told me that he had
moved. She gave me his new
address, and, after resetting
my sights, I Zeroed in on the
target.
What was the target? My
statistics professor. He re
ceived my unexpected visit —
intrusion — politely, and we
sat down to analyze my statisti
cal shortcomings. The ex
change would have remained a
typical case of "desperate stu
dent confronts wise professor"
except for one thing. I talked.
I told him that I didn't read
his handouts because I think
that his handwriting is messy.
He told me that he likes his
handwriting, that his secretary
likes it and that he has neither
time nor impulse to type hand
outs at 6 a.m.
Something incredible began
to occur: authentic communi
cation. Soon we were discus
sing educational systematiza
tion and dehumanization, pro
cesses in whose clutches many
here feel themselves to be
deeply entrenched. As we
talked, however, the human
element of education restored
itself
It's easy to slip into automa
tic gear at Stanford. Professors
lecture, students record their
words, tests inundate the stu
dents along with problem sets,
papers and the last clean pair of
socks. At such a desperate
moment everything looks rot
ten, sounds impossible, and

feels hopeless.
At such moments, everyone
else copes so beautifully . . .
and we finally ask "What am I
doing here?"
The Professor knows the
facts; he knows that kids don't
do the work that they should
do to earn the grades they
want. But for once the human
touch revealed itself alongside
of the facts, the human touch
of something shared — no mat
ter how small.
Cultivating the human touch
demands attention and pati
ence, but survival is more than
a formula. It is an art learned
through experience. Even at
Stanford, we must retain our
selves as human beings, shar
ing and keeping in touch.

of more than 20 events, ended
last week. The main objective
of Environment Month was to
increase student awareness of
environmental issues, to make
the environment a common
conversational topic. Towards
that end, we staged weekly
panel discussions and a
number of lectures and slide
shows.
We did succeed in appealing
to a broad range of interests by
presenting the perspectives of
qualified speakers which
ranged from an anarchist
ecologist's to the timber indus
try's. Our panel on nuclear
energy, a sensational and pithy
topic, was well-attended.
However, a forest-use panel of
similar gravity with equally
qualified speakers was at
tended marginally at best.
While we did not intend to
attract overflow audiences to
all our events, we do feel that a
number of interesting events
about important issues did not
draw as well as they should
have.
As the month progressed, it
became evident that the
people who came to events
were those who already cared
about environmental issues,
not those who we wanted to
reach — most students without
any previous interest.
The outcome of Environ
ment Month has not discour
aged us — quite to the contrary
— we are encouraged by what
we have learned. The objective
of next year's Environment
Month will be the same: to in
crease student awareness of
environmental issues.
However, we would like to
go a step further and ask why
environmental problems exist.

This would require a closer
examination of the institutions
and attitudes that lie behind
these problems. Next year's
program will be shorter and in
volve students more dynami
cally, but will still offer a variety
of credentialed speakers on
important topics.
We also hope to involve stu
dents without any interest in
environmental issues. The de
nouement of this year's Envi
ronment Month will be a work
shop on lifestyles, values and
the environment Tuesday at
Synergy House, to which all are
welcome.
We hope that everyone en
joyed Environment Month,
and we urge you to discuss the
issues and explore the roots of
your opinions.

'Boring, boring'
I'm bored with Stanford, and
although I'm too apathetic to
do anything about it, I thought
I'd try to tell people why. So
here goes nothing,
First, I'm not learning any
thing of value here — certainly
not in the majority of my clas
ses. Little at all is relevant to my
life now, next to nothing is re
levant to what my life will be
when I leave here.
Not only that, but whatever
job I luck into will use perhaps
10 percent of the "knowledge"
I've acquired here, and as for
skills and talents, I had them
before I came. I'm acquiring a
piece of paper, not an educa
tion.
Second, social life here is
tedious and uninteresting.
People go to dances and drink

liquor while standing in cor
ners with people they already
know. Or they talk over dinner
about classes, sports and
who's sleeping with whom.
For variety we have the ASSU
Sunday Flicks that we've seen
before, and the late-night dis
cussions where impassioned
participants practice being in
tellectual over matters about
which they know nothing.
Ho-hum.
Third, people go out of their
way to be dull here. No one
says anything interesting or
even listens to you because
they assume you're incapable
of saying anything interesting
either. Everyone tries to con
form to everyone's expecta
tions, and individuals or
groups who are "different" —
by whatever standards — get
laughed at or studiously ig
nored. Those who aren't mind
less clones aren't letting on.
Fourth and last, too many of us
are, like myself, bored, apathe
tic, unimaginative clones pay
ing exorbitant sums for four
years of a mediocre, protohu
man existence. We either as
sert our individuality while ig
noring the routine character of
our talk, thought and lives, orif
we are aware of this, we find
taking action too difficult and
challenging.
Our lives don't demand our
attention so we give them
none. Easier to continue taking
notes, finals and more classes,
to bitch but do nothing.
When was the last time you
asked yourself what in hell
you're doing here? The last
time you discussed it with any
one else? Did anything about
it? Well, how about now? I'm
tired of being bored. . . .

The human touch
I was angry, frustrated and
behind in my statistics
homework. Judging the prob
lem to be out of control, I re
sorted to drastic measures: a
frontal attack.
First, I got his address, then I
jumped into my car, and at last
drove to his house. The
friendly girl who answered the
doorbell told me that he had
moved. She gave me his new
address, and, after resetting
my sights, I Zeroed in on the
target.
What was the target? My
statistics professor. He re
ceived my unexpected visit —
intrusion — politely, and we
sat down to analyze my statisti
cal shortcomings. The ex
change would have remained a
typical case of "desperate stu
dent confronts wise professor"
except for one thing. I talked.
I told him that I didn't read
his handouts because I think
that his handwriting is messy.
He told me that he likes his
handwriting, that his secretary
likes it and that he has neither
time nor impulse to type hand
outs at 6 a.m.
Something incredible began
to occur: authentic communi
cation. Soon we were discus
sing educational systematiza
tion and dehumanization, pro
cesses in whose clutches many
here feel themselves to be
deeply entrenched. As we
talked, however, the human
element of education restored
itself
It's easy to slip into automa
tic gear at Stanford. Professors
lecture, students record their
words, tests inundate the stu
dents along with problem sets,
papers and the last clean pair of
socks. At such a desperate
moment everything looks rot
ten, sounds impossible, and

feels hopeless.
At such moments, everyone
else copes so beautifully . . .
and we finally ask "What am I
doing here?"
The Professor knows the
facts; he knows that kids don't
do the work that they should
do to earn the grades they
want. But for once the human
touch revealed itself alongside
of the facts, the human touch
of something shared — no mat
ter how small.
Cultivating the human touch
demands attention and pati
ence, but survival is more than
a formula. It is an art learned
through experience. Even at
Stanford, we must retain our
selves as human beings, shar
ing and keeping in touch.

End frat opinions
The sorority/fraternity sys
tem ranks high on the list of
discussion topics, judging by
the number of letters and col
umns found in the Daily lately.
Some ponder the validity of
stereotypes — and that por
tentous issue of national chap
ter influence still hangs in the
air.
At the same time these con
troversies boil, we read about a
Peace Week anti-draft rally,
Cesar Chavez speaking on the
farm worker's strike, an am
bassador discussiong U.S.-
Canada relations, and a panel
discussion of future energy
supplies.
With so many real world is
sues and events brought to the
campus, columnists ought to
be able to find better things to
write about than the presence
of a "Creek" system here.
