Courtroom proceedings
Al Leukhardt and Mike Lesyna are roommates. Lesyna was primarily responsible for injuring Al's foot Wednesday
night, so Leukhardt retaliated yesterday by moving Mike's belongings onto the volleyball court between Stern and
Wilbur Halls. Upon riding his bicycle down Escondido Road, Lesyna came to the sudden conclusion that the flea
market-appearance of the court was due to a little help from his friends. His first reactions were unprintable, but
shortly thereafter order was restored (as were Lesyna's things) to Soto House. (Pictured from left to right are Soto
residents Carry Shumway, Leukhardt, Ray Villareal and Ben Parks.)
