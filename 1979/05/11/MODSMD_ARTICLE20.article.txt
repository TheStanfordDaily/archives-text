The Apartment ★ * ★ *
Friday, Kresge
Jack Lemmon plays a man who
seeks to crawl up the executive
ladder by loaning out his apart
ment to his furtively adulterous
employers. One of the women
who is often brought for a re
ndezvous is Shirley Maclaine.
Lemmon and Maclaine fall in
love.
Billy (Sunset Boulevard) Wilder
directed this bittersweet ro
mance. It boasts some very funny
scenes, some fine black and
white photography, and some
good performances, including
one by Fred Mac Murray (this was
before he became the archetypal
stooge in Disney movies).
—Jim Mattson
Clockwork Orange (4) * * * #
Old Mill, Mountain View
Stanley Kubrick transferred
Anthony Burgess' novel to the sc
reen by making a gruelingly vis
ual film. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near fu
ture; the issue at stake is whether
individuality is more important
than the society that must deal
with the individual. Malcolm
McDowell stars as a man whose
joy comes mainly from commit
ting acts of violence; he is ar
rested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this
singularly disturbing film.

Ciet Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto * * * *
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Handkerchiefs is
the story of Solange, a woman
who, after failing with her hus
band and a lover, finds solace in
the arms of a 13-year-old boy with
an IQ of 158. The twist is that the
story is told from an unabashedly
male viewpoint: the plot may be
long to Solange, but the movie's
meaning belongs solely to the
male characters. Gerard Depar
dieu, Patrick Dewaere and Carol
Laure star.
—J.M.
Anastasia * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman won her sec
ond Academy Award for this
movie, but she probably got the
Oscar less for her performance
than to commemorate her return
to Hollywood after her then
scandalous romance with Italian
director Roberto Rosellini was

over. Bergman plays an amnesiac
who is forced by Yul Brynner to
pretend that she is the missing
daughter of Czar Nicholas II so
that Brynner can steal the inheri
tance. Even though this was a
period when both amnesiacs and
Yul Brynner were thought to be
serious dramatic devices, the
whole schmeer reeks of soap op
era. Anatole Litvak directed.
—J.M.
The Long Goodbye * * *
Saturday, Cubberley
Elliott Could just might be the
most offbeat Philip Marlowe im
aginable, but he fits right into this
dreamy and very funny Robert
Altman movie. Altman set the
Raymond Chandler mystery in
the '70s; he doesn't just change
the setting — he rethinks the
novel to fit his playful (in this
case) vision of L A. This is one of
Altman's most laid-back movies,
and perhaps so subtle that it will
go right by you — it's no accident
that this movie failed at the box
office. (1975)
—R.L.
No Time For Breakfast # * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
Breakfast is a fine, sometimes
moving examination of a doctor
who discovers how comfortless
the ministrations of his profes
sion can be when she is
dying of cancer. Annie Cirardot is
very good as the doctor; she
manages to avoid slipping into
the potential bathos of the sub
ject. Isabelle (The Lacemaker)
Huppert is featured in a small
role. Jean-Louis Bertucelli di
rected. (1978)
—J.M.
Picnic at Hanging Rock * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking > on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than relays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen

Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one ot his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancim
run amuck.

An Unmarried Woman
Biograph
Writer-director Paul Mazurs
ky's faintly feminist look at '70s
divorce is perhaps a little too
smooth, but Jill Clayburgh's per
formance is so richly tender and
comic that that really doesn't
matter. It'sa soaringand convinc
ing piece of acting, neatly com
plemented by Alan Bates' per
formance as the man who nearly
convinces Clayburgh to make a
commitment again. With Michael
Murphy. (1978)
—Ron Lillejord
Semi-Tough * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
If you liked the book by Sports
Illustrated writer/derni-god Dan
jenkins, you may wonder what
the hell happened to it on the
way to this Michael (Smile)
Ritchie movie. Ritchie is in
terested in about 10 too many
things, and this movie often ap
pears to be falling apart, but Burt
Reynolds does an amazing fake
Cary Grant impression and
camps his way through — saving
the movie. With )ill Clayburgh
and Kris Kristofferson.

Manhattan * ★ * *
Palo Alto Square
'S Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his
70s trilogy with a film that will
rank as one of the few master
pieces of this decade. Manhattan
is a bitterly funny examination of
a city and a lifestyle. It bites close
enough to the bone to be both
hilarious and oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton,
Michael Murphy, Mariel
Hemingway and Meryl Streep.
Written by Woody Allen and
Marshall Brickman. Photography
by Gordon Willis. Music by
George Gershwin.

Norma Rae * * # *
Biograph, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Hy
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.

Bldik Orpheus * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The myth of Orpheus and
Eurydice is relocated to carnival
time in Rio with impressive re
sults. The carnival is peculiarly
well suited to the myth: this film
has more life in it than most of
Michael Cacoyannis' versions of
the Greek myths which are os
tensibly more faithful to their set
ting and usually end up being
mummified. Breno Mello plays
Orpheus; Marcel Camus di
rected.
—J.M.
Dear Inspector * ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not even the immensely
talented Annie Girardot can sal
vage much of this sometimes
over-violent, sometimes cloying
mystery-romance. It's a
thoroughly unconvincing movie.
Girardot is a "lady detective";
when she take time out from her
latest case to get her hair done it's
supposed to be very funny, but
isn't. Phillipe Noiret co-stars;
Phillipe De Broca, who made
King of Hearts, directed. (1977)
—J.M.

The Champ *
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the tate of (on Voight
and Faye capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.
—|.M.
Superman ★ * *
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
»vonder it makes up with an ex
nerienced comic book sense.
Fhe movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.
—R.L.

Coming Hume * * * *
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally sutlers from poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time. |ane Fonda and |on
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.
—R.L.
Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With |ohn Sav
age, Beverly D'Angelo and Treat
Williams.
-R.L.

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and lack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
—R.L.
Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, Jason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton Ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.
JanTroell directed; Sven Nykvist
was the cinematographer. M




'ill Clayburtth «ind Lisa Lucas (top) are featured in An Unmarried
Woman. The 197H film plays Sunday and Monday at the New
Varsity. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton (center) star in Manhat
tan, which can l>e seen at the Palo Alto Square. Breno Mello
portrays a modern-day Orpheus in Black Orpheus, playing Tues
day and Wednesday at the New Varsity.

that this movie failed at the box
office. (1975)

No Time For Breakfast # * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
Breakfast is a fine, sometimes
moving examination of a doctor
who discovers how comfortless
the ministrations of his profes
sion can be when she is
dying of cancer. Annie Cirardot is
very good as the doctor; she
manages to avoid slipping into
the potential bathos of the sub
ject. Isabelle (The Lacemaker)
Huppert is featured in a small
role. Jean-Louis Bertucelli di
rected. (1978)
—J.M.
Picnic at Hanging Rock * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking > on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than relays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen

Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one ot his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancim
run amuck.

An Unmarried Woman
Biograph
Writer-director Paul Mazurs
ky's faintly feminist look at '70s
divorce is perhaps a little too
smooth, but Jill Clayburgh's per
formance is so richly tender and
comic that that really doesn't
matter. It'sa soaringand convinc

plemented by Alan Bates' per
formance as the man who nearly
convinces Clayburgh to make a
commitment again. With Michael
Murphy. (1978)

Semi-Tough * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
If you liked the book by Sports
Illustrated writer/derni-god Dan

the hell happened to it on the
way to this Michael (Smile)
Ritchie movie. Ritchie is in
terested in about 10 too many

Cary Grant impression and
camps his way through — saving

Manhattan * ★ * *
Palo Alto Square
'S Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his
70s trilogy with a film that will
rank as one of the few master
pieces of this decade. Manhattan
is a bitterly funny examination of
a city and a lifestyle. It bites close
enough to the bone to be both
hilarious and oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton,
Michael Murphy, Mariel
Hemingway and Meryl Streep.
Written by Woody Allen and
Marshall Brickman. Photography
by Gordon Willis. Music by
George Gershwin.

Norma Rae * * # *
Biograph, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Hy
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—J.M.

Bldik Orpheus * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The myth of Orpheus and
Eurydice is relocated to carnival
time in Rio with impressive re

well suited to the myth: this film
has more life in it than most of
Michael Cacoyannis' versions of
the Greek myths which are os
tensibly more faithful to their set
ting and usually end up being
mummified. Breno Mello plays
Orpheus; Marcel Camus di
rected.
—J.M.
Dear Inspector * ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not even the immensely
talented Annie Girardot can sal
vage much of this sometimes
over-violent, sometimes cloying
mystery-romance. It's a
thoroughly unconvincing movie.
Girardot is a "lady detective";
when she take time out from her
latest case to get her hair done it's
supposed to be very funny, but
isn't. Phillipe Noiret co-stars;
Phillipe De Broca, who made
King of Hearts, directed. (1977)

The Champ *
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac

start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the tate of (on Voight
and Faye capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.

Superman ★ * *
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com

shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
»vonder it makes up with an ex

Fhe movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try

finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

Coming Hume * * * *
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, Coming

sionally sutlers from poor transi

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With |ohn Sav

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and lack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
—R.L.
Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, Jason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton Ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.
JanTroell directed; Sven Nykvist
was the cinematographer. M




'ill Clayburtth «ind Lisa Lucas (top) are featured in An Unmarried
Woman. The 197H film plays Sunday and Monday at the New
Varsity. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton (center) star in Manhat
tan, which can l>e seen at the Palo Alto Square. Breno Mello
portrays a modern-day Orpheus in Black Orpheus, playing Tues
day and Wednesday at the New Varsity.

The Apartment ★ * ★ *
Friday, Kresge
Jack Lemmon plays a man who
seeks to crawl up the executive
ladder by loaning out his apart

employers. One of the women
who is often brought for a re
ndezvous is Shirley Maclaine.
Lemmon and Maclaine fall in

Billy (Sunset Boulevard) Wilder
directed this bittersweet ro

good performances, including
one by Fred Mac Murray (this was
before he became the archetypal
stooge in Disney movies).

Clockwork Orange (4) * * * #
Old Mill, Mountain View
Stanley Kubrick transferred
Anthony Burgess' novel to the sc
reen by making a gruelingly vis

morality play set in the near fu
ture; the issue at stake is whether
individuality is more important
than the society that must deal
with the individual. Malcolm
McDowell stars as a man whose
joy comes mainly from commit
ting acts of violence; he is ar
rested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this
singularly disturbing film.

Fine Arts, Palo Alto * * * *
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe

Blier himself, Handkerchiefs is
the story of Solange, a woman
who, after failing with her hus
band and a lover, finds solace in
the arms of a 13-year-old boy with
an IQ of 158. The twist is that the
story is told from an unabashedly

Ingrid Bergman won her sec

director Roberto Rosellini was

over. Bergman plays an amnesiac
who is forced by Yul Brynner to
pretend that she is the missing
daughter of Czar Nicholas II so
that Brynner can steal the inheri

period when both amnesiacs and
Yul Brynner were thought to be

An Unmarried Woman
Biograph
Writer-director Paul Mazurs
ky's faintly feminist look at '70s
divorce is perhaps a little too
smooth, but Jill Clayburgh's per
formance is so richly tender and
comic that that really doesn't
matter. It'sa soaringand convinc
ing piece of acting, neatly com
plemented by Alan Bates' per
formance as the man who nearly
convinces Clayburgh to make a
commitment again. With Michael
Murphy. (1978)

Semi-Tough * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
If you liked the book by Sports
Illustrated writer/derni-god Dan

the hell happened to it on the
way to this Michael (Smile)
Ritchie movie. Ritchie is in
terested in about 10 too many
things, and this movie often ap

Manhattan * ★ * *
Palo Alto Square
'S Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his
70s trilogy with a film that will
rank as one of the few master
pieces of this decade. Manhattan
is a bitterly funny examination of
a city and a lifestyle. It bites close
enough to the bone to be both
hilarious and oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton,
Michael Murphy, Mariel
Hemingway and Meryl Streep.
Written by Woody Allen and
Marshall Brickman. Photography

Norma Rae * * # *
Biograph, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Hy
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.

Bldik Orpheus * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The myth of Orpheus and
Eurydice is relocated to carnival
time in Rio with impressive re

well suited to the myth: this film
has more life in it than most of
Michael Cacoyannis' versions of
the Greek myths which are os
tensibly more faithful to their set
ting and usually end up being
mummified. Breno Mello plays
Orpheus; Marcel Camus di
rected.
—J.M.
Dear Inspector * ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not even the immensely
talented Annie Girardot can sal
vage much of this sometimes
over-violent, sometimes cloying
mystery-romance. It's a
thoroughly unconvincing movie.
Girardot is a "lady detective";
when she take time out from her
latest case to get her hair done it's
supposed to be very funny, but
isn't. Phillipe Noiret co-stars;
Phillipe De Broca, who made
King of Hearts, directed. (1977)

The Champ *
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac

start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the tate of (on Voight
and Faye capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.

Superman ★ * *
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com

shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, a remarkable number of
right decisions are made, and
what the movie lacks in childlike
»vonder it makes up with an ex

Fhe movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try

finishes rather breathlessly. As
Lois Lane, Margot Kidder is the
best thing in the movie — she
brings out the sexiness we always
knew Lois Lane had.

Coming Hume * * * *
Old Mill, Mountain View

sionally sutlers from poor transi

Hair * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a re
ckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
n' roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With |ohn Sav

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and lack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
—R.L.
Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, Jason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton Ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.
JanTroell directed; Sven Nykvist
was the cinematographer. M




'ill Clayburtth «ind Lisa Lucas (top) are featured in An Unmarried
Woman. The 197H film plays Sunday and Monday at the New
Varsity. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton (center) star in Manhat
tan, which can l>e seen at the Palo Alto Square. Breno Mello
portrays a modern-day Orpheus in Black Orpheus, playing Tues
day and Wednesday at the New Varsity.

The Apartment ★ * ★ *
Friday, Kresge
Jack Lemmon plays a man who
seeks to crawl up the executive
ladder by loaning out his apart

employers. One of the women
who is often brought for a re
ndezvous is Shirley Maclaine.
Lemmon and Maclaine fall in
love.
Billy (Sunset Boulevard) Wilder
directed this bittersweet ro

scenes, some fine black and

good performances, including
one by Fred Mac Murray (this was
before he became the archetypal
stooge in Disney movies).

Clockwork Orange (4) * * * #
Old Mill, Mountain View
Stanley Kubrick transferred
Anthony Burgess' novel to the sc
reen by making a gruelingly vis
ual film. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near fu
ture; the issue at stake is whether
individuality is more important
than the society that must deal
with the individual. Malcolm
McDowell stars as a man whose
joy comes mainly from commit
ting acts of violence; he is ar
rested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this
singularly disturbing film.

Ciet Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto * * * *
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Handkerchiefs is
the story of Solange, a woman
who, after failing with her hus
band and a lover, finds solace in
the arms of a 13-year-old boy with
an IQ of 158. The twist is that the
story is told from an unabashedly
male viewpoint: the plot may be
long to Solange, but the movie's
meaning belongs solely to the
male characters. Gerard Depar

Laure star.

Anastasia * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman won her sec
ond Academy Award for this
movie, but she probably got the
Oscar less for her performance
than to commemorate her return
to Hollywood after her then
scandalous romance with Italian
director Roberto Rosellini was

over. Bergman plays an amnesiac
who is forced by Yul Brynner to
pretend that she is the missing
daughter of Czar Nicholas II so
that Brynner can steal the inheri
tance. Even though this was a
period when both amnesiacs and
Yul Brynner were thought to be

The Long Goodbye * * *
Saturday, Cubberley
Elliott Could just might be the
most offbeat Philip Marlowe im

dreamy and very funny Robert
Altman movie. Altman set the
Raymond Chandler mystery in
the '70s; he doesn't just change
the setting — he rethinks the
novel to fit his playful (in this
case) vision of L A. This is one of
Altman's most laid-back movies,
and perhaps so subtle that it will
go right by you — it's no accident
that this movie failed at the box
office. (1975)

No Time For Breakfast # * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
Breakfast is a fine, sometimes
moving examination of a doctor
who discovers how comfortless
the ministrations of his profes
sion can be when she is
dying of cancer. Annie Cirardot is
very good as the doctor; she
manages to avoid slipping into
the potential bathos of the sub
ject. Isabelle (The Lacemaker)
Huppert is featured in a small
role. Jean-Louis Bertucelli di
rected. (1978)

Picnic at Hanging Rock * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.
—J.M.

The Deer Hunter ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking > on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than relays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen

The premise of this film is an

Dear Inspector * ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not even the immensely
talented Annie Girardot can sal
vage much of this sometimes
over-violent, sometimes cloying
mystery-romance. It's a
thoroughly unconvincing movie.
Girardot is a "lady detective";
when she take time out from her
latest case to get her hair done it's
supposed to be very funny, but
isn't. Phillipe Noiret co-stars;
Phillipe De Broca, who made
King of Hearts, directed. (1977)

The Champ *
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry
ing about is the tate of (on Voight
and Faye capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance
after half a decade makes things
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.

Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A great musical fantasy that's

Milos Forman (One Flew Over

fectly captures the timeless, rock

'60s and makes it live again. It's a

even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power

been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy

lane Fonda and lack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.

Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the

one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, Jason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton Ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.
JanTroell directed; Sven Nykvist
was the cinematographer. M




'ill Clayburtth «ind Lisa Lucas (top) are featured in An Unmarried
Woman. The 197H film plays Sunday and Monday at the New
Varsity. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton (center) star in Manhat

portrays a modern-day Orpheus in Black Orpheus, playing Tues
day and Wednesday at the New Varsity.

The Apartment ★ * ★ *
Friday, Kresge
Jack Lemmon plays a man who
seeks to crawl up the executive
ladder by loaning out his apart
ment to his furtively adulterous
employers. One of the women
who is often brought for a re
ndezvous is Shirley Maclaine.
Lemmon and Maclaine fall in
love.
Billy (Sunset Boulevard) Wilder
directed this bittersweet ro

one by Fred Mac Murray (this was
before he became the archetypal
stooge in Disney movies).

Clockwork Orange (4) * * * #
Old Mill, Mountain View
Stanley Kubrick transferred
Anthony Burgess' novel to the sc
reen by making a gruelingly vis
ual film. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near fu
ture; the issue at stake is whether
individuality is more important
than the society that must deal
with the individual. Malcolm
McDowell stars as a man whose
joy comes mainly from commit
ting acts of violence; he is ar
rested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this
singularly disturbing film.

Ciet Out Your Handkerchiefs
Fine Arts, Palo Alto * * * *
Bertrand Blier directed this
comedic mutation — it's so diffe
rent it's bound to take any audi
ence by surprise. According to
Blier himself, Handkerchiefs is
the story of Solange, a woman
who, after failing with her hus
band and a lover, finds solace in
the arms of a 13-year-old boy with
an IQ of 158. The twist is that the
story is told from an unabashedly
male viewpoint: the plot may be
long to Solange, but the movie's
meaning belongs solely to the
male characters. Gerard Depar
dieu, Patrick Dewaere and Carol
Laure star.

Anastasia * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman won her sec
ond Academy Award for this
movie, but she probably got the
Oscar less for her performance
than to commemorate her return
to Hollywood after her then
scandalous romance with Italian
director Roberto Rosellini was

over. Bergman plays an amnesiac
who is forced by Yul Brynner to
pretend that she is the missing
daughter of Czar Nicholas II so
that Brynner can steal the inheri
tance. Even though this was a
period when both amnesiacs and
Yul Brynner were thought to be

The Long Goodbye * * *
Saturday, Cubberley
Elliott Could just might be the
most offbeat Philip Marlowe im
aginable, but he fits right into this
dreamy and very funny Robert
Altman movie. Altman set the
Raymond Chandler mystery in
the '70s; he doesn't just change
the setting — he rethinks the
novel to fit his playful (in this
case) vision of L A. This is one of
Altman's most laid-back movies,
and perhaps so subtle that it will
go right by you — it's no accident
that this movie failed at the box
office. (1975)

No Time For Breakfast # * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Although the stupid title seems
designed to keep people away,
Breakfast is a fine, sometimes
moving examination of a doctor
who discovers how comfortless
the ministrations of his profes
sion can be when she is
dying of cancer. Annie Cirardot is
very good as the doctor; she
manages to avoid slipping into
the potential bathos of the sub
ject. Isabelle (The Lacemaker)
Huppert is featured in a small
role. Jean-Louis Bertucelli di
rected. (1978)

Picnic at Hanging Rock * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.

The Deer Hunter ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking > on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than relays
an attempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen

Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one ot his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancim
run amuck.

fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair just
might be the truest picture of the
'60s ever made. With |ohn Sav

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and lack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.

Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, Jason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton Ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.
JanTroell directed; Sven Nykvist
was the cinematographer. M
