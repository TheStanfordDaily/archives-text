# Alum, student explore rural Africa
## 
### Chris Mills 
Sleeping on straw mats, hav
ing no electricity or running
water, cooking outdoors over a
wood fire â€” these are not the
living conditions most
students expect to find in an
overseas studies program.
But Kin Euell and Keith Ar
chuleta will forego the comforts
of Cliveden for the extraordi
nary experience of living,
working and studying with
rural Africans for two months
this summer.
Euell, a junior in interna
tional relations and African and
Afro-American studies, and
Archuleta, a 1978 Stanford
graduate and consultant to the
California Assembly Ways and
Means Committee, have been
selected for Operation Cros
sroads Africa, one of the few
African overseas programs av
ailable to students here.

Based in New York, Opera
tion Crossroads sends Ameri
can volunteers into rural com
munities in West and Central
Africa to work on development
projects ranging from building
schools and planting coffee to
immunizing villagers and pre
serving local cultural tradi
tions.
"We'll be pretty much
roughing it," Euell admitted,
"but for me it will help to put a
lot of things into focus." She
said she and other Black
Americans are aware of the
turmoil and problems in Africa,
"and it makes us want to do
something about it."
Euell has performed with Af
rican dance groups on the East
and West Coasts, has been a
member of the Committees on
Black Performing Arts and the
Stanford Lively Arts. She is also
promotion manager for ASSU
Special Events. This will be her

first trip to Africa.
"I'm not expectng to come
back the same person I left as,"
she remarked.
Archuleta is a former co
president of the Black Student
Union and a co-founder of the
Black Media Institute here. He
has never studied overseas.
"I had chances to get to
Cliveden or Italy, but I always
wanted to go to Africa," he
said. "There's a lot of art, sci
ence, literature, social organi
zation and social values that
have come from Africa.
"Most of us have had little
contact with what Africa is all
about," Archuleta explained,
citing the "warped image" of
the African continent that is
presented to Americans via Tar
zan and other jungle movies.
Archuleta said he doesn't
know which country or prog
ram he will be assigned to, but

added he hopes to develop
health care education in rural
communities of Nigeria, Niger
or Ghana.
After six weeks in their as
signed communities, Cros
sroads volunteers will be al
lowed two weeks of group
travel. Euell said she also wants
to do some dancing and to visit
Kenyan writer Ngugi wa
Thiong'o.
"I hope to use the travel time
to go to other countries and
villages and compare their
health care and government
systems," Archuleta said. He
will film his Crossroads experi
ences for presentation in East
Palo Alto schools next year.
To help pay the cost of going
to Africa, Euell and Archuleta
are planning fundraising
events this month, their first
being a booth at the Spring
Faire.
