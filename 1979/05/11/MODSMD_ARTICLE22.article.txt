Happy bee-day
Graduate student Fredi Kronenberg and Tom Traficanti (above) of Bellarmine Preparatory
Academy displayed the rarely visible skills of beekeeping while responding to a swarm of bees
near Memorial Church Wednesday. Traficanti gathers the remainder of the 10,000 bees that
didn't go directly into the beehive.
