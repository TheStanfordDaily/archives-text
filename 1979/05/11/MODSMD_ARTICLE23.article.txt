## Pre-Garp escape from Hietzinger Zoo 
### 
Setting Free the Bean
John Irving
Pocket Books
340 pp. $2.50
The phenomenal success
and critical acclaim of John Irv
ing's latest novel, The World
According To Carp, has, of
course, prompted his pub
lisher to resurrect his other
three novels and push them
onto drugstore racks in hope
of sale through association.
Setting Free The Bears, Irving's
first novel, is the last of-these
books to be born again, and it
displays much of the wacky
originality, thoughtful under
tones, and narrative skill that
so distinguishes Carp.
Reading Irving's earlier
novels after experiencing
Garp's world, however, is an
experience which elicits feel
ings first of intense deja vu but
then of lingering disappoint
ment. Considering Irving's
febrile imagination, it is ironic
that the deja vu stems from the
repetition of similar subplots
and characters between his
novels.
The disappointment,
moreover, arises when the
reader eventually comes to
realize that when he read Carp,
he witnessed what Irving had
been experimenting with,

molding and remolding, finally
shaped into what the author
was aiming for all along. Read
ing the early novels after such
an insight is perhaps entertain
ing but is nevertheless akin to
rereading rough drafts: at
times enlightening but usually
anticlimactic.
Butwithout(ordespite) such
hindsight, Setting Free The
Bears has much to recommend
it. Told through the eyes of
Hannes Graff, a disenchanted
Viennese student, the first part
of the novel relates how he and
his fellow conspirator, Sieg
fried Javotnik, leave Vienna in
the springtime to roam Austria
on a vintage Royal Enfield
motorcycle formerly owned, it
turns out, by Siggy's father dur
ing World War 11.
Before leaving Vienna,
though, Siggy and Hans visit the
Hietzinger Zoo, and Siggy be
comes obsessed with the idea
of setting the animals free. His
obsession grows as they travel,
and when Siggy and Hannes
become, for some reason,
criminally involved in one of
Irving's great but inexplicable
comic scenes (there's a
milkman and a horse and a
naked Siggy, but never mind),
Siggy decides it is an oppor
tune time to reconnoiter the
Hietzinger Zoo to make plans
for the great escape.
Master of frozen moment
He returns just as Hannes is
being forced to tend bees in
retribution for his involvement
in the catastrophe. He and
Hannes rendezvous and at
tempt to make a last-minute es
cape on the motorcycle, but a
truck laden with dozens of
bees somehow gets in the way.
Irving, a master of the frozen
narrative moment, suspends
Hannes in midair amid the
buzzing of the lazily toppling
bees, while Siggy and the
motorcycle slide in slow mo
tion under the truck.
Much of the rest of the book
is a transcription of the honey
sodden notebook which Siggy
was carrying. The notebook
section of the novel, approxi

mately one half of its total
length, interweaves Siggy's
"Zoo Watches" in Vienna with
his autobiography and stories
of his father's escapes just be
fore the Austrian Anschluss.
Irving does a decent job at link
ing the subplots with the main
story, but this section has
perhaps the weakest chapters
of the novel, since the narra
tive flow is so often bogged
down with historical facts.
When the notebook ends,
we return to the world of Han
nes Graff, who returns to Vie
nna to carry out the mission of
Setting Free the Bears.
This first novel, then, is orig
inal and enjoyable on its own
level, but both these qualities
pale considerably when the
book is compared to Carp.
Some similarity of subplots and
characters is of course explain
able, especially considering
that Carp is a purposefully
self-conscious and self
reflecting novel.
But if we look at what Irving
is doing in all his novels, Set
ting Free The Bears can only be
seen as one of his lesser works.
Irving writes in many ways
about the same things Joseph
Heller writes about: people
who feel psychologically trap
ped and who are looking for a
way out. It is for this reason

that the thematic obsession
with releasing animals from the
zoo has continued to ripple
through Irving's books, de
spite the full treatment of that
obsession in the first novel he
wrote.
Hallucinatory optimism
Siggy and Hannes feel trap
ped in Vienna and in life; the
animals are literally trapped in
the zoo; Garp is trapped by his
past which he has done every
thing to avoid but which ulti
mately executes him. Hannes
releases the animals only to see
them, in turn, killed by ad hoc
hunters, and he realizes it
would have been better to
have left them alone in their
cages. But the ending loses it
self in needless complexities
just as the notebook, which
forms the middle section of the
novel, lost itself in needless
historical intricacy. The ex
treme pessimism of the end
ing, for example, is suddenly
contradicted by an uplifting
but hallucinatory optimism in
the last short chapter.
Still, anyone who reads this
book must recognize that Irv
ing possesses a profound im
agination and talent for narra
tion. Despite its problems, Sef
ting Free The Bears merits read
ing on that basis alone.

spite the full treatment of that
obsession in the first novel he
wrote.
Hallucinatory optimism
Siggy and Hannes feel trap
ped in Vienna and in life; the
animals are literally trapped in
the zoo; Garp is trapped by his
past which he has done every
thing to avoid but which ulti
mately executes him. Hannes
releases the animals only to see
them, in turn, killed by ad hoc
hunters, and he realizes it
would have been better to
have left them alone in their
cages. But the ending loses it
self in needless complexities
just as the notebook, which
forms the middle section of the
novel, lost itself in needless
historical intricacy. The ex
treme pessimism of the end
ing, for example, is suddenly
contradicted by an uplifting
but hallucinatory optimism in
the last short chapter.
Still, anyone who reads this
book must recognize that Irv
ing possesses a profound im
agination and talent for narra
tion. Despite its problems, Sef
ting Free The Bears merits read
ing on that basis alone.

Setting Free the Bean
John Irving
Pocket Books
340 pp. $2.50
The phenomenal success
and critical acclaim of John Irv
ing's latest novel, The World
According To Carp, has, of
course, prompted his pub
lisher to resurrect his other
three novels and push them
onto drugstore racks in hope
of sale through association.
Setting Free The Bears, Irving's
first novel, is the last of-these
books to be born again, and it
displays much of the wacky
originality, thoughtful under
tones, and narrative skill that
so distinguishes Carp.
Reading Irving's earlier
novels after experiencing
Garp's world, however, is an
experience which elicits feel
ings first of intense deja vu but
then of lingering disappoint
ment. Considering Irving's
febrile imagination, it is ironic
that the deja vu stems from the
repetition of similar subplots
and characters between his
novels.
The disappointment,
moreover, arises when the
reader eventually comes to
realize that when he read Carp,
he witnessed what Irving had
been experimenting with,

molding and remolding, finally
shaped into what the author
was aiming for all along. Read
ing the early novels after such
an insight is perhaps entertain
ing but is nevertheless akin to
rereading rough drafts: at
times enlightening but usually
anticlimactic.
Butwithout(ordespite) such
hindsight, Setting Free The
Bears has much to recommend
it. Told through the eyes of
Hannes Graff, a disenchanted
Viennese student, the first part
of the novel relates how he and
his fellow conspirator, Sieg
fried Javotnik, leave Vienna in
the springtime to roam Austria
on a vintage Royal Enfield
motorcycle formerly owned, it
turns out, by Siggy's father dur
ing World War 11.
Before leaving Vienna,
though, Siggy and Hans visit the
Hietzinger Zoo, and Siggy be
comes obsessed with the idea
of setting the animals free. His
obsession grows as they travel,
and when Siggy and Hannes
become, for some reason,
criminally involved in one of
Irving's great but inexplicable
comic scenes (there's a
milkman and a horse and a
naked Siggy, but never mind),
Siggy decides it is an oppor
tune time to reconnoiter the
Hietzinger Zoo to make plans
for the great escape.
Master of frozen moment
He returns just as Hannes is
being forced to tend bees in
retribution for his involvement
in the catastrophe. He and
Hannes rendezvous and at
tempt to make a last-minute es
cape on the motorcycle, but a
truck laden with dozens of
bees somehow gets in the way.
Irving, a master of the frozen
narrative moment, suspends
Hannes in midair amid the
buzzing of the lazily toppling
bees, while Siggy and the
motorcycle slide in slow mo
tion under the truck.
Much of the rest of the book
is a transcription of the honey
sodden notebook which Siggy
was carrying. The notebook
section of the novel, approxi

mately one half of its total
length, interweaves Siggy's
"Zoo Watches" in Vienna with
his autobiography and stories
of his father's escapes just be
fore the Austrian Anschluss.
Irving does a decent job at link
ing the subplots with the main
story, but this section has
perhaps the weakest chapters
of the novel, since the narra
tive flow is so often bogged
down with historical facts.
When the notebook ends,
we return to the world of Han
nes Graff, who returns to Vie
nna to carry out the mission of
Setting Free the Bears.
This first novel, then, is orig
inal and enjoyable on its own
level, but both these qualities
pale considerably when the
book is compared to Carp.
Some similarity of subplots and
characters is of course explain
able, especially considering
that Carp is a purposefully
self-conscious and self
reflecting novel.
But if we look at what Irving
is doing in all his novels, Set
ting Free The Bears can only be
seen as one of his lesser works.
Irving writes in many ways
about the same things Joseph
Heller writes about: people
who feel psychologically trap
ped and who are looking for a
way out. It is for this reason

that the thematic obsession
with releasing animals from the
zoo has continued to ripple
through Irving's books, de
spite the full treatment of that
obsession in the first novel he
wrote.
