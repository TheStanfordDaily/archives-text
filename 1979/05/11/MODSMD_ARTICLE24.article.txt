The Flounder
Gunther Grass
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
$10.95
It's a rare book that can make
you belch with pleasure. Rarer
still is the novel with a fish as
the hero. But Gunther Grass'
latest work, The Flounder, is
both of these. It's a good
natured encyclopaedic look at
love, eating and history.
During each epoch of man
kind's history, the Flounder, a
male-chauvinist W.C. Fields of
a fish, pops out of the water
and advises a man how to get
out from under the thumb of
woman. Our hero is snared in
the '70s by some radical
feminists, put on trial and
blamed for male domination
and the bad way history has
turned out in general. Before
the Tribunal can pass verdict it
must judge history, technol
ogy, love, war and religion.
This silly fish story changes
in Grass' hands to a universal
celebration of eating, sex and
the parts of us that are most
bestial. There are more than

five hundred recipes sprinkled
liberally throughout the book,
some of them good, some ap
palling. I recommend the tur
bot poached in yogurt with
pepper and juniper berries,
but am less enthusiastic about
the beef hearts stuffed with
prunes and boiled in beer. The
recipes are designed to dis
lodge our normal tastes and
challenge our appetites to be
open, to experiment, and to
pig out. Grass is after a soul
burp—and if you eat enough
mutton with pears and string
beans, your soul just might.
No book by a man has tried
so hard to give women a place
(indeed the most vital place) in
the world. As the Flounder
points out, what we need are
some great female comic
characters, some distaff
Falstaffs. There are eleven
superwomen in Flounder, and
among them, the Abbess Greta
Rusch, alias Fat Greta, is a good
candidate for such a comic
heroine. Fat, jolly, lusty, good
with tripe, Fat Greta is the
world in all of its aspects.

Pain and suffering are not
absent from the book, how
ever, and as the story nears the
present, Flounder's tone rises
to confusion, fear and outrage.
Wars uproot lives; ideological
strife alienates nations,
peoples and even sexes. Finally
we encounter Grass' fear that
the male may be responsible
for it all; perhaps it is time to
return to an ahistorical woman
rule and forget the macho
thrust of Progress, Ideals, Re
ligion and Sex.
For all the squalor of the
Middle Ages and violence of
the Renaissance, Flounder's
two most troubling images
occur in the present: a Hell's
Angels gang rape on Father's
Day, and an affair which is con
summated but can never
satisfy.
The translation is a good stab
at an impossible task. The un
even prose lacks Grass' good
humored word-play in Ger
man, and the poems are no
longer poetry, but prose in
lines that sound awkward and
tinny.
Still, Flounder is an exhilarat
ing, corrupt and fish-eyed view
of almost everything; the
,Flounder calls upon us to stuff
ourselves, have full and smelly
sex, and never stop question
ing where we are and why. Like
a heavily peppered bowl of
pork and cabbage, this novel is
a risk for the palette, a bit too
much to digest, and a main
course that leaves the partaker
bloated but satisfied.

occur in the present: a Hell's
Angels gang rape on Father's
Day, and an affair which is con
summated but can never
satisfy.
The translation is a good stab
at an impossible task. The un
even prose lacks Grass' good
humored word-play in Ger
man, and the poems are no
longer poetry, but prose in
lines that sound awkward and
tinny.
Still, Flounder is an exhilarat
ing, corrupt and fish-eyed view
of almost everything; the
,Flounder calls upon us to stuff
ourselves, have full and smelly
sex, and never stop question
ing where we are and why. Like
a heavily peppered bowl of
pork and cabbage, this novel is
a risk for the palette, a bit too
much to digest, and a main
course that leaves the partaker
bloated but satisfied.
