If vou're looking for a fast-moving,
interesting book for warm spring after
noons, pass this one up. But if you're
doing research into "free press" issues
and related legal matters, this summary
of news articles can be quite helpful.
Put together by the New York Times
Information Service, the book sum
marizes stories, editorials, and opin
ions pieces from the New York Times
and other leading publications in five

areas of journalistic/legal confrontation
which have been in the national spot
light : trial coverage and pre-trial public
ity (usually known as the "free press
fair trial" controversy); confidentiality
of news sources; the Farber case
(the Times devoted one section to the
jailing of one of its reporters for failing
to disclose confidential information);
police searches of newspaper offices;
and the use of TV cameras in the cour
troom.
Besides short summaries of impor
tant news articles, each section con
cludes with reprints of New York Times
articles and comments on these issues.
The book also contains information on

problems between the Canadian press
and its government, which is a good
sign that the American news media are
finally paying attention to press prob
lems next door.
Keeping the researchers in mind, the
Times' articles in the book carry both
their page and column numbers in the
relevant Times issue and the article's
microfiche number. Since more stu
dents in journalism, law, and political
science are studying these issues, they
should keep this book in mind. They
should also keep ih mind its price, and
try the libraries before purchasing it.
