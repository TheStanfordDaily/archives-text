# Cards play Cal for second
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The last regular-season
series for the Stanford baseball
team gets underway today at
2:30 p.m. in sun-drenched
Sunken Diamond. The Cardi
nals pair up with cross-bay rival
California in a struggle for the
second-place finish in the
Southern Division of the
Pacific-10.
With a three-game sweep of
the Bears, Stanford could earn
a play-off berth in this year's
NCAA championship—
something not even the senior
members of this year's team
have ever experienced.
But luck will have to be on
the Cardinals' side if their
hopes are to become reality. In
addition to winning all three of
their games against Cal, sole
possession of second place will
belong to the Cards only if
UCLA sweeps USC and Arizona
State sweeps Arizona.
Stanford is currently in fifth
place in the division with a
12-15 record. Meanwhile USC,
Arizona and Cal are all tied for
second place with records of
14-13. UCLA has already
clinched the division title.

Stanford will be totally
eliminated from post-season
competition if two out of three
of its games this weekend go to
Cal, or if either USC or Arizona
win at least two out of three of
their games. Other combina
tions of wins and losses will re
sult in a two-way or three-way
tie for second and an ensuing
intra-division playoff.
The team finally finishing
second in the standings will
meet the first-place finisher in
the Northern Division of the
Pac-10 (comprised of
Washington State,
Washington, Oregon State and
Oregon.) That game will de
termine the second team from
the Pac-10 to advance with
UCLA to the NCAAs.
Looking ahead to the possi
bility of playing in the NCAA
championship, and coming off
a near three-game sweep of the
number one-ranked UCLA
Bruins last weekend, the Cards
are fired up for this weekend's
clash.
"We've never been in this
situation before—at least as
long as I've been here," said
Cards' senior pitcher Joe LoP

resti. "It's nice to have some
thing to play for for our last
weekend."
LoPresti is scheduled to start
the first game of Saturday's
doubleheader that will be
played at Evans Field in Ber
keley. In addition to the
California batters, LoPresti will
have to battle the often-times
abrasive Berkeley rooters.
"I hear everything they say,"
LoPresti said of the Cal rooters,
"but it doesn't affect me. I'm
looking forward to pitching
. . . I've always pitched my best
against Cal."
Berkeley will send Chuck
Hensley (4-5) to the mound
against LoPresti (8-5). In to
day's opener, Brian Duffy,
Cal's 6-foot-5,195 pound lefth
ander, will challenge Stan
ford's ace Bruce Fiala (9-4). In
the final game of the series, Cal
will throw either Chuck Cary or
Dave Johnson and Stanford
will go with either Brian Harri
son or Larry Kuhn.
The biggest batting threats to
Cardinal pitchers will be the
Bears' third baseman Greg
Zunino, outfielder Cary
Zunino and shortstop Rod
Booker. The three Bears boast
batting averages of .353, .341
and .339 respectively.
Second baseman Paul

Zuvella should lead the Cards'
offense as he is currently en
joying a hot streak in Pac-10
play. Zuvella is the team's lead
ing batterwith a .396 average in
league play.
During the past week, Stan
ford played two non
conference games to tune up
for the Berkeley series. Tues
day the team nipped St. Mary's
5-4 in a come-from-behind vic
tory. Wednesday the Cards
caught themselves looking
ahead to Cal when they fell too
far behind Santa Clara to pull
out another last-minute win.
The Cards scored four runs
in the bottom of the ninth in
ning, but suffered a 10-4
pounding by the Broncos.
"We played good defense,"
said Cardinal coach Mark Mar
quess, "they just hit the ball."
Stanford first baseman John
Pyle summed up the hefty de
feat when he said, "It was just
one of those games you can't
get too excited about. We'll be
ready for Cal."

With a three-game sweep of
the Bears, Stanford could earn
a play-off berth in this year's
NCAA championship—
something not even the senior
members of this year's team
have ever experienced.
But luck will have to be on
the Cardinals' side if their
hopes are to become reality. In
addition to winning all three of
their games against Cal, sole
possession of second place will
belong to the Cards only if
UCLA sweeps USC and Arizona
State sweeps Arizona.
Stanford is currently in fifth
place in the division with a
12-15 record. Meanwhile USC,
Arizona and Cal are all tied for
second place with records of
14-13. UCLA has already
clinched the division title.

Stanford will be totally
eliminated from post-season
competition if two out of three
of its games this weekend go to
Cal, or if either USC or Arizona
win at least two out of three of
their games. Other combina
tions of wins and losses will re
sult in a two-way or three-way
tie for second and an ensuing
intra-division playoff.
The team finally finishing
second in the standings will
meet the first-place finisher in
the Northern Division of the
Pac-10 (comprised of
Washington State,
Washington, Oregon State and
Oregon.) That game will de
termine the second team from
the Pac-10 to advance with
UCLA to the NCAAs.
Looking ahead to the possi
bility of playing in the NCAA
championship, and coming off
a near three-game sweep of the
number one-ranked UCLA
Bruins last weekend, the Cards
are fired up for this weekend's
clash.
"We've never been in this
situation before—at least as
long as I've been here," said
Cards' senior pitcher Joe LoP

resti. "It's nice to have some
thing to play for for our last
weekend."
LoPresti is scheduled to start
the first game of Saturday's
doubleheader that will be
played at Evans Field in Ber
keley. In addition to the
California batters, LoPresti will
have to battle the often-times
abrasive Berkeley rooters.
"I hear everything they say,"
LoPresti said of the Cal rooters,
"but it doesn't affect me. I'm
looking forward to pitching
. . . I've always pitched my best
against Cal."
Berkeley will send Chuck
Hensley (4-5) to the mound
against LoPresti (8-5). In to
day's opener, Brian Duffy,
Cal's 6-foot-5,195 pound lefth
ander, will challenge Stan
ford's ace Bruce Fiala (9-4). In
the final game of the series, Cal
will throw either Chuck Cary or
Dave Johnson and Stanford
will go with either Brian Harri
son or Larry Kuhn.
The biggest batting threats to
Cardinal pitchers will be the
Bears' third baseman Greg
Zunino, outfielder Cary
Zunino and shortstop Rod
Booker. The three Bears boast
batting averages of .353, .341
and .339 respectively.
Second baseman Paul

Zuvella should lead the Cards'
offense as he is currently en
joying a hot streak in Pac-10
play. Zuvella is the team's lead
ing batterwith a .396 average in
league play.
During the past week, Stan
ford played two non
conference games to tune up
for the Berkeley series. Tues
day the team nipped St. Mary's
5-4 in a come-from-behind vic
tory. Wednesday the Cards
caught themselves looking
ahead to Cal when they fell too
far behind Santa Clara to pull
out another last-minute win.
The Cards scored four runs
in the bottom of the ninth in
ning, but suffered a 10-4
pounding by the Broncos.
"We played good defense,"
said Cardinal coach Mark Mar
quess, "they just hit the ball."
Stanford first baseman John
Pyle summed up the hefty de
feat when he said, "It was just
one of those games you can't
get too excited about. We'll be
ready for Cal."
