One down, one to go
With thrilling victories by Lloyd Bourne and
Peter Rennert, the men's tennis team beat USC
5-3 yesterday. The victory moved the Cards one
step closer to a national ranking in the top four,
as they prepare to face tomorrow the second of
their two tough southland opponents â€” the
top-ranked UCLA Bruins. For right now, the
Cards can savor yesterday's triumph, as Jeff
Brandon describes it on page 9 of today's Daily.
More odd than even
Although President Lyman, like the rest of us,
must line up to buy gas, University work vehicles
may fill up at their own private service station.
Rod Stevens explains why in today's Bug Me on
page 3.
The world before Garp
For author John Irving, that world probably
appeared much the same as it does in -His
critically-acclaimed novel. Judging by his re
cently published first book, which Peter
Kretzman reviews on page 7, Irving's febrile im
agination has been in the making for quite some
time.
The celluoid scene
A nuclear plant nearly explodes, a gumshoe
reporter discovers he can fly, and a married
woman falls in love with a 13-year-old. If those
subjects do not interest you, perhaps one or
more of the others explored in this week's
nearby movies will. Check CinemaScope on
page 5 for our weekly reviews.
