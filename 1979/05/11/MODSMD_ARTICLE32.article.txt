season tomorrow against the
Golden Bears of California. The
game will be played for the
Northern California champ
ionship and the right to travel
to Santa Barbara for the West
Coast Championships. Stan

in the past, but a tough Ber
keley squad promises to pro
vide quite a battle. The game
will take piace on the field bet
ween Maples Pavilion and the
Tennis Stadium at 1:45 p.m.
Going into this final game,
Stanford posts a 10-5 record

last two weeks, in Los Angeles
and Seattle, have served to
sharpen the Cards for tomor
row's game.
Stanford won the southern
tournament easily with three
wins over Claremont, USC and
San Diego State. Seattle
proved tougher as the laxmen
could only finish third, beating

Oak Parlor and Portland but
going down in sudden-death
overtime to Seattle.
Berkeley, on the other hand,
has also had an excellent sea
son — one of their best in
years. Their high point came in
a victory over powerhouse
UC-Santa Barbara, a team that
handed Stanford a 13-6 shel
lacking. As in other sports, the
lacrosse rivalry between Stan
ford and Cal is intense, and the
game will be a hard-fought,
physical matchup.
Stanford will once again de
pend on a core of highly
talented players. Kirk Phelps
(46 goals and 5 assists), Rick
Valentine (22.16), and Denny
Childs (goalie), will all need
good games, for their perfor
mances are vital to the team's
showing.
Montreal advances
Yvon Lambert steered in a
pass from Mario Tremblay for a
goal at 9:33 of overtime last

tive Stanley Cup championship.
In capturing the seventh and
deciding game of the National
Hockey League semifinal

outshooting Boston 52-30 but
were frustrated repeatedly by
goalie Gilles Gilbert, particu
larly in the overtime.
The Canadiens struck sud
denly for the winning goal
which extended their winning
streak at home against Boston
to 15 games.
Taking a pass from Rejean
