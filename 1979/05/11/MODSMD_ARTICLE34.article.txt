# Netters defeat USC, 5-3
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
After 11 hours of intense
tennis, Stanford completed the
second leg of its quest to be
come one of the top four
ranked teams in the nation by
defeating USC 5-3 yesterday.
The win gave the Cardinals an
8-1 Pac-10 record to tie them at

the top with top-ranked UCLA.
Those two teams will square off
here Saturday at 1 p.m. at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
At the outset of yesterday's
matches the Cards looked as if
they would run the Trojans out
of Palo Alto. Tim Mayotte, play
ing No. 3 jumped on SC's

Roger Knapp early. Mayotte
drilled three service return
winners in Knapp's first service
game for an early break. How
ever, that was only a preview of
things to come for Knapp.
Never really pressed, Mayotte
won the match, 6-2, 6-2 break
ing the hard-serving Knapp for
the match.
Scott Bondurant also made
things look easy with a 6-3, 6-1
victory over Doug Adler. He
also started fast, winning the
first two games of the match.
The second set was all Bondur
ant's. One game was all Adler
was to get, and Bondurant
closed out the match by break
ing Adler's serve for the third
time in the second set.
Displaying a vast array of
passing shots, )im Hodges won
the first set of his match, 6-4,
and it looked like the Cards
were off and running to an easy
victory. Such was not the case.
Using a wicked lefthanded
serve, Jack Kruger kept Hodges
guessing for the rest of the day
defeating Hodges 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Now given a glimmer of
hope, hard-hitting Sean Braw
ley promptly knotted the score
at 2-2, by edging Jeff Arons 7-5,
7-5. Bondurant and Hodges
then played one of their
poorest matches of the season
and all of a sudden the Cards
were down 3-2. Once again it
was the freshmen to the re
scue. Both Mayotte and Arons
and Kruger and Brawley held
serve to 5-5 and with the points
tied at 2-2, Arons hit a winning
forehand off a Kruger over
head, enabling the Cards to
pull off the break. Now playing
on pure emotion, Mayotte
bounced the overhead into the
stands on match point and the
match was dead even going
into Maples.
Coach Dick Gould called the
Maples matches the most excit
ing singles matches in the big
top since its inception in 1974.
Lloyd Bourne made a drama
tic comeback to put the Cards
ahead to stay with a 4-6,6-2,7-5
win over Billy Nealon. It looked
like a long night for the Cards
when Nealon broke Bourne in
his first service game to take a
2-0 lead, and pursued it to win
the first set 6-4.
Bourne, however, came
right back, breaking Nealon in
the first game of the second set
when Nealon netted an easy
forehand. Bourne totally
dominated the second set; at
one point Nealon was so frus
trated he abandoned his nor
mal backcourt game and
played serve and volley.
Bourne won that set easily 6-2.
That set up the third set, one
of the most exciting and
breathtaking in Maples history.
Nealon jumped to an early 4-1
lead, helped by the fact that
Bourne suffered a mental lapse

in the fourth game and missed
two easy volleys to lose his
serve. But with the crowd fully
behind him, Bourne kept his
poise and battled back. Bourne
finished off the match by
winning eight of the last 10
points. He described the finish
as "six of the best games of his
life."
The first singles match was
an awesome display of power
tennis. Hard-hitting Robert
Van't Hof of USC, the top
ranked collegian and Peter Re
nnert, the No. 10 ranked colle
gian, battled in a match of tieb
reakers with Rennert coming
out the victor 7-6,6-7, 7-6. Both
players served evenly, match
ing each other ace for ace to
6-6. With Van't Hof serving,
after a long backcourt rally,
Rennert pulled off an angled
backhand passing shot to win
himself the first set.
The second set neither
player was able to break. The
tiebreaker belonged com
pletely to Van't Hof, though.
After two service winners put
him up 2-0, Rennert tripped
and missed a volley to give
Van't Hof the 3-0 lead. An ex
cellent return of service and a
deep overhead closed out the
set.
Van't Hof looked like he
would start off the third set
with a break, but both players
then held service relatively eas
ily to 6-6 and in the final tieb
reaker, it was Rennert who
took control.
The victory by the crafty
junior gave the Cards an in
surmountable 5-3 lead. Be
cause of the lateness of the
hour, the first doubles match
was canceled.
The Cards, however, have
no time to celebrate, as they
will play host to the No. 1
ranked UCLA Bruins tomor
row. It is the final regular sea
son match for both teams and
both would like to go to the
NCAA tournament on a win
ning note. More importantly,
though, the Pac-10 title and the
NCAA team tournament seed
ings are on the line. The Bruins
(22-1) only lost one match this
year in a 5-4 defeat at the hands
of the young USC team. How
ever, last weekend at UCLA
Stadium, the Bruins reversed
the decision, blanking the Tro
jans 9-0.
Giant sophomore Fritz
Buehning (6-4, 192) keys the
UCLA attack. Similar to his
Stanford counterpart, Peter
Rennert, Buehning played No.
5 on last year's Bruin team.
Buehning's supporting cast
consists of Mike Harrington,
son of television actor Pat
Harrington, Dick Metz, Blaine
Willenborg, Marcel Freeman
and Bruce Berscia.

Soccer team playoff, Davis bound
Forward Ellen Griep guards a Cal State-Hay ward player during a match earlier this season. The Cardinals
will be in action tomorrow in the league playoffs at Davis, facing the league's fourth place team at 11
a.m. and playing again either at 3 p.m. or 5 p.m. Stanford earned one point by finishing first and
undefeated in league play, and goes after the second point needed to sweep the title in the round robin
playoffs. The Card second team beat Katherine Branson School of Kentfield 1-0 last Friday.
After 11 hours of intense
tennis, Stanford completed the
second leg of its quest to be
come one of the top four
ranked teams in the nation by
defeating USC 5-3 yesterday.
The win gave the Cardinals an
8-1 Pac-10 record to tie them at

the top with top-ranked UCLA.
Those two teams will square off
here Saturday at 1 p.m. at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
At the outset of yesterday's
matches the Cards looked as if
they would run the Trojans out
of Palo Alto. Tim Mayotte, play
ing No. 3 jumped on SC's

Roger Knapp early. Mayotte
drilled three service return
winners in Knapp's first service
game for an early break. How
ever, that was only a preview of
things to come for Knapp.
Never really pressed, Mayotte
won the match, 6-2, 6-2 break
ing the hard-serving Knapp for
the match.
Scott Bondurant also made
things look easy with a 6-3, 6-1
victory over Doug Adler. He
also started fast, winning the
first two games of the match.
The second set was all Bondur
ant's. One game was all Adler
was to get, and Bondurant
closed out the match by break
ing Adler's serve for the third
time in the second set.
Displaying a vast array of
passing shots, )im Hodges won
the first set of his match, 6-4,
and it looked like the Cards
were off and running to an easy
victory. Such was not the case.
Using a wicked lefthanded
serve, Jack Kruger kept Hodges
guessing for the rest of the day
defeating Hodges 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Now given a glimmer of
hope, hard-hitting Sean Braw
ley promptly knotted the score
at 2-2, by edging Jeff Arons 7-5,
7-5. Bondurant and Hodges
then played one of their
poorest matches of the season
and all of a sudden the Cards
were down 3-2. Once again it
was the freshmen to the re
scue. Both Mayotte and Arons
and Kruger and Brawley held
serve to 5-5 and with the points
tied at 2-2, Arons hit a winning
forehand off a Kruger over
head, enabling the Cards to
pull off the break. Now playing
on pure emotion, Mayotte
bounced the overhead into the
stands on match point and the
match was dead even going
into Maples.
Coach Dick Gould called the
Maples matches the most excit
ing singles matches in the big
top since its inception in 1974.
Lloyd Bourne made a drama
tic comeback to put the Cards
ahead to stay with a 4-6,6-2,7-5
win over Billy Nealon. It looked
like a long night for the Cards
when Nealon broke Bourne in
his first service game to take a
2-0 lead, and pursued it to win
the first set 6-4.
Bourne, however, came
right back, breaking Nealon in
the first game of the second set
when Nealon netted an easy
forehand. Bourne totally
dominated the second set; at
one point Nealon was so frus
trated he abandoned his nor
mal backcourt game and
played serve and volley.
Bourne won that set easily 6-2.
That set up the third set, one
of the most exciting and
breathtaking in Maples history.
Nealon jumped to an early 4-1
lead, helped by the fact that
Bourne suffered a mental lapse

in the fourth game and missed
two easy volleys to lose his
serve. But with the crowd fully
behind him, Bourne kept his
poise and battled back. Bourne
finished off the match by
winning eight of the last 10
points. He described the finish
as "six of the best games of his
life."
The first singles match was
an awesome display of power
tennis. Hard-hitting Robert
Van't Hof of USC, the top
ranked collegian and Peter Re
nnert, the No. 10 ranked colle
gian, battled in a match of tieb
reakers with Rennert coming
out the victor 7-6,6-7, 7-6. Both
players served evenly, match
ing each other ace for ace to
6-6. With Van't Hof serving,
after a long backcourt rally,
Rennert pulled off an angled
backhand passing shot to win
himself the first set.
The second set neither
player was able to break. The
tiebreaker belonged com
pletely to Van't Hof, though.
After two service winners put
him up 2-0, Rennert tripped
and missed a volley to give
Van't Hof the 3-0 lead. An ex
cellent return of service and a
deep overhead closed out the
set.
Van't Hof looked like he
would start off the third set
with a break, but both players
then held service relatively eas
ily to 6-6 and in the final tieb
reaker, it was Rennert who
took control.
The victory by the crafty
junior gave the Cards an in
surmountable 5-3 lead. Be
cause of the lateness of the
hour, the first doubles match
was canceled.
The Cards, however, have
no time to celebrate, as they
will play host to the No. 1
ranked UCLA Bruins tomor
row. It is the final regular sea
son match for both teams and
both would like to go to the
NCAA tournament on a win
ning note. More importantly,
though, the Pac-10 title and the
NCAA team tournament seed
ings are on the line. The Bruins
(22-1) only lost one match this
year in a 5-4 defeat at the hands
of the young USC team. How
ever, last weekend at UCLA
Stadium, the Bruins reversed
the decision, blanking the Tro
jans 9-0.
Giant sophomore Fritz
Buehning (6-4, 192) keys the
UCLA attack. Similar to his
Stanford counterpart, Peter
Rennert, Buehning played No.

Soccer team playoff, Davis bound
Forward Ellen Griep guards a Cal State-Hay ward player during a match earlier this season. The Cardinals
will be in action tomorrow in the league playoffs at Davis, facing the league's fourth place team at 11
a.m. and playing again either at 3 p.m. or 5 p.m. Stanford earned one point by finishing first and
undefeated in league play, and goes after the second point needed to sweep the title in the round robin
playoffs. The Card second team beat Katherine Branson School of Kentfield 1-0 last Friday.
After 11 hours of intense
tennis, Stanford completed the
second leg of its quest to be
come one of the top four
ranked teams in the nation by
defeating USC 5-3 yesterday.
The win gave the Cardinals an
8-1 Pac-10 record to tie them at

the top with top-ranked UCLA.
Those two teams will square off
here Saturday at 1 p.m. at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
At the outset of yesterday's
matches the Cards looked as if
they would run the Trojans out
of Palo Alto. Tim Mayotte, play
ing No. 3 jumped on SC's

Roger Knapp early. Mayotte
drilled three service return
winners in Knapp's first service
game for an early break. How
ever, that was only a preview of
things to come for Knapp.
Never really pressed, Mayotte
won the match, 6-2, 6-2 break
ing the hard-serving Knapp for
the match.
Scott Bondurant also made
things look easy with a 6-3, 6-1
victory over Doug Adler. He
also started fast, winning the
first two games of the match.
The second set was all Bondur
ant's. One game was all Adler
was to get, and Bondurant
closed out the match by break
ing Adler's serve for the third
time in the second set.
Displaying a vast array of
passing shots, )im Hodges won
the first set of his match, 6-4,
and it looked like the Cards
were off and running to an easy
victory. Such was not the case.
Using a wicked lefthanded
serve, Jack Kruger kept Hodges
guessing for the rest of the day
defeating Hodges 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Now given a glimmer of
hope, hard-hitting Sean Braw
ley promptly knotted the score
at 2-2, by edging Jeff Arons 7-5,
7-5. Bondurant and Hodges
then played one of their
poorest matches of the season
and all of a sudden the Cards
were down 3-2. Once again it
was the freshmen to the re
scue. Both Mayotte and Arons
and Kruger and Brawley held
serve to 5-5 and with the points
tied at 2-2, Arons hit a winning
forehand off a Kruger over
head, enabling the Cards to
pull off the break. Now playing
on pure emotion, Mayotte
bounced the overhead into the
stands on match point and the
match was dead even going
into Maples.
Coach Dick Gould called the
Maples matches the most excit
ing singles matches in the big
top since its inception in 1974.
Lloyd Bourne made a drama
tic comeback to put the Cards
ahead to stay with a 4-6,6-2,7-5
win over Billy Nealon. It looked
like a long night for the Cards
when Nealon broke Bourne in
his first service game to take a
2-0 lead, and pursued it to win
the first set 6-4.
Bourne, however, came
right back, breaking Nealon in
the first game of the second set
when Nealon netted an easy
forehand. Bourne totally
dominated the second set; at
one point Nealon was so frus
trated he abandoned his nor
mal backcourt game and
played serve and volley.
Bourne won that set easily 6-2.
That set up the third set, one
of the most exciting and
breathtaking in Maples history.
Nealon jumped to an early 4-1
lead, helped by the fact that
Bourne suffered a mental lapse

in the fourth game and missed
two easy volleys to lose his
serve. But with the crowd fully
behind him, Bourne kept his
poise and battled back. Bourne
finished off the match by
winning eight of the last 10
points. He described the finish
as "six of the best games of his
life."
The first singles match was
an awesome display of power
tennis. Hard-hitting Robert
Van't Hof of USC, the top
ranked collegian and Peter Re
nnert, the No. 10 ranked colle
gian, battled in a match of tieb
reakers with Rennert coming
out the victor 7-6,6-7, 7-6. Both
players served evenly, match
ing each other ace for ace to
6-6. With Van't Hof serving,
after a long backcourt rally,
Rennert pulled off an angled
backhand passing shot to win
himself the first set.
The second set neither
player was able to break. The
tiebreaker belonged com
pletely to Van't Hof, though.
After two service winners put
him up 2-0, Rennert tripped
and missed a volley to give
Van't Hof the 3-0 lead. An ex
cellent return of service and a
deep overhead closed out the
set.
Van't Hof looked like he
would start off the third set
with a break, but both players
then held service relatively eas
ily to 6-6 and in the final tieb
reaker, it was Rennert who
took control.
The victory by the crafty
junior gave the Cards an in
surmountable 5-3 lead. Be
cause of the lateness of the
hour, the first doubles match
was canceled.
The Cards, however, have
no time to celebrate, as they
will play host to the No. 1
ranked UCLA Bruins tomor
row. It is the final regular sea
son match for both teams and
both would like to go to the
NCAA tournament on a win
ning note. More importantly,
though, the Pac-10 title and the
NCAA team tournament seed
ings are on the line. The Bruins
(22-1) only lost one match this
year in a 5-4 defeat at the hands
of the young USC team. How
ever, last weekend at UCLA
Stadium, the Bruins reversed
the decision, blanking the Tro
jans 9-0.
Giant sophomore Fritz
Buehning (6-4, 192) keys the
UCLA attack. Similar to his
Stanford counterpart, Peter
Rennert, Buehning played No.
5 on last year's Bruin team.
Buehning's supporting cast
consists of Mike Harrington,
son of television actor Pat
Harrington, Dick Metz, Blaine
Willenborg, Marcel Freeman
and Bruce Berscia.
