Among the nine officials at last night's Stanford-USC dual
tennis match at Maples Pavilion, was senior Tom Ben
ninger, a mechanical engineering major.
Benninger's position during the opening match between
Stanford's Lloyd Bourne and USC's Billy Nealon (won by
Bourne 4-6, 6-2, 7-5) was backline right side.
Benninger is Lloyd Bourne's roommate.
When asked about any possible improprieties concern
ing this situation, women's tennis coach Anne Gould, who
hired Benninger smiled and said, "Oh yes, I know."
As an afterthought, she added, "He didn't make any
mistakes, did he?"
