# Expos beat Giants, 3-0

### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” When Montreal made
Kodney Scott their second baseman this spring,
it was mainly for defensive reasons. Yesterday,
the Expos got more than they bargained for.
Scott belted his first major league home run,
scored twice and knocked in a pair of runs to
back right-hander Steve Rogers' three-hitter in a
3-0 victory over the San Francisco Giants.
"It was a bonus," Scott said of the two-run
first-inning homer off Phil Nastu, 0-2. But Giants'
Manager Joe Altobelli had a different reaction.
"Nastu is coming along," he said, "but he hung
one to the smallest guy in the park."
Montreal Manager Dick Williams explained
how the 160-pound Scott beat out veteran Dave
Cash for the job.
"It's our job to put our best defensive club on
the field," he said. "Rodney had a great spring.
He gives more range and a stronger arm at sec
ond."
Andre Dawson reached first on an error bv

third baseman Darrell Evans before Scott hit his
homer after 292 games and 718 times at bat in the
majors.
Rogers, squaring his lifetime record against
the Giants at 6-6, was seldom in trouble en route
to his first shutout of the season. He retired the
first eight batters before Nastu walked with one
out in the third, then retired Bill North on a fly
for the third out.
After Clark bunted safely in the fourth, Willie
McCovey grounded into an inning-ending dou
ble play. Evans' double with one out in the fifth
was a blooper to left. Rogers then retired the
next 11 Giants before Venable beat out an infield
single as a pinch hitter in the ninth.
The Giants, who lost two of three games in the
series, wasted two strong pitching efforts. Ed
Halicki allowed only one run for six innings, yet
lost the opener, and the Expos scored only two
earned runs yesterday off Nastu and reliever
Tom Griffin.
