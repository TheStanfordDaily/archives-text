Senate panel votes to close N-plants
Washington — A Senate committee voted yesterday to
shut down in six months all nuclear power plants operat
ing in states without a government-approved
emergency evacuation plan.
Officials said the move could force the closing of 41
reactors in 16 states that lack Nuclear Regulatory
Commission-approved plans. There are 70 commercial
nuclear reactors now in use in the country.
At the same time, the Environment and Public Works
Committee voted to deny operating licenses to reactors
now under construction in states without the NRC
approved plans.
Committee aides said that as many as a dozen plants
nearing completion could be affected.
The panel agreed to the proposals, made by Sen. Gary
Hart, (D-Colo.), as it approved legislation authorizing
NRC programs for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
Hart's recommendations, passed 6-4, need approval
by both houses of Congress and must be signed into law
by President Carter before they can take effect.
The committee's vote provided fresh evidence of a
mood in Congress to strengthen the government's grip
on the commercial nuclear industry in the wake of the
March 28 accident at the Three Mile Island reactor in
Pennsylvania.
Carter urges SALT ratification
Washington — With Senate leaders of both parties non
committal about the new arms curb treaty with the
Soviet Union, President Carter yesterday argued that its
rejection would cause the United States to be "looked
upon as the warmonger."
Carter also told a White House breakfast for retailers
that if the Senate does not ratify the pact, this country
would suffer a serious loss of trust among NATO allies
and that efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons
would be undercut.
Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd told the Senate
he hopes action on the Salt II treaty can be completed
this year—a hope echoed by Sen. Frank Church, (D-
Idaho), chairman of the Foreign Relations committee.
Byrd, a West Virginian whose support could be crucial
to Carter's search for the 67 votes needed for ratifica
tion, emphasized he remains uncommitted.
Republican Leader Howard Baker ]r. of Tennessee,
who has suggested that significant changes may be
necessary to save the treaty, said he offered to keep
Carter informed of the GOP head counts as the debate
progresses.
Gas shortage imperils state tax cut
Sacramento — A continued gasoline shortage could cut
the state's budget surplus by $800 million in June 1980
and drive unemployment up to 9 percent, state Finance
Director Richard Silberman said yesterday.
The shortage could also cause Gov. Jerry Brown to
scrap his proposed $1.6 billion income tax cut, Silber
man told the Legislature's fiscal committees, which are
working on the 1979-80 state budget.
But the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,
Sen. Albert Rodda, (D-Sacramento), poured some cold
water on the idea of a tax cut even if gasoline supplies
return to normal.
A tax cut "reduces our revenues and compounds our
problems at a time when we're contemplating the possi
bility of a recession," Rodda told Silberman. "I think
that's inappropriate."

Silberman, Brown's top fiscal adviser, replied that a
one-time tax cut would cost the state less in the long run
than using the money for other programs, like schools,
state employee salaries and welfare.
He said Brown will decide on a tax cut in September
unless the money is already committed to other prog
rams.
California will finish the current fiscal year June 30
with a $2.7 billion surplus.
VEPCO plant security increases
Richmond, Va. — Substantial security changes have been
put into effect at Virginia Electric & Power Co.'s (VEPCO)
Surry nuclear plant following an incident of apparent
sabotage and a telephoned bomb threat, authorities said
yesterday.
Someone dumped sodium hydroxide, a caustic sub
stance used to clean water purifying equipment at the
plant, into 62 nonradioactive fuel elements in storage.
The contamination was discovered Monday.
Wednesday night, the bomb threat forced evacuation
of personnel at the plant, on the banks of the James River
about 55 miles southeast of here. No bomb was found,
plant officials said.
VEPCO officials were sketchy about the security
changes, saying only that authorized entry to the fuel
storage building had been cut from 125 to about 20
people.
Plant officials agree that whoever tried to damage the
fuel elements didn't act on impulse. It took planning and
lots of time.
William Ervin, assistant special agent-in-charge of the
Richmond FBI office, said the agency is conducting a
"high priority" investigation into what most officials say
was an "inside job."
Ugandan prisoner recounts ordeal
Kampala, Uganda — One of the last persons freed from
Idi Amin's dungeons said yesterday he existed three
months on two meals a week and little water in a room so
small that prisoners had to take turns lying down to
sleep.
The Rev. George Lukwiya, an Anglican priest from
Kampala, said that during one period 34 prisoners died
in a 10 by 12 foot room crammed with 60 persons and
that their decaying bodies were left inside for one week.
Lukwiya described conditions in the hated State Re
search Bureau, the former dictator's chief murder and
spy agency, in an interview. He said he was released on
April 5, less than a week before Tanzanian and anti-Amin
Ugandan soldiers captured Kampala and ended eight
years of rule by Amin.
There was no independent confirmation of his story.
According to Lukwiya, two armed and uniformed men
seized him in Kampala Jan. 11, where he was taken to the
research bureau, stripped to his underwear and put in a
top-floor cell. He said he still does not know why he was
arrested.
Lukwiya said he lost feeling in his legs during his
imprisonment and has not regained it, although he can
walk. He said he lost 50 pounds but that having an
original 200-pound bulk to draw from enabled him to
survive.
"People died all the time from starvation and thirst,"
he said. In the morning you would wake up to find
people dead.
"We piled them in a corner and tried to cover them
but the smell was horrible," Lukwiya added.
