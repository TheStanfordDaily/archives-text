# Panel debates press ethics

The lack of public confidence in the press—and the
Daily in particular—was the subject of a panel discussion
on the rights and responsibilities of community news
papers in Meyer Forum Room yesterday.
"Reporters are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice
of going to jail in order to protect the public's right to
know,"and yet the response of the public has been one
of increasing distrust, said moderator Lois Amsterdam, a
local attorney and former University ombudsman.
The panelists' description of their own and their
newspaper's policies and the often pointed questions
and comments from the audience of about 30 revealed a
sharp disagreement over whether the press is actually
meeting its own stated goal of fair and comprehensive
coverage.
The four panelists—Jay Thorwaldson, assistant edito
rial page editor and ombudsman of the Peninsula Times
Tribune, Diana Diamond, a professional journalism fel
low here and managing editor of the northern suburban
group of Lerner Newspapers of Chicago, Dan Fiduccia,
associate Daily editor and Adrienne Torf, Aurora collec
tive member—spent the first portion of the discussion
outlining the policies of their respective papers.
Thorwaldson, Diamond and Fiduccia all agreed on
their responsibility to provide fair and accurate report
ing and their desire to serve the entire community. They
also defended the right of everyone to freely express
themselves in a newspaper and lamented the lack of staff
that prevents them from doing a better job.
Torf, however, perceived Aurora's responsibilities
and goals differently. "Aurora is not designed to con
form to professional journalism style and rules. Obvi
ously Aurora doesn't represent the entire community. It
doesn't want to. We think no one can.
"We don't believe that truly objective journalism is
possible, rather that most media are merely the repeti
tion of the dominant perspective which excludes all
those people who are not white, male, well-to-do and

middle-of-the-road. We want to challenge this domi
nance by establishing feminist perspectives."
Thorwaldson asserted, however, that there is a "valu
able difference" between the advocacy press and the
conventional press. "If well done, the so-called objec
tive journalist can report all different perspectives.
"That's good journalism, not necessarily defending
the dominant position. The disadvantage with advocacy
journalism is that the reader can't always be convinced
that he's getting the entire story," Thorwaldson said.
Many audience members, however, charged that the
ability of the conventional press to provide fair coverage
with equal access to all is questionable because of the
many gray policy areas that allow arbitrary decisions on
what is fit to print.
The most frequently cited area was advertising. While
all the panelists agreed they wouldn't run a blatantly
racist advertisement, no consensus existed over what
standards should be applied or where lines should be
drawn when applying those standards.
"We have a running conversation in the (Times
Tribune) office as to what poor taste is," Thorwaldson
said.
The Daily's advertisement policy and coverage of
campus events in particular were singled out by the
audience for extensive criticism.
"The Daily has a bad habit of forgetting minority and
women's affairs," said one woman. "It's not just one
mistake, it's over and over and over."
"I don't think it's intentional or willful, but arises from
ignorance," said Torf.
Fiduccia replied that while the Daily tries fo cover the
entire University community, "we simply don't have
enough staff," and what staff there is is often inexperi
enced.
"It sounds like you have taken on too much then,"
responded a woman in the audience. "Ethically, you
have a responsibility to only cover what you can cover.
Don't promise to us what you can't deliver."
