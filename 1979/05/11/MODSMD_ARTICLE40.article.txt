# Miller laments voter apathy

### Steve Neff 
In a decade of increased political
confusion, it is impossible to distin
guish liberals from conservatives,
Dr. Warren Miller, president-elect of
the American Political Science As
sociation, said in a speech here
Wednesday.
"Massive, pervasive distrust in
government has led to increased
support of special interest groups
with less emphasis on the Democra
tic or Republican ticket as a whole,"
Miller said.
According to Miller, when faced
with the task of ideologically defin
ing a "conservative" or a "liberal," 75
percent of the electorate is at once
seized by mental apoplexy.
To further compound the prob
lems of partisan voters, they have
been frustrated trying to "label"
politicians as Republicans or Democ
rats.
Miller, director of the Center for
Political Studies at the University of
Michigan, claimed that the links be
tween delegates and voters have
been strained in recent years, caus

ing stubborn discontent in the elec
torate with the bipartisan system.
Warren attributed this discontent
to the "heterodox" ideals of political
delegates who unsanctimoniously
cross party lines at will.
Speaking on the nature of the
American party system, Warren said
that conservative Republicans and
liberal Democrats view the world in
"the fairly same vein." It is obviously
fruitless to apply labels to all political
figures, he said, because most
people do not live purely schematic
lives.
The efficacy of partisan machinery
as an informative aid in steering voter
behavior is minimal, said Warren.

Politcal rhetoric confronts the voter
in each senatorial, congressional and
presidential election, and often the
electorate cannot hope to address
the profusion of ideological and par
tisan issues.
Warren predicted an "upsurge in
concern for party reform" with con
tinued mass participation in crucial
national decisions.
Fervent ideological voting may
have lost the intensity of its previous
"I like Ike" days, Warren concedes,
and in the coming 1980 election it
may turn out that the party which
succeeds in creating the most am
biguity will secure the majority of the
votes.
