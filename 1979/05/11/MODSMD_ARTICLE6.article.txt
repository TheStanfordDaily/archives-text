# Senate calls for new senior vote
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
At a heavily attended meeting marked by frequent
emotional outbursts, the ASSU Senate certified the past
spring election results last night, excluding the senior
class results.
Following a 2 1 /i-hour debate on the validity of the
overseas votes cast in the run-off election for Senior
Class Presidents, the senate resolved to hold new elec
tions "as soon as possible" at Vienna, Tours, Cliveden,
Berlin and Hopkins Marine Station.
Later in the evening, Dayna Goldfine resigned her
position as Elections Commissioner and Sen. Tom Cart
resigned as a senator when he assumed membership on
the Council of Presidents upon senate confirmation.
The main discussion centered upon procedural im
proprieties committed by students running the election
at the Cliveden and Tours campuses.
Goldfine reported that she had outlined the correct
and constitutionally accepted voting format in a letter
mailed to all overseas campuses April 9. That notice
informed the overseas commissioners of the necessity
of a separate ballot for each voter and a set polling
location with a voter list to be signed by each voting
student. Only juniors were to receive a ballot for the
senior class officer election.
According to Goldfine, only 18 juniors voted in the
primary election at Cliveden. In the Cliveden run-off,
however, 44 of the 45 enrolled juniors voted, and the
36-8 edge they gave to Natural Choice slate thrust it into
the lead over the BASH slate at 267-257.
"The large turnout made me wonder," Goldfine said,
and so she proceeded to telephone the overseas cam
puses Wednesday night to investigate the possibility of
election violations.

Goldfine discovered that students at Berlin had cho
sen not to vote, that Florence voting had occurred as
stipulated and that the Vienna center had never received
ballots.
Julie Gavin, the Tours election commissioner, told
Goldfine that senior class elections there had been held
through mailboxes and not in accordance with
Goldfine's regulations.
After conversing with three Cliveden students,
Goldfine discerned that Greg Lucas, the coordinator of
the runoff election there, had circulated one divided
tally sheet to juniors at various spots throughout the
mansion. In addition, the students had had previous
access to April 27 Dailys, announcing the on-campus
vote totals, because the Cliveden spring break had de
layed the voting there.
Goldfine classified those actions as unfair and prejud
icial to individual voting considerations. She therefore
recommended to the senate that the Cliveden and Tours
votes be disqualified and advocated the approval of the
then-modified 244-224 BASH victory.
The lengthy turmoil that followed involved complaints
from members of both concerned slates, rebuttals by
the elections commission and confused meanderings by
senators in an attempt to resolve the issue and construct
an appropriate remedy.
In other action last night, the senate rejected a prop
osal to officially censure chairperson George Drysdale
for action taken in placing the election districting on the
spring quarter ballot as a constitutional amendment,
and it passed a bylaws amendment to allow for write-in
candidates in future elections.
A more complete report on senate activity will appear
in Monday's Daily.
