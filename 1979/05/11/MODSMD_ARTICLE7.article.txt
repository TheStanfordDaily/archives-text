# Lunde: White lacked mental state for murder
## 
### Janice Rhodes 
San Francisco — Dr. Donald Lunde, Stanford
psychiatry professor and lecturer at the Law School,
testified for the defense yesterday in the trial of Dan
White, who is charged with murder for the November 27
killings of former San Francisco Mayor George Moscone
and Supervisor Harvey Milk.
Lunde stressed that on the day of the killings White
did not have the mental capacity to commit murder of
either the first or the second degree.
Lunde also said, however, that White did have the
capacity to form the mental states necessary for man
slaughter. Lunde was the fifth psychiatric expert witness
to testify in the trial.
Lunde's 3'/z-hour testimony was followed by a short,
tearful testimony from White's wife, Mary Ann, after
which the defense rested its case. District Attorney
Thomas Norman indicated that the prosecution would
call at least one rebuttal witness today, the ninth day of
the trial.
The jury of five men and seven women will determine
which of a complex web of "mental states" White had
during the killings in order to decide whether to acquit
him or to convict him of one of a spectrum of crimes
varying in severity — manslaughter, second degree
murder, or first degree murder. If White is convicted of
first degree murder, the jury may make additional find
ings and impose the death penalty.
'Severe depression'
Like the other defense experts who diagnosed White,
Lunde concluded that White suffers from "severe de
pression" and that in the weeks preceeding the killings
White experienced an "extreme deterioration" in his

mental condition.
"He has the classic symptoms for depression and the
characteristics for compulsive personality," Lunde tes
tified.
He said that for several years White has exhibited both
the biological and the psychological symptoms as
sociated with the mental illness known as depression.
"This is not just some mild case of the blues," Lunde
said.
Compulsive personality
Lunde explained that a person who has a compulsive
personality is "rigid, overly conscientious and overly
uptight."
White's compulsive personality "of longstanding du
ration" makes him more prone to depression, Lunde
said.
"The American dream is a nightmare for somebody
like Dari White," Lunde said. "The more he achieved,
the worse he felt."
According to Lunde, White's periods of depression
became more frequent and more severe after his elec
tion as supervisor in November 1977 and became longer
and more intense last summer. By last fall, White was
"really very seriously ill," Lunde said. He said that White
thought about killing himself and that he had gone as far
as to purchase a bottle of sleeping pills.
Forensic psychiatry
Lunde is a widely known expert in forensic psychiatry,
the psychiatric field which deals with the consideration
of various "mental states" required by law in certain
crimes. He has testified for the court, the prosecution or
the defense in many other trials, including the Patty
Hearst trial, in which he was appointed by the court.

In considering the specifics of the legal tests yester
day, Lunde said that White's "mental condition was such
that he would not have been capable of premeditation
and deliberation," one of the mental states required by
law for first degree murder.
He also testified that White did not have "malice," a
term of legal jargon which refers to a set of different
mental capacities and which is necessary for a conviction
of murder of either first or second degree.
Lunde was cross-examined by Norman for2Vi hours.
Under cross-examination, Lunde said that White might
have had the capacity to have some of the less compli
cated mental states necessary for a second degree mur
der conviction. But Lunde maintained that, due to the
defendant's mental illness, White's thinking was not
focused on those issues that morning.
The smooth cross-examination occasionally rose to
theatric points with the round-faced Norman peering
over his glasses at Lunde and at the jury.
Lunde was questioned by Norman about the fact that
White had told Lunde that White was in the habit of
carrying a loaded gun and extra ammunition from time
to time. In the taped confession, White told the police
that he had not carried the gun for quite a while. Earlier
witnesses had testified that other supervisors, including
Dianne Feinstein, had also carried guns occasionally.
Lunde explained the contradiction with the tape by
suggesting that White had been emotionally distraught
at the time of confession and had simply not thought
about how frequently he had carried a gun, because
carrying a gun would not be for him a special kind of
experience which he would be certain to remember.
