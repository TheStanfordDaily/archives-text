# Gay comedienne encouraged by rights movement

### Alisa Terrell 
Pat Bond, a nationally known lesbian feminist com
edienne, told an audience of approximately 200 persons
in Kresge Auditorium Wednesday night that the gay
movement is the fastest growing human rights move
ment in history.
"More and more gays are coming out of the closet,"
Bond said. "Today we can say we're gay."
Bond applauded the defeat of California's Proposition
6 and told how she cried for joy when President Jimmy
Carter publicly advocated a "no" vote on the proposi
tion, which would have banned homosexuals from
teaching in public schools.
"We've come so far," Bond declared.
This encouraging appraisal of the gay situation in the
United States today is particularly significant, several
members of the Cay People's Union (CPU) said after the
speech, because Bond, at the age of 54, is a member of a
generation that has been very averse to homosexuality.
She and her gay contemporaries of the 1940s and the
1950s faced severe prejudice from the American public,
the CPU members said. Bond has personally witnessed
the gradual transition of the American attitude toward
homosexuality from outright hostility to tolerance.
After World War 11, she joined the Women's Army
Corps (WAC), which, in retrospect, Bond terms "mis
take number 9648.'' While on overseas assignment, she

was among 500 women who were suspected of being
lesbians. Their phones were tapped, and pictures were
taken of them together, she said. All 500 women were
dishonorably discharged and sent back to the United
States.
Bond's speech, which marked the midpoint of Cay
Awareness Week here, tempered the seriousness of her
subject with humor and drama.
The San Rafael actress entertained the audience with
anecdotes of her experiences as a lesbian and occasion
ally burst into song or quoted poetry to set the mood for
her reminiscences.
Cay Awareness Week at Stanford began Monday with
Gay Blue Jeans Day and will continue until Sunday, with
speakers and social activities every day.
According to Rhio Hiersch, a member of the steering
commitee of the CPU, the level of participation in this
week's activities has been "fair, but not good.
"Cay students at Stanford are still much too afraid to
be involved on campus, and straight people are still
much too disinterested," Hiersch said.
Hiersch noted that this week has been "invaluable in
that people are seeing and hearing about homosexual
ity.
"It is bringing fears to the surface about being gay,"
Hiersch said.
Hiersch emphasized the importance of "more partici
pation of straight people in gay activities."
