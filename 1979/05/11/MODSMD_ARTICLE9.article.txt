# This weekend in White Plaza
## The
						Bridge sponsors Spring Faire 
### Debbie Walker 
This Friday through Sunday,
White Plaza will be filled with
the good smells, good sights
and good sounds of the annual
Spring Faire.
Originated six years ago by
members of a local peer coun
seling organization, The
Bridge, the Faire is one of the
largest craft shows in the Bay
Area and attracts hundreds of
students and local residents.
Merchants will display vari
ous crafts and foods, and ac
cording to Susan Beil, one of
the Faire's coordinators, there
has been a concentrated effort
this year to provide a diverse
selection of crafts and a ba
lanced range of prices.
Six professional bands have
volunteered to provide con
tinuous musical entertainment
on Saturday and Sunday, while
numerous dancers, clowns
and jugglers display their ta
lents throughout the Faire.
Robert Hartman, a puppeteer
who performs regularly at Pier
39, will be featured as a special
guest.
Four months preparation
When the Spring Faire
materializes this weekend,
membersof The Bridgewill see
the culmination of four months
of work. Since February they
have been sending letters to
craftsmen, monitoring applica
tions and arranging entertain
ment.

Despite increasing tension
as the event draws closer,
people at The Bridge say they
are still enthusiastic. The
Spring Faire is their only
money-making venture each
year, and, aside from an annual
allotment from ASSU Program
Fees, it is The Bridge's only
source of funds.
"It's our work and our
labor," said Beil, a live-in staff
counselor at The Bridge. "It's
our life. If it rains this
weekend, we'll be passing the
hat around campus."
The Bridge receives money
by renting out stalls at the Faire
and, in addition, collects 20
percent of the merchants' pro
fits. Susan Larsen, another
Faire coordinator, explained
that merchants also benefit
from the Faire because the in
creased sales and notoriety
gained by the salesmen make
the event worth their while.
As for entertainment, the or
ganizers depend on perfor
mers who are willing to adopt
the pass-the-hat policy.
Drop-in center
Founded in the fall of 1971,
The Bridge was originally a
drop-in center for students
with drugproblems. Today The
Bridge's main concerns are fo
cused on its peer counseling
services.
People at The Bridge have
defined the organization as a
personal growth center, its
major goal being to explore

and clarify personal problems
and then to find a solution that
is right for the individual.
"Our aim is not to give ad
vice," said Peter Salovey, a
live-in staff counselor. "That
usually doesn't work because
that's like giving them your
opinion. We only want to get
them past their block."
Craig Goldman, also a live-in
staffer, said that everyone
should feel free to call for any
reason. "People who just want
to talk about school relation
ships and career goals call as
well as those who are going
through some sort of crisis,"
he said.
Most of the counselors at
The Bridge are students who
have taken the Learning Assis
tance Center course which
teaches peer counseling
through such methods as lis
tening skills training and role
playing. The counselors are
not trained psychologists, but
they can supply information
and referrals for those who re
quire more intensive help. The
Bridge coordinators em
phasized that all services are
free and all counseling ses
sions are confidential.
Workshops
Though counseling is the
primary function of The
Bridge, the organization has
branched out into other fields
and currently offers a variety of
workshops dealing with medi

tation, overeating and astrol
ogy. The Bridge is also the
headquarters for the newly
formed escort service.
Vince D Andrea, the organi
zation's faculty sponsor, said
he finds that the importance of
The Bridge lies not only in the
services it provides, but also in
the social relationships that
develop between the workers.
"The Bridge serves as a
means to experiences of being
a tight group and working on
real problems," D'Andrea said.
"It supplies alternatives to the
kinds of relationships that are
forced in many sdtial set
tings."
Larsen described the "strong
sense of closeness and
warmth" among The Bridge
counselors and said that this
type of support is necessary,
especially when certain coun
seling experiences are ex
tremely taxing.
Along with the solace it has
given many students and the
satisfaction it has offered its
organizers, The Bridge, ac
cording to D'Andrea, "is in that
exciting phase of being a
catalyst for other student
groups." Several spinoff peer
counseling groups have been
formed on campus that employ
The Bridge's approach to
counseling skills.
In the words of D'Andrea,
"peer counseling is here to
stay."
