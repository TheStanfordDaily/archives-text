A Scotsman was recounting his adventures to
a fellow Scot over a pint of beer
And you know Sean, there I was with my
thumb up on the highway, when after half an
hour, a sports car screeched to a halt and this
absolutely enchanting blonde girl poked her
-I head out and asked me if I wanted a ride
Well, we went on tor about a mile when sud
denly she swerved off into a side road, drove
about a hundred yards into a wood, stopped,
lumped out of the car, tore all her clothes off and
begged, Take what you want!'
"And so," mused Mike taking a swallow. I took
the car"
Sean looked at him and remarked, "Ay, you did
right lad. her clothes wouldn't have fitted you
nohow"
