## Mark Coggins CPPC neglects liberal arts majors 
### 
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting sick and
tired of hearing all those
liberal arts majors bad
mouth the Career Planning
and Placement Center
(CPPC). Everyone from the
Slavic language majors to
the philosophy majors to
the participants in the Prog
ram for the Study of Ad
vanced Home Economics is
complaining, and nothing is
being done about it.
It's time somebody de
fended the CPPC, and if no
one else in this University
has enough self-respect to
attempt it, then I guess I'm
the man for the job.
Okay, so just exactly what
have those bleeding-heart
liberals been saying about
the CPPC? Well, I wouldn't

want you to think I have any
intimate associations with
them or anything, but I un
derstand their argument
runs pretty much as follows.
First off, they claim that
not enough companies
which interview here offer
good jobs for liberal arts
majors. They say all the
good jobs are going to the
people with technical
majors. (Can you believe it?)
They further allege that
the typical interview a lib
eral arts major must go
through to get a job is about
three times as tough as the
interview faced by the typi
cal Bachelor of Science can
didate. (Try not to laugh out
loud.)
Counseling inadequate?!
Finally, they round off

their string of slanderous
remarksand outrageous lies
with an attack aimed at the
very heart of the Placement
Center: they claim the
counseling services pro
vided by the CPPC are woe
fully inadequate. (What gall
these people have!)
I know what you're think
ing, and I don't blame you.
Vou are absolutely right.
Those criticisms are totally
unfounded and are clearly
the product of the fuzzy
headed, non-empirical
"education" these liberals
have undergone since their
enrollment at Stanford.
They do require a re
sponse, however. They
need to be ripped apart and
held up to the light of day so
that all may see what crude
fabrications they really are.
Insurance jobs
Fact 1: There are plenty of
companies interviewing
with good jobs for liberal
arts majors at the CPPC (al
though why these people
actually deserve good jobs
is beyond me). Just for in
stance, take a look at the
jobs being offered by the
life insurance companies
and the big department
stores.
Those are nice jobs, but
do the liberal arts majors
sign up for the interviews?
Hell, no. They figure that
just because they know the
differences between the
Russian nihilists and the
Russian Slavophiles they
shouldn't have to sell shoes
or insurance policies for a
living.
On top of that, when they
do deign to sign up for an
interview, they all sign up
for the same one — Bank of
America. I don't know what
it is about the Bank of
America position that at
tracts them more than all
those other good jobs at the
CPPC, but they're willing to
spend the entire night out in
front of the Center just so
they can be first to sign up
the next day. How tacky can

you get?
Easier interviews
Fact 2: The interviews
faced by technical majors
are just as difficult as those
faced by liberal arts majors,
if not moie so. I've heard
the liberals complain when
they were asked to answer
such questions as "Attempt
to relate your major to any
thing relevant in the real
world," or "Describe your
self in a nutshell from eight
different perspectives," but
these questions aren't really
that hard to answer.
Imagine instead the ex
treme pressure a young en
gineer or computer scientist
must be under when he is
asked the following: "Do
you think a six-figure salary
would be all rignt to start
out with, sir?" or, "Can you
speak English? A nod of the
head will do," and finally
the very worst, "Do you
know that I plan to commit
suicide if you do not accept
this position?"
Best around
Fact 3: The job counseling
service at the CPPC is the
finest available in Greater
West Palo Alto. This fact is
the most self-evident of the
three and that is why I
placed it at the end of the
list.
When someone can go
into the CPPC and ask for a
list of companies employing
people in her field — as a
friend of mine did recently
— and receive the answer,
"Have you tried looking in
the phone book?" you
know you are dealing with
professionals of the very
highest order. Case closed.
I'd love to elucidate
further, but I've got a job
interview of my own I have
to rush off to. The
employer? Gary Andrews
on the corner of Campus
and Serra. Something about
a position in the distribution
department.
