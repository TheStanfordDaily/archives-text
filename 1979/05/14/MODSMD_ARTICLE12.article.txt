About this time in their young lives, old
Stanford seniors begin to consider the out
side world and their future. Some of them
worry, some of them laugh and act carefree,
and a few put these dangerous thoughts into
hibernation until they wake with a growl in
late spring.
Graduate school is an icy, uphill climb, and
the job situation is quite gloomy, rumor de
clares, so you'd better bite your nails and
prepare for premature ulcers.
I rebel against this state of affairs. Not be
cause I don't believe the odds are 8-1 against
acceptance to a specific law or medical
school.
Not because I don't believe thousands of
young adults want to work for Bank of
America though only a few lucky souls get
hired. These are basic truths just like the
earth is round and Kansas is flat.
Closed-mindedness
No, I rebel because Stanford students do
not open their ripe minds to all the options
out in the real world. Consider these pos
sibilities.
Become a policeman (policeperson). I am
serious. Sure it's blue collar, or at least light
blue, but it's an important job. I would have
been shot by my peers forsaying this 10years
ago, but policemen help people with daily
problems, catch or deter criminals and pro
tect and organize their communities more
than we care to admit.
Of course, they have faults, such as over
reacting sometimes and sometimes sticking
more to the letter than to the spirit of the law,
but for every policeman whom you dislike,
I'm sure you meet several whom you like or
respect.
Advantages
Now think of the benefits of becoming a
policeman. Vou constantly meet new people,
some of them criminal, some of them merely
little kids lost by absent-minded parents,
some of them businessmen driving hometoo
fast from their job at the Bank of America
building.
Sometimes you wouldn't enjoy at all the
people you meet. The point is, your work
would often be interesting and unusual,
though low-paying.
What's more, after four years of thinking,
writing about books and eating problem sets
at Stanford, in abstract terms for the most
part and mostly for yourself, wouldn't it feel
great to do something concrete and to see
your actions directly benefit one or many
persons?
Even if you make mistakes or find, as you
obviously would, that many parts of the job
are frustrating, you would still feel the satisfy

ing sensation of being active, of doing.
Streets of San Francisco
Learn how to drive the cable cars. Appa
rently you need to serve an apprenticeship
on buses for a while, but that seems to be but
a minor obstacle. The job involves caution
and responsibility, yet it's not too difficult.
And if you've ever seen some of the un
friendly, even nasty men who work the grip
and collect the money, you'll realize how
popular an intelligent, talkative, ex-Stanford
person would be with natives and tourists
alike.
What better city to live and work in than
San Francisco, and what more central job is
there than on the cable cars? You might be
come bored after a while, but you could al
ways move on to new employment after a few
years.
Or the media
Move on, maybe, to creating something of
your own, like a new magazine or a television
program. Carrying out this idea would surely
be more difficult and more chancy than be
coming a policeman or cable car driver, but it
pays more.
Sure, competition seems stiff, yet a good
number of successful magazines and televi
sion shows were begun by people who were
simply lucky and not any more creative or
intelligent than many students here.
Collect a group of really bright, imaginative
friends and acquaintances, try to find a
backer with a good reputation and good
money and start planning. This post
graduation option would take concentration,
hard work, much time, possibly some finan
cial losses at first and maybe even failure. If
you feel, though, that you are as creative and
as smart as the people who invented People
magazine or television offerings such as The
Incredible Hulk and Fantasy Island, you
should try your own hand.
These are just a few suggestions, just to
stimulate other ideas. Maybe you want to
work at a different job every three years.
Maybe you simply desire to become a doctor,
lawyer, businessman or engineer. That's
fine.
Philosopher John Stuart Mill said "if we
educate men to become capable and sensi
ble men, then they will become capable and
sensible doctors and lawyers."
Stanford tries to educate us capably and
sensibly, and we should bring these qualities
and ourselves to highly respected profes
sions such as law and medicine. We should
also bring ourselves and our strengths to the
hundreds of other opportunities and jobs
waiting for us out in the world.
