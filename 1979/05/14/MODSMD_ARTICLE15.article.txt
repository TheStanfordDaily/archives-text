## 
### Kathleen O'Hanlon 
What happens when the
feeling of exhilaration that is
supposed to accompany spring
does not arrive? Do you no
longer look forward to a brisk
five-mile run?
Health Awareness Week,
which will be held here tomor
row through Thursday, could
increase your interest in your
body and yourself.
The theme of the week will
be "Up With Life," according
to Jack Martin, president of the
Stanford Health and Fitness
Association. He said the focus
will be on bringing about grea
ter understanding of good
health and the physical fitness
and practices that accompany
it.
The SHFA, which organized
the week, has planned a variety
of programs and activities
geared toward encouraging
good health practices and fit
ness in the University com
munity. Martin said the goal of
the program is to offer some
thing of interest to faculty and
staff members as well as to stu
dents.
A Health and Fitness Faire
will be held in White Plaza to
morrow and Wednesday and is
the major activity planned for
the week. John Macauly, direc
tor of the faire, estimates that
there will be more than 75
booths and displays.
The National Cancer Society,
the Red Cross and the Lawr
ence Hall of Science will be

among the groups represented
and will provide information
on prevention and detection of
various diseases. The displays
include footsie rollers, devices
for massaging feet and de
monstrations of body massage.
Entertainment will be pro
vided by student groups. The
Band will appear with the new
Dollies, and musicians and en
tertainers will be performing
throughout the two-day event.
The Stanford Hot Air Balloon
Club is also expected to give a
demonstration in White Plaza.
Joggers and non-joggers
alike will participate in a
"penny-a-mile" run at Angell
Field Thursday. The run will be
preceded by a clinic on stretch
ingand runningtechniquesled
by Stanford cross country
coaches Dean Clark and Laurel
Treon. World class marathoner
Ron Wayne will be present, as
will a number of campus nota
bles, such as Admissions Di
rector Fred Hargadon. Par
ticipants will receive three
pennies upon completing the
three-mile run.
A "no tests" program is also
planned for Thursday. Faculty
members were sent letters ask
ing them not to schedule tests
for the day, and to devote
some class time to discussing
the effect of the examination
process on student health.
During the week there will
be an emphasis on personal
habits that can improve health
and fitness. Cigarette smokers

will be encouraged to give up
smoking for one day as part of
the "Smoke Out" program.
James Norton, coordinator of
this program, stated that giving
up cigarette smoking could
add five years to the life of a
pack-a-day smoker.
other programs
on "Nutritional
Awareness" and a "Walk,
Don't Ride" campaign. People
are asked to try to limit their
intake of saturated fats, which
are derived from animal
sources, to 10 percent of their
total intake of calories, the
level recommended by the
Select Senate Committee on
Nutrition and Human Needs.
The "Walk, Don't Ride"
program is similar in that it en
courages people to think about
controlling their weight
through increased physical ac
tivity. Walking rather than rid
ing bikes and riding bikes
rather than driving are
suggested. Dr. John Farquhar,
director of the Stanford Heart
Disease Prevention Program,
said that the average American
gains one pound of fat every
year between the ages of 20
and 50. The expenditure of
only 10 extra calories per day
would counteract this weight
gain.
The final activity of the week
will be an open house at de-
Guerre Pool Thursday night.
There will be water games and
live music.
