# Who's best? Courts hand down split decision
## Men beat UCLA for Pac-10 title; Bruin women edge Cards 
### Jeff Brandon Steve Pearson 
Stanford retained its
Pacific-10 Conference tennis
title Saturday with an impres
sive 7-2 upset win over top
ranked UCLA. The win gave the
Cardinals a 9-1 Pac-10 mark
while the Bruins dropped to
8-2.
Once again it was the Card
freshmen who sparked the at
tack. Scott Bondurant lost his
first game to UCLA's Dick Metz
before running off five straight
on his way to a 6-2 victory.
The big-hitting Metz just did
not have the passing shots to
counter Bondurant's"chipand
charge" strategy, losing the
second set by an identical 6-2
score.
Bondurant, despite playing
the entire match with a bor
rowed racquet from teammate
Andy Chase after having his
stolen Friday night, jumped to
a 5-0 lead in that second set
before finishing up the victory.
In the most exciting match of
the day, emotional Jeff Arons
defeated Marcel Freeman 6-2,
7-5. A combination of erratic
play by Freeman and a tenaci
ous net game by Arons led to
the victory by the Portola Val
ley native.
Arons cited the crowd as a
big factor in his success.
"The crowd really had rnt
pumped up," said the happy
winner. "I kept attacking
throughout the match. That's
the only way to beat Marcel."
Arons played perhaps his
finest match of the season. He
broke Freeman in the opening
game and twice more in the
first set in winning 6-2.
Breaks were not so easy to
come by in the second set.
Both players held serve to
five-ail, but then Arons
capitalized on two Freeman er
rors for the decisive break. At
6-5 the game score went to
three-all, but Freeman missed
a backhead passing shot and
Arons had the match.
Teammate Tim Mayotte,
warming up on the next court,
was so overcome with Arons'
victory that he ran over and
picked him up following the
match point.
Mayotte then proceeded to
defeat Blaine Willenborg 6-4,
6-2, coming from behind after
being down 2-4 in the opening
set.
"I know exactly what I had to
do to beat Willenborg,"
Mayotte said. "I know I had to
get to the net behind my return
of serve. I also served real well;
that didn't hurt. I didn't even
think of being behind."
Willenborg's junkball
strategy had little effect on
Mayotte, who refused to stay in
the backcourt and rally with
him.
After a shaky start this year,
Mayotte has rallied to win eight
singles matches in a row.
"I'm practicing a lot more
and it's starting to pay off," the
Massachusetts native said.
"Jeff Arons has also helped me
with my serve and it's really im
proved."
The lone singles loss for the
Cards came when 17-year-old
freshman Bruce Brescia de
feated |im Hodges 7-6, 6-4.
Hodges had six break points
in Brescia's first three service
games but could only break
once. That break held to 5-4,
and Hodges was serving at tri
ple set point.
Brescia saved the first one
with a let cord shot. On the
second set point, the grip of
Hodges' racquet pulled off,
and the point was lost. At
three-all, new racquet in hand,
Hodges missed a volley and
Brescia went on to win the set
in a 5-1 tiebreaker.
With the momentum now
turned his way, Brescia pulled

out a 6-4 second set to win the
match.
Bruin Mike Harrington then
teamed up with Freeman to
drop Hodges and Bondurant in
the number two doubles
match 6-3, 7-5, and the match
score stood at 3-2 Stanford.
Knowing they could put the
Bruins back to the wall with a
victory, Mayotte and Arons,
undefeated in dual match play,
remained that way with a 6-3,
6-3 drubbing of Metz and Bres
cia.
"Jeff and I really blend well
together," Mayotte said. "The
crowd really helped us, too."
UCLA coach Glenn Bassett
echoed Mayotte's sentiments.
"When a young team like
Stanford plays in front of a par
tisan crowd like today's, it can
make a big difference," the
UCLA mentor said.
Lloyd Bourne put the final
nail in the UCLA coffin when
the match shifted to Maples
Pavilion Saturday night, regis
tering a 6-3, 6-4 win over Har
rington. In their previous
match Bourne managed to win
just four games
"The trip to Los Angeles last
month was the worst road trip
I've had since I've been at Stan
ford," Bourne said. "The re
venge factor was definitely in
my mind."
Bourne won the toss and
elected to receive, looking for
an early break.
"The crowd takes a little get
ting used to," he pointed out.
"I was hoping he would be a
little nervous and I could get
out in front."
Bourne's strategy paid off as
Harrington double-faulted
twice in the first game, allow
ing Bourne to take the early
lead. Harrington broke back to
tie the set at two, but was sub
sequently broken two more
times in the first set.
Attacking more than he
normally does, Bourne hit a
backhand volley at Har
rington's feet to clinch the
match and the Pac-10 title for
the Cards.
"It was a little intimidating
playing here," Harrington said.
"The court here is much faster
than ours at UCLA. Lloyd also
got in a good percentage of
first serves. He didn't do that
(the) last time we played."
With the match won, the
number one singles match was
somewhat anticlimactic. Free
swinging Fritz Buehning, who
said he was "not as keyed as I
would have been had the
match been on the line," lost
to Stanford's Peter Rennert 6-4,
3-6, 2-6.
Buehning used his power
game to win the first set, but
Rennert, who admitted being a
little flat at the outset, came
back to avenge an earlier de
feat to the rangy Bruin, break
ing Buehning three times in the
final set.
"I always go out planning to
play a three-set match," said
Stanford's top player. "If I
thought any other way I
wouldn't be mentally prepared
if the match did go three sets."
The number one doubles
match went down to the final
point, Rennert and Bourne
teaming up to beat the
hyperactive team of Buehning
and Willenborg, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6
(5-4).
The Card duo won the first
set and were up a break in the
second before a succession of
good lobs by the David and
Goliath team (Buehning is nine
inches taller than Willenborg)
forced Rennert to miss an
overhead on a three-all point
for the break.
With the score in games at
three-all, both teams held ser
vice throughout to force a tieb
reaker. UCLA took it 5-3, win

ning all four Stanford serves.
In the final set, the Cards
were the ones who had to
make up a break deficit to force
a tiebreaker. With the tieb
reaker knotted up at four-all,
Rennert drilled forehands from
the backcourt at the Bruin pair,
finally forcing Willenborg to
net a backhand volley and give
the Cards their 10th straight
win in Maples, dating back to
last season.
The win should give tht
Cards confidence going into
the NCAAs next week that they
are definitely a good bet to take
it all. Stanford decisively de
feated the top-ranked team,
something nobody else has
been able to accomplish (USC
dealt the Bruins their only
other loss, 5-4). The NCAA
team championship begins
next Monday at Athens, Geor
gia, with the individual tour
nament beginning on the fol
lowing Friday.

If last Friday's match bet
ween the Stanford and UCLA
women's tennis teams had
been separated between the
afternoon outdoor matches
and the featured indoor con
tests in Maples, the final score
would have been 1-1. As it was,
however, the Bruins staked
themselves to an insurmount
able 5-1 lead early in the day,
and even three straight indoor
victories could not save the
Cardinals from a 5-4 loss.
The defeat in their last regu
lar season dual match left the
Cardinals with a 9-4 record on
the year. All four of Stanford's
losses came at the hands of its
southern California rivals, USC
and UCLA. Friday's loss was the
Cardinals' second straight
one-point loss to UCLA this
year, and was especially dis
couraging to women's coach
Anne Gould.
"UCLA played very well,"
she said. UCLA did not, how
ever, have to face a Cardinal
team that included All -
American Diane Morrison,
who left the team several
weeks ago to turn pro.
"I think that our loss of
Diane really hurt us, especially
in the doubles," Gould said.
"The girls who played in the
second and third doubles had
never really played together in
competition before. They
played well, but their inexperi
ence prevented them from
playing as well as they could
have, and in the end UCLA's
depth and experience paid
off."
In the afternoon singles
matches at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, UCLA jumped out to
a quick 3-1 lead. Ail-American
Susie Hagey of Stanford pro
vided the only Cardinal victory
with a well-played 6-0, 6-4 win
over UCLA's Ann Henricksson.
Hagey was playing in her
final home-court appearance
before she graduates and turns
pro in June. The graceful
senior's powerful serve and
forehand were at their best as
! she overwhelmed her Bruin
opponent in the number three
singles contest.
In the number four and five
singles matches, Stanford's
Donna Rubin and Sue Rasmus
sen were defeated 6-3, 6-3 and
6-3, 6-4 in matches which were
closer than their scores would
indicate. In the final afternoon
singles match, Cardinal Caryn
Hertel, after running away with
the first set, suffered a fatal
mental letdown that cost her
the match at 1-6,6-2,6-0 to UC
LA's Shannon Gordon.
With UCLA leading 3-1, the
No. 2 and 3 doubles matches
began. Hagey, minus her
long-time partner Morrison,
teamed up with Rubin to face
Bruins Lucy Gordon and
number one singles player
Dana Gilbert. Hagey and Rubin
played well, but they lost some
key points to their hard-hitting
opponents and lost 7-5, 6-4.
Two courts down, Cards
Rasmussen and Hertel were
facing UCLA's Becky Bell and
Kathy O'Brien. Bell and O'B
rien continually lobbed suc
cessfully over the Stanford
pair, winning their doubles
match with an identical 7-5, 6-4
scoreandclinchinga UCLAvic-

Tory at 5-1.
The evening's featured
matches in Maples were un
derstandably subdued and
anti-climactic. Leading off was
the number two singles match
between Stanford's Alycia
Moulton and UCLA's O'Brien.
Moulton came into the match
undefeated on the year, and
that's the way she came out,
winning 6-3, 7-5. Moulton'sbig
serve and powerful
groundstrokes carried her past
her Bruin opponent, who
forced Moulton to save several
crucial break points in the sec
ond set.
The number one singles
match between Stanford's
Kathy Jordan and UCLA's Dana
Gilbert featured two of the top
collegiate women players in
the nation. Jordan, who will
turn pro next month, took con
trol of the match by serving
well and rushing the net. Gil
bert responded with strong
groundstrokes, but was never
really in the match as Jordan
won 6-4, 6-2.
In the final indoor match,
Jordan and Moulton won the
number one doubles contest
6-1, 7-5 over the previously un
defeated UCLA team of Hen
ricksson and Shannon Gor
don. Jordan and Moulton
ended the year 5-0 as a doubles
team, and should be one of the
favorites in the national indi
vidual championships.
After winning two matches
that were too late to help her
team, Jordan said, "It's a real
letdown to have to play those
matches after already having
lost the team match. But you
have to go out and do it. It's
important for your individual
ranking, and there's still a lot of
personal pride involved."
The Cards' 0-4 performance
against USC and UCLA will
have an important effect upon
their national standing. Previ
ously considered the number
two team in the country behind
USC, the Cards now figure to
be at least a notch lower.
Gould explained, "There is
no real ranking authority in
women's college tennis. But
when it comes down to the
team championships in June,
we'll now be seeded third at
the very best, whereas if we
had beaten UCLA we would
probably have been number
two."
The Cardinal team has al
ready been chosen as one of
the six representatives from
California, Hawaii and Nevada
to go to the national team
championships in lowa June 8
to 12. The next big competition
for the Cards, however, is May
17 to 20 at Cal Poly-Pomona
where individual team mem
bers will compete to qualify for
the national individual champ
ionships. Stanford hopes to
qualify several players in both
singles and doubles, and led by
Jordan and Moulton, they
should do well.

TIM MAYOTTE AND KATHY JORDAN were two stars who shined on the court this weekend against
UCLA. Mayotte won 16 straight points on his way to defeating Blaine Willenborg 6-4, 6-2. Jordan
routined her number one counterpart at UCLA, Dana Gilbert, 6-4, 6-2.
Stanford retained its
Pacific-10 Conference tennis
title Saturday with an impres
sive 7-2 upset win over top
ranked UCLA. The win gave the
Cardinals a 9-1 Pac-10 mark
while the Bruins dropped to
8-2.

17 to 20 at Cal Poly-Pomona
where individual team mem
bers will compete to qualify for
the national individual champ
ionships. Stanford hopes to
qualify several players in both
singles and doubles, and led by
Jordan and Moulton, they
should do well.

TIM MAYOTTE AND KATHY JORDAN were two stars who shined on the court this weekend against
UCLA. Mayotte won 16 straight points on his way to defeating Blaine Willenborg 6-4, 6-2. Jordan
routined her number one counterpart at UCLA, Dana Gilbert, 6-4, 6-2.
Stanford retained its
Pacific-10 Conference tennis
title Saturday with an impres
sive 7-2 upset win over top
ranked UCLA. The win gave the
Cardinals a 9-1 Pac-10 mark
while the Bruins dropped to
8-2.
Once again it was the Card
freshmen who sparked the at
tack. Scott Bondurant lost his
first game to UCLA's Dick Metz
before running off five straight
on his way to a 6-2 victory.
The big-hitting Metz just did
not have the passing shots to
counter Bondurant's"chipand
charge" strategy, losing the
second set by an identical 6-2
score.
Bondurant, despite playing
the entire match with a bor
rowed racquet from teammate
Andy Chase after having his
stolen Friday night, jumped to
a 5-0 lead in that second set
before finishing up the victory.
In the most exciting match of
the day, emotional Jeff Arons
defeated Marcel Freeman 6-2,
7-5. A combination of erratic
play by Freeman and a tenaci
ous net game by Arons led to
the victory by the Portola Val
ley native.
Arons cited the crowd as a
big factor in his success.
"The crowd really had rnt
pumped up," said the happy
winner. "I kept attacking
throughout the match. That's
the only way to beat Marcel."
Arons played perhaps his
finest match of the season. He
broke Freeman in the opening
game and twice more in the
first set in winning 6-2.
Breaks were not so easy to
come by in the second set.
Both players held serve to
five-ail, but then Arons
capitalized on two Freeman er
rors for the decisive break. At
6-5 the game score went to
three-all, but Freeman missed
a backhead passing shot and
Arons had the match.
Teammate Tim Mayotte,
warming up on the next court,
was so overcome with Arons'
victory that he ran over and
picked him up following the
match point.
Mayotte then proceeded to
defeat Blaine Willenborg 6-4,
6-2, coming from behind after
being down 2-4 in the opening
set.
"I know exactly what I had to
do to beat Willenborg,"
Mayotte said. "I know I had to
get to the net behind my return
of serve. I also served real well;
that didn't hurt. I didn't even
think of being behind."
Willenborg's junkball
strategy had little effect on
Mayotte, who refused to stay in
the backcourt and rally with
him.
After a shaky start this year,
Mayotte has rallied to win eight
singles matches in a row.
"I'm practicing a lot more
and it's starting to pay off," the
Massachusetts native said.
"Jeff Arons has also helped me
with my serve and it's really im
proved."
The lone singles loss for the
Cards came when 17-year-old
freshman Bruce Brescia de
feated |im Hodges 7-6, 6-4.
Hodges had six break points
in Brescia's first three service
games but could only break
once. That break held to 5-4,
and Hodges was serving at tri
ple set point.
Brescia saved the first one
with a let cord shot. On the
second set point, the grip of
Hodges' racquet pulled off,
and the point was lost. At
three-all, new racquet in hand,
Hodges missed a volley and
Brescia went on to win the set
in a 5-1 tiebreaker.
With the momentum now
turned his way, Brescia pulled

out a 6-4 second set to win the
match.
Bruin Mike Harrington then
teamed up with Freeman to
drop Hodges and Bondurant in
the number two doubles
match 6-3, 7-5, and the match
score stood at 3-2 Stanford.
Knowing they could put the
Bruins back to the wall with a
victory, Mayotte and Arons,
undefeated in dual match play,
remained that way with a 6-3,
6-3 drubbing of Metz and Bres
cia.
"Jeff and I really blend well
together," Mayotte said. "The
crowd really helped us, too."
UCLA coach Glenn Bassett
echoed Mayotte's sentiments.
"When a young team like
Stanford plays in front of a par
tisan crowd like today's, it can
make a big difference," the
UCLA mentor said.
Lloyd Bourne put the final
nail in the UCLA coffin when
the match shifted to Maples
Pavilion Saturday night, regis
tering a 6-3, 6-4 win over Har
rington. In their previous
match Bourne managed to win
just four games
"The trip to Los Angeles last
month was the worst road trip
I've had since I've been at Stan
ford," Bourne said. "The re
venge factor was definitely in
my mind."
Bourne won the toss and
elected to receive, looking for
an early break.
"The crowd takes a little get
ting used to," he pointed out.
"I was hoping he would be a
little nervous and I could get
out in front."
Bourne's strategy paid off as
Harrington double-faulted
twice in the first game, allow
ing Bourne to take the early
lead. Harrington broke back to
tie the set at two, but was sub
sequently broken two more
times in the first set.
Attacking more than he
normally does, Bourne hit a
backhand volley at Har
rington's feet to clinch the
match and the Pac-10 title for
the Cards.
"It was a little intimidating
playing here," Harrington said.
"The court here is much faster
than ours at UCLA. Lloyd also
got in a good percentage of
first serves. He didn't do that
(the) last time we played."
With the match won, the
number one singles match was
somewhat anticlimactic. Free
swinging Fritz Buehning, who
said he was "not as keyed as I
would have been had the
match been on the line," lost
to Stanford's Peter Rennert 6-4,
3-6, 2-6.
Buehning used his power
game to win the first set, but
Rennert, who admitted being a
little flat at the outset, came
back to avenge an earlier de
feat to the rangy Bruin, break
ing Buehning three times in the
final set.
"I always go out planning to
play a three-set match," said
Stanford's top player. "If I
thought any other way I
wouldn't be mentally prepared
if the match did go three sets."
The number one doubles
match went down to the final
point, Rennert and Bourne
teaming up to beat the
hyperactive team of Buehning
and Willenborg, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6
(5-4).
The Card duo won the first
set and were up a break in the
second before a succession of
good lobs by the David and
Goliath team (Buehning is nine
inches taller than Willenborg)
forced Rennert to miss an
overhead on a three-all point
for the break.
With the score in games at
three-all, both teams held ser
vice throughout to force a tieb
reaker. UCLA took it 5-3, win

ning all four Stanford serves.
In the final set, the Cards
were the ones who had to
make up a break deficit to force
a tiebreaker. With the tieb
reaker knotted up at four-all,
Rennert drilled forehands from
the backcourt at the Bruin pair,
finally forcing Willenborg to
net a backhand volley and give
the Cards their 10th straight
win in Maples, dating back to
last season.
The win should give tht
Cards confidence going into
the NCAAs next week that they
are definitely a good bet to take
it all. Stanford decisively de
feated the top-ranked team,
something nobody else has
been able to accomplish (USC
dealt the Bruins their only
other loss, 5-4). The NCAA
team championship begins
next Monday at Athens, Geor
gia, with the individual tour
nament beginning on the fol
lowing Friday.

If last Friday's match bet
ween the Stanford and UCLA
women's tennis teams had
been separated between the
afternoon outdoor matches
and the featured indoor con
tests in Maples, the final score
would have been 1-1. As it was,
however, the Bruins staked
themselves to an insurmount
able 5-1 lead early in the day,
and even three straight indoor
victories could not save the
Cardinals from a 5-4 loss.
The defeat in their last regu
lar season dual match left the
Cardinals with a 9-4 record on
the year. All four of Stanford's
losses came at the hands of its
southern California rivals, USC
and UCLA. Friday's loss was the
Cardinals' second straight
one-point loss to UCLA this
year, and was especially dis
couraging to women's coach
Anne Gould.
"UCLA played very well,"
she said. UCLA did not, how
ever, have to face a Cardinal
team that included All -
American Diane Morrison,
who left the team several
weeks ago to turn pro.
"I think that our loss of
Diane really hurt us, especially
in the doubles," Gould said.
"The girls who played in the
second and third doubles had
never really played together in
competition before. They
played well, but their inexperi
ence prevented them from
playing as well as they could
have, and in the end UCLA's
depth and experience paid
off."
In the afternoon singles
matches at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, UCLA jumped out to
a quick 3-1 lead. Ail-American
Susie Hagey of Stanford pro
vided the only Cardinal victory
with a well-played 6-0, 6-4 win
over UCLA's Ann Henricksson.
Hagey was playing in her
final home-court appearance
before she graduates and turns
pro in June. The graceful
senior's powerful serve and
forehand were at their best as
! she overwhelmed her Bruin
opponent in the number three
singles contest.
In the number four and five
singles matches, Stanford's
Donna Rubin and Sue Rasmus
sen were defeated 6-3, 6-3 and
6-3, 6-4 in matches which were
closer than their scores would
indicate. In the final afternoon
singles match, Cardinal Caryn
Hertel, after running away with
the first set, suffered a fatal
mental letdown that cost her
the match at 1-6,6-2,6-0 to UC
LA's Shannon Gordon.
With UCLA leading 3-1, the
No. 2 and 3 doubles matches
began. Hagey, minus her
long-time partner Morrison,
teamed up with Rubin to face
Bruins Lucy Gordon and
number one singles player
Dana Gilbert. Hagey and Rubin
played well, but they lost some
key points to their hard-hitting
opponents and lost 7-5, 6-4.
Two courts down, Cards
Rasmussen and Hertel were
facing UCLA's Becky Bell and
Kathy O'Brien. Bell and O'B
rien continually lobbed suc
cessfully over the Stanford
pair, winning their doubles
match with an identical 7-5, 6-4
scoreandclinchinga UCLAvic-

Tory at 5-1.
The evening's featured
matches in Maples were un
derstandably subdued and
anti-climactic. Leading off was
the number two singles match
between Stanford's Alycia
Moulton and UCLA's O'Brien.
Moulton came into the match
undefeated on the year, and
that's the way she came out,
winning 6-3, 7-5. Moulton'sbig
serve and powerful
groundstrokes carried her past
her Bruin opponent, who
forced Moulton to save several
crucial break points in the sec
ond set.
The number one singles
match between Stanford's
Kathy Jordan and UCLA's Dana
Gilbert featured two of the top
collegiate women players in
the nation. Jordan, who will
turn pro next month, took con
trol of the match by serving
well and rushing the net. Gil
bert responded with strong
groundstrokes, but was never
really in the match as Jordan
won 6-4, 6-2.
In the final indoor match,
Jordan and Moulton won the
number one doubles contest
6-1, 7-5 over the previously un
defeated UCLA team of Hen
ricksson and Shannon Gor
don. Jordan and Moulton
ended the year 5-0 as a doubles
team, and should be one of the
favorites in the national indi
vidual championships.
After winning two matches
that were too late to help her
team, Jordan said, "It's a real
letdown to have to play those
matches after already having
lost the team match. But you
have to go out and do it. It's
important for your individual
ranking, and there's still a lot of
personal pride involved."
The Cards' 0-4 performance
against USC and UCLA will
have an important effect upon
their national standing. Previ
ously considered the number
two team in the country behind
USC, the Cards now figure to
be at least a notch lower.
Gould explained, "There is
no real ranking authority in
women's college tennis. But
when it comes down to the
team championships in June,
we'll now be seeded third at
the very best, whereas if we
had beaten UCLA we would
probably have been number
two."
The Cardinal team has al
ready been chosen as one of
the six representatives from
California, Hawaii and Nevada
to go to the national team
championships in lowa June 8
to 12. The next big competition
for the Cards, however, is May
17 to 20 at Cal Poly-Pomona
where individual team mem
bers will compete to qualify for
the national individual champ
ionships. Stanford hopes to
qualify several players in both
singles and doubles, and led by
Jordan and Moulton, they
should do well.

6-1, 7-5 over the previously un
defeated UCLA team of Hen
ricksson and Shannon Gor
don. Jordan and Moulton
ended the year 5-0 as a doubles
team, and should be one of the
favorites in the national indi
vidual championships.
After winning two matches
that were too late to help her
team, Jordan said, "It's a real
letdown to have to play those
matches after already having
lost the team match. But you
have to go out and do it. It's
important for your individual
ranking, and there's still a lot of
personal pride involved."
The Cards' 0-4 performance
against USC and UCLA will
have an important effect upon
their national standing. Previ
ously considered the number
two team in the country behind
USC, the Cards now figure to
be at least a notch lower.
Gould explained, "There is
no real ranking authority in
women's college tennis. But
when it comes down to the
team championships in June,
we'll now be seeded third at
the very best, whereas if we
had beaten UCLA we would
probably have been number
two."
The Cardinal team has al
ready been chosen as one of
the six representatives from
California, Hawaii and Nevada
to go to the national team
championships in lowa June 8
to 12. The next big competition
for the Cards, however, is May
17 to 20 at Cal Poly-Pomona
where individual team mem
bers will compete to qualify for
the national individual champ
ionships. Stanford hopes to
qualify several players in both
singles and doubles, and led by
Jordan and Moulton, they
should do well.

TIM MAYOTTE AND KATHY JORDAN were two stars who shined on the court this weekend against
UCLA. Mayotte won 16 straight points on his way to defeating Blaine Willenborg 6-4, 6-2. Jordan
routined her number one counterpart at UCLA, Dana Gilbert, 6-4, 6-2.
Stanford retained its
Pacific-10 Conference tennis
title Saturday with an impres
sive 7-2 upset win over top
ranked UCLA. The win gave the
Cardinals a 9-1 Pac-10 mark
while the Bruins dropped to
8-2.
Once again it was the Card
freshmen who sparked the at
tack. Scott Bondurant lost his
first game to UCLA's Dick Metz
before running off five straight
on his way to a 6-2 victory.
The big-hitting Metz just did
not have the passing shots to
counter Bondurant's"chipand
charge" strategy, losing the
second set by an identical 6-2
score.
Bondurant, despite playing
the entire match with a bor
rowed racquet from teammate
Andy Chase after having his
stolen Friday night, jumped to
a 5-0 lead in that second set
before finishing up the victory.
In the most exciting match of
the day, emotional Jeff Arons
defeated Marcel Freeman 6-2,
7-5. A combination of erratic
play by Freeman and a tenaci
ous net game by Arons led to
the victory by the Portola Val
ley native.
Arons cited the crowd as a
big factor in his success.
"The crowd really had rnt
pumped up," said the happy
winner. "I kept attacking
throughout the match. That's
the only way to beat Marcel."
Arons played perhaps his
finest match of the season. He
broke Freeman in the opening
game and twice more in the
first set in winning 6-2.
Breaks were not so easy to
come by in the second set.
Both players held serve to
five-ail, but then Arons
capitalized on two Freeman er
rors for the decisive break. At
6-5 the game score went to
three-all, but Freeman missed
a backhead passing shot and
Arons had the match.
Teammate Tim Mayotte,
warming up on the next court,
was so overcome with Arons'
victory that he ran over and
picked him up following the
match point.
Mayotte then proceeded to
defeat Blaine Willenborg 6-4,
6-2, coming from behind after
being down 2-4 in the opening
set.
"I know exactly what I had to
do to beat Willenborg,"
Mayotte said. "I know I had to
get to the net behind my return
of serve. I also served real well;
that didn't hurt. I didn't even
think of being behind."
Willenborg's junkball
strategy had little effect on
Mayotte, who refused to stay in
the backcourt and rally with
him.
After a shaky start this year,
Mayotte has rallied to win eight
singles matches in a row.
"I'm practicing a lot more
and it's starting to pay off," the
Massachusetts native said.
"Jeff Arons has also helped me
with my serve and it's really im
proved."
The lone singles loss for the
Cards came when 17-year-old
freshman Bruce Brescia de
feated |im Hodges 7-6, 6-4.
Hodges had six break points
in Brescia's first three service
games but could only break
once. That break held to 5-4,
and Hodges was serving at tri
ple set point.
Brescia saved the first one
with a let cord shot. On the
second set point, the grip of
Hodges' racquet pulled off,
and the point was lost. At
three-all, new racquet in hand,
Hodges missed a volley and
Brescia went on to win the set
in a 5-1 tiebreaker.
With the momentum now
turned his way, Brescia pulled

out a 6-4 second set to win the
match.
Bruin Mike Harrington then
teamed up with Freeman to
drop Hodges and Bondurant in
the number two doubles
match 6-3, 7-5, and the match
score stood at 3-2 Stanford.
Knowing they could put the
Bruins back to the wall with a
victory, Mayotte and Arons,
undefeated in dual match play,
remained that way with a 6-3,
6-3 drubbing of Metz and Bres
cia.
"Jeff and I really blend well
together," Mayotte said. "The
crowd really helped us, too."
UCLA coach Glenn Bassett
echoed Mayotte's sentiments.
"When a young team like
Stanford plays in front of a par
tisan crowd like today's, it can
make a big difference," the
UCLA mentor said.
Lloyd Bourne put the final
nail in the UCLA coffin when
the match shifted to Maples
Pavilion Saturday night, regis
tering a 6-3, 6-4 win over Har
rington. In their previous
match Bourne managed to win
just four games
"The trip to Los Angeles last
month was the worst road trip
I've had since I've been at Stan
ford," Bourne said. "The re
venge factor was definitely in
my mind."
Bourne won the toss and
elected to receive, looking for
an early break.
"The crowd takes a little get
ting used to," he pointed out.
"I was hoping he would be a
little nervous and I could get
out in front."
Bourne's strategy paid off as
Harrington double-faulted
twice in the first game, allow
ing Bourne to take the early
lead. Harrington broke back to
tie the set at two, but was sub
sequently broken two more
times in the first set.
Attacking more than he
normally does, Bourne hit a
backhand volley at Har
rington's feet to clinch the
match and the Pac-10 title for
the Cards.
"It was a little intimidating
playing here," Harrington said.
"The court here is much faster
than ours at UCLA. Lloyd also
got in a good percentage of
first serves. He didn't do that
(the) last time we played."
With the match won, the
number one singles match was
somewhat anticlimactic. Free
swinging Fritz Buehning, who
said he was "not as keyed as I
would have been had the
match been on the line," lost
to Stanford's Peter Rennert 6-4,
3-6, 2-6.
Buehning used his power
game to win the first set, but
Rennert, who admitted being a
little flat at the outset, came
back to avenge an earlier de
feat to the rangy Bruin, break
ing Buehning three times in the
final set.
"I always go out planning to
play a three-set match," said
Stanford's top player. "If I
thought any other way I
wouldn't be mentally prepared
if the match did go three sets."
The number one doubles
match went down to the final
point, Rennert and Bourne
teaming up to beat the
hyperactive team of Buehning
and Willenborg, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6
(5-4).
The Card duo won the first
set and were up a break in the
second before a succession of
good lobs by the David and
Goliath team (Buehning is nine
inches taller than Willenborg)
forced Rennert to miss an
overhead on a three-all point
for the break.
With the score in games at
three-all, both teams held ser
vice throughout to force a tieb
reaker. UCLA took it 5-3, win

ning all four Stanford serves.
In the final set, the Cards
were the ones who had to
make up a break deficit to force
a tiebreaker. With the tieb
reaker knotted up at four-all,
Rennert drilled forehands from
the backcourt at the Bruin pair,
finally forcing Willenborg to
net a backhand volley and give
the Cards their 10th straight
win in Maples, dating back to
last season.
The win should give tht
Cards confidence going into
the NCAAs next week that they
are definitely a good bet to take
it all. Stanford decisively de
feated the top-ranked team,
something nobody else has
been able to accomplish (USC
dealt the Bruins their only
other loss, 5-4). The NCAA
team championship begins
next Monday at Athens, Geor
gia, with the individual tour
nament beginning on the fol
lowing Friday.

If last Friday's match bet
ween the Stanford and UCLA
women's tennis teams had
been separated between the
afternoon outdoor matches
and the featured indoor con
tests in Maples, the final score
would have been 1-1. As it was,
however, the Bruins staked
themselves to an insurmount
able 5-1 lead early in the day,
and even three straight indoor
victories could not save the
Cardinals from a 5-4 loss.
The defeat in their last regu
lar season dual match left the
Cardinals with a 9-4 record on
the year. All four of Stanford's
losses came at the hands of its
southern California rivals, USC
and UCLA. Friday's loss was the
Cardinals' second straight
one-point loss to UCLA this
year, and was especially dis
couraging to women's coach
Anne Gould.
"UCLA played very well,"
she said. UCLA did not, how
ever, have to face a Cardinal
team that included All -
American Diane Morrison,
who left the team several
weeks ago to turn pro.
"I think that our loss of
Diane really hurt us, especially
in the doubles," Gould said.
"The girls who played in the
second and third doubles had
never really played together in
competition before. They
played well, but their inexperi
ence prevented them from
playing as well as they could
have, and in the end UCLA's
depth and experience paid
off."
In the afternoon singles
matches at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, UCLA jumped out to
a quick 3-1 lead. Ail-American
Susie Hagey of Stanford pro
vided the only Cardinal victory
with a well-played 6-0, 6-4 win
over UCLA's Ann Henricksson.
Hagey was playing in her
final home-court appearance
before she graduates and turns
pro in June. The graceful
senior's powerful serve and
forehand were at their best as
! she overwhelmed her Bruin
opponent in the number three
singles contest.
In the number four and five
singles matches, Stanford's
Donna Rubin and Sue Rasmus
sen were defeated 6-3, 6-3 and
6-3, 6-4 in matches which were
closer than their scores would
indicate. In the final afternoon
singles match, Cardinal Caryn
Hertel, after running away with
the first set, suffered a fatal
mental letdown that cost her
the match at 1-6,6-2,6-0 to UC
LA's Shannon Gordon.
With UCLA leading 3-1, the
No. 2 and 3 doubles matches
began. Hagey, minus her
long-time partner Morrison,
teamed up with Rubin to face
Bruins Lucy Gordon and
number one singles player
Dana Gilbert. Hagey and Rubin
played well, but they lost some
key points to their hard-hitting
opponents and lost 7-5, 6-4.
Two courts down, Cards
Rasmussen and Hertel were
facing UCLA's Becky Bell and
Kathy O'Brien. Bell and O'B
rien continually lobbed suc
cessfully over the Stanford
pair, winning their doubles
match with an identical 7-5, 6-4
scoreandclinchinga UCLAvic-

Tory at 5-1.
The evening's featured
matches in Maples were un
derstandably subdued and
anti-climactic. Leading off was
the number two singles match
between Stanford's Alycia
Moulton and UCLA's O'Brien.
Moulton came into the match
undefeated on the year, and
that's the way she came out,
winning 6-3, 7-5. Moulton'sbig
serve and powerful
groundstrokes carried her past
her Bruin opponent, who
forced Moulton to save several
crucial break points in the sec
ond set.
The number one singles
match between Stanford's
Kathy Jordan and UCLA's Dana
Gilbert featured two of the top
collegiate women players in
the nation. Jordan, who will
turn pro next month, took con
trol of the match by serving
well and rushing the net. Gil
bert responded with strong
groundstrokes, but was never
really in the match as Jordan
won 6-4, 6-2.
In the final indoor match,
Jordan and Moulton won the
number one doubles contest
6-1, 7-5 over the previously un
defeated UCLA team of Hen
ricksson and Shannon Gor
don. Jordan and Moulton
ended the year 5-0 as a doubles
team, and should be one of the
favorites in the national indi
vidual championships.
After winning two matches
that were too late to help her
team, Jordan said, "It's a real
letdown to have to play those
matches after already having
lost the team match. But you
have to go out and do it. It's
important for your individual
ranking, and there's still a lot of
personal pride involved."
The Cards' 0-4 performance
against USC and UCLA will
have an important effect upon
their national standing. Previ
ously considered the number
two team in the country behind
USC, the Cards now figure to
be at least a notch lower.
Gould explained, "There is
no real ranking authority in
women's college tennis. But
when it comes down to the
team championships in June,
we'll now be seeded third at
the very best, whereas if we
had beaten UCLA we would
probably have been number
two."
The Cardinal team has al
ready been chosen as one of
the six representatives from
California, Hawaii and Nevada
to go to the national team
championships in lowa June 8
to 12. The next big competition
for the Cards, however, is May
17 to 20 at Cal Poly-Pomona
where individual team mem
bers will compete to qualify for
the national individual champ
ionships. Stanford hopes to
qualify several players in both
singles and doubles, and led by
Jordan and Moulton, they
should do well.

Rasmussen and Hertel were

rien continually lobbed suc
cessfully over the Stanford
pair, winning their doubles
match with an identical 7-5, 6-4
scoreandclinchinga UCLAvic-

Tory at 5-1.
The evening's featured
matches in Maples were un
derstandably subdued and
anti-climactic. Leading off was
the number two singles match
between Stanford's Alycia
Moulton and UCLA's O'Brien.
Moulton came into the match
undefeated on the year, and
that's the way she came out,
winning 6-3, 7-5. Moulton'sbig
serve and powerful
groundstrokes carried her past
her Bruin opponent, who
forced Moulton to save several
crucial break points in the sec
ond set.
The number one singles
match between Stanford's
Kathy Jordan and UCLA's Dana
Gilbert featured two of the top
collegiate women players in
the nation. Jordan, who will
turn pro next month, took con
trol of the match by serving
well and rushing the net. Gil
bert responded with strong
groundstrokes, but was never
really in the match as Jordan
won 6-4, 6-2.
In the final indoor match,
Jordan and Moulton won the
number one doubles contest
6-1, 7-5 over the previously un
defeated UCLA team of Hen
ricksson and Shannon Gor
don. Jordan and Moulton
ended the year 5-0 as a doubles
team, and should be one of the
favorites in the national indi
vidual championships.
After winning two matches
that were too late to help her
team, Jordan said, "It's a real
letdown to have to play those
matches after already having
lost the team match. But you
have to go out and do it. It's
important for your individual
ranking, and there's still a lot of
personal pride involved."
The Cards' 0-4 performance
against USC and UCLA will
have an important effect upon
their national standing. Previ
ously considered the number
two team in the country behind
USC, the Cards now figure to
be at least a notch lower.
Gould explained, "There is
no real ranking authority in
women's college tennis. But
when it comes down to the
team championships in June,
we'll now be seeded third at
the very best, whereas if we
had beaten UCLA we would
probably have been number
two."
The Cardinal team has al
ready been chosen as one of
the six representatives from
California, Hawaii and Nevada
to go to the national team
championships in lowa June 8
to 12. The next big competition
for the Cards, however, is May
17 to 20 at Cal Poly-Pomona
where individual team mem
bers will compete to qualify for
the national individual champ
ionships. Stanford hopes to
qualify several players in both
singles and doubles, and led by
Jordan and Moulton, they
should do well.

TIM MAYOTTE AND KATHY JORDAN were two stars who shined on the court this weekend against
UCLA. Mayotte won 16 straight points on his way to defeating Blaine Willenborg 6-4, 6-2. Jordan
routined her number one counterpart at UCLA, Dana Gilbert, 6-4, 6-2.
Stanford retained its
Pacific-10 Conference tennis
title Saturday with an impres
sive 7-2 upset win over top
ranked UCLA. The win gave the
Cardinals a 9-1 Pac-10 mark
while the Bruins dropped to
8-2.
Once again it was the Card
freshmen who sparked the at
tack. Scott Bondurant lost his
first game to UCLA's Dick Metz
before running off five straight
on his way to a 6-2 victory.
The big-hitting Metz just did
not have the passing shots to
counter Bondurant's"chipand
charge" strategy, losing the
second set by an identical 6-2
score.
Bondurant, despite playing
the entire match with a bor
rowed racquet from teammate
Andy Chase after having his
stolen Friday night, jumped to
a 5-0 lead in that second set
before finishing up the victory.
In the most exciting match of
the day, emotional Jeff Arons
defeated Marcel Freeman 6-2,
7-5. A combination of erratic
play by Freeman and a tenaci
ous net game by Arons led to
the victory by the Portola Val
ley native.
Arons cited the crowd as a
big factor in his success.
"The crowd really had rnt
pumped up," said the happy
winner. "I kept attacking
throughout the match. That's
the only way to beat Marcel."
Arons played perhaps his
finest match of the season. He
broke Freeman in the opening
game and twice more in the
first set in winning 6-2.
Breaks were not so easy to
come by in the second set.
Both players held serve to
five-ail, but then Arons
capitalized on two Freeman er
rors for the decisive break. At
6-5 the game score went to
three-all, but Freeman missed
a backhead passing shot and
Arons had the match.
Teammate Tim Mayotte,
warming up on the next court,
was so overcome with Arons'
victory that he ran over and
picked him up following the
match point.
Mayotte then proceeded to
defeat Blaine Willenborg 6-4,
6-2, coming from behind after
being down 2-4 in the opening
set.
"I know exactly what I had to
do to beat Willenborg,"
Mayotte said. "I know I had to
get to the net behind my return
of serve. I also served real well;
that didn't hurt. I didn't even
think of being behind."
Willenborg's junkball
strategy had little effect on
Mayotte, who refused to stay in
the backcourt and rally with
him.
After a shaky start this year,
Mayotte has rallied to win eight
singles matches in a row.
"I'm practicing a lot more
and it's starting to pay off," the
Massachusetts native said.
"Jeff Arons has also helped me
with my serve and it's really im
proved."
The lone singles loss for the
Cards came when 17-year-old
freshman Bruce Brescia de
feated |im Hodges 7-6, 6-4.
Hodges had six break points
in Brescia's first three service
games but could only break
once. That break held to 5-4,
and Hodges was serving at tri
ple set point.
Brescia saved the first one
with a let cord shot. On the
second set point, the grip of
Hodges' racquet pulled off,
and the point was lost. At
three-all, new racquet in hand,
Hodges missed a volley and
Brescia went on to win the set
in a 5-1 tiebreaker.
With the momentum now
turned his way, Brescia pulled

out a 6-4 second set to win the
match.
Bruin Mike Harrington then
teamed up with Freeman to
drop Hodges and Bondurant in
the number two doubles
match 6-3, 7-5, and the match
score stood at 3-2 Stanford.
Knowing they could put the
Bruins back to the wall with a
victory, Mayotte and Arons,
undefeated in dual match play,
remained that way with a 6-3,
6-3 drubbing of Metz and Bres
cia.
"Jeff and I really blend well
together," Mayotte said. "The
crowd really helped us, too."
UCLA coach Glenn Bassett
echoed Mayotte's sentiments.
"When a young team like
Stanford plays in front of a par
tisan crowd like today's, it can
make a big difference," the
UCLA mentor said.
Lloyd Bourne put the final
nail in the UCLA coffin when
the match shifted to Maples
Pavilion Saturday night, regis
tering a 6-3, 6-4 win over Har
rington. In their previous
match Bourne managed to win
just four games
"The trip to Los Angeles last
month was the worst road trip
I've had since I've been at Stan
ford," Bourne said. "The re
venge factor was definitely in
my mind."
Bourne won the toss and
elected to receive, looking for
an early break.
"The crowd takes a little get
ting used to," he pointed out.
"I was hoping he would be a
little nervous and I could get
out in front."
Bourne's strategy paid off as
Harrington double-faulted
twice in the first game, allow
ing Bourne to take the early
lead. Harrington broke back to
tie the set at two, but was sub
sequently broken two more
times in the first set.
Attacking more than he
normally does, Bourne hit a
backhand volley at Har
rington's feet to clinch the
match and the Pac-10 title for
the Cards.
"It was a little intimidating
playing here," Harrington said.
"The court here is much faster
than ours at UCLA. Lloyd also
got in a good percentage of
first serves. He didn't do that
(the) last time we played."
With the match won, the
number one singles match was
somewhat anticlimactic. Free
swinging Fritz Buehning, who
said he was "not as keyed as I
would have been had the
match been on the line," lost
to Stanford's Peter Rennert 6-4,
3-6, 2-6.
Buehning used his power
game to win the first set, but
Rennert, who admitted being a
little flat at the outset, came
back to avenge an earlier de
feat to the rangy Bruin, break
ing Buehning three times in the
final set.
"I always go out planning to
play a three-set match," said
Stanford's top player. "If I
thought any other way I
wouldn't be mentally prepared
if the match did go three sets."
The number one doubles
match went down to the final
point, Rennert and Bourne
teaming up to beat the
hyperactive team of Buehning
and Willenborg, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6
(5-4).
The Card duo won the first
set and were up a break in the
second before a succession of
good lobs by the David and
Goliath team (Buehning is nine
inches taller than Willenborg)
forced Rennert to miss an
overhead on a three-all point
for the break.
With the score in games at
three-all, both teams held ser
vice throughout to force a tieb
reaker. UCLA took it 5-3, win

ning all four Stanford serves.
In the final set, the Cards
were the ones who had to
make up a break deficit to force
a tiebreaker. With the tieb
reaker knotted up at four-all,
Rennert drilled forehands from
the backcourt at the Bruin pair,
finally forcing Willenborg to
net a backhand volley and give
the Cards their 10th straight
win in Maples, dating back to
last season.
The win should give tht
Cards confidence going into
the NCAAs next week that they
are definitely a good bet to take
it all. Stanford decisively de
feated the top-ranked team,
something nobody else has
been able to accomplish (USC
dealt the Bruins their only
other loss, 5-4). The NCAA
team championship begins
next Monday at Athens, Geor
gia, with the individual tour
nament beginning on the fol
lowing Friday.

If last Friday's match bet
ween the Stanford and UCLA
women's tennis teams had
been separated between the
afternoon outdoor matches
and the featured indoor con
tests in Maples, the final score
would have been 1-1. As it was,
however, the Bruins staked
themselves to an insurmount
able 5-1 lead early in the day,
and even three straight indoor
victories could not save the
Cardinals from a 5-4 loss.
The defeat in their last regu
lar season dual match left the
Cardinals with a 9-4 record on
the year. All four of Stanford's
losses came at the hands of its
southern California rivals, USC
and UCLA. Friday's loss was the
Cardinals' second straight
one-point loss to UCLA this
year, and was especially dis
couraging to women's coach
Anne Gould.
"UCLA played very well,"
she said. UCLA did not, how
ever, have to face a Cardinal
team that included All -
American Diane Morrison,
who left the team several
weeks ago to turn pro.
"I think that our loss of
Diane really hurt us, especially
in the doubles," Gould said.
"The girls who played in the
second and third doubles had
never really played together in
competition before. They
played well, but their inexperi
ence prevented them from
playing as well as they could
have, and in the end UCLA's
depth and experience paid
off."
In the afternoon singles
matches at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, UCLA jumped out to
a quick 3-1 lead. Ail-American
Susie Hagey of Stanford pro
vided the only Cardinal victory
with a well-played 6-0, 6-4 win
over UCLA's Ann Henricksson.
Hagey was playing in her
final home-court appearance
before she graduates and turns
pro in June. The graceful
senior's powerful serve and
forehand were at their best as
! she overwhelmed her Bruin
opponent in the number three
singles contest.
In the number four and five
singles matches, Stanford's
Donna Rubin and Sue Rasmus
sen were defeated 6-3, 6-3 and
6-3, 6-4 in matches which were
closer than their scores would
indicate. In the final afternoon
singles match, Cardinal Caryn
Hertel, after running away with
the first set, suffered a fatal
mental letdown that cost her
the match at 1-6,6-2,6-0 to UC
LA's Shannon Gordon.
With UCLA leading 3-1, the
No. 2 and 3 doubles matches
began. Hagey, minus her
long-time partner Morrison,
teamed up with Rubin to face
Bruins Lucy Gordon and
number one singles player
Dana Gilbert. Hagey and Rubin
played well, but they lost some
key points to their hard-hitting
opponents and lost 7-5, 6-4.
Two courts down, Cards
Rasmussen and Hertel were
facing UCLA's Becky Bell and
Kathy O'Brien. Bell and O'B
rien continually lobbed suc
cessfully over the Stanford
pair, winning their doubles
match with an identical 7-5, 6-4
scoreandclinchinga UCLAvic-

Tory at 5-1.
The evening's featured
matches in Maples were un
derstandably subdued and
anti-climactic. Leading off was
the number two singles match
between Stanford's Alycia
Moulton and UCLA's O'Brien.
Moulton came into the match

that's the way she came out,
winning 6-3, 7-5. Moulton'sbig
serve and powerful
groundstrokes carried her past
her Bruin opponent, who
forced Moulton to save several
crucial break points in the sec
ond set.

trol of the match by serving
well and rushing the net. Gil

matches at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, UCLA jumped out to
a quick 3-1 lead. Ail-American
Susie Hagey of Stanford pro
vided the only Cardinal victory
with a well-played 6-0, 6-4 win
over UCLA's Ann Henricksson.
Hagey was playing in her
final home-court appearance
before she graduates and turns
pro in June. The graceful
senior's powerful serve and
forehand were at their best as
! she overwhelmed her Bruin
opponent in the number three
singles contest.
In the number four and five
singles matches, Stanford's
Donna Rubin and Sue Rasmus
sen were defeated 6-3, 6-3 and
6-3, 6-4 in matches which were
closer than their scores would
indicate. In the final afternoon
singles match, Cardinal Caryn
Hertel, after running away with
the first set, suffered a fatal
mental letdown that cost her
the match at 1-6,6-2,6-0 to UC
LA's Shannon Gordon.
With UCLA leading 3-1, the
No. 2 and 3 doubles matches
began. Hagey, minus her
long-time partner Morrison,
teamed up with Rubin to face
Bruins Lucy Gordon and
number one singles player
Dana Gilbert. Hagey and Rubin
played well, but they lost some
key points to their hard-hitting
opponents and lost 7-5, 6-4.
Two courts down, Cards
Rasmussen and Hertel were
facing UCLA's Becky Bell and
Kathy O'Brien. Bell and O'B
rien continually lobbed suc
cessfully over the Stanford
pair, winning their doubles
match with an identical 7-5, 6-4
scoreandclinchinga UCLAvic-

Tory at 5-1.
The evening's featured
matches in Maples were un
derstandably subdued and
anti-climactic. Leading off was
the number two singles match
between Stanford's Alycia
Moulton and UCLA's O'Brien.
Moulton came into the match
undefeated on the year, and
that's the way she came out,
winning 6-3, 7-5. Moulton'sbig
serve and powerful
groundstrokes carried her past
her Bruin opponent, who
forced Moulton to save several
crucial break points in the sec
ond set.
The number one singles
match between Stanford's
Kathy Jordan and UCLA's Dana
Gilbert featured two of the top
collegiate women players in
the nation. Jordan, who will
turn pro next month, took con
trol of the match by serving
well and rushing the net. Gil
bert responded with strong
groundstrokes, but was never
really in the match as Jordan
won 6-4, 6-2.
In the final indoor match,
Jordan and Moulton won the
number one doubles contest
6-1, 7-5 over the previously un
defeated UCLA team of Hen
ricksson and Shannon Gor
don. Jordan and Moulton
ended the year 5-0 as a doubles
team, and should be one of the
favorites in the national indi
vidual championships.
After winning two matches
that were too late to help her
team, Jordan said, "It's a real
letdown to have to play those
matches after already having
lost the team match. But you
have to go out and do it. It's
important for your individual
ranking, and there's still a lot of
personal pride involved."
The Cards' 0-4 performance
against USC and UCLA will
have an important effect upon
their national standing. Previ
ously considered the number
two team in the country behind
USC, the Cards now figure to
be at least a notch lower.
Gould explained, "There is
no real ranking authority in
women's college tennis. But
when it comes down to the
team championships in June,
we'll now be seeded third at
the very best, whereas if we
had beaten UCLA we would
probably have been number
two."
The Cardinal team has al
ready been chosen as one of
the six representatives from
California, Hawaii and Nevada
to go to the national team
championships in lowa June 8
to 12. The next big competition
for the Cards, however, is May
17 to 20 at Cal Poly-Pomona
where individual team mem
bers will compete to qualify for
the national individual champ
ionships. Stanford hopes to
qualify several players in both
singles and doubles, and led by
Jordan and Moulton, they
should do well.

TIM MAYOTTE AND KATHY JORDAN were two stars who shined on the court this weekend against
UCLA. Mayotte won 16 straight points on his way to defeating Blaine Willenborg 6-4, 6-2. Jordan
routined her number one counterpart at UCLA, Dana Gilbert, 6-4, 6-2.
Stanford retained its
Pacific-10 Conference tennis
title Saturday with an impres
sive 7-2 upset win over top
ranked UCLA. The win gave the
Cardinals a 9-1 Pac-10 mark
while the Bruins dropped to
8-2.
Once again it was the Card
freshmen who sparked the at
tack. Scott Bondurant lost his
first game to UCLA's Dick Metz
before running off five straight
on his way to a 6-2 victory.
The big-hitting Metz just did
not have the passing shots to
counter Bondurant's"chipand
charge" strategy, losing the
second set by an identical 6-2
score.
Bondurant, despite playing
the entire match with a bor
rowed racquet from teammate
Andy Chase after having his
stolen Friday night, jumped to
a 5-0 lead in that second set
before finishing up the victory.
In the most exciting match of
the day, emotional Jeff Arons
defeated Marcel Freeman 6-2,
7-5. A combination of erratic
play by Freeman and a tenaci
ous net game by Arons led to
the victory by the Portola Val
ley native.
Arons cited the crowd as a
big factor in his success.
"The crowd really had rnt
pumped up," said the happy
winner. "I kept attacking
throughout the match. That's
the only way to beat Marcel."
Arons played perhaps his
finest match of the season. He
broke Freeman in the opening
game and twice more in the
first set in winning 6-2.
Breaks were not so easy to
come by in the second set.
Both players held serve to
five-ail, but then Arons
capitalized on two Freeman er
rors for the decisive break. At
6-5 the game score went to
three-all, but Freeman missed
a backhead passing shot and
Arons had the match.
Teammate Tim Mayotte,
warming up on the next court,
was so overcome with Arons'
victory that he ran over and
picked him up following the
match point.
Mayotte then proceeded to
defeat Blaine Willenborg 6-4,
6-2, coming from behind after
being down 2-4 in the opening
set.
"I know exactly what I had to
do to beat Willenborg,"
Mayotte said. "I know I had to
get to the net behind my return
of serve. I also served real well;
that didn't hurt. I didn't even
think of being behind."
Willenborg's junkball
strategy had little effect on
Mayotte, who refused to stay in
the backcourt and rally with
him.
After a shaky start this year,
Mayotte has rallied to win eight
singles matches in a row.
"I'm practicing a lot more
and it's starting to pay off," the
Massachusetts native said.
"Jeff Arons has also helped me
with my serve and it's really im
proved."
The lone singles loss for the
Cards came when 17-year-old
freshman Bruce Brescia de
feated |im Hodges 7-6, 6-4.
Hodges had six break points
in Brescia's first three service
games but could only break
once. That break held to 5-4,
and Hodges was serving at tri
ple set point.
Brescia saved the first one
with a let cord shot. On the
second set point, the grip of
Hodges' racquet pulled off,
and the point was lost. At
three-all, new racquet in hand,
Hodges missed a volley and
Brescia went on to win the set
in a 5-1 tiebreaker.
With the momentum now
turned his way, Brescia pulled

out a 6-4 second set to win the
match.
Bruin Mike Harrington then
teamed up with Freeman to
drop Hodges and Bondurant in
the number two doubles
match 6-3, 7-5, and the match
score stood at 3-2 Stanford.
Knowing they could put the
Bruins back to the wall with a
victory, Mayotte and Arons,
undefeated in dual match play,
remained that way with a 6-3,
6-3 drubbing of Metz and Bres
cia.
"Jeff and I really blend well
together," Mayotte said. "The
crowd really helped us, too."
UCLA coach Glenn Bassett
echoed Mayotte's sentiments.
"When a young team like
Stanford plays in front of a par
tisan crowd like today's, it can
make a big difference," the
UCLA mentor said.
Lloyd Bourne put the final
nail in the UCLA coffin when
the match shifted to Maples
Pavilion Saturday night, regis
tering a 6-3, 6-4 win over Har
rington. In their previous
match Bourne managed to win
just four games
"The trip to Los Angeles last
month was the worst road trip
I've had since I've been at Stan
ford," Bourne said. "The re
venge factor was definitely in
my mind."
Bourne won the toss and
elected to receive, looking for
an early break.
"The crowd takes a little get
ting used to," he pointed out.
"I was hoping he would be a
little nervous and I could get
out in front."
Bourne's strategy paid off as
Harrington double-faulted
twice in the first game, allow
ing Bourne to take the early
lead. Harrington broke back to
tie the set at two, but was sub
sequently broken two more
times in the first set.
Attacking more than he
normally does, Bourne hit a
backhand volley at Har
rington's feet to clinch the
match and the Pac-10 title for
the Cards.
"It was a little intimidating
playing here," Harrington said.
"The court here is much faster
than ours at UCLA. Lloyd also
got in a good percentage of
first serves. He didn't do that
(the) last time we played."
With the match won, the
number one singles match was
somewhat anticlimactic. Free
swinging Fritz Buehning, who
said he was "not as keyed as I
would have been had the
match been on the line," lost
to Stanford's Peter Rennert 6-4,
3-6, 2-6.
Buehning used his power
game to win the first set, but
Rennert, who admitted being a
little flat at the outset, came
back to avenge an earlier de
feat to the rangy Bruin, break
ing Buehning three times in the
final set.
"I always go out planning to
play a three-set match," said
Stanford's top player. "If I
thought any other way I
wouldn't be mentally prepared
if the match did go three sets."
The number one doubles
match went down to the final
point, Rennert and Bourne
teaming up to beat the
hyperactive team of Buehning
and Willenborg, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6
(5-4).
The Card duo won the first
set and were up a break in the
second before a succession of
good lobs by the David and
Goliath team (Buehning is nine
inches taller than Willenborg)
forced Rennert to miss an
overhead on a three-all point
for the break.
With the score in games at
three-all, both teams held ser
vice throughout to force a tieb
reaker. UCLA took it 5-3, win

ning all four Stanford serves.
In the final set, the Cards
were the ones who had to
make up a break deficit to force
a tiebreaker. With the tieb
reaker knotted up at four-all,
Rennert drilled forehands from
the backcourt at the Bruin pair,
finally forcing Willenborg to
net a backhand volley and give
the Cards their 10th straight
win in Maples, dating back to
last season.
The win should give tht
Cards confidence going into
the NCAAs next week that they
are definitely a good bet to take
it all. Stanford decisively de
feated the top-ranked team,
something nobody else has
been able to accomplish (USC
dealt the Bruins their only
other loss, 5-4). The NCAA
team championship begins
next Monday at Athens, Geor
gia, with the individual tour
nament beginning on the fol
lowing Friday.

If last Friday's match bet
ween the Stanford and UCLA
women's tennis teams had
been separated between the
afternoon outdoor matches
and the featured indoor con
tests in Maples, the final score
would have been 1-1. As it was,
however, the Bruins staked
themselves to an insurmount
able 5-1 lead early in the day,
and even three straight indoor
victories could not save the
Cardinals from a 5-4 loss.
The defeat in their last regu
lar season dual match left the
Cardinals with a 9-4 record on
the year. All four of Stanford's
losses came at the hands of its
southern California rivals, USC
and UCLA. Friday's loss was the
Cardinals' second straight
one-point loss to UCLA this
year, and was especially dis
couraging to women's coach
Anne Gould.
"UCLA played very well,"
she said. UCLA did not, how
ever, have to face a Cardinal
team that included All -
American Diane Morrison,
who left the team several
weeks ago to turn pro.
"I think that our loss of
Diane really hurt us, especially
in the doubles," Gould said.
"The girls who played in the
second and third doubles had
never really played together in
competition before. They
played well, but their inexperi
ence prevented them from
playing as well as they could
have, and in the end UCLA's
depth and experience paid
off."
In the afternoon singles
matches at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, UCLA jumped out to
a quick 3-1 lead. Ail-American
Susie Hagey of Stanford pro
vided the only Cardinal victory
with a well-played 6-0, 6-4 win

6-3, 6-4 in matches which were
closer than their scores would
indicate. In the final afternoon
singles match, Cardinal Caryn
Hertel, after running away with
the first set, suffered a fatal
mental letdown that cost her
the match at 1-6,6-2,6-0 to UC
LA's Shannon Gordon.
With UCLA leading 3-1, the
No. 2 and 3 doubles matches
began. Hagey, minus her
long-time partner Morrison,
teamed up with Rubin to face
Bruins Lucy Gordon and
number one singles player
Dana Gilbert. Hagey and Rubin
played well, but they lost some
key points to their hard-hitting
opponents and lost 7-5, 6-4.
