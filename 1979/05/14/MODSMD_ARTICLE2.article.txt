# Three-year decline in minority graduate enrollment reversed

Enrollment of minority students in
graduate programs edged up slightly
this year, ending a three-year de
cline, according to a report by Dean
of Graduate Studies W. Bliss Car
nochan to be delivered to the Faculty
Senate Thursday.
However, the University's record
for appointing women and minority
members to the faculty during 1977-
78 was "not good," Carnochan ad
ded.
Chicano enrollment in Ph.D. and
master's programs accounted for
most of the growth in enrollment fi
gures — a total of seven students —
while native American enrollment
increased by one individual and
black enrollment declined by two.
Minority enrollment in the profes
sional schools of law, business and
medicine was down by two people,
the report states.
In addition, total minority enroll
ment in graduate programs of all

types is down considerably, the re
port said. From a peak of 533 in 1973-
74, the number has steadily declined
to the present figure of 388. There
has been a 25 percent drop in
Chicano enrollment, and a 30 per
cent decline in black graduate stu
dents.
Carnochan said the "modest suc
cess" achieved this year can be attri
buted to several University initia
tives:
— Over the past two years, Stan
ford has been awarded 25 fellow
ships from the graduate and profes
sional opportunities program. These
fellowships provide funding to be
used in recruitment programs and
planning efforts.
— Two consortia — one national
and one western — have been de
veloped to exchange names of well
qualified minority undergraduates.
— A science conference series was
held which attracted 80 participants.
— The Learning Assistance Center

has developed several lew courses,
designed to meet the language and
social needs of gradual students.
"Yes, we have made strides," said
Carnochan, "but anyone who ex
pected that this problem might be
solved quickly is mistaken, though,
of course, such expectations are un
derstandable."
If a graduate school or department
has a minimum of 10 percent minor
ity enrollment, there is fair represen
tation, Carnochan added. While this
figure has been sustained in some
schools, it has not in others.
Carnochan also noted in the report
that only nine women were ap
pointed to the Academic Council last
year, as compared to 97 men.
"Although the percentage of
women on tenure-line appointments
has almost doubled in the last eight
years (from 4.8 percent to 8.4 per
cent), the percentage of women
holding tenure on the faculty has not
