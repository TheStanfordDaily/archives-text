Stanford received a lesson in
rowing Saturday as California
handily swept the four mens'
events in racing action at Red
wood Shores. The Card mens'
novice, frosh, |V and varsity
eights were all defeated by
powerful Cal boats. The
women did not compete this
weekend.
In the novice event, the Cal
boat led from the start, al
though Stanford did make a
bid at the 1200 meter mark. Cal
drew away in the final 500 to
win in 6:40, 12 seconds ahead
of the Card boat.
The Card frosh eight jumped
to an early lead, starting at a
brisk 42 (strokes per minute).
The lead dissipated, though, as
Stanford was unable to settle
into a racing beat of 35. The Cal
boat gradually moved past
Stanford 500 meters into the
race and held a four second
lead at the bridge. This lead
was extended in the final 1000

meters as Stanford was unable
to mount an effective sprint.
Cal crossed the line in 6:23,
Stanford in 6:37.
The |Vs also led at the start as
one of the Cal oarsmen caught
a severe cramp, forcing the Cal
boat to stop. The Cal boat re
covered quickly, caught Stan
ford, and pulled away to finish
in 6:17, while Stanford finished
with a time of 6:40.
The Cal varsity eight, bound
for the Henley Royal Regatta
this summer and fresh from
their upset victory over the
Washington Huskies up in
Seattle last week, looked as
awesome off the water as they
did on (average height in the
boat is 6-foot-3). Testing the
course before next week's
Pacific-10 Championships,
thev covered the 2000 meters
in 6:04. Stanford finished in
6:27.
The crews conclude their

seasons this upcoming
weekend. The women will
compete in the Pac-10 Champ
ionships to be held at Red
wood Shores on May 18 and 19.
The mens' novice and frosh
eights will travel to LosCatosto
compete in the Western
Springs on May 19 and 20. The
mens' JV and varsity eights will
be rowing in both the Pac-10s
and the Western Sprints.
In other Stanford crew
related news, a meeting was
held last Wednesday night to
discuss a possible merger of
the mens' and women's crews
and ways to finance the new
boathouse.
On the mens' crew, Carl
Taussig was appointed to re
place Tom Saftig as captain,
Fred Storey will be replacing
Trey Nicoud as co-captain, Ken
Radtke was selected to replace
Gary Gibson as treasurer, and
Gray Maxwell was selected to
replace Mark Morales as sec
retary.
