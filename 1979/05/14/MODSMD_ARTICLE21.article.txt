Montreal (AP) — Steve Vic
kers, Ron Creschner and Phil
Esposito turned Montreal er
rors into goals yesterday and
Dave Maloney added a short
handed tally as the New York
Rangers stunned the Cana
diens4-1 in the opener of their
National Hockey League final
playoff series.

fourth straight at the Montreal

10-game playoff home winning
streak and gave New York a 1-0
lead in the best-of-seven series
that continues here tomorrow
night.
That cemented New York's
11th victory in 14 playoff games
this spring — the losses werein
overtime — and stole away the

with the regular season's
second-best record.
