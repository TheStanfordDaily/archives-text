# Cards out of NCAAs
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
It had been determined be
fore they boarded the bus
Saturday morning for the dou
ble header in Berkeley. Stan
ford had been eliminated from
post-season competition by
virtue of Arizona already hav
ing beaten Arizona State twice.
Every member of the Stanford
baseball team knew it.
Nevertheless, the Cards
were looking forward to the
twinbill with their rivals from
the other side of the Bay. They
had won 9-5 Friday at Sunken
Diamond; all they had to do
now was win one of the two
remaining games to foil Cal's
hopes of a playoff avenue to
the NCAA championship.
The bus was unusually quiet
on the return trip from Ber
keley: the Bears had won both
of the day's contests by narrow
7-6 margins. It was hard for the
team members to believe that
this was the end of their sea
son, and harder for 10 seniors
to accept the fact that this was
the end of their Stanford
career.
"Four years ago, I never
thought I'd see this day," Joe
LoPresti said. "I didn't want to
lose," he said. "It was the end
of my career, and I wanted it to
end well."
The key in the first game
Saturday was errors. When
Stanford committed an error
(even if it was a mental error
not recorded in the

scorebook), Cal capitalized on
it. However, Stanford failed to
convert Cal's mistakes into
runs, and Cal was none other
than a comedy of errors in the
game, committing eight.
It was a close contest from
the start and thanks to a two
run homer by senior Mike
Codiroli in the seventh, the
score was tied heading into
the eighth. It was then that the
Bears broke it open with a
three-run inning. After LoP
resti had retired the first two
batters of the inning, one-run
and two-run homers put Cal on
top 7-4.
Stanford rallied in the top of
the ninth, capitalizing on at
least one of the Bears' errors.
Larry Reynolds reached first
base on an error by the Cal
shortstop Greg Thys. Phil Wil
son got onboard when he was
hit by a pitch of reliever Steve
Conroy. After Conroy hit Mike
Codiroli loading the bases, Cal
coach Bob Milano called for
another reliever.
Charlie Young,
reliever and part-time quarter
back at Berkeley, got Paul
Zuvella to hit into a fielders'
choice forthe first out, but that
was enough to score a speedy
Reynolds from third. Bruce
Walters ripped a single off
Young to score Wilson making
the Cards only one run short of
the Bears.
The tying run never came.
