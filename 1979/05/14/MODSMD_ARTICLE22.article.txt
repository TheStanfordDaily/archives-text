# Cards out of NCAAs
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
It had been determined be
fore they boarded the bus
Saturday morning for the dou
ble header in Berkeley. Stan
ford had been eliminated from
post-season competition by
virtue of Arizona already hav
ing beaten Arizona State twice.
Every member of the Stanford
baseball team knew it.
Nevertheless, the Cards
were looking forward to the
twinbill with their rivals from
the other side of the Bay. They
had won 9-5 Friday at Sunken
Diamond; all they had to do
now was win one of the two
remaining games to foil Cal's
hopes of a playoff avenue to
the NCAA championship.
The bus was unusually quiet
on the return trip from Ber
keley: the Bears had won both
of the day's contests by narrow
7-6 margins. It was hard for the
team members to believe that
this was the end of their sea
son, and harder for 10 seniors
to accept the fact that this was
the end of their Stanford
career.
"Four years ago, I never
thought I'd see this day," Joe
LoPresti said. "I didn't want to
lose," he said. "It was the end
of my career, and I wanted it to
end well."
The key in the first game
Saturday was errors. When
Stanford committed an error
(even if it was a mental error
not recorded in the

scorebook), Cal capitalized on
it. However, Stanford failed to
convert Cal's mistakes into
runs, and Cal was none other
than a comedy of errors in the
game, committing eight.
It was a close contest from
the start and thanks to a two
run homer by senior Mike
Codiroli in the seventh, the
score was tied heading into
the eighth. It was then that the
Bears broke it open with a
three-run inning. After LoP
resti had retired the first two
batters of the inning, one-run
and two-run homers put Cal on
top 7-4.
Stanford rallied in the top of
the ninth, capitalizing on at
least one of the Bears' errors.
Larry Reynolds reached first
base on an error by the Cal
shortstop Greg Thys. Phil Wil
son got onboard when he was
hit by a pitch of reliever Steve
Conroy. After Conroy hit Mike
Codiroli loading the bases, Cal
coach Bob Milano called for
another reliever.
Charlie Young,
reliever and part-time quarter
back at Berkeley, got Paul
Zuvella to hit into a fielders'
choice forthe first out, but that
was enough to score a speedy
Reynolds from third. Bruce
Walters ripped a single off
Young to score Wilson making
the Cards only one run short of
the Bears.
The tying run never came.
Cal turned a double play to re
tire the side and claim the vic
tory.
In the second game of the
doubleheader played in the
80-degree weather, Stanford
jumped to a 5-0 lead in the third
inning. Wilson started the rally
for the Cards leading off the
inning with a solo home run
driven deep into left-center
field.
Stanford's lead was soon
overcome by a bigger inning
for the Bears. Eleven Cal bat
ters came to the plate that in
ning. A two-run home run for
outfielder Dan Mclnerny was

the start of the trouble for Brian
Harrison. Harrison gave up
three singles immediately
thereafter and was then re
lieved by Larry Kuhn.
Coming in with the bases
loaded (even with two outs),
Kuhn was under pressure. He
walked the first batter and al
lowed the next a double.
The Cards tied the score with
a single run in the seventh. De
signated hitter Mike Zboralske
scored Bruce Walters from
second with a single to left.
Walters sprinted the 180 feet
ignoring the pain in knees that
have bothered him all year
long.

Paul Grame was the Stan
ford pitcher put on the spot in
the last half of the ninth when
the score was still tied 6-6. He
had come on in relief of Kuhn
in the fifth and had allowed no
thing more than two walks in
his appearance.
He easily struck out Kelly
Wood, the Bears' designated
hitter, but Mclnerny had a re
cord to set. Mac blasted his
13th homer of the year, setting
a single season mark for Ber
keley.
The ball sailed over the cen
terfield fence at least 400 feet
away. It was a heartbreak for
Stanford, a hope for Cal.
