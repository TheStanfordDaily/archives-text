# Drysdale censure attempt fails
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
An attempt by ASSU Senator Jim
Esserman to officially censure senate
Chairperson George Drysdale for his
role in placing the senate's election
districting proposal on the spring
quarter ballot as a constitutional
amendment rather than a referen
dum failed at Thursday night's senate
meeting.
Esserman quoted section 2 of Arti
cle VII of the ASSU Constitution,
which says that an election on
petitioned amendments shall be
held "in not less than six nor more
than 24 days after the opening of the
following quarter." He claimed that
Drysdale's action this quarter was
thus blatantly unconstitutional.
Apparently, the majority of the se
nate did not share Esserman's view,
and he was left to lament that "I'm
extremely disappointed that people
can be so irresponsible to totally ig
nore the constitution."
In other business, the senate pas
sed by an 8-3 vote Sen. Geoff Baskir's
bylaws amendment to allow for
write-in voting in future elections. In
this way, the senate avoided the
necessity of holding another student
election, which would otherwise
have been mandated by the 600-plus
signatures Baskir obtained on peti
tions.
Poll students
Instead, Drysdale said that the se
nate decided to poll students
through their House Associates for
opinions on the mascot battle bet
ween the Griffons and the Trees and
on various election reform mea
sures.
A committee composed of former
Sen. Suzanne Whipple, new Elec
tions Commissioner ]im Monen,
chairman of the senate Rules Com
mittee John Struthers, Robert Doc
ters of the Election Review Board and
advocates of both the Trees and the
Griffons were appointed to investi
gate the logistics of that project.
Esserman reported that the Uni
versity will begin construction of
lighted tennis courts this summer, at
the senate's urging. He also an
nounced that Athletic Director Andy
Geiger will hold a press conference
on the stadium bottle ban today.
Sen. Ron Johnson gave the long
awaited report of the Coors task
force. "The consensus opinion was
that there are reasons why an indi

vidual can choose to boycott Coors
beer, but we feel the University
should take no action against Coors
and continue its present policy," he
said.
Recommended reading
He recommended that students
read the committee's report and
"make their own decision."
Proceedings of the ad hoc housing
committee and progress made to
ward the establishment of dormitory
mail boxes were detailed by Sen.
Brett Kingstone.
The senate approved the Financial
Manager's operating budget of
$113,348.76 for nextyearand Finance
Committee allocations of $250 for
Cinco de Mayo celebrations and of
$100 to the Canadian Club. The

monetary allocations of the
Academic Organizations Board also
passed senate scrutiny, as did the re
commendations of the outgoing
Elections Commission.
After hearing a report by former
Special Events director Brian Becker,
the senate advised its Financial
Committee to consider Special
Events at its next meeting.
The senate donated $100 from its
Program Fee to fund this Saturday's
"Splendor on the Crass" in Man
zanita Park.
Drysdale announced that Carl
Chamberlin and Lisa Foster were ap
pointed to the Nominations Commit
tee at a special meeting May 2. A
graduate position on that committee
remains vacant.
