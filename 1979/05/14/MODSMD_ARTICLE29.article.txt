U.S., China negotiate trade pact
Canton, China — Commerce Secretary Juanita Kreps,
warning that last-minute snags still could develop, said
she will "quite likely" initial a trade pact with China
today.
She told reporters the plan to initial the document in
Canton was tentative and warned, "There is always a
danger of slippage. We have made great progress and I
now think it quite likely we will initial a trade agreement
tomorrow."
The secretary said she tentatively plans to initial the
document after it is flown to Canton, last stop on her
current China tour. American and Chinese negotiators
in Peking have been working on the complex language
of the agreement for more than a week.
U.S.-Chinese trade totaled $1.1 billion in 1978. After
the establishment of diplomatic relations in January,
U.S. officials projected the figure would hit $2 billion in
1979 and reach $3 billion to $4 billion a year by 1984.
The agreement reportedly will ease Chinese restric
tions on U.S. businessmen, protect U.S. markets from
disruption by Chinese imports and guarantee patents,
trademarks and copyrights.
President limmy Carter has said that after a trade ag
reement is concluded, he will ask Congress to grant
China most-favored-nation trading status, which means
no other nation could be granted better trade provi
sions.
Brown revises rationing pian
As long lines surrounded the few gasoline stations
open yesterday, Gov. Jerry Brown moved to force more
stations to pump the precious fuel on weekends.
Brown's office in Sacramento said he had directed
state Energy Commission Chairman Richard Maullin to
draft emergency regulations requiring at least half of the
stations in counties participating in the odd-even
gasoline allocation program to remain open weekends.
"The odd-even plan depends on the availability of gas
on a seven-day basis," Brown said. "Currently, many
stations in California are open only Monday through
Friday."
Brown, who last Tuesday proclaimed a state of
emergency implementing the odd-even gas allocation
program in most parts of the state, directed Maullin to
give him the new regulations tomorrow morning for his
immediate signature.
The odd-even plan had mixed success throughout the
week, but as the weekend approached, the Auto Club
predicted that more than 90 percent of California's gas
stations would be closed Saturday and Sunday. That
forecast was borne out by long lines and short tempers
at those stations pumping over the weekend.
Dole aspires to presidency
Washington — Bob Dole (R-Kan.) says he learned a lot
as President Gerald Ford's hard-punching running mate
in 1976. Now he wants to try doing it his way.
Dole plans to announce today in his hometown of
Russell, Kan., that he is a candidate for the Republican

presidential nomination.
"In this campaign, we'll be setting the tone," he said
in a pre-announcement interview. "I'll be the candi
date."
It wasn't that way in 1976 when Dole was assigned the
tough-guy role. Some say his acerbic barbs at Democrat
Walter Mondale during the vice presidential candidate
debates hurt the Ford-Dole ticket.
But despite the criticism, Dole thinks he scored some
points standing beside Ford in that losing effort. He
learned a lot about national campaigning, he made
friends, and he gained public recognition.
Another factor in his campaign will be his long career
in Congress. Dole is the ranking Republican on the Fi
nance Committee and recognized as one of the Senate's
authorities on agriculture.
Talmadge aide to testify
Washington — The Senate Ethics Committee's exami
nation of Sen. Herman Talmadge's (D-Ga.) financial af
fairs hits a high point this week when his chief accuser
takes the witness stand for the first time.
Daniel Minchew, who spent three years as Talmadge's
top aide — including two years in which he admits he
funneled nearly $39,000 in expense overcharges and
campaign contributions into a secret account — is ex
pected to take the stand tomorrow.
It is to be the first time that Michew and Talmadge
have come face-to-face in a public meeting since the two
men began trading charges over the secret account.
The committee has spent two weeks preparing for this
testimony, which could have a major bearing on
whether the panel sustains or dismisses the financial
misconduct allegations it filed against Talmadge.
White trial enters final stages
San Francisco — The Dan White murder trial, nearing
the jury, resumes today with the prosecution expected
to call more rebuttal witnesses to the defense's case.
Prosecutor Tom Norman indicated Friday he has sev
eral "brief" witnesses before resting his case. There has
been no indication whether the defense will offer any
more testimony.
Superior Court judge Walter Calcagno told the jury,
sequestered in a hotel since testimony began two weeks
ago, to expect to receive the case tomorrow.
Norman called a San Francisco psychiatrist, Dr. Ro
land Levy, to the witness stand Friday to dispute the
contentions of defense psychiatrists that White, 32, was
mentally ill with severe depression when he shot and
killed Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Ffarvey
Milk last Nov. 27.
Today's weather

with local afternoon clearing. Otherwise fair with cooler
days. Lows in the low to mid 50s. Highs in the 60s near
the coast to the low 80s inland. Northwest winds to 20
