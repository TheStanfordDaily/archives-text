# CIR wants GM action restricted

### Nancy Koehn 
The University Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) unanimously recommended last
Thursday that the University support a sharehol
der resolution that would bar General Motors
(GM) sales to South African military and police.
In another vote CI R members decided to take no
action on a stockholder proposal calling for with
drawal of all GM operations in South Africa.
The recommendation by the advisory group of
students, faculty, staff and alumni will be consi
dered by the Board of Trustees Select Committee
on Investment Responsibility (SCIR) during a
nationwide telephone conference call on Friday.
According to Fred Hillier, chairman of CIR and
professor of operations research, the University
owns 81,000 shares of GM stock. GM stockholders
meet May 25.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Conference last
Thursday, Hillierexplained the reasons behind the
ClR's decision to take no action on the resolution
calling for GM withdrawal from South Africa.
'Very poorly worded'
According to Hillier, the stockholder proposal

was drawn up by a single individual and was "very
poorly worded. We (the CIR members) didn't feel
the proponent of the resolution gave direct evi
dence against this particular company. Rather, he
was addressing the general situation," he said.
Hillier also cited the company's actions in South
Africa as rationale behind the decision, saying,
"GM has had a relatively progressive record in
South Africa."
CIR members seemed divided on the issue. Two
members cast ballots in favor of the withdrawal
resolution. Three members voted against the
proposal and two members abstained from the
balloting, according to Hillier.
Hillier said he would "hesitate to predict the
SCIR vote on the resolution" but noted that he
would "not be at all surprised if it (SCIR) abstained
or took no action" on the resolution.
The commission chairman said CIR members
are optimistic about the SCIR vote on the stoc
kholder resolution barring GM sales to South Afri
can military and police.
Members' optimism
He cited the SCIR decision on the Ford

shareholder proposal earlier this month as the
reason behind commission members' optimism,
saying, "Unless they (the SCIR members) detect
some significant differences from the Ford prop
osal, I see no reason why the vote should be diffe
rent from that on Ford."
SCIR members unanimously voted May 7 to
support a shareholder resolution which would bar
Ford Motor Co. sales to South African military and
police.
Hillier also commented on the future of the CIR.
"I think the question of investment responsibility,
of,how to vote on a shareholder resolution in a
socially responsible way, will be a permanent issue
facing the University. Thus, the CIR will be a per
manent fixture here."
Hillier added that CIR members were "very
pleased with this year's SCIR votes on CIR recom
mendations." He noted, that "SCIR and CIR have
been quite consistent in voting in favor of actions
calling for significant action in South Africa."
On sabbatical leave next year, Hillier said he
would resign as CIR chairman after this year's bus
iness is completed.
