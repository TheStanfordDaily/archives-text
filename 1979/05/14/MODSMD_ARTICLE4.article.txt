Spring Faire draws artists, craftspeople
More than 120 artists and craftspeople displayed their wares at the eighth annual Spring Faire, held in White
Plaza this past Mother's Day weekend. A percentage of the gross revenue from the faire will go to The Bridge, a
peer counseling center here, operated by volunteers. Continuous entertainment by strolling players was
scheduled, and a number of home-baked goods were offered to hungry patrons.
