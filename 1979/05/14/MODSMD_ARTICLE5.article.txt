# Lack of student sponsors foils Moon group's campus drive
## 
### Robin Millington 
A student's signature was allegedly forged
by members of the Collegiate Association
for the Research of Principles (CARP) last
month in an attempt to gain recognition as a
student organization here, according to
Tom Massey, director of student activities.
In reality, no University students have
been willing to actively take responsibility
for or participate in this group, Massey said.
CARP is an international organization
"based on the 'Divine Principle,' proclaimed
by the founder of the Unification Church
International, Rev. Sun Myung Moon," ac
cording to CARP literature.
College students and non-students be
long to CARP, which is active on over 20
college campuses in the United States, with
one of the largest active groups at UC-
Berkeley.
Members of the Berkeley group ap
proached Massey late in March asking to
hold a "celebration" here. They were told by
Massey that for an organization to be active
on campus, five currently registered stu
dents must take active responsibility for the
leadership and organization of the group.
Any outside organizations must be spon

sored by a group officially recognized by the
University.
According to Massey, after CARP was in
formed of the University policy, members of
the group approached students asking for
signatures on a petition for the festival. The
petition in no way indicated that the stu
dents would be actively involved in the
group, Massey said.
"They did get names of students who
would be willing to sponsor them if they
only needed a name, but who didn't want to
get involved in any other way," he said.
A few days later, the group members ap
proached Massey with a Registration of Vol
untary Organizations Form, a statement of
students' intent to take active responsibility
for the group. The form had five student
signatures on the bottom, including one
signature which indicated that the student
would be the contact person for the group.
Massey contacted the five students on the
form and found that "two of the five stu
dents had not said they were willing to form
an organization."
Massey also said that the student whose
name was listed as coordinator brought in a
written statement that said he did not sign

the form in that space.
"They forged his signature," Massey said.
Though not one of the members who was
involved in the incident here, Berkeley
CARP member Jim Bougherty said, "At the
time, the students actually did sign the form.
At least that's what I heard.
"We were getting a lot of pressure from
the administration. The administration was
supposedly pressuring students not to be
come involved."
lames Lyons, dean of student affairs, said
that he was very surprised at these charges.
"One of the reasons our activities office
often checks an organization that is new is
because there are groups like Moonies
around who are never honest and forthright
about what they are doing," Lyons said.
A student here who recently returned
from a Unification Church training session
and wished to remain anonymous,
explained that in the church's doctrine, this
sort of action is not necessarily wrong. The
church teaches a doctrine of Heavenly De
ception which in essence is the concept of
the ends justif the means.
The student explained that followers are
so dedicates to the belief that their

philosophy is the only possible means of
creating an ideal world, that practically any
action is justified if it is for the cause.
"They have their Principle of Heavenly
Deception which allows them to misinform
people to achieve a perfect world. They
don't necessarily lie just to lie, but if it's
necessary, it's justifiable," the student
explained.
In the past, there have been reports of
stealing or acts of physical violence by
church members to achieve their ends,
though the student said he had not witnes
sed such acts. Moon does not publicly con
done these actions or the concept of
heavenly deception.
The student said that they "are totally sin
cere in what they are doing," though it may
be interpreted as dishonesty or deception
by others.
"Their purpose is not only to recognize
their ideals but to go beyond them and live
them," he said.
Members of the Unification Church, often
referred to as "Moonies" because of their
ultimate belief that Moon is the "Lord of the
Second Advent," use a number of organiza
tions like CARP to spread their beliefs. They

own a farm in Boonville in Mendocino
County where much of theirtraining occurs.
The goal of the church's doctrine is the
creation of a "perfect world." This world
start? by becoming a perfect person which
eventually leads to a perfect state. The
church is avidly opposed to communism as a
political system.
The training program consists of a visit to a
center such as the Boonville farm, for a
weekend of intensive lectures on the faith.
According to Karen Agnew, a student who
went to one of the weekend sessions to do
research for a paper, the idea of Moon, and
his involvement in the group's beliefs are
not immediately presented.
A person could easily get involved in the
weekend session without ever knowing that
they were becoming involved with the Un
ification Church, she said.
The anonymous student explained that
the group uses less than straightforward
methods when it approaches people be
cause "first of all Moon has a bad reputation,
and second, a person being presented with
the idea of a new messiah can be really
turned off before they've listened to what
the group has to say."

turned off before they've listened to what
the group has to say."
A student's signature was allegedly forged
by members of the Collegiate Association
for the Research of Principles (CARP) last
month in an attempt to gain recognition as a
student organization here, according to
Tom Massey, director of student activities.
In reality, no University students have
been willing to actively take responsibility
for or participate in this group, Massey said.
CARP is an international organization
"based on the 'Divine Principle,' proclaimed
by the founder of the Unification Church
International, Rev. Sun Myung Moon," ac
cording to CARP literature.
College students and non-students be
long to CARP, which is active on over 20
college campuses in the United States, with
one of the largest active groups at UC-
Berkeley.
Members of the Berkeley group ap
proached Massey late in March asking to
hold a "celebration" here. They were told by
Massey that for an organization to be active
on campus, five currently registered stu
dents must take active responsibility for the
leadership and organization of the group.
Any outside organizations must be spon

sored by a group officially recognized by the
University.
According to Massey, after CARP was in
formed of the University policy, members of
the group approached students asking for
signatures on a petition for the festival. The
petition in no way indicated that the stu
dents would be actively involved in the
group, Massey said.
"They did get names of students who
would be willing to sponsor them if they
only needed a name, but who didn't want to
get involved in any other way," he said.
A few days later, the group members ap
proached Massey with a Registration of Vol
untary Organizations Form, a statement of
students' intent to take active responsibility
for the group. The form had five student
signatures on the bottom, including one
signature which indicated that the student
would be the contact person for the group.
Massey contacted the five students on the
form and found that "two of the five stu
dents had not said they were willing to form
an organization."
Massey also said that the student whose
name was listed as coordinator brought in a
written statement that said he did not sign

the form in that space.
"They forged his signature," Massey said.
Though not one of the members who was
involved in the incident here, Berkeley
CARP member Jim Bougherty said, "At the
time, the students actually did sign the form.
At least that's what I heard.
"We were getting a lot of pressure from
the administration. The administration was
supposedly pressuring students not to be
come involved."
lames Lyons, dean of student affairs, said
that he was very surprised at these charges.
"One of the reasons our activities office
often checks an organization that is new is
because there are groups like Moonies
around who are never honest and forthright
about what they are doing," Lyons said.
A student here who recently returned
from a Unification Church training session
and wished to remain anonymous,
explained that in the church's doctrine, this
sort of action is not necessarily wrong. The
church teaches a doctrine of Heavenly De
ception which in essence is the concept of
the ends justif the means.
The student explained that followers are
so dedicates to the belief that their

philosophy is the only possible means of
creating an ideal world, that practically any
action is justified if it is for the cause.
"They have their Principle of Heavenly
Deception which allows them to misinform
people to achieve a perfect world. They
don't necessarily lie just to lie, but if it's
necessary, it's justifiable," the student
explained.
In the past, there have been reports of
stealing or acts of physical violence by
church members to achieve their ends,
though the student said he had not witnes
sed such acts. Moon does not publicly con
done these actions or the concept of
heavenly deception.
The student said that they "are totally sin
cere in what they are doing," though it may
be interpreted as dishonesty or deception
by others.
"Their purpose is not only to recognize
their ideals but to go beyond them and live
them," he said.
Members of the Unification Church, often
referred to as "Moonies" because of their
ultimate belief that Moon is the "Lord of the
Second Advent," use a number of organiza
tions like CARP to spread their beliefs. They

own a farm in Boonville in Mendocino
County where much of theirtraining occurs.
The goal of the church's doctrine is the
creation of a "perfect world." This world
start? by becoming a perfect person which
eventually leads to a perfect state. The
church is avidly opposed to communism as a
political system.
The training program consists of a visit to a
center such as the Boonville farm, for a
weekend of intensive lectures on the faith.
According to Karen Agnew, a student who
went to one of the weekend sessions to do
research for a paper, the idea of Moon, and
his involvement in the group's beliefs are
not immediately presented.
A person could easily get involved in the
weekend session without ever knowing that
they were becoming involved with the Un
ification Church, she said.
The anonymous student explained that
the group uses less than straightforward
methods when it approaches people be
cause "first of all Moon has a bad reputation,
and second, a person being presented with
the idea of a new messiah can be really
turned off before they've listened to what
the group has to say."
