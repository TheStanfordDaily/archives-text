# Lomita construction protested; final Lyman decision due today
## 
### Steve Neff 
Students opposed to the proposed Lomita Drive ex
tension rallied in the sun between the Knoll and Campus
Drive for a final protest Friday. The rally site, sometimes
known as Eels Field, will soon be plowed under if peti
tions fail to affect President Richard Lyman's final deci
sion today.
Under the plan to convert Mayfield into a pedestrian
mall, cars on Campus Drive would no longer be able to
turn right onto Mayfield in front of the Robert Moore
houses. Instead, traffic would be diverted onto Lomita
Drive, which would be extended to intersect Campus
Drive.
The proposed Lomita extension would funnel inner
campus traffic to the Junipero Serra Expressway more
efficiently than Mayfield, said )ohn Lerry, manager for
construction and engineering.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the president for trustee
affairs, indicated that although the extension will proba
bly be approved, the final decision will be reached only
after all student input has been heard.
Members of the Alpha Delt fraternity have been cir
culating petitions protesting the Lomita extension and
hope to have 1000 signatures by today.
Concerned individuals at the rally expressed dissatis
faction with the plan which would upset the otherwise
tranquil environment of the "lake cluster."
"The Knoll area, potentially an optimal location for a
park that would benefit the entire Stanford community

would vanish forever if Lomita were extended,"
explained Alpha Delt Chris Wright.
One perplexed bystander just said, "They're gonna
mow down my favorite tree."
Lake cluster residents affected by the move also feel
that the quarter-million dollar project would just "relo- ,
cate" the problem of campus traffic congestion.
According to rally members, alternatives to the Lomita
extension exist. Campus Drive West, a dirt Access road
to Junipero Serra which flanks the golf range, could be
developed to accommodate the University's traffic prob
lems. This road would be equally efficient, less costly, .
and have minimal impact on the quality of student life,. •
they claimed.
Lerry said that the Campus Drive extension, held in •
abeyance for some time in anticipation of future housing.:
projects, is scheduled to be completed within two years,
but not just now.
The Campus West road was only one of the alterna- ;
tives highlighted by the protest rally, and most lake
cluster members feel other options have not been con
sidered in order to preserve Eels Field.
"I'm tired of hearing about it (the plan)," said
Hamrdla. "To my knowledge the project has not been in ■
question (objected to) in over a year."
However, following the announcement of the prop
osed extension Feb. 27 a series of questions surfaced
concerning traffic congestion, air quality, noise pollu
tion and the extension's effect on the student environ
ment.
