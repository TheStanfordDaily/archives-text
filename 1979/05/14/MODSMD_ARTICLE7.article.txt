## Basic tax reform needed 
### 
Someone once suggested
that the only things the gov
ernment does well are making
war and inflating the money
supply: after Vietnam, one
may wish to exclude "making
war" from the maxim.
It is increasingly obvious —
in the wake of Vietnam, Water
gate, Proposition 13, thefailure
of the Great Society, the immi
nent bankruptcy of Social Sec
urity, etc. — that government
has failed.
That should not be surpris
ing: we were asking it to do
things beyond its capabilities.
The political order of society
is distinguished from the other
facets of social existence
(economic, religious and so
on) b its ultimate reliance on
the sancti n of physical force:
government is the social in
stitution which possesses an
effective monopoly in a given
territory on the control of the
use of force.
Stems from gun
In the final analysis, as the
late Chinese leader Mao Tse
tung said, political power
grows out of the barrel of a
gun.
Every society requires some
sort of political order (though
not necessarily government as
conventionally envisaged —
consider the system of jural
anarchy of libertarian scholar
Murray Rothbard and others)
to ensure that disagreements
and conflicts are contained
short of civil war.
However, force — physical
violence — is constructive only
when it is restricted solely to
the defensive role of prevent
ing and punishing the unpro
voked initiation of force by ag
gressive individuals or groups.
To believe that forceful
coercion can aid the normal
constructive activities of social
cooperation, benevolence and
economic production is to
misperceive the nature of so
cial existence gravely.
Disruptions
When the political order
oversteps its natural limits and
interferes with the peacefully
functioning realm of private
society, the inevitable result is
the disruption of social coop
eration, the relative decline of
material well-being and the in
stigation of class conflict.
These elementary facts are
becoming increasingly obvi
ous even to the less reflective
members of our society.
While most Americans

realize that government has far
overstepped its moral and
practical limits, government's
intervention in contemporary
society is so pervasive that few
Americans can perceive a
method of untangling the cur
rent mess.
When libertarians demand
that government be restricted
to solely defensive activities,
the question invariably arises
of what concrete steps can be
taken to make the existing soc
iety free.
Tax mechanisms
Two useful mechanisms for
this purpose, deserving of
wider consideration and use,
are the tax credit and the tax
check-off.
The tax credit differs from a
tax deduction in that a tax cre
ditdirectly reduces the amount
of one's taxes rather than
merely being deducted from
one's taxable income: its virtue
is that it directly shifts expendi
ture from the government to
the voluntary, non-coercive
private sector.
The result is to reduce
bureaucratic waste and ineffi
ciency, to encourage pluralism
and diversity and to return to
people some sense of initiative
and control over their lives.
Poorly directed
However, in its most naive
form, a tax credit cannot di
rectly benefit those who are
very poor and hence pay little
or no taxes; such persons are
ultimately the greatest victims
of the social traumas and dislo
cations created by govern
ment.
Libertarian/Independent
gubernatorial candidate Ed
Clark proposed an ingenious
solution to this problem during
his recent campaign. Clark
suggested an educational tax
credit not only for parents pay
ing for their own children's
education but also for any per
son or corporation willing to
contribute to the education of
someone else's child.
The result would be an in
crease in the quality and diver
sity of education available to
poor and minority children, as
well as to the children of the
middle class.
Check-offs
The paradigmatic example of
the tax check-off, the existing
Presidential Election Campaign
Fund check-off, is a rather blat
ant attempt by the
Republican-Democratic party
to further secure its monopoly

on political expression in this
country. A similar mechanism
can, however, be used for
more beneficient purposes.
Government financing of
abortions is a case in point.
Opponents of abortion rightly
claim that freedom of consci
ence is violated by forcing
them against their will to pay
for abortions to which they are
morally opposed.
A tax check-off would allow
those opposed to abortion to
not have their tax monies used
for that purpose. In order that
such a check-off not be viewed
as simply an accounting ar
tifice, it is essential that those
who decline the check-off have
refunded to them personally
the full amount of the check
off.
Neither the tax credit nor the
check-off is a panacea for the
stagnation, discontent and
alienation which government
has brought to society. They
are, however, first steps to
ward the type of bold and in
novative thinking which is
needed if government is to be
restrained to its proper role
and if people are to regain con
trol over their own lives.

urity, etc. — that government
has failed.
That should not be surpris
ing: we were asking it to do
things beyond its capabilities.
The political order of society
is distinguished from the other
facets of social existence
(economic, religious and so
on) b its ultimate reliance on
the sancti n of physical force:
government is the social in
stitution which possesses an
effective monopoly in a given
territory on the control of the
use of force.
Stems from gun
In the final analysis, as the
late Chinese leader Mao Tse
tung said, political power
grows out of the barrel of a
gun.
Every society requires some
sort of political order (though
not necessarily government as
conventionally envisaged —
consider the system of jural
anarchy of libertarian scholar
Murray Rothbard and others)
to ensure that disagreements
and conflicts are contained
short of civil war.
However, force — physical
violence — is constructive only
when it is restricted solely to
the defensive role of prevent
ing and punishing the unpro
voked initiation of force by ag
gressive individuals or groups.
To believe that forceful
coercion can aid the normal
constructive activities of social
cooperation, benevolence and
economic production is to
misperceive the nature of so
cial existence gravely.
Disruptions
When the political order
oversteps its natural limits and
interferes with the peacefully
functioning realm of private
society, the inevitable result is
the disruption of social coop
eration, the relative decline of
material well-being and the in
stigation of class conflict.
These elementary facts are
becoming increasingly obvi
ous even to the less reflective
members of our society.
While most Americans

realize that government has far
overstepped its moral and
practical limits, government's
intervention in contemporary
society is so pervasive that few
Americans can perceive a
method of untangling the cur
rent mess.
When libertarians demand
that government be restricted
to solely defensive activities,
the question invariably arises
of what concrete steps can be
taken to make the existing soc
iety free.
Tax mechanisms
Two useful mechanisms for
this purpose, deserving of
wider consideration and use,
are the tax credit and the tax
check-off.
The tax credit differs from a
tax deduction in that a tax cre
ditdirectly reduces the amount
of one's taxes rather than
merely being deducted from
one's taxable income: its virtue
is that it directly shifts expendi
ture from the government to
the voluntary, non-coercive
private sector.
The result is to reduce
bureaucratic waste and ineffi
ciency, to encourage pluralism
and diversity and to return to
people some sense of initiative
and control over their lives.
Poorly directed
However, in its most naive
form, a tax credit cannot di
rectly benefit those who are
very poor and hence pay little
or no taxes; such persons are
ultimately the greatest victims
of the social traumas and dislo
cations created by govern
ment.
Libertarian/Independent
gubernatorial candidate Ed
Clark proposed an ingenious
solution to this problem during
his recent campaign. Clark
suggested an educational tax
credit not only for parents pay
ing for their own children's
education but also for any per
son or corporation willing to
contribute to the education of
someone else's child.
The result would be an in
crease in the quality and diver
sity of education available to
poor and minority children, as
well as to the children of the
middle class.
Check-offs
The paradigmatic example of
the tax check-off, the existing
Presidential Election Campaign
Fund check-off, is a rather blat
ant attempt by the
Republican-Democratic party
to further secure its monopoly

on political expression in this
country. A similar mechanism
can, however, be used for
more beneficient purposes.
Government financing of
abortions is a case in point.
Opponents of abortion rightly
claim that freedom of consci
ence is violated by forcing
them against their will to pay
for abortions to which they are
morally opposed.
A tax check-off would allow
those opposed to abortion to
not have their tax monies used
for that purpose. In order that
such a check-off not be viewed
as simply an accounting ar
tifice, it is essential that those
who decline the check-off have
refunded to them personally
the full amount of the check
off.
Neither the tax credit nor the
check-off is a panacea for the
stagnation, discontent and
alienation which government
has brought to society. They
are, however, first steps to
ward the type of bold and in
novative thinking which is
needed if government is to be
restrained to its proper role
and if people are to regain con
trol over their own lives.

Someone once suggested
that the only things the gov
ernment does well are making
war and inflating the money
supply: after Vietnam, one
may wish to exclude "making
war" from the maxim.
It is increasingly obvious —
in the wake of Vietnam, Water
gate, Proposition 13, thefailure
of the Great Society, the immi
nent bankruptcy of Social Sec
urity, etc. — that government
has failed.
