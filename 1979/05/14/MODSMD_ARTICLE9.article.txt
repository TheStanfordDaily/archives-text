Shut hecklers up
On Saturday, I went to a de
bate about Rep. Pete McClos
key's National Service Bill.
The debate was great; both
sides were sharp, and I learned
a lot about the issues and feel
ings involved. The only thing
that detracted from the event
was the rudeness of some of
the audience.
For some reason, sup
posedly mature college stu
dents think that the way to
support a cause is to wildly
applaud anyone speaking for it
and just as wildly boo anyone
speaking against it.
Where did these people
learn their manners? I was
taught respect for another's
freedom to speak in first grade.
It's good to see people break
out of their apathy and get ex
cited about a cause.
It's a shame to see a good
debate spoiled and demeaned
by immature hecklers.
Next time someone next to
you starts heckling a public

speaker, tell him to shut up, no
matter which side you're on. I
did.

Plight unjustified
|on Reider's column (Daily,
May 7) contains a factual rep
resentation of the human
rights attitudes in several Mid
dle Eastern countries. His
comparison, though, of civil
rights in the area, is unwar
ranted if not malicious.
The existence of Israel and
the plight of the Palestinians
cannot be justified by compar
ing the internal situation in Is
rael to that in Arab countries.
They are in fact irrelevant.
If Reider's contention were
to be accepted, then forceful
usurpation of land and subju
gation of other people can be
rationalized if the aggressor
claimed that the act would re
sult in the betterment of the
victim.

Such an ideology would give
Israel's de facto claims to oc
cupied lands the much
coveted de jure status. I doubt
if the Palestinians, the Arabs or
the rest of the world would be
agreeable.

Noblesse oblige
Last Saturday night the Delta
Upsilon fraternity invited
select young men attending its
bid party to take a ride in a
Cadillac limousine. After a few
miles and a few more beers the
young men would emerge
from the limo and saunter back
to the party, proud recipients
of bids to join DU.

Brothers blazers are all part of
the freedom of individuals to
do as they please. But Saturday
night I witnessed the rank
elitism that I hoped would
never infect Stanford â€” the

vulgar ostentation of fraternity
men in a Cadillac limousine.
In six years at Stanford I have
met many persons of wealth
and influence. Some I will re
member always for their self
ishness, some for their self
lessness. I only wish that for
just a moment last Saturday
night the fraternity men in that
Cadillac limousine could have
recalled the French maxim
noblesse oblige.

Therapy lacking
Postscript to John Felstiner's
letter on the Karel deLeeuw
murder verdict (Daily, May 10):
I find it even more galling to
find that Theodore Streleski,
deLeeuw's convicted mur
derer, will not receive any
psychiatric care during his stay
in prison. That means when
Streleski is released, he could
be free to lash out at some

other human being when he
refuses to take responsibility
for his own failings.
It may be easy to deduce that
Streleski's self-therapy in mur
dering deLeeuw would render
him safe in society. That is, he
got all his "frustrations" out in
the open, so he's "cool" now,
but this kind of acting out
shouldn't have gotten him
anywhere.
DeLeeuw's death was not
only a loss to the Stanford
academia, but also to the East
Palo Alto community. De
Leeuw had worked to upgrade
the education of black and
poor children in the area.
DeLeeuw is gone, but I hope
that his work and ideas will de
finitely go on.
