Underlit street
I frequently commute to and
from campus at night, either by
bike or by car. Due in part to
my own increasing awareness
of the problem of rape on
campus, I am concerned about
the present poor lighting along
Serra Street from Campus
Drive to El Camino Real, in
cluding the bike path which
runs beside it (past the Univer
sity Food Services Office).
Lighting there is not simply
poor; it is virtually non
existent. This seems to me to
pose several potential hazards
for all who use either the bike
path or Serra Street at night.
First, as I have noted, the
area is potentially a rapist's
paradise: no lighting, lots of
brushy area nearby, few
people around. Â»
Another problem: bikers
traveling in both directions use
the path, as well as occasional
pedestrians or joggers. I have
frequently come close to col
liding with someone I had not
noticed in the darkness.
Driving along that portion of
Serra Street is a problem,
especially to unfamiliar
motorists. The road is unlit and
poorly marked, even though it
makes several turns.
In short: I am glad, yet at the
same time surprised, that I

have not heard of any serious
accidents or assaults along this
road or the adjoining bike
path. The potential hazards
appear to me to be great. I'm
sure that others have regis
tered complaints about this
situation, and I hope that the
problem will be remedied
soon.

Gayness is sinful
As a student of the Bible and
its application to everyday
Christian living, I want to re
spond to the letter from Sle
pian, et al. regarding "Cay
Awareness Week" (Daily, May
7).
One of the questions raised
in that letter was, "What does it
mean to be gay and Christian?"
From a biblical viewpoint, no
Christian who claims to love
God would ever participate in
any homosexual activity. In the
Book of Romans and
elsewhere, homosexuality is
specifically set forth as con
trary to Cod's will for decent
human behavior.
The current practice of or
daining homosexuals is a dis
grace to Cod and the denomi
nations which are involved.
Any Christian associated with a

denomination which condones
homosexual behavior should
quit and join a different one.
Cod did not create Adam
and Frank and put them in the
garden of Eden. God made
man and woman to enjoy sex as
husband and wife.
The Masters and Johnson
report, which was referred to
in the letter, revealed that all
homosexuality is learned be
havior. It is not something
peopleare born with. Since itis
a learned behavior pattern, it
can be unlearned.
Homosexuals are not trap
ped into a life of fear and con
fusion. They can unlearn their
wrong behavior and learn how
to enjoy a healthy heterosexual
relationship with their spouse
the way God intended.
Homosexuality is completely
contrary to God's word and no
one practicing it is being a
good Christian. Christianity
and homosexuality do not mix
and never will.
I would love to help anyone
who has been deceived into
being a homosexual but would
like to get out of it. Most
homosexuals are full of fear
and depression because the
lives they lead are contrary to
the way Cod set things up.
Cod's Word can help any
homosexual who wants to be
truly free to enjoy sex as Cod

made it.
Sex was Cod's idea in the
beginning and He never
wanted to see homosexuality. I
pray this is the last "Cay
Awareness Week" that will
ever be held on the Stanford
campus.

Frats and freedom
It's amazing how much
energy is being wasted at this
school analyzing the costs and
benefits of the fraternity sys
tem. The alleged costs have
been overblown. The most
"rude" of Stanford's frater
nities would be considered a
collection of overly polite pre
ppy sissies at Dartmouth Col
lege.
The benefits, in contrast, are
substantial. As at Dartmouth,
the students at Stanford have
only a few years left before
they must completely conform
to the highly restrictive be
havior that society requires of
its leaders.
Undergraduate life is the last
chance for young Americans to
experiment with social norms.
It would be a great disservice to
eliminate their final opportun
ity for social freedom.
