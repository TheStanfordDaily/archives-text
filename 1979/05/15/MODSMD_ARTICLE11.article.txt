# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Baker and Sifuentes Boycott produce to support UFW 
### 
The United Farm Workers
have been negotiating with 28
lettuce growers in California
and Arizona since November
1978. Their contracts expired
this January. After a 15-day ex
tension, growers offered a
take-it-or-leave-it 7 percent in
crease in wages and benefits.
On January 19, workers struck.
By the end of the month, 4500
workers were striking. But
what does this have to do with
you, the consumer?
All consumers benefit from
the UFW. Before the UFW
existed, growers sprayed crops
as much as they pleased. Now,
harmful pesticide use is li
mited.
Perhaps you think UFW
goals are excessive. Nothing
could be further from the
truth. Farm workers became
organized only in this decade,
so past struggles have been for
recognition.
Today, for the first time,
workers are bargaining for
economic gains. Con
sequently, farm workers are 30
to 40 years behind industrial
workers in wages and benefits.
Proposed hike
The UFW proposed a wage
increase from the current $3.70
per hour to $5.25. They also
proposed additional health
benefits. Presently, farm
workers receive 15 cents per
hour in health benefits while
the average in California is 81.2
cents. Farm workers also re
ceive less than 5 cents per hour
for pensions, while the na
tional average is between 80
cents and $1.
Growers argue that they are
following President Jimmy Car
ter's wage and price guidelines

by offering 7 percent in
creases. These guidelines,
however, do not apply to
workers who earn less than $4
per hour or to producers of
unprocessed foods.
Ironically, in the last year,
lettuce prices in the Imperial
Valley (where workers are
striking) increased from $3.82
per box to $8 per box â€” a 110
percent price increase. Last
year, growers in the Salinas
Valley cleared $71 million on
sales of $201 million for a rate
of return of 55 percent.
Balked
When the UFW agreed to
abide by the 7 percent
guidelines if only the growers
would accept the guidelines as
well, growers balked. The Ag
ricultural Labor Relations
Board has cited the growers for
negotiating in bad faith.
Can the growers truly expect
the poorest workers to lead the
nation in fighting inflation
when they themselves show no
restraint? A 7 percent increase
in wages and benefits would
actually lead to a real loss since
inflation is currently at 13 per
cent a year.
Some point out that a few let
tuce cutters can earn $6 to $8
per hour during the harvest
season. However, these work
ers are able to do this back
breaking labor for five to six
years,at most, and they must
support their families
throughout the year, not just
during the harvest.
Others argue that piecework

rates have increased from 32
cents per box in 1970 to 57
cents in 1978, but after adjust
ing for inflation, the real wage
has actually declined 6.4 cents
per box in this period.
..Finally, whether lettuce sells
for 59 cents or 89 cents per
head, only 2.4 cents go to the
farm workers.
During Cesar Chavez' pre
sentation here May 3, six pages
of pro-grower information was
distributed. To put it politely,
one can only say that growers
are misinformed. They argue
that average household in
come in 1977 was $7019; they
can be proved wrong by any
one wishing to check Paul
Samuelson's Tenth Edition of
Economics, which verifies that
in 1973 alone average family in
come was $13,622.
Much higher
Moreover, as of March 1978,
the U.S. Bureau of the Census
reported average family in
come of $18,264. Growers
themselves confirm the plight
of the farm worker by docu
menting that under the im
proved conditions proposed
by the UFW, and given availa
ble work, a worker could con
ceivably earn $7019.
The growers neglect to men
tion that in 1977 the poverty
level for a family of four was
$6195 and for a family of five
that level was $7329.
Perhaps you wonder if you
can help the farm workers. You
can do much to help. First, join
the national consumer boycott

against Chiquita bananas. Buy
only bananas with other labels
such as Dole or Del Monte.
Chief target
Why boycott Chiquita? Be
cause Chiquita bananas are
grown by United Brands Com
pany, which owns Sun Harvest,
Inc., the nation's largest let
tuce grower and the UFW's
chief target.
Pressure from such a boycott
would affect a large profit
making operation and bring
Sun Harvest and other growers
to bargain in good faith.
Boycott iceberg lettuce, too.
Ask managers of food service,
grocery stores and restaurants
to stop serving these products.
If they say they buy union pro
ducts, check several boxes for
union labels. If you wish to do
more, come to a UFW Support
Committee meeting.
Vou may not think your ac
tion matters, but it does. A 1975
Harris poll found that 17 mill
ion people boycotted grapes,
19 million boycotted lettuce,
and 11 million boycotted Callo
wines in support of previous
UFW efforts. The farm workers
are asking for decent wages for
hard work that puts food on
your tables; with your help
they can realize their goals.
