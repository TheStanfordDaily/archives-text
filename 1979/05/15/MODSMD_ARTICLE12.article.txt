## Morally necessary to divest 
### 
Too long have I remained si
lent;
Too long have our rulers kept
the truth from us;
Too long, but no longer.
â€”Joshua McKinna
Whether Stanford should di
vest its stock from South Afri
can interests is primarily an
ethical question dependent
upon one's relative values of
social progress and income
foregone.
It is clear that the adminis
trators of this University, as
well as the managements of the
crucial corporations, have
been willing to give nothing
more than lip-service to the
plight of the black majority in
South Africa.
The reasons for withdrawal
of corporate interests from
South Africa as well as for di
vestment of our stocks are very
concrete and honest. Yet it is
necessary to dispel many mis
conceptions raised by such
people as Harry Mairson
(Daily, May 8).
The argument for withdrawal
comes down to this: Signific
ant change will only occur if
the white South African rulers
feel that their nation's
economy is threatened.
A former member of the
South African parliament has
written that "a real threat to the
material interests of the whites
with the ending of American
trade and investment would
make them responsive to black
demands for negotiated
change. The South African
government could not ignore
organized large-scale
economic pressures from the
outside world."
Mairson naive
Mairson brings his naive
logic to the subject of divest
ment. He poses the question,
"To whom should the Univer
sity sell its interests?"
The act of divestment, is not,
as he insinuates, a feeble at
tempt to "wash one's hands of
the issue." Instead, divestment
is the means by which Stanford
can demonstrate strong disag
reement with corporate policy
to the stock-buying public.
Therefore, divestment is a
concrete strategy on the part of
many investors to drive the
value of a stock down collec
tively, simultaneously generat
ing public indignation against a
product-selling business wor
ried about its image.
Proxies useless
Furthermore, divestment is
clearly superior to the worth
less value of remaining a stoc
kholder. Proxy votes at stoc
kholder conventions have not
come close to challenging the
management's South African
policies. I assure Mairson that

the present managements are
not moved by stockholders'
votes on this issue.
The question at Stanford is
whether such socially respon
sible actions as divestment are
worth the trouble. The actions
of the trustees over the years
have always been resistant to
social progress.
I cannot comprehend how
the trustees voted again this
year against stock policies
curbing infant formula abuses
in third world countries.
Cost precludes action
It's clear that the rich execu
tives of this University's estate
will not be willing to act mor
ally if any financial cost is in
volved.
As University Vice President
for Public Affairs Robert
Posenzweig told me, "The
government of the United
States has a foreign policy. I
think it's crazy for Stanford
University to have a foreign
policy."
Furthermore, this University
mistakenly believes that a
penny stolen is a penny
earned. The income derived
from South African invest
ments is unambiguously being
extracted from slave labor. Our
trustees, however, continue to
cling to concepts linking large
corporations to capitalism to
free economic growth to free

dom.
Therefore, I strongly disag
ree with Mairson's "give up
and lay down" attitude regard
ing our investments.
ASSU afraid
Although I agree with his
emphasis on Stanford as a
major university generating
public interest, it is also true
that right here at Stanford both
the ASSU Senate and the ad
ministration have been afraid
to exercise their stockholders'
rights.
Despite a student body vote
in favor of divestment this fall,
the ASSU Senate has ignored
its mandate to divest.
Meanwhile, major adminis
trators across the country
(Stanford, Harvard, etc.) are at
tempting to look concerned
about justice in South Africa.
Nobody can deny, however,
that this University would not
have even looked at most of
these proxy votes twice if not
for massive student outcries.
I challenge the Stanford ad
ministration to begin running
this University like a con
cerned and erudite location of
wisdom and less like a fast
food restaurant for education.
