Two Soviet dissidents ap
pealed in Kresge Auditorium
Thursday night for help in
fighting for the "fundamental
human rights" of the citizens
of the Soviet Union.
Prof. Vladislaw Krasnov, 42,
of the Monterey Institute of
Foreign Studies, and Andrei
Amalrik, 41, a visiting fellow at
Hoover Institute, spoke of
human rights as a moral issue,
not as a political one. How
ever, they said American citi
zens have the freedom to put
pressure on their government
to see that the Human Rights
Declaration adopted by the
United Nations in 1948 is up
held.
"As it is now," Krasnov said,
"the basic right to life, liberty,
the pursuit of happiness and
the right to have an opinion are
either totally denied or seri
ously violated for all citizens of
the U.S.S.R."
Krasnov went on to say that
the rights of thought, consci
ence and religion proclaimed
in the declaration are inter
preted by the Soviet govern
ment as "an exercise in Marxist
thought, Soviet conscience
and atheist religion."
Far-reaching
Krasnov said U.S. citizens
should be concerned with
human rightsin Russiabecause
of the far-reaching effects of
the Soviet "global strategy to

conspire against human rights.
"The Soviets are on the of
fensive against the world," he
said. "In the suppression of
human rights, they are guided
by a single ideology which they
claim is the only way for the
world."
Support of the human rights
movement in the Soviet Union
is an incentive to strive for
world peace through a balance
of power, he said.
Amalrik cited similar reasons
for U.S. support of human
rights. Aside from the moral
reasons, he stressed the im
portance of world security.
"As long as the problems of
war and peace for the U.S.S.R.
are in the hands of five or six
men," Amalrik said, "then the
United States cannot rest at
peace."
Both speakers told how U.S.
citizens can help the human
rights movement. They stres
sed communication with gov
ernment officials and the for
mation of a human rights
group on campus to increase
student awareness.
In addition, the United
States has the power to be firm
with the Soviet Union through
such means as international
trade and the swapping of
Soviet dissidents for Russian
spies.

"The U.S.S.R. is sensitive to
the U.S. government," Amalrik
said. "This government is
stronger than it thinks."
Amalrik also said that indi
viduals can help by personally
contacting dissidents to find
out how to aid individuals in
the Soviet Union.
"The worst enemy
everywhere is apathy," Kras
nov agreed. "If every group
would do as much for their
people in Russia as the Jewsare
doing for theirs, there would
be no human rights problem to
speak of."
The dissidents emphasized
the importance of gradual
change in Soviet society. "We
cannot have the same level of
freedom as the U.S. in the
U.S.S.R. overnight; that would
cause terrible chaos. There
must be some retention of
Soviet social structures,"
Amalrik said.
Change moral climate
"The basis of the Soviet sys
tem is the negation of human
rights," he continued. "But it is
possible to change that system
step by step. The first step must
be the change in the moral cli
mate of the country."
Amalrik spoke here once be
fore on Jan. 13, 1977, shortly
after his emigration from Rus
sia. From 1962 to 1963, he was a

student of history at Moscow
State University. He was expel
led for writing what was con
demned as being a "non-
Marxist" seminar paper. He
was arrested three times for his
human rights activity.
In 1965 Amalrik was exiled to
Siberia for 16 months; in 1970
he was imprisoned for more
than 18 months in a forced
labor camp, and he was exiled
again for another 16 months in
1973.
He was forced to emigrate in
1976, after which he received
the Human Rights Award.
Krasnov, born in Russia in
1937, received his degree in an
thropology and history at Mos
cow University in 1960. From
1960 to 1962 he was an editor of
foreign broadcasts in Moscow.
He was sent abroad as a part of
his job, and in 1962 he took ad
vantage of the chance to defect
to Sweden.
"I left because I was seeking
freedom," Krasnov said. "I am
not an escapist; I wanted to
find out the weaknesses of the
West."
Krasnov came to the United
States in 1965. He received his
Ph.D. in Russian literature at
the University of Washington
in 1974. He now teaches Rus
sian studies at the Monterey
Institute of Foreign Studies.
