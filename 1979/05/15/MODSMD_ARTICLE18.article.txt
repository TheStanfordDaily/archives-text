# Now it's December
## Library annex opening delayed 
### Gayle Mayers 
Completion of the Green
Library addition has again been
delayed until December be
cause of difficulties in getting
unique shelving designed to
withstand earthquakes.
Philip Leighton, building
projects manager for Univer
sity Libraries, said the shelving,
which will be cantilevered off
the floor, is designed to resist
iateral and horizontal force in
the event of an earthquake.
None of the other libraries has
this type of shelving.
When the shelving was or
dered, engineers were an
ticipating new building codes
which have become more con
servative over the years as en
gineers learn more about
seismology, Leighton said.
However, the stricter codes
never materialized.
The specially designed shelv

ing did not cost much more
than regular styles, Leighton
said, because when the con
tract was signed the manufac
turer did not foresee any en
gineering problems in con
struction. However, problems
have arisen and as a result, the
contract has not been fulfilled,
he added.
Meanwhile, all non-shelving
work is expected to be com
pleted by mid-May, at which
time the installation of carpets
and furniture will begin.
Construction of the Green
Library addition began in Feb
ruary 1977. It was originally
scheduled to be completed last
January, a date which was later
extended to April, then to Sep
tember and now to December.
Leighton said the University
does have the option of paying
an additional $50,000 and hav
ing the shelving completed as

early as October. The Univer
sity is still exploring this possi
bility but Leighton said he
thought it unlikely that such a
plan would be adopted.
If construction is completed
by December, the Green Lib
rary addition would be open to
students at the beginning of
winter quarter, 1980, Leighton
said.
Construction of the annex is
costing roughly $9.5 million.
Funds are being provided by
Cecil Green and other donors,
Leighton said.
The addition will be a
graduate research library for
the humanities and social sci
ences and will house approxi
mately one million volumes.
Plans are currently being made
to renovate the older building,
Green Library West, but
Leighton said that specific
drawings have not yet been
made.
