# Court decision curtails USE power to discipline members
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
United Stanford Employees (USE) may no longer
threaten with dismissal University employees in certain
job classifications who refuse to join the union under its
collective bargaining agreement, a recent decision by
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed.
The April 26 decision effectively removes any remain
ing distinction between a union shop and an agency
shop, curtailing the power of unions nationwide to take
disciplinary action against members.
According to the National Labor Relations Act of 1947,
a union shop requires full membership of all its
employees, while an agency shop allows the option of
payingan agency fee for services provided by the union.
While a full-fledged union member would be subject
to union-imposed disciplinary measures enforceable in
state courts, the decision allows an employee in any
shop to choose the agency option and remain free of
such action.
|im Wolpman, attorney for USE, explained that the
decision stemmed from recent litigation in other parts of
the country over "right-to-work" legislation which asks
that individual employees be allowed to choose full
membership or pay an agency fee without facing discip
linary action by their union.
Membership requirement
USE's litigation began in 1975, after their first agree
ment with the University was reached.
According to the court opinion, a letter from the
union was distributed to new bargaining unit members
informing them that they "are required to join (the un
ion) on or before the end of (their) trial period."
The section titled Union Security of USE's agreement
with the LJniversity states that all workers hired after the
effective date of the agreement "shall, as a condition of
employment, on or before the completion of the trial
period acquire and maintain membership in the Union
in good standing."
loining USE requires filling out a membership card

and taking an oath of allegiance to the union in addition
to paying the membership fee.
USE took action in 1975 against three employees, seek
ing enforcement of their alleged obligation to become
full-fledged union members. The employees contested
the action and the case went to arbitration.
Unfair practices charged
Thearbitratorfound in favorof USE, at which point the
employees asked the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) in Oakland to review the matter. That board
found in favor of the employees, charging USE with
unfair labor practices.
USE took the question to an NLRB administrative
judge, who affirmed that USE had indeed engaged in
unfair labor practices.
Arguments centered around one subsection of the
National Labor Relations Act which states that
employees have the right to refrain from joining a labor
union, "ecxcept to the extent that such right may be
affected by an agreement requiring membership in a
labor organization as a condition of employment."
The case ended up before the National Labor Rela
tions Board in Washington, where the board found
against USE. The union appealed to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals, which rendered this decision.
Supreme Court appeal?
USE is presently considering whether to file an appeal
with the Supreme Court. However, David Novogrodsky,
USE general manager, said he felt the case would not be
reviewed given an earlier case involving General Motors
in 1963.
In that case, the high court decided that union mem
bership was "whittled down to its financial core."
According to Novogrodsky, the courts have taken it
upon themselves to interpret what constitutes union
membership.
Wolpman said, "The courts have decided that mem
bership is restricted to its financial core, which means
there is no difference between an agency shop and a
union shop."
