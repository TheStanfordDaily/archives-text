## theater/marilyn rosenberg Black Arts superb, material forgettable 
### 
In their production of Don't Bother Me, I
+ Can't Cope last week at the Burgess Theatre,
* Stanford's Black Performing Arts proved they
« can do almost anything.
* They can sing. Although the quality of all
* the solo voices matched, if not exceeded,
*. those of any campus production, certain
* standouts demand special mention. Mark
* Floyd's gorgeous tenor voice was well com
* plemented by his compelling presence.
* Janice Marie O'Neil, in the role of Salome,
* gave a rich and moving rendition of "So Little
* Time." O'Neil and Floyd were surrounded by
a cast of talented soloists and chorus mem
bers. Numbers like "They Keep Coming,"
. "Good Vibrations" and "Time Brings About a
Change" showed off their tremendous vocal
+ power. Harmonies, especially in "Fighting
+ for Pharaoh," were also well done.
They can dance. The choreography, by Les
* Williams, Stanford's tap and Black American
* dance instructor (with a law degree), and
* Rodney Johnson, a recent graduate, famous
* for his Lagunita jazz classes, was excellent.
* Perhaps not as challenging as it might have
+ been, it nevertheless differed from flashy,
+ commercial, Chorus Line jazz in being au
+ thentically black. Among the few exceptions
* to this were Trina Williams' astounding ac
* robatics, which deserve more than a word of
* praise.
For the most part, however, Black Ameri
can dances, such as the jitterbug, the charles
ton, the hustle, the bump and various kinds
+ of jazz walks, were featured. Two of the most
M striking dance numbers were the "Flistory of
+ Dance," a collage of dances from different

periods, and "All I Need," a dynamic jazz
piece. Precise execution and details such as
pointed toes were sometimes omitted in
favor of individual interpretations, an aspect
which may not be an oversight, but rather a
stylistic choice made by the choreographers,
given the nature of the show.
They can act. Although the opening
number, "I Gotta Keep Movin' " was per
formed without a hint of enthusiasm or
energy, the rest of the show was done both
skillfully and wholeheartedly. Largely re
sponsible for maintaining the show's energy
was Phyllis Simon, whose brassy stage pre
sence, vivacity and poise gave one the im
pression that she could have done the whole
show by herself. The ensemble, as well, dis
played tremendous energy. Perhaps because
of Anthony Haney's original direction, the
group, unlike many professional ensembles,
was interesting to watch. But ....
They can't make Don't Bother Me, I Can't
Cope a good show. FHaving no plot, the revue
depends entirely on its music, which is
adequate, but not memorable. The message
is neither. Beginning, quite powerfully, with
the theme of black rights, the show deterior
ates into a gripe session about everything
from high school soldiers, to a world in which
we have to ask computers who to love.
Given a cast that can sing, dance, act and
get standing ovations for a show like Don't
Bother Me, I Can't Cope, it seems that Black
Performing Arts could work miracles with
shows UkeAin 't Misbehavin', The Wiz and For
Colored Girls. Why didn't they; why don't
they?
