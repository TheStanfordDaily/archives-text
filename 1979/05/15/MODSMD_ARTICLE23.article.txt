## Get ready kiddies, 'Splendor' is on the way 
### 
Most people think of Man
zanita Park as a barracks for so
cial zombies who, after a few
months of isolation, lose their
ability and interest in com
municating with their fellow
students. Trailer residents
supposedly never party and
detest social interaction with
anyone outside their
aluminum-sided mobile
homes.
But for the last few years, a
core of trailer dissidents has
been proving this wrong. They
are the organizers of Splendor
on the Crass, the biggest and
best party on the Stanford
campus.
Splendor can be described
with a few words rarely as
sociated with large campus af
fairs: professional music, stu
dent participation, diversity
and class.
And the best thing about it is
that there is no hidden motive.
Splendor is just fun. No one is
going to con you into going
Greek or sign you up for Cam
pus Crusade. Come, enjoy the
music, drink the beer and
spend an afternoon acting like
a normal college student.

This year Splendor (to be
held on Saturday, May 19 on
the trailer lawn) will feature
four professional bands. In
cluded is Eddie McGee, former
lead singer for Tower of Power
who, word has it, was the best
of the band.
Others are Couchois, an
up-and-coming (hence expen
sive) Warner Bros, band, Al
Stahaley, rock and roller for
merly of Spirit, and Solar
Plexis, a hot new jazz sextet.
Twelve of the 17 acts are
student-run. The cream of the
student crop includes Michael
Green, a South American Bob
Dylan, and Guy Nohra, the
Lebanese Jackson Browne.
Also appearing are the Men
dicants (recently returning
from dazzling audiences at or.
rival institutions Back East), the
LSJUMB and a female singing
group, Counterpoint.
Funding for Splendor was
somewhat of a problem. As
production manager john
Doane said, "We were in hot
water. Financial support from
the rest of the campus was not
as strong as we had hoped it
would be."

It seems that despite the lack
of campus enthusiasm, some
one knew that Splendor was
going to be great. Pat Cohen
got Budweiser to donate $2000
to the cause. There will be 65
kegs of beer, free to anyone
with a Stanford ID.

Splendor will also feature
arts and crafts displays, mod
ern dance and a local juggler.
The coordinator of Splen
dor, senior Peter McCaw, was
deeply committed to last year's
event. John Harris, director of

Special Events for next year, is
also involved with the produc
tion.
Splendor is coming. Put
away your books, get out your
frisbee, and come out fora free
day on the green.
