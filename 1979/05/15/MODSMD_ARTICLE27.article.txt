# VIP program deters theft
## 
### Kathy Sheil 
In an effort to reduce the
amount of theft on campus and
to assist in the recovery, iden
tification and return of stolen
property, the Dept. of Public
Safety here has a Valuables
Identification Program (VIP).
According to Detective Carl
Gielitz who heads the VIP
program, engraving tools are
available to members ot the
University community to en
grave their driver's license
number on such valuables as
stereos, radios, cameras and
bicycles.
Gielitz, emphasizing the
need for identification num

bers, said that this year 61 per
cent of all reported crime on
campus involved some kind of
theft, with bicycle thefts alone
amounting to nearly $50,000.
On-campus students in
terested in the program should
get in touch with their dorm or
house office, he said. Students
living off-campus and non
student campus residents can
borrow engravers from the
Dept. of Public Safety after
showing proper identification.
The engravers are "fairly easy
to use," Gielitz said. "It's just
like using a pencil."
The engraving should be

done in a prominent place
which can be easily observed
without taking the object
apart, he advised.
For those without a driver's
license, Cielitz recommended
obtaining a state ID card.
Serial numbers alone are in
sufficient, he said.
Gielitz also recommended
that people keep records of
what items are marked, where
they are marked and other
items like sales slips that could
help in identifying valuables.
"Thieves thrive on stolen
property that cannot be iden
tified," he said.
