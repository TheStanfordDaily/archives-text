# Belgian students to study here
## 
### Susan Owen 
This summer 40 French-speaking
students from Belgium will be com
ing to Palo Alto in order to meet
some "real Americans," study the
English language and see "some
Steinbeck country," according to
Fernande Inan, a French teacher at
Cubberley High School.
The students,aged 14 to 20, will be
arriving from Brussels on June 28 and
will spend four weeks traveling and
taking classes at a local high school
on topics of their own suggestion,
including the role of women in
American society and the American
family, Inan said.
Many of the students expressed "a
lot of interest" in visiting places like
Monterey and Cannery Row, she
said.
"Somehow they have all studied
Steinbeck and have been intrigued
with his descriptions of the Salinas
Valley," said Inan.
The Pacific American Institute
(PAI), sponsor of the program, will
try to place each student (who has
had at least two years of English) in a
separate Palo Alto family.
"We hope to find families who are
really open to a foreign experience,
to making a new friend and helping
with the transition into American cul
ture," Inan said.
PAI, which has centers in Tokyo,
Paris, Madrid, London, Brussels and
Mexico City, places students accord
ing to their study preferences, said
Inan. Many Japanese students prefer
being placed in agricultural centers
such as Manteca in the Fresno area,
she said, but others find Palo Alto
very attractive.
Palo Alto is centrally located, said
Inan, close to San Francisco, but not
as intimidating as the big city. "Palo
Alto fits in with their idea of Ameri
can suburban life â€” homes, rather
than the apartment living they as
sociate with San Francisco."
Besides a field trip to Monterey,
said Inan, PAI has also scheduled
three field trips to Muir Woods,
Great America and San Francisco
with a Bay cruise. They will also be
touring the Stanford campus on July
2.
If anyone knows of a family in
either Palo Alto or an adjoining area,
who might be interested in hosting a
student, please contact Inan in the
evenings within the next few weeks
at 321-3172.
