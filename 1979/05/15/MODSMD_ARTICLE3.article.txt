# Does not want morality responsibility
## Geiger lifts stadium bottle ban 
### Brad Crystal 
The prohibition against drinking alcoholic be
verages and carrying in bottles, cans or other small
containers at home football games was lifted yes
terday by Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
Saying that the policy has not been very popular,
Geiger explained, "It's not up to the athletic direc
tor to legislate morality." He said he is confident
the relaxed limitations will not lead to "unseemly"
behavior.
Although Geiger said, "We are not taking a
stand up or down regarding the consumption of
alcohol at football games," he added "we hope
people will come and enjoy the football games and
not spoil them for others."
The restrictions adopted last summer will still
apply to large containers such as "kegs, suitcases
and footlockers" for safety and courtesy reasons,
said Geiger.
When crowds are large, "space in the stadium is
limited enough by bodies," explained Geiger.
Geiger said that inspections at the gates will
cease. "We are appealing to the reasonableness of

the crowd in enforcing the large container restric
tion," he said. The policy will be publicized
through announcements to students and letters to
season ticket holders.
Geiger said the large container restriction is just
one aspect of the stadium's "elaborate" crowd
control set-up, necessitated by the great number
of fans. "The responsibility of hosting that many
people rests with the athletic department," he ad
ded.
'Hit the rookie'
The move to change the stadium drinking policy
began last lanuary when ASSU Senator |im Esser
man asked the newly appointed Geiger to recon
sider the prohibitions. Esserman "hit the rookie
when he was a rookie," according to Geiger.
After the senate passed a resolution to repeal
the prohibitions, the issue was taken up by the
Committee on Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation (CAPER), which last month gave the
resolution overwhelming approval.
In its arguments for repeal the senate stated that
drinking "does not seriously impair the safety and

comfort of fans within the stadium" and that the
Pacific Ten Conference has no official prohibition
of alcoholic beverages.
The resolution also stated that "Drinking is not
curtailed at tailgate parties before the game," that
"The University should have excellent reasons to
deny a right to drink, not merely adequate ones"
and that "A customer who is obviously under the
influence of alcohol, while within the stadium,
may be escorted from the stadium."
Ability to affect policy
Acting on the senate and CAPER's recommenda
tions Geiger decided to lift the ban, he said.
Esserman cited Geiger's action as an example of
student's ability to affect University policy. Esser
man praised the Athletic Department for its coop
eration in ending the prohibition and called upon
students to respond by observing the large con
tainer limitations.
"Equally as important as the winning of permis
sion for people to have alcohol in the stadium is
the idea that students can have an active role in
changing the University," said Esserman.
