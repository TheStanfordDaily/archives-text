PLO bombs Israeli resort
A terrorist bomb ripped apart a sidewalk
marketplace yesterday in the northern Israeli
resort town of Tiberias, killing two persons and
wounding 37. The latest attack threatened to
spark a new round of Israeli reprisal raids
which have left 80 Lebanese and Palestinians
dead since April 22.
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organi
zation claimed responsibility for the midafter
noon bombing that shattered the festive at
mosphere in the popular vacation town on the
Sea of Galilee. It was jammed with tourists who
had arrived for a holiday which began last
night.
The bomb exploded while presidents Elias
Sarkis of Lebanon and Hafez Assad of Syria
were meeting in Damascus, the Syrian capital,
about the recent Israeli raids against Lebanon
that began after four Israelis died in a Palesti
nian guerrilla raid on the northern Israeli coas
tal town of Nahariya on April 22.
The fatal bomb blast in Tiberias also coin
cided with a warning by Arafat that Israel
would start a war against Lebanon and Syria
now that the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty had
secured Israel's southern border.
U.S., China initial trade pact
Canton, China — Commerce Secretary
Juanita Kreps and Chinese Trade Minister Li
Qiang initialed a broad and complex trade ag
reement yesterday. One U.S. negotiator called
the pact "good, fair and hard-nosed."
The agreement, if signed and approved by
Congress, will open the way to full economic
relations between the nations after a 30-year
hiatus.
Commerce Department officials said they
would not submit the trade agreement to Con
gress until a pending textile agreement is
signed.
The agreement accords both nations most
favored nation tariff treatment, meaning both
will receive the lowest tariff offered by each.
Currently, tariffs on Chinese goods entering
the United States are on the average twice as
high as those on goods from other countries.

The agreement also provides equal customs
treatment, promotion of economic and trade
relations, multiple entry and exit visas and
conversion of currency.
Kreps said the pact would greatly increase
business contacts through trade exhibits and
other aids and would assist medium and
smaller-sized companies which have done
very little business with China.
Chile nixes extradition request
Santiago, Chile — The head of the Supreme
Court refused yesterday to grant the extradi
tion of three former Chilean secret police offi
cials whom the United States wants to try for
the 1976 murder in Washington of exiled Chi
lean socialist Orlando Letelier.
Gen. Juan Manuel Contreras, one of the
three accused in the United States of ordering
the assassination, said he was happy with the
"professional justice" of the ruling. He called
the entire proceedings "a very well mounted
show."
The United States' request was tor the ex
tradition of Contreras, former chief of the
police Jnit known as DINA, Col. Pedro Es
pinoza Bravo, former DINA chief of opera
tions, and Capt. Armando Fernandez Larios,
an agent at the time of Letelier's death in 1976.
Letelier had been imprisoned fora year after
the military overthrew Marxist president Sal
vador Allende on Sept. 11, 1973. Once freed,
he went into exile and became a leading oppo
nent of the regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
Letelier had served in Allende's cabinet.
Contreras was indicted in August by a
Washington grand jury for allegedly ordering
the killing of Letelier. Espinoza and Fernandez
also were indicted for murder. Five Cuban
exiles were indicted as well, four of them for
murder.
Michael Townley, an American who lived
many years in Chile and says he worked for the
DINA, has confessed to leading the murder
mission. He said it was done on orders passed
to him by Espinoza, the DINA chief of opera
tions, and that Fernandez Larios monitored
Letelier's movements in Washington before
the bomb was planted.

Energy chief unveils gas plan
Sacramento — State energy chief Richard
Maullin unveiled proposed regulations yes
terday that would require more California gas
stations to stay open weekends and allow them
to sell only 10 gallons per customer at that
time.
Maullin also told a meeting of station dealers
and oil company officials that he would try to
free up as much as 30 million gallons of gas in
state-managed emergency supplies this
month, about 3 percent of the state's use, and
again next month to help ease the fight for gas
at long lines during the gas shortage.
Under the proposed order, stations that
pumped more than 50,000 gallons of gas in
March would be required to stay open Satur
days if their gas motor fuel pump location
number was odd or on Sunday if that number
was even.
Asked by reporters if the state would call out
the National Guard if a large number of sta
tions refused to stay open, Maullin said, "In
the extreme, and that would be extreme, the
answer is yes."
But Maullin later said the questions about
the National Guard were "really a wrong em
phasis" and "a totally hypothetical, last
recourse type of measure which is not likely
nor required."
Radiation leaks in truck fire
Las Vegas, Nev. — About 10 persons were
exposed to low-level radiation yesterday
morning when a truck carrying nuclear medi
cal waste caught fire and burned at a nuclear
dump site about 110 miles northwest of here,
authorities said.
The maximum exposure that showed up on
monitoring badges was about 5 millirems, said
Dr. John Carr, the state health officer. By com
parison, he said, the average chest X-ray ex
poses a person to about 45 millirems.
"There were no injuries. There was no air
borne contamination," said Evelyn Arnold, a
spokesman at the Louisville, Ky. headquarters
of Nuclear Engineering Co. Inc., operator of
the dump site.

The incident occurred about 5:30 a.m. while
the truck was waiting to enter the dump site,
about 10 miles south of Beatty.
The town of about 500 persons is near the
eastern entrance to Death Valley National
Monument and lies several miles west of the
sprawling Nevada Test Site, the nation's only
underground nuclear test range.
House passes target budget
Washington — The House approved last
night a 1980 target budget that would cut Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's proposed federal deficit
by $7.5 billion.
By a 220-184 margin, the House accepted the
moderately austere budget proposal despite
opposition from many conservatives who fa
vored deeper spending cuts and liberals who
wanted more money for social programs.
The target budget, which must now be re
conciled with Senate budget recommenda
tions, calls for $529.9 billion in spending and a
$20.9 billion deficit in fiscal 1980, which starts
Oct. 1.
Stocks continue to slump
New York — Stocks of companies that could
benefit from gasoline shortages got most of
the action from traders yesterday whilethe rest
of the market continued to slump.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 5.54 to a three-month low of 825.02.
In the last five weeks the average has fallen
53.70 points.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled
22.45 million shares, down from 24.01 million
Friday and the lightest total since a 22.01
million-share day on Feb. 20.

U.S., China initial trade pact
Canton, China — Commerce Secretary
Juanita Kreps and Chinese Trade Minister Li
Qiang initialed a broad and complex trade ag
reement yesterday. One U.S. negotiator called
the pact "good, fair and hard-nosed."
The agreement, if signed and approved by
Congress, will open the way to full economic
relations between the nations after a 30-year
hiatus.
Commerce Department officials said they
would not submit the trade agreement to Con
gress until a pending textile agreement is
signed.
The agreement accords both nations most
favored nation tariff treatment, meaning both
will receive the lowest tariff offered by each.
Currently, tariffs on Chinese goods entering
the United States are on the average twice as
high as those on goods from other countries.

The agreement also provides equal customs
treatment, promotion of economic and trade
relations, multiple entry and exit visas and
conversion of currency.
Kreps said the pact would greatly increase
business contacts through trade exhibits and
other aids and would assist medium and
smaller-sized companies which have done
very little business with China.
Chile nixes extradition request
Santiago, Chile — The head of the Supreme
Court refused yesterday to grant the extradi
tion of three former Chilean secret police offi
cials whom the United States wants to try for
the 1976 murder in Washington of exiled Chi
lean socialist Orlando Letelier.
Gen. Juan Manuel Contreras, one of the
three accused in the United States of ordering
the assassination, said he was happy with the
"professional justice" of the ruling. He called
the entire proceedings "a very well mounted
show."
The United States' request was tor the ex
tradition of Contreras, former chief of the
police Jnit known as DINA, Col. Pedro Es
pinoza Bravo, former DINA chief of opera
tions, and Capt. Armando Fernandez Larios,
an agent at the time of Letelier's death in 1976.
Letelier had been imprisoned fora year after
the military overthrew Marxist president Sal
vador Allende on Sept. 11, 1973. Once freed,
he went into exile and became a leading oppo
nent of the regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
Letelier had served in Allende's cabinet.
Contreras was indicted in August by a
Washington grand jury for allegedly ordering
the killing of Letelier. Espinoza and Fernandez
also were indicted for murder. Five Cuban
exiles were indicted as well, four of them for
murder.
Michael Townley, an American who lived
many years in Chile and says he worked for the
DINA, has confessed to leading the murder
mission. He said it was done on orders passed
to him by Espinoza, the DINA chief of opera
tions, and that Fernandez Larios monitored
Letelier's movements in Washington before
the bomb was planted.

Energy chief unveils gas plan
Sacramento — State energy chief Richard
Maullin unveiled proposed regulations yes
terday that would require more California gas
stations to stay open weekends and allow them
to sell only 10 gallons per customer at that
time.
Maullin also told a meeting of station dealers
and oil company officials that he would try to
free up as much as 30 million gallons of gas in
state-managed emergency supplies this
month, about 3 percent of the state's use, and
again next month to help ease the fight for gas
at long lines during the gas shortage.
Under the proposed order, stations that
pumped more than 50,000 gallons of gas in
March would be required to stay open Satur
days if their gas motor fuel pump location
number was odd or on Sunday if that number
was even.
Asked by reporters if the state would call out
the National Guard if a large number of sta
tions refused to stay open, Maullin said, "In
the extreme, and that would be extreme, the
answer is yes."
But Maullin later said the questions about
the National Guard were "really a wrong em
phasis" and "a totally hypothetical, last
recourse type of measure which is not likely
nor required."
Radiation leaks in truck fire
Las Vegas, Nev. — About 10 persons were
exposed to low-level radiation yesterday
morning when a truck carrying nuclear medi
cal waste caught fire and burned at a nuclear
dump site about 110 miles northwest of here,
authorities said.
The maximum exposure that showed up on
monitoring badges was about 5 millirems, said
Dr. John Carr, the state health officer. By com
parison, he said, the average chest X-ray ex
poses a person to about 45 millirems.
"There were no injuries. There was no air
borne contamination," said Evelyn Arnold, a
spokesman at the Louisville, Ky. headquarters
of Nuclear Engineering Co. Inc., operator of
the dump site.

The incident occurred about 5:30 a.m. while
the truck was waiting to enter the dump site,
about 10 miles south of Beatty.
The town of about 500 persons is near the
eastern entrance to Death Valley National
Monument and lies several miles west of the
sprawling Nevada Test Site, the nation's only
underground nuclear test range.
House passes target budget
Washington — The House approved last
night a 1980 target budget that would cut Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's proposed federal deficit
by $7.5 billion.
By a 220-184 margin, the House accepted the
moderately austere budget proposal despite
opposition from many conservatives who fa
vored deeper spending cuts and liberals who
wanted more money for social programs.
The target budget, which must now be re
conciled with Senate budget recommenda
tions, calls for $529.9 billion in spending and a
$20.9 billion deficit in fiscal 1980, which starts
Oct. 1.

PLO bombs Israeli resort
A terrorist bomb ripped apart a sidewalk
marketplace yesterday in the northern Israeli
resort town of Tiberias, killing two persons and
wounding 37. The latest attack threatened to
spark a new round of Israeli reprisal raids
which have left 80 Lebanese and Palestinians
dead since April 22.
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organi
zation claimed responsibility for the midafter
noon bombing that shattered the festive at
mosphere in the popular vacation town on the
Sea of Galilee. It was jammed with tourists who
had arrived for a holiday which began last
night.
The bomb exploded while presidents Elias
Sarkis of Lebanon and Hafez Assad of Syria
were meeting in Damascus, the Syrian capital,
about the recent Israeli raids against Lebanon
that began after four Israelis died in a Palesti
nian guerrilla raid on the northern Israeli coas
tal town of Nahariya on April 22.
The fatal bomb blast in Tiberias also coin

would start a war against Lebanon and Syria

Santiago, Chile — The head of the Supreme
Court refused yesterday to grant the extradi
tion of three former Chilean secret police offi
cials whom the United States wants to try for
the 1976 murder in Washington of exiled Chi
lean socialist Orlando Letelier.
Gen. Juan Manuel Contreras, one of the
three accused in the United States of ordering
the assassination, said he was happy with the
"professional justice" of the ruling. He called
the entire proceedings "a very well mounted
show."
The United States' request was tor the ex
tradition of Contreras, former chief of the
police Jnit known as DINA, Col. Pedro Es
pinoza Bravo, former DINA chief of opera
tions, and Capt. Armando Fernandez Larios,
an agent at the time of Letelier's death in 1976.
Letelier had been imprisoned fora year after
the military overthrew Marxist president Sal
vador Allende on Sept. 11, 1973. Once freed,
he went into exile and became a leading oppo
nent of the regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
Letelier had served in Allende's cabinet.
Contreras was indicted in August by a
Washington grand jury for allegedly ordering
the killing of Letelier. Espinoza and Fernandez
also were indicted for murder. Five Cuban
exiles were indicted as well, four of them for
murder.
Michael Townley, an American who lived
many years in Chile and says he worked for the
DINA, has confessed to leading the murder
mission. He said it was done on orders passed
to him by Espinoza, the DINA chief of opera
tions, and that Fernandez Larios monitored
Letelier's movements in Washington before
the bomb was planted.

Energy chief unveils gas plan
Sacramento — State energy chief Richard
Maullin unveiled proposed regulations yes
terday that would require more California gas
stations to stay open weekends and allow them
to sell only 10 gallons per customer at that
time.
Maullin also told a meeting of station dealers
and oil company officials that he would try to
free up as much as 30 million gallons of gas in
state-managed emergency supplies this
month, about 3 percent of the state's use, and
again next month to help ease the fight for gas
at long lines during the gas shortage.
Under the proposed order, stations that
pumped more than 50,000 gallons of gas in
March would be required to stay open Satur
days if their gas motor fuel pump location
number was odd or on Sunday if that number
was even.
Asked by reporters if the state would call out
the National Guard if a large number of sta
tions refused to stay open, Maullin said, "In
the extreme, and that would be extreme, the
answer is yes."
But Maullin later said the questions about
the National Guard were "really a wrong em
phasis" and "a totally hypothetical, last
recourse type of measure which is not likely
nor required."
Radiation leaks in truck fire
Las Vegas, Nev. — About 10 persons were
exposed to low-level radiation yesterday
morning when a truck carrying nuclear medi
cal waste caught fire and burned at a nuclear
dump site about 110 miles northwest of here,
authorities said.
The maximum exposure that showed up on
monitoring badges was about 5 millirems, said
Dr. John Carr, the state health officer. By com
parison, he said, the average chest X-ray ex
poses a person to about 45 millirems.
"There were no injuries. There was no air
borne contamination," said Evelyn Arnold, a
spokesman at the Louisville, Ky. headquarters
of Nuclear Engineering Co. Inc., operator of
the dump site.

The incident occurred about 5:30 a.m. while
the truck was waiting to enter the dump site,
about 10 miles south of Beatty.
The town of about 500 persons is near the
eastern entrance to Death Valley National
Monument and lies several miles west of the
sprawling Nevada Test Site, the nation's only
underground nuclear test range.

night a 1980 target budget that would cut Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's proposed federal deficit

tions, calls for $529.9 billion in spending and a
