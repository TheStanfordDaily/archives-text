In yesterday's Daily, the article on
the Lomita Drive extension mista
kenly paraphrased Robert Hamrdla,
chairman of the Committee on Park
ing and Transportation, as saying,
"the final decision will be reached
only after all student input has been
heard."
Though student opinion may be
heard, the final decision on the
Lomita extension is not contingent
on that input.
President Richard Lyman said that
he plans to make a decision
"shortly," as to whether to begin
construction on the road this sum
mer. Headded that student input will
be taken into account.
