# Three-Mile warning issued one year ago
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The reactor
manufacturer and federal regulators
were warned a year ago that a key
instrument involved in the Three
Mile Island accident was unreliable
for checking the level of cooling
water in the reactor core, according
to documents obtained by The As
sociated Press.
But sources probing the nuclear
accident said the warning was largely
ignored and operators of the Bab
cock & Wilcox reactors were allowed
to believe they could depend on the
instrument for that purpose.
Babcock & Wilcox, a Virginia
based engineering firm, built the
now-crippled reactor near Harris
burg, Pa., as well as nine other reac
tors now temporarily closed for
further safety checks.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commis
sion has said the instrument, a pres
surizer level indicator, misled an
operator into turning off an
emergency cooling system. The
operator believed the pressure regis
tered by the gauge meant too much
water was in the reactor core, when
in fact the core was getting far too
little water.
That move has been cited as a
major reason for the fuel rods being
uncovered for nearly an hour on the
day of the accident and apparently
causingextensivefuel damage. Since
the accident, the NRC has told
operators at all of the nation's reac
tors not to rely on the pressure level
gauge alone to determine core water
levels.
But according to the documents
obtained by the AP, a nuclear consul
tant came to the same conclusion
and reported it more than a year ago,
following a year-long study on the
consequences of small breaks in
reactor cooling systems.
Carl Michelson, a nuclear en
gineer for the Tennessee Valley Au
thority and an NRC consultant, wrote
in January 1978 that "the pressurizer
level is not considered a reliable
guide as to core cooling conditions."
Furthermore, he said in a 29-page
report, reliance on the instrument
"may convince the operator to trip

(shut down) the HPI (emergency
cooling system) pump and watch for
a subsequent loss of pressure level."
That, say government and industry
sources, is exactly what happened
March 28 at the Three Mile Island
reactor.
Michelson said in a telephone in
terview from his home in Oak Ridge,
Tenn., that his report was sent to
Babcock & Wilcox on April 27, 1978,
but he did not get a reply until early
this year.
Babcock & Wilcox, in a Jan. 23 let
ter from )ames McEarland, senior
project manager, said the company
agreed the pressurizer level is "not a
reliable indication" of water level in
the core. But the company said the
use of the instrument along with
other available instruments "will
provide sufficient guidance for
operator action."
No further action was taken on the

matter.
Jesse Ebersole, who before his re
tirement in 1976 was Michelson's
boss as TVA's chief nuclear engineer,
said Babcock & Wilcox "stalled. They
did not respond" to Michelson's
findings.
Ebersole, who also is a member of
the NRC's Advisory Committee on
Reactor Safeguards, said in a tele
phone interview that if the report's
findings had been made available to
Babcock & Wilcox plant operators, "I
doubt that it (the core damage) ever
would have happened" at Th ree Mile
Island.
In early 1978 at Michelson's re
quest, Ebersole said, he circulated
the report among NRC officials as
well as members of the advisory
committee. He said he tried "to de
velop questions on it" but "it was
dead-ended."
"It's something as old as man him

self," Ebersole said of the govern
ment and industry reaction. "As long
as everything appears to be going
smoothly, let's not rock the boat."
There was no immediate comment
from Babcock & Wilcox. Frank In
gram, an NRC spokesman, said he
was unaware that the commission
had the Michelson report before the
Three Mile Island accidents, but that
he would investigate the report.
A source, who has seen transcripts
of NRC staff interviews with plant
operators on duty at the time of the
accident, said the workers were
under the impression that a high
reading on the pressurizer level indi
cator meant high levels of water in
the reactor core.
The pressurizer, located inside the
reactor's containment building, is
designed to control pressure levels
within the reactor vessel where the
core is located.
