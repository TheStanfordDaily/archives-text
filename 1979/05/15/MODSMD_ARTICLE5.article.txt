# Three-Mile warning issued one year ago

Washington (AP) â€” The reactor
manufacturer and federal regulators
were warned a year ago that a key
instrument involved in the Three
Mile Island accident was unreliable
for checking the level of cooling
water in the reactor core, according
to documents obtained by The As
sociated Press.
But sources probing the nuclear
accident said the warning was largely
ignored and operators of the Bab
cock & Wilcox reactors were allowed
to believe they could depend on the
instrument for that purpose.
Babcock & Wilcox, a Virginia
based engineering firm, built the
now-crippled reactor near Harris
burg, Pa., as well as nine other reac
tors now temporarily closed for
further safety checks.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commis
sion has said the instrument, a pres
surizer level indicator, misled an
operator into turning off an
emergency cooling system. The
operator believed the pressure regis
tered by the gauge meant too much
water was in the reactor core, when
in fact the core was getting far too
little water.
That move has been cited as a
major reason for the fuel rods being
uncovered for nearly an hour on the
