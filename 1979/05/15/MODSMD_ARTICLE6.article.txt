# Willie Brown addresses black health care problems
## 
### Robert Reed 
Although every American citizen is enti
tled to adequate health care, systematic dis
crimination of blacks has made health care
only a hard-sought privilege and not a right,
said Assemblyman Willie Brown, )r., who
spoke here Saturday.
He also charged the University of Califor
nia with deliberately designing for blacks
applying to medical schools a "special ad
mittance" program which was doomed to be
struck down by the Supreme Court in the
Bakke decision in 1978.
Brown, keynote speaker at the Bay Area
Pre-Medical Conference presented by the
Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization,
said, "Clearly, health care should be a right
for every person living in this country re

gardless of the community in which they
live. However, since the dawn of time,
health care has really been a privilege and
not a right — of any particular individual or
any particular community. And that's been
even more so in the black community.
He explained that the cause of this lack of
medical care lies even at the roots of the
medical field — in medical school admis
sions.
Though most of the medical training
facilities in the state are publicly financed,
prior to the University of California's "spe
cial admittance" program, which was com
menced because "black folk had been in the
streets" following the assassination of the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, )r. in 1968,
Brown said there had never been more than
two blacks allowed entrance to any first-year
class of any medical institution in the Uni
versity of California system and no more
than one per year had ever graduated from
the system.
According to Brown, however, even this
"special admittance" program was based on
racism. He said this program was designed
to be struck down.
Designed for defeat
"They decided at the university's highest
level to construct a program that could not
stand the challenge of an Allan Bakke,"
Brown charged. He said the university
adopted the strict quota which deliberately
discriminated on behalf of blacks in order to
have it disallowed by the courts.
"They looked high and low to find some
one like Allan Bakke," Brown said.
"In that year, they set us up. They made
sure that Allan Bakke's grades, medical ad
mission tests, and all the other factors were
just a little bit above every (black) they ad
mitted that year to the University of Califor
nia at Davis."
After that, Brown charged, "They literally
hand-carried him to the right lawyer to sue
them. They invited the lawsuit!"
Lawsuit invited?
To make sure their policy was struck
down, Brown claimed that "at the factual
stage of that case, they literally stipulated

that they had discriminated, but for a good
reason.
"But there's no court in the country that
would sustain discrimination, even for a
good reason — particularly when you do not
admit that you had been previously dis
criminating in the other direction," Brown
said. If they had, Brown said the Court's
opinion in the Bakke case would have al
lowed the special program.
However, according to Brown, the court
did not do that. Brown said the university
claimed that they had always had an "open
door" policy and that they had only adopted
this program to "help" blacks who for some
reason had not been able to get in under a
normal "non-discriminatory" system. After
the decision, rather than looking for other
ways to "help" blacks, Brown noted, the
university dropped its '"special admittance"
program altogether.
"Brown v. Board of Education (the 1954
Supreme Court ruling which declared
segregation illegal) lulled some people into
complacency," Brown claimed. The assemb
lyman explained that although there had

been some institutional change, that change
"caused many of us to go to sleep. And while
we were asleep, all of what we thought we
had built for institutional change was de
stroyed."
Brown called upon all black people to or
ganize to restructure the entire system, say
ing there would be no messiah, no one great
leader of the cause.
Call to organization
"There isn't a black in this country in any
power position that could withhold con
struction funds tor any medical institution in
this country on the basis that its admissions
policies were discriminatory," Brown at
tested.
"Blacks are not permitted any power
sources in this country," Brown said. Brown
said that any black who begins to exert any
power meets heavy opposition.
Brown said there is a lack of quality, op
portunity and availability of medical care for
blacks in America.
In all of Los Angeles, with about 600,000
black citizens, there are less than 200 practic

ing physicians in primary health care, Brown
said.
Physician-patient ratio
"We talk about how horrible it is in India
from a health care standpoint; and the
physician-patient ratio there is one to 6000.
In America, for black folk the physician
patient ratio is one to about 18,000," he told
the audience.
Brown said he was disturbed that the polit
ical leadership accepts this kind of situation,
and said he was "sad to say" that there are
some blacks who are a part of that political
leadership.
"Black people have got to advocate any
type of government health service," Brown
said.
Following the keynote address by Brown,
an assemblyman from the 17th District in San
Francisco, the conference offered work
shops on such topics as alternative health
professions, medical school admissions,
financing, women in medicine, and mental
health in the black community. Representa
tives from various medical schools through
out California attended.
