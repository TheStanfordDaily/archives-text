# Kennedy reveals revised health plan

### 
Washington (AP) â€” Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) announced yesterday his plan to
insure all Americans against health care
costs, but acknowledged that congressional
resistance makes passage "an uphill battle."
Kennedy and other backers of his national
health insurance plan, including labor lead
ers, groups for the retired and the
minorities, called upon the administration
to support the proposal, which would cover
everybody regardless of age or income level.
"We are appealing to President (Jimmy)
Carter to come in from the cold," Bill Hut
ton, head of the National Council of Senior
Citizens, said at a news conference called to
unveil Kennedy's bill.
Carter wants a more modest health care
plan that would phase in segments of the
population while at first protecting the el

derly, the poor and those suffering from
catastrophic illnesses.
Kennedy, who is chairman of the Senate
Human Resources subcommittee on health,
said his proposal "is the best chance to avoid
national bankruptcy and to bring spiraling
health costs under control."
Kennedy and his chief cosponsor in the
House, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.),
chairman of the House Commerce sub
committee on health, agreed it will be a
long, tough congressional fight.
The American Medical Association said
the "inevitable result" of the proposal
would be "rationing of health care services,
new federal regulations and huge new
costs."
According to cost estimates figured by

Kennedy's staff, the new plan would be
more expensive in its early years than the
present health care system. But they said
four years alter congressional passage, the
nation would spend less on health care than
if no legislation were enacted.
The bill would slap strong cost controls on
hospitals and physicians. There would be
full coverage for inpatient hospital services,
physicians' services in and out of hospital,
X-rays and laboratory tests. It would pay for
catastrophic illnesses.
Medicare would be upgraded for the el
derly and cover hearing aids and prescrip
tion drugs for them.
Coverage for the poor also would be ex
panded, but states would contribute only
what they are presently spending on
Medicaid.
