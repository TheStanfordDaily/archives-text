## Protect media sources 
### 
Recently, a rather upsetting trend has
been gaining speed across the land.
More and more courts are ordering
journalists to either provide information
given to them in confidence or go to jail.
Though reporters are the people captur
ing headlines in these matters, make no
mistake about it: the victims are the
people of this country.
One such case involved news reporter
Joe Pennington of KPIX-TV in San Fran
cisco. While working in Kansas in 1977,
Pennington covered a trial where a
woman was charged with first-degree
murder of her husband.
Pennington reported that a prosecu
tion witness had been overheard
threatening to kill the defendant's hus
band shortly before his death. Pen
nington was ordered to disclose the
name of the source who gave him this
information in confidence.
Pennington, who had no first-hand
knowledge of the threat, did disclose the
date, time and place of the threat but not
the name of the person who told him
about it.
The Kansas Supreme Court ordered
Pennington to disclose his source's
name or go to jail for 60 days.
A dissenting justice said the defen
dant's defense was insanity, and thus he
could not see why the reporter should
be required to disclose information
which could not be material to an ele
ment of this defense, reduce the grada
tion of the crime or mitigate any pos
sible sentence, and these were — as the
Kansas Supreme Court's majority said —
the three elements used to force disclo
sure in criminal cases.
The U.S. Supreme Court recently de
clined to review this case, and thus Pen
nington now must choose between
breaching his promise and going to jail.
The nation's highest court has also de
clined to review:
— an lowa case where an attorney was
sued for libel and invasion of privacy.
The plaintiff demanded that a reporter
disclose confidential information the at
torney had given the reporter, yet the
plaintiff never attempted to seek this in
formation from the lawyer.

The lowa Supreme Court ruled there
were no other reasonable means to get
this information except by forcing the
reporter to disclose it. This reporter
must also disclose her information or go
to jail.
— an Idaho case where a reporter was
given a 30-day sentence for refusing to
reveal a confidential police source used
in a story about a narcotics officer's
shooting of a suspect.
Judges, many of whom are conserva
tives and "law and order" appointees,
have been racing to wrap themselves in a
defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a
fair trial whenever the First Amendment
is involved. These are the same judges
who rarely have anything good to say
about the Sixth Amendment and crimi
nal defendants, except when they can
use it to bludgeon journalists and the
First Amendment.
In libel cases, judges can now enter
large judgments against reporters forfai
lure to provide certain information, in
cluding what their "thoughts" were as
they researched and wrote a story.
Some may say that this is nothing more
than the news media complaining be
cause its ox has been gored, or that jour
nalists are arrogant in demanding rights
and privileges which no one else has or
should have.
We won't go into those arguments
here, for they tend to obscure the crucial
point. We wish to point out that the con
tinual sentencing of reporters to jail will
have a major impact on the information
we all receive and need as citizens.
Long before reporters begin breaking
promises of confidentiality to avoid jail,
sources are going to decide that they
can't risk a reporter breaking down
under a penalty of jail or large pecuniary
damages, and so those sources will sim
ply not pass information along to jour
nalists.
So the next time you feel that there is a
dearth of information in a story you're
reading, or wonder why certain informa
tion which you know about isn't being
published, remember it may not be just
the fault of the news media.
