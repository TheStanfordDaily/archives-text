# 'Vampire' found sane
## 
### 
Palo Alto (AP) â€” A jury of
eight women and four men
Monday found Richard Tren
ton Chase sane when he mur
dered six persons and drank
some of their blood.
The penalty phase of the so
called "vampire" trial is next.
Last week the jury found Chase
guilty of the 1978 murders to
which he had pleaded inno
cent by reason of insanity.
Chase's attorney, Ferris
Salamy, attempted to show
during the trial in Santa Clara
County Superior Court that

Chase had a "diminished"
capacity and could not have
formulated the mental state to
have committed the murders.
A pregnant woman and two
children were among the vic
tims. Prosecution witnesses
testified that Chase not only
drank the blood of some vic
tims but drank the blood of
animals he had killed.
According to one psychiatric
witness, Chase believed he
needed the blood to restore
his health.
