## Offer proxy resolutions 
### 
It seems that the Board of Trustees has
finally begun to deal with the problems
of the oppressed blacks living in South
Africa. The trustees have been accepting
recommendations from the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR)
to vote "yes" on shareholder resolutions
from several corporations requiring a
non-expansion of corporate activities in
South Africa.
We applaud the trustees' action, and
we feel it is a huge step forward for this
organization. An institution as prestigi
ous as the University can make a state
ment about its abhorrence to apartheid
by supporting such resolutions, and we
feel that under the present cir
cumstances voting "yes" was an impor
tant first step.
There was a time when we supported
the trustees in their abstention on simi
lar proposals. We felt that the corpora
tions had been hit with all the concern
over South Africa very quickly, and we
felt that the groups should reasonably be
given some time to conform to equal
opportunity policies in force in this
country.
That was two years ago. In an editorial
on South African investments at that
time, we urged the University to sponsor
its own shareholder resolutions calling
for adherence to the so-called Sullivan
Principles, a set of equal opportunity
guidelines.
That was not done.
Last year, we expressed disappoint
ment at some trustee actions which were
inconsistent with recommendations of
the CIR on South Africa.
This year, however, the trustees and
the CIR have been more in agreement on
what to do with proxies on a whole range
of social responsibility issues including
South Africa. But while we are pleased
with the trustee's re-evaluation of these
issues, we do not believe the board has
gone far enough.
To be honest, we have been hearing a
bunch of rhetoric from some corpora
tions concerning their record of
achievement toward equality in South
Africa. Frankly, we are convinced that in

the two years since the Old Union sit-in,
only a few American corporations have
taken significant action toward insuring
equality for their employees in that nation.
There are exceptions, but by and
large, we believe that the plight of blacks
is not substantially better. And, contrary
to the corporate propaganda, we do not
feel that American corporations are act
ing as progressive forces for change in
that country.
We have waited long enough. We feel
two years is a reasonable amount of time
for the corporations to begin effecting
some real change.
Therefore, we are renewing our plea
for the University to begin drafting its
own shareholder resolutions. But we are
modifying the plea. Now, when dealing
with particularly unprogressive corpora
tions, instead of just asking them to
adhere to the Sullivan Principles, we feel
the University should sponsor resolu
tions calling for their withdrawal, by a
phasing-out of operations, from South
Africa.
We do not feel University divestment
from non-progressive corporations is
the answer. We feel the University can
have a greater impact, if it chooses to
take a stand, by working from within.
We feel the CIR can provide a true
service toward the goal of social respon
sibility by evaluating the records of those
corporations which have South African
interests. If the University holds stock in
particularly unprogressive corporations,
the CIR should draft carefully worded,
but effective, resolutions for the
shareholders requiring an end to those
corporations' involvement in South Af
rica. The board should approve those
drafts, and they should be submitted for
shareholder scrutiny next year.
Only if the University makes this effort
will the world be able to believe that
Stanford is truly concerned about the
social activities of corporations in which
it owns stock. A failure to make an affir
mative move like this may mark the Uni
versity's past statements as empty words
issued solely for the gullible public's
consumption.
