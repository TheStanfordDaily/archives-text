## Discover the world unconventionally 
### 
As you are contemplating
what to do with your life this
summer or next year, consider
taking some time off to pursue
the time-honored activity of
vagabonding if you haven't
tried it yet.
By vagabonding, I don't
mean simply traveling from
here to there cheaply, but
rather roving through an area
while carrying a minimum of
physical and mental baggage.
To me, vagabonding means
living between the cracks of
society for awhile, perhaps by
chipping out a small niche in
the carefully built prison of
land ownership within our soc
iety by sleeping in fields at
night, or else by traveling by
"unofficial" means whenever
possible — hitchhiking, bicycl
ing or simply walking.
Vagabonding also means giv
ing up, to a large extent, the
social structures which most of
us use to define ourselves —
our status as students, our
cars, nice clothes or networks
of friends and references.
Subculture contact
One of the most obvious be
nefits of vagabonding is being
in close contact with the sub
cultures of the area you are
moving through. There can be
noticeable differences in
foods, social customs (such as

greetings) and general com
munity atmosphere overjusta
few miles.
Moreover, most of the world
is geographically contiguous.
By bicycling or hiking, one can
notice the subtlecultural trans
itions and similarities that span
national boundaries.
A second advantage of vag
abonding is that it provides an
opportunity to find out how lit
tle you need to get by.
Light travel
When I bicycled through the
British Isles this summer, my
transportation (a ten-speed
with tools), shelter (sleeping
bag, insulating pad, tarp and
poncho), clothes and a day's
food and water all together
weighed about 40 pounds.
Of course, traveling so light
means a greater dependence
on the people around.
Such dependence can
be a very positive experience,
however, because it coun
teracts the myth that we all can
or should be completely self
sufficient.
But perhaps the most impor
tant advantage of vagabonding
is that by giving up many of the
social structures you normally
exist in, you may (as I did) learn
more about yourself and about
how much we all depend on

social indicators (clothes,
mutual acquaintances, occu
pation) in judging others.
Trust, empathy
When, as a vagabond, you
have no assigned social iden
tity, you have to establish some
basic human elements of trust
and empathy with the people
you meet.
Sometimes that can be very
hard, but often it's rewarding,
and you can (at least, I did)
build up a degree of reliance
on yourself that's not depen
dent upon the particular social
role you are in.
Vagabonding works as well
in America as in Europe, so if
you can find some free time, I
would urge you to grab a sleep
ing bag, some maps, maybe a
book to read, a few other

things you really need (think
carefully), and take off for
awhile with a friend or alone,
by bike, by thumb or by foot.
Use common sense in plan
ning and making your journey,
but try to avoid schedules, and
with luck perhaps you will find
how much can be learned from
the real world, and how easy it
really is to enjoy life.
