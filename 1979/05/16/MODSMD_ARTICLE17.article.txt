## Stanford can't actively oppose draft 
### 
I am writing with regard "to
the article by Bill Balson et al.
(Daily, May 3) urging the Uni
versity to take a stand against
the draft.
I recognize that the current
legislative activity which would
reinstitute registration and/or
conscription has generated a
good deal of concern on this
campus and on others.
It is also quite understanda
ble that students, both for
emotional and political
reasons, want their University
to become an advocate of their
point of view. That wish is by
no means unique to this issue.
Frequently, it is hard for stu
dents to understand why the
University, as an institution,
declines to do so. Let me try to
explain.

As you are well aware, the
time is long past when the gov
ernment went its way and uni
versities — especially private
universities — went theirs. We
are now deeply involved with
every level of government and
with every branch at every
level. Under the best of cir
cumstances it is impossible for
us, as a single institution, to be

I certainly do not believe that my position
as president gives me license to speak for
others at Stanford on social and political
controversies.

active on every issue that af
fects us.
We are constantly making
judgments about what is most
pressing, whether we can de
pend on others to represent
our point of view, whether our
active participation can be jus
tified by the effect we are likely
to have on the outcome and a
host of other considerations of
a similar nature.
Bear in mind that what I have
just described applies only to
issues that are either clearly
educational or that directly af
fect the operations of the Uni
versity. Examples of the latter
might fall in the areas of labor
relations, taxation, retirement
age, social security and so
forth.

When the University ven
tures out of areas directly re
lated to it, two things happen,
both bad. The first is that it
speaks with much diminished
authority, and the second is
that it loses force on those mat
ters on which it is crucially im
portant that it speak with
maximum force.
The second of those is

perhaps the more obvious.
When the institution moves
outside of its area of compe
tence, so to speak, it has little
of an authoritative nature to
add to the debate.
Inevitably, to act in that way
makes our voice simply one of
a chorus; we diminish the ad
vantage we have when we
speak from our clear interests
and from our superior know
ledge. What we lose far ex
ceeds any possibility of gain.
That is a practical considera
tion. The first is more funda
mental, and it requires us to
address two important ques
tions: For whom does the Uni
versity speak, and who speaks
for the University? Both of
those questions have clear

answers when the issue at
hand clearly affects the institu
tion.
Neither has a satisfactory
answer when it does not. I cer
tainly do not believe that my
position as president gives me
license to speak for others at
Stanford on the range of the
day's social and political con
troversies.
I would hold that view even if
I were certain that there
existed a substantial consensus
on the campus. On the matter
of the draft, I am quite sure that
no such consensus exists, so at
best I would be representing
some and opposing others.
Others at Stanford have
other responsibilities. The
ASSU and the Faculty Senate,
for example, are representa
tive bodies. They are, it seems
to me, freer to deliberate and
act on behalf of their con
stituents, though not on behalf
of the institution itself.
All of this does not mean, of
course, that Stanford, as Stan
ford, will be silent as this de
bate proceeds. \ have aHeady
indicated, as has University
Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig, our
belief that, if there is to be draft
registration, the government
should deal directly with indi
viduals and not use universities
simply because it is administra
tively convenient to do so.
We have ample evidence
from the recent past that it is
harmful to universities to be
used in that way. That is an
issue on which we can speak
with authority. There may be
others that will develop if legis
lative efforts move forward. I
can assure you that we will be
following the matter closely.
(Richard Lyman is president of
the University.)
