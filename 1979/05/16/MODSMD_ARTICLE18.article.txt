Be tolerant of frats
The last few weeks have seen
a lot of words exchanged on the
subject of fraternities. As a per
son who has lived in several
different kinds of housing at
Stanford, I'd like to call a halt to
the whole thing. Will both
sides please shut up?
I say this not because there
are necessarily more important
things for us to discuss; living
situations in many ways figure
in our education.
I say this because I feel the
debate reveals an unfortunate
intolerance on the part of many
people involved. Your moral
worth is not determined by
where you live, or should not
be.
Objections to frats are, on
the whole, irrational, and so
are any statements to the effect
that fraternities are the only
way to live.
Far too often for a school of
this stature, students have de
rided other people's living
situations. Everyone seems to
be down on everyone else.
If people were serious and
open-minded, they'd realize
that, while they ought to be
critical in deciding where they
themselves will live, they can
not judge another person's
choice.
I could recite a litany of
"types'' I've found in dorms
and in frats, but that would be
pointless. I'd surely be lying or
ignorant to say that every living
situation has the same mixture
of people: I'd be in effect deny
ing that there is a choice in
housing. The people in the dif
ferent nouses, however, sim
ply do not behave all that diffe
rently.

I've heard people insult their
friends for joining fraternities.
I've heard frat men say stupid
things about other living situa
tions. Such talk is useless and
hurtful.
While people ought to dis
cuss the advantages of the dif
ferent housing choices on
campus, this debate has to
stop. I suggest we all be more
tolerant, and think of more
constructive topics for debate.

Close Mayfield
We support the proposed
Lomita Drive extension for the
following reasons.
First, needed access for
emergency vehicles will be
provided to the living groups
on the extension. Traffic flow
will be significantly improved
as a result of the rerouting. The
dangerous congestion on
Mayfield Avenue will be elimi
nated.
Needed jobs will be pro
vided for the depressed con

struction industry. Through a
detailed engineering
economic analysis, we have
determined that the benefit/
cost ratio is greater than one
and the project is therefore
economically desirable.
The closure of Mayfield Av
enue will improve the quality
of the air in that region. Lastly,
local tourism will increase as a
result of this project.

The right limo
With all due respect, we wish
to correct Greg Sidak's letter
(Daily, May 14), "Noblesse ob
lige," regarding the Delta Upsi
lon bid party. The limousine in
question was not a Cadillac but
a Lincoln Continental.
