## Budget cuts to force drop in services 
### 
Brace yourselves, folks. The people who
run this University are forecasting budget
deficits in the near future. If such financial
problems materialize next year as ex
pected, some tough decisions will have to
be made.
Although most students here know very
little about Stanford's budget, the Univer
sity's financial situation affects us all —
through tuition, financial aid and program
offerings. Here are a few aspects of the
current income situation and the long
range forecast:
Tuition is the only variable over which
the University has more or less complete
control, subject to the limits of remaining
competitive with other institutions. Stan
ford's policy is to limit tuition increase to
2.5 percent over the expected consumer
price index. Tuition funds about 50 per
cent of the operating budget.
Depend on largesse
Gifts depend on the generosity of Stan
ford's benefactors. Apparently there has
been some increase this year, but gifts are
only expected to increase at the rate of
inflation.

Endowment income depends largely on
how well the stock market does. Since the
market is not all that strong these days, it
may be impossible to keep the endow
ment income growing at the rate of infla
tion. Consequently, the endowment man
agers are investigating alternative ways to
use the University's resources, including
diversification into real estate.
Indirect cost recovery is the means by
which financial benefits from research
grants accrue to the University. Fortu
nately, Stanford does quite well in attract
ing grants from the government and other
sources and research volume is increasing
to some extent.
Costs rising
But unfortunately, the costs of running a
research institution are going up. Univer
sities, along with most institutions in the
country, are being squeezed (probably an
understatement) by the increasing gov
ernment demands for accountability.
Toughening regulations and accounta
bility requirements are often-cited by
Stanford officials as a threat to the school's
well-being.

On the expenditure side, almost half of
the operating budget is spent on instruc
tion — primarily on salaries. This extreme
labor-intensiveness makes the University
particularly hard-hit by inflation. As a con
sequence, faculty salaries have been un
able to keep pace with inflation.
Outlay up
Expenditures on running the physical
plant have increased in recent years, but
University Vice President for Business and
Finance William Massey claims that the pro
jects now are long overdue.
What will happen when expenses ex
ceed income, as is projected in the long
range forecast? At this point, it is unclear,
but one can expect a percentage of the
cuts to be in instruction.
In this event, I hope the ASSU will be
come actively involved in voicing student
opinion on the priorities, particularly
through the Advisory Committee on
Budget Planning.
