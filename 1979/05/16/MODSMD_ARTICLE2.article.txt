# Death list possible for national leaders
## People's Temple, Jim Jones linked to conspiracy in Ryan's murder 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” Congressional
investigators said yesterday they
could not rule out the possibility that
members of the Peoples Temple are
pursuing national leaders in accor
dance with the last wishes of the Re
verend |im Jones.
The investigators, reporting to the
House Foreign Affairs Committee
after a six-month probe into the
murder of Rep. Leo Ryan in Guyana,
said the possibility that cultists had a
"death list" marking national leaders
for assassination "should not be to
tally discounted."
"There is evidence to suggest
Jones and some of his key lieuten
ants discussed and had 'understand
ings' toeliminatevarious individuals,
including national political leaders,"
the staff report concluded. "Time
may diminish the possible threat of
this factor."
Underscoring their concern, the
staff investigators delivered their re
port under heavy security. Police
guarded each door, and those enter
ing the room passed through metal
detectors.

Ryan, three journalists and a cult
defector were shot to death at an
airstrip near the Peoples Temple's
settlement in Guyana last Nov. 18
while attempting to investigate re
ports that )ones, the cult leader, was
holding people against their will.
While Ryan and his party were under
attack, Jones led more than 900 cult
members in a ritual murder-suicide
by cyanide poisoning.
Family present
Present at the congressional ses
sion to hear the report on the inci
dent were several members of Ryan's
family, including his daughter, Erin,
and two sisters, Sheila Ryan and
Shannon Torphy.
The investigators told the commit
tee there is circumstantial evidence
that Jones made advance plans with
his lieutenants to assassinate Ryan if
the congressman could not be de
luded on true conditions at the set
tlement.
"Providing some moderate cre
dence to the idea of a contingency
conspiracy is the fact that the Jones
town suicide-murder ritual started

before the Port Kaituma airstrip as
sailants returned to confirm the
shootings of Rep. Ryan and others,"
the report said.
Cyanide shipment?
It said there also are unconfirmed
reports that a large shipment of
cyanide used in the mass murder ar
rived in Jonestown two days before
Ryan's visit.
"Also related is the reported
statement of a Jonestown survivor
that several days before Ryan arrived
at Jonestown, he heard Jones say that
the congressman's plane 'might fall

from the sky.' "
The House investigators agreed
with State Department findings that
the department had failed to pursue
earlier warnings of possible mass
suicide at the cult.
As a result, the House report said,
the State Department had four re
ports of potential violence scattered
in files but told Ryan that danger was
"unlikely."
'Gut feelings'
Ryan was advised more than once
by his own staff of "gut feelings" that
