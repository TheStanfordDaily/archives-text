# Freshman songwriter 'breaks through'
## 
### Rose Cecile Chan 
"I've played in places where
no one listened.
I've played in places where
they all whistled..."
Guy Nohra, a freshman here,
echoes the familiar cry of a
struggling musician in his song
"Breakthrough." As he strums
on his guitar and scribble lyrics
with The Songwriter's Hand
book at his fingertips, Nohra
realizes he is one of many
musically-inclined young
people torn between the insta
bility of a life of entertainment
and the security of a 9 to 5 desk
job.
"I started when I was 15. I
took guitar lessons from a
priest — a French priest,"
Nohra said.
Singing Donny Osmond's
"Young Love," Nohra went on

to win a singing contest in Eng
land. With the same song, he
took first place in a contest in
Lebanon and was dubbed the
"Donny Osmond of Lebanon."
To get rid of this unwanted
image, he started playing Jose
Feliciano and Bob Dylan songs.
"People who liked mechanged
to people who knew music,"
he said.
Then Nohra found love.
"The first song I wrote was
for her," he said. He adapted a
Dylan lyric and renamed it,
"Takes a Lot to Love, Takes a
Train to Cry."
"I used to go see my
girlfriend, and I took a train to
her boarding school. And
every time I left, it was the
same shitty feeling. That
started my writing career."

The war in Lebanon had a big
impact on Nohra's life. His pa
rents sent him to the United
States where he became a
sophomore at Alameda High
School, California. Academi
cally, he found the change
easy, he said.
Good fortune was also on
Nohra's side musically. He en
tered the Alameda High's ta
lent show, sang a French tune
and two songs by Feliciano and
got first place and a standing
ovation.
"That was also the day my
girlfriend broke up with me,"
Nohra recalled.
At that time, Nohra said he
did mostly religious songs. His
big influence was Kris Kristof
ferson, "because he was bitter
and I could relate."
Nohra joined several fellow
sophomores to make up
"Merging Traffic," a band that
played Top 40 and some disco.
The band's first engagment
was at a summer resort, where
Nohra played rhythm guitar
and was vocalist.
"By then the ego was getting
bigger. People started saying I
was stuck up. Everybody hated
me — I didn't care," said
Nohra. "On weekends I stayed
home and played guitar. If I
wasn't doing that, I worked on
weights. I never went out and
never got drunk. Life was bor
ing."
To Nohra, applying to Stan
ford was a challenge. "I've
never failed in anything be
fore," he said, so rejection by
the University would have
been a first.
"It's okay. It's good," Nohra
said of Stanford. "When I first
came I had roommate trouble.
Then I got a new roommate,
and ever since, it's been a great
party."
Nohra's musical develop
ment has reached the point
where his first album, called
"Breakthrough," is now being
recorded. Nohra said it will in
clude a mixture of rock and
slow with one disco song.
Some of the works will be pre
sented Saturday at Manzanita
Park's "Splender on the
Grass."
The production staff of

"Breakthrough" is composed
of students from Nohra's all
freshman dorm, Arroyo in Wil
burHall — two audio men who
double as Nohra's co
producers, an agent, a co
writer and pianist and a drum
mer. He said his roortimate
Scott Merrill provides stereo
equipment, the room and
"moral support."
Nohra said his current songs
are influenced by Jackson
Browne's music. His favorite
song is Browne's "The Preten
der" because "it shows how
insecure I am as far as music."
"My most mixed-up times
with girls are my most creative,
music-wise," he said.
"I think he has great poten
tial, but he needs more expo
sure," said a freshman who at
tended one of Guy's perfor
mances. "He doesn't have
enough confidence."
But Nohra doesn't seem to
feel any lack of confidence.
"The ego never really died.
Well, it's more super
confidence than ego," he said.
The conflict Nohra faces be
tween a full commitment to
music and a diploma is a com
mon conflict among students.
He said his parents don't ap
prove of a music career, but he
added, "My sisters do because
they can show off. My mom
and dad would rather see me
with a college diploma and an
office. I want to have a diploma
even though I'm into music."
Nohra plans to major in
French and international rela
tions because"! speak so many
languages." He said he knows
French, Lebanese and some
Italian which he picked up as
he and his family traveled
around Europe.
Nohra is acutely conscious
of the unpredictable life of a
rock star. Taped on his bed
board is an article by Dennis
Hunt, "A Clinical Look at
Rock," which concludes:
"The rock star has to literally
fight to keep his sanity. Some
lose the fight."
"I'm going to be a different
rock star," said Nohra. His
song tells his story best:
"He's trying.. .he's try
ing...to break through^."
