## 
### Kathleen O'Hanlon 
The Tresidder Recreation Center is expanding
beyond its walls into the Sierras. Plans are being
made by the student union for an outdoor prog
ram that will include skiing, backpacking and
other trips. The program is scheduled to start
next year.
Greg Larson, director of the center, said that
publication of a guide to equipment rental in the
area is also planned.
"Hopefully, some people will offer students
discounts after the program is established," Lar
son said.
He added he would like to see the center run
its own equipment rental, but said that due to
space constraints, this is not likely in the im
mediate future.
The outdoor program will be designed to
work around and complement activities plan
ned by student groups, Larson emphasized. It
will allow students now involved in active
groups and other members of the Stanford
community to participate in group outdoor ac
tivities
"We're looking at ways to serve the commun
ity better," Larson said.
Profit de-emphasized
Profit is not the center's prime motivation and
because of this, the center has had some finan
cial problems in the past, Larson said. The
year 1974-75 was the last year for the center to
make a profit, each year since, any surplus has
been taken up by the overhead costs of being
part of Tresidder Union.
"The financial situation has been a big con
cern in the last couple of years," Larson said.
However, revenue has increased recently,
partly because of advertising and distribution of
leaflets and coupons.

"Letting people know we're here has
paid off," he explained. The outdoor program isÂ»
another attempt to broaden the center's appeal?
and signals prospects for a better financial
in the future, he added.
Bowling and games currently account for*
most of the center's revenue. The main facilities*
of the center in Tresidder Union are a 14-lanet,
bowling alley and a game room with vid
eogames, pinball, billiards and air hockey.
Tourneys
The center also holds tournaments and helps!
plan campus-wide activities. The center spon-|
sored a pinball tournament during fall quarter,-
and tournaments in backgammon, chess,'
bridge, pool, table tennis and foosball during
the winter. Winners of these tournaments went
on to compete in regionals, meeting students
from schools in California and Nevada.
Plans for spring quarter include tournaments'
in wristwrestling, skateboarding and pinball.
Larson said he is pleased with the growth the
center has shown this year. In addition to in
tramural bowling during weekday afternoons,
there are three non-student bowling leagues,
comprised mostly of staff and faculty members.
A student league meets on Monday evenings.
This is the first year for a women's bowling
team in addition to the already established
men's team, Larson said. The first bowling class
offered through the athletic department was
taught this year, with another one to be given
next year.
"The University environment is relaxed and
progressive," said Larson. In spite of the fact
that the outdoor program is still an unsure thing,
he said he is very enthusiastic and optimistic
about its future.
