Stanford's men and women
row at Redwood Shores — off
101 at the Ralston Marine
World exit in Redwood City —
Friday and Saturday in the
Pac-10 Rowing Championships
and Western Women's Invita
tional. Races will be held from
8 a.m. to noon each day and
from 4 to 8 p.m. Friday. Sunday
the women also row in the
Western Sprints at Lexington
Reservoir in Los Gatos.
The women's crew program

here began four years ago.
The women were all athletes
of some sort in high school and
one team member said that if
they hadn't found crew at Stan
ford, each would have found
something else.
But crew is what they have
found and despite the rigorous
physical conditioning, the cal
louses and the never-satisfied
yearnings for sleep, sopho
more Lori Sutherland said that
10 to 12 of the 15 members of
this year's crew will be out
again next year.
After high school careers as
swimmers, runners, tennis and
basketball players, the crew
members were thrust into an
athletic milieu where large
egos and individual heroics
have no place and anonymity is
the rule.
"It is bad to strive for indi
vidual stardom," said sopho
more Linda Merrill. "The one
thing you don't want to do is to
stand out." The women seem
to revel in the shift from the
"me" emphasis of sports. One
oarswoman said, "The worst
thing about crew is that we
can't get all the women in one
boat."
"The satisfaction is waking
up and asking yourself: 'Why
am I getting up?' and then
going out to practice, finishing
and saying, 'I did it even
though the odds were against
it,' " said freshman Helen
Crocker. "Your mom may have
been trying to phone you for
three days and you may be fail
ing all your classes, but
everyone has got to be there
and everyone has to work
hard.
"Crew is the best thing this
school has offered me,"
Crocker added. "You can burn
my psychology book, but
never my oar."
But dedication does not
come easy. The signs of crew
are numerous. There are nod
ding heads in afternoon clas
ses. The blisters.
"When we had a lecture on
shyness in psychology,"
Crocker said, (Prof. Philip)
"Zimbardo asked us to close
our eyes and hold hands with
the persons next to us.
"The poor guy next to me.
Then Zimbardo asked us to say
something about the hand we

were holding. All the guy next
to me said was 'nice blisters.'
From shyness he could have
gone right into embarrass
ment."
•* * *
Helios finally pokes his gol
den head over the horizon,
looks at his face in the watery
mirror and rubs the sleep out
of his flaming countenance.
The water sparkles and the
intensity of practice picks up.
Brisbin shouts instructions to
the girls from his launch:
"Come on now, don't lean.
Explode on that catch. Susie
take them through some racing
starts."

While the women had origi
nally planned to row next
weekend in the regional meet
at San Diego, there is not
enough money left in the club
coffers for their trip.
Financial woes are as much a
part of Stanford crew as
ScrewU T-shirts.
In 1950 the crew, which was
receiving no money from the
Athletic Department, gained
national attention as "Stan
ford's Orphan Indians." The
orphans solicited donations
from friends and alums and
raised $3500, the money neces
sary to row in the prestigious
Intercollegiate Rowing Associ
ation Regatta held that year in
Marietta, Ohio.
They were the only crew pre
sent without a paid coach or
university subsidization. The
Cards finished third, defeating
all the Eastern powers while
finishing behind West Coast ri
vals Washington and Califor
nia.
The women are merely
another chapter in the chroni
cle of shoestring operations
negotiated by Stanford
oarsmen. Stanford became the
first Pacific Coast team to com
pete in the IRA Regatta when
the Cards entered the 1911
event. They traveled East with
little money and no shell. They
borrowed a beat-up shell from
Cornell and finished second in
the four-mile event.
Throughout this decade the
Cards have lived with the
stigma of using California
hand-me-downs. The "new"
oars that the women painted

the red tips on last week are
second-hand Cal oars.
The women now owe $6000
for their new shell. Whilefund
ing for all club sports will in
crease under new Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger, Himself an
oarsman on the 1959 Pan
American team, the women
will undoubtedly be leaving
debts for future crew teams.
♦ * »
The women are now peeling
off layers of clothing as the sun
ascends and they prepare to
begin their final bursts through
the water. It is the first day with
a new group in the boat and
there are difficulties.
However, by the end of the
workout some of the problems

diminish. Everyone is glad that
practice is over.
Launches are brought on to
the pier, engines are replaced
and the shells are taken up the
bank to their resting spots. The
functional shells dry out next
to peeling wooden museum
pieces with names which speak
of former greatness: Lightfoot,
Westwind Valiant and
Westwood Victory (a shell no
doubt dedicated to former
UCLA basketball mentor John
Wooden).
Cars load up and the women
hurry back to the Farm for 9
o'clock classes. The ducks are
now alone. And now they too
take to the water and find their
own unarticulated joy on the
Redwood Slough.

While the women had origi
nally planned to row next
weekend in the regional meet
at San Diego, there is not
enough money left in the club
coffers for their trip.
Financial woes are as much a
part of Stanford crew as
ScrewU T-shirts.
In 1950 the crew, which was
receiving no money from the
Athletic Department, gained
national attention as "Stan
ford's Orphan Indians." The
orphans solicited donations
from friends and alums and
raised $3500, the money neces
sary to row in the prestigious
Intercollegiate Rowing Associ
ation Regatta held that year in
Marietta, Ohio.
They were the only crew pre
sent without a paid coach or
university subsidization. The
Cards finished third, defeating
all the Eastern powers while
finishing behind West Coast ri
vals Washington and Califor
nia.
The women are merely
another chapter in the chroni
cle of shoestring operations
negotiated by Stanford
oarsmen. Stanford became the
first Pacific Coast team to com
pete in the IRA Regatta when
the Cards entered the 1911
event. They traveled East with
little money and no shell. They
borrowed a beat-up shell from
Cornell and finished second in
the four-mile event.
Throughout this decade the
Cards have lived with the
stigma of using California
hand-me-downs. The "new"
oars that the women painted

the red tips on last week are
second-hand Cal oars.
The women now owe $6000
for their new shell. Whilefund
ing for all club sports will in
crease under new Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger, Himself an
oarsman on the 1959 Pan
American team, the women
will undoubtedly be leaving
debts for future crew teams.

The women are now peeling
off layers of clothing as the sun

begin their final bursts through

a new group in the boat and
there are difficulties.
However, by the end of the
workout some of the problems

diminish. Everyone is glad that
practice is over.
Launches are brought on to
the pier, engines are replaced

functional shells dry out next

Westwood Victory (a shell no
doubt dedicated to former
UCLA basketball mentor John
Wooden).
Cars load up and the women
hurry back to the Farm for 9
o'clock classes. The ducks are
now alone. And now they too
take to the water and find their
own unarticulated joy on the
Redwood Slough.
Ducks stand sentry among

practice. The grey of dawn has

Stanford's men and women
row at Redwood Shores — off
101 at the Ralston Marine
World exit in Redwood City —
Friday and Saturday in the
Pac-10 Rowing Championships
and Western Women's Invita
tional. Races will be held from
8 a.m. to noon each day and
from 4 to 8 p.m. Friday. Sunday
the women also row in the
Western Sprints at Lexington
Reservoir in Los Gatos.
The women's crew program

here began four years ago.
The women were all athletes
of some sort in high school and
one team member said that if
they hadn't found crew at Stan
ford, each would have found
something else.
But crew is what they have
found and despite the rigorous
physical conditioning, the cal
louses and the never-satisfied
yearnings for sleep, sopho
more Lori Sutherland said that
10 to 12 of the 15 members of
this year's crew will be out
again next year.
After high school careers as
swimmers, runners, tennis and
basketball players, the crew
members were thrust into an
athletic milieu where large
egos and individual heroics
have no place and anonymity is
the rule.
"It is bad to strive for indi
vidual stardom," said sopho
more Linda Merrill. "The one
thing you don't want to do is to
stand out." The women seem
to revel in the shift from the
"me" emphasis of sports. One
oarswoman said, "The worst
thing about crew is that we
can't get all the women in one
boat."
"The satisfaction is waking
up and asking yourself: 'Why
am I getting up?' and then
going out to practice, finishing
and saying, 'I did it even
though the odds were against
it,' " said freshman Helen
Crocker. "Your mom may have
been trying to phone you for
three days and you may be fail
ing all your classes, but
everyone has got to be there
and everyone has to work
hard.
"Crew is the best thing this
school has offered me,"
Crocker added. "You can burn
my psychology book, but
never my oar."
But dedication does not
come easy. The signs of crew
are numerous. There are nod
ding heads in afternoon clas
ses. The blisters.
"When we had a lecture on
shyness in psychology,"
Crocker said, (Prof. Philip)
"Zimbardo asked us to close
our eyes and hold hands with
the persons next to us.
"The poor guy next to me.
