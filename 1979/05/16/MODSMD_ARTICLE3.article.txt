### Alisa Terrell 
Education Prof. David Grossman
and 11 graduate students here are
working to put a little "SPICE" into
the lives of thousands of pre
collegiate teachers and students in
the western United States.
SPICE, formally known as the Stan
ford Program for International and
Cross-Cultural Education, is a unique
program designed to educate
teachers in world affairs.
Grossman, director of the prog
ram, and the graduate students con
duct workshops and programs on
China, Japan, Latin America and Af
rica. They focus on the food, arts and
crafts of the regions, as well as the
political and geographical informa
tion.
"Our goal is to make the teachers
more culturally aware, as well as in
formed on current events,"
Grossman said.
The format of SPICE programs is
designed to give teachers direct ex
perience with food, arts and crafts of
other cultures, Grossman said. Lec
turing is kept to a minimum.
"We aim to present, to the highest
possible degree, materials which the
teachers can replicate in the clas
srooms. We do this through presen
tations, discussions, etc.," he said.
Grossman, an associate professor
of international development, stres
sed the importance of an American
public that is knowledgeable in in
ternational affairs and is aware of
cross-cultural perspectives. He
termed this a "survival issue" in the
long run.
"SPICE is a handle for helping
Americans understand the increas
ing problems in the world environ
ment," Grossman said.
SPICE involves 1000 teachers each
year who work with students from
kindergarten through the 12th grade,
Grossman said. SPICE efforts are
concentrated in the western United
States, with extensive out-of-state ef
forts in Utah, Arizona, Colorado,
Alaska and Idaho, he said.
The length of the programs varies
depending on interest and funding
in the particular region, according to
Grossman. Workshops range from
hour-long cultural introductions to
week-long in-depth programs.
"Interest in specific regional prog
rams follows international issues and

problems," Grossman said. "For in
stance, China is 'hot' again this year
because of the United States' recog
nition of the People's Republic."
Funding for the program is pro
vided by the National Endowment of
the Humanities, the U.S. Office of
Education, private foundations and
the University here, according to
Grossman.
