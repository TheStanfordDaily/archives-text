Press freedom in Iran shaky
Tehran, Iran — Iranian newspapers, still assert
ing their independence three months after the
Islamic revolution, are embroiled in a struggle
with ruling forces that could determine the fate of
freedom of the press in this country for years to
come.
At stake is the future of five or six competitive
daily newspapers and a number of magazines
whose editors have boldly attempted to provide a
forum for discussion of political issues. Some of
the publications have been decried as "depraved"
and "leftist" by Iran's strict Shiite Moslem leader,
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and his suppor
ters.
The debate originally pitted Khomeini and his
religious allies, along with angry street de
monstrators, against Iran's biggest morning
newspaper, Ayandegan, published in Tehran.
The newspaper suspended publication with a
protest issue on Saturday after Khomeini criticized
its use of an article about him two days earlier,
based on an interview he gave to the French daily,
Le Monde.
Ayandegan's headline highlighted a statement
attributed to Khomeini that leftists had nothing to
do with recent assassinations in the country.
Without being specific, Khomeini rejected the
Ayandegan story as false, and said the newspaper
had been "depraved" since the start of the revolu
tion.
Gas station shutdown plan folds
Plans for a shutdown of service stations from
tomorrow through Sunday to protest federal price
controls seemed about to collapse yesterday amid
fears of a consumer backlash and government re
taliation. But many stations may close anyway be
cause they've run out of fuel.
"If they're closed down it will be because
they're out of gas," said James Cresente, executive
director of the Northern Ohio Petroleum Retailers
Association. He said the shutdown proposal "kind
of petered out by the time it got here. Nobody
wanted to go along."
California gas dealers may be the only ones to
participate in the protest, although it is doubtful
whether the leaders of the movement will get the
kind of support they had expected. At one time, at
least two-thirds of California's 14,000 dealers were
expected to hang "closed" signs tomorrow.
In other developments in the gasoline crunch
yesterday:
California Gov. Jerry Brown signed an order re*

quiring some stations in this state to stay open on
weekends regardless of the gasoline shortage.
Thatcher's gov't states position
London — Queen Elizabeth 11, resplendent in
her flowing crimson robe and jeweled imperial
crown, told Britain's new Parliament yesterday
that Conservative Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government planned to cut income
taxes, boost defense spending and curb union
power.
In the traditional opening address, the queen
read a speech prepared by ministers in Thatcher's
new Tory government. There were no surprises.
The new session of Parliament, where the Con
servatives won a 43-seat majority in national elec
tions May 3, is expected to last 18 months of the
government's nominal five-year rule.
When the queen finished, former Prime Minis
ter James Callaghan opened fire as head of the
Labor Party, kicking off a six-day debate on the
speech.
He accused the Tories of planning a selfish soci
ety, and sarcastically said their program meant
"Utopia is going to have to be postponed for a day
or two."
Then Thatcher arose to thunderous Conserva
tive cheers and accused the Laborites of leaving
"the biggest debt round the necks of our chil
dren."
Before concluding her speech, the queen said
the Tories will make "every effort to end the con
flict in Rhodesia and to bring about a lasting set
tlement based on the democratic wishes of the
people of that country."
White seeks manslaughter charge
San Francisco — Saying Dan White will be
punished by the law and God for killing Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, his
defense attorney asked for a jury yesterday to re
turn a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.
Douglas Schmidt, in a sometimes emotional,
hour-long closing statement, admitted that White
"had the intent to kill" when he fired two shots
each into the heads of Moscone and Milk.
However, he argued that White did not pre
meditate the killings and had a diminished mental
capacity which prevented him from weighing the
pros and cons of his acts.
Prosecutor Tom Norman, in a four-hour closing
statement, argued to the contrary, saying the kil
lings of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor
Harvey Milk "amounts to two executions." He

asked the jury to convict White of first degree
murder — a verdict which could result in the death
penalty.
Schmidt said White "is going to be punished.
The law will punish him and God will punish him.
"He's going to have to live with this for the rest
of his life. His child will live with it. His family will
live with it. Please . . . just justice."
Curb calls charges ridiculous
Sacramento — A spokesman for Lt. Gov. Mike
Curb yesterday denied as "ridiculous" allegations
that a record company then headed by Curb made
discount sales to organized crime figures.
"He categorically denies the allegations in the
story," Curb's chief of staff, Shel Lytton, said of the
Sacramento See's account of an Internal Revenue
Service investigation of alleged deals between
MGM Records and four alleged underworld fi
gures.
The See, quoting unnamed sources, said the
alleged sales occurred from 1971 to 1973 and the
profits may have totaled more than $1 million.
The See, citing information received by the IRS,
said Curb, who was president of MGM Records
from 1970 to 1973, and Ben Scotti, a former profes
sional football player whose brother is married to
Curb's sister, were directly involved in the ar
rangement.
The article did not say whether Curb and Scotti
were aware of the four men's alleged underworld
connections, or whether the transactions violated
any laws.
Market still sluggish
New York — The stock market staged a modest
rally in early trading yesterday, but the upswing
faded toward the close.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
nearly 5 poi nts at its mid-day week, settled for a .86
gain at 825.88.
Trading remained sluggish. New York Stock Ex
change volume totaled 26.19 million shares against
22.45 million the day before.

profits may have totaled more than $1 million.
The See, citing information received by the IRS,
said Curb, who was president of MGM Records
from 1970 to 1973, and Ben Scotti, a former profes
sional football player whose brother is married to
Curb's sister, were directly involved in the ar

The article did not say whether Curb and Scotti
were aware of the four men's alleged underworld

Market still sluggish
New York — The stock market staged a modest
rally in early trading yesterday, but the upswing
faded toward the close.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
nearly 5 poi nts at its mid-day week, settled for a .86
gain at 825.88.
Trading remained sluggish. New York Stock Ex
change volume totaled 26.19 million shares against
22.45 million the day before.
Today's weather
Coastal overcast spreading over the area this
morning with chance of drizzle. Clearing around
noon today then fair through tomorrow except
patchy low clouds night and morning. Warmer

in the upper 50s to upper6os and tomorrow in the
mid 60s near the coast to the 70s inland.
Press freedom in Iran shaky
Tehran, Iran — Iranian newspapers, still assert
ing their independence three months after the
Islamic revolution, are embroiled in a struggle
with ruling forces that could determine the fate of
freedom of the press in this country for years to
come.
At stake is the future of five or six competitive
daily newspapers and a number of magazines
whose editors have boldly attempted to provide a
forum for discussion of political issues. Some of
the publications have been decried as "depraved"
and "leftist" by Iran's strict Shiite Moslem leader,
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and his suppor
ters.
The debate originally pitted Khomeini and his
religious allies, along with angry street de
monstrators, against Iran's biggest morning
newspaper, Ayandegan, published in Tehran.
The newspaper suspended publication with a
protest issue on Saturday after Khomeini criticized
its use of an article about him two days earlier,
based on an interview he gave to the French daily,
Le Monde.
Ayandegan's headline highlighted a statement
attributed to Khomeini that leftists had nothing to
do with recent assassinations in the country.
Without being specific, Khomeini rejected the
Ayandegan story as false, and said the newspaper
had been "depraved" since the start of the revolu
tion.
Gas station shutdown plan folds
Plans for a shutdown of service stations from
tomorrow through Sunday to protest federal price
controls seemed about to collapse yesterday amid
fears of a consumer backlash and government re
taliation. But many stations may close anyway be
cause they've run out of fuel.
"If they're closed down it will be because
they're out of gas," said James Cresente, executive
director of the Northern Ohio Petroleum Retailers
Association. He said the shutdown proposal "kind
of petered out by the time it got here. Nobody
wanted to go along."
California gas dealers may be the only ones to
participate in the protest, although it is doubtful
whether the leaders of the movement will get the
kind of support they had expected. At one time, at
least two-thirds of California's 14,000 dealers were
expected to hang "closed" signs tomorrow.
In other developments in the gasoline crunch
yesterday:
California Gov. Jerry Brown signed an order re*

quiring some stations in this state to stay open on
weekends regardless of the gasoline shortage.
Thatcher's gov't states position
London — Queen Elizabeth 11, resplendent in
her flowing crimson robe and jeweled imperial
crown, told Britain's new Parliament yesterday
that Conservative Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government planned to cut income
taxes, boost defense spending and curb union
power.
In the traditional opening address, the queen
read a speech prepared by ministers in Thatcher's
new Tory government. There were no surprises.
The new session of Parliament, where the Con
servatives won a 43-seat majority in national elec
tions May 3, is expected to last 18 months of the
government's nominal five-year rule.
When the queen finished, former Prime Minis
ter James Callaghan opened fire as head of the
Labor Party, kicking off a six-day debate on the
speech.
He accused the Tories of planning a selfish soci
ety, and sarcastically said their program meant
"Utopia is going to have to be postponed for a day
or two."
Then Thatcher arose to thunderous Conserva
tive cheers and accused the Laborites of leaving
"the biggest debt round the necks of our chil
dren."
Before concluding her speech, the queen said
the Tories will make "every effort to end the con
flict in Rhodesia and to bring about a lasting set
tlement based on the democratic wishes of the
people of that country."
White seeks manslaughter charge
San Francisco — Saying Dan White will be
punished by the law and God for killing Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, his
defense attorney asked for a jury yesterday to re
turn a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.
Douglas Schmidt, in a sometimes emotional,
hour-long closing statement, admitted that White
"had the intent to kill" when he fired two shots
each into the heads of Moscone and Milk.
However, he argued that White did not pre
meditate the killings and had a diminished mental
capacity which prevented him from weighing the
pros and cons of his acts.
Prosecutor Tom Norman, in a four-hour closing
statement, argued to the contrary, saying the kil
lings of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor
Harvey Milk "amounts to two executions." He

asked the jury to convict White of first degree
murder — a verdict which could result in the death
penalty.
Schmidt said White "is going to be punished.
The law will punish him and God will punish him.
"He's going to have to live with this for the rest
of his life. His child will live with it. His family will
live with it. Please . . . just justice."
Curb calls charges ridiculous
Sacramento — A spokesman for Lt. Gov. Mike
Curb yesterday denied as "ridiculous" allegations
that a record company then headed by Curb made
discount sales to organized crime figures.
"He categorically denies the allegations in the

Sacramento See's account of an Internal Revenue
Service investigation of alleged deals between
MGM Records and four alleged underworld fi
