# Vacations afloat lure the adventurous
## 
### Barry Douglas 
When thinking of a vacation,
people often consider flying to
Hawaii or driving to the Grand
Canyon. But boating, both for
transportation and for fun, can
often be more relaxing and
cheaper, whether in Europe,
the Caribbean or the South
Pacific.
On the more expensive end
of the scale are cruises on ocean
liners. Trips can be taken to
out-of-the-way places like Pago
Pago, Port Said and Micronesia

or spots closer to home like
Seattle, New Orleans or Miami.
Other cruises visit less
frequented tourist spots in
Scandinavia, Antartica and the
African coast.
Shipboard activities range
from swimming to shuffleboard
and golf, vacationers on most
cruise ships are not in the
college-age bracket, because
most students find the price
prohibitive.
But, if the life style appeals,
there's a way to take a cruise

without paying the high costs
— sign on as a hired hand. All
cruise ships need entertainers
— singers, dancers, musicians
and magicians — as well as bar
tenders, waitresses, waiters
and deckhands. Of course,
chances of getting hired de
pend upon talent and experi
ence, but the rewards are great:
luxury cruising while being
paid.
Sailing
For those with a basic
background in sailing, there are

several options for sailing the
high seas in small, but luxuri
ous, sailboats. One of them is to
sign on as delivery crew.
This involves crewing on a
boat being delivered for the
owner from one place to
another. Those interested need
only show up at a port of call
and walk the docks asking if
anyone needs delivery crew.
Yachting magazines, yacht
clubs and boat-harbor bulletin
boards often carry delivery in
formation. After taking the ini
tial steps leading to the first de
livery — no simple task — the
field usually opens up and it be
comes easier to find other boats
in need of crews.
For those wanting to combine
money-making with life at sea,
signing on as a crew member on
a power or sailboat is the ans
wer. Usually more than just a
basic knowledge of boats and
seamanship is required. Room
and board generally is free. A
crewmember eats and sleeps on
the boat if it is big enough.
'Seamester' program
An even more comprehen
sive "package deal" combining
sailing, travel and schooling is
possible with Long Island Uni
versity's "Seamester" prog
ram. This offers a rare oppor
tunity for students who have
completed their freshman year
in college and are interested in
almost any facet of the oceans.
The program includes a 2000-
mile voyage aboard the 100-
foot, two-masted schooner,
Hawey Gamage, along the east
ern U.S. coast and in the Carib

bean Sea.
"Seamester" students study
maritime history and literature
as well as marine ecology,
oceanography, navigation and
seamanship. Up to 16 college
credits can be earned during
eight to nine weeks of work.
The program costs about $3200
for a "seamester" of fun and
adventure at sea.
Racing possibilities
Possibilities for avid offshore
racing enthusiasts — with re
commendations and experi
ence — are wide. There are
good opportunities aboard rac
ing sailboats along the East
Coast and on the Great Lakes
during the summer. Often a
racing crew works, lives and
races aboard the boat. The pay
is usually enough to allow
crewmembers to thoroughly
enjoy the places they visit. The
Southern Ocean Racing Con
ference in Florida every Feb
ruary and March attracts many
top ocean racers and offers an
ideal amalgam of racing and
travel.
One Australian student who
decided to stop-out of school at
the end of his sophomore year
to go ocean racing, started in
Perth and worked his way on
various boats to Florida for the
winter ocean racing. This
summer he is sailing and racing
up the eastern U.S. coast and
then over to Europe for some
more sailing. He has yet to buy
a plane ticket!
A vacation on a boat offers a
kind of adventure, excitement
and class that is hard to match.

sign on as delivery crew.
This involves crewing on a
boat being delivered for the
owner from one place to
another. Those interested need
only show up at a port of call
and walk the docks asking if
anyone needs delivery crew.
Yachting magazines, yacht
clubs and boat-harbor bulletin
boards often carry delivery in
formation. After taking the ini
tial steps leading to the first de
livery — no simple task — the
field usually opens up and it be
comes easier to find other boats
in need of crews.
For those wanting to combine
money-making with life at sea,
signing on as a crew member on
a power or sailboat is the ans
wer. Usually more than just a
basic knowledge of boats and
seamanship is required. Room
and board generally is free. A
crewmember eats and sleeps on
the boat if it is big enough.
'Seamester' program
An even more comprehen
sive "package deal" combining
sailing, travel and schooling is
possible with Long Island Uni
versity's "Seamester" prog
ram. This offers a rare oppor
tunity for students who have
completed their freshman year
in college and are interested in
almost any facet of the oceans.
The program includes a 2000-
mile voyage aboard the 100-
foot, two-masted schooner,
Hawey Gamage, along the east
ern U.S. coast and in the Carib

bean Sea.
"Seamester" students study
maritime history and literature
as well as marine ecology,
oceanography, navigation and
seamanship. Up to 16 college
credits can be earned during
eight to nine weeks of work.
The program costs about $3200
for a "seamester" of fun and
adventure at sea.
Racing possibilities
Possibilities for avid offshore
racing enthusiasts — with re
commendations and experi
ence — are wide. There are
good opportunities aboard rac
ing sailboats along the East
Coast and on the Great Lakes
during the summer. Often a
racing crew works, lives and
races aboard the boat. The pay
is usually enough to allow
crewmembers to thoroughly
enjoy the places they visit. The
Southern Ocean Racing Con
ference in Florida every Feb
ruary and March attracts many
top ocean racers and offers an
ideal amalgam of racing and
travel.
One Australian student who
decided to stop-out of school at
the end of his sophomore year
to go ocean racing, started in
Perth and worked his way on
various boats to Florida for the
winter ocean racing. This
summer he is sailing and racing
up the eastern U.S. coast and
then over to Europe for some
more sailing. He has yet to buy
a plane ticket!
A vacation on a boat offers a
kind of adventure, excitement
and class that is hard to match.

When thinking of a vacation,
people often consider flying to
Hawaii or driving to the Grand
Canyon. But boating, both for
transportation and for fun, can
often be more relaxing and
cheaper, whether in Europe,
the Caribbean or the South
Pacific.
On the more expensive end
of the scale are cruises on ocean
liners. Trips can be taken to
out-of-the-way places like Pago
Pago, Port Said and Micronesia

or spots closer to home like
Seattle, New Orleans or Miami.
Other cruises visit less
frequented tourist spots in
Scandinavia, Antartica and the
African coast.
Shipboard activities range
from swimming to shuffleboard
and golf, vacationers on most
cruise ships are not in the
college-age bracket, because
most students find the price
prohibitive.
But, if the life style appeals,
there's a way to take a cruise

without paying the high costs
— sign on as a hired hand. All
cruise ships need entertainers
— singers, dancers, musicians
and magicians — as well as bar
tenders, waitresses, waiters
and deckhands. Of course,
chances of getting hired de
pend upon talent and experi
ence, but the rewards are great:
luxury cruising while being
paid.
Sailing
For those with a basic
background in sailing, there are

several options for sailing the
high seas in small, but luxuri
ous, sailboats. One of them is to
sign on as delivery crew.
This involves crewing on a
boat being delivered for the
owner from one place to
another. Those interested need
only show up at a port of call
and walk the docks asking if
anyone needs delivery crew.

clubs and boat-harbor bulletin
