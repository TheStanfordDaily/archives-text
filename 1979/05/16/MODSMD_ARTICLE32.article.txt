# Deregulation drops airfares worldwide
## 
### Gayle Mayers 
Sir Freddie Laker, showing the
type of enterprising spirit which
made Britain "Great," sparked an air
fare war when he introduced the
"Skytrain" service in September
1977.
American airlines followed his lead
when the Civil Aeronautics Board
(CAB) began deregulating airlines
two years ago, and airfares have
never been lower than they are this
summer.
Major international carriers such as
Pan American and Trans World Air
lines (TWA) offer Advanced Purchase
Excursion (Apex) fares, but Susan
Maher, assistant manager of Sequoia
Travel here, said that there are very
few APEX and discount tickets avail
able for the summer months.
APEX and discount tickets to Lon
don during June are sold out, Maher
said, but there are still a few spaces to
Brussels, Amsterdam and Asia.
APEX tickets require passengers to
book a round trip with no stopovers,
but the passenger can fly into one city
and return from another, Maher
explained.
Super APEX tickets are cheaper but
require that the return trip begin and
end at the same point, although one
stopover is allowed for an extra $25.
Budget fares
Maher said that Budget fares,
which allow passengers to choose a
week to travel but not a specific de

parture date, must be purchased at
least 21 days in advance and the air
line will notify the passenger 10 days
in advance of the day in the week he
will be leaving.
Late vacation planners may choose
to fly "standby," but Maher warned
that availability is always a problem
during the holiday season.
Maher explained that an airline al
locates a certain percentage of seats
for budget and standby passengers.
Any seats which are not sold to
budget passengers are made available
on a first-come, first-served basis at
the airport on the day of departure.
The airline will not give information
about seat bookings over the tele
phone, so there is no alternative to
going to the airport.
Laker Airways operates daily
standby services out of Los Angeles
and New York to Gatwick, England,
near London.
A spokesman for Laker Airways
said that in an effort to avoid a repeti
tion of the airport chaos which occur
red at times last year, a new system of
ticket sales has been adopted.
Once in possession of a ticket, a
passenger is confirmed on a flight for
the same day, or on the next available
flight. Last year, tickets could only be
purchased on the same day as the
flight.
High demand for flights
Two daily flights will be available
out of New York beginning at the end

of May because of high demand, the
spokesman said.
A one-way flight from Los Angeles
to London costs $248 from June 1
through August 31 and $199 during
the rest of the year. The New York to
London price is $135 all year, and re
turn flights to New York and Los
Angeles are cheaper, depending on
the rate of exchange.
The Council on International Edu
cational Exchange (CIEE), a non
profit student travel agency which
operates domestic and international
charters, still has summer flight tic
kets for sale.
CIEE offers flexibility
Junior Jonathan Cool, Overseas
Opportunity Resource Center travel
advisor and CIEE student representa
tive, said that the CIEE specialties in
providing low-cost charters to major
cities in Europe and that the tickets
allow flexibility of departure and re
turn dates.
Maher said that domestic airfares
are as much as 50 percent cheaper
than last summer if travelers can plan
ahead and make advance purchases.
Domestic flights
Cheap services between the East
and West coasts are offered by CIEE
and World Airways.
CIEE domestic charters offer-direct
service between New York and Low
Angeles and the fare is $105.85 or
$115.85, depending on which day one
flies. CIEE tickets can also be purch

ased in advance. Both agencies are
still accepting reservations.
Airfares may be low, but Maher in
dicated that they are not likely to re
main stable.
Starting May 15, there will be a 4
percent increase on all domestic air
tares because of rising fuel costs, al
though Maher said that domestic
flight prices are guaranteed so that no
surcharge will be levied on tickets
purchased before May 15.
International air fares rose between
four and seven percent on May 1 be
cause of fuel price rises, and airlines
will levy surcharges on tickets
purchased before that date with the
exception of TWA and Pan Am,
which guarantee their original prices.

type of enterprising spirit which
made Britain "Great," sparked an air
fare war when he introduced the
"Skytrain" service in September
1977.
American airlines followed his lead
when the Civil Aeronautics Board
(CAB) began deregulating airlines
two years ago, and airfares have
never been lower than they are this
summer.
Major international carriers such as
Pan American and Trans World Air
lines (TWA) offer Advanced Purchase
Excursion (Apex) fares, but Susan
Maher, assistant manager of Sequoia
Travel here, said that there are very
few APEX and discount tickets avail
able for the summer months.
APEX and discount tickets to Lon
don during June are sold out, Maher
said, but there are still a few spaces to
Brussels, Amsterdam and Asia.
APEX tickets require passengers to
book a round trip with no stopovers,
but the passenger can fly into one city
and return from another, Maher
explained.
Super APEX tickets are cheaper but
require that the return trip begin and
end at the same point, although one
stopover is allowed for an extra $25.
Budget fares
Maher said that Budget fares,
which allow passengers to choose a
week to travel but not a specific de

parture date, must be purchased at
least 21 days in advance and the air
line will notify the passenger 10 days
in advance of the day in the week he
will be leaving.
Late vacation planners may choose
to fly "standby," but Maher warned
that availability is always a problem
during the holiday season.
Maher explained that an airline al
locates a certain percentage of seats
for budget and standby passengers.
Any seats which are not sold to
budget passengers are made available
on a first-come, first-served basis at
the airport on the day of departure.
The airline will not give information
about seat bookings over the tele
phone, so there is no alternative to
going to the airport.
Laker Airways operates daily
standby services out of Los Angeles
and New York to Gatwick, England,
near London.
A spokesman for Laker Airways
said that in an effort to avoid a repeti
tion of the airport chaos which occur
red at times last year, a new system of
ticket sales has been adopted.
Once in possession of a ticket, a
passenger is confirmed on a flight for
the same day, or on the next available
flight. Last year, tickets could only be
purchased on the same day as the
flight.
High demand for flights
Two daily flights will be available
out of New York beginning at the end

of May because of high demand, the
spokesman said.
A one-way flight from Los Angeles
to London costs $248 from June 1
through August 31 and $199 during
the rest of the year. The New York to
London price is $135 all year, and re
turn flights to New York and Los
Angeles are cheaper, depending on
the rate of exchange.
The Council on International Edu
cational Exchange (CIEE), a non
profit student travel agency which
operates domestic and international
charters, still has summer flight tic
kets for sale.
CIEE offers flexibility
Junior Jonathan Cool, Overseas
Opportunity Resource Center travel
advisor and CIEE student representa
tive, said that the CIEE specialties in
providing low-cost charters to major
cities in Europe and that the tickets
allow flexibility of departure and re
turn dates.
Maher said that domestic airfares
are as much as 50 percent cheaper
than last summer if travelers can plan
ahead and make advance purchases.
Domestic flights
Cheap services between the East
and West coasts are offered by CIEE
and World Airways.
CIEE domestic charters offer-direct
service between New York and Low
Angeles and the fare is $105.85 or
$115.85, depending on which day one
flies. CIEE tickets can also be purch

ased in advance. Both agencies are
still accepting reservations.
Airfares may be low, but Maher in
dicated that they are not likely to re
main stable.
Starting May 15, there will be a 4
percent increase on all domestic air
tares because of rising fuel costs, al
though Maher said that domestic
flight prices are guaranteed so that no
surcharge will be levied on tickets
purchased before May 15.
International air fares rose between
four and seven percent on May 1 be
cause of fuel price rises, and airlines
will levy surcharges on tickets
purchased before that date with the
exception of TWA and Pan Am,
which guarantee their original prices.
