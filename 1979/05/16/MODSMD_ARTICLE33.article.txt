# Experience rural life in America-take a bike
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
After spending days cooped
up in Meyer cramming for
exams, few find the prospect of
a glorious summer between
four walls exhilarating? Why
not cast off the chains of
slave-driving capitalism and
capture the natural beauty of
America's wilderness under
your own power? Live a little
for a change, and try biking it.
There are two types of tour
ing, according to Alan Wachtel
of the bicycle club, Western
Wheelers. The cycler can either
carry his own immediate needs
and luxuriate in the amenities

offered by restaurants and
hotels, or, at the other extreme,
one can completely wing it and
camp out.
In the latter case, a major
concern is "what kind of
equipment to take and how to
carry it," Wachtel said. "How
much to carry is a matter of in
dividual choice. I've known of
people who carry as much as
100 pounds, which is enorm
ous," he added.
Junior Bill Gail, who hiked
from Boston to Portland in 36
days with two friends in 1975,
said they each totaled around
10 pounds, a much more
reasonable amount.
Another consideration is ob
vious — a bike. Janice Tu, who

traveled the Bikecentennial
Trail from Reedsport, Oregon,
to Yorktown, Virginia, in its
inaugural year of 1976, em
phasized the need for a good
bike. Freshman Sam Howe,
the veteran of a 500-mile,
one-week excursion along the
Oregon coastline, agreed "If
you have a good bike, age, sex
and size don't make a differ
ence," he said.
Bike selection
Wachtel outlined the basic
components of a touring bike in
laymen's terms: a bike with a
soft, stable ride and generally
wide gearing (both very high

and very low).
Choice of a saddle again de
pends upon individual taste but
is essential. "You can't assume
that a saddle that is comfortable
for 10 miles will be comfortable
for 100 miles a day, day after
day," Wachtel said.
"Women should consider
looking into special women's
saddles on the market in bike
shops," according to Wachtel.
"Women have wider pelvises
than men, so a traditional
men's saddle will be too nar
row." Tu said that her saddle
hadn't been broken in properly
when she began her venture,
and, as a result, she suffered
the painful consequences for
the first part of her 82-day trip.

To plan a route, "you need
the best possible map of the
area — a topographical map
from the Geographical Survey
in Menlo Park," Wachtel said.
Secondary roads are preferable
because highways are too heav
ily traveled by automobiles,
and smaller roads tend to climb
too much and are not smooth.
Conditioning
Wachtel emphasized the im
portance of physical training
before attempting a long bike
tour. Running will help because
cardiovascular fitness is vital,
but it won't develop the right
leg muscles, he said. Therefore,
"in preparation, you do have to
bike.
"Almost no one is ready at
the beginning of a tour, and you
can break yourself in by tour
ing," Wachtel said. But you can
help yourself by gradually
building up biking distances on
a packed bike, according to
Wachtel. "You will be misera
ble otherwise," he warned.
Howe, Tu and Gail said that
they were all involved in cross
country running and were,
thus, in good physical condi
tion. Gail said that he had done
no bike training.
"It's more being able to put
up with unexpected events
than being in shape," he said.
Yet, biking "totally changes
your muscle structure. Getting
back in shape for cross-country
after his 90-miles average a day
tour was the worst agony I've
been through in my life," Gail
said.
Howe said that some of the
six people in his group "hadn't
trained at all." He explained
that "It's not a tiring thing once
you get going. We were having
such a good time that we didn't
mind getting up early and being
exhausted at night. As soon as
we got back, we were incredibly
tired." Howe's group began at
the leisurely pace of around 30
to4o miles a day and worked up
to 100 miles in one day (a cen
tury) at the end.
Tu's organized tour of 15
people, ranging in age from 14
to 36, displayed a large variety
of biking experience. Still, they
finished the 4450-mile jaunt
largely intact and accomplished
two centuries in Kansas, where
hills are virtually non-existent.

The same Bikecentennial or
ganization with which Tu
traveled has since expanded its
routes and will offer nine diffe
rent routes and about 50 guided
trips this summer. Prices vary
from $134 for a 12-day loop
around Oregon to $898 for the
Trans-America Trail version.
Gail said he traveled on his
own for about $200.
The Bikecentennial way, you
do the pedaling and leave the
intricate planning to the ex
perts. "It was a lot of fun," Tu
reminisced of her experience.
"It was good for me to have the
structure. If I did it again, I'd
just go with some friends on my
own."
Have it your way
Should you be daring
enough to plan a trip yourself,
Wachtel recommended several
sources of reference: Bicycle
Touring in Europe by Hawkins,
Two-Wheel Travel by Peter Toby,

Bike World magazine, available
on the shelves in Meyer and
Bicycling magazine.
"The best part was planning
it," said Gail, who had mapped
out his trip with his friends for
about nine months. "We were
better prepared than anyone
we met," he said.
On that score, Howe, Tu and
Gail all commented on the
friendliness of people in rural
communities toward bikers.
"The people just amazed me,"
Gail said. "The best place for
biking as far as people are con
cerned is South Dakota," he
concluded.
All three told stories of free
refreshments ana humorous
incidents along the way. Al
though none had ever before
journeyed a comparable dis
tance on a bike, they unanim
ously agreed that they would
do it again, given the time,
energy and money.
