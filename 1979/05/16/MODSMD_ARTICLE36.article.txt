# Paris stay transforms American tourist

### Karen Veninga 
A new American in Paris!Mes
felicitations!
Get out European Ten Dollarsa
Day and see the sights. The Eif
fel Tower. The Louvre. The
Champs Elysees. Notre Dame.
This first stage of the Ameri
can's stay, the "I'm going to see
everything" stage, engulfs him
in culture, art and history. If he
is diligent, he will learn that
once only Latin was spoken in

The dozen jacket and tennis shoes reappear but
he no longer feels self-conscious in them.

the Latin Quarter and that most
museums in Paris are free on
Sundays.
If he likes fine art, he will
begin with the Louvre, Jeu de
Paume and the Rodin and
Cluny museums. Instead of
art history slides of the
Winged Victory, the Mona Lisa
and Manet's "The Fifer," these
museums have the real thing.
Besides visiting the art
museums, he climbs the bell
towers of Notre Dame. The
steep steps are a throwback to
the Middle Ages. Where else
can one look out over Paris from
behind the shoulder of a
friendly gargoyle?
Soon the new American in
Paris reaches the second stage,
the "I'm going to be a Parisian"
stage. He roams around the
Latin Quarter and talks of
socialism and French politics.
Tennis shoes and down jackets
remain in the closet while long
scarves and tight jeans appear
overnight. He prefers wine to
beer, French movies to Ameri
can television and looks aghast
at joggers.
The new American in Paris

meets a lot of Parisians at this
stage and enjoys guitar con
certs, cabarets and cafes. To
find the Parisians' Paris, he
walks through the Latin Quar
ter, the artists' section of Mon
martre, and the slightly
hedonistic Montparnasse. He
wanders through the narrow
streets, especially Rue Mouf
fetard, and into the small
shops. Takes a picnic to the
Luxembourg gardens. Hag

gles at the flea market.
In the last stage of his stay,
the American in Paris is in the
"I'm not French, but I belong
here anyway" stage. The city
somehow becomes his own. He
gives tourists directions to the
Louvre and waves to his waiter
friend. The down jacket and
tennis shoes reappear, but he
no longer feels self-conscious in
them.
Feeling at ease in a foreign
capital takes time. Getting
away from the famous monu
ments and museums for a little
while is rewarding and fun.
Rue Daguerre in the 14th sec
tion of Paris has a street market
on Tuesday and Thursday
nights where two massive
Frenchmen shout obscenities at
each other over their tangerines
and camembert. When the
"seasoned" American walks
by, these two Parisians cease
their banter, shouting "Bon
soir" in unison, and then
switch back to their insults and
bitter back-biting, Notre
Dame, these two merchants,
and the American share some
thing: Paris.
