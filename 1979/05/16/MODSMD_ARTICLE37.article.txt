# Sicily welcomes visitors
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
When visiting Italy, Sicily is a must. Sicilia in
Italian, La bella Sicilia.
To those of us who have been there, there is
no excuse for not visiting Sicily. We cannot
understand why most of Italy considers this
Mediterranean island a part of Africa.
We cannot believe it when people say "Sic
ily? That's where the Mafia started!" and re
fuse to visit the island on those grounds.
We cannot believe it when women get skit
tish and repeat all the rumors they've heard
about lecherous young Italian men and heavy
old women in traditional black garb.
This is not to say that Sicily is not backward.
In many ways, the island is still in the 19th
century. However, cut off physically, as well
as politically and culturally, from the rest of
Italy, it has done quite well for itself.
There are roads. And trains. And boats and
telephones and all the other amenities of life.
Mafia began here
And it isn't to say that the Mafia didn't start
here. La Cosa Nostra is almost the establish
ment of Sicily. When the government in Rome
thinks you are part of Africa, you have to take
care of yourself.
And yes, there are lots of young men. But
pick your company carefully , and you can
have the time of your life.
And the heavy old women in black?
Everywhere. But they would sooner offer you
their home, their table and their bed than the
average Fiorentino (Florentine) would say
"Buongiorno" (good morning).
Especially if you can mutter a few words of
halting Italian. They'll love you.
Warm southerners
Sicilians, and Sicily itself, due in part to
being further south than the rest of Italy, are
the wa. mest people in that boot-shaped coun
try.
Unfortunately, Sicily is and has been much
maligned by the ignorant and the misin
formed.
Where else but in Mazzara del Vallo, on the
southwestern coast, would a family take in
five wandering students overnight, stuff them
with fish bought still wet from the sea, yards

and yards of dark red pork sausage, and top
that with the old grandfather's spaghetti con
allio ed olio (with garlic and olive oil), leaving
them so stuffed they could barely walk and
still offer more?
Where else but Palermo could one amble
through the open market, stop to fill all one's

The noticeable aspect of Sicily,
especially outside the cities, is
the people. They live as no other
Italians know how.

mottles with vino rosso (red wine) at the can
tina, and be startled by eating and actually
enjoying chitlins served by a hand scalded red
by years of reaching into the steam basket?
Wine sampling
Where else but Marsala could one sample 15
varieties of Marsala wine, ranging from egg
and licorice flavors to coffee and banana, and
get sent back on the road with several bottles
more?
Where else but the island of Vulcano would
an old and weatherbeaten fisherman named
Domenico make one swim through dark
lava-formed grottoes, act as guide on a tour of
"his" island, then fry up a fish lunch even
Poseidon would envy?
The noticeable aspect of Sicily, especially
outside the cities, is the people. They live as
no other Italian knows how.
One thing missing is museums. The
only historical or artistic relics on the island
are the Roman ruins in Syracuse and the tem
ples of Agrigento. For ruins, go to Rome. And
for museums, go to Florence.
But in Sicily, go for the people. And go
soon. Because development is coming for Sic
ily, and development will change its personal
ity. Though the sun may still shine, the
warmth may soon be lost.
So go. And buoti viaggio, amici!

Italians know how.

mottles with vino rosso (red wine) at the can
tina, and be startled by eating and actually
enjoying chitlins served by a hand scalded red
by years of reaching into the steam basket?
Wine sampling
Where else but Marsala could one sample 15
varieties of Marsala wine, ranging from egg
and licorice flavors to coffee and banana, and
get sent back on the road with several bottles
more?
Where else but the island of Vulcano would
an old and weatherbeaten fisherman named
Domenico make one swim through dark
lava-formed grottoes, act as guide on a tour of
"his" island, then fry up a fish lunch even
Poseidon would envy?
The noticeable aspect of Sicily, especially
outside the cities, is the people. They live as
no other Italian knows how.
One thing missing is museums. The
only historical or artistic relics on the island
are the Roman ruins in Syracuse and the tem
ples of Agrigento. For ruins, go to Rome. And
for museums, go to Florence.
But in Sicily, go for the people. And go
soon. Because development is coming for Sic
ily, and development will change its personal
ity. Though the sun may still shine, the
warmth may soon be lost.
So go. And buoti viaggio, amici!
