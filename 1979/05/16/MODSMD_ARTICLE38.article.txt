# Kibbutzim and digs
## Work shapes Israeli fun 
### Seth Zuckerman 
Israel. For many, the word
conjures up images of terrorist
attacks and camels roaming the
streets. But these do not charac
terize the country — they are
largely exaggerations.
Other preconceptions de
serve a little explanation. The
tirst question asked of anyone
who has lived in Israel is invari
ably, "Oh! Did you live on a
kibbutz?"
Kibbutzim
Yes, the kibbut/ (plural.kib
butzim) is indeed alive and well

and living in Israel, though only
four percent of the population
lives on one. Kibbutzim are
largely agriculture-based col
lective settlements, where
everybody shares the work and
the wealth. All major decisions
are made by the entire kibbutz.
At almost all kibbutzim the
children are raised in nurseries
with their peers, not by their
parents.
For Americans, though, one
of the most important facets of
kibbutzim is their volunteer

policy. Because much of their
work is seasonal, they take on
volunteers, usually from over
seas, who work for their room
and board.
Kibbutzim employ volun
teers through two programs,
according to Gale Antokal of
the San Francisco Aliyah
Center.
Two kibbutzim programs
The first is the temporary
worker program, which entails
a commitment of at least tine
month of six-day, 45-hour
workweeks. Volunteers have

the option of extending their
stay for as long as they want,
she said. A small allowance is
paid, enough "for candy bars
and toothbrushes," according
to Antokal.
The other program is the
kibbutz-ulpan, whose object is
to both introduce people to the
kibbutz culture and teach them
Hebrew in the five- or six
month duration.
Participants in the kibbutz
ulpan programs divide their
time between work on the kib

but/ and studying Hebrew.
They are adopted by kibbutz
families to ease their social in
teraction with Israelis, Antokal
said, and "to have coffee and
cake with them on Saturday af
ternoons."
Advance applications
There is no charge for this
program, according to Antokal,
but it is usually necessary to
apply at least three months in
advance. Programs begin on a
staggered basis — seven or
eight kibbutzim start the cycle
each month.
She said it still would be pos
sible to be placed on a kibbutz
on the temporary-work prog
ram for the earlier part of the
summer, and explained the ar
rangements for that proceed
through the central Aliyah Of
fice in New York, not through
the San Francisco branch, as is
the case with kibbutz-ulpan.
There is much more to Israel
than kibbutzim, however.
Another common pursuit for
American college students visit
ing Israel is archaeological ex
cavations. There are usually at
least 10 volunteer-taking
"digs" every summer in Israel,
sponsored by both Israeli and
American universities.
Archeological opportunities
Most archeological programs
can be taken for credit, usually
transferable from the sponsor
ing university and, liketheones
affiliated with Tel Aviv Univer
sity, require a fee of a few
hundred dollars to cover room
and board charges.
All prospective diggers
should be prepared for seven
hour workdays moving earth
under the hot Israeli summer
sun and should not be deceived
by stereoptypical images of
volunteers delicately brushing
away at mosaic floors, accord
ing to George Kelm of the New
Orleans Baptist Theological
Seminary, head of the excava
tions at Tel Batashi, between

Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. That
step does come, but only after
much backbreaking work, he
said.

are not confined to the or
ganized options alone.
Travel
Many students pass through
Isarel on their way east from
Europe, and for others it is but a
short detour from Athens. Stu
dents can get by cheaply in Is
rael. With an International Stu
dent Card, they can stay at
youth hostels for reasonable
rates, and hitchhiking is not dif
ficult there. A fine, although

chaotic, bus system provides
60-mile rides for under $1 (as of
last summer). The crime rate is
not high enough to proscribe
camping out on beaches or in

parks.
According to David Parnes of
the International Travel Bureau
in San Francisco, one of the
cheapest ways to fly to Israel
from the West Coast is to take a
charter to London (for $500 to
$550 round-trip) and then a
youth flight from there (a total
of about $820 round-trip). Even
cheaper, he said, would be to
take a standby or budget flight
to London, saving another $100
to $150.

everybody shares the work and
the wealth. All major decisions
are made by the entire kibbutz.
At almost all kibbutzim the
children are raised in nurseries
with their peers, not by their
parents.
For Americans, though, one
of the most important facets of
kibbutzim is their volunteer

policy. Because much of their
work is seasonal, they take on
volunteers, usually from over
seas, who work for their room
and board.
Kibbutzim employ volun
teers through two programs,
according to Gale Antokal of
the San Francisco Aliyah
Center.
Two kibbutzim programs
The first is the temporary
worker program, which entails
a commitment of at least tine
month of six-day, 45-hour
workweeks. Volunteers have

the option of extending their
stay for as long as they want,
she said. A small allowance is
paid, enough "for candy bars
and toothbrushes," according
to Antokal.
The other program is the
kibbutz-ulpan, whose object is
to both introduce people to the
kibbutz culture and teach them
Hebrew in the five- or six
month duration.
Participants in the kibbutz
ulpan programs divide their
time between work on the kib

but/ and studying Hebrew.
They are adopted by kibbutz
families to ease their social in
teraction with Israelis, Antokal
said, and "to have coffee and
cake with them on Saturday af
ternoons."
Advance applications
There is no charge for this
program, according to Antokal,
but it is usually necessary to
apply at least three months in
advance. Programs begin on a
staggered basis — seven or
eight kibbutzim start the cycle
each month.
She said it still would be pos
sible to be placed on a kibbutz
on the temporary-work prog
ram for the earlier part of the
summer, and explained the ar
rangements for that proceed
through the central Aliyah Of
fice in New York, not through
the San Francisco branch, as is
the case with kibbutz-ulpan.
There is much more to Israel
than kibbutzim, however.
Another common pursuit for
American college students visit
ing Israel is archaeological ex
cavations. There are usually at
least 10 volunteer-taking
"digs" every summer in Israel,
sponsored by both Israeli and
American universities.
Archeological opportunities
Most archeological programs
can be taken for credit, usually
transferable from the sponsor
ing university and, liketheones
affiliated with Tel Aviv Univer
sity, require a fee of a few
hundred dollars to cover room
and board charges.
All prospective diggers
should be prepared for seven
hour workdays moving earth
under the hot Israeli summer
sun and should not be deceived
by stereoptypical images of
volunteers delicately brushing
away at mosaic floors, accord
ing to George Kelm of the New
Orleans Baptist Theological
Seminary, head of the excava
tions at Tel Batashi, between

Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. That
step does come, but only after
much backbreaking work, he
said.

are not confined to the or
ganized options alone.
Travel
Many students pass through
Isarel on their way east from
Europe, and for others it is but a
short detour from Athens. Stu
dents can get by cheaply in Is
rael. With an International Stu
dent Card, they can stay at
youth hostels for reasonable
rates, and hitchhiking is not dif
ficult there. A fine, although

chaotic, bus system provides
60-mile rides for under $1 (as of
last summer). The crime rate is
not high enough to proscribe
camping out on beaches or in

parks.
According to David Parnes of
the International Travel Bureau
in San Francisco, one of the
cheapest ways to fly to Israel
from the West Coast is to take a
charter to London (for $500 to
$550 round-trip) and then a
youth flight from there (a total
of about $820 round-trip). Even
cheaper, he said, would be to
take a standby or budget flight
to London, saving another $100
to $150.

Israel. For many, the word
conjures up images of terrorist
attacks and camels roaming the
streets. But these do not charac
terize the country — they are
largely exaggerations.
Other preconceptions de
serve a little explanation. The
tirst question asked of anyone
who has lived in Israel is invari
ably, "Oh! Did you live on a
kibbutz?"
Kibbutzim
Yes, the kibbut/ (plural.kib
butzim) is indeed alive and well

and living in Israel, though only
four percent of the population
lives on one. Kibbutzim are
largely agriculture-based col
lective settlements, where
everybody shares the work and
the wealth. All major decisions
are made by the entire kibbutz.

with their peers, not by their
