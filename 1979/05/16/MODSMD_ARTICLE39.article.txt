# A
						personal perspective
## Greece retains beauty despite 'touristocracy' 
### Michael Economides 
In the southeast corner of
Europe there is a country which
looks as if it had been
"wrenched violently away from
the mainland and broken into
two thousand rocky pieces,
scattered over the blue sea,
right up to the shores of
Asia. . It is as if Zeus, from
the peak of Mount Olympus,
had shaken and split the earth
into terrible, jagged shapes.
The civilization, like the land

on which it came into existence,
also has been dispersed far and
wide. This was a people of
shepherds, traders and war
riors, who created the essence
of western civilization; its
philosophy, politics, poetry
and theater. The mythology
nurtured there has inspired
2000 years of western art. The
language has roots which, at
this very moment, are still in
spiring the vocabulary of the
Western World.
This country is Greece.
Modern Greece is a young
nation with a turbulent 150-

year history, complete with
foreign interventions, military
coups and civil wars. Today,
after all these misadventures,
the land is experiencing grow
ing pains.
Questionable priorities often
have propelled the country into
uncontrollable "development".
Much of the area around
Athens has been ravished by
pollution. The enchanted
Saronikos Bay, south of Attica,
has become a dead sea. Athens
itself is a decaying city. The
smog, registering 180-300 mil
ligrams of sulfur dioxide per
cubic meter of air, is four times
the level that the World Health
Organization considers safe.
More than 40 percent of the
Greeks live in Athens and im
migration to the city does not
seem to lessen. The chaos is in
such a terminal stage that a
Greek prime minister once
said, "The only solution to
Athens would be to demolish
half of it and start all over
again."
Beauty incarnate
In spite of Athens, Greece is
beauty incarnate. Traveling
through Greece I gradually
began to see with my eyes and
touch with my hands some
thing that abstract thought
cannot touch or see: the means
by which strength and grace
combine in the austere yet
ever-smiling land of Greece.
Some of its regions are severe
and haughty, others full of ten
derness, still others serious and
at the same time cheerful. To
travel through Greece is a true
joy.
Touristocracy
I am no great fan of the touris
tocracy that has so tarnished

Greece. Before the bermuda
clad tourist with his three hang
ing cameras made Greece an
"in" spot, the country was un
spoiled, the beaches never saw
a beer can and the peasants
overflowed with purity and
Zorba.
For the tourist ready to em
bark on a pilgrimage to Greece,
a few suggestions:
Avoid Athens.
Greece can be expensive for
the Hilton Hotel crowd, yet it's
one of the best bargains in
Europe for the "do-it
yourselfer". Campgrounds are
available and youth hostels are
in every town.
Join others
Young American tourists can
benefit a lot if they join teams of
northern European and particu
larly German tourists. They
seem to have a good sense of
where to go and what to do.
The Greek government has
initiated an ambitious plan to
reconstruct villages deserted by
the massive flight of the young
to Athens. These places will be
either available for tourist visits
this summer or they will be still
rebuilding, providing oppor
tunities forvacation jobs forone
more summer.
Varied landscapes
In spite of its relatively small
size, Greece has a wide variety
of climates and landscapes. The
Mediterranean appearance of
southern Attica and Pelopon
nese is nowhere to be found in
the Central European land
scapes of Macedonia and
Thrace.
There are hundreds of is
lands scattered over the blue
sea. A trip toGreece is unthink
able without a brief visit to one

or another of these
islands. The choice of island
and means of transporation
varies.
Some travelers to the islands
take night steamers on which
passengers, baggage and as
sorted poultry are all piled up
together. These ships keep the
craziest time-tables, usually
leaving an island for the next
stop in the dead of night. The
Sporades, the closest island
chain, just east of the mainland,
contains some jewels.
Life is simple; many islands
do not have electricity or run

ning water but they offer stun
ning beauty and impeccable
Greek hospitality.
In the map accompanying
this article 1 have shaded the
areas 1 feel would be most in
teresting and least spoiled. I do
this with the bitter realization
that once they are discovered
by the many they may cease to
be.
To all those who read these
lines and plan to visit Greece,
an appeal and a wish. Treat the
country with awe, for the ecol
ogy is delicate and the transient
visitors are many.
