# Booklet on rape wins award
## 'Working Against Rape' authored by women's collective 
### Karen Kraus 
"Working Against Rape," a booklet written by a col
lective of current and former women students here,
recently won a national award in a contest of student
publications sponsored by the National Student Educa
tional Fund in Washington, D.C.
The award was announced during a reception held last
Friday in Storey House for the members of women's
groups here. In a short speech, Pat Brandt, activities
advisor in the Office of Student Activities, commended
the progress women's organizations have made this past
year. She noted changes in attitude, such as a growing
openness among women on campus, and a coupling of
feminist goals to those of the fight against racism.
The booklet was one of the 12 winners in the "Better
Information Project — Prize in Education" category.
In an interview, Alison Browne, Laurie Foster and Sally
Edwards discussed the history and purpose of their
booklet. Three other members of the collective, lane
Benson, Kimberly Bancroft and Lori Parmer, were not
present. All six women are current or former University
students.
The group was informed of the decision May 10.
The inspiration for the project came in part as a re
sponse to a pamphlet on rape put out a few years earlier
by another group here. Browne described it as in
adequate, and said she thought it was not taken seri
ously by the campus community. The authors felt the
issue needed a different, more thoughtful approach, not
only including research on the act of rape, but incor
porating the underlying social and political aspects as
well.
Three objectives
With this perspective, the authors viewed their objec
tives as threefold: to take the issue seriously, talk openly
about it, and to encourage others to take responsibility.
Rape exists on two levels. Above all, rape is a reality; it
can happen to anybody, and people have to know how
to deal with it. The other area is more theoretical and has
to do with an examination of cultural attitudes and the
question "why does rape happen?" The booklet dealt
with the precautions a woman can take, but stressed that
these were preventitive steps rather than a cure to the
problem.

Foster hoped that the booklet heightened people's
awareness of the paradox that exists in the need for
women to be safe and at the same time be able to
express their individuality without fear.
Browne thought the booklet was well received and
that the response from the community was positive.
Laurie Foster added that it helped to catalyze the current
rape education project. Over 15,000 copies have been
printed to date, and have been distributed throughout
the University community.
'True collective'
The authors called the booklet a product of a "true
collective." It was originated in spring 1976 by Edwards,
Benson and other members of the SWOPSI course
"Strategies Within Feminism" as a class project. During
that time much of the funding was obtained from the
Student Center for Innovation and Research in Educa
tion, SWOPSI, the Stanford Women's Center, the Office
of Residential Education, the Center for Research on
Women and the Office of Student Activities.
The following fall the group reorganized and began
the actual writing. Though each of the women took a
chapter and topic of research, the process of putting the
book together was a group effort. Browne described the
wording as deliberate, and designed to reach a lot of
people.
The award money will be used to further the project.
The group has already begun work on a videotape about
rape. With this, the women hope to expand the variety
of topics, concentrating on other issues that they feel
could perhaps be better explored in a film. Possible
areas to be included are coping strategies and discus
sions with rape victims on their feelings. The group also
hopes to place greater emphasis on the attitudes of men
towards rape. They are attempting to find funds for the
videotape.
At the Storey House reception, Brandt also stated that
there are now over 30 groups on campus dealing specifi
cally with the concerns of women. Especially within
academic departments, groups such as Women in En
gineering and Science, and Stanford Women in Law,
have formed to provide support for women in academic
areas. She also acknowledged the progress of sororities
in trying to build a new tradition here.

academic departments, groups such as Women in En
gineering and Science, and Stanford Women in Law,
have formed to provide support for women in academic
areas. She also acknowledged the progress of sororities
in trying to build a new tradition here.
"Working Against Rape," a booklet written by a col
lective of current and former women students here,
recently won a national award in a contest of student
publications sponsored by the National Student Educa
tional Fund in Washington, D.C.
The award was announced during a reception held last
Friday in Storey House for the members of women's
groups here. In a short speech, Pat Brandt, activities
advisor in the Office of Student Activities, commended
the progress women's organizations have made this past
year. She noted changes in attitude, such as a growing
openness among women on campus, and a coupling of
feminist goals to those of the fight against racism.
The booklet was one of the 12 winners in the "Better
Information Project — Prize in Education" category.
In an interview, Alison Browne, Laurie Foster and Sally
Edwards discussed the history and purpose of their
booklet. Three other members of the collective, lane
Benson, Kimberly Bancroft and Lori Parmer, were not
present. All six women are current or former University
students.
The group was informed of the decision May 10.
The inspiration for the project came in part as a re
sponse to a pamphlet on rape put out a few years earlier
by another group here. Browne described it as in
adequate, and said she thought it was not taken seri
ously by the campus community. The authors felt the
issue needed a different, more thoughtful approach, not
only including research on the act of rape, but incor
porating the underlying social and political aspects as
well.
Three objectives
With this perspective, the authors viewed their objec
tives as threefold: to take the issue seriously, talk openly
about it, and to encourage others to take responsibility.
Rape exists on two levels. Above all, rape is a reality; it
can happen to anybody, and people have to know how
to deal with it. The other area is more theoretical and has
to do with an examination of cultural attitudes and the
question "why does rape happen?" The booklet dealt
with the precautions a woman can take, but stressed that
these were preventitive steps rather than a cure to the
problem.

Foster hoped that the booklet heightened people's
awareness of the paradox that exists in the need for
women to be safe and at the same time be able to
express their individuality without fear.
Browne thought the booklet was well received and
that the response from the community was positive.
Laurie Foster added that it helped to catalyze the current
rape education project. Over 15,000 copies have been
printed to date, and have been distributed throughout
the University community.
'True collective'
The authors called the booklet a product of a "true
collective." It was originated in spring 1976 by Edwards,
Benson and other members of the SWOPSI course
"Strategies Within Feminism" as a class project. During
that time much of the funding was obtained from the
Student Center for Innovation and Research in Educa
tion, SWOPSI, the Stanford Women's Center, the Office
of Residential Education, the Center for Research on
Women and the Office of Student Activities.
The following fall the group reorganized and began
the actual writing. Though each of the women took a
chapter and topic of research, the process of putting the
book together was a group effort. Browne described the
wording as deliberate, and designed to reach a lot of
people.
The award money will be used to further the project.
The group has already begun work on a videotape about
rape. With this, the women hope to expand the variety
of topics, concentrating on other issues that they feel
could perhaps be better explored in a film. Possible
areas to be included are coping strategies and discus
sions with rape victims on their feelings. The group also
hopes to place greater emphasis on the attitudes of men
towards rape. They are attempting to find funds for the
videotape.
At the Storey House reception, Brandt also stated that
there are now over 30 groups on campus dealing specifi
cally with the concerns of women. Especially within
academic departments, groups such as Women in En
gineering and Science, and Stanford Women in Law,
have formed to provide support for women in academic
areas. She also acknowledged the progress of sororities
