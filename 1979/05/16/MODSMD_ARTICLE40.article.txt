# Syrian markets bustle among ancient ruins

"Allahu akbar," (God is great) the Urn
mayad mosque's caller begins his cry at
dawn urging the faithful to prayer. Pious
Syrian Moslems face Mecca, unroll their
mats and kneel to pray. In Damascus, the
capital of Syria, old Middle Eastern tradi
tions thrive.
At the Souk (bazaar) Hamadiyah, ven
dors set up their displays of fruits, crafts
and gold in the early morning sunlight. By
8:30 the souk throngs with merchants and
shoppers animatedly bargaining over
prices.
Travelers, like the Syrians, must bargain
before buying. For students accustomed to
the sterile environs of an American super
market, haggling over the prices can be a
refreshing turn. Though all the prices seem
low to Americans, bargaining can usually
cut the inflated tourist figures in half.
Hand woven kaftans, brass and wood
work, and gold jewelry are among the best
buys for Americans visiting Syria. But en
joyable shopping is only one ofSyria's allur
ing features.
Damascus, in southwest Syria, is one of
the world's oldest centers of civilization.
The sights speak of the nation's rich history
and culture. The Ummayad mosque, the

Roman second century east gate, and St.
Paul's church are testimony to the city's
Moslem, Roman, and Christian past. The
Azem palace and the National Museum are
among the favorite tourist spots in Damas
cus.
The traditional neighborhoods of Hiaq A 1
Mohafreen and Ahu Romana still display
the flavor of the ancient Mideast.
North of Damascus lies Palmyra, Queen
Zenobia's ancient capital. This beautiful
oasis contains extensive ruins of many
Roman temples. The city of Aleppo lies
further north, and is noted for the Great
Mosque and its bustling bazaars.
Damascus International Airport is the
gateway to Syria for most American
tourists. Airfare from San Francisco to
Damascus is about $1000. A tourist visa is
required, and can be obtained from the Sy
rian embassy in Washington. Taxis and
buses serve the airport 24 hours a day, for
the 15-mile drive into the city.
Transporation by bus or taxi is both cheap
and accessible in Syria. As most Syrians do
not own cars, sharing taxis with strangers is
common.
Limited night life
Entertainment and night life in Damascus
is limited by Western standards. English
and French films are shown every night.

This paucity is more than compensated by
the abundance of delicious food and entic
ing restaurants.
Syrian lamb, chicken, and rice dishes
tempt the most resolute dieters. Meat dis
hes, hufta and kabab and Samadie sweets
are highly recommended. Fruit is both plen
tiful and choice, with Syrian apricots, dates
and watermelons winning high praise.

The Syrian climate ranges from Mediter
ranean warmth in the west to arid desert
heat in the east. Summer temperatures
reach 110° F in some places, while the
winter cold can drop to below freezing.
Dress comfortably in Syria, but re
member that local standards are conserva
tive relative to American mores. Jeans are
tolerated if worn by Americans.
