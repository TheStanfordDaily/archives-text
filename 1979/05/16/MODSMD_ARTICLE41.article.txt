# Expect the unexpected in the Soviet Union
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The one thing you can be cer
tain of on a trip to the Soviet
Union is uncertainty. Soviet of
ficials of all kinds are unpre
dictable. Reservations may be
changed or canceled without
notice at hotels and restaurants.
Schedules may be altered fre
quently. Rules and restrictions
are numerous and new ones are
announced unexpectedly.
Tourists in the Soviet Union
must quickly learn to roll with
the punches. Complaints
should be saved only for truly
important problems. Despite
the many inconveniences and
privations of a visit to Russia,
the trip can be immensely
worthwhile.
Visiting the Soviet Union is
an eye-opening experience.
The country lies on the plain
where Europe flows into Asia,
where the East truly begins.
Russia's location and history
have set it apart from Western
Europe and Western notions of
life fade as one approaches.
Options for the traveler range
from four-month-long lan
guage study programs, which
include travel, to eight-day
excursions. Study programs are
the best way to experience the
Soviet Union.
Such programs afford a
chance to live in Russia in one
place, usually neara university,
long enough to get to know a
tew Russians well.
Warmth, generosity
If it seems improbable to you
that an American could get to
know several Russians well in a
couple of months, it is probably

because the Western image of
the Russians is that they are
stern and cool. Publicly they are
rather more stoical than we are
for they have been hardened by
a life that is considerably more
difficult. Privately, however,
they display immense warmth
and generosity.
For those who know the lan
guage well enough, many
nights will be spent talking with
Russians, drinking inordinate
amounts of vodka and eating
loaves of Russian black bread.

... it is difficult to abide by all laws and restric
tions. If you do stick strictly to 'what is al
lowed,' you may end up seeing Russia almost
entirely from the seat of a tour bus.

Those students who fear that
the expense of study programs
may be too great should know
that financial aid is often availa
ble through the sponsoring in
stitution and through federal
government student-aid pro
grams. The cost can be anywhere
from $2(X)0 to $5000 depending
on the length of stay and the
amount of travel.
Only certain travel agencies
deal with Intourist, the Soviet
tourist agency. The home travel
agency usually arranges every
thing with Intourist and secures
visas for persons in a group.
Touring
The current eight-day tour
arranged by One World Service
in San Francisco costs $375 and
the 15-day tour costs $654,

excluding transportation to or
from the Soviet Union.
Individual touring is possi
ble, but not advisable except for
those with a good knowledge of
Russian. Moreover, a day-by
day itinerary must be agreed on
with Intourist before entering
the country and adhered to
strictly. Since one would not be
traveling with an Intourist
guide, it would be necessary to
register with Intourist at each
stop.
I could offer a series of warn
ings here, but if you go on a

group tour or a study program,
you will probably be
thoroughly briefed on do's and
don'ts for visitors to the Soviet
Union.
There are so many things,
however, that are illegal or that
tourists are discouraged from
doing, that it is difficult to abide
by all laws and restrictions. If
you do stick strictly to "what is
allowed," you may end up se
eing Russia almost entirely

from the seat of a tour bus.
Discretion is key
You will generally be dis
couraged, for instance, from
meeting Soviet citizens other
than the ones they want you to
meet. If you are discreet, how
ever, neither you nor your
friends are likely to get in trou
ble. Being discreet is the key to
overcoming restrictions placed
on you.
If you wear typical American
clothing all the time, you will
stand out like a sore thumb and
will be set upon by black mar
keters at every corner who will
be eager to buy what Western
goods you have and may want
to exchange currency. Both ac
tivities are illegal.
For those times when you
want to be invisible, bring an
old pair of blue jeans, so many
Russians wear them now that
they are no longer an indication
that you are a westerner, or
work pants. Old simple dress
shoes and a simple dress shirt
should also be worn. A dark in
expensive sport coat is worn by
men of all ages in the Soviet
Union.
Clothing
Younger women can get
away with wearing pants, but
older women usually wear
dresses. For older women an

old simple dress will do for
those occasions when they
want to be left alone.
It is important to make up a
small medical kit with bandages
and common medicines since
these will be difficult to find.
It is also good to bring small
gifts. Frisbees, American
cigarettes, lipstick, postcards,
pictures of yourself and family,
inexpensive digital watches
and books with scenic pictures
of your state or region all make
good gifts. If you make friends,
they will probably offer you
gifts and you will thus be pre
pared to follow this long
established tradition.
Here are some final words of
advice. Forget the bad food, the
bad service, the waiting in line
and the delays. Believe it or not,
Intourist is doing its best.
Instead, pay close attention
to what is around you. What
you are seeing few people in the
West have seen. Inevitably you
will make comparisons bet
ween your way of life and the
one you are observing. Try not
to judge everything you see by
Western standards, but rather
try to discover what the Rus
sians consider important, what
their standards are. It is a dis
covery that will be very en
lightening, if not refreshing.

loaves of Russian black bread.

... it is difficult to abide by all laws and restric
tions. If you do stick strictly to 'what is al
lowed,' you may end up seeing Russia almost
entirely from the seat of a tour bus.

Those students who fear that
the expense of study programs
may be too great should know
that financial aid is often availa
ble through the sponsoring in
stitution and through federal
government student-aid pro
grams. The cost can be anywhere
from $2(X)0 to $5000 depending
on the length of stay and the
amount of travel.
Only certain travel agencies
deal with Intourist, the Soviet
tourist agency. The home travel
agency usually arranges every
thing with Intourist and secures
visas for persons in a group.
Touring
The current eight-day tour
arranged by One World Service
in San Francisco costs $375 and
the 15-day tour costs $654,

excluding transportation to or
from the Soviet Union.
Individual touring is possi
ble, but not advisable except for
those with a good knowledge of
Russian. Moreover, a day-by
day itinerary must be agreed on
with Intourist before entering
the country and adhered to
strictly. Since one would not be
traveling with an Intourist
guide, it would be necessary to
register with Intourist at each
stop.
I could offer a series of warn
ings here, but if you go on a

group tour or a study program,
you will probably be
thoroughly briefed on do's and
don'ts for visitors to the Soviet
Union.
There are so many things,
however, that are illegal or that
tourists are discouraged from
doing, that it is difficult to abide
by all laws and restrictions. If
you do stick strictly to "what is
allowed," you may end up se
eing Russia almost entirely

from the seat of a tour bus.
Discretion is key
You will generally be dis
couraged, for instance, from
meeting Soviet citizens other
than the ones they want you to
meet. If you are discreet, how
ever, neither you nor your
friends are likely to get in trou
ble. Being discreet is the key to
overcoming restrictions placed
on you.
If you wear typical American
clothing all the time, you will
stand out like a sore thumb and
will be set upon by black mar
keters at every corner who will
be eager to buy what Western
goods you have and may want
to exchange currency. Both ac
tivities are illegal.
For those times when you
want to be invisible, bring an
old pair of blue jeans, so many
Russians wear them now that
they are no longer an indication
that you are a westerner, or
work pants. Old simple dress
shoes and a simple dress shirt
should also be worn. A dark in
expensive sport coat is worn by
men of all ages in the Soviet
Union.
Clothing
Younger women can get
away with wearing pants, but
older women usually wear
dresses. For older women an

old simple dress will do for
those occasions when they
want to be left alone.
It is important to make up a
small medical kit with bandages
and common medicines since
these will be difficult to find.
It is also good to bring small
gifts. Frisbees, American
cigarettes, lipstick, postcards,
pictures of yourself and family,
inexpensive digital watches
and books with scenic pictures
of your state or region all make
good gifts. If you make friends,
they will probably offer you
gifts and you will thus be pre
pared to follow this long
established tradition.
Here are some final words of
advice. Forget the bad food, the
bad service, the waiting in line
and the delays. Believe it or not,
Intourist is doing its best.
Instead, pay close attention
to what is around you. What
you are seeing few people in the
West have seen. Inevitably you
will make comparisons bet
ween your way of life and the
one you are observing. Try not
to judge everything you see by
Western standards, but rather
try to discover what the Rus
sians consider important, what
their standards are. It is a dis
covery that will be very en
lightening, if not refreshing.
The one thing you can be cer
tain of on a trip to the Soviet
Union is uncertainty. Soviet of
ficials of all kinds are unpre
dictable. Reservations may be
changed or canceled without
notice at hotels and restaurants.
Schedules may be altered fre
quently. Rules and restrictions
are numerous and new ones are
announced unexpectedly.
Tourists in the Soviet Union
must quickly learn to roll with
the punches. Complaints
should be saved only for truly
important problems. Despite
the many inconveniences and
privations of a visit to Russia,
the trip can be immensely
worthwhile.
Visiting the Soviet Union is
an eye-opening experience.
The country lies on the plain
where Europe flows into Asia,
where the East truly begins.
Russia's location and history
have set it apart from Western
Europe and Western notions of
life fade as one approaches.
Options for the traveler range
from four-month-long lan
guage study programs, which
include travel, to eight-day
excursions. Study programs are
the best way to experience the
Soviet Union.
Such programs afford a
chance to live in Russia in one
place, usually neara university,
long enough to get to know a
tew Russians well.
Warmth, generosity
If it seems improbable to you
that an American could get to
know several Russians well in a
couple of months, it is probably

because the Western image of
the Russians is that they are
stern and cool. Publicly they are
rather more stoical than we are
for they have been hardened by
a life that is considerably more
difficult. Privately, however,
they display immense warmth
and generosity.
For those who know the lan
guage well enough, many
nights will be spent talking with
Russians, drinking inordinate
amounts of vodka and eating
loaves of Russian black bread.
