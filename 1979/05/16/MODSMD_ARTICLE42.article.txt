# Keio exchange program
## Come meet the real Japan 
### Susan Essoyan 
Shoppers swarm into the de
partment store, enticed by air
conditioning and colorful dis
plays. As each shopper steps
onto the escalator, a uniformed
young woman standing beside
the escalator bows deeply.
"Irasshaimase" (welcome) she
says over and over. American
students, surprised at the cour
tesy, smileand bob their heads.
By sending students to live in
Japan for two months, the
Stanford-Keio University ex
change program shows Ameri
cans "the real Japan," accord
ing to junior James Higa,
chairman of this year's ex
change committee.
Under the student-run prog
ram, eight students fly to Japan
during the summer to live with
Japanese families. In the
spring, eight Japanese students
visit Stanford.
"It's not like a tour-bus
guide," Higa said. "You're ac
tually living it."
Host families
Keio University, a private
Japanese university compara
ble to Stanford in reputation,
provides students with host
families for the length of their
stay and activities ranging from

lectures to climbing Mt. Fuji,
Higa said.
Host families "made the dif
ference between being a tourist
and a guest," Cara McCarty,
one of last year's participants,
said. McCarty said she valued
living with a Japanese family
"especially since the Japanese
are generally a reserved
people." Exchange students
spent their time in Japan visit
ing "all kinds of temples and
museums," according to
Stewart Carl, a graduate stu
dent on last year's program.
Students made short trips to
Kyoto, Japan's traditional capi
tal, Nara and Sado Island, from
Tokyo where they lived.
Students also spent a lot of
time "hitting the town" in To
kyo, Higa said. Lousie Kato,
another of last year's exchange
students, said she appreciated
the chance to "see Japan
through Japanese students'
eyes."
Language barrier no problem
Most students who went to
Japan iast year did not speak
Japanese but said that they
didn't find the language barrier
a problem.
"I just used body language,"
Carl said.
Keio students organizing the
program spoke English but
many of the host families
did not, according to Carl.
Nevertheless, students man
aged to communicate.
"Most Japanese were so po
lite that if you made an effort to
communicate somehow they'd

understand," McCarty
explained.
Independence
Students appreciated the in
dependence afforded by the
program's format. Keio stu
dents arranged activities and
entertainment for the first
month of the students' stay but
during the second month, stu
dents were free to do as they
liked, Kato said. Most spent
their time traveling around
Japan and elsewhere in Asia.
The trip cost most students
about $1000 last year, but I liga
predicted this summer's ex
penses would range from $1200
to $1400. These figures include
air fare, room, board and prog
ram expenses. Personal shop
ping expenses are not included.
"It's still the cheapest way to
see Japan," Higa said.
"Even with the dollar crash
ing to all-time lows, we got by
on a few dollars a day," Carl
said. McCarty added that she
thought the trip was "definitely
worth it,"and encouraged
those going to Japan to take ad
vantage of every opportunity
there, "even those that don't
particularly interest you."
The trip not only dispelled
stereotyped images of Japan,
but also changed students' per
ceptions of the United States,
McCarty said.
"I felt like I was on the moon
when I got back to the U.S. â€”
there were no people," Carl said.
The exchange is strictly cul
tural, as students earn no
academic credit.
