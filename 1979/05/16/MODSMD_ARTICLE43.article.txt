tors on English texts of their journal articles. The
Volunteers in Asia (VIA) program offers many
such opportunities for student non-tourist
travel.
Every year3o to4o students from Stanford and
the University of California at Santa Cruz ven
ture to Taiwan, Indonesia, the Phillipines, Korea,
and Japan to live and work among the people of
Asia. During stays ranging from six months to
two years, volunteers teach English and work in
appropriate technology, economic planning and
music education.
Volunteers work closely with a local institution
which serves as host and takes care of local costs.
In return they devote time to meet the needs of
the institution and community.
While VIA may not be for every student
traveler, it affords students an opportunity to see
Asia from a non-tourist perspective. Terry
George, a junior majoring in international rela
tions, who worked for six months in Indonesia
called his stay " a different kind of overseas ex
perience."
Unlike Stanford's overseas campuses, the vol
unteer must live and work wholly within another
culture, he said.
"It opened my eyes to the fact that not every
body lives like people in the United States," said
Jade Barnett, a senior majoring in international
relations, who spent six months in Taiwan. Bar
nett cited exposure to "different realities of life"
such as rapid growth and change, and the exis
tence of family businesses, as a significant part of
her experience.
In addition to travel, VIA offers students a
chance to learn more about themselves in a new
environment. "I learned how incredibly flexible a
human being can be," said Barnett, "you can
really adjust if you open up and accept others."
"It was more difficult than I thought it would
be,"George said, "you learn to rely on yourself."
Interaction with Asian culture is facilitated by

the volunteer's work, and there are great oppor
tunities for personal involvement during all ph
ases of a volunteer's life in Asia. Barnett noted
that life with her host family was "probably the
most beneficial part of my stay."
No previous qualifications or experience are
necessary. The only prerequisite is a willingness
to work hard, according to Sukie Jackson, a re
turned volunteer who now works on the VIA
staff here.
"It's more attitude than qualifications," she
said. "We've had a variety of people ranging
from pre-meds to English majors." The common
denominator appears to be a desire to commit
oneself to a challenging but valuable learning
experience.
Returned volunteers often continue to work
with VIA and related projects, as well as in other
Asia-related fields. Jackson cited the publication
of the Appropriate Technology Sourcebook, edited by
former volunteers Ken Darrow and Rick Pam,
which is designed to help villages solve problems
in agriculture and industry with their own re
sources. Another VIA program brings Japanese
students here for cross-cultural and language
study.
Former volunteers also plav a large role in di
recting VIA. Jackson emphasized that program
participants are involved in the decision-making
process, including recruitment, selection and
training of new volunteers.
Selection of volunteers takes place in January,
after a fall recruitment program. Successful
applicants undergo a training program in the
spring, emphasizing language teaching, cross
cultural communication, and Asian culture. Sev
eral day-long sessions are devoted to discussion
between returned volunteers and new volun
teers. Expenses are limited to airfare and costs
for a weekend training session. Since local costs
are covered by the host institution, a VIA job can
be a good travel deal.
Further travel in Asia is also relatively cheap,
and can enrich the volunteer's experience.
George traveled extensively in Indonesia and
Japan after his stay was over.
