# Don't overlook Canada
## 
### Peter Dalglish 
When Americans feel like ski
ing outside their country and
can afford it, they usually head
off for Switzerland or Austria,
and when they decide to go
deep-sea fishing, it's off to the
Caribbean. They rarely think of
Canada.
Let's face it. Canada is
thought of by many as cold and
boring. And a strange dialect is
spoken there. At least Mexico is
exotic.
But for a summer vacation,
Canada is great. The weather is
good, it is easy to get around,
and the country is so large that
crowds can be avoided. Also,
with the Canadian dollar at a
low level, the American dollar
is worth more.
Students usually find lots of
hostels and campgrounds in
which to stay, and hitchhiking
is safe. The best way to get ac
ross the country is by train, al
though over long distances it is
cheaper to fly. From Vancouver
to Toronto, the cheapest train
ticket sells for about $120, with
all meals extra.
Some highlights of the pro
vinces:
British Columbia: The Roc
kies may start in the United
States, but they don't get big
until north of the border. The
combination of mountains, sea
and sky is overwhelming;
British Columbia certainly de
serves the title "God's coun
try." What Vancouver lacks in
the way of night-life and big
city bustle, it makes up for with
its spectacular setting.

The student traveler who re
ally wants to see British Colum
bia should ride the ferries bet
ween the islands that dot the
coast. A bike is also a good way
to get around. Vancouver Is
land has to be one of the most
beautiful places on this planet.
The West Coast Trail along 60
miles of coastline offers good
campsites and challenging hik
ing for backpackers.
Long Beach is as a national
park should be: no asphalt,
hotels or tacky restaurants —
just miles of beach lined with
deadheads and surrounded by
huge trees. Yosemite Valley
lovers should stay at home.
Alberta: American students
traveling in Canada shouldn't
miss Banff — it's the party capi
tal of Canada. It's great fun to
sit back, throw down some
Canadian beer, and laugh at the
fat Americans in their
Airstream trailers. Of course,
the scenery isn't too bad either.
The area of Banff-Jasper has
some of the best skiing in North
America. Lift ticket prices are
cheaper than they are in the
States, and the lines are shor
ter. For the ultimate experience,
spend a week helicopter skiing
in the Cariboo or Bugaboo
Mountains for about $1100.
Banff also is the usual starting
place for pack-horse trips
through the Rockies.
Banff and Jasper National
Parks provide hundreds of
square miles of good backpack
ing and climbing country. Cal
gary in July is the scene of the
Stampede, the largest annual

rodeo in the world. Texans feel
right at home there, with most
of the city's money coming
from oil and beef.
The Far North: The Yukon
and Northwest Territories
make up more than one-third of
Canada's entire land mass. It is
the land of adventure and ex
ploration immortalized by Jack
London in The Call of the Wild
and other stories. The entire
district is unbelievably beauti
ful and distant, yet it can be
reached by road or by air from
parts further south. The inac
cessibility of such areas as the
Yukon Coastal Plain and Old
Crow Flats has meant that the
land to date is untouched, and
wildlife such as porcupine,
caribou and the Peregrine fal
con abound.
Of course, the Yukon and
Northwest Territories are
superb for the serious
backpacker, climber or
canoeist. Wild rivers that
would challenge the best
white-water fanatics include
the Big Salmon, Klondike and
Porcupine Rivers. The Yukon
River, 530 miles long, provides
a manageable route for the less
experienced. Start your trip at
the dam on the Alaska High
way access to Lewes River.
Ontario: Canadians from any
other part of the country will
tell you it's a terrible place, voic
ing their resentment of the way
Ottawa conducts business with
the provinces. But Ontario is
one of the most interesting
places in Canada to visit.

Toronto has been referred to
as the most livable big city in
North America; it is clean, safe,
and an exciting place to spend a
few days. In particular, visit the
Royal Ontario Museum and To
ronto Island. The Stratford Fes
tival presents the finest
Shakespeare performances on
the continent for theatre buffs.
It is located about 80 miles
southwest of Toronto. For
bicyclists, the Georgia Bay and
Ottawa Valley regions are excel
lent for extended trips. As with
most of Canada, campsites are
numerous, cheap and clean.
Canoeists should try Algon
quin Park, or the less-traveled
Temagami and Quetico reg
ions.
Quebec: Canada's largest
province is mostly French
speaking. Montreal is probably
the most dynamic city in North
America after New York. It's
known for its nightlife, great

shopping, restaurants, and an
amazing transit system.
Quebec City is old Quebec,
with the only armed"citadel on
the continent and a distinctly
Quebecois feeling. The Gaspe
Peninsula that borders both the
Atlantic Ocean and the St.
Lawrence River offers fine
backpacking, with towering
cliffs and wonderful vistas.
The Maritimes: The pace of
life is much slower here than
the rest of the country, but the
landscape is what you'd expect
of the Atlantic region: green,
rolling hills and small towns
with rows of fishing boats and
hordes of noisy schoolchildren.
Nova Scotia is a bicyclist's
paradise, and the Magdalen Is
lands off the north shore are
popular with backpackers.
Whenever you decide to
visit, Canada will undoubtedly
enthrall you.
