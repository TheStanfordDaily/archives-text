# Australia not only koalas and kangaroos

If you guessed Australia for the first
set of words, you're right. But if you
thought only of the San Francisco Bay
Area as the common denominator of the
second list, you'd better brush up on
geography before the next Trivia Bowl.
Although the smallest continent may
not have a veil of mystery surrounding it
like China, many people readily assume
that what they learned about Australia
in grade school is all there is to know.
This stereotype simply isn't the whole
picture.

Let's embark on a simulated tour of
the land "down under" to clear up some
of the misconceptions.
Midnight at the oases
First of all, Australia is not all "out
back" — arid prairie. Most of the coun
try meets this description, but there is a
wide spectrum of oases. For example,
there is Sydney, an interesting blend of
a quasi-American metropolis and night
life with English-derived culture. Sights
in this east coast city include the Sydney
Harbor Bridge, nicknamed "King Kong's
Coat Hanger"; the waterside opera
house, Sydney Zoo and one of the tallest
buildings in the southern hemisphere,
the Skywalk, which offers a panoramic
view.

On the other hand, towns like
Gladstone on the northeast coast are re
latively isolated from other com
munities, especially if you are accus
tomed to the blurring of towns into a
large stretch of developments as on the
Peninsula. Gladstone, a railroad stop in
a primarily bauxite mining area, serves
as a departure point to the Great Barrier
Reef.
The reef is practically a world unto its
own, estimated to be the world's largest
concentration of living organisms.
Rather than a single stretch of coral, the
barrier reef is actually a series of coral
shelves and islands surrounded by
coral, or atolls. Much of this national
treasure is fortunately protected by law,
preventing the removal of its inhabitants
while allowing firsthand inspection of a
fantastic ecosystem — heaven for
marine biologists. Since the seasons are
reversed south of the equator, be sure to
avoid exploring the reef late in our
summer, which is cyclone season in Au
stralia.
Brisbane, also on the east coast, falls
between Sydney and Gladstone, both
geographically and culturally. An urban
center by nature> Brisbane provides ac
cess to more rural settings such as
pineapple plantations and Lone Pine
Sanctuary.
Hug a koala, kiss a kangaroo
Lone Pine is a wildlife preserve,
where one can fulfill what seems to be
the motive behind stuffed tov sales —
the desire to cuddle a koala bear or meet
a kangaroo face-to-face. Here they have
koala maternitv wards, albino koalas

and pastures where cattle could graze
but which harbor 'roos instead.
Imagine eyeing a full-grown kan
garoo bounding to a dead stop right at
your feet, then propping itself on hind
legs and that tail as it eats cracked corn
from your hands. By the way, koala
"teddy" bears are actually made with
kangaroo fur, which is much softer than
real koala fur — another myth dispelled.
Sydney and Brisbane are both within
reasonable driving time of miles of
beaches for swimming and surfing.
Southwest of Sydney you can taste a bit
of England — the Parliament House in
Canberra, then you can taste a bit of
Australia — the bottled harvest from the
wine country. Tours are available of
sheep stations and the other white stuff
down here beside wool — snow; where
else but in the Snowy Mountains?
'Gateway' cities
Adelaide, almost due west of the ski
resorts of the Snowy Mountains, is one
of the "gateway" cities to the outback
and natural sights like Ayer's Rock, sac
red to the aborigines.
Equally important as the scenery or
other points of interest are the people
themselves, for they can be as rugged as
the country itself, yet with warmth and
a wry sense of humor. The Aussies,
speaking with a colorful accent and voc
abulary, make you feel right at home
whether toting a giant can of their local
beer and swapping tales, or helping to
unlock the mysteries of the Barrier Reef.
Australia may be the land down un
der, but with these mates as hosts you
can feel on top of the world.
