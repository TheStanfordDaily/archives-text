# Sierra Service Trips
## Vacation with a purpose 
### Nick Fowler Karen Veninga 
If you'd like to do your part
for nature, and have a good
time doing it, Sierra Club's Ser
vice Trips may be for you.
Over the past 21 years, Ser
vice Trips have removed ugly
airplane wrecks from Sierra
Nevada peaks, built and re
paired trails in Montana,
cleaned up garbage in the High
Uintas of Utah, and restored
damaged meadows in Col
orado. Service Trips epitomize
the Sierra Club.'s motto: "To
study, explore and enjoy the
wildlands."
For about $60 one can spend
10 to 14 days in the grandeur of
the Sierra Nevadas, North Cas
cades, High Uintas, Rockies, or
British Columbia. The $60 trip
fee partially defrays the cost of
leader and cook salaries, food
and equipment. With Sierra
Club subsidizing the rest.
There are Service Trips de
signed with the novice in mind,
as well as special projects which
require experienced backpac
kers. All trips have both leader
and cook, who have trained
for at least two years in the Ser
vice Trip program. Dave Si
mon, finance chairman for the
Service Trips in this area, said
that Sierra Club Trips are staf
fed and organized by "people
who know about the wilder
ness, who are out to enjoy it
and protect it."
Brook Milligan, a Service Trip
leader, praised the trips be
cause he said they bring wil
derness lovers together who
otherwise might not know each
other. Brook advised future
Service Trip participants to "be
willing to do some hard work
and have some fun." An aver
age trip of 20 allows for solidar
ity and camaraderie. Coopera
tion is important within the
group.
Service Trips can be grouped
into two categories: those

which establish a base camp
and those which rove. On base
camp trips, the project usually
involves such tasks as building
sections of trail, consolidating
several trails into one to protect
a fragile meadow, or repairing
especially damaged areas. Rov
ing trips normally build and
maintain and clean up garbage.
Local authorities, like the
Bureau of Land Management,
work with trip projects.
Of the normal 10-day trip du
ration, four days are spent on
the trip project, four are free
days, and two days are spent
hiking to and from the project.
The actual schedule of work is
flexible, allowing the trip group
to take the best possible advan
tage of their wilderness time.
On the free days one can
really explore the surrounding
areas. As many trips are in na
tional wilderness areas or those
pending wilderness designa
tion, the settings are spectacu
lar.
Free days can be grouped so
that extended hiking is possi
ble or alternated with work
days for day hikes. Typical
free-day activities include
climbing peaks, fishing,
swimming, lazing about and
glissading. There will be 19
Service Trips this summer, 10
or 11 in California.
The equipment required of
the backpacker includes a sleep
ing bag, boots and a backpack,
all of which are easily borrowed
or rented. Depending on the
area and the time of year, a tent
may be an added comfort, al
though not a necessity. It is
usually easy to find a trip
member who is willing to dou
ble up during inclement
weather. The trip provides all
cooking and trail-building im
plements; all the trip member
needs to bring would be a cup
and a spoon.
The Sierra Club Service Trips
provide an extra bonus for

backpackers who find a certain
satisfaction in helping to pre
serve the wilderness. As Carole
Spies, a recent graduate of
Stanford and a long-time
backpacker, sums it up: "The
Service Trips? They're great!
I'm going on three this sum
mer. You meet new people, and
you feel like you're really doing
something for the mountains."
So if you're feeling energetic
and helpful this summer, head
for the hills with the Sierra
Club.

Free days can be grouped so
that extended hiking is possi
ble or alternated with work
days for day hikes. Typical
free-day activities include
climbing peaks, fishing,
swimming, lazing about and
glissading. There will be 19
Service Trips this summer, 10
or 11 in California.
The equipment required of
the backpacker includes a sleep
ing bag, boots and a backpack,
all of which are easily borrowed
or rented. Depending on the
area and the time of year, a tent
may be an added comfort, al
though not a necessity. It is
usually easy to find a trip
member who is willing to dou
ble up during inclement
weather. The trip provides all
cooking and trail-building im
plements; all the trip member
needs to bring would be a cup
and a spoon.
The Sierra Club Service Trips
provide an extra bonus for

backpackers who find a certain
satisfaction in helping to pre
serve the wilderness. As Carole
Spies, a recent graduate of
Stanford and a long-time
backpacker, sums it up: "The
Service Trips? They're great!
I'm going on three this sum
mer. You meet new people, and
you feel like you're really doing
something for the mountains."
So if you're feeling energetic
and helpful this summer, head
for the hills with the Sierra
Club.

If you'd like to do your part
for nature, and have a good
time doing it, Sierra Club's Ser
vice Trips may be for you.
Over the past 21 years, Ser
vice Trips have removed ugly
airplane wrecks from Sierra
Nevada peaks, built and re
paired trails in Montana,
cleaned up garbage in the High
Uintas of Utah, and restored
damaged meadows in Col
orado. Service Trips epitomize
the Sierra Club.'s motto: "To
study, explore and enjoy the
wildlands."
For about $60 one can spend
10 to 14 days in the grandeur of
the Sierra Nevadas, North Cas
cades, High Uintas, Rockies, or
British Columbia. The $60 trip
fee partially defrays the cost of
leader and cook salaries, food
and equipment. With Sierra
Club subsidizing the rest.
There are Service Trips de
signed with the novice in mind,
as well as special projects which
require experienced backpac
kers. All trips have both leader
and cook, who have trained
for at least two years in the Ser
vice Trip program. Dave Si
mon, finance chairman for the
Service Trips in this area, said
that Sierra Club Trips are staf
fed and organized by "people
who know about the wilder
ness, who are out to enjoy it
and protect it."
Brook Milligan, a Service Trip
leader, praised the trips be
cause he said they bring wil
derness lovers together who
otherwise might not know each
other. Brook advised future
Service Trip participants to "be
willing to do some hard work
and have some fun." An aver
age trip of 20 allows for solidar
ity and camaraderie. Coopera
tion is important within the
group.
Service Trips can be grouped
into two categories: those

which establish a base camp
and those which rove. On base
camp trips, the project usually
involves such tasks as building
sections of trail, consolidating
several trails into one to protect
a fragile meadow, or repairing
especially damaged areas. Rov
ing trips normally build and
maintain and clean up garbage.
Local authorities, like the
Bureau of Land Management,
work with trip projects.
Of the normal 10-day trip du
ration, four days are spent on
the trip project, four are free
days, and two days are spent
hiking to and from the project.
The actual schedule of work is
flexible, allowing the trip group
to take the best possible advan
tage of their wilderness time.
On the free days one can
really explore the surrounding
areas. As many trips are in na
tional wilderness areas or those
pending wilderness designa
tion, the settings are spectacu
lar.
Free days can be grouped so
that extended hiking is possi
ble or alternated with work
days for day hikes. Typical
free-day activities include
climbing peaks, fishing,
swimming, lazing about and
glissading. There will be 19
Service Trips this summer, 10
