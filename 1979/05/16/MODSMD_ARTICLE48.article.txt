# Tourists throng Cape Cod
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Some 359 years ago, long
long before Leland Stanford's
time, long long before Califor
nia's time, a group of hardy pil
grims packed their fortunes and
their hopes aboard the NUiyf
lower and sailed west for
America.
They landed first at the tip of
a curved peninsula now known
as Cape Cod at a spot now
known as Provincetown, and
like generations of tourists after
them on up to the present, they
turned away in disappointment
and set sail again, this time for
Plymouth.
Although this small town at
the northernmost part of the
Cape has continued to turn
away many disillusioned sum
mer visitors with its head
shops, foot-long hot-dog
stands, packed restaurants and
souvenir stores, Provincetown
continues to attract an equal
number who love the summer
bustle and crowded streets;
here they find a distinctively
charming and classy Asbury
Park-north kind of atmosphere.
Cape Cod is one of the most
beautiful areas of New England
and, indeed, of the entire coun
try. Lying in the southeastern

corner ot Massachusetts, it is
now connected to the mainland
only by two great twin steel
bridges at Sagamore and
Bourne, the Cape Cod Canal
having been built there near the
beginning of the century.
Pilgrims
A tourist mecca for years, the
Cape attracts scores of latter
generation pilgrims during the
summer months. The region
almost seems to burst with the
throngs of tourists who come to
relax on beautiful beaches and
enjoy the slow summer life.
Growth has been a problem.
The last 15 years have seen an
expansion of housing and
people rivaled in only a few
other areas of the country, and
attendant problems of this
summer crowding are being
addressed but slowly. Every
year visitors returning in the
late spring are invariably met by
new stores, new housing de
velopments and a promise of
yet more people in the weeks
ahead.
Charm
Yet the Cape retains its charm
despite great expansion of
housing and population.
It is during the off-season
months, from the late days of

September on into early June,
that the Cape assumes its true
beauty. The old houses, many
dating back well before 1700,
stand proud and rugged during
the winter, many of them left
alone until their inhabitants re
turn for weekends in the
spring.
The ocean roars and foams,
and it seems, it is during the
winter months that there is
enough calm and quiet to ap
preciate the sounds and the salt
air.
Year-'rounders
Life slows down during the
winter. A number of interesting
year-'rounders make up the
Cape's population, unorthodox
artists and taciturn Yankee
stoics among them.
It is still possible to take
Thoreau's walking tour of the
Cape, which laid the basis for
his lengthy work Cape Cod, by
following Route 6 from Eas
tham toProvincetown and visit
ing the spots about which he
wrote.
Though towns have ex
panded and sands have shifted,
one can get a sense of the Cape
he described. His route started
at Eastham, at the southern
edge of what is now the Cape
Cod National Seashore, and
meandered along the ocean
coast around the bend of the
Cape through Wellfleet and
and Truro on up to Provin
ce town.
The northern shore or Bay
Side of the Cape differs from
the south shore, the Ocean
Side. The water is far calmer
than Nantucket Sound and the
Atlantic, and the towns have
kept more of their original qual
ity.
Dennis, halfway along the6A
road from the Sagamore Bridge
to Orleans, is one such town,
possibly the finest. Graced by
historic spots, beautiful old
homes, and a spectacular view
afforded from Scargo Hill, the
highest point in the mid-Cape,
Dennis is a town forever charm
ing. It is also the home of one of
the Cape's finest eating spots,
the homey Village Fare, a Fin
nish restaurant serving a delici
ous smorgasbord of food from
around the world.

Thoreau's walking tour of the
Cape, which laid the basis for
his lengthy work Cape Cod, by
following Route 6 from Eas
tham toProvincetown and visit
ing the spots about which he
wrote.
Though towns have ex
panded and sands have shifted,
one can get a sense of the Cape
he described. His route started
at Eastham, at the southern
edge of what is now the Cape
Cod National Seashore, and
meandered along the ocean
coast around the bend of the
Cape through Wellfleet and
and Truro on up to Provin
ce town.
The northern shore or Bay
Side of the Cape differs from
the south shore, the Ocean
Side. The water is far calmer
than Nantucket Sound and the
Atlantic, and the towns have
kept more of their original qual
ity.
Dennis, halfway along the6A
road from the Sagamore Bridge
to Orleans, is one such town,
possibly the finest. Graced by
historic spots, beautiful old
homes, and a spectacular view
afforded from Scargo Hill, the
highest point in the mid-Cape,
Dennis is a town forever charm
ing. It is also the home of one of
the Cape's finest eating spots,
the homey Village Fare, a Fin
nish restaurant serving a delici
ous smorgasbord of food from
around the world.
Some 359 years ago, long
long before Leland Stanford's
time, long long before Califor
nia's time, a group of hardy pil
grims packed their fortunes and
their hopes aboard the NUiyf
lower and sailed west for
America.
They landed first at the tip of
a curved peninsula now known
as Cape Cod at a spot now
known as Provincetown, and
like generations of tourists after
them on up to the present, they
turned away in disappointment
and set sail again, this time for
Plymouth.
Although this small town at
the northernmost part of the
Cape has continued to turn
away many disillusioned sum
mer visitors with its head
shops, foot-long hot-dog
stands, packed restaurants and
souvenir stores, Provincetown
continues to attract an equal
number who love the summer
bustle and crowded streets;
here they find a distinctively
charming and classy Asbury
Park-north kind of atmosphere.
Cape Cod is one of the most
beautiful areas of New England
and, indeed, of the entire coun
try. Lying in the southeastern

corner ot Massachusetts, it is
now connected to the mainland
only by two great twin steel
bridges at Sagamore and
Bourne, the Cape Cod Canal
having been built there near the
beginning of the century.
Pilgrims
A tourist mecca for years, the
Cape attracts scores of latter
generation pilgrims during the
summer months. The region
almost seems to burst with the
throngs of tourists who come to
relax on beautiful beaches and
enjoy the slow summer life.
Growth has been a problem.
The last 15 years have seen an
expansion of housing and
people rivaled in only a few
other areas of the country, and
attendant problems of this
summer crowding are being
addressed but slowly. Every
year visitors returning in the
late spring are invariably met by
new stores, new housing de
velopments and a promise of
yet more people in the weeks
ahead.
Charm
Yet the Cape retains its charm
despite great expansion of
housing and population.
It is during the off-season
months, from the late days of

September on into early June,
that the Cape assumes its true
beauty. The old houses, many
dating back well before 1700,
stand proud and rugged during
the winter, many of them left
alone until their inhabitants re
turn for weekends in the
spring.
The ocean roars and foams,
and it seems, it is during the
winter months that there is
enough calm and quiet to ap
preciate the sounds and the salt
air.
Year-'rounders
Life slows down during the
winter. A number of interesting
year-'rounders make up the
Cape's population, unorthodox
artists and taciturn Yankee
stoics among them.
It is still possible to take
Thoreau's walking tour of the
Cape, which laid the basis for
his lengthy work Cape Cod, by
following Route 6 from Eas
