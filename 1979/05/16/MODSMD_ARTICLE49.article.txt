# State's past lingers in Santa Barbara
## 
### Ellie Williams 
For many, the Santa Barbara area,
with its palm trees and sandy beaches, is
closest in spirit to Hawaii. Preoccupied
with suntans and volleyball, tourists
consistently overlook the rich mixture of
history and culture in the city and sur
rounding valley.
The Santa Ynez valley, 45 miles
northwest of Santa Barbara, is itself an
historical enclave. Cattle and Arabian
thoroughbred horses graze on rolling
hills which hide small towns that cling to
their heritage.
Los Alamos is one such town. Here
one may browse in antique shops, inves
tigate the goods in one of California's
few remaining general stores, or have a
drink amidst the license plates, deer
horns and wagon wheels in the Union
Hotel's saloon.
After experiencing the flavor of a late
19th century American town, one can
discover Danish heritage in Solvang, 20
miles south. Established as a Danish set

tlement in 1911, Solvang offers buildings
all of a Scandinavian motif, Danish
shops, and a delicious afternoon tasting
Danish pastries from the town's many
bakeries.
But don't stuff yourself on the Danish
delicacies because dinner at Mattei's
tavern in Los Olivas is a must!
Stagecoach inn
Felix Mattei, a Swiss immigrant, built
this two-story stagecoach inn in 1866.
Mattei died in 1930, and his inn has be
come a tavern, with an impressive menu
of entrees such as mahi mahi, teriyaki
steak, and prime rib.
Thirty-five miles south of Mattei's lies
Santa Barbara, bastion of California's
mission past. Here one can walk the
downtown Red Tile Tour and discover
the city's four eras — Indian, Spanish,
Mexican and American — in the Histori
cal Society Museum.
The Country Courthouse is a beautiful
example of Spanish Moorish style. Be
sides murals, interior decorations and

sunken gardens, this building offers an
observation tower from which one can
look down upon Santa Barbara and the
surrounding valley.
To gain full appreciation for mission
life, visit the restored Franciscan Mission
Santa Barbara. Called "Queen of the
Missions," it was founded in 1786 and
completed in 1820.
After a day reliving Santa Barbara's
mission era one can experience Califor
nia's years of early statehood in one of
the city's country inns. The Upman
Hotel, in the heart of the city, is Santa
Barbara's oldest guest house.
For more seclusion, try the San Ysidro
Guest Ranch. Here guests can stay in
wood-frame and stone cottages. Guests
can ride horses through 525 surrounding
acres of bridle and hiking trails.
Yet the ranch is only six miles from
downtown Santa Barbara. If one tires of
the expensive meals and private life, one
ii riot too far from the' city to grab a
burger, pick upa game of volleyball.
