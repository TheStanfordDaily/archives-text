# Angry workers invade office
## Residence Manager challenged on vacation policy 
### Mark Nassutti 
More than 50 angry University cus
todial employees and community
members here marched into the
University residence manager's of
fice at noon yesterday in protest over
a new policy restricting vacations.
The workers confronted Resi
dence Manager Robert Ramirez and
his assistant Oliver Slayton. The dis
pute erupted over a letter from
Slayton to workers stating that cus
todial employees will not be allowed
to take vacations between )une 18
and August 31.
The workers were angry because
never before has their vacation been
restricted to particular dates.
When Slayton and Ramirez re
fused to answer questions from the

group, Paul Stuart, assistant presi
dent of the United Stanford
Employees (USE), shouted, "We're
fighting for human rights. How can
you go home and sleepat night when
these people can't take vacations
they've planned for years?"
Slayton and Ramirez did not re
spond to Stuart.
Slayton explained later that until
this year, it has always been recom
mended that workers not take their
vacations during the summer due to
the increased activity from summer
conferences.
This year three workers will not be
allowed to take their vacations dur
ing the time period in question.
Slayton defended his action saying
that the people whose vacations
were denied were "experienced
people in key places."
Most of the workers involved were
concerned for their vacation plans.
Rafael Verbera, a cook at Florence
Moore hall and representative of
Row and Florence Moore house cus
todians, said, "I believe manage
ment should be responsible and re
spond to these people's needs. They
should accept the need for vaca
tion."
Varrie Booker, leadman of a heavy
maintenance crew, was a typical
case. In a letter dated May 3, Booker
requested the month of July in order
to see his children and visit his family
in Texas. His wife had already ob
tained permission to leave for that
month.
When asked why he denied
Booker's request, Slayton replied
that Booker was a key man. "We

need him," he said.
When asked during the office con
frontation whether someone else
could fill in for Booker, Slayton re
plied that no one else could do the
job.
Booker said after the demonstra
tion that he had taken time off before
without any problems. "I got two
small kids," he said. "I don't know
why they denied me. I don't even
make beds."
Employees felt that the major task
for custodial help in the summer was
to make beds for those who attended
summer conferences.
USE, which represents the workers
involved, has filed a grievance with
the University on behalf of the three
workers.
Sue Frey, field representative for
USE, said, "I think Stanford will stall"
in settling the grievance.
"We'll end up in arbitration," she
said, "and I'm sure the arbitrator will
rule in our favor. They (the Univer
sity) can't unilaterally change their
policy like this.
"The problem is getting to arbitra
tion before it's time for these people
to go on vacation," she said.
The collective bargaining agree
ment between the University and
USE states that "the University may
alter the workers' schedules only
where operational needs require it to
do so . . . .If operational needs re
quire a change in a worker's ap
proved vacation schedule, they shall
be permitted to reschedule the vaca
tion leave denied within the month
following the period for which it was
originally scheduled."
