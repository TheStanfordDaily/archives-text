Mexico is what a traveler wants it to
be.
If you come looking for the sinful
dregs of human existence or the best of
modern western culture, you will find it.
From dives in Ciudad Juarez to theZona
Rosa in Mexico City, there is something
for everyone.
Going to Mexico is easy. A passport is
advisable in case something goes wrong
but is not necessary unless immigration
officers suspect you are an un
documented alien. If you're going to be
in the country for more than a few
hours, you will need a Tourist Card. To
get one, you need to present proof of
citizenship to any travel agent or Mexi

can consulate. There are consulates in
San Francisco and San Jose.
The old cliche about not drinking the
water is applicable in some areas. While
the Mexico City Holiday Inn is safe, it
wouldn't be smart to drink the water in a
Yucatan village. Use your own judg
ment for places in between. As tolerance
to microorganisms varies from person to
person and getting sick will tend to spoil
your travel plans, fear of water is a great
excuse for drinking beer!
Mexicans will gladly take your
money, but they won't be too thrilled by
your physical presence. For years
American tourists have been known to
some Mexicans as "Ugly Americans."
Don't think the hostility is directed only
toward your parents' bermuda shorts
generation. How would you feel if Mex
ican college students got sick on your
front porch?
Around the more popular tourist
spots, the English language and U.S.
dollars are readily accepted.
'Muling' discouraged
If you plan to bring back some Mexi
can souvenirs, illicit or otherwise, it's
your own business. Don't be a "mule,"
which is someone who carries another's
goods across the border. The pay isn't
worth the risk. Go see Midnight Express
before you decide to go into the busi
ness.
You can get to Mexico by walking, by
taking a package tour, or by various
other means. Considering the heat of

the Sonara Desert, the first is not advis
able. Hitchhiking can be dangerous,
particularly on isolated stretches of the
Baja Highway. Any travel agent will
have information on tours.
Accommodations range in cost from
free to very expensive. Most are cheaper
than similar places in the United States.
Generally you get what you pay for. It is
not a good idea to count on being able to
camp out in your sleeping bag. It may
not be too safe.
Border towns
There are several border towns that
are worth a short visit. Tijuana and
Juarez are the most famous of these
dirty, raunchy towns. Most college stu
dents love them.
Besides border towns, the most popu
lar vacation spots are the resorts along
the Pacific and the Gulf of California
coasts. Ensenada is the most accessible,
only IV2 hours south of the border. Still
touristy, it's much more respectable
than Tijuana.
On the Baja Peninsula, La Paz and
Cabo San Lucas are the two big spots. La
Paz is tops for fishing. Cabo San Lucas
used to be the place for lying in the sun,
drinking margueritas and mellowing
out. Now that the tourists have disco
vered it, it is losing some of its charm.
'Mexican Riviera'
The stretch from Mazatlan to
Acapulco is known as the Mexican Rivi
era. In Acapulco you'll find the famed

cliff divers. Many swear the best tequila
sunrises are found in Puerto Vallarta.
All of these places offer sun, beaches,
fishing and cantinas like every place
else. They are less crowded during the
summer, the off season.
Mexico City is the largest city in the
Western Hemisphere with more than 11
million inhabitants. The Aztecs built
their capital in the middle of a large lake
in the Valley of Mexico. When the
Spanish came they tore down the old
city and built Mexico City. The cathedral
is built over the remains of the chief
temple. Construction of the subway has
unearthed countless artifacts of the
Aztec era. Many of these are in the An
thropology Museum, an absolute must
on any trip to the city.
Other sightseeing spots in the city are
the Diego Rivera murals at the National
Palace, the Chapultepec Park and Fort,
and the shopping district of Zona Rosa.
Cultural attractions include the interna
tionally famous Ballet Folklorico de
Mexico.
There are many other attractive places
in Mexico. Guadalajara is a beautiful city
in a lovely location. Chichen-Itza is an
ancient ceremonial city built by the
Mayas. Taxco is famous for its silver
craft.
But maybe you should avoid the cities
entirely. Search for the treasure of Sierra
Madre in the mountains ora lost civiliza
tion in the jungles of Yucatan; it's hard
to be bored in Mexico.
