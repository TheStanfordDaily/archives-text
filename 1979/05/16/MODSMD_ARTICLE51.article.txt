# Scenic Columbia tempts the adventurous
## 
### Lauren Schroeder 
About three hours away from
Miami by jet, Colombia bec
kons archeologists, or
nithologists, and orchid fan
ciers.
The country is bordered by
both the Pacific and Atlantic
oceans and by the Amazon
Jungle. The magnificent Andes
Mountains run down the side
of the country, giving it a wide
variety of climates, from cold
mountain weather, deserts and
tropical rainforests, to coastal
lowlands. Colombia's various
climates produce an astound
ing variety of vegetation and
animal life. Colombia has more
species of birds than any other
country in the world.

Those visiting Colombia
usually visit Bogota first.
Bogota, the capital of Colombia,
stands 9000 feet above sea level
and a cool 60 degrees year
round. The city, with a popula
tion of at least 3 million, is large
and hectic. It has its discos, re
staurants, theaters and traffic
jams, but Bogota also has its
own unmistakable fla
vor. Downtown Bogota, in
colonial style, includes cathe
drals, museums and the colo
nial home of Simon Bolivar,
quite a hero in Colombia. Also
downtown is the presidential
palace which is surrounded by
machine-gun wielding military
police. On a more aesthetic
level, the Gold Museum,
downtown, houses a glittering
collection of pre-Colombian
gold ornaments.
Another side — poverty
There's another side to
Bogota, though, besides the
charming colonial architecture
and the towering Andes.
Bogota is rightly dubbed "the
pickpocket capital of the
world." Poverty is pronounced
in Bogota. Groups of runaway
children sleep on sidewalks,
bathe in fountains and eke out a
living by their wits and by their
nimble pickpocketing hands.
People in Bogota are quite
conservative, and anyone who
dresses like a "hippie" might be
considered a drug trafficker.
Those who plan to go to
restaurants or discos, should
pack some non-blue je.ans. . ,

Life for the American tourist
in Colombia is inexpensive be
cause the peso continues to de
value faster than the dollar.
Transportation is cheap, and so
are native crafts such as woolen
capes, macrame shawls and
pottery.
Day trips
Day trips by bus to towns
outside of Bogota provide a
glimpse of the beautiful coun
try. Zipaquira is a much-touted
but slightly dungeon-like salt
mine that was first worked by
the pre-Colombian Chibacha
Indians and is now a subterra
nean Catholic cathedral. The
Tequendama Falls are spectacu
lar when the water is running;
there's a dam upstream. Climb
the mountains behind Bogota,
or take a bus to any of the small
towns outside Bogota and hike
around there.
Those with more than a few
weeks to their vacation will
probably want to see other
parts of Colombia. Tierradentro
and San Agustin are both re
cently discovered archaeologi
cal sites. The catacombs in
Tierradentro have paintings by
early Indians, and San Agustin
has carved Indian burial
statues. Both of these sites are
comparatively tourist-free be
cause of their relative inaccessi
bility. Ambitious visitors can
visit the llanos (lowland plains)
where Colombian "cowboys"
raise cattle.
Medellin is a heavenly city,
capital of the bch department of

Antioquia. It's warm during the
day, and just cool enough at
night to be comfortable. Coffee
is grown near Medellin, so
here's the place to get a glimpse
of the mythical and celebrated
Juan Valdez.
Lovely beaches
As for beaches, either Car
tegena or Santa Marta fit the
bill. Cartagena is a colonial
town with brick pavements and
fortresses. Santa Marta is more
of a tourist spot, but has lovely
beaches.
Colombia also has a town on
the Amazon, Leticia, which has
been "hoteled" and
popularized by an American

entrepreneur. The town isn't
authentic as another Amazon
town might be, but even
tourism can't greatly change
the Amazon.
Everything in the Amazon is
out of proportion. The river is
too wide. The weather is either
extremely hot, extremely wet,
or both. Colors are too bright.
Vegetation is too dense and
plants are too big (water lilies
here are six feet in diameter).
You can see flocks of green
parakeets fly across the sky, like
escapees from a pet store.
Adventurous persons with
time to spend should go to Col
ombia. It's, worth it.


The city of Manizales is one of the fastest-growing cities in the
Colombian Andes.

beaches.
Colombia also has a town on
the Amazon, Leticia, which has
been "hoteled" and
popularized by an American

entrepreneur. The town isn't
authentic as another Amazon
town might be, but even
tourism can't greatly change
the Amazon.
Everything in the Amazon is
out of proportion. The river is
too wide. The weather is either
extremely hot, extremely wet,
or both. Colors are too bright.
Vegetation is too dense and
plants are too big (water lilies
here are six feet in diameter).
You can see flocks of green
parakeets fly across the sky, like
escapees from a pet store.
Adventurous persons with
time to spend should go to Col
ombia. It's, worth it.


The city of Manizales is one of the fastest-growing cities in the
Colombian Andes.
About three hours away from
Miami by jet, Colombia bec
kons archeologists, or
nithologists, and orchid fan
ciers.
The country is bordered by
both the Pacific and Atlantic
oceans and by the Amazon
Jungle. The magnificent Andes
Mountains run down the side
of the country, giving it a wide
variety of climates, from cold
mountain weather, deserts and
tropical rainforests, to coastal
lowlands. Colombia's various
climates produce an astound
ing variety of vegetation and
animal life. Colombia has more
species of birds than any other
country in the world.

Those visiting Colombia
usually visit Bogota first.
Bogota, the capital of Colombia,
stands 9000 feet above sea level
and a cool 60 degrees year
round. The city, with a popula
tion of at least 3 million, is large
and hectic. It has its discos, re
staurants, theaters and traffic
jams, but Bogota also has its
own unmistakable fla
vor. Downtown Bogota, in
colonial style, includes cathe
drals, museums and the colo
nial home of Simon Bolivar,
quite a hero in Colombia. Also
downtown is the presidential
palace which is surrounded by
machine-gun wielding military
police. On a more aesthetic
level, the Gold Museum,
downtown, houses a glittering
collection of pre-Colombian
gold ornaments.
Another side — poverty
There's another side to
Bogota, though, besides the
charming colonial architecture
and the towering Andes.
Bogota is rightly dubbed "the
pickpocket capital of the
world." Poverty is pronounced
in Bogota. Groups of runaway
children sleep on sidewalks,
bathe in fountains and eke out a
living by their wits and by their
nimble pickpocketing hands.
People in Bogota are quite
conservative, and anyone who
dresses like a "hippie" might be
considered a drug trafficker.
Those who plan to go to
restaurants or discos, should
pack some non-blue je.ans. . ,

Life for the American tourist
in Colombia is inexpensive be
cause the peso continues to de
value faster than the dollar.
Transportation is cheap, and so
are native crafts such as woolen
capes, macrame shawls and
pottery.
Day trips
Day trips by bus to towns
outside of Bogota provide a
glimpse of the beautiful coun
try. Zipaquira is a much-touted
but slightly dungeon-like salt
mine that was first worked by
the pre-Colombian Chibacha
Indians and is now a subterra
nean Catholic cathedral. The
Tequendama Falls are spectacu
lar when the water is running;
there's a dam upstream. Climb
the mountains behind Bogota,
or take a bus to any of the small
towns outside Bogota and hike
around there.
Those with more than a few
weeks to their vacation will
probably want to see other
parts of Colombia. Tierradentro
and San Agustin are both re
cently discovered archaeologi
cal sites. The catacombs in
Tierradentro have paintings by
early Indians, and San Agustin
has carved Indian burial
statues. Both of these sites are
comparatively tourist-free be
cause of their relative inaccessi
bility. Ambitious visitors can
visit the llanos (lowland plains)
where Colombian "cowboys"
raise cattle.
Medellin is a heavenly city,
capital of the bch department of

Antioquia. It's warm during the
day, and just cool enough at
night to be comfortable. Coffee
is grown near Medellin, so
here's the place to get a glimpse
of the mythical and celebrated
Juan Valdez.
Lovely beaches
As for beaches, either Car
tegena or Santa Marta fit the
bill. Cartagena is a colonial
town with brick pavements and
fortresses. Santa Marta is more
of a tourist spot, but has lovely
beaches.
