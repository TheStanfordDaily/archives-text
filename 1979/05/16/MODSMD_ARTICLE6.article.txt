Describing Brazil as "secure in its self-identity"
History Prof. )ohn Wirth stressed the country's
self-confidence in remarks delivered yesterday at
the Bechtel International Center.
Brazilians have a "reckless ability to cope" with
their problems, Wirth said. He likened the country
to a blithe water skier who grins from ear to ear
while surrounded by sharks.

He said that Brazil may emerge as an economic
power in the near future.
Wirth, director of the Center for Latin American
Studies at Stanford, placed heavy emphasis on
U.S. relations with Brazil, Brazil's history and what
he termed the strength of the Brazilian people.
Major power in South America
Brazil's secure self-identity and confidence
began with its status as the capital of the Por
tuguese colonial empire, Wirth said. Brazil soon
outgrew its small mother country, established an
effective bureaucracy and became a major power
in South America. It remained a rural agricultural
nationuntil thel92oswhen it opened uptoforeign
investment, he said.
The Singer sewing machine and secondary edu
cation were two important imports from the Un
ited States to Brazil. Brazil and the United States
established very close ties, which Wirth said he
believes gave Brazil some "breathing room" to
expand her influence in the early 20th century.
In time, foreign investment came to be resented
in Brazil, according to Wirth. The Brazilians had
hoped to develop by using foreign capital while
regulating its influence within their country.
In recent years this policy has been replaced.
Now Brazilians believe, according to a Brazilian
development slogan, that their countrymen
" 'have to develop the country or someone will

develop it for you,' " Wirth said. Wirth noted a
great willingness of the Brazilians to adopt new
ideas. They receive and then nationalize ideas, he
said.
Along with foreign investment, there has been
substantial local and government investment.
There has also been substantial Brazilian invest
ment in Saudi Arabia, Wirth said.
Over-confidence?
Brazil is not lacking in self-confidence, but
sometimes its self-confidence has led to prob
lems, he said. Wirth said that there is a "capacity in
Brazil to look fora large solution without doing the
detail work for it." For example, Brazilian de
velopers are going into the Amazon without carry
ing out sufficient preliminary scientific studies.
Brazil has had a repressive military government
since 1968, he said. Fifty percent of its population
is under 15-years-old. The country must develop
quickly in order to accommodate its burgeoning
population.
But Brazil is a large and ambitious nation which,
according to Wirth, has a powerful resource, its
talented people who excel at improvisation and
applying new techniques to their own needs.
Wirth's speech was part of Brazilian Cultural
Week here. Wirth has done extensive research in
Brazil and published books on the country's
economic development in oil and steel industries.
