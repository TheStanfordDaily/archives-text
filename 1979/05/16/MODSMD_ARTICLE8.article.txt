## DIALOG aids research 
### Laura Erickson 
Facing a huge term paper
and you don't know where to
start? Is your doctoral thesis
dragging? The Data Services
Center in Green Library offers
a computer reference service
for students needing sources
for research projects.
The library system here sub
scribes to DIALOG, a com
puterized index of sources op
erated by Lockheed Missile &
Space Co. for almost any sub
ject, according to Beth Hyslop,
head of Data Services Center.
When given a subject, the
computer will rapidly scan all
the citations in the computer's
files for the given index, or
database, and spew out a
neatly printed bibliography
consisting of a complete list of
articles on that subject, Hyslop
said.
Hyslop remarked that the
great advantage of the compu
ter search is the tremendous
amount of lime it saves by list
ing all relevant sources in a few
minutes.
There are 90 data bases in a
huge variety of fields ranging
from chemistry to economics.

These are continually updated
and more are added every
month, according to Hyslop.
Most of the references are
articles from academic jour
nals, but there is an index for
popular magazines and one for
newspapers which was just
added on May 1. Most files do
not date back more than 10
years, Hyslop said.
Anyone with a valid student
ID can use the system, but
everyone who uses the system
has to pay, Hyslop said. She
added that "It's a great
timesaver, but it does cost
money." To save money for the
user, she and the other libra
rians involved with the system
work with the student to plan
what she called a "research
strategy." Hyslop said that this
involves choosing the most
suitable data base and the most
specific subject titles so the
computer doesn't waste time
scanning material irrelevant to
the topic. The average cost of a
search is $10 to $25, Hyslop

said.
The computer will also give
abstracts of all the references it
prints out. These are usually
printed at Lockheed and
mailed to the University to cut
costs. These are available
within three days, Hyslop said.
If a student wants to use the
system, he or she can ask at any
library on campus or call the
Data Services Center. The lib
rarians will refer the user to the
librarian who can help the
most in the user's field of re
search, according to Hyslop.
Because Green Library is a
Humanities and Social Sci
ences library, Hyslop handles
topics related to those fields.
There are also DIALOG termi
nals in the Business Library, the
Engineering Library, Lane Med
ical Library and four other lib
raries on campus, Hyslop said.
The DIALOG service has
been available here for three
years. Forty to 50 searches are
conducted from terminals here
in an average month.
