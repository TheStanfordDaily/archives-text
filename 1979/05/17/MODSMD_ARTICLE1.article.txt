# Several frats miss quotas for next fall
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
Five fraternities, Alpha Delta Phi,
Theta Xi, Zeta Psi, Theta Delta Chi
and Kappa Sigma, failed to meet their
rush quotas of "sophomore equiva
lents" according to rush cards which
were reviewed yesterday, Asst. Di
rector of the Row Diana Conklin said.
"A sophomore equivalent is a stu
dent who is entitled to, but has not
yet used, his two guaranteed years of
housing," the Row Office's fraternity
regulations state.
Since the current guaranteed
housing plan went into effect in 1975,
the Row Office has used intricate cal
culations to assign each fraternity a
quota of sophomore equivalents to
be filled. "The fact is that the frater
nity system has to bear its share of
sophomore equivalents," Conklin
said.
Since 1975 no fraternity house has
been placed into the Draw for failure
to comply with the system's regula
tions. A fraternity may be considered
for placement into the Draw if it fails
to obtain its quota for any three out
of four consecutive years, or if it is
the weakest house while the frater
nity system as a whole fails to match
its quota for two years running.
Houses may be placed on notice
by the Inter-Fraternity Council or for
extreme quota insufficiencies, as
well.
240 point quota
The system as a whole has fallen
short of its 240 point quota by 5.5
points. A student with one guaran
teed year remaining counts .5 points.
"They really could make it, and I
don't see any real problems at this
point," Conklin said.
Theta Xi has thus far managed to
acquire only 6.5 of its required 11.5
sophomore equivalents. It also fell
short of its quota in 1975, 1977 and
1978.
Since the fraternity system missed
its overall quota the past two years,
and Theta Xi possessed the greatest
point deficit last November, "we
could have put them in the Draw
then," Conklin said.
Instead, "we decided to let them
have another go at it. Mike Bever (di
rector of the Row) wrote them a letter
in February informing them that this
rush would have to be a success, or
that we would take a hard, close look
at their fraternity," she said.
A fraternity can accept bids and
transfers to boost its quota until Oct.
1. But a freshman entered in the sec
ond round of the Draw is now consi
dered as only one-half point because
he will receive a University assign
ment and thus use up one guaran
teed year of on-campus housing.
Previous years
In previous years, a freshman
would not use up a guaranteed year
until he actually moved into a Uni
versity residence autumn quarter,
according to Bob Picazo, the presi
dent of Kappa Sigma.
"I just don't know what's going to
happen," Conklin said. The Row Of
fice will hold a meeting next week to
determine the status of the frater
nities in question, she added.
"We're concerned, but we're not
throwing in the bag. We're not
panicking," Bill Boone, the rush
chairman at Theta Xi, said. "As of
right now, we haven't made our
quota, but we will make it by Oc
tober. We're actively pursuing
people," he said.
The Alpha Delts obtained 18 of
their 22 requisite points, which Pres
ident Eric Lund attributed to "a more
low-pressure style of meeting them
(potential pledges)."The Alpha Delts
also missed their quota last year and
in 1976, but Lund said, "We'll be full
next year. We're just a place where
you can do what you want. We're
filling up our house with all bros, but
we're still not meeting the quota," he
said.
The Theta Delts made their quota
last year "with no problems," but
lack four sophomore equivalents
necessary to meet their quota this
year. "At the beginning of rush, the
house analyzed the situation with re
spect to the number of seniors leav
ing, the spaces available and the kind
of pledge class" desired, President
Mike Fisher said. "Overall, we met
those objectives, and we are confi
dent we will make the quota in the
future."
The Zetes needed a mere one
point to equal their 22.5 quota and
were waiting for one freshman who

had not decided, according to Rush
Chairman Royal Farros. "We have no
problem getting people," he said.
Last year the Zetes fell one person
short while accepting 23 new mem
bers, including two juniors. This year
they signed 26 pledges. "We'll have
our quota," Farros said.
Kappa Sigma missed its quota by
one point last year and gathered 19.5
of its 22 points this year. "We were
not informed of the deadline (the
second round of the Draw after
which a freshman would be consi
dered .5 points)," Picazo said.
Conklin noted a basic dilemma in
herent in the current regulations. "If
a lot of fraternities consistently don't
make quota, the weakest will be pul
led off, one at a time.
"Because it won't hurt them, it's
hard to convince a strong house"
that choosing not to meet its quota
could undermine the whole sys
tem, she said.

bers, including two juniors. This year
they signed 26 pledges. "We'll have
our quota," Farros said.
Kappa Sigma missed its quota by
one point last year and gathered 19.5
of its 22 points this year. "We were
not informed of the deadline (the
second round of the Draw after
which a freshman would be consi
dered .5 points)," Picazo said.
Conklin noted a basic dilemma in
herent in the current regulations. "If
a lot of fraternities consistently don't
make quota, the weakest will be pul
led off, one at a time.
"Because it won't hurt them, it's
hard to convince a strong house"
that choosing not to meet its quota
could undermine the whole sys
tem, she said.
Five fraternities, Alpha Delta Phi,
Theta Xi, Zeta Psi, Theta Delta Chi
and Kappa Sigma, failed to meet their
rush quotas of "sophomore equiva
lents" according to rush cards which
were reviewed yesterday, Asst. Di
rector of the Row Diana Conklin said.
"A sophomore equivalent is a stu
dent who is entitled to, but has not
yet used, his two guaranteed years of
housing," the Row Office's fraternity
regulations state.
Since the current guaranteed
housing plan went into effect in 1975,
the Row Office has used intricate cal
culations to assign each fraternity a
quota of sophomore equivalents to
be filled. "The fact is that the frater
nity system has to bear its share of
sophomore equivalents," Conklin
said.
Since 1975 no fraternity house has
been placed into the Draw for failure
to comply with the system's regula
tions. A fraternity may be considered
for placement into the Draw if it fails
to obtain its quota for any three out
of four consecutive years, or if it is
the weakest house while the frater
nity system as a whole fails to match
its quota for two years running.
Houses may be placed on notice
by the Inter-Fraternity Council or for
extreme quota insufficiencies, as
well.
240 point quota
The system as a whole has fallen
short of its 240 point quota by 5.5
points. A student with one guaran
teed year remaining counts .5 points.
"They really could make it, and I
don't see any real problems at this
point," Conklin said.
Theta Xi has thus far managed to
acquire only 6.5 of its required 11.5
sophomore equivalents. It also fell
short of its quota in 1975, 1977 and
1978.
Since the fraternity system missed
its overall quota the past two years,
and Theta Xi possessed the greatest
point deficit last November, "we
could have put them in the Draw
then," Conklin said.
Instead, "we decided to let them
have another go at it. Mike Bever (di
rector of the Row) wrote them a letter
in February informing them that this
rush would have to be a success, or
that we would take a hard, close look
at their fraternity," she said.
A fraternity can accept bids and
transfers to boost its quota until Oct.
1. But a freshman entered in the sec
ond round of the Draw is now consi
dered as only one-half point because
he will receive a University assign
ment and thus use up one guaran
teed year of on-campus housing.
Previous years
In previous years, a freshman
would not use up a guaranteed year
until he actually moved into a Uni
versity residence autumn quarter,
according to Bob Picazo, the presi
dent of Kappa Sigma.
"I just don't know what's going to
happen," Conklin said. The Row Of
fice will hold a meeting next week to
determine the status of the frater
nities in question, she added.
"We're concerned, but we're not
throwing in the bag. We're not
panicking," Bill Boone, the rush
chairman at Theta Xi, said. "As of
right now, we haven't made our
quota, but we will make it by Oc
tober. We're actively pursuing
people," he said.
The Alpha Delts obtained 18 of
their 22 requisite points, which Pres
ident Eric Lund attributed to "a more
low-pressure style of meeting them
(potential pledges)."The Alpha Delts
also missed their quota last year and
in 1976, but Lund said, "We'll be full
next year. We're just a place where
you can do what you want. We're
filling up our house with all bros, but
we're still not meeting the quota," he
said.
The Theta Delts made their quota
last year "with no problems," but
lack four sophomore equivalents
necessary to meet their quota this
year. "At the beginning of rush, the
house analyzed the situation with re
spect to the number of seniors leav
ing, the spaces available and the kind
of pledge class" desired, President
Mike Fisher said. "Overall, we met
those objectives, and we are confi
dent we will make the quota in the
future."
The Zetes needed a mere one
point to equal their 22.5 quota and
were waiting for one freshman who

had not decided, according to Rush
Chairman Royal Farros. "We have no
problem getting people," he said.
Last year the Zetes fell one person
short while accepting 23 new mem
bers, including two juniors. This year
they signed 26 pledges. "We'll have
