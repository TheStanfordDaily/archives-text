# Week will honor C.S. Lewis
## 
### Krisan Froelich 
The point about reading
C.S. Lewis is that he makes
you sure, whatever you be
lieve, that religion accepted
or rejected means some
thing extremely serious,
demanding the entire
energy of the mind.
-Harper's magazine
C.S. Lewis is the author of
several well-known books,
including The Screwtape
Letters, The Chronicles of
Narnia, Mere Christianity,
The Problem of Pain and A
Grief Observed. More than
26 million copies of these
works have been sold. A late
professor of medieval and
renaissance at Cambridge
University, Lewis is recog
nized as one of the great En
glish scholars. He died in
1963.
Next week has been de
signated "C.S. Lewis Week"
by the Stanford Christian
Fellowship (SCF). Accord
ing to Tom Pratt, a member
of the executive committee
for SCF, the group is trying
to "drump up" interest in
Lewis.
Scheduled for "C.S.
Lewis Week" is a seminar to
be given by students who
studied Lewis while they
were at Cliveden. Lewis's
works will also be sold at the
booktable in White Plaza
where students will be av
ailable to answer questions
about Lewis and his
philosophies.
The main event of the
week will be an autobiog
raphical movie on Monday.
Following the movie, Kent
Meads, a local Presbyterian
minister, will discuss Lewis
and his influence.

The movie, Through joy
and Beyond, is based on
Lewis' autobiography, Sur
prised by toy. With Peter Us
tinov as Lewis' voice, the
movie illustrates the au
thor's life story and his
search for "joy."
'|oy reminds'
For Lewis, joy is not sim
ply happiness.
"Joy always reminds,"
Lewis once said. "It does
not become a possession. It
remains the desire for
something long ago or far
away or soon to be."
As one critic explained
the search: "Romanticism,
or romantic desire, is for
Lewis an intense urge which
begins in an uncertainty
about its object. The human
mind devises for it many
mistaken identifications —
nostalgic, erotic, aesthetic,
occult or intellectual." Sur
prised by Joy, claimed its au
thor, was written by one
who had proved each of
these possibilities wrong
through his own ontological
search for God.
After viewing the movie in
San Jose as it toured the
country, Pratt said he and
SCF decided to show it
here.
Intellectual finure
"Lewis is one of a handful
of intellectual figures in this
century who are propo
nents of Christian theism,"
Pratt explained. "In an era
where the church has lost
influence, particularly in in
tellectual circles, Lewis of
fers some incredible in
sights into the problems of
modern man."
"Lewis is considered one

of the most intelligent
proponents of Christian!
faith in the university com
ponent," said Robertl
Hammerton-Kelly, dean of
the Chapel here.)
Hammerton-Kelly was an
undergraduate at Cam-I
bridge when Lewis was
teaching there, and recently 1
read all of Lewis' works be
cause he is directing a
senior honors thesis on
Lewis.
"Lewis' concerns are the
concerns of the university,"
he said.
Pain, miracles
Building his arguments
for faith from an intellectual
basis, Lewis dealt with prob
lems of pain, miracles and
other areas that make faith
in Cod and Christ difficult,
Hammerton-Kelly ex
plained. "Outside the
university setting, most
people who do not believe
in Cod do so for unarticu
lated reasons."
Lewis appeals to the intel
lectual, but as he himself
commented, he was not a
professional theologian.
Hammerton-Kelly agrees,
stating that in several areas
Lewis' views are "unre
fined."
But one of the tasks of a
professional theologian is
to make the teaching of the
Christian faith pertinent to
the time and "Lewis was
brilliant at that,"
Hammerton-Kelly said.
"I think Lewis was and is a
great challenge to profes
sional theologians," he
said. "There's something
astringent about C.S. Lewis
that calls theologians to ac
count."

Scheduled for "C.S.
Lewis Week" is a seminar to
be given by students who
studied Lewis while they
were at Cliveden. Lewis's
works will also be sold at the
booktable in White Plaza
where students will be av
ailable to answer questions
about Lewis and his
philosophies.
The main event of the
week will be an autobiog
raphical movie on Monday.
Following the movie, Kent
Meads, a local Presbyterian
minister, will discuss Lewis
and his influence.

The movie, Through joy
and Beyond, is based on
Lewis' autobiography, Sur
prised by toy. With Peter Us
tinov as Lewis' voice, the
movie illustrates the au
thor's life story and his
search for "joy."
'|oy reminds'
For Lewis, joy is not sim
ply happiness.
"Joy always reminds,"
Lewis once said. "It does
not become a possession. It
remains the desire for
something long ago or far
away or soon to be."
As one critic explained
the search: "Romanticism,
or romantic desire, is for
Lewis an intense urge which
begins in an uncertainty
about its object. The human
mind devises for it many
mistaken identifications —
nostalgic, erotic, aesthetic,
occult or intellectual." Sur
prised by Joy, claimed its au
thor, was written by one
who had proved each of
these possibilities wrong
through his own ontological
search for God.
After viewing the movie in
San Jose as it toured the
country, Pratt said he and
SCF decided to show it
here.
Intellectual finure
"Lewis is one of a handful
of intellectual figures in this
century who are propo
nents of Christian theism,"
Pratt explained. "In an era
where the church has lost
influence, particularly in in
tellectual circles, Lewis of
fers some incredible in
sights into the problems of
modern man."
"Lewis is considered one

of the most intelligent
proponents of Christian!
faith in the university com
ponent," said Robertl
Hammerton-Kelly, dean of
the Chapel here.)
Hammerton-Kelly was an
undergraduate at Cam-I
bridge when Lewis was
teaching there, and recently 1
read all of Lewis' works be
cause he is directing a
senior honors thesis on
Lewis.
"Lewis' concerns are the
concerns of the university,"
he said.
Pain, miracles
Building his arguments
for faith from an intellectual
basis, Lewis dealt with prob
lems of pain, miracles and
other areas that make faith
in Cod and Christ difficult,
Hammerton-Kelly ex
plained. "Outside the
university setting, most
people who do not believe
in Cod do so for unarticu
lated reasons."
Lewis appeals to the intel
lectual, but as he himself
commented, he was not a
professional theologian.
Hammerton-Kelly agrees,
stating that in several areas
Lewis' views are "unre
fined."
But one of the tasks of a
professional theologian is
to make the teaching of the
Christian faith pertinent to
the time and "Lewis was
brilliant at that,"
Hammerton-Kelly said.
"I think Lewis was and is a
great challenge to profes
sional theologians," he
said. "There's something
astringent about C.S. Lewis
that calls theologians to ac
count."
The point about reading
C.S. Lewis is that he makes
you sure, whatever you be
lieve, that religion accepted
or rejected means some
thing extremely serious,
demanding the entire
energy of the mind.
-Harper's magazine
C.S. Lewis is the author of
several well-known books,
including The Screwtape
Letters, The Chronicles of
Narnia, Mere Christianity,
The Problem of Pain and A
Grief Observed. More than
26 million copies of these
works have been sold. A late
professor of medieval and
renaissance at Cambridge
University, Lewis is recog
nized as one of the great En
glish scholars. He died in
1963.
Next week has been de
signated "C.S. Lewis Week"
by the Stanford Christian
Fellowship (SCF). Accord
ing to Tom Pratt, a member
of the executive committee
for SCF, the group is trying
to "drump up" interest in
Lewis.
