# $2 million renovation in 1976
## Hopkins offers opportunity to study marine life 
### Greg Pierson 
Nestled among a grove of
cypress trees overlooking a
panoramic view of Monterey
Bay lies one of Stanford's most
famous, yet least talked about
campuses.
Occupying about 11 acres of
shoreline along Pacific Grove,
California, Hopkins Marine
Station is the site of year-round
research in biology, and is vis
ited by students and scientists
from all over the world.
"Since its founding, Hopkins
has made many important con
tributions to the field of biol
ogy," said Alan Baldridge, libra
rian at Hopkins. "It has an ex
cellent faculty, many of whom
have been members of the Na
tional Academy of Science and
other honorary organiza
tions."
Hopkins is one of the few
marine stations in the country
that offers courses to under
graduate students. An average
of 20 undergraduates and 15
graduates attend Hopkins each
academic year. In the summer
session, spaces are available to
students who do not attend the
University. Last year's summer
session was attended by 114
students. Courses in develop
mental biology, physiology
and invertebrate biology are a
sample of classes offered at
Hopkins each year.
Special projects
Special projects for students
are offered each spring. "Our
spring research project gener
ates a lot of excitement in the
students," said Baldridge. "A
topic is selected in some area
of marine research and given
to the students after their third
week of introductory courses.
"The project is designed
such that the students will be
able to tinish their research
and submit their results by the
end of the quarter. It's a very
rewarding experience for the
students and many of them are
able to net their research pub

lished," he said.
Many of the students attend
ing Hopkins are qualified di
vers and spend much of their
time under the waves studying
marine life. "This area of the
bay is a refuge and protected
by a legislative act," explained
Baldridge. "And since all
commercial fishing in this area
is banned, a large variety of
marine life is found here. The
water is not totally unpolluted,
but is as near pristine as you
can get."
Harbor seals
Many times the divers en
counter harbor seals, which
are seen sunning themselves
on the offshore rocks or play
fully swimming in groups near
the shore. "We got into quite a
scene with one seal while com
ing in," said Jeff Jensen and
Susan Danek, as they removed
their diving gear.
"Most of the time the seals
are shy and keep their distance
from divers. But if you're col
lecting fish in a mesh bag,
some of them will come up and
unfasten your weight belt to
divert your attention and then
steal the fish," Jensen added.
Hopkins has two laboratory
buildings, where a variety of
experiments are conducted
with all forms of life. The
biological clocks lab is headed
by Dr. Colin Pittendrigh, direc
tor of Hopkins. He stuoies the
internal timing devices which
adjust the physiology of living
organisms to a roughly 24-hour
period. "We have been in
terested in what determines
these biological clocks and
how they affect an organism's
behavior," said kathy Wil
liams, a researcher in the Pit
tendrigh lab.
Biological clocks
Pittendrigh is credited with
the first extensive study of
biological clocks and is cur
rently observing how they
work together with tidal clocks
in a marine organism.

Pittendrigh, a native of Eng
land, came to the United States
in 1945, and received his Ph.D.
from Columbia University in
1947. He taught at Princeton
University for 22 years and
came here in 1969. In 1970 he
was appointed the Bing profes
sor in human biology, a
position he held until his ap
pointment to Hopkins in 1976.
Another type of research
done at Hopkins involves the
study of two different varieties
of marine algae found along
the coast. "We have the algae
growing in separate tanks
here," said Roger Phillips, a
student at the station. "The

algae produce an extract called
carrageenan that can be used
as an emulsifier in such things
as ice cream and beer. They re
generate at 2-2.5 percent a day,
and we're trying to see
whether it is teasible to grow
them commercially."
Marine algae
Other research conducted at
Hopkins includes a project
under the diiection of Prof.
Isabella Abbott, an established
authority on marine algae. In
her study, graduate students
observe the structure, classifi
cation and reproduction of red
algae, and the possibility of
growing it as a lood source.

Another study is currently
being conducted to observe
the fertilization process of a
sea urchin egg under an elec
tron microscope.
Three years ago, Hopkins
entered a period of innovation
and expansion. From 196b to
1976, it suffered a cut in gov
ernment grants for research
and without a full-time direc
tor, momentum at the laborat
ory slowed. A University com
mittee, composed of distin
guished scientists, met in 1971
to discuss the future of Hop
kins.
The committee concluded
that Hopkins was making "an
outstanding contribution to
education which should be
strengthened and encour
aged." Soon after, the biology
department made three new
faculty appointments to Hop
kins and in June 1976, named
Pittendrigh director.
Renovation
Backing up Pittendrigh's new
position at Hopkins was nearly
$2 milion in tunds made availa
ble by different foundations to
expand and revitalize the exist
ing facilities. "All the buildings
were renovated and new
space was made available for
the labs," said Baldridge. In
cluded in the expansion was a
restoration of the diving head
quarters and library, a new lec
ture hall and an electron mic
roscope.
According to Dick Blanton,
business manager at the
marine sta'ion, Hopkins runs
on an operating budget of
about $300,000, with the help
of occasional research grants
from various foundations.
With a faculty of four profes
sors and one senior lecturer,
tuition at Hopkins is the same
as here. Students said they find
that the knowledge gained
from studying at the lab is in
valuable. "It's an incredible
experience to be able to learn

while actively researching in a
laboratory instead of studying
out of a book," said Jim Harris,
a senior majoring in biology.
Harris studied biological
clocks in algae for his research
project at Hopkins last spring,
and is looking forward to hav
ing his work published.
Housing
Although student housing
and meals are not provided by
the marine station, Hopkins is
conveniently located with re
ference to Pacific Grove and
Monterey. A n umber ot houses
and apartments are available
within walking or riding dis
tance to the grounds.
Spaces at Hopkins are avail
able for students who have
completed the biology or
human biology core classes.
Because the number of applic
ants to Hopkins is relatively
small during the academic
vear, students who apply stand
a fairly good chance of being
accepted, said Judy
Thompson, academic secret
ary at Hopkins.
Founded in 1892, Hopkins
Station was the first marine
laboratory established on the
Pacific coast. Under the spon
sorship of David Starr Jordan,
the University's first president,
and Timothy Hopkins, the son
of a famous railroad magnate,
it was first established at Lovers
Point and was known as the
Hopkins Seaside Laboratory.
The lab was set up to provide
year-round research for
graduate students and scien
tists from all over the country.
In the summer, classes in zool
ogy and physiology were
among the first courses offered
to undergraduates.
Renamed
In 1917, the station was
moved a half mile north to its
present location at Cabrillo
Point and renamed the Hop
kins Marine Station. The Hop
kins Marine Station has its own

sheltered landing place, a har
bor for large boats, and above
all, an abundance of marine
life. •
Although most of the re
search done at Hopkins is for
the benefit of science, stu
dents are occasionally involved
with issues in the community.
In 1970, students conducted a
study of pollution in Monterey
Bay. Af the same time, the city
of Carmel faced a bond issue to
extend the sewer outfall
farther out to sea. The Carmel
sanitation department claimed
that there was no pollution in
the bay, and officials at Point
Lobos State Park claimed that
the current outfall was already
destroying the park.
The students put drift bottles
in the bay at the outfall site and
found that they washed up on
the shore of the state park.
They also noted that wherever
the current took the sewage, a
dramatic talloff in the amount
of sea life occurred.
Results presented
At the end of the quarter, the
students presented their re
sults to the public at a meeting
attended by state representa
tives and the sanitation de
partment. When election day
came, Carmel passed the bond
8 to 1.
Hopkins Marine Station has
grown to be one of Stanford's
main attractions. With its dedi
cation to excellence, it sets the
course for many new fields of
study in biology. Students are
committed to excellence, most
of them spending 10 hours a
day researching in the labs.
"When you live in a place
like Hopkins," said Harris,
"You don't think about how
much time you're spending in
your labs or on your project.
You think about the experi
ence you gain learning in such
a great atmosphere, and the
classes that are always doing
exciting things."


Hopkins librarian Alan Baldridge, looking into Monterey Bay, said
"the water is not totally unpolluted, but is as near pristine as you can
get."

Marine life abounds at Hopkins. Harbor seals swim playfully in the waters near the station, and some
student divers report that the seals, though sometimes shy, will often sneak up and try to steal fish.

The marine station has been in its present location since 1917. It has its own sheltered landing place and a
harbor for large boats.
