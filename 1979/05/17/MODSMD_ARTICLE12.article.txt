# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Convert Livermore Labs 
### 
A decade ago, students here were en
gaged in a campaign to pressure the
University to convert Stanford Research
Institute from military research — in
cluding work on chemical and biological
warfare which then-SRI President
Charles Anderson maintained was "in
the public interest" — to "socially con
structive work." Ultimately, the Univer
sity instead severed its ties with SRI in
1970.
A similar struggle — but one with far
greater consequences — is now being
waged over the involvement of the Uni
versity of California in nuclear weapons
research.
For the past 36 years UC has, under
contract with various U.S. government
agencies, managed the Lawrence Liver
more Laboratory (LLL) and the Los
Alamos (New Mexico) Scientific
Laboratory. These two research institu
tions have done all the research and de
velopment of nuclear weapons in this
country beginning with the original
atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945.
According to UC President David Sa
xon, "The interest of the nation requires
that the laboratories be vital and scienti
fically excellent as long as the country
depends on (a strategic position of) nuc
lear deterrence. . . . The fundamental
justification of the university's con
tinued management is to be found in the
contribution made to the quality of the
laboratories in the interest of the na
tion."
Saxon claims that the extent of the
university's involvement with the Labs is
solely limited to "the paperwork type of
thing — pensions and the like. . .
But the UC Nuclear Weapons Labs
Conversion Project (UCNWLCP), which
for the past several years has lobbied for
the UC to phase out weapons research at
the Labs, disputes these claims.
They point out that Lab adminis
trators, far from being independent and
impartial as UC claims, have played an
aggressive role in promoting production
of the hydrogen bomb, the construction

of LLL in 1952 to develop thermonuclear
weapons and most recently the produc
tion of the neutron bomb.
They also point to a UC report pub
lished five years ago, which said that
rather than acting merely as a fiscal
agent, the UC "research staff has an im
portant influence on weapons design
themselves and in the underlying
strategic and tactical considerations
which help determine what new
weapons systems are needed."
In addition to the danger the lab poses
as an active proponent of the accelera
tion of the arms race, UCNWLCP also
points to the fact that LLL, which con
tains a large amount of plutonium, is sur
rounded by 13 active earthquake faults.
Analysis of possible ground rupture and
ground acceleration in the Livermore
area — only 40 miles from San Francisco
— has shown that lab buildingscould fail
in a major earthquake, which could re
sult in the accidental release of massive
amounts of plutonium, one of the most
carcinogenic and generally toxic mate
rials known to man.
For nearly two years, UC has been re
viewing its management of the two labs,
largely in response to strong student
pressure. The UC Board of Regents will
be meeting again tomorrow at the UC
Extension Center at 55 Laguna St. in San
Francisco.
UCNWLCP has formally requested the
regents or Saxon place a full discussion
of the weapons lab issue on tomorrow's
agenda in order to finally come to a deci
sion. They are calling for a nonviolent
mass picket outside the regents meeting
from 9 a.m. to noon in an effort to con
vince the regents that they can no longer
delay taking action on this issue.
We urge everyone to attend this picket
and add their voice to the many who are
already protesting UC's longstanding
and crucial contribution to the arms
race. It's time the regents make the deci
sion to alter the focus of LLL research to
peaceful issues aimed at improving, not
destroying, life.
