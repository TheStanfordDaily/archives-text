## Individualism hurts co-op houses 
### 
The Housing Draw is a curiously reveal
ing vehicle with which to profile students
here. Again this year I watched co-ops stay
fairly low on people's priority lists. There
has been talk in past years about the
sketchy student support for co-ops. These
houses make one of the most valuable
contributions to student life to be found
on this campus, and the fact that they re
ceive anything less than widespread en
thusiastic support has always saddened
and bewildered me.
But I think I understand why. Co-ops
provide an alternative living/working ex
perience which represents a deviation
from the mainstream; the difference bet
ween the two approaches is one of singu
larity versus collectivity. Numerous in
stitutions within the microcosm of the
University as well as in the larger outside
world reinforce the more common indi
vidualist approach.
In most public schools the process
of education is based not on cooperative
but on competitive learning. The tre
mendous emphasis in our educational sys
tem on individual achievement and indi
vidual evaluation is perverse. Because of
distrust, we are never allowed to work to
gether. Because we learned so early that
the grades were more desirable than the
satisfaction of the learning process itself,

we too began to associate cooperation
with laziness.
Education then, became a competitive
process. Now we approach our studies as
if there were a finite amount of knowledge
available and whoever scrambles over the
others quickly enough to get the biggest
piece will be the winner.
We approach our college education as
the vehicle most likely to convey us to
bigger and better things in the real world.
Again, we use whatever tools we can to
gain for ourselves as individuals what we
wish to attain. We approach the world in a
self-oriented and aggressive way.
Also contributing to the individualist
approach to living is the current trendy
narcissism. We are being encouraged to
"get in touch with ourselves," to be "good
to ourselves." What I find, though, is that
people seem to be putting themselves so
far ahead of others that they cease to be in
touch with and learn from their surround
ings. We are being encouraged to walk out
of difficult relationships, for instance, to
retain our "freedom," when all we are
doing is walking away from problems.
People have ceased to work together. It
is better, easier, to walk away than to sac
rifice time or energy that could be chan
neled into oneself. There seems to be no
sense of commitment to anything that

doesn't swiftly and assuredly profit one
self.
In the face of such life values, it is no
small wonder that the concept of coopera
tion frightens, disgusts or amuses many
people. One must harbor at least a faint
glimmer if not a glow of optimism to be
lieve that human beings can work and live
harmoniously together, and in a time of
extreme selfishness and cynicism, such
optimism is rare.
Co-op living is more than just a result of
a draw number; it is an approach to being.
It suggests that instead of equipping our
selves for individually blazing trails
through the world, we work together to
understand the world in which we live.
Even if the picture we receive is an un
pleasant one, working together to change
that picture is better than exhausting one
self trying to alter it alone.
Co-op living is feeling that the ultimate
value in being alive is the ongoing dialectic
between people; that the sum of the work
ing parts really is greater than the whole.
Cooperation is an approach that suggests
we work with what we have rather than
against it.
