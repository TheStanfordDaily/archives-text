Sorority parties
I finished brushing my hair
just as Bob and Tim came to the
door.
I buttoned up my new
"Halston" shirt, and the three
of us left for what promised to
be a wild Friday night.
We weren't really sure
which houses were having par
ties so we decided to try them
all. We walked up Mayfield to
Lake Lag and followed the
shore around to the Theta
House.
The Thetas keep a mellow
house. As we walked in, I de
tected the sounds of )oni
Mitchell trickling down the
staircase. Carefully avoiding
the numerous pairs of top
siders which littered the stairs,
we made our way to a small
back room.
We were offered mixed
drinks by a tall young lady in a
down vest, but after looking
around at the rest of the par
tiers, Tim convinced us to
leave. "I want to go to a rowdy
party," he said.
The DC house was alive and
rocking. "Free Bird" seemed to

be blasting out of every stereo
in the house. In the middle of
the courtyard, twenty DGs
were sitting in a large pond,
beers in hand, wearing nothing
but cowboy hats.
Two actives asked Rob and
me to the submarine races
while Tim was invited upstairs
to see somebody's new
waterbed. Needless to say, we
left the party without him.
Bob and I made our way next
door to the Kappa house.
While admiring the house's
outline (it looks like a map of
Texas), we were greeted and
escorted in by two southern
belles. Aftera few cocktails and
glasses of champagne, Bob left
to drive up to the city in an ac
tive's new 450 SL.
The Alpha Phi's band was
hopping. After being chased
by three drunken women, I ran
into a bathroom, looking for a
place to hide. Instead, I found
three cf my friends, who were
there for the same reason.
"These sorority women are
aggressive," said Dave. His
shirt had been ripped off, but he
still had a smile on his face. "I

heard tly Pi Phis are trashing
Roth House tonight."
Tired but happy, I walked
back to my room. As I opened
my door, I noticed a bright yel
low envelope on the floor. It
was an invitation to a
sorority fireside.
I guess they liked my picture
in the froshbook.

Bottle ban shock
Perhaps now the ban of bot
tles and other glass containers
and cans will be lifted at Frost
Amphitheater.
It was quite a shock to per
sons attending the ASSU's First
Annual Jazz Festival last
Memorial Day to be told to dis
card these items as they were
entering the gate.
Should the ban remain in ef
fect, the ASSU would be wise
to print the prohibition of such
items on the tickets.

Attitude unhealthy
Reverend Bo Reahard voiced
an attitude which I fear is
common in our society ("Gay
ness is sinful" Daily, May 15).
This attitude is a dangerous
one.
One of the functions of relig
ion is to define the bounds of
socially acceptable behavior.
The Bible presents the bounds
of a society quite different
from our own. Universals do
exist (taboos against murder,
rape and theft, for example);
however, many serve little or
no purpose today. Onanism
does not threaten our well
being nor would many con
sider isolating a woman simply
because she is menstruating.
Christianity, however, has
proven to be slow to change in
relation to society. Many men
and women feel guilty if they
masturbate. If this guilt were to
be magnified a thousandfold
perhaps the shame felt by
some Christian homosexuals
would be approached. I have
had two close friends struggle
with theirguiltof beinga Chris
tian homosexual. One gave up
his religion while the other
gave up his ability to love
another.
I cannot and will not argue
about the Bible with Reahard

nor with any Fundamentalist. I
do applaud those sects which
have accepted the religious
homosexual and offered them
the spiritual peace they desire.
I do, however, join with
Reahard in praying that "Gay
Awareness Week" will not re
turn. Due to the efforts of such
as the fine people at the Gay
People's Union this would only
happen if gays were granted
equal freedom. Unfortunately,
this will not happen soon and
"Gay Awareness Week" will re
turn.

It sounds to me as though
Doug Felt (Daily, May 11) and
his apathetic, unimaginative
clones are indeed lacking ad
venture on The Farm. How
ever, this state results from
their own failure to open their
eyes and ears, rather than from
the environment here, as Felt
suggests.
The University community
abounds with opportunities
for involvement appealing to
virtually all disciplines, in
terests and desires. Thumbing
through the green pages in the
Student Directory, one finds
names of 138 volunteer organi
zations, phone numbers to call
and names of people who ob
viously have something in
teresting to say which they feel
is worthwhile.
They have committed them
selves to be involved with a
cause they judge to be relevant
to their lives now or perhaps to
what their lives will be when
they leave here. There are vari
ous other organizations which
are not listed in the Student Di
rectory. The Office of Student
Activities can assist in creating
new interest groups. One can
participate in sponsored ac
tivities without being a group
member.
Involvement does take a cer
tain amount of self-motivation.
If the bored clones would
forget about boring them
selves long enough to muster
up some initiative, they might
discover how much life there is
to be lived here. They could
replace their donut hole per

sonalities with creative no
tions. As it is, they have no in
tellect with which to recognize
an intelligent conversation
when they hear one.
As for not learning anything
of value: aren't you as a stu
dent liable for selecting your
own classes? Calling your edu
cation merely a fiasco to pro
cure a slip of paper indicates
irresponsibility. Vou can re
medy your own inadequate
scheduling by utilizing the vast
resources available through
out the University. But you do
have to make an effort, some
thing which many uncon
cerned students are blind to.
Felt's complaints about so
cial life resemble a letter to
"Dear Beth." Ann Landers
would probably tell him, "You
get out of it what you put into

I encourage Felt and all his
apathetic groupies to examine
just why they have chosen to
ignore the numerous oppor
tunities for meaningful interac
tion within the community
here. And I challenge them to
do something about it.

Flush 'Oh Ned'
We feel the Daily should
either flush Rood's "Oh Ned!"
from its otherwise austere
pages, or exhibit better taste in
what is considered "suitable
comic strip material." Her May
14 strip, which portrays men
(not for the first time) as arrog
ant, aggressive and continually

on the make, is degrading. It
demeans not only men, butthe
very foundation of this Insti
tute of Higher Learning.
Admittedly, the strip usually
depicts life on the Farm in a
singularly humorous vein, but
her recent slanderous treat
ment of the male psyche is in
defensible. We deeply resent
the publication of this strip,
and urge that more discretion
be exercised in the future, by
both Rood and the Daily.
It's completely accurate, of
course; we just resent her tel
ling everyone about it.

I finished brushing my hair
just as Bob and Tim came to the
door.
I buttoned up my new
"Halston" shirt, and the three
of us left for what promised to
be a wild Friday night.
We weren't really sure
which houses were having par
ties so we decided to try them
all. We walked up Mayfield to
Lake Lag and followed the
shore around to the Theta
House.
The Thetas keep a mellow
house. As we walked in, I de
tected the sounds of )oni
Mitchell trickling down the
staircase. Carefully avoiding
the numerous pairs of top
siders which littered the stairs,
we made our way to a small
back room.
We were offered mixed
drinks by a tall young lady in a
down vest, but after looking
around at the rest of the par
tiers, Tim convinced us to
leave. "I want to go to a rowdy
party," he said.
The DC house was alive and
rocking. "Free Bird" seemed to

be blasting out of every stereo
in the house. In the middle of
the courtyard, twenty DGs
were sitting in a large pond,
beers in hand, wearing nothing
but cowboy hats.
Two actives asked Rob and
me to the submarine races
while Tim was invited upstairs
to see somebody's new
waterbed. Needless to say, we
left the party without him.
Bob and I made our way next
door to the Kappa house.
While admiring the house's
outline (it looks like a map of
Texas), we were greeted and
escorted in by two southern
belles. Aftera few cocktails and
glasses of champagne, Bob left
to drive up to the city in an ac
tive's new 450 SL.
The Alpha Phi's band was
hopping. After being chased
by three drunken women, I ran
into a bathroom, looking for a
place to hide. Instead, I found
three cf my friends, who were
there for the same reason.
"These sorority women are
aggressive," said Dave. His
shirt had been ripped off, but he
still had a smile on his face. "I

heard tly Pi Phis are trashing
Roth House tonight."
Tired but happy, I walked
back to my room. As I opened
my door, I noticed a bright yel
low envelope on the floor. It
was an invitation to a
sorority fireside.
I guess they liked my picture
in the froshbook.

Attitude unhealthy
Reverend Bo Reahard voiced
an attitude which I fear is
common in our society ("Gay
ness is sinful" Daily, May 15).
This attitude is a dangerous
one.
One of the functions of relig
ion is to define the bounds of
socially acceptable behavior.
The Bible presents the bounds
of a society quite different
from our own. Universals do
exist (taboos against murder,
rape and theft, for example);
however, many serve little or
no purpose today. Onanism
does not threaten our well
being nor would many con
sider isolating a woman simply
because she is menstruating.
Christianity, however, has
proven to be slow to change in
relation to society. Many men
and women feel guilty if they
masturbate. If this guilt were to
be magnified a thousandfold
perhaps the shame felt by
some Christian homosexuals
would be approached. I have
had two close friends struggle
with theirguiltof beinga Chris
tian homosexual. One gave up
his religion while the other
gave up his ability to love
another.
I cannot and will not argue
about the Bible with Reahard

nor with any Fundamentalist. I
do applaud those sects which
have accepted the religious
homosexual and offered them
the spiritual peace they desire.
I do, however, join with
Reahard in praying that "Gay
Awareness Week" will not re
turn. Due to the efforts of such
as the fine people at the Gay
People's Union this would only
happen if gays were granted
equal freedom. Unfortunately,
this will not happen soon and
"Gay Awareness Week" will re

Flush 'Oh Ned'
We feel the Daily should
either flush Rood's "Oh Ned!"
from its otherwise austere
pages, or exhibit better taste in
what is considered "suitable
comic strip material." Her May
14 strip, which portrays men
(not for the first time) as arrog
ant, aggressive and continually

on the make, is degrading. It
demeans not only men, butthe
very foundation of this Insti
tute of Higher Learning.
Admittedly, the strip usually
depicts life on the Farm in a
singularly humorous vein, but
her recent slanderous treat
ment of the male psyche is in
defensible. We deeply resent
the publication of this strip,
and urge that more discretion
be exercised in the future, by
both Rood and the Daily.
It's completely accurate, of
course; we just resent her tel
ling everyone about it.

Sorority parties
I finished brushing my hair
just as Bob and Tim came to the
door.
I buttoned up my new
"Halston" shirt, and the three
of us left for what promised to
be a wild Friday night.
We weren't really sure
which houses were having par
ties so we decided to try them
all. We walked up Mayfield to
Lake Lag and followed the
shore around to the Theta
House.
The Thetas keep a mellow
house. As we walked in, I de
tected the sounds of )oni
Mitchell trickling down the
staircase. Carefully avoiding
the numerous pairs of top
siders which littered the stairs,
we made our way to a small
back room.
We were offered mixed
drinks by a tall young lady in a
down vest, but after looking
around at the rest of the par
tiers, Tim convinced us to
leave. "I want to go to a rowdy
party," he said.
The DC house was alive and
rocking. "Free Bird" seemed to

be blasting out of every stereo
in the house. In the middle of
the courtyard, twenty DGs
were sitting in a large pond,
beers in hand, wearing nothing
but cowboy hats.
Two actives asked Rob and
me to the submarine races
while Tim was invited upstairs
to see somebody's new
waterbed. Needless to say, we
left the party without him.
Bob and I made our way next
door to the Kappa house.
While admiring the house's
outline (it looks like a map of
Texas), we were greeted and
escorted in by two southern
belles. Aftera few cocktails and
glasses of champagne, Bob left
to drive up to the city in an ac
tive's new 450 SL.
The Alpha Phi's band was
hopping. After being chased
by three drunken women, I ran
into a bathroom, looking for a
place to hide. Instead, I found
three cf my friends, who were
there for the same reason.
"These sorority women are
aggressive," said Dave. His
shirt had been ripped off, but he
still had a smile on his face. "I

heard tly Pi Phis are trashing
Roth House tonight."
Tired but happy, I walked
back to my room. As I opened
my door, I noticed a bright yel
low envelope on the floor. It
was an invitation to a
sorority fireside.
I guess they liked my picture
in the froshbook.

Bottle ban shock
Perhaps now the ban of bot
tles and other glass containers
and cans will be lifted at Frost
Amphitheater.
It was quite a shock to per
sons attending the ASSU's First
Annual Jazz Festival last
Memorial Day to be told to dis
card these items as they were
entering the gate.
Should the ban remain in ef
fect, the ASSU would be wise
to print the prohibition of such
items on the tickets.

Attitude unhealthy
Reverend Bo Reahard voiced
an attitude which I fear is
common in our society ("Gay
ness is sinful" Daily, May 15).
This attitude is a dangerous
one.
One of the functions of relig
ion is to define the bounds of
socially acceptable behavior.
The Bible presents the bounds
of a society quite different
from our own. Universals do
exist (taboos against murder,
rape and theft, for example);
however, many serve little or
no purpose today. Onanism
does not threaten our well
being nor would many con
sider isolating a woman simply
because she is menstruating.
Christianity, however, has
proven to be slow to change in
relation to society. Many men
and women feel guilty if they
masturbate. If this guilt were to
be magnified a thousandfold
perhaps the shame felt by
some Christian homosexuals
would be approached. I have
had two close friends struggle
with theirguiltof beinga Chris
tian homosexual. One gave up
his religion while the other
gave up his ability to love
another.
I cannot and will not argue
about the Bible with Reahard

nor with any Fundamentalist. I
do applaud those sects which
have accepted the religious
homosexual and offered them
the spiritual peace they desire.
I do, however, join with
Reahard in praying that "Gay
Awareness Week" will not re
turn. Due to the efforts of such
as the fine people at the Gay
People's Union this would only
happen if gays were granted
equal freedom. Unfortunately,
this will not happen soon and
"Gay Awareness Week" will re
turn.

Clones fault
It sounds to me as though
Doug Felt (Daily, May 11) and
his apathetic, unimaginative
clones are indeed lacking ad
venture on The Farm. How
ever, this state results from
their own failure to open their
eyes and ears, rather than from
the environment here, as Felt
suggests.
The University community
abounds with opportunities
for involvement appealing to
virtually all disciplines, in
terests and desires. Thumbing
through the green pages in the
Student Directory, one finds
names of 138 volunteer organi
zations, phone numbers to call
and names of people who ob
viously have something in
teresting to say which they feel
is worthwhile.
They have committed them
selves to be involved with a
cause they judge to be relevant
to their lives now or perhaps to
what their lives will be when
they leave here. There are vari
ous other organizations which
are not listed in the Student Di
rectory. The Office of Student
Activities can assist in creating
new interest groups. One can
participate in sponsored ac
tivities without being a group
member.
Involvement does take a cer
tain amount of self-motivation.
If the bored clones would
forget about boring them
selves long enough to muster
up some initiative, they might
discover how much life there is
to be lived here. They could
replace their donut hole per

sonalities with creative no
tions. As it is, they have no in
tellect with which to recognize
an intelligent conversation
when they hear one.
As for not learning anything
of value: aren't you as a stu
dent liable for selecting your
own classes? Calling your edu
cation merely a fiasco to pro
cure a slip of paper indicates
irresponsibility. Vou can re
medy your own inadequate
scheduling by utilizing the vast
resources available through
out the University. But you do
have to make an effort, some
thing which many uncon
cerned students are blind to.
Felt's complaints about so
cial life resemble a letter to
"Dear Beth." Ann Landers
would probably tell him, "You
get out of it what you put into

I encourage Felt and all his
apathetic groupies to examine
just why they have chosen to
ignore the numerous oppor
tunities for meaningful interac
tion within the community
here. And I challenge them to
do something about it.
