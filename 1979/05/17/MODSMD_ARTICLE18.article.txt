## International news slighted 
### 
Actor Lee Marvin said today
he never loved his mis
tress. . . .
A teenage girl opened fire on
the high school playground ac
ross from her house, kil
ling. . . .
Former President Gerald
Ford tripped again descending
from an airplane. . . .
Amy Carter met "Charlie's
Angels" today. . . .
Chinese forces pressed on
into Vietnam . . . Oh, gawd!
The Russians are threatening to
do something about the
Chinese attacks. We're gonna
have a nuclear v ar."
The weather's holding up
fine and it looks like a good
California weekend, folks. This
is Brent Cray and that's the
news on KXXX. So now you
know!
And the "folks" feel satisfied
that they have dutifully taken
the trouble to find out what's
going on in the world.
But the world presented to
them by the mass media is one
that thrives on sex, violence
and trivia. What's more, it is
grossly distorted, giving the
impression that the United
States makes up about 75 per
cent of the news and other
countries the remaining 25
percent.
Except in news magazines

like Time and Newsweek and a
few dailies such as The New
York Times and the Wall Street
Journal, international news is
reduced to blurbs to make
room for inconsequential but
easy-to-read local tales.
The international news
stories that do make it on the
news pages or over the
airwaves must be grossly sen
sational to fit the sex, violence
and trivia theme.
The American mass media
takes the stance, however, that
thorough coverage of local,
regional and national news is
one of its strongest points.
Also, they point out that the
nearer the news is to the audi
ence, the more meaningful.
True as this is, Americans can
no longer isolate themselves,
and the mass media is in the
best position to change this
trend.
Countries in today's world
are closely related. Regional
news often has national and in
ternational significance, and
vice versa. If the United States
wants to retain its position as a
world power, its citizens must
change their egocentric view
of the world.
From grade school on,
Americans are taught (rightlv)
to love their country. But un
less consciously prevented,

national pride can result in un
appreciated patronization of
other countries.
Many countries, such as
Mexico, the Philippines and
Iran, are now critical of the
U.S. handling of foreign rela
tions. Time magazine reports:
"Carter will find his hosts (in
Mexico) expecting to be
treated with more respect than
U.S. presidents have shown in
the past."
Time columnist Hugh Sidey
writes, "There is a growing be
lief in this country and around
the world that the United
States is losing control of
events and faltering in its role
as the free world's leader."
Why is this happening? Is the
U.S. slipping?
Perhaps it all goes back to
Brent Gray and his news
broadcast.
In their involvement with
domestic affairs, few Ameri
cans have kept up with the rest
of the world. They've led the
industrial world without mak
ing an effort to understand the
sentiments of their neighbors.
And now they don't reallycare.
After all, if you've been
brought up on a junk food diet
of sex, violence and trivia, and
you haven't felt any ill effects,
why change to more substan
tial but often less tasty fare?

the past."
Time columnist Hugh Sidey
writes, "There is a growing be
lief in this country and around
the world that the United
States is losing control of
events and faltering in its role
as the free world's leader."
Why is this happening? Is the
U.S. slipping?
Perhaps it all goes back to
Brent Gray and his news
broadcast.
In their involvement with
domestic affairs, few Ameri
cans have kept up with the rest
of the world. They've led the
industrial world without mak
ing an effort to understand the
sentiments of their neighbors.
And now they don't reallycare.
After all, if you've been
brought up on a junk food diet
of sex, violence and trivia, and
you haven't felt any ill effects,
why change to more substan
tial but often less tasty fare?
