# Lifespring geared toward individual growth

She is warm, spontaneous,
charismatic and empathetic,
and she supports the growth of
her friends without imposing
her own judgments. She is
Aleen Zimberoff, a graduate of
Lifespring.
Zimberoff, a sophomore
here, said she first took an in
terest in Lifespring when she
heard about it from friends in
1975.
"I liked the changes I saw in
my friends," she said. "They
were a lot more positive, more
energetic, and they took more
responsibility for what was
happening in their own lives.
Two years later, Zimberoff
took Lifespring herself and said
she emerged with an enriched
outlook on life.
"I am completely accounta
ble for all the things that hap
pen in my life," she said.
"There are no accidents. Al
though that sounds unrealistic,
for me it's totally true and I be
lieve in it entirely."
An accountability point of
view is only one premise Lifes
pring teaches. It assists
trainees in becoming aware of
and in confronting many of the
debilitating beliefs and fixed
attitudes about themselves and
others that everyone clings to
unconsciously.
Lifespring is a five-day event
with sessions Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday nights and
all-day sessions on Saturday
and Sunday.
"The training is personal,"
said Karen Hess, basic enroll
ment staff member. "Different
people get different things from
it because they come in want
ing different things from the
training."
The training includes pro
cesses and exercises geared
toward individual growth.
"The basic purpose of Lifes
pring is to assist people in get
ting on with their lives," said
Lynn Werner, secretary to
Lifespring President John Han
ley. "The reason people take
the training is to do just that.
"It's kind of like an ac
celerator," she continued.
"My life was working well but
there were areas I needed to
grow in."
David Jaffe, a freshman here
and a basic training graduate,
said the training helped him
most in his relationships with
people. People play communi
cation games to keep others
away from their real selves, he
said. The training taught him to
recognize his games, and to

experience emotions with
others, he added.
Still, Jaffe admitted that an
artificial atmosphere exists
within the training group. Be
cause Lifespring maintains a
confidentiality rule, Jaffe de
scribed the training environ
ment as "safe."
"It's very safe to be emo
tional," he said. "But there are
problems when you come out
and it's not so safe."
Jaffe also said the emotional
high the trainees emerge with
wears off.
Lifespring allows all trainees
to renew their basic training
free of charge, after they have
initially taken the program for a
cost of $300.
jaffe cited the cost as
another negative aspect, say
ing, "They don't need to
charge so much."
Hess said tuition has only
risen $100 since January of
1974, when Lifespring started.
She said about 70 percent of
the tuition goes to paying
trainers and renting facilities. A
great deal of the remainder of
the tuition is spent on expan
sion of the Lifespring program.
Even with its success,
Werner admitted many people
are skeptical about Lifespring.
Werner said she thought
skepticism resulted from fear.

She said she herself was afraid
at the initial thought of the
training because it is a self
examination.
But after the full training she
said she was "putting her own
feelings and fears into skepti
cism.
"It wasn't stemming from
Lifespring," she said. "There's
a skeptic in everything you're
in."
Jaffe said initial skepticism
should not be ignored. "It's
not good for everyone," he
said. "People with psychologi
cal problems should not go
through it."
He said that a friend of his
was disturbed upon entering
the training and the self explo
ration triggered a nervous
breakdown.
Lifespring leadership officials
agree that the training isn't for
those under psychological
care. Those who have been in
therapy within the last six
months must obtain their
therapist's signed agreement
to take the training.
Beyond the basic training,
Lifespring offers a $650 secon
dary training, Interpersonal
Experience (IPE).
Zimberoff said she knew she
would take IPE eventually, but
for her, the experience was
especially meaningful.

"Six hundred fifty dollars is
an insignificant amount in my
lifetime," Zimberoff said. "It is
a monetary figure, and when I
consider how much further my
life has progressed by spend
ing it, I feel it is $650 put to an
invaluably good use."
However, Zimberoff said her
father was enraged when he
heard she had taken the train
ing and threatened to cut off
her college tuition money.
"I am a tester," Zimberoff
said. "I set up things in my life
to test my own belief system.
Through IPE, I had the perfect
means to validate that I am an
independent woman. I had no
assistance from my father.
"It's a total commitment,"
she said. "It's very much a per
sonalized growth training and
that's totally up to you."
Zimberoff said she is plan
ning to enroll in the Training
Coordinator Program. It is a
results-oriented, 70-day ex
perience that consists of three
weekend trainings, once
weekly early morning meet
ings and a service commitment
to Lifespring. There is no tui
tion charge.
Lifespring also operates Laser
Leadership sessions for
employee groups. The training
examines the relationship of
the overall organization and

the effectiveness of the
employees.
"We try to look at the per
sonal aspect as well as the or
ganizational aspect, and then
we tailor a personalized train
ing for them," Werner said.
All the graduates agree
Lifespring is an experience in
sharing. The processes are al
ways done with people who
don't know each other be
cause "with friends there is too
much interest and too much
room to hurt yourself," Zim
beroff said.
"You get in touch with who
you are inside and how you
handle experiences," Werner
said. "There's a lot of sharing
that goes on in our training and
you get very close to everyone.
It's a cohesive, deep friend
ship. There's no feeling of cult
but when you meet someone
who's gone through the train
ing there is a bond because you
know they've taken a good
look at themselves and you've
shared a common experi
ence."

therapy within the last six
months must obtain their
therapist's signed agreement
to take the training.
Beyond the basic training,
Lifespring offers a $650 secon
dary training, Interpersonal
Experience (IPE).
Zimberoff said she knew she
would take IPE eventually, but
for her, the experience was
especially meaningful.

"Six hundred fifty dollars is
an insignificant amount in my
lifetime," Zimberoff said. "It is
a monetary figure, and when I
consider how much further my
life has progressed by spend
ing it, I feel it is $650 put to an
invaluably good use."
However, Zimberoff said her
father was enraged when he
heard she had taken the train
ing and threatened to cut off
her college tuition money.
"I am a tester," Zimberoff
said. "I set up things in my life
to test my own belief system.
Through IPE, I had the perfect
means to validate that I am an
independent woman. I had no
assistance from my father.
"It's a total commitment,"
she said. "It's very much a per
sonalized growth training and
that's totally up to you."
Zimberoff said she is plan
ning to enroll in the Training
Coordinator Program. It is a
results-oriented, 70-day ex
perience that consists of three
weekend trainings, once
weekly early morning meet
ings and a service commitment
to Lifespring. There is no tui
tion charge.
Lifespring also operates Laser
Leadership sessions for
employee groups. The training
examines the relationship of
the overall organization and

the effectiveness of the
employees.
"We try to look at the per
sonal aspect as well as the or
ganizational aspect, and then
we tailor a personalized train
ing for them," Werner said.
All the graduates agree
Lifespring is an experience in
sharing. The processes are al
ways done with people who
don't know each other be
cause "with friends there is too
much interest and too much
room to hurt yourself," Zim
beroff said.
"You get in touch with who
you are inside and how you
handle experiences," Werner
said. "There's a lot of sharing
that goes on in our training and
you get very close to everyone.
It's a cohesive, deep friend
ship. There's no feeling of cult
but when you meet someone
who's gone through the train
ing there is a bond because you
know they've taken a good
look at themselves and you've
shared a common experi
ence."
She is warm, spontaneous,
charismatic and empathetic,
and she supports the growth of
her friends without imposing
her own judgments. She is
Aleen Zimberoff, a graduate of
Lifespring.
Zimberoff, a sophomore
here, said she first took an in
terest in Lifespring when she
heard about it from friends in
1975.
"I liked the changes I saw in
my friends," she said. "They
were a lot more positive, more
energetic, and they took more
responsibility for what was
happening in their own lives.
Two years later, Zimberoff
took Lifespring herself and said
she emerged with an enriched
outlook on life.
"I am completely accounta
ble for all the things that hap
pen in my life," she said.
"There are no accidents. Al
though that sounds unrealistic,
for me it's totally true and I be
lieve in it entirely."
An accountability point of
view is only one premise Lifes
pring teaches. It assists
trainees in becoming aware of
and in confronting many of the
debilitating beliefs and fixed
attitudes about themselves and
others that everyone clings to
unconsciously.
Lifespring is a five-day event
with sessions Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday nights and
all-day sessions on Saturday
and Sunday.
"The training is personal,"
said Karen Hess, basic enroll
ment staff member. "Different
people get different things from
it because they come in want
ing different things from the
training."
The training includes pro
cesses and exercises geared
toward individual growth.
"The basic purpose of Lifes
pring is to assist people in get
ting on with their lives," said
Lynn Werner, secretary to
Lifespring President John Han
ley. "The reason people take
the training is to do just that.
"It's kind of like an ac
celerator," she continued.
"My life was working well but
there were areas I needed to
grow in."
David Jaffe, a freshman here
and a basic training graduate,
said the training helped him
most in his relationships with
people. People play communi
cation games to keep others
away from their real selves, he
said. The training taught him to
recognize his games, and to

experience emotions with
others, he added.
Still, Jaffe admitted that an
artificial atmosphere exists
within the training group. Be
cause Lifespring maintains a
confidentiality rule, Jaffe de
scribed the training environ
ment as "safe."
"It's very safe to be emo
tional," he said. "But there are
problems when you come out
and it's not so safe."
Jaffe also said the emotional
high the trainees emerge with
wears off.
Lifespring allows all trainees
to renew their basic training
free of charge, after they have
initially taken the program for a
cost of $300.
jaffe cited the cost as
another negative aspect, say
ing, "They don't need to
charge so much."
Hess said tuition has only
risen $100 since January of
1974, when Lifespring started.
She said about 70 percent of
the tuition goes to paying
trainers and renting facilities. A
great deal of the remainder of
the tuition is spent on expan
sion of the Lifespring program.
Even with its success,
Werner admitted many people
are skeptical about Lifespring.
Werner said she thought
skepticism resulted from fear.

She said she herself was afraid
at the initial thought of the
training because it is a self
examination.
But after the full training she
said she was "putting her own
feelings and fears into skepti
cism.
"It wasn't stemming from
Lifespring," she said. "There's
a skeptic in everything you're
in."
Jaffe said initial skepticism
should not be ignored. "It's
not good for everyone," he
said. "People with psychologi
cal problems should not go
through it."
He said that a friend of his
was disturbed upon entering
the training and the self explo
ration triggered a nervous
breakdown.
Lifespring leadership officials
agree that the training isn't for
those under psychological
care. Those who have been in
