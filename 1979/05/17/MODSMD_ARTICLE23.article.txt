# — Years after 'separate but equal' ruling
## Racial equality still unrealized 
### 
Topeka, Kan. (AP) — Twenty-five years
after the U.S. Supreme Court decreed
that "separate but equal" schools were
unconstitutional in this city and all
others in the United States, Topekans
who fought the landmark legal battle
say full racial equality has still not ar
rived.
Vestiges of segregation remain in this
city today, they insist, even though the
Court decreed on May 17, 1954, in the
Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka
decision that children of all races had
the right to attend the school of their
choice.
Charles Scott, one of the attorneys
who represented Linda Brown and 11
other black Topeka children and their
parents 25 years ago, said in a recent
interview there has been some prog
ress in school desegregation here, but
not as much as he would have liked.
"I guess I could say that there has not

been the rapid progress that we had
expected in the span of 25 years," Scott
said.
The schools in the heavily minority
east side of Topeka do not have the
same quality facilities or curricula as
schools in the more affluent western
and southern parts of the city, Scott
said.
"Whether that is due to race, I don't
know, but that is certainly a suspect,"
he said.
The Brown decision struck down a
1949 Kansas law which allowed racial
segregation of school children in some
cities. In the early 19505, Kansas was
one of four states which permitted
segregation, while 17 states and the
District of Columbia required segrega
tion.
In the decision, then-Chief Justice
Earl Warren wrote, "Separate educa
tional facilities are inherently un

equal." Therefore, the doctrine viol
ated the equal protection clause of the
14th Amendment.
In recent months, a 16-year old To
peka student, Evelyn Rene Johnson,
sued the city's school board in federal
court because she claimed she was get
ting an inferior education at the pre
dominantly black Parkdale Elementary
School, now closed.
Although school officials insist there
was no basis for the suit and that they
could have won it, the board's insur
ance company settled the case out of
court last December for $19,500, saying
it would be cheaper to settle than to
defend the suit.
One of the plaintiffs in the Brown
case, Lucinda Todd, a former Topeka
school teacher, recalls she felt compel
led to join the suit, first filed in 1951,
because educational conditions were
so bad for minority students.
