# TV film on autistic child sparks emotional debate
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Barry and
Suzy Kaufman wanted their
young son, Raun, to have an
alternative to conventional
therapy for autistic children.
They spent three years, Kauf
man says, "in Raun's world,"
gradually pulling the child into
their own.
Now that the Kaufmans'
story has been broadcast for
the first time (Monday on
NBC), the couple has become
embroiled in a dispute with the
National Society for Autistic
Children.
"We're extremely con
cerned," says Kaufman, "be
cause they've attacked the
program and us personally.
"We did something very
special, something nobody
else had tried to do. We tried to
parallel his world in such a way
as to create bridges with him,
so he would understand us."
"Attack" is, perhaps, too
strong a word, though the soc
iety most certainly has
suggested to local chapters

that letters of protest be di
rected to the Kaufmans.
A definition
Autism is defined as "a se
verely incapacitating life-long
developmental disability." The
society says there are 108,000
people in America with autism.
In Raun Kaufmans' case, he
seemed locked in his own
world, unresponsive to verbal
or other stimulation. He was
diagnosed autistic as an infant,
but the Kaufmans were told
treatment could not begin until
he was at least three years old.
The Roslyn Heights, N.V.,
couple truly attempted to enter
the child's world. They
mimicked his characteristic
rocking, arm-flapping move
ment, spending 9700 hours
with the child over three years.
Now normal
The effort was a success; the
child —now 6 — is normal in
appearance and action, far
above average in intelligence,
and attending school with
youngsters his own age.
The controversy — stirred in
itially by Kaufman's book, Son
Rise, published three years
ago, and intensified many
times over by the film broad
cast Monday — is hardiy clear
cut.
Indeed, the society, repre
senting about 6500 parents and
professionals, describes "Son
Rise: A Miracle of Love," as a
"beautifully done movie" that
"will give the American public
a view of autism that it has
never had before."

Yet it suggests a grave reser
vation: "It causes many pa
rents of children with autism
deep and unnecessary feelings
of guilt."
Says Robert Griggs, the soci
ety's executive director, "The
movie is telling some parents
their kid didn't get well like
Raun because they didn't love
him enough."
Kaufman, to that point,
suggests at the outset of the
film, "It concerns an alterna
tive created and chosen by our
family, which in no way is
meant to be a commentary on
others who may have found
themselves in similar cir
cumstances." He calls Son Rise
an "expression of hope and
possibility."
Direct letters
Griggs, asked about the
suggestion that parents critical
of the film write the Kaufmans
directly, said: "Some people
may take exception to implica
tions of the book and movie,
some may take exception to
the portrayal of behavior mod
ification."
In fad, the Kaufmans' ap
proach was in a sense in reac
tion to "behavior modifica
tion," one conventional
method of therapy. The society
says the view of behavior mod
ification in Son Rise is "grossly
unfair."
"Most treatment programs
are based on disapproval of the
child's behavior," says Kauf
man, "and we felt the underly
ing point of view was that all
professionals we talked with
felt that being autistic was a
tragedy.
I'm OK, you're OK
"We tried to say to Raun,
Hey, it's OK where you are.
We love you the way you are,
and want to be with you.' "
The society, in sum, de
clares: "A child with autism
and his parents are fairly por
trayed in this movie until this
business of love and accep
tance overcoming a neurologi
cal disorder takes over."
"It's a story of loving and ac
cepting someone," says Kaut
man, clearly disturbed by the
controversy. "The society is
supposed to be neutral, but
they support programs for be
havior modification and won't
accept the way we did it."
