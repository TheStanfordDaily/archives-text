# Three Mile Island hearings begin
## Nuclear investigator digs for truth 
### 
Washington (AP) — John
Kemeny has a fondness for de
tective stories and designing
computer games. And, he says,
investigating the Three Mile Is
land nuclear reactor accident
may include a little bit of both.
Kemeny, the president of
Dartmouth College and one of
the country's leading
mathematicians, is chairman of
the 12-member presidential
commission examining the ac
cident. Today the commis
sion begins three days of hear
ings in Middletown, Pa., near
the damaged reactor.
A stocky, unathletic man
whose only sign of tension
seems to be chain smoking,
Kemeny is said by associates to
bring to the inquiry a keen
mind and a determination to
ask questions until he gets
answers.
"If you hear the same story
enough different ways you just
keep digging until you get the

truth," Kemeny, 52, told a
group of Dartmouth almuni re
cently.
Although he has no
background in nuclear
physics, Kemeny will
spearhead the investigation
which he believes could have
wide-ranging impact on the fu
ture of the nation's atomic
power program. President Car
ter wants a report and recom
mendations by Oct. 25.
As Dartmouth president
since 1970, Kemeny has stayed
aloof from the nuclear power
debate. Last September in a
convocation speech, however,
he decried those who try to
solve complicated issues with
simple solutions and used the
nuclear power issue as an
example.
His only other involvement
with nuclear energy was when,
as a Princeton undergraduate
and Army draftee, he was a
mathematician on the project
to develop the atomic bomb at
Los Alamos, N.M.
On the Dartmouth campus
in Hanover, N.H., Kemeny is
described by students and fa
culty as "extremely intelligent"
and a man who above all loves
to teach. His mathematics
courses — he tries to teach at
least one each term — are
sought out.

But Kemeny's nine years as
president have not been with
out controversy as the 210-
year-old college underwent a
number of changes, including
for the first time enrolling wo
men. Just days after taking over
in 1970, Kemeny headed off a
confrontation by dismissing
formal classes for a week be
cause of the killing of four stu
dents at Kent State and urging
professors to hold seminars to
discuss the Vietnam war and
the Kent State shootings.
"He turned a political crisis
into an education experience,"
recalled Dartmouth spokes
man Bob Graham. Other as
sociates cite the action as an
example of Kemeny's ability to
think clearly under stress.
One student, critical of
Kemeny because she claims he
could do more to increase en
rollment of women, neverthe
less calls him "an amazing
mathematician. ... He has a
mind like a calculator."
Kemeny came to Dartmouth
in 1954 and was named to head
the mathematics department a
year later at the age of 29. Over
the years he distinguished
himself as one of the country's
foremost authorities on com
puters. Among his 13 books is
one, written with another
professor, which has enabled

thousands of novices to "talk"
with computers by using writ
ten messages.
He is fascinated by computer
games and years ago had a
computer terminal installed in
his house. And, he said in an
interview the other day in his
still barren commission office
in downtown Washington, the
games and detective stories are
not unlike the Three Mile Is
land investigation.
"In some of the best detec
tive stories you get halfway
through the book and they get
you to the point where you're
totally confused and you don't
know what to believe. I think
that's where we're starting in
this investigation."
Kemeny said he agreed with
some reluctance to head the
commission and after the job is
finished will look forward to re
turning full time to Dartmouth
where "I hope to spend the
rest of my life."
But Kemeny's origins could
not have been farther from the
Ivy League.
Born May 31, 1926 in
Budapest, Hungary, he came
to the United States in 1940 as a
youth fascinated with
mathematics. His parents, fle
eing the Nazis, had left almost
everything behind, even their
luggage.
