# Panel discusses African role
## 
### Lane Webster 
The Pied Piper luring children into
the sea to drown depicts the West's
treatment of the African states in the
last 500 years, the poet Chinweizu
said. He was one of three panelists at
a forum held Tuesday night in Bishop
Auditorium.
The newly-organized Stanford Af
rican Students Association (SASA)
and the African Studies Committee
convened the panel to discuss Afri
ca's role from a global perspective as
part of the first annual Africa Week.
Chinweizu, now associate editor
of an African literary magazine,
Okike, has written two books, The
West and the Rest of Us and Energy
Crisis and Other Poems.
He was born in Nigeria and is cur
rently working in the black studies
program at San Jose State University.
He said he deplores African depen
dence on the West.
'Instrument of plunder'
"The market economy is an in
strument of plunder," he said. "It
does it so well that the man being
robbed thinks he is being blessed."
Casting the problem in economic
terms, Tetteh Kofi, associate profes
sor at the Food Research Institute,
said the dilemma for Africans is what
to do when a precapitalist economy
interacts with a capitalist economy.
"You get dominated or you can
face up to the challenge," he said.
Currently, Kofi said, domination,
not independence, is the norm in Af
rica. Despite the recent Western in
dustrial recovery, the economic
growth rate in Africa, excluding
Nigeria, is a relatively small 2 percent
per year.
Worse is the scarcity of food, polit

ical instability and mounting foreign
debts which all paralyze African
strength, Kofi explained.
Zaire remains burdened with $1.5
billion in debts, while Sengal faces an
uphill climb paying 9.4 percent of its
export revenue to service its current
debts.
Clues
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell
Jackson eyed recent U.S. diplomatic
behavior for clues to what might be
in store for Africa.
Abandoning the Shah in Iran
shows that the U.S. may endorse a
new "doctrine of dispensability" re
garding right wing governments,
Jackson said.
He added that he believes the Un
ited States will support "mildly
socialistic" governments because
rivalries among Asian socialist coun
tries have destroyed the illusion that
socialism is a united international
movement.
But where business is concerned,
Jackson added, American policy is to
lerant of governments "totalitarian
or not."
Dinosaurs
"The West has got itself precisely
in the position that the dinosaurs
came to," Chinweizu said. He added
that an Africa that would chart its
own future must avoid the "glossy
glamor" of the westernizing road.
He identified the prime fault in
Western thinking as possessiveness.
It comes from the elevation of indi
vidual rights, he said, which translate
into property rights and amount to "a
muttonchop of hubris."
Some of the 30 persons who at
tended the forum expressed impati
ence with the historical explanations

of the West's imposition in Africa.
They wanted to know precisely what
mechanisms of domination keep Af
rica in a state of subjection.
"It's a question of the gold digger
who doesn't find gold in a hole, but
keeps on digging until he finds it,"
Morgan Ohwovoriole, a doctoral
candidate in mechanical engineer
ing, said.
SASA seeks to arrange forums for
discussion about political issues af

dent, Lipumba.
