## rock/lou presley Commander slays disco 
### 
Had I not been told who he was, I might have
thought that this guy named Commander Cody
was the greased-out auto mechanic that
worked on my car a little while ago. Actually, he
might have been. And if he was, he did a lot
better job rock n rollin' the hell out of the Keys
tone Palo Alto than he did on my carburetor.
And there was his lead guitarist Bill Kirchen,
who I swear was playing licks that would knock
your socks off in your sleep. For the better part of
both of the Commander's two sets Friday night I
sat in bewilderment as the energetically laid
back Kirchen made me want to get up and dance
y at his feet. And I would have too, if I could have
. found a date. But that's another story.
Kicking
The real story is that the Commander, who I
"hadn't heard anything from since his big hit,
"Hot Rod Lincoln" (remember that one? Sure
you do.) is still very much alive, and I don't
expect to see him quit kicking for awhile either.
Opening up the show was Pearl and the Cos
mic Blues Band. If you're worried about clones
taking over, don't see this band. What Pearl and
his band amount to are a surprisingly accurate
copy of )anis Joplin and her band. Even down to
the bottle of Southern Comfort. In fact, about
* the only thing that gave Pearl away as a phony
was his inability to polish off the entire bottle
like Janis surely would have.
Pearl was pretty entertaining — for about two
•songs. Then the novelty wore off, and the crowd
began to get very restless. Restless to the point
of yelling for the Commander during Pearl's im
passioned, twisted, pauses. Sorry Pearl, you
lose.
Then finally, after two long sets and an encore
for Pearl (why?), out strolled the Commander,
ready for action. After a couple of quick struts
ground the stage, he sat himself down at the
piano and banged out "The Lone Ranger." That
was followed by "Beat Me Daddy (Eight to the
Bar)," a new one called "Two Triple Cheese and

a Side of Fries," and "a real sad one," the classic
"Seeds and Stems (Again)."
The Commander had quickly set the mood for
the night. He would play several new songs that
he was soon to record, but it was the good old
stuff that everyone wanted to hear that occupied
most of the show.
The thing about the Commander is that he is
so uninhibited that half the show would be lost if
he didn't run around the stage waving his too
long arms and dancing like he didn't give a shit
about anything else. He'll fly around the stage
and Kirchen will slip his half-done cigarette back
between the strings in the head of his guitar and
the stage will look like chaos while the verse
sounds like gold.
The problem with the Commander commer
cially is something he summed-up himself when
he told the audience that he just got back from
L.A. and Warner Brothers thought they were too
raunchy to sell. I guess that's why I hadn't heard
from him for awhile.
Humor
It's too bad, too, because he has a sense of
humor that won't quit. Take, for example, his
modernized version of "Hot Rod Lincoln." Oh,
it was basically the same song, except that close
to the end he stopped singing, the bass drum
got really loud and the guitar part started to
sound bad, and before we knew it, it was
"Disco Lincoln." The Commander, however has
not gone disco. It was just a clever put down,
thank Cod.
At the end of the first set, the Commander
said that he was going to go out and roam
around the streets looking for drugs. He really
must have, because he came back for the sec
ond set with all the energy of the first. And he
maintained the energy level throughout the set.
After two encores from the begging crowd,
the Commander had to leave the stage, drink in
hand. "For all them people that stayed home
and watched TV," he said, "fuck 'em."

of yelling for the Commander during Pearl's im
passioned, twisted, pauses. Sorry Pearl, you
lose.
Then finally, after two long sets and an encore
for Pearl (why?), out strolled the Commander,
ready for action. After a couple of quick struts
ground the stage, he sat himself down at the
piano and banged out "The Lone Ranger." That
was followed by "Beat Me Daddy (Eight to the
Bar)," a new one called "Two Triple Cheese and

a Side of Fries," and "a real sad one," the classic
"Seeds and Stems (Again)."
The Commander had quickly set the mood for
the night. He would play several new songs that
he was soon to record, but it was the good old
stuff that everyone wanted to hear that occupied
most of the show.
The thing about the Commander is that he is
so uninhibited that half the show would be lost if
he didn't run around the stage waving his too
long arms and dancing like he didn't give a shit
about anything else. He'll fly around the stage
and Kirchen will slip his half-done cigarette back
between the strings in the head of his guitar and
the stage will look like chaos while the verse
sounds like gold.
The problem with the Commander commer
cially is something he summed-up himself when
he told the audience that he just got back from
L.A. and Warner Brothers thought they were too
raunchy to sell. I guess that's why I hadn't heard
from him for awhile.
Humor
It's too bad, too, because he has a sense of
humor that won't quit. Take, for example, his
modernized version of "Hot Rod Lincoln." Oh,
it was basically the same song, except that close
to the end he stopped singing, the bass drum
got really loud and the guitar part started to
sound bad, and before we knew it, it was
"Disco Lincoln." The Commander, however has
not gone disco. It was just a clever put down,
thank Cod.
At the end of the first set, the Commander
said that he was going to go out and roam
around the streets looking for drugs. He really
must have, because he came back for the sec
ond set with all the energy of the first. And he
maintained the energy level throughout the set.
After two encores from the begging crowd,
the Commander had to leave the stage, drink in
hand. "For all them people that stayed home
and watched TV," he said, "fuck 'em."

Had I not been told who he was, I might have
thought that this guy named Commander Cody
was the greased-out auto mechanic that
worked on my car a little while ago. Actually, he
might have been. And if he was, he did a lot
better job rock n rollin' the hell out of the Keys
tone Palo Alto than he did on my carburetor.
And there was his lead guitarist Bill Kirchen,
who I swear was playing licks that would knock
your socks off in your sleep. For the better part of
both of the Commander's two sets Friday night I
sat in bewilderment as the energetically laid
back Kirchen made me want to get up and dance
y at his feet. And I would have too, if I could have
. found a date. But that's another story.
Kicking
The real story is that the Commander, who I
"hadn't heard anything from since his big hit,
"Hot Rod Lincoln" (remember that one? Sure
you do.) is still very much alive, and I don't
expect to see him quit kicking for awhile either.
Opening up the show was Pearl and the Cos
mic Blues Band. If you're worried about clones
taking over, don't see this band. What Pearl and
his band amount to are a surprisingly accurate
copy of )anis Joplin and her band. Even down to
the bottle of Southern Comfort. In fact, about
* the only thing that gave Pearl away as a phony
was his inability to polish off the entire bottle
like Janis surely would have.
Pearl was pretty entertaining — for about two
•songs. Then the novelty wore off, and the crowd
began to get very restless. Restless to the point
of yelling for the Commander during Pearl's im
passioned, twisted, pauses. Sorry Pearl, you
lose.
Then finally, after two long sets and an encore
for Pearl (why?), out strolled the Commander,
ready for action. After a couple of quick struts
ground the stage, he sat himself down at the
