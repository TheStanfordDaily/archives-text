# 50,000 gallons a day
## California may get more gas 
### 
Washington (AP) — President Car
ter, saying no illegal oil industry ac
tivity has been tied to the California
energy crunch, offered proposals
yesterday that an adviser said could
cut the state's gasoline shortage by
50,000 gallons a day.
Carter also said he had asked the
Justice Department to launch an in
vestigation to make sure oil com
panies are not illegally withholding
oil from the market to await higher
prices.
In a report prepared by the Depart
ment of Energy, Carter recom
mended increased monitoring of oil
industry activities, relaxed environ
mental standards, and stricter en
forcement of the 55-mile-per-hour
speed limit, among other proposals.
Gov. Jerry Brown of California flew
to Washington to plead his
gasoline-starved state's case at a
White House meeting with political
overtones for the two potential rivals
for the 1980 Democratic presidential
nomination.
Following the meeting, Carter told
reporters his proposals, along with a
change in gasoline allocation rules,
"will have a beneficial effect" in deal
ing with California's gasoline shor
tage. _
According to Brown and White
House officials, the president told
the California governor that a May 1
decision to base gasoline allocations
on late 1978 and early 1979 consump
tion figures rather than 1972 figures

would also increase supplies for the
State.
The more recent base reflects the
growth that has taken place in
California, White House press sec
retary )ody Powell said.
Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger estimated that Carter's
action would mean tht 50,000 addi
tional gallons of gasoline will be av
ailable in California each day. The
shortage has been estimated at «
70,000 gallons a day. <
The Energy Department's report
attributed the California supply
problems and the long lines at
gasoline filling stations to "the
higher rate of growth in gasoline
demand in that state."
Brown said Carter told him that
"May will be the lowest allocation of
gasoline. In June, things will im
prove."
Participants in the meeting, which
included most of the state's 45-
member congressional delegation,
said Carter promised to restore the
state's allocation of fuel to the same
level it received in 1978. It has been
90 to 92 percent of that.
Powell said supplies in California
and elsewhere would reach this level
in June of July.
The White House meeting was in
itiated by Brown, who announced
earlier in the week he was flying to
Washington to talk to the president
about California's gasoline prob
lems.
On Tuesday, White House aides
rounded up the congressional dele
gation to join what had been ex
pected to be a tete-a-tete between
Carter and Brown.
The govenor conferred privately
with Carter and Sen. Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.) for about 10 minutes be
fore the one-hour meeting with the
entire delegation.
Asked whether he noticed any
political antagonisms, Brown said:
"None, on the surface. I always get a
fairly friendly reception. We get
along extraordinarily well."
"I'm convinced the president is
concerned" about California's prob
lems, Brown said.

He predicted that if the gasoline
problems are not solved, the trouble
his state is facing could appear
elsewhere in he nation.
"California is in a state of shock,
frustration and anger," he said. "I
don't think it is going to spread."
The governor, who has often advo
cated restrained growth, said he told
Carter current allocations of gasoline
were based on consumption in 1972
and that since then the state has
created 1 million new jobs.
Without sufficient gasoline to con
tinue such growth, Brown con
tended, "the specter of recession
can turn into reality by the end of the
year."
Members of the state's congres
sional delegation said the increased
allocation, in the face of Carter's ef
forts to encourage conservation,
would be made based on the state's
growth.
As the meeting began, an aide to
Cranston said the Carter administra
tion had devised a plan to increase
gasoline in California.
The plan included:
— Increasing from J percent to 5
percent the amount of the state's fuel
allocation that can be set aside for
use at the governor's discretion. This
will not increase supplies entering
the state but will give Brown greater
flexibility in how it is used.
— The appointment of a Carter
representative to coordinate state
and federal efforts to ease the shor
taße"
—Restricting gasoline for military
activities in California to "essential
uses."
— Monitoring and auditing by the
Energy Department and the Justice
Department of oil industry opera
tions in Western states.
In addition, it was decided that if
Brown moves to relax state air pollu
tion standards that are stricter than
federal rules, the federal Environ
mental Protection Agency would not
object.
Brown declined to join Cranston's
earlier call for the replacement of
James Schlesinger as secretary of
energy.
