Curb eases leaded gas limits
San Francisco — California's lieutenant governor
signed an executive order yesterday relaxing re
strictions on the lead content of gasoline, saying
the shortage of gasoline and lengthening lines at
the pump called for immediate action.
Gov. Jerry Brown, who returned to the state
hours after Lt. Gov. Mike Curb ordered the
change, promptly issued a statement saying he
would rescind the action.
As Brown flew back to California, he issued a
terse statement through his press secretary, Bob
bie Metzger.
"Earlier today, before Curb took his action, Gray
Davis, the governor's chief of staff, advised Curb's
top aide, Shel Lytton, that if the order were signed,
it would be rescinded," Metzger said.
Curb said his order would make it easier for
refineries to make leaded gasoline and would in
crease gasoline production by as much as one
million gallons a day, a 3 percent increase.
Brown, however, is counting on other measures
to improve the situation —at least a little — before
then. He ordered larger stations to stay open on
either Saturday or Sunday starting this weekend, a
move designed to shorten the weekday lines of
motorists forced to go gasless all weekend.
House passes Alaska land bill
Washington — The House yesterday passed the
conservationist-backed Alaska land bill, setting
aside more than 100 million acres for wildlife re
fuges and wilderness.
House passage came on a 360-55 vote shortly
after members had thrown out a rival measure
backed by industry.
The bill now goes to the Senate. A similar mea
sure, which would have set aside about one-third
of Alaska for national parks, wilderness areas and
refuges, died in the Senate last year.
House approval of the bill,' sponsored by Rep.
Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), marked a significant victory
for President Jimmy Carterand fora wide coalition
of environmental groups. Carter had called the
measure his top environmental priority.
The measure sets aside 110 million acres of
Alaska land for national parks, preserves, wild
river areas and wilderness. It would roughly dou
ble the size of the national park system.
Soviets improve Saudi relations
Moscow — The Soviet Union will make every
effort to exploit the rift in delicate relations bet
ween Saudi Arabia and the United States, Western
analysts here say.
According to diplomatic sources, the Soviets —
who have no diplomatic relations with Saudi
Arabia — have been in contact with the Saudis
recently through third parties, said to be Morocco
and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Moscow diplomats see little chance of full-scale
Saudi-Soviet ties at least until 1981. But lesser links
could be initiated.
Direct contacts reportedly have been made by
the two nations in European capitals, but the exact
nature of these contacts is not known.
Middle East rumors that Soviet-Saudi relations
might be resumed seemed more substantial re
cently following strong Saudi opposition to the

Egyptian-Israeli peace pact and controversial U.S.
intelligence reports describing a supposed split
inside the Arabian kingdom's ruling family.
Harvard upgrades curriculum
Cambridge, Mass. — Harvard's first major over
haul of its undergraduate curriculum in 34 years —
requiring graduates to prove they can write, do
math and read a foreign language — was greeted
enthusiastically yesterday by the nation's top edu
cation official.
The core curriculum unveiled also abolishes re
quired general survey courses in favor of highly
focused subjects that stress the process of think
ing. Instead of taking such courses as "Survey of
American History," next fall's Harvard freshmen
will fulfill their history requirements by picking
from"The Christianization of the Roman World,"
"The Emancipation of the Jews" and"The Darwi
nian Revolution."
U.S. Commissioner of Education Ernest Boyer
said in Washington that he had long held the posi
tion that there is a certain "core" of knowledge
that should be part of an undergraduate educa
tion.
The change is likely to be imitated by planners at
other colleges.
Several other big universities, such as the Uni
versity of Chicago, the University of Missouri and
Northwestern, have already set up new core prog
rams.
State finds pesticide in wells
Sacramento — California officials, in a major
finding that could deal a nationwide blow to the
controversial pesticide DBCP, yesterday an
nounced discovery of traces of DBCP in 36
groundwater wells.
Aspokesman forthe U.S. Environmental Protec
tion Agency said the finding "could change EPA's
attitude" as it holds hearings on a possible
nationwide ban on the pesticide, now banned
only in California.
A total ban would have a dramatic effect on the
nation's growers, who rely almost exclusively on
DBCP, linked by studies to cancer and infertility,
to kill small worms that attack tree and vine crops.
Agriculture representatives, prior to this find
ing, had been pushing for the ban's lifting in
California, arguing crops such as grapes and citrus
would suffer millions of dollars in damage without
DBCP spraying.
The state Department of Food and Agriculture
announcement came after traces of the pesticide
were found in the agriculturally rich San Joaquin
Valley.
Before the state ban was imposed in August
1977, state agriculture officials estimated about 1.5
million pounds of the chemical were applied on
California crops annually.
White jury begins deliberations
San Francisco — Jurors in the murder trial of Dan
White began deliberations yesterday and asked
that White's taped 25-minute confession to the
shooting deaths of Mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk be replayed for them.
The tape was introduced by the prosecution.
White himself did not take the witness stand dur

ing the trial. His attorney concedes that White
fired the fatal shots, but claims the former super
visor was mentally ill at the time.
Prosecutor Tom Norman, calling White "a
cold-blooded killer," asked the jury to return a
conviction of first degree murder with special cir
cumstances.
California law provides the option of the death
penalty or life in prison without possibility of
parole if the jury finds that Moscone was killed in
retaliation for or to prevent him from carrying out
his elected duties or if the two slayings constitute
multiple killings.
Stocks show modest gain
New York — The stock market came on strong
near the close to post a modest gain yesterday
after drifting aimlessly for most of the session.

New York Stock Exchange volume picked up
slightly, reaching 28.35 million shares against 26.19
million Tuesday.

were found in the agriculturally rich San Joaquin
Valley.
Before the state ban was imposed in August
1977, state agriculture officials estimated about 1.5
million pounds of the chemical were applied on
California crops annually.
White jury begins deliberations
San Francisco — Jurors in the murder trial of Dan
White began deliberations yesterday and asked
that White's taped 25-minute confession to the
shooting deaths of Mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk be replayed for them.
The tape was introduced by the prosecution.
White himself did not take the witness stand dur

ing the trial. His attorney concedes that White
fired the fatal shots, but claims the former super
visor was mentally ill at the time.
Prosecutor Tom Norman, calling White "a
cold-blooded killer," asked the jury to return a
conviction of first degree murder with special cir
cumstances.
California law provides the option of the death
penalty or life in prison without possibility of
parole if the jury finds that Moscone was killed in
retaliation for or to prevent him from carrying out
his elected duties or if the two slayings constitute
multiple killings.
Stocks show modest gain
New York — The stock market came on strong
near the close to post a modest gain yesterday

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
more than a point heading into the last hour,
finished with a 2.60 gain at 828.48.
New York Stock Exchange volume picked up
slightly, reaching 28.35 million shares against 26.19
million Tuesday.
Today's weather
Fair and warmer through tomorrow. A few
patches of morning low clouds mainly near the
ocean. Lows in the 50s. Highs upper 60s near the
ocean to the 70s and low 80s inland both days.
North to northeast winds to 20 mph this afternoon.
Curb eases leaded gas limits
San Francisco — California's lieutenant governor
signed an executive order yesterday relaxing re
strictions on the lead content of gasoline, saying
the shortage of gasoline and lengthening lines at
the pump called for immediate action.
Gov. Jerry Brown, who returned to the state
hours after Lt. Gov. Mike Curb ordered the
change, promptly issued a statement saying he
would rescind the action.
As Brown flew back to California, he issued a
terse statement through his press secretary, Bob
bie Metzger.
"Earlier today, before Curb took his action, Gray
Davis, the governor's chief of staff, advised Curb's
top aide, Shel Lytton, that if the order were signed,
it would be rescinded," Metzger said.
Curb said his order would make it easier for
refineries to make leaded gasoline and would in
crease gasoline production by as much as one
million gallons a day, a 3 percent increase.
Brown, however, is counting on other measures
to improve the situation —at least a little — before
then. He ordered larger stations to stay open on
either Saturday or Sunday starting this weekend, a
move designed to shorten the weekday lines of
motorists forced to go gasless all weekend.
House passes Alaska land bill
Washington — The House yesterday passed the
conservationist-backed Alaska land bill, setting
aside more than 100 million acres for wildlife re
fuges and wilderness.
House passage came on a 360-55 vote shortly
after members had thrown out a rival measure
backed by industry.
The bill now goes to the Senate. A similar mea
sure, which would have set aside about one-third
of Alaska for national parks, wilderness areas and
refuges, died in the Senate last year.
House approval of the bill,' sponsored by Rep.
Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), marked a significant victory
for President Jimmy Carterand fora wide coalition
of environmental groups. Carter had called the
measure his top environmental priority.
The measure sets aside 110 million acres of
Alaska land for national parks, preserves, wild
river areas and wilderness. It would roughly dou
ble the size of the national park system.
Soviets improve Saudi relations
Moscow — The Soviet Union will make every
effort to exploit the rift in delicate relations bet
ween Saudi Arabia and the United States, Western
analysts here say.
According to diplomatic sources, the Soviets —
who have no diplomatic relations with Saudi
Arabia — have been in contact with the Saudis
recently through third parties, said to be Morocco
and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Moscow diplomats see little chance of full-scale
Saudi-Soviet ties at least until 1981. But lesser links
could be initiated.
Direct contacts reportedly have been made by
the two nations in European capitals, but the exact
nature of these contacts is not known.
Middle East rumors that Soviet-Saudi relations
might be resumed seemed more substantial re
cently following strong Saudi opposition to the

Egyptian-Israeli peace pact and controversial U.S.
intelligence reports describing a supposed split
inside the Arabian kingdom's ruling family.
Harvard upgrades curriculum
Cambridge, Mass. — Harvard's first major over
haul of its undergraduate curriculum in 34 years —
requiring graduates to prove they can write, do
math and read a foreign language — was greeted
enthusiastically yesterday by the nation's top edu
cation official.
The core curriculum unveiled also abolishes re
quired general survey courses in favor of highly
focused subjects that stress the process of think
ing. Instead of taking such courses as "Survey of
American History," next fall's Harvard freshmen
will fulfill their history requirements by picking
from"The Christianization of the Roman World,"
"The Emancipation of the Jews" and"The Darwi
nian Revolution."
U.S. Commissioner of Education Ernest Boyer
said in Washington that he had long held the posi
tion that there is a certain "core" of knowledge
that should be part of an undergraduate educa
tion.
The change is likely to be imitated by planners at
other colleges.
Several other big universities, such as the Uni
versity of Chicago, the University of Missouri and
Northwestern, have already set up new core prog
rams.
State finds pesticide in wells
Sacramento — California officials, in a major
finding that could deal a nationwide blow to the
controversial pesticide DBCP, yesterday an
nounced discovery of traces of DBCP in 36
groundwater wells.
Aspokesman forthe U.S. Environmental Protec
tion Agency said the finding "could change EPA's
attitude" as it holds hearings on a possible
nationwide ban on the pesticide, now banned
only in California.
A total ban would have a dramatic effect on the
nation's growers, who rely almost exclusively on
DBCP, linked by studies to cancer and infertility,
to kill small worms that attack tree and vine crops.
Agriculture representatives, prior to this find
ing, had been pushing for the ban's lifting in
California, arguing crops such as grapes and citrus
would suffer millions of dollars in damage without
DBCP spraying.
The state Department of Food and Agriculture
announcement came after traces of the pesticide
were found in the agriculturally rich San Joaquin
Valley.
Before the state ban was imposed in August
1977, state agriculture officials estimated about 1.5
