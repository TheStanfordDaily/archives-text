# Athletic Department management changes
## 
### Katie Smith 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger has
formulated a plan to reorganize the
management divisions of the Athletic
Dept.
He explained that it would be "im
possible to summarize" a scheme
which has been in the process for
four months, but did specify that the
change entailed a reshuffling of
duties among management person
nel, an expansion of public relations
and the addition of new staff mem
bers. The new staff will work on fund
raising and the generation of in
creased income for athletics.
Geiger could not forecast figures
for increases since the changes have
yet to take effect. But he maintained
that an increase would be apparent.
Healso said, "We want a change of
emphasis in our program and have
made an effort to improve and in
crease creativity."
The five managerial divisions of
the department have remained es
sentially the same though there have
been changes in duties and the ap
pointment of new administrators.
Doug Single is now in charge of "The
Development of Intercollegiate Ath
letics," a position Geiger said in-

volves fund raising, recruiting,
alumni relations and acting as an ad
missions liaison.
Gary Cavalli is heading up Athletic
Public Affairs, and will be responsi
ble for sports information, publica
tions, marketing and promotion. He
will also run the ticket office. The
remaining divisions, Geiger said, are
"Business and Finance" under the
direction of Don Tobin, Services
Operations under Ray Young and
Educational Program, headed by Pam
Strathairn. This last division is re
sponsible for programming of physi
cal education classes and intramural
sports.
Geiger added that he had also de
veloped a new Assistant Athletic Di
rector position to which Jim Goren
has been appointed. Goren will work
in many of the management areas
paying special attention to the club
sports program.
According to Geiger, with the en
largement of the administrative sec
tor come additional salaries and cost
to the University. Geiger said he
feels, though, that this cost will be
more than compensated for by in
creased income for the department
through fund raising.
