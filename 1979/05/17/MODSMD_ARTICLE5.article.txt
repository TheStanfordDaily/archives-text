# Senior to open cookie kitchen
## 
### Jenny Smith 
Some seniors here graduate and go to medical school
or law school or business school. Others get a job or
travel for awhile. Marcia Hadeler, a senior communica
tion major, has something a little different in the oven.
After two years of planning and experimenting,
Hadeler's dream will become a reality Saturday at the
grand opening ceremony of her cookie shop, The
Cookie Kitchen.
Hadeler says she has wanted to open her own cookie
store since she was 12 years old. "Then in my
sophomore year at Stanford," she said, "I ran across a
small cookie bakery in Los Angeles that was very suc
cessful. I found out that the owners were young people
who wanted to start their own business. That made me
realize that if they could do it, I could, too."
Because of a few last minute delays, The Cookie
Kitchen will not be open for business until early next
week. However, Sesame Street's Cookie Monster will
cut the ribbon at Saturday's opening ceremony at 1 p.m.
Hadeler approached her sister, Marlowe Savelle, and
a friend, Sonya Sheffield, both Menlo Park housewives
in their 30s, with the idea. The three decided to go into
business together.
The initial proposal went to the Stanford Shopping
Center in October 1977. On May 12, 1978 The Cookie

Kitchen won final approval over Mrs. Field's Cookies for
space in the shopping center.
For the last two years Hadeler has been experimenting
with different cookie recipes for The Cookie Kitchen.
Her junior-year roommate Jan Russo said, "I don't think
I can remember a time when the oven wasn't full of
cookies or the freezer wasn't full of cookie dough."
Hadeler tested her recipes on new friends for criti
cisms. "We made a lot of friends that year," Russo said.
Hadeler said her best recipe is for an oatmeal
butterscotch-chocolate-chip- walnut, part of which she
attributes to a friend's grandmother. Other cookies in
clude chocolate chip, oatmeal-raisin-spice and choco
late brownies.
Hadeler says she doesn't know how long she wants to
be in the cookie business. If it goes well, Savelle said,
they will open other stores in the area.
In addition to cookies and brownies, milk, coffee, tea
and soft drinks will also be sold.
A "Cookie-of-the-Month" contest will be held to sol
icit recipes from the community. The best recipe will be
sold for a week. The winning baker will have his or her
picture hung on the wall and will receive a dozen
cookies of any kind.
For the first week, Stanford students will be able to
buy three cookies for the price of two.
