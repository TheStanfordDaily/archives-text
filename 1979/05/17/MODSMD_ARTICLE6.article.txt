# Profs 'boycott' Soviet research conference
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Protesting confinement of Soviet political
dissidents in psychiatric hospitals, two re
nowned scholars here and another from Har
vard have withdrawn from the 11th World Con
gress of the International Political Science As
sociation (IPSA) scheduled for late August in
Moscow.
Prof. Gabriel Almond and Prof. Alex Inkeles,
both of Stanford along with Prof. Sid Verba of
Harvard have decided not to attend the confer
ence. In addition, they have suggested that
those who attend the conference anyway
should "take appropriate steps" to show their
repugnance for Soviet abuses.
The scholars' decision was announced in an
April letter to 100 of their professional col
leagues and to Prof. Richard Merritt of the Uni
versity of Illinois, chairman of the IPSA Program
Committee.
"The Soviets are very concerned with
worldwide public opinion, particularly in the
light of the 1980 Olympics coming up. We feel
like we can be a lobby and perhaps improve the
conditions of the people. Their political misuse
of psychiatry is particularly repugnant to us,"
Almond, a professor emeritus of political sci
ence, said.
Dissidents confined
The Soviet government confines some politi
cal dissidents and labels them as victims of vari
ous psychological diseases. The government
then injects large doses of mind-altering drugs
into the dissidents, Inkeles said.

Almond and Inkeles said their decision to
boycott the conference gave them "a feeling of
good conscience. There are some people who
think that even if some Soviet activities are rep
rehensible, on balance, the exchange ought to
continue anyway. We just don't feel that way,"
Inkeles, sociology professor and senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, said.
Specifically, the Stanford and Harvard scho
lars have cited five cases as typical treatment of
Russian dissidents:
— Seymon Guzman, a psychiatrist, was sen
tenced to seven years imprisonment for pos
session of unofficial publications. He was the
first psychiatrist to expose the use of psychiatric
hospitals for the confinement of political dissi
dents.
— Anatoly Barabanov, a psychiatrist, was
confined to a maximum security psychiatric
hospital because of his sympathetic attitudes
toward inmates at a psychiatric center exten
sively used for political detention.
— Mykola Plakhotnyuk, a medical doctor,
was confined indefinitely to psychiatric hospi
tals for "anti-Soviet propaganda and agitation."
— Boris Evdokimov was confined in a special
psychiatric hospital after arrest for his unofficial
publications critical of government practices.
— Vladimir Klebanov and other members of
the unofficial association of free trade unions
were confined to psychiatric hospitals after
lodging formal complaints against their
superiors.
"The most fundamental question that is at

stake here is whether we should participate in
events in what are, in effect, pariah countries,
countries to which we will not go as profession
als because we feel basic human rights are
being violated. That is the case in Russia as we
see it," Inkeles said.
A movement among members of the Ameri
can Political Science Association (APSA), a "sub
organization" of IPSA to protest Soviet injus
tices, began at last August's annual APSA meet
ing.
At that meeting, Inkeles presented a resolu
tion to members of APSA, asking them to
boycott the upcoming Soviet conference.
Members vetoed the original proposal, but
passed an amended version. That amended re
solution stated that if the U.S.S.R. denied visas
to scholars interested in attending the Con
gress, members of APSA would not participate
officially in the conference, Merritt said.
In order to participate "officially," each na
tional political science organization must ap
point three of its members to serve on the IPSA
Governing Council. By removing its members,
the American organization would, in effect, not
be an official participant in the conference.
Symbolic
"It was a very symbolic move that had it been
necessary, would have allowed us to protest
Soviet moves, but also would have allowed the
meeting to continue," Merritt said.
"However, it was also made clear that those
individuals who, as a matter of conscience

could not attend the Congress. . .should" feel
tree not to attend, Almond added.
Since that time, Inkeles, Almond and Harvard
colleague Verba decided not to attend the
triennial international meeting, which will be
attended by 700 international scholars includ
ing approximately 225 North American political
scientists.
Despite the scholars' symbolic move not to
attend the conference, none of their American
colleagues has followed suit, Merritt said. He
said he believes that scholars who disagree with
Soviet policies should attend the conference
anyway to express such disillusionment.
"Of course, they have to answer to their own
consciences. My own view is very different, but
I am not commending and I am not condoning.
I may be idealistic, but I believe well-known
scientists should talk openly," he said.
"It would be better for all if these people
(Almond, Inkeles and Verba) were in Moscow
to express their views. They are leading scho
lars who would be respected. Now, it will be
hard for their views to be heard," he added.
Almond and Inkeles disagreed. "If there
were strong inducements to go, I would. For
example, if I were involved in a research project
with a Soviet scientist, it would be important for
me to go. But my research does not relate di
rectly to Soviet concerns; there is no reason for
me to go when I find Soviet use of psychiatric
confinement to be repugnant," Almond said.
