# Japan wildlife treaty not ratified
## 
### 
Tokyo (AP) — Six years after
Japan signed a treaty protect
ing endangered wildlife, ef
torts to get the treaty ratified
have hit another snag.
The Japanese Foreign Minis
try says it has temporarily
dropped plans to submit the
measure — aimed at cutting
down on the flourishing trade
here in rare and protected
animals — to the Diet, Japan's
parliament.
A spokesman said "it ap
pears to be impossible to get it
ratified" this session because
of opposition from animal
traders, importers, furriers and
other businesses, and because
of the Diet's calendar.
Although the Foreign Minis
try, the Ministry of Interna
tional Trade and Industry and
the Environmental Agency all
support the treaty, it has had a
low priority in the Diet since it
was signed in April 1973.
The Foreign Ministry said the

"Convention on International
Trade and Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora," bet
ter known as the Washington
Convention, would be sent to
the Diet next session.
No stats
There are almost no statistics
available on the extent of the
trade in live rare animals, their
furs and skins, and other pro
ducts such as ivory, in Japan or
through Japanese companies.
However, the World Wildlife
Fund of Japan claims at least 20
major Japanese trading houses
are deeply involved, and the
International Union for Con
servation of Nature and
Natural Resources, in Switzer
land, cites Japan as one of the
most "prolific traders in
wildlife."
Japan is the largest buyer of
furs from Hong Kong, where
there is a large illegal fur trade
which authorities are trying to
control. Imports include

leopard, civet, lynx and cape
seal furs — all banned under
the Washington Convention. A
leopard jacket sells on Tokyo's
Ginza for $2500 to $3000, a civet
jacket for slightly more.
Conservationists also comp
lain that many Japanese zoos —
mostly smaller ones — have
been illegally importing live
endangered animals, and last
year a scandal erupted over the
Iseshima Zoological Garden in
Kobe, which requested that an
Indonesian zoo smuggle birds
of paradise to it. The Indone
sian zoo director labeled the
request "monstrous" and dis
tributed photocopies of the
letter to zoo officials and con
servation groups around the
world.
Cover name
The controversy led to the
discovery that "Iseshima
Zoological Garden" was a
cover name for an animal

trader.
According to the World
Wildlife Fund, more than 600
birds covered by the
Washington Convention have
been legally imported into
Japan in the past five years, in
cluding more than 400 pereg
rine falcons, 63 golden eagles,
and from two to 60 of various
other species. Many others
were brought in illegally, the
fund claims, because of lack of
knowledge on the part of cus
toms men.
Other trade banned under
the convention includes that in
alligator, crocodile and reptile
skins, turtle shells and ivory —
about $26 million worth a year
of ivory. Other figures were
not available.
Sixty-six countries have
signed the convention, but
only about 50 have ratified it.
Japan is the only major de
veloped nation that has not.
