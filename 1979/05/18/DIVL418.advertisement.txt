( "SPLENDID LUNACY!
AN ELEGANT, COMIC FILM
by Rainer Fassbinder.
Dirk Bogarde gives one of the wittiest
performances of his entire career.
The Stoppard script is a joy.
FASSBINDER SUCCEEDS BRILLIANTLY!"
- Vincent Canby/N Y TIMES
"DAZZLING! Bogarde is SUPERB."
—Jack Kroll/NEWSWEEK
"A WEIRDLY FUNNY PSYCHOLOGICAL
THRILLER. Bogarde's performance sets
a best actor standard hard to beat.
Andrea Ferreol is wonderfully comic.
FASSBINDER IS AT HIS MOST CREATIVE."
—William Woll/CUE
"Dirk Bogarde is devilishly insinuating.
A WILDLY ENTERTAINING FILM!"

THEY ARE MORE THAN THE SUPER RICH.
THEYARE AN AMERICAN DYNASTY.
They own oil. banks...beautiful women., even presidents.
They have the power to make fortunes and destroy careers.
One man will inherit it all. If he lives.
