# Prize winning journalist declares
## Press restraints self-imposed 
### Brad Crystal 
The greatest limitations to a free press in this country
are not imposed by the government but actually stem
from news organizations themselves, David Halberstam
said at Kresge Auditorium last night.
Delivering the 1979 Carlos McClatchy memorial lec
ture, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author
told the mostly over-30 audience of 150 that the first
amendment is "the most precious thing we have." He
added, however, that freedom of the press is also an
"obligation" which many print and television news
managers do not fulfill.
Halberstam, whose recently published book The
Powers That Be chronicles the recent history of The Los
Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Time Inc. and
CBS, said American journalism has become big busi
ness. He warned that today's editors must be increas
ingly aware of conflicts of interest between journalistic
ethics and corporate profits.
"In 10 or 15 years the sense of corporate profits will
hover over every newsroom decision," Halberstam pre
dicted. "It will be a struggle with accountants."
Halberstam noted that the TV networks and most
major newspaper organizations are among Fortune
magazine's top 500 businesses.
Halberstam also expressed alarm about Washington
reporters losing their sense of public responsibility.
"The journalist's covenant is with the reader and not
with the source," he said, suggesting that Washington
reporters should avoid getting to know sources on a first
name basis or dining with them at fancy restaurants.
"You get information in indirect proportion to the
sexiness and attractiveness of the location ot where you
meet your source," he explained.

Legwork is the key to good reporting, Halberstam
said. Merely reporting official policy derived fron press
conferences ("five o'clock follies") is insufficient.
Halberstam also criticized the television networks for
limiting nightly news coverage to "23 minutes."
He said complicated issues such as SALT and South
Africa can not be explained thoroughly in a 2Vi minute
network news report.
While stressing news organizations' responsibility to
the public, Halberstam said "a newspaper can not be
better than the community it serves." San Francisco is an
exception in that "it is obviously sophisticated but gets
newspapers it does not always deserve."
On the other hand, Halberstam said the "rise of
People Magazinism in the post-Watergate era" reflects a
public "less willing to be involved in public affairs."
Earlier in the day Halberstam told a group of 30 jour
nalism fellows at Redwood Hall that "a great editor must
balance what people want to hear and what they need to
know."
Halberstam said he believes news organizations
should be more open to admitting flaws. He proposed
that during crises such as the Three Mile Island accident
newspapers devote part of their front pages to letters to
the editor.
Halberstam said the public perceives large institu
tional newspapers like the Washington Post and the
"culturally imperialistic New York Times" as "monoliths
within, largely unchallenged."
Concerning recent Supreme Court decisions limiting
First Amendment rights, Halberstam said he is "very
nervous." He said he is particularly "bothered" by the
Stanford Daily decision that gives police the right to
rummage through newsroom files.
