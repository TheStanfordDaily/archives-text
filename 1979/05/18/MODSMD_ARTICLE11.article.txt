## Alter society to stop nukes 
### 
As of July 1,1976 the United States admitted to
having 2124 strategic nuclear delivery systems:
1054 land-based intercontinental ballistic mis
siles, 656 submarine-launched ballistic missiles
and 414 strategic bombers. These systems can
deliver about 8500 independently targetable
nuclear warheads. The Soviet Union had 2404
strategic nuclear delivery systems as of the same
date. They can deliver over 4000 independently
targetable nuclear warheads.
These are only the big weapons systems. The
United States and the Soviet Union also have
tens of thousands of tactical nuclear weapons,
most of which are more powerful than the
atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Can anyone even begin to comprehend the
effects of one such weapon? Can anyone im
agine tens of thousands of people dying; pul
verized, burnt to death instantly, acute radiation
poisoning with massive hemorrhaging, the
slower deaths from leukemia and solid tumors? I
cannot.
And yet, logically, coldly, it seems that such an
event is not only inevitable but, difficult as it is to
imagine, it will only be part of an incredible
holocaust that will destroy, at a minimum, all
urban centers in the northern hemisphere and
hundreds of millions of humans.
At its maximum it will end life on earth. It is so
horrible that it is impossible to believe. I don't
believe it. I protest now and again, but then go
play soccer, read my radical books, cook dinner
and party with my friends.
Incomprehensible
If I could really believe nuclear war was a
probability I would put much more energy into
trying to avert it. But so much death is beyond
my understanding. I can picture it like an
episode on Star Trek where a whole planet is
offed: "Such a waste, Mr. Spock." "Yes, Cap
tain, it was a beautiful planet."
But I cannot imagine a war, where the death of
everyone I ever knew would be a miniscule part
of the total carnage.
In 33 years we have gone from two nuclear
weapons to tensof thousands, from one nuclear
power to seven (with scores more potential),
from a policy of Mutually Assured Destruction
(MAD) to one of limited nuclear war. Since 1900,
world military expenditures have increased 3000
percent in constant dollars.
The United States has played a leading role in

this escalation. We build many of the world's
weapons and send or sell them to every corner
of the globe. We have developed almost all the
new nuclear weapons. Wecontinuetobuildand
sell these instruments, whose only function is to
kill human beings at an incredible rate.
The reason is not national security. The
greatest threats to my life, liberty and pursuit of
happiness come from my own government —
these weapons-makers themselves. Our pre
sent society is a hierarchy of multinationals,
government bureaucracy, military men,
weapons designers, realpolitik academics, all
sitting astride a slobbering, confused consumer
culture with a two-dimensionality that accen
tuates its shrillness.
Unless this changes, we are all doomed (such
an apt medieval expression). There must be a
complete change of our society or the mutant
will inherit the earth — what's left of it.
Unoptimistic
There was yet another demonstration this
week in San Francisco against the University of
California Regents who administer the Liver
more and Los Alamos weapons labs.
I don't feel particularly optimistic. A few
thousand people against a multibillion dollar
"industry": the scientists, the academics, the
officials — all those two-piece suits, all those
cars, the guns, the money, the aftershave
scented self-assurance. My optimism will re
turn irrational perhaps, but it helps me act.
Livermore is a nasty place. They thought up
the neutron bomb there, and then tried to sell it
to Congress. They're proud that they can make
nuclear warheads that fit into six inch artillery
shells. "Now," they happily tell us, "nuclear war
is no longer unthinkable."
Marv Custavson, associate director for milit
ary systems, chortles, "When you realize the
wealth of developments that are possible in the
nuclear arena, it is hard to foresee an end to our
work." Not to put down Custavson, but I can
see an end to his work and it isn't pretty.
If society remains unchanged, nuclear war is
inevitable. The reaper is already among us —
crouched in a thousand silos, riding in a
hundred submarines, flying in strategic bom
bers 24 hours a day. He waits.
