End fluoridation
I am writing about compul
sory artificial fluoridation of
water at the University since
1970. I heard that some time in
the fall of 1976 something mal
functioned in the fluoride
dispensing equipment and that
water consumers received a
higher dosage of sodium
fluoride than they were sup
posed to.
News of this sort does not
receive much coverage be
cause artificial fluoridation is
supposed to be "perfectly
safe." Something similar hap
pened in Marin County in late
1977, according to the National
Fluoridation News, April-|une,
1978. However, these two are
not the only problems in the
history of fluoridation.
In the information that our
family receives from Stanford, I
have noticed that the students
there are eager and willing to
protest all kinds of injustices.
What bothers me is that I have
not noticed any opposition to
mandatory artificial fluorida
tion, the issue that, along with
nuclear power, should con
cern you more than any other
because it affects the most pre
cious natural resource, your
own health.
Ten years ago, when he was
chairman of the Department of
Biological Sciences here,
Donald Kennedy advocated a
"serious reappraisal of the
wisdom of mass fluoridation."
One does not have to be a
scientist to oppose fluorida
tion, though. There is no sub
stance, natural or' artificial, to
which someone somewhere is
not sensitive. To insist that
sodium fluoride, one of the
most toxic substances known
to man, is "perfectly safe" for

everybody, young or old, in
good health or poor, is an in
sult to one's intelligence.
There is plenty of scientific
proof now to link fluoridation
to many health problems. That
the proponents choose to ig
nore these studies does not
mean that they do not exist.
Those without any scientific
background and no common
sense can oppose fluoridation
as medical dictatorship. Each
individual should have the
freedom to choose what he or
she ingests in the way of food
and drink. Nobody has the
right to decide what should go
into somebody else's body.
Compulsory artificial fluorida
tion violates this principle.
Stanford has some of the
best minds in the world. They
should protest against this cor
ruption of science, this insult
to their intelligence, this viola
tion of health freedoms and
this danger to their present and
future health. News media
spreading the truth can help a
lot in putting an end to this
shameful chapter in American
history.
Inform yourselves, arm
yourselves and fight for what is
right!

Afford it
I am a volunteer for the
Senior Pledge Program. Of all
the reasons I have listened to
for not making a contribution,
the one I find to be the most
intriguing is, "I can't afford it."
Whether or not you are on
financial aid, about half of the
cost of your education is paid
tor with contributions to the
University. A considerable
amount of this money comes
trom young alumni (as you

soon will be) who shouldn't be
able to "afford it " but give
anyway.
The reason they do is be
cause they want to be able to
"afford it." For them it's a
question of priorities. They
know that they are just as able
to donate now as at any other
time in their lives.
Having worked in the De
velopment Office, I know that
some people will never be able
to contribute to Stanford. The
excuses cover an individual's
lifetime, and are many. Some
people think that someone
else is always in a better posi
tion to contribute than they.
Fortunately, there are those
who realize that now is just as
good a time to give as any. They
know how much the University
has done for them, and want to
give something in return.
Think about all of the growing
you have done here. You
wouldn't hang around if it
wasn't worth your while.
Can you really afford not to
give now?

Editor's note: While not arguing
with the view that people
should contribute to the Uni
versity, readers should note
that, while tuition does repre
sent only 50 percent of a year's
operating budget, gifts do not
make up the other half, as
stated above. In fact there are
many other income sources for
the University, and gifts are ex
pected to provide only 6.4 per
cent of income in next year's
operating budget.
More Gay Weeks
I am writing in regard to a
letter written by Bo Reahard in

which he calls upon divine as
sistance to insure that Cay
Awareness Week 1979 will be
the last ot its kind (Daily, May
15). On the contrary, it is the
type of misconceptions voiced
in Reahard's letter that will in
sure the existence of future
Gay Awareness Weeks.
Perhaps if he had attended
the talk given by Father
Michael Cuinan of the Ber
keley Franciscan School of
Theology during the week, he
would have had the opportun
ity to understand the expanded
Christian view which acknow
ledges and considers the cul
tural time-dependent context
in which the Bible was written.
Almost comically, Reahard
has done to Masters and
lohnson what many fun
damentalists have done to the
Bible for centuries. That is to
quote out of context in order to
justify their own indefensible
positions.
While it is true that Masters
and Johnson theorize that
homosexuality is learned be
havior, he fails to mention that
the learned behavior theory
includes heterosexuality as
well.
In recent years, gay people
have increasingly come to a
realization of innocence. I
speak of an innocence from
the guilt of sickness, sin and
moral depravity which society
has long heaped upon us.
We are no longer settling for
tolerance conditional upon
our remaining in the closet.
Rather, we are asserting our
human equality. -Unlike
Reahard, I pray this will not be
the last Gay Awareness Week
held on the Stanford campus.
