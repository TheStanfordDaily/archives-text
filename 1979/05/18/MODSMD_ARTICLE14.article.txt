## Alka Joshi CPPC does help liberal arts majors 
### 
In the following article I wish to direct
myself towards those students who have
never been to the Career Planning and
Placement Office or who have had little
contact with its services. I would like to
answer specifically the three major
points brought out in Mark Coggins' arti
cle (Daily, May 14): the number of on
campus recruiters offering jobs to liberal
arts candidates, the intensity of a liberal
arts interview as compared to a technical
one, and the quality of the counseling ser
vices.
What Coggins referred to as "facts"
generally lacked enough information to
make sound arguments against the Liberal
Arts section placement services.
The CPPC is continually trying to in
crease the number of companies offering
attractive jobs to liberal arts majors. The
125 companies that recruited liberal arts
graduates on campus this year represent a
sizable increase from the 73 firms that in
terviewed here two years ago.
While it is true that Bank of America is
one of the more popular companies re
cruiting on campus, so is any firm with the
word "bank" in its title. There were also
other companies besides insurance and
retailing firms which drew long waiting
lines: A.C. Becker, Louis Dryfuss, Morgan
Guarantee, Equitec Financial Croup.
These were all companies which offered
sales and management careers. It is a fact
that liberal arts students have shifted their
focus from social service careers to more
business-oriented careers within the last
few years.
More valued?
Taking into account this rising interest,
as well as the fact that MBAs salaries are
higher, companies have begun to value

liberal arts degrees more. We are also
striving to bring these companies on cam
pus.
Secondly, the larger companies aren't
the only ones interviewing liberal arts
candidates. Some of the smaller com
panies offer equally challenging jobs with
comparable salaries.
The majority of interviewees, however,
have not taken the time to investigate the
alternative opportunities available with
these companies. Furthermore, the CPPC
has an open-door policy regarding recruit
ing companies; any company may reserve
a room for interviewing.
Consequently, they are not always the
companies that are attractive for non
technical majors. Our concern is to pro
vide as many placement opportunities as
possible for all graduates.
Time allocation
Much of our time is spent gathering and
dispensing information to BA candidates
about career opportunities and job hunt
ing strategies rather than lining up com
panies for interviews. We extend this in
formation across campus via career
panels, employer contact sheets, a career
reference library, bag lunches with
employers, career planning workshops
and a newsletter, 9000 copies of which
were distributed throughout campus this
quarter.
Another activity provided by the CPPC
was the Job Faire to give students a chance
to interview employers about careers to
people available with BA degrees.
Finally, the CPPC is not the only place to
interview for jobs. Other sources you can
draw upon are weekly job listings, contact
sheets and your own imagination and ef
fort.

It is incorrect to say that the interviews
faced by liberal arts majors are more dif
ficult than those faced by technical majors,
primarily because different information
needs to be extracted from the inter
viewee.
Engineering majors, for example, must
answer technical questions on their exper
tise. Liberal arts majors, on the other
hand, rarely need to elaborate upon their
history or English courses; they are usually
asked to focus on their skills and past work
experience.
Naturally, due to the smaller number of
technical graduates and their relatively
high demand, employers are eager to hire
them. That just means that non-technical
graduates will have to try a little harder to
get a job.
Formalities foregone
When a liberal arts major graduating in
June comes to our center and wants to
know the quickest way possible to find a
job, we are forced to abandon all for
malities and begin directing them to all
possible sources for employment. A
search through the phone book might
very well be one of the recommended
sources of information.
For those students willing to take the
time to assess their strengths, their likes
and their opportunities in a career field,
our trained counseling staff in the liberal
arts department provides thorough and
excellent service.
Yes, there are flaws in our system. No,
we don't profess to be perfect. But neither
do we neglect our liberal arts majors.

one of the more popular companies re
cruiting on campus, so is any firm with the
word "bank" in its title. There were also
other companies besides insurance and
retailing firms which drew long waiting
lines: A.C. Becker, Louis Dryfuss, Morgan
Guarantee, Equitec Financial Croup.
These were all companies which offered
sales and management careers. It is a fact
that liberal arts students have shifted their
focus from social service careers to more
business-oriented careers within the last
few years.
More valued?
Taking into account this rising interest,
as well as the fact that MBAs salaries are
higher, companies have begun to value

liberal arts degrees more. We are also
striving to bring these companies on cam
pus.
Secondly, the larger companies aren't
the only ones interviewing liberal arts
candidates. Some of the smaller com
panies offer equally challenging jobs with
comparable salaries.
The majority of interviewees, however,
have not taken the time to investigate the
alternative opportunities available with
these companies. Furthermore, the CPPC
has an open-door policy regarding recruit
ing companies; any company may reserve
a room for interviewing.
Consequently, they are not always the
companies that are attractive for non
technical majors. Our concern is to pro
vide as many placement opportunities as
possible for all graduates.
Time allocation
Much of our time is spent gathering and
dispensing information to BA candidates
about career opportunities and job hunt
ing strategies rather than lining up com
panies for interviews. We extend this in
formation across campus via career
panels, employer contact sheets, a career
reference library, bag lunches with
employers, career planning workshops
and a newsletter, 9000 copies of which
were distributed throughout campus this
quarter.
Another activity provided by the CPPC
was the Job Faire to give students a chance
to interview employers about careers to
people available with BA degrees.
Finally, the CPPC is not the only place to
interview for jobs. Other sources you can
draw upon are weekly job listings, contact
sheets and your own imagination and ef
fort.

It is incorrect to say that the interviews
faced by liberal arts majors are more dif
ficult than those faced by technical majors,
primarily because different information
needs to be extracted from the inter
viewee.
Engineering majors, for example, must
answer technical questions on their exper
tise. Liberal arts majors, on the other
hand, rarely need to elaborate upon their
history or English courses; they are usually
asked to focus on their skills and past work
experience.
Naturally, due to the smaller number of
technical graduates and their relatively
high demand, employers are eager to hire
them. That just means that non-technical
graduates will have to try a little harder to
get a job.
Formalities foregone
When a liberal arts major graduating in
June comes to our center and wants to
know the quickest way possible to find a
job, we are forced to abandon all for
malities and begin directing them to all
possible sources for employment. A
search through the phone book might
very well be one of the recommended
sources of information.
For those students willing to take the
time to assess their strengths, their likes
and their opportunities in a career field,
our trained counseling staff in the liberal
arts department provides thorough and
excellent service.
Yes, there are flaws in our system. No,
we don't profess to be perfect. But neither
do we neglect our liberal arts majors.

In the following article I wish to direct
myself towards those students who have
never been to the Career Planning and
Placement Office or who have had little
contact with its services. I would like to
answer specifically the three major
points brought out in Mark Coggins' arti
cle (Daily, May 14): the number of on
campus recruiters offering jobs to liberal
arts candidates, the intensity of a liberal
arts interview as compared to a technical
one, and the quality of the counseling ser
vices.
What Coggins referred to as "facts"
generally lacked enough information to
make sound arguments against the Liberal
Arts section placement services.
The CPPC is continually trying to in
crease the number of companies offering
attractive jobs to liberal arts majors. The
125 companies that recruited liberal arts
graduates on campus this year represent a
sizable increase from the 73 firms that in
terviewed here two years ago.
While it is true that Bank of America is
one of the more popular companies re
cruiting on campus, so is any firm with the
word "bank" in its title. There were also
