## Push passive solar energy 
### 
Much of the present litera
ture and media coverage con
cerning alternative energy
sources concentrates on solar
systems, which use mechanical
devices such as solar collectors
and pumps, to provide heating
and cooling for buildings.
Passive solar design, in con
trast, usually has no mechani
cal systems, and instead uses
the building itself as a solar col
- lector through architectural
design.
Passive solar is neglected in
public information programs
and in the federal budget, even
though it's the least expensive
solar technology and the most
cost-effective way to reduce
energy bills. Because of the 55
percent California solar tax
credit, passive solar requires
little or no additional invest
ment compared to conven
tional forms of building and yet
can provide 60 to 100 percent
of a new building's heating and
cooling needs.
Adding simple passive solar
retrofittings like thermal
drapes and shutters, awnings,
double-pane glass and "ther
mal chimnevs" to existing
buildings and attaching
greenhouses to them, can pro
vide 20 to 50 percent of the
building's heating and cooling
needs.
The federal government's
present emphasis on active,
rather than passive solar sys
tems, is making solar energy
appear generally more expen
sive than it really is.
Recent projects
Two recent large-scale pas
sive solar design projects now
under construction in Califor
nia dramatically demonstrate
the economics and quick
payback of this solar invest
ment. A new 276,000 square
foot state office building in
Sacramento designed by the
state architect, Sim Van Der
Ryn, will use only one-fourth
the energy of a conventional
building of the same size and
yet is less expensive.
Use of skylights and atria in
the new building will reduce
lighting requirements by one
half. The building has a 1220-
ton rock bed cooling system
that will provide 75 percent of
the air-conditioning required
beyond that resulting from
night ventilation in the build
ing.
A computer will monitorand
adjust to various weather con
ditions and select the most
comfortable, efficient and
economic use of the building's
energy systems. The computer
will automatically control
exhaust fans, louvers and ex
terior shades. It will also pro
vide data on the hourly energy
consumption rates and the
overall operating efficiency of
the building's heating and
cooling systems.

A five-story passively heated
student library is being built
now at San Jose State Univer
sity that will provide 70 percent
of the heating energy required
for the building. It is estimated
that the natural energy system
for the library will pay back its
full cost in just 5Vi years.
The widespread use of pas
sive solar design features in
new and existing buildings
would be greatly facilitated by
the removal of public subsidies

conventional fuels or by pro
viding comparable public sub

Passive solar systems should
be made eligible for the new
federal solar tax credit, as
California has already done.
Solar technologies, especially
passive solar, should also be

conservation.
In all possible ways, passive
solar energy systems are the
wisest and most inexpensive
form of energy conservation.
Passive systems incorporate
extensive conservation meA-

sures and use much less
energy than conventional
buildings.
Lower taxes
A good way to promote the
use of passive solar design is to
reduce the property tax and as
sessment of passive structures.
Solar must be regarded as a
primary, if not the leading,
energy source, today and in
the future. Although the fed
eral government can help tre
mendously in bringing solar
energy and particularly passive

solar design into wider usage
in the United States, we can't
wait for the federal govern
ment to take the initiative.
The most important changes
will take place at the state, local
and individual levels and many
fine examples already exist.
What is needed most is for all
of us to take appropriate ac
tions in education, in the
media, in the marketplace, in
investment policy and in the
voting booth, to show support
for an increase in solar de
velopment.

little or no additional invest

Adding simple passive solar
retrofittings like thermal

double-pane glass and "ther

buildings and attaching
greenhouses to them, can pro
vide 20 to 50 percent of the

appear generally more expen

Recent projects
Two recent large-scale pas
sive solar design projects now
under construction in Califor
nia dramatically demonstrate
the economics and quick
payback of this solar invest
ment. A new 276,000 square
foot state office building in
Sacramento designed by the
state architect, Sim Van Der
Ryn, will use only one-fourth
the energy of a conventional
building of the same size and
yet is less expensive.
Use of skylights and atria in
the new building will reduce
lighting requirements by one
half. The building has a 1220-
ton rock bed cooling system
that will provide 75 percent of
the air-conditioning required
beyond that resulting from
night ventilation in the build
ing.
A computer will monitorand
adjust to various weather con
ditions and select the most
comfortable, efficient and
economic use of the building's
energy systems. The computer
will automatically control
exhaust fans, louvers and ex
terior shades. It will also pro
vide data on the hourly energy
consumption rates and the
overall operating efficiency of
the building's heating and
cooling systems.

A five-story passively heated
student library is being built
now at San Jose State Univer
sity that will provide 70 percent
of the heating energy required
for the building. It is estimated
that the natural energy system
for the library will pay back its
full cost in just 5Vi years.

be made eligible for the new

passive solar, should also be

use of passive solar design is to
reduce the property tax and as

energy source, today and in

Much of the present litera
ture and media coverage con
cerning alternative energy
sources concentrates on solar
systems, which use mechanical
devices such as solar collectors
and pumps, to provide heating
and cooling for buildings.
Passive solar design, in con
trast, usually has no mechani
cal systems, and instead uses
the building itself as a solar col
- lector through architectural
design.
Passive solar is neglected in
public information programs
and in the federal budget, even
though it's the least expensive
solar technology and the most
cost-effective way to reduce
energy bills. Because of the 55
percent California solar tax
credit, passive solar requires
little or no additional invest
ment compared to conven
tional forms of building and yet
can provide 60 to 100 percent
of a new building's heating and
cooling needs.
