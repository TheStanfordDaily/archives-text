# Underwater violinist
## Grad student makes TV appearance 
### Sheryl Davis 
Mark Gottlieb is a different
kind of musician. He's also
about as unassuming as a com
fortable pair of shoes. And
that's a little surprising for a
guy who's adding another na
tional television appearance
Sunday night to an already
impressive array of ac
complishments.
Gottlieb, a graduate student
here, is appearing on ABC's
nationwide showing of Guin
ness Spectacular at 8 p.m.
Sunday. He's on the show for
about five minutes, playing the
aqualin, an underwater violin
he invented.
A filming crew from a
)apanese television network is
also interested in Gottlieb's act
and wiil be on campus May 27
to film him playing underwater
in deGuerre Pool.
Gottlieb is very willing to talk
about his television appear
ances but is less willing to dis
cuss other aspects of his life.
He said people sometimes get
uncomfortable around him
when they hear what he has
done.
That's not suprising—he's fit
more into his 22 years than
many people will fit into an en
tire lifetime.
An engineering student
here, Gottlieb is also a photo
grapher, inventor, entrep
reneur and accomplished
musician.
He plays Indian court drums
called table drums—in fact, he
plays them so well, he is consi
dered by some musical experts
to be the best non-Indian
player in the world.
Playing the drums was a skill
he picked up when he lived in
India with his family for two
years, on two different occa
sions. He took up the drums
when he was 10 and was giving
lessons when he was 13.
His father is a music profes
sor at Evergreen State College,
and music has been a big part
of Gottlieb's life. He learned to
play the piano when he was
three and by seven, was play
ing the violin.
ButGottlieb is more than just
a talented musician; he's an
underwater buff, too, and it's
his interest in water that pro
vided him with a place since
1976 in the Cuinness Book of
World Records.
He explained that he didn't
like to practice the violin but he
did like to spend time in the
water as a scuba diver. So, put
ting his inventor's mind to
work, he created an underwa
ter violin when he was 16—
effectively combining the two.
After he came up with the
aqualin some friends
suggested he should try to get
himself into the Guinness book.
He did; the editors accepted
him and they placed him in the
book under the heading "Un
derwater Violinist."

The editor of the records
book, Norris McWhirter said
about Gottlieb: "We get lots of
requests for absurd 'records,'
but his was so unique that we
found it irresistable and gave
him an entry."
Gottlieb's initial communi
cation with the Guinness people
has been the only time he has
solicited attention for his
aqualin invention. Since then,
the people have come to
him—and they've come in re
spectable numbers.
Besides the Guinness book,
Gottlieb has also been written
up in the book Record Break
ers, and has been featured in
Newsweek, National Lampoon
and newspapers worldwide.
But it's with television that
Gottlieb really shines. In 1974,
he appeared on the British
Broadcasting Corporation's
"Record Breakers," which was
filmed in Bermuda.
His first U.S. television ap
pearance came in 1975 when
he appeared in "The David
Frost Presents the Guinness
Book of World Records."
And this year it looks like
he'll have two TV
appearances—one in the Un
ited States and one in Japan.
Guinness Spectacular Sun
day night will feature a duet
played by Gottlieb on the
aqualin and his sister, Karen,
on the underwater organ
hydrogran—another of his in
ventions.

Their sheet music is all
waterproofed, but their reper
toire is small—Handel's "Wa
ter Music," Strauss' "Blue
Danube" and Bacharach's
"Raindrops Keep Falling On
My Head."
Gottlieb said he invented the
underwater organ because he
didn't want to perform by him
self.
"I don't play the violin very
well and I thought if I could
have my sister in my act, it
would go better. And now we
can play duets," he said.
Although the idea of under
water musical instruments
might seem unusual to some
people, it seems perfectly
natural to him. In fact,
Gottlieb, who has several in
terests that keep him under
water, said that some people
have accused him of having
"water on the brain."
In addition to playing his
aqualin and hydrogran,
Gottlieb likes to scuba dive,,
and diving up and down the
West Coast, in Bermuda, in the
Bahamas and in the Red Sea.
And he isn't just swimming
around down there. He is an
avid underwater photographer
and is also currently working
on two diving-related inven
tions which he said he believes
are marketable.
Gottlieb is an engineer and
inventor at heart and most of
his various projects and ac
complishments have some
thing to do with inventing.

When he was attending
Evergreen State College in
Olympia, Wash., working on
his bachelor's degree, he de
signed and built a solar collec
tion system for his parents'
house that provides them with
a six-month's supply of hot wa
ter.
He was also one of three
partners who owned a compu
ter graphics firm in Seattle.
They sold the firm before he
came to Stanford.
But all is not engineering in
Gottlieb's life.
"My favorite hobby is lock
picking. I do it just for fun—it's
a challenging sport," Gottlieb
said.
Gottlieb's skill comes in
handy when people in his
dorm, Crothers Memorial, get
locked out of their rooms. On
occasion, he's even let the
house associate into her room.
Contrary to the stereotype of
the mad inventor who's a re
cluse and exhibits socially
deviant behavior, Gottlieb's
friends say he's a well-adjusted
person.
Inventions, television
shows, lock-picking. It's a busy
life, Gottlieb said.
"That's a big problem—my
life is much too interesting.
I've got the television shows,
my 'schoolwork, and my
friends—which are very impor
tant to me. That doesn't leave
much time for anything else."

was his first television coverage; he's scheduled for more this month.
