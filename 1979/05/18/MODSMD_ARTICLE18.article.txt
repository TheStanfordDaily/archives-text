Dear Bug Me:
I noticed that during the last two campus
power outages the waterfall in front of Terman
Engineering kept on running. How does it do
thisf Surely it c,<n't be using fresh water.
-R.S.
That's recirculated, not fresh water you see
running through the fountains. According to
Larry Atwater, grounds superviser, the fountain
is hooked up to an emergency generator that is
automaticallyactivated. This generatoralso runs
sump pumps in the basement of surrounding
buildings that would start up if flooding occur
red from a rainstorm.

Dear Bug Me:
One of the most flagrant cases of energy waste
I've ever witnessed on this campus is all the
lights blazing away in the new Green library.

Why can't there be some other light system that
would be adequate to inhibit vandalism?
-A.I.
Roger Cairns, project manager in the Facilities
Office said the problem of excessive lighting has
been taken care of. If all goes normally now,
only area and exit lights will be left on each
night, enough to get out in case of an
emergency, he said.
Once the building is opened the lights will still
be turned off manually each night, although
several features have been built in that will save
energy. For example, the stack lighting won't be
turned on unless someone is actually using
them, and then a timer will automatically turn
them off.
