# Kennedy: no opinion yet on curriculum reforms
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Future Vice President and Provost Donald Kennedy
said yesterday his present concerns with reform of un
dergraduate education here do not center on specific
content but on a general interest in "what education
does to and for and with people, and how they express
that impact in choices about their own behavior."
Kennedy, current commissioner of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and a biology professor on
leave from the University, will assume his new position
here Aug. 1.
Specifically, Kennedy said he had no particular opin
ions on either the reform of undergraduate distribution
requirements of the proposed Western Culture re
quirement.
Speaking on K7SU's Campus Conference, Kennedy,
47, also said there was "explicit disavowal on all sides" of
any agreement that he should assume the presidency of
the University should a vacancy occur. He also denied
that his term as provost could be interpreted as an "ap
prenticeship" to the presidency.
"I honestly don't know. I don't deal very well with
hypothetical questions," said Kennedy about the possi
bility of serving as president here. "One's response

would depend so much on looking at the job from the
next-door office."
But Kennedy did say he found it "tremendously excit
ing to come back to Stanford," calling the University a
"remarkable institution." He would not estimate the
length of his term, but said he was "hopeful I'll have a
substantial period in the job."
Kennedy denied there was a connection between his
decision to leave the FDA and a new federal conflict-of
interest law which takes effect July 1, the day after he
officially leaves the FDA.
Kennedy explained that the law would have restricted
him from coming back to represent some institution,
such as the University, before the FDA on any particular
matter on which he had worked during his term as
commissioner. This was "something I wouldn't do any
way," he said.
Kennedy said he had "no specific dissatisfaction (and)
no general dissatisfaction" with his term as FDA com
missioner but he said, "I felt this was an important time
to return to Stanford.
"I would have preferred different timing in the best of
all possible worlds," said Kennedy, commenting that he
would have liked to stay to see through passage propos

als which the FDA has made to Congress to reform the
drug regulation process.
The changes in legislation would allow the FDA to
make a "more public process" of decisions on whether
to legalize prescription and over-the-counter drugs, as
opposed to "what amounts to a secret contract between
the government and drug companies" under present
laws, according to Kennedy.
He also said that though there is a "caution built into"
the drug legalization laws, the claim that the FDA was too
prone to prohibit many drugs was "much
exaggerated," such as in the laetrile controversy.
"We do have a need for new therapies on one hand,"
Kennedy asserted, but "a need to protect the public
from rapid introduction on the other."
Kennedy said that he would "stay out of anything
specific" concerning undergraduate education here
until he takes office. "When I jump into a debate . . .
before I'm really ready to, I almost always make an ass of
myself.
"But what I'm even more interested in is the kind of
analysis (Dean of Undergraduate Studies) Herant Katch
adouria.i has underway of what undergraduates expect,
get from, and then what they do with their education.

"I'm concerned with how you structure that experi
ence so that the exchange is most profitable, most mean
ingful and most powerful."
Kennedy said his experience in government had
helped him to "know a little more about how you do
things for other people and how you get them to do
things for you."
He also pointed out an interesting contrast between
the exercise of responsibility in the federal government
and in a large research university. In many ways, he said,
"you go from the most authoritarian (structure) to the
least authoritarian."
About the process which brought him back to the
University, Kennedy said he talked on the phone several
times with President Richard Lyman and visited the Uni
versity during winter quarter. He said Lyman's decision
was reported to and approved by the trustees.
There was a delay of nearly three weeks in public
announcement of the decision at the request of both
Kennedy and Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
)oseph Califano.
"I had some staff people to tell," Kennedy said. "Tel
ling people that you're going in this situation is not
easy."

Kennedy denied there was a connection between his
decision to leave the FDA and a new federal conflict-of
interest law which takes effect July 1, the day after he
officially leaves the FDA.
Kennedy explained that the law would have restricted
him from coming back to represent some institution,
such as the University, before the FDA on any particular
matter on which he had worked during his term as
commissioner. This was "something I wouldn't do any
way," he said.
Kennedy said he had "no specific dissatisfaction (and)
no general dissatisfaction" with his term as FDA com
missioner but he said, "I felt this was an important time
to return to Stanford.
"I would have preferred different timing in the best of
all possible worlds," said Kennedy, commenting that he
would have liked to stay to see through passage propos

als which the FDA has made to Congress to reform the
drug regulation process.
The changes in legislation would allow the FDA to
make a "more public process" of decisions on whether
to legalize prescription and over-the-counter drugs, as
opposed to "what amounts to a secret contract between
the government and drug companies" under present
laws, according to Kennedy.
He also said that though there is a "caution built into"
the drug legalization laws, the claim that the FDA was too
prone to prohibit many drugs was "much
exaggerated," such as in the laetrile controversy.
"We do have a need for new therapies on one hand,"
Kennedy asserted, but "a need to protect the public
from rapid introduction on the other."
Kennedy said that he would "stay out of anything
specific" concerning undergraduate education here
until he takes office. "When I jump into a debate . . .
before I'm really ready to, I almost always make an ass of
myself.
"But what I'm even more interested in is the kind of
analysis (Dean of Undergraduate Studies) Herant Katch
adouria.i has underway of what undergraduates expect,
get from, and then what they do with their education.

"I'm concerned with how you structure that experi
ence so that the exchange is most profitable, most mean
ingful and most powerful."
Kennedy said his experience in government had
helped him to "know a little more about how you do
things for other people and how you get them to do
things for you."
He also pointed out an interesting contrast between
the exercise of responsibility in the federal government
and in a large research university. In many ways, he said,
"you go from the most authoritarian (structure) to the
least authoritarian."
About the process which brought him back to the
University, Kennedy said he talked on the phone several
times with President Richard Lyman and visited the Uni
versity during winter quarter. He said Lyman's decision
was reported to and approved by the trustees.
There was a delay of nearly three weeks in public
announcement of the decision at the request of both
Kennedy and Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
)oseph Califano.
"I had some staff people to tell," Kennedy said. "Tel
ling people that you're going in this situation is not
easy."
Future Vice President and Provost Donald Kennedy
said yesterday his present concerns with reform of un
dergraduate education here do not center on specific
content but on a general interest in "what education
does to and for and with people, and how they express
that impact in choices about their own behavior."
Kennedy, current commissioner of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and a biology professor on
leave from the University, will assume his new position
here Aug. 1.
Specifically, Kennedy said he had no particular opin
ions on either the reform of undergraduate distribution
requirements of the proposed Western Culture re
quirement.
Speaking on K7SU's Campus Conference, Kennedy,
47, also said there was "explicit disavowal on all sides" of
any agreement that he should assume the presidency of
the University should a vacancy occur. He also denied
that his term as provost could be interpreted as an "ap
prenticeship" to the presidency.
"I honestly don't know. I don't deal very well with
hypothetical questions," said Kennedy about the possi
bility of serving as president here. "One's response

would depend so much on looking at the job from the
next-door office."
But Kennedy did say he found it "tremendously excit
ing to come back to Stanford," calling the University a
"remarkable institution." He would not estimate the
length of his term, but said he was "hopeful I'll have a
substantial period in the job."
