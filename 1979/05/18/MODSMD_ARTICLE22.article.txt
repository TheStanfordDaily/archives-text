# Americans idolize chaos, drugs, sex
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The "relig
ions" of America have become
a vast, miscellaneous swarm,
ranging from the historically
rooted faiths to the new and
strangely exotic ones.
Among the many peculiar
brands:
The "Discordian Society"
worshipping Eris, the goddess
of chaos, and dedicated to
anarchy; the "Psychedelic
Venus Church" idolizing drugs
and sex; the "Never Dies" who
maintain they are endlessly
reincarnated with their same
identities.
"I haven't verified whether
they've been able to pull that
one off," says the Rev. Dr. J.
Cordon Melton, a United
Methodist minister who is
probably the most widely and
directly informed expert on the
nation's modern religious pot
pourri.
"We've got all kinds," he
says. "A lot of them have been
hidden."
16 years research
He's spent the last 16years in
research, mingling with
witches' covens, combing oc
cult publications and ads,
checking out Satanists, Druids,
Flying-Saucer believers and
others around the country,
gathering facts about their
lifestyles, organizations and
ideas.
It's like "detective" work, he
notes in the foreword of his
two-volume, 1200-page The
Encyclopedia of American Re
ligions, published this spring
by McGrath Publishing Com
pany, Wilmington, N.C.
The compilation, the most
comprehensive, modern
summary yet amassed of re
ligious groups in this country,
their concepts and methods,
deals with 1203 of them, five

times more than the 223 listed
in standard directories.
Most since 1965
Of the total, he says more
than half, about 700 to 800 of
them, have been started since
1965, mostly in the early 19705,
with the rest being mainly in
the Protestant, Catholic, Or
thodox and Jewish traditions.
The regular bodies, as well as
the unfamiliar ones, are in
cluded. Of the little-known,
unconventional groups, he
said in an interview:
"A number of them are very
shallow, religiously off base
and don't offer members any
thing beyond friends to get to
gether with. Most of these will
die out.
"There's very definitely
some deception in some of
them, but it surprised me
there's not more of it since it's
such a lucrative field. So many
people are gullible and have
never worked through their
dependency problems."
Objective
However, Melton, 36, who
also is pastor of Evanston's
Emmanuel United Methodist
Church, takes a carefully ob
jective position in his descrip
tions of the various groups, av
oiding any personal evalua
tions or condemnations.
He said a "new push" of re
ligious proliferation charac
terized the early 19705. Such
periods occur cyclically about
every 25 years, he said, typi
cally accompanied by
economic pinch, high birth
rates and in the wake of social
stresses, such as the late 19605.
But the latest surge of re
ligiosity now has passed, he
said, and most of the new
groups stopped growing about
a year ago, with many of them
declining.
