# RESTAURANTS
## Unpretentious yet excellent French cuisine 
### 
La Tour
525 University Ave. at Cowper
Palo Alto
321-6954
Every day I ride by the Office
Center building on University
at Cowper and think how out
of place it looks in downtown
Palo Alto. On the third floor of
that building is a restaurant
whose only claim to being out
of place in Palo Alto is that it is
the best restaurant in the city.
Indeed, many claim that it is
the best restaurant on the
Peninsula. And they are prob
ably right.
La Tour is owned by a Viet
namese family headed by Chef
HuynhTrung Lap. Afteroperat
ing one of the finest French re
staurants in Viet Nam, Chef
Huynh and his family came to
San Francisco and opend La
Cabane. La Cabane played to
generally favorable reviews.
Recently, however, the family

moved to the Peninsula, and
their new restaurant, La Tour,
has received reviews along the
lines of "dining experience."
And the accolades are well
deserved. Once you get off the
elevator, you feel an atmos
phere of exclusivity. Happily
this exclusivity does not make
the service and food pretenti
ous. Service is formal yet
good-natured and not oppres
sive; attentive without fawn
ing.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well. Dishes
do not call attention to them
selvs as they do at other French
restaurants. Descriptions of
the dishes on the menu are
pared down to a minimum and
leave room for surprises when
the dish arrives.
These surprises, however,
are not always in the patron's
best interests. For example,
there is no mention of a puff

pastry covering on the
truffle soup. A customer order
ing the truffle soup followed by
one of the entrees en croute
may find his menu unba
lanced, with an excess of puff
pastry.
The menu contains a few
surprises, but by and large, its
offerings are relatively familiar.
Of the seven hors d'oeuvres,
Mousseline de Saint-Jacques
aux Pointes d'Asperges
(Mousee of scallops in lobster
sauce with asparagus — $6.50)
and Feuillete d'Huitre au Curry
(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) seemed the
most ambitious.
La Tour's representation of
Escargots de Bourgogne ($4.95)
is commendable for serving its
escargots on croutons, which
to my mind is superior to the
play-wi th-your-escargots-in
their-shells way. Palourdes au
Four (baked clams in herbs and

garlic butter — $3.95) were ex
cellent. In similar preparations
of this dish, I find the addition
of breadcrumbs irritating. In
the La Tour version, however,
the ingredients blended to
gether well.
Of the four soups offered
daily (from $2 for soup du jour
to $3.50 for lobster bisque) try
the unusual Soupe aux Truffes
Elysee (Truffle Soup — $6.95).
Truffles, julienned carrots and
onions in a mildly spicy broth
were covered with a puff pastry
top. Incidentally, this incredi
ble dish was created by the
grand chef Paul Bocuse for the
President of France.
Noisette d'Agneau au Porto
(lamb in port wine sauce —
$13.75) at first consideration
did not promise a sauce to rave
about. But it contained one of
those favorable "surprises" I
mentioned earlier — foie gras
in the sauce. A sensational

dish! Elegant French-style
green beans and a nicely
broiled tomato gave colorful
and textural balance to the pre
sentation of this dish.
The special of the evening
Loup de Mer en Croute (sea
bass stuffed with lobster
mousse and baked in a golden
pastry) was nothing short of in
spired. The sea bass was abso
lutely fresh and cooked to per
fection. On a side dish was a
sauce cauchon; it was good by
itself, but when paired with the
sea bass, it assumed a new
character and enhanced the
dish.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot orcold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, hot apple tart, mousse au
chocolat, and selected
cheeses.
Until La Tour the only re
staurant worthy of note in the
deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula was Les Provinces.
With the current gas crisis,pre
sumably the majordrawback to
Les Provinces is that it is in
Redwood City. Seniors, make
reservations early for gradua
tion. Vourparents will notwant
to drive up to San Francisco,
and they won't want to miss
this wonderful restaurant.

pastry covering on the
truffle soup. A customer order
ing the truffle soup followed by
one of the entrees en croute
may find his menu unba
lanced, with an excess of puff
pastry.
The menu contains a few
surprises, but by and large, its
offerings are relatively familiar.
Of the seven hors d'oeuvres,
Mousseline de Saint-Jacques
aux Pointes d'Asperges
(Mousee of scallops in lobster
sauce with asparagus — $6.50)
and Feuillete d'Huitre au Curry
(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) seemed the
most ambitious.
La Tour's representation of
Escargots de Bourgogne ($4.95)
is commendable for serving its
escargots on croutons, which
to my mind is superior to the
play-wi th-your-escargots-in
their-shells way. Palourdes au
Four (baked clams in herbs and

garlic butter — $3.95) were ex
cellent. In similar preparations
of this dish, I find the addition
of breadcrumbs irritating. In
the La Tour version, however,
the ingredients blended to
gether well.
Of the four soups offered
daily (from $2 for soup du jour
to $3.50 for lobster bisque) try
the unusual Soupe aux Truffes
Elysee (Truffle Soup — $6.95).
Truffles, julienned carrots and
onions in a mildly spicy broth
were covered with a puff pastry
top. Incidentally, this incredi
ble dish was created by the
grand chef Paul Bocuse for the
President of France.
Noisette d'Agneau au Porto
(lamb in port wine sauce —
$13.75) at first consideration
did not promise a sauce to rave
about. But it contained one of
those favorable "surprises" I
mentioned earlier — foie gras
in the sauce. A sensational

dish! Elegant French-style
green beans and a nicely
broiled tomato gave colorful
and textural balance to the pre
sentation of this dish.
The special of the evening
Loup de Mer en Croute (sea
bass stuffed with lobster
mousse and baked in a golden
pastry) was nothing short of in
spired. The sea bass was abso
lutely fresh and cooked to per
fection. On a side dish was a
sauce cauchon; it was good by
itself, but when paired with the
sea bass, it assumed a new
character and enhanced the
dish.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot orcold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, hot apple tart, mousse au
chocolat, and selected
cheeses.
Until La Tour the only re
staurant worthy of note in the
deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula was Les Provinces.
With the current gas crisis,pre
sumably the majordrawback to
Les Provinces is that it is in
Redwood City. Seniors, make
reservations early for gradua
tion. Vourparents will notwant
to drive up to San Francisco,
and they won't want to miss
this wonderful restaurant.

La Tour
525 University Ave. at Cowper
Palo Alto
321-6954
Every day I ride by the Office
Center building on University
at Cowper and think how out
of place it looks in downtown
Palo Alto. On the third floor of
that building is a restaurant
whose only claim to being out
of place in Palo Alto is that it is
the best restaurant in the city.
Indeed, many claim that it is
the best restaurant on the
Peninsula. And they are prob
ably right.
La Tour is owned by a Viet
namese family headed by Chef
HuynhTrung Lap. Afteroperat
ing one of the finest French re
staurants in Viet Nam, Chef
Huynh and his family came to
San Francisco and opend La
Cabane. La Cabane played to
generally favorable reviews.
Recently, however, the family

moved to the Peninsula, and
their new restaurant, La Tour,
has received reviews along the
lines of "dining experience."
And the accolades are well
deserved. Once you get off the
elevator, you feel an atmos
phere of exclusivity. Happily
this exclusivity does not make
the service and food pretenti
ous. Service is formal yet
good-natured and not oppres
sive; attentive without fawn
ing.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well. Dishes
do not call attention to them
selvs as they do at other French
restaurants. Descriptions of
the dishes on the menu are
pared down to a minimum and
leave room for surprises when
the dish arrives.
These surprises, however,
are not always in the patron's
best interests. For example,
there is no mention of a puff

pastry covering on the
truffle soup. A customer order
ing the truffle soup followed by
one of the entrees en croute
may find his menu unba
lanced, with an excess of puff
pastry.
