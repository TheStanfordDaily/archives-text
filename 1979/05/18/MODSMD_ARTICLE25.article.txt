Augusta's Restaurant

At Augusto's Restaurant, the
Initial 'mpression is "tacky." By
the end of the evening the
i bnracterization was more of
"inadvertent home-spun." For
a restaurant serving European
cuisine, with cooking a table
(or within view, anyway), the
style was considerably less
formal and polished than
others in this area.
My menu listed no prices, un
like that of my male compan
ion. To contrast this somewhat
annoying politeness, items that
were no longer offered were
covered over by a sticky white
label, which did not match the
beige paper: a touch of class

gone awry. As the meal got un
derway, however, the family
atmosphere created by the
cheerful but unobtrusive man
ner of the waiters,
overshadowed the awkward
decor.
Make no mistake, however,
the less formal style does not
compromise the prices. The
bill for two of us, less wine, but
including one drink each, was
$40. Without the a la carte
salad, and with a less expensive
dessert, that price would be
closer to $30.
For our dinner, we passed on
the escargots and mushroom
appetizers and ordered a la
Carte salads. Mine was a fresh
mushroom salad with a vineg
rette dressing. The salad was
exclusively mushrooms, ex
cept for the alfalfa sprouts gar
nish, and was excellent — re
freshing, tasty and delicately
seasoned. We also sampled
the heart of palm salad. If you
prefer crispy, chewy palm
hearts, you will like this dish,
served with a light vinegrette
dressing.
The price of the entree
(which averages around $10 or
$11) includes a green salad or
soup du jour, and a side-dish of
vegetables. Since I had or
dered a separate salad, I tasted
the soup du jour, asparagus
with spinach. The soup was
creamy, light, and a fine blend
of tastes.
My choice of entree was the
Tournados of beef: medallions
of beef served on toast rounds
and topped with a Bernaise
sauce. This was one of five beef
selections. The dish was cer
tainly good, but not the best
preparation that I have tasted.
The toast rounds were too
greasy, and the sauce was a
touch too tart. The cut of meat,
however, was wonderfully
tender and flavorful. Garnish
ing the plate were about three
French cut pieces of zucchini,
perhaps five pieces of cooked
carrot, and several chunks of
potato with parsley. The veget
ables were crisp, but had be
come greasy sitting on the
plate. The other beef selection
included Steak Diane Flambe
($l3), Pepper Steak Flambeand
a New York Steak.
Veal Piccata (with capers)
was good, though the meat

seemed a bit tough around the
edges. The sauce for this was
good, but heavier than I have
tasted elsewhere. There were
four veal entrees, among them
Veal Scallopine a la Marsala and
Veal Cordon Bleu served with
ratatouille.
Also on the entree menu
were sweetbreads, Chicken
Jerusalem ($8) and Chicken
Curacao (orange sauce), Filet
of Sole Meuniere, Red Snapper
and Scampi a la Creme (which is
not shrimp, but lobster tails).
The couple at the table near us,
long time patrons of Augus
to's, ordered the Scampi a la
Creme and reported it to be
very good.
After dinner, if you still have
room, several treats await on
the dessert list. We ordered
the Grand Marnier Souffle ($lO
for two persons) instead of the
Chocolate Mousse, Cherries
Flambe or Cheese Cake (up to
$2.75 each). Our souffle was
divine, though the sauce was
heavier than I prefer.
Topping off the evening, in
stead of plain black coffee
(which was a little weak), you
could take on a Cafe Nero or
Cafe Diablo. We split the flam
ing Cafe Nero. Whatever was
in it, it was good and potent!
An added extra to the even
ing was the piano music. Au
gusto Amador, owner of the
restaurant, is a concert pianist
from Peru. His presence, along
with his brothers, who were
among the patrons, contri
buted greatly to the warmth
and charm of the evening. In
deed, it was this presence that
transformed a somewhat insuf
ficient physical setup into a re
staurant with a warm, home
spun atmosphere.
Augusto's opened three
years ago as a restaurant, with
Margaret Amador as the chief
Cordon Bleu chef. Prior to that
it had been a piano bar in
which Augusto played. Slowly
the piano playing has been ph
ased out except Tor \ater 'in \he
evening when the pace eases.
In short, for the best in
haut cuisine and/or the most
formal of evenings, go some
where else. But for good Euro
pean food, in a friendly, re
laxed atmosphere, Augusto's is
a pleasant evening.

others in this area.
My menu listed no prices, un
like that of my male compan
ion. To contrast this somewhat
annoying politeness, items that
were no longer offered were
covered over by a sticky white
label, which did not match the
beige paper: a touch of class

gone awry. As the meal got un
derway, however, the family
atmosphere created by the
cheerful but unobtrusive man
ner of the waiters,
overshadowed the awkward
decor.
Make no mistake, however,
the less formal style does not
compromise the prices. The
bill for two of us, less wine, but
including one drink each, was
$40. Without the a la carte
salad, and with a less expensive
dessert, that price would be
closer to $30.
For our dinner, we passed on
the escargots and mushroom
appetizers and ordered a la
Carte salads. Mine was a fresh
mushroom salad with a vineg
rette dressing. The salad was
exclusively mushrooms, ex
cept for the alfalfa sprouts gar
nish, and was excellent — re
freshing, tasty and delicately
seasoned. We also sampled
the heart of palm salad. If you
prefer crispy, chewy palm
hearts, you will like this dish,
served with a light vinegrette
dressing.
The price of the entree
(which averages around $10 or
$11) includes a green salad or
soup du jour, and a side-dish of
vegetables. Since I had or
dered a separate salad, I tasted
the soup du jour, asparagus
with spinach. The soup was
creamy, light, and a fine blend
of tastes.
My choice of entree was the
Tournados of beef: medallions
of beef served on toast rounds
and topped with a Bernaise
sauce. This was one of five beef
selections. The dish was cer
tainly good, but not the best
preparation that I have tasted.
The toast rounds were too
greasy, and the sauce was a
touch too tart. The cut of meat,
however, was wonderfully
tender and flavorful. Garnish
ing the plate were about three
French cut pieces of zucchini,
perhaps five pieces of cooked
carrot, and several chunks of
potato with parsley. The veget
ables were crisp, but had be
come greasy sitting on the
plate. The other beef selection
included Steak Diane Flambe
($l3), Pepper Steak Flambeand
a New York Steak.
Veal Piccata (with capers)
was good, though the meat

seemed a bit tough around the
edges. The sauce for this was
good, but heavier than I have
tasted elsewhere. There were
four veal entrees, among them
Veal Scallopine a la Marsala and
Veal Cordon Bleu served with
ratatouille.
Also on the entree menu
were sweetbreads, Chicken
Jerusalem ($8) and Chicken
Curacao (orange sauce), Filet
of Sole Meuniere, Red Snapper
and Scampi a la Creme (which is
not shrimp, but lobster tails).
The couple at the table near us,
long time patrons of Augus
to's, ordered the Scampi a la
Creme and reported it to be
very good.
After dinner, if you still have
room, several treats await on
the dessert list. We ordered
the Grand Marnier Souffle ($lO
for two persons) instead of the
Chocolate Mousse, Cherries
Flambe or Cheese Cake (up to
$2.75 each). Our souffle was
divine, though the sauce was
heavier than I prefer.
Topping off the evening, in
stead of plain black coffee
(which was a little weak), you
could take on a Cafe Nero or
Cafe Diablo. We split the flam
ing Cafe Nero. Whatever was
in it, it was good and potent!
An added extra to the even
ing was the piano music. Au
gusto Amador, owner of the
restaurant, is a concert pianist
from Peru. His presence, along
with his brothers, who were
among the patrons, contri
buted greatly to the warmth
and charm of the evening. In
deed, it was this presence that
transformed a somewhat insuf
ficient physical setup into a re
staurant with a warm, home
spun atmosphere.
Augusto's opened three
years ago as a restaurant, with
Margaret Amador as the chief
Cordon Bleu chef. Prior to that
it had been a piano bar in
which Augusto played. Slowly
the piano playing has been ph
ased out except Tor \ater 'in \he
evening when the pace eases.
In short, for the best in
haut cuisine and/or the most
formal of evenings, go some
where else. But for good Euro
pean food, in a friendly, re
laxed atmosphere, Augusto's is
a pleasant evening.

At Augusto's Restaurant, the
Initial 'mpression is "tacky." By
the end of the evening the
i bnracterization was more of
"inadvertent home-spun." For
a restaurant serving European
cuisine, with cooking a table
(or within view, anyway), the
style was considerably less
formal and polished than
others in this area.
