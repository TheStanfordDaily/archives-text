Fournou's Ovens

When I was overseas, I made it a general
rule not to dine at hotel restaurants. The food
usually arrived limp and cold, and, except for
the selection of local cheeses—they are im
possible to harm—was uninspired.
Which brings me to the restaurant at the
Stanford Court Hotel, Fournou's Ovens.
Fournou s is a restaurant of some renown
and it deserves its reputation independent of
its exclusive mother establishment.
Six weeks ago, the $1 million addition to
the restaurant was completed. The new area
is much like a Victorian conservatory with
three glass cupolas and decorative metal
work. The interior combines brick floor in
the restaurant portion with wood flooring in
the cocktail lounge with big green plants,
stately white walls and elegant furniture. The
new wine cellar houses thousands of wines
that service the entire hotel.
The piano bar is comfortable and very
smart. Its view of the City from the corner of
Powell and California should earn an asterisk
of priority on anyone's list of bar-hopping
bars. At least it provides the perfect counter
point to the Top of the Mark.
Down the stairs, past the still life oil paint
ing and seated at a table, one forgets any
connection with Stanford Courtand, instead,
loses oneself in the sounds of the passing
cable cars.
For me, one of the telltale signs of a good
menu is whether I have a hard time deciding
between a number of dishes I wish to eat.
This is certainly the case at Fournou's. All
areas of the menu are well-balanced and dif
ficult choices present themselves equally in
the appetizer and entree categories.
Even the wine list is something to get ex
cited about. It contains perhaps the most
comprehensive listing of small California
wineries of quality. Chardonnays and caber
nets are especially well-represented.
Fournou's Ovens has 14 appetizers, (heavy
on the seafood), and the selection ranges
from Norwegian Herring in Sour Cream to
Artichoke alia Romana, from Little Cape Scal
lops to Olympia Oysters, Sauce Mignonette.

Quenellas Maison, Sauce Nantua made
from salmon were delicate and light, but
perhaps a touch too spongy. Two large ar
tichokes alia Romana arrived hot, and with a
more distinct lemon flavor than I remember
from those a Roma.
Of the four well-chosen soups, Cream of
Artichoke with Hazlenut was sublime. Four
nou's also offers the little-seen elegant Chil
led Cream of Watercress.
Entrees are divided into two sections:
"from the ovens" and"from the cuisine."
The entrees listed under "from the cuisine"
include four seafood dishes—sand dabs,
Dungeness crab, Pacific salmon and
petrale—that exemplify the California sea
food offerings. Sweetbreads, beef and veal
round out this category. In particular, the
Rosette of Veal, Hassler's Villa Medici, was
outstanding. This dish of mushrooms,
cream, and some of the whitest and most
tender veal I have ever sampled, portends
favorably for the other dishes from the
cuisine.
But it is for its dishes "from the ovens" that
Fournou's is famous. In fact the ovens are in
plain sight in the "old" part of the restaurant.
Every night customers are treated to Roast
Sonoma Capon a L'Estragon, Roast Native
Duckling with Green Peppercorn and Kum
quat Sauce, and roast Prime Rib. The top
item, however, is the incredible Roast Rack of
Lamb, Sauce aux Aromates, a generous por
tion of appropriately pink, absolutely tender
lamb. The sauce, although fine, contained
mint and provided an unusual complement
to the lamb. But then, for a person of Creek
origin, mint and lamb are a strange combina
tion.
The dessert selection has something for
every — Profiteroles, fresh strawberry tar
telette, brie and even cheesecake. Lemon
mousse makes a refreshing and light ending
to the meal.
Clearly, Fournou's Ovens is more than
your average hotel restaurant. But it is a re
staurant that makes no big pretentions; its
menu may be diverse but all the dishes I tried
were handled not merely with competence
but with style. Moreover, both the menu and
the wine list offer the traveler at Stanford
Court and the diner the gastronomique best
of California.
