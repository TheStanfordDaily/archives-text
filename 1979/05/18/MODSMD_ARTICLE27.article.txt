# Moroccan mystique in S.F.

El Mansour

San Francisco
751-2312
Tucked away on a residential
street in San Fiancisco, the El
Mansour restaurant is a gate
way to delightful dining. An
evening spent at El Mansour
involves more than just food—
instead it is a captivating ex
perience, inviting any adven
turous soul into the mystery
and mystique of Morroco. The
setting is somewhat dark and
very intimate. Once we left the
street, we were immersed in a
tent-like atmosphere, deco
rated with stained glass lamps
hanging from the ceilings, and
exotic rugs. Thirteen low tables
adorn the outer edge of the
rather small room. Each is
handmade of inlaid wood and
is surrounded by low couches
and hassocks.
The dining experience be
gins with the traditional hand
washing, where the authenti
cally clad waiters pour water
from a gleaming urn over the
diners' hands. In true Moroc
can style, no utensils are pro
vided and turkish towels re
place napkins. Eating with
one's fingers adds to the sen
suous dining pleasure.
The waiters are graceful and
almost gymnastic. They kneel
down beside each table and
patiently explain the content
and flavor of each dish.
Now to the food. Complete
dinners are $11.75. For this
price, diners may chose among

14 entrees, including Cousc
ous with lamb or chicken,
chicken with almonds, lemon,
or honey, or Lamb with lemon,
honey, prunes, vegetables,
eggplant or onions. The menu
also offers rabbit with paprika
or Brochette Kabab. I recom
mend going in a party of four
so that each member can sam
ple a different delicacy.
The first course is harira
soup, an exotic combination of
lentils and ginger. It is a soup
to sip, not gulp, directly from
the bowl. The soup comes with
a round unsalted bread which
the waiter served out of a un
ique velvet-like container.
The Salade Mohammed V
was an artistic and spicy com
bination of cucumbers, car
rots, eggplant and bell pep
per. The spices were difficult to
identify, yet each vegetable
was intriguing. The next
course—Bastela du Chef—was
another taste treat. Wafer thin

filo dough enclosed
cinnamon-spiced chicken, and
was covered by sifted pow
dered sugar. It was a challenge
to eat with our fingers.
The main courses were in
teresting. The Couscous with
Chicken offered a delightful
combination of textures,
flavors, and spices. The
Semolina (a cracked grain) was
covered by chicken, garbonzo
beans, summer squash, other
vegetables and raisins. The
Lamb with Honey was a bit too
sweet, but it was a very gener
ous portion.
The dessert was a slightly
greasy fried banana. It was
served with mint tea. The wai
ter dramatically poured the tea
from a height of four feet away
from the glasses.
El Mansour is an adventure.
It offers the flavor of Morocco
for a fair price, and is a refresh
ing change from the ordinary.
