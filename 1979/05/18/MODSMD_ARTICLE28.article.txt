Escape the noisy, hectic
dorm dining room for a quiet,
relaxing and casual dinner at
the Two Sisters Creperie in Los
Altos. The interior ot the re
staurant lends itself to intimate
dining; tastefully sectioned off
with a combination of wood
panels and stained glass. Fresh
flowers and a candle complete
the setting where quiet con
versation is the rule not the ex
ception.
The Two Sisters Creperie is a
delightful dining experience.
The service is friendly and var
ied, with the waitress, man
ager, and one of the chefs all
taking part. The dinners are
solid, but the salads and the
desserts are the outstanding
offerings.
For appetizers, two types of
soup are offered along with a
basket of french bread and but
ter ($.50). The French Onion
soup was tasty but was sea
soned with a little too much
parmesan cheese. The soup du
jour (soup of the day)— Oxtail

soup—was a delicious combi
nation of vegetables, barley,
and oxtails.
The dinner menu features
entree crepes, with other
entrees—Quiche Lorraine
($5.25) and Crab Quiche
($5.75) —also offered along
with a daily special such as Leg
of Lamb ($6.50) or Prime Rib au
jus ($8.50).
There are a variety of ap
petizing salads to choose from
including a large plate from the
extensive salad bar ($3.00). The
Fresh Fruit Salad ($3.25) was
outstanding. The pieces of ap
ple, orange, pear, pineapple,
banana, grapefruit and straw
berries, topped with sour
cream, were fresh and crisp.
The Avocado Farci ($3.75), an
avocado stuffed (and overflow
ing) with small, tender shrimp,
was served on a bed of lettuce
dotted with tomato halves and
black olives.
The entree crepes, ranging
from $5.25. to $6.25, include
choice of soup or salad bar,
and rice pilaf. A very nice fea
ture of the menu is that for an
additional $2 the extra hungry
diner can order a second
crepe.
The Fisherman's Choice
($6.25), delicate pieces of sal

mon and tender spinach wrap
ped in a crepe and covered
with Hollandaise sauce, was
overwhelmed by the large
amount of spinach. The Four
Star Crepe ($5.50), a combina
tion of ham, swiss cheese and
fresh mushrooms in a white
wine sauce, was delicious even
though the pieces of ham were
a little chewy. The Seafood
Newburg ($6.25), a crepe stuf
fed with scallops and shrimp
topped with a light, tangy,
Newburg sauce was tasty, but
the scallops were too large in
comparison with the bitesize
shrimp. All crepes are served
with rice pilaf and a slice of
orange.
The most difficult decision of
the evening was trying to de
cide which of the seven tan
talizing dessert crepes to try.
The desserts were works of art.
The )amaican Pleasure ($2.25),
a crepe filled with vanilla ice
cream, banana slices sauteed
in brown sugar, butter and
rum, topped with whipped
cream and nuts, was a tropical
dream. The Fantasy Fudge
Crepe ($2.25), a warm crepe
stuffed with vanilla ice cream
and smothered in hot fudge
sauce is a must for the sundae
fiend.

There are a collection of spe
cialty coffees to go with, or
substitute for, your dessert,
ranging from Espresso(s.Bs) to
Athenian coffee (s2)—
Continental coffee touched
with Amaretto and whipped
cream.
The Two Sisters Creperie is
the brainchild of two sisters,
Elaine and Kay Gross. During
Elaine's sophomore year at
Stanford, she studied at the
French campus in Tours. Ideas
for starting a creperie took root
and grew as she was a frequent
visitor to many French cre
peries. Much of the decor of
the restaurant is the result of
collecting antiques and post
ers, and taking pictures of vari
ous areas in France.
The Creperie was managed
by Elaine and Kay for about
three years. Last June, the Cre
perie was bought by Jean
Wolfgram. Jean is currently
teaching home economics at
Cubberley High School in Palo
Alto during the day and manag
ing the restaurant at night.
Drinks are available at the
recently added bar. The wine
list features several foreign
wines along with the house
wine—lnglenook.
