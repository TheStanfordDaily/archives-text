A Star is Born * * * *
Friday, Kresge
George Cukor directed this
first-rate musical about a star on
the way up (|udy Garland) who
marries a star on the way down
(lames Mason). This is another
good film that was mistreated by
the studio — the top brass at
Warner Brothers chopped out
several scenes and musical num
bers, saying the film was too
long, and then stuck in the 20-
minute long "Born in a Trunk"
number (not directed by Cukor).
What remains is distinguished
mainly by the performances of
Garland, who must have found
much to identify with in her role
as an entertainer for whom suc
cess also brings loneliness, and
Mason, who brings a unique
pathos to his thankless role as the
star who finds himself eclipsed
by his wife. (1954)

Park, Menlo Park
There's no way this movie
could be better than TV — it/s TV,

Battlestar Calactica's premiere
episode may have been blown up
to big-screen size, but all of its
little-screen ideas have been left
intact. Even on television this
program was sadly lacking in in
terest; in their efforts to out-do
Star Wars' special effects, the
people at ABC forgot to include
any characters worth watching.
The only interesting quirk was
the casting of Lome Greene as
the leader of the space clan: he
carries American imperialism
from the old west of Bonanza to
the wide-open spaces between
planets.

There's a good supply of petty

The Long Goodbye * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Elliott Gould just might be the
most offbeat Philip Marlowe im
aginable, but he fits right into this
dreamy and very funny Robert
Altman movie. Altman set the
Raymond Chandler mystery in
the '70s; he doesn't just change
the setting — he rethinks the
novel to fit his playful (in this
case) vision of L.A. This is one of
Altman's most laid-back movies,
and perhaps so subtle that it will
go right by you — it's no accident
that this movie failed at the box
office. (1973)

Clark Cable portrays Fletcher

ween his recognition of Bligh's

Peter Weir directed this fine,

The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para

Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father

former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old causes
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
Occasionally this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How

ing cast give thoughtful and pro

the script fails them. (1978)

The Deer Hunter ★★★ v *
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo lima: the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt a' excavation.

The China Syndrome * * * #
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.

Coming Home * * * ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers from poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time. Jane Fonda and |on
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.

Wifemistress # *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, )ason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.

Biograph, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust

textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in-the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.

The Champ ★ &
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac

start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry- r
ing about is the fate of jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance P
after half a decade makes things '
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.

The Deer Hunter ★★★ v *
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo lima: the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt a' excavation.

This superb thriller, which uses

Elliott Gould just might be the

The premise of this film is an

who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini

A Star is Born, the 1954 musical starring |udy Garland and |ames

Academy Award for best picture, can be seen at the Bijou, Palo

A Star is Born * * * *
Friday, Kresge
George Cukor directed this
first-rate musical about a star on
the way up (|udy Garland) who
marries a star on the way down
(lames Mason). This is another
good film that was mistreated by
the studio — the top brass at
Warner Brothers chopped out
several scenes and musical num
bers, saying the film was too
long, and then stuck in the 20-
minute long "Born in a Trunk"
number (not directed by Cukor).
What remains is distinguished
mainly by the performances of
Garland, who must have found
much to identify with in her role
as an entertainer for whom suc
cess also brings loneliness, and
Mason, who brings a unique
pathos to his thankless role as the
star who finds himself eclipsed
by his wife. (1954)

The only interesting quirk was
the casting of Lome Greene as

Coming Home * * * ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers from poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time. Jane Fonda and |on
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.

Wifemistress # *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

Hurricane *
Royal, San Francisco
The $22 million spent on this
passionless romp through the
surf could have been put to bet
ter use making half a dozen smal
ler, less overblown films: at least
one might have been worth
watching. Mia Farrow, )ason
Robards, and a Hawaiian surfer
named Dayton ka'Ne star. They
all look a little embarrassed by
the whole thing. All plot compli
cations are washed away by the
climactic hurricane — it should
have come about an hour earlier.

Norma Rae * * * * J* v -
Biograph, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in-the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.

The Champ ★ &
Old Mill, Mountain View
If the handkerchief manufac
turers were expecting a windfall
from this tearjerker, they might
start looking elsewhere for re
venue. The only thing worth cry- r
ing about is the fate of jon Voight
and Faye Dunaway, two capable
performers run aground by
Franco Zeffirelli's cheap-trick di
rection. The story concerns a
boxer, his sickeningly adorable
8-year-old son, and his ex-wife,
whose sudden reappearance P
after half a decade makes things '
unpleasant for all concerned.
Even before the first reel is un
wound, it's painfully clear that
The Champ's a chump.

A Star is Born, the 1954 musical starring |udy Garland and |ames
Mason, plays tonight in Kresge. The Deer Hunter, winner of
Academy Award for best picture, can be seen at the Bijou, Palo
Alto.

A Star is Born * * * *
Friday, Kresge
George Cukor directed this
first-rate musical about a star on
the way up (|udy Garland) who
marries a star on the way down
(lames Mason). This is another
good film that was mistreated by
the studio — the top brass at
Warner Brothers chopped out
several scenes and musical num
bers, saying the film was too
long, and then stuck in the 20-
minute long "Born in a Trunk"
number (not directed by Cukor).
What remains is distinguished
mainly by the performances of
Garland, who must have found
much to identify with in her role
as an entertainer for whom suc
cess also brings loneliness, and
Mason, who brings a unique
pathos to his thankless role as the
star who finds himself eclipsed
by his wife. (1954)
—Jim Mattson
Battlestar Calactica
Park, Menlo Park
There's no way this movie
could be better than TV — it/s TV,
a pilot episode, to be exact.
Battlestar Calactica's premiere
episode may have been blown up
to big-screen size, but all of its
little-screen ideas have been left
intact. Even on television this
program was sadly lacking in in
terest; in their efforts to out-do
Star Wars' special effects, the
people at ABC forgot to include
any characters worth watching.
The only interesting quirk was
the casting of Lome Greene as
the leader of the space clan: he
carries American imperialism
from the old west of Bonanza to
the wide-open spaces between
planets.

An Unmarried Woman * * * *
Biograph
Writer-director Paul Mazurs
ky's faintly feminist look at '70s
divorce is perhaps a little too
smooth, but (ill Clayburgh's per
formance is so richly tender and
comic that that really doesn't
matter. It'sasoaringand convinc
ing piece of acting, neatly com
plemented by Alan Bates' per
formance as the man who nearly
convinces Clayburgh to make a
commitment again. With Michael
Murphy. (1978)
—Ron Lillejord
Pardon Mon Affaire * *
Wednesday, Bishop
There's a good supply of petty
snideness here but not much
else. This movie purports to re
flect the "new morality"; this is
odd because the whole thing
seems to have been filmed from
the viewpoint of a middle-aged
barber shop lecher. Starring Jean
Rochefort, Claude Brasseur, and
Guy Bedos. Yves Boisset di
rected. (1977)
—J.M.
The Long Goodbye * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Elliott Gould just might be the
most offbeat Philip Marlowe im
aginable, but he fits right into this
dreamy and very funny Robert
Altman movie. Altman set the
Raymond Chandler mystery in
the '70s; he doesn't just change
the setting — he rethinks the
novel to fit his playful (in this
case) vision of L.A. This is one of
Altman's most laid-back movies,
and perhaps so subtle that it will
go right by you — it's no accident
that this movie failed at the box
office. (1973)
—R.L.

Director Robert Altman sets up
a scene for The Long Goodbye.
The 1973 version of Raymond
Chandler's book plays Tuesday
and Wednesday at the New
Varsity, Palo Alto.

Mutiny on the Bounty * ★ * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alio
Charles Laughton creates the
ultimate Captain Bligh in this
MGM adaptation of the famous
revoltat sea. Laughton's Bligh is a
driven figure of cruelty, crazed
with power and unable to stop
even had he wished to show
compassion to the hapless crew
members of the H.M.S. Bounty.
Clark Cable portrays Fletcher
Christian, the seaman torn bet
ween his recognition of Bligh's
legal authority and his realization
that Bligh may be a madman.
Though it may be dated in terms
of film technique (much is obvi
ously shot in the studio tank), this
film's performances allow it to re
tain all of its original dramatic ap
peal. Frank Lloyd directed. (1935)
—J.M.
Picnic at Hanging Rock * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip fo the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.

Manhattan * * * *
Palo Alto Square
'S Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his
'70s trilogy with a film that will
rank as one of the few master
pieces of this decade. Manhattan
is a bitterly funny examination of
a city and a lifestyle. It bites close
enough to the bone to be both
hilarious and oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane keaton,
Michael Murphy, Mariel
Hemingway and Meryl Streep.
Written by Woody Allen and
Marshall Brickman. Photogr.ijV l '

On Her Majesty's Secret Service
Saturday, Cubberley * * *
This less-than-stellar lames
Bond movie has a great ski chase,
but Sean Connery's one-shot re
placement, George Lazenby,
never really gets it going as 007.
Thankfully, Diana Rigg is one of
the few "Bond women" who can
put together a coherent thought,
and she keeps the movie enjoy
able by blowing Lazenby off the
screen.
—R.L.

The Big Fix * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old causes
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
Occasionally this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and pro
voking performances even when
the script fails them. (1978)
—Amy Gerstin
The Deer Hunter ★★★ v *
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo lima: the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
script writers' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt a' excavation.

The China Syndrome * * * #
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
