# Netters in front early at AIAW Regionals

### Steve Pearson 
After the first day of competi
tion in the AIAW Regional Indi
vidual Championships at Cal
Poly-Pomona, Stanford's wo
men's tennis team has ad
vanced five singles players into
the third round of the tourna
ment.
The strong Cardinal contin
gent that started the tourney in
hope of qualifying for the na
tional championships included
Kathy Jordan, Alycia Moulton,
Susie Hagey, Donna Rubin,
Caryn Hertel, Julia Leighton
and Lucy Cordon.

Competition in this region of
the AIAW, which covers
California, Nevada and Hawaii,
is among the toughest in the
nation. Jordan is top-seeded
and heavily favored in the sing
les. Her closest competition
may come from her teammate
Moulton, who is the second
seeded player.
Following the two Cardinals
in the seedings are Anna-Maria
Fernandez of USC and UCLA's
Dana Gilbert. USC's number
one player, Stacy Margolin,
who has beaten Jordan twice
this year, is competing in Japan

and is not entered in the tour
nament.
In yesterday's early-round
action all but three Cardinals
were victorious. Caryn Hertel
easily won her first round
match, only to fall 6-1, 6-2 to
Karen Peterson of Cal-State
Fullerton. Lucy Cordon and
Julia Leighton were also first
round winners who were de
feated in the next round.
Sue Rasmussen moved into
the third round of competition
with a 7-6, 6-2 victory over
Gloria Faltermeier of UC-Santa
Barbara.

Cards Jordan, Moulton,
Hagey and Rubin all had first
round byes and second-round
victories in the tournament to
join Rasmussen.
The overall strength of the
singles draw in this year's reg
ionals is shown in the pre
tournament seedings. Former
national singles champ Barbara
Hallquist of USC is the seventh
seed, while 1978 All-American
Sheila Mclnerney of USC could
do no better than ninth. Sur
prisingly, three-time All-
American Susie Hagey of Stan
ford, a national singles quarter
finalist last year, was not
among the top 16 seeds.
In the doubles competition,
where the Cardinal team of
Jordan and Moulton is the top

seed, no results from yesterday
were available. Second-seeded
behind the Stanford pair is UC
LA's number one team of Dana
Gilbert and Ann Henricksson.
The regional championships
run through this weekend,
with the singles and doubles
finals on Sunday.
