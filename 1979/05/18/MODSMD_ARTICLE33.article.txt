# Cards limp into Pac-10 track
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
JJ;'"The Stanford track and field
Kseason mercifully culminates
\ this weekend with the staging
j/of the Pacific-10 Track and Field
' .Tpharnpionships on the Arizona
• State University campus.' 1
Mercifully, because the
J Stanford squad, not a very
£ strong one to begin with, has
112 been decimated by injuries.
I Foremost among the wounded
112 is sophomore Darrin Nelson,
one of the top sprinters in the
r conference and among the
• best long jumpers in the na
• tion. Nelson had already
leaped 25-feet-4% when he
i tore a hamstring tendon early
in the season against UCLA.
; Nelson was just the start,
i Javelin thrower Gary Bruner,
i sprinter Gordon Banks and
! Steeplechaser Harold Celms
• have also been knocked out of
competition, with Banks being
the only one who has a chance
to go to Tempe (late yesterday
afternoon, the status of his
sprained ankle was unknown).
"We obviously go into the
meet with thin ranks," head

coach Payton Jordan said, ad
ding that losing Nelson "has
changed the entire complex
ion of our team."
As a result of the injuries,
only 17 athletes are making the
trip, and the Cardinals are a
good bet to finish in the con
ference cellar for the fourth
time in five years. What re
mains unknown is whether the
team will score in double fi
gures.
Only two Stanford athletes
appear on the list of the Pac
10's best results for all 20
events being contested. Nel
son, who gets his cast off to
day, ranks fourth with his long
jump of 25-4Vi. Senior Roy Kis
sin ranks sixth in the 10,000
meters with a time of 29:32.2.
Kissin, thus the only bona
fide contender, finished sixth
in the NCAAs last year, an indi
cation of how strong the Pac-10
is this year.
"I threw in the 170's (feet)
last year and finished sixth (in
the conference)," hammer
thrower Dave Thomson said.
"This year I'll have to throw in

the mid-190's to finish fourth."
The sophomore's best throw
this season is 191-1.
Some of the other top per
formers for the Cards include
middle distance runners John
Schaer and Tom Lobsinger,
hurdlers Ken Margerum and
Garry Shumway and steep
lechasers Bill Gail and Bill Hal
derman.
The three teams given the
best chance to take the confer
ence title are Oregon, UCLA
and defending champion USC.
Oregon defeated UCLA in a
dual meet early this year, while
USC had their 22-meet win
streak broken by the Bruins.
Jordan assessed the team as
pointing positively towards the
future.
"We're predominantly a
freshman-sophomore team,''
Jordan said. "I think our kids
will continue to compete
tough like they have all year.
They're a gutty bunch."
Besides, as baseball great
Satchel Paige put it, "Don't
look back. Something might be
gaining on you."
