# Rowers ready for Pac-10 Regatta
## 
### Gray Maxwell 
Most of the west coast crews will end their seasons this
weekend in big regattas at Redwood Shores and Lexington Re
sevoir, both near Stanford. The third annual Pacific-10 Champ
ionships will be held at Stanford's home course at Redwood
Shores while the Western Sprints will be held in Los Gatos.
The featured event of the Pac-10'swill bethe men'svarsity eight
competition, which should pit the best of the west — Steve
Gladstone's California Bears and Dick Erikson's Washington
Huskies — against each other in the finals.
Cal has defeated Washington twice this season (once at the San
Diego Crew Classic and again two weeks ago up in Seattle) and
has drawn a bye in the opening heats, which are slated for a 10:20
start this morning. Washington is heavily favored to defeat USC
and UCLA should beat Washington State.
Stanford will open against Oregon State in what varsity coach
Phil Waters describes as the Cardinal's "most important race of
the season."
Should Stanford win, the eight will enter the winner's bracket
but will be in the unenviable position of having to race Cal later
this afternoon. If the Cardinals lose, the highest possible Stan
ford finish in the finals on Saturday would be fifth.
The JV's will also be racing today and will face Washington in
the preliminary heat, starting at 9:20 a.m. Waters describes the
action as "a long weekend of rowing—extremely long," for the
varsity and JV eights are entered in both the Pac-10's and the
Western Sprints (which begin tomorrow). The boats will race
three times at Redwood Shores and twice at the Western Sprints.
Stanford's varsity and JV eights will forego the opening heats at
Los Gatos and will be entered in the repechage heats scheduled
for later Saturday afternoon. The first two finishers of each re
pechage heat will advance to the final, which is slated for Sunday
morning. Long Beach, which narrowly defeated Stanford for the
California Maritime Cup down at San Diego at the beginning of
the season, is the eight to beat.
Favored in the JV competition are Orange Coast Junior College
and UC-lrvine.
Cardinal freshmen are not competing in the Pac-10's, and in
stead are sending an eight and a four to the Western Sprints.
Frosh coach Mark Grosenbaugh thinks that the frosh boats will
definitely peak for the Sprints, saying that "the Cal race (Stanford
lost) was a good race because we learned something . . . we've
put in a good, solid week of practice and right now the boats are
moving faster than ever."
Grosenbaugh went on to say that "We're traveling to Los Gatos
with the primary objective of getting into the finals — once we are
there, the race will take care of itself. OCC and Irvine are tough,
but they're certainly not invincible."
The Stanford women may be the busiest of any rowers over the
weekend. Stanford will enter novice and open eights in the Pac
10's and the women will be forced to race three times today and
once again tomorrow morning at Redwood Shores before pack
ing up and heading to Lexington Reservoir.
