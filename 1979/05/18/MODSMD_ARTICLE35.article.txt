## USA 2nd with frosh in hole Campbell:national champs to national team 
### Mike ONeal 
Jody Campbell is quite the
well-travelled young man. Play
ing water p«lo for the Ameri
can junior national and na
tional teams for three years, he
has gone in and out from be
hind the Iron Curtain enough
times to rival Cyrus Vance.
After travelling to Holland,
Bulgaria, Rumania, Puerto
Rico and Mexico City though,
his trip to Yugoslavia last
month was his most memora
ble.
"It was the first trip of this
kind I've taken with the na
tional team and it's a whole dif
ferent thing," Campbell said."
You get a lot more respect and
you know your representing
the best of your country."
The "kind" of trip the U.S.
team took to Yugoslavia was
one to play the last important
world class tournament before
the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
The top eight teams in the
world were there for two
weeks of round robin play and
the U.S. came up second be
hind Hungary in the best finish
an American squad has ever
had in world competition.
The "Fina Cup," as the tour
nament was called, had a fairly
odd finish. Hungary was clearly
the victor after winning all its
games, but second place was
more difficult to decide.
The United States, who
ended up second, lost to both
Hungary and Yugoslavia, while
Yugoslavia, finishing third, lost
to Hungary and then to West
Germany on somewhat of a
fluke. Both the United States
and Yugoslavia won the rest of
their games and West Cermany

lost most of theirs, so second
place had to be calculated by
comparing the number of
goals scored by the two teams
in their respective games.
This sheds some light on just
how impressive starting for the
national team is. Campbell,
who is a freshman, scored 27
points from the hole and was
an integral part of the 1978
NCAA championship team. He
is the youngest player on the
30-man national team. He is
one of three undergraduates
on the 11-man traveling squad.
Campbell is usually the third
man alternate at his position on
the team but got his chance to
travel to Yugoslavia when the
number one player badly cut
his finger in a chainsaw acci
dent. There is no telling how
long Campbell will hold his
position and we might see him
in Moscow. But as of now he is
looking to play in the 1984
Olympics. He is 19 and playing
against teams whose players'
ages average 30.
Campbell has been to
Europe and the Communist
Bloc enough times that one
might expect he would have
seen it all by the time he got to
Yugoslavia. But according to
Campbell, Yugoslavia is diffe
rent than the other Bloc coun
tries.
"In Rumania and Bulgaria,"
he said, "the people seemed
generally to be unhappy or
gloomy. In Yugoslavia that
wasn't true at all. The Yugos
lavs were really friendly and
seemed happy with their situa
tion."
According to Campbell, the
U.S. team was very well re

ceived in President Tito's re
gime and the people seemed
to really enjoy the Americans.
Campbell explained that "one
of the best things about the trip
was to walk into a bar and talk
or sing with the people as well
as we could. We'd pass out lit
tle U.S. polo pins and create a
commotion and pretty soon
they'd be slapping us on the

back and giving us beers. The
people were really warm."
After training for a week and
playing four games in Bel
grade, which Campbell de
scribes as "a pretty boring
place," the team finished out
the tournament at Riaka on the
Adriatic Coast. Even though
the games were on TV, the
polo stadiums filled up their

average five to seven thousand
seats (water polo is one of the
most popular sports in Eastern
Europe).
"Polo there is like basketball
or football is here — the fans
really get into it," Campbell
said. "They'll get on the refs'
case and yell a lot, but they
mostly cheer for good polo be

cause they know a lot about the
game. They'd always applaud a
good play."
The team took a very close
second behind Hungary, who
has been the best team in the

world for about 10 years.
Campbell felt that the United
States outplayed them and
could have brought home the
first place medals, but it was
still a great moment for the
Stanford freshman.
"Standing on the tier,"
Campbell said, "with our Na
tional Anthem playing and the
TV cameras going and feeling
like I really represented the
United States in an important
tournament was the most im
pressive thing I've ever done.
The feeling was indescribable.
It made the whole trip."
And for someone who strug
gles with Chem homework like
anyone else, that's under
standable.

"It was the first trip of this
kind I've taken with the na
tional team and it's a whole dif
ferent thing," Campbell said."
You get a lot more respect and
you know your representing
the best of your country."
The "kind" of trip the U.S.
team took to Yugoslavia was
one to play the last important
world class tournament before
the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
The top eight teams in the
world were there for two
weeks of round robin play and
the U.S. came up second be
hind Hungary in the best finish
an American squad has ever
had in world competition.
The "Fina Cup," as the tour
nament was called, had a fairly
odd finish. Hungary was clearly
the victor after winning all its
games, but second place was
more difficult to decide.
The United States, who
ended up second, lost to both
Hungary and Yugoslavia, while
Yugoslavia, finishing third, lost
to Hungary and then to West
Germany on somewhat of a
fluke. Both the United States
and Yugoslavia won the rest of
their games and West Cermany

lost most of theirs, so second
place had to be calculated by
comparing the number of
goals scored by the two teams
in their respective games.
This sheds some light on just
how impressive starting for the
national team is. Campbell,
who is a freshman, scored 27
points from the hole and was
an integral part of the 1978
NCAA championship team. He
is the youngest player on the
30-man national team. He is
one of three undergraduates
on the 11-man traveling squad.
Campbell is usually the third
man alternate at his position on
the team but got his chance to
travel to Yugoslavia when the
number one player badly cut
his finger in a chainsaw acci
dent. There is no telling how
long Campbell will hold his
position and we might see him
in Moscow. But as of now he is
looking to play in the 1984
Olympics. He is 19 and playing
against teams whose players'
ages average 30.
Campbell has been to
Europe and the Communist
Bloc enough times that one
might expect he would have
seen it all by the time he got to
Yugoslavia. But according to
Campbell, Yugoslavia is diffe
rent than the other Bloc coun
tries.
"In Rumania and Bulgaria,"
he said, "the people seemed
generally to be unhappy or
gloomy. In Yugoslavia that
wasn't true at all. The Yugos
lavs were really friendly and
seemed happy with their situa
tion."
According to Campbell, the
U.S. team was very well re

ceived in President Tito's re
gime and the people seemed
to really enjoy the Americans.
Campbell explained that "one
of the best things about the trip
was to walk into a bar and talk
or sing with the people as well
as we could. We'd pass out lit
tle U.S. polo pins and create a
commotion and pretty soon
they'd be slapping us on the

back and giving us beers. The
people were really warm."
After training for a week and
playing four games in Bel
grade, which Campbell de
scribes as "a pretty boring
place," the team finished out
the tournament at Riaka on the
Adriatic Coast. Even though
the games were on TV, the
polo stadiums filled up their

average five to seven thousand
seats (water polo is one of the
most popular sports in Eastern
Europe).
"Polo there is like basketball
or football is here — the fans
really get into it," Campbell
said. "They'll get on the refs'
case and yell a lot, but they
mostly cheer for good polo be

cause they know a lot about the
game. They'd always applaud a
good play."
The team took a very close
second behind Hungary, who
has been the best team in the

world for about 10 years.
Campbell felt that the United
States outplayed them and
could have brought home the
first place medals, but it was
still a great moment for the
Stanford freshman.
"Standing on the tier,"
Campbell said, "with our Na
tional Anthem playing and the
TV cameras going and feeling
like I really represented the
United States in an important
tournament was the most im
pressive thing I've ever done.
The feeling was indescribable.
It made the whole trip."
And for someone who strug
gles with Chem homework like
anyone else, that's under
standable.
Jody Campbell is quite the
well-travelled young man. Play
ing water p«lo for the Ameri
can junior national and na
tional teams for three years, he
has gone in and out from be
hind the Iron Curtain enough
times to rival Cyrus Vance.
After travelling to Holland,
Bulgaria, Rumania, Puerto
Rico and Mexico City though,
his trip to Yugoslavia last
month was his most memora
ble.
