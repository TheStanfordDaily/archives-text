# JVs drop playoff opener

### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford junior varsity
baseball team was squeezed
out of a first place finish in its
division Tuesday afternoon
when the junior varsity of the
University of Santa Clara de
feated the young Cards 6-2.
The two teams were forced
into a single-game playoff
when Santa Clara won Sun
day's make-up game and

evened the two teams"
regular-season records at 15
wins, five losses.
In the final playoff Tuesday,
Bronco pitcher Kevin McKenna
went the distance and col
lected his fifth win this year
against the Cards. In all five
games played against the
Broncos this year and nine
times during the past two
years, Santa Clara has emerged

victorious.
Bob Boatman absorbed the
loss for Stanford — a tough loss
considering the fact that he al
lowed but five hits and only
two of the six Santa Clara runs
were earned.
The Broncos blew the game
wide open in the fifth inning of
the contest when Boatman
walked two batters and al
lowed a double and single
shortly thereafter. Then a
costly error by shortstop Bob
DeCosta allowed two more
Santa Clara baserunners to
cross the plate and the Cardi
nals were looking at a 4-1 de
ficit.
After Santa Clara scored one
run in each of the next two in
nings, Stanford tried to come
back and started a rally in the
eighth. But the rally died after
designated hitter Kevin McC
lain doubled and Don Ericson
singled him home. Two runs
were all the Cards could mus
ter in the nine inning stint.
