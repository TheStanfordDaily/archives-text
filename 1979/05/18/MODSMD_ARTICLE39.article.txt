Palestinian autonomy approved
Tel Aviv, Israel — A Cabinet committee yesterday
approved a 22-point plan for Palestinian autonomy
in the West Bank and Gaza, prompting Defense
Minister Ezer Weizman to ask to be removed from
a team negotiating the plan with Egypt next week,
Slate Radio reported.
The broadcast said the committee voted unani
mously to prevent an independent state in the
occupied areas and uphold Israel's intention to
reassert its claim to both areas after five years.
Weizman, who often held more dovish views
than Prime Minister Menachem Begin during the
peace treaty negotiations, was reported to feel
that the Israeli plan does not provide a basis for
substantive talks. The state radio said his request
to be released from the six-man team would have
to be approved by the Cabinet. He is not on the
committee.
Meanwhile, seaborne Israeli commandos de
stroyed a Palestinian guerrilla training base yes
terday on the Lebanese coast about 20 miles north
of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
According to the Israeli army command, the
Palestinian base was near the Lebanese town of
Adloun, eight miles north of the port of Tyre.
The command reported no casualties among the
raiders and said nothing about Palestinian casual
ties.
Castro, Portillo discuss trade
Co/mul, Mexico — Cuban President Eidel Cas
tro, returning to Mexico yesterday for the first time
since he was an exile 21 years ago, said he did not
come to ask for material goods but to "tighten the
bonds of friendship" with the oil-rich nation.
"We do not come to solicit anything material
nor to ask for oil or gas . . . but to satisfy the desire
of greeting you personally and bringing a greeting
from the Cuban people," the bearded Cuban
leader told President )ose Lopez Portillo as he ar
rived at this tourist island in the Mexican Carib
bean.
It was his first visit to Mexico since he launched
the Cuban revolution from the nearby Mexican
Gulf Coast in 1956.
Castro and Portillo scheduled meetings yester
day and today that aides said would cover "a wide
range of topics." Although spokesmen said there
was no prepared agenda, the sale of Mexican oil to
Cuba and steps to improve the island nation's
trade deficit with its staunch ally are expected to
be among the major items discussed.
Portillo praised Castro in an airport ceremony,
referring to his revolutionary rise to power as a
"virtuous challenge."
Mexico was the only member of the Organiza
tion of American States that refused to sever dip
lomatic relations with the Havana government
after Castro overthrew Cuban Dictator Lulgencio
Batista on New Year's Day 1959 and installed a
pro-Soviet government.

Brown opposes UC nukes
San Francisco — Gov. )erry Brown said yesterday
he will urge the University of California Board of
Regents to sever its ties with nuclear weapons
research.
Arriving at a regents committee meeting, Brown
said the university's Lawrence Livermore Laborat
ory should discontinue nuclear weapons re
search, and spend its time on peaceful pursuits
such as energy research.
He said the university should also sever its ties
with the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories in New
Mexico, and let an appropriate federal agency
supervise its continued nuclear weapons de
velopment program.
The university runs the laboratories under a $3.5
million contract with the U.S. Department of
Energy. Every major nuclear weapon in the na
tion's arsenal, including the atomic, hydrogen and
neutron bombs, has been developed in the labs.
Brown's comments were cheered by about two
dozen anti-nuclear demonstrators who picketed
the building where the regents committee was
being held.
"I believe the time has come for the university to
terminate its relationship with the weapons
laboratory," Brown said. "I believe that the Liver
more Laboratory should be retained inside the
university as a non-weapons laboratory involved
in energy and other peaceful purposes and that
the nuclear weapons program should be located at
the New Mexico plant and should be under an
appropriate federal authority."
Hair dryers to be repaired
Washington — Under government pressure, the
hair dryer industry said yesterday it will offer free
repairs or replacements to millions of consumers
owning hair dryers which contain asbestos.
The plans presented to the Consumer Product
Safety Commission came from the 11 manufactur
ers and retailers of hairdryers that the agency staff
had said presented an unreasonable cancer risk to
consumers.
The staff recommended acceptance of the
plans, a step that would eliminate the possibility of
commission legal action against the companies
"There's been such worry on the part of con
sumers. Our main worry is to alleviate that,"
commission head Susan King said.
She said "a vast number of consumers" have
called or written the agency to ask if their hair
dryers contain asbestos, which has been found to
cause cancer if breathed by humans.
The agency staff has estimated the number ol
asbestos-containing hand-held hair dryers at 12.5
million.
Hayakawa statement blasted
Los Angeles — U.S. Senator S.I. Hayakawa was
sharply criticized yesterday by many California of

ficials and Japanese-Americans for saying the poor
do not need gas because they don't have jobs.
The reactions, which came in response to the
Republican's statement Wednesday, ranged from
surprise and rage to embarrassment.
Hayakawa issued a statement yesterday saying
he still supports elimination of gas ceiling prices, a
move he predicted would result in $2 to $3 per
gallon gas prices that might discourage the poor
from filling up.
"I have geen accused of being indifferent to the
poorbecause I said the poordon't need gasoline,"
the statement said.
"The genuinely poor don't need it because most
of them can't afford to own a car. Many do not
have jobs, and few of the unemployed poor drive
to work. They are a very small part of the gasoline
problem in California."
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley said he was
shocked, adding, "I find it incredible that state
ment was made by a responsible public official."
Tom Hayden, leader of the Santa Monica-based
Campaign lor Economic Democracy, said
Hayakawa's statement shows he is "hopelessly out
of touch with the way of life in California. He
reminds me of Marie Antoinette when she told the
rebellious French to eat cake."
White jury continues deliberations
San Francisco — The Dan White jury ended its
second day of deliberations yesterday without
reaching a verdi( t in the emotion-charged murder
case and broke off its sessions for the night.
The panel will resume this morning after having
deliberated a total of 15 hours since receiving the
case Wednesday morning.
White is charged with murdering MayorCeorge
Mosconeand Supervisor Harvey Milk last Nov. 27.
The jurors had asked Superior Court Judge Wal
ter Calcagno to repeat the legal definitions of first
degree murder, second degree murder and man
slaughter.
During the afternoon deliberations, the jury
sent a note to the judge asking for the legal defini
tion of malice, a requirement for a first or second
degree murder conviction.
The judge told jurors that malice constitutes
base anti-social behavior and an awareness that
the act is unlawful, as well as the inability to exer
cise control.
The jury also asked lor a definition of base and
anti-social behavior. Calcagno said there was no
specific legal definition but indicated "base" is
generally construed as "low moral character.
'Anti-social' is something against society."
Prosecutor Tom Norman has asked for a convic
tion of first degree murder which could result in
the death penalty.
White's attorney, Doug Schmidt, admits the
former supervisor tired the tatal shots. Schmidt
has asked tora conviction of voluntary manslaugh
ter, which could result in a prison term ranging
from about four to eight years.
