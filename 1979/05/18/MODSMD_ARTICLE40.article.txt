# Lessley elected new 'Daily' editor
## 
### 
The voters came out of the
woodwork yesterday, and
when it was all over, Managing
Editor Sara Lessley, a junior
communication major, was
declared editor of Daily Vol
ume 176, to start Sept. 24.
Lessley, a knee-jerk liberal
by her hometown standards,
defeated knee-jerk liberal (by
anyone's standards) Brad
Brockbank in a hotly contested
race which saw the highest
percentage of voter turnout in
recent Daily history.
Lessley said she would move
swiftly to institute her program
for the paper. "The last female
editor gave us a neo-fascist
flag; the one before that got us
searched by police. My im
provements will be a lot less
dramatic," she said.
Weeping with happiness,
Lessley, an Orange County na
tive, told her supporters after
the results were announced, "I
promise to be the best female
editor in the last two years."
"Sara is a true credit to her
county," said one staffer after
the results were announced.
"Besides, she's a Crade-A,
ASSU-approved editor. How
can we lose?"
Another staffer commented,
"Well, she's better than a lot of
things to come out of Orange
County, but I'll go no further."
Lessley said she thought her
background as editor of the El
Mondena High School year
book, The Encena, was an im
portant factor in her victory. In
addition, she said she might
use some experience gained in
her capacity as a beat reporter,
copy editor, news editor and
managing editor of the Daily.
She added that the tacts that
she is from the home of Dis
neyland, crooked politicians
and Proposition 6 should not
be held against her.
An anonymous staffer ag
reed, but added, "I don't care
where she's from, but I'm con
cerned that anyone with a Cal
weenie boyfriend is running
the paper — especially in fall
volume. Next thing you know
she'll be turning over bluep

rints of The Axe security system
to that guy. I can't bear to think
about it."
Another staffer disagreed,
however, saying Sara could be
trusted. "Considering the
weenie influence that per
vades her very existence, she
doesn't have bad news judg
ment."
Yet another staffer, the only

one who did not vote in the
election, commented, "Sara
who?"
On a more serious note,
Lessley said, "We plan to in
crease cooperation and com
munication within the Daily it
self while continuing to in
crease our sensitivity to the
concerns of all segments of the
community.
"We hope to build on the
foundations laid this volume to
recruit a solid core of en
thusiastic new staffers and
make the Daily an even better
product."
Lessley announced that
political science junior Randy
David will hold the number
two editorial position, manag
ing editor.
David, a Las Vegas native,
said he is gambling on a suc
cessful new staff recruitment
drive to insure the volume's
success.
