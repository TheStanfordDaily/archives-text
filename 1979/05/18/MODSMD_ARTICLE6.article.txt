# Brown spurns Curb's order

Sacramento (AP) — Saying it wasn't a valid order in the
first place, Gov. lerry Brown refused yesterday to re
scind Lt. Gov. Mike Curb's executive order to increase
the lead content in gasoline sold in California.
Before a University of California Regents' meeting in
San Francisco, Brown said: "As a matter of fact, it was
signed while I was in the air over California so it was
invalid."
Bobbie Metzger, the Democratic governor's press
secretary, added about the order Curb signed while
Brown was at a White House meeting: "The governor is
not going to dignify the order by a recision."
She repeated arguments in a suit Brown filed against
Curb after the Republican lieutenant governor attemp
ted to name an appellate judge in Brown's absence on a
previous trip to Washington. She added that Brown be
lieves Curb's executive order Wednesday "is meaning
less" because there was no emergency to justify action.
Meanwhile, the state Senate, by lopsided margins,
passed two bills Wednesday which would adopt essen
tially the same regulations as the Curb resolution.
Curb said California could increase the amount of
gasoline produced from each barrel of oil by 3 percent or
more by allowing refiners to add more lead and to
change the vapor pressure specifications—producing
enough gas to ease or even eliminate long lines at ser
vice stations.
It's not the first conflict between Brown and Curb

since California voters forced them into an uneasy
partnership last fall, when for the first time in this cen
tury they elected a governor and lieutenant governor
from different parties.
Citing a disputed section of the state Constitution,
Curb claims to have full powers of governor any time
Brown steps foot outside the state, something the 41-
year-old governor is doing with increasing frequency as
he lays the foundation for an expected campaign for the
Democratic nomination for president next year.
The effects of the dispute have sometimes been
comic—Curb racing Wednesday at 90 miles an hour to
file his order before Brown's plane returned, and Brown
asking the state Supreme Court to rule that he is not
absent when he leaves the state.
But that comic quality masks the seriousness of the
dispute between California's top two elected officials
and the high political stakes involved.
Brown's suit asks the court to strip Curb of all powers
as acting governor except in emergencies. If Brown pre
vails, that would free him to tour the nation and cam
paign for president without fear of what Curb might do.
A spokesman for Curb, George Armstrong, said Curb
believes his order is still valid.
Curb issued a statement calling Brown's action "un
fortunate ... he has lost sight of the real issue, which is
how can we get more gasoline to the people whose lives
are being disrupted by the current crisis."
