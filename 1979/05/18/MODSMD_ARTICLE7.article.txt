# Banks blasts bias against native Americans
## 
### Karen Veninga 
The goal of the American Indian Movement (AIM) is to
"draw attention to the condition" and "feelings of In
dian people" who lack control over their own destiny,
Dennis Banks, AIM co-founder said at Tresidder Union
Wednesday night.
Banks said the "subtle" and "discrete" prejudice of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), educational institu
tions and American churches is "public enemy number
one" for native Americans and that the bias is a target
area for necessary change. Banks also denounced the
media, which he said "has failed to give Indians a
chance."
Banks and his organization want to communicate the
"gut feelings" that native Americans experience when
they watch the portrayal of native Americans in "grade
B" western movies. Banks wants native Americans "to
be proud of who we are."
Banks said native Americans have lost 90 million acres
of land since the federal government became their trus
tee, and "nobody needs that kind of trustee."
He maintained that the BIA was set up to protect the
land, water, mineral and air rights of native Americans
and claimed that the agency has not done its job.
Hotly criticizing the strip mining of coal and uranium
mining by corporations such as Gulf and Peabody Coal
on reservation lands, Banks said that the mining has had
a "devastating impact on the lives of Indian people."

Banks said that he has seen people come onto native
American lands and pollute streams, cut down timber
and leave beer cans and radioactive waste.
Native Americans have no control over their land,
Banks claimed, and "not one Indian" controls agree
ments written between the corporations that have min
ing operations on native American land.
Instead, Banks continued, these agreements are
supervised by the Bureau of Land Management, which
controls policies on native American lands.
Banks feels that native Americans should have control
over their educational institutions. He said textbooks in
American schools have not portrayed native Americans
fairly and that American educators should change both
their attitudes and those in the textbooks that they use.
At one point in his remarks Banks asked the audience,
"Am I to believe that white people are no good because
they killed a lot of Indian people? I don't have the right
or authority to do that."
In Banks' opinion, both the churches and the schools
have worked against native Americans. Native Ameri
cans embrace religions "because we believe in spiritual
ity and in religions," but churches in their turn have not
been receptive to the Indians, he charged.
Banks also spoke out against Indian stereotypes, argu
ing that he had never met a "savage, a hostile, or a
marauding Indian."
The media has distorted history and the beliefs of

native Americans, Banks asserted. He said he asked the
major television networks if he could tape their broad
casts for his survey of the portrayal of native Americans
on television and in films.
His request was refused, but he is taping the
shows anyway, even though such action is illegal. Banks
said: "I don't believe I can be convicted by any court in
this country because of what the media has done to the
Indian people."
Banks, who is currently teaching a class here entitled
"Native American Destiny: Who Controls It?" has as
signed his class to watch television in shifts day and night
to see first-hand the media's portrayal of native Ameri
cans. He wants his students to feel ashamed about the
movies, he said.
Banks reiterated that though he can not point at any
one and say that they are responsible for the destiny of
native Americans, he believes that at this time native
Americans themselves do not control it.
AIM wants to unify native Americans and help them
when they are in trouble, he said. Founded in July, 1968
in Minneapolis, Minnesota in response to "abuses of the
police power" there, AIM has grown rapidly and now
has chapters across the country.
Approving of AlM's loose structure, Banks said,
"Membership cards can't make a movement—a move
ment comes from the heart of people who are struggl
ing."

American lands and pollute streams, cut down timber
and leave beer cans and radioactive waste.
Native Americans have no control over their land,
Banks claimed, and "not one Indian" controls agree
ments written between the corporations that have min
ing operations on native American land.
Instead, Banks continued, these agreements are
supervised by the Bureau of Land Management, which
controls policies on native American lands.
Banks feels that native Americans should have control
over their educational institutions. He said textbooks in
American schools have not portrayed native Americans
fairly and that American educators should change both
their attitudes and those in the textbooks that they use.
At one point in his remarks Banks asked the audience,
"Am I to believe that white people are no good because
they killed a lot of Indian people? I don't have the right
or authority to do that."
In Banks' opinion, both the churches and the schools
have worked against native Americans. Native Ameri
cans embrace religions "because we believe in spiritual
ity and in religions," but churches in their turn have not
been receptive to the Indians, he charged.
Banks also spoke out against Indian stereotypes, argu
ing that he had never met a "savage, a hostile, or a
marauding Indian."
The media has distorted history and the beliefs of

native Americans, Banks asserted. He said he asked the
major television networks if he could tape their broad
casts for his survey of the portrayal of native Americans
on television and in films.
His request was refused, but he is taping the
shows anyway, even though such action is illegal. Banks
said: "I don't believe I can be convicted by any court in
this country because of what the media has done to the
Indian people."
Banks, who is currently teaching a class here entitled
"Native American Destiny: Who Controls It?" has as
signed his class to watch television in shifts day and night
to see first-hand the media's portrayal of native Ameri
cans. He wants his students to feel ashamed about the
movies, he said.
Banks reiterated that though he can not point at any
one and say that they are responsible for the destiny of
native Americans, he believes that at this time native
Americans themselves do not control it.
AIM wants to unify native Americans and help them
when they are in trouble, he said. Founded in July, 1968
in Minneapolis, Minnesota in response to "abuses of the
police power" there, AIM has grown rapidly and now
has chapters across the country.
Approving of AlM's loose structure, Banks said,
"Membership cards can't make a movement—a move
ment comes from the heart of people who are struggl
ing."
