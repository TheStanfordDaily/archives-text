# The 						Dollies: From 'No dancing allowed' to 'All Right Now'

Vet, amid the flux of Stanford
tradition, there is one institu
tion which remains unbend
ing.
Every autumn five red-and
white-clad women can be seen
waving pompons and flashing
. their white teeth in the Stan
ford Stadium.
These "darling demoiselles
,>oi delightful dancing" are the
{Stanford Dollies.
i Since 1956, only 115 women
r.'have danced their way into

Stanford history as Dollies. Be
fore then, from 1942 to 1955,
female members of a Stanford
spirit group called the Rally
Committee (Rally Com) dres
sed up in white sweaters and
pleated skirts to wave red and
white pompons at football
games — dancing was prohi
bited.
Other rules restricted these
Rally Com pompon wavers.
According to a 1957 Stanford
Daily, these ladies were not al
lowed to, "prance, or kick or
turn." And hemlines, though
fashionably rising, were re
quired to fall below their

knees.
Prohibition of creeping hem
lines was rumored to have
been written in Jane Stanford's
will. The student body be
lieved the tale, said a former
pompon girl.
The hemline rumor and the
movement limitations went
unchallenged until 195b when
tive innovative and somewhat
precocious women lifted hem
lines one inch, changed their
traditional dress-color to red
and began choreographing
and dancing to the Stanford
Band's music.
They called themselves
Pompon Girls.
Margi Mix-Gould, Pompon
Girl of '57, remembers the
switch in dress and style. She
said the students were very
happy with the changes be
cause all the other schools in
this area already had dancing
pompon girls.
Somewhere between 1956
and 1961, the Pompon Girls
earned the nickname "dollies"
as a form of endearment.
"It didn't have a bad conno
tation at all," assured a 1961
Band member. In the later '60s,
the word "Pompon" dropped
entirely and the women be
came generally known as "Dol
lies." Even today, the records
in the Athletic Department and
at ASSU officially refer to the
group as the Pompon Dollies.
In 1956, the Pompon Girls
were strictly campus-oriented.
They went to Band practices
and football games, but did not
perform at alumni meetings or
other functions as the Dollies
do now, Mix-Gould said.
She also estimated that her

group put in about 30 hours a
week, and by the end of the
season, had choreographed
between 12 and 20 routines.
Now, 23 years later, Dollies
find the time commitment
even more rigorous.
"Between 40 and 45 hours
per week is devoted to Dollie
activities during fall quarter,
and between 20 and 30 hours
per week during winter and
spring," one of this year's Dol
lies said.
In addition, they return to
Stanford in late August for an
intensive training period. Prac
tices last anywhere from 10 to
16 hours a day, many days be
ginning at 8 a.m. and lasting
until midnight. •
During this summer month,
they brush up on old routines,
choreograph and learn new
routines and prepare for the
first home football game.
Throughout the rest of their
season, they perform at all
home football and basketball
games, make appearances at
breakfasts, luncheons and
special athletic events and
danceat rallies foralumni, high
schools and local businesses.
Dollies spend a large amount
of time practicing, according to
a current Dollie. Fall quarter
practices are 4Vi hours per day
plus evenings. They try to
create, learn and perfect four
to five new routines a week,
she added.
By the end of the year, the
Dollies have a repertoire of
about 50 dances.
In comparison, the USC
Pompon Girls practice about
two afternoons a week for
three hours and again with the
Trojan Band prior to each
game, said USC Pompon
Coach Lindley Bothwell.
"Do anymore than that and
you get a bunch of
deadheads," he said.
Bothwell, the USC coach of
40 years, added that the girls
know about 20 routines at the
end of the year, even though
they perform only 12 of them
regularly.
Unlike the stable USC im
age, the Dollie image has fluc
tuated throughout the years.
Some say that feelings to
ward the Dollies reflect the
times; others contend that
each group creates its own im
age.
A 1961 Band member, Frank
Robertson, remembers Pom
pon Dollies then as being wor
shiped as goddesses.

By 1967 the Dollies were no
longer viewed as women to be
worshiped but rather as, "plas
tic, painted-faced, empty
headed, haughty women who
were very attractive and
treated men badly," said a '67
Band member.
General feelings toward the
Dollies changed again in 1971.
Doug Single, associate alhle
tic director and '71 Rose Bowl
player, said he thinks that the
overall attitude toward the Dol
lies is very much dependent on
how good the football team is.
"If the team is good then the
Dollies are carried along,"
Single said.
Yet, no matter what the im
age, good or otherwise, the
Dollies remain a visible Stan
ford tradition which brings
color and entertainment to
many different events.
The 24th group of Dollies will
join this tradition when they
kick off their year by debuting
at Splendor on the Grass to
morrow.
