Coordinators' note:
This is the issue of the Daily
which is put out annually by
first-year staffers. We have
tried to do some innovative
things and to give a fresh look
to the Daily. Though sup
posedly done "without aid or
obstruction" from the more
senior staffers, it is Daily tradi
tion that they do their best to
sabotage the issue. The year's
new staff endured immature
antics, missing typewriter
parts and crank phone calls,
and otherwise withstood this
baptism of fire to bring this
Daily to you.
