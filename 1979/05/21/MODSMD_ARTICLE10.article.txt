## Concepts of freedom differ internationally 
### 
Nations today debate which
among them most embodies
freedom. They might as well
ask whether the elephant is
more like a wall, a snake, a tree
or a rope.
Since no country today is
more than a few centuries into
modernity, surely none can
claim a significantly better pos
ition than the proverbial six
blind men; each limited to
touching but one part of the
huge animal.
The United States figures
near the top of any impartial
observer's list, as befits the ear
liest and wealthiest liberal re
public. But there are also many
freedoms undreamt of even in
its philosophy.
Some are of strictly limited
interest, like a Navajo's free

dom to grow up according to
his people's traditions. Others
form part of cultural patterns
too alien for most Americans to
begin to understand, like Mos
lem ideas of political freedom
within Islam.
To come up with a kind of
freedom that is at once interest
ing, challenging and com
prehensible to Americans, one
must range culturally closer to
home — go, say, to Europe.
There, it becomes perfectly
evident that even among char
ter members of the supposedly
freedom-loving West, there is
no consensus about precisely
what freedom to love.
Government ignored
In contrast to Americans,
who typically define freedom
as minimal government, Sici

lians believe freedom to consist
in spontaneous participation
in family and local comihunity;
hence, they ignore government
altogether.
On the other hand, Germans
conceive freedom to be inhe
rent in obedience to the law,
which assigns to each his place
and ensure that no one will en
croach on another.
What has this to do with the
American view of freedom? In
fact, one concept is the Ameri
can view's elder brother, the
other its younger.
Particularism of the Sicilian
kind lay behind much of resis
tance to central government at
t he time of the Magna Carta, the
Glorious Revolution, and the
American colonies' secession
from England, when liberalism

was shaped.
Views differ
Just as the Anglo-American
view goes beyond the Sicilian,
the German view goes beyond
the Anglo-American.
Because no Italian govern
ment ever had enough power
really to challenge the tradi
tional Sicilian freedoms, Sici
lians never systematically con
sidered the relation between
government and their notion of
freedom. That notion con
sequently provides a more li
mited, less comprehensive
guide to action than liberalism.
Similarly, class divisions
and the concentration of power
outside of government — in
society itself — never posed
obstacles to liberty in the Un
ited States as they did in

Europe. Americans accord
ingly never had to go beyond
liberalism to systematic con
sideration of the relation bet
ween freedom and economics
and culture.
But Continental reformers,
seeking to follow the example
of the American Revolution,
found that changing govern
ments would not be enough.
Unlike America where, in the
absence of government, power
lapsed into the hands of free
men, in Europe it fell to men
oppressed for generations,
and profoundly corrupted by
that oppression.
Strong government
Under this weight, minimal
government in the American
plan was incapable of effecting
even basic democratic and
capitalist reforms. Since men
were not free due to social
rigidities, a strong activist gov
ernment was considered
necessary to fight those
rigidities in order truly to free
men.
Liberation replaced liberty
as many reformers' main objec
tive. Reformers chose to pur- 1
sue freedom-in-the-future,
realized through the exercise of
government, rather than pro
ject freedom now from gov
ernment's encroachment.
Germany inherited this trad
ition of thought directly,
through its philosophers Kant,
Hegel, Marx and Nietzsche.
Their works, which include
some of the unquestioned
summits of human achieve
ment, have this in common:
they center on the problematics
of freedom within society.
Who dares call them wrong?
Is freedom more like Sicilian
spontaneity, Anglo-American
liberty or Continental libera
tion? Or are we all like the six
men in the proverb — too blind
to see we all need to learn from
each other?
