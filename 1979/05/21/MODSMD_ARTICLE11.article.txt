The woes of econ
Only an econ major, huh?
Sure I'm only an econ major —
along with most of the Band
and the football team. I'm sick
to death of pre-meds bemoan
ing their lot, claiming we
"fuzzy studies" have it easy.
Easy? I took Math 41 at 8 a.m.
with Sunseri along with the
rest of you red-hot pre-meds.
Just because I happened to fail
it does not distinguish me as an
"econ major." I couldn't justify
losing precious sleep time
simply to pass a five-unit class.
Just because my Chem 31 TA
graded me on an easier scale
than my cutthroat classmates
does not mean he was condes
cending toward social sci
ences. Even if I wasn't exemp
ted from Freshman English
along with the rest of you, I got
an A each year I completed
"Literature of Science Fiction"
at Beaverton High School.
Sure, I'll never have to take
Physics or P-chem. But only an
econ major can grasp the
horror of a two-hour Econ 90
Accounting final; frantically
ripping through a giant corpo
ration's financial statements,
pausing for breath only to hear
an econ graduate student walk
ing his dog in the Quad, sing
ing "Nobody seed de trouble 1
seen."
Sure the class taught me to
read financial statements —
just in time to inform Dad his
corporation was folding.
Do you pre-meds have any
idea how depressing it is to

major in something called the
"dismal science?" How heart
rending it is to master two
quarters of micro and macro
theory only to discover in your
third quarter that they bear no
relation to the real world?
How disillusioning it is to
hear your Marxist professor de
stroy the foundations of your
capitalist professor's teaching?
How humiliating it is to learn
that you are only worth to your
mother the wage rate she gave
up because you are a time
intensive good?
At least you pre-meds have
something to look forward to
when you graduate — medical
school and a gratifying lifetime
spent serving your fellow man.
What have we econ majors to
look forward to but recession,
inflation, unemployment and
government interference?
Econ is no mick. It takes guts to
major in something as pes
simistic as it is worthless.

Audience inane
Last night I attended the
Tournee of Animation in
Memorial Auditorium. As this
was to be the only South Bay
showing of this program, I was
anxiously looking forward to it
and planned my weekend with
that in mind.
It was a warm evening, and
the stuffy auditorium had a
good sized crowd for the sec
ond show. I was happy to see
that so many people were in

terested in animation. "Maybe
things are picking up for inde
pendent cinema appreciation,"
I thought out loud to my friend.
As the lights dimmed, how
ever, 1 realized the folly of my
wishful thinking.
All right, so it was a hot,
Sunday night after a beautiful
spring weekend, even this
cannot rationalize the inane
and adolescent behavior of an
audience that I was embarras
sed to be a part of. Throughout
a program of some of the most
innovative and charming ani
mation shorts 1 have seen, sh
outs of "Roadrunner!" "I want
to see a cartoon," and"I want
my dollar back," filled the
room, making it difficult to
hear and impossible to fully
appreciate.
Rowdy is putting it mildly:
The audience sounded like a
bunch of grammar school kids
at their first matinee away from
mommy and daddy. These, the
illustrious chosen few, Stan
ford's up and coming, showed
us their real stuff last night,
making it so unpleasant that I
left before the program was
over.
I suppose the "quest for ex
cellence" refers only to sports
at this University, but then it
always was difficult to get
through thick skulls with any
thing but aggressive competi
tion. Obviously, these nean
derthals must have confused
the theater with the playing
field (or beer hall) and were
exhibiting their quaint native
behaviors for our edification.

Well, you can have it guys.
From now on, I'm sticking to
public theaters where it is still
possible to find intelligent
forms of life.

Soap-bubble fight
Once again David Miller
("Basic Tax Reform Needed,"
Daily, May 14) has trotted out
on his soap-bubble Bucephalus
in true and shining form to
fights the murky evils of the good
ol' U.S. of A. with his own
blend of vapid political
analysis.
Miller pontificates for the
first half of his column. "It is
increasingly obvious," he
writes, "that government has
failed." Failed at what? At
"making war and inflating the
money supply," if one refers to
the preceding paragraph; I
doubt that this is what he means.
If he suggests that our state is
anarchy, I question him.
Miller doesn't even reveal an
understanding of what a gov
ernment is. It's not the "social
institution which possesses an
effective monopoly on the con
trol of the use of force;" it may
be the instrument of that force,
but as an entity, unsupported
by its citizenry, it has essen
tially no power at all and no
control over anything. By
separating the specter of "gov
ernment" from the society with
which it is symbiotically en
tangled, Miller allows himself
the useless luxury of attacking

his own flawed myth.
It's fitting enough that Miller
chooses to quote that master of
the aphorism, Mao Tse-Tung,
noting that "in the final
analysis, the late Chinese
leader . . . said, political power
grows out of the barrel of a
gun." But all political power
does not arise solely from the
threat of violence; I don't sup
port this society just for my
own protection. Mao referred
to international power, not Mil
ler's subject.
It's not enough, though, for
Miller to call to his side the
name of Mao; with one sen
tence he marshalls the support
of an entire nation, claiming
that "most Americans realize
that government has far over
stepped its moral and political
limits." As it stands, that may
be true (what do you think?),
but it's irrelevant — those
limits are in about 60 million
directions.
It is unfortunate when a
forum for serious thought de
teriorates to this level. Does
this paper have any editors, or
are they too busy to read before
they print?

Soap-bubble fight
Once again David Miller
("Basic Tax Reform Needed,"
Daily, May 14) has trotted out
on his soap-bubble Bucephalus
in true and shining form to
fights the murky evils of the good
ol' U.S. of A. with his own
blend of vapid political
analysis.
Miller pontificates for the
first half of his column. "It is
increasingly obvious," he
writes, "that government has
failed." Failed at what? At
"making war and inflating the
money supply," if one refers to
the preceding paragraph; I
doubt that this is what he means.
If he suggests that our state is
anarchy, I question him.
Miller doesn't even reveal an
understanding of what a gov
ernment is. It's not the "social
institution which possesses an
effective monopoly on the con
trol of the use of force;" it may
be the instrument of that force,
but as an entity, unsupported
by its citizenry, it has essen
tially no power at all and no
control over anything. By
separating the specter of "gov
ernment" from the society with
which it is symbiotically en
tangled, Miller allows himself
the useless luxury of attacking

his own flawed myth.
It's fitting enough that Miller
chooses to quote that master of
the aphorism, Mao Tse-Tung,
noting that "in the final
analysis, the late Chinese
leader . . . said, political power
grows out of the barrel of a
gun." But all political power
does not arise solely from the
threat of violence; I don't sup
port this society just for my
own protection. Mao referred
to international power, not Mil
ler's subject.
It's not enough, though, for
Miller to call to his side the
name of Mao; with one sen
tence he marshalls the support
of an entire nation, claiming
that "most Americans realize
that government has far over
stepped its moral and political
limits." As it stands, that may
be true (what do you think?),
but it's irrelevant — those
limits are in about 60 million
directions.
It is unfortunate when a
forum for serious thought de
teriorates to this level. Does
this paper have any editors, or
are they too busy to read before
they print?

The woes of econ
Only an econ major, huh?
Sure I'm only an econ major —
along with most of the Band
and the football team. I'm sick
to death of pre-meds bemoan
ing their lot, claiming we
"fuzzy studies" have it easy.
Easy? I took Math 41 at 8 a.m.
with Sunseri along with the
rest of you red-hot pre-meds.
Just because I happened to fail
it does not distinguish me as an
"econ major." I couldn't justify
losing precious sleep time
simply to pass a five-unit class.
Just because my Chem 31 TA
graded me on an easier scale
than my cutthroat classmates
does not mean he was condes
cending toward social sci
ences. Even if I wasn't exemp
ted from Freshman English
along with the rest of you, I got
an A each year I completed
"Literature of Science Fiction"
at Beaverton High School.
Sure, I'll never have to take
Physics or P-chem. But only an
econ major can grasp the
horror of a two-hour Econ 90
Accounting final; frantically
ripping through a giant corpo
ration's financial statements,
pausing for breath only to hear
an econ graduate student walk
ing his dog in the Quad, sing
ing "Nobody seed de trouble 1
seen."
Sure the class taught me to
read financial statements —
just in time to inform Dad his
corporation was folding.
Do you pre-meds have any
idea how depressing it is to

major in something called the
"dismal science?" How heart
rending it is to master two
quarters of micro and macro
theory only to discover in your
third quarter that they bear no
relation to the real world?
How disillusioning it is to
hear your Marxist professor de
stroy the foundations of your
capitalist professor's teaching?
How humiliating it is to learn
that you are only worth to your
mother the wage rate she gave
up because you are a time
intensive good?
At least you pre-meds have
something to look forward to
when you graduate — medical
school and a gratifying lifetime
spent serving your fellow man.
What have we econ majors to
look forward to but recession,
inflation, unemployment and
government interference?
Econ is no mick. It takes guts to
major in something as pes
simistic as it is worthless.

Audience inane
Last night I attended the
Tournee of Animation in
Memorial Auditorium. As this
was to be the only South Bay
showing of this program, I was
anxiously looking forward to it
and planned my weekend with
that in mind.
It was a warm evening, and
the stuffy auditorium had a
good sized crowd for the sec
ond show. I was happy to see
that so many people were in

terested in animation. "Maybe
things are picking up for inde
pendent cinema appreciation,"
I thought out loud to my friend.
As the lights dimmed, how
ever, 1 realized the folly of my
wishful thinking.
All right, so it was a hot,
Sunday night after a beautiful
spring weekend, even this
cannot rationalize the inane
and adolescent behavior of an
audience that I was embarras
sed to be a part of. Throughout
a program of some of the most
innovative and charming ani
mation shorts 1 have seen, sh
outs of "Roadrunner!" "I want
to see a cartoon," and"I want
my dollar back," filled the
room, making it difficult to
hear and impossible to fully
appreciate.
Rowdy is putting it mildly:
The audience sounded like a
bunch of grammar school kids
at their first matinee away from
mommy and daddy. These, the
illustrious chosen few, Stan
ford's up and coming, showed
us their real stuff last night,
making it so unpleasant that I
left before the program was
over.
I suppose the "quest for ex
cellence" refers only to sports
at this University, but then it
always was difficult to get
through thick skulls with any
thing but aggressive competi
tion. Obviously, these nean
derthals must have confused
the theater with the playing
field (or beer hall) and were
exhibiting their quaint native
behaviors for our edification.

Well, you can have it guys.
From now on, I'm sticking to
public theaters where it is still
possible to find intelligent
forms of life.
