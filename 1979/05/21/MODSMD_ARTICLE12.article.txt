# Hargadon answers his fan and hate letters alike
## 
### David Frank 
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions, Fred Hargadon,
writes so many letters on the
job that he admits his personal
correspondence suffers
greatly.
Amid the processing of
thousands of applications
every year, Hargadon finds the
variety of mail crossing his
desk the most enjoyable part of
his job. He personally answers
all unsolicited correspondence
crossing his desk.
In the time after the letters of
admission are sent out to the
new freshman class in early
April, Hargadon's office re
ceives a total of up to 50 letters
per day.
In the weeks following the
mailing of acceptance and re
jection letters, the Admissions
Office receives many letters
from anxious parents.

"The majority of these pa
rents are upset because they
can't understand how their son
or daughter — who is fre
quently an outstanding candi
date — has failed to get admit
ted. This doesn't bother me. 1
can understand why they are
upset," said Hargadon.
'Upset letters'
In answering the "upset let
ters," Hargadon tries to explain
to the parents — as he and his
staff try to explain in the letters
of rejection — that their son or
daughter was not turned down
for anything faulty about his or
her record or personality.
Sometimes he points to the
overwhelming statistics of the
group of applicants.
To the father who couldn't
understand why his son with a
GPA of 3.8 didn't get admitted,
Hargadon pointed out that sev
eral hundred other applicants

had GPAs of 3.8 or higher.
"While I don't mind the 'up
set' letters,"says Hargadon, "if
someone gets real nasty and
questions my parentage, well
that's another story. I've found
that the best thing to do after
receiving a nasty letter is to
write a nasty letter back." After
Hargadon writes a terse reply,
he usually receives an apologe
tic response.
Hargadon reserves a special
response for the one or two let
ters he receives each year that
he calls "particularly nasty."
Special response
Hargadon's replies will usu
ally read something like this:
"Dear -: I thought you
would like to know that some
one has written me a crank let
ter and signed your name to it.
Would you like me to help you
find out who this person is?"
"Oddly enough," said Har
gadon with a grin, "I never get
responses to letters like these.
But I sure have fun writing
them."
"Sometimes, we just think of
these things on the spur of the
moment to keep sane during
the times we are reading so
many applications and re
commendations," added Har
gadon.
'Ellis Island' of Stanford
In general, Hargadon said
that the Admissions Office
seems to be the "Ellis Island" of
the University's incoming
mail. "We get all sorts of mail
coming in bere from all kinds
of people all the time," he said.
He recalled a letter to the of
fice from a person asking if he

could arrange for a sex change
operation with the University.
"What happened is the person
probably read an article some
where about the operations
that the Medical Center per
forms and so the guy wrote us
for an answer. Don't ask me
why he wrote to this office.
"I'm always very tempted to
respond to a letter like that but
I'll always refer it to the proper
part of the University."
Among the letters Hargadon
personally answers are ones
from young students. One
seventh grade girl wrote him to
say she was on the honor roll in
her school and was also a
senator in the student govern
ment and played a musical in
strument. According to Harga
don, the girl said that she plan
ned to apply to Stanford in six
years and hoped she wouldn't
be in the "swim" — or reject —

pile of applications.
Other high school students
who aren't admitted often
write to say that the students
who were accepted from their
school are really outstanding
and deserve to be admitted.
"We really appreciate those let
ters. They really make the Ad
missions staff feel good," said
Hargadon.
Several weeks ago Hargadon
received a letter from a woman
enrolled here in the early
19205. When she entered
school, an applicant had to
have proof of innoculation
against certain diseases. Har
gadon said she wanted to know
why the Unitersity had that re
quirement then.
"Oh, I'll try to find the ans
wer," said Hargadon with a
chuckle. "I haven't found it yet;
it may take a while. But I'll
answer her."
