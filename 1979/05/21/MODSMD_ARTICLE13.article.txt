# Boycott pressure muted at University
## 
### Brad Crystal 
"Boycott Grapes!" "Boycott
lettuce!" Such were the cries of
many student activists just a
few years ago.
Today at the University the
battle cries against buying
non-UFW (United Farm Work
ers) produce have diminished
to less than a dull roar.
According to University
Food Service manager Maxine
Anderson, there have been "a
couple of phone calls asking
information" about University
buying policy in recent weeks.
"We buy whatever our
buyers sell us" regardless of
whether the produce is UFW or
non-UFW, said Anderson. She
added that of the 200 crates of
lettuce the University buys
each month she "really doesn't
know" how much is UFW. "We
don't dictate to the source who
to buy its food from."
Food Service 'neutral'
Asked whether she thought
the University ought to have
any moral position in deter
mining buying policy, Ander
son responded, "We remain
pretty neutral."

Coluxnbae House resident
Kayla Templin said that a
groundswell of student input
may be necessary to change
Food Service buying policies.
In addition to boycotting
non-unionized head lettuce
and Chiquita bananas,
Templin said that Columbae
refuses to buy Nestle's or Lib
by's products and substitutes a
fish called benita for tuna.
Substitutes
Boycotting non-union pro
duce or morally objectionable
corporate distributors "doesn't
require a major shift in eating
but a major awareness among
students," said Templin.
"There are lots of substitutes"
for boycotted foodstuffs, she
added. Other residences and
campus food vendors that
boycott certain products in
clude Terra, Synergy and the
Coffee House among others.
In Zapata, the Chicano theme
house, most of the residents are
boycotting non-UFW produce,
according to freshman Leah
Halper. Halper, a vegetarian,
said it has been especially dif
ficult for her to determine what
to eat.
