# Three experts here say
## Gas decontrol ineffective 
### Steve Neff 
President Jimmy Carter's re
cent move to decontrol domes
tic oil prices will not effec
tively provide for alternative
U.S. energy needs, according
to three experts here.
Domestic crude oil prices,
soon to rise to meet world mar
ket prices, will stimulate oil
companies to produce more
crude oil for increased profits.
However, University faculty
members, George Bach, Ed
ward Teller and Thomas
Moore, are concerned about ef
fects of oil decontrol on public
gasoline consumption, and

government policies aimed at
developing other energy
sources.
Oil deregulation will not
curb the American public's
voracious appetite forgasoline,
explained Bach, professor at
the Graduate School of Busi
ness.
"We are a plushy nation,"
said Bach, "and consumers
will pay the extra cost (of gas)."
Nevertheless, in the long run,
oil deregulation will have to af
fect consumer profligacy, he
said.
Teller, senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution, ad
dressed the issue of new oil
production incentives. Author
of a forthcoming book, Energy
from Heaven and Earth, Teller
said "the incentives of higher
prices will accelerate the de
velopment of alternative
energy sources (as well as oil)
more effectively than any ac
tion the government could
take."
Stabilize deficit?
Department of Energy (DOE)
officials speculate that in
creased oil production will
stabilize the U.S. $50 million
balance-of-payments deficit
with the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC).
Decontrol of oil as proposed
by the Carter administration
will affect U.S. oil production
and consumer habits and will
necessitate a tax directed
against increased oil industry
profits.
Carter's windfall profits tax
would take away 50 percent of
the oil companies' new profits,
and create an Energy Security
Trust Fund. Money in the fund
would be invested in the re
search and development of al
ternative energy resources.
Campus experts seem divided

on the value of thefund and the
tax.
Public distrust
"Carter had to include an ex
cess profits tax of some sort for
public acceptance," Bach
explained. To allow a price in
crease for oil, without some
kind of consumer compensa
tion would have been "impro
per and immoral," considering
public distrust of the oil giants,
said Bach.
Moore, director of the
Hoover Institution's domestic
studies program, voiced con
cern about the effects of Car
ter's tax.
He criticized the proposed
energy research fund as "es
sentially waste money. . . .
There's been a lot of money
thrown at solar energy, coal
and other alternatives. If it's
profitable to develop, private
industry will do so."
Future shock?
Decontrol will be inflatio
nary, Bach says, and the in
creased prices of gas will regis
ter at the pump, but the con
stricted oil supply could create
greater shock waves.
At the present time, "we aie
importing half of our oil, and
the real crisis will occur if
OPEC cuts off their supplies,"
Bach continues.
Most of the experts foresee
that alternative forms of
energy, especially coal, must
be considered. Although price
decontrol of oil is a step to
wards increasing U.S. pet
roleum supplies, it does not
take into consideration some
domestic "long-term" goals for
energy in the mad scramble for
crude, and Bach anticipates
that something "has got to
give."
