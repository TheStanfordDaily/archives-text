# Vendors satisfy student hunger, inspirit campus
## 
### Ellie Williams 
Tom and Maria Dallas, the
fruit vendors in White Plaza,
are quite a Stanford tradition.
They bring a little bit of Italy to
the campus, and a lot of "old
fashioned" values and beliefs.
To many students who
gather at their fruit stand, they
are surrogate grandparents and
revered philosophers.
Tom and Maria's calm, sweet
sincerity is magnetic; at their
stand one forgets the bustle of
the Bookstore a few yards
away.
Tom is cynical; "people were
more honest and caring in the
'old days,' " he says, before
people were rushing
everywhere and "zigzagging
around on the freeways."
Yet Maria is more optimistic.
"I love the students now," she
declares, "they have an im
pulse to be good."
Being happy with oneself is
the first step towards loving
others, Maria confides. She
loves hersel£,she says, because
while she has worked hard all
her life, she has always been
devoted to the spirit of "con
quistare" — to make beautiful.
I was always a success . . . ev
erything 1 do I do the best and
most enjoyable."
'Something beautiful'
While a young woman in
Rome she was such a respected
fashion designer that she re
ceived an important honorary

award, "La Grande Designer
della Monde." She enjoyed
dress designing because from a
"piece of nothing I was able to
make something beautiful."
Maria believes that she has
been a successful wife and
mother as well. She says she
remembers feeling like many of
her woman student friends
who do not want children be
cause they want to devote
themselves to their careers and
succeed in the business world.
But Maria says, she began to get
tired, and on a boat trip to
America she met Tom.
Tom had left his family and
Florence at 14 to work on boats
sailing to the United States.
After working as a cook on
these shi ps, he finally settled in
Boston when he was 18 to cook
in restaurants.
Mixture of people
After marrying Tom, Maria
settled in America. She adores
this country, she says, because
of its mixture of people — "it is
the infinite races that make
America so beautiful ... all of
this intelligence put together
creates something beautiful."
The Dallas' have lived in the
Bay Area for 30 years and say
that it is the "best place to live
in the world." They currently
live in an apartment in Foster
City. Both Tom and Maria glow
when they speak of their home,
enthusiastically gesturing to
convey how beautiful it is, and

how close they are to the water.
The Dallas' two sons live on
the Peninsula as well. One is a
pilot, the other is the president
of a bank in San Francisco.
"You cannot spoil a child,"
Maria asserts, and she has
given her children everything
from a Corvette on their 16th
birthday to the "best" educa
tion.
Tom was in the restaurant
business before he began sel
ling fruit at Stanford. He
owned two restaurants, one in
Palo Alto and the other in San
Francisco, both were quite suc
cessful, he said. Yet when he
suffered a heart attack his doc
tor advised him to change his
occupation.
Academic environment
As the restaur'ant in San
Francisco was located under
Hastings Law School, the Dal
las' had come to enjoy talking
and working with students.
Eager to continue working in
an academic environment,
they conceived of their job as
fruit sellers at Stanford.
Tom goes up to San Fran
cisco every morning to buy the
fruit, and each night he brings
back what they haven't sold.
"We don't have to do this,"
Maria declares, "but we want
quality."
While their job may appear
to be monotonous, Maria and
Tom rebel against boredom. "I
make my days interesting,"

Maria says. "In Italy that's the
way we want life to be ... if it's
not there we create it so that life
will be full of good stuff."
Secret of living
Too few people recognize
life's beauty, and make life in
teresting, Maria says."The sec
ret of living is to live every hour
of the day so you know what
you possess."
While Tom enjoys spending
time playing cards and

philosophizing, Maria plans
daily activities to make her life
interesting. Some days she
prepares dessert for La Casa
Italiana, other days she will
visit friends; but Maria's most
valuable activity, she says, is
helping others.
"It is a privilege to have so
many friends," Maria confides,
"and in old age you have only
one desire — to be wanted — in
this place we're wanted."
