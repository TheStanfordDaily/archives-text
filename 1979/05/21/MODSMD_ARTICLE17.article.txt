# Wine classes develop a sense of smells and hues
## 
### Mark Morodomi 
The wine taster is "more of a
detective than a sensitive
machine," according to Bruce
Cass, enologist and lecturer for
the ASSU Enology Club.
For seven years the Enology
Club has been presenting a
public lecture series on wine
appreciation. Classes are
taught by the Society of Wine
Educators, a widely acclaimed
international guild.
There is a difference between
trying different wines and true
wine tasting. Tasting requires
an often exhausting concentra
tion on a variety of flavors and
smells. According to Cass, the
pleasure of tasting stems from
this variety.
Cass said he tries to teach the
students some "tricks" to make
wine tasting more enjoyable.

They are told to "look at the
hue of the wine and check the
smell," said Cass. "Putting the
wine in your mouth is secon
dary to these two."
Cass explained that with a
little experience one can tell by
looking at a wine whether it
was stored in wood, and if it
has spoiled, as well as its grape
variety, age and sweetness.
Tasting techniques
"Smelling is by far the most
important technique, yet most
Americans are not taught to
appreciate this aspect in
wines." Cass said he instructs
students to "swirl the wine
aYound in the glass to expose
more of the wine's surface area
to the air. Then sniff deeply. It's
important to have a wine glass
with a rounded top and there
fore plenty of air space. The

more exposure you have in
wine, the more you look for in
complexity of smell."
Tasting sessions
For those who don't have the
time to take the eight week
courses, the Enology Club
sponsors individual blind tast
ing sessions Thursday nights
in Lagunita dining hall.
These economical exposures
to wine include a brief intro
duction concerning grape vari
ety followed by tastings of
eight mystery wines. At the
end of the evening each person
rates the wines and a group av
erage is computed. Wines such
as Cabernet, Sauvignon Blanc
and French Champagne are on
the remaining tasting calendar.
Costs range from $5 to $12 per
person.
Students learn sensory dis
crimination by tasting wines
with excess amounts of acids
and sugars. Though it is
initially difficult to describe
the wines on paper, students
use their imagination to ex
press their feelings about the
wines.
'Kissing a battleship'
Words such as hard, soft,
woody, grapey, sweet and sour
are common. One student de
scribed a wine as tasting like
"kissing a battleship." Some
smells are compared to saus
age, perfume and bell peppers.
Bread and cheese are available
at all tastings; the cheese
stimulates the taste buds while
the bread neutralizes the taste
of a previous wine.
Reference framework
Though aimed at the begin
ner, the Basic Tasting class is
also open to those who have
been drinking wine for years.
The emphasis of the class is on
building a framework of refer
ence and heightening the sen
sitivity of the taste buds.
California and European
wines priced from $2.50 to $13
a bottle are served for tasting.
