# Tut takeoff to open in June
## 
### Gayle Mayers 
The popularity of the Treasures of Tutankha
mun has inspired the chairman of the Art Dept.,
Prof. Lorenz Eitner, to organize a summer exhib
ition at the Stanford Art Gallery.
Tut treasures here? Not exactly. This exhibi
tion will be called "Tut-Tut."
Eitner said Tut-Tut, which opens June 26, will
focus attention on the commercial success of the
Tutankhamun treasures, presenting a display of
Tut-related products and the historical de
velopment of "Egyptomania."
"Never in the history of Egyptomania have
great works of art produced such a harvest of
commercial trash," Eitner said.
The new industry which has blossomed out of
the Tut craze has produced such innovations as
Tut whiskey bottles, Tut tie clips. "Tut-Tut
Tootsie" cookies and a poster of women lined up
in an Egyptian tableau, wearing ancient wings
and advertising nylon slips.
Public enthusiasm has not only made a com
mercial blockbluster out of the Boy King, but it
has also generated a tourist industry.
Last autumn, the Tutankhamun exhibition
generated $89.4 million for the city of New Or
leans from the combined income of museums,

motels, restaurants and taxes, Eitner said.
Another important aspect of the exhibition
will be examples of work to illustrate the history
of Egyptomania.
Eitner was emphatic in pointing to its present
sorry state.
To highlight this point, selections from the
work of the Italian printmaker Piranesi and the
French architect Desprez, who were both influ
enced by Egyptian art, will be exhibited.
Graphic records made by artists who accom
panied Napoleon in the Egyptian campaign of
1798-1799 will also be on display.
In the early 18295, Egyptian styles influenced
the design of American trade bazaars, insurance
companies and railway stations and public en
thusiasm was again aroused in 1922 when
Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered.
Eitner attributed public enthusiasm for the
Tutankhamun exhibition to a fascination for the
combination of death and riches.
He expressed concern that the exhibition may
be of dubious long run benefits to museums. The
success of the Tutankhamun exhibition has
raised public expectations of museums. Eitner
predicts that Egyptomania will be a hard act to
follow.
