# Take singles, doubles in AIAW
## Jordan, Moulton win The 						Daily Sports 
### Steve Pearson 
In an impressive display termed "just super" by coach Anne
Gould, Cardinal tennis players Kathy Jordan and Alycia Moulton
yesterday captured the top prizes in both singles and doubles at
the AIAW Regional Individual Championships in Pomona.
Jordan, a sophomore, upheld her top-seeding by claiming the
singles championship with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Moulton, her
freshman teammate. The two then went on to defeat Barbara
Hallquist and Sheila Mclnerney of USC 6-2, 6-4 for the doubles
title.
The rare double achievement by the Cardinal pair was indica
tive of Stanford's fine performance throughout the tournament.
In the third round of the singles, four Cardinals had victories to
advance to the round of 16s. Jordan defeated fellow Cardinal
Donna Rubin 6-1, 6-2. Moulton also advanced easily with a 6-2,
6-1 victory over Valerie Cates of Pepperdine. Susie Hagey, in her
final year of college competition for the Cardinals, had an impor
tant win over Lucy Gordon of UCLA, taking a tough three-setter
1-6,6-4, 6-3. And Stanford freshman Sue Rasmussen breezed past
Marianne Fornsted of Pepperdine 6-1, 6-1.
It was largely Stanford vs. Stanford in the round-of-16s as
Jordan faced Hagey while Moulton went up against Rasmussen.
Jordan and Moulton came out winners, and even though they

were the only Cardinals to reach the quarterfinals, their final
performance in the tourney served to underscore the excellent
efforts of the whole Cardinal team which had no singles losses
past the second round except to fellow teammates.
In the quarter and semi-finals Jordan had straight-set victories
over Ail-Americans Sheila Mclnerney of USC and Dana Gilbert of
UCLA to advance to the finals. Moulton had tougher matches
against Kathy O'Brien and Becky Bell of UCLA, but showed why
she was the number 2 seed, and went on to challenge Jordan in the

all-Stanford final, where Jor
dan won 6-6, 6-1.
The purpose of the regional
championships was to qualify
individual players for the na
tional championships in June.
Stanford's strong performance
will now enable it to send three
singles players and one dou
bles team: Jordan, Moulton and
Hagey in the singles; Jordan
and Moulton in the doubles.
With the individual qualify
ing over, the Cardinals must
quickly regain a sense of team
play for their next competition,
the AIAW team champion
ships, which begin June 4.
After suffering four losses this
year at the hands of USC and
UCLA, the Stanford players
seem to be reaching a peak, a
peak that they hope will carry
them to their second consecu
tive national title.
