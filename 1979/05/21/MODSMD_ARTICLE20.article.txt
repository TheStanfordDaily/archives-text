In an impressive display termed "just super" by coach Anne
Gould, Cardinal tennis players Kathy Jordan and Alycia Moulton
yesterday captured the top prizes in both singles and doubles at
the AIAW Regional Individual Championships in Pomona.
Jordan, a sophomore, upheld her top-seeding by claiming the
singles championship with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Moulton, her
freshman teammate. The two then went on to defeat Barbara
Hallquist and Sheila Mclnerney of USC 6-2, 6-4 for the doubles
title.
The rare double achievement by the Cardinal pair was indica
tive of Stanford's fine performance throughout the tournament.
In the third round of the singles, four Cardinals had victories to
advance to the round of 16s. Jordan defeated fellow Cardinal
Donna Rubin 6-1, 6-2. Moulton also advanced easily with a 6-2,
6-1 victory over Valerie Cates of Pepperdine. Susie Hagey, in her
final year of college competition for the Cardinals, had an impor
tant win over Lucy Gordon of UCLA, taking a tough three-setter
1-6,6-4, 6-3. And Stanford freshman Sue Rasmussen breezed past
Marianne Fornsted of Pepperdine 6-1, 6-1.
It was largely Stanford vs. Stanford in the round-of-16s as
Jordan faced Hagey while Moulton went up against Rasmussen.
Jordan and Moulton came out winners, and even though they
