# Weekend meets complete crew season
## 
### Gray Maxwell 
The 1979 racing season came to an end
for Stanford crew this weekend in regat
tas held at Redwood Shores and
Lexington Reservoir.
The Pac-10's were held at Redwood
Shores on Friday and Saturday amid
crowds, pleasant weather and electronic
gadgetry.
The Stanford women's novice eight
was a "victim" of the seeding system and
had to race top-ranked Washington in the
quarter finals. The Card women led for
600 meters in their best effort of the sea
son. The Huskies moved on Stanford in
the final 400, though, and squeezed out a
one-quarter length victory, with less than
one second separating the two shells.
Because of the loss to the Huskies, the
women could finish no higher than fifth

in a field of eight. The novice eight did
just that, by racing later on Friday and
beating Washington State by two lengths
of open water. They secured fifth place by
defeating Long Beach by two lengths of
open water on Saturday in the finals.
The Stanford women's open eight
raced in the varsity eight competition and
was defeated by Long Beach by one
length in the quarter finals. In the finals,
competing for fifth place, the eight was
defeated by USC by open water.
The men's JV eight was defeated in the
quarter finals by top-ranked and eventual
winner Washington. Racing for fifth
place in the finals, a Washington State
sprint carried the Cougars past the Cards.
WSU won the race by three quarters of a
length.
~ The featured event of the regatta was

the men's varsity (heavyweight) eight
competition. The Cardinals' quarter final
opponents were the Beavers from Oregon
State. OSU turned in the fastest time of
the quarter finals, clocking a 6:18.18 in
defeating Stanford by 2Vi lengths.
In the finals, Stanford rowed in a three
boat race for fifth place against UCLA and
USC. In a near repeat of the race at Marina
del Rey three weeks ago, a strong finish
ing sprint carried UCLA past Stanford but
the Cards defeated USC for the fourth
time this season to place sixth in the
event.
In the final, the Cal Bears asserted their
superiority over the reigning champion
Huskies by defeating them for the third
time this season. The Bears set a course
record and for their efforts were awarded
the Ky Ebright Challenge Cup, named

after the former Cal coach who led the
Bears for 35 years. The Huskies had pre
viously captured the Cup and the confer
ence title eight consecutive years.
The next stop for the Bears will not be
the IRA's, but the Henley Royal Regatta.
They are currently ranked with Yale and
Harvard as the nation's top collegiate
crews.
The other end-season regatta is the
Western Springs, held this year at
Lexington Reservoir in Los Gatos on
Saturday and Sunday.
The men's varsity eight waged a spec
tacular sprint despite the rough condi
tions and moved from fifth to third in the
closing 300 meters. The Cardinals pulled
up just three quarters of a length short of
passing San Diego State to win second
place. Irvine won the featured event.
