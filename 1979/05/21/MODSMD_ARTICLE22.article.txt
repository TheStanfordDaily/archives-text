knocked away by Seattles' Jack Sikma with two
seconds left.
On the inbounds, Wright got open under the
hoop, attempted a layup and was fouled by

the next two to win the game, much to the satis
faction of the Washington crowd.
The second game of the best-of-seven series
will be played at Washington's home court in
Landover, Maryland before the series moves to
