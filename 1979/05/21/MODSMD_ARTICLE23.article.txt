# Cardinal lacrosse teams successful

First attack. Second de
fense. First defense. Second
attack. Point. Cover point.
Center. Out home. In home.
Goalkeeper. Are you familiar
with these positions? Appa
rently, not many people here
are.
These positions belong to a
sport called lacrosse. Lac
rosse, like many other club
sports here, is not talked
about very often. And that's
too bad — because at Stanford
the men's and women's lac
rosse teams should be the talk
of the town.
Both the men's and wo
men's lacrosse teams have en
joyed remarkable, albeit little

known, success this past year.
The women's team has posted
its second straight unde
feated season with an 11-0 re
cord this year following an
8-0 record last year.
Meanwhile, the men's team
recently captured the North
ern California Collegiate Di
vision Championship, defeat
ing every collegiate team in
Northern California without
suffering a loss, posting an
overall record of 11-5, with a
collegiate record of 9-1.
NorCal champs
While playing intercol
legiate matches against
California, UC-Davis, Pacific
and Santa Clara, the men's
team has also faced local club

teams from Palo Alto, Golden
Gate, Monterey and Berkeley.
The laxmen's most notable
victory came in the matchup
against Cal for the NorCal
championship when, accord
ing to coach Sam Sadtler, "we
spotted them three goals and
came back to beat them 8-3."
The women's team, which
belongs to the California
Women's Lacrosse Associa
tion, plays against such teams
as UCLA, Long Beach St., San
Jose St., Berkeley, Palo Alto
and Los Angeles.
"We've played them all and
we've beaten them. We had
only one really close game,"
coach Barbara Longstreth
boasted. Longstreth, how
ever, was quick to add that the
lone close match, a 6-5 vic
tory over Long Beach St., was
vindicated later on in the sea
son by a 12-5 stomping over
those same 49ers.
Despite the successes of
both squads, poor fan turn
out has been the norm.
Action every minute
"The biggest problem we
have is educating people to
what lacrosse is about. It's a
fantastic spectator sport. It's a
lot more fun to watch than
football or baseball because
there is action every minute,"
Sadtler said.

"It's a team sport. And
there are essentially no indi
vidual stars. Consequently,
you can't identify with an in
dividual as being the guy
that's going to win the game,"
Sadtler pointed out. He said
that this crucial dependence
upon team play helps make
this game so exciting.
While no one individual
can make or break a lacrosse
team, several individuals
have shined on both the
men's and women's teams.
The men are led by stalwart
goalie Denny Childs and cap
tains Kirk Phelps and Rick
Valentine. Phelps (49 goals
and 6 assists) and Valentine
(24 and 17) have sparked a
strong attack while Childs
has stopped his fair share of
potential goals
Leaders
The women are led by All-
California goalkeeper Buffi
Berger, whom Longstreth de
scribed as "the glue of the
team," as well as high scorers
Lynn Kaiser (25 goals), Kristi
Johnson (24 goals) and Jane
Carpenter (23 goals), who
also were All-California
selections.
Others who made the All-
California team were Helene
Kazanjian, Kelly Westerwick,
Lois Maxwell and Bitten

Skartvedt. Among these wo
men, Johnson, Kazanjian and
Kaiser will be representing
California in the United
States Championships in
New Jersey on Memorial Day
Weekend.
"Right now, there are op
portunities for individuals to
play on these All-California
teams. I'm hoping, in the fu
ture, to make opportunities
for Stanford as a University to
play — on the intercollegiate
(varsity) level," Longstreth
said.
"Lacrosse in California, for
women, is a pretty young
sport. It's basically been or
ganized for three years, but
really well organized for just
the last two," Longstreth said.
National competition?
"I don't ever envision us
going intercollegiate, but I
expect that we will be com
peting nationally in AIAW
championships within two to
three years," Longstreth
claimed.
Longstreth said the AIAW
executive board recently an
nounced that the first na
tional championship of wo
men's lacrosse will be held at
Yale University in 1981.
"We're hoping that we will
qualify, if not in 1981, very

soon thereafter," Longstreth
said.
Longstreth said that in pre
paration for a contest of that
sort, she is planning on hav
ing her team tour the east
coast next year at spring break
for some tougher collegiate
competition.
Lack of competition
"I believe the reason (lac
rosse) is not a full-fledged
super-sport is that we haven't
(had) the competition yet. As
soon as we have Pac-10 level
competition, we will be (a
super-sport)," Sadtler
explained. He said, however,
that the lacrosse teams at
UCLA. USC, UC-Santa Bar
bara, Claremont College,
Oregon, Washington and
Arizona are driving for a
league.
In the meantime, the lax
men must satisfy themselves
with battling Santa Barbara
for the California Collegiate
Division Championship June
2. Santa Barbara is the only
collegiate team to defeat the
Cards this year and Sadtler
said the Cards have an "even
chance" at beating them in
the upcoming match.
Varied experience
Among those who do play,
some have been playing for
years, while others had never
played before. While the
heart of the season runs from
mid-February to the end of

May, the teams practice most
of the year, with novices
being taught the "nuances" of
the game in autumn quarter
classes.
Sadtler said there are "no
problems" with having his
players work out on their own
because of the fact that team
play is crucial to the sport.
Lacrosse, which is legally
recognized as the national
game of Canada and which
was originated by the native
Americans several centuries
ago, has been played by men
at Stanford as a "contact"
sport since 1963. The wo
men's game, which em
phasizes a markedly different
"non-contact" style, has been
played here for the last three
years.
Though varsity letters are
awarded for lacrosse, it is still
considered a club sport, a title
which brings along with it
"very little funding."
"It is a sport which unfor
tunately is not inexpensive to
play," Sadtler said.
Geiger supportive
However, the new athletic
administration has given at
least one of these coaches a
reason to smile.
"Andy Geiger seems to be
really supportive. He knows
women's lacrosse because he
was theathleticdirectoratthe
University of Pennsylvania
where women's lacrosse was
one of the major sports.
