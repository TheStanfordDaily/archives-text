# Daily rips PJFs 23-13
## 
### Samuel Howe 
In a game marred by what
will go down in history as "the
bicycle controversy," the Dai
ly's Thunderturkey Softball
squad scored an impressive
23-13 victory over the profes
sional journalism fellows
(PJF's) here Saturday.
The final tally, which was
approved not without bitter
negotiation, was scored vari
ously at 23-13,19-13 and 15-12
for the Daily, and 14-11 for the
fellows by Martha Press, wife
of PJF coach Harry Press, '39,
editor of the Stanford Observer
here and a former managing
editor of the Daily.
Though the PJF's placed no
less than 15 ballplayers on the
field, including a number of
small and large children, the
Daily had no problem finding
holes in the defense and
capitalizing on them.
Brad Brockbank led the team
with eight full innings on the
pitcher's mound and two
booming first-inning home run
shots. Brockbank, who played
by the rules for once, which
called for at least one beer per
inning to be consumed,
yielded the mound to Jeff
"Boog" Powell in the final in

ning. "I didn't trust myself,"
confided Brockbank.
Earlier in the contest, Powell
had unleashed a booming drive
deep into right field where
three bystanders were viewing
the contest on their bicycles.
The PJF fielder went crash
ing into the bicycles, sending
the spectators sprawling and
losing his glasses as well as the
softball in the process.
As Powell crossed the plate
for an easy home run, the PJF's
immediately called a protest.
As no decision was reached,
Mrs. Press decided to keep two
different scores, and by the end
of the contest had added three
or four more.
Though Mr. Press turned in
an inspiring job performance
as coach and drove a number of
hard balls deep into the out
field, it wasn't enough as the
Daily rolled to an easy win, av
enging last year's 11-9 annihi
lation by the PJF's.
Other highlights of the con
test were exciting coaching
from injured Daily Assoc.
