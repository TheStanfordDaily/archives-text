San Francisco (AP) â€” Bob
Hodge of Hanover, Me., who
placed third in this year's Bos
ton Marathon, won the 68th
annual Bay-to-Breakers race
across the hills of San Fran
cisco yesterday, ahead of a
crowd of 18,000 runners. Con
testants came from as far away
as New Zealand.
Hodge, 23, of the Greater
Boston Track Club, completed
the grueling 7.6-mile run from
the foot of Market Street to the
foggy ocean front in 36:50.9.
Record time of 35:17 was
posted by Gerald Barrett of Au
stralia last year.

Bay-to-Breakers

Thirty-nine-year-old Laurie
Binder of the KCBQ Track Club
in San Diego led the women
racers with a record 43:07.6,
bettering the women's record
of 43:22 set by Maryetta
Boitano of San Francisco in
1974.
The oldest finisher was 84-
year-old Ivor Welch of Pacifica,
Calif., the youngest 7-year-old
Carl Brendan of Oakland.
Hodge and Binder will be
flown to Australia in August to
complete in the City-to-Surf
race in Sydney.
Other runners with whom
Hodge and Binder shared the
field were dressed in slightly
more cumbersome attire. One
reunioning Bay Area Law
School trekked the course fully
clad in tuxedoes, while another
group carefully hoisted a large
cardboard box for the duration
and ran as a six-pack of beer. At
least three runners ran the
course naked.
Stanford was not without
representation during the race,
as several runners here were
among the top finishers, in
cluding sophomores Bill Mer
rvfield (73rd place) and David
Townsley (211 th).
