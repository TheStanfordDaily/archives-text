# Nobel laureate to hold chair here
## 
### Brian Sprague 
Nobel laureate Kenneth
Arrow has been named by the
Board of Trustees as the first
holder of the newly created
loan Kenney professorship in
economics.
The endowed chair, a gift of
Las Vegas builder John Kenney
Jr., is in honor of Mrs. Kenney,
a member of the Nevada State
Board of Education. Both are
University alumni.
Arrow is scheduled to teach
both graduate and under
graduate courses in the future,
according to Prof. Bert
Hickman, chairman of the
Economics Dept. However,
said Hickman, his expertise
will mainly be utilized in the
graduate school next year. The
majority of his courses will
concern economic theory, said
Hickman.
"Arrow essentially began his
teaching career here,"
Hickman added. After rising
quickly from acting professor
in 1949 to executive head of the
Economics Dept. in 1953,
Arrow resigned to accept an
offer at Harvard University,
said Hickman.
"The Department of
Economics had discussed with
him (Arrow) his returning, but
circumstances led to a decision
not to join," said Hickman. He
added that he was "quite
pleased to have him join the
faculty."
Endowed chairs
"Endowed chairs," said
Hickman, "go to people with

distinguished academic
achievements."
Such chairs are created only
when some individual decides
to donate a sum of money to
such a fund, said Frank Ratts,
Jr., manager of plant account
ing. The money from this fund
can go only towards the Ken
ney professorship; it cannot be
used for other purposes, he
said.
"The Economics Department
has come a long way," said
Ratts. "I know that Arrow will
be an asset to the department."
Books, honorary degrees
Arrow, who will begin regu
lar teaching duties this fall, is
the author of 13 books, one of
which he co-authored with
Stanford Economics Prof.
Mordecai kurz.
Arrow holds honorary de
grees from eight of the world's
leading universities, and is a
member of the U.S., British and
Flemish academies of science.
Arrow, who won the Nobel
Prize for Economics in 1972,
has twice been a guest profes
sor at the Institute for Ad
vanced Studies in Vienna and
has three times been a fellow of
Churchill College, Cambridge,
England.
The University has leased
Arrow land across from Roth
house. The construction un
derway is being conducted by
Arrow at his own expense, said
Robert Summers, manager of
faculty housing. This type of
lease contract is often provided
by the University for faculty
members, he added.
