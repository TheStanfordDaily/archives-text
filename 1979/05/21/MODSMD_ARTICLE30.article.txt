Cardinal winger Maria
Duryea called it a "disappoint
ing way to end the season," and
it may have been, but neverthe
less the Stanford Women's soc
cer team went down fighting.
This weekend saw a 10-team
tournament held at Stanford's
own Roble Field. The host Car
dinals, who were able to make
it to the final game, were stop
ped short in their attempt to
take the championship. On
Sunday they tangled with a
tough young team composed
of women from the Concord
area. The game was tied at 3-3
at the end of regulation play.
The contest then went into
overtime, where both teams
held each other scoreless.
Eventually Concord took the
victory and the tournament
crown when they beat the
Cards in a North American
Soccer League-style shoot out
which followed the overtime
period.
The tournament was made
up of teams from the Bay Area
and elsewhere.

Also playing were two youth
league teams from Palo Alto,
the Wildcats and the Panthers,
along with Chasqui, a team
from the south Bay Area, and a
high school all-star team from
Marin.
Ellen Griep, Kelly Scott, Julie
Zender and Fran Roelfsema,
all seniors, played the
last games of their careers in
the tournament.
The tournament lasted all
weekend, starting on Friday.
Each team played either two
games Friday, or one Friday
and one Saturday morning.
The secondaries were held
Saturday afternoon, and the fi
nals and playoffs were decided
on Sunday.
Third place went to the team
from Hayward, who battled
Marin on the final day of the
tournament.
The season is now over for
the Cardinals, and it was a suc
cessful one. Their record
stands at 8-0 in league play,
and their only two losses oc
curred against Hawaiian Club
teams during spring break
play.
