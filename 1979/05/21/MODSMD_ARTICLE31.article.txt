# Lyman to decide 'shortly'
## Lomita extension still in limbo 
### Nancy Koehn 
University President
Richard Lyman is "very aware"
of student and faculty concern
over the proposed extension of
Lomita Drive to Campus Drive
and will make a final decision
on the issue "shortly," accord
ing to Jean Fetter, assistant to
the president.
Approximately 600 students
and faculty signed petitions
against the road extension. The
petitions were delivered to
Lyman last Wednesday, Fetter
said.
She added that Lyman has
received the petitions oppos
ing the proposed extension, is
aware of the issues involved
and "is weighing the pros and
cons of the decision."
The new road is estimated to
cost about $273,000, according
to Philip Williams, director of
planning for the University.
Approved by the Board of Trus-

tees over a year ago, the Lomita
extension has two objectives,
Williams noted.
The proposed extension,
which calls for the closing of
Mayfield Avenue between the
Tresidder area and Campus
Drive, would create a mall bet
ween existing Row houses.
Williams said the creation of a
pedestrian mall between the
Row houses is the second ob
jective of the Lomita extension
and has been a programatic
goal of the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs for a "long
time."
Opponents of the extension
maintained in their petitions
that the move to channel traffic
away from Mayfield and onto
Lomita would create safety
hazards and heavy traffic on
the new road. They added that
the proposed road would be
aesthetically and environmen
tally damaging.

Students who are against the
new road rallied in protest May
11 between the Knoll and
Campus Drive, in an area
known as Eels Field. Under
plans for the proposed Lomita
extension, this area would be
plowed under.
Opponents of the extension
maintain that long-term Uni
versity plans to build a portion
of Campus Drive south from
Junipero Serra could be de
veloped to accommodate the
traffic problems on Mayfield
without recourse to a Lomita
extension.
The completion of Campus
Drive has been put in abeyance
following the Palo Alto City
Council's decision against
widening Willow Road from
two to four lanes. Willow is the
central east-west route across
University property from El
Camino to Junipero Serra.
