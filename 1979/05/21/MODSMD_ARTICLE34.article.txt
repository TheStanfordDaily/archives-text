# Phi Psi band is 'different'

High atop San Juan hill in the Phi Psi house,
pulsating energy, like a festering boil, is expand
ing in all directions. The cause of all this com
motion? Stanford's latest and hottest rock
reggae-funk group; The Phi Psi Band. What they
lack in name creativity they make up for with
wild enthusiasm.
Most remarkable about this group is that only
two months ago the six band members were little
known outside the walls of Phi Psi, being no
thing more than a Thursday night jam session.
But now with gigs galore at such varied loca
tions as Roth House, Columbae, Paloma, T resid
der patio and Saturday at Splendor on the Grass,
the band is skyrocketing.
Recent success has so excited the group that
Nik-bar Roy, bassist, exclaims, "If I would have
started this two years ago I probably wouldn't be
graduating with a civil engineering degree!"
Three factors set this group apaVt from other
area bands: a highly diversified repertoire, a un
ique combination of instruments, and the
boundless, soulful voice of lead singer, Lesli
Moulton.
"The music is Waxahatchee funk — chicken
skin music," guitarist Lyle Zimmerman exp
lains. "We try to stay away from sounding
exactly like anyone else — keeps us from too
many comparisons. If you try to play just like the
originals, all you do is remind the folks just how
good the Dead, the Beatles, the Airplane, the

Weavers and the Wailers are, and the audience
just ends up remembering and not listening."
'A few good roots'
Dual lead/rhythm guitarists, Chris Pilon and
Zimmerman, along with sax/flutist Peter Moul
ton combine with the talented core of keyboar
dist Jay Gitterman, bassist Roy, drummer Dan
Purtell and vocalist Moulton to present a cap
tivating and invigorating sound.
But things have not always come so easy to
this hard-working sextet. "Our biggest problem
is dreaming up a name that fits our identity
without smacking of bile," muses wind magi
cian Pete Moulton. After adopting such names
as The Purple Tops, White Noise, Ghecco Fever,
Pete and Lisa's, Lesli and the Gismatics, and
Meshuganah, the band decided it simply wasn't
worth the trouble. Hence The Phi Psi Band.
Looking toward the future the band envisions
only one factor that might deter them. Their
newness in the community has not allowed
them to form the valuable connections that any
aspiring band needs. Says Pilon, "What we're
lookin' for is a few good roots."
Varied reactions
Although gaining ever-increasing popularity
among the University community, reaction
among their original fans has been varied. Eric
Mathre laments, "I wish they'd go back to play
ing small halls." Asked what she thinks of the
band, long-time resident Jane Ratchye remarks,
"I don't know that I've ever heard them." RA
reaction has been quite good, however. Says
Dennis McEnnerny, "Oh wow . . . intense."
