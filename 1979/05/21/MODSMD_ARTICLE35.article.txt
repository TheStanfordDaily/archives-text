# Mascot poll in the offing
## 
### Laura Erickson 
Will the University ever get
an official mascot? The search
has gone on for many years to
no avail. Recently, however,
despite war cries from diehard
Indian supporters and some
what more tame support for the
Stanford Cardinals, two new
candidates have emerged —
the Griffins and the Trees.
A poll to determine student
preference here for one of the
two will be distributed in
dorms and houses by RAs to
morrow, according to senior
Suzanne Whipple, chairperson
of a committee to survey stu
dent opinions on the mascot is
sue.
The Griffins and the Trees
easily captured the top two
spots on the mascot referen
dum in the ASSU spring ballot.
The Griffins received 35 per
cent of the vote and the trees
received 34 percent.
Although it is unlikely that a
new mascot will be agreed
upon by the end of the school
year, the results of the poll will
be given to Athletic Director
Andy Geiger to indicate stu
dent feelings, Whipple said.
After a mascot has been ap
proved by the Athletic Board, it
must be approved by President
Richard Lyman and the Board
of Trustees to become the Uni
versity's official mascot. Asked
about the Athletic Depart
ment's stand on a mascot,
Nancy Peterson, assistant
sports information director,
said that the Athletic Depart
ment did not want to take a pos
ition on the issue but that "my
main concern and that of the
other administrators is that the
mascot is what the students
want."
Speed selection process?
Whipple said that "It (the
mascot) is a sad issue because
it's bonn stretched out so long
that people have lost interest."
Whipple said she hopes to
speed up the choice of a mascot
with the survey.
Many students support the
Griffins because they are
"wise, courageous, full of
knowledge, strength and good
luck," according to Mike
Thurman, active Griffin sup
porter. He said he felt there
were many parallels between
griffins and Stanford life. The
Griffin is crimson red and in
Greek mythology was the sec

ret weapon of the queen of the
Pacific Coast, Caliphia
(California).
"Griffins attack by air as well
as by sea, which is symbolic of
Stanford's excellent passing
game," Thurman added. He
also said that he felt Griffins
had strong student support,
especially among athletes.
Other students support the
Trees. Randy Devol, LSJUMB
manager, is in favor of the
Trees because "it's crazy, it's
unusual to have a mascot like
the Trees." He said that he felt
the Trees was a "bold state
ment" which would show that
Stanford students don't need
an overly-dignified mascot.
He also said that trees were
part of the Stanford tradition.
No one has been out campaign

ing for the Trees, he added, but
the fact that "so many students
support it anyway shows that it
is a viable alternative."
Previous mascots
The University had no athle
tic symbol except for the red
block letter "S" until the early
1930s when the Indian was
adopted. The Indian remained
Stanford's mascot until 1972,
when it was officially discon
tinued because "it was be
lieved to btj disrespectful to
ward the native Americans,"
according to ASSU Senator
Tom Cart. The color cardinal
red became Stanford's next
symbol. Students are not dis
satisfied with the color, said
Whipple, "because it's hard for
people to relate to a color."

Though the Griffin captured the top spot in this spring's mascot
referendum, the Tree looms not far behind. The issue will move
one step closer toward resolution with another ballot distributed
here tomorrow.
