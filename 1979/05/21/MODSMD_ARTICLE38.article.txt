# Possible ban on waterbeds, refrigerators
## Energy rules proposed

powered jacuzzi or hot tub, and that many
other fraternities are waiting to see if the Phi
Delt installation is approved before they, too,
submit their proposals.
He said some people feel "energy conserva
tion is being used by the University to make
sure the Stanford University image is not one
of rich kids sitting in their jacuzzis."
Along similar lines, John Julius, Phi Delt
member and a coordinator of the plans for a hot
tub, said that though he does not think the
University is "out to get" fraternities, "they are
making it hard" for them to get a hot tub.
He said the University set certain stipula
tions to be fulfilled before a permit for a Phi
Delt hot tub would be granted, and then gave
the Phi Delts "the runaround." When they
were satisfying the conditions the University
set, h8 said, the University decided they must
wait for the upcoming energy guidelines.
"I can't see why the University would want
to restrict lifestyles, but that, in effect, is what
they are doing."
Sprowls, however, said the proposed energy
policy is "not directed against fraternities."
Instead, the question is whether "the energy
use of a jacuzzi for 50 or 60 people is justified."
Julie Tsoi, chairman of CoSS-R, stressed that
the new energy policy is "not something that

will be handed down by a committee, but
something that we will agree on together.
"Adversary relations between the administ
ration and the students would be a backward
step away from any kind of good energy pol
icy."
She said the committee plans to hold open
meetings with concerned student groups be
fore they make any final recommendations.
Tsoi said the primary problem she sees with
the proposed policy is its enforcement. "It is
hard to enforce energy policy with respect to
Jhe individual items" like waterbeds.
Joost agreed. "We don't want to sacrifice the
goals of residential education to enact some of
these policies."
He said he does not want the policy to lead to
bickering within the dorms or to the deteriora
tion of the RA position into one of a "conserva
tion policeman."
He recommended a different philosophy be
adopted, that energy conservation goals be set
and that the University not question the resi
dences so long as the goals are met. He said a
fraternity should be able to trade one thing off
for another, such as lowering the thermostat to
compensate for a hot tub, if it so desired.
Sprowls, though, said it is "ridiculous to
conserve energy so it can be used another
way."
