# Possible ban on waterbeds, refrigerators

powered jacuzzi or hot tub, and that many
other fraternities are waiting to see if the Phi
Delt installation is approved before they, too,
submit their proposals.
He said some people feel "energy conserva
tion is being used by the University to make
sure the Stanford University image is not one
of rich kids sitting in their jacuzzis."
Along similar lines, John Julius, Phi Delt
member and a coordinator of the plans for a hot
tub, said that though he does not think the
University is "out to get" fraternities, "they are
making it hard" for them to get a hot tub.
He said the University set certain stipula
tions to be fulfilled before a permit for a Phi
Delt hot tub would be granted, and then gave
the Phi Delts "the runaround." When they
were satisfying the conditions the University
set, h8 said, the University decided they must
wait for the upcoming energy guidelines.
"I can't see why the University would want
to restrict lifestyles, but that, in effect, is what
they are doing."
Sprowls, however, said the proposed energy
policy is "not directed against fraternities."
Instead, the question is whether "the energy
use of a jacuzzi for 50 or 60 people is justified."
Julie Tsoi, chairman of CoSS-R, stressed that
the new energy policy is "not something that

will be handed down by a committee, but
something that we will agree on together.
"Adversary relations between the administ
ration and the students would be a backward
step away from any kind of good energy pol
icy."
She said the committee plans to hold open
meetings with concerned student groups be
fore they make any final recommendations.
Tsoi said the primary problem she sees with
the proposed policy is its enforcement. "It is
hard to enforce energy policy with respect to
Jhe individual items" like waterbeds.
Joost agreed. "We don't want to sacrifice the
goals of residential education to enact some of
these policies."
He said he does not want the policy to lead to
bickering within the dorms or to the deteriora
tion of the RA position into one of a "conserva
tion policeman."
He recommended a different philosophy be
adopted, that energy conservation goals be set
and that the University not question the resi
dences so long as the goals are met. He said a
fraternity should be able to trade one thing off
for another, such as lowering the thermostat to
compensate for a hot tub, if it so desired.
Sprowls, though, said it is "ridiculous to
conserve energy so it can be used another
way."
The University is now considering an energy
use policy which would prohibit the installa
tion of non-solar powered hot tubs, saunas and
jacuzzis in University residences, and might
ban refrigerators and heated waterbeds from
student rooms or tax owners of such equip
ment.
The plan is now before the Committee on
Student Resident Services' subcommittee on
residences (CoSS-R). Members of the commit
tee emphasize the current proposal is merely a
beginning to work from.
The plan's operative sections are that "effec
tive immediately, swimming pools, hot tubs,
spas, jacuzzis and other similar equipment
using nonrenewable energy sources shall not
be installed in, on, or about student residences.
Although such equipment existing as of this
date shall be permitted to continue in use,
groups having such equipment are encouraged
to discontinue or severely curtail their use of
the same.
"Groups having such equipment are subject
to the requirement that all costs (of operation,
etc.) . . . shall be their responsibility; further,
such groups may be required to cease the use of
the equipment in the event of severe utility
shortage, as determined by Stanford.
"The use of refrigerators and electric
waterbed heaters will be viewed as inconsis
tent with the intent of this policy effective
Sept. 1, 1979. Students using such equipment
in their rooms may be subject to extra charges
for excessive consumption of electricity and
may be required to remove such equipment."
No approval yet
None of the plan's clauses has been ap
proved yet; if and when they are, they will
come before the full Committee on Student
Services (CoSS) and then be submitted to Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons or Associate
Dean for Residential Education Norm Robin
son, said Edward Scoles, director of housing

management, an ex officio member of CoSS-R.
Discussion of the plan, which he authored, will
resume Thursday, he said.
CoSS-R member Sharon Sprowls said the
philosophy behind the proposal is that "the
University should be a leader in promoting
conservation of nonrenewable resources and
educating people to conserve."
Karl Johnson, an energy conservation
specialist who has been advising CoSS-R on its
energy proposals, added that given "the world
energy situation and the University's costs," it
is desirable to formulate an energy policy.
Johnson said each waterbed heater costs the
University $10 per month, according to heat
loss calculations he made. He added that he
owned a waterbed for three years and used a
foam rubber pad to insulate himself from the
water in the bed and so did not need a heater.
500 waterbeds
Sprowls said there are about 500 waterbeds
on campus. "That's $40,000," she said, ques
tioning the fairness of the entire University
community paying for 500 people's waterbeds.
Johnson, though, said that this is not the
whole issue.
"Do you decide that if someone can afford it,
they can pay for it?" he said, or should the
criterion be related to the nation's energy situa
tion?
Peter Joost, CoSS-R member, said the issue
had come before CoSS-R in October, in the
wake of the SAE fraternity's request for a
jacuzzi. Robinson realized then that the Uni
versity had no concrete energy policy, and
suggested the CoSS-R develop one, Joost said.
The committee has only taken the issue up this
quarter, though, because it was preoccupied
with housing evaluations during the winter, he
added.

tub, said that though he does not think the
University is "out to get" fraternities, "they are
making it hard" for them to get a hot tub.
He said the University set certain stipula
tions to be fulfilled before a permit for a Phi
Delt hot tub would be granted, and then gave
the Phi Delts "the runaround." When they
were satisfying the conditions the University
set, h8 said, the University decided they must
wait for the upcoming energy guidelines.
"I can't see why the University would want
to restrict lifestyles, but that, in effect, is what
they are doing."
Sprowls, however, said the proposed energy
policy is "not directed against fraternities."
Instead, the question is whether "the energy
use of a jacuzzi for 50 or 60 people is justified."
Julie Tsoi, chairman of CoSS-R, stressed that
the new energy policy is "not something that

will be handed down by a committee, but
something that we will agree on together.
"Adversary relations between the administ
ration and the students would be a backward
step away from any kind of good energy pol
icy."
She said the committee plans to hold open
meetings with concerned student groups be
fore they make any final recommendations.
Tsoi said the primary problem she sees with
the proposed policy is its enforcement. "It is
hard to enforce energy policy with respect to
Jhe individual items" like waterbeds.
Joost agreed. "We don't want to sacrifice the
goals of residential education to enact some of
these policies."
He said he does not want the policy to lead to
bickering within the dorms or to the deteriora
tion of the RA position into one of a "conserva
tion policeman."
He recommended a different philosophy be
adopted, that energy conservation goals be set
and that the University not question the resi
dences so long as the goals are met. He said a
fraternity should be able to trade one thing off
for another, such as lowering the thermostat to
compensate for a hot tub, if it so desired.
Sprowls, though, said it is "ridiculous to
conserve energy so it can be used another
way."
The University is now considering an energy
use policy which would prohibit the installa
tion of non-solar powered hot tubs, saunas and
jacuzzis in University residences, and might
ban refrigerators and heated waterbeds from
student rooms or tax owners of such equip
ment.
The plan is now before the Committee on
Student Resident Services' subcommittee on
residences (CoSS-R). Members of the commit
tee emphasize the current proposal is merely a
beginning to work from.
The plan's operative sections are that "effec
tive immediately, swimming pools, hot tubs,
spas, jacuzzis and other similar equipment
using nonrenewable energy sources shall not
be installed in, on, or about student residences.
Although such equipment existing as of this
date shall be permitted to continue in use,
groups having such equipment are encouraged
to discontinue or severely curtail their use of
the same.
"Groups having such equipment are subject
to the requirement that all costs (of operation,
etc.) . . . shall be their responsibility; further,
such groups may be required to cease the use of
the equipment in the event of severe utility
shortage, as determined by Stanford.
"The use of refrigerators and electric
waterbed heaters will be viewed as inconsis
tent with the intent of this policy effective
Sept. 1, 1979. Students using such equipment
in their rooms may be subject to extra charges
for excessive consumption of electricity and
may be required to remove such equipment."
No approval yet
None of the plan's clauses has been ap
proved yet; if and when they are, they will
come before the full Committee on Student
Services (CoSS) and then be submitted to Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons or Associate
Dean for Residential Education Norm Robin
son, said Edward Scoles, director of housing

management, an ex officio member of CoSS-R.
Discussion of the plan, which he authored, will
resume Thursday, he said.
CoSS-R member Sharon Sprowls said the
philosophy behind the proposal is that "the
University should be a leader in promoting
conservation of nonrenewable resources and
educating people to conserve."
Karl Johnson, an energy conservation
specialist who has been advising CoSS-R on its
energy proposals, added that given "the world
energy situation and the University's costs," it
is desirable to formulate an energy policy.
Johnson said each waterbed heater costs the
University $10 per month, according to heat
loss calculations he made. He added that he
owned a waterbed for three years and used a
foam rubber pad to insulate himself from the
water in the bed and so did not need a heater.
500 waterbeds
Sprowls said there are about 500 waterbeds
on campus. "That's $40,000," she said, ques
tioning the fairness of the entire University
community paying for 500 people's waterbeds.
Johnson, though, said that this is not the
whole issue.
"Do you decide that if someone can afford it,
they can pay for it?" he said, or should the
criterion be related to the nation's energy situa
tion?
Peter Joost, CoSS-R member, said the issue
had come before CoSS-R in October, in the
wake of the SAE fraternity's request for a
jacuzzi. Robinson realized then that the Uni
versity had no concrete energy policy, and
suggested the CoSS-R develop one, Joost said.
The committee has only taken the issue up this
quarter, though, because it was preoccupied
with housing evaluations during the winter, he
added.

win University approval for a partially solar-

powered jacuzzi or hot tub, and that many
other fraternities are waiting to see if the Phi

submit their proposals.
