# Minority grad student estimate may be low
## 
### Rachel Bagby 
The 1977-78 report on the
number of minority graduate
students enrolled at the Uni
versity may suffer from inhe
rent underestimations,
suggested Bliss Carnochan,
dean of graduate studies, at last
week's Faculty Senate meet
ing.
"Counting minority students
is not at all easy," Carnochan
said. One reason for the diffi
culty is that graduate division
records are not computerized
and therefore difficult to corre
late. Another, and perhaps
more important reason, is that
minority students may choose
nof to identify themselves as
such.
Carnochan said changes take
place in these identifications
after students arrive here. Stu
dents previously choosing not to
be identified as minorities later
alter their records and this
further complicates the collec
tion of data for the report.
He also told the senate that
"1977-78 was not a good year"
for recruitment of either minor
ity or women faculty members.
The annual report to the senate
on the representation of
women among University fa
culty revealed that last year

under 10 percent of those ap
pointed to the academic coun
cil were women. This figure is
the lowest of any year to date.
Minority appointments were
down to a total of three com
pared to nine in 1976-77 and a
high of 16 five years ago.
Part of the problem is that
several affirmative action can
didates in whom the Univer
sity was interested chose not to
accept the University's ap
pointment offers, according to
the record. Another contribut
ing factor is that the pool of
qualified minority and women
candidates, though growing, is
still unable to meet the demand
for sucb candidates.
In other business, the con
firmed results for the elections
held at the senate's May 10 or
ganizational meeting were re
ported as follows:
Albert Hastorf, psychology
professor, is chairman-elect of
the senate and the steering
committee; Robert Chase,
surgery professor, Theodore
Gabelle, applied physics pro
fessor, Nannerl Keohane, polit
ical science professor and
Robert Schimke, professor/
chairman of the Biological Sci
ences Dept. are members-elect
of the steering committee.
