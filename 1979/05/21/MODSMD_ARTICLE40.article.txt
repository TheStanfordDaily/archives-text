# Hillier to leave CIR post
## Chairman ends 2 year term 
### Theodore Herhold 
Fred Hillier, chairman of the
Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR), and pro
fessor of operations research
here, will step down at the end
of the year, leaving a vacancy at
the head post for the first time
in the ClR's short history.
The commission, made up of
students, faculty, alumni and
staff, advises the Board of Trus
tees Select Committee on In

vestment Responsibility
(SCIR), and was established
two years ago out of wide
spread concern with the
school's investments in corpo
rations operating in South Af
rica. Hillier has been the com
mission's only chairman.
Hillier said he will be taking
a sabbatical leave next year to
"catch up on research and writ
ing." According to President
Richard Lyman, who originally
appointed Hillier to the CIR, no
new names have been prop
osed to the president yet as re
placements for Hillier.
Hillier, however, speculated
that David Abernethy, as
sociate dean of undergraduate
studies, might be a possible
candidate for his post, but ad
ded, "I certainly don't want to
influence the president's deci
sion."
Abernethy, one of the origi
nal members of CIR, was not
active on the commission this
year. He is, however, eligible
for reappointment next year,
according to Hillier. Aber
nethy, a professor of political
science, "would give some
continuity to the CIR," said
Hillier.
The president, according to
Hillier, would prefer to select
an incumbent faculty or staff
member to become the chair
man. Abernethy would be the
only returning faculty member.
None of the other facultv mem
bers will be carried over, said
Hillier.
Hillier said his decision to
step down should not come as a
surprise because he had origi
nally planned to stay only two

years. Hillier said his intention
to stay until the end of this year
was known to Lyman.
"It's been a good year. We've
all worked well together," said
Hillier. "I'm gratified the board
(SCIR) has agreed with our re
commendations in a higher
percentage this year than last."
Hillier said the toughest de
cision the commission has had
to deal with this year has been
on loans to the government of
Chile. The commission has
consistently voted for with
drawal resolutions dealing
with loans to South Africa, and
Hillier sees no essential differ
ence between the South Afri
can issue and that of Chile.
"We've had to study this ques
tion hard, and have spent a lot
of time discussing these with
drawal resolutions," said Hill
ier.
Hillier also said he foresees
no "radical changes" in store
for the CIR, but says he is con
cerned that the CIR might shift
away from a strong position on
withdrawal in the future.
Lyman agreed saying, "The
commission has not shown as
strong a policy on withdrawal
from South Africa this year.
Last year the majority was con
sistently for withdrawal. But
this might not be the case any
more."
Lyman said the CIR has done
a "responsible and thoughtful
job" this year and sees an even
"greater degree of agreement
between the CIR and trustees in
the future." Lyman said that
Hillier has been a "conscienti
ous" chairman and is sorry to
see him go.
