UAL could settle strike
Chicago — United Airlines, the na
tion's largest air carrier, could resume
some flights by Memorial Day if striking
machinists ratify a new tentative contract,
an airlines spokesman said yesterday.
The tentative settlement announced
Saturday in Denver could end the air
line's longest strike, which began March
31 when the machinists union walked out
after rejecting a negotiated contract in a
dispute mainly over monetary issues.
Marc Michaelson, Midwest manager of
public relations for the Chicago-based
carrier, said that if the 18,600-member
union ratifies the proposal at the end of
this week, limited flights could resume by
next Monday, with a full schedule start
ing a week to 10 days later.
Industry observers have said United is
losing between $1 million and $1.5 mill
ion a day because of the strike, making it
the most costly in airline history.
The strike has put 28,000 union and
non-union employees out of work and re
duced hours and otherwise affected the
remaining 26,000 workers.
Trudeau defeat possible
Toronto — Progressive Conservative
standardbearer Joe Clark says polls show
he has a "real possibility" of forming a
majority government that would unseat
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau after 11

years and end 16 years of Liberal Party
domination.
The latest Gallup poll, published Fri
day, showed Trudeau's Liberals and
Clarke's Conservatives deadlocked
nationwide at 37.5 percent, with national
elections approaching tomorrow.
Clark's optimism lies in the fact that
nearly half the votes for individual Lib
eral parliamentary candidates areforecast
to come from solidly Liberal Quebec Pro
vince, which elects fewer than one-fourth
of the seats in the Commons.
The 39-year-old Clark said in Van
couver on Saturday that his party will
' capture more Liberal seats in Quebec than
the Liberals will take in western Canada.
Thatcher irks Labor
London — Margaret Thatcher's Con
servative government is little more than
two weeks old and already British
policemen and soldiers are richer and
labor leaders angrier as national policy
takes an expected swing to the right.
The nation's first woman prime minis
ter scarcely drew a breath before she
began shoving her business-oriented
legislative package at the 635-member
House of Commons, where her Conserva
tives won a 43-seat majority in the May 3
general elections.
The country's 316,000 servicemen and
127,000 policemen got raises of up to 20
percent, not due until autumn. She also
took preliminary action to outlaw "sec

ondary picketing" of firms not directly
involved in strikes. Labor leaders re
sponded angrily to the anti-strike steps,
although the action was seen as more
moderate than had been expected.
"The path we now follow is the path the
people have chosen," Thatcher declared
as Parliament opened an 18-month ses
sion Tuesday.
Mexico breaks relations
Cancun, Mexico — President Jose
Lopez Portillo announced yesterday that
Mexico is breaking diplomatic relations
with Nicaragua because of the "horrend
ous genocide" committed by the govern
ment of President Anastasio Somoza. He
called on other Latin American countries
to take the same action.
In Nicaragua, reports reaching the capi
tal of Managua said an estimated 300
guerrillas had seized the town of Jinotega
and Somoza's national guard was fight
ing block-by-block to retake it. One re
fugee from Jinotega, 100 miles north of
Managua, said, "There is fighting in all
parts of the city," but he did not know
many persons had been killed.
A national guard spokesman in Man
agua acknowledged that "there are dis
turbances in Jinotega," but gave no de
tails. He did announce that eight
guardsmen were killed in an ambush
Saturday night in Leon, 60 miles north of
Managua.
Costa Rica severed relations with

Nicaragua late last year. It said Nicara
guan troops had crossed the border sev
eral times and killed or wounded a
number of Costa Rican frontier guards.
Somoza at that time accused Costa Rica
of aiding and harboring Sandinista Na
tional Liberation Front guerrillas, who
spearheaded the September revolt.
College costs increase
New York — The cost of going to col
lege will jump 9 percent this fall — to an
average $5500 at private schools and
$3200 at public schools, a new report
says.
The study, released yesterday, showed
that a student who attends a private,
four-year college and lives on campus
will have to spend an average of $5526 in
the coming academic year — equal to
about one-third of the median family in
come in the United States.
That cost is 10.6 percent more than in
1978-79 and would result in four years of
higher education costing more than
$22,000. At a few private schools, the
study said, the expense budget for 1979-
80 will top $9000.
Expenses at public, four-year colleges
will average $3258 the next school year,
8.5 percent more than last year, the study
by the College Scholarship Service of the
College Board said. Annual expenses at a
few four-year public institutions will top
$4400.

1978-79 and would result in four years of
higher education costing more than
$22,000. At a few private schools, the
study said, the expense budget for 1979-
80 will top $9000.
Expenses at public, four-year colleges
will average $3258 the next school year,
8.5 percent more than last year, the study
by the College Scholarship Service of the
College Board said. Annual expenses at a
few four-year public institutions will top
$4400.

UAL could settle strike
Chicago — United Airlines, the na
tion's largest air carrier, could resume
some flights by Memorial Day if striking
machinists ratify a new tentative contract,
an airlines spokesman said yesterday.
The tentative settlement announced
Saturday in Denver could end the air
line's longest strike, which began March
31 when the machinists union walked out
after rejecting a negotiated contract in a
dispute mainly over monetary issues.
Marc Michaelson, Midwest manager of
public relations for the Chicago-based
carrier, said that if the 18,600-member
union ratifies the proposal at the end of
this week, limited flights could resume by
next Monday, with a full schedule start
ing a week to 10 days later.
Industry observers have said United is
losing between $1 million and $1.5 mill
ion a day because of the strike, making it
the most costly in airline history.
The strike has put 28,000 union and
non-union employees out of work and re
duced hours and otherwise affected the
remaining 26,000 workers.
Trudeau defeat possible
Toronto — Progressive Conservative
standardbearer Joe Clark says polls show
he has a "real possibility" of forming a
majority government that would unseat
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau after 11

years and end 16 years of Liberal Party
domination.
The latest Gallup poll, published Fri
day, showed Trudeau's Liberals and
Clarke's Conservatives deadlocked
nationwide at 37.5 percent, with national
elections approaching tomorrow.
Clark's optimism lies in the fact that
nearly half the votes for individual Lib
eral parliamentary candidates areforecast
to come from solidly Liberal Quebec Pro
vince, which elects fewer than one-fourth
of the seats in the Commons.
The 39-year-old Clark said in Van
couver on Saturday that his party will
' capture more Liberal seats in Quebec than
the Liberals will take in western Canada.
Thatcher irks Labor
London — Margaret Thatcher's Con
servative government is little more than
two weeks old and already British
policemen and soldiers are richer and
labor leaders angrier as national policy
takes an expected swing to the right.
The nation's first woman prime minis
ter scarcely drew a breath before she
began shoving her business-oriented
legislative package at the 635-member
House of Commons, where her Conserva
tives won a 43-seat majority in the May 3
general elections.
The country's 316,000 servicemen and
127,000 policemen got raises of up to 20
percent, not due until autumn. She also
took preliminary action to outlaw "sec

ondary picketing" of firms not directly
involved in strikes. Labor leaders re
sponded angrily to the anti-strike steps,
although the action was seen as more
moderate than had been expected.
"The path we now follow is the path the
people have chosen," Thatcher declared
as Parliament opened an 18-month ses
sion Tuesday.
Mexico breaks relations
Cancun, Mexico — President Jose
Lopez Portillo announced yesterday that
Mexico is breaking diplomatic relations
with Nicaragua because of the "horrend
ous genocide" committed by the govern
ment of President Anastasio Somoza. He
called on other Latin American countries
to take the same action.
In Nicaragua, reports reaching the capi
tal of Managua said an estimated 300
guerrillas had seized the town of Jinotega
and Somoza's national guard was fight
ing block-by-block to retake it. One re
fugee from Jinotega, 100 miles north of
Managua, said, "There is fighting in all
parts of the city," but he did not know
many persons had been killed.
A national guard spokesman in Man
agua acknowledged that "there are dis
turbances in Jinotega," but gave no de
tails. He did announce that eight
guardsmen were killed in an ambush
Saturday night in Leon, 60 miles north of
Managua.
Costa Rica severed relations with

Nicaragua late last year. It said Nicara
guan troops had crossed the border sev
eral times and killed or wounded a
number of Costa Rican frontier guards.
Somoza at that time accused Costa Rica
of aiding and harboring Sandinista Na
tional Liberation Front guerrillas, who
spearheaded the September revolt.
College costs increase
New York — The cost of going to col
lege will jump 9 percent this fall — to an
average $5500 at private schools and
$3200 at public schools, a new report
says.
The study, released yesterday, showed
that a student who attends a private,
four-year college and lives on campus
will have to spend an average of $5526 in
the coming academic year — equal to
about one-third of the median family in
come in the United States.
That cost is 10.6 percent more than in
1978-79 and would result in four years of
higher education costing more than
$22,000. At a few private schools, the
