# 'Establishment defector' charges hidden motives in Vietnam
## Ellsberg discusses U.S. nuclear threats

He was "a rising star of (he military-intellectual com

where along the way, something happened, and Daniel
Ellsberg Rand Corporation analyst and Defense Dept.
consultant, became Daniel Ellsberg, war protester and
establishment defector,
Ellsberg was, says jann Wenner o Kolling Stone

° with the Vietnam War, Ellsbergi says, is
closelv connected to the bold thesis that he has brought
to this campus and elsewhere: that "U.S. presidents
everv one of them in every term of office since Hiroshima
(and up to Richard Nixon) - have seriously con
templated or secretly threatened imminent U.S. initia
tion of nuclear war."
"My most fundamental concern always about the vet
nam War was that our involvement was likely to evolve
in such a way that we would find ourselves considering,
and eventually using, nuclear weapons.
"I didn't think at the time, and 1 was wrong at the time,
that it was an imminent problem. In actual fact, 1 now
know that it was a danger at the very time, as early as

1964," Ellsberg says.
No public reaction
This war policy, which he ascribes definitely to both
presidents Lyndon Johnson and Nixon, wasdescnbed by
Nixon aide H.R. Haldeman in his book The Ends of
Power. Ellsberg says, but the public reaction has been
non-existent:

"The public has 100 percent ignored and neglected . . .
Haldeman's assertion that Nixon made actual specific
nuclear threats in pursuit of a conscious policy of win
ning the war with those nuclear threats, according to
Ellsberg. .
Why no response? Ellsberg wonders: having been
there," served under four U.S. presidents in various top
level advisory positions, he says he finds the l a{: k
public attention and media exposure to his findings both
incredible and disturbing.
He hints at censure: "I have raised a number of sublets
which have greatly excited local reporters and agencies,
but have been blocked" (at a national level).
Laos crisis charges
For example, Ellsberg claims that the United States
placed nuclear weapons on alert on a U.S. base in Japan
during the 1961 Laos crisis.
The Laos crisis, which escalated in April 1961, just
after U.S. President John Kennedy took office, basically
involved a confrontation of conservative and communist
forces within the country. The dispute was temporarily
solved in 1962 by U.N. arbitration which created a coali
tion government in the country.
Ellsberg bases his claim on a conversation he had with
the police lieutenant who arrested him in an incident at
Rocky Flats last August. The officer, Earl Spenard,
"commented that he had been a marine pilot (at a U.S.
base in Japan) from 1959 to 1963, that he had had nuclear
weapons up to 20 megatons on his plane, and specifi
cally that they were stored on the base, according

Fllsbertt. •
Although Ellsberg's claim caused a lot of discussion in
Japan, causing the government to issue a denial of any
knowledge of the incident, it attracted no national at
tention here," he says. , ,
Ellsberg explains that the United States placed the
weapons on alert without Japanese knowledge, or that
the Japanese government is lying.
'Secret crises'
The Laos incident is but one of what Ellsberg terms our
"secret crises": unannounced threats of, or preparations
for, imminent first-use of nuclear weapons by the United
Ststcs
Nuclear considerations aside, Ellsberg describes U.S.
participation in the Vietnam War on an effort to make an
example of the country to other nations who might con
sider opposing U.S. interests.
Many of the reasons for which U.S. involvement in
Vietnam was initially justified centered on the so-called
"domino theory": the fear that if one country in In
dochina were to fall under communist control, the rest
would soon follow and, many believed, other southeast
Asian countries would follow as well.
Domino theory
However, Ellsberg says, high level intelligence esti
mates (in the CIA and the State Department) tended to
oppose such expectations, particularly in southeast Asia
While subordination of Cambodia and Laos to Viet
nam in the event of a communist victory was to be ex
pected. Ellsberg says. "Government public statements
tended to predict, in contrast to the intelligence esti

mates, the expectation that communism would sweep
through all of southeast Asia.
"I didn't expect that, many anti-war leaders didn't
expect that, and it didn't come about.
"In fact, the dominoes successive administrations
were concerned about were not in southeast Asia, but in
other countries quite distant from the scene.
Effects on nationalism
Vietnam was used to influence "the attitudes of people
like the rulers of Saudi Arabia or other countries that
might be tempted to nationalize our resources, as in
Chile, or to allow communists, against our wishes to join
a popular coalition government, as in Italy.
"Even though we had negligible corporate interests in
Indochina, the effects for example on countries like
Chile, Peru, or the OPEC countries and their willingness
to nationalize, having nothing to do with communism or
even socialism, but essentially nationalism. (There were
concerns) that they would take heart from that, would
see it could be done, that a challenge to the U.S. could be
survived, even at great cost,"he says.
What kind of future do nuclear weapons propose?
Ellsberg paints a dim picture, particularly of the recently
negotiated second round of Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT).
He says that a number of weapons more powerful than
those covered by SALT pose a greater threat to arms race
stabilization. Among these weapons are the Trident, the
cruise missile, Missile X (a highly accurate underground
warhead), the neutron bomb and other enhanced radia
tion neutron warheads.

SALT rapped
Ellsberg says that SALT "doesn't even include, delib
erately omits these weapons from negotiation, since we
are determined to have them."
He says that there is "no problem area more important
than the study of policies which are leading us rather
quickly to extinction."
So he now discusses, whenever and wherever he can.
those policies, and also "what we really did as opposed
to what we said we were doing."
Ellsberg is brash enough to say, "For 11 years (1964-
1975) I was totally preoccupied with Vietnam . . . (The
war) was for me full time in terms of activity, reading and
thinking."
And, he says, "that connected with an earlier period,
1958 to 1964, when 1 was totally preoccupied with nuc
lear war...."
'Totally preoccupied'
A friend of Ellsberg's once said of him. "Ellsberg is a
moralist who can't conceive of another frame of mora
ity."
A short while ago I spoke with Ellsberg over the phone
to arrange an interview with him. To one of the times 1
suggested, he said, "No, we better not do it then,
probably be in jail that day."
Sure enough, April 29 came and Ellsberg was arreted
while marching on the gates of the Rocky Flats nuc lear
weapons plant in Colorado. And though he was release
on bail the same day, the incident is indicative of the
lengths to which the man goes in pursuit >112 what he
believes to be right.
