## Nick Fowler Blame ourselves for gas crunch 
### 
Just as Ayn Rand predicted
in .Atlas Shrugged, we. the pub
lic. have encouraged the gov
ernment to become omnipre
sent and omnipotent through
the tangled web of restriction
and regulation. The gas crisis
is far from new. it began when,
instead of paving the price of
the rest of the world for
gasoline, we allowed the gov
ernment to enforce an artifi
cially low price ceiling. Need
less to say, demand has now
outstripped supply.
We are becoming selfish, in
consistent looters While the
rest of the oil-importing world
is paying over Si 50 per gallon,
we cringe at the idea of dollar a
gallon gas
If we had not allowed gov
ernment to control the price of
gas. demand would not have
risen so sharply, and the cur

rent crunch would lack some of
its severity. With 20 20
hindsight, it appears that regu
lation was one of the basic
problems. Let us now not re
peat the mistake by allowing
more regulation such as the

For too Jong we have felt that we are in a
privileged position as Americans and that
we deserve the best the world has to offer.

forcing of gas stations to re
main open on weekends.
This regulation will merely
proliferate another level of
government bureaucracy and
not attack the problem We
pass referenda such as Proposi
tion 13 to decrease government
bureaucracy, but as soon as any
strain is placed on our style, we
look toward the government to

"do something about it"and
give the green light to add yet
another sector to the control of
government.
We are forcing gas stations to
remain at our disposal when
the objective elements such as

gas supply from refineries can
not accommodate the demand.
Instead of trying to control the
supply side of the crises, why
not look at the real problem of
rising demand'' We guzzle
energy, especially oil, as
though a limitless supply
existed.
Curtailment of demand is the
essential feature here — so why
not follow the lead of some
Scandinavian countries and
outlaw driving on Sunday?
That would be unthinkable, as
if our basic human rights had
been violated Yet. we feei no
qualms over forcing gas sta
tions to remain open.
For too long we have felt that
we are in a privileged position
as Americans and that we de
serve the best the world has to
offer We seem to believe that
the rest of the world exists to
supply us with ail our ex
travagant whims and desires
We blame the Organization of
Petroieum Exporting Countr.es
for our huge balance of trade
deficit when the blame rests
solely on our shoulders
Oil exporters do not force
their products on us Rather,
we can't get enough of their oil.
They are merely acting as any
self-respecting bus:rwss upon
finding a eager market — they
are charg:ng all the market will
rear We must face the reality
that it is our fault for leading
such extravagant lives and ex
pecting no repercussions. Yet.
we never consider that we are
at fault
We blame the oil companies
for our plight and charge that
they are holding back on sup
ply to force .-creases in pr.ce:
again, we feel we are above
blame But we gave the man
date for government to place
regulations or. free trade tc the

first place. The oil companies
do make record profits and will
make even greater profits
under a deregulated market,
but it is also they who are doing
the bulk of the research into al
ternative energy sources.
We applaud President
Jimmy Carter's Windfall Profits
Tax. for we feel cheated should
someone else make even bigger
profits. But where do these pro
fits go? They do not disappear
into the greedy hands of the
Boards of Directors, but are
either paid out in dividends or
plowed back into operations
and used for further research
into profit-making ventures,
namely other energy sources
We take away excess profits
from the oil companies and
funnel them into the bureauc
racy, expecting miracles from
both government and oil com
panies to develop those elusive
new energy sources to fuel our
ever-increasing glut By the
time the profits are divided
among the government's re
search groups and oil com
panies. there is little remaining
to do actual research
We can expect oil companies
to act no differently from any
other business As oil supplies
diminish world wide so too
will oil companies'profits, un
less they have other energy
sources to sell. They wish to
rind untapped energy sources
but they require the financial
means to do so. Further an
tagonization of the oil com
panies through additional reg
ulations and taxes wiJi only
serve to compound our present
proc.em and delay the advent
of a solution.
It is high time that we stop
ped trying to place blame aad
face the reality that we will
have to change our present
wasteful lifestyle We should
not posh for increased regula
tion that would only add to the
accretion of bureaucratic strata
within an enlarged govern
ment. Instead we should push
for hasty deregulation oi gas
prices and other methods to re
duce our burgeoning demand
for petroleum products — tn«r
rooe oi the dilemma that mow
plagues as.
