## My reasons for resigning 
### 
Last Friday, following the election of next
fail's Doily editor. I resigned in protest from my
position as Daily copy editor
After three years on the Doily staff — with
much of that time spent m different editorial
positions — this latest election has conclusively
demonstrated to me that the Dbilv mil continue
to be an increasingly pre-prcfessional organiza
tion emphasizing style over content "effi
ciency" over innovation, and harboring a
dangerous complacency that breeds a chronic
insensitiv.ty to large portions of the community
it serves
During my tenure a: the Doil> several people
who tried to constructively change the direction
of the Daily and its policies have eventually
resigned been fired or simply phased them
selves out I. too. having become dissatisifed
with the Daily have tried — unsuccessfully — to
effect some meaningful change
My resignation now w-.1l have little practical
impact on the paper or my career there as there
are '.ess than '.4 publishing days lest this quarter
and 1 will re graduating next month. Rather
making m> resignation public is - f.nal attempt
to provoke debate both within and without the
Da:.;. as to ■.«. r.ere the Dt:l> s res pons, bill ties lie
and whether they are re.ng hiifiileci
v nfortunate.y most critical analysis of "be
I\uh continues to originate outside the paper
Tr.e artifice of the Daa.v leadership continues "c
he We he the best we can and 1 think we do a
pretty good vfc despite the fact that commun
ity criticism over the last five months has in

creased dramatically
Characteristically, the Daily responds to this
criticism in an overly defensive way. which
serves to perpetuate the myth among its reader
ship that the Dc:.'> sees itself as an objective and
comprehensive newspaper, which it is not
Much of this criticism has been aimed at the
Daily's news coverage and editorial judgment
Coverage of minorities and women's affairs has
increased over the last volume but only beca use
of continued prodding from the outside, which
in rum has resulted in an editorial attitude of
"cover it so we don t catch it later"' instead of
'this is important."
And increasingly, the Daily leadership's self
criticism has centered oil stylistic concerns —
headlines, spelling, capitalization — and on
how early the paper gets off the paste-up tables
each night, rather than on news coverage
These are problems that cannot be j ustLfied by
a .ack of staff or an inexperienced one Yet ulti
mately, the Daily's attitude has consistently
teen that it is not responsible for addressing
these issues itself
Associate Editor Dan Fiduccia said recently at
the conclusion of a panel discussion on the
rights and responsibilities o* the press 1 would
suggest that you try to have more meetings like
this one invite the Daily editors to sherry hours
or whatever Unless you as it us out or come .n,
we 11 miss each other and the public will be the
Icser '
I this inexcusable
Senior history mowTranquada is a tonner
