# White convicted of voluntary manslaughter
## Jury's decision a substantial victory for White defense 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Dan White, the onetime
city supervisor, policeman and firefighter who
admitted to the City Hall slayings of Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk,
was convicted of voluntary manslaughter yester
day.
The two verdicts from the seven-woman, five
man jury were a major victory for the defense,
which had conceded that White killed the mayor
and Milk, but claimed White was mentally ill at the
time.
White shot the two men Nov. 27 after learning
Moscone would not grant his request for reap
pointment to his position as supervisor, which he
had resigned Nov. 10.
The jury deliberated for six days, returning
often to rehear evidence.
The two convictions carry a minimum prison
term of a total of about five years. White bowed
his head when the verdict on Milk was read. It
eliminated any possibility that he would face the
death penalty.
Wife weeping
Alter the verdicts were read, White looked at
his wite, Mary Ann, who was weeping in the front
row of the spectator section. At least three of the
jurors wiped tears from their eyes.
White was charged with murder in the
November 1978 shootings of his political rivals
Moscone and Milk. As the first voluntary man
slaughter verdict was read, there was a collective
gasp from the spectators in the packed 92-seat
courtroom.
The jurors had been discussing the case since
last Wednesday morning. They reheard tes
timony in the case four times and twice reheard
the legal distinctions between murder and man
slaughter.

Earlier yesterday the jury returned to the cour
troom for two hours to rehear the testimony of
Dr. Roland Levy, the only one of the five psychiat
rists to testify who said White had the mental
capacity to premeditate the killings and harbor
malice — requirements for a murder conviction.
Full command
Levy interviewed White eight hours after the
slayings and testified that White was alert and in
full command of his mental faculties.
On Sunday, the jurors reheard the testimony of
a defense psychiatrist, Dr. Martin Blinder, who
said White had suffered an "emotional collapse"
at the time of the killings.
White was considered the strongest advocate
of law and order on the 11-member Board of
Supervisors.
He was elected from a largely blue-collar
neighborhood in November 1977 and resigned
from the San Francisco Fire Department. His
$9500 annual salary as a supervisor was half of
what he was making as a firefighter.
After a year on the board, White, 32, resigned,
saying he could not support his wife and newborn
son on a supervisor's salary.
Financial assurances
Less than two weeks later, with assurances of
financial help from his 16 brothers and sisters,
White asked Moscone to reappoint him to the
board.
Although Moscone initially announced he
would reappoint White, he later changed his
mind.
The mayor was about to name Don Horanzy, a
federal official in San Francisco, as White's suc
cessor the morning of the shootings. Moscone
and Milk were shot in their offices on opposite
sides of City Hall.

White did not testify at his trial but the prosecu
tion played a tape of his 25-minute confession. He
said on the tape his mind was "in a fog" and that
he had shot Moscone when the mayor asked
about his family.
He said he ran across City Hall, wanting to see
Milk and ask him why the supervisor was oppos
ing his efforts to get his job back. Milk was shot
about a minute later.
Surrendered to police
White said he called his wife and met with her
briefly at St. Mary's Cathedral. He surrendered to
police within an hour after the killings at a nearby
police station and surrendered the gun used in
the shootings.
In her testimony, Mrs. White recalled a mar
riage troubled by her husband's almost monthly
depressions, which she said had been going on
for several years.
The defense called four psychiatrists who
examined White after the slayings. They said he
suffered from severe depression and had a di
minished mental capacity. Several witnesses tes
tified that one sign of White's increasing depres
sion was the large amount of junk food he ate.
According to court testimony, White had good
personal rapport with Moscone and Milk, the first
avowed homosexual elected to the board, but
often disagreed with them politically.
White was the only member of the board to
vote against a measure introduced by Milk to
prohibit discrimination against homosexuals in
housing and employment.
The night both men were elected to the board,
Milk said he was pleased with the political
makeup of the panel. "But Dan White — he's
going to be trouble," Milk predicted.
