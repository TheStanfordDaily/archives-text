The Daily welcomes opinions from the Stanford community. Materials should be
submitted typed, double-spaced, on a 57-space line, and should not exceed 80 to 85
lines. We reserve the right to edit for brevity, clarity and style. We are especially
interested in unusual contributions such as cartoons and in faculty opinions.
