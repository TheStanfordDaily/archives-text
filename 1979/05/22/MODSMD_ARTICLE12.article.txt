## Franklin fired for politics 
### 
In 1972, the University fired a tenured profes
sor for his political beliefs and his opposition to
the war in Vietnam.
Bruce Franklin was an associate professor of
English. Even the Advisory Board that supported
his dismissal called "his competence as a scho
lar and teacher exceptional."
But he was also a Marxist-Maoist-Leninist, of
which he reminded people often, and on the
central committee of a revolutionary organiza
tion called Venceremos, composed of Univer
sity and community people. He had a political
analysis of the war — and Stanford's role in it —
that was considerably to the left of most.
He was, in addition, charismatic and had a
following. While perhaps he might have been
forgiven for any one of those things, the combi
nation did not go down well, and he became a
painful thorn in the side of the trustees, the
administration and the Stanford establishment.
In February 1971, right atter the invasion of
Laos, with feelings against the odious war run
ning high, it came to light that two men from the
Stanford Research Institute were running a pro
ject on the Stanford computer that was directly
applicable to amphibious assault landings in
Vietnam.
Outcry
An impassioned community meeting at
tended by about 800 followed the disclosure, as
did a noon rally on White Plaza the following
day, right after which several hundred people
went to the Computer Center, and a few into the
building — without, however, doing any dam
age to the computer. An evening rally in the Old
Union Courtyard followed the police dispersal
of that demonstration.
Franklin spoke at all those rallies and was at
the Computer Center, though not in the build
ing. President Richard Lyman, claiming that
Franklin's role had been one of incitement, took
steps to have him fired.
Franklin appealed his dismissal to the Advis
ory Board, annually elected by the faculty and in
this case, at least, probably representative of

many of them, if a letter addressed to the Board
by 24 eminent earth scientists is any indication.
'Actions unimportant'
"There is little point," it said, "in quibbling
over precisely what he did or did not do on a
specific occasion. . . . We hope that the Advis
ory Board will look beyond the details of specific
actions."
Alter six weeks of hearings, 111 witnesses and
4200 pages of testimony, the Advisory Board ap
parently did just that and, in a 5-2 decision, re
commended to Lyman that Franklin indeed be
fired.
The grounds for their decision were worthy of
the advice they had received from the vigilantes
of the Geology Department.
'Rehabilitation' unlikely
"The perception of reality which Professor
Franklin and his followers profess to share dif
fers drastically from the consensus in the Uni
versity. . . . We are highly dubious whether re
habilitation (italics theirs) is a useful concept in
this case. (His) announced conviction about the
guilt of the University appears deeply held, and
his opposition to the institution in its present
form seems implacable. . . . Thus, 'rehabilita
tion' is likely to fail."
No one even claimed that Franklin had done
anything illegal, for which certainly he could,
and surely would, have been take to court.
However, no sanctions were ever profferred
against the researchers who had used the Stan
ford computer for their war game, in clear viola
tion of University rules against secret research.
Franklin took his case before the American
Civil Liberties Union, whose directors were
unanimous in the view that the speeches
Franklin had been fired for were "plainly pro
tected by the First Amendment." The ACLU took
Stanford University to court. There the case has
been desultorily dragging on for seven years,
costing the University a bundle.
