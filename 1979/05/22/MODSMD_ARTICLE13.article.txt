## Combat reverse sexism 
### 
Okay. After four years, I've
had enough. I am finally fed up
with the slanted, everyone
hating attitude of many of the
so-called "feminists" on this
campus. I am tired of the
racist-style sexism that
bunches me with all other men
as the reason why women can't
walk the streets at night.
I am tired of being told I'll
never understand abortion be
cause I'll never have a baby, or
I'll never understand rape be
cause I can't be raped.
I am tired of the self
righteous double-standard
employed by these "feminists"
in evaluating their cause as
compared to society. Frankly,
their attitude is hurting the
women's movement. It is sim
ply a form of alienating martyr
dom that drives people away
from them and the women's
cause.
To start with, it thoroughly
amazed me to read the Aurora
women's magazine about two
issues ago. This was the issue
which advocated prior re
straint, the most dangerous ab
ridgement of press freedom.

against a few Daily comic
strips for controversial por
trayal of women. This was not
Hustler style degradation of
women that we saw in Dupie,
but merely some sexual in
nuendos.
They wanted to use the
highest censorship law in the
country, one that was denied
the president of the United
States when he tried to stop
publication of the Pentagon
Papers, one recently used for
the first time in many years to
stop the printing of plans for
construction of a hydrogen
bomb, to prevent publication
of a few sexual innuendos. Ab
solutely amazing.
Sex discrimination
And in the same issue, there
was an article which de
nounced thechoiceof a man to
run the women's escort service
on campus.
Why were they upset? Not
because the man chosen was
incompetent, not because the
man chosen was a convicted
rapist, not because he was a
well-known sado-masochistic
woman beater. He was none of

these.
They objected to him simply
because he was a man. And
that's all. Just because he was
male. Can. you imagine the
outcry that would result (and
justly so) from a man saying,
"She shouldn't have that job
because she's a woman?"
Irony
That, they would scream, is
pure, criminal sexism. The
Aurora article, I scream, is also
pure, criminal sexism! The
irony (or should I say, hypoc
risy) is that sexism is what they'
are supposed/y fighting
against.
And finally, the recent outcry
against the Alpha Sig Pimp and
Prostitute Party. I have read
numerous articles decrying
them for holding a party that
degrades women.
The fact that if their attitude
prevailed here we would be
lucky to hold bingo games on
weekends without offending
them is irrelevant. What I
found to be 10 times worse
than the harmless theme of
that party was the cheap,
spray-painted vandalism proc
laiming women's slogans and
women's symbols that appeared
on the front of the house just
before the party.
That, combined with the fact
that numerous cars in the
Alpha Sig parking lot had their
mirrors broken and antennas
ripped off that night, is the real
crime of the party. Why did no
one speak out against that?
Why was everyone silent
about someone forcing their
ideas on other people in the
name of the women's move
ment, yet outcry large at the
non-compulsory attendance of
the party? There is something
very wrong with the basic at
titudes of some people on this
campus.
By all means, the attitudes of
the so-called "feminists" and
of the people who stooped to
petty vandalism are a minority
here. The sad part is that they
are the most vocal.
I do not condemn women by
any means. What I say to them
is this: do not sit by silently and
let these attitudes be pinned
on you by default. Don't let
them speak for all women on
campus, as they seem to be
doing now. Do not let them
alienate a majority of men, and
many women against your
cause â€” there are many of us
who do support you, and many
more who would once they
stop getting treated like crimi
nals.
There are many who care,
but won't give their time while
they are continually told they
are part of the problem, and
therefore their help is not
wanted.
This attitude is counter
productive to everyone in
volved. Put some sense of
humor back in the feminist at
titude here. Maybe even have
it start practicing what it
preaches. It just might start
getting somewhere on campus
then.
