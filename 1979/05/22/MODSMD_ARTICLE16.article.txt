### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Rock star Mick Jagger, de
scribed in court yesterday as "one of the r-chest
entertainers on earth," was ordered to pay his
wife, Bianca, $12,000 in temporary support for
her and their child while the couple's divorce
suit criss-crosses the world.
Superior Court judge Harry Shafer, saying he
would wait for a British court's action in the case
next month, deferred a hearing on the support
issue until June 8.
"In the interim, Mr. Jagger will pay directly to
Mrs. Jagger by Tuesday, May 29, the sum of
$12,000 pi us itemized medical bills nottoexceed
$2500," the judge declared.
Mrs. Jagger, who injured her knee in a recent
roller-skating accident, raised the issue of medi
cal bills. The Nicaraguan-born actress leaned
heavily on a cane as she entered the courtroom.
Shafer also ordered Jagger to deposit $35,000
with his attorney before the next hearing to in
sure that Mrs. Jagger's attorney fees will be paid.
Her attorneys, Marvin Mitchelson and Harold
Rhoden, said their fees will probably be closer
to $100,000, at a rate of $125 an hour.
Much of their time, they said, will be spent
trying to prove that Jagger has about $20 million
in assets scattered around the world.
His attorney, Arthur Groman, said the lead

singer of the Rolling Stones has assets of only $4
million.
"We have here one of the richest entertainers
on earth," Rhoden told the judge, "a man worth
at least $20 million . . . This man because of his
wealth has the power to hide money all over the
world."
The lawyer said he plans to subpoena financial
records in several countries to show Jagger's
true wealth.
Meanwhile, Groman said he would file an ap
peal in Jagger's behalf seeking to overtrm Judge
Shafer's ruling that California has jurisdiction in
the Jagger divorce case.
However, the judge has said he would yield
jurisdiction if the British High Court decides the
case can be tried there. A hearing on that issue is
scheduled in London in July.
The lawyers representing the Jaggers have
been dashing by jet between London and Los
Angeles courts since February when Mrs. Jagger
sought to transfer the divorce case here, where
liberal community property laws could give her
a large share of Jagger's fortune.
Mrs. lagger is seeking half of $25 million, her
estimate of Jagger's income during their seven
year marriage. Mrs. Jagger has custody of their
seven-year-old daughter, Jade.
