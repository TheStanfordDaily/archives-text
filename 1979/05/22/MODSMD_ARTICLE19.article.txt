## Jackson sparkles, refreshes 
### 
I atest U.K. fave rave, Joe Jackson, debuted
at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco last Mon
day night. He and his band delivered a tun,
exciting set of music that succeeded in leav
ing the audience "bleeding from the ears and
witless," as he had promised.
I he attractive sound of Joe Jackson's band
defies simple categorization. It's clean, quick
and upbeat, mixing the simple, energetic
quality of early rock and roll (a la Chuck Berry
and Eats Domino) with the syncopation of
reggae. In concert, the rhythmic precision of
the music (the hard-working drummer claims
most credit here) was especially impressive.
Ihe guitarist's no-frills playing carved sharp
edges, while the bass wasn't quite funky
enough to match the solid drumming.
Despite a less than ideal mix (too much
echo on Jackson's mike and too loud overall),
the band's songs came across clear and
strong. The musicians charged through all
the numbers but one from their LP, Look
Sharp, three new songs and an amusing
piano ditty called "Life is Just a Bowl of Cher
ries.'' "Look Sharp," "Sunday Papers," and
the twisted pop song, "Is She Really Going
Out With Him?" (which starts, "Pretty
women out walking with gorillas down my
street") were some of the show's highlights.
Ihe reggae-infused tempo and clever lyrics
of "Eools in Love" also showed off Jackson's
talents.
|oe Jackson himself is as ordinary an eccen

trie as anyone England's music scene has spit
up in recent years. His witty, mean, self
mocking approach to the everyday subjects
of modern lite puts him in league with such
singer-songwriters as Elvis Costello and
Graham Parker. However, he lacks Costello's
hostile condemnation of the world and
Parker's painful sensitivity that man can't
have things the way he wants.
Jackson distinguished himself most on
Monday by chatting glibly with the crowd and
singing with more force and expression than
on his slickly-produced album. The guy was
funny and engaging, and obviously felt at
home on stage. Unfortunately, a recent leg
injury forced him to sing seated on a stool,
thus reducing his usual leaping about to frus
trated head jerks.
The audience's roaring standing ovation
proved it didn't care if lackson had to sing
lying in bed in traction. It received him
more like a returning star than a newcomer,
barely allowing the band to leave the stage
before their encore. Only for these last three
rollicking numbers did people dance, as they
should have done throughout the show. It
wasn't their fault, really, but that of the club's
management, which insists on restricting
their patrons' pleasure by cramming custom
ers into a maze of tables and chairs. It some
one in the city ever opens a decent-sized
venue with some room to dance, fans might
finally be able to enjoy live music properly.
