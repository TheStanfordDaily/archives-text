# S.F. gays hold violent protest

San Francisco (AP) — A rioting
crowd of 5000 people — many of
them homosexual — stormed the
doors of City Hall last night, smash
ing glass with iron bars and setting
fires to protest the voluntary man
slaughter conviction of Dan White
for the slayings of the late mayor and
a supervisor.
Dozens of riot-equipped police
began a counterattack on the crowd
shortly after 10 p.m. and pushed the
demonstrators away from the front
steps into Polk Street and Civic
Center Plaza just beyond. A cloud of
tear gas drifted over the melee, but it
was not immediately known who
fired it.
Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, who
was inside the building, was struck in
the mouth by a rock thrown from
outside the building. Her condition
was not known.
Many of the rioters sat down in the
middle of the street. Blood could be
seen on the heads and faces of some
people.
Incendiary devices were hurled
through broken windows into the
basement of the besieged building
and policemen with fire extin
guishers put out one fire.
Officers inside City Hall used over
turned tables as shields to protect
themselves from flying rocks.
When the mob reached City Hall as
the sun began to set, the vanguard of
the crowd, several hundred strong,

broke several glass panels in the
heavy doors as helmeted police of
ficers moved in to protect the ornate
domed building.
On the night of the slayings last
Nov. 27 an estimated 25,000 people
staged a candlelight procession to
City Hall.
Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who was
named to replace Moscone and later
won election to the post, said the
decision by a jury of seven women
and five men was "very hard to
handle."
'Look at law'
"As I look at the law, this was a
murder — two murders," she said.
The verdict, she added, resulted
from "flawed laws. The big problem
is to get the legislature to take
another look at diminished capacity.
"But nothing that the jury had
done would bring back the life of
Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk,"
she said. "The important thing is for
this town to put itself back together
again "
Douglas Schmidt, White's attor
ney, said he was "glad that the jury
came in with that verdict." He had
asked the jury for the verdict they
returned.
With tears welling in his eyes,
Schmidt said, "I don't know that it
(the verdict) was all that improbable.
I felt it was what the evidence
showed."
