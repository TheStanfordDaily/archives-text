## Chekhov's 'Seagull' provocative 
### 
The Seagull is an ambitious
play lor college students to do.
Taking this into consideration,
the Drama Dept. must be con
gratulated on their production,
which opened last week at the
little Theater.
Credit for the success of the
show is clue, at least in part, to
its author, Anton Chekhov.
Dealing profoundly with such
themes as self-destruction,
jealousy, love, the purpose of
life and the nature of art and of
artists, the play achieves not
only intellectual, but emo
tional depth.
Although Stanford's cast
may not convey a great deal of
Chekhov's between-the-lines
emotion, it does make the
play comprehensible, believa
ble and provocative, a task
which has been known to
elude even professional com
panies. Largely responsible lor
the production's credibility are
the outstanding performances
of Jacqueline Bryan, Molly.
Mayock and Tom Engelman.
Bryan plays the role of Marya
llyinishna Shamraeva, a
woman "in mourning for (her)
life,' with tremendous depth
and compassion. Her long, in
tense stares, as well as her
genuine delivery, make clear
the fact that she completely
understands the character of
Marya. The performance of
Mayock, as Arkadina, is equally
convincing. Able to portray
both Arkadina's warm, mater

nal side and her bitter, jealous
side, Mayock also adds a wel
come touch of humor to the
role of the aging actress.
Another master of humor, Tom
Engelman, gives a brilliant re
ndition of the young writer,
Treplev. His consistently sin
cere performance makes his
compulsive act of self destruc
tion, at the end of the play,
both believable and powerful.
Other performances deserv
ing praise include those of
Anthony Grumbach as the ear
nest Medvedenko, Luke Bania
as Sorin, and Bill Herring as
Yakov. Pamela Minet in (he
part of Nina, Malcolm Young as
Trigorin, and Andrea Stang
playing Polina, are tairly con
vincing in their roles; but they
are victims of the choice of
show. Minet, as perhaps the
majority of those her age, does
not seem to understand the
despair of Nina's final speech.
By the same token, there are
lew, if any, college students
who have experienced the
frustration of Trigorin, an aging
writer, or that of Polina, an
overconcerned mother. In any
case, the cast and the director,
Tim Sanford, must be credited
with making The Seagull an in
teresting play and a play which
is not, as is often believed, in
comprehensible.
The sets also make the play
interesting. Although at first I
wondered what a shocking
pink and turquoise landscape

was doing in a production of
Chekhov, the lake and sky in
the background changes col
ors throughout the show to
correspond to the mood ot the
play and the internal states of
the characters. William Eddel
man's set design and Peter
Maradudin's lighting design
both do a good job in de
monstrating the importance of
nature in the play. However,
one attempt to connect exter
nal forces with Ireplev's
suicide seems extremely cont
rived. This is the set piece up
stage center which serves no
function whatsoever until
Treplev in a final, despairing
moment, opens its curtains to
reveal the lake. This piece,
however, is an exception to an
otherwise credible and intelli
gent production.
Altogether, The Seagull,
playing today through Satur
day in the L ittle Theater, is well
worth seeing.
