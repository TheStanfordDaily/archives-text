## the 						company/martha manqueros 'Hair' confronts an audience, an era 
### 
"Alright, tonight is going to be complete
contusion. You're probably already aware
of that," shouts Peter Maradudin, Hair's
technical and band director. I he energetic
cast of 24 stands quietly for the first time
during this tech rehearsal. Although Cuh
berley's stage has been extended 12 feet, it
still is crowded. But the stage doesn't con
fine the cast.
Douglas Greenfield, one of the actors,
said, "This show is going to be particularly
effective because we can tit i5O people in
here so that no one is very far away. We've
closed off the balcony for that reason. The
audience is going to be constantly involved.
The person sitting there," he pointed to a
seat in the middle of the auditorium, "is
going to be as involved as the people on
stage. We violate personal space."
"That's right," said Alllan Rivlin, the
show's director/producer. "We confront
our audience physically as well as men
tally. We circle them, walk and fly over
them."
When asked about the recent release of
the film, hlair, Rivlin said, "We had no
knowledge that the movie was coming out
when we (The Company) decided to put
on the show. The movie is good, very
good, but it's as close to the play as Sgl.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is to
Beatles music.
"The advantage ot theater," Rivlin con
tinued, "is the interaction between actors
and audience that is impossible with film.
We are trying to get back what the play first
gave us; trying to teach our audience;
show them what we lost of that era and
what still remains." .
Most college students are familiar with
Hair's songs, such as "Let The Sun Shine
In," "Aquarius" and "Easy To Be Hard."
Ihe action involves a tribe of young people
who are dealing with social mores and
taboos in I%H. Claude, the spiritual leader
ot this tribe of hippies, is drafted. His con
fusion about his relationship with the
tribe, his best friend, Berger, and this so
cial edict is the basis of the plot.
Greenfield said, "We're singing songs
that we can very nearly relate to. We've
had brothers and sisters who went
through this. The appeal ot Hair is that we
barely missed it."
Dan Gunther, who plays Berger, the
dynamic leader ot Hair's tribe, elaborated:
" I hough the show is a period piece, some
of the messages are more relevant now
than before. As a matter of fact, we'd like
to thank Pete McCloskey for helping us."

Drue Bralove, one of the show's female
leads, stresses the importance of Hair's
statements over plot. There are about'so
songs in the show and often five or six
songs in a row with no dialogue. "Part of
the show," Bralove said, "is being with
these people from all different
backgrounds gathering in a tribe and hav
ing fun. We talk about freedoms â€” free
dom of speech, dress, sexuality, drugs. . .
Hair much more makes a statement than
follows a plot."
lon Parker, a tribe member, said, "The
best thing about this show is that it is made
up of fairly different Stanford students,
those on the fringe." Rivlin agreed: "We
went for honesty (in casting) over talent
and were pleasantly surprised when we
got both. We've got a lot of real hippies in
the show."
In his comments on the stark set,
producer/director Todd Harris captured
the expansive attitude of the cast and
crew: "We'ie not hiding the lights. We're
leaving the scaffolding alone." He swept
His arm outward, "We've made the entire
auditorium our stage."
(The Company presents Hairon May 23 to
26 in Cubberley Auditorium. Tickets are
$2.)
