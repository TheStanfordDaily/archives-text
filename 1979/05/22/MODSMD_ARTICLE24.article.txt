# Lattimore reflects on McCarthy years
## 
### Alisa Terrell 
Owen Lattimore, a major target of
Minnesota Sen. Joseph McCarthy's
purge of American "Communists" in
the 19505, told an audience of ap
proximately 75 people in Braun Au
ditorium last Thursday night that the
post-World War II situation was ideal
for an ambitious politician to stir up
hostility and fear among the Ameri
can people.
The "loss" of Eastern Europe and
China to communism laid the United
States open to a backlash of ideolog
ical warfare and hostility, Lattimore
said. Americans, who had never
been exposed to a domesticated
form of Marxism, were especially
vulnerable to the fears created by
McCarthy's accusations.
These accusations began in the last
days of the Truman administration,
when McCarthy charged that there
were 205 Communists in the State
Dept.
Lattimore, an author and historian
who had been actively involved in
Asian affairs since the 19205, is an
expert on China. He was appointed
political adviser to Chinese leader
Chiang Kai-shek in 1941, and has
done research for several academic
institutions.
Accusations
McCarthy originally accused Lat
timore of being the "top Soviet agent
in the United States" in March 1950.
Then McCarthy launched a series of
accusations against Lattimore that
lasted for five years.
However, Lattimore downplayed
his involvement in the McCarthy era,
saying that he was only knocked out

of circulation for five years, and still
received pay from his job.
"There were hundreds,
thousands, whose careers were to
tally blighted," he said.
He expressed concern for the re
viving interest in the McCarthy era.
"I'm afraid this revival will lead to a
distortion of the facts that will alter
the real proportions of the era," Lat
timore said.
'Real fight'
Lattimore said he lamented the fact
that during the whole McCarthy
period, "nobody put up a real fight."
The State Dept. and the newspapers
"played it safe.
"Investigative journalism col
lapsed like a flat tire. Even the press
could be attacked."
University researchers and profes
sors, especially those focusing on
Asia, were also accused of being
Communists. Persons who might ad
vocate controversial opinions were
not hired, or not promoted, accord
ing to Lattimore, while the univer
sities looked for professors who
would not cause trouble.
This "play it safe" policy had long
lasting effects that were even more
serious than the immediate sensa
tional effects of the McCarthy era, he
said. Second-rate, non-controversial
professors sitting at the heads of de
partments don't appoint first-raters
to jobs, Lattimore said.
Lattimore's speech was part of the
spring lecture series on McCar
thyism sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and the Center for
East Asian Studies.
