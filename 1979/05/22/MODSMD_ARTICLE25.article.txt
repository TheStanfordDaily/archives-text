Panel offers nuclear report
Washington — The chairman of a House inquiry
into the Three Mile Island nuclear accident said
yesterday the same type mishap "is likely at any
time" at another nuclear power plant.
Rep. James Weaver (D-Ore.) made the assertion
in presenting a report by his panel suggesting that
equipment and instrument failure played a much
greater role in the March 28accident than operator
error.
Central findings of the task force report were
that:
— Instruments that could have given control
room operators a clear indication of what was
happening were either nonexistent or in
adequately calibrated.
— Operators followed prescribed procedures
during the first hours of the accident based on the
best information available to them — even though
these procedures turned out to be inappropriate
under the circumstances.
— A pressure relief valve stuck in the open posi
tion was probably the single most serious malfunc
tion, but conflicting information reaching the con
trol room delayed a diagnosis of the problem for
more than two hours.
— An emergency core cooling system that had
turned on automatically was throttled back
dramatically, contributing to reactor overheating.
Florida Court allows executions
Tallahassee, Fla. — The Florida Supreme Court
refused yesterday to delay the executions of con
victed murderers John Spenkelink and Willie Dar
den.
After a lengthy private meeting, the justices
unanimously refused to stay Spenkelink's execu
tion. The> denied Darden's appeal 4-3.
Spenkelink faces electrocution at 4 a.m. PDT
tomorrow and Darden one hour later in Florida's
heavy oak electricchair — a three-legged seat built
by inmates, with arms deeply gouged by the strug
gles of the convicts who died in it.
Meanwhile, in New Orleans, an emergency ap
peal was hand-delivered to the sth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Spenkelink's behalf. The peti
tion asked the court to overrule U.S. District Judge
William Stafford, who refused to delay the execu
tion earlier in the day.
Robert Harper Jr., lawyer for Darden, 45, also
pursued various appeals, including one to a Bar
tow, Fla. judge who sentenced him.
Darden's attorneys contended in their brief to
Florida's highest court that the clemency process,
in which the state Cabinet considered whether to
commute the sentence to life, had denied their
client due process of law. The state Supreme
Court majority said that motion was without merit.

Some gas lines shrink
Los Angeles — The long gas station lines that
clogged California streets and frustrated drivers
during the last three weeks shrank dramatically
yesterday. In some areas, there was no wait.
"It may be that there is less panic by motorists,"
said attorney Jim Carroll of Anaheim, a spokesman
for the Southern California Service Station Dealers
Association. "Perhaps it took a week of odd-even
to bring the situation under control."
But there was no certain reason for the suddenly
not-so-long lines and nobody knew if they would
remain.
"We're not pumping any more gas than before,
so I don't know what the reason is," said Juan
Mendoza at a Mobil station in Huntington Beach,
south of Los Angeles. "But the line is only about a
block long. Last week, lines were three, four, even
five blocks long."
Meanwhile, state officials, including energy
commission Chairman Richard Maullin, planned
to meet with Los Angeles enforcement officials
yesterday to discuss a crackdown on the odd-even
rationing regulations.
Earlier, Attorney General George Deukmejian
stressed the difficulty of enforcing the rationing,
in which motorists buy gas on alternate days, de
pending on whether the last number of their
license plates is odd or even.
Oil firms deny withholding gas
Washington — Oil company executives denied
yesterday withholding gasoline from the market to
await higher prices and blamed the nation's
gasoline squeeze on a lack of crude oil.
Administration spokesmen testifying before a
congressional committee blamed tight crude oil
supplies on unrest in the Mideast.
And White House press secretary Jody Powell
said Congress was primarily responsible for the
nation's current gasoline problems and that Presi
dent Jimmy Carter was getting too much of the
blame.
Deputy Energy Secretary John O'Leary told a
Senate hearing that shortages may be eased
somewhat if Iran increases its oil production. He
said there is a chance Iran might export an addi
tional 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day to the United
States.
But such an increase, O'Leary added, would
only make the country "more comfortable" in a
time of continuing shortage.
O'Leary and executives of five major oil com
panies testitied before a Senate Energy subcom
mittee studying the present shortages.
Europeans fault U.S. oil use
Paris — European energy ministers yesterday
accused the United States of guzzling the world's
oil resources and warned of serious economic

consequences if oil shortages persist.
U.S. Secretary for Energy James Schlesingertold
accusers at a meeting of ministers from 20 indust
rial nations they would have to be patient until
America resolved the debate as to "whether or not
there is a real problem with regard to oil."
The ministers were meeting as members of the
International Energy Agency, an organization in
tended as a sort of Western counterweight to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The United States is a member of the organization.
In a toughly worded speech, released outside
the closed-door session, Cuido Brunner, energy
commissioner of the European Economic Com
munity, charged that Americans were consuming
twice as much oil per person as Europeans.
