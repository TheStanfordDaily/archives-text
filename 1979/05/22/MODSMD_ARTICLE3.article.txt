# Michigan beaten 7-2 in NCAA tennis action
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
The Stanford men's tennis team
took the first step in its quest to win
its third straight NCAA crown by
knocking off Michigan yesterday,
7-2, in Athens, Ga.
Tim Mayotte's comeback victory
over Michael Leach 6-7, 6-4, 6-2 gave
the Cards a 4-2 lead going into the
doubles.
Even then, though, it wasn't easy.
It took first-set tiebreaker wins by the
teams of Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne and Mayotte and |eff Arons
and a three-set win by Scott Bondur
ant and Jim Hodges to sweep the
doubles and clinch the match for the
Cards.
Jeff Etterbeek, ranked sixteenth in
the May 3 college polls, scored a mild
upset over Rennert in the number
one singles, ending the Card netter's
seven-match winning streak. The
only other Michigan win came when
Peter Oster clobbered Arons 6-1,6-1.
Hodges had a big day, recovering
trom a winless weekend against
UCLA and USC with a 6-2, 7-6 singles
triumph and a three-set doubles win
with Bondurant.
The Cards now face Princeton,
ranked twelfth but upset winners
over fifth-ranked Arkansas. The
match went down to the final point of
the third-set tiebreaker before
Princeton's top team of Jay Lapidus

and Leif Shiras was able to pull it out
for the Tigers, advancing them to the
quarterfinals today.
Lapidus will be slowed down some
by a sprained ankle in his number
one singles match with Rennert, a
slight favorite.
Bourne will have his hands full
with Shiras, who was ranked thir
teenth in the May 3 college polls.
Bourne is unranked.
Another key match will be bet
ween Mayotte and Tiger Steve Meis
ter, who jointly share the number-40
rankings.
The Cards, however, are much
stronger than Princeton down the
line and should advance to the semi
finals and meet the winner of the
UCLA-Pepperdine match tomorrow.
If the Cards emerge victorious, they
will join UCLA and USC as the only
teams to ever win three consecutive
national tennis titles.
