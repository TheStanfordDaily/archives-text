# Lomita construction postponed by Lyman

### Brad Brockbank 
Construction of the proposed
Lomita Drive extension, scheduled
to begin this summer, will be post
poned "pending clarification of sev
eral questions," President Richard
Lyman said yesterday in a memo to
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy.
The Lomita extension was in
tended to divert traffic from Mayfield
by the Robert Moore houses to
Lomita Drive, which would then in
tersect Campus Drive, allowing the
conversion of Mayfield to a pedest
rian mall.
According to Massy, it is probably
the case that nothing will happen (at
the Lomita site) until after Campus
Drive West is completed, which he
said could be "a year or two or
more."
If Campus Drive West is com
pleted, Massy said, the data on traffic
patterns for that road will be
analyzed to see if there is still a need
to construct the Lomita extension.
But if Campus Drive West doesn't go
through, Massy added, the Univer
sity will have to "reassess" the
Lomita plan.
Dirt access road
Campus Drive West, currently a
dirt access road to lunipero Serra
which flanks the golf driving range,
has previously been considered for
extension by the University. Stu
dents opposed to Lomita's extension
have claimed that Campus Drive
West could be developed to accom
modate the University's traffic

needs.
In the memo, Lyman said several
considerations brought about his
decision, including letters from stu
dents — one of which bore 600 signa
tures — opposing the extension.
Lyman noted that the most com
pelling reason in favor of the exten
sion has been to alleviate the safety
problems associated with the 90-
degree corner on Mayfield Avenue.
Proponents of the plan claim that the
Lomita extension, coupled with the
closure of Mayfield in front of the
Row houses, would provide a safe
mall for the large number of bicyc
lists and pedestrians who use
Mayfield each day.
In his memo, however, Lyman
pointed out that "the straightaway
provided by (the Lomita Drive exten
sion) and the problems of visibility —
indeed the problems associated with
automobile drivers having less ex
pectation of having to watch for
pedestrians and bicyclists — leave
me unpersuaded that in terms of
safety there is a very clear advantage
in favor of the proposed construc
tion."
The president also wrote that he
thought it "somewhat imprudent" to
invest $273,000 in construction of a
road "whose precise future is un
known."
Lyman conceded that the prop
osed Mayfield Mall would be a net
improvement at the University and
said he was "somewhat less impre
ssed with the bucolic splendors of
the vacant lands adjacent to the lake
cluster of fraternities and dor
mitories" than some students who
wrote to him on that subject.
Lyman said that one basketball
court, "allegedly much prized, has
weeds growing up in the cracks of
the pavement, and both uprights for
basketball are lying splintered on the
ground."
Lyman concluded, however, that
the proposed expenditure is "con
siderable in times of austere budgets
throughout the University, and I
think that the case for proceeding

would have to be more unambigu
ously powerful before we could jus
tify acting upon it."
Alpha Delt Scott Martin, who had
opposed the planned extension,
termed the decision "good news,"
saying that he was "pleased with
the way Lyman handled it.
"We who live here are more famil
iar with the situation and through our
efforts we helped Lyman become
more aware of the questions in
volved."
Martin said he hoped the Alpha
Delts would be informed of further
developments.

pectation of having to watch for
pedestrians and bicyclists — leave
me unpersuaded that in terms of
safety there is a very clear advantage
in favor of the proposed construc
tion."
The president also wrote that he
thought it "somewhat imprudent" to
invest $273,000 in construction of a
road "whose precise future is un
known."
Lyman conceded that the prop
osed Mayfield Mall would be a net
improvement at the University and
said he was "somewhat less impre
ssed with the bucolic splendors of
the vacant lands adjacent to the lake
cluster of fraternities and dor
mitories" than some students who
wrote to him on that subject.
Lyman said that one basketball
court, "allegedly much prized, has
weeds growing up in the cracks of
the pavement, and both uprights for
basketball are lying splintered on the
ground."
Lyman concluded, however, that
the proposed expenditure is "con
siderable in times of austere budgets
throughout the University, and I
think that the case for proceeding

would have to be more unambigu
ously powerful before we could jus
tify acting upon it."
Alpha Delt Scott Martin, who had
opposed the planned extension,
termed the decision "good news,"
saying that he was "pleased with
the way Lyman handled it.
"We who live here are more famil
iar with the situation and through our
efforts we helped Lyman become
more aware of the questions in
volved."
Martin said he hoped the Alpha
Delts would be informed of further
developments.
