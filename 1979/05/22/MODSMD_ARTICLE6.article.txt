						'60s campus retrospective
## Protests marked by non-violent commitment 
### Hank Duderstadt 
It could easily have been a recent demonstra
tion, considering its modest beginnings as a
rally in White Plaza.
Vet it culminated with the roar of a thousand
voices as a crowd stormed the guarded doors of
Encina Hall, seizing the administrative center
there.
The date was May 1, 1969, the time was 1:05
a.m., the turmoil was caused by the war in Viet
nam — and the draft.
The spring of 1969 was replete with news of
protests and violence throughout the Bay Area
as college students banded together to de
monstrate against the war.
)oel Smith, then dean of student affairs, de
scribed the air as electric with emotion. Anti
draft rallies in White Plaza attracted crowds
numbering in the thousands. Radical
ideologies and political beliefs opposed to the
war spawned such groups as the April Third
Movement and the Young Americans for Free
dom.
Protest movement
Although Stanford was part of the protest
movements, it was not part of the violence,
according to Robert Beyers, director of Univer
sity News service, who covered many of the
demonstrations of the '60s and 70s.
The thing that had been very apparent and
very distinctive about Stanford was the com
mitment still quite strong to non-violence,"
Beyers said.

Vet with the end of the Vietnam War and
selective service, a change came over the cam
pus.
It simply is a tact that the protest movement
was a faint facsimile of itself when selective
service ended," Smith said.
The early 70s also marked the beginning of
bombing as a tactic, which had an adverse ef
fect on the vigor of the protest movement,
Beyers said.
Bombing constant
"The bombing that was constant in 1970 was a
key element. It robbed the movement of its
moral authority," he said.
These two events combined to cut the
number of students involved in the protest
movements drastically, leading Smith to say,
"I've never seen a cultural change so dramatic
as between 1970-71 and 1973-74."
Economic factors also played a role in this
change. Students began to recognize the
bleakness of the job market and began to turn
back to books and working toward careers.
Attitude changes were important as well, ac
cording to Smith.
"There came a generation of students in the
early 70s who were the brothers and sisters of
people who had been damaged by the '60s. Not
necessarily the war," Smith said.
"There came a generation . . . who ... at
least knew of casualties and they turned to a
straighter, more secure course," he said.
However, Smith added that, "I simply don't

accept the assertion that students were more
moral and idealistic (then) than today's stu
dents. I think what's different is the way
idealism is expressed today.
The fact is that it is expressed in more mod
erate ways and strategies that consider the
longerterm, often in private and individualistic
as contrasted to mass or collectivistic ways.
That doesn't mean it isn't idealism."
Beyers added that things today are not all that
different from the early '60s in many ways, citing
the manner in which many of those involved in
the anti-apartheid sit-in aligned themselves
with the early civil rights movement.
In the draft movement here I see analogies
to approximately 1964-65," he said.
Movements forming
He explained that many of the movements
forming now seem to be repeating the early
movements of the '60s in their goals and are
almost light-hearted like those of that period.
"There wasn't the bitterness that emerged in
1968-/0, he said, but explained that things are
already changing.
"It would not surprise me at all to see the
tone of the protests get much sharper," Beyers
said.
Yet, there are many differences. "A lot of
people say today is like the '50s and I flatly
disagree with that. I say that to the extent there
was apathy in the '50s it was apathy based on
consent. Today's apathy, to the extent that it
exists, is based on cynicism," he said.
