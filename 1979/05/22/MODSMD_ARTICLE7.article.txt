# The 						Stanford Daily OPINIONS
## Manfred Bahmann Gayness only one of many sins 
### 
The response (Daily, May 15) by the Re
verend Bo Reahard to Arthur Slepian's re
flections on "Gay Awareness Week" ( Daily
May 7) is a tragic-comical piece of work.
Reahard's argument is ridiculous enough
so that one feels inclined in a typical Stan
ford fashion to toss it into the next trash
can with the customary shrug of shoul
ders: "Here goes another one of those
nutty fanatics!"
And yet, it is also a human tragedy — an
unhealthy mixture of biblical halt-truths
and slipshod scholarship which ultimately
lead to unbridled bigotry.
Reahard states that "in the Book of Ro
mans and elsewhere homosexuality is
specifically set forth as contrary to God's
will for decent human behavior." This
statement is the result of a very superficial
way of reading the Bible. It is another one
of the many examples where Paul is
quoted completely out of context.
In the first chapter of Romans, Paul in
deed refers explicitly to homosexuality.
But all along, he also makes very explicit
references to many other forms of human
behavior which he considers to be deviant
and which abound among us.
His list includes such things one can run
into every day on the Stanforo campus as
"heartlessness, ruthlessness, insolence,
haughtiness, boastfulness, foolishness,
faithlessness and disobedience to pa
rents."
Not only violation
Far from specifically setting forth
homosexuality as the one single violation

of God's will, Paul comes to the final con
clusion: "Therefore you have no excuse,
whoever you are, when you judge
another; for in passing judgment upon
him you condemn yourself, because you,
the judge, are doing the very same things"
(Romans 2:1). Obviously, Reahard did not
read Paul's letter to the Romans long
enough to discover that in condemning
gays he is condemning himself.
Reahard's reference to the Masters and
Johnson report contains additional startl
ing surprises which must be substantiated
before they can be generally believed and
accepted. The claim Masters and Johnson
made in their recent report is that all
human sexual behavior is learned,
whether it be homo- or hetero-sexual.
But nowhere in their report do Masters
and Johnson set forth a specific form of
human behavior as consonant with God's
will for decent human behavior.
Others differ
Masters and Johnson, however, do not
have a monopoly on judging and control
ling human sexual behavior — at least not
from a Christian perspective. Additional
scientific research by socio-biologists in
dicates that some forms of homosexual
behavior are genetic. So it is a matter of
whose research one is to accept.
Reahard offers his help to "anyone who
has been deceived into being a homosex
ual." But he does not disclose what qual
ifications he has for making such an offer.
Nor does he tell us which church or de
nomination he represents. This informa

tion is important not only for anyone in
terested in taking him up on his offer, but
also for the rest of us.
In our campus congregation at Univer
sity Lutheran Church, openly declared
hetereosexuals and homosexuals live side
by side, in full honesty with one another.
We know that we are all sinners and by the
grace of Cod, we also believe at the same
time occasionally to be saints as we struggle
and wrestle with the real evils in our world,
such as greed, the lust for power and
domination, the perversion of truth, and
the many other forms by which the "prin
cipalities" of this world try to rule and
manipulate our own lives and life on this
planet in general.
Where should they go?
Since Reahard has made an explicit call
on the members of our congregation to
quit their affiliation with this particular
worshiping community on campus, I
would like to know to which group he
intends to lead them and what would hap
pen to them there.
One thing is certain, however. His
prayer that this may be the last "Gay
Awareness Week" on the Stanford cam
pus will not be fulfilled. It is not a prayer
offered in the spirit of Christ.
This Reverend lists himself also as a bus
iness student. This gives rise to the hope
that he does not intend to carry out a pro
fessional ministry full time. Thanks be to
God!

another; for in passing judgment upon
him you condemn yourself, because you,
the judge, are doing the very same things"
(Romans 2:1). Obviously, Reahard did not
read Paul's letter to the Romans long
enough to discover that in condemning
gays he is condemning himself.
Reahard's reference to the Masters and
Johnson report contains additional startl
ing surprises which must be substantiated
before they can be generally believed and
accepted. The claim Masters and Johnson
made in their recent report is that all
human sexual behavior is learned,
whether it be homo- or hetero-sexual.
But nowhere in their report do Masters
and Johnson set forth a specific form of
human behavior as consonant with God's
will for decent human behavior.
Others differ
Masters and Johnson, however, do not
have a monopoly on judging and control
ling human sexual behavior — at least not
from a Christian perspective. Additional
scientific research by socio-biologists in
dicates that some forms of homosexual
behavior are genetic. So it is a matter of
whose research one is to accept.
Reahard offers his help to "anyone who
has been deceived into being a homosex
ual." But he does not disclose what qual
ifications he has for making such an offer.
Nor does he tell us which church or de
nomination he represents. This informa

tion is important not only for anyone in
terested in taking him up on his offer, but
also for the rest of us.
In our campus congregation at Univer
sity Lutheran Church, openly declared
hetereosexuals and homosexuals live side
by side, in full honesty with one another.
We know that we are all sinners and by the
grace of Cod, we also believe at the same
time occasionally to be saints as we struggle
and wrestle with the real evils in our world,
such as greed, the lust for power and
domination, the perversion of truth, and
the many other forms by which the "prin
cipalities" of this world try to rule and
manipulate our own lives and life on this
planet in general.
Where should they go?
Since Reahard has made an explicit call
on the members of our congregation to
quit their affiliation with this particular
worshiping community on campus, I
would like to know to which group he
intends to lead them and what would hap
pen to them there.
One thing is certain, however. His
prayer that this may be the last "Gay
Awareness Week" on the Stanford cam
pus will not be fulfilled. It is not a prayer
offered in the spirit of Christ.
This Reverend lists himself also as a bus
iness student. This gives rise to the hope
that he does not intend to carry out a pro
fessional ministry full time. Thanks be to
God!

The response (Daily, May 15) by the Re
verend Bo Reahard to Arthur Slepian's re
flections on "Gay Awareness Week" ( Daily
May 7) is a tragic-comical piece of work.
Reahard's argument is ridiculous enough
so that one feels inclined in a typical Stan
ford fashion to toss it into the next trash
can with the customary shrug of shoul
ders: "Here goes another one of those
nutty fanatics!"
And yet, it is also a human tragedy — an
unhealthy mixture of biblical halt-truths
and slipshod scholarship which ultimately
lead to unbridled bigotry.
Reahard states that "in the Book of Ro
mans and elsewhere homosexuality is
specifically set forth as contrary to God's
will for decent human behavior." This
statement is the result of a very superficial
way of reading the Bible. It is another one
of the many examples where Paul is
quoted completely out of context.
In the first chapter of Romans, Paul in
deed refers explicitly to homosexuality.
But all along, he also makes very explicit
references to many other forms of human
behavior which he considers to be deviant
and which abound among us.
His list includes such things one can run
into every day on the Stanforo campus as
"heartlessness, ruthlessness, insolence,
haughtiness, boastfulness, foolishness,
faithlessness and disobedience to pa
rents."
Not only violation
Far from specifically setting forth
homosexuality as the one single violation

of God's will, Paul comes to the final con
clusion: "Therefore you have no excuse,
whoever you are, when you judge
another; for in passing judgment upon
him you condemn yourself, because you,
the judge, are doing the very same things"
(Romans 2:1). Obviously, Reahard did not
read Paul's letter to the Romans long
enough to discover that in condemning
gays he is condemning himself.
Reahard's reference to the Masters and
Johnson report contains additional startl
ing surprises which must be substantiated
before they can be generally believed and
