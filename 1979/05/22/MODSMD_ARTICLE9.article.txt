Halt Lomita!
This is a protest letter. It is a
letter to protest the process of
implementing the building of a
road extention at Stanford
University. A project which has
no need based in actual fact,
but only based in convenience
for those who merit such con
veniences. Those who spend
money at Stanford.
Why extend Lomita Court to
Campus Drive? To provide bet
ter and easier access to the
center of campus by car. Why
provide such access? To facili
tate the outside community to
come onto campus, since
those who live here would not
drive.
Are there any other reasons?
Not really. By alleviating traffic
problems on Mayfield we
merely move them to the lake
area. Certainly not a good
reason — perhaps an excuse.
By building a better road we
draw cars onto campus, not
keep them out.
We also civilize one of the
last pastoral regions of the
main campus. In addition we
create good access to the lake,
bringing in outside visitors. It
becomes easier to drive among
the lake residences. The cam
pus design is simplified.
Are any of the ideas above
worthwhile? I think not. Stan
ford has the unique chance to
remain a natural, pastoral area.
There is sufficient space
around the center of campus to
route all automobile traffic
around the outside.
But instead, we build access
roads to the center so that vis

itors and employees will not
have to walk. The students can
walk, of course. Stanford is
supposed to be for the students
and teachers. That is the idea of
a university. If outsiders want
to visit, they can do so on our
terms.
As far as I am concerned,
Stanford has no reason to build
roads into campus, only to
eliminate them. In the next iO
years, automobiles will be out
dated. Why build for them to
day?
It is all a question of em
phasis. Who are we to design
the campus for? Not the stu
dents, it seems. They are not
even consulted on a realistic
level. The dean of student af
fairs claims to speak for us. The
vice-provost claims to repre
sent us; yet they advocate the
road extension and always
have.
I would not call that either
representation or regard for
the students. Or for the fa
culty. At least not those in the
Music. Dept. threatened
by ten thousand cars a day next
to their building. Certainly not
for nearby residents. Why
build the road?
Alternatives exist. If Stanford
is willing to accept its role as a
large township in the area, it
can complete Campus Drive
out to lunipero Serra, thereby
providing access to every part
of campus and also to through
traffic.
Can we really expect to re
main as a four-mile-long block
to east-west traffic? Certainly
not, unless we are willing to
sacrifice the livability of the

rest of campus and hold onto
our inner roads. That's not the
best solution, though.
The University is a beautiful
place, but not what it could be
because we tend to choose the
second-best .option to solve
our problems. Please don't
sacrifice another area of cam
pus simply because it is easier
or cheaper than the best solu
tion. For once, let's do it right.

Misleading figures
I'd like to clarify some mis
leading figures used in last
week's editor's note following
a letter on the Senior Pledge
Program.
It is true that private gifts to
Stanford this year are expected
to provide only 6.4 percent of
the income in the 1979-80
"operating budget." But the
operating budget only covers
part of the cost of education.
It constitutes only one-third
of the total annual University
expenditures. It includes all
the regular unrestricted in
come available to the Univer
sity, plus thosefunds which are
restricted to the core activities
of teaching and departmental
support.
But what of books for the lib
raries, support for Hopkins
Marine Station, or scholarship
aid? Gifts from corporations,
foundations and individuals,
which are restricted for a

specific use, are not included
in Stanford's operating
budget.
If one looks at the cost of
education — which includes
instruction, libraries, student
aid, student services, administ
ration and general expense,
and operations and mainte
nance — private support ac
counts for 33.1 percent of the
needed funds. This includes
gifts and non-governmental
grants, 15.6 percent, and in
come from prior gifts (endow
ment), 17.5 percent.
Stanford does heavily de
pend on private gifts. The sup
port of seniors and alumni is
greatly needed.

Boycott slighted
It is ironic that the same issue
of the Daily which carried a
editorial page critique of the
"cover-it-so-we-don't-catch-it-la
rather than "this-is-important"
attitude at the Daily should
prove the criticism so true, so
rapidly on the features page of
the same issue.
Because we believe that the
issue of farmworker support is
important enough to merit
serious treatment, we are re
sponding to the story on the
"lack of boycott pressures" at
Stanford which appeared
{Daily, May 21).
If the reporter had taken the
time, as I strongly suggested
when he contacted me, to
speak to members of the Un
ited Farm Workers' Support
Committee, he would have
found a strong core group of 30
students working hard to in
volve the Stanford community

in boycott efforts.
More importantly, he would
have seen the successes the
UFW Committee has had in
generating support.
Granted, Food Service calls
itself "neutral" on the issue,
but a great number of students
and faculty have responded to
the call to boycott iceberg let
tuce and Chiquita bananas.
If this isn't an age of student
involvement in critical social
and political issues, as the arti

tie implies, it's not for lack of
trying. Organizations like ours
certainly exist; to be labelled
"muted" and "dull roar" by in
adequately informed people is
one of the problems we fight
against. The shallow under
standing and research de
monstrated by the article is
what we're out to correct.

sponding to the story on the
"lack of boycott pressures" at
Stanford which appeared
{Daily, May 21).
If the reporter had taken the
time, as I strongly suggested
when he contacted me, to
speak to members of the Un
ited Farm Workers' Support
Committee, he would have
found a strong core group of 30
students working hard to in
volve the Stanford community

in boycott efforts.
More importantly, he would
have seen the successes the
UFW Committee has had in
generating support.
Granted, Food Service calls
itself "neutral" on the issue,
but a great number of students
and faculty have responded to
the call to boycott iceberg let
tuce and Chiquita bananas.
If this isn't an age of student
involvement in critical social
and political issues, as the arti

tie implies, it's not for lack of
trying. Organizations like ours
certainly exist; to be labelled
"muted" and "dull roar" by in
adequately informed people is
one of the problems we fight
against. The shallow under
standing and research de
monstrated by the article is
what we're out to correct.

Halt Lomita!
This is a protest letter. It is a
letter to protest the process of
implementing the building of a
road extention at Stanford
University. A project which has
no need based in actual fact,
but only based in convenience
for those who merit such con
veniences. Those who spend
money at Stanford.
Why extend Lomita Court to
Campus Drive? To provide bet
ter and easier access to the
center of campus by car. Why
provide such access? To facili
tate the outside community to
come onto campus, since
those who live here would not
drive.
Are there any other reasons?
Not really. By alleviating traffic
problems on Mayfield we
merely move them to the lake
area. Certainly not a good
reason — perhaps an excuse.
By building a better road we
draw cars onto campus, not
keep them out.
We also civilize one of the
last pastoral regions of the
main campus. In addition we
create good access to the lake,
bringing in outside visitors. It
becomes easier to drive among
the lake residences. The cam
pus design is simplified.
Are any of the ideas above
worthwhile? I think not. Stan
ford has the unique chance to
remain a natural, pastoral area.
There is sufficient space
around the center of campus to
route all automobile traffic
around the outside.
But instead, we build access
roads to the center so that vis

itors and employees will not
have to walk. The students can
walk, of course. Stanford is
supposed to be for the students
and teachers. That is the idea of
a university. If outsiders want
to visit, they can do so on our
terms.
As far as I am concerned,
Stanford has no reason to build
roads into campus, only to
eliminate them. In the next iO
years, automobiles will be out
dated. Why build for them to
day?
It is all a question of em
phasis. Who are we to design
the campus for? Not the stu
dents, it seems. They are not
even consulted on a realistic
level. The dean of student af
fairs claims to speak for us. The
vice-provost claims to repre
sent us; yet they advocate the
road extension and always
have.
I would not call that either
representation or regard for
the students. Or for the fa
culty. At least not those in the
Music. Dept. threatened
by ten thousand cars a day next
to their building. Certainly not
for nearby residents. Why
build the road?
Alternatives exist. If Stanford
is willing to accept its role as a
large township in the area, it
can complete Campus Drive
out to lunipero Serra, thereby
providing access to every part
of campus and also to through
traffic.
Can we really expect to re
main as a four-mile-long block
to east-west traffic? Certainly
not, unless we are willing to
sacrifice the livability of the

rest of campus and hold onto
our inner roads. That's not the
best solution, though.
The University is a beautiful
place, but not what it could be
because we tend to choose the
second-best .option to solve
our problems. Please don't
sacrifice another area of cam
pus simply because it is easier
or cheaper than the best solu
tion. For once, let's do it right.

Misleading figures
I'd like to clarify some mis
leading figures used in last
week's editor's note following
a letter on the Senior Pledge
Program.
It is true that private gifts to
Stanford this year are expected
to provide only 6.4 percent of
the income in the 1979-80
"operating budget." But the
operating budget only covers
part of the cost of education.
It constitutes only one-third
of the total annual University
expenditures. It includes all
the regular unrestricted in
come available to the Univer
sity, plus thosefunds which are
restricted to the core activities
of teaching and departmental
support.
But what of books for the lib
raries, support for Hopkins
Marine Station, or scholarship
aid? Gifts from corporations,
foundations and individuals,
which are restricted for a

specific use, are not included
in Stanford's operating
budget.
If one looks at the cost of
education — which includes
instruction, libraries, student
aid, student services, administ
ration and general expense,
and operations and mainte
nance — private support ac
counts for 33.1 percent of the
needed funds. This includes
gifts and non-governmental
grants, 15.6 percent, and in
come from prior gifts (endow
ment), 17.5 percent.
Stanford does heavily de
pend on private gifts. The sup
port of seniors and alumni is
greatly needed.
