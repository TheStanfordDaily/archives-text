# Neonatal nursery helps premies
## 
### Brian Sprague 
One out of every 10 pre
gnancies in the United States
results in premature delivery.
Ten to 12 years ago, doctors
had such little information on
these infants that obstetricians
were forced to place the
children in premature nurse
ries where they could do little
more than watch them. Fifty
percent of these infants died.
Now complex and
technologically advanced
neonatal nurseries are spring
ing up all over the country.
One of the oldest and most
celebrated is the unit at the
Medical Center which boasts
survival rates of 90 percent.
Cecele Quaintance, the nur
sery's clinical nursing coor
dinator, said that one half of
the infants who occupy the 30
incubated beds of the neonatal
nursery are born in the Med
Center. The rest are trans
ported from hospitals as far
away as Bakersfield.
As the technological ad
vances increase, so do the
monetary requirements
needed to support them. It is
not impossible to accumulate a
$50,000 bill, said Quaintance.
The average cost runs $1000 a
day for such specialized care,
with an average stay running
approximately three to four
weeks.
Unlike other centers where a
set fee is established, the nur
sery has instituted a declining
fee system. As the infant re

quires decreasing amounts of
care, the costs decline accord
ingly.
Due to basic socio-economic
realities, the majority of the
premature babies are from
lower income families who live
in large cities, said Quain
tance, thereby creating serious
financial hardships on parents.
However, several organiza
tions such as Crippled Chil
dren's Services generously aid
these families. The National In
stitutes of Health is presently
paying fully for four of the
beds, she added.
Although costs are no
child has ever been turned
away by the nursery due to lack
of funding. "We worry about
the child first," said Quain
tance.
The 75 to 80 staff personnel
working at the nursery have
performed such incredible
tasks as saving a 15-pound,
24-week-old "immature or
ganism," said Quaintance. The
infants are labeled "immature
organisms" because they are
not fully developed, and often
incur problems breathing, di
gesting and retaining body
heat.
The latter problem, common
in premature infants, is solved
by placing them in plastic in
cubators at an average temper
ature of 33 degrees Celsius
(91.4 degrees Fahrenheit). Se
vere cases, however, have re
quired the temperature to in
crease to 38 to 40 degrees Cel
sius, said Quaintance.
She added that the nursery
has accomplished open heart
surgery and other similar deli
cate operations upon these
"immature organisms."
Several of the infants lie on
oscillating waterbeds which
were installed about four years
ago as part of a study to cure
apnea, the partial suspension

of breathing in the infants. Pre
sently they are mainly used to
increase the comfort of the in
fant, which may aid in their re
covery, said Quaintance.
Of course, the best solution
is to reduce the number of
premature deliveries, but as of
yet, the mysteries of what starts
labor evades medical know
ledge. The most common
method used to postpone
laborwas to administer alcohol
intravenously into the
mother's system to inebriate her
and thereby relax her contract
ing uterine muscles. Ter

butaline has replaced the al
cohol, alleviating the uncom
fortable side effects of being
intoxicated for a prolonged
period of time, Quaintance
said.
Contrary to previous prac
tice, parents are encouraged to
enter the nursery to view and
hold their children. Given
reasonable precautions, pa
rents are allowed to stroke,
hold and feed their child while
in the nursery. Quaintance
added that there is no limit to
how long they may visit.
