# Western Culture pilot course finds approval
## 
### Kathy Bowman 
If faculty enthusiasm and
student response are an indica
tion of success, the new West
ern Culture pilot course has
had an impressive first year.
The course has been "more
successful than we ever
thought it could be," said
Lewis Spitz, history professor
and a member of the Faculty

News Analysis

Senate task force for the West
ern Culture requirement. He
said overall student evalua
tions have been in the "excel
lent" range for every aspect of
this experimental freshman
course which deals with the
"history of society and ideas."
The pilot is the result of sev
eral years of Faculty Senate dis
cussion over the reinstatement
of a Western Culture require
ment. A mandatory Western
Civilization course was aban
doned eight years ago after
being part of the University

curriculum for several de
cades.
Spitz noted that this dis
mantling of requirements was
a common occurrence in uni
versities in the early 19705.
Only the University of
Chicago, Columbia University
and St. John's in Annapolis,
Md. kept the civilization and
culture requirements.
Capitulating
"Stanford unfortunately
capitulated," Spitz said.
Chairman of the pilot program,
Philosophy Prof. John Perry
said that although require
ments "do the students a big
favor by insuring excellent
courses," he would have sup
ported dropping the require
ments in the early '70 s because
of the freedom and flexibility
of an elective curriculum.
But almost immediately, the
need for a "cultural know
how" was felt, Spitz said. One
year after the drop, Halsey
Royden, then Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, ex

pressed his support for a re
establishment of such a
course, and several commit
tees have since worked toward
this goal.
Perry said that Stanford is
one of the first universities to
complete a thorough review of
its requirements. "My impres
sion is that we are way ahead of
other universities in our re
commitment to undergraduate
education," he said.
In 1976, after meeting for
more than two years, the
Committee on Reform and Re
newal recommended to set up
a pilot program whose criteria
would be set by the Faculty Se
nate. A requirement could not
yet be imposed, members of
the committee felt, because
good courses were not yet de
veloped.
The recommendation stated
that classes should include no
more than 20 students, should
be taught by instructors with
Ph.D. degrees or similar
backgrounds and should in

volve more than one discip
line.
One of seven
And so, Western Culture 1,2
and 3 were set up last year with
these guidelines in mind. It is
just one of seven tracks in the
University which will eventu
ally fill the Western Culture re
quirement should the requir
ment be adopted. The
Humanities 61 series, the
Modern Europe series and
Structured Liberal Education
will all be modified to fit the
track guidelines, Spitz said.
In addition, three new tracks
are being developed, includ
ing Western Culture: A
Thematic Approach, taught
through comparative litera
ture; Ideas in Western Culture,
taught jointly through the de
partments of philosophy and
religious studies and Technol
ogy and Western Culture,
taught through the Values,
Technology and Society prog
ram.
Each track will be designed

especially for the first-year stu
dent, although it may later ac
commodate the many up
perclassmen who have already
asked to take the course, Spitz
said.
On May 11, the task force
held a workshop to decide on a
common syllabus. Contrary to
what some skeptics had be
lieved, the department rep
resentatives agreed on impor
tant works which should be in
cluded. The "A-list" includes
books the group considers to
be indispensable, such as
Plato's Republic, selections
from the Bible, Dante's In
ferno, More's Utopia and
Marx's Communist Manifesto.
Other "great works and
smashing authors" include
books by Augustine,
Machiavelli, Galileo, Luther,
Voltaire and Freud, which will
also be mandatory readings,
Spitz said.
Fills gap
Some students who took the
Western Culture pilot course

this year agreed that the prog
ram fills a gap.
"I applied for the course be
cause in high school I didn't
have such an extensive prog
ram and I felt that reading
these books is an important
part of an education," said stu
dent Judy Deutsch.
She and another freshman
agreed that the course was the
best they took this year.
Students cited the exposure
to outstanding professors from
many departments and the
small group discussions as
some of the biggest advantages
of the course. Professors are
responsive to student feed
back and "there are always
teachers available to help
us,"one student said.
There were also some com
plaints with this first-year prog
ram. The volume of reading
material was difficult at times
and the overview nature of the
course means "spending only
a little time on each work, with
limited discussion, which is
frustrating," said student
Wendy Hebborn.
Spitz agreed that in this limit
ing context, some works are
"impenetrable for freshmen."
"For example, we unloaded
Adam Smith's entire Wealth of

Nations for one week," he
said.
But should the course be
made a requirement?
"The student initiative is a
valuable thing," Hebborn said.
"It insures that all people are
really interested."
But Perry said that students
will probably take a course like
the Western Culture require
ment sometime during their
first two years anyway.
"They may not want another
requirement, but we are offer
ing courses which will make it
worth their while," he said.
Like the other University re
quirements, it is hoped that the
Western Culture one will pro
duce a more well-rounded
student. A recent criticism by
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebsch, stated that the prog
ram was designed like an "all
purpose multi-wrench that is
not much good for anything,
but a little bit good for every
thing."
Perry's only reply: "My ad
justable wrench is the most
useful tool I own."
The Western Culture course
has one more year as a pilot
program. In 1980 the Faculty
Senate will vote whether
to make it a requirement.

There were also some com

But should the course be
made a requirement?
"The student initiative is a
valuable thing," Hebborn said.
"It insures that all people are
really interested."
But Perry said that students
will probably take a course like
the Western Culture require
ment sometime during their
first two years anyway.
"They may not want another
requirement, but we are offer
ing courses which will make it
worth their while," he said.
Like the other University re
quirements, it is hoped that the
Western Culture one will pro
duce a more well-rounded
student. A recent criticism by
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebsch, stated that the prog

The Western Culture course
has one more year as a pilot
program. In 1980 the Faculty
Senate will vote whether
to make it a requirement.
If faculty enthusiasm and
student response are an indica
tion of success, the new West
ern Culture pilot course has
had an impressive first year.
The course has been "more
successful than we ever
thought it could be," said
Lewis Spitz, history professor
and a member of the Faculty

News Analysis

Senate task force for the West
ern Culture requirement. He
said overall student evalua
tions have been in the "excel
lent" range for every aspect of
this experimental freshman
course which deals with the
"history of society and ideas."
The pilot is the result of sev
eral years of Faculty Senate dis
cussion over the reinstatement
of a Western Culture require
ment. A mandatory Western
Civilization course was aban
doned eight years ago after
being part of the University

curriculum for several de
cades.
Spitz noted that this dis
mantling of requirements was
a common occurrence in uni
versities in the early 19705.
Only the University of
Chicago, Columbia University
and St. John's in Annapolis,
Md. kept the civilization and
culture requirements.
Capitulating
"Stanford unfortunately
capitulated," Spitz said.
Chairman of the pilot program,
Philosophy Prof. John Perry
said that although require
ments "do the students a big
favor by insuring excellent
courses," he would have sup
ported dropping the require
ments in the early '70 s because
of the freedom and flexibility
of an elective curriculum.
But almost immediately, the
need for a "cultural know
how" was felt, Spitz said. One
year after the drop, Halsey
Royden, then Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, ex

pressed his support for a re
establishment of such a
course, and several commit
tees have since worked toward
this goal.
Perry said that Stanford is
one of the first universities to
complete a thorough review of
its requirements. "My impres
sion is that we are way ahead of
other universities in our re
commitment to undergraduate
education," he said.
In 1976, after meeting for
more than two years, the
Committee on Reform and Re
newal recommended to set up
a pilot program whose criteria
would be set by the Faculty Se
nate. A requirement could not
yet be imposed, members of
the committee felt, because
good courses were not yet de
veloped.
The recommendation stated
that classes should include no
more than 20 students, should
be taught by instructors with
Ph.D. degrees or similar
backgrounds and should in

volve more than one discip
line.
One of seven
And so, Western Culture 1,2
and 3 were set up last year with
these guidelines in mind. It is
just one of seven tracks in the
University which will eventu
ally fill the Western Culture re
quirement should the requir
ment be adopted. The
Humanities 61 series, the
Modern Europe series and
Structured Liberal Education
will all be modified to fit the
track guidelines, Spitz said.
In addition, three new tracks
are being developed, includ
ing Western Culture: A
Thematic Approach, taught
through comparative litera
ture; Ideas in Western Culture,
taught jointly through the de
partments of philosophy and
religious studies and Technol
ogy and Western Culture,
taught through the Values,
Technology and Society prog
ram.
Each track will be designed

especially for the first-year stu
dent, although it may later ac
commodate the many up
perclassmen who have already
asked to take the course, Spitz
said.
On May 11, the task force
held a workshop to decide on a
common syllabus. Contrary to
what some skeptics had be
lieved, the department rep
resentatives agreed on impor
tant works which should be in
cluded. The "A-list" includes
books the group considers to
be indispensable, such as
Plato's Republic, selections
from the Bible, Dante's In
ferno, More's Utopia and
Marx's Communist Manifesto.
Other "great works and
smashing authors" include
books by Augustine,
Machiavelli, Galileo, Luther,
Voltaire and Freud, which will
also be mandatory readings,
Spitz said.

Western Culture pilot course
