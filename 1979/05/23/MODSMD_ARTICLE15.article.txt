## USE and University must communicate 
### 
Currently there is little
communication between the
academic community (stu
dents, professors and others)
and United Stanford
Employees (USE). This sad situ
ation is highly unreflective of
the University's stated goals.
The "Stanford Community"
is too much of a myth and is not
always encouraged or ac
tualized by either the "com
munity" at large or the powers
that be. I believe this abyss
should be bridged and I have
some ideas about howand why
this communication should be
realized between USE and at
least the academic sector of the
"community".
Stanford suffers from
incoherency of policy and
plan, diversity of direction, de
centralization and incomplete
inter-communication.
The University "suffers" be
cause of problems of com
munication by USE and af
filiated labor councils to a cen
tralized source on personnel
problems. These problems ad
versely affect both you and us.
A similar communication prob
lem and negative result exists
between USE and the academic
community.
The University structure and
behavior predicates a support
service—an outer ring—of
labor, structural maintenance,
research assistance and vari
ous other services. Some 1300
of these workers belong to the
USE bargaining unit, i.e. they
are union members. Comput
ers are kept cool and rooms

warm by USE maintenance.
Laboratory manipulations,
groundskeeping and material
delivery are done by USE
workers. Your comfort and
academic activities are sup
ported by USE members.
Somewhere in your experi
ence here you receive either
good or bad results from this
relationship. On top of that,
you are probably not aware of
our role. We are probably
equally and similarly ignorant.
This is regrettable because we
do not want to work for money
alone. We work for job satis
faction and that means a lot to
us.
Every worker either has or
learns to have a degree of love
for his or her work. This love of
work revolves around several
core relationshipsrthe worker
and his service recipient (you),
the worker and his fellow
workers, the worker and the
community, theworkerand his
skill or trade, the worker and
his supervisor.
When one or more of these
relationships go bad, the other
relationships tend to suffer
too. And the academic com
munity suffersa loss in the rela
tionship with its necessary
support service. It is for this
reason that we must attempt to
build bridges.
We will feel better with bet
ter communication and so will
you. We would rather work
happily than always be struggl
ing against barriers. We want
to feel like we are a more rec
ognized and integral part of the

community so that we can live
more happily.
I have two ideas to help ac
complish this: First, I propose
that The Stanford Daily reserve
column space in their paperfor
comments from USE members.
In this way we can inform you
of ourgoals and activities. With
this open reservation in the
paper we will not have to con
cern ourselves with presenting
articles to the Daily for consid
eration and the Daily will not
have to concern itself with
editorial policy regarding our
submissions. Rather, we ourse
lves will be responsible for
whatever is published in the
reserved column. This column
will further contain responses
from the academic community
to our articles.
Second, I propose that stu
dents and professors form a
joint committee with USE for
the purpose of solving prob
lems in the relationships
therein. I request that the Stan
ford Personnel Dept. sponsor
this project by allowing elected
workers to have paid time off
forthis committee work.
Presently all communication
goes through service managers
and is inadequate and is unfor
tunately interfered with as far
as our better purposes and bet
ter intentions. I respectfully
suggest that you probably have
no idea of how bad our rela
tionship is, or I should say,
how good it could be.
I have attempted to present
this case as rationally and intel

lectually as possible, and I have
deliberately omitted substance
or example and concentrated
on procedure or theoretical
means of communication. I
expect that, once opened, our
lines of communication will get
into substance. They are too
numerous to get into in this let
ter and therefore I am leaning
on you to believe me and the
importance of this matter.

(Editor's note: The Daily re
serves regular column space
only for its columnists. All
members of the community,
however, are encouraged to
apply as columnists for the
summer volume, beginning
June 25. Sample columns are
due June 16.)
