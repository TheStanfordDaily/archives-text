## Israel too sheltered from criticism 
### 
I am pleased to see the Daily
become a forum for discussion
of the Middle East crisis, con
sidering the limited opportun
ity that students have to learn
anything about that region at
the University. To clarify my
own position and extend the
discussion I offer this rebuttal
to Jon Reider's criticisms
(Daily, May 7) of my recent arti
cle (Daily, May 1).
Reider did not challenge my
arguments criticizing Israel,
but instead condemned me for
omitting the oppressive treat
ment of Jewish communities in
Arab states. I resent his pre
sumption that criticism of Is
rael implies blanket approval
of the Arabs. While many Arab
countries must improve their
record on the treatment of
their Jewish nationals, it is ir
relevant to the discussion. No
amount of oppression of Jews
elsewhere justifies oppression
by Jews of Palestinians in Israel
and the occupied territories.
Reider also condemned my
omission of Palestinian ter
rorism declaring that "it does
not contribute to scholarly dis
course to passionately attack
one's enemy at the expense of
honest acknowledgement of
the crimes of one's own side."
He must have totally misread
my article. My "own side" is
not the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) or even the
Palestinians. My "side" is
human rights. And I condemn
those Palestinian actions which
violate Israeli human rights,
just as I condemn those Israeli
actions which deny Palestinian
human rights.
Why, then, do I concentrate
my criticism on Israel, one may
ask. First of all, Israel, unlikeits
Arab adversaries, is lauded in
America as a showplace of
democracy. If it wishes to be
praised, pampered and sup
ported for its virtues then it

must live up to its reputation.
Second, the Israeli "democ
racy" systematizes and in
stitutionalizes its violation of
Palestinian human and civil
rights by its laws, regulations
and policies. And I challenge
any Daily reader to prove that
such respected sources as Am
nesty International, the Inter
national Red Cross, the Lon
don Times and the Israeli
League for Human and Civil
Rights are wrong in condemn
ing such Israeli violations.
Third, Israel has been shel
tered too long from open criti
cism. The designation of Israel
as a "Jewish state" has wrongly
implied that criticism of Israel
is an admission of anti-
Semitism.
Fourth, while I can verbally
condemn the wrongs of the
PLO and the Arab states, I do
not share any responsibility for
their actions. I am not paying
for the weapons that kill inno
cent Israelis but, through my
taxes, I am paying for Israeli
weapons that kill innocent
Palestinians and other Arabs.
In 1977 Dr. Edmund
Hanauer, a Jewish-American
political scientist, wrote "The
U.S. gives Israelis, one
thousandth of the world's
population, two-thirds of our
entire foreign aid—aid which
enables Israel to occupy, ap
propriate and gradually annex
Arab lands."
In October 1978, Richard Ro
vere in The New Yorker noted
that "The American subsidy to
Israel comes to about $500 per
year for every man, woman and
child tn the country—more
than the per capita income in
much of the world." His statis
tics are actually very conserva
tive.
Finally, Reider objects to my
comparison of Israel with its
ally South Africa. I did not men
tion South Africa to condemn

Israel of guilt by association as
he implies. I mentioned South
Africa first because Israel is
guilty of the same in
stitutionalized discriminatory
policies, and secondly because
we, through our support of Is
rael, are allowing our tax
money to be tunneled to South
Africa thus, in essence, sup
porting the discriminatory
policies of both countries.
Reider insinuates that as a
Middle East specialist and an
instructor here, I should be
less biased. I feel that a scholar,

including myself and my stu
dents, has an obligation to
study all sides of an issue and
to take a stand based on that
study. My bias is for human
rights and truth.
I would also like to draw to
the reader's attention a coming
event here. Tomorrow night a
panel of two Arabs (a Palesti
nian and a Lebanese) and two
Israelis will discuss "Peace in
the Middle East."
