## Lise Giraud Abandon Franklin case 
### 
(Second of two parts.)
The legal battle of the American Civil Liberties
Union versus the Board of Trustees, President
Richard Lyman and the Advisory Board has been
making its snail-like way through the courts
since 1972. The ACLU is acting on behalf of
Bruce Franklin, tenured associate professor of
English fired by Stanford for political speeches
considered by the ACLU as "plainly protected
under the First Amendment."
The attorney for the ACLU is a woman. In the
courtroom, in a symbolic display of the distribu
tion of power, she regularly faces six men, the
University's lawyers hired for the case. The law
firm representing Lyman and the trustees is
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen. Law part
ner Doyle is a Stanford trustee. So is law partner
Brown.
Conceivably they are serving free of charge in
their own case. If, however, they are paid—and
they owe the University community an explana
tion of their role—there could be some curious
questions raised. Are the defendants paying
themselves as attorneys out of the University's
funds in their charge as trustees?
A conflict of interest can be a happy conflu
ence of interests—such as using funds in one's
trust to keep one's enemy at bay and yet not
having to watch the money go down the drain
since it will find its way into one's pocket.
The bonanza is no small one. An educated
guess has it that the case has so far cost the
University around $250,000. The ACLU has no
intention of dropping it. Historically, they say,
they have always liked cases like this.
Before they are through, the University will
have to shell out a fortune. With faculty salaries
on the wane, student tuition on the rise, and the
administration fighting to deny the University's
workers pay raises that limp way behind even
the cost of living, one wonders whether the
allocation of such a chunk of money to maintain
the University's inelegant position on the
Franklin case is justified.
The Advisory Board, in its concurrence with
Lyman's dismissal of Franklin, stated that
Franklin's "pattern of conduct directly involves
attacks upon the values of the University as now
constituted and also includes violent acts
against the members of the University commun
ity."
Franklin never once committed a violent act

against any member of the University commun
ity. But it is interesting to see how the University
handled those that did.
In October 1975, Karl Pribram, professor of
psychiatry, struck his secretary, Barbara Honeg
ger, inafitofanger, bruising herfaceand break
ing her glasses. Only at the victim's urgings did
the University take any action against Pribram at
all. It fined him 6.5 percent of his substantial
salary for one year and put him on 24 months'
probation
Ironically, when the distraught woman called
the chairman of the department the night of the
attack, he told her "to seek psychiatric help" for
her disturbance over the incident. That chair-

man, David Hamburg, was one of the hanging
judges on the Advisory Board that recom
mended firing Franklin. He must not have prof
fered similar professional counsel to Lyman and
the Board.
Early this year Associate Anatomy Prof.
Donald Stilwell struck two students. The Uni
versity reduced his salary by $2 000 for one year
and warned hi m that another such act could lead
to his dismissal.
Clearly there is a formidable contrast between
the University reaction to genuine attacks of
violence upon students or female employees
and to "attacks upon the values of the University
as now constituted"—or rather, one might say,
to the values and interests of its trustees and
administration.
It would seem fruitful to have some discus
sion within the University community on the
wisdom and honor of pursuing further what
must be one of the shabbier enterprises in the
University's history. There is no way the Univer
sity can emerge a winner from this case.
It has been tinged with enough injustice,
hypocrisy, vengefulness and waste to leave an
indelible stain. The best thing the University
could do would be to cut its losses, both moral
and financial.
