## Swap of Soviet dissidents abortive 
### 
The unprecedented swap of
the five Soviet dissidents for
the two Soviet spies once again
focused the world's attention
on the human rights issue.
Whereas the 1960s are com
monly associated with the
anti-war and civil rights move
ment in the United States, the
1970s have been dominated in
creasingly by the struggle for
human rights in the Soviet Un
ion.
Inaugurated by the 1970

Nobel prize awarded to Ale
xander Solzhenitsyn for telling
the truth about communism,
the dissident 1970s have super
seded the troublesome 19605.
Epitomizing the above was
the award of the 1975 Nobel
Peace Prize to Andrei
Sakharov, a "father" of the
Soviet hydrogen bomb and
human rights leader. At long
last, the struggle for human
rights in the U.S.S.R. received
international recognition. This
happened in spite of the "left
liberal faddishness" of the
West which author Sakharov
decried for blaming all the evils
of mankind on capitalism.
"We need reform, not re
volution," declared Sakharov
in his Nobel lecture, as if echo
ing Martin Luther King. Refer
ring to the lack of human rights
in the Soviet Union, Sakharov
said that "international trust,
mutual understanding, disar
mament and international sec
urity are inconceivable without
an open society with freedom
of information, freedom of
conscience, the right to pub
lish, and the right to travel and
choose the country in which

one wishes to live."
A year later President Jimmy
Carter sent Sakharov a letter
assuring him that "human
rights is a central concern of
my administration." It finally
dawned upon our leaders that
the only firm guarantee for de
tente between nations is the
establishment of a domestic
detente between the Soviet
government and human rights
advocates.
Whilel am very happyforthe
five dissidents being freed, the
swap diminishes chances for a
domestic detente in the Soviet
Union. I fear that the Soviets
simply fed the swap to the U.S.
State Department and the
White House in order to sell
the American public on SALT
and the scrapping of the
Jackson-Vanik amendment
denying the Soviets most
favored-nation status in trade.
If we swallow the bait, we
would implement the Lenin
formula, "a step forward, two
backwards," for both human
rights in the Soviet Union and
U.S. national security. Still at
the mercy of the Kremlin are
Igor Ogurtsov, Vladimir
Osipov (a Moscow University

classmate of mine, now serving
his second seven-year term),
Yuri Orlov, Anatoly
Shcharansky and hundreds of
others with whom the Soviet
government refuses to co
exist.
The swap is not a quid pro
quo and as such may set a
dangerous precedent for fu
ture exchanges. Unable to find
in this country anyone dep
rived of human rights, the
Soviets did what they are best
at: caring for their spies. To
offset their embarrassment,
they hurried to award the Lenin
Peace Prize to the American
Communist Angela Davis.
I find this Soviet move so
suggestive that I cannot im
agine how Carter could now
fail to propose to Brezhnev, at
their forthcoming summit, to
exchange the above prisoners
for our home-grown malcon
tents: Angela Davis, Jane
Fonda, Bella Abzug, and, for
good measure, Daniel
Ellsberg.

domestic detente in the Soviet
Union. I fear that the Soviets
simply fed the swap to the U.S.
State Department and the
White House in order to sell
the American public on SALT
and the scrapping of the
Jackson-Vanik amendment
denying the Soviets most
favored-nation status in trade.
If we swallow the bait, we
would implement the Lenin
formula, "a step forward, two
backwards," for both human
rights in the Soviet Union and
U.S. national security. Still at
the mercy of the Kremlin are
Igor Ogurtsov, Vladimir
Osipov (a Moscow University

classmate of mine, now serving
his second seven-year term),
Yuri Orlov, Anatoly
Shcharansky and hundreds of
others with whom the Soviet
government refuses to co
exist.
The swap is not a quid pro
quo and as such may set a
dangerous precedent for fu
ture exchanges. Unable to find
in this country anyone dep
rived of human rights, the
Soviets did what they are best
at: caring for their spies. To
offset their embarrassment,
they hurried to award the Lenin
Peace Prize to the American
Communist Angela Davis.
I find this Soviet move so
suggestive that I cannot im
agine how Carter could now
fail to propose to Brezhnev, at
their forthcoming summit, to
exchange the above prisoners
for our home-grown malcon
tents: Angela Davis, Jane
Fonda, Bella Abzug, and, for
good measure, Daniel
Ellsberg.
