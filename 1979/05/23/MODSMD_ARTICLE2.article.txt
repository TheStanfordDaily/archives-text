# Protesters react to regents' delay of Livermore, Los Alamos lab vote
## 
### Dean Eyre 
A group of more than 300 per
sons, including about a dozen
members of the Stanford com
munity, went to the UC Regents
meeting last Friday to protest con
tinued weapons research at Lawr
ence Livermore and Los Alamos,
N.M. labs.
The nuclear weapons issue was
tabled until July, although the re
gents voted to ask General Motors
to stop doing business with either

the police or military forces of
South Africa.
The delay was received with lit
tle reaction, primarily because
many in the gathering were not
expecting an immediate answer.
"I unn t think anybody was too
su*prised," commented Lisa
Caianzerite. "Some people were
Saying they're (the regents) doing
it on purpos? because students
won't be here anymore (in the
summer). Not everybody went

there expecting that they would
do it (vote for converting or disas
sociating with the labs.)
"The crowd reaction was pretty
much 'we'll be here when you
meet next time,"' Catanzerite ad
ded.
The nonviolent protest at 55
Laguna Street in the city actually
began at noon last Thursday, al
though most of the protesters ar
rived Friday morning for the full
board meeting. The action was

planned by the UC Nuclear
Weapons Labs Conversion Pro
ject (UCNWLCP), organizer of the
May 5 rally at the Livermore facil
ity.
"They (the project's coor
dinators) made periodic an
nouncements about what the re
gents were doing," said Laura
Kay. "When they said they (the
regents) were putting it off to the
end of the meeting a couple of
people booed but I didn't find
anything suprising about their
putting it off."
Gov. Jerry Brown proposed that
the university end its as
sociation with the Los
Alamos lab while making efforts
to convert Livermore to peaceful
purposes. This motion is a com
promise of the UCNWLCP aim for
converting both labs to non
warfare research.
"I think it was a good first step,"
Kay stated. "I think if you attempt
to shut them down at the same
time you'll be laughed at."
"If he (Brown) does have his eye
on the presidency, I can't imagine
a president going for closing
down a weapons lab and getting
rid of our 'national defense.' So if
he's thinking in terms of 'national
defense' now, it's probably impor
tant. I don't know much about
lerrv Brown, but he never puts his
foot down one way or the other,"
she said.
Brown did not directly address
the overflow crowd, but his prop
osal was announced.
