# Letters to the editor
## Ravings inane 
### 
In regard to Susan War
nock's recent pieces on frater
nities (Daily, April 27) and on
econ majors (Daily, May 21) I
have a simple question: Why?
Why must the innocent read
ers of the Daily be subjected to
such sub-par babble?
Is the staff in such desperate
need of material that even the
inane ravings of some mis
guided girl are printed? My
point is not that Warnock's ar
ticles are without value. They
have their place tucked away
inside a locked diary.
One must stretch one's im
agination, however, to con
ceive of good reason for their
appearance in the Daily. In all
likelihood there is no ill intent
behind what she says. On the
contrary, as she admitted in
her rebuttal to the article on
frats, her points are to be taken
with a grain of salt. Neverthe
less, I maintain that there is no
place for this type of material in
the editorial pages of the Daily.
In her most recent effort,
"The Woes of Econ," Warnock
goes on and on piecing to
gether seemingly unrelated
statements concerning her ex
periences as an Econ major.
Amusing as this may seem to

her, the reader finishes the let
ter wondering just what she
was trying to say. Clearly she
has nothing of any real value to
contribute.
The Daily has a responsibility
to the University community to
print columns and letters that
are, if not informative, at least
interesting. It is my hope that
any forthcoming articles from
Warnock will be so
scrutinized.
