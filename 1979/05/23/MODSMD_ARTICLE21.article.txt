# Sinners repent
## 
### 
After reading Manfred
Bahmann's column (Daily, May
22), as well as Bo Reahard's
column (Daily, May 15) about
homosexuality from a Christ
ian perspective, let me present
what I hope will be a truly
Christian comment.
First, I agree with Bahmann
that homosexuality is not the
only sin. I disagree with him,
however, in assuming that this
is what Reahard wrote.
I did not read anything in
Reahard's column that con
doned "heartlessness,
ruthlessness, insolence
and disobedience to parents."
What I did read in Reahard's

column was his concern forthe
fact that those who claim to be
gay do not attempt to change.
By continuing to commit
homosexual acts without ad
mitting that it is a sin, gays deny
that the Bible is true and by
doing so, they commit blas
phemy, the one unforgivable
sin.
This fact also applies to
people who commit other sins
continually, without attempt
ing to change.
I do not feel that I am con
demning these people. I have
nothing to gain by doing so.
On the contrary, I feel that I am
pleading with them to change,
so that Cod does not condemn
them.
I do not feel that homosexual
acts will condemn a Christian
to hell, but I do feel that saying
that these acts are not sins will
condemn a person to hell.
I also pray that there will be
no more "Cay Awareness
Weeks." Along with this
however, I pray that all
people who commit sin, in
cluding myself, will repent and
pray for the strength to over
come sin in the future.
