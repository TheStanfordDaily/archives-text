# China slows freer speech
## 
### Ken Kurosu 
Free expression and criti
cism of the government,
openly solicited by the
Chinese government just last
fall, appear to be facing new
limitations from the Beijing
(Peking) regime.
The newest wave in Chinese
domestic policy was signaled
by the April 20 edition of Beij
ing Review which stated that in
the recent liberalization, "un
healthy things, though few and
isolated, have also emerged."
Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping
(Teng Hsiao-p'ing) moved last
year to relax the constraints on
personal expression and dis
sent as part of the nation's
overall drive toward moderni
zation.
Deng probably believed that

The crackdown on liberalization coin
cides with a general reassessment of Chi
na's modernization goals.

a nation cowed into silence by
the repression of the im
mediate post-Mao era was un
likely to respond creatively and
effectively to the challenges of
the Four Modernizations. By
fostering a spirit of individual
freedom and constructive
criticism, he hoped to re
vitalize the nation.
Surprising candor
Chinese found themselves
free to make contact with
foreigners, and even to dabble
in Western hairstyles and fash
ions. Chinese willingness to
talk and candor surprised
foreign correspondents. A
grain keeper from a commune
near Shanghai confided to
Newsweek reporters, "Before
we were miserable. We didn't
have enough to eat, and we
wore homemade clothes."
The Chinese press extolled
the value of democracy,
people's rights and criticism of
the government. "If the people
could not air their views on
state affairs and cannot
criticize party and government
functionaries including lead
ers," a Feb. 20 People's Daily
editorial stated, "would not all
this talk about socialist democ
racy be so much empty talk?"
Not surprisingly, many
youths and workers seized the
opportunity to air their frustra
tions and criticisms stemming
from the Cultural Revolution
and the "Gang of Four" period.

Beijing (Peking) residents
organized processions and
meetings calling for democ
racy, while wall posters de
manded human rights. Criti
cism extended to the basic
tenets of Maoist socialism, the
foundation of Chinese politics
and society.
Too much dissent
This cry of dissent apparently
exceeded limits acceptable to
the government. Following a
speech to party leaders by
Deng in late March, restric
tions were gradually reim
posed. Articles in the People's
Daily and the Worker's Daily
began attacking the content of
many wall posters as
"bourgeois" and "not of the
proletariat." Plainclothesmen
now police "democracy wall"

and arrest authors of posters
denouncing government rep
ression. On March 29 a Beijing
municipal revolutionary com
mittee served public notice
that people must strive tor
"socialist democracy" rather
than "bourgeois democracy."
The crackdown on liberaliza
tion coincides with a general
reassessment of China's mod
ernization goals. As govern
ment officials moved to slow
the pace of industrialization,
lapanese businesses specu
lated that earlier contracts
might be canceled. While no
contracts have been canceled
yet, Western businesses such
as Intercontinental Hotels
Corp. appear unsure of the
status of agreements made
with the Chinese last year.
Nevertheless, in both the
economic and political
spheres, China is farfromalter
ing its basic goals. The Four
Modernizations still rank as the
prime objectives of Deng's re
gime, and the role for foreign
concerns has not been refuted.
Trends take hold
Contacts with foreigners are
bound to continue on a greater
scale than in previous eras, and
many of the liberalization
trends appear to have taken
hold. The April 30 edition of
Newsweek noted that Chinese
newspapers remain "readable,
lively and frank" in spite of the
crackdown.

The modernization effort
stressed by the current leader
ship requires that some free
doms persist. Creativity is
necessary and exposure to
foreigners is inevitable as trade
expands.
Some observers see the es
tablishment of a permanent
dissident movement within
China, which may work to
transform the nature of
Chinese domestic politics.
Others envision continued
tight control of freedom in
China, with alternating periods
of slight relaxation and restric
tion.
Political Science Prof. Harry
Harding noted the similarity
between the present liberaliza
tion and crackdown with the
brief liberalization of the
Hundred Flowers campaign,
initiated by Mao Zedong (Mao
Tse-tung) in 1957, and the sub
sequent repression. "One has
a sense of deja vu," he said.
Harding cited the Chinese'
own accounts that the repres
sion in 1957 and 1958 had its
effects for 20 years.
Although the current
crackdown does not appear to
be as severe as that of 1957, it
may signal a new era of repres
sion in China.

racy, while wall posters de
manded human rights. Criti
cism extended to the basic
tenets of Maoist socialism, the
foundation of Chinese politics
and society.
Too much dissent
This cry of dissent apparently
exceeded limits acceptable to
the government. Following a
speech to party leaders by
Deng in late March, restric
tions were gradually reim
posed. Articles in the People's
Daily and the Worker's Daily
began attacking the content of
many wall posters as
"bourgeois" and "not of the
proletariat." Plainclothesmen
now police "democracy wall"

and arrest authors of posters
denouncing government rep
ression. On March 29 a Beijing
municipal revolutionary com
mittee served public notice
that people must strive tor
"socialist democracy" rather
than "bourgeois democracy."
The crackdown on liberaliza
tion coincides with a general
reassessment of China's mod
ernization goals. As govern
ment officials moved to slow
the pace of industrialization,
lapanese businesses specu
lated that earlier contracts
might be canceled. While no
contracts have been canceled
yet, Western businesses such
as Intercontinental Hotels
Corp. appear unsure of the
status of agreements made
with the Chinese last year.
Nevertheless, in both the
economic and political
spheres, China is farfromalter
ing its basic goals. The Four
Modernizations still rank as the
prime objectives of Deng's re
gime, and the role for foreign
concerns has not been refuted.
Trends take hold
Contacts with foreigners are
bound to continue on a greater
scale than in previous eras, and
many of the liberalization
trends appear to have taken
hold. The April 30 edition of
Newsweek noted that Chinese
newspapers remain "readable,
lively and frank" in spite of the
crackdown.

The modernization effort
stressed by the current leader
ship requires that some free
doms persist. Creativity is
necessary and exposure to
foreigners is inevitable as trade
expands.
Some observers see the es
tablishment of a permanent
dissident movement within
China, which may work to
transform the nature of
Chinese domestic politics.
Others envision continued
tight control of freedom in
China, with alternating periods
of slight relaxation and restric
tion.
Political Science Prof. Harry
Harding noted the similarity
between the present liberaliza
tion and crackdown with the
brief liberalization of the
Hundred Flowers campaign,
initiated by Mao Zedong (Mao
Tse-tung) in 1957, and the sub
sequent repression. "One has
a sense of deja vu," he said.
Harding cited the Chinese'
own accounts that the repres
sion in 1957 and 1958 had its
effects for 20 years.
Although the current
crackdown does not appear to
be as severe as that of 1957, it
may signal a new era of repres
sion in China.
Free expression and criti
cism of the government,
openly solicited by the
Chinese government just last
fall, appear to be facing new
limitations from the Beijing
(Peking) regime.
The newest wave in Chinese
domestic policy was signaled
by the April 20 edition of Beij
ing Review which stated that in
the recent liberalization, "un
healthy things, though few and
isolated, have also emerged."
Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping
(Teng Hsiao-p'ing) moved last
year to relax the constraints on
personal expression and dis
sent as part of the nation's
overall drive toward moderni

the repression of the im
mediate post-Mao era was un
likely to respond creatively and
effectively to the challenges of
the Four Modernizations. By
fostering a spirit of individual
freedom and constructive
criticism, he hoped to re
vitalize the nation.
Surprising candor
Chinese found themselves
free to make contact with
foreigners, and even to dabble
in Western hairstyles and fash
ions. Chinese willingness to
talk and candor surprised
foreign correspondents. A
grain keeper from a commune
near Shanghai confided to
Newsweek reporters, "Before
we were miserable. We didn't
have enough to eat, and we
wore homemade clothes."
The Chinese press extolled
the value of democracy,
people's rights and criticism of
the government. "If the people
could not air their views on
state affairs and cannot
criticize party and government
functionaries including lead
ers," a Feb. 20 People's Daily
editorial stated, "would not all
this talk about socialist democ
racy be so much empty talk?"
Not surprisingly, many
youths and workers seized the
opportunity to air their frustra
tions and criticisms stemming
from the Cultural Revolution
and the "Gang of Four" period.
