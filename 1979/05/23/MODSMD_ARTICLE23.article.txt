# Peaceful future in store for Taiwan?
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
Since the beginning of
negotiations between the Un
ited States and the People's
Republic of China (PRC) re
garding normalization of rela
tions, U.S. policy has been
characterized by a continued
and predominating interest in
the peaceful resolution of the
Taiwan issue.
But now that normalization
has been achieved, what hap
pens next? What does the fu
ture hold for Taiwan?
There are two major issues
regarding Taiwan. The first is
the problem of reunifying
Taiwan and the mainland.
Since 1949, when Chiang Kai-
Shek's forces were defeated by
Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung)'s
communists and took refuge
on Taiwan, both sides have
claimed sovereignty over the
other.
The second is a long term
problem— whether Taiwan
will survive as an independent
economic entity.
Americans should have little
cause to fear use of force by the
PRC. Though China's vice
premier Deng Xiaoping (Teng
Hsiao-p'ing) has not ruled out
that possibility, there are the
factors of capabilities and dis
incentives to consider.
In the short and medium
term, the PRC does not have
the capability to launch and
successfully complete a milit
ary invasion of Taiwan. Even if
it did, the costs of such an op
eration in terms of lives lost
and economic drain would be
tremendous.
The potential of nuclear
threat does hold some credibil
ity, in the sense of technical
feasibility.
But given China's alienation
from the Soviet bloc and its
consequent dependence on
the West for the technology
and capital it needs to moder
nize, the likelihood of such a
threat is minimal, barring radi
cal change in thinking and
capability within China.
Thus the single greatest dis
incentive to the use of any
force by the PRC is the pros
pect of undoing by one simple

act the fruits of all the years of
effort and negotiation with the
West.
A more likely problem facing
Taiwan lies in the realm of
economics. One of the results
of normalization will be the ac
celeration of the mainland's
economy as a resultof an influx
of imported technologies and
foreign capital.
Beijing (Peking) has already
declared its intention to ex
pand production of steel, tex
tiles, and light manufactures
which would compete directly
with exports from Taiwan.
Eventually, the Taiwanese
economy could find itself in
serious trouble, undercut by
lower-priced competitors in
China.
Given Taiwan's excellent
track record in industry and
economics (its economy grew
at an average rate of 8.7 per
cent from 1960 to 1977), it is
unlikely that such competition
would spell doom for the is
land.
However, unless the
Taiwanese can effectively re
structure their economy, mov
ing up the ladder of technology
in their production methods
and products, they could find
themselves subject to consid
erable economic pressures —
arousing concern from
Washington.
Ironically, those economic
pressures may push Taiwan to,
of all things, join forces with
the PRC — combining the
one's extensive labor supply
with the other's advanced in
dustry, technical know-how
and capital resources.
The PRC has lent a degree of
realism to this prospect. Beij
ing has indicated its willing
ness to offer Taiwan a degree
of autonomy within the
framework of PRC sovereignty,
reducing the present ideologi
cal chasm separating the two to
a mere 75 miles of ocean.
A great deal of evidence in
dicates that the Taiwan issue
will not end in conflict.
Chinese on both sides have at
least stated their desire for a
peaceful resolution of their 30
year separation.
