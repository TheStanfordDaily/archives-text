## An introductory note 
### 
Foreign affairs and foreign policy are
everyone's business. An informed public is
the best means of assuring that our nation
brings to its view of the world an accurate
reflection of our national interests and our
national values.
Developing the habit of keeping informed
about international relations and interna
tional developments is an important part of
university learning. In addition, it is fascinat
ing. It is a daily exercise for the mind as im
portant as regular exercise for the body.
To avoid ignorance of foreign affairs re
quires exposure to the mixture of facts,
analysis and opinion which the Daily prom
ises its readers in this new venture.
The Daily will better serve the academic
community by increasing the space and im
proving the quality of the content devoted to
foreign affairs. The cynicism, mistrust and

suspicion often directed at foreign affairs and
foreign policy can be overcome by greater
exposure to the complexity of the world to
day.
The study of international relations is
neither an exact nor a dismal science. It is,
rather, a lesson in the human equation, with
all its variables, all its weaknesses and all its
expectations.
America and Americans cannot retreat
from the world any more than we can order it
into a mold of our design.
But we can hope to understand and im
prove it, recognizing that what goes on ab
road influences our daily life and our future
well-being.
