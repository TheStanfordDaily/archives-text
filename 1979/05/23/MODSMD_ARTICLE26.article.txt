# ASEAN getting stronger
## 
### Steve Chelberg 
Rapid and sustained economic growth to
gether with vast natural resource wealth and a
strategic location astride vital sea lanes has led
to speculation that ASEAN (the Association of
South East Asian Nations) may become a potent
force in the international economic and political
arena.
Whether or not this speculation is well
founded will depend upon the success ASEAN
has in overcoming organizational problems as
well as the success member nations have in re
solving their own internal problems.
"The Association of South East Asian Nations
has emerged in the 1970s as unquestionably the
fastest growing region in the world" a European
Economic Community (EEC) memorandum now
aclyiowledges. Growth from 1970 to 1976 among
ASEAN member nations averaged 6.7 percent
compared with 3 percent for developed coun
tries on the aggregate and 2.7 percent for the
EEC.
ASEAN was founded in 1967 by Thailand, In
donesia, thePhilippines,Singapore and Malaysia
in order to develop a zone of "peace, freedom
and neutrality." These nations envisaged the
creation of an economic union similar to that of
the European Economic Community.
A first step in this process is the creation of a
regional free trade zone accomplished by prog
ressively lowering intra-regional tariff barriers.
So far, ASEAN has met with only limited success
in achieving either its general or specific objec
tives.
The most important accomplishment of
ASEAN is that it has provided a forum for reg
ional communication, cooperation and de
velopment. Open communication has
minimized intra-regional conflicts and fostered
an awareness of common interests and prob
lems.
Trade agreement
Through a preferential trading agreement,
ASEAN has achieved tariff reductions on 826
items with a further 500 to be added shortly.
ASEAN is establishing agreement among its
member nations for a guarantee of investments
and avoidance of double taxation.
It is also formulating broad criteria for the
award of ASEAN status to investment projects

countries on the aggregate and 2.7 percent for the EEC.

which would then be guaranteed complete ac
cess to the regional market free of all tariff and
quota barriers. ASEAN is considering the crea
tion of regional resource development banks to
galvanize indigenous rather than foreign in
vestment within the region.
ASEAN has also become an internationally
recognized organization. Both lapan and the
United States, who are ASEAN's leading trade
partners, have established formal relations with
ASEAN.
But despite this progress, there are significant
barriers and problems which may prevent
ASEAN from realizing its objectives.
Need industrialization
The ASEAN objective of establishing a com
prehensive regional organization like the EEC is
not likely to be achieved until all five member
nations have undergone greater industrializa
tion.

Apart from Singapore, the four other coun
tries are largely primary producers which import
large quantities of capital and consumer goods.
Insufficient interdependence within ASEAN will
likely inhibit the growth of intra-regional trade
and cooperation.
The EEC has established formal relations with
ASEAN and is seeking improved investment and
trade relations. In February of this year a confer
ence on industrial cooperation, sponsored by
the European Commission (executive arm of the
EEC) and the ASEAN governments took place in
Jakarta.
Though the conference resulted in few busi
ness contracts, it did represent an important
effort in improving EEC-ASEAN relations.
ASEAN may also find it difficult to formulate
more than broad, general objectives due to the
particular problems faced by each nation.
Particular problems
Indonesia, a member of OPEC and the largest
ASEAN nation, confronts the problem of effec
tively utilizing its oil revenues to meet the needs
of its 120 million citizens. In addition, it is suffer
ing the effects of 20 to 25 percent inflation
caused by recent devaluations in its currency
and the rising costs of imported goods.
Singapore, smaller but more advanced than
the other ASEAN nations, and relying primarily
on shipping, airlines, tourism and the export of
electronic goods, is likely to feel the effects of a
world economic slowdown and global inflation.
Malaysia is the least likely nation to encounter
economic difficulties in the near future given its
government's expansionary measures, its broad
based commodity exports and a high level of
diversified manufactured goods.
The other two ASEAN nations, thePhilippines
and Thailand, are expected to have inflation
rates of 17 and 9 percent respectively as a result
of recent oil price increases. They also face the
problems of the rising costs of imports, expand
ing food production and the extension of infra
structure development into rural areas.
Although the ASEAN region has remained re
markably stable relative to other regions of the
world over the past 20 years, there are potential
sources of political instability.
Instability?
Indonesia and Thailand are ruled by military

regimes and the Philippines by the authoritarian
government of President Ferdinand Marcos. All
three countries face pressures for increased
democratization and the problem of ensuring a
peaceful transition to successor governments.
Malaysia has a problem of ethnic conflict bet
ween indigenous Malays and overseas Chinese.
Several countries have a highly unequal dis
tribution of income which contributes to politi
cal unrest.
ASEAN has made some limited progress to
wards achieving its objective of developing a
zone of "peace, freedom and neutrality." Yet
due to the significant problems which remain, it
is unlikely that ASEAN will ever play a role com
mensurate with that of the EEC. Nevertheless,
ASEAN's growing economic importance, vast
stores of natural resource wealth and strategic
location portends the association's growing im
portance in international affairs.
