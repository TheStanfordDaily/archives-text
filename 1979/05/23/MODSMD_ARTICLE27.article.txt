# Editor's note

### 
Today the Daily initiates a new feature — the Foreign
Affairs page — in an effort to expand coverage of global
issues.
The goal here is to present issues confronting nr'ions
and regions around the world and explain why those issues
are important to the nations involved, to the United States
and to the reader.
Articles on this page will be interpretive in nature and will
seek to avoid editorial comment.
The Daily is looking for balanced analyses of particular
issues, with sufficient background to allow an unfamiliar
reader to grasp the significance of the issue.
We hope to publish one Foreign Affairs page weekly,
focusing on a particular geographical area.
This week's topic is Asia, and next week's subject will be
Africa. The focus will depend mainly on the material availa
ble — we are looking for writers.
If you are interested in writing for the Foreign Affairs
page or have any comments or criticisms about the page,
please address them to Mark Nassutti, Foreign Affairs
editor, The Stanford Daily, Storke Student Publications
Building, Stanford, Ca., 94305, or call 497-4632.
All material submitted for publication must be no more
than four pages and typed double-spaced on a 57-space
line. The Daily reserves the right to edit for style and clarity.
