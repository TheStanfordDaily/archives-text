# Refugees escape, flood Indochina
## 
### Susan Essoyan 
Close to one million re
fugees have fled Indochina
since the fall of Saigon in 1975
and U.S. Refugee Coordinator
Dick Clark, who just returned
from Southeast Asia, predicts
that the exodus will escalate.
Refugees escape overland
from Laos and Cambodia into
Thailand. Vietnamese refugees
flee by boat to temporary
asylum in neighboring coun
tries.
Increasing numbers of Cam
bodians and Laotians are
forced to return to their coun
tries and many are killed when
they return. Over half of the
Vietnamese "boat people"
perish at sea, victims of piracy
and drowning.
Refugees who survive the
trip are packed into squalid
camps in Thailand, Malaysia,
Hong Kong, Singapore and In
donesia. Initially sympathetic
to the refugees, these coun
tries now strictly limit the
number granted temporary
asylum.
Thailand's economy is reel
ing under the impact of 150,000
refugees now in camps. Tens
of thousands more cross the
border into Thailand each
week. Thai military authorities
have resorted to forcing re
fugees back into their own
countries after feeding and
supplying them as best they
can.
Over 70,000 more refugees
subsist in boat camps scattered
along the Malaysian coastline.
Malaysians, swamped by the
influx, now turn many of the
less-than-seaworthy boats out
to sea — often at gunpoint.
Despite the inhuman condi
tions awaiting refugees in
camps, the flow continues and
is even swelling. Refugees risk
their lives and those of their

children in search of political
and economic freedom.
"I just couldn't live under
the communist regime in Viet
nam," Dr. Cao-duong Pham, a
refugee now living in Califor
nia, explained.
Pham told horror stories of
life in re-education camps
where those associated with
the previous regime are sent.
Pham said authorities locked
his brother up in a metal con
tainer for several days, feeding
him through a small hole.
The first wave of Vietnamese
refugees in 1975 consisted
largely of people associated
with the previous regime and
the American forces, along
with thousands who simply
didn't want to live under
Communist rule.
The traditional Vietnamese
attachment to their land led
observers to believe that the
1975 exodus would abate
rapidly but it has not.
The current flood of Viet
namese refugees, which began
in January 1978, contains large
numbers of ethnic Chinese.
Analysts suspect that the Viet
namese government is en
couraging them to leave, after
extracting stiff fees from them.
The ethnic Chinese, who are
mostly merchants and entrep
reneurs, are willing to pay
thousands of dollars in gold to
escape Vietnamese govern
ment discrimination.

The communist takeovers in
Laos and Cambodia, as well as
Vietnam's invasion of Cam
bodia, have unleashed further
waves of refugees.
Though the refugees' plight
has caught world attention, na
tions have yet to respond sig
nificantly to the crisis. The Un
ited States, France, Australia,
Germany, Canada and Brazil
grant permanent asylum to
some refugees, but they are
few compared to the total
number of refugees.
The United States officially
accepts 17,400 world refugees
each year but U.S. Attorney
General Griffin Bell has used
his emergency parole powers
to admit tens of thousands
more into the country. The
administration's proposed Re
fugee Act of 1979 would raise
the normal refugee allotment
to 50,000 per year.
Indochinese refugees here,
now totaling 220,000, have set
tled in well, with the majority
now employed.
The State Department sc
reens all Indochinese re
fugees, giving preference to
those with relatives here and
other American associations.
The government requires an
American sponsor for each re
fugee. The screening process
seems to favor professionals.
Many potential host coun
tries apparently fear economic
domination by Vietnamese.
Some Australians have advo
cated strict patrolling of their
shores to prevent "illegal en
trants," for fear they will take
already scarce Australian jobs.
Japan, one of the richest
countries in Asia, has refused
toadmit more than a handful of
Indochinese refugees for per
manent residence, citing dif
ficulties in resettling them.
Hundreds of thousands are

left in camps in Southeast
Asia, their numbers increasing
in record proportions. The Un
ited Nations High Commis
sioner for Refugees subsidizes
their care under a special
budget, but emigration is the
refugees' only real route out of
limbo.
The United States is seen as a
natural home for the refugees.
Not only is it a nation of immig
rants, but many believe the Un
ited States has a certain re
sponsibility, amounting virtu
ally to a moral obligation —
particularly to the Vietnamese.
Representatives of South
east Asian nations, the United
Nations refugee agency, the
United States and other host
countries met in Jakarta, In
donesia, last week to discuss
the Indochinese refugee prob
lem. The 24-nation conference
indicated no lightening of the
flow of refugees.
A ranking Vietnamese dip
lomat at the conference said
that 400,000 to 600,000 more
Vietnamese, whom he called
"gentlemen of the old re
gime," still want to leaVe
southern Vietnam. The official
said they would be allowed to
leave only when other nations
had agreed to grant them
asylum.
The conference agreed to es
tablish a "processing center"
for Indochinese refugees on an
Indonesian island.
