# Begin's Israel still troubled
## 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) — Two years
after winning an upset election
victory and despite credit for
the first peace treaty between
Israel and an Arab state, Prime
Minister Menachem Begin's
government is in trouble at
home. The economy is a
shambles, his cabinet is beset
by dissension and the govern
ment suffers a lack of public

confidence.
Begin enters his third year in
office faced with the stern chal
lenge of negotiating Palesti
nian self-rule on the West Bank
of Jordan River and the Gaza
Strip.
Defense Minister Ezer
Weizman and Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan, both popular
cabinet figures, are so upset by

Begin's autonomy plan that
they at first refused to take part
in the talks with Egypt starting
Friday. Only a plea from others
in the Cabinet and a promise
that the Begin plan would be
used only as a guideline and
not a hard-and-fast working
paper brought the two minis
ters back to the six-man team
that will negotiate Israel's posi

tion.
Weizman and Dayan believe
Israel should open the talks
with vague formulas rather
than a detailed plan.
The cabinet dispute and a
shattering government report
of nearly 9 percent inflation in
April threw cold water on a
celebration by Begin's Herut
Party to mark the May 17, 1977

election, which Israelis still call
the upheaval.
"Baldly stated, his (Begin's)
government is doing a poor job
of government," said the in
dependent Jerusalem Post in
an editorial last week. "Gov
erning a country is an infinitely
more complex affair than sign
ing a peace treaty even with a
31-year enemy."
