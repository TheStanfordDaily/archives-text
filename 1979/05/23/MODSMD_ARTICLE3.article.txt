Health officials, environmental groups and at least
five Bay Area congressmen have recently questioned
safety measures of U.C.'s Lawrence Livermore
Laboratories.
They have called for measures ranging from studies
of health conditions at the facility to removal of
radioactive materials and conversion of the labs to
so-called "peaceful" uses.
The labs, 40 miles east of the campus, are located
on or near 13 active earthquake faults. Some of the
buildings contain plutonium and other radioactive
materials.
They are the center of the nation's nuclear arms
research and development.
At a public inquiry April 12 and 13, Friends of the
Earth (FOE), an international environmental group
based in the Bay Area, demanded that the Energy
Dept. remove all plutonium and other radioactive
material from the labs and convert them for use in
energy research.
The public hearing was held to debate the DOE's
Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the labs
issued last Sept. FOE testified the labs cannot with
stand the maximum possible horizontal acceleration
during an earthquake.
The labs, constructed in 1952, are designed to with
stand horizontal acceleration equivalent to one-half
tbe acceleration of gravity at sea level, .sg.
Two studies made by Livermore and Berkeley en
gineering geologists estimated the potential "g"

value in an earthquake could go as high as .8.
Independent consultant
The labs have hired a third independent consultant
who has said the maximum horizontal force would be
.sg. Glen Barlow of FOE said lab officials have chosen
to use the more conservative estimate of .5g as the
maximum possible force.
Lab spokesman Jeff Garberson agreed that the labs
are only designed to withstand .sg, but said resear
chers have analyzed the buildings and found that
they will withstand up to .Bg.
There are no plans for major structural modifica
tions at the labs, but Garberson said there are con
tinuous seismic and geologic investigations.
Possible damage
In a letter to the Energy Dept., FOE expressed con
cern that earthquake damage to the building would
cause the release of clouds of radioactive gases and
plutonium.
The department also maintains that evacuation of
the Bay Area following an earthquake would be com
plicated by earthquake damage to roads and rail
lines.
Four and one-half million people live within a 40-
mile radius of the labs.
Garberson said that even if the building housing
the plutonium was damaged, the plutonium ingots
themselves would not be a heaith or environmental
hazard. He said the ingots are in steel casing in a
vault.
