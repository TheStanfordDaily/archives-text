# The 						nuke lab controversy...

Health officials, environmental groups and at least
five Bay Area congressmen have recently questioned
safety measures of U.C.'s Lawrence Livermore
Laboratories.
They have called for measures ranging from studies
of health conditions at the facility to removal of
radioactive materials and conversion of the labs to
so-called "peaceful" uses.
The labs, 40 miles east of the campus, are located
on or near 13 active earthquake faults. Some of the
buildings contain plutonium and other radioactive
materials.
They are the center of the nation's nuclear arms
research and development.
At a public inquiry April 12 and 13, Friends of the
Earth (FOE), an international environmental group
based in the Bay Area, demanded that the Energy
Dept. remove all plutonium and other radioactive
material from the labs and convert them for use in
energy research.
The public hearing was held to debate the DOE's
Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the labs
issued last Sept. FOE testified the labs cannot with
stand the maximum possible horizontal acceleration
during an earthquake.
The labs, constructed in 1952, are designed to with
stand horizontal acceleration equivalent to one-half
tbe acceleration of gravity at sea level, .sg.
Two studies made by Livermore and Berkeley en
gineering geologists estimated the potential "g"

value in an earthquake could go as high as .8.
Independent consultant
The labs have hired a third independent consultant
who has said the maximum horizontal force would be
.sg. Glen Barlow of FOE said lab officials have chosen
to use the more conservative estimate of .5g as the
maximum possible force.
Lab spokesman Jeff Garberson agreed that the labs
are only designed to withstand .sg, but said resear
chers have analyzed the buildings and found that
they will withstand up to .Bg.
There are no plans for major structural modifica
tions at the labs, but Garberson said there are con
tinuous seismic and geologic investigations.
Possible damage
In a letter to the Energy Dept., FOE expressed con
cern that earthquake damage to the building would
cause the release of clouds of radioactive gases and
plutonium.
The department also maintains that evacuation of
the Bay Area following an earthquake would be com
plicated by earthquake damage to roads and rail
lines.
Four and one-half million people live within a 40-
mile radius of the labs.
Garberson said that even if the building housing
the plutonium was damaged, the plutonium ingots
themselves would not be a heaith or environmental
hazard. He said the ingots are in steel casing in a
vault.
Plutonium is in its most dangerous form when it is
being milled. This is done in an airtight container,
because when plutonium shavings contact air they
spontaneously ignite.
Gunderson said the dust and chips are reprocessed
and the airtight containers removed daily. He added
that there are complex air pressure systems which
insure that no air could contact plutonium even dur
ing an earthquake.
FOE asserts it is not possible to guarantee total
security against the release of plutonium and other
dangerous substances into the environment.
Since 1960, there have been 10 reported accidents
at the labs, of which only one, in 1963, could be
termed a "nuclear accident," according to Garber
son. The other nine were "spills and accidental re
leases," he said.
Accidental releases
The "nuclear accident" occurred in March 1963
during an experiment. Garberson said a "nuclear
excursion"—a sudden, unexpected surge of
power—took place because of mechanical failure. He
stated that some radioactivity was released from the
room, but there was no exposure to workers or pub
lic citizens.
The "spills and accidental releases" included the
following:
—September 1965: A plastic bag containing
plutonium caught fire in a building. The building was
decontaminated and none of the material escaped,
Garberson said.
—May to June 1967: Plutonium was released into

the Livermore sewer system but Carberson said the
amount was extremely low and there was no danger
of contamination.
—August 1978: A worker accidentally took radioac
tive waste to the Livermore dump. Carberson said
there was no exposure and all the material was re
moved.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has no
authority over the labs, although all accidents are
reported to the Energy Dept.
Carberson said the federal authorities went
downwind after the accidents and checked for con
tamination, particularly in the food chain, but no
evidence of contamination was found.
At the Energy Dept. hearings, FOE and health offi
cials testified that insufficient study has been done on
the environmental imnact of the labs.
They called for a full scale study into the increased
numbers of cancers which have allegedly been
caused by radioactive substances released from the
LLL.
Five Bay Area congressmen signed a petition calling
for the immediate removal of plutonium stored at the
labs. The petition was sent to Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger May 10.
The congressmen are: )ohn Burton (D-San
Francisco/Marin), Phillip Burton (D-San Francisco),
Konald Dellums (D-Berkeley), Don Edwards (D-San
Jose), and Ceorge Miller (Richmond).
Carberson could not state how much plutonium is
kept at the labs because it is classified information.
Flowever, FOE estimates range up to 4% lbs. and
Carberson agreed that it is "a significant amount."
