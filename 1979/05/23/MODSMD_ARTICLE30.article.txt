# NCAA tennis competition continues
## Netters down Princeton 
### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's men's tennis team
extended its post-season win
ning streak to 10 matches yes
terday with an easy 7-2 win over
Princeton, in Athens, Ga.
Princeton was without top
player )ay Lapidus, who was
out with a bad ankle, but No. 2
man Leif Shiras filled in admir
ably. He was beaten badly in
the first set 6-1 by Peter Re
nnert, but came back strongly
in the final two sets losing just
five games to reverse the deci
sion. For Rennert it was the
second straight day he was
beaten after winning the first
set.
Although the loss of Lapidus
did not hurt in Princeton's first
slot, it took its toll down the
line. Princeton was only able to
win one more match when
Adam Cioth took a 5-4 first set
tiebreaker from Scott Bondur
ant and then won the second

set by a single service break.
However, that was the extent
of the Princeton scoring for the
day. In fact, except for a tight
three setter in the third dou
bles match, Princeton went
rather quietly.
Cameron Stout, playing No.
6, made the most respectable
showing, mustering up seven
games in his match with Jim
Hodges. Hodges was again a
double winner as he teamed
with Bondurant for an easy 6-2,
6-3 win at second doubles.
Tim Mayotte and Jeff Arons
were pushed to three sets for
one of the few times this year
but kept their record perfect
with a 7-5, 6-7, 6-3 win at third
doubles.
The 7-2 win placed the Cards
in the semifinals today against
top seeded UCLA. The Bruins
put together a desperation
comeback yesterday to squeak

by Pepperdines-4. Pepperdine
led 4-2 after the singles and
only needed to win one of the
three doubles matches to post
their first win over UCLA.
Joining the Cards and Bruins
in the semifinals are the two
Texas powers, SMU and Trin
ity. Trinity defeated Cal 6-3,
and SMU took care of USC 6-2
togain theirspots in the semis.
Stanford and UCLA split
their two matches earlier this
season each winning easily on
their home courts. UCLA took
all six singles en route to an 8-1
win in mid-April in Westwood.
Stanford, however, returned
the favor last week drubbing
the Bruins 7-2 on their home
surface.
The courts at Athens tend to
be more similar to those here
at Stanford so the Cards, who
have won their last 10 matches
this year, have an excellent
chance of knocking off the
Bruins again and stepping into
the finals.
SMU has beaten Trinity two
of the three times they have
played and therefore must be
the favorites tomorrow. Eric Is
kersky is playing No. 1 for Trin
ity, while )ai DiLouie holds
down the top spot for SMU.
UCLA is the only team with
wins over all the other
semifinalists and therefore on
paper must still be the favorite.
But as Rennert said earlier,
"On paper means nothing this
year."
