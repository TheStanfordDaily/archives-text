Seriously hampered by in
juries suffered during the regu
lar season, Stanford's track and
field corps tallied a mere 11
points in a last-place finish at
the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships last weekend.
Competing at Arizona State's
Sun Angel Stadium, the Cardi
nals exhibited a few bright per
formances from senior Roy
Kissin, sophomore Rick Buss
and freshman )ohn Schaer.
Buss took sixth place for one
point with a hammer throw of
more than 186 feet and Schaer
placed fourth, earning four
points in the 800 meter race
with a time of 1:48.3. Kissin

added six points to the Card
cause by finishing third in the
10,000 meterevent, in 29:20.8.
Stanford ended the regular
season with a 4-4 mark in dual
meets and had to head to
Tempe without the talents of
Darrin Nelson and with javelin
thrower Gary Bruner and
sprinter Gordon Banks in poor
shape following late-season in
juries.
Bruner, with the fifth longest
throw in Card track history was
suffering from elbow problems
while Banks, a key to the 400-
relay quartet was troubled by a
badly sprained ankle, accord
ing to head coach Payton Jor
dan.
