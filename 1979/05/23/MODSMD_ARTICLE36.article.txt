Democrats contest oil deregulation
Washington — In a test vote yesterday, House Democ
rats expressed nearly two-to-one opposition to Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's plan to lift price controls from
domestically produced oil.
On a 153-82 vote, the House Democratic Caucus re
jected an attempt to sidetrack a resolution expressing
opposition to Carter's oil deregulation move.
"This is a complete repudiation of the president's
position," said Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) after the
vote. "The Democratic Party has put the president on
notice that the litmus test of the 1980 elections will be
how he comes to grips with energy problems."
A vote by the House Democratic Caucus — composed
of all 276 House Democrats, on the anti-decontrol resol
ution had been scheduled for yesterday. But after the
vote to reject a motion to kill the resolution, the caucus
was forced to recess for lack of time, delaying final
action until today.
Western nations urge coal usage
Paris— Industrial Western nations gave coal a massive
boost yesterday choosing it over atomic power and as a
prime weapon against the energy crisis and the skyroc
keting price of oil.
The International Energy Agency (lEA), a 20-nation
group founded in 1974 as a counterbalance to the pet
rodollar might of the Organization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries (OPEC), ended a two-day meeting with a
call for "greatly increased coal use."
It also reinforced earlier decisions to cut back oil con
sumption among member states by 5 percent and played
down the role of nuclear energy.
The lEA urged governments to improve the financial
allure of coal mining, build railways and ports to handle
coal, and sharpen any vague coal policies.
It encouraged countries "with the potential for large
increases in coal production," especially the United
States, Canada and Australia, to step up coal output. It
asked other countries to import coal rather than oil.

Florida executions delayed
Starke, Fla. — The scheduled executions of con
demned murderers John Spenkelink and Willie Jasper
Darden were derailed yesterday when federal judges
granted both men stays of execution.
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, acting less
than seven hours before the condemned murderer was
to have died in Florida's electric chair, told state officials
to keep Spenkelink alive until the full Supreme Court
could consider his last-gasp appeal at its regularly
scheduled closed conference tomorrow.
"Given. . . the irrevocable nature of the penalty to be
imposed and the ability of the full court to consider this
case within 36 hours at our regular conference, I believe
it appropriate to grant the application for a stay until
further action by the entire court," Marshall said in a
brief order signed by him at 12:15 a.m. today.
Spenkelink was the second of the two to be temporar
ily spared execution in the electric chair,

Jones average of 30 industrials finished with a 2.94 gain at
845.37.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange picked up to
30.40 million shares from 25.55 million Monday.
