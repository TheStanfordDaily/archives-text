# Joe Clark defeats Trudeau
## 
### 
Toronto (AP) — )oe Clark, an un
tested 39-year-old newcomer, led
the Progressive Conservatives to vic
tory over the long-entrenched Liber
als of Pierre Elliott Trudeau in Cana
da's national election yesterday, but
failed to win a clear majority and will
have to form a minority government.
Clark carried out a campaign to
dump Trudeau on the issues of the
economy, inflation and unemploy
ment, although the nation faces the
long-range problem of the separatist

movement in French-speaking
Quebec.
With incomplete returns from all
but one of 282 districts for House of
Commons seats, the Conservatives
appeared to have won 136, the Liber
als 112, the socialistic New Democ
rats 26 and the-conservative-leaning
Social Credit Party 6.
A majority is 142 or more seats.
Under the Canadian system, the
party winning a majority of the seats
generally forms the new government

and its leader becomes prime minis
ter. But if no party wins a majority,
the one with a plurality—the highest
number of seats—then is called upon
to form a minority government with
help from a third party.
Trudeau was re-elected to his own
seat in Montreal, meaning he will re
turn to the House of Commons as a
member but not as prime minister.
At Clark's headquarters in Spruce
Grove, Alberta, an aide watching the
returns with the Conservative leader
said Clark was "jubilant and grinning
from ear to ear."
The outcome of Canada's election
of a new 282-seat House of Com
mons could be critical in determin
ing whether separatist-minded
Quebec secedes or stays within the
112-year-old confederation.
Trudeau, Liberal Party prime
minister for 11 years, said only he
could keep Canada whole. Chal
lenger Clark, who would become the
world's youngest major government
chief, told the voters the nation's
sluggish economy needed rescue
and it was time for a change at the
top.
Returns from eastern Canada
pointed to a Clark victory, even
though his party was trailing in seats
won, but the Conservatives had cut
into Liberal strongholds and were
counting on their strength in the
West to bring them through.
