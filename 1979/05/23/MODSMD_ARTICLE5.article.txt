## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
Attention, juniors! You have been
BASHed. After enduring more than a
month of uncertainty and numerous
re-votes, Asst. Elections Commis
sioner Chris Noonan announced
yesterday that the BASH slate of Gray
Boyce, Alan Alpert, Sandra Shanker
and Dave Hood slipped by the
Natural Choice of Mike Kavoukjian,
lanet Rappaport, )eff Merrill and
Connie Ordway, 272-262, in polling
for senior class presidents.
After the original compilations of
the BASH-Natural Choice run-off had
been made more than two weeks

ago, then-Elections Commissioner
Dayna Goldfine discovered several
polling violations had occurred in
the overseas balloting.
Therefore, at its May 10 meeting,
the ASSU Senate appointed a com
mittee composed of the Council of
Presidents, Noonan and both slates
to oversee new polling efforts at
Cliveden, Tours, Vienna, Berlin and
the Hopkins Marine Station.
The results from on-campus voting
April 25 and 26 and the Florence
campus gave BASH a senate-certified
244-224 edge, which they narrowly
retained as the last results were re
ceived from Berlin yesterday after
noon.
The official results remain contin
gent upon senate approval Thursday
night.
Relief was expressed by all in
volved parties. "Both slates have my
sympathies," said Noonan. He
added that, "As far as I know, no
discrepancies" took place in this
election.
'More than anything, we're glad to
have it over," Merrill of the Natural

Choice said. "I don't think anyone
on our slate is angry, and I think the
BASH slate will do a good job," he
said.
BASH members Alpert and Hood
echoed that sentiment. "We regret
that it (the elections) took so long
and that improprieties occurred in
the process," Hood said. "We're
happy, and we've got lots of great
plans," Alpert concluded.
Although hampered somewhat by
the delay in election results, "We
hope now we can get on the ball and
get some stuff done," Hood said.
