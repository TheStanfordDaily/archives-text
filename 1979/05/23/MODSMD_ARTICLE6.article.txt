# Gays hold peaceful party; White verdict views vary
## 
### Marilyn Rosenberg Samuel Howe 
As San Francisco's gay community
held a peaceful birthday party for its
slain leader, former Supervisor Har
vey Milk, campus opinions were
mixed on the verdict for the killer of
Milk and former Mayor George Mos
cone.
In sharp contrast to the rioting
immediately following former
Supervisor Dan White's voluntary
manslaughter conviction Monday,
last night's crowd of thousands sang,
danced and pleaded for peace on
Castro Street.
More than 300 volunteers worked
to keep last night's crowd under con
trol, but the mood was a completely
different one.
Reaction to the verdict at Stanford
was milder than that demonstrated
Monday night in San Francisco. Stan
ford Gay Peoples' Union member

Rhio Hiersch said he does "not con
sider the verdict to be offensive to
gay people."
Law School Prof. John Kaplan cal
led the verdict "defensible" under
California law and told a class yester
day, "Dan White is no more danger
ous than a large number of people."
Donald Lunde, Law School lec
turer, said the verdict was based on a
lack of evidence from the prosecu
tion that White committed planned,
premeditated murder. Lunde, who
testified for the defense at the trial,
also said that he did not believe the
lenient verdict would be an induce
ment for others to commit murder.
David Rosenhan, Law and
Psychology Prof., said he would not
comment on the justice of the ver
dict. Although he called present laws
relating to mental states in killings
"fair " he also said that there was
clearly not an equal access to justice
for all people in this country.
And Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo said that the jury made an in
correct decision, adding that White's
murder seemed to him "a case of
premeditated, first-degree murder."
Hiersch said he believes "the
reason he (White) didn't get justice is
because of economic reasons, be
cause he can afford a fast-talking
lawyer and four well-known
psychologists to take responsibility
for his actions."
Attempting to explain the violence
at City Hall, which he claimed was
the first collective act of violence by
gay people since the beginning of
the gay rights movement, Hiersch
described the makeup of the Civic
Center crowd.
According to Hiersch only 50 or 60
people were actively involved in the

violence. Most of these, he said,
were gays recruited from bars and
"fag bashers, young people who
commit violence against gays both
for money and for fun."
Violence avoided?
Much of the violence, Hiersch
said, could have been avoided if
Mayor Dianne Feinstein and the
Board of Supervisors had expressed
support for the gay community im
mediately after the reading of the
verdict. He said that, as it was, many
of the rioters thought that the mayor
and the board supported the deci
sion.
However, Kaplan, a former federal
prosecutor and federal law
specialist, said, "White was so upset,
so outraged, his fairly rigid personal
ity was so close to coming apart that
he may have lacked the capacity to
conform his conduct to the law when
the crime was committed. I see no
reason to think this decision was
wrong."
Although "not particularly pleased
with the verdict," Kaplan declared
that it is "clearly defensible under
California law â€” which almost no
body understands."
Lunde said that the reason for the
verdict was the lack of evidence on
the prosecution side that it was plan
ned premeditated murder.
"The jury," he said, "was, if any
thing, a pro-prosecution jury be
cause they were death qualified."
This means that all jury members
who were opposed to the death pen
alty were automatically dismissed.
Lunde explained that jury members
in favor of the death penalty are gen
erally known to be pro-prosecution.
When asked whether the decision
