# Senior professors get half-time option
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
Faculty members who reach 65 be
tween now and July 1, 1982 will be
presented with the option of retain
ing half-time status, President
Richard Lyman announced last week.
Lyman's decision followed two
months of heated debate in the Fa
culty Senate and was based on the
recommendations of an administra
tive retirement committee headed by
former Provost William Miller.
The University previously en
forced a mandatory retirement age of
65, but "over the last few years, two
thirds of the retired faculty were re
called on a part-time basis," accord
ing to Acting Provost Gerald Lieber
man.
Therefore, "We decided we might
as well do what is being done de
facto, " he said. "We felt that this
would satisfy the needs of the faculty
and the institutional needs of the
University" for new and younger fa

culty members.
The policy is not retroactive and
affects 67 members of the faculty. Al
though Lieberman said that most of
the group "never had the expecta
tion of rehiring until a couple of years
ago," they indicated in interviews
with their deans that very few would
voluntarily retire in the absence of
University regulations.
Retirement stipulations
Within that time, the national re
tirement age was advanced to 70, and
the California legislature passed a
law prohibiting mandatory retire
ment at any age.
That bill contains "a window"
which allows the continuance of
stipulated retirement ages until June
30,1982, and includes a passage stat
ing that "it is incumbent on the
employee" to prove capability,
Lieberman added.
Lyman denounced the California
law as "a piece of sweeping social
legislation . . . passed with a grossly
irresponsible attitude toward the
consequences."
The University is bound by state
and national law, so the status of
those professors who reach the for
merly "normal" retirement age of 65
from now on will be re-evaluated and
confirmed by legal requirements and
University policy as of July 1, 1982.
Loophole
The Miller committee had advised
Lyman to utilize the loophole in the
California law and continue its for
merly accepted practice until the
June 30,1982 cut-off. About 17 other
recommendations submitted by that
panel for future policy considera
tions are still being studied by the
administration, according to
Lieberman.
Lyman warned that without the fu
ture adoption of provisions to de

termine faculty competence, the
University would face "institutional
disaster." Nonetheless, "one faces
the prospect of putting such
mechanisms into place with grave
misgivings," he said.
"I doubt that the sum of human
happiness will have been increased
when it is no longer possible for a
retired scholar to say, 'I was going
strong, but I reached that mandatory
retirement age' and instead it be
comes necessary for some unknown
number, but surely larger than zero,
to say, 'They examined my compe
tence to continue and found it want
ing,'" he asserted.
No extra burden
Since this decision "reflects what
we've been doing I don't think it will
place any extra burden on the fi
nances of the University," Lieber
man said.
Lyman also maintained that the

decision is consistent with past pat
terns of University operations but
added that "there will still be severe
difficulties in protecting enough new
positions to make possible some
reasonable infusion of young faculty
members in the years just ahead."
On the same note, Lieberman
hypothesized that if "we raised the
retirement age to 70, the number of
junior faculty members would be re
duced for a short time," and a steady
state would then resume.
"We just haven't heard from the
faculty" concerning reactions to Ly
man's announcement, Lieberman
said yesterday, "but I'm sure that we
will."
The Faculty Senate created an
ad-hoc committee at its May 4 meet
ing to investigate the quality of life of
those professors who are already re
tired. Thus, that inquiry is not related
to Lyman's action, Lieberman noted.

added that "there will still be severe
difficulties in protecting enough new
positions to make possible some
reasonable infusion of young faculty
members in the years just ahead."
On the same note, Lieberman
hypothesized that if "we raised the
retirement age to 70, the number of
junior faculty members would be re
duced for a short time," and a steady
state would then resume.
"We just haven't heard from the
faculty" concerning reactions to Ly
man's announcement, Lieberman
said yesterday, "but I'm sure that we
will."
The Faculty Senate created an
ad-hoc committee at its May 4 meet
ing to investigate the quality of life of
those professors who are already re
tired. Thus, that inquiry is not related
to Lyman's action, Lieberman noted.
Faculty members who reach 65 be
tween now and July 1, 1982 will be
presented with the option of retain
ing half-time status, President
Richard Lyman announced last week.
Lyman's decision followed two
months of heated debate in the Fa
culty Senate and was based on the
recommendations of an administra
tive retirement committee headed by
former Provost William Miller.
The University previously en
forced a mandatory retirement age of
65, but "over the last few years, two
thirds of the retired faculty were re
called on a part-time basis," accord
ing to Acting Provost Gerald Lieber
man.
Therefore, "We decided we might
as well do what is being done de
facto, " he said. "We felt that this
would satisfy the needs of the faculty
and the institutional needs of the
University" for new and younger fa

culty members.
The policy is not retroactive and
affects 67 members of the faculty. Al
though Lieberman said that most of
the group "never had the expecta
tion of rehiring until a couple of years
ago," they indicated in interviews
with their deans that very few would
voluntarily retire in the absence of
University regulations.
Retirement stipulations
Within that time, the national re
tirement age was advanced to 70, and
the California legislature passed a
law prohibiting mandatory retire
ment at any age.
That bill contains "a window"
which allows the continuance of
stipulated retirement ages until June
30,1982, and includes a passage stat
ing that "it is incumbent on the
employee" to prove capability,
Lieberman added.
Lyman denounced the California
law as "a piece of sweeping social
legislation . . . passed with a grossly
irresponsible attitude toward the
consequences."
The University is bound by state
and national law, so the status of
those professors who reach the for
merly "normal" retirement age of 65
from now on will be re-evaluated and
confirmed by legal requirements and
University policy as of July 1, 1982.
Loophole
The Miller committee had advised
Lyman to utilize the loophole in the
California law and continue its for
merly accepted practice until the
June 30,1982 cut-off. About 17 other
recommendations submitted by that
panel for future policy considera
tions are still being studied by the
administration, according to
Lieberman.
Lyman warned that without the fu
ture adoption of provisions to de

termine faculty competence, the
University would face "institutional
disaster." Nonetheless, "one faces
the prospect of putting such
mechanisms into place with grave
misgivings," he said.
"I doubt that the sum of human
happiness will have been increased
when it is no longer possible for a
retired scholar to say, 'I was going
strong, but I reached that mandatory
retirement age' and instead it be
comes necessary for some unknown
number, but surely larger than zero,
to say, 'They examined my compe
tence to continue and found it want
ing,'" he asserted.
No extra burden
Since this decision "reflects what
we've been doing I don't think it will
place any extra burden on the fi
nances of the University," Lieber
man said.
Lyman also maintained that the

decision is consistent with past pat
terns of University operations but
added that "there will still be severe
difficulties in protecting enough new
positions to make possible some
reasonable infusion of young faculty
members in the years just ahead."
On the same note, Lieberman
hypothesized that if "we raised the
retirement age to 70, the number of
junior faculty members would be re
duced for a short time," and a steady
state would then resume.
