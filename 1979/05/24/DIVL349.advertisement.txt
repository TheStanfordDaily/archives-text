Special OATQ deadline
Because Monday is a University holiday, there will be no Daily. In
addition, in keeping with our two-business-days-before
publication deadline, Once Around the Quad announcement
forms for Tuesday and Wednesday are due at 1 p.m. today and
tomorrow respectively. No exceptions to deadlines can be made.
Beginning tomorrow, the Daily will again begin publishing Time
Schedule Changes, for the preliminary time schedule for Autumn
Quarter. As in the past, the Daily can only publish changes which
are submitted through the Registrar's Office.
