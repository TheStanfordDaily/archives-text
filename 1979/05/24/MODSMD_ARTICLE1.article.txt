# Device spots infant hearing loss
## 
### Susan Owen 
A University scientist, working
with a Palo Alto firm, has developed
a device which can detect an infant's
hearing loss in the first few weeks of
life.
According to Dr. Blair Simmons,
surgery professor and head of the
School of Medicine's division of
otolarynology (ear, nose and throat
studies), the "crib-o-gram" has
shown that deafness is 19 times more
likely in seriously ill babies than in
healthy babies.
Because of its ability to detect hear
ing problems early, the device has
"helped to get the ball rolling"
sooner towards infant hearing re
habilitation, Simmons said.
The crib-o-gram, said Simmons, is
based on an old "rat psychology
test" which measures an infant's
emotions before, during and after a
number of 92-decibel sounds are
emitted at 40-minute intervals from a
speaker located near the infant.
If the baby responds to the loud
sound, his startled movements are
picked up by an extremely strain
sensitive transducer placed under
the infant's mattress.
Infants tested
Research on the crib-o-gram
began in 1967 with grants from the
National Institute of Neurological
Diseases and Stroke. Since 1970,
13,000 healthy and intensive care in
fants have been tested at the Stan
ford Hospital, said Simmons, and the
results indicate that one in every 1000
healthy babies have hearing losses,
while one in 52 seriously ill babies
suffer from varying degrees of deaf
ness.
In the original version of the
crib-o-gram, 36 sounds were emitted
over a 24-hour testing period and in
formation about the infants' move
ments was interpreted onto a strip
chart, which was then graded by
hand.
According to Dr. William McFar
land, director of the federally funded
project, the hospital is now moving
toward using a new model which in
cludes a microprocessor, a small
computer which can administer 32
testing sounds at different intervals
during a three- to four-hour period
and grade each response within
micro-seconds.
This constitutes "an even more ob
jective test, totally unaffected by any
human bias as to whether or not this
child may have a problem," McFar

land said.
"To pass the test the baby must
respond to at least ten percent of all
scoreable tests," said Kathy Orlando,
a research assistant who regularly
administers the tests. "The new mic
roprocessor will not sound if a child
is in too deep a slumber. If someone
rang your doorbell and you were
sound asleep, you probably
wouldn't hear it either. The perfect
testing period for a baby is between
light sleep and relative inactivity."
Further testing
If the infant does not pass the test
with the crib-o-gram, said McFar
land, he is called back for further
testing when six to eight months old
in a sound booth using visual re
sponse audiometry, "a form of oper
ant conditioning which teaches a
baby to search for an animated toy
after presentation of a sound," said
McFarland.
Language abilities
Time is one of the biggest factors,
according to Simmons. Children
usually develop their language
abilities between the ages of three to
four months and five years, but be
fore the crib-o-gram, deafness was
usually detected when children were
about two and a half years old—more
than halfway into one of the most
vital learning periods of life, said
Simmons.
Aftera problem is initially detected
using a crib-o-gram, however, it typi
cally takes about 22 months before a
child is fitted with a hearing aide, due
to parents' disbelief and insis
tence on getting a second or
third opinion, said Simmons.
"But not everyone's a hot-shot when
it comes to young children," he said.
"It's easy for an audiologist who isn't
really sure to say, 'Let's see what he's
like in another couple of months.'"
Crandmothers are actually the
most common people to suspect
hearing inadequacies in children
who are often very good at "faking
out" doctors. "If a new parent slams
a door without waking a baby, he or
she will probably only be gra f eful not
to have caused a lot of loud bawling,
but a grandmother who has been
around children before will start to
wonder," said Simmons.
Special ed sooner
Simmons, who said he is now "on
the war-path" about the typical 22-
month delays, said he hopes that the
crib-o-gram will lessen the time lag
between initial detection and hear

ing rehabilitation and thus begin the
special education sooner.
The crib-o-gram is now being
manufactured by Telesensory Sys
tem Inc., the firm which also helped
design the microprocessor modoi,
and will be distributed to intensive
care nurseries throughout the coun
try at a cost of $4,700 each. However,
the costs of the tests should be min
imal, said Simmons, amounting to $5
each.

ing problems early, the device has
"helped to get the ball rolling"
sooner towards infant hearing re
habilitation, Simmons said.
The crib-o-gram, said Simmons, is
based on an old "rat psychology
test" which measures an infant's
emotions before, during and after a
number of 92-decibel sounds are
emitted at 40-minute intervals from a
speaker located near the infant.
If the baby responds to the loud
sound, his startled movements are
picked up by an extremely strain
sensitive transducer placed under
the infant's mattress.
Infants tested
Research on the crib-o-gram
began in 1967 with grants from the
National Institute of Neurological
Diseases and Stroke. Since 1970,
13,000 healthy and intensive care in
fants have been tested at the Stan
ford Hospital, said Simmons, and the
results indicate that one in every 1000
healthy babies have hearing losses,
while one in 52 seriously ill babies
suffer from varying degrees of deaf
ness.
In the original version of the
crib-o-gram, 36 sounds were emitted
over a 24-hour testing period and in
formation about the infants' move
ments was interpreted onto a strip
chart, which was then graded by
hand.
According to Dr. William McFar
land, director of the federally funded
project, the hospital is now moving
toward using a new model which in
cludes a microprocessor, a small
computer which can administer 32
testing sounds at different intervals
during a three- to four-hour period
and grade each response within
micro-seconds.
This constitutes "an even more ob
jective test, totally unaffected by any
human bias as to whether or not this
child may have a problem," McFar

land said.
"To pass the test the baby must
respond to at least ten percent of all
scoreable tests," said Kathy Orlando,
a research assistant who regularly
administers the tests. "The new mic
roprocessor will not sound if a child
is in too deep a slumber. If someone
rang your doorbell and you were
sound asleep, you probably
wouldn't hear it either. The perfect
testing period for a baby is between
light sleep and relative inactivity."
Further testing
If the infant does not pass the test
with the crib-o-gram, said McFar
land, he is called back for further
testing when six to eight months old
in a sound booth using visual re
sponse audiometry, "a form of oper
ant conditioning which teaches a
baby to search for an animated toy
after presentation of a sound," said
McFarland.
Language abilities
Time is one of the biggest factors,
according to Simmons. Children
usually develop their language
abilities between the ages of three to
four months and five years, but be
fore the crib-o-gram, deafness was
usually detected when children were
about two and a half years old—more
than halfway into one of the most
vital learning periods of life, said
Simmons.
Aftera problem is initially detected
using a crib-o-gram, however, it typi
cally takes about 22 months before a
child is fitted with a hearing aide, due
to parents' disbelief and insis
tence on getting a second or
third opinion, said Simmons.
"But not everyone's a hot-shot when
it comes to young children," he said.
"It's easy for an audiologist who isn't
really sure to say, 'Let's see what he's
like in another couple of months.'"
Crandmothers are actually the
most common people to suspect
hearing inadequacies in children
who are often very good at "faking
out" doctors. "If a new parent slams
a door without waking a baby, he or
she will probably only be gra f eful not
to have caused a lot of loud bawling,
but a grandmother who has been
around children before will start to
wonder," said Simmons.
Special ed sooner
Simmons, who said he is now "on
the war-path" about the typical 22-
month delays, said he hopes that the
crib-o-gram will lessen the time lag
between initial detection and hear

ing rehabilitation and thus begin the
special education sooner.
The crib-o-gram is now being
manufactured by Telesensory Sys
tem Inc., the firm which also helped
design the microprocessor modoi,
and will be distributed to intensive
care nurseries throughout the coun
try at a cost of $4,700 each. However,
the costs of the tests should be min
imal, said Simmons, amounting to $5
each.

baby at Stanford Hospital.
A University scientist, working
with a Palo Alto firm, has developed
a device which can detect an infant's
hearing loss in the first few weeks of
life.
According to Dr. Blair Simmons,
surgery professor and head of the
School of Medicine's division of
otolarynology (ear, nose and throat
studies), the "crib-o-gram" has
shown that deafness is 19 times more
likely in seriously ill babies than in
healthy babies.
