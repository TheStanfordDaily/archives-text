# Prospects good for summer jobs
## 
### Chris Mills 
If you haven't found a sum
mer job yet, don't panic.
Employers and students agree
that this is a good year for
summer employment oppor
tunities if you're not too par
ticular.
"At this point summer
employment looks excellent,"
said Jack Bray, manager of
Manpower Temporary Ser
vices in Palo Alto. "We are
looking for all kinds of
people."
Bray said there is a big de
mand on the mid-Peninsulafor
skilled office workers. He
added that there are also jobs
for unskilled assemblers, pac
kers and delivery van drivers.
"If you are just a reliable per
son," Bray said, "we can al
most guarantee an immediate

job."
Thomas Temporaries' Palo
Alto branch manager Suzanne
Buckley agreed.
"I think there will be lots of
jobs, especially for people with
service skills who can fill in for
people on vacation," she said.
"If you can type 40 words per
minute, we need you."
Buckley said summer jobs in
this area are paying $3 to $5.50
per hour for light industrial and
clerical work.
Personnel representative
Robin Holbrook of Timesavers
in Los Altos said many com
panies are willing to give on
the-job training to students
who have taken first-year
courses in computer prog
ramming or accounting.
"The labor market is so good
this year there really isn't a

summer job problem," echoed
an employee of the State
Employment Service in Palo
Alto.
Alean Clark, director of stu
dent employment at the Career
Planning anri Placement
Center (CPPC), was more re
strained in her enthusiasm.
"The jobs are there, but you
may not get exactly what you
want," Clark cautioned. She
said most are unskilled service
jobs such as vacation relief in
hospitals and businesses, re
staurant jobs and split shifts at
gas stations.
Jobs on campus are also av
ailable, but first priority goes to
students on financial aid.
Lynne Mason, assistant di
rector of financial aids for stu
dent employment, noted that
many campus jobs are listed in
mid or late June. That is when
employers learn which of their
workers will leave for the
summer. She said in July there
are usually more jobs available
on campus than there are stu
dents looking for them.
About 500 students on finan
cial aid will spend their sum
mers working on campus,
Mason estimated. Approxi
mately 50 of those will be on
federal work-study programs.
"I think a lot of students will
shy away from college work
study this summer because
they can make more outside,"
she said.
Most students seem to have
found summer jobs by now
without the help of profes
sional job-finders.
Of 30 students phoned at
random, 19 said they have jobs

lined up. Four were con
templating offers they have re
ceived, two will be attending
summer school full time and
two are graduating and going
into permanent positions.
Only three had no offers yet.
Mechanical engineering
senior Frederick Green said he
found a job making mechanical
devices for handicapped
people. He traced the route he
followed, talking first to an en
gineer at Children's Hospital.
He then attended a meeting of
organizations that work with
the handicapped, meeting a
company representative and
finally talked to the boss who
hired him.
"I was lucky," Green de
clared.
Freshman Ellen Ablow was
particularly enterprising. Dur
ing Christmas break she said
she looked for jobs near her
New Jersey home.
"I went to every restaurant
along the coast until I found a
job," she said.
Glenn Evitt, a junior in civil
engineering, found profes
sional employment services to
be useless. He said he looked
through all of the CPPC's list
ings and sent out more than 20
letters and resumes to
employers all over the country.
"I applied to everyone in my
field. From those the result was
very poor," Evitt said. "Most
didn't even say 'Boo!' They just
never responded."
Evitt said he eventually
found a job on his own, by
walking into an engineering
firm he knew of in San Fran
cisco and asking for work.

courses in computer prog
ramming or accounting.
"The labor market is so good
this year there really isn't a

summer job problem," echoed
an employee of the State
Employment Service in Palo
Alto.
Alean Clark, director of stu
dent employment at the Career
Planning anri Placement
Center (CPPC), was more re
strained in her enthusiasm.
"The jobs are there, but you
may not get exactly what you
want," Clark cautioned. She
said most are unskilled service
jobs such as vacation relief in
hospitals and businesses, re
staurant jobs and split shifts at
gas stations.
Jobs on campus are also av
ailable, but first priority goes to
students on financial aid.
Lynne Mason, assistant di
rector of financial aids for stu
dent employment, noted that
many campus jobs are listed in
mid or late June. That is when
employers learn which of their
workers will leave for the
summer. She said in July there
are usually more jobs available
on campus than there are stu
dents looking for them.
About 500 students on finan
cial aid will spend their sum
mers working on campus,
Mason estimated. Approxi
mately 50 of those will be on
federal work-study programs.
"I think a lot of students will
shy away from college work
study this summer because
they can make more outside,"
she said.
Most students seem to have
found summer jobs by now
without the help of profes
sional job-finders.
Of 30 students phoned at
random, 19 said they have jobs

lined up. Four were con
templating offers they have re
ceived, two will be attending
summer school full time and
two are graduating and going
into permanent positions.
Only three had no offers yet.
Mechanical engineering
senior Frederick Green said he
found a job making mechanical
devices for handicapped
people. He traced the route he
followed, talking first to an en
gineer at Children's Hospital.
He then attended a meeting of
organizations that work with
the handicapped, meeting a
company representative and
finally talked to the boss who
hired him.
"I was lucky," Green de
clared.
Freshman Ellen Ablow was
particularly enterprising. Dur
ing Christmas break she said
she looked for jobs near her
New Jersey home.
"I went to every restaurant
along the coast until I found a
job," she said.
Glenn Evitt, a junior in civil
engineering, found profes
sional employment services to
be useless. He said he looked
through all of the CPPC's list
ings and sent out more than 20
letters and resumes to
employers all over the country.
"I applied to everyone in my
field. From those the result was
very poor," Evitt said. "Most
didn't even say 'Boo!' They just
never responded."
Evitt said he eventually
found a job on his own, by
walking into an engineering
firm he knew of in San Fran
cisco and asking for work.
If you haven't found a sum
mer job yet, don't panic.
Employers and students agree
that this is a good year for
summer employment oppor
tunities if you're not too par
ticular.
"At this point summer
employment looks excellent,"
said Jack Bray, manager of
Manpower Temporary Ser
vices in Palo Alto. "We are
looking for all kinds of
people."
Bray said there is a big de
mand on the mid-Peninsulafor
skilled office workers. He
added that there are also jobs
for unskilled assemblers, pac
kers and delivery van drivers.
"If you are just a reliable per
son," Bray said, "we can al
most guarantee an immediate

job."
Thomas Temporaries' Palo
Alto branch manager Suzanne
Buckley agreed.
"I think there will be lots of
jobs, especially for people with
service skills who can fill in for
people on vacation," she said.
"If you can type 40 words per
minute, we need you."
Buckley said summer jobs in
this area are paying $3 to $5.50
per hour for light industrial and
clerical work.
Personnel representative
Robin Holbrook of Timesavers
in Los Altos said many com
panies are willing to give on
the-job training to students
who have taken first-year
courses in computer prog
ramming or accounting.
"The labor market is so good
