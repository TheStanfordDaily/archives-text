# Conceived by Jane Stanford
## Art Museum more than Leland's collection 
### Ellie Williams 
Contrary to popular legend,
the last meal of Leland Stanford
)r. is not reverently pre
served and displayed in the
Stanford Art Museum. In fact,
Stanford memorabilia has
been confined to only one of
the museum's 14 galleries, and
little Leland's collection must
now compete for attention
with such masterpieces as Au
guste Rodin sculpture and
Edgar Degas paintings.
"Mrs. Stanford's museum"
was her idea and her project.
While she originally conceived
of it as a repository for Leland
Ir.'s European collection, she
later intended it to include ad
ditional art work and to serve
as an oasis in an otherwise cul
turally barren Bay Area.
In honor of her son, Jane
Stanford chose a majestic
Athenian design for the
Museum, strikingly different
architecture from her hus
band's low, mission-like cent
ral quad. While traveling in
Greece, Leland had visited the
neo-classical National

Museum of Athens and de
clared that he would like to
build a replica to house his
own treasures which he had
been collecting during his
European tours and displaying
in their Nob Hill home.
After his death, his dream
came true quickly, for Mrs.
Stanford insisted that the
Museum be ready for the Uni
versity's opening in 1891. Built
in one year, of reinforced con
crete (a relatively new building
medium at that time), the Stan
ford Museum was the largest
free-standing concrete struc
ture west of the Mississippi,
and, according to some, in the
world.
The Museum was originally
much larger. Today's structure
is only one-fifth of Mrs. Stan
ford's original giant quad
rangle, much of which was de
stroyed during the 1906 ear
thquake.
Mrs, Stanford's ingenuity
permeates the entire building.
Constant humidity is main
tained throughout, while
skylights face the rising and

setting sun. Iron doors make
the museum so safe that, ac
cording to Museum guard Liz
Schwell, "anyone who breaks
in here deserves it."
Museum officials have good
naturedly preserved that
peculiar Stanford trait, self
aggrandizement. Here little Le
land's childhood arithmetic
books and scribbled drawings
mingle unbashtully with his
valuable European artifacts.

ford clan playing cricket and
idly chatting in Eden-like sur
roundings, battles for domin
ion of the room with "Mrs.
Stanford's Jewelry Collection,"
a large unsightly painted dis
play of those jewels she sac
rificed to pay for the Library
Book Fund.
Though a bit pretentious,
Mrs. Stanford was neverthe
less very generous in her devo
tion to the Museum as an edu
cational institution. It was orig
inally not included in the Uni
versity budget, so she used her
personal income to support

the Museum. She expanded it
through such purchases as the
Ikada Collection of jade and
porcelain and the Cesnola Col
lection of Cypriot Pottery. She
also commissioned artists to
create bronzeduplicates ot the
Tabla Rosa and famous classi
cal sculpture.
Mrs. Stanford's demise also
brought an end to enthusiasm
for the Museum. For4o years it
suffered trom neglect and was
closed from 1945 to 1954.
"Twenty years ago this used to
be the big make-out place on
campus," chuckled Schwell.
The Committee tor Art and
Prof. Lorenz Eitner, now
chairman of the Art Dept., have
been integral forces in re
vitalizing the museum and ex
panding its collections.
The Rodin collection is one
result of this reorganization
and rejuvenation. This gather
ing of sculpture includes such
famous works as "The kiss"
and figures for the "Gates of
Hell."
Other less famous exhibits

include the 19th century paint
ing of northern California,
"Marin County Sunset" and
painted mummy faces. Other
rooms hold collections of In
dian, African and modern art
and Chinese scrolls.
While browsing in the sec
ond story gallery of principally
19th and 18th century Euro
pean art, one discovers such
masters as Pablo Picasso,
Degas and Toulouse Lautrec.
While attempting to mingle
amongst these paintings and
lithographs, Leland Stanford
Ir.'s portrait stands out —
large, bold and imposing.
Dressed in a blue suit and
posed against a red
background, the life-size fi
gure of Stanford looks out at
passersby.
"Out of life comes life,"
Rodin wrote, yet ironically, Le
land s death as well as his life
inspired the Stanford
Museum, which is overcoming
its growing pains and fulfilling
lane Stanford's dream.


A wide variety of exhibits abound in the 14 galleries of the Stanford
Art Museum. In addition to I eland |r.'s c ollection, there are paintings

The Rodin collection in the Stanford Museum is one of the few
collections outside the Rodin Museum in Paris. It includes such works
as "The Kiss" and figures for the "Gates of Hell."

the Romanesque mission style of the rest of the University.
