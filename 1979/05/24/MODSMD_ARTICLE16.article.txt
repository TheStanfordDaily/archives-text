# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## John Leach People treated as units 
### 
Just a few weeks ago I was present at a seminar
here at which the recent findings of a national
committee empowered to look into the risks of
generating electricity by nuclear fission were
discussed. The committee approached the
problem by estimating the ambient background
radiation level which would persist without
mankind and then calculating the quantities of
radiation that nuclear power plants can be ex
pected to issue into the air.
The seminar left undiscussed the committee's
basic assumption that nuclear power is both
necessary and desirable and that progress de
mands nuclear power. Following from this, the

What we need is for people to
stop acting like the units that
corporations feed into
computers.

duty of the committee should be to estimate not
the risks but the cost of having nuclear power
and whether or not we can afford this cost.
The cost is, of course, more a question of who
has to adapt the most and by how much. Can the
giants of industry provide us with what we sup
posedly need and enter the field of nuclear
energy production as they would with any other
exploitable commodity? Can they expect man
kind to adapt to counter the side effects that
they would unleash?
The scientist's love for the number unity
shines through the committee's calculations.
They summed a series where each term was the
product of the probability or risk of an accident
occurring and the likely damage to be caused by
the occasion of that event.
"But," cries a weak voice inside me, "do we
want nuclear power, do we need nuclear
power? Who pays the price and who is doing the
calculating?" A strong voice booms back, "Of
course we need nuclear power, just look at the
queues at the gas stations."
But the gas shortage is a corporate contri
vance; they aren't going to sell us gas now when

they can sell it to us in a couple of months' time
for twice the price. By then we will be so glad to
have gas again that we will thank them for it and
pay them handsomely. Those gas queues are
there because of our greed, it's our weakness
that is being exploited by the gas companies.
And can we blame them, or should we blame
ourselves? Do we want this gas or have we
drowned in the flood of advertisements which
tell us how important this gas is to us, how it is a
measureof ourvalueas units in today's society?
We appear as units in society to corporations
and committees; we are units to be placed on
one side of an equation, a normalizing factor so
that their results come out near to unity and not
200 million. The count of cancers caused by nuc
lear power generation reflects the inflexibility of
some of those units to adapt to the change in the
atmosphere. The corporations make the change
and the units respond but some of them don't
respond too well and they develop cancers and
die prematurely.
It seems that a few can die so that all the others
will have more energy, so that the others can
climb further up the scale. Their altitude is a
measure of their standard of living, a standard of
living which is measured in dollars.
What we need isn't more ways of earning and
spending dollars, more ways of polluting the air
or of wasting our resources, one of which is life.
What we need is for people to stop acting like
the units that corporations like to feed into
computers, to question the steady metamor
phosis that we have undergone, and to start
asking for whose benefit this progress is
claimed.
The giant companies aren't giving me free
dom, they are stealing it from me by forcing me
to add unnecessary constraints to my life, by
forcing me to continually change direction to
avoid the hazards they place before me. They
aren't increasing my standard of living, they are
just increasing the number of dollars circulated
per capita.
It is our responsibility to ensure that our
hopes and ability to work toward something of
personal importance are not squashed by the
less-than-personal machinery constructed
around us, the most modern face of which is the
present emphasis on nuclear power.
