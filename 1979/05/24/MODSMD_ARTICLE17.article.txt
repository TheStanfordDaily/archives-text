Furlong corrected
Gary Furlong's opinion
piece, "Combat Reverse
Sexism" (Daily, May 22), elicits
a much more detailed criticism
than perhaps any article or let
ter in the Daily could attempt
to cover. For the readers' be
nefit, however, his factual mis
takes must be corrected.
Concerning Gil Morales' |an.
15 cartoon, the March issue of
Aurora did not advocate any
"dangerous abridgment of
press freedom." On the con
trary, one opinion piece stated
that the problem with this strip
was simply that it was not
funny, and added "this one
mistake, however, doesn't
warrant removal of 'Dupie,' or
attack of Morales' other car
toons."
In the other article concern
ing "Dupie," Adrienne Torf
and Lisa Atlas called for more
responsible journalism and
suggested that "the Daily print
(Morales') strip on the Opin
ions page of each issue" so that
its editors acknowledge "that
'Dupie' reflects the opinions of
its creator, and not that it is a
successful attempt at satirizing
the present state of society."
No one wanted to use, as Fur
long suggested, "the highest
censorsFiip law in the coun

try."
On the subject of an all-male
escort service run by a man,
Furlong again misread Aurora.
His comment, "they objected
to him simply because he was a
man. And that's all" is incor
rect. That is not the point at all.
Vicki Campbell and Sally
Edwards clarify their opinion:
"An all-male escort system, by
both accepting and perpetuat
ing the role of men as protec
tors, and women as powerless
and inherently incapable of
taking care of themselves and
each other, allows neither
women nor men to break out
of destructive sex roles."
Furlong labels the sugges
tion that "either a two-women
or a woman-man escort duo
would be as safe and effective
as a male escort, with the
added benefit of protecting
women against escort impost
ors" as "criminal sexism" and
"hypocrisy."
As a final touch, Furlong calls
for feminists to start practicing
what we preach. Can that type
of criticism possibly be taken
seriously when given by a
communication major who so
shallowly and sensationalisti
cally misread a newspaper?

Transcripts useful
John Harris' and Brock
Fisher's recent letter to the
Daily questioned why the Of
fice of Residential Education
asks for transcripts of applic
ants for RA positions.
Resident Fellows have re
quested applicants' transcripts
primarily for two reasons: to
see the range of the person's
academic interest and experi
ence and to note patterns of
incompletes, dropped courses
or other indications of the per
son's inability to remain in
good academic standing. A few
Fellows are interested in
applicants' grades but most
use the transcripts for the two
reasons stated above.
Transcripts are filed sepa
rately from applicants' folders
and may be reviewed only by
Resident Fellows and Direc
tors; no student staff members
have access to applicants'
transcripts.

I'd like to inform the com
munity of a solution to a gener
ally perceived problem. As
everyone knows, Tresidder
Union isn't doing its job. The
Union isn't the center of cam
pus that it ought to be. Meyer
Library comes a lot closer to
filling that role, at least for on
campus undergraduates like
myself. I don't know where
graduate students and off
campus residents go when
they want to meet someone in
a clean, attractive place.
These problems are not a
function of insensitive, uncar
ing management. They've
been working hard to solve the
problems. But they can only do
so much. They need input and
effort from the community at
large. Other than suggestions
directly addressed to them, the
channel for input has tradi
tionally been members of the
Tresidder Program Board.

This will continue to be true
next year. The Board is looking
for energetic people with a vis
ion of what life here could be,
to serve on this vital group for
next year.
The Program Board's func
tion is an exciting one. There is
every reason for the Union to
be the center of student life
here, and dynamic programs
will play an important role in
creating that center. It just
takes daring, creative people
to work in the structure that's
already there.
Dream a little — Sunday
brunch on the front patio (who
needs the Holiday Inn?), the
Mendicants are singing softly,
the food is good and afforda
ble, and everyone's having a
good time.
How about an up-and
coming jazz trumpeter, playing
to a packed crowd, in the up
stairs lounge? The concert
ends and the crowd heads
down to the newly opened

pub, just off the Transition din
ing room to shoot the breeze
and talk about what they've
just heard.
Such things are possible.
And there are many others, at
least as exciting, that someone
out there in the "Stanford
community" must have in
mind. If you're one of them,
check out the Program Board.

I'd like to inform the com
munity of a solution to a gener
ally perceived problem. As
everyone knows, Tresidder
Union isn't doing its job. The
Union isn't the center of cam
pus that it ought to be. Meyer
Library comes a lot closer to
filling that role, at least for on
campus undergraduates like
myself. I don't know where
graduate students and off
campus residents go when
they want to meet someone in
a clean, attractive place.
These problems are not a
function of insensitive, uncar
ing management. They've
been working hard to solve the
problems. But they can only do
so much. They need input and
effort from the community at
large. Other than suggestions
directly addressed to them, the
channel for input has tradi
tionally been members of the
Tresidder Program Board.

This will continue to be true
next year. The Board is looking
for energetic people with a vis
ion of what life here could be,
to serve on this vital group for
next year.
The Program Board's func
tion is an exciting one. There is
every reason for the Union to
be the center of student life
here, and dynamic programs
will play an important role in
creating that center. It just
takes daring, creative people
to work in the structure that's
already there.
Dream a little — Sunday
brunch on the front patio (who
needs the Holiday Inn?), the
Mendicants are singing softly,
the food is good and afforda
ble, and everyone's having a
good time.
How about an up-and
coming jazz trumpeter, playing
to a packed crowd, in the up
stairs lounge? The concert
ends and the crowd heads
down to the newly opened

pub, just off the Transition din
ing room to shoot the breeze
and talk about what they've
just heard.
Such things are possible.
And there are many others, at
least as exciting, that someone
out there in the "Stanford
community" must have in
mind. If you're one of them,
check out the Program Board.

Critique lacking
While writing my most re
cent column (Daily, May 14), I
worried that it was not suffi
ciently controversial to gener
ate any intelligent criticism.
Roger Samelson's attempted
critique of that column (Daily,
May 21) proves that I was right.

Furlong corrected
Gary Furlong's opinion
piece, "Combat Reverse
Sexism" (Daily, May 22), elicits
a much more detailed criticism
than perhaps any article or let
ter in the Daily could attempt
to cover. For the readers' be
nefit, however, his factual mis
takes must be corrected.
Concerning Gil Morales' |an.
15 cartoon, the March issue of
Aurora did not advocate any
"dangerous abridgment of
press freedom." On the con
trary, one opinion piece stated
that the problem with this strip
was simply that it was not
funny, and added "this one
mistake, however, doesn't
warrant removal of 'Dupie,' or
attack of Morales' other car
toons."
In the other article concern
ing "Dupie," Adrienne Torf
and Lisa Atlas called for more
responsible journalism and
suggested that "the Daily print
(Morales') strip on the Opin
ions page of each issue" so that
its editors acknowledge "that
'Dupie' reflects the opinions of
its creator, and not that it is a
successful attempt at satirizing
the present state of society."
No one wanted to use, as Fur
long suggested, "the highest
censorsFiip law in the coun

try."
On the subject of an all-male
escort service run by a man,
Furlong again misread Aurora.
His comment, "they objected
to him simply because he was a
man. And that's all" is incor
rect. That is not the point at all.
Vicki Campbell and Sally
Edwards clarify their opinion:
"An all-male escort system, by
both accepting and perpetuat
ing the role of men as protec
tors, and women as powerless
and inherently incapable of
taking care of themselves and
each other, allows neither
women nor men to break out
of destructive sex roles."
Furlong labels the sugges
tion that "either a two-women
or a woman-man escort duo
would be as safe and effective
as a male escort, with the
added benefit of protecting
women against escort impost
ors" as "criminal sexism" and
"hypocrisy."
As a final touch, Furlong calls
for feminists to start practicing
what we preach. Can that type
of criticism possibly be taken
seriously when given by a
communication major who so
shallowly and sensationalisti
cally misread a newspaper?
