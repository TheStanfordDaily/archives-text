# Dorm mail delivery considered

Students will no longer have to rent post office
boxes if plans for a new mail delivery system proves
feasible. The administration and the ASSU Consumer
Affairs Task Force are working on a system whereby
mail would be delivered to all residences.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of student affairs,
is advising students to rent their post office boxes for
only six months at a time. The plan, if adopted, will
probably go into effect sometime between Sep
tember and lanuary.
The task force has been working on the mail deliv
ery problem, along with several other consumer is
sues, for the past two quarters. According to task
force member Sandy Reback, "There's currently an
unfair financial burden and inconvenience to stu
dents who live in certain places. The new system
would remedy this."
"Mail delivery to the dorms is long overdue. For
many years students have expressed dissatisfaction
with the mail delivery on campus," task force
member Ann Ezra said.
Ed Scoles, director of housing management, and
Robinson are submitting a proposal describing the
desired change to the local branch of the U.S. Postal
Service. It will then be forwarded to the sectional
office in San Francisco which must approve major
changes in mail delivery.

"(Stanford boxes) are not unprofitable, but we
have no objection to bulk delivery if qualifications are
met," a Palo Alto postal official said.
The proposed plan for residences not currently
receiving mail service is to install locked metal boxes
near each administrative office. The boxes would be
identified by house and room number. Postal carriers
would deliver mail in bulk and the University would
hire persons to sort and distribute mail Monday
through Saturday, according to Robinson.
Forwarding of mail from residences would be
handled by the University because the Postal Service
will not forward mail delivered in bulk, Reback said.
Post Office boxes would still be available for stu
dents who desire them, Robinson added.
Scoles said a University planner is being assigned
to examine the residences to determine the feasibility
and costs of a new system.
UC-Berkeley uses a similar system. Figures indicate
that the cost of operating the new system here, which
would be included in student board costs, would be
approximately one-fourth of what students pay in
rent for post office boxes, Reback said.
A 1972 postal regulation prohibits postal carriers
from servicing individual boxes in dorms. Residences
such as Stern Hall receive individual delivery because
the Postal Service decided not to discontinue that
service which existed before the regulation, accord
ing to postal officials.
