## Utility argument can't justify abortion 
### 
Ginny Puddefoot makes
many poignant observations
regarding the desirability of
the use of abortion in several
unfortunate situations in her
careful article (Daily, May 8).
She asks us to consider the
mother's life, referring, for
example, to a woman struggl
ing to raise five children on
welfare who suddenly finds
herself pregnant, or to a young
teenager who finds herself
pregnant and chooses to "let
herself grow up before
mothering another."
These and other cases,
coupled with Puddetoot's dis
cussion of the significant num
bers of deaths induced by
"botched back-alley or self
induced abortions" taken by
women in desperation, pre
sent a seemingly forceful ar
gument in favor of abortion.

Puddefoot places careful
emphasis on the fact that abor
tion will occur whether it is
legal or not, so it is vastly pref
erable to make it "safe and
legal." She uses the unfortu
nate cases mentioned above to
show that abortion has overrid
ing utility to the women in
these unfortunate situations, a
fact which is indisputable. Her
arguments, then, often de
scribed as "making the best of
a bad situation," are utilitarian.
Utilitarianism, though at first
glance a compelling basis for
justifying abortion, deserves
closer examination. Two major
problems are associated with
this utilitarian view of abortion.
The first is that the same
reasoning, if applied to other
situations, leads to dubious
conclusions.
Consider, for example, a

mother who has just given
birth to a "fetal monster," or
severely genetically deformed
infant. Suppose the parents
decide that they do not wish
the tremendous emotional and
financial burden of raising this
child, yet no state or private in
stitution is willing to take re
sponsibility for the infant.
Would the parents then be
justified in ending the infant's
life on utilitarian grounds,
using exactly the same basis
that they would have used to
justify an abortion if the pre
gnancy had been unwanted in
the first place? To borrow Pud
defoot's words, we can ask:
"are we to punish them (the
parents in this case) for failures
they're not responsible for?"
Or consider the woman with
five children on welfare. Sup
pose one child has a severe ac
cident which induces brain
damage, leaving her a "living
vegetable." Further assume
that this child, due to her terri
ble condition, comes to im
pose a tremendous burden on
the already badly saddled
mother. This results in a
mother unable to love the child
as she did before, even coming
to resent it.
Would the mother then be
justified in ending the child's
life on utilitarian grounds?
Would such an action be jus
tified by claiming that it would
"work for mothers that are
happy, willing mothers, chil
dren that are wanted chil
dren."
In neither case would we be
justified in ending the life of
the person in question, even
on utilitarian grounds, for to
do so would violate that per
son's right to life, the most
fundamental right a human
possesses. If utilitarian reason
ing cannot justify taking life in
the cases cited, then we are led
to the conclusion that such
reasoning cannot justify abor

tion either, for the utilitarian
arguments are no different in
either case.
The second major problem
with utilitarian reasoning
applied to abortion is that such
reasoning avoids the true con
flict of rights that is involved in
the abortion question.
Utilitarianism focuses its ar
guments on the mother alone,
basing its conclusions on
reasoning focused entirely on
her rights and her situation.
To focus entirely on the
mother is to miss the central
issue of abortion. That issue is
a conflict between the fetus'
right to life and the mother's
right to control her own body.
It is this conflict of rights which
must be adjudicated in settling
the issue of whether abortion
is justified or not.
Utilitarianism ignores the
rights of the fetus, and thus
cannot lead to a valid justifica
tion for abortion. If a valid jus
tification for abortion is to be
found, it must be found out
side the system of
utilitarianism, and within a sys
tem that recognizes this con
flict of rights.
For if we are not duty-bound
to consider the rights of the
person whose life we are con
sidering ending, then we are
free to end the life of the "fetal
monster," the "living vegeta
ble," the fetus, the elderly, the
mentally ill, and so on. Clearly
such reasoning is fallacious.
I agree with Puddefoot that
all humans (not just "pro
lifers") should "be more con
cerned with improving
people's lives," and should
"promote the ideals of wanted,
happy children and responsi
bility in sex and motherhood."
However, I do not believe that
such ideals could in general
ever be promoted through the
taking of another's life.

this utilitarian view of abortion.
The first is that the same
reasoning, if applied to other
situations, leads to dubious
conclusions.
Consider, for example, a

mother who has just given
birth to a "fetal monster," or
severely genetically deformed
infant. Suppose the parents
decide that they do not wish
the tremendous emotional and
financial burden of raising this
child, yet no state or private in
stitution is willing to take re
sponsibility for the infant.
Would the parents then be
justified in ending the infant's
life on utilitarian grounds,
using exactly the same basis
that they would have used to
justify an abortion if the pre
gnancy had been unwanted in
the first place? To borrow Pud
defoot's words, we can ask:
"are we to punish them (the
parents in this case) for failures
they're not responsible for?"
Or consider the woman with
five children on welfare. Sup
pose one child has a severe ac
cident which induces brain
damage, leaving her a "living
vegetable." Further assume
that this child, due to her terri
ble condition, comes to im
pose a tremendous burden on
the already badly saddled
mother. This results in a
mother unable to love the child
as she did before, even coming
to resent it.
Would the mother then be
justified in ending the child's
life on utilitarian grounds?
Would such an action be jus
tified by claiming that it would
"work for mothers that are
happy, willing mothers, chil
dren that are wanted chil
dren."
In neither case would we be
justified in ending the life of
the person in question, even
on utilitarian grounds, for to
do so would violate that per
son's right to life, the most
fundamental right a human
possesses. If utilitarian reason
ing cannot justify taking life in
the cases cited, then we are led
to the conclusion that such
reasoning cannot justify abor

tion either, for the utilitarian
arguments are no different in
either case.
The second major problem
with utilitarian reasoning
applied to abortion is that such
reasoning avoids the true con
flict of rights that is involved in
the abortion question.
Utilitarianism focuses its ar
guments on the mother alone,
basing its conclusions on
reasoning focused entirely on
her rights and her situation.
To focus entirely on the
mother is to miss the central
issue of abortion. That issue is
a conflict between the fetus'
right to life and the mother's
right to control her own body.
It is this conflict of rights which
must be adjudicated in settling
the issue of whether abortion
is justified or not.
Utilitarianism ignores the
rights of the fetus, and thus
cannot lead to a valid justifica
tion for abortion. If a valid jus
tification for abortion is to be
found, it must be found out
side the system of
utilitarianism, and within a sys
tem that recognizes this con
flict of rights.
For if we are not duty-bound
to consider the rights of the
person whose life we are con
sidering ending, then we are
free to end the life of the "fetal
monster," the "living vegeta
ble," the fetus, the elderly, the
mentally ill, and so on. Clearly
such reasoning is fallacious.
I agree with Puddefoot that
all humans (not just "pro
lifers") should "be more con
cerned with improving
people's lives," and should
"promote the ideals of wanted,
happy children and responsi
bility in sex and motherhood."
However, I do not believe that
such ideals could in general
ever be promoted through the
taking of another's life.

Ginny Puddefoot makes
many poignant observations
regarding the desirability of
the use of abortion in several
unfortunate situations in her
careful article (Daily, May 8).
She asks us to consider the
mother's life, referring, for
example, to a woman struggl
ing to raise five children on
welfare who suddenly finds
herself pregnant, or to a young
teenager who finds herself
pregnant and chooses to "let
herself grow up before
mothering another."
These and other cases,
coupled with Puddetoot's dis
cussion of the significant num
bers of deaths induced by
"botched back-alley or self
induced abortions" taken by
women in desperation, pre
sent a seemingly forceful ar
gument in favor of abortion.

Puddefoot places careful
emphasis on the fact that abor
tion will occur whether it is
legal or not, so it is vastly pref
erable to make it "safe and
legal." She uses the unfortu
nate cases mentioned above to
show that abortion has overrid
ing utility to the women in
these unfortunate situations, a
fact which is indisputable. Her
arguments, then, often de
scribed as "making the best of
a bad situation," are utilitarian.

glance a compelling basis for
justifying abortion, deserves
