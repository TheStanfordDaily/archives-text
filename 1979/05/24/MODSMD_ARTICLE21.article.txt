## Palestinians already have homeland 
### 
Once again, Sami Suleiman has
employed Hitler's "big lie" technique to
turn history around to achieve his goal
(Daily, May 10). Let us examine his claims,
versus the truth, concerning the so-called
Palestinians.
Suleiman claims that "Today, almost
every Palestinian in the world is either in
exile, under military occupation, or a resi
dent of Israel. . . . Collectively, the 3.5
million Palestinians have been stripped of
their nationhood."
But the so-called Palestinian Arabs al
ready possess a homeland, which com
prises more than four-fifths of historic
Palestine. It is called Jordan, and was artifi
cially severed from the whole of Palestine
in 1922, and made into a Palestinian state.
Only one-fifth of Palestine was thus left
open to settlement by the Palestinian
Jews.
The so-called Palestinian Arabs drove
out all the lews in their land, Jordan, con
fiscated all their property and never com
pensated the Palestinian lews or gave
them the right of return. The majority of
the citizens of Jordan are Palestinian
Arabs, and all Palestinian Arabs anywhere
in the world can have all the rights and
privileges of citizenship in their own land.
Suleiman claims that "The United Na
tions recognized the Palestinians' right of
return to their homeland. Resolution 194
states: . . refugees wishing to return to
their homes and live at peace with their
neighbors should be permitted to do
so. . . But he maintains that "Israel has
ignored its duty to carry out UN obliga
tions and charters with respect to the right
of Palestinians to return to their home
land."
The key phrase in this issue is that the
returning refugees "wishing to live at
peace with their neighbors should be

permitted to do so." Thus far, no Palesti
nian Arabs have professed the desire to
live at peace with their Israeli neighbors.
They have only professed the desire to
annihilate their Israeli neighbors.
And what is totally ignored in this whole
episode is the rights of the more than
900,000 )ewish refugees who were cruelly
driven from their homes in Arab lands. All
of their homes and property were stolen
from them, and they were totally deprived
of all human rights as they were forced to
flee for their lives to sanctuary in Israel.
The plight of these lewish refugees, and
their rights, are never mentioned by the
Arabs, most conveniently.
Suleiman claims that "If the Palestinians
choose the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion as their sole and legitimate spokes
man, as is their right, then Israel should
have to negotiate with this legitimate rep
resentative of the Palestinian people."
There is no reason on Cod's earth why
Israel should have to deal with an organi
zation whose sole purpose in existing is to
destroy Israel! The PLO is not even a
Palestinian-Arab product. It was created in
1964 by Egyptian Pres. Gamal Abdul Nassar
for use against Israel in Israel's pre-1967
borders, when both ]udea and Samaria
(West Bank) and Gaza were under Arab
control.
The PLO was to have a military arm, the
Palestine Liberation Army, to be com
posed of units from each Arab country.
While ostensibly a Palestinian institution,
most of the membership and leadership of
the terrorist groups that comprise the PLO
are recruited throughout the Arab world
and are no more "Palestinian" than the
terrorist chiefs who harassed Palestine in
the years of the 1936 upheavals.
The PLO is the vanguard of Moslem mili
tancy, whose aims are consistent with his

tory. Historically, it was the Moslem Arabs
who condemned the Christians and the
Jews — "the People of the Book" — to be
treated forever as inferiors, in a state of
eternal degradation, as prescribed in their
holy Koran. The tragic fate of Lebanon's
Christians gives mute testimony to that in
junction.
Tosum up, the greatest hoax in history is
being perpetrated, the hoax of the "dis
possessed Palestinian nation." In 1948,
Jordan illegally conquered, occupied and
annexed Judea, Samaria and East
Jerusalem, while Egypt illegally conquered
and occupied the Gaza Strip. This illegal
occupation lasted 20 years, from 1947 to
1967, when Israel, wantonly attacked by
the Arab world, won them back.
During the entire 20-year period of il
legal Arab sovereignty over these ter
ritories, never was the idea of a Palestinian
state mentioned by either the host states,
Jordan and Egypt, by the other Arab states,
or by the so-called Palestinian Arabs them
selves. If there were any truth or validity to
their aspirations for a second Palestinian
nation, or if there was any honesty in the
Arab states' current maudlin concern over
the "Palestinian plight," and Israel's al
leged guilt in refusing to commit national
suicide in the name of justice for the Pales
tinians, the Arab world had 20 years in
which to create their all-embracing answer
to the conflict between Israel and the
Arabs.
The hypocrisy of their position today is
an insult to intelligence. The goal of the
Arabs was, and continues to be, the de
struction of the Jewish state. The issue of
the Palestinian Arabs is merely the
strongest weapon they have yet devised to
attain that goal!

Once again, Sami Suleiman has
employed Hitler's "big lie" technique to
turn history around to achieve his goal
(Daily, May 10). Let us examine his claims,
versus the truth, concerning the so-called
Palestinians.
Suleiman claims that "Today, almost
every Palestinian in the world is either in
exile, under military occupation, or a resi
dent of Israel. . . . Collectively, the 3.5
million Palestinians have been stripped of
their nationhood."
But the so-called Palestinian Arabs al
ready possess a homeland, which com
prises more than four-fifths of historic
Palestine. It is called Jordan, and was artifi
cially severed from the whole of Palestine
in 1922, and made into a Palestinian state.
Only one-fifth of Palestine was thus left
open to settlement by the Palestinian
Jews.
The so-called Palestinian Arabs drove
out all the lews in their land, Jordan, con
fiscated all their property and never com
pensated the Palestinian lews or gave
them the right of return. The majority of
the citizens of Jordan are Palestinian
Arabs, and all Palestinian Arabs anywhere
in the world can have all the rights and
privileges of citizenship in their own land.
Suleiman claims that "The United Na
tions recognized the Palestinians' right of
return to their homeland. Resolution 194
states: . . refugees wishing to return to
their homes and live at peace with their
neighbors should be permitted to do
so. . . But he maintains that "Israel has
ignored its duty to carry out UN obliga
tions and charters with respect to the right
of Palestinians to return to their home
land."
The key phrase in this issue is that the
returning refugees "wishing to live at
peace with their neighbors should be

permitted to do so." Thus far, no Palesti
nian Arabs have professed the desire to
live at peace with their Israeli neighbors.
They have only professed the desire to
annihilate their Israeli neighbors.
And what is totally ignored in this whole
episode is the rights of the more than
900,000 )ewish refugees who were cruelly
driven from their homes in Arab lands. All
of their homes and property were stolen
from them, and they were totally deprived
of all human rights as they were forced to
flee for their lives to sanctuary in Israel.
The plight of these lewish refugees, and
their rights, are never mentioned by the
Arabs, most conveniently.
Suleiman claims that "If the Palestinians
choose the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion as their sole and legitimate spokes
man, as is their right, then Israel should
have to negotiate with this legitimate rep
resentative of the Palestinian people."
There is no reason on Cod's earth why
Israel should have to deal with an organi
zation whose sole purpose in existing is to
destroy Israel! The PLO is not even a
Palestinian-Arab product. It was created in
1964 by Egyptian Pres. Gamal Abdul Nassar
for use against Israel in Israel's pre-1967
borders, when both ]udea and Samaria
(West Bank) and Gaza were under Arab
control.
The PLO was to have a military arm, the
Palestine Liberation Army, to be com
posed of units from each Arab country.
While ostensibly a Palestinian institution,
most of the membership and leadership of
the terrorist groups that comprise the PLO
are recruited throughout the Arab world
and are no more "Palestinian" than the
terrorist chiefs who harassed Palestine in
the years of the 1936 upheavals.
The PLO is the vanguard of Moslem mili
tancy, whose aims are consistent with his

tory. Historically, it was the Moslem Arabs
who condemned the Christians and the
Jews — "the People of the Book" — to be
treated forever as inferiors, in a state of
eternal degradation, as prescribed in their
holy Koran. The tragic fate of Lebanon's
Christians gives mute testimony to that in
junction.
Tosum up, the greatest hoax in history is
being perpetrated, the hoax of the "dis
possessed Palestinian nation." In 1948,
Jordan illegally conquered, occupied and
annexed Judea, Samaria and East
Jerusalem, while Egypt illegally conquered
and occupied the Gaza Strip. This illegal
occupation lasted 20 years, from 1947 to
1967, when Israel, wantonly attacked by
the Arab world, won them back.
During the entire 20-year period of il
legal Arab sovereignty over these ter
ritories, never was the idea of a Palestinian
state mentioned by either the host states,
Jordan and Egypt, by the other Arab states,
or by the so-called Palestinian Arabs them
selves. If there were any truth or validity to
their aspirations for a second Palestinian
nation, or if there was any honesty in the
Arab states' current maudlin concern over
the "Palestinian plight," and Israel's al
leged guilt in refusing to commit national
suicide in the name of justice for the Pales
tinians, the Arab world had 20 years in
which to create their all-embracing answer
to the conflict between Israel and the
Arabs.
The hypocrisy of their position today is
an insult to intelligence. The goal of the
Arabs was, and continues to be, the de
struction of the Jewish state. The issue of
the Palestinian Arabs is merely the
strongest weapon they have yet devised to
attain that goal!
