## Redeeming the bug-eyed monster 
### 
;*Forget about the kindly little extraterrestrials of Close Encoun
ters. Forget about the cute ones inSfar Wars. The title character of
Alien is neither kindly nor cute. The title character of Alien maybe
the single nastiest fellow ever cooked up by scriptwriter and
special effects man.
The plot sounds like a glorified version of the '50s bug-eyed
monster flicks which populate the late show. In essence, that's
ekactly what it is, though directed with a punch and panache that
h»ts even the most skeptical viewer right between the eyes.
The Nostromo, a space craft returning to Earth with a cargo of
mineral ore and a crew of seven, receives a distress call. When
they land to investigate, the crew discovers that while the being
who sent the signal is long dead, there is another, even stranger
kind of life attached to the planet. A crew member is attacked.
When he is brought on board for treatment, the alien comes with
him. The story is simple but chillingly effective.
Hits hard
Alien, which opens tomorrow in Bay Area theaters, was di
rected by Ridley Scott. Scott directed last year's The Duellists, a
film which received critical hosannas but little notice from the
public. But while The Duellists was slow-moving and contempla
tive, Alien hits hard and fast.
The Duellists was heavy on atmosphere, creating a dreamy
sense of timelessness. Alien is equally atmospheric — though its
images are dark and contrasty while The Duellists was a wash of
soft colors — but the dream it creates might more aptly be termed
a nightmare.
Organic quality
Visually, Alien is everything that Brian de Palma (The Tury) has
been unsuccessfully trying to achieve for years. Both filmmakers
are concerned with conjuring up striking images. But Scott suc-

ceeds where de Palma failed by backing up his images with
characters we care about and with a plot, though obsessively
single minded ("can the crew kill the alien before it kills them?"),
which builds in interest as it progresses.
Many of the sets were designed by surrealistic artist H.R. Ciger.
They have an organic quality that is a far cry from the sterile
environs of most films of the genre; an immense alien space
craft, for example, is designed as if it were once alive, with bone
and vein-like ribs. Even the Nostromo set, though filled with the
usual surfeit of blinking lights and dials, has a messiness which is
more redolent of a well-lived-in scow than of the sleek interiors of
Saturday morning science fiction fare.
Trappings
Scott uses these baroque trappings to build a movie which
preys on our fears of the dark, of being trapped, of being watched
by something we can sense but can't see. We see from the crew's
viewpoint; the audience in the theater never knows mote about
the workings of the alien than do the characters on the screen.
Scott's camera often puts us in the place of the person being
pursued by the alien, never in the place of the pursuer. So
skillfully does Scott use Hitchcockian identification techniques
that it soon becomes apparent that we as audience are the alien's
prey.
Twentieth Century-Fox is releasing Alien on the second an
niversary of the release of Star Wars, which the studio also pro
duced. If Alien is a smash hit — which it has every chance of
becoming — it will not be for the same reasons that Star Wars
became a hit. Star Wars played with our nostalgia for the simple,
easily-identifiable themes of the bedtime story. Alien turns off
the light and makes us fend for ourselves in the dark.
