Appearances by jazz vocalist
Betty Carter and saxophonist
|ohn Klemmer will highlight the
holiday weekend at Stanford.
Klemmer will be sharing the bill
with Robben Ford at the Keys
tone Palo Alto on Saturday even
ing. Carter will bring her trio to
Dinkelspiel on Sunday evening.
Perennially jazz fans redis
cover Betty Carter. She has de
veloped a cult-like audience
which makes up for its small size
by its dedication. But Betty Car
ter is no stranger to the jazz cri
tics â€” she has finished either
first or second in the Downbeat
Critics Poll consistently during
the past several years.
I first discovered Betty Carter
four years ago at the Berkeley
fazz festival and have remained a
dedicated Carterite ever since.
|ohn Klemmer, a mellifluous
saxophonist, has recently tin
kered with solo saxophone work
and more accessible work with
Brazilian rhythms. -Ted Gioi,i
