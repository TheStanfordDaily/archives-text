## 'Candide' comes a-round to Lag 
### 
The best of all possible worlds.
That's Candide, of course.
Not the novel but the musical, which
Lagunita will present today through
Sunday in what director Camis Stielher
calls a "raunchy, exciting and daring"
production.
The 1956 Broadway original was
harmless enough, flopping in two
months. It was created, though, by
such classy names as director Tryone
Guthrie, composer Leonard Bernstein,
librettist Lillian Hellman and lyricists
Richard Wilbur, lohn Latouche and
Dorothy Parker. (Not to leave out Vol
taire, who started it all.)
The racier, thus more popular, 1974
revival was staged by Hal Prince, with a
new book by Hugh Wheeler and addi
tional lyrics by Stephen Sondheim.
"We're drawing from the revival and
doing this as environmental theater,"
explained producer Robert Wildman.
Instead of staying on a "quote, unquote

stage," the action will be spread among
ramps and playing areas throughout
the Lagdining hall. Theaudience will sit
in and among a set designed and lit by
Terence Ross.
"The actors will come out from
everywhere," said assistant director
Mike Mayhew. "They'll be behind you,
on top —"
"Carrying bodies, throwing confetti,
getting you involved," added Stielher.
Starring are John Creeno as Candide,
Beth Dyrud as Cunegonde, house fel
low Rob Robinson, Curtis Loer, Barbara
Nelson, Mayhew and Lilli Ann Linford
as The Old Lady With One Buttock.
The chorus, though, is the show's
heart, Stielher said. "With 23 people
taking 115 parts, the company becomes
the most important thing. It involves
lots of quick changes in character and
costume.
"We had to build a lot of trust and
unity in the cast," Mayhew added. "We

went through ensemble preparation
. . . the cast's ability to be open and
honest about it."
Stielher describes Candide as the
trials of a man who keeps finding and
losing his love throughout the world,
his rosy optimism soiled slightly by
mayhem, murder and a woman "true to
him in her heart" — if not in the
boudoir.
"It's a funny, exciting show," she
said. "Vet, it never hides the fact it's
from the book. It takes great joys in its
literariness. The original was idea
oriented, but our show, like the revival,
will be picture-oriented. The action will
move from picture scene to picture
scene, like a triptych."
"Be prepared for a party, though,"
Mayhew warned. "Be prepared for ev
erything."
(Candide opens tonight at 9:30 p.m.
and plays Friday through Sunday at 9
p.m. in the Lagunita dining hall.)
