# Energy: Carter fears inaction

### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter's decision to lift oil
price controls was loudly denounced
by his own party in the House yester
day, while Carter said he fears the
nation won't cope with energy prob
lems unless there is a severe crisis.
Members of the House Democra
tic Caucus tentatively approved a
measure expressing "Democratic
policy" that existing price lids on
domestically produced crude oil
"shall be continued and enforced."
The action was by voice vote and is
subject to ratification by a recorded,
roll-call vote scheduled for today.
However, formal adoption of the re
solution was expected by those on
both sides of the issue.
Carter made his assertion while
participating in a two-way video
broadcast that linked the White
House with a convention of the Na
tional Cable Television Association
in Las Vegas, Nev.
The president said he fears the na
tion will avoid dealing with energy
problems "unless there is such a se
vere crisis with shortages that the
American people are shocked."
Carter reiterated his view that
Congress has shown "excessive
timidity" in dealing with the energy
issues. "So far, the American people
have not faced a sure fact — that we
have an energy shortage. It's going to
get worse in the future unless we act
together," he said.
Earlier, the Democratic caucus,
composed of all 276 House Democ
rats, had rejected on a 124-96 pro
cedural vote a last-minute attempt at
a compromise sought by White
House allies.

The "compromise" would have
urged the president to continue
price controls at least until Congress
enacts a stiff "windfall profits" tax.
But rebellious Democrats decided
they wanted nothing to do with the
new proposal and approved a mo
tion that prohibited it from even
being considered.
Even though the resolution would
not be binding, the action by the
Democratic Caucus was a major re

buff to Carter's efforts to reduce U.S.
reliance on imported oil by en
couraging more domestic produc
tion and by making petroleum pro
ducts more expensive.
Congressional approval is not re
quired for Carter's decision to lift
price lids on domestically produced
oil beginning )une 1 and to allow
prices to rise to world levels by Oct.
1981.
