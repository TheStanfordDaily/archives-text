Being Human, an hour-long
special documentary produced by
Dr. Edward Rubenstein, dean of
the Office of Postgraduate Educa
tion at the Medical School here,
will be broadcast in the Bay Area
May 26 and 27. Rubenstein de
scribed the show as "highly
evolutionary," saying that it deals
with human uniqueness — what
sets human beings apart from
other species.
Rubenstein said that in writing
Being Human he was addressing
one of the deep health problems
in this country which has to do
with how humans treat them
selves and others.
"When you think about it,"he
said, "if we could cure heart dis
ease and cancer, the remaining
problems (suicide, homicide, ac
cidents and health abuse) are un
approachable in the traditional
way." Rubenstein said he believes
that this kind of behavior relates
to a general disillusionment with
society.
"Until this century we had
achieved a certain degree of inner
harmony and social order by the
formulation of illusions about the
nature of life and man. Now sci
ence has inadvertantly contri-

buted to this misanthropy by shat
tering these illusions. Emerging in
place of these illusions are con
ceptions of the way nature really is
— that is far more wonderful than
most of the romantic notions con
ceived."
Rubenstein said that on this
earth the achievement of nature
culminates in the creation of man.
He said he is "tired of reading
about human failings" and in
Being Human, he wants to call at
tention to an "extraordinary crea
ture brimming with capacity for
constructive change."
