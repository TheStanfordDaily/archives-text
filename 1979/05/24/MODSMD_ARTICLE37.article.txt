### 
El Salvador imposes martial law
San Salvador, El Salvador — President Carlos
Humberto Romero imposed a state of siege yes
terday to help his military-backed government
deal with a wave of violence and rebellion that has
left 80 persons dead and more than 100 persons
injured in three weeks.
Earlier yesterday, police reported, leftist gun
men ambushed and killed the education minister
— one day after 14 persons were slain by police
outside the occupied Venezuelan Embassy.
The ongoing violence in this Central American
nation prompted the Venezuelan government to
fly about 50 of its citizens back to Caracas on milit
ary planes.
Humberto Romero, who had met with security
officials and political leaders of his military-backed
regime before declaring the limited form of mar
tial law, has said several times he would impose a
state of siege if the rebellion continued.
The state of siege allows the government to
search without warrant and arrest suspects with
out charge, and suspends constitutional guaran
tees. The last one was declared in May 1977 after
student disturbances.
At least 80 persons have been killed and more
than 100 wounded since anti-government violence
erupted May 4. About 40 buses have been burned
by terrorists. Militants of the Popular Revolutio
nary Bloc have seized a number of churches and
three foreign embassies. They still occupy the
churches and two of the embassies.
Israel launches revenge attack
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli warplanes swooped
down on three Palestinian villages in Lebanon at
sundown yesterday in revenge attacks for a PLO
bombing that killed two Israeli women and an
18-month-old baby at a bus stop in Tel Aviv.
A communique from Yasser Arafat's high com
mand in Beirut said 14 Palestinians and Lebanese,
including civilians, were killed and 50 wounded in
the attacks. Western newsmen reaching one of the
stricken villages saw the bodies of three guerrillas
who were killed when a bomb dropped on an
anti-aircraft position.
Lebanese provincial authorities also said Israeli
naval artillery shelled the southern town of Tyre
for 30 minutes late yesterday. No casualty reports
or independent confirmation of the attack were
available.
The Israeli planes hit the PLO-controlled towns
of Damour, Naameh and Aichiyeh, said a PLO
communique. Damour and Naameh are about 10
miles south of the Lebanese capital. Aichiyeh is
about 40 miles south of Beirut and a frequent
target of Israeli air and artillery attacks.
Israeli troops were also preparing to remove
several hundred stubborn Jewish settlers from a
10-acre vegetable plot in a sector of the Sinai
Peninsula, which is scheduled to be returned to
Egypt in two days.
Fed sees long inflation fight
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman G. Wil
liam Miller said yesterday that President Jimmy
Carter's voluntary wage-price guidelines are
showing results in the fight against inflation. But it
will require six or seven years to win the war, he

added.
"It is my personal judgment that we have had
lower price increases and lower wage increases
than we would have had without" the guidelines,
Miller told the House Ways and Means Commit
tee. He stoutly denied the economy is headed into
recession.
Miller said a combination of restrained federal
spending, the wage-price guidelines and the Fed
eral Reserve Board's money policies should re
duce inflation by one-half to three-quarters of a
percentage point a year. Controlling inflation
without creating a recession will require such dili
gence for six or seven years, Miller added.
But, he said, one tax "loophole" threatens to
undo the good that federal economic policies aim
to accomplish.
It allows a tax exemption for state and local
bonds used for home mortgages, he said, and if
Congress does not close it, the board would be
required to tighten money and increase other in
terest rates.
Without such a tightening, he added, the tax
exempt subsidy for homebuyers would put such a
strain on the supply of credit that businesses
would be denied the money needed to expand,
increase productivity and lower inflation.
Lance indicted on fraud charges
Atlanta — Bert Lance, President Jimmy Carter's
close friend, financial adviser and former federal
budget director, was indicted yesterday on
charges of bank fraud, conspiracy and misapply
ing bank funds.
Lance and three others were accused in a grand
jury indictment of involvement in a conspiracy
involving more than $20 million in loans, which
allegedly caused losses of more than $500,000 to a
number of Georgia banks.
The four men were named in a 33-count indict
ment.
Lance, 47, once one of the president's closest
advisers, was forced to resign as Carter's director
of the Office of Management and Budget after
some of the allegations became public.
In a Statement issued through his attorney after
the indictment was made public, Lance contended
that pressure from the news media prompted the
grand jury action. He said, "I know that no jury will
find me guilty of the charges directed against me."
Carter, who had been a staunch defender of
Lance, was not mentioned in the indictment and
did not appear to figure in any of the complex
financial dealings listed in the document.
The 71-page indictment described an intricate
series of 383 loans and financial transactions, many
of them related, involving 41 banks. The docu
ment listed 218 specific acts by the defendants in
support of the charges.
Florida to press for executions
Starke, Fla. — Attorney General Jim Smith, sur
prised by two stays of execution won by John
Spenkelink, vowed yesterday to see that the mur
derer is electrocuted before his death warrant ex
pires at noon tomorrow.
"Our goal is to have the stays removed by noon
Friday so that the execution can take place," Smith
said in Tallahassee before flying to New Orleans to

ask the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to over
turn a stay issued Tuesday by one of its justices,
Elbert Tuttle.
The attorney general arrived at the appeals court
in New Orleans 10 minutes after closing time, but
officials stayed open to accept his petition.
Smith said he and other prosecutors would also
go to Washington today to try to derail a second
stay issued early yesterday morning by U.S. Sup
reme Court justice Thurgood Marshall.
Spenkelink had been scheduled to go to the
electric chair at 7 a.m. yesterday for the 1973 mur
der of a traveling companion.
But because Spenkelink's death warrant hasn't
yet expired, he remains a condemned man, still
held in the prison's Q wing only steps from the
electric chair.
Election may spur Canadian split
Toronto — Canada's national elections made it
more clear than ever: There are two Canadas —
one French, one English. Keeping them together
will be the chief task of Prime Minister-elect joe
Clark.
Only two of the 136 Progressive Conservative
members of Parliament (MPs) who make up the
39-year-old Clark's new government are from pre
dominantly French-speaking Quebec, which has
one-quarter of Canada's population. One of those
two is of English ancestry.
The Liberals of ousted Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau, on the other hand, count almost two
thirds of their 114 MPs in Quebec, almost all of
them French, as they go into opposition in the
House of Commons.
Clark won a tight race, his party falling just six
votes short of the 142 needed for an outright
majority. He now must look to the New Democ
rats, who captured 26 seats, or the Social Credit
Party, which won six, to form a coalition minority
government.
Clark's lack of Quebec ties may make it difficult
to find compatible French-Canadians to serve in
high government posts.
The separatist Parti Quebecois that governs
Quebec has planned a provincial referendum for
this fall or next spring to ask for a mandate to
negotiate independence from the rest of English
speaking Canada, though with continued close
economic ties.
Stocks slide as rally ends
New York — Bluechip issues bore the brunt of
the selling as the stock market turned downward
yesterday, ending a moderate rally that began in
Tuesday's session.
The Dow jones industrial average fell 7.97 to
837.40, reflecting weakness in the big-name
stocks. Other indicators showed smaller declines.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 30.39
million shares, against 30.40 million the day be
fore.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except fog or low clouds
near the ocean extending inland locally nights and
mornings. Lows in the 50s. Highs in the 60s along
the coast to the 70s and low 80s inland.

Election may spur Canadian split
Toronto — Canada's national elections made it
more clear than ever: There are two Canadas —
one French, one English. Keeping them together
will be the chief task of Prime Minister-elect joe
Clark.
Only two of the 136 Progressive Conservative
members of Parliament (MPs) who make up the
39-year-old Clark's new government are from pre
dominantly French-speaking Quebec, which has
one-quarter of Canada's population. One of those
two is of English ancestry.
The Liberals of ousted Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau, on the other hand, count almost two
thirds of their 114 MPs in Quebec, almost all of
them French, as they go into opposition in the
House of Commons.
Clark won a tight race, his party falling just six
votes short of the 142 needed for an outright
majority. He now must look to the New Democ
rats, who captured 26 seats, or the Social Credit
Party, which won six, to form a coalition minority
government.
Clark's lack of Quebec ties may make it difficult
to find compatible French-Canadians to serve in
high government posts.
The separatist Parti Quebecois that governs
Quebec has planned a provincial referendum for
this fall or next spring to ask for a mandate to
negotiate independence from the rest of English

economic ties.
Stocks slide as rally ends
New York — Bluechip issues bore the brunt of
the selling as the stock market turned downward
yesterday, ending a moderate rally that began in
Tuesday's session.
The Dow jones industrial average fell 7.97 to

stocks. Other indicators showed smaller declines.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 30.39

Today's weather

El Salvador imposes martial law
San Salvador, El Salvador — President Carlos
Humberto Romero imposed a state of siege yes
terday to help his military-backed government
deal with a wave of violence and rebellion that has
left 80 persons dead and more than 100 persons
injured in three weeks.
Earlier yesterday, police reported, leftist gun
men ambushed and killed the education minister
— one day after 14 persons were slain by police
outside the occupied Venezuelan Embassy.
The ongoing violence in this Central American
nation prompted the Venezuelan government to
fly about 50 of its citizens back to Caracas on milit
ary planes.
Humberto Romero, who had met with security
officials and political leaders of his military-backed
regime before declaring the limited form of mar
tial law, has said several times he would impose a
state of siege if the rebellion continued.
The state of siege allows the government to
search without warrant and arrest suspects with
out charge, and suspends constitutional guaran
tees. The last one was declared in May 1977 after
student disturbances.
At least 80 persons have been killed and more
than 100 wounded since anti-government violence
erupted May 4. About 40 buses have been burned
by terrorists. Militants of the Popular Revolutio
nary Bloc have seized a number of churches and
three foreign embassies. They still occupy the
churches and two of the embassies.
Israel launches revenge attack
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli warplanes swooped
down on three Palestinian villages in Lebanon at
sundown yesterday in revenge attacks for a PLO
bombing that killed two Israeli women and an
18-month-old baby at a bus stop in Tel Aviv.
A communique from Yasser Arafat's high com
mand in Beirut said 14 Palestinians and Lebanese,
including civilians, were killed and 50 wounded in
the attacks. Western newsmen reaching one of the
stricken villages saw the bodies of three guerrillas
who were killed when a bomb dropped on an
anti-aircraft position.
Lebanese provincial authorities also said Israeli
naval artillery shelled the southern town of Tyre
for 30 minutes late yesterday. No casualty reports
or independent confirmation of the attack were
available.
The Israeli planes hit the PLO-controlled towns
of Damour, Naameh and Aichiyeh, said a PLO
communique. Damour and Naameh are about 10
miles south of the Lebanese capital. Aichiyeh is
about 40 miles south of Beirut and a frequent
target of Israeli air and artillery attacks.
Israeli troops were also preparing to remove
several hundred stubborn Jewish settlers from a
10-acre vegetable plot in a sector of the Sinai
Peninsula, which is scheduled to be returned to
Egypt in two days.
Fed sees long inflation fight
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman G. Wil
liam Miller said yesterday that President Jimmy
Carter's voluntary wage-price guidelines are
showing results in the fight against inflation. But it
will require six or seven years to win the war, he

added.
"It is my personal judgment that we have had
lower price increases and lower wage increases
than we would have had without" the guidelines,
Miller told the House Ways and Means Commit
tee. He stoutly denied the economy is headed into
recession.
Miller said a combination of restrained federal
spending, the wage-price guidelines and the Fed
eral Reserve Board's money policies should re
duce inflation by one-half to three-quarters of a
percentage point a year. Controlling inflation
without creating a recession will require such dili
gence for six or seven years, Miller added.
But, he said, one tax "loophole" threatens to
undo the good that federal economic policies aim
to accomplish.
It allows a tax exemption for state and local
bonds used for home mortgages, he said, and if
Congress does not close it, the board would be
required to tighten money and increase other in
terest rates.
Without such a tightening, he added, the tax
exempt subsidy for homebuyers would put such a
strain on the supply of credit that businesses
would be denied the money needed to expand,
increase productivity and lower inflation.
Lance indicted on fraud charges
Atlanta — Bert Lance, President Jimmy Carter's
close friend, financial adviser and former federal
budget director, was indicted yesterday on
charges of bank fraud, conspiracy and misapply
ing bank funds.
Lance and three others were accused in a grand
jury indictment of involvement in a conspiracy
involving more than $20 million in loans, which
allegedly caused losses of more than $500,000 to a
number of Georgia banks.
The four men were named in a 33-count indict
ment.
Lance, 47, once one of the president's closest
advisers, was forced to resign as Carter's director
of the Office of Management and Budget after
some of the allegations became public.
In a Statement issued through his attorney after
the indictment was made public, Lance contended
that pressure from the news media prompted the
grand jury action. He said, "I know that no jury will
find me guilty of the charges directed against me."
Carter, who had been a staunch defender of
Lance, was not mentioned in the indictment and
did not appear to figure in any of the complex
financial dealings listed in the document.
The 71-page indictment described an intricate
series of 383 loans and financial transactions, many
of them related, involving 41 banks. The docu
ment listed 218 specific acts by the defendants in
support of the charges.
Florida to press for executions
Starke, Fla. — Attorney General Jim Smith, sur
prised by two stays of execution won by John
Spenkelink, vowed yesterday to see that the mur

"Our goal is to have the stays removed by noon
Friday so that the execution can take place," Smith
said in Tallahassee before flying to New Orleans to

ask the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to over
turn a stay issued Tuesday by one of its justices,
Elbert Tuttle.
The attorney general arrived at the appeals court
in New Orleans 10 minutes after closing time, but
officials stayed open to accept his petition.
Smith said he and other prosecutors would also
go to Washington today to try to derail a second
stay issued early yesterday morning by U.S. Sup
reme Court justice Thurgood Marshall.
Spenkelink had been scheduled to go to the
electric chair at 7 a.m. yesterday for the 1973 mur

But because Spenkelink's death warrant hasn't

charges of bank fraud, conspiracy and misapply
ing bank funds.
Lance and three others were accused in a grand
jury indictment of involvement in a conspiracy
involving more than $20 million in loans, which
allegedly caused losses of more than $500,000 to a
number of Georgia banks.
The four men were named in a 33-count indict
ment.
Lance, 47, once one of the president's closest
advisers, was forced to resign as Carter's director
of the Office of Management and Budget after
some of the allegations became public.
In a Statement issued through his attorney after
the indictment was made public, Lance contended
that pressure from the news media prompted the
grand jury action. He said, "I know that no jury will
find me guilty of the charges directed against me."
Carter, who had been a staunch defender of
Lance, was not mentioned in the indictment and
did not appear to figure in any of the complex
financial dealings listed in the document.
The 71-page indictment described an intricate
series of 383 loans and financial transactions, many
of them related, involving 41 banks. The docu
ment listed 218 specific acts by the defendants in
support of the charges.
Florida to press for executions
Starke, Fla. — Attorney General Jim Smith, sur
prised by two stays of execution won by John
Spenkelink, vowed yesterday to see that the mur
derer is electrocuted before his death warrant ex
pires at noon tomorrow.
"Our goal is to have the stays removed by noon
Friday so that the execution can take place," Smith
said in Tallahassee before flying to New Orleans to

ask the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to over
turn a stay issued Tuesday by one of its justices,
Elbert Tuttle.
The attorney general arrived at the appeals court
in New Orleans 10 minutes after closing time, but
officials stayed open to accept his petition.
Smith said he and other prosecutors would also
go to Washington today to try to derail a second
stay issued early yesterday morning by U.S. Sup
reme Court justice Thurgood Marshall.
Spenkelink had been scheduled to go to the
electric chair at 7 a.m. yesterday for the 1973 mur
der of a traveling companion.
But because Spenkelink's death warrant hasn't
yet expired, he remains a condemned man, still
held in the prison's Q wing only steps from the
electric chair.
Election may spur Canadian split
Toronto — Canada's national elections made it
more clear than ever: There are two Canadas —
one French, one English. Keeping them together
will be the chief task of Prime Minister-elect joe
Clark.
Only two of the 136 Progressive Conservative
members of Parliament (MPs) who make up the
39-year-old Clark's new government are from pre
dominantly French-speaking Quebec, which has
one-quarter of Canada's population. One of those
two is of English ancestry.
The Liberals of ousted Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau, on the other hand, count almost two
thirds of their 114 MPs in Quebec, almost all of
them French, as they go into opposition in the
House of Commons.
Clark won a tight race, his party falling just six
votes short of the 142 needed for an outright
majority. He now must look to the New Democ
rats, who captured 26 seats, or the Social Credit
Party, which won six, to form a coalition minority
government.
Clark's lack of Quebec ties may make it difficult
to find compatible French-Canadians to serve in
high government posts.
The separatist Parti Quebecois that governs
Quebec has planned a provincial referendum for
this fall or next spring to ask for a mandate to
negotiate independence from the rest of English
speaking Canada, though with continued close
economic ties.

The Dow jones industrial average fell 7.97 to

New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 30.39
million shares, against 30.40 million the day be

Today's weather

El Salvador imposes martial law
San Salvador, El Salvador — President Carlos
Humberto Romero imposed a state of siege yes
terday to help his military-backed government
deal with a wave of violence and rebellion that has
left 80 persons dead and more than 100 persons
injured in three weeks.
Earlier yesterday, police reported, leftist gun
men ambushed and killed the education minister
— one day after 14 persons were slain by police
outside the occupied Venezuelan Embassy.
The ongoing violence in this Central American
nation prompted the Venezuelan government to
fly about 50 of its citizens back to Caracas on milit
ary planes.
Humberto Romero, who had met with security
officials and political leaders of his military-backed
regime before declaring the limited form of mar
tial law, has said several times he would impose a
state of siege if the rebellion continued.
The state of siege allows the government to
search without warrant and arrest suspects with
out charge, and suspends constitutional guaran
tees. The last one was declared in May 1977 after
student disturbances.
At least 80 persons have been killed and more
than 100 wounded since anti-government violence
erupted May 4. About 40 buses have been burned
by terrorists. Militants of the Popular Revolutio
nary Bloc have seized a number of churches and
three foreign embassies. They still occupy the
churches and two of the embassies.
Israel launches revenge attack
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli warplanes swooped
down on three Palestinian villages in Lebanon at
sundown yesterday in revenge attacks for a PLO
bombing that killed two Israeli women and an
18-month-old baby at a bus stop in Tel Aviv.
A communique from Yasser Arafat's high com
mand in Beirut said 14 Palestinians and Lebanese,
including civilians, were killed and 50 wounded in
the attacks. Western newsmen reaching one of the
stricken villages saw the bodies of three guerrillas
who were killed when a bomb dropped on an
anti-aircraft position.
Lebanese provincial authorities also said Israeli
naval artillery shelled the southern town of Tyre
for 30 minutes late yesterday. No casualty reports
or independent confirmation of the attack were
available.
The Israeli planes hit the PLO-controlled towns
of Damour, Naameh and Aichiyeh, said a PLO
communique. Damour and Naameh are about 10
miles south of the Lebanese capital. Aichiyeh is
about 40 miles south of Beirut and a frequent
target of Israeli air and artillery attacks.
Israeli troops were also preparing to remove
several hundred stubborn Jewish settlers from a
10-acre vegetable plot in a sector of the Sinai
Peninsula, which is scheduled to be returned to
Egypt in two days.
Fed sees long inflation fight
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman G. Wil
liam Miller said yesterday that President Jimmy
Carter's voluntary wage-price guidelines are
showing results in the fight against inflation. But it
will require six or seven years to win the war, he

added.
"It is my personal judgment that we have had
lower price increases and lower wage increases
than we would have had without" the guidelines,
Miller told the House Ways and Means Commit
tee. He stoutly denied the economy is headed into
recession.
Miller said a combination of restrained federal
spending, the wage-price guidelines and the Fed
eral Reserve Board's money policies should re
duce inflation by one-half to three-quarters of a
percentage point a year. Controlling inflation
without creating a recession will require such dili
gence for six or seven years, Miller added.
But, he said, one tax "loophole" threatens to
undo the good that federal economic policies aim
to accomplish.
It allows a tax exemption for state and local
bonds used for home mortgages, he said, and if
Congress does not close it, the board would be
required to tighten money and increase other in
terest rates.
Without such a tightening, he added, the tax
exempt subsidy for homebuyers would put such a
strain on the supply of credit that businesses
would be denied the money needed to expand,
increase productivity and lower inflation.
