# Vulnerability of mind allows cult success
## Peoples Temple defector speaks out 
### Robert Reed 
The vulnerability of the human
mind is what allows cult groups like
the People's Temple to take control
over a person's life, according to
leannie Mills, a former member of
the People's Temple.
Mills, speaking before an audience
of well over 500 in Prof. Philip Zim
bardo's "General Psychology" class
yesterday, said, "The main thing
people need to realize is the vul
nerability of the human mind. . . .
The human mind is an incredibly
fragile thing."
Mills, whom Zimbardo described
as a modern-day hero, along with her
husband and children, broke away
from the People's Temple in 1975
after six years under the influence of
the cult's leader, the Reverend Jim
Jones.
After her defection from the
group, she actively tried to discredit
it, while setting up the Human Free
dom Center, a social workshop de
voted to helping ex-cult members
readjust to the outside world.
"People always say 'I would never
get caught up in a cult group,' " Mills
said.
Very rational persons join cults

such as the People's Temple, she
said. Among the members of the
People's Temple were doctors,
lawyers and widely respected jour
nalists. "They weren't all rejects of
society," Mills said. "They were wil
ling to go through it for the ideal they
thought they were working for."
Mills said that it is through the use
of mind control that cult leaders
amass followings. The cult leader
fosters an image of his cult as a family
while pretending to provide a cause
for his followers, according to Mills.
After this, the cult leader "has to de
stroy your own personal belief struc
ture," she said. Once he destroys
that a person is susceptible to the
beliefs of the cult.
After showing the inadequacy of
the person's personal belief struc
ture, the cult leader then provides all
the answers, usually in the form of a
Utopian ideal. "There are 3000 cult
groups and there are 3000 Utopias,"
Mills said.
"All the different cult groups have
a pleasant recruitment process,"
Mills said. "You don't feel that you

have any reason to fear."
The public thought the People's
Temple was a respectable institution
because of "carefully planned pub
licity" by Temple members, Mills
said. Good news about the cult was
sent out to the media through news
releases.
Yet, she said, when the media tried
to investigate cults like the People's
Temple, things such as "multi
million dollar lawsuits, rattlesnakes
appearing in mailboxes and baseball
bat beatings" occurred.
The People's Temple was also
highly respected because its mem
bers were supposedly disciplines of
Christ, Mills said. "Disciples of
Christ are not considered to be a
cult."
The good of the group becomes
paramount over the good of the indi
vidual in the cult, Mills said. Those in
cults tell themselves, "If they say one
thing and I say another, then I'm
wrong."
This idea appeals to some because
there is "no need to compete. The
wealthy and the poor have finally

found a common meeting ground,"
she said.
"The main thing is (to) keep your
members busy. Otherwise, they
might have time to think," she said.
While Mills was with the People's
Temple she worked 18 hours a day
while getting only four hours of
sleep.
"It almost becomes a competition
to see who's suffered most for the
cause," she said. "The more you suf
fer, the more committed you feel."
Peer-group pressure for com
pliance to Jones' ways was consider
able, she said. "Peer pressure was so
great that we sat by and watched
while members of our family were
brutally beaten," she said.
She recounted an incident in
which she stood by and watched
(and did nothing else) while her
daughter was severely whipped 75
times with a board.
Mills said that often, as with Jones
and the People's Temple, the leader
of the cult will make all the decisions
for his members and in effect run
their lives, while casting himself in
the image of a father. "The role of a
child is an extremely comfortable
