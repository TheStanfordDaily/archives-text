# UCLA snaps netters' winning streak 6-2

### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's men's tennis team
dropped a tough 6-2 decision to top
ranked UCLA yesterday at the NCAA
championship in Athens, Ca. The
loss ended a 10-match winning streak
for the Cards and was also their first
loss in the NCAAs since the team
format was introduced two years
ago.
The match began evenly. The

Cards won the first set of the first,
second and third singles matches,
while UCLA won the first set of the
fourth, fifth and six singles. Barely
into the second set, rain caused a
half-hour delay before tournament
officials moved the match two blocks
down the street to the indoor col
iseum. The indoor surface was not
the faster carpet-like surface used
last year, but instead was quite simi
lar to the outdoor surface.
Lloyd Bourne started the Cards out
on the right foot with his 11th straight
NCAA team tournament singles win.
With his two-handed backhand in
top form, Bourne soundly beat Mike
Harrington 6-4, 6-4.
For Bourne it was especially satisfy
ing since he was beaten badly by Har
rington when they met in Westwood.
Since then he has taken Harrington
to the cleaners twice.
The Cards almost jumped to a 2-0
lead. Peter Rennert, who has been
having troubles lately, battled free
swinging Fritz Buehning evenly, but
ended up three points short in the
number one singles match. Buehn
ing won the third-set tiebreaker 5-2
to win the match 3-6, 6-3, 7-6.
Singles performances by the
freshmen were the key when the
Cards beat UCLA at Maples Pavilion
earlier this season. Tim Mayotte,
Scott Bondurant and Jeff Arons did
not lose a set in that match.

Yesterday, however, was a diffe
rent story. Only Mayotte was able to
come up with a victory, defeating
feisty Blaine Willenborg 6-2, 1-6, 7-6
(5-2).
UCLA went ahead 4-2 when Bruce
Brescia, hero of the Bruins' com
eback win over Pepperdine Tuesday,
scored a 6-4, 6-2 triumph over Jim
Hodges.
The match was clinched when
Buehning and Willenborg, who lost

in the last point of the tiebreaker
against Rennert and Bourne in
Maples, bested the Card duo in a rol
ler coaster match 6-2, 1-6, 6-2.
The win put UCLA in the finals to
morrow against Trinity, who de
feated Southern Methodist Univer
sity (SMU) 5-4. For the first time in
three years, the Cards will not be
playing in the feature match. Instead,
they will play SMU tomorrow for
third place.
